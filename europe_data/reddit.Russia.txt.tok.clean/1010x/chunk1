a massive congratulations to kazakhstan ( i think ) for being the only country who knows about the colonel . 
  there 's no mcdonalds or subway in kazakhstan . 
  i think kfc and burger king are the only famous franchises there . 
  yeah , in moscow it has been banned since the 1th of june i believe . 
  they ask for your driver 's license or passport in the shops now if you want to buy any energy drink . 
  as a moscow citizen who is pretty defensive about russia , i 'd love to say that this is a biased video , that nothing like this happens ... 
  sadly , i 'm not even a little bit surprised by these reactions . 
  frankly , i 'd also stare at these guys , not because i dislike them but because it is so rare to see this here in russia . 
  finally , someone with sense . 
  yes , the situation with lgbt community in russian is really difficult , but really , nobody will throw you in jail , kill you , beat you for having relationships with the person of same gender . 
  you can even kiss on the streets , hold hands - no one gives a damn , as long as you ignore some salty looks from mostly elderly people . 
  is lgbt community discriminated in russia ? 
  sure . 
  but it 's not that bad like in middle-east or even some eastern european countries . 
  there are gays in the government , putin personally awards medals to gay artists , and no one jails , beats or stones gays . 
  you ca n't just one day declare one thing that goes against mentality of entire generations and hope it goes well . 
  hatred against lgbt community is still very strong in ukraine and it will take entire generation raised by european values to change that , which i doubt will happen in ukraine soon . 
  i 'd never die for the current government ; i 'm currently actively avoiding army conscription due to widespread corruption and a high chance as a conscript to get a tour in ukraine and i basically hate everything russian politics represent . 
  however , i can say that i am really patriotic for russia itself , for its culture and its people . 
  i 'd never shy to tell that i 'm from russia and i 'd easily display our flag anywhere . 
  https://democraticpeace.wordpress.com/2008/11/24/getting-my-reestimate-of-maos-democide-out/ * `` this exceeds the 61,911,000 murdered by the soviet union 1917-1987 , with hitler far behind at 20,946,000 wiped out 1933-1945 . 
  '' * you are twisting the facts so much here . 
  how can you even compare soviet union and nazi germany in this context ? 
  the author says that soviet union collectively caused death of 60 million people in seventy years while germany killed half of that number in only ten years . 
  plus , you worded your post so that it would seem that you are still talking about poland , when the numbers represent the whole country . 
  i get that . 
  the point is that if he said that `` we hate soviet union because it was totalitarian dictatorship which oppressed poland for half a century '' , i 'd agree . 
  but he literally implied that `` soviets are worse than nazis , '' which is absolutely wrong . 
  sorry , did not check the other sources . 
  still , my point stands : 300,000 died under soviet regime , more than half were executed , some died of starvation and other causes , that may were influenced by soviet regime . 
  nazis intentionally exterminated 3 millions poles . 
  i know that both of the regimes were awful and merciless , but i just do n't get how can you say that nazis were better than soviets . 
  well , op is comparing soviets to nazis , which is the time period of 40s of the 20th century . 
  i sincerely hope you all do n't imply that poland would rather live under nazi rule instead of soviet one . 
  source ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nazi_crimes_against_the_polish_nation `` nazi crimes against the polish nation claimed the lives of ** 2.77 ** ** million ** ethnic poles , [ 1 ] and ** 2.7 ** to ** 2.9 ** ** million ** polish jews , according to estimates of the polish government-affiliated institute of national remembrance ( ipn ) . 
  [ 1 ] historians outside poland put the number of jewish victims of the holocaust in occupied poland at ** 3.0 million ** . '', 
  soviet union of course was n't the knight in shining armour , but to say that they were worse than nazis ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_repressions_of_polish_citizens_ ( 1939 % e2 % 80 % 9346 ) it is estimated that some ** 150,000 ** polish citizens died during the soviet occupation . 
  moscow is marvelous in summer and st. petersburg is beautiful throughout the whole year . 
  if you ever want to culturally enlighten yourself beyond western european culture , then russia is just the place for you to visit . 
  everything is dirt cheap for now because of the rouble 's fall , but i would n't expect the prices to stay the same for a long time . 
  sorry , i tried not to touch the subject . 
  my point is that considering what happened with ukraine , try to imagine what would happen in russia : ignoring major and terrific internal unrest , the external intervention will be absolutely crushing . 
  something along of what 's happening in ukraine , but on a much larger scale : chechnya will revolt , ukraine will fight for crimea , japan will press their sakhalin claims , usa may try to infiltrate if the revolutionary governement is not to be trusted with nuclear arsenal . 
  all these factors may result in a very , very violent situation , especially when nuclear weapons are involved . 
  absolutely . 
  it really did not work well for ukraine and it would completely demolish russia . 
  the right path is through gradual political changes which i hope will happen when putin * retires . 
  i think they are reverting the blame from themselves and softening the population . 
  when the crisis comes , they 'll say ` we told you so ' and ` everyone is in the same shit as you are ' so they do n't get protests or , i really hope not , revolutions . 
  tend to agree with you . 
  but you have to consider the fact that the soviet people were pretty much completely sheltered and isolated from any outside influence thus the government and insane brainwashed people did n't push anti-american propaganda * that * hard . 
  moreover , america was glorified due to dozens of years of iron curtain and lack of consumer goods . 
  mcdonalds , coca-cola and denim jeans were worshipped in 80s and 90s . 
  nice username . 
  are you russian ? 
  do you live in russia ? 
  did you live in ussr ? 
  i do n't get how can you comment on mentality of russian people . 
  smart people certainly do n't blame gorbachev for dismantling ussr and nobody in their right mind wants to return soviet union . 
  do n't listen to the vocal minority . 
  that 's brent . 
  russia is exporting urals , which was reaching 26 $ yesterday . 
  funny to see how the sudden was change in government 's propaganda . 
  i noticed it firsthand , as one day everything was fine , the economy was growing and oil would raise to be 100 $ and then , in just a single day , the government started warning the population to embrace for recession and the news started telling people about the economic crisis in russia . 
  guess it 's hard to keep up the illusion with the oil costing 26 $ . 
  are you serious ? 
  i 'm 18 now and ever since i was 8 , even as a kid , i could easily travel abroad . 
  i even travelled to lithuania without parents as a part of class trip . 
  russia does not restrict travel to first world countries unless it is countries themselves which restrict the travel with its visa policies . 
  things would be so much easier for ukraine if russia was its biggest problem . 
  its government is deeply , completely corrupt to the roots , its bureaucratic machine is corrupt and most of its business are corrupt . 
  soviet legacy , i suppose . 
  that 's not mentioning failing industry and failed economy thanks to beforementioned corruption . 
  russia is just another problem in the giant list of ukrainian fix list . 
  catherine the great is a decent choice , but russia had so much exceptional monarchs and leaders , it 's hard to choose one . 
  if i were to pick , i think peter the great would be a very good leader for russia in the game , since he 's the one who actually proclaimed russian empire for once . 
  on 9th of may , sure . 
  today is a regular day , i 've no idea what are you talking about here . 
  `` napoleon did nothing wrong ! '', 
  just joking . 
  to be honest , the main reason we glorify french defeat so greatly is because the time period of 1800 - 1840 was filled with the greatest poets russia has ever had : lermontov , pushkin and dozens of others . 
  plenty of their works were centered around the napoleon 's conquest and most of their works are now the most important part in russian education . 
  and of course war and peace by tolstoy . 
  ww1 was horrible for russia and nobody celebrates lost wars . 
  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_brest-litovsk ) i think napoleon 's defeat in 1812 is more glorified and famous here than any events that happened during ww1 . 
  aside from revolution , of course . 
  nobody here celebrates it tbh . 
  frankly , i kinda forgot about it until i read this thread here . 
  to be honest , as someone who has friends in crimea and hears their comments quite often , these sanctions just enable russian propaganda about evil west and confirms peoples ' opinions about corrupt ukraine government . 
  literally nobody i know in crimea thinks that russia is oppressor or occupant and instead of turning on russian government , crimean people now think of themselves as victims of the western capitalism , as a part of some kind of twisted crimean siege with americans as besiegers . 
  * just a note : i do not approve russian aggression in ukraine . 
  even if benevolent pony with marshmallow heart and the best intentions becomes president of russia , i do n't see scenario where russian government willingly gives back crimea . 
  it would be a political suicide and will create a huge distrust between russian citizens and the government . 
  in russia , for 2 years we 've been hearing on how crimea is rightful russian clay and , most importantly , what sacrifices we made and how much money we had to spend to make crimea russian . 
  no way somebody will revert this decision , unless threatened with military action , in which scenario the government will be able to shift the blame to ` evil americans ' or whatever . 
  football fans in the audience attract the worst people unfortunately . 
  i always dread big matches with russia since the fans are always ducking things up . 
  england got us the best present today !,
