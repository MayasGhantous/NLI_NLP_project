it happens because police in rufed is used mostly as method of crowd control and social security service for people who can not find good work - rather than a service to fight crime . 
  there is a lot of violence and police usually can not find anyone ( 5 + cases here ) but random bums to assign 20 + crimes to each for better statistics . 
  everyone know this and most do n't care about police . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'll start to post/add news again in 2015 . 
  i 'm ok , just do n't have enough time to gather news and post them . 
  last time i heard news about `` eurasian union '' ( 2 weeks ago ) kazakh and belorussian parliaments did n't ratify agreement about it ( only rufed did it - alone ) . 
  it seems they are n't eager to sink their economies along with russian federation - not without additional multi-billion bribes at least . 
  so recently belarus received $ 10 billions credit to build nuclear plant . 
  from georgian , moldovan , ukrainian experience - not joining neoussr means provocation . 
  also resistance to `` humanitarian invasions '' . 
  approximate calculation is somewhat easy : dagestan region reported 200 deaths . 
  dagestan is 1/50 of population of russia . 
   was the decision made right after the mh-17 was shot down ? 
  because mh17 was downed on july , 17 - not june , 17 . 
  that 's 30 billions euro - not trillions . 
  that 's 7.5 % of total budget . 
  and central bank has spent ~ 1.2 billions euros yesterday during single trading session to stabilize ruble - and failed . 
  30 billions will be enough to hold falling rouble for a month or two : it seems only central bank believe rouble wo n't turn into toilet paper in few months . 
   i really have to wonder what the hell they were thinking in kremlin ? 
  there is very old russian joke : we should declare war to germany and immediately surrender . 
  perhaps this is exactly that is happening right now - government is giving up the country to re-form it , like it happened with ussr . 
  that - or they are just a bunch of clueless idiots ( hanlon 's razor ) - and this variant is more realistic . 
  and dangerous . 
  terrorist act in chechnya : [ suicide bomber exploded ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29498909 ) when police attempted to check him on metal detector at the entrance to a concert . 
  it is interesting how chechnya is now a valuable target for terrorists because it 's the most prosperous region of russian federation due to enormous financial `` help '' from kremlin ( more like tribute for two civil wars ) . 
  `` suddenly '' , [ +240 warheads ( +17 % ) added during this year ] ( http://barentsobserver.com/en/security/2014/10/more-100-new-nukes-northern-waters-02-10 ) . 
  i guess now people will stop asking - why do i think kremlin is getting ready to a big war ? 
   russian people think that suffering is a sign of strength russian people do n't believe in anything - they are mostly apathetic . 
  and that 's the problem . 
  economical collapse ? 
  ok . war with neighbors ? 
  fine . 
  closed borders , no internet ? 
  whatever . 
  2 wars in chechnya ? 
  suspiciously looking [ terrorist acts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_apartment_bombings ) ? 
  no evidences of government 's involvement , must support dear leader instead of letting chechens go independent once and forever , they are too valuable asset for kremlin in case of civil war and revolution . 
  i believe long-term staying in baltic is n't the reason for invasion - the reason is to demonstrate nato can not protect them and therefore should be dissolved . 
  you are correct about everything . 
  you just miss one simple detail : kremlin is agree to kill economy and turn the country into north korea ( i believe borders will be closed + internet will be cut off before spring + default will happen very soon afterwards ) . 
  as one of my old friends said yesterday after i 've asked him if he is going to leave the country - `` in 90s we 've seen rouble exchange rate dropped by thousands percents , there were multiple defaults , in 80s there were empty shops and 1kg of sugar per month per person limit - we can easily survive anything '' . 
  us hegemony is already questioned by annexation of crimea . 
  if kremlin will succeed with baltic invasion it will effectively destroy `` pax americana '' . 
  i bet kremlin is agree to pay very high price for a victory like that . 
  apologies , can not link the blog right now - it has my real name , i 'll show it later when i 'll get out of russian federation . 
  as for target - there was a comment here how attack on currently unprotected baltic states with follow-up `` federalization '' of them may/will lead to dissolution of nato as non-existent entity . 
  ~ 12 months ago ( 6 months prior to shooting on maidan ) i wrote a blog post how russia will invade ukraine using georgian/moldovan tactics - `` unknown '' snipers , ethnic riots , `` protective '' invasion , `` captured '' tanks and airplanes , russian `` peacekeepers '' . 
  back then i 've recommended ukrainians to purchase sniper-spotting equipment in eastern regions and in kiev . 
  people said its absurd and i 'm crazy - because kremlin is n't crazy to do that . 
  reality turned out to be exactly the opposite . 
  now i think baltic states should purchase sniper-spotting equipment . 
  it can help to capture those `` unknown '' gru snipers which operate for like 25 years already - and it 's not that expensive as 200-500 tanks to repel russian invasion following `` lack of evidences '' ( and reaction from us/eu ) about russian military presence in the region . 
  this time it 's different : kremlin is running out of money too fast , i believe they are trying to start and finish next war before they 'll go bankrupt . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's about nato members ( yet ) - it may be preparation for invasions into ukraine , kazakhstan , belarus , moldova . 
  central bank has published 3 scenarios for financial market for next year . 
  first scenario assumed $ 105 price of oil , second - $ 90 , third - shock scenario - $ 60 . 
  but they also have +1 , unpublished variant - with 0 $ price of oil . 
  i did n't mean to say that as a guess . 
  i see the country is literally preparing to a war ( massive anti-eu/us propaganda , military budget increase , upcoming shutdown of internet , preparations for isolation of financial system , preparations for cheaper oil and complete oil embargo , closed borders , etc. ) . 
  that and gas games with eu during winter . 
  while people listen to this delirium rufed is getting ready to a larger military confrontation in the next 6-9 months . 
  [ brother ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118767/ ) is practically a historical movie about period of chaos and poverty shortly after ussr fall . 
  [ zhmurki ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420982/ ) - the same period depicted in dark comedy format . 
  suddenly , country has turned into 1/7 earth surface sized jail without basic freedom of movement right . 
  truly `` european '' country . 
  still the guys in kremlin think they represent heritage of kievan rus ( instead of tataro-mongols who have destroyed it ) and may borrow ideas for propaganda . 
   it was an advanced tactic used by the rus army , wherein a large group of soldiers could drag sea vessels across land . 
  you better do n't remind about this tactic - russians already did it 1100 years ago . 
  propaganda can not neutralize reality in which whole population now earn 10 % less money ( in usd/eur ) and pay more for food . 
  plus exchange rate still falling and food prices still grow - and there is nothing to stop this process , government actions only accelerate it , for some people starvation is already real perspective for this year . 
  it 's not about metaphysical points anymore , it 's about survival of people in the government - they have found themselves very close to syrian scenario and urgently need any available protection . 
  ** russian federation ** * sanctions resulted in rouble exchange rate to fall substantially + food prices have increased due to stupid self-inflicted sanctions . 
  this combination resulted in lesser purchasing power ( especially among poorest people ) and suddenly population - which was convinced by kremlin 's own propaganda to believe `` ukrainian separatists '' are real ( not fsb agents , `` lost '' russian soldiers , gru spetsnaz , bandits and russian volunteers armed by kremlin ) - this population is now seriously considering `` ukrainian variant '' for russian federation , people believe they can revolt and break away from kremlin - east ukrainian style ( i overheard some conversations about `` uprising against kremlin fascists '' in public - in relatively rich moscow region , just few kilometers away from kremlin ) ; * people in the government have realized they are just few % % of rouble exchange rate away from civil war and revolution - and started preparations to the war against population . 
  their first - very obvious - step is to prepare [ internet shutdown ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/19/09/2014/949993.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[item_1] ) , syrian style ; * another obvious action to prepare government to the war against population - [ cheches will serve in the military ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/21/09/2014/950342.shtml ) starting from this year ; it 's not like the government actually need chechens in the army ( there wo n't be much anyway ) - they just need to spread information about chechens may fight for the government ( and simply use bandits in military uniform ) ; * another [ oligarch was arrested ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/incidents/16/09/2014/949443.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[item_1] ) ( instead of khodorkovsky who was set free just few months ago ) - with official reason `` money laundering '' ( [ in english ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/09/russian-billionaire-placed-under-house-arrest-2014916222828710897.html ) ) . 
  thing is almost every company in russia is involved into money laundering - starting from minuscule 5 employees offices - and whole business is controlled by fsb ( literally - if you want to receive cash illegally - from your own bank account , mind you - you meet real fsb agents and pay them ~ 5 % ) . 
  so arresting someone for `` money laundering '' does not make any sense except for declaration `` surely it does not related to money laundering , it 's just authorities abuse uncontrollable power again '' . 
  most likely it 's igor sechin urgently need money for his sanctioned and sinking `` rosneft '' ; * [ anti-war , `` pro-ukrainian '' protests in moscow ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqn0heyqylc ) - allowed by authorities + [ reddit thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2h14dw/proukraine_demonstration_going_on_right_now_in/ ) ; personal note a.k.a. 
  speculation / prognosis : i expect government will need a reason to move armies into big cities so most likely they 'll allow our `` southern friends '' to start [ terrorist acts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_theater_hostage_crisis ) again and army will be used `` to protect ~ ~ ethnic russians ~ ~ population of big cities '' , as usually . 
  if i was an owner of air travel company - i 'd re-route all planes to stay away from russian air space ( or at least away from caucasus / southern russia region ) . 
  i was a bit busy so only essential news this time , my apologies . 
  i am unable to work legally . 
  some companies ignore lack of documents ( up to a certain level of responsibility ) - still i 've lost couple interesting careers ( for example i could n't get certification as [ sap erp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sap_erp ) business analyst ) . 
  to ask for an asylum i have to get out of russian federation first while crossing borders without any papers is a bit complicated thing to do . 
  i imagine i can not just come to a random embassy in moscow and ask for a passport . 
  i sincerely doubt i can get entry visa just to get asylum . 
  plus , once again , first i have to get out of rufed - it 's a bit complicated for `` non-citizen '' to cross borders . 
  at the moment of ussr fall i was in abkhazia . 
  from rufed authorities ' point of view i am foreigner - citizen of non-existent state of abkhazia , where 2 out of 3 my family members we killed and their real estate properties are in the hands of locals so my appearance there most likely will result in +1 grave in local cemetery . 
  since i do n't have documents rufed authorities refuse to issue documents . 
  theoretically i can , however , receive georgian citizenship - problem is a ) their embassy is closed and their consulate is n't functional too and b ) that 'll make me even more illegal in rufed than i am now . 
  thanks for the idea !, 
  however i believe `` i want out '' is for people who do n't have a clue - where to go ? 
  - while my problem is - i can not simply `` out '' , i 'm trapped . 
  thank you very much !, 
  if/when i 'll get any passport i 'll accept your offer . 
  which embassy would you suggest ? 
  i believe it will be wasting of time - their primary work ( besides espionage ) is to help their own citizen , not to hand out documents left and right to everyone who 's asking . 
  either i 'll get papers which will instantly make me an illegal alien - or i 'll have to go without any papers at all , as a person which does not exist . 
  this is going to be fun .
