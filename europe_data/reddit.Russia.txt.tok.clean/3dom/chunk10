  destroy rufed - the better . 
  and present government is doing damn good job in this direction by isolating and weakening the country . 
  it 's not far from reality . 
  if in 90s-00s russian government has resembled a gang of thugs with their barely legal privatization / commercial activity - now they look more like terrorists with their routine kills on caucasus , jailing random protesters for protesting , `` not invading '' ukraine . 
  i 'm sure we 'll see much worse examples in the nearest future - like abducting , torturing and killing foreign citizens for imaginable crimes just like it happens with rufed citizens for years ... oh , wait , nevermind - this is happening already . 
  for russia ukraine is ( was ) extremely important - their assimilation into customs union was the main goal of foreign policy . 
  ukraine 's break up with russia means putin 's ussr restoration doctrine and foreign policy have failed miserably - if even closest `` slavic brothers '' do n't want to join his games then nobody should do it . 
  plus ukraine has substantial export/import operations with eu and china . 
  she was captured by `` self-defenders '' of `` luganda '' ( or `` donbabwe '' ? ), 
  - there were multiple news reports in russia about her , and now it should be obvious to everyone her attempt to cross the border is yet another lie by fsb/government / `` journalists '' . 
  just like terrorism accusations against ukrainian/crimean movie maker oleg sentsov . 
  russian media are dead silent about it . 
  edit : correction : now they are broadcasting ( fsb 's ? ), 
  `` version '' : she tried to enter russia as refugee and was detained . 
  this bank note is available for like 15 + years already and one need magnification glass to see statue 's penis . 
  it 's just an obvious attempt to troll and distract population from `` putin is giving up promised land / novorossia / eastern ukraine + russians who live there to euro-gays , jew-nazis and maidano-fascists '' situation . 
  and somehow i 'm sure it will be 100 % successful because there are no people to ask questions . 
  let me ask you : what would you do if kremlin actually give up siberia to china ? 
  do you really think locals will be capable to resist chinese army ? 
  russian regions do n't have local armies ( except for chechnya ) and are incapable to defend themselves from anything let alone against huge army with 2000 + years of experience in suppressing of local revolts . 
   majority of our population majority of population does n't give a crap about anything except for their own wallet . 
  if government will offer tax break or small sums of money in exchange for a territory nobody but couple millions locals have seen - i bet everyone will be more than happy to give it up for few hundreds bucks . 
  just like it happened with whole rufed during privatization 20 years ago when politburo and their pocket oligarchs became the owners of gazprom , lukoil , railroads , aeroflot and other `` natural monopolies '' while population was distracted with vouchers . 
  kremlin already said '' +1 million population '' for far east and somehow i am sure these wo n't be migrants from moscow or spb and surely actual number will be much higher than official . 
  content of the document means russia has replaced iran and bin laden for us as their enemy number one . 
  or at least it is * very * close to this position . 
  can not claim refuge status in russia because there is no military activity in abkhazia according to officials . 
  unofficially half of my family was killed there by abkhazians and chechens - nobody cared to actually protect russians , you can ( well , could ) see empty houses everywhere with naive signs `` russians live here '' - as if they could protect the tenants instead of turning them into targets . 
   i suppose in russia the internal passports date to serfdom ? 
  most likely - yes . 
  in ussr villagers were technically serfs till 1964 ( or 1961 ) and could n't go anywhere at all - thus state still use archaic passportisation feature and endless paper checks are being performed in every state organization ( it is literally papers check - similar organizations in different regions do n't have connected databases as if they were in separate states / countries ) . 
  still these passports came in handy when ussr felt apart : suddenly people with exactly the same passports ( but different ink marks in them ) became citizens of completely different countries , without issuing any new documents . 
  de-facto it 's a zone of military conflict and has good potential for terrorist / `` freedom fighters '' activity so there is a lot of military and fsb personnel accompanied by excessive security measures and higher criminal activity due to lack of properly functioning police which is being re-structured from ukrainian to russian `` business processes '' . 
  not so fast . 
  there is a chance fsb wo n't let me out due to lack of proper papers issued by this state , 
  i bet kremlin wants/prefer to see crimeans fleeing to other regions due to lack of water , electricity , food , money - rather than spending more billions onto their support . 
  visa free volatile region is the best possible medium for terrorism while russia itself has limited amount of tourists most of whom already can visit sochi , anapa , gelendzhik which do n't have said problems with water , food , electricity - and spetsnaz . 
  it look like usa are going to boost nato substantially , help ukraine to rebuild army + isolate ( and therefore destroy ) russia 's state financial and petrochemical companies . 
  i guess it will be pretty easy since kremlin has foolishly centralized ( if not monopolized ) banking and petrochemical business within handful of companies . 
  having troubles with the passport - `` swiss-georgian '' consulate work as if they were besieged ( it 's not far from reality ) . 
  i 've already decided if i wo n't get the passport during this or next week i 'll depart without any documents and will try to get them either in belarus or in kazakhstan . 
  i meant - us purchased alaska from russia . 
  and alaska is n't a wasteland - there is a lot of natural resources afaik - and that 's besides control over strategic bering strait which could be russian monopoly . 
  most russians never travel and do n't have any other sources of national pride other than tv propaganda . 
  a bit of certain propaganda - and 80 % will be ok with any sale , opinion of 20 % will be suppressed - just like it is happening right now with annexation of crimea . 
   there 's far too much national pride involved for russia to ever peaceably handover siberia [ pride russians are giving up 337 square kilometers to china ] ( http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.contrtv.ru%2fevents%2f95%2f&amp;sandbox=1 ) . 
  as usian you should know russia has rich experience of selling their own territories . 
  it will take billions and years to construct + it can be destroyed by a single missile or explosion ( i 'm sure ukrainian army will have powerful missile divisions in couple years - they are capable to build icbms and space rockets ) . 
  frankly i do n't see any points in this investment others than stealing billions by mr. putin & co : most likely rufed will fall apart before this investment will be returned in any form . 
  ** russia ** , government looks scared actually there was no news during this week - except for helicopter crash during landing ( 14 people - everyone - survived ) + government accepted law to cut off all sites with users registration outside or rufed borders : it seems like an embryo of group of laws to cut off whole country from the outer world and forbid usd/eur/rur exchange , chinese style + us is about to accept new doctrine [ to prevent aggression of russia in europe and asia ] ( https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2277/text ) . 
  some speculations : rufed 's government simply shut up after this law was passed to us senate - it look like they are really scared now . 
  or want us to think so . 
  probably they 've understood they 've turned themselves into iconic enemy of the west which was `` in demand '' after death of bin laden and pacification of iran by severe economic sanctions . 
  and it seems government has gave up an idea to occupy eastern ukraine , effectively turning annexed crimea into useless piece of land without access to mainland russia ( so ukrainian government may dictate price of water , electricity , food ) - russian bureaucrat has declared [ conflict in ukraine will be stopped in few weeks ] ( http://russian.rt.com/article/39492 ) . 
  russia already de-facto consist of different states . 
  authorities treat migrating population as if it was from different countries ( i did n't heard anything like us citizens need passports and work permits when they cross borders between states ) . 
  thanks for the explanation !, 
  although i 've used `` russian country '' intentionally - some of the regions differ so much they could be different countries as well ( example : chechnya is demanding legitimization of polygamy ) . 
  1 ) i 've never seen police posts like that anywhere but on state borders and in war zones . 
  especially - posts where random people and cars are being searched without any particular reason ; 2 ) same `` police post '' suddenly appeared in ussr in the end of 80s on the border between abkhazia and russia . 
  back when everyone said `` well , it 's just a police post to block criminals '' - and you probably know what has happened later . 
  not sure . 
  for me de-facto there is no country , just a bunch of semi-independent weak colonies with a gang in kremlin which deceive people to convince them they are a single nation . 
  but it seems nobody but russians believe in it , caucasians are revolting and fsb is killing them daily + kremlin pay multi-billion annual bribe ( or tribute ) to chechnya to stay within rufed borders since rufed had lost two wars to them . 
  check [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_42ojxwrl6i ) - this is `` customs post '' within country 's borders ( between krasnodar and rostov-on-don regions ) . 
  it 's the reason why i never travel to sochi in a car - with moscow license plate i had guaranteed `` fun times '' on this post , up to 1 hour + 3-4 stops and searches by local police after this post . 
  it is indeed old soviet law . 
  however in modern russia it became even worse : there are real customs checks * within * country 's borders - including strip search . 
  for example it 's being done on the border between krasnodar ( ex-olympic region ) and rostov-on-don for like 15 years already . 
  right now checks are selective , if a car has children inside or local license plate then most likely it 'll pass without check , however if there is a male in a car with license plate from another `` russian country '' ( moscow for example ) or - even worse - group of youth - then `` fun '' times are guaranteed . 
  here is [ video with this `` customs post '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_42ojxwrl6i ) . 
   russia will split into smaller states and it 's already prepared for that : to move between regions / cities people have to have passports + to get a job in new place they have to get work permits / visas from local police a.k.a. 
  there are only 4 systems to book airplane tickets in the world ( all sites and travel agencies work through them ) , none of them consider creation of local servers afaik . 
  it will result in inability for russians ( including bureaucrats ) to reserve hotels , airplane tickets , use gmail , appstore , android store , itunes , facebook ( probably twitter and youtube too ) - just anything that requires credit card numbers and emails . 
  so far this is the most idiotic idea of putin 's government . 
  it 's like they are preparing to cut off all ties with the world , north korean style - apparently it 's being done to prevent treason among the bureaucrats . 
  ** russia ** : we are special nation ( possible with some mission from god ) and we have to find our special ways to do common things instead of just doing them . 
  we are not afraid of anything but our government - because they 'll shoot and use nukes on us ( in fact this is true : government is already killing rufed citizens on caucasus - daily ) . 
  usa and west are our enemy , let 's watch more of their movies , listen to their music and possibly immigrate there asap unless we feel ourselves too dumb or lazy to do so - in this case we use proverb '' \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f - [ \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e ] \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f '' ( `` you are [ only ] useful where you were born '' ) . 
  we are great , independent , proud , standalone nation with thousand ( s ) years of history ... let 's check us news !, 
  ( it 's like anti-fascists do n't have any meaning and can not exist without fascists - our nation is `` anti-us-ist '' ) if your country is poor and hate us - your government is a friend of our government and eligible for multi-billion gifts ( i suspect parts of these `` gifts '' are being returned to our government as `` otkat '' / '' \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0442 '' - probably that 's how we are getting `` nobody 's '' 20bil euros cash stashes in our airports ) . 
  we can abuse our family any time we want , nobody has a right to stop us . 
  ex-ussr people are our family . 
  our bureaucracy is corrupted , they steal all the money - let 's become a part of them ( i 'd say this is the closest thing to `` russian dream '' / `` national idea '' ) .

   voting please , do . 
  in your country it means a lot - unlike here . 
  and if anyone can change anything here in russia - it 's more likely you rather than me . 
  anyway all these talks `` we do n't want to harm ourselves and russia '' are implying russia is normal state . 
  however there is no lawmaking system , there are no courts , there is zero to none financing of roads building , medicine , education , there is no free speech - russia is an army . 
  as long as kremlin will have money above survival limit it 'll use them to buy more tanks and invade more countries . 
  example : literally yesterday we had news how economy has entered recession + kremlin is boosting military budget while cutting everything else but pensions . 
  your commercial interests in russia are used to finance guerrilla operations in eastern ukraine right now - and who knows there it 'll happen next time and when it 'll stop unless * you * do something to stop it ? 
   more sanctions would n't do anything for me it looks like iran is now much calmer than it was 3 years ago before sanctions hit them . 
   start violence you 've missed the part there russia is already involved in 2 wars on caucasus , one in moldova and one in ukraine . 
  russians started violence 22 years ago in abkhazia and it does n't get any better - exactly the opposite - we are already invading bigger ( but weak ) countries . 
  next logical step would be to invade bigger and stronger country . 
   things change but not all : italia support kremlin - which has fascist ideology .
