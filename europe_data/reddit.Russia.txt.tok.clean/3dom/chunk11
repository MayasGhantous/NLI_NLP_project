  `` support '' because present sanctions look more like disguised support rather than punishment . 
   russia does n't need europe yes , it does . 
  huge part of food is imported + nearly all medical equipment , major part of drugs , cars , industrial equipment . 
  chinese export can not replace these . 
  cut off supplies and there will be weakened and cooperative state ( check iran ) . 
  what will happen if eu ( + others ) wo n't destroy kremlin ? 
  aggressive fascist state with nukes , experience and desire to invade nearby countries . 
  good luck dealing with its developed version 20 years later . 
  i did n't mean to use sarcasm and especially - to offend anyone - i just compiled two facts : 1 ) benito mussolini and 2 ) russia has [ state capitalism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_capitalism ) / state socialism economical formation ( mussolini was its fan ) with distinctive features of fascism - aggressive nationalist ideology , suppressed workers unions and public political activity , jailing and killing political opponents , etc. 
  - nearly everything that wikipedia article has about fascism . 
  it is actually painful to see western governments still support this regime after it occupied 5 territories of georgia , moldova , ukraine as if these countries deserve to be occupied and 4 suppressed wars within european `` borders '' means nothing but a minor distraction which can be neglected if russia is pumping gas and oil . 
  not a war - but more economical and political pressure . 
  present sanctions are a joke and wo n't change militaristic/imperialistic doctrine of kremlin . 
  even successful people now [ flee from this country ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/04/07/2014/934549.shtml ) ( article in russian ) while eu is trying to minimize its losses / sanctions instead of preventing development of fascist state with thermonuclear weapons . 
  it 's very interesting to hear russians are now one people with [ polygamous chechens ] ( http://eea-esem2011oslo.org/necessarily-change-the-legislation-v-is-any ) and buriats to whom kremlin has deprived the [ visit of their highest religious leader - dalai lama ] ( http://blogs.voanews.com/russia-watch/2011/07/12/why-cant-the-dalai-lama-visit-russia/ ) . 
  it seems / u/kistoul does n't know there are [ 100 + thousands refugees from russia * today * ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sm.pop.refg.or?order=wbapi_data_value_2012+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=desc ) , not 15 years ago . 
  apparently this is the kind of people who can see an identity within rufed 's border - uninformed or those who are trying to ignore reality intentionally . 
   identity i would n't recommend to visit southern region of this `` identity '' because amount of refugees from the country says there is on-going war happening within the `` identity '' - there are way to many people who can not see anything in common between russians , chechens , buriats , tatars , dagestani , etc. 
  and fsb is trying to convince them by killing people on daily basis . 
  color me unsurprised : italia has rich history of supporting fascists . 
  crimean campaign already ruined status quo which was established since 1945 ( nobody annex anything ) , annexation of +2 regions would make situation even worse - especially for us/uk who were watchdogs of post-wwii world order . 
  this situation has good potential to destabilize whole world and result in ww3 . 
  russia does not want neither abkhazia nor south ossetia ( not at the cost of more sanctions ) because they are useless and empty territories without any strategic advantages for their owner - except for possibility to troll georgia . 
  these territories can not become states because so is practically deserted ( 20-30k people ) , and ~ 100k abkhazians ( +100 k armenians/georgians ) are incapable to create and sustain a state - thus they demand to join rufed de-jure , de-facto it happened 22 years ago . 
  people there are just tired to be in suspended state for decades .

  i 've forgot to mention the reason - why the government look embarassed ? 
  - and / u/adinadin [ reminded me about it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/29dw2p/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_29062014/cikaxiy ) : government has wasted 7-8 billions usd ( i.e. 
  everything ) from pension funds of citizens onto crimea and it seems they have no clue how to return the money ? 
  meanwhile moody 's has changed prognosis for kremlin 's credit rating to `` negative '' and in fact it look like kremlin is running out of money sooner than expected . 
  i will be more than happy to see georgia , ukraine , moldova joining eu ( and nato ) . 
  i 'm looking forward for these countries joining eu . 
  ** russia ** , we are getting ready for more sanctions * russia-eu [ gas pipe was bombed on ukrainian territory ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/incidents/17/06/2014/930795.shtml ) ; * multiple cases of shooting on the border between russia and ukraine [ including episode which look like ukrainian rebels ( who are supposed to be pro-russian ) shot at russian border guards ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/incidents/22/06/2014/931791.shtml ) because russian border guards helped fleeing ukrainian border guards ; * it seems [ russian army has returned to ukrainian border ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/18/06/2014/931141.shtml ) + * putin & co declared [ it 's possible to use the army to protect people in donetsk and slavyansk regions ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/22/06/2014/931776.shtml ) ( on ukrainian territory ) - rhetoric was so serious i 've expected invasion to begin couple days ago because * there is [ massive maneuvering happening in central region ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/22/06/2014/931764.shtml ) - officially 65000 troops are going to siberia , but i would n't be surprised if `` siberia '' means `` donetsk '' in official kremlin language ; * `` russian '' company megaphone ( cell network ) won [ cannes lion in `` innovation '' category for megafaces project ] ( http://winners.canneslions.com/2014/innovation/ ) ( quotes are used because company is registered in off-shore - just like almost every big business here ) ; * it seems [ visa is going to close their office in russia ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/17/06/2014/930845.shtml ) , they do n't want to pay `` security deposit '' equal to their annual income in the country , it look like personal vengeance of mr. putin for us/eu sanctions against `` not his '' banks : even the government itself is n't happy with the idea of visa/mc closing their offices ; * [ australia has implemented sanctions against russia ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/19/06/2014/931183.shtml ) , no more kangaroo meat in the stores =(,

  btw driver license in russia is called `` driver 's rights '' ( and people drive around for years w/o `` rights '' ) . 
  only one big social structure does not benefit from opposition : army . 
  no opposition - nobody question stupid and suicidal orders . 
  it look like the government is turning whole nation into an army - slowly but steadily . 
  says representative of the government which enticed and supported ethnic conflicts in abkhazia , south ossetia , moldova . 
  article in russian - [ there is diplomatic scandal ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/20140615153229.shtml ) around the embassy . 
  there is new word to describe present russian regime ( a.k.a. 
  fascism ) - '' \u0440\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0437\u043c '' ( russia + '' - ism '' ) - so swastikas seems logical . 
  or maybe a trade as a sign of actually independent ( from russia ) political will : you confirm we are independent and we 'll do the same for you . 
  chechnya is being paid for staying in russia de-jure and considering possible sanctions against russia they can become independent very soon - as soon as kremlin wo n't have spare money to purchase their `` loyalty '' . 
  not really . 
  personally i do n't see any reasons to bother studying made up `` history '' of temporary state which was n't here 20 years ago and most likely wo n't be here 20 years later - or maybe sooner as it is transforming into `` eurasian union '' . 
  ** russia ** , your sanctions can not prevent us from not invading ukraine * [ nato accused kremlin in delivery of 3 unmarked t-64 battle tanks ] ( http://aco.nato.int/statement-on-russian-main-battle-tanks.aspx ) to ukrainian rebels ( most likely those are ukrainian tanks seized by russian troops in crimea and transported to eastern ukraine through russia ) .

  authors are russian living in us and ukrainian programmer living in russia . 
  check the paragraph about fsb officers stealing the book they were supposed to guard . 
  system is barely holding in one piece , people are ready to sell just anything . 
  another example : my neighbor has finished academy ( 5 years ! ),

  no wonder government does n't allow them ( and other bureaucrats ) to leave the country - they 'd sell themselves to foreign intelligence immediately ; * after abkhazian initiatives ( see news from previous week ) south ossetia is also [ considering joining russia ] ( http://izvestia.ru/news/571806 ) ; * musician ( `` gangsta rapper '' zhigan ) is [ sentenced for robbery ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/20140603172353.shtml ) ; * [ helicopter with local bureaucrats has crashed into lake ] ( http://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/1682892.html ) , 16 perished , 2 survived ( no dashcam video , it happened too far from roads , sorry ) ; * pavel durov has started court case in us against his ex co-owners of vkontakte social network , [ he demand to return control on telegram messenger ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/02/06/2014/927621.shtml ) + 2 more companies which were ( allegedly ) fraudulently acquired by the company from nominal director . 
  note : these `` oil bandits '' ( as durov called them ) are most likely linked to fsb and igor sechin , sanctioned bureaucrat in putin 's government ; * yesterday putin has said locals have to decide on referendum if they want to rename volgograd back into stalingrad , today his [ secretary says putin did not propose to rename volgograd into stalingrad ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/06/06/2014/929157.shtml ) ; * old but good ( and new to me ) : ministry of defense in russia has issued `` for retaking crimea '' medal with dates '' [ 20.02.2014 - 16.03-2014 ] ( http://news.bigmir.net/ukraine/810912-foto-medali--za-vozvracshenie-kryma--vyzvali-skandal ) '' . 
  however exactly nothing happened in crimea during february , 20 - it 's the date of mass sniper shooting on maidan . 
  it look like ministry of defense admitted those snipers were actually russian spetsnaz . 
  at least it was less despotic/authoritarian than post-horde russia . 
  for example there was `` veche '' ( direct democracy ) institution which later became no-no in russia . 
  today people here are getting jail terms for attempts to gather in public places for political discussions - it 's `` funny '' how rufed is less developed ( as democracy ) than kievan rus was one thousand years ago . 
  yes , that was surprising . 
  it turns out kremlin has less `` friends '' than expected . 
  you are the first who had noticed . 
  or at least - who notified s/he noticed , 
  country is typical `` asian '' despotic state . 
  true successor of golden horde rather than liberal/democratic kievan rus ( as kremlin ideologists try to deceive population to think - to explain attempts to snatch ukrainian territories ) . 
  putin is already described in sci-fi book as the cause of russia 's upcoming fall ( `` telluria '' by sorokin ) . 
  people do n't like idea to support alien cultures/economies when their own infrastructure is in awful conditions ( horrible roads , bad police/medic/education services , poorly designed economy ) . 
  country is n't a single entity / nation ( russians and chechens ? 
  ) , adding more to the mix make it less stable . 
  problem is - it seems russians are incapable to revolt . 
  at least without foreign help . 
  no , it 's in russian only . 
  here is the [ article on rbc ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/29/05/2014/927223.shtml ) - i 've forgot to link it . 
  rbc is one of those potential `` foreign agents '' . 
  list of ex-russian companies includes luxoft , wargaming , and i 'd add virtuozzo ( it was created by russians in singapore ) . 
  also telegram is created by russian but now its future is questionable since it was stolen from owner by `` oil bandits '' as durov called them ( company seems to be affiliated with igor sechin - putin 's colleague ) . 
  it 's a part of russian culture and a basement of russian expansionism - that 's how people created biggest country in the world . 
  they 've fled from the state based on golden horde . 
  those parts of europe does not demand cheaper russian oil to resell it ... 
  from all possible terms authors adopted the most sexist variant as if courage is against nature of women .
