  almost forgot : moscow has [ lost its grip on quasi-state of abkhazia ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/01/06/2014/927600.shtml ) , locals revolted and now demand to join russia because they do n't want to be a pawn in kremlin 's `` cat vs mouse '' game with georgia anymore . 
  couple of kremlin 's figures ( nurgaliev and surkov-dudaev ) had to negotiate with abkhazians to restore status quo in which abkhazia is `` independent state '' and to prevent situation when russia may be accused in yet another annexation after recent crimean campaign and on-going conflict in eastern ukraine . 
  i 've forgot to explain real reason behind situation in abkhazia : it 's all about money from tourists . 
  russia had very limited amount of resorts ( sochi + couple towns nearby ) and abkhazia was inexpensive alternative off-shore resort for russians - along with crimea , but it was slightly less expensive than crimea and had shitty tourist services ( `` services '' included various crimes - up to armed robberies in the center of towns during day time ) . 
  however now situation has changed dramatically and crimea becomes much less expensive ( i 'd say `` more inexpensive '' ) and has better services so abkhazia is out of the game with their non-existent quality of services and somewhat high prices ( they are higher than in thailand and goa for example ) . 
  so they 've faced situation where they 'll have no money from tourists - and revolted to join russia to become more attractive as resort ( for example prices in sochi - which is right at the abkhzian border - are comparable to best european resorts ) . 
  problem for them is - they are needed for kremlin only as part of georgia - and it 's still persist , kremlin can not afford yet another annexation . 
  not at the moment . 
  economic union ? 
  more like charity : belarus is so ineffective it had to adopt serfdom , now russia has to feed few more millions people . 
  i 'm not familiar with d3.ru at all . 
  what flag would you suggest for a russian living in russia ? 
  into life support system of stillborn regimes . 
  belarus adopted serfdom recently , tajikistan 's per capita gdp is comparable to ethiopia and north korea . 
  this union is just juridical legitimization of reality in which russia is already sinking billions into belarus and - stans without getting anything but temporary `` friends '' in return . 
  can not really use `` russia '' term instead of `` kievan rus '' : russia is more like synonym of `` russian empire '' which appeared later . 
  `` kievan rus '' is more like `` ukraine '' now since ua is separate state now and its territory contain most of the kievan rus territory ( which never included moscow by the way - they were rival states ) . 
  ~ 2 millions georgians living in russian federation did n't go anywhere - perhaps they might help you to heal the wound in your heart left by georgia 's territory departure from ussr/cis . 
  maybe you are correct ( austria is poor ? ), 
  - except for one thing : nazi germany will not be restored - unlike neoussr which was n't actually defeated , it just took 20 years break to privatize country . 
  they are definitely joining ( armenia ) - formally without karabakh ( informally there is no actual state border between armenia and karabakh so it will be in eurasian union de-facto ) . 
  russia is n't `` too poor '' , but `` neoussr '' with joined armenia and - stans definitely will be poor ( er ) - all of them have zero to none per capita gdp , 50 % of tajikistan 's gdp are money coming from its migrant workers in russia . 
  almost 80 % of ussr 's territory restored . 
  add few more - stans , unite armies - and it will be almost the same country : huge , poor , corrupted , aggressive and armed to the teeth . 
  i mean - more poor and corrupted than rufed now . 
  and most likely more aggressive too . 
  because 1 ) if it was profitable to extract that gas then ukraine would n't buy it from russia ( or at least they would extract it ) and 2 ) it look like obvious attempt of kremlin propagandists to persuade public that donbass is valuable and worth fighting for . 
  prevalent opinion about it in russia atm - it 's worthless , its coal ( and other natural resources ) cost pennies + propagandists are trying to discredit nato/ua/us / eu as if they were fighting for monetary reasons while rebels fight for some ideals ( instead of putin 's personal ambitions which alienated ukraine , destroyed cis , united `` golden billion '' against russia ) . 
  freight cart had one of its details positioned incorrectly during loading process and during turn freight cart has leaned too far and struck passenger train . 
  now state railroad company is checking 14000 carts for the same `` defect '' ( it was n't actual defect - cart construction allow this detail positioning afaik ) . 
  that should work too - i did n't check though , i do n't smoke . 
  not likely . 
  even very stupid government wo n't just throw away $ 550bil business because it will cause serious problems in banking and retail . 
  not until they 'll have a very good replacement and i doubt credit card processing company can be created in less than 1.5 + years . 
  plus in russia state-run commercial projects tend to fail miserably ( unless it 's something simple like excavating free resources from earth ) so most likely visa and mc will stay here forever . 
   it is a nasty and expensive habit i know , i quit smoking in 6 - after blood transfusion and intensive care unit for couple days , 
   never become what was once i hope so . 
  country had slavery till 1861 - and slaves were n't imported ... 
  ** russia ** , no news = goods news * government has signed [ gas contract with china ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/21/05/2014/925265.shtml ) and price was so low they are ashamed to publish it . 
  calculated price is 8 % below prices for eu ( 350 vs 380 ) + considering substantial sum will be `` paid '' as investments into infrastructure ( china will help to build pipes ) this deal does n't look good for russia at all . 
  i guess government is desperately trying to find any money they can in case if eu will stop buying gas . 
  congratulations , china !, 
  ( + perhaps eu should consider paying less for the gas ) * most expensive divorce in history happened : swiss court divorced billionaire rybolovlev and now [ he owes $ 3bil to ex-wife ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/19/05/2014/924700.shtml ) ; * freight train [ ripped apart passenger cart in another train ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/photoreport/20/05/2014/924931/9.shtml ) , accident resulted in multiple deaths ; * government almost shot itself in the foot by asking visa and mc to insure their operations in russia by providing their ~ 5 years income as security deposit , visa and mc ( their annual turnover in russia is ~ 550,000,000,000 usd ) [ said they are ready to depart ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/20/05/2014/924892.shtml ) from the country , now [ government is asking them to stay ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/23/05/2014/925775.shtml ) ; * government want to [ implant rfid chips in fur coats ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/21/05/2014/925365.shtml ) to prevent contraband / grey import . 
  note : under putin 's rule biggest country in the world is incapable to produce its own quality fur coats , 95 % of them are imported and nearly 80 % of import is illegal - because customs ( fsb ) are corrupted . 
  i wonder - who is the brilliant person who thinks these small chips may force fsb to stop accepting bribes ? 
  i guess he 's co-owner of distributor of rfid chips in russia . 
  * russia became 10th country in the world where [ displaying cigarettes in shops is prohibited ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/21/05/2014/925357.shtml ) .

  ) ; * [ lifenews reporters were caught in ukraine with anti-air missile launcher in the trunk of their car ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/20/05/2014/924847.shtml ) . 
  kadyrov [ went to ukraine to liberate them ] ( http://ria.ru/world/20140525/1009204703.html ) , i guess he has huge experience in criminal negotiations . 
  note : ukrainian authorities do n't like pro-kremlin lifenews , it could be a setup - however kremlin 's interference ( kadyrov 's voyage ) says they were really fsb agents because this government does not care about `` average people '' , at least not to extent where they personally go to another country for negotiations about couple strangers accused in help to terrorists / rebels / freedom fighters / whatever ; * in the small town where i live ( 100k population , 20km from moscow ) a migrant worker killed football fan during brawl , funerals turned first into protests , then [ violence ensued ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/photoreport/16/05/2014/924142.shtml ) . 
  ~ 60 arrested , migrants fled to nearby towns , authorities closed market where incident has happened , nothing changed actually . 
  normal day in russia . 
  in swiss consulate . 
  georgia does not have official representatives in russia . 
  i do n't have georgian passport - going to get it ( if/when they 'll provide citizenship ) . 
  and why should i move to a country which is practically a war zone and the rest of its territory can be annexed by russia any day ? 
  ( just like it had happened with my `` semi-native '' abkhazia ) because of piece of paper ? 
  strange logic . 
  georgian passport is fine for ukraine ( also kazakhstan , turkey , israel , belarus , etc. ), 
  - and hopefully will work for whole eu soon ( unless russia will occupy georgia before it will join eu and nato ) . 
  thank you !, 
  i hope i 'll be able to write a book about my exodus . 
  in kazakhstan i 'll be legal with georgian passport . 
  in russia i need entry visa - which can not be obtained within the country ( legally , illegally it cost $ 1k with `` overnight delivery '' - but it may become even more problematic because it will be obvious i could n't get it legally ) . 
  thanks !, 
  i expect it will be a great adventure . 
  ca n't just pick up destination country and say `` hello !, 
  let me live and work here '' - visas , borders , bureaucracy , etc. 
  takes years to complete for eu and english commonwealth . 
  and i was n't prepared for the freaken war and instant descent of russia into iran-like state . 
  so i 'll have to live in ukraine for some time before moving elsewhere ( it seems to be the only place where i can work legally without years of paperwork in advance ) . 
  thank you !, 
  i was born in the republic which became russian federation later ( my parents are rufed citizens ) . 
  but at the moment of the fall i was in abkhazia which instantly became a war zone ( russia created the same scenario as in eastern ukraine right now ) - so it seems i became georgian citizen despite fact i have never been in georgia . 
  everyone keep forgetting putin ( and country ) does not fear weak economy : he got it in awful state just 2 years after default ( people did not receive salaries and pensions for months and years back then ) and managed to improve it a lot ( and oil was cheap in early 00s ) . 
  somehow i believe he may be able to rebuild economy to work under sanctions - maybe even without oil and gas sales . 
  surely it will be worse - but still better than it was in 90s ( and russians did not riot then - only chechens did ) . 
  there was something more concrete than abstract numbers . 
  either belarus =  ukraine =  ? 
  or kazakhstan =  ukraine =  ? 
  i do n't have proper set of papers to travel normally , can not acquire russian citizenship since ussr fall , other citizenship will make me an illegal alien . 
  hence `` special procedure '' required to get out . 
  of course i know about his background . 
  however there is stereotype : every swiss person is perceived here either a banker or manufacturer of watches ( or chocolate ) . 
  and actually it look like the guy has used some really strong arguments during meeting ( putin was noticeably tired in tv news + had to mumble exactly the opposite to his doctrine and to his own opinion from a day before ) - apparently argument was n't about watches or chocolate ( and not osce stuff ) . 
  so conspiracy theory about money involvement confirming `` the banker '' stereotype . 
  my guess - he promised swiss wo n't protect putin 's personal accounts from possible us sanctions ( or maybe even they 've frozen them already - unofficially ) . 
  finishing my stuff in next two weeks and getting out of the country - probably through kazakhstan since belorussia is too close to conflict zone and there are elevated security measures . 
  so far i did n't hear anything about fatca analog in eu . 
  did they save the swan ?
