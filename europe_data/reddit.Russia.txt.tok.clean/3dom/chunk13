  to compare : during 2008 crisis economy lost ~ 90b euro ; * pro-government organization ( some call them `` putlerjugend '' ) [ displayed giant banner with list of `` fifth column activists '' in moscow ] ( http://grani.ru/politics/russia/m.228750.html ) . 
  list includes popular musicians , writers , politics , journalists who are against conflict with ukraine - i. e. real patriots who are not ( yet ) afraid to speak openly ; * 62 years old provincial deputy is [ accused in ** 212 ** cases of rape of minors ] ( http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2465696 ) ( girls from 11 to 17 ) . 
  obviously it was covered by local police and prosecutors - but none of them was convicted . 
  this is good illustration of fact russian state is raping russia 's population - sometimes literally . 
  plus population itself has no morale and will to resist . 
  * p.s. 
  almost forgot : kremlin had to ~ ~ bribe ~ ~ present some valuable gifts to lukashenko - again - to convince him to join customs union ( a.k.a. 
  neoussr ) - in form of 2b usd `` credit '' ( i.e. 
  free money ) and [ 1b + discounted customs tariffs ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/11/05/2014/922974.shtml ) for oil . 
  afaik belarus is simply re-selling discounted russian oil for normal prices to eu . 
  besides russia i know only one empire which paid money to its colonies instead of robbing them - byzantine . 
  it 's interesting to see kremlin is using ~ 1500 years old methods to control territory . 
  it seems putin and his entourage are ready to exploit every idea which may fool stupid part of population to follow them . 
  and stupid people are conservative - so kremlin use strange mix of ancient leftist ideas mixed with monarchy/imperialism/orthodox while they ( government ) are actually rightists/capitalists . 
  state is built on sea of lies but population is stupid enough to believe it and support it neglecting their own interests . 
  this country is n't my own and never was . 
  i always felt like i 'm unwelcome guest here , now i feel like i become an enemy of the state rather than just nuisance . 
  nah , putin do n't want to drive liberals from the country because most of them left already . 
  i 'm going to ukraine first , then somewhere else - i do n't have plans ( i.e. 
  work visas ) as i did n't have time to prepare for situation when the country is turning into something similar to iran and north korea in just couple years . 
  i 'm in the process . 
  finishing my stuff in may and getting out of here while borders are still open . 
  putin 's agenda is to restore ussr - besides saving his billions . 
  other reasons ( economy , peace , human lives ) do n't matter . 
  for russia there is no escape strategy - country is degrading into something between iran and north korea , war and western sanctions allow putin to finish this process faster using idiots who believe west is against them . 
  the same rumor . 
  in 80s there were slogans `` peace , labor , may '' ( month/celebration ) - `` peace , labor , name '' are from stalin era . 
  state under putin has degraded way faster and deeper than anyone could imagine . 
  ** russia ** , we are turning back into 20th century and communism * for the first time since 1991 there was a parade on red square on may , 1 . 
  people asked putin to enslave them using slogans like '' [ peace , labor , putin ] ( https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10202175530122133&amp;set=pcb.10202175534042231&amp;type=1&amp;theater ) '' ; * military storage exploded , 20 perished [ including 10 people who tried to escape in a truck ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/incidents/30/04/2014/921342.shtml ) ; * more sanctions from [ japan ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/29/04/2014/921078.shtml ) , [ canada ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/29/04/2014/921048.shtml ) , eu and us - they are mostly personal and according to recent polls affected only 4 % of companies in russia ; * microsoft , oracle , hp , symantec are [ joining us sanctions against russian companies ] ( http://www.gazeta.ru/business/news/2014/04/30/n_6119681.shtml ) ( banks mostly ) - this is much more serious threat to the companies than anything else ( except , maybe , blocking swift ) ; * big business ( which is practically belong to the government officials ) declared [ they are not ready to de-off-shore their financial structures despite demands from the government ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/30/04/2014/921499.shtml ) - if i had to use street slang i 'd say they 've asked government to f *** off . 
  this is a sign 1 ) how bad is infrastructure of the country for business and 2 ) government was n't ready for the situation with sanctions and can not control its own pocket companies ; * imf says [ russian economy is in recession already ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27221345 ) , russian media decorated news about it with a lot of doublespeak - like `` imf admitted russian economy is in recession '' ( as if it was imf who did something bad , not the government ) ; * putin is still trying to save face and act like a macho , says borderline idiotic phrases like '' [ we do n't want to impose sanctions against west ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/29/04/2014/921327.shtml ) '' ( i guess he mean government is seriously considering confiscation of foreign property and cutting off gas supply - these are the only things they did n't do yet ) , there are speculations and rumors if he has cancer and that is the reason for his kamikaze-like activity ; * it seems edvard snowden has finally realized staying in russia was n't a good idea and [ asked us for a deal to return ] ( http://tvrain.ru/articles/snouden_reshil_zakljuchit_sdelku_s_vlastjami_ssha-367727/ ) ( or to flee from russia ) ; * [ government continue to kill insurgents ( or freedom fighters ) routinely in caucasus region ] ( http://www.aif.ru/society/safety/1159426 ) while condemning similar actions of ukraine ; * investments of norway into russian bonds [ lost ~ 10 % of their value ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/30/04/2014/921584.shtml ) ; * fsb/customs did not allow the leader of crimean tatars - jemilev - [ to enter russia and crimea ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/03/05/2014/921768.shtml ) - again . 
  he is de-facto deported - history repeat itself ; * after libertarian founder left the company ( or more like was pushed out of business ) vkontakte social network has started to ban people over pro-ukrainian posts ( example of such posts - addressed to ukrainian users : `` before buying goods check if they are made in ukraine '' [ and not in russia ] ) ; * there are rumors [ government is considering filtration of internet traffic - north korean style ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/29/04/2014/921066.shtml ) ( not even chinese ) - on regional level , network providers are trying to convince government this idea is n't that good . 
  sorry for the rumors - with awful `` quality '' of russian news sources there is informational vacuum and it 's barely possible to differ actual news from rumors and vice versa . 
  also both government and business look lost and spread a lot of rumors and disinformation - more than usually . 
  people use their annual vacation days quota to extend labor day ( may , 1 ) + victory day ( may , 9 ) celebrations into 9 + days long vacation . 
  same happens during new year celebration - business practically stops for 2 weeks till january , 14 ( january , 13 is `` old new year '' in orthodoxal gregorian calendar ) . 
  alcohol use : unacceptable for 44 % in russia . 
  it 's still better scenario because there will be only 1 idiot to neutralize rather than 300-400 millions . 
  current bank cards will remain but they wo n't work for payments within the country unless visa and mc will agree to build processing facilities in russia ( i doubt ) . 
  tourists within russia will have to use cash , russians traveling abroad will have to use different cards ( standard visa/mc ) . 
  cossacks were tight group but not anymore after stalin 's purges . 
  even though many people in southern russia consider themselves `` ethnic cossacks '' it does n't matter anything - because the same people identify themselves as russians , ukrainians , poles . 
  cossacks are more like borderline ( il ) legal social club now . 
  civil war will be much less harmful than wwiii . 
  to prevent unrest and involvement of both turkey and tatarstan . 
  tatars are n't happy with crimean situation , they are n't cooperative and they can be organized into substantial force . 
  russian government does n't like this situation : they remember 25k bolsheviks were enough to overthrow tsar in 1917 . 
  i did n't hear anything about tatars . 
  most likely they are ( relatively ) fine because otherwise big tatarstan region may be upset and federal government do n't want that happen . 
  he was n't technically deported - customs prohibit him to enter crimea/russia after he left the region . 
  i used the term to remind about deportation in 1944 . 
  senator mizulina suggested to create library of images and videos for special services ( police , fsb , judges ) to use against criminals . 
  however in russia everything is being abused and i wo n't be surprised if this database will be available for sale ( besides fact it will be used by bureaucrats for `` personal '' needs ) ... 
  i think officials still have too much money and property in eu/us and need few more weeks to sell houses and transfer money into russia - thus they need a pause . 
  ** russia ** , government is killing the economy more efficiently than any us/eu sanctions * [ senator has offered to create database of child porn ] ( http://izvestia.ru/news/569594 ) - to fight it more efficiently ( meaning it will be ok to watch child porn for government officials on this website / database ) ; * senator glazyev has offered to `` de-usd/de-euro '' russian economy , ex-minister of finances kudrin said it will be more devastating than any sanctions us and eu could impose ; * [ founder of vkontacte social network resigned from official position in the company ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/21/04/2014/919473.shtml ) citing pressure from one of two shareholders + named sanctioned government official igor sechin as the source of problems ; * [ leader of crimean tatar community is de-facto deported ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/22/04/2014/919651.shtml ) from the region ( and russia ) , later this week he was nominated for nobel peace prize ; * senate declared [ all bloggers ( including twitter users ) with more than 3k daily visitors are media agencies and have to reveal their identities ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/22/04/2014/919742.shtml ) , [ livejournal is shutting down its blog rating ] ( http://www.forbes.ru/news/255681-livejournal-zakryl-svoi-reiting-blogov ) to prevent its abuse by russian government ( yandex did the same during last week ) ; * president 's human right committee [ is asking to block the law about bloggers ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/23/04/2014/919967.shtml ) ; * standards & poor agency has [ degraded credit rating ] ( http://www.forbes.ru/news/255823-mezhdunarodnoe-agentstvo-sp-ponizilo-reiting-rossii ) of russia , [ government is still trying to create ( controlled ) russian rating agency ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/24/04/2014/920110.shtml ) - i guess they have a hope there will be enough stupid businessmen to take it seriously ; * putin 's `` people 's front '' organization is [ going to ~ ~ bribe ~ ~ support journalists officially ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/24/04/2014/920401.shtml ) , besides russian journalist [ government is going to spend $ 4-5bil on pr in ex-ussr countries ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/25/04/2014/920409.shtml ) ; * putin declared internet is a project by cia ( he can not see a difference between cia and darpa ) and yandex was created with foreign influence .

  russian news [ report substantial ukrainian force near slavyansk ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fria.ru%2fworld%2f20140426%2f1005594998.html&amp;sandbox=1 ) ( 160 tanks , 200 + apcs , 150 + cannons ) . 
  it may be a lie ( to initiate `` peacekeeping '' invasion ) - the same source reported water supply is stopped for crimea earlier today . 
  same reports are on russian news sites . 
  problem is there is too much lie in the news both in russia and ukraine and nobody can tell if news are true or not ? 
  for example crimean authorities may lie about water supply to prevent civil unrest . 
  ukraine has [ stopped water pumps ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.newsru.com%2fworld%2f26apr2014%2fcrimeawater.html ) citing inability of crimean ( russian ) authorities to negotiate the deal for water and electricity . 
  crimea has water reserves for 10 days ( or 30 in economical mode ) . 
  edit : there is completely different content in articles few hours later : [ ukraine did not stop water supply ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=ria.ru%2fworld%2f20140426%2f1005593208.html&amp;sandbox=1 ) . 
  dash cams are used for two reasons : 1 ) to document events because investigation is not transparent and can be easily affected with bribes ( courts do not do anything but assign severity of fines/jail terms ) - video makes bribes too high to pay in case of minor accidents ( still police can destroy videos if paid enough ) and 2 ) to prevent abuse from police itself . 
  besides dash cams a lot of drivers have either stun gun or a baseball bat . 
   is russia 's crime rate high ? 
  amount of murders per million citizens is ~ 20-25 % higher than in pakistan where you can buy weapons from small street shops . 
  crony capitalism is limited to putin 's circle and biggest companies . 
  medium sized business is in state of anarchy - up to shooting between fsb and police when they are trying to `` protect '' the same market/company/plant . 
  lately they 've learned to use courts and bureaucracy but it does n't work well because judges are corrupted and laws are too stupid to use them so for business best bet is to work in off-shore to be able to cut off all ties between their money and the country . 
  example : yandex is registered in the netherlands . 
  business does n't like putin 's regime and is ready to sabotage their work any time they find it suitable . 
  i mean that business which survived his rule and was n't `` de-privatized '' by corrupted bureaucrats like it happened with vkontacte social network which is practically belong to [ igor sechin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/igor_sechin ) now . 
  i seriously doubt kremlin is trying to attract anyone ( migrants are cheaper than citizens , there are already like 10 millions of them in the country ) . 
  they are trying to legitimize idea to hand out citizenship to millions people within eastern/southern ukraine + their relatives who already live/work in russia . 
  thanks !,

  communists are asking attorney general to strip immunity off the senator and prosecute him for criminal offense , orthodox church is asking him to repent ( zhirinovsky shouted traditional easter phrase '' \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441 '' - `` christ has resurrected '' ) , people think government is under extreme stress due to sanctions . 
  happy easter !, 
  edit : some really bad ( and fresh ) news in the end : during night there was an attack and 5 people were killed in ukrainian town slavyansk , russian ministry of foreign affairs declared it 's ukraine broke geneva treaty during easter , [ `` mayor '' of the town is asking for russian `` protective invasion '' ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/20/04/2014/919197.shtml ) . 
  ukrainians insist only russians were in the town during night . 
  before 2000s there was also \u043a\u0443\u0442\u044c\u044f - kutia - boiled wheat grains with raisins and a bit of sugar , but now it 's obsolete ( it was like porridge , but almost without any water ) . 
  communist party is asking office of attorney general to remove senator 's immunity and prosecute him . 
  journalists union is outraged - meaning they may become less cooperative with the government . 
  orthodox church is asking him to repent . 
  population think zhirinovsky gone borderline retard cause he 's old + government is stressed over sanctions , crisis in economy . 
  separatists did n't sign any deals and will continue to create unrest and cease government 's buildings . 
  however if ukrainian army will use force against them kremlin may say `` see - they are clearly braking the deal , now we * have * to stop these evil ukrainians to honor our agreement in geneva '' .
