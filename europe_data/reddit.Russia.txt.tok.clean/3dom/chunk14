  this diplomatic deal looks like obvious trap for ukraine . 
  old but good : [ all the things she said ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mgbaxplri8&amp;feature=kp ) ca n't believe it was performed 12 years ago ... 
  population of moscow and spb ) does not like that it see ( because it will result in worse economy ) , lower class does not care . 
  93 % ratings are surely propaganda - in fact almost everything here is government 's propaganda including `` information '' published by seemingly liberal media ( such as `` echo of moscow '' radio station ) . 
  sadly , most of the time i can not find news articles in english - russia today does n't translate most russian news because they are bad for the government while reuters/bbc often publish just a paragraph ( or two ) of text . 
  i feel myself ancient and very important because i remember how reddit published links to news about extinctions of dinosaurs and fall of rome . 
  it seems a lot of germans think putin is going to stop in crimea . 
  they 've purchased stock from a director who was n't authorized to sell them . 
  i mean sometimes we can and should hesitate and have doubts about reality we live in , but now it 's not the case : either we will actively oppose the invasion without second thoughts or tomorrow europe ( and russia ) will be much less comfortable to live in - with 250-millions strong neoussr reborn from the ashes . 
  ( disclaimer : this is seconds time a war is ruining my future plans so i may be overreacting ), 
  forgot to mark one in kiev . 
  here - [ check this video of well armed and trained militants making corridor for locals to throw out ukrainian flag ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xkriczcw-q#t=11 ) . 
  sometimes there is no time to wait for a well-documented court resolution and people have to use common sense to form an opinion ( and to act ) - and common sense says average ukrainian ( including `` berkut '' officers ) does n't have access to special military equipment . 
  russian is very homogenous language . 
  usage of region-specific words in different regions is unusual - especially when the rest of ex-ussr use completely different term : \u0431\u043e\u0440\u0434\u044e\u0440 ( bordyur ) . 
   had stolen a hamster .

  news about militants attacking buildings in eastern ukraine continue to [ destroy stock market in russia ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/07/04/2014/916269.shtml ) almost daily ; * google.ru show special version of maps with [ crimea as russian territory ] ( http://www.interfax.ru/world/371079 ) ; * 1 of 2 shareholders of vkontacte social network is [ demanding 10mil euro from its founder ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/07/04/2014/916267.shtml ) - because he `` spent too much '' , they 've secretly ( and illegally ) took over his other project - telegram phone app ; durov called them `` oil bandits '' some time ago , another shareholder ( usmanov / mail.ru ) is suing them for hostile takeover ; * journalist [ shenderovich has to pay 20k euro compensation ] ( http://slon.ru/fast/russia/shenderovich-zaplatit-1-mln-rubley-glave-fraktsii-edinoy-rossii-1080612.xhtml ) for `` verbal offense '' to one of the leaders of united russia party because he said politic stole ( plagiarized ) his dissertation ( and he did ) - but also that politic is controlling courts ( or whatever is left in their place ) .

  i hope government itself will join them - moscow will be much better place without hours-long traffic jams induced by government corteges . 
  latest news : it seems i 've jinxed whole situation with `` no news = good news '' phrase : during last 24 hours russia has [ moved around 50k troops near ukrainian border ] ( http://flot2017.com/item/news/59774 ) and added +20 helicopters ( up to 240 total ) ; * after armed clashes with `` self-defense '' forces where ukrainian anti-terrorism unit lost 1 officer their press secretary declared [ `` self-defense '' militants are actually well trained and armed russian spetsnaz ] ( http://glavcom.ua/news/198908.html ) ( [ video of random shooting ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xkriczcw-q#t=11 ) with well equipped `` self-defense '' forces ) ; * one of russian politics ( ex-advisor of putin , in opposition now ) says [ ukrainians have only 3 days to remove `` russian spetsnaz '' from southern/eastern regions - or russia will begin `` peacekeeping '' invasion ] ( http://aillarionov.livejournal.com/669998.html ) on ukraine 's mainland . 
  edit - correction : he says new invasion is inevitable , ukrainians may only make it smaller in scale by demonstrating force ( kherson-donetsk-dnepropetrovsk instead of whole ukraine sans western part ) . 
  according to putin rufed is still a republic of ussr , not a successor . 
  because ussr was n't disbanded legitimately and therefore is still alive . 
  yes . 
  and that means putin himself is n't legitimate because ussr still exist and rufed is not a country . 
  actually i expect they 'll declare separation of ussr republics illegal - sooner or later . 
  in russia sites are responsible for content of comments so this functionality is disabled on most news sites since shooting on maidan ( feb , 18-21 ) and crimean `` non-invasion '' . 
  there were too much illegal content - like `` ca n't wait for the same happening in moscow with putin '' , `` shoot more maidanoids '' , `` why the heck we have to feed those 2 millions crimeans ? 
  '' , `` let 's deport crimean tatars back to kazakstan '' etc. 
  there is a bright side : no more paid propaganda in comments . 
  not on russian sites at least . 
  15 here . 
  i suck with - stans + could n't click brunei from first try and had to click through all `` dot-states '' . 
  `` nor '' can be used if there was `` neither '' already . 
   why not however ? 
  because i know russians have evacuate nearly 20k people from south ossetia 2 weeks prior to august war ( process ended in the beginning of august - around august , 3 ) . 
  it 's like they knew about saakashvili 's reaction 2 weeks before he did it . 
  i 've never heard about such evacuations before and after the war . 
  surely i know about `` they have authority , they are n't fools '' argument . 
  i do n't believe it . 
  it seems nobody had taken into account it takes approximately 3 months to move russian tank army into attack position . 
  and of course saakashvili had to start shooting only after the moment when russian tanks were placed along georgian border . 
  not to mention russians have evacuated almost whole s-ossetia population starting from the end of july ( 2 weeks prior to attack ) - there was a wave of `` ossetian children are goes to sea resorts with their parents '' `` news '' in the press when i 've realized there is evacuation ( tens of thousands people were evacuated afaik - nearly half of population ) and there will be war . 
  how did russians know saakashvili is going to start shelling tskhinvali 2 weeks later ? 
  i did n't believe `` georgia shelled tskhinvali for no apparent reasons '' version for a second ( instead of `` georgia shelled advancing russian motorized regiments which were there for like 12 hours before shooting has started but russia managed to convince everyone - but georgians - there were only peacekeepers '' ) . 
  that 's why crimean situation was n't surprising for me . 
  reaction of the west ( which did n't care for georgia ) was the surprise - and it seems not only for me but for kremlin as well and sanctions caught them barely prepared . 
   after crimea it is hard to predict him for me it was pretty easy since russia `` did not invade georgia '' in 2008 . 
  we are about to see series of `` non-invasions '' - unless kremlin will go bankrupt ( and wo n't turn russia into nkorea-like economy-less nightmare first ) . 
  joining russia voluntarily during this period is n't wise - to put it mildly . 
  i could n't believe in pro-russian protests because when i was in kharkiv locals were n't even considering idea/possibility of joining russia - it was non-sesual . 
  probably because both russia and ukraine was equally poor back then . 
  also ukrainian language ( or surjik variation ) was common - there were people who spoke it exclusively . 
  also because for me `` joining russia instead of eu '' sounds totally dumb . 
  it seems government desperately need money : they 've sold ~ 100b worth us bonds ( allegedly ) and already spent at least 1/3 of the money trying to hold falling rouble , they are going to double taxes on small business and individual entrepreneurs during this year , they are going to spend the rest of `` untouchable '' part of reserves ( pension fund ) to save crimea from going bankrupt . 
  and probably this is why they are forcing companies to de-list from london/ny exchanges - in hope they 'll attract more money into the country to save kremlin 's nearly broke ass . 
  either this or they are preparing for much more severe sanctions in case of full-scale invasion into eastern ukraine . 
  perhaps they could know better if they were n't from russia . 
  ( actually i think these are either villagers or/and hired/imported mobsters - ca n't believe urban population can create pro-russian riot being just few years away from joining eu ), 
  thanks for clarification !, 
  i was in hurry creating the post and misused term `` joined '' . 
  thank you !, 
  it becomes more difficult to do : it turned out most of news sites re-used content from lenta.ru previously , often indirectly - through each other or simply by focusing on the same theme as lenta.ru . 
  without it there is not enough information around . 
  state-run media are lying non-stop and quoting state-sponsored lunatics ( `` 92 % of japanese think ussr bombed hiroshima '' ) , private companies re-broadcast this crap mixed with actual news and there is no way to tell which news are real and important . 
  now i have to rely on foreign sites and bloggers to find news within russia . 
  nah , i 'm kidding , people are n't leaving country fast enough for government to worry . 
  it 's just replacing locals with migrants where possible : state capitalism requires cheaper workforce , locals are much more expensive than population of - stans . 
  they are gangsters who have to protect their stolen fortunes and use lunatics for pr . 
  yes . 
  government is following `` rule '' '' \u0431\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0447\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u044f\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c '' ( beat your people to make others afraid ) and is ready to shoot itself in the foot just to piss off everyone around . 
  it could be his revenge disguised as a `` joke '' : one of two vkontakte investors has pushed him out of business and he had to sell his 12 % stake in the company .

  dear mods , i am disappoint , europe is supposed to be progressive . 
  i have soviet ( or chinese ? ), 
  flair . 
  it 's interesting : this is exactly how i feel . 
  edit : with one correction : in 80s ussr was more logical and less corrupted state than russian federation atm . 
  most people here see scotland , ireland and england + wales as the same country and culture . 
  gun ownership laws in russia are fine ( i.e. 
  everyone who want a stun gun or shotgun can acquire them after short bureaucratic hustle ) , problem is gun usage laws : laws are protecting criminals - if you 'll kill an attacker for self-defense you 'll get jail term ( 1-5 years ) in ~ 100 % of cases no matter of circumstances . 
  procedure actually cost time , money and break biological clocks in humans . 
  ( time is nudged by an hour , wonders on the globe !, 
  morning wood has been happening in a bed , now - in a bus ! ), 
  it 's happened in russia with russians , none of participants were actually irish or scots afaik - we `` care '' about gays , it help us to distract ourselves from actual problems . 
  thank you very much !, 
  work in progress .
