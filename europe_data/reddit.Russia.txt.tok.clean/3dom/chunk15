  there is anarchy , everyone is thinking he 's new chekhov and is free to editorialize anything .

  edit : [ link ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/24/05/2012/651883.shtml ), 
  thank you very much !, 
  yes . 
  i heard about white un passports . 
  got basically the same reply from them - get out to abkhazia to receive a passport ( note : in abkhazia i am unable to get passport no matter what because - besides bandits - there is certain prohibitive law to prevent pre-war population from getting citizenship/passports ) . 
  russia is hostile towards its own citizens , as `` foreigner '' i 'm happy authorities did n't send me to jail for lack of papers yet : they 'll have a chance in few weeks when i 'll try to cross the border - afaik `` illegal border crossing '' ( without proper set of documents ) result in 2 to 5 years sentence . 
  could be nice to hear ideas - how to cross borders without documents ? 
  this is exactly what i have to do now . 
  it 's not like nations are handing out their citizenship left and right . 
  i mean - besides russia on the territories they plan to annex . 
  i was on territory of abkhazia then ussr had fallen apart , war ensued few months later , and since then russians [ tell me and survived members of my family to fuck off ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20q4bo/russian_forces_storm_military_base_in_crimea/cg5wegs ) because we do n't have proper set of papers to receive russian citizenship . 
  not in russia . 
  authorities reply `` go back to abkhazia and get your documents there '' - there half of my family was killed by locals who now live in my house + apartment . 
  10 years ago my 73yo grandmother tried to get one of documents required to receive russian citizenship and she was threatened by armed people to leave the region - new owner of real estate decided she 's there to get the house back . 
  few months ago she died - still without any citizenship . 
  i 'm ethnic russian ( + ukrainian/polish ) and i was born on territory of russia . 
  i 've never been in modern georgia - only in abkhazia 22 years ago . 
  border between russia and georgia is guarded and i doubt i 'll be able to get close to it - thus ukraine via belorussia . 
  none . 
  georgians said they 'll provide documents but their embassy in russia is closed . 
  so it will be interesting adventure : to get documents i 'll have to cross few borders without documents . 
  i do n't have russian citizenship . 
  this status is called `` a person without citizenship '' - you can not get documents in russia if you do n't have documents . 
  [ actually it was 3rd party sniper ( s ) who shot both ] ( http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=www.gazeta.ru%2fpolitics%2fnews%2f2014%2f03%2f18%2fn_6021913.shtml&amp;sandbox=1 ) `` self-defense forces '' and ukrainians . 
  however exactly the same tactic to escalate conflict was used in syria , in moscow in 1993 , in riga in 1991 , in ossetia in 2008 . 
  [ unknown third party snipers are shooting both sides of conflict simultaneously ] ( http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=www.gazeta.ru%2fpolitics%2fnews%2f2014%2f03%2f18%2fn_6021913.shtml&amp;sandbox=1 ) - just like it happened in riga in 1991 , in moscow in 1993 , in ossetia in 2008 , in syria recently . 
  notice how russia is involved in all 5 cases . 
  there are [ reports about unknown snipers shooting ] ( http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=www.gazeta.ru%2fpolitics%2fnews%2f2014%2f03%2f18%2fn_6021913.shtml&amp;sandbox=1 ) both sides simultaneously . 
  exactly the same thing happened in ossetia in 2008 , in moscow in 1993 and in riga in 1991 . 
  unknown 3rd party is escalating conflict . 
  edit : link to article . 
  yes , i thought about emigration . 
  i 'm leaving the country in few weeks - problem is my plan included ukraine to get visas to other countries ( i can not get them in moscow due to my `` non citizen '' status ) and it seems the country may be in a war in couple weeks . 
  i bet on fsb . 
  russians do n't speak english ( only 5 % ) and surely do n't read guardian . 
  for others i do n't see any reason to defend putin & co. 
  they were squatting land which is historically theirs . 
  there `` historically '' means `` 70 years ago '' ( before ww2 ) . 
  [ 1 ukrainian officer died ] ( http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fvesti.ua%2fkrym%2f43094-pri-shturme-chasti-v-krymu-pogib-voennosluzhawij ) . 
  reminder : yesterday russia promised not to use military till march , 21 . 
  they mostly ignored `` referendum '' ( some people voted anyway ) . 
  there are approximately 300k tatars in crimea . 
  wounded [ officer died ] ( http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fvesti.ua%2fkrym%2f43094-pri-shturme-chasti-v-krymu-pogib-voennosluzhawij ) . 
  i 've expected crimea will be forever independent like abkhazia and ossetia - so russia could indefinitely troll ukraine , eu , us and at the same time to avoid more severe sanctions . 
  crimea joining russia means kremlin will need something else to destabilize ukraine ( to delay and maybe prevent it from joining eu and nato ) and we have high chance to see invasion into donetsk , kharkov , dnepropetrovsk and other ukrainian cities - or massive unrest and escalation of violence among locals with help of russian intelligence up to `` unknown '' snipers shooting both sides of conflict simultaneously ( like it happened in case of ossetia and georgia during spring and summer of 2008 ) . 
  people expected more severe economic sanctions . 
  sanctions against government officials made business happy . 
  after news about these sanctions russian stock prices have raised by 4-5 % . 
  i do n't like local climate - both literally and metaphorically . 
  example of local `` climate '' : a friend of mine had medium-sized `` whitehat '' company in moscow ( sales of metal for building ) which paid all possible taxes , i 've asked him why did n't he advertise the company ? 
  answer was `` i 'm afraid of tax service , they 'll see our advertisement and will come for bribes '' . 
  another friend failed documents check for his sales company ( bulk sales of imported alcohol ) - had to pay $ 30k bribe to avoid confiscation of whole business . 
  crimean invasion is just the last straw . 
  there will be not much destruction if nobody use nuclear weapons . 
  and i doubt us or france will use their nuclear weapons when poland or bulgaria will be invaded . 
  homeland was destroyed when georgians were expelled from abkhazia . 
  culture is lost , there is nothing to see - except for hostile and armed locals . 
  i do n't believe russians will be able to overthrow imperialistic government so europe has a chance to host a war . 
  sa does not have russia at the gates . 
  could be nz or australia but their immigration procedures are too strict , most likely i wo n't make it . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks for correction !, 
  at the same time `` russia today '' officially becomes `` a strategic company '' ( i guess that is alternative term for `` a weapon of mass destruction of brains '' ) . 
  note : `` ria novosti '' is being closed by the government . 
  we do n't need no stinkin ' news , propaganda is good enough . 
  maybe . 
  there are 800,000 ethnic russians in brazil . 
  i hope putin wo n't come to `` protect '' them that far from `` home '' . 
  thanks !, 
  i mean `` iron curtain '' . 
  time when you had to be a diplomat to cross the border . 
  right now border is transparent from inside - you can leave the country any moment you want , but it 's obvious it will be closed sooner or later ( it 's already being closed for cash ) . 
  regime will need people to protect itself from nato and liberate eu .
