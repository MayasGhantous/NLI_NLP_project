  yup , i hate 5 + months long winter . 
  thanks !, 
  nope , you will be fine . 
  at least until our army will start to protect russians on eu territory . 
  it 's a small and probably poor village , the guy himself most likely is n't involved in any corruption scheme so he is n't protected by usual `` code '' . 
  thank you very much !, 
  ukraine first , then i 'll try to get either to australia or south america . 
  i meant sanctions against russia may be the same as against iran . 
  what evidence ? 
  like interview with russian tank driver who admitted they were in ossetia on august , 7 - before georgians started to shoot ? 
  or interview with commander of motorized platoon who admitted they were near tskhinvali for like a day before they were allowed to break their disguise to protect whatever left from peacekeepers ? 
  these articles were deleted from russian media in few days . 
  however some information may be found in [ a blog of local activist ] ( http://cyxymu.livejournal.com/ ) . 
  russia is escalating the conflict ( example : yesterday 's descent onto ukrainian territory outside of crimean borders ) , it 's possible we 'll see severe `` iranian '' sanctions sooner or later ( peugeot sales in iran : 458.000 cars in 2011 , 0 cars in 2012 ) . 
  nowhere . 
  grani.ru is too weak and slow as source of news , rbc.ru is too pro-kremlin and too slow as well . 
  also i 'm leaving the country in couple weeks while the border is still open ( government is closing it - for cash money at the moment ) .

  edit : list of people who signet pro-kremlin letter contains dead . 
  viktor tsygal ( he was # 468 but deleted later ) [ died in 2005 ] ( http://www.theinsider.ua/rus/art/sered-diyachiv-kulturi-yaki-pidtrimali-putina-ye-mertvi-lyudi/ ) . 
  zurab tsereteli did n't knew this letter/list exist despite he 's in it . 
  russian tank army entered s-ossetia during evening of august , 7 . 
  `` official '' date is august , 8 as russia wo n't confess they 've invaded georgia ~ 12 hours before they 've started `` peacekeeping '' operation to suppress georgian resistance . 
  georgians opened fire just to stop advancing tanks . 
  if they 'd really want to attack something - abkhazia had nearly zero russian troops at that moment compared to 150 + tanks in s-ossetia . 
  idiotic international ( european ? ), 
  investigative committee accepted russian version and now we have crimea . 
  i thought now it 's obvious `` russia is a peacekeeper '' statement is ( and was ) one giant lie . 
  i thought you are about august war in 2008 . 
  btw ~ 20k georgians ( 7 % of georgian population ) were killed during 90s in abkhazia - civilians . 
  5k is the number of abkhazians which does not include russians , greeks , ukrainians killed by chechens and abkhazians . 
   georgia used the military to regain the territories please , stop repeating that . 
  georgia used military to stop advancing russian army which invaded georgia in august , 7 ( and russian `` peacekeepers '' turned into invasion force at the very same moment when russian tanks invaded georgia ) . 
  dugin has as much authority as average village idiot . 
  russian media report [ crimean self-defense forces repelled attempt of 40 thugs disguised as ukrainian border guards to damage gas station ] ( http://ria.ru/world/20140315/999650509.html ) on ukrainian territory . 
  and yandex re-broadcast this crap . 
  sanctions should affect them as well as `` russia today '' . 
  edit : it seems ukrainians did not repel anything and this station is occupied by russians . 
  '' [ solidarnost ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solidarnost ) '' - nemtsov + kasparov + yashin , strange ( if not marginal ) opposition group . 
  in russia meeting has to be approved by authorities - not just declared . 
  if you try to protest without approval you 'll be fined . 
  if you do n't want problems - you have ask for * permission * for a meeting . 
  without permission you will be arrested and/or beaten . 
  this meeting was approved by authorities . 
  i hear slogans `` stop war '' , `` hands off ukraine '' , `` stop lies '' , `` russia without putin '' . 
  and as you can see there are ukrainian flags everywhere . 
  edit : there are georgian flags too . 
  edit : [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbtwvbzqeh8 ) + [ some photos ] ( http://www.snob.ru/selected/entry/73604 ) . 
  there was slogan : `` putin , use army in russia [ to protect our right ] , we [ russians ] are oppressed here '' + [ photo of the crowd ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jdfqz72.jpg ) . 
  ** meanwhile [ ukrainian army repelled attempt of russian troops to airdrop onto ukrainian mainland ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?depth=1&amp;nv=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.unian.net/politics/896845-v-hersonskoy-oblasti-vyisadilsya-rossiyskiy-desant.html ) . 
  list includes shoigu ( ministry of defence ) , sechin ( rosneft ) , kiselev ( russia today ) , surkov ( pr ) , miller ( gazprom ) , zhirinovsky , rogozin , ivanov . 
  dmitry medvedev is n't in the list . 
  most likely foreign companies in russia will not be nationalized and investments of foreign citizens and organizations will not be touched because it 's impossible to tell the difference between `` russian '' and `` foreign '' company as most medium/big local companies are registered in off-shores ( examples : [ rusal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rusal ) , [ vimpelcom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vimpelcom_ltd . ) ) . 
  same for investments - many `` foreign '' investors are just disguised russians , often with links to the government . 
  i 'd wait for next week and actual eu/us sanctions - stocks will drop more . 
   that 's not chechnya or afghanistan . 
  exactly . 
  without mountains guerrilla will be easy to deal with . 
  30-60 minutes at best . 
  most likely russian army will run them through without stopping - there are 400 attack helicopters . 
  [ it was ddos attack by russian anonymous ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/03/14/downforeveryone/ ) . 
  but it does n't matter , lenta.ru is not interesting anymore . 
  tl ; dr stocks of oil , gas , metallurgic companies have dropped by 10-20 % . 
  considering previous market drops country 's economy lost about 100 billions already . 
  rouble has dropped below 2008-2009 crisis value . 
  edit : gazprom ceo ( [ zubkov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viktor_zubkov ) ) sold all his gazprom stock . 
   you think russia is really that stupid ? 
  yup - kremlin is really that stupid . 
  there are more bad news ( for locals ) coming from russia today . 
  if i were a pessimist i 'd say kremlin suppressed independent news sites to invade the rest of ukraine during this weekend . 
  it 's unique chance for putin as ukraine has only 6000 combat-ready soldiers against 200k + russians . 
   you have any idea why putin would think that 's a good idea ? 
  1 ) war is the best distraction from financial problems ; 2 ) if needed it will allow to use martial law and turn russia into north korea - or at least into china ; 3 ) ukraine may/will restore nuclear weapons and it will be extremely dangerous as member of nato ; 4 ) if ( the rest of ) ukraine successfully secede from cis and join nato+eu it will end putin 's imperialistic doctrine and he does n't have any replacement . 
  some of these may worth more than an economy + russia has rich experience of surviving on shoestring budget - including putin 's own government 15 years ago . 
  because whole ukraine at the moment has 6000 combat-ready soldiers against 220k russian troops near ukrainian border . 
  putin can annex giant country with nearly zero casualties . 
  i believe government is preparing for massive invasion into ukraine . 
  browsers with `` turbo '' ( proxy ) option bypass these blocks . 
  \\ + 3 more sites with `` unpopular '' opinions will be blocked - grani.ru ej.ru kasparov.ru - they are n't even remotely extremist . 
  there is a bright side though : in case of revolution population will be ready to communicate through government 's blocks using opera.turbo , vpns and various proxy services . 
  there is state capitalism in russia . 
  every business de-facto belong to various state officials - either directly or via intermediary businessmen . 
  if business does n't belong to a bureaucrat - it 's either too small or not profitable . 
  vkontacte was co-owned by its founder ( [ durov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pavel_durov ) ) and `` kremlin-friendly '' oligarch ( [ usmanov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alisher_usmanov ) ) for a long time ( `` unfriendly oligarchs '' are either dead of expelled from the country ) . 
  couple months ago durov sold his stock and does not control anything anymore . 
  it 's safe to say vkontacte is controlled by the government using intermediary oligarchs - just like almost every business in russia . 
  afaik results of google.translate work can be manipulated . 
  it seems some jester fed gt with `` heathcliff '' as translation of '' \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430.\u0440\u0443 '' . 
  creating media agency under pressure of kremlin is nearly impossible . 
  at best they 'll be able to immigrate and start something from outside the country . 
  half of personnel quit their jobs today after shareholder ( mamut ) had to fire chief editor and manager under direct pressure of putin 's administration . 
  it was 5th largest european news site ( 20 + millions unique visitors in january ) . 
  now i 'll have to scrap news from multiple sites for weekly `` what happened in your country ? '', 
  thread . 
  edit : also [ 5 journalists left `` russian planet '' ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/03/13/rusplt/ ) news site today over censorship campaign which followed invasion into crimea . 
  lenta.ru is ( was ) 5th largest news site in europe by amount of visitors . 
  russia has [ 2000 tanks in active service ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_main_battle_tanks_by_country#r ) . 
  `` 1800 tanks near ukraine '' means there are only 100-200 tanks left near chinese border - which is extremely vulnerable position considering it will take 2 + weeks to move tanks from ukrainian border to far east . 
  or article is n't entirely correct .
