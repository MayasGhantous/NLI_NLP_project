  disclaimer : i 'm not against putin personally - he 's just average person with too much power in his hands and idiotic soviet-bred entourage which does n't know what to do besides building state capitalism borrowed from xix century . 
  but he could do a bit more than just replication of his kgb experience . 
   is there anything from putin policies that you support ? 
  why would i support policies of a mafioso who rigged multiple elections , helped `` yeltsin 's family '' to secure stolen soviet property , attacked 2 friendly ( or at least non-hostile ) countries and is now ruining economy while leading the country to ww3 ? 
  i 'm russian . 
  i could understand if vietnamese were deprived of citizenship in rufed , but it 's actually ethnic russians who can not get the citizenship without paying few thousands $ $ $ in bribes after ussr fall and followed wars and ethnic cleansing in - stans and around caucasus . 
  you do n't have to feel bad - i 'm not homophobic and it 's impossible to offend me by calling me `` gay '' , `` jew '' ( note : in russia you are either pro-kremlin `` patriot '' or `` jew '' ) , `` paid foreign agent '' , `` spy '' etc. 
  - i 'm getting `` accusations '' like that almost daily and i see them as recognition of my activity and a `` badge of honor '' ( also i think my great grandfather actually was jewish ) . 
  it 's personal because half of my family was killed in abkhazia during ethnic cleansing which was organized and managed by rufed military intelligence + the rest of my family became refugees and could n't get citizenship in rufed for 12-22 years ( grandmother died few months ago - without any citizenship ) . 
  and afaik this case is n't unique - there are a lot of people in russia without any citizenship , many of them are ethnic russians as you could guess - there is even official term for that : `` person without citizenship '' ( '' \u043b\u0438\u0446\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 '' ) . 
  i hope i did n't make you fall asleep with this wall of text , 
  first i have to move to a country which wo n't become wwiii primary battlefield and does n't have bloody revolution + civil war as possible variants of development . 
  from what i heard china offered to pay in advance for few years with 30 % discount ( less than 300 $ - price was more like 250-270 $ ) . 
  i do n't remember source though . 
  afaik china pay 30 % less than eu . 
  selling 100 % of gas and oil to china will reduce government 's budget by 15 % ( army expenses = 16 % of budget ) and all currency reserves will be depleted before 2020 . 
  btw there is popular opinion renaissance began from lyrics of `` father of humanism '' [ francesco petrarca ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petrarch ) . 
  less than 20 years ago moscow said they guarantee territorial integrity of ukraine . 
  it 's interesting to see there are still some people who believe talking with kremlin is n't useless . 
  i 'd go to attend [ battle of hastings ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_hastings ) on winning side - their descendants still owns 70 % of land in england 1000 years later . 
  but better i 'd be born yesterday in australia - to get all luxuries of modern life and be as far away from most intense battles of wwiii as possible . 
  `` ukrainians are n't a nation / nationality , they are confused russians ( i.e. 
  they do n't have a right to have a separate state ) '' , `` crimea is russian territory '' , `` ussr was good and must be restored '' , `` our people in crimea need protections from ukrainian nazis '' - common opinions . 
  notice how these `` arguments '' can be applied to nearly every ex-ussr territory and some countries in eastern europe ( bulgaria for example ) . 
  my pleasure . 
  i believe information exchange is the base for progress and unification and my time is well spent . 
  i heard 75 % of russians were against invasion before it happened . 
  now it 's like whole country has stepped into big pile of crap . 
  some are laughing and cheering , some are disgusted , some are nervous , some do n't think this particular crap is a problem because we had moral grounds to step in it .

  i believe `` off-duty '' part is a lie to make sentence shorter ( 2 off-duty policemen near kremlin in the same car ? ) . 
  note : protesters are getting 4 + years sentences literally for * grabbing policeman 's hand * ; * during brawl in a cafe one of participants has used grenade , [ 14 people injured including 7 women ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/03/09/rgd5/ ) ; and some crimean news - region is turned into second abkhazia ( sans ethnic cleansing - yet ) : * [ poland evacuated their consulate from crimea ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/08/03/2014/910003.shtml ) ; * [ anti-war protesters are being attacked in crimea ] ( http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/crimea-human-rights-monitors-urgently-needed-journalists-and-activists-face-wave-attacks-2014-0 ) ; * there are at least 3 attacks on journalists in crimea by `` unknown '' militants - bulgarian journalists , associated press ; * un representative was forced to get out of crimea by `` unknown '' militants ; * `` civilian self-defense forces '' [ plant minefields in crimea ] ( http://www.novayagazeta.ru/photos/62620.html ) , russian ministry of defense is ~ ~ lying ~ ~ telling the truth [ he does n't have any clues about russian military vehicles ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/05/03/2014/909331.shtml ) in crimea despite [ reports ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/08/03/2014/909992.shtml ) about relocation of 6000 troops and vehicles . 
  chechnya has so much money it can invest into industries itself yet they prefer to use money for anything else . 
  like buying 100th lamborgini for kadyrov . 
  i believe it 's actually more useful than building expensive automated plants with 0 engineers available to operate them . 
  somehow i 'm sure actual military defense and intelligence against chechnya will cost much less than buying their `` loyalty '' while having one-way transparent border with them . 
  government which will grant independence to chechnya will be wise and i 'm sure they 'll build enough defenses to protect the rest of the empire . 
  or ( most likely ) the government will be poor and wo n't have enough money to finance defense so it does n't matter if chechnya will be independent or not - they 'll bomb the shit out of russia anyway , more so if there wo n't be any type of border . 
  yes , they are clearly did n't forgot anything yet idiotic government allow them to cross the border as if they were n't enemies . 
  and then we see dubrovka , beslan , multiple explosions in moscow and around the country . 
  and they [ bring this mindset half-world away ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boston_marathon_bombings ) . 
  i assure you bombing of chechnya was n't revenge for russian population - just yeltsin betrayed his chechen allies and refused them independence . 
  despite kremlin 's lies nobody would do anything to protect russians anywhere - unless they happen to be the government itself . 
  otherwise kremlin would bomb abkhazia - there hundreds ( if not thousands ) of russians were killed by locals and chechens during ethnic cleansing . 
  they do n't cause too much troubles ( there are some , but nothing serious ) . 
  should n't make jokes about dead people . 
  grozny had ~ 40 % of russian population before yeltsin gave up the territory to separatists in exchange for support of his staged coup-d-etas in 1991 . 
  those 150 + thousands people were n't evicted peacefully . 
  spending money on referendum is pointless , i 'd be happy to part with the territory without wasting any more billions $ $ $ on them - except for very high fence with machine gun turrets on top , tanks and artillery around . 
  it 's uncontrollable criminal off-shore with alien mindset and they 'll be independent sooner or later so it 's just practical to cut losses sooner rather than later while country still has money to build said fence instead of waiting for another [ beslan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beslan_school_hostage_crisis ) or [ dubrovka ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_theater_hostage_crisis ) to happen . 
  latest example of the culture : car with 4 chechens tried to speed up ( near kremlin by the way ) , another car did n't allow them to , they 've shot the vehicle few times ( i 'll add link to the article in `` what happened in your country this week ? '', 
  thread ) . 
  do n't need a lot of power when half of opposing army is ready to defect and population is willing to cooperate . 
  and for resistance there is inexpensive practice of non-juridical `` trials '' ( killing ) - tested in ingushetia and dagestan . 
  as for economy - eastern ukraine produce a lot , it 's asset . 
  it 's interesting to see eu prefer to finance restoration of ussr instead of nuclear energy . 
  russia is speeding up the process to proceed with other ukrainian regions . 
  the only thing they share with rufed is foreign policy and customs/border guards - in exchange for huge amount of free gas and money . 
  that 's because kremlin can not control chechnya after 2 wars rufed had lost there , not because kremlin is liberal/tolerant . 
  reaction of european countries ( sans poland ) looks like invitation for putin to take the rest of ukraine and probably others ex-ussr states . 
  someone is about to steal couple billions . 
  it has important industrial facilities ( [ icbm manufacturing plant ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yuzhmash ) for example ) - so putin will make sure it fits for invasion . 
  thanks !, 
  it seems greece alone can stop russian invasion with their 1200 tanks . 
  that was the first article about arrests . 
  [ another/latest article ] ( http://grani.ru/politics/russia/m.225936.html ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26410431 ), 
  tl ; dr ukrainian official says russian army is going to kill its own soldiers tonight in crimea to provoke bigger invasion . 
  [ official site in ukrainian + video ] ( http://mvs.gov.ua/mvs/control/main/uk/publish/article/991143 ), 
  i wonder if ukrainian government may ( and will ) ask for help nearby countries directly instead of passive nato and eu ? 
  400-500 tanks ( which will not instantly defect to russian army ) with proper support may change situation dramatically . 
  polish * tanks * ? 
  * both * of them ? 
  jokes aside - how many tanks are there ? 
  `` tanks '' means there are at least * two * of them . 
  there is a problem with ukrainian army : it partially consist of ethnic russians and many of them may ( and will ) defect instantly if they 'll face russian army . 
  just like it happened with `` admiral of navy '' yesterday . 
  these have russia-based companies too ( yandex is on nasdaq for example ) . 
  russian stock exchange dropped by 9-10 % during 1 hour . 
  few companies dropped by as much as 25 % ( before trade was stopped for their stock ) . 
  yup . 
  especially after russian tanks will advance to kharkiv , donetsk , denpropetrovsk . 
  life was somewhat comfortable in russia and the price of struggle is high - freedom and life - so people preferred to convince themselves it 's hopeless , to suppress feeling of guilt for not doing anything . 
  now i see some people openly question putin 's sanity ( common opinion : he 's sane but can not change his course even if it looks like political and economical suicide ) and talk about possibility of resistance as nobody want to sink with him . 
  i imagine lot of billions ( if not trillions ) of `` russian '' actives will be frozen worldwide soon . 
  problem is - most do n't think anything and blindly trust propaganda they see on tv . 
  those who can think are calling this situation `` suicide '' as everyone understand this state may not survive severe trade embargoes which are about to start during next week . 
  ** russia ** , `` unknown '' military is invading ukraine so there are only couple important ( good ) news : * ~ 400 people were arrested today in moscow and saint peterburg for [ anti-war protests ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/03/02/detained/ ) ; * president 's [ human rights council is against usage of army ] ( http://www.president-sovet.ru/news/5632/ ) in ukraine . 
  people are giving up their time ( and probably careers ) to resist . 
  i enjoy opportunity to disagree with with this government in the interwebs - while i still have access to this functionality instead of `` great russian firewall '' or jail cell like those who dare to express their disagreement outside of their houses . 
  before this invasion putin 's politics were tolerable , now it 's obvious he is dragging country back into poverty and potentially into major war . 
  i can practically see how middle class is turning into fifth column right now - probably with organized resistance soon to follow . 
  greece does not suffer from `` peaceful '' military invasion . 
  my friends from sochi already see a wave of hotel reservations from people who have abandoned their plans to visit crimea . 
  also food prices in russia are approximately 50 % higher than in ukraine - there will be shock in local economy during next few weeks .
