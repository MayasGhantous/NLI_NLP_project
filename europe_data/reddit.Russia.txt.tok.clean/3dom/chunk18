  yes , it will take some time to build new pipes . 
  however there are already some ( at least for oil ) and china dictates very low prices ( 30-40 % below european afaik ) . 
  putin invaded two countries which i like ( i 've spent years in both georgia and ukraine ) , now he is digging his own political grave which also has potential to bury weakened russian economy and the state itself ( trade embargoes can do that easily as country heavily depends on both import and export ) . 
  no , i do n't agree with his actions . 
  russia will be more than happy to protect its slavic brothers from euro-gays in poland . 
  but you 'll have to wait a bit while russian army is busy saving people in ukraine . 
  eu can prevent it - by stopping buying russian gas ( or paying less ) . 
  china will pay for the gas 1/3 less making it difficult for the regime to survive let alone finance invasions . 
  okies , wo n't editorialize anymore . 
  even thought in present ( critical ) situation additional attention and awareness may be vital . 
  that 's yesterday 's news ( flagman leaving crimea ) . 
  news ( rumors ? ), 
  about possible defection appeared today and besides their obvious propaganda value they may be actually true but surprising : naval officers should n't be that dumb as `` defected '' `` berkut '' grunts and should understand they will be demoted or discharged and surely they will be watched by fsb for a very long time . 
  if not forever . 
  can not be 100 % sure about motives of defectors - especially when the crew is consist of mixed nationalities . 
  i hope russians will be smart enough to discharge the crew before they 'll try to sink ship in the middle of sevastopol port - to trap russian fleet inside - or detonate gunpowder / explosives near russian flagman . 
  slavic military is well-known for their suicide practices . 
  tl ; dr + 1 link : `` unknown '' military groups are blocking roads in western russia , [ tv news claim there are ukrainian extremists ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/03/02/road/ ) . 
  edit : meanwhile [ ukrainian airborne unit is blocked in southern town nikolaev ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/03/02/block/ ) by anti-maidan protesters - after troopers have tried to advance to guard military weapon storage nearby . 
  note : in 1992 war in abkhasia escalated rapidly after russian military deliberately left weapon storage opened for abkhazian and chechen militia in gudauta . 
  wwii history is very controversial for russians . 
  example : my grandfather fought for stalin , his father - for hitler , the former was forced to go through traumatizing `` loyalty test '' by communists - execute `` collaborationist '' russian woman , he never recovered fully . 
  also in stalingrad russians were forced to fight without any training and often without weapons ( see '' [ enemy at the gates ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0215750/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_32 ) '' with jude law ) . 
  as result of such history opinions differs greatly - up to `` hitler was our savior '' , `` we 'd all drive mercedes cars by now if stalin had lost the war '' . 
  let 's see how their mood will change 6 months later after tourist season fail , skyrocketed food prices , limited economic support from russia as putin is already struggling with recession in russian economy . 
  but this was our territory 60 years ago . 
  just like kaliningrad/konigsberg was german before 1945 and vyborg was finnish before winter war , south ossetia and abkhazia were georgian before 1992 . 
  apparently this government believe in proverb `` winners will not be judged '' ( \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u044f\u0442 ) . 
  and is seems they are going to continue as long as europe will sponsor them buying gas . 
  considering there are [ pro-russian protests ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1za2i7/prorussian_protestors_put_russian_flags_on/ ) in eastern ukraine - authorities expect russian army is going to start `` protective invasion '' soon . 
  update : morning , march 2 : [ total mobilization of army reservists in ukraine ] ( https://www.facebook.com/andriy.parubiy/posts/667812769951576?stream_ref=10 ) ( link to facebook post of ukrainian government official ) . 
  it seems ukraine has chance to repel invasion into eastern/southern regions . 
  update : government assigned [ 2 oligarchs ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/03/02/east/ ) as temporary heads of administrations in eastern regions ( donetsk and dnepropetrovks ) . 
  couple weeks ago nobody expected russia can invade friendly slavic state - now i believe putin is capable to restore whole ussr ( territory ) before 2020 . 
  also nato was n't tested against superpower with thermonuclear icbms . 
   romania would n't be a walk in the park if that were the case . 
  i 'm afraid we 'll have a chance to check that . 
  ministry of foreign affairs of russia says russian tourists are in danger in * western * ukraine and ukrainian authorities can not protect them - after episode ( feb , 21 ) where russian bus driver was shot by protestors who thought there are pro-yanukovich militants ( titushki ) in the bus . 
  there are criminal gangs roaming the country and they are n't controlled by government . 
  when ministry of foreign affairs talk about gangs shooting tourists - that means they are threatening with ( bigger ) invasion . 
  kharkiv administration is seized by pro-russian protestors . 
  assault in donetsk has failed , probably will be repeated during night . 
  i guess it wo n't take long for russian army to start `` protective '' actions in eastern ukraine . 
  poverty is n't that bad for a fascist state - it provide more uneducated cannon fodder to conquer neighbors . 
  what if he is n't naive - maybe he just did n't want to risk his missiles and troops by placing them in poland , dangerously close to russia ? ... 
  i 'd make a bet . 
  not on fact of aggression but on amount of countries russian armies will take before nato will be able to stop them . 
  certainly number will be equal or higher than 3 ( baltic states ) - that 's besides ( the rest of ) georgia , ukraine and probably moldova if it wo n't be quick enough to join romania . 
  it 's not necessary to have local russian minority : [ kremlin is ready to `` protect '' even russian tourists ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/03/01/mid1/ ) in your country . 
  if i was a baltic state i 'd ask nato to place multiple bases on my territory right * now * . 
  same for poland , bulgaria , romania , slovakia and hungary . 
  because you never know - how many russians needed for putin to `` protect '' them in your country and how many `` useless '' countries nato is willing to give up in exchange for russian gas ? 
  another variant is possible : if russia assimilate ukraine then transistria will not be isolated . 
  the only `` militia '' which was in crimea - ex - `` berkut '' and later `` unknown '' russian military . 
  crimeans did n't protest thus there were no organized groups . 
  1.5 % recession in january , ~ 15 % currency devaluation in 2 months , year-to-year sales of local car manufacturer dropped by 21 % , food prices and utility bills grow 15-50 % per year ( inflation is around 5 % ) . 
  i believe local economy is n't good - it 's just react too slowly compared to other countries . 
  example : kazakhstan devalued currency by 20 % in a single day in january , russia devalued currency by 15 % during 2 months ( and drop continues ) . 
  it 's possible because government has reserves of currency created before 2010 - but they are disappearing quickly . 
  i would n't use term `` without second thought '' for 10 + years long procedure . 
  especially if compared to 2-36 months long highly corrupted process here . 
  except there is high chance of heart attack from carrying approximately 30kg of equipment including civilian heavy assault armor . 
  my sincere condolences . 
  but i 'm afraid i will disappoint you : russian army does not fight with fascism - it 's doing precisely the opposite . 
   russia is not preparing for some massive all out invasion . 
  i bet georgians had the same thoughts before august-2008 . 
  but putin know how to make surprises even though he need approximately 3 months to move tank army into attack position ( force which invaded georgia in august had started moving toward the country in * spring * 2008 ) . 
  come here , draw a sign with this request ( or any sign ) , try to stand with it in the center of moscow for authorities to see . 
  i bet you will be arrested in under 10 minutes - maybe even 2 minutes if you 'll stand near kremlin . 
  is it the same in catalonia ? 
  i live approximately 15km away from potential targets ( or at least i am not aware of any targets that are closer ) - so i have good chances to survive , maybe even get away unscathed if i wo n't stand near windows when the blast wave hit + if radiation cloud will turn away . 
  i 'd be horrified too as we 've witnessed how ~ 200 russian spetsnaz troopers took over whole region with 2 millions unprepared people during just few hours . 
  and they 've used only single stun grenade in the process . 
  i think you misinterpreted my comments : i 'm against kremlin politics in this case , maybe even pro-ukrainian as my grandmother was polish from ternopol and grandfather was from kharkiv ( other half of family is purely russian ) . 
  and now try to imagine content of comments from pro-kremlin russians on russian forums . 
  and it seems diplomats did some work already as russian military has abandoned airports . 
  you are right , it seems military has abandoned airports . 
  there is no need for ukraine to attack first to provoke invasion . 
  if russia will attack asap there will be hardly any resistance as ukrainian army is paralyzed after government change and probably demoralized after rapid crimean assault - as you could see few hundreds russian troops took over whole crimea without a single shot . 
  they 've used just * one stun grenade * to take control over whole crimea region . 
  no doubt ukraine is stronger than georgia , but can it control its army at the moment ? 
  i did n't hear anything about ukrainian army responding to situation in crimea . 
  yes . 
  i see like 3/4 of commentators on forums support invasion into crimea - and these are n't usual kremlin-sponsored bots . 
  it 's surprise for me because before invasion most comments were like `` we must avoid stepping into this shit at all costs '' . 
  situation in ukraine is the same as in abkhazia in 1992 : unrest , bad economy , pro-russian minority ( or majority - even better ) , russians in russia thinking it 's ok to help `` brothers '' and `` save '' `` ex-russian '' region from local nationalists ( in the end russians were expelled from abkhazia - but who cares ? ), 
  also putin need successful war to distract population from recession in economy + perhaps if he will assimilate crimea and eastern ukraine ( + maybe georgia too ) he will be remembered as great leader instead of corrupted tyrant . 
   nobody in the west would agree to send troops there . 
  i 'm sure kremlin count on it . 
  ca n't blame you for feeling vulnerable : after these news i got couple thoughts today about possible nuclear detonations nearby ( where to hide ? ), 
  notice how 40 % of crimeans ( 800,000 ? ), 
  could n't protect region from couple hundreds of russian spetsnaz troopers . 
  i hope i am wrong and kremlin does n't want to invade eastern ukraine - but after wars in georgia i know they are going to choose the most evil variant . 
  i 'm afraid crimea was just a beginning of bigger conflict . 
  if you live in southern/eastern ukraine - you better move away while you have time . 
  surely they understand `` slavic brotherhood '' mentality will be broken - on ukrainian side only : population in russia overwhelmingly support invasion into ukraine ( at least in crimea ) as people see it as russian territory and most think ukrainians wo n't be too angry ( after all there is opinion ukrainians are n't even a nation - just different kind of russians ) . 
  russians think it 's ok to take this territory `` back '' . 
  same for eastern ukraine region - so most likely we 'll see bigger invasion as nobody is going to stop putin ( especially when he need a war to distract population from economic recession ) . 
  tl ; dr many russians think ukrainians are n't even a separate nation and they can not be angry for joining `` other russians '' . 
  `` ussr '' as in `` territory of ussr '' - not `` communist state '' .
