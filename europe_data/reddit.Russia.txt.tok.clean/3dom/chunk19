  russian senators are already making laws needed for instant acquisition of new territories and without any doubts these laws will be used for ossetia and abkhazia - not only for crimea and eastern ukraine ( soon ) . 
  and maybe for the rest of georgia too ... 
  russian nationalism could end imperialistic agenda of this regime ( and the regime itself ) so government brainwashed population to not to understand difference between nationalism and nazism ( it 's the same for most russians ) and people literally see any nationalists as `` nazis '' ( russian nationalists included ) . 
  russian tank army need ~ 3 months to relocate . 
  if nato is going to protect any part of ukraine - it has to do so before summer or it will be too late . 
  i believe present maneuvers of russian army near ukrainian border do n't pose serious treat as they use local ( few ) military units - i.e. 
  they are not invasion force afaik . 
  however ukrainian army is incapacitated after riots and i guess even few russian tanks may take over half of ukraine ... 
  i 've seen abkhazian war - very closely . 
  from inside of abkhazian side . 
  `` clashes '' were organized by snipers from russian gru shooting both sides of conflict simultaneously . 
  same tactic was used in 1993 in moscow to escalate conflict between military forces loyal to either president or parliament - `` unknown '' snipers were shooting both sides . 
  the only difference with present situation is kremlin did n't have enough time to organize the same situation in crimea - but we have good chance to see it in eastern ukraine . 
  unrest , `` unknown '' snipers shooting people and soldiers , army desperately trying to defend population from advancing `` protective '' russian tanks . 
  it 's not exactly `` russian '' population ( as ethnic group ) : government is giving away ~ 500,000 passports to migrants every year . 
  and these migrants are mostly from `` stans '' . 
  [ deaths/births ratio is ~ 1 ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2013/11/05/dying-russia-is-on-pace-to-record-natural-population-growth-in-2013/ ) i.e. 
  population does n't grow from natural causes + substantial part of births is provided by ~ 10 millions migrants in the country as their children are almost automatically given russian citizenship ( as well as their parents afterwards ) . 
  exactly the same situation yet the world believe it was saakashvili who had started the war in 2008 . 
  maybe georgian army started to shoot first - but only to protect whatever left from their own territory . 
  just this time riots in ukraine caught putin with his pants down and he decided to act less carefully than in georgia ( where he had years to prepare invasion ) . 
  it 's like putin is allowed to do whatever he want as long as he does not using nukes . 
  btw i was right about bigger invasion : kremlin is [ handing out russian passports ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/passports/ ) to ukrainians ( to `` protect '' them later ) . 
  russian invasion into eastern ukraine with nato simultaneously taking the west - it will be the modern variant of poland-1939 . 
  i hope nato wo n't be that passive to give up * whole * ukraine to russian army . 
  if they 'll be really quick they may even prevent invasion into eastern ukraine . 
  i think it 's not that complicated . 
  fascist state is needed for him to have cart-blanch for invasions to restore ussr . 
  there is +1 aspect of the situation : public opinion . 
  while riots in kiev resulted in mixed opinions with mostly supportive comments as nobody liked yanukovich and many did n't believe ~ ~ stories ~ ~ propaganda about `` ukrainian nazis taking over the state '' - idea of russian troops in crimea and claiming this territory is overwhelmingly supported by public . 
  putin is getting reputation boost and cart-blanche to do whatever the **** he want . 
  everything . 
  fascist regime , foreign policy - even olympics supported by western leaders before going into war . 
  it 's like i am living in germany circa 1936-1939 . 
  7 unmarked apcs were spotted roaming in crimea yesterday - police talked to them , they were russians . 
  tl ; dr : russian military forces have seized control over two airports in crimea to prevent arrival of kiev officials note : i 've traced [ original article on interfax website ] ( http://www.interfax.ru/world/txt/361733 ) - they 've corrected it : these are `` crimean self-defense '' forces . 
  however they have military equipment and training and there is no way civilians could acquire military weapons in ukraine - it 's nearly impossible to have even hunting weapon ( as you could see during protests in kiev there were just few low power weapons among protesters ) . 
  [ + link ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/belbek/ ) : ukrainian minister of internal affairs is blaming russia for military invasion [ on his facebook page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/arsen.avakov.1/posts/597469000343210?stream_ref=5 ) . 
  \\ + 1 link ( this time in english ) : 150 crimean `` berkut '' officers are [ blocking traffic to/from crimea on perekopsky isthmus ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/report-crimean-berkut-police-on-perekopsky-isthmus-to-prevent-armed-invasion-337859.html ) . 
  and one more link : [ russian parliament is readying laws to accept crimea into russian federation ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/cometous/ ) . 
  and to remind you : [ in september russian officials clearly stated they wo n't guarantee peace and stability in ukraine ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/22/ukraine-european-union-trade-russia ) if it will accept eu trade agreement . 
  quote from mr. glazyev : `` ukrainian authorities make a huge mistake if they think that the russian reaction will become neutral in a few years from now . 
  this will not happen ... 
  signing this treaty will lead to political and social unrest , '' said the kremlin aide . 
  `` the living standard will decline dramatically ... there will be chaos . '', 
  it sounds like promise - which is being fulfilled now . 
  update : russian lawmakers to allow ukrainians to get [ russian citizenship instantly ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/passports/ ) - without leaving ukraine , without living in russia , without source of income confirmation , etc. 
  for me it looks like obvious preparation for invasion to `` protect russian citizens '' - just like it happened in georgia in 2008 . note : russian political elite is partially prepared for conflict with the west as [ they have accepted a law which forbid them to have accounts in foreign banks ] ( http://izvestia.ru/news/562716 ) - as recently as in december , 2013 . 
  many of them transferred at least some of their money back into russia . 
  update : [ russian naval forces had blocked ukrainian border guards in balaklava ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/rus/ ) ( + [ link to official ukrainian site ] ( http://dpsu.gov.ua/ua/about/news/news_3401.htm ) ) +10 russian military helicopters have crossed ukrainian borders ( [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tvypihvz1a&amp;feature=youtu.be ) ) . 
  they do n't hide anymore . 
  update : [ during conference in rostov-on-don yanukovich demanded to leave crimea within ukrainian state ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/krym/ ) . 
  it seems kremlin want to negotiate his restoration in exchange for crimea ( which is impossible ) - or just convince public russia is n't going to invade eastern ukraine despite they are clearly going to `` protect russian citizens '' asap . 
  probably kremlin need timeout for couple days to hand out at least few passports in kharkiv and donetsk - before actually sending tanks there . 
  update : kremlin refused to talk with ukraine over situation in crimea as it 's '' [ inner ukrainian situation ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/note/ ) '' and russian military in crimea is just protecting itself . 
  update : yanukovich said he is against invasion into ukraine . 
  it seems he does n't know about situation in crimea . 
  ( no link , i 'm listening to live translation ) edit : thanks for the `` gold '' for this dark comment !, 
  edit : and thanks again for second gold !, 
  however i hope i wo n't become reddit-rich from commenting military conflicts ... update : [ militants have abandoned airports ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/simfer/ ) + [ crimean population has created petition to putin to avoid using military forces in crimea ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/nowarplease/ ) . 
  yet the laws ( possibility to accept new regions + russian passports for ukrainians ) remain in the work + invaded military helicopters are still in the region . 
  [ russia is starting to give away passports in ukraine ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/pass/ ) - to disbanded crimean `` berkut '' officers . 
  it looks like ukrainian army has awoken and [ closed space for airplanes in crimea ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/closed/ ) , flights are being relocated elsewhere . 
  [ zhirinovsky ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_zhirinovsky ) stuck in there . 
  saturnday , march 1 : [ crimean authorities have asked putin to protect them from `` unknown militants '' in crimea ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/03/01/power/ ) . 
  this spectacle is not over , now they are making up reasons for invasion post-factum . 
  russia is trying to pull the same result as in regional conflicts in georgia and moldova : countries with unresolved military conflicts can not be accepted into nato and eu . 
  similar situation happened with moldova and georgia . 
  it 's common `` solution '' for ex-ussr countries which want to break away from russia : divide and conquer [ later ] . 
  i 'm not sure about more tatar sauces as i 'm not familiar with this cuisine . 
  however i can recommend to try out georgian [ tkemali ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tkemali ) plum sauce and spicy sacebeli sauce . 
  whole situation got sudden turn as chechnya 's leader [ kadyrov offered to `` help '' crimean population ] ( http://glavred.info/politika/kadyrov-otpravilsya-iz-chechni-v-krym-podderzhivat-russkih-272315.html ) . 
  if i were crimean native i 'd think again before inviting russians as it means chechens will be invited too - and they have rich traditions of purging russians : chechnya had 45 % ethnic russians before 1988 + chechens killed a lot of russians ( + ukrainians , greeks ) in abkhazia during ethnic cleansing in 1992-1994 . 
  yes , it 's named after this nationality . 
  i think recipe was borrowed by europeans from locals during [ crimean war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_war ) . 
  they are * ukrainian * civilians . 
  if it 's about ethnicity and nationalism - then why do n't kremlin want to protect tatar civilians who seems to be oppressed in crimea ? 
  tatars are rufed people too and i guess tatarstan will not be amused if their interests will be ignored . 
  similar tests happened near georgian border during summer-2008 - before the war . 
  klitschko was not amused . 
  it 's `` centuria '' ( `` hundred '' ) - unit of cossack armies . 
  note : it 's pavlensky - artist who [ nailed his balls to pavement ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/15/artist-scrotum-red-square-charged-hooliganism-petr-pavlensky ) on red square couple months ago . 
  it seems they 've failed already : [ statue of lenin was broken by population of sevastopol ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zykzbfv.png ) ( southernmost mark on the map ), 
  there is handwritten note : `` healing , exorcism '' with phone numbers . 
  thank you very much !, 
  ** russia ** , not much happened actually : end of `` non politicized '' olympics ( 1st place by amount of gold medals ) , protests * pussy riot was [ attacked ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivt-i-yxtdy ) by government-sponsored militants in sochi ( ukrainians call them `` titushki '' , in russia they are `` cossacks '' , `` nashi '' , etc. 
  ) , one of initiators ( with whip ) was fined * and then secretly decorated by putin himself * ( note : cursive is my guesswork ) ; * crimean lawmakers are proposing [ secession from ukraine to join russia ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/19/crimea/ ) - again ( they do it during every crisis as if they understand they are very useful for kremlin as part of ukraine - to create pressure on kiev ) ; * russian ministry of foreign affairs [ blames ukrainian protesters for their own deaths ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/lavrov-phones-kerry-blames-opposition-for-ukraine-violence-337385.html ) ; * when yanukovich fled to kharkiv he allegedly met 4 russian governors ( from krasnodar , stavropol , rostov regions afaik ) and 2 top government officials ; * it seems many pro-yanukovich politics have fled to russia ( kharkiv governor and mayor for example + there are reports about some ministers and senators but they are n't clear ) ; * absolutely unprecedented amount of propaganda against ukrainian protesters on government-controlled tv channels and newspapers - up to headlines like `` ukrainian anarchists will attack russia after they gain control of ukraine '' ( `` komsomolskaia ` pravda ' '' ) . 
  government is fearmongering to prevent boost of radical movements across the country + to prevent `` export '' of revolution from ukraine . 
  edit : much corrections . 
  very english . 
  wow . 
  [ border service confirmed they did not allow yanukovich to fly away from donetsk airport ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/border-service-yanukovychs-plane-not-allowed-to-leave-from-donetsk-due-to-lack-of-required-documents-337394.html ) . 
  anonymous source of interfax agency says [ yanukovich is in kharkiv ] ( http://www.interfax.ru/world/news/360345 ) . 
  edit : at the same time source of itar tass agency says [ plane of yanukovich did n't arrive to kharkiv ] ( http://itar-tass.com/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/993291 ) . 
  note : president could use different plane so both variants may be true and he 's in kharkiv . 
  edit 2 : senator hanna herman from yanukovich 's `` party of regions '' said he 's in kharkiv . 
  i wo n't be surprised if she 's tricked to say that ( so yanukovich will have time for something else before he will be impeached ) . 
   yanukovych wo n't back down it seems there was enough force already : protesters control government buildings in kiev , yanukovich ( and ministers ) has fled from capitol and probably from the country . 
  media report protestors control government buildings and yanukovich has left kiev . 
  it 's not clear - where is he at the moment ?
