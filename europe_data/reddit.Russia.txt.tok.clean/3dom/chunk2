  still here , no development so far , it will become clear in monday/tuesday . 
  everyone . 
  today i overheard conversation about `` uprising against kremlin fascists '' - in a bank , in relatively rich moscow region , just few kilometers away from kremlin . 
  apparently government is preparing country for possible revolution and civil war ( journalists cite source using exactly these words ) : their own massive propaganda backslashed and now russians believe it 's possible to become independant from `` fascists '' - east ukrainian-style . 
  people do n't have any clues `` ukrainian separatists '' actually consist of `` lost '' russian soldiers , fsb agents , gru spetsnaz , russian volunteers and bandits armed by kremlin - they think it 's possible to revolt and win without massive external support . 
   correct apologies , bad wording . 
  i should have used `` add '' instead of `` correct '' . 
  as for mostly asian roots of russian culture and state - here is interesting fact : serfdom in ussr/russia was de-facto abolished only in * 1960s * ( population of rural areas could n't receive internal passports to move freely within the country before 60s ) . 
  this does n't look like europe at all and actions of people in this state indicate they still treat population like a property or cattle which does not have free will . 
   russia has never been culturally european i 'd like to correct : * russian state * has never been european . 
  substantial part of population share european values , but apparently it 's not substantial enough to form modern `` europe-compatible '' peaceful state which would n't start / participate in 6 wars during 23 years . 
  thank you very much !, 
  will do . 
  `` tushki '' also can be used to neutralize command and information centers of missile defense system in other european countries . 
  ^ ^ that is literal translation from somewhat `` diplomatic '' article . 
  i bet actual language between military officers was much less mild . 
  they talk about usage of nuclear weapons already , bombers are `` just '' a method to protect the missiles . 
  [ article in russian ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/16/09/2014/949378.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[item_4] ) explain how mid-range bombers [ tu-22m ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tupolev_tu-22m ) may/will be deployed in crimea to ( potentially ) bomb romania and neutralize nato anti-missile defense ( for follow up icbm launch probably ) . 
  this does look like some kind of fantastic scenario . 
  but we would say exactly that 1 year ago about scenario in which russia attack ukraine and destroy multiple towns and cities populated by ethnic russians . 
  nice poetry , but it 's a bit outdated : exchange rate is above 50 roubles per euro already ( at least its higher/sell value ) . 
  thank you for your kind words !, 
  thank you very much !, 
  i believe these threads are extremely important and valuable ( as both news source and future research material ) and i 'll be able to continue post sooner or later , about different country maybe . 
  thanks !, 
  thank you very much !, 
  will do . 
  thank you !, 
  thank you very much !, 
  he have to do that to find more dumb `` heroes '' who will agree to go die in ukraine and be secretly buried in graves without names on them : lately people who died in ukraine are being buried only with numbers on their plates to avoid more scandals like one which happened in august with soldiers from pskov division . 
  no plans really . 
  first could be nice to depart from russian federation without going into jail for couple years - for incorrect set of papers . 
   any progress ? 
  yes . 
  this is most likely my last post . 
  thanks !, 
  i believe this term was born somewhere in comments in / r/europe, 
  i guess siberia has a lot of abandoned living space . 
   sanctions against russia do not work 1 ) they work - there is ( badly ) working peace treaty and 2 ) they are relatively weak , if anyone actually want to see eastern ukraine ( and crimea , georgia , moldova ) free of russian troops - he/she should consider embargo against gas and oil right now . 
  anyway kremlin can ( and will ) stop their delivery sooner or later . 
  as for czechs who were denied repatriation - i thought jus sanguinis is universal across european nations and only russian federation ( among `` civilized '' nations ) has practice to refuse citizenship to diaspora of its ethnic majority . 
  edit : english can be difficult = /, 
  apparently government was n't ready to accept 1.2 millions refugees ( 0.85 % of population ) during 6 months . 
  now people have to be dispersed across whole country - before they will start anti-war protests and riots if left unattended . 
  i consider it good joke too . 
  ( though almost nobody will see the packages anyway ), 
  afaik poland has a limit and they did n't break it , gazprom has lowered the limit without any reasons but politics . 
  ** russian federation ** it 's all eu 's fault that [ we had to start using gas supplies as `` economic weapon '' against eu ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/global-europe/moscow-limits-german-and-polish-gas-flows-warning-308383 ) * after poland pumped some gas to ukraine kremlin has decreased supply - [ poland ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/13/09/2014/948810.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[item_1] ) ( [ in english ] ( http://biznes.pap.pl/en/news/pap/info/1086390,update:-poland-claims-45--shortfall-in-russian-natgas-imports-as-of-wednesday ) ) , austria got their supply decreased substantially ( 45 % or more for poland , [ 15 % for austria ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/11/09/2014/948552.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[main_item]-[photo] ) ) - to force eu to comply with rufed 's occupation of ukraine and stop helping them ; another interpretation of these events - [ gazprom refused to increase supply to poland ] ( http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.spiegel.de%2fwirtschaft%2funternehmen%2fpolen-rudert-im-streit-um-russische-gaslieferungen-zurueck-a-991372.html ) ; * yet another `` humanitarian convoy '' of [ 70 trucks ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/13/09/2014/948767.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[main_item]-[photo] ) has officially ~ ~ invaded ~ ~ entered ukraine + [ article in english ] ( http://www.dw.de/second-russian-convoy-rolls-into-eastern-ukraine/a-17919480?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf ) . 
  it 's not clear - how exactly these trucks are being used ? 
  - as there are rumors from evacuation of hundreds of dead russian soldiers to stealing manufacturing equipment and delivering weapons and troops + of course some people believe these trucks could deliver food after kremlin decided to help people whom their troops and volunteers has bombed and robbed just few days ago ; * [ government is trying to enter arms race ] ( http://www.bfm.ru/news/272142 ) + [ article in english ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2014/09/10/putin-takes-control-of-russia-s-defence-industries-and-calls-for-new-weapons/ ) - probably result will be the same as in 80s in ussr ( government 's bankruptcy ) ; * travel industry continue to fall apart - [ yet another big company declared bankruptcy ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/retail/10/09/2014/948261.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[main_item]-[photo] ) , 6000 tourists left abroad ( some were even arrested in various countries because their bills were n't paid ) ; * ministry of culture proposed [ a law which demand up to 10 years in prison for owners of travel firms ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/retail/10/09/2014/948261.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[main_item]-[photo] ) in case of `` intentional bankruptcy '' ( not even a fraud ) ; * [ putin decided to check preparedness of bureaucrats to a war ] ( http://tvrain.ru/articles/putin_reshil_provesti_vnezapnuju_proverku_boegotovnosti_vostochnogo_voennogo_okruga-375226/ ) + there are big wargames in the east ( probably putin & co are about to start protecting ethnic russians in kazakhstan ) ; * [ authorities have arrested journalist ] ( http://tvrain.ru/articles/v_moskve_zaderzhali_zhurnalista_shipilova_za_intervju_o_marshe_za_federalizatsiju_sibiri-375225/ ) who published interview about federalization of siberia event in august + [ article in english ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/shipilov-siberia-federalization-police-detenjtion-ivanov/26577642.html ) . 
  it 's illegal even to listen ( ! ), 
  to people who are trying to remind this government about article 5 of its own `` constitution '' ; * [ new us sanctions will affect 90 % of oil and gas companies which provide 50 % of government 's budget and 70 % of export ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/14/09/2014/948821.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[item_11] ) ; * [ eu has implemented new `` mild '' sanctions against 5 banks , oil industry of russian federation ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/11/09/2014/948502.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[item_2] ) + [ article in english ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/new-eu-sanctions-will-hit-russia-on-friday/506847.html ) - despite peace treaty in ukraine ( treaty did n't stop kremlin from cutting gas delivery to poland - apparently kremlin still see ukraine as its own lost property ) ; * as an answer to new us/eu sanctions government [ decided to enforce more self-inflicted sanctions and limit import of clothing and cars ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/11/09/2014/948472.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[item_1] ) . 
  official statement was usual `` we are supporting our local manufacturers '' + `` new self-inflicted sanctions will limit mostly import of used cars '' . 
  apparently government is going to support local manufacturers of used cars ; * another portion of self-inflicted sanctions will [ limit import of refrigerators ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/12/09/2014/948762.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[item_4] ) ( ?! ) . 
  it seems the government is out of ideas - how to harm the country even more ? 
  * central bank does not have money to support exchange rate of rouble , [ price of credits can not be raised anymore ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/12/09/2014/948670.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[item_5] ) without seriously harming economy - so there was ~ 3 % increase in usd/eur exchange rate during single trade session , we have very interesting times ahead ; * government ~ ~ went full retard ~ ~ [ officially declared prices growth is a result of increased cost of animal food ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/13/09/2014/948802.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[main_item]-[photo] ) , not reaction of free market to self-inflicted embargo ; * there is evidence [ estonian border was violated ] ( http://news.postimees.ee/2916787/evidence-border-was-violated-from-russia-into-estonia ) during abduction of their counter-intelligence agent , [ the person is being officially accused in espionage ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/11/world/europe/estonia-russia-detention/index.html?hpt=ieu_c2 ) ( it seems he has spied on russia within his own country ) ; * [ moldovan counter-intelligence found recruiters who were looking for people for transistria ] ( http://www.moldova.org/counter-intelligence-services-found-russian-recruiters-in-southern-moldova/ ) - it look like kremlin want to open western front in ukraine - and/or eastern front in moldova ; * [ hewlett-packard was fined for 58m usd ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/12/09/2014/948558.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[main_item]-[photo] ) in us for bribing bureaucrats in rufed 's attorney general 's office . 
  people in the office of attorney general pretend it 's not about them ( i.e. 
  nobody was arrested or even fired afaik ) - just like it was in similar case with mercedes/daimler company . 
  when i say this state is consist of criminals - it 's not a metaphor ; * [ governor was fired for `` losing presidential trust '' after he allowed anti-war protest ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/putin-braynask-bogomaz-denin-dimissal-afghan-war-veterans/26574315.html ) ; * [ ukrainian refugees in russia are being deported to sunny siberia and distant northern regions ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/ukrainian-refugees-to-repopulate-siberia/506624.html ) ; * finland post service is trolling russian colleagues and recipients by using [ gay stamps on packages ] ( http://www.bilerico.com/2014/09/finland_trolls_russia_with_tom_of_finland_stamps.php ) ; * [ kremlin is suing ukraine for 1 billion dollars for shooting into territory of russian federation ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rckpsg4.jpg ) . 
  it 's 1 year anniversary since i 've started to post in `` what happened '' threads . 
  it was n't us who cut off gas delivery to poland and to other countries during this week . 
  i like how kremlin use `` economic ties '' term instead of `` methods of economical warfare and corruption '' . 
  if kremlin wanted to help people they would n't destroy russian-speaking ukrainian towns and cities at the first place . 
  there is simply no version which could be called `` truth '' - because there are not even remotely independent media agencies around . 
  they all publish only information which is * allowed * . 
  and out of those rumors about trucks used to evacuate hundreds of dead bodies of russian soldiers , steal ukrainian manufacturing equipment , provide actual help , deliver troops and weapons - real help is the least believable option ( see first paragraph ) . 
   the new measures , which are expected to make it harder for russia 's big banks and state-owned oil and defense companies to raise capital , should stay in place until putin has carried out all of the essential elements of the cease-fire . 
  that means pulling out all russian troops and equipment , and agreeing to send a force of international peacekeepers , of sufficient size and strength to disarm militias and seal the border , to eastern ukraine . 
  only then can talks begin for a genuine political settlement . 
  and then , dear eu , please , do the same in moldova , georgia ( removal of invasion force a.k.a. 
  `` russian piecekeepers '' + international peacekeepers if needed ) . 
  with blackjack and hookers !, 
  actually it was supposed to be a joke - about whole europe subscribed . 
  i guess it is not funny . 
  ideally , i want to see every eu citizen subscribed to / r/europe . 
  realistically , couple millions subscribers would be fine . 
  that is only possible because nobody * need * nuclear power when there is inexpensive oil and gas from russian federation . 
  but i would n't count on kremlin to never cut supply - instead i expect them to use it as weapon sooner or later . 
  poland just sent some gas to ukraine and got their supply cut in half . 
  could germany send troops to protect baltic states from `` protective humanitarian invasion '' if kremlin will threat to cut supply of oil and gas in return ? 
  such event may ( will ? ), 
  become catastrophic for economy . 
  i 've expected more progressive mentality from germany ( because both russian and us space programs were created by german scientists ) . 
  for me it look like public opinion is being manipulated - apparently schroder is n't the only `` friend '' of kremlin in germany . 
  well , i hate to bring bad news but being a resident of russian federation i can tell you from experience : public opinion can be easily manipulated , up to the point there people are agree to go and die for a set of fairy tales about `` maidanoid jew nazis '' . 
  more mild variant may result in usage of 4000 + years old technology ( fossil fuels ) instead of modern nuclear plants . 
  edit : now with 20 % more english . 
  i heard building nuclear plants using foreign technologies is considered normal nowadays . 
  unless of course , government ( and public ) prefer to finance kremlin 's wars by buying oil and gas from russian federation ( 6 wars in 23 years ) . 
  previous german chancellor ( schroder ) liked oil and gas supplies from russian federation so much that [ we still see him here often ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/putin-hugging-gerhard-schroeder-birthday-pictures-anger-germany-amid-ukraine-crisis-9302182.html ) - almost as often as yanukovich . 
  if i was conspiracy theorist i 'd say germany is being manipulated and corrupted by kremlin and its abundant supply of oil and gas - like it happened with ukrainian government . 
  this is the only reason i can imagine - why there are so few nuclear plants compared to france ? 
  30 years old contractors are n't exactly `` kids '' , but idiots who thought they wo n't have to die for $ 1k monthly salary ( + their families forced to lie about their deaths and fsb agents live in their homes to pose as resurrected soldiers ) . 
  could be interesting to see similar map of [ russian federation ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_separatist_movements_in_europe#russia ) . 
  i 'd create it but i 'll get from 2 to 5 years in prison for that ... ... is joke . 
  note : list in wikipedia is missing at least 2 movements - so-called `` zalesie republic '' movement ( it 's small though ) and latest `` siberian republic '' [ activity ] ( http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118949/russian-prosecutor-threaten-shut-down-slon-siberian-self-determination ) . 
  congratulations , community !, 
  nice work . 
  can into space , no doubt . 
  perhaps if nato , eu , journalist did n't ignore conflicts in georgia and moldova - today they would n't look stupid when they call these warfare methods `` novelty '' .
