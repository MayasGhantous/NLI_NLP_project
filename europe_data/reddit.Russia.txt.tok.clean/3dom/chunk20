  - because immediately after news about his possible arrival massive protests started in destination city ( kharkiv ) . 
  it seems yanukovich [ fled to kharkiv ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/22/harkov/ ) ( eastern ukraine ) and [ locals are n't too happy about it ] ( http://espreso.tv/new/2014/02/21/kilka_tysyach_kharkivyan_vyyshly_na_vulyci_iz_krykamy_zeha_het ) ( `` zeka het ' ! '', 
  means `` felon out '' as yanukovich had two felony convictions ) - [ protests started in kharkiv ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s72nlnabzcy#t=66 ) which seemed relatively calm before ( if not pro-yanukovich ) . 
  rada introduced [ bill ] ( http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?pf3511=49827 ) about yanukovich 's impeachment . 
  here we go : rada introduced [ bill about yanukovich 's impeachment ] ( http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?pf3511=49827 ) ( in ukrainian ) . 
  it seems government ( or whatever remained in its place ) still has some options to consider . 
  i would n't be surprised if we 'll see him convicted - for the third time . 
  `` the right sector '' made it possible to sign this agreement today by rejecting yanokovich 's truce yesterday . 
  it looks like they know that they are doing exactly . 
  perhaps tomorrow we 'll see another agreement - less suitable for the government which is responsible for 100 deaths . 
  `` the right sector '' ( 4 most active radical organizations which rejected `` phony truce '' 2 days ago ) declared [ they 'll continue fight ] ( https://www.facebook.com/dyastrub/posts/599359316807623 ) as they do n't trust yanukovich . 
  highways to airports are [ blocked by protestors ] ( http://zyalt.livejournal.com/1006452.html ) to prevent fleeing of `` party of regions '' members and government officials from the country . 
  ~ ~ from russia ~ ~ from kremlin and government-controlled tv . 
  more or less independent internet news agencies are neutral , maybe even pro-protesters since ukrainian government is responsible for beating and shooting their colleagues ( reporters ) . 
  government-controlled tv channels and newspapers ( i.e. 
  almost all ) are heavily biased toward yanukovich to protect putin 's investments into his ukrainian colleague and doctrine of ussr reanimation . 
  also ukrainians give russians and belorussians `` bad '' ideas about riots and revolutions so protestors depicted as ruthless savages , anarchists , separatists who kill policemen because they want to destroy the government and create 2 + states instead of ukraine . 
  internet media are less dependent and publish everything they think is important . 
  russian news sites are overloaded with information from ukraine . 
  almost everyone here understand ukrainian protestors are changing future of russia . 
  64 vip jets fled from ukraine during last 36 hours as protestors have started to block highways to airports to prevent fleeing of senators , oligarchs , government from the country . 
  nope , yanukovich does n't have resources of yeltsin i.e. 
  brainwashed russian army which is ready to shoot anything including their own countrymen and parliament . 
  ~ 64 pro-yanukovich [ senators have fled from kiev ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/21/flee/ ) and [ parliament voted to stop `` anti-terrorism '' operation ] ( http://itar-tass.com/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/989805 ) + return all military forces ( including `` berkut '' ) into barracks . 
  not yet , but we definitely have a chance to see belarus going full north korea . 
  thanks for your valuable contribution to discussion about pussy riot !, 
  could be nice if you decrypt your message into plain english . 
  i guess you are living in a country with legalized marijuana , 
  he 's there for like 25-30 more years . 
  and it seems he is `` training '' his son to replace him if needed . 
  lack of progress means others are getting ahead i.e. 
  it 's actually degradation . 
  also when budget of russia wo n't have enough money ( after oil prices drop ) to pay reparations to chechnya for two lost wars - there will be third war which russia will lose again along with thousands of lives and probably whole southern region ( krasnodar - stavropol - dagestan - ingushetia - etc. ) . 
  if it 's called `` stability '' then i 'm the pope . 
  actually if 3 serious people think it 's fascist state - it 's really fascist state ( if you do n't remember - illarionov was in putin 's government ) . 
  and asking people to stop speaking is yet another feature of fascist state ( before beating and killing them ) . 
  please , continue - you are adding a lot to this discussion . 
  note : dimitarru think there are no problems in russia if dimitarru 's did n't encounter them personally , does n't understand them or does n't see them as problems ( i.e. 
  beating pussy riot girls is ok because dimitarru does n't like them ) . 
  it 's ok , i do n't even have russian citizenship . 
  i see kremlin as illegitimate usurpers who have destroyed my native country in 1991 by faking coup-d-etas to privatize property . 
  no wonder these people made children their hostages . 
  explanation of facebook post : dmitro yarosh is one of leaders of `` the right sector '' alliance which consist of rightist radical organizations - ukrainian patriot , white hammer , trizub ( trident ) , una unsd . 
  in his facebook post he claim `` someone out there is going to stop people 's uprising by faking a truce '' . 
  couple more statements : we have to finish this regime of `` internal occupation '' * . 
  our brothers in regions already have started to advance and it will allow us to resolve main issue of the revolution in kiev once and for all . 
  i 've heard mr. yanukovich declared `` anti-terrorism operation '' so `` the right sector '' is going to conduct `` forcing to peace '' actions against law enforcers . 
  \\* meaning people see this government as occupants / usurpers . 
  note : my ukrainian is weak and i could make mistakes in translation . 
  i meant people from western regions will start to fight armed instead of just throwing rocks in kiev . 
  yanukovich need time to prepare army . 
  i live in russia where i had to acquire foreign citizenship because i did n't want to brake the law and pay $ 4.5 k in bribes - common `` tax '' for russian citizenship ( even though i 'm russian and born in russia and my parents are citizens ) . 
  it 's not even a fully functional state - bureaucrats are working for themselves . 
  it 's funny you 've mentioned productivity because its level in russia is [ ~ 25-50 % of european ] ( http://sputnikipogrom.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-02_045704.png ) ( [ source ] ( http://sputnikipogrom.com/russia/5207/workforce_productivity/ ) [ +1 ] ( http://sputnikipogrom.com/russia/8022/hardwork/ ) ) , 60 % at best ( depending on trade/industry ) . 
  in agriculture productivity is 5 times lower than in canada and 6 + times lower than in brazil . 
  as employee you could do ~ 2-6 times more if you were in germany for example . 
  no wonder you feel good : working in russia is like vacation compared to developed countries , you are literally wasting 40-83 % of your work time . 
  yet another common feature with nazi germany . 
  russia is fascist state . 
  people here feel themselves insecure , inferior , useless because they can not change anything - thus irrational behavior is much more common than in `` normal '' countries . 
  you ca n't feel yourself secure having fascist state and feeling guilty for not changing anything . 
  russia is almost as closed for foreigners as it was during `` iron curtain '' - most locals will never see a single foreigner so why care at all ? 
  some see west as hostile entity - having 100 % of electronics , most food , cars , clothes imported or produced by western companies . 
  whole `` berkut '' will be out of service before the end of february if protests wo n't stop : there are 4000 people , 300 injured during 24 hours - i imagine the rest are n't too eager to continue . 
  then you have 10x more tourists ( 4mil ) than locals ( 400k ) and there is absolutely no alternatives within country - you can dictate prices . 
  sochi was n't cheap , in fact my friends from sochi spend their holidays on ski resorts in turkey , georgia , austria , ukraine because it 's cheaper ( or better ) than krasnaya polyana . 
  during last 36 hours ~ 300 `` berkut '' policemen were injured . 
  considering there are only 5.000 of them they all will be out of service in ~ 2 weeks and yanukovich will be completely defenseless . 
  so he is going to use army against protesters ( he replaced army chief who said he wo n't use military against civilians ) - which will result in western regions going into state of war . 
  it seems they have sacked at least one military base ( and , probably , weapons ) . 
  army chief is replaced with head of fleet who is most likely `` pro-russian '' and much less scrupulous . 
  i guess they are going to use army against protesters . 
  edit : if clashes continue with present pace ( ~ 300 injured in 24 hours ) `` berkut '' ( ~ 4.000 ) will be completely out of service in less than 2 weeks . 
  so use of army against protesters may become a question of life and death for yanukovich before february end . 
  he did n't reply yet and i doubt he will do it : there is official case opened around this situation and participants may be prosecuted . 
  or at least it seems so before olympics ended - after that most likely it 's pussy riot who will be jailed . 
  i can understand that considering federal government was readying separation of whole krasnodar-stavropol region during chechen wars and 98 default : they went as far as building of [ customs office near rostov-on-don ] ( http://www.km.ru/avto/2014/01/29/dorozhno-patrulnaya-sluzhba-gibdd/730964-medvezhii-antiterror-v-tsukerovoi-balke ) - similar building appeared in the end of 80s on the border of abkhazia and russia couple years before `` official '' fall of ussr . 
  if russians do that with circus performers - imagine what happens with people who actually oppose authorities ? 
  russiatoday removed it . 
  [ telegraph.co.uk made a copy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivt-i-yxtdy ) . 
  yes . 
  it 's relatively rich ( the only decent sea resort in the country ) and it 's caucasus - it 's much less `` patriotic '' than `` average '' russian provincial town . 
  note : i am familiar with sochi ( spent 10 years there ) and somehow i 'm sure militants who attacked the girls ( so called `` cossacks '' ) are n't locals - these are `` imported '' from krasnodar and stavropol regions by kremlin administration to boost `` security '' during olympics i.e. 
  to beat protesters . 
  edit : a bit more englishy now . 
  edit 2 : note to myself - never post videos from russiatoday because bastards delete them . 
  ** here is [ alternative link ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivt-i-yxtdy ) . 
  ** edit 3 : it seems i was wrong about `` imported '' `` cossacks '' - i know the militant on 2:01 in the video . 
  he is ( was ? ), 
  a friend of mine and he live in sochi ... 
  contacting him now to confirm if he participated in this shit or not ? 
  civil militants attacked car with a journalist , shot him , later he died in hospital . 
  27 journalists injured , 18 protestors and policemen dead - just hours later after kremlin confirmed transfer of $ 2 billions to yanukovich . 
  berkut is [ attacking again ] ( http://www.interfax.ru/world/txt/359196 ) ( at 2:13 local time ) - up to throwing explosives into crowd ( 2:18 ) . 
  1/3 of food prices in russia is `` corruption component '' - i.e. 
  food could be 33 % cheaper with less corrupted government . 
  it 's like country feed 40 millions invisible people ( +1 child in every family ) . 
  position of russia on any stage does n't matter when it cost you additional $ 150-300 every month ( besides hidden 35 % personal income tax which is paid by companies based on salaries , 13 % additional `` obvious '' income tax , vat , relatively high customs fees , etc ) . 
  there were good economic news from leading countries - major investors started to dump assets in 3rd world countries to relocate them to us/france/germany / etc. 
  banks in customs union could barely hold amount of national currency flooding currency exchange ( there was a day when central bank in russia sold 1bil usd - ny currency exchange trade $ 250-300mil daily afaik ) .
