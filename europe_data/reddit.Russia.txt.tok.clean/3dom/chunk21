  kazakhs do n't have enough currency reserves and devalued national currency - 3rd time during last 15 years . 
  bureaucrats in russia do n't care about jobs at all - they are sponsored from kremlin directly . 
  thus some people in russia believe kremlin government is occupant - up to ideas like `` putin & co did that hitler wanted '' ( note : many features of modern russian state are the same as hitler planned for slavic states - like paid education ) . 
  from my experience : do not allow links/comments karma drop below -1 . 
  it 's discouraging and for every poster there are like 10-100 voters - primary idea of social sites is to encourage posting , while in reality voters are doing exactly the opposite ( if site allow them ) . 
  ** russia ** - olympics in sochi and bad economy results : * bureaucrats demand [ to destroy pepsico plant ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/10/snos/ ) in novosibirsk ( 1.35 bil worth ) for ridiculous reasons ( i bet actual reason is refusal of pepsi to pay additional bribes after they 've purchased the plant from previous owner ) ; * sales of gaz and vaz cars [ dropped by 21 % ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/10/down/ ) in january compared to previous year ; * robbers stole [ ~ 7.5 mil usd ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/12/bank/ ) / 5mil + euro from bank in saint petersburg ( 250mil roubles , other sources report 150mil ) - this is second big successful robbery in spb during last 6 months afaik ; * high taxes [ lowered amount of registered individual entrepreneurs to 2008 level ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/12/entrepreneur/ ) ( drop by 12.5 % during 2013 - from 4 to 3.5 mil ) ; * ecological [ activist was jailed during olympics ] ( http://lenta.ru/articles/2014/02/12/vitishko/ ) for previously committed crime ( he was on probation ) - signs on a fence of building which allegedly belong to governor tkachev in krasnodar region ( sochi ) ; * a person was [ fined for cursing ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/14/culturecapital/ ) another person in social network ( ~ 90 $ / 60 euro fine ) - i believe it 's first precedent ; * related news from kazakhstan : central bank ~ ~ stole 20 % of money ~ ~ [ devalued national currency by 20 % ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/11/shops/ ) ; * related news : [ ukrainian state security service opened investigation against authorities in crimea ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/11/regions/ ) who asked russia to use army in ukraine . 
  i guess it can be classified as treason , crimean lawmakers says it 's security service who betrayed ukraine . 
  update : latvian media says [ results of russian skeletonist ] ( http://rus.delfi.lv/news/zimnjaja-olimpiada/novosti/na-ltv-obraschayut-vnimanie-na-strannyj-razgon-tretyakova.d?id=44220823 ) are false as he had exactly the same acceleration time ( 4.47 s ) in all 4 attempts - which is impossible . 
  even though i grew up in a house full of albums with paintings of van eyck , rubens , van dyck - when i thought about belgium first painting i recalled was [ the son of man ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_son_of_man ) by ren\u00e9 magritte . 
  it 's influence of hollywood i guess . 
  i thought it must be [ birth of venus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_birth_of_venus_%28botticelli%29 ) - it 's famous and it 's in italy .

  by the way there is another painting which is very well known ( but a bit less than mitw a.k.a. 
  `` bears in the north '' which was even on candy ) - '' [ \u0414\u0435\u0432\u044f\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0430\u043b ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:hovhannes_aivazovsky_-_the_ninth_wave_-_google_art_project.jpg ) '' ( ninth wave ) by aivazovsky .

  it 's a trap . 
  the law is still there , you may be prosecuted for gay propaganda for hugging gay people on camera in russia . 
   after being questioned for about an hour he was allowed to go , but $ 1,000 was missing . 
  common practice for police in sochi . 
  he should be grateful he had any money at all in the end - unlike me and some of my friends . 
  if you are drunk enough ( very easy to achieve in hot climate ) these guys may steal even personal belongings - like watches and jewelry . 
  group was filming a movie in caucasus mountains and there was giant mudflow in the night which killed them all . 
  there are many depending on country of origin . 
  for example [ knockin ' on heaven 's door ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119472/ ) - germany [ the 5th element ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116 ) + [ 99 franks ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0875113/ ) - france [ m\u00e4n som hatar kvinnor ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132620/ ) a.k.a. 
  the girl with the dragon tattoo + [ arn : tempelriddaren ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0837106/ ) - sweden [ the pianist ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0253474/ ) - uk/france/poland / germany and of course [ vikings ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2306299/ ) tv series ( ireland / canada ) . 
  edit : the pianist . 
  ca n't believe i could forget it . 
  he is still free afaik . 
  i 've forgot to mention - he was cuffed to a metal handle on back sit and broke it . 
  however i think police officer may lie about imitation of heart attack - there is high chance they just left the guy unattended and are trying to cover their arses with heart attack story . 
  though they did n't go far and their story can be true : during escape one of them hooked to the car and it dragged him for ~ 300m . 
  cold climate require to run engine for few minutes to warm up its moving parts + interior before driving and people use remotes to start up cars without getting outside into -20 -30 c temperatures . 
  such modifications certainly are n't uncommon here and considering fact all cars are being inspected every year ( afaik ) by road police - it must be legal .

  edit : more english and [ `` problem fixed '' olympic t-shirt ] ( http://i.imgur.com/e1wwa2n.png ) . 
  i 've never heard of such usage of this word . 
  i think it 's cultural reference to this exact movie . 
  yes , there is a link . 
  '' \u0416\u043c\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0438 '' is the name of hide-and-seek game , '' \u0436\u043c\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043a '' is a slang for `` dead '' - from verb '' \u0436\u043c\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f '' ( to close eye ) .

  [ brother ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118767/ ) + [ brother 2 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238883/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) both have historically accurate depiction of the country and most popular beliefs of population + lifestyle in early and late 90s . 
  sadly , leading actor died in tragic accident and we wo n't see third movie about modern `` putin-controlled '' russia . 
  also '' [ \u0416\u043c\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0438 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420982/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) '' show the same period of time as brother-1 but more comically . 
  russia and venezuela are n't poor . 
  germany was very poor after wwii yet there was minimal corruption ( afaik ) . 
  for me it 's all about mentality and motivation . 
  i thought bad governments are bad for poor countries - not freedom . 
  snap me like one of your french girls . 
  man , it 's more popular than / r/sochi, 
  either human rights declaration and constitution ( fair public court trial ) works for all or for no one - and `` no one '' variant is exactly that happens in russia where your case in court in 99.7 % of cases result in a sentence and actual `` trial '' process is n't even remotely fair or transparent when it 's performed by uncontrollable police and fsb . 
  / edit he could knew and give up sponsors . 
  or he was just a `` scapegoat '' to pacify public ( it 's common practice for police in russia - to accuse random bum in 10-30 crimes for better statistics ) . 
  or there was n't any killing and fsb is just lying to public - we can not know this for sure as there are no independent trustworthy media and reporters while authorities are corrupted beyond any comprehension . 
  that 's 0.75 % of gdp or ~ 240 euros per citizen . 
  edit : to compare - eu military budget is ~ 200bln euros or 400 euro per citizen . 
  yes . 
  result is lack of course and development for this particular society ( because capitalism here is suppressed and does not provide any development as well ) . 
  lack of mental progress of elite during last ~ 150 years . 
  i 've read some quotes from 18xx-1915 - it 's like people described today 's situation . 
  example - very old proverb ( mistakenly quoted as phrase by saltykov-schedrin ) : \u0437\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043e \u043f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435 - \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0442 , \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0447\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c / when they talk about patriotism they are going to steal something . 
  these `` gas '' grenades were very popular during two chechen wars . 
  warhead weight 2kg + and travel as far as 1-1 .7 km at 120m/s speed - it * will * kill simply by impact . 
  not to mention 1000c volumetric explosion in the end . 
  it 's -25 c here .

  ukraine [ manufacture icbms for russia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r-36_%28missile%29 ) . 
  expect a lot of russian intervening + other major powers silently giving them carte-blanche to keep status quo . 
  there are no russian naval bases in abkhazia . 
  base in sevastopol was n't created as foreign . 
  the only foreign ( non-cis ) russian naval base is in damask , syria . 
  that 's called `` alliance '' and it 's the primary reason why putin & co give a crap about situation . 
  p. s. note : comment above is a good example how state propaganda affect people in russia . 
   russia is not soviet union . 
  modern russia is worse in many ways . 
  like lack of ideology affecting economic course ( mix of capitalism , fascism , socialism ) + explicit corruption in the government and especially among lower level officials ( policemen on porsches ) .
