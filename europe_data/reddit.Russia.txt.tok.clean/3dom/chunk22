  if i were asked which government i trust more ? 
  - i 'd say it was ussr 's politburo despite their rule ended up with staged coup-d-etas to steal whole county and place present - extremely strange - regime on the throne . 
  so for any ( non-corrupted ) government eu is preferred as long-term partner rather than russia . 
  at least eu is much less corrupted and already left fascism in the past ( except for greece maybe ) . 
  joining eu may result in unwanted investigations . 
  the only way for the government to keep stolen billions is to keep country separated from civilized world . 
  | we know there has been downplaying by the russian media to show the protests . 
  it may seem laughably stupid , but its media and i guess they 're doing to not to worry and frustrate millions of our citizens who have relatives in ukraine . 
  it will be very difficult to find people who will take this explanation seriously . 
  this government does n't give a crap about feelings of people who have relatives in ukraine . 
  russian media downplay ukrainian protests because this government is barely able to control situation ( protests in biryuliovo paralised moscow for couple days - after just single murder ) and do n't want to provoke population which applaud during scenes of kremlin exploding in movies . 
  edit : moar english . 
  media reports [ `` catapult '' is dead ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/01/21/broke/ ) . 
  it 's like portugal is in eastern europe . 
  strange . 
  ( whole `` $ 2k + salary '' `` island '' is so tiny compared to the rest of the poor world ), 
  progress never happens without drawbacks . 
  it 's like not making children because they cost money and lower quality of life of parents - if you measure quality of life by amount of money spent per person . 
  would you * buy * a citizenship in your present country if you had a choice and cost was the same across the globe ? 
  i imagine life could be much better if governments * had * to make countries competitive on `` citizenship market '' . 
  at least we could have clear measurement for government 's effectiveness ( amount of citizenships sold per year ) - besides gdp which does n't tell anything about quality of life . 
  also additional money for economy . 
  size does n't matter - russian culture is very homogenous across the country . 
  i believe it 's orthodox christian ( byzantine ) culture where everything is allowed and there is no firm morale thus every action has multiple interpretations and a saint can be considered a cause of problems ( for example country could convert to catholicism and could be in eu by now if alexander nevsky was n't successful in that battle - some people actually do n't praise him as hero but instead considering him a conformist who preferred mongols to europe / catholicism ) . 
   * if i recall , is n't korolyov a more phonetically accurate translation ? 
  i think there is actually no way to transcript '' \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0451\u0432 '' in english so many variants can be used . 
  wikipedia article about man has `` korolev '' variant , about town - `` korolyov '' . 
  country does n't have a comprehensible beneficial course and strong morale principles . 
  without them there is no way to appraise if actions had positive or negative effect . 
  for example there are somewhat popular opinions about stalin was totally wrong when sacrificed almost 1/6 of population in wwii and country could be much better now if germans won the war and replaced local culture with their own . 
  another good example of controversial russian history : alexander nevsky rejected offer of swedes to overthrow mongol rule together and instead fought swedes and defended mongol dictatorship - now he 's orthodox saint ( + mongols assigned [ his son ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daniel_of_moscow ) as ruler of moscow and so he created basement of modern russian state ) . 
  `` i wish your country had its own lenin and trotsky '' sounds like a curse rather than a blessing . 
  these guys were destructive . 
  gagarin and korolev + all people behind them . 
  year , right near [ explosive charges ] ( http://boingboing.net/2012/06/19/switzerland-is-one-gigantic-bo.html ) . 
  perhaps there is less competition for serious movies : i 'm trying to recall if i 've seen any light family-friendly movies from poland , uk , spain and i do n't remember any ( though i remember a lot of french , italian comedies with de funes , celentano , richard , mastoianni , depardieu , clavier ) . 
  edit : there are `` mr. 
  but they doe n't look like 8.5 movies . 
  light family-friendly movies get higher ratings . 
  when in moscow you should visit [ pushkin museum ] ( http://www.arts-museum.ru/poster/exhibitions/?lang=en ) , [ tretyakovskaya gallery ] ( http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/en/ ) , kremlin ( [ diamond fund ] ( http://www.moscow.info/museums/state-diamond-fund.aspx ) + the armory ) + cosmonaut museum in korolyov ( not in moscow , in korolyov you can see actual space crafts ) . 
  in spb - [ kunstkamera ] ( http://www.kunstkamera.ru/en/ ) museum + ex-royal palaces . 
  besides baikal there are interesting locations in kamchatka - there you can see active volcanoes . 
  there are also certain infamous phenomena locations like [ tunguska ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tunguska_event ) and [ dyatlov 's pass ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dyatlov_pass_incident ) . 
  thought you might want to skip them because either nothing will happen or you 'll be abducted by aliens , turn into aliens after inhumane experiments or will be simply eaten by bears . 
  for geologists and palaeontologists russia is a paradise . 
  but they surely know it already . 
  edit : korolyov museum . 
  i imagine there will be news some 30-50 years later `` moscow state forgave belarus its 500bil debt to russia '' - just like it happens now with `` debts '' of cuba , venezuela , etc. 
  to ussr . 
  new year happened . 
  there is interesting coincidence : after terrorist act in domodedovo airport fsb got ~ 1.5 bil usd financing to boost safety of transportation and this financing ended ... yesterday , december , 31 . 
  but after these new terrorist acts fsb will get couple more billions for sure . 
  evil must be personalized and named - to pacify masses . 
  however when fsb blames a person that nobody seen in years - that is a very bad sign because it means they do n't have any clues who it really was ? 
  ( as if we did n't learn about their incompetence when they 've f * d up and allowed second/third explosion on the next day ), 
  imagine how bad is he at everything else if he can not even organize fsb to prevent serial terrorist acts ? 
  ( it 's his field of expertise ), 
  olivier salad , pelmeni , and some alcohol . 
  a lot of alcohol . 
  partially because there is no legal way to protest effectively in russia . 
  this government does n't react to citizens ' initiatives in timely manner until material damage is done - be it riots/pogroms or terrorist acts - and certain people see these methods as the only way to change anything in this country . 
  i guess some people may call these terrorists `` freedom fighters '' or `` patriots '' ( though i think in the case with volgograd there are mostly religious/separatist motives i.e. 
  it 's not about patriotism but stupidity ) . 
  there was security lockdown after explosion in sunday - or at least it was declared so . 
  and this lockdown did not prevent second explosion . 
  perhaps there will be more . 
  explosions are linked to dagestan which is barely controllable separatist region i. e. it 's more like warzone . 
  edit : even if saudis are linked to this event they did n't need to do ( or pay ) a lot to motivate locals in dagestan to become terrorists . 
  dagestan is strange and chaotic culture ( russian proverb : `` where dags - there problems '' ) and people there do n't need a lot of foreign `` help '' to become terrorists . 
  also lately russians are joining terrorist groups in caucasus region ... 
  new explosion in a bus , 10 dead and 15 wounded . 
  this is 3rd terrorist act during last 2 months and second during last 24 hours . 
  apparently there is well-organized terrorist group in the city . 
  note : `` garrison department '' in google 's translation actually means `` department store for a military base '' . 
  edit : [rt.com article ] ( http://rt.com/news/russia-volgograd-trolley-blast-957/ ) . 
  some people never grow up and it 's ok . 
  but in russia such people can make it into government and control nuclear weapons ... 
  i 'm trying to not to think about situation where specialists can not understand if they see remains of 13 , 15 or 18 people ? 
  my sincere and deepest condolences to survivors and relatives of victims . 
  i guess that was n't the last terrorist act since fsb can not do shit about them : they knew who was the woman - a friend of the woman who exploded in a bus few months ago - and could n't prevent her doing that . 
  probably they are too busy extorting money from businesses and wiretapping whole population . 
  they do n't care about actual meaning - they just need to distract population from real problems . 
  like corrupted ineffective government which can not stop country 's fall into recession despite still sky-high gas and oil prices . 
  like fsb unable to stop terrorists despite they knew who was the woman which exploded in volgograd today and they knew she 's dangerous . 
  like horrendous `` quality '' of roads and `` free '' social medical `` care '' . 
  bills and taxes the same or higher than in developed countries while salaries are 2-5 times lower . 
  so it can be used in economic warfare again . 
  khodorkovsky 's wife does n't know his location . 
  officials explain he 's in germany ( how exactly he could get visa that fast ? ) . 
  i wonder if this is a giant spectacle to convince people kremlin did n't kill him or khodorkovsky really decided to give up idea to sacrifice his life for an idea and did n't tell anyone ? 
  reminds me about people re-appearing after repressions in `` 1984 '' . 
  edit : it turns out he 's alive and well and actually [ asked to release him ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/12/20/letter/ ) . 
  it 's all very strange . 
  his company was confiscated but he still has like $ 1.2 bil so he pose extreme danger for present kremlin administration : browder managed to create magnitsky act having the same amount of money . 
  i think he did n't ask for a pardon because his family , lawyer , and penitentiary system itself did n't know about it before putin 's declaration . 
  i think something unprecedented is happening within kremlin administration that forced them to change their course 180 degrees almost overnight and release pussy riot , khodorkovsky and few people from `` bolotnoe case '' . 
   in the top 15 countries facing real terrorism threats . 
  i bet real state border with alien and de-facto independent islamic enclaves ( chechnya , ingushetia , dagestan , tajikistan , etc. ), 
  could fix that immediately . 
  he 's kidding because in russia spying on citizens is legal and every isp and cell services provider has to keep all users ' data ( logins-passwords , credit card numbers , messages , voice data , etc. ),
