  it 's interesting how russia is using money from sales of gas to eu to bribe ukrainian government and prevent ukraine from joining eu . 
  human normally can not sit like that - there is a lot of discomfort . 
  however when i 've smoke in college i quickly developed this `` slavsquat '' posture because something is happening with muscular system which removes discomfort and at the same time legs feel tired / weak all the time . 
  tl ; dr person who sits like that is smoking pot . 
  yup , it 's always the same position : population itself does not have free will and is ready to tolerate any shit government has to offer , if there is unrest - it 's paid by enemies of the state . 
  perhaps people do n't like idea of building anything with russia . 
  ca n't blame them , russia in present state is destructive even for itself . 
  it seems yanukovich is changing government 's priorities every week - third week in a row ( eu -  ru -  eu again ) . 
  next week : back to russia . 
  i prefer symbol before numbers . 
  $ 10 is better aesthetically than 10 $ 3 . 
  after . 
  after . 
  upvoting you for others to see this comment because this opinion is common in russia . 
  though i feel like you are actually ukrainian . 
  it can be ukrainian poster alluring negative reaction towards russia . 
  unfortunately , it is . 
  unless you are going to start a revolution , we 'll see ukraine joining customs union and it will be a triumph of putin 's neo-imperialism policy and the end of our hopes to see both ukraine and russia in eu . 
  welcome ~ ~ back to ussr ~ ~ to customs union , comrade !, 
  i feel eu is not ready to unite europe - lacking ambitions and methods to do so . 
  it makes me sad - i had hopes to see european mega-state during my life . 
  now i think i 'll see soviet union ii instead . 
  it 's interesting how government brainwashed almost whole nation to believe abkhazia and south ossetia with a handful of people are real states and ukraine is n't . 
  i can confirm this - people do n't even have a concept of `` bad nationalism '' . 
  it is perceived as normal to refer to other ethnic groups and nationalities using racial slur when speaking privately and sometimes publicly . 
  example : `` opposition leader '' navalny used term `` rodents '' ( '' \u0433\u0440\u044b\u0437\u0443\u043d\u044b '' ) to refer to georgians ( ~ 2 millions of them live in russia by the way ) . 
  however it 's related to the nature of present political regime ( fascism ) and situation where whole population / nation is being oppressed by the government ( example : russians are afaik the only ethnic group in europe which does n't have jus sanguinis ) . 
  people are angry but can not protest `` officially '' so we can witness various destructive behavior patterns . 
  i guess people believe ( sometimes unconsciously ) they 'll live better - or at least they 'll be less oppressed - after country/nation collapse along with the government so it looks like everyone is trying to do their best to destroy this country - or at least do n't care if it 'll fall apart ( again ) . 
  edit : second paragraph . 
  this stability look like a walk on a very thin ice because it does n't have any actual source of income besides oil and gas - country itself is barely producing anything but some basic foods and cars from imported components . 
  the only actual stability i see are hyperinflating prices for food , transportation , electricity , water ( certain groups of products raised in price up to 30-40 % during this year , transportation cost and utility bills are up 15-30 % each year + now government want advance payments for electricity and water ) . 
  110 people own 35 % of mation 's wealth i.e. 
  everyone could be 50 % more rich - including millionaires - without this 110 oligarchs who work as purses for corrupted government and its actual politburo masters . 
  corruption of this regime has destroyed the fabric of society and people 's minds : people are n't even trying to start business anymore , those who have one are scared * less ( up to refusal of whitehat businesses to do any advertisement to avoid attracting officials ' attention ) . 
  country is on a verge of decades-long financial recession - even by overly optimistic prognosis of the government itself . 
  not to mention this regime simply stole whole country from its population in 1991 by faking kgb 's coup-d-etas . 
  to put it mild - i do n't like this regime . 
  it 's destructive . 
  i hope that means ukraine is still going to sign up associate agreement with eu during next week ( and that 's why they do n't receive semi-free gas from russia ) . 
  yes , it 's in far east . 
  place was artificially created by stalin . 
  it 's jewish only by its name - not many people wanted to move there . 
  however local media trumped this situation as major victory of russian politics . 
  i hope they are wrong .

  situation in other countries must be * really * bad if russia is on top of them . 
  jus sanguinis does n't work for people of other nationalities . 
  my ancestors were n't germans ( polish-ukrainian-russian ) . 
  my great-grandfather fought and died for hitler ( while his son - my grandfather - fought for red army ) but somehow i guess it does n't add any bonus points for me . 
  [ dirndls ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/dirndls/ ) oktoberfest is a-must-visit festival . 
  german police use less bullets during a year than us police may use in single shooting episode . 
  my favorite country in eu , yet most complicated language to learn . 
  my mother was born there , unfortunately this fact does n't give me a right to ask for citizenship =(, 
  it was relatively calm week ( economy is getting noticeable worse during last 3 years - recession was just a matter of time ) . 
  if ukraine will sign that agreement with eu in a week - there will be actual shitstorm . 
  corruption is getting worse while oil/gas prices do n't grow anymore . 
  couple months ago i 've seen an article where economist said 30 % of food prices in russia are `` corruption component '' . 
  i bet other goods and services are affected as well . 
  without corruption country could fully support +40 millions people i.e. 
  poland-sized country can be fed , clothed , `` car-ed '' , educated , etc. 
  using money stolen by this state on daily basis . 
  it 's derivative/diminutive/slang from term '' \u043c\u043e\u0448\u043d\u0430 '' which means `` purse '' and must be common for all slavic languages . 
  please , do n't give up . 
  if ukraine will join eurasian union situation will be much worse . 
  nobody use that term in real life actually - except for medics . 
   being refugees will be relatively easier for you guys ... 
  thanks for advice !, 
  in my home region ( abkhazia ) shit is almost as bad as in somalia . 
  probably i should n't wait for a revolution in russia and just ask for asylum in eu because russia did n't bother to do anything during 21 years since war started ... 
  they are not illegal . 
  but they are cheap ( $ 10 ) , you can buy them in every automotive shop and people give them up easily just to please the policemen - who feel better about not doing their real job to catch actual criminals . 
  thank you !, 
  [ corrected the link ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/11/04/eleven/ ), 
  what kind of article needed ? 
  here is [ their site ] ( http://www.economy.gov.ru/minec/main ) ( [ about the ministry ] ( http://www.economy.gov.ru/wps/wcm/connect/economylib4/mer/about/rukdocmin/index/ ) ) + source [ article about mentioned pessimistic prognosis ] ( http://www.itar-tass.com/c1/945613.html ) by itar-tass agency + [ `` why we are f * d more than usually '' explanation ] ( http://lenta.ru/columns/2013/11/08/prognose/ ) from lenta.ru, 
  they are not interesting in revolution + they do n't have free ( political ) will because they are major part of present corrupted system and helped to build it . 
  instead of creating an opposition they 've created yet another support system for present regime . 
  business is suppressed because it may develop to compete with oligarchs , oil and gas alone can not sustain country 's economy . 
  yes . 
  there is relatively sfw photo in the article .
