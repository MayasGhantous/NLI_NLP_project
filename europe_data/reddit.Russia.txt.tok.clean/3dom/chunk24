  nope . 
  there were attempts to create such song but they are n't commonly known + some russian letters simply can not be articulated ( \u044c \u044a ) . 
  small town ( 10k residents ) 25km from moscow , russia 25mbit landline 15 $ per month ( 60mbit cost $ 25 ) ping to eu game servers is 40-80ms ( apb and planetside 2 for example ) , 80-120ms to us, 
  no need to wait that long : present government is a good enough reason to be ashamed for population 's inability to control its own country . 
  it 's like this government is at war with everyone - including country 's population . 
  `` 50 % '' = information from lenta.ru ( interview of moscow 's head of police ) published couple weeks ago . 
  main accent was on migrants from russian caucasus ( i.e. 
  citizens ) are committing most crimes among migrants , foreigners from ` stans are relatively peaceful . 
  edit : [ example of typical article ] ( http://rosprof.ru/news/a-2819.html ) about crimes and migrants ( august ) . 
  eurasian union is the primary goal for this government + belarus is `` friendly '' state so it seems government is ready to forgive them anything . 
  ploce cooperation is n't part of the deal yet ( within customs union ) . 
  probably because west is n't that friendly . 
  or at least it does n't seem so after stories how people are spending 10-17 years to get citizenship . 
  india , thailand , latin america could work too . 
  thanks , but i do n't really have the question `` where to go ? '' . 
  anything will work - except for war zones and fascist regimes . 
  content of the news changed : in the first article it was russian diplomat ( when the government needed a reason to create hysteria around netherlands ) , now it 's just random guy on vacation . 
  i 'm packing already - can not live in real-life version of `` 1984 '' , ready to go anywhere . 
  it 's not about people , it 's about government 's doctrine to make the empire bigger at all costs . 
  they are trying to please governments of potential participants ( ` stans ) of customs union - surely those are not happy to join a country where population specifically riot against crimes committed by migrants from islamic regions ( who are actually responsible for 50 % of crimes in bigger cities ) . 
  there is no place for coincidences in diplomatic warfare . 
  or at least in rumors about diplomatic warfare . 
  tbh it all looks like well/ill-thought turns in a game of chess . 
  he failed to do anything with netherlands ( if he had any free will at all ) .

  edit : some corrections both in english and in the content ( meaning of the news in russia changes dramatically over time depending on political situation - probably i should read every article and follow-ups for better synopsis ) . 
  no info . 
  media follow information from police/fsb which focused on terrorist and numbers ( 6 dead , 30 in hospitals ) . 
  terrorism . 
  woman is linked to extremist group . 
  located on the shore of caspian sea . 
  common borders with iran , turkey , armenia , georgia . 
  some oil , pipeline from kazakhstan to georgia , turkey and europe . 
  conflict with armenia over [ karabakh ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nagorno-karabakh ) [ harry kasparov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kasparov ) [ maiden tower ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maiden_tower_%28baku%29 ), 
  woman activated explosive belt , 5 dead , 20 + in hospitals . 
  some [ details in russian ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/10/21/vid/ ) . 
  i believe root of all problems in russia is illegitimate government ( coup-d-etas in 1991 was staged by politburo to privatize the country ) which consists of criminals who do n't care about anything but income of their employers ( and their own income ) . 
  so they perceived `` attack '' on gas platform as personal attack on their own private property ( because gazprom * is * their private property ) - hence overreaction which look like personal vendetta . 
  edit : english . 
  story by [ navalny himself ] ( http://navalny-en.livejournal.com/29276.html ) in his blog . 
  here is [ brief chronology ] ( http://en.ria.ru/russia/20130416/180673423.html ) . 
  you can find more materials in google using `` navalny kirovles '' combination . 
  there are 3-10 millions of illegal immigrants in the country + a lot of legal ( ized ) . 
  and even with that much additional labor force economy is stagnating . 
  it seems this time it was a leak of actual plan . 
  actually there are many `` normal '' news here ( like meteorite extraction ) - just they pale in comparison with the activity of this government . 
  i believe authorities think conflict is initiated by netherlands as revenge for arrested greenpeace crew . 
  population do n't care and/or mostly believe in official version ( `` euro-gays hate our freedom to exploit arctic gas , we have to avenge our diplomat severely beaten by dutch police '' ) . 
  note : few days prior to incident with dutch diplomat in moscow zhirinovsky openly said `` let 's beat some dutch diplomats '' - such behavior is a crime even in russia but this government is above the law . 
  edit : english . 
  there was an incident in august when police entered a market ( migrant enclave ) and was beaten by locals while corrupted local policemen just watched the `` show '' . 
  government realized they can not control 10 + millions of foreign workers and started campaign against them including something like prohibition for children to attend school if parents do n't have citizenship . 
  whole crew is jailed - 30 people including ukrainian cook and russian reporter . 
  ** russia ** - week of riots and diplomatic conflict with netherlands * greenpeace scandal grew up into `` diplomatic warfare '' : russian [ diplomat was detained ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/10/17/compensation/ ) in the netherlands week earlier for drunken abuse of his children ; ( gay ) ambassador of the netherlands in moscow was [ robbed and beaten ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1onell/senior_gay_dutch_diplomat_60_tied_down_and_beaten/ ) , later [ russian diplomat was robbed in netherlands ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/10/18/house/ ) ; * lawmakers want to [ prohibit having children for gay parents ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/10/20/again/ ) ; * all russian lawmakers officially closed all their foreign bank accounts - except for those whos [ accounts are under arrest ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/10/17/deputtees/ ) in various countries ; * week started from [ riots in moscow ] ( http://www.forbes.ru/news/246245-pochti-300-chelovek-zaderzhany-v-khode-aktsii-u-metro-prazhskaya ) after a murder of local resident by ( allegedly ) immigrant from caucasus ( [ video by aljazeera ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1otshx/inside_story_race_riots_a_wakeup_call_for_russia/ ) ) ; note : government is [ trying to push ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/10/19/raid/ ) 3-10mil illegal ( and god knows how many legal ) immigrants away from the country since august ; * suddenly , immediately after riots [ police found a guy from azerbaijan ] ( http://lenta.ru/articles/2013/10/17/orhan/ ) to blame for the murder and is [ trying to convince ] ( http://lenta.ru/articles/2013/10/17/orhan/ ) everyone he 's not an innocent bystander ( in russia it 's common practice for the police to convict a random bum for 10-20 crimes at once - to improve statistic - while the bum is getting free shelter and food - it 's `` win-win '' scenario ) ; * government is trying to punish 4 young men who participated in riots ( and broke few windows ) with 7 years jail terms for the mistakes in government 's immigration policy while blaming [ local authorities for everything ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/10/16/sobyanin1/ ) ; * ( every ) ** friday is now `` anti-immigration '' day in moscow ** - there will be more patrols on streets [ including commercial security agencies and volunteers ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/10/18/check/ ) ( i guess military patrols coming soon ) ; * ministry of foreign affairs [ questioned costa-rican ambassador ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/10/16/mid/ ) for an extradition of russian criminal into us ; the criminal allegedly laundered $ 6bil and can be jailed for 20 years in us ; i guess those $ 6bil belong to the russian government and there are much more money to launder ( for example those 20 billions euro stored as random cargo in an airport which i 've mentioned last week ) - otherwise why would they start this scandal using official channels ? 
  * `` opposition leader '' navalny got 5 years of probation - literally for [ bad advice ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/10/16/refuse/ ) ; * navalny published documents about [ rogozin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dmitry_rogozin ) ( top government official , ex-ambassador in nato ) is sponsoring a deal to purchase 400 glock handguns for russian spetznaz - for $ 7k each ( ~ 4 times higher than it should be ) , rogozin [ calls bullshit ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/10/20/rogozin/ ) - i 'm sure he 's lying ( otherwise where would be a court case ) ; * 3rd quarter resulted in [ 0 % gdp growth ] ( http://www.itar-tass.com/c16/914486.html ) , country is on brink of recession ; * polish sculptor placed '' [ raping ( russian ) soldier ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ooxyc/russian_ambassador_slams_wartime_rape_sculpture/ ) '' sculpture in a public park in poland , there is small diplomatic conflict around it ; * [ 150 children ] ( http://ria.ru/incidents/20131019/971182269.html ) in perm were checked by medics after food poisoning , 84 were hospitalized ; * today road workers created an ice field on the road in moscow , [ 30 cars crashed ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/10/20/nakedice/ ) ; * russian boxer became [ wbo champion ] ( http://lenta.ru/articles/2013/10/20/provodnikov/ ) in < 63.5 kg category ; * [ two competing russians spent ~ $ 210k in a bar ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/1onzi5/two_competing_russian_groups_at_a_bar_i_do_work/ ) - [ photo of 2 checks ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vvkvcmx.jpg ) ; * [ divers recovered a chunk of meteorite ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1okesz/divers_have_recovered_what_may_be_a_570kg_chunk/ ) which exploded in chelyabinsk in february ( ~ 1k locals were lightly injured after explosion ) ; * there was funny flick '' [ russian darts ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1oht3i/russian_darts/ ) '' in r/videos - if you 've missed it . 
  a lot of links - there might be errors . 
  report if you 'll find any mistakes and i 'll fix them . 
  very useful information . 
  thank you !, 
  yup - that 's my plan b ( belarus ) . 
  which may result in 2 years jail term for illegal ( passport-less ) crossing of state borders . 
  i 'm trying to get georgian passport remotely ( plan a ) but time ( money ) is running out and this passport will be illegal in russia . 
  first could be nice to get out of russia . 
  i 'm trapped here . 
  ca n't live and can not leave . 
  abkhazia is just a `` vaporstate '' , there is nothing formal . 
  georgia is at war with russia , their embassy in moscow is formally closed . 
  technically i 'm not russian - my papers says i 'm citizen of the country which vanished 22 years ago . 
  that 's for citizens of russian federation . 
  i 'm not a citizen . 
  ca n't go to abkhazia , people die there `` accidentally '' . 
  also - again : abkhazia is not a country , it does not function as a state despite russian government 's claims . 
  their `` embassy '' in moscow is just a building with random people who call themselves `` diplomats '' to create an illusion of functioning state . 
  thank you !, 
  hopefully i 'll end up in europe instead of russian jail , 
  parents did n't lose their passports and went through years-long procedure . 
  my grandmother died without getting citizenship during 20 years - she could n't gather all required documents . 
  currently russian state see me as abkhazian `` citizen '' i.e. 
  i can stay on the territory of the country and do n't need visa to enter . 
  problem is abkhazia is n't really a state and i can not get their passport while georgian passport will make me absolutely illegal and may result in jail term . 
  yes , i had many conversations with lawyers starting from 1994 . 
  in short : russian state assumes i have foreign citizenship and demand passport from me while i do n't have any . 
  and if i 'll get georgian passport ( and citizenship ) from ( now closed ) embassy in moscow - i 'll become ( even more ) illegal immigrant and will have to move out of the country ( i want to do exactly this ) . 
  just russian federation treat russians who fled from ex-ussr republics as aliens - there is no `` russian state '' where i could just claim citizenship being a `` native majority '' by blood - jus sanguinis - as almost every other nationality in the world can do . 
  cars , phones , drugs ( medicine ) , food , clothing cost almost the same everywhere . 
  that 's because salaries there are 60-70 % lower than in germany for example . 
  parents are russian citizens . 
  birth certificate , parents ' citizenship does not matter - russian authorities consider me a foreigner . 
  thanks for the idea !, 
  greece is a wonderful region but i need a job ( programmer ) - not sure if there are many available for non-natives . 
  i was born in ussr/russia but at the moment of ussr fall i was in abkhazia / georgia ( family had a house there ) and after the war began i fled to russia . 
  my documents were lost and it 's impossible to receive russian citizenship without any documents . 
  it is possible however to get georgian citizenship - but it will make me even more illegal in russia than i am now ( countries are practically at war with each other ) . 
  thanks for the tip !, 
  at the moment i 'd be happy to go just anywhere else ( except for war zones - got enough of that already ) : there will be certain troubles with crossing russian border since i 'm still unable to make proper documents ( since ussr fall ) . 
   you still live in russia ? 
  yes . 
  not for long though . 
  do n't want to sit here till a civil war begin . 
   it 's never possible that their own diplomat beat up his children quite the opposite - it 's considered normal behavior ( by some conservative idiots ) .
