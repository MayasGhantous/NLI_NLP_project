  that 's why russian state reacted like that - they think police in netherlands is just being mean in response to greenpeace scandal when they detained russian diplomat for `` child abuse '' . 
  there is simply no crime like that in russia ( unless government want to punish you for something else ) . 
  nope . 
  i do n't even check who is at the door . 
  friends or neighbors would call me first . 
  you do n't have country flair .

  it has something in common with mongol invasion because similar ethic can be seen in asia and european countries which were conquered by mongols . 
  however before revolution russian elite was affected with western ( french ) culture and they were banished from the country by communists . 
  now we can enjoy our golden horde heritage in full . 
  ethics . 
  instead of fighting with corruption schemes people want to participate in them because after communism there is no `` good '' , `` evil '' , `` wrong '' , `` right '' - only money . 
  also it 's much more easy to learn than french and german . 
  at least for me .

  used to be a popular location to buy foreign * [ dacha ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dacha ) * but now it 's bankrupt + it 's divided . 
  and it 's one of the reasons why turkey has slim chances to join eu . 
  place of birth of aphrodite ( one of two possible places actually ) . 
  it 's average week , nothing sensational or dramatic . 
  however this week already started with dramatic local event - i 'll post it in digest in sunday . 
  there is another scandal already : one of russian bearers is a military pilot which bombed georgia in 2008 . 
  it 's not only a whim of the government . 
  i 've seen ukrainians tasted capitalism and they like it + many ukrainians do n't like russia as they imagine it 's almost the same as ussr ( they are right ) and they see eu integration as a method to escape from `` friendly '' russia ( besides economical benefits after joining eu ) . 
  moldova is under pressure for attempts to escape neoussr along with ukraine . 
  romanian government may resolve conflict by using `` russian tactic '' and offering citizenship specifically to population of transistria ( romania is offering citizenship to moldovan population anyway ) - it may allow moldova to join eu . 
  otherwise country has high chances to fall back into ussr2 if ukraine fail eu integration . 
  reporters found the money . 
  surely government knows the owner but wo n't tell - money were imported illegally and there may ( will ) be international scandal around them . 
  one does not simply buy lithuanian ( and belorussian ) milk in russia - we would have to overthrow government for that ... 
  if i had dairy farm in lithuania i 'd start making cheese right now - it consumes huge amount of milk and can be stored for a long time . 
  inventors of `` vodka '' word . 
  some of my ancestors were from poland so i probably * have * to like most facts about poland though i do n't know much . 
  some ex-ussr countries are extremely poor while laws in russia made local jobs available for migrants + municipal officials use migrants to steal money so it 's `` win-win '' situation ( migrant is getting half of his salary while his employer is getting another half , both are happy , nobody works ) .

  there are signs of stagnation and recession in russia - just government pretends everything is fine .

  1 ) government is corrupted to no extent and most likely it does n't have any doors closed for foreign intelligence and own personnel ; 2 ) docs does n't matter much , kremlin has technology to initiate riots and civil wars ( ruined economy =  optional nationalistic movements =  riots =  snipers =  optional civil war =  russian tanks ) and it worked many times ( including 1991 +1993 in moscow , 91 +08 in georgia , moldova , azerbaijan ) and will be reused in ukraine when needed . 
  if ukraine will escape eurasian union by joining eu it will be the end of whole political doctrine of post-ussr russia and the end of putin 's government . 
  i 'm sure they 'll do anything to pursue neoussr idea - including routine espionage activities which led to civil wars in georgia , moldova ( and probably in azerbaijan ) . 
  civil war in ukraine will allow kremlin to take a break for 20-30 years instead of just falling apart . 
  there was an alcohol prohibition campaign ( 1914-1925 ) . 
  same for mid-80s ( perestroyka , ussr fall ) . 
  if you want a revolution in russia - limit alcohol consumption . 
  edit : letter . 
  cheap alcohol is very effective form of crowd control . 
  drunk and unhealthy population is incapable to start a revolution . 
  it 's easy to predict what 's next if you know recent history of georgia and moldova : nationalistic movements , separatism , `` unknown '' snipers * shooting both sides , civil war , russian troops and tank armies . 
  \\* they even used snipers in moscow during conflict between eltsin and parliament in 1993 - to intensify violence . 
  thanks !, 
  very interesting visual schemes there . 
  kremlin * will * deliver on the threats : they did it twice in georgia ( 1992 + 2008 ) , they did it in moldova , they 'll do it in eastern ukraine . 
  civil unrest and follow up civil war is easy to organize for kremlin with its experience . 
  economic destabilization , some nationalistic slogans , some sniper shots - voila !, 
  - decades-long civil war over nothing , ethnic cleansing , devastated region , inability to join any political block . 
  unless ukraine will urgently boost its counter-intelligence bureau . 
  i just did n't expect they 'll be that vocal about their intentions . 
  edit : some english . 
  everything is easy except for `` have '' derivatives to form sentences . 
  25 years of learning and i still have troubles when i have to form sentence like `` i have had an impression '' / `` i had an impression '' / `` i was having an impression '' . 
  dear eu , do n't let ukraine fall back into eurasian union / ussr2 - it will be precursor for wwiii .
