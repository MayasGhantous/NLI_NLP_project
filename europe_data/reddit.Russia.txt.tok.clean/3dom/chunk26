  you are right - customs union , an embryo of ussr2 . 
  for putin 's regime ukraine joining ~ ~ cis ~ ~ customs union is a question of life and death of political doctrine to re-animate corpse of ussr - and maybe life and death of the government itself . 
  no wonder they are trying everything to prevent ukraine from joining eu . 
  i already thought about possibility of moldova/georgia-like scenario with part of the country declaring independence and resulting civil war + inability to join any alliance . 
  crimea already was an independent republic ( quasi-country like abkhazia ) during ~ 1 year after ussr fall , it may be relatively easy to destabilize situation there + in eastern ukraine in case if ukraine will continue its course to joining eu . 
  so either ua will boost counter-intelligence agency right now or most likely they 'll never join eu . 
  edit : counter intelligence note . 
  result of mixed propaganda ( see shuribot 's comment above ) because they want to join eu and still may join cis . 
  previous part . 
  this phrase means explosives were placed by nazi troops . 
  ** russia : ** * lawmaker irina rodnina , ex-olympic champion , trainer of us sportsmen , removed [ racist picture of barak & michelle obama with banana ] ( http://en.ria.ru/russia/20130914/183422831/russian-lawmaker-accused-of-tweeting-racist-obama-pic.html ) she posted on twitter ; * us embassy replied with [ quote from thomas jefferson ] ( https://twitter.com/usembru/status/378854215549861888 ) ; * armed and ready wwii explosives [ removed from under the bridge ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/09/14/bridge/ ) near kaliningrad ( koenigsberg ) - people used this bridge for 70 years ; * moscow police started [ `` decriminalization '' of subway ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/09/14/metrocrime/ ) to remove illegal migrants - meaning there will be even more papers checks than before ( just like they did it with markets before resulting in 3200 arrests ) ; * space agency roskosmos partially [ shut down ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/09/13/blinded/ ) indicators in space capsule during landing because they were malfunctioning , roskosmos forgot to warn cosmonauts in capsule about malfunction , they landed safely anyway ; * [ 37 people perished ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/09/13/dead/ ) in a fire in mental hospital ; * yekaterinburg [ elected independent anti-narcotic activist roizman ] ( http://lenta.ru/articles/2013/09/09/roizman/ ) as mayor despite severe pressure from authorities and anti-narcotic enforcement units ( which practically forced roizman to become politic - to continue support of his rehab organization ) ; * court [ sentenced four people to jail terms ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/09/11/loot/ ) in the case about thievery from remains of crashed plane of president of poland leh kachinski in 2010 ; * [ anti-pedophilia protests ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/09/11/yakutsk2/ ) in yakutsk around rape of 4 y.o. 
  child - people do n't believe courts can handle this case properly ; * kremlin started [ economical warfare with moldova ] ( http://lenta.ru/articles/2013/09/11/moldova/ ) because moldova prefer to join eu over cis ; * kremlin [ raised price of gas for belorussia ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/09/13/gas/ ) because belorussian enforcement agency hold vladislav baumgertner - ceo of russian company '' [ uralkaliy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uralkali ) '' - as hostage to settle argument around prices of potassium fertilizers ; * amount of russian warships in mediterranian sea [ increased to 10 ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/09/13/ten/ ) ; * russia and us negotiate around syria , it seems us wo n't use deadly force after russia offered to give up all syrian chemical weapons ; * second [ group of venezuelan criminals ] ( http://lenta.ru/articles/2013/09/11/columbia/ ) arrested in russia after they stole jewelry for ~ 1mil $ $ $ . 
  russia becomes travel destination for `` criminal tourism '' due to extremely rich `` 1 % '' , weak law enforcement system , 0 protection against illegal immigration . 
  edit : links and engrish . 
  a bottle per vote . 
  i guess some cheap local brand ( must be $ 5 per bottle ) . 
  it 's still missing dashcam and bears . 
  not much : * g20 summit in saint petersburg , nothing interesting happened there - probably because obama ignored it ; * a bus with political activists crashed , [ 8 dead ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/09/07/pskov1/ ) ; * armenia declared they are [ joining cis ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/09/06/eu/ ) instead of eu ; * putin said government is going to help syria [ in the war with west ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/09/06/putin/ ) ; * mayor `` elections '' in moscow - i guess present mayor ( sobyanin ) won . 
  it 's impossible to lose if you are assigned by dear leader . 
  also polls show up to 90 % people in moscow believe elections are rigged , population ignore voting ( 7 % voted before noon ) ; * a person bribed people to vote for certain candidate [ by offering them vodka ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/09/08/vodka/ ) . 
  edit : forgot to add two important economic news : * year-to-year august sales of avtovaz ( cars manufacturer ) dropped by as much as 25 % ; * government declared it 's going to lower its spending - i can not remember last time when it happened ( probably in 2008 ) . 
  it seems country is very close to economy recession . 
  edit 2 : * it 's 20:00 , total amount of votes in moscow is ~ 26 % from amount of voters - before rigging , people do n't want to waste time ; * it seems roizman is a [ leading candidate ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/09/08/ekat/ ) in ekaterinburg on mayoral elections ( he is anti-narcotic activist who created and maintained unique free rehab organization/facility despite severe pressure from corrupted authorities including `` anti-narcotics '' units ) - yet again - before rigging . 
  it was calm week . 
  however * meteorite [ exploded today above vladivostok ] ( http://www.forbes.ru/news/244152-nad-vladivostokom-vzorvalsya-meteorit ) - happens 2nd time during this year ; * author of [ painting depicting putin and medvedev ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-23861707 ) fled the country ( probably related to `` gay propaganda '' law ) ; * rt.com is [ blocked ] ( http://rt.com/news/rt-reddit-ban-censorship-169/ ) in / r/news - no wonder considering it 's created by and for kremlin administration as method of propaganda . 
  i bet these incredible criminal-friendly self-defense laws have their roots in communism : in capitalist countries law-abiding * taxpayers * can use deadly force against criminals while in ( post - ) communist countries a criminal and a victim have equal value to the system . 
  yes . 
  most self-defense cases treated as murder . 
  you 'll get jail term no matter that if you kill a person who attacked you ( unless you are in law enforcement - then you 'll get a medal ) . 
  government is interesting in saving criminals . 
  sarcasm - there is no laws against self-defense . 
  but i do n't remember a single case which did n't result in jail term . 
  it was slow news week : * dear leader issued edict to limit entry to olympic town ( sochi ) for 3 months from january to march 2014 : cars can not enter city without special permit and any public activity ( including gay rights protests obviously ) [ is prohibited ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/08/24/kommers/ ) - various organizations started to inquiry if it 's constitutional or not ? 
  * country 's junior powerlifting champion ( girl , 20 ) [ sentenced to 8 years ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/08/19/verdict/ ) in obvious self-defense case : she passed out ( maybe poisoned ) and a `` friend '' tried to `` help '' her in a hotel room ending up with knife wound + dead 1 day later . 
  self-defense is criminal offense in russia . 
  * volgograd ( former stalingrad ) authorities [ restored ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/08/23/fountain/ ) famous '' [ dancing children ] ( http://podzemka.spb.ru//lj/stalin/stalingrad01_02_05/fontan.jpg ) '' fountain which became a symbol of battle of stalingrad during wwii . 
  and that 's pretty much it . 
  edit : links . 
  first of all - every medium / big business is paying 25-33 % `` protection tax '' to either police or fsb depending on business size . 
  small businesses pay either endless bribes or hidden `` protection tax '' included in rent : if you have small standalone shop - you pay bribes to countless organizations ( police , fire department , healthcare ) , if you rent your shop in a mall - bribes included in your rent and mall owner pay them . 
  businessmen may become a victim of `` gang wars '' between government organizations - they use detaining of businessmen as form of pressure onto each other ( to cut off financing ) . 
  another illustration of corruption level : 30 % of food prices in the country is corruption component ( bribes added to value to cover business ' expenses ) . 
  population feed 40 millions `` invisible citizens '' . 
  edit : couple more details . 
  for russians it 's not easy to declare themselves gay - even falsely . 
  it 's not like putin took those anti-gay laws out of thin air : country is poisoned with criminal culture and mentality where gay equal to outlaw / lowest caste . 
  if you are gay or business ( wo ) man you do n't have to lie . 
  many waves of colonizers in past ( normans , saxons , romans ) . 
  they killed bluefaced guy when he tried to liberate scotland . 
  inventors of modern tradition to eat carrot for better vision . 
  their intelligence is great yet almost every russian political immigrant in the uk is dying in strange accidents like polonium poisoning or heart attack in a bath ( having healthy heart ) . 
  they provide hosting for eve online servers . 
  country is a prototype for the country in game of thrones / song of ice and fire . 
  their teeth improved greatly lately . 
  it 's suicidal only for putin . 
  besides ussr restoration his administration has exactly zero ideas about country development ( it seems economy is in recession - government denies this `` rumor '' weekly ) and ukraine joining eu will be the ultimate demise of whole putin 's foreign policy method ( cheap/expensive gas , export/import embargo ) . 
  edit : my wonderful engrish . 
   '' durchschlag `` yes - term '' \u0434\u0443\u0440\u0448\u043b\u0430\u0433 '' sounds exactly the same as source german word . 
  `` bohrmaschine '' is in use here as well . 
  french army is the most effective in europe - they 've won 66 % of battles during 800 years and participated in creation of 3 major countries ( germany , italy , us ) .

  it seems more like a simple yet very effective corruption scheme . 
  * national athletic team got [ 1st place ] ( http://lenta.ru/articles/2013/08/17/athletics/ ) by amount of medals in the world championship in moscow . 
  * candidate sobianin got 11 % rating drop in a single week prior to moscow mayor elections after expose of his `` overly talented '' businesswoman daughter . 
  alternative candidate and civil rights activist navalny got his organizations raided by fsb and was accused in foreign financing because some of transfers were made from ip addresses originated in other countries ( by russians - but it does n't matter ) . 
  * people ( russians ) from other countries started to transfer minuscule sums of money to various government organizations and accuse them in foreign financing . 
  * ship crashed into another ship in siberia , 4 people died , 40 in hospital , [ captain arrested ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/08/18/refuse/ ) ( he was drunk ) . 
  * few followers of russian pastafarian church were [ arrested ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/08/17/pasta/ ) ( and released ) yesterday for illegal meeting in moscow . 
  during arrest they were sprayed with ketchup by orthodox christian activists . 
  note : pastafarian church is officially recognized and is registered organization in russia .

  i was 17 when ussr felt apart . 
  the country was an abomination yet modern ( fascist ) russia is even worse for some reasons ( more corruption , less social security , authorities = organized crime , etc. ), 
  - that 's why some people embrace idea of restoring ussr . 
  only two things are better now : much more goods in stores ( still it 's nearly impossible to buy a house ) and slightly less propaganda ( due to lack of ideology behind russian fascism ) - at least i do n't see slogans like `` long live putin '' on streets . 
  yet . 
  i think it may happen ( cis+u kraine ) if yanukovich - or any other president after him - will be able to amend constitution to become `` a tsar '' like lukashenko , putin , nazarbaev . 
  basically cis is a shield for dictators and corruption . 
  yes - that block already works : besides strong economic links there are administration ties - like there are no customs on borders between belarus , kazakhstan and russia . 
  i think restoring ussr is putin 's primary agenda - and ukraine is the next step in this plan .
