  if ukraine will join nato/eu it will defeat whole idea and possibility of new russian empire ( at least for few decades ) . 
  impossible while russian government has plans to restore ussr . 
  not sure - maybe it 's 18 . 
  passport / id is allowed since 14 - as well as marriage in certain circumstances . 
  cases related to pedophilia are linked to 15 years age or less ( which i remember ) - 16 considered `` an adult '' ( which is ridiculous in my opinion ) . 
  edit : [ it 's 16 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ages_of_consent_in_europe#russia ), 
  in russia age of consent is 16 years ( i believe ) thought it 's allowed to marry in 14 - probably due to medieval customs in distant / rural areas . 
  * the man who tricked bank to sign amended contract and almost won $ 800k from the bank in court - [ he fled the country ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/08/09/tcs/ ) to avoid possible criminal charges for `` fraud '' after tweets from bank 's owner ( oleg tinkov ) with precise jail term information ( speculation : as if bank 's owner paid to authorities to prosecute that person ) . 
  note : medium and big business is involved into corruption schemes and most likely tinkov 's bank already controlled by fsb so he does not have to pay anything / a lot extra to prosecute that person - threat is real . 
  * government assured olympic committee that anti-gay law wo n't be enforced during olympics - at least not in the olympic town . 
  i do n't believe them - i think at best only sportsmen will be immune while civil rights activist will be prosecuted for sure . 
  * after authorities ' effort to gather and deport thousands of illegal immigrants from moscow it turned out 90 % of the detained have provided false information about their identity - probably because they are planning to return to the country immediately after deportation ( with new documents ) . 
  russia does n't have any effective protection methods against illegal immigration besides basic papers check . 
  * nationalist movement is gaining momentum on the wake of government 's anti-immigration activity - there were hundreds-strong meetings in major cities across the country . 
  * `` russian oscar schindler '' ( in a bad way ) : immigration control employee is suspected criminal - he allegedly [ helped to 600 migrants ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/08/09/help/ ) to avoid deportation . 
  * british prime minister [ refused ] ( https://twitter.com/david_cameron/status/366100373980717056 ) to boycott olympics despite the letter from steven fry . 
  * director of patriotic youth camp got 18 years jail term [ for pedophilia ] ( http://lenta.ru/articles/2013/08/10/eagles/ ) . 
  * petition against anti-piracy law gathered [ 100k ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/08/10/roi/ ) votes . 
  lawmakers do n't care ( mostly because they do n't have power to change anything ) and i think the law will not be changed . 
  * one of the lawmakers proposed a law against cursing in the internet . 
  most likely the law will be accepted and enforced soon - effectively turning ( almost ) every internet user in russia into a criminal . 
  * obama refused to meet with putin in september and instead is going to sweden . 
  snowden and syria are the reasons ( officially it 's just snowden ) . 
  russian officials proposed to us to behave like grown-ups . 
  * russian officials proposed [ tank biathlon ] ( http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/08/10/210837966/russia-invites-u-s-to-a-tank-biathlon ) competition to us . 
  * 5 years since august war in georgia . 
  georgians name august , 6 as the beginning of the war , russians name august , 8 - because official versions differ ( note : it takes 6-9 weeks to relocate russian tank army so russia started preparations to the war at least in june - and blamed georgia for `` surprise '' attack in august ) . 
  [ pelmeni ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pelmeni ) ( \u043f\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 ) - meat dumplings in dough . 
  closest western variant is ravioli ( which are less tasty in my opinion ) . 
  [ vareniki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vareniki ) ( \u0432\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 ) - similar dish but usually with cheese filling . 
  also i 'm a fan of georgian cuisine so i like [ khachapuri ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khachapuri ) ( \u0445\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0440\u0438 ) - cheese cake ( without sugar ) , ajarian variant in particular ( with egg on top ) . 
  and of course kebabs , pizza - and pierogi + bliny ( pancakes ) . 
  almost everything is being consumed with either ketchup , mayonnaise or sour cream ( \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430 ) .

  your description of russia is very accurate . 
  i see many ex-communist states are falling into fascism . 
  because agreement to build hindu temple in moscow was a part of mutual deal between orthodox church and hindu church . 
  orthodox church opened two temples in india and decided to void their part of deal . 
  edit : engrish . 
  both . 
  first central / moscow authorities tried to turn this into criminal lawsuit ( `` desecration of flag '' ) , then locals attacked the band in anapa airport ( police helped but only after band members received few hits ) , after that they were stopped in the airport for `` additional checks '' and missed their plane . 
  in the end ministry of foreign affair shortened their visas and forced them out of country - which is good because now local authorities can not detain them . 
  ** russia ** * edward snowden granted temporary papers to live airport in moscow ; * bloodhound gang band barely escaped from russia after their bassist dragged russian flag through his pants during concert ( in ukraine ) ; * putin is amused with actual 5 years jail term for `` opposition leader '' and civil rights activist navalny because others in this case got just a probation ( including a person who allegedly stole $ 500k of municipal money ) ; * local authorities in different cities across russia turned off fountains to prevent ex-marines from bathing in the fountains during `` day of the marine '' annual celebration ; * after an immigrant ( from southern russia region ) crushed skull of a policeman in a market in moscow - there are massive legal ( more like military ) actions against migrants from every south region including russian provinces and ex-ussr republics - amount of detained is in thousands , many of them will be deported ; * legal agencies question policemen for their disability to prevent mob attack on their colleagues - everyone talk about corruption : markets in russia are controlled by organized crime which is actually police and fsb - so during attack some of the ( local ) policemen just watched and did n't do anything because they are bribed by the people who attacked ( non-local ) police ; * government can not coordinate their opinion on anti-gay politics during olympics - some say they wo n't enforce anti-gay laws during olympics , some say they 'll force arrests for `` gay propaganda '' during olympics ; * anti-piracy law started to work since august , 1 - people are n't sure what is it about but one of the government 's agencies already asked for $ 3mil to enforce the law ; * there was the first sentence with real jail term for ddos attack - owner of chronopay used it against government-controlled aeroflot ; * moscow authorities accepted / ratified bill to destroy the only hindu temple ( dedicated to krishna ) in the city . 
  edit : engrish, 
  thank you very much !, 
  i did n't have a clue my english is that bad = /, 
  thanks !, 
  yes , please . 
  ** russia ** * `` opposition leader '' and anti-corruption activist alexey navalny challenged / objected ( i 'm not sure how is this procedure called in `` law english '' ) his 5 years sentence for ridiculous `` crime '' of advising to some municipal company manager to accept questionable contract ; * certain winter olympic medals will have parts of meteor exploded on february , 15 above chelyabinsk ( how ? 
  it 's exploded way too high to scrap anything ) ; * during successful attempt to catch a rapist on migrants-filled market police was attacked by a mob , one of the policemen got open skull wound ( brain exposed ) and is in intensive care unit ; * one of the founders of yandex search engine died ( 48 y.o. 
  ) ; * someone used 50kg self-made bomb to destroy pig farm near saint petersburg ; * an-2 plane crash-landed in rostov-on-don , pilot flee the scene , police caught him later ; * edward snowden spent 1 month in sheremetyevo airport , got paper / permission to get out of transit zone ; * putin [ caught 21kg pike ] ( http://news.kremlin.ru/media/events/presidentphotos/big/41d47c97531316df4fd6.jpeg ) ; * putin 's press secretary [ rejected rumors ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2013/07/28/peskov/ ) pike was `` pre-caught '' - he insist putin actually caught it himself and photos are fresh despite putin is posing in the same pants and watches as in 2007 / 2008 photos . 
  edit : added some more news + links . 
  onischenko is a muppet used to vocalize most idiotic ideas of putin 's administration which could bury career of any ( other ) politic . 
  still these are ideas circulating in putin 's administration - or at least administration pretend they believe in onischenko 's bullshit to initiate sanctions against neighbor countries ( georgia in this case ) . 
  edit : engrish . 
  yes . 
  correct . 
  and those `` hidden '' employer-based taxes in russia equal to ~ 40-50 % of salary making effective tax rate for employees around 30-40 % ( salaries could be 40-50 % higher without those `` hidden '' taxes ) + 13 % after that . 
  same or even higher than in eu and us - but without ability to deduct anything . 
  so russians tricked to think they have minimal tax rate while it 's the same or higher than in eu and us while government is * much * less effective . 
  and at the same time tax rate on income of people who do n't work ( i.e. 
  shareholders , company owners ) is flat rate 13 % . 
  edit : engrish . 
  here is [ interview with burned russian tank driver ] ( http://www.novayagazeta.ru/society/67490.html ) wounded in debaltseve ( nsfl photo ) - with exact personal data and military id number ( soldier is on active service ) . 
  perhaps the shooter was vladimir vladimirovich himself : nemtsov was shot in the back - that 's how spies work . 
  ( actually it 's sad joke ), 
  ** russian federation ** , self-inflicted sanctions make us stronk * state has asked belarus to explain [ origins of belarusian papaya and kiwi export ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/23/09/2015/5602b18e9a794733c2178baf ) : during last year the country has turned into full spectrum exporter of prohibited products into rufed - including oysters , ocean fish , suspicious polish-looking apples . 
  belarus [ has explained the situation with great details ] ( https://dwigif.appspot.com/view/ktkessp ) ( thanks for the more relevant content , / u/dngrs ! ), 
  + [ article ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/24/09/2015/56040ba19a7947355e55fb09 ) ; * state tv channel has [ censored portraits of putin and medvedev ] ( http://imgur.com/oqcelcj ) in the news about [ overly corrupted governor ] ( https://slon.ru/posts/57100 ) - have to keep their holiness in the delicate cases like this one : in initial news there was an emphasis how the bastard governor has a collection of watches and expensive real estate and private airplane while in this country only totally non-corrupt `` talking head '' press-secretary of putin is allowed to have sheikh-level [ $ 600k watches ] ( http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-08-03/where-did-putin-s-spokesman-get-a-620-000-watch - ) and [ ~ $ 15m house ] ( https://navalny.com/p/4455/ ) and rent yachts for $ 400k/week ; * after various intelligence services have publicly reported russian activity in syria the state had to admit it deliver `` hardware '' ( fighter jets , missile and artillery systems ) which is surely used to fight [ against isis exclusively ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/24/09/2015/5603de169a7947a6fc2fdc58 ) - not against kurds or syrian opposition despite that you may think ; there are rumors about possibility to deploy 20k troops to support assad + information how [ russian military is refusing to go to syria ] ( https://slon.ru/posts/56668 ) ; * rufed 's diplomat has made a breakthrough discovery : [ wwii was poland 's fault ] ( http://bigstory.ap.org/urn:publicid:ap.org:43af9cc8c7a8478fb24295179aae77ee ) ; * during 2014 year [ 98 % of income by top500 companies in the country was generated by oil and gas industry ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/finances/24/09/2015/560330bd9a794776bcd6c648 ) . 
  and 2014 was much better for economy than 2015 . 
  from income point of view the biggest country in the world with common borders with 3 economic superpowers ( eu , us , china ) - it does not have any profitable business but natural resource extraction . 
  it 's not like we have the most inefficient government on this planet , no ; * apple is officially accused of gay propaganda [ for homosex family emojis in iphones ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/24/09/2015/5603fa7e9a7947ca52e81361 ) . 
  note : nations with lower average age , worse education , bad economy tend to be more aggressive and start wars ; compared to ussr rufed 's education is in ruins , economy is falling apart - and now the government is trying to force people to breed ... and there goes apple and their omni-present propaganda in 2-monthly-salaries-worth phones . 
  think of the children ( soldiers ) !, 
  * a minor actor ( which happen to be police officer as well ) from 2 iconic movies has been arrested for possession of [ 280kg of drug precursors ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/24/09/2015/5603f5bb9a794790c9550b8e ) . 
  note : gasoline ( for example ) can be used to create cocaine so it 's not clear if this is actual anti-narcotic operation or just a punishment for the lack of discipline and loyalty a.k.a. 
  decent share of corrupt money flow . 
  * arrested-kidnapped estonian counter-intelligence officer kohver has been [ exchanged for our heroic fail-spy dressen ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34369853 ) . 
  happy end i guess - and do n't forget to build a fence if you are our lovely neighbor , preferably with few hundreds tanks guarding it . 
  edit : now with 20 % more english and ( i hope ) 10 % more sense . 
  interesting part of the situation : most money transactions ( including illegal - and especially illegal ) - even minuscule ( few thousands $ $ $ ) - are performed under full control and direct participation of fsb agents . 
  to the point where they work as cash delivery couriers - i 've witnessed this situation in a company as small as 5 people ( building materials trading company ) . 
  edit : country 's laws were built around `` business '' practices which expropriate wealth ( and money ) to pass them to 50-100 government 's pocket oligarchs which control 33 % + of public wealth . 
  in normal capitalist country this number is 1 % of population ( i.e. 
  in case of rufed there should be 1.4 m wealthy people instead of 100 hyper-wealthy ) . 
  so lately country 's national idea is `` steal and run '' - where `` steal '' often should be used in quotes because these are actually people 's own funds , which were earned legally . 
  no wonder that even fsb think it 's ok to help people to cash out their money illegally - and that is why so much money has been stolen . 
  or more like `` stolen '' . 
  similar numbers : amount of vacancies on job sites has dropped by [ 20-30 % ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/money/22/09/2015/560159019a7947168a44a0a4 ) year-to-year ( depending * on profession ) . 
  amount of visitors in some malls dropped by 20-30 % as well . 
  it 's not a recession , it 's more like collapse . 
  \\* amount of low-skill vacancies has increased by 20 % . 
  probably because some economic migrants have left the country due to decreased wages : they are now * at the same level as in china * . 
  i briefly studied history of georgia and i did n't see anything specific to this topic ( like `` georgian king x was saved by jewish noble y so georgians are eternally grateful now '' ) . 
  i guess tolerance toward jewish community and religion is `` naturally appeared '' cultural trait of georgians . 
  georgia is probably the only country ( state , region ) in europe which was n't hostile towards jewish diaspora - ever . 
  recently paleontologist discovered ancient humans which substantially changed theories about homo sapiens development . 
  there is interesting dinosaur-era excavation site in the country . 
  georgia was the most rich and prosperous region of ussr . 
  in 1992 georgia became the first target of russian `` hybrid warfare '' campaign against ex-ussr territories .
