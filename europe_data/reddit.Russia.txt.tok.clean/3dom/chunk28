  a lot of good wines - kindzmarauli , saperavi , tsinandali . 
  khachapuri is my favorite dish and tkemali is my favorite ketchup replacement ( when available ) . 
  edit : op corrected title to `` georgians '' instead of `` georgia '' . 
  well , i think georgians are the most friendly people i 've met ( see note about jewish diaspora above ) + georgians are creative and brave ( check the history of russian empire and ussr ) . 
  and georgians need help to keep the country independent . 
  [ ericsson t28 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ericsson_t28 ) in 1999 ( or 00 ? ), 
  a year ago i 've posted links to news where ~ 200 dagestani families attempted to get compensations for their military relatives died in `` rostov region '' ( i.e. 
  in ukraine ) during august . 
  population of dagestan is equal to 1/70 of total population of rufed and that happened 1 year ago - meaning much more soldiers were killed since then + there were much more non-dagestani soldiers . 
  if anything 2k kia number seems too low . 
  tl ; dr 42000 soldiers , 700 tanks , 1500 apcs , 530 cannons , 300 mlrs . 
  this is a force comparable to whole ukrainian ( or romanian ) army . 
  amount of tanks is more than 1/4 of total tanks in russian army ( 2500 ) . 
  few days ago [ 191 ethnic greeks have been evacuated ] ( http://www.mfa.gr/epikairotita/eidiseis-anakoinoseis/anakoinose-upourgeiou-exoterikon-skhetika-me-programma-philoxenias-omogenon-apo-ten-periokhe-marioupoles.html ) from ukrainian mariupol . 
  i hope it 's not the same situation as happened in september , 1993 in soukhumi/abkhazia when almost all ethnic greeks were evacuated from the town - right before it was assaulted by `` non-russian '' troops . 
  vpns and proxies are somewhat easy to use ( no hardware required ) + lots of major blogs had bypassing instructions sticky for months - until their authors realized it 's not serious . 
  30m + people use wikipedia in russia every month ( half of internet users ) and if this ban would become reality then few weeks later whole country would switch to tor , proxies , vpn , opera.turbo and similar methods to ignore decisions of trolls in the government . 
  this is how this government `` work '' in a nutshell : to create an illusion of control they solve problems they 've created themselves . 
  but in the end they lose control on situation : i bet a lot of people started to look for anti-firewall solutions during this week after news on possible wikipedia ban - for example , i did . 
  process of establishing authoritarianism in russia has the other side of the medal : having rich ussr experience people are ready to sabotage and bypass any restrictions this government has to offer . 
  couple months ago i 've checked rules - it 's not prohibited on narrow streets . 
  and most streets can be considered narrow with all the cars parked along them . 
  somehow i doubt any european country can beat our [ road building methods ] ( http://imgur.com/8wjglff ) . 
  in rufed it 's a hobby and/or sport , almost nobody use bicycles to commute - probably because the roads are covered with a thick layer of mud during ~ 6 months every year and overall ( driving ) culture ( and civil court system ) is n't too inspiring . 
  however situation is a bit different in smaller towns - people actually commute on bikes . 
  bike paths are non-existent , authorities in moscow have attempted to create them couple years ago but [ results ] ( http://www.tugunov.com/2011/08/blog-post_31.html ) were [ laughable ] ( http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4519/25036891.b/0_640dd_b1541c4a_l.jpg ) . 
  even though i understand the language it 's difficult to tell if these guys are supporters or this is aggressive-passive sabotage of kremlin 's food embargo ( most likely they are supporters and it 's not satire ) . 
  lately most kremlin supporters look like they are actually sabotaging the state - probably because all the kremlin 's ideas are as bad as food destruction . 
  ** russian federation ** ruble lost 20 % of value during few weeks ( 50 =  65 r / $ ) , bitcoin is more stable currency ; [ helicopters ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/16/08/2015/55d053c89a7947e32bc89abe ) and military airplanes are dropping like flies this summer ( 10 + major accidents ) . 
  it look like the country has lost most of technicians capable to do pre-flight checks and maintenance . 
  flights are turning into russian roulette here ; uncontrollable government 's ~ ~ trolling ~ ~ censorship agency has attempted to block reddit for whole country over drugs-related sub with less than 10 subscribers , reddit has blocked stupid page for russians , almost everyone is [ happy now ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/55ccb98d9a79474b915f7f16 ) - except for redditors who think it 's severe form of censorship ; it look like the sanctions are n't effective enough to stop the invasion into both georgia and ukraine : there are reports about sizable military force movement in the region ( [ 11 - or more - mobile rocket artillery units on vacation ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/55cfe1209a7947a1bd36681e ) ) . 
  one of the directors of intellectual property agency ( i.e. 
  private company which extort money from whole country - without giving away anything to authors ) was [ severely beaten in moscow ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/15/08/2015/55cf4f499a79476c14092fc1 ) ; orthodox activists destroyed few `` blasphemous '' soviet-era sculptures during [ exposition in the center of moscow ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/14/08/2015/55ce15bb9a79474f19c056c8 ) . 
  autistic sister of ex-supermodel [ natalia vodianova ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/aug/14/supermodel-natalia-vodianova-autistic-sister-cafe-moscow-video ) was thrown out of a cafe and one of left-wing marginal opposition politicians ( limonov ) said there should be [ cafes for `` downs '' ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/55cdbaaf9a7947e1c897199d ) ; government want to [ forbid e-cigarettes ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/14/08/2015/55cda2719a7947cef31dfb68 ) in public places because they promote actual smoking ; deutsche bank is about to be fined by us for [ $ 4 billions ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/finances/14/08/2015/55cd15409a79478da7afe900 ) for their money-laundering activities in rufed and iran ; media report [ 1 billion euro compensation ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/14/08/2015/55cd9cf29a7947c98359b85c ) is about to be paid by france for non-delivery of mistral ships ; note : this is quick digest since nobody else is willing to do it for the glorious country ... 
   do nothing you mean i should go to street with a piece of paper , get detained , rinse and repeat 3 times and get 2 + years in jail ? 
  or maybe kill few random policemen or bureaucrats then get shot by fsb ? 
  or join fsb-sponsored controlled `` underground '' `` nationalist '' movement to plot a revolution ? 
  and fyi not every russian is a citizen of rufed . 
  at least not me - i just live here for some time . 
  i do n't even have any quasi-emotional links to this culture and territory - it 's alien to me , i grew up in caucasus region where fsb is killing people with mindset similar to mine . 
  and the best thing i can do is to get out and hope the world will be smart enough to isolate the state and allow it to collapse into small pieces with minimal amount of lives lost - just like it happened with ussr . 
  actually horrible part : the state which did that to people - it 's still here and it 's almost the same . 
  for example it has internal passports which were introduced during [ famine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_famine_of_1932%e2%80%9333#passports ) in 30s to prevent people escaping from dying regions . 
  we have a good chance to see the history repeating itself . 
  in fact we see it 's repeating already - with minor nuances like killing thousands chechens , ukrainians , dagestanis instead of estonians , poles , ukrainians , russians . 
  did i say ukrainians twice ? 
  that 's because this state is killing them again . 
  my great grandfather was arrested but survived . 
  where `` survived '' = almost 15 years in gulag . 
  worst part : upon release family refused to accept him because a lot of other family members were persecuted as `` national traitors '' and his presence could negatively affect the lives of the survivors ( despite stalin 's death social stigmas related to [ purge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_purge ) persisted for a long time ) . 
  they are small because fsb jail and kill people on daily basis . 
  it 's considered an extremism and criminal offense even to talk about creation of new divisions * within rufed * - even though it 's actually legally described procedure within present set of laws . 
  after successful anti-food operation the state is considering [ new coat of arms ] ( https://twitter.com/annetteteal1/status/629240146374828032/photo/1 ) . 
   while not understanding just how inept and corrupt it was and how the people who ran it are the same people who are still running them . 
  well , for 20 + years whole world thought rufed 's government is n't the same as ussr 's . 
  except , maybe , [ simpsons ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2l4344n_48 ) . 
  80 years ago ussr 's government has started re-building of farming industry and it triggered [ famine which killed ~ 5 millions people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_famine_of_1932%e2%80%9333 ) . 
  government of rufed is the successor of that government - juridical , ideological ( with light modifications ) and methodological . 
  ** russian ** nezabudka / \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0434\u043aa ( it 's being used in plural form mostly ) = `` female '' form of `` forget me not '' . 
  ** russia ** country is busy asking for information about sources of income of our president 's `` talking head '' [ secretary who wear $ 620k worth watch ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/03/08/2015/55beab1d9a7947c4f6ac15c1 ) ( richard mille rm 52-01 ) . 
  his new wife said she has presented them yet she is being sued for not paying facilities cost for her apartments ( ~ $ 15k total ) + it look like the guy had this watch during sochi olympics 1.5 years ago . 
  meanwhile banks are falling one after another and rouble exchange rate is dropping again ( 10 % during a week ) and yet another [ massive fsb operation ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/55bec1bd9a7947ce38771312 ) with multiple dead happened in nalchik on caucasus : 6 people were shot for not wanting to be managed by this government . 
  and like in good old soviet times we are having [ troubles with sugar ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/03/08/2015/55bf79d39a79475134141159 ) ( 10 % price increase in a month ) while government is offering `` solutions '' a-la `` let them eat cakes '' ( actually `` do n't use sugar to cook jams '' ) . 
  it could be worse : `` bath month '' ... 
  us do n't invade ukraine . 
  not yet at least . 
  i would n't use yandex in ukraine considering they are giving up data to fsb without any need in court orders . 
  and fsb is giving up this data just to anyone they want - like `` putinjugend '' or military . 
  failed false flag operation is the only explanation i can imagine . 
  there is no way for the military on `` buk '' to fire at will into random passenger airplanes or to mistake passenger airplane for military transport airplane ( smaller , lower height , lower speed , etc. ), 
  - but it 's possible to mistake one passenger airplane for another passenger airplane if the military work with limited or no ground radar support . 
  i believe mh17 has changed flow of history . 
  it was n't pointless because kremlin needed the invasion - they got an agenda to restore ussr since the very beginning of rufed . 
  but mh17 has changed everything : had they shot down `` proper '' ( russian ) plane instead of mh17 a year ago then ukraine and moldova could be completely occupied by rufed today ( `` see , someone is shooting our passenger airplanes above ukraine , we have no choice but take it to stop this '' ) . 
   3.5 to 1.4 million people ? 
  it look like kremlin believe their own propaganda . 
  plus most likely they do n't have a clue about salaries in the country : in the beginning of the year they were 20 % lower than in kazakhstan for example . 
  good news : 2 synchronous swimmers became [ world 's champions for 17th time ] ( http://www.rg.ru/2015/07/26/sinchron-site-anons.html ) ; for the first time in history racer from rufed got [ 2nd place in formula-1 stage ] ( https://meduza.io/news/2015/07/26/daniil-kvyat-vpervye-v-kariere-zanyal-vtoroe-mesto-v-gonke-formuly-1 ) ; putin is inviting lithuanians who leave their country to [ come to rufed ] ( https://meduza.io/news/2015/07/26/putin-pozval-litovtsev-v-rossiyu ) ; [ leader of far right group born ( \u0411\u041e\u0420\u041d ) got life-long sentence ] ( https://meduza.io/news/2015/07/24/lider-borna-ilya-goryachev-prigovren-k-pozhiznennomu-zaklyucheniyu ) for 5 murders after he said he was directed and supported by kremlin administration ; [ new `` gay hunters '' group appeared in spb ] ( https://meduza.io/feature/2015/07/24/ocherednye-uspehi-obschestvennosti ) ; orthodox [ chapel will be built ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/55b2156b9a794747bedd9441 ) at the place where military barracks has collapsed and killed 20 + soldiers ... oh , well , bad news again . 
  it 's really difficult to find positive ( and not stupid ) news in official fsb-approved channels and sites . 
  if by `` good '' you mean usual `` and then things got worse '' or maybe even `` economic collapse '' - then i concur : government announced [ removal of social benefits for lower level bureaucrats ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/24/07/2015/55b287d49a79475c7c52c998 ) - that 's after recent announce to lay off yet another 10 % of police personnel ( there was 25 % layoff few months ago ) ; immediately after us announced yet another round of sanctions ( decreased term for money loans from 30 days to 7 for companies from rufed ) ~ ~ russian army ~ ~ `` donetsk people 's republic '' announced withdrawal of tanks from certain regions near frontline . 
  apparently it will be heavy hit into kremlin 's most vulnerable spot - their wallet ; various retail networks announced up to 20-40 % decrease in their profits year-to-year for first half of 2015 , average drop across all retailers for 6 months is 8.9 % ; [ yet another plane crashed ] ( http://samaratoday.ru/news/244379 ) , 2 people perished - this time it was training plane . 
  note : `` yet another '' because during 5 weeks of summer rufed 's military lost ~ 1 % ( 6 ) of military planes during training flights - including strategic bomber capable to carry nuclear missiles . 
  it look like there is not enough qualified personnel for pre-flight inspections and repairs to support military airplanes across the country . 
  car sales have [ dropped by 25-40 % ] ( http://www.vedomosti.ru/auto/articles/2015/07/22/601646-prodazhi-avtomobilei-v-peterburge-za-pervoe-polugodie-2015-g-upali-na-38 ) during 6 months ; real estate reported [ 50 % decreased sales ] ( http://realty.rbc.ru/articles/16/07/2015/562949996134846.shtml ) ; during this week a friend of mine tried to find tour to thailand and discovered his whole region ( sochi , recent winter olympics town ) has lost * almost all * travel agencies . 
  perhaps he could get lesser sentence if he had n't open his mouth and declare his activity was directed and supported by people from president 's administration - [ kremlin had to deny that ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/09/06/2015/5576c6949a79472abc5104ea ) . 
  muslims `` have '' to gather in big crowds because there is just a handful of mosques in central russia ( and in moscow ) . 
  it 's true for a country where concentration of wealth is ~ 10000 + ( 10 + thousands ) times higher than in us : [ 110 people ] ( http://finance.yahoo.com/news/report-110-people-own-35-133554175.html ) control 35 % of public wealth compared to `` 1 % '' ( 3 + millions ) in us . 
  this regime literally stole the country from people - there are no ethical norms which could justify such concentration of wealth in non-monarchist country in 21th century and last time i checked rufed was n't a monarchy . 
  you should go to local church during weekend or celebration to see it 's full of normal people + often there are sunday schools near church with a lot of children and their parents . 
  i heard there is a phrase how wise people see religion as useful - for example check this chart - especially income of jewish and hindu followers : [ income distribution among believers in us ] ( http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/income-distribution/ ) . 
  churches are a good place to get useful connections - there you can bypass a lot of social barriers . 
  so not only babushkas there . 
  but still babushkas are often very talkative and can give up a lot of important stuff about their families and neighbors . 
  here is fresh example : [ fsb has arrested a * cleric * for * treason * ] ( http://www.rosbalt.ru/moscow/2015/02/09/1366145.html ) . 
  he says he 's fsb officer under cover , his case is classified like it happens with secret agents and military . 
  orthodox cleric is really shitty cover for fsb officer if you ask me - it 's too obvious . 
  one can not insult fsb 's department of orthodox christianity . 
  note : there is common opinion about orthodox church is spying on citizens - some of clerics hint they work in/for fsb . 
   you could 've been so much more , russia ... actually could n't . 
  there was a link few days ago in r/europe with series of maps with prominent artists , scientists , writers born through 1400 to 1950 - compared to western europe russia had almost none .
