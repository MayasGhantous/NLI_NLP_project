  this culture has suppressed people 's creativity ( or did n't have social infrastructure to support it ) for hundreds years and most likely it will be like that for hundred ( s ) more years . 
  there was +10 % spike in 2008 , i bet we 'll have the rates growing again as economy degrades . 
  in soviet russia it 's so difficult for politicians not to be gay they can be proud about it ... ... nah , i 'm bad at this . 
  there was information about invaded multiple mechanized infantry platoons around tskhinvali before georgians start shelling - including articles with interviews of russian troops in russian press how they 've observed the shelling from nearby hills after 12-18h of waiting in disguise . 
  but these articles were quickly removed and soldiers were silenced . 
  i guess saakashvili simply panicked after information about invasion which has started ~ 18h before shelling . 
   ukraine has a chance to get back occupied areas . 
  just like georgia `` got back '' abkhazia and south ossetia which were effectively annexed and integrated into russian federation while whole world looked into different direction for 20 + years . 
  today i 've seen an article written in triumphant tone how sales of lada/vaz ( local car manufacturer ) have grown up by 20 % in may . 
  authors of the article `` forgot '' to mention that ford , chevrolet and opel have left the market in the same month . 
   my russian friend would always jokingly and annoyingly tell me that it is america 's fault they ca n't buy good cheese anymore yup , can confirm some russians believe their government do n't control territory of rufed and cia/mossad/whitehouse / merkel/etc . 
  can do whatever they please on russian territory including prohibition of food import , ruining economy , killing politicians who oppose putin and kadyrov to compromise them , etc. 
  also belarussian oceanic fleet is very productive lately with all these sea food coming from the country - including belarussian oysters . 
  i 've seen ukrainian society closely long time ago , not sure about situation there atm . 
  in tv news ukrainians look much more lively and active than citizens of rufed today . 
  i believe ukrainian revolution was possible only because their government did n't have sizable police force and army ( ukrainian army had like 5k troops back then ) . 
  situation in russia is exactly the opposite - big army and its regional divisions are ready to shoot people in other regions ( example : government use buryats in ukraine because russians do n't want to participate in the war with ethnically close neighbors ) . 
  i was in abkhazia in 1992 . 
  in rufed nobody gave a damn about southern wars at that moment - society did n't care ( much less than we/they care today about the war with urkaine ) and the government was ( is ) so dumb they 've even trained and armed chechen guerilla for urban and mountain warfare in abkhazia just to see exactly the same chechens declaring independence from rufed a year later . 
  i 've seen worse - beginning of the war . 
  people were distracted by their thoughts to the point where they 've crushed their cars into each other in simple road situation and then slowly drove away without speaking a word - just to crush again few hundred meters away . 
  somehow i feel i have a chance to see this again . 
  present sanctions are only reasonable from the point of view where us and eu want to keep their own economies untouched i.e. 
  by continuously buying russian oil and gas thus financing kremlin . 
  present us and eu sanctions are too weak to do serious harm to the government , they are giving kremlin time to adapt , strengthen and rebuild economy and anti-western political doctrine , prepare plans and force to suppress local unrest ( if there will be any , russians are way too apathetic ) and militarize society ussr-style - we have fresh memories of that ( in 80s and early 90s children studied military equipment including grenades , rpgs and anti-tank mines in public schools ) . 
  apparently both eu and us do n't want to crush rufed and divide it yet - as they probably should have done in 90s with minimal effort - and instead they repeat their own mistake by `` helping '' to create oppressive and aggressive state on this territory . 
  it 's like using weak drugs against strong decease - they suppress symptoms while health deteriorate . 
  and society in rufed is very , very ill because its fabric was repeatedly destroyed during last century - political drugs wo n't revitalize it as we could see in 90s-10s , serious surgery is required . 
  situation is even worse than it was in ussr in 80s because back then elites had somewhat progressive idea compared to communism / state capitalism ( to build oligarchic capitalism ) , right now their ideas are purely destructive ( restoration of neo-stalinism , fascism , imperialism - up to monarchy and feudalism ) . 
  this is how i see the situation . 
  it is as stable as it was in 1998 before government 's default ... 
  if new canadian sanctions against oil industry will be adopted by us and eu then the default may happen during next 12-18 months . 
   the situation has drastically improved at some point there were empty shelves in stores in november-december related to self-inflicted embargoes and rouble exchange rate jump by 100 % in a week ( from 40-45 to 90 per usd and `` back '' to 60 ) , few weeks later in january-february rouble stabilized at 50-55 / usd and business has adapted . 
  at least that business which did n't die ( car sales dropped by 50 % ) . 
  nothing has changed - people use exactly the same phones , cars , computers , clothing as 1 year ago ;-) it is became obvious that economy is imploding . 
  a lot of small business , car dealers , travel agencies have vanished because everyone hold on their expenses . 
  example : each spring i used to destroy illegal plates with painted advertisement ( `` english lessons '' , `` concrete with delivery '' , `` house repairs '' ) in local alley where i ride bicycle - like 10-15 every week - but during this year only one appeared . 
  people are trying to save money but it does n't work too well since salaries are dropping ( not dramatically yet ) . 
  real estate prices - including rent - has dropped by 30 % or more . 
  queues in stores are a bit shorter now , people buy noticeably less products and selection of these products is a bit worse . 
  i can purchase phones 25-35 % cheaper than a year ago - cell operators sell the phones with zero interest , now they think it will be ok to earn on network services exclusively ( and it affect shops/companies which specialize on phone sales - they are merging and/or getting out of business ) . 
  each spring before this year i 've faced roads which were literally killed by 6 months of snow ( i ride bicycle ) , usualy they were repaired in the end of season - in august when `` autumn '' rains start or sometimes even in october , before new snow season . 
  that happened because repairing brigades got a lot of good private contracts during warm season . 
  this year local roads were repaired right during snow melt down in march and quality of repair exceed everything i 've seen before . 
  apparently those brigades do n't have a lot of good contracts now , they had to take any money they could . 
  this could be a good change if it was n't also about bureaucrats trying to deplete local budgets asap while they still have any money - governments is cutting down expenses and most likely i wo n't see local roads repaired for a very long time now . 
  there are definitely much less people around who like to explain how overtaking crimea was such a great idea . 
  tv news and talk shows are impossible to watch - amount of idiocy is beyond any tolerable level , tv show hosts now have to talk themselves because they were paid to spread propaganda but even the most stupid pro-kremlin guests do n't support government 's ideas lately . 
  their morale noticeable degraded after recent news about us deployment of heavy weapons in europe - people in tv look completely lost , they often make mistakes and have troubles with speaking smoothly as if they were in stress and was thinking about something else . 
  i see approximately the same behavior around - probably people think about losing their jobs , income , increased cost of living ( utilities cost in moscow has been raised by 10 % recently ) . 
  and as / u/zurfer75 said - i see more damaged cars around since people spend much less money on repairs . 
  cars are often dirty because people save money on cleaning . 
  also a year ago whole area around my house was filled with cars when people got from work , now i see a lot of empty spots . 
  couple years ago i 've seen a lot of stickers with offers to purchase or rent a flat in my block , now there is none . 
  tl ; dr economy is nosediving , so far it 's tolerable but people are in stress . 
  yup , i heard how they do it - 400 people in a single flat . 
  one house in sochi got like 35k people registered on the same address - and it was done by fsb to legalize abkhazians as rufed 's citizens to get benefits . 
  illegal practices does n't dismiss fact of internal visa requirement to get a job - and often this visa is being checked through police and fsb ( travel , oil , car sales companies did that ) . 
  russia is n't standard country though : citizens have to get * visa * to live and work ( it 's deceptively called '' \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430 '' or '' \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f '' - sign-in / registration ) and can not move freely between regions because the visa is directly linked to real estate property rights . 
  plus different regions have different laws - like it 's normal to have assault guns in chechnya + they ask for legalization of polygamy . 
  from my point of view eu has more of a country than rufed . 
  and it seems kremlin is scared shitless because rufed 's citizens may realize that any moment ( there is barely anything which hold rufed in one piece ) . 
  note : it 's extremism from russian point of view - in russia it would be an extremism to say its part should secede . 
  i would n't be surprised if kremlin is actually financing parties with similar ideas , they like foreign extremists . 
  thank you very much !, 
  however it 's still difficult to use these : notice at least 2 pairs of matching time `` values '' ( i have eaten = i was eating ) + many of these have matching translation in my native language ( i had been eating = i was eating = \u042f \u0435\u043b ) + a lot of common verbs use non-standard forms ( eaten instead of `` eated '' ) . 
  so far it 's concept of time forms - i still can not use correct variations of the past tense . 
  note . 
  i see people have troubles with pronunciation in this thread . 
  i had problems with people understanding me when i 've tried to mimic actual/correct pronunciation . 
  at certain point i was tired of explanations - what did i want to tell ? 
  - and gave up , started to speak with thick accent . 
  and miracle has happened : people from all over the globe have started to understand me . 
  funny part : i also understand non-native speakers better - probably because they use less intricate phrases . 
  losing a limb , kidney , eye is `` staying alive '' but these are life-changing conditions and surely there are a lot of traumas like this . 
  even though there are `` only '' 2 fatalities this person has dramatically changed lives of dozen ( s ) people today . 
  i hope society will help them to adapt . 
  as countermeasure to frozen accounts in france and belgium kremlin has decided to arrest russian assets in russia . 
  i 've tried to learn 6 languages and english is the only one which i can speak fluently ( at least i think i can speak fluently ) . 
  so i 'm glad it 's also used as international language . 
  but somehow i feel myself uncomfortable when i hear english mixed with russian - not sure why ? 
  ( `` user '' , `` party '' , `` fast '' are pretty much common russian words already ) p.s. 
  luckily , programming languages are dialects of english so for me it 's somewhat easy to learn and use them . 
  most likely i 'd never be able to learn programming language based on mandarin or german . 
  apparently `` independence '' from ussr made the region better . 
  i guess we need one-two more new celebrations like this one to become actually modern prospering european state * s * ... edit : now with 20 % more english . 
  economy is n't good - to put it mildly . 
  few days ago i 've seen article with data about consumer product sales ( food , electronics , cars , clothing , etc. ), 
  - year-to-year number has dropped by 10 % for april . 
  plus this number grow for each consecutive month . 
  edit : [ recent article ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/01/06/2015/556c0d3b9a7947115f2ee637 ) - 2,7 % in march , 4.2 % in april gdp loss year-to-year . 
  car sales dropped by 30-40 % depending on manufacturer ( 33 % for vaz in may ) , similar situation is in travel industry - that 's more like collapse rather than crisis . 
  s/he heard you like stereotypes so s/he added more stereotypes to your stereotypes . 
  centralised homo ** jew ** nazi corrupt junta , ftfy, 
  one more : ministry of import replacements decided to steal more money on yet another seemingly good * idea and started [ project to develop `` russian '' mobile os ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/17/05/2015/55585f5b9a79471191c70fb3 ) using help of our finnish neighbors and their [ jolla os ] ( https://jolla.com/ ) . 
  notice how they want to replace imported products with another imported product and call that `` import replacement '' to get funds . 
  \\* good to clowns in kremlin . 
  to me whole import replacement activity look purely idiotic - here is [ video which is called `` anthem '' of import replacements concept ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e00tpb9hmi ) in russia . 
  belgian hoegarden , german paulaner and franziskaner , danish faxe and australian fosters . 
  plus some sorts of mexican corona .
