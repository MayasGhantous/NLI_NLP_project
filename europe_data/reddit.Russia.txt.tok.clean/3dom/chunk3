  it 's not even putin 's invention - it was used in georgia 10 years prior to his presidency , then in moldova , then in georgia again - and in georgia eu even participated in this crap and confirmed [ it was georgia 's fault that russian federation has invaded them ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8281990.stm ) . 
  of course now some people need to cover up their incompetency ( or maybe corruption ? ), 
  and they declare it 's the first time they see these methods . 
  ( if i were european bureaucrat at the moment i 'd start investigations against those who confirmed version of rufed how government has moved 150 + tanks to georgian border and evacuated nearly 20k ossetians 2 weeks prior to the war - without intention to invade georgia ), 
  if i cut off 7 languages which i know only up to the level of cursing words ( online gaming huehuehue ) - then 2 human languages + 5 programming languages . 
  i heard people who speak different languages have multiple characters depending on the language they speak and sometimes i wonder if i have different character ( s ) when i use various coding languages ? ... 
  no problem , it 's ok - i did n't mean you 've offended me , i just pointed out i still think the fall of ussr was worth it despite deaths of my grandfather and grand-grandmother and loss of real estate . 
  someone had to pay the price for our ( relatively ) free future ( + tbh last 10 years of ussr were crappy with all those goods deficits , suppressed ethnic conflicts , sudden exchange of currency ) . 
  it could be less painful - in more democratic country , maybe - but for a giant communist state it was extremely smooth and i believe next time it will be even more smooth since everyone know how to act and what to do when ( not `` if '' ) it will happen again ? 
  not to mention russian federation seems to be well prepared for this scenario ( separated bureaucratic systems in different regions , regional visa/citizenship system , etc. 
  i would n't call denying quality food for the population and raising taxes `` dick waving contest '' . 
  example of what is happening here : 2 weeks ago i 've purchased meat for ~ 9 $ / kg , now it 's ~ 12 $ / kg . 
  33 % growth in just couple weeks . 
  it is kazakhstan . 
  both people in the video are locals . 
  author of the video has stopped random car and ask its owner to explain - why does he have flag of russian federation ? 
  person explain his wife is from russian federation . 
  author of the video said he see usage of rufed 's flag in kazakhstan ( instead of flag of kazakhstan ) as inappropriate from his point of view ( `` you live here , in kazakhstan , not in rufed '' ) and ask the owner of the flag to remove it and promise to never display it again within kazakhstan . 
  note : kazakhstan state was somewhat friendly toward ethnic russians so far - and it was the only southern ussr republic where russians were n't expelled deliberately ( ethnic cleansing ) or `` accidentally '' ( civil war between locals ) . 
  nope , not sure . 
  it 's still funny though . 
  i like how you are explaining it to one of those refugees whose family members were killed in the process . 
  i assure you - i am ok with ussr fall , it was right thing to do - just like putting down a dog with cancer instead of letting it to suffer for years . 
  if we wo n't allow rufed to fall apart peacefully kremlin will start a lot more wars + in the end it will be either best korea or yugoslavian scenario ( with possible use of thermonuclear weapons ) . 
  clearly a state which participated in / started 6 wars in 23 years can not exist within geographical borders of europe in xxi century . 
  if you 've forgot - it was yeltsin who started wars in chechya , abkhzaia and transistria . 
   it actually made everyone happy . 
  correct , i am in eastern europe and i feel so good about ussr fall ( despite loss of family members ) i want to see it again with rufed . 
  it is the right / good thing unlike pro-longing the agony of this dying empire for few more decades ( rufed * will * start more wars , kremlin has already started 6 wars in 23 years ) . 
  there is no need for `` yugoslavian situation '' since russian federation has its own - much better - `` ussrian situation '' which made everyone happy and went without any major conflicts . 
  both conflicts are exactly the same as in ukraine - artificially created by kremlin to prevent moldova and georgia joining nato ( and later eu ) . 
  allowing rufed to continue ussr 's trend and fall apart again would be a good start to reunite these countries . 
  30 seconds in google resulted in this marvel :  the war in georgia last year was started by a georgian attack that was not justified by international law , an eu-sponsored report has concluded . 
  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8281990.stm it 's very `` funny '' how international laws allowed russian federation to invade moldova and georgia under guise of `` peacekeepers '' in `` ethnic conflicts '' . 
  and it 's strange to see the very same laws do n't allow kremlin to do exactly the same in ukraine . 
  they use term `` civil war '' for invasion of rufed 's army . 
  nice piece of propaganda . 
  by the way , guys , as it is clear now - who are the bad guys in georgia and transistria + how bad are they - is there anything eu is going to do to help moldova and georgia to repel invasions of russian federation disguised as protection in ethnic conflicts ? 
  i remember 6 years ago there was a commission formed by european countries which declared it 's all georgians ' fault , so rufed * had * to invade them . 
  it say these war games are the answer to ( planned ) nato wargames in ukraine , these are extremely big ( 400 mechanized units including fighter jets and icbm carriers ) and their theme is to hide from satellites , to avoid attacks of fighter jets which use high precision weapons ( e.g. 
  to launch icbms no matter what ) . 
  as i said before - it look like the government is getting ready for wwiii . 
  and the best way to prevent it once and forever is to stop buying oil and gas and allow them to bankrupt themselves in couple years . 
   kgb agent not every kgb agent is good agent . 
  also power corrupt people and it look like vladimir vladimirovich is 2nd most powerful person in the world ( if not first ) . 
  ( also i believe vvp does n't participate in debates only because he had lost both attempts when he was right hand of sobchak ), 
  no problem !, 
  i 'm doing this for a year already . 
  however lately i almost do n't read/watch russian media ( except for few sites ) because there are almost no sources of information which do n't look like disgusting propaganda and i 've seen how under its pressure even smart people start to use terms `` mercenaries '' , `` fascists '' , `` nazis '' , etc. 
  toward ukrainians and eu/us and `` jews '' , `` fifth column '' , `` nation-traitors '' towards russians who are n't pro-kremlin . 
  i 'm afraid stupidity and apathy are contagious . 
  1 ) putin is awful public politician with zero to none debates experience , he speaks his mind openly ; 2 ) apparently `` ex-ussr territory is belong to us '' doctrine does not presume there are any long-term allies - only future targets for `` protective/humanitarian invasions '' . 
  after 23 years kazakhs have finally realized that , belorussians probably too .

  i heard south korean border guards use ropes and hold each other to prevent them being snatched and abducted by north korean soldiers . 
  perhaps neighbors of russian federation should start using the same tactics on their borders since rufed is turning into best korea anyway . 
  1 ) content changes hourly as both kremlin and separatists pretend they do n't know exact plan and act independently and 2 ) content does n't matter - result is defined in kremlin already , it 's the same as it was in georgia and moldova ( wasteland with handful of locals and `` russian peacekeepers '' around , readying next invasion ) . 
  right now kremlin is trying to force president of ukraine to pretend separatists are n't the kremlin itself ( and are n't just pro terrorists sent by kremlin but legitimate representatives of non-existent `` nation '' ) and start talking to them instead of kremlin . 
  for kremlin it embarrassing when poroshenko talk to them directly about peace - it `` uncover '' them as the other side of conflict . 
  at least kremlin has decency not to ask `` malaysian airlines '' to compensate cost of `` buk '' missile . 
  no problem . 
  however it should be noted that most citizens of rufed never change their place of residence thus do n't have a clue about actual situation and think it 's just like in every other country around . 
  i myself could n't understand - what is going on with all the excessive bureaucratic procedures ? 
  - till realized country is separated into pieces as if government was readying to a war or revolution ( separated regions still can act if some of them are lost ) and has exploited `` divide at impera '' principle to the point where association agreement with eu result in closer relationships than exist between rufed 's bureaucrats in different regions . 
  except for in russian bureacratic language * registracia * means `` regional citizenship '' and `` property ownership rights '' . 
  i guess it 's kind of sarcasm or doublespeak : * registracia * assumes minor procedure which should be quick and easy , but in reality exactly the opposite is happening . 
  multiple people went to jail in 3 major siberian cities for `` siberian federalization '' event . 
  ( what guy ? 
  where were many ), 
  what kind of information you need ? 
  there is n't much available because publishing articles with titles like `` our regions are less integrated than eu countries '' may result in jail term for `` enticing separatism '' . 
  citizens complain all the time about difficulties of legal ways to obtain * registracia * - apartments with this option usually cost more ( i guess they pay for `` protection '' of police to evict problematic tenants if needed ) . 
   travelling there on a car registered in moscow is a really bad idea i deliberately posted the video from tsukerova balka because these bastards search me each time i pass them + 3-4 times on the road afterwards during like 1-2 hours - no matter if i ( do n't ) have passengers ( friends or family ) . 
  and every time i hear speeches like `` next time use train or airplane , muscovite , we do n't want your kind here '' . 
  these are so-called `` kuban cossacks '' - our `` slavic brothers '' and `` countrymen '' , not chechens , ingush , dagestani . 
  here are speculations of educated insider . 
  if eu and us will provide slightly higher pressure ( some more sanctions + help to georgia , ukraine , moldova ) - there is good chance to see the fall of soviet reunion before world cup 18 . 
  it seems kazakhstan is already moving into this direction after recent phrase of putin how kazakhstan was created on a territory which never had any state on it - and belarus is openly exploit customs union to bypass kremlin 's self-inflicted sanctions and organize government-sponsored `` contraband '' of forbidden products from eu into russian federation . 
  it 's serious but it wo n't lead to new cold * war * - just a couple * cold battles * maybe - because population of rufed is close to boiling point ( it 's obvious kremlin has nothing to offer to develop the country - only prayers for higher prices of oil and gas and invasions into nearby countries ) , government 's bankruptcy and/or severe sanctions may spark explosion of separatism . 
  either rufed will remove putin and its government from control ( and army from ukraine , moldova , georgia ) or there is serious possibility for the `` empire '' to go belly up in couple years . 
  i bet local bureaucrats already have plans what to do as separate countries , in fact [ there are already ready-to-use customs post structures * inside * rufed ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gacjjl4wvsu ) + regions of rufed already act as separate states , they have less integration than countries in eu and that is why kremlin was so hysterical about ukraine and georgia signing association agreement with eu - because it 's almost the same level of integration as relations between regions within rufed . 
  another example : when a citizen move between regions of rufed she/he need passport and * visa on arrival * ( a.k.a. 
  `` registracia '' ) which is strongly linked to property ownership rights and act more like `` localized/temporary citizenship '' ( if you do n't own another real estate you can legally live within estate where you have * registracia * indefinitely without consent of other tenants ) so citizens either have to purchase real estate to acquire `` localized citizenship '' or bribe someone to get their passport stamped with local visa - i heard about case where 40,000 ( ! ), 
  people were illegally registered within the same real estate property in sochi ( by fsb itself , mind you ) . 
  anyway i do n't trust any reports which imply 100k `` strong '' abkhazian micro-nation ( half of which has fled to russia almost immediately ) could win a war against 2 millions georgians without direct involvement of russian army . 
  persons who wrote those reports should be checked for mental illnesses and/or bribery . 
  those 100k abkhazian even had `` their own '' fighter jet ( s ) which bombed georgians . 
  also i do n't remember * any * hrw representatives in abkhazia in 90s . 
  i guess if they 'd actually were there it could stop ethnic cleansing when people were killed in queues for bread for being half-georgian ( grandfather of my classmate in gudauta ) or russian ( my grandfather ) . 
  perhaps hrw should take less bribes from kremlin + media are perfectly aware about [ witnesses ] ( http://cyxymu.livejournal.com/ ) , they just did n't give a crap till exactly the same scenario started to work near eu borders . 
  some history . 
  21 years ago rufed offered truce between `` abkhazian rebels '' ( i.e. 
  army of rufed + chechens + handful of abkhazians ) and georgians in abkhazia . 
  both sides were asked to withdraw troops as far as possible from front line + to give up spare parts of artillery which would prevent its usage . 
  later it turned out only naive georgians removed their troops and disabled artillery so `` abkhazian rebels '' took capital of abkhazia ( and the rest of the region ) almost without any resistance . 
  1 ) rufed already does not operate within internationally recognized borders ( after annexation of crimea ) , it destroyed `` pax americana '' ( nobody annexed anything during 70 years ) and i bet us/gb/au / canada will provide a lot of pressure ; 2 ) rufed was n't created by will of its population but rather as a chunk of bigger structure and by will of corrupted bureaucrats , it does not have too much support among population ( up to suppressed civil wars in caucasus region , brewing separatism movements across whole country including regions populated by russians ) and with some pressure ( see 1 ) ) wo n't survive next deep crisis in single piece . 
  good news : russian federation does not operate as single country , but rather as a set of multiple separate quasi-states which have less integration than countries in eu - for example to move between regions ~ ~ you ~ ~ citizens need passport * and visa on arrival * ( without such visa there will be troubles with job search and local police ) - so fall will be almost `` painless '' , just like it happened with 1991 with ussr . 
  edit : you =  citizens, 
  [ now they talk about leaving ukraine ] ( http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2ftop.rbc.ru%2fpolitics%2f02%2f09%2f2014%2f946525.shtml%23xtor%3dal-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[main_item]-[title] ) to form `` independent '' `` state '' .
