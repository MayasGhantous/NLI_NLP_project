  '' [ noon universe ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noon_universe ) '' series by strugatsky brothers - '' [ the inhabited island ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9e%d0%b1%d0%b8%d1%82%d0%b0%d0%b5%d0%bc%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b2 ) '' for example . 
  strugatsky brothers are the best thing that happened to russian literature since bulgakov . 
  it 's like their '' [ hard to be a god ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hard_to_be_a_god ) '' describes today 's situation in rufed - but it was written 51 years ago ( for example , antagonist has exact features of putin - up to the point where pro-kremlin public hesitate to discuss this book in tv shows ) . 
  from recent authors it 's [ sorokin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_sorokin ) and his prophetic '' [ day of the oprichnik ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/day_of_the_oprichnik ) '' + `` telluria '' . 
  also books by victor pelevin - like '' [ generation pi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generation_%22%d0%9f%22 ) '' . 
  it grew up in numbers and [ opinions on many topics ] consolidated ( rufed helped a lot here ) but overall `` average per person '' activity is lower now ( check `` what happened in your country ? '', 
  threads ) . 
  also more people from different countries participate in the sub now - for example i 've seen georgian ( s ) lately ( \u10d2\u10d0\u10e3\u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10ef\u10dd\u10e1 ) . 
  edit : [ opinions on many topics ], 
  there are two variants with approximately the same meaning - `` motherland '' ( \u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 ) and `` fatherland '' ( \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e ) . 
  opinion is almost the same for all neighbors : inferior alien culture . 
  even though china is a source of good deals people understand chinese regime is n't nice ( lower salaries , zero to none social security ) . 
  they also understand that even such strange government as putin & oligarchs are better than their chinese counterpart - at least for now , until country did n't fall into yet another default . 
  2-4 % for whole economy may look like minuscule number however actual picture in day-to-day life is entirely different . 
  for example car sales dropped by 42.5 % in march ( year-to-year ) . 
  travel industry collapsed as well . 
  other industries soon to follow - and apparently that include the biggest corporation , government : they 've officially declared currency reserves will be depleted in 2017 with present pace ( or sooner - if iran will start to sell oil ) . 
  it 's like watching a house of cards falling apart - 1/7 of earth sized house of cards . 
  interesting part of that event are diaries of nicolas ii : he use exactly the same phrases/had same ideas as we can hear from state tv from putin & medvedev - how people can not revolt by themselves , they are naive and good-hearted and had to be deceived by provocateurs and foreign agents to start protesting on streets . 
  the only nicolas ' sentences i did n't hear from rufed state tv ( yet ) are `` these people are my children '' and `` i should forgive them '' ( after shooting and killing hundreds ) . 
  this economy growth ( if it actually exist ) is very far from common people who can witness processes which can be better described by `` collapse '' term : car sales have dropped by 42 % ( almost halved ! ), 
  year-to-year in march . 
  recently government admitted they 'll deplete all currency reserves in 2017 if oil price will be the same * but they have a good chance to drop in case if iran will be free of sanctions - and that means government is ready to print nearly-infinite amounts of rubles at will at any moment to save reserves . 
  so we may face hyperinflation in a year . 
  \\* if iran will be out of sanctions oil prices will drop . 
  and it look like kremlin is trying to prevent this scenario by delivery of aa missile systems to iran . 
  at least people are n't getting 2 year prison terms - [ like it was in ussr ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a2%d1%83%d0%bd%d0%b5%d1%8f%d0%b4%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%be ) . 
  not yet . 
   since then having a twitter account is even allowed in the army ? 
  it 's uncommon to an army but for pr department ( of fsb ) it 's ok . also i doubt there was a single buk unit in donetsk/luhanks region at that moment - afaik buks operate in groups consist of 3 + launchers and 1 command vehicle which communicate with stationary radars and/or optional mobile radar system . 
  however there is 1 more idea about the situation : perhaps this time it was actually lonely vehicle to prevent spreading of information about false flag operation and that was the reason why the operation has failed miserably - they did n't use proper communications . 
  or more plausible variant - hanlon 's razor : russian military personnel consist of idiots . 
   half-trained rebels were donated a buk mbts and aa systems cost millions of $ $ $ - nobody in their healthy mind would give hundreds of millions worth weapons to amateurs ( 20 tanks = $ 100m approximately ) , especially if these amateurs operate almost within rufed 's own borders . 
  furthermore buks can not be operated effectively without full ground radar system support ( its own radar system has range of 15-20km , airplanes can escape it in seconds even before missiles will be launched ) . 
  not only buk was operated by russian military but it most likely had data from rufed 's radar systems about location of airplanes - just these idiots shot down wrong airplane , probably during attempt to raise false flag ( there was russian airplane just few kilometers away ) . 
  often i see interesting but unpopular comments downvoted into oblivion - and often they are the most interesting part since they show diversity of opinions and/or unique level of stupidity ( or high intelligence ) of the poster . 
  remove the arrow from interface maybe ? 
  it 's being used to demonstrate disagreement mostly - against rules and common sense . 
  if a post does n't contribute to discussion it can be reported and deleted anyway . 
  `` brezhnev kiss '' would be considered gay propaganda in `` modern '' russia and theoretically may lead to jail term . 
  however certain cultures in russia practice friendly kissing ( cheek to cheek ) - caucasus region for example . 
  correct - 18.1 k , 17.8 k in 2012 . 
  ppp is on [ cia site ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rs.html ) , gdp graph is on google . 
  i 've calculate difference correctly nonetheless - 20 % ( 18.1 k vs 14.6 k ) . 
  or 19.33 % / 23.97 % if you do n't like rounded numbers . 
  in 2013 ppp was 20 % higher than gdp ( $ 17k vs $ 14k ) . 
  so at best real expendable `` ppped salary '' is $ 600 per month today ( 500 + 20 % ) if prices did n't scale proportionally to 40 % + ruble 's value loss . 
  and these numbers do not count growing unemployment - like government organizations firing 10 % of personnel here and there . 
  plus certain sectors of economy are imploding or nearly dead - overseas tourism , car assembling and sales . 
  average salary in russia is $ 500 . 
  if may counts as `` developed '' economy only if compared to some african countries - or ussr : when import goods first widely appeared in the country after 1991 then cost of dr. martens was close to a salary for 6 + months . 
  i see lebedev has disbanded his principle not to work with politics - and started in the most debatable way . 
  though i would n't be surprised if fsb is co-owning his business and it was just his favor to other shareholders for their `` protection '' . 
  [ top-10 empty business towers ] ( http://wellup.me/feed/professionalizm/top_10_samye_pustuyushchie_biznes_tsentry_moskvy/ ) in moscow +1 [ article ] ( http://www.rbcdaily.ru/market/562949994225949 ) . 
  freshly built skyscrapers ( 2013-14 ) have 50-100 % space unoccupied . 
  total unoccupied office space ( 1/6 , 15 % ) is 160 % bigger than total square of office buildings finished in 2014 in moscow . 
  not to mention fact business has lost its faith into this government completely - companies are closing their offices after record-low sales and in anticipation for more sanctions and lower oil prices . 
  perhaps you should - if it 's fake to change his identity and use stolen money overseas . 
  i mean people who display russian flags anywhere - they invite foreign army to their land , may provoke a war and should be treated as potential terrorists by counter-intelligence services . 
  kremlin like to supply concerned citizens with military weapons and explosives - both fake and real citizens . 
  someone should show them photos from bombed donbas to demonstrate - what happens in the regions where people go to meetings with flags of russian federation ? 
   14-year-old schoolgirl interrogated by security services for wearing ukrainian ribbons at least she was n't jailed for gay-jew-nazi propaganda . 
  for now . 
  i see this as a good reason for ( counter - ) intelligence services to watch activities of participants . 
  since invasion into georgia in 1992 there are `` rumors '' how kremlin like to provide explosives , military-grade weapons , urban warfare training to `` concerned ( nationalist ) citizens '' . 
  image was n't even published at all ( [ example of article ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/21/03/2015/550da54c9a794751cb4d83c5 ) ) because in russia it is forbidden to publish nazi symbols . 
  this state has outplayed itself ( again ) . 
  `` der spiegel '' knows how to make pro-kremlin russians happy : this cover is all over the news in russian federation today as if `` der spiegel '' has confirmed `` euro gay jew nazis '' concept . 
  it is easier to understand logic behind their decisions if you think about them as an occupation force instead of a government . 
  kremlin see as a threat anything that make it more difficult for them to invade nearby states . 
  church is the most powerful entity when it comes to traditions . 
  i heard in tv news how nato want to protect ethnic europeans on the territory of our baltic states . 
  damn aggressors !, 
  so far the only bad mojo i see is in your downvoted comment . 
  orthodox christians here burn pagan ritual statues , it 's disgusting and wo n't change anything but boost bad feelings towards orthodox christianity ( in my opinion exactly this religion is `` responsible '' for forming present russian mentality which endorse inequality , poverty , corruption ) . 
  couple days earlier general motors has declared they are stopping production of opel and chevrolet cars in rufed [ cnn ] ( http://money.cnn.com/2015/03/18/autos/gm-russia-business-plan/ ) , company is fireselling cars with 25 % discount . 
  because the corrupted government and inept russian prosecution system made him look like a martyr instead of actually investigating any possible/real crimes . 
  prosecution system in russia is inept and allow criminals to walk free ( and sometimes work in government , police , fsb ) instead of jailing them . 
  nobody want them to go visa-free to any country , population is just suffer `` collateral damage '' from idiocy and corruption of the government . 
  they kill people at will in the center of capitol ( not to mention caucasus and crimea ) - that does not look very far from `` classic '' variant . 
  only thing i see missing is militarization of society - which has started already ( in mild form ) . 
  then you should know fascism is different in each country . 
  right now we enjoy russian variant of fascism - with suppressed anti-communism ( because it 's utterly pointless : there are n't communist states left ) and mixed with lenin 's mausoleum and communist party in `` parliament '' . 
  if you know better variant you should correct article in wikipedia which i 've quoted . 
  right/left economy orientation ( collective vs `` private '' property ) . 
  valuable lesson : country is perfectly fine after 2 weeks without the `` dictator '' resolving every question like financing of short-range passenger trains . 
  here is definition :  nationalist authoritarian goals of creating a regulated economic structure to transform social relations within a modern , self-determined culture ; and a political aesthetic of romantic symbolism , mass mobilization , a positive view of violence , and promotion of masculinity , youth and charismatic leadership are any of these wrong regarding rufed ? 
  i also did n't like how they 've skipped invasion into georgia in 1992 - probably because at that moment putin did n't become a president yet , he was busy falsifying export/import permissions in spb . 
  it 's disgusting how the world has sided with putin in 2008 . 
  see - what happens when you support fascist states ? 
  they start to kill more people . 
  it turns out we can live without any president - despite propaganda slogans like `` nobody but putin '' . 
  nonethless missing putin declares he is [ ready to use nuclear weapons ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/15/03/2015/550584d79a7947586a7f0db9 ) . 
  i guess it 's a warning to those who want to use this situation to invade rufed and protect ethnic chinese during [ gkchp ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_committee_on_the_state_of_emergency ) -2 tv show . 
  they breed and/or die young . 
  30 is still somewhat old compared to 15yo african countries . 
  here is my theory about russian business : in overly corrupted environment it is easier to deal with ( mostly male ) authorities being a woman - men are less likely to assign high `` protection fee '' or fines when they deal with a woman * . 
  also those women can be bored wives/daughters of corrupted bureaucrats - like putin 's daughter manage $ 1.7 b worth business or [ tkachev ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_nikolayevich_tkachyov ) 's niece managing hundreds million worth company . 
  thus relatively high amount of women in business in russia . 
  \\* actually it 's not theory - i had some experience in this field .
