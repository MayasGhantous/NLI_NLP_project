  caucasus is the easiest region in russia to find random people to blame for terrorism/political killing and there will be the least amount of question about their involvement . 
  i believe this is correct comment : [ in soviet russia , suspects arrest you . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2y88o5/two_men_have_been_arrested_over_the_murder_of/cp76606 ), 
  their greed has ruined everything long time ago when they 've decided to concentrate country 's wealth in the hands of a hundred people . 
  now they are getting that they sown : instead of supporting the state poor people ask the government for money at any occasion , now even for more than before . 
  and the greed dictate them to reanimate stalinism and slavery - to keep all the money . 
  i guess they 'll fail miserably just like they did many times before . 
  average salary in georgia is the same ( 385 euro vs 386 ) - and the country has war on its territory for 20 + years and nearly zero natural resources to sell . 
  rufed 's government is among the least effective in the world yet these clowns are trying to oppose two most powerful economies . 
  if i was a conspiracy theorist i 'd say these people were hired by cia to dissolve whatever left from ussr ( rufed ) - and they are very effective in this field . 
  yup , this is correct variant ( fsb extort money from the government ) . 
  if rumors about them are true then they are responsible for many terrorist attacks in the country - if not for all ( simply by looking into different direction - like it could happen in case of nemtsov who was under their surveillance ) . 
  regarding nemtsov there are two popular theories : obvious - it 's fsb and putin because nemtsov said bad things about putin and wanted to publish details on the war with ukraine , overly complicated / dumb theory - putin 's enemies killed nemtsov to make us think bad about our saint dear leader ( as if people do n't think bad about him already ) . 
  sophisticated variation : fsb is extorting money from putin & co so they 've killed the least important politician but at the same time he was an enemy of putin so it 's kind of compensation for the act of disobedience . 
  let 's see if fsb will get increased financing soon - if so then it was sophisticated variant ( according to `` follow the money '' rule ) . 
  here is some thought-food for conspiracy theorists : previous terrorist act in russia ( explosion in provincial train station ) has happened few weeks prior to the end of multibillion anti-terror fsb financing program by the government . 
  of course financing stream was re-started immediately . 
  few weeks ago government declared they are about to cut financing of fsb which has to fire 10 % of its personnel . 
  also just hours ( feb , 26 ) prior to the murder state senate has increased security level . 
  it 's nice to see someone still like a nation which has no hope to get a good economy for centuries to come . 
  i mean - for centuries if it 'll survive in its present miserable state for more than a decade and wo n't be divided by its own kgb/fsb elite like it happened with ussr . 
   for one thing , it shows that we are capable of building a multinational and multifaith nation a nation without free financial market and without single independent bank ? 
  a nation which could raise its average salary ( 386 euro in 2014 ) to the same level as in poor , occupied georgia ( 385 euro ) where war last 20 + years and foreign troops reside on 1/3 of territory ? 
  that 's actually worst possible outcome for 23 years of work . 
  and the `` country '' has richest resources in the world including direct connection to two greatest economies ( eu + china ) . 
  \\ + no matter what i wo n't believe chechenstan and the rest of rufed are the same nation . 
  do you know putin & co have forbidden visit of dalai lama to buriatia by request of china ? 
  i bet buryats are n't happy about it and remember this very well . 
  thanks for correction !, 
  grand-grand-dads of course . 
  grand-dad has been killed in abkhazia after ussr was abandoned by its own government in 1991 and russians became co-targets for ethnic cleansing . 
  it 's difficult to be positive about soviet union when 3 out of 4 your grand-dads were jailed or killed during stalin rule for political ( or more like religious ) reasons . 
  not to mention legendary children dentistry without painkillers as late as in the end of 80s ( ! ), 
  perhaps that 's exactly the reason why mps want to lift up sanctions - they do n't want to see economically strong rufed and prefer putin & co to live off the oil-gas rent and import-export customs fees instead of local income taxes . 
  i see the problem as exactly the opposite : men did n't forgot the god , they 've replaced traditional christianity with lenin-stalin-communism-based religion and build the state without separation of church ( communist `` party '' ) . 
  that 's why there was/is typical religious fanaticism , inquisition-style purges , and that 's why communists destroyed most of churches - because christianity was a competing religion . 
  just like it happens on isis-controlled territories today . 
  one religious cult satirized another religious cult - this could be funny if 10m + people did n't perish in inquisition-like purge . 
  no need to type that much to state that 50 % loss of usd/eur value is considered a growth in rufed because ruble is more volatile than bitcoin . 
   instead of ukraine , russia is not a mono-ethnic not yet - until glorious leader will decide to imitate yet another coup-d-etas to let the regions like chechnya , dagestan , tatarstan , etc. 
  go - just like it happened in 1991 . 
   russian food producers , who do n't have costs in usd thanks for high quality propaganda , tovarish !, 
  it 's not like russian food producers use nearly 100 % imported ingredients , equipment , breeding material . 
  even basic stuff like hops for beer is almost 100 % imported . 
  more like best korea . 
   benefit `` benefit '' should be used in quotes because population 's income / salaries calculated in usd has lowered by 60 % so 50 % of today 's spending ( 100 % - 60 % = 40 % / 2 ) is equal to 20 % of expenditures two years ago . 
  * people spend twice less money ( value ) on food now . 
   negative results yet much , much better than in libya or egypt though . 
  for most east-european countries it took 10 + years to visibly recover from soviet `` non-occupation '' , i 'm sure it will be the same with ukraine if not better/faster ( more natural resources , better motivation ) . 
  i think 3 + countries would join immediately to avoid more kremlin 's `` protective annexations '' . 
  because anschl\u00fcsse sounds much more evil than annexation . 
  it 's not exactly re-branding . 
  it 's a separate army ( 170-400k people depending on source ) with `` green light '' to shoot citizens - previously this `` privilege '' was available only to fsb ( ~ 25k people including border guards ) . 
  also - unlike police and fsb which have their own commanders/directors - this army is in direct control of the unaccountable president who is one of the most corrupted officials on the planet . 
  but now it will be more expensive to close the wider gap to desired 140 % . 
   country ~ ~ was ~ ~ is basically controlled by mafia . 
  fixed that for you . 
  i guess you 've missed the news where rufed 's attorney 's general son had common business with a gang which killed ~ 15 people at once including 3 children + burning an infant alive . 
  and putin himself use state money to provide contracts to his friends ' companies who in exchange [ buy real estate for allegedly his daughter tikhonova , kabaeva and her family , kharcheva ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/politics/31/03/2016/56fd234c9a79471a62c3fd8a ) and probably other people who provided `` favors '' to him . 
  fyi organizations like this are called `` mafia '' and `` organized crime '' . 
  edit : link . 
  this shit is actually scary . 
  thanks , comrades !, 
  see you in [ gulag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gulag ) . 
  happy easter !, 
  i guess my family is the only one in my town who are aware of this variant of spring equinox celebration so we do it quietly . 
  i just walk in the nearby park thanking nature for yet another wonderful spring i may witness . 
  [ there were no news about this crime ( which actually look like a terrorist act ) on the federal and moscow tv channels ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/01/03/2016/56d48e289a79477f2af24d82 ? ), 
  - it look like federal authorities have prohibited it . 
   ukraine military force is nothing i could accept this explanation 2 years ago but today it looks really strange . 
  country with 40m + population can not build a size-able army during 2 years ? 
  what are you waiting for , people ? 
  third party - like uncle sam , nato , turkey - defending your country for you or maybe russian occupation expanding to the point where kremlin wo n't need anymore land for the next decade ? 
  that will take whole south of ukraine - all the way to moldova . 
   russia is clearly ally whose ally ? 
  after ukraine broke up with kremlin in attempt to join eu + belarus going the same way ? 
  if anything eu is # 1 threat for rufed 's existence because we 'll see more russian-speaking regions attempting to join european union sooner or later . 
  edit : 20 % more english now . 
  one of the towns ( krasnoyarks 26 ) had a goatse as its [ coat of arms ] ( http://rlv.zcache.com/krasnoyarsk_26_atomic_bear_shirt-r091fdc1865b34980b4cff626d9d31b45_jooai_1024.jpg?rlvnet=1 ) before it was cool ( albeit with with russian and scientific accents ) . 
  money is their motivation , not the power - otherwise this state would n't have to imitated coup-d-etas in 91 to disband ussr . 
  they have disbanded country in 91 to gain money , they 'll do it again to keep the money . 
  also best korea is much smaller and does not have common border with eu - which is practically the same structure as rufed but much more successful and rich i.e. 
  it will trigger civil wars for the western territories to join eu - like it has happened in ukraine . 
  the power without oil money will be too costly . 
  present state is too expensive to maintain after $ 100 oil and latest idiotic decisions like cutting off import from government 's own purchases ( it has increased spending by 40 % ) . 
  not going to church weekly does n't mean changing to `` amorphous '' culture , its basement is still christian . 
  or do you actually mean european culture is now more islamic than christian ? 
  similar to kuwait , uae , egypt ? 
  rational people would n't dismiss their state to privatize its natural resources and change ideology - for example china did n't do it . 
  ussr has been ruled by the similar kind of mafia as russian federation , we 'll be just fine when it will be disbanded - in fact we 'll be much better than 20 years ago because we have an experience how to deal with this type of shit . 
  anarchy . 
  rufed has destroyed the territory ( by expelling local georgians , greeks , russians ) and in exchange gave locals cart-blanch to do whatever they please - within certain logical borders where `` borders '' means locals can not create actual state , can not join georgia and can not * rob buses with tourists using machine guns and assault rifles * - otherwise fsb would interfere ( actual episode near lake ritsa from ~ 2005 ) . 
  everything else is pretty much permitted so locals feels themselves somewhat free and use their freedom wisely - up to unsuccessfully shooting their local president using rpgs ( episode from ~ 2011 iirc ) . 
  it seems so . 
  because training and equipping ( islamist ) freedom fighters is really good idea - is n't it ? 
  double points if they already live in your own country . 
  from what i 've seen abkhazians themselves could n't start a public garbage collecting service - let alone a war , it 's a myth created by kremlin to cover up yet another invasion . 
  up to the point where 80-thousands `` strong '' quasi-nation had it 's own military jets ( ! ) . 
  what i 've actually seen were thousands chechens exported by rufed and trained by rufed 's military intelligence - exactly [ those chechens who later terrorized rufed itself ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shamil_basayev ) . 
  abkhazians themselves simply could n't resist that - because there was just a handful of them ( less than 90k in 1992 ) .
