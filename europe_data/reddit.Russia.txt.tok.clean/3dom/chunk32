  you are correct - there are people who risk their health in abkhazia . 
  because they believe in kremlin 's fairy tales how abkhazians are `` our brothers '' ( instead of a mini-nation whose land has been destroyed by rufed ) . 
  one of the latest examples ( ~ 2013 ) was a friend of mine whom i could n't stop : he was an owner of somewhat big travel company and wanted to check if the region is suitable for his business ? 
  as result he and his wife spent most of his 2 weeks long voyage recovering from infection in the first couple days ( remember about public garbage service ? ) . 
  after that episode i 've asked him if he is going to visit the place again or sell tours there ? 
  - `` absolutely no '' - `` why ? '', 
  - `` local population '' . 
  i find it fascinating to hear about natural resource prices as important factor from people living in countries which produce space rockets . 
  having 40m + population , huge territory and people 's will to become better place ukraine does n't need any enemy corpses floating nearby or resource-dependent economy to become a somewhat successful state . 
  abkhazia is actually far worse than a desert . 
  ~ 5 years ago i 've asked my friend ( he lived in abkhazia before the war and has armenian heritage ) to accompany me during short business trip into the `` country '' - he looked at me like i 'm an idiot and asked `` are you seriously consider going there ? '' . 
  i had to pretend it was a bad joke - because going to abkhazia actually put one 's life in danger . 
  semi-fresh story - from 2012 : locals made few shots from handgun to stop tourist on a bicycle because they wanted to ride the bike . 
  that happened on the streets of biggest town during day time . 
  that is actually easy to solve : government just have to turn the regions into empty wastelands like they did with south ossetia ( by staging needless war with georgia and evacuating/displacing all locals ) after people there tried to remove kremlin 's puppet kokoity in 2008 . 
  when the oil will cost the same as during yeltsin 's era ( 10-15 $ ) then the salaries in russian federation will be lower than in ukraine ( they are already twice lower than in china ) - which kremlin invaded for being `` poor and corrupted '' . 
  i guess if oil prices will stay low for 5-10 years we 'll have a chance to see kremlin `` invading '' itself by staging yet another coup-d-etas - like it 's 1991 again . 
  edit : because with present regime this huge territory is n't economically viable as a single state w/o profitable natural resource transportation network . 
  for example - who is going to feed caucasus republics without easy money from oil and gas ? 
  and instead of building normal capitalism the government will have to dissolve country and hide in one of its pieces because they have to keep `` not stolen '' money - it will be impossible to do in a normal ( capitalist ) country with functional parliament , independent courts and state security agency which is n't too busy doing business instead of its actual work ( including anti-corruption investigations and protection of journalists ) . 
  whatever you think is there - it clearly does n't work as connection between eu and china to the point there chinese government had to duplicate its functionality through 4 countries and 2 seas on path . 
  it is ironic how government of russian federation does not have enough brains and will to utilize its unique ( and obvious ! ), 
  location between 3 major economic superpowers so china has to use * ex-ussr territory * to connect with eu . 
  your husband is a lucky man . 
  rammstein , [ okean elsy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbkevjgrbus ) ( ukrainian ) , wardruna / [ fehu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbgvgk50e94 ) ( music from vikings tv series ), 
  he does n't have to have it - anyway tens of millions of russians follow idiotic ideas which milonov is voicing . 
  selling ( and moving ) slaves was legal in russia in the first half of xix century - there is a great book in this historical setting : '' [ dead souls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dead_souls ) '' by gogol . 
  this is called `` russian unemployment '' - instead of firing people to cut off expenses the companies `` just '' severely reduce salaries ( or simply continue paying the `` same '' salaries using devaluing ruble ) . 
  in a capitalist country with any form of professional unions that would result in country-wide strikes but it 's not the case for countries with state capitalism : instead of fighting with individual capitalists professional unions would fight with the government itself ( and its police , army , etc. ) . 
  so people just suck it up and work for twice less money without saying a word ( + there are no pro unions except for couple government-controlled structures like police union ) . 
  for population reality is much worse than abstract macro-economy data - its economy is galloping straight into poverty of 90s ( and not in the distant future but in the next year ) . 
  during last summer average salary was ~ 33k rubles , usd/r exchange rate = 30 ( i.e. 
  1100 $ salary ) ; average salary today is still ~ 32k but exchange rate is 66 ( i.e. 
  $ 500 salary ) . 
  people lost half + of their income during a year . 
  now average salary in china is 1.5 times higher than in russia ( 750 $ ) . 
  when oil will drop below 25 $ ( next autumn probably ) when the salaries in russia will drop below salaries in ukraine - the country which kremlin wanted to `` liberate '' for being poor and corrupted and [ according to mr. putin himself ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/03/opinion/stent-putin-ukraine-russia-endgame/ ) it can not even be called `` a country '' . 
  day-to-day economy is collapsing * already so additional sanctions wo n't make a difference here . 
  \\* example : year-to-year pc import has dropped by [ ** 45 % ** in the third quarter of 2015 ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/56567d9a9a794771136d516d ) . 
   only ukrainian nationalists correction : to date . 
  i bet kazakhs will join them sooner or later . 
  losing ~ 40 % of an ethnic group can not be dismissed as a method of political struggle - especially when it was precisely targeted . 
  [ different kind ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42nd_street_%28musical%29 ) . 
  you are losing an opportunity : after [ terrorist act in moscow ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_theater_hostage_crisis ) i went to every single musical show because i could sit on the most expensive ( and empty ) sits for the price of the cheapest tickets . 
  yup , the nation has the exact state it want and deserves . 
  in rufed local `` village '' ( town ) courts can ban internet content for whole 1/7 of earth 's surface sized country . 
  more than that - you can tip authorities anonymously about certain sites and pages and if they 'll find content offensive ( at discretion of a group of strange 25-30 years old people who are more like system admins rather than lawyers ) they may add any site to country-wide block lists without court decision . 
  correction - headline should be like this : court in chechnya bans charlie hebdo twitter for whole rufed because it 's country-wide ban . 
  a country with an unlucky authoritarian leader who barely control his badly trained military which ( probably ) has a habit to shoot passenger airplanes ( mh17 + [ kal 007 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_007 ) ) and fly military jets with full load during active combat into third party airspace multiple times - this is a recipe * for the disaster waiting to happen . 
  however in this case it look like turkey simply wanted to ignite conflict between nato and rufed to prevent military cooperation in syria which could make turkish interests irrelevant - and it look like rufed 's military itself has handed out reasons for turks to do that : turkey can now use the same excuse as rufed in ukraine - protection of ethnically close turkmen people in syria + airspace violation on top of that . 
  edit : 2 airplanes . 
  \\* edit 2 : now [ rufed is tossing fighter jet escorts ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/politics/24/11/2015/5654ad169a79476305f748de ) to that recipe - and air-to-air missiles can fly as far as [ 400km ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/r-37_%28missile%29 ) + pilots surely will be stressed ( turkey 's air defense is no joke as we could see ) and maybe even actively seek conflict . 
   you can even buy kindersurprise in each shop that 's low ... 
  however there is a chance the person do n't understand it because as a usian s/he have never seen kindersurprise and do n't know how wonderful it is . 
   includes hospitals according to authorities they have fuel reserves for [ 29 days ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/56515c4f9a79472c7ed115e6 ) for generators for hospitals , airport , bus stations , military base , etc. 
  edit : ukraine supplied [ 70 % ] ( http://ria.ru/society/20151122/1325981272.html ) of all electricity consumption in the region , crimea still get 1/3 of its normal electricity supply . 
  despite the title blackout is n't `` total '' . 
  nobody would give paramilitaries buk launcher which cost like $ 10m and takes years to study its operations - even rufed 's own soldiers are n't allowed to operate it ( only officers with special courses ) . 
  most likely shooting was orchestrated and performed by the same idiots which are now firing missiles daily into syria at eu 's borders ( i did n't heard anyone was prosecuted here after mh17 ) . 
  there is a chance for repeating mh17 as long as rufed 's military is involved - you could see their work with the buk . 
  alright , here is one more argument : nobody in their healthy mind would present modern aa missile launchers to a guerilla ( even manpads are dangerous for civilian air traffic , let alone buks ) , those were idiots from the military - most likely the same military ( rufed 's ) which is shooting rockets near syria left and right at this moment . 
  so we have a chance to see more `` mistakes '' like mh17 if they 'll be allowed to operate along with eu/us forces - they did n't even prosecute anyone for the plane , not officially at least . 
   mh17 was hardly a terrorism act if it was a mistake . 
  what kind of mistake do you think happened ? 
  it 's impossible to mistake huge passenger aircraft flying on 11km for smaller military transport aircrafts flying at 4-6km . 
  the only `` mistake '' which could occur is shooting mh17 instead of a russian plane ( to create false flag for invasion into ukraine ) - which is pretty much a terrorist act . 
  it 's ridiculous how i am , rufed 's resident , have to explain europeans how it 's not in their best interests to behave like nothing happened thus allowing more `` mistakes '' with their aircrafts in the future : there are still 3 military conflicts within european geographic borders . 
  could you , please , explain - are you going to allow kremlin to consume ex-ussr territory - including moldova , ukraine , georgia - ( and kill thousands more europeans ) because they 've fired some rockets into is ? 
  that explanation would save me from migrating from rufed to future rufed - from moscow to kiev . 
  anyone remember if they have paid anyone for any information ? 
  i do n't + i doubt fsb will ever start doing that - otherwise they 'll steal whole budget for themselves immediately because nobody can check their activity ( the last person who attempted to do that - anti-corruption police general - [ suddenly threw himself out of the window ] ( http://www.bbc.com/russian/russia/2014/06/140616_general_kolesnikov_suicide ) ) . 
  so far it look like a cynical pr trick . 
  they 'd better use ( part of ) these money to help relatives of the victims . 
   what 's the mood in russia now mostly usual apathy . 
  until there is no proof we did n't do anything ... p.s. 
  frankly , i 'm afraid to type actual list . 
  [ they are killing people here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natalya_estemirova ) . 
   a civil war in caucasus region - or at least very strong rebel activity  what a bullshit . 
  then how do you call [ clashes with heavy weaponry usage in the center of grozny last year ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/05/world/europe/grozny-chechnya-attack.html ) ? 
   i see which kind of man you are . 
  i 've seen worse : people calling a bunch of terrorists `` a government '' after they 've ordered destruction of passenger aircraft with 200 people . 
  in libya [ for example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan_am_flight_103 ) . 
   btw , fyi its not caucasus that is a real problem . 
  [ 875 servicemen have died in caucasus region during 5 years ] ( http://topwar.ru/85887-antiterroristicheskie-operacii-na-severnom-kavkaze-za-5-let-unesli-zhizni-okolo-900-silovikov.html ) - 1 soldier every other day . 
  us casualties in afghan war are 2,326 people during 14 years , one soldier every other day . 
  de-facto we have a civil war in caucasus region - or at least very strong rebel activity - it 's just majority of population do n't think thousands of killed caucasians and servicemen are a problem as long as rebels do n't commit terrorist acts outside of caucasus region . 
  edit : i mean - imagine - what will happen if ( when ) the government go bankrupt couple years later and fsb wo n't have enough finances to continue killing of dagestani , chechens , ingush , crimean tatars in their native regions ? 
  i bet tajicks wo n't come even close to taking [ ~ 700 hostages in a theater in the center of moscow ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_theater_hostage_crisis ) . 
  my deepest condolences and sympathies to the families and friends , to the nation . 
  it make me even more sad that i 'm typing text like this second time during this year for the same nation . 
  vive la france !, 
  same situation as in rufed - everyone want proof links but there are none . 
  however there is another side of the medal : there is also * no proof against your statements * - except for official `` information '' which is just a pile of unconfirmed garbage . 
  you mean more workers and land is a bad factor for business ? 
  they also have huge shoreline compared to singapore . 
  mardan palace is named after father of its original owner - telman ismailov - whose companies are going through bankruptcy procedure after his cherkizovsky market in moscow has been shut down by authorities . 
  cost of the building was $ 1.4 b , present asset cost in bankruptcy case is closer to $ 200m . 
  not only saudis like to waste money . 
  they could use the same resource as singapore - position on shipping route . 
  de jure there is some kind of top officials , de facto there is none : top ethnic group is only 20 % of the population in that region ( dagestan ) and `` republic '' is n't homogeneous so top official barely control anything .
