  article describes * military operation against state pension fund * . 
  it 's like he does n't have a clue how caucasus region is already unstable with almost daily [ large scale ] ( http://www.aif.ru/society/safety/v_shesti_rayonah_dagestana_zavershilas_kontrterroristicheskaya_operaciya ) military operations * against both [ local authorities ] ( http://www.utro.ru/articles/2015/10/22/1258814.shtml ) and [ rebels ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/05/world/europe/grozny-chechnya-attack.html ) * . 
  it was '' \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0430 '' , i 'm not sure about its availability on yt . 
  context has been like `` you could see how protests in arabian countries and ukraine resulted in revolutions , therefore where is n't such thing as peaceful protests '' . 
  edit : and ukraine . 
  i believe he has mentioned ukraine as well . 
  yes - it was him , talk show with roman babayan ~ 10 days ago . 
  he was in the government and this `` parliament '' is irrelevant so independent politicians are more significant than any of the conformists in the `` parliament '' . 
  anyway i 've re-phrased it since there are no leading politicians in the country ( i do n't see anyone is leading the nation anywhere ) . 
  ** russian federation ** , it turns out sanctions make people kill people * a321 crashed over sinai , 220 people dead [ rt ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/320217-russian-plane-off-radars/ ) * one of the ~ ~ leading ~ ~ significant politicians in the country - [ sergey stankevich ] ( http://www.persona.rin.ru/eng/view/f/0/17133/stankevich-sergey-borisovich ) - said in talk show `` there is no such thing as peaceful protests '' - meaning they see every person with chunk of paper in his hands as a dangerous rebel who is about to start a revolution ; * our corrupt president 's press-secretary declared his millions-worth real estate is a property of his new wife ( [ navka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatiana_navka ) ) - who is a resident of us , anti-corruption activist navalny has asked us tax office to check her income and its sources - and tax them ; * navalny 's brother oleg - who is being held as a hostage by authorities - was [ sent to strict regime jail cell ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/562645ea9a7947020f03563d ) ; * [ a person in depression from economic troubles has killed his two children ] ( http://www.gazeta.ru/social/2015/10/19/7829963.shtml ) and attempted to kill his wife , authorities are trying to paint him as a crazy junkie ( police investigators in videos : `` you have killed them because you consumed drugs , right ? 
  right ? 
  '' ) ; * businessman has killed his business partner and two semi-high ranked local bureaucrats after they 've failed to pay him additional $ 20m compensation for his share in business ( they had common business ) , then the person has killed himself . 
  smartphone of the businessman [ has been destroyed ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/society/26/10/2015/562e6ad19a7947aca26aa21b ) - most likely by police to cover up the situation . 
  one of the guns used in the crime has been [ signed by kalashnikov personally ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/5628f2619a79474b079f1e49 ) . 
  authorities have to use damage control again - [ they are trying to pretend the person was crazy ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/society/24/10/2015/562b338d9a7947774a5a390e ) . 
  people think the [ actual reason is rouble 's exchange rate drop ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/society/20/10/2015/5625e89d9a7947979f3efda0 ) ( so the $ 20m difference appeared ) - i.e. 
  the reason is sanctions and government 's clueless activity ( and corrupted state where business is being controlled by authorities officially ) . 
  * [ ukraine has closed airspace for russian civilian airplanes ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/politics/25/10/2015/562bf1cc9a7947bbedc86c6e ) , kremlin is asking to reconsider , ukrainians call that `` begging '' . 
  note : a lot of travel companies in russia are on verge of collapse , this `` air embargo '' may become the last straw for some of them . 
  * [ us investigate deutsche bank for violation of finance sanctions against rufed ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/finances/25/10/2015/562d401b9a79475a20715030 ) : db 's department in moscow sold some shares to locals for roubles ( legally ) , then db sold these shares in london for $ $ $ ( legal operation ) and transferred the money to shares ' owners . 
  in the end db 's clients in moscow got $ 6 billions through so-called `` mirror deals '' . 
  * government has re-created pioneer [ youth organization from ussr times ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/politics/29/10/2015/5632253a9a7947a084313544 ) ( with different title so far ) ; * [ government is trying to make permanent ties with kurdistan ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/politics/20/10/2015/562589ac9a79476d83f7dd97 ) , next i expect them to do the same with isis sooner or later ( otherwise i can not explain - why do rufed 's jets do n't attack isis in syria ? ) . 
  * [ the state is accepting anti money laundering policy of council of europe ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/politics/28/10/2015/563036629a79478201e009f4 ) - perhaps they 've realized they 've turned whole state and corrupted - and rich !, 
  - bureaucrats into juicy targets for criminals and ( soon ) very angry population which quickly descends into poverty ; * there was anti- ( or pro- ? ), 
  corruption [ operation in dagestan with military equipment ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/society/22/10/2015/562891699a794767dbf2ca7c ) ( apcs ) * against local authorities * ; * [ companies in rufed have lost almost 4/5 of profit ( 77 % ) year-to-year ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/562d9ded9a79477e2ab2e6fe ) in august ; * and surely we have some good news too : we are getting [ free chargers for phones and tablets in subway in moscow ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/5626887a9a7947659ead2e3b ) . 
  edit : and scary [ russian halloween pumpkin ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ptmdq6ygnrw/tqxqlomjsmi/aaaaaaaaaa0/e3we-nzmnzi/s1600/img_4977.jpg ) in the end .

  gossip time . 
  what would be the most devastating sabotage act in the world which would n't involve killing people ? 
  it look like our `` friends '' in kremlin have found the answer : damage trans-oceanic data cables . 
  these transfer information which move $ 10 trillions daily and they are really easy to locate . 
  here goes [ nyt article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/world/europe/russian-presence-near-undersea-cables-concerns-us.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=2 ) about this situation . 
  note : couple weeks ago few newspapers have published information how the government has conducted multiple tests to cut off whole country ( russian federation ) from the internet . 
  tests involved most major isps in the country . 
  and i had really bad connection ( 2 + isps ) from august , 2014 to april . 
  guys in kremlin are pretty serious about the internet . 
  thank you for your work in these daily threads !, 
  i appreciate amount of effort you put into this sub - and i 'm sure others appreciate it too ( just i 've never seen anyone thanking you ) . 
  [ les revenants ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2521668/ ) got season 2 after 3 years downtime . 
  one of the best tv series in europe , [ it has been re-filmed in hollywood ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230780/?ref_=tt_rec_tt ) . 
  copy of my standalone comment : [ les revenants ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2521668/ ) got season 2 after 3 years downtime .

  [ rouble exchange rate has fallen by ~ 1 % after these news ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/finances/16/10/2015/5620d89f9a794784cc0fd3fb ) . 
  this economy and finance system is so fragile it make me afraid of government 's default if turkey will shoot down a fighter jet ... edit : / s, 
  color scheme on the plane look very close to the flag of rufed and surely will re-animate debates how russian plane was an actual target for the launcher crew to create a false flag for full-scale russian invasion into ukraine . 
  as if launcher crew has used visual recognition instead of usual ground radar system support . 
  i believe syria is used to distract public * from events in ukraine and probably kremlin will abandon assad on the next day after sanctions will be lifted . 
  \\* people may become very angry if they 'll realize they 've instantly lost 20-30 % of income because idea of territorial expansion in europe may only result in major losses in xxi century . 
  during 1.5 years they 've consumed tremendous amount of propaganda how territorial expansion and help to russian-speaking neighbors is our primary goal in life but now it look like all losses were completely pointless - just like the whole concept of rufed 's politics ( territorial expansion back into ussr borders and maybe f\u00fchrer ) . 
  congratulations on the second nobel prize in the history of turkey !, 
  and my deepest condolences to your nation and especially to the people who have lost their relatives in the blasts . 
  i 've read something about falling ratings 1 + months ago and literally on the next day i 've seen news how ukrainian `` rebels '' has started to follow cease fire agreement . 
  it look like the government will try to lift sanctions asap by giving up eastern ukraine back to kiev during next few months . 
  ** russian federation ** , government is too busy bombing syria to fix economy * 26 missiles were launched by ships in caspian sea , there are reports about [ 4 crashes ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34479873 ) on iran 's territory , the rest hit something in syria ( 1500km distance ) where government 's forces took over couple towns during this week ; * i guess these are related news : greek government report 75 % increase in amount of refugees coming from syria ( [ from 4000 per day in september to 7000 per day in october ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3o39pc/migrant_arrivals_in_greece_surge_to_7000_daily_iom/ ) ) ; * russian military jets have [ violated turkey 's airpspace ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/05/turkey-says-russian-warplane-violated-airspace ) and locked onto turkish f-16 in the process of bombing syrians . 
  there are [ some tweets ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/611157/russia-turkey-jet-plane-shot-down-airspace-syria-isis-islamic-state ) about downed russian plane , these look like a hoax ; * * car sales have dropped by [ 29-42 % ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/business/07/10/2015/56155e459a7947292d916190 ) * year-to-year in september . 
  economic collapse make more severe sanctions against russian federation pointless : for example standard prohibition to sell luxury goods ( including cars ) will not be needed because in few months nobody will be able to buy luxury goods ( including cars ) anyway ; * [ lukashenko is refusing ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/politics/06/10/2015/5613ebe59a794769839c9e3f ) to allow building rufed 's military base in belarus . 
  his motivation : rufed 's military base in crimea was used to seize the region . 
  similar situation happened in south ossetia ( and abkhazia ) . 
  it 's difficult to fool people four times using the same trick ... 
  union jack and [ georgian flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_georgia_%28country%29 ) . 
  it look like the flag of zheleznogorsk is a prototype/concept for goatse ... 
  what 's wrong with liberland ? 
  if i were a cynic i 'd say these are sanctioned by lukashenko to demand few more billions $ $ $ from kremlin . 
  [ last year 's wolverine ] ( http://img.izismile.com/img/img7/20141007/640/cool_photos_from_russias_first_ever_comic_con_640_38.jpg ) was nearly perfect as well . 
  ** russian federation ** , all middle-easterners look like isis to us * comic con 2015 moscow - [ photos ] ( https://vk.com/album-19043_221989642 ) + more [ photos ] ( http://www.kinokadr.ru/gallery/2015/10/02/comiccon/ ) - warning !, 
  - ads with sound here ; * government has admitted we are bombing someone in syria for couple weeks ( 34 fighter jets total ) , * putin got official permission to use army anywhere outside of rufed borders * . 
  our media insist it 's only for syria ; * turkey , us , uk , [ saudis ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/01/10/2015/560ce8309a7947ca779c3b2b ) , etc. 
  ask us to stop bombing `` moderate opposition '' in syria , government says [ us-backed rebels look exactly like isis to our pilots ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11903702/russias-vladimir-putin-launches-strikes-in-syria-on-isil-to-us-anger-live-updates.html ) ; * [ osce has spotted ] ( http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/186276 ) distinctively russian weapon system in `` donbabwe people 's republic '' ( + [ bbc article ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34425454 ) ) - [ thermobaric missile launcher ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tos-1 ) which has n't been sold to ukraine thus - unlike buks , ~ 500 t-72 tanks , a hundred of 152mm howitzers - could n't be purchased on local flea market from babushkas by vacationing russian troops . 
  nonetheless these are completely legal from kremlin 's point of view considering putin got a permission to use whatever armed forces he need anywhere ; * country is about to lose substantial part of travel agencies as major air travel company - [ transaero - has declared bankruptcy ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/560fe4029a79475d0177833e ) . 
  government 's [ aeroflot is talking ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/business/03/10/2015/560fad5f9a7947d539fd962c ) about laying off 1/3 of personnel to survive ; * during last year population has lost more than half of savings and income has decreased so [ average russian has 13 % less liquid assets than average ukrainian ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/money/29/09/2015/560a7e119a794703cc3a51e0 ) now . 
  a year earlier russians had twice more cash than ukrainians ; * [ consumer market is collapsing ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/29/09/2015/560a92159a79477f730e37bc ) : in august population has purchased 20 % less clothing than a year earlier , its manufacture has decreased by 25 % , cars manufacture - by 26 % . 
  apparently the government does n't think sanctions are a joke anymore - and `` suddenly '' it turned out `` ukrainian rebels '' are n't a separate uncontrollable force so they follow disarmament treaty between russian federation and ukraine for few weeks already ; * [ 80 % of cheese in the shops in rufed contain vegetable oil ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/business/01/10/2015/560d34ce9a79476b06409e09 ) i.e. 
  it 's fake . 
  edit : ministry had to re-phrase their report - it turns out `` only '' [ 10-15 % of cheese is fake overall , up to 50 % of probes in moscow region and 66 % in kaluga region ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/business/04/10/2015/5611537b9a79478004d50359 ) ( and 15-20 % of butter ) . 
  it look like we 'll see yet another wave of refugees in europe soon ... 
  with mh17 we 've seen what happens when these systems are n't strictly controlled . 
  i bet everyone has learned the lesson - including kremlin . 
  `` ukraine rebels '' should be used in quotes . 
  because nobody in their healthy mind - even idiots in kremlin - would allow militia to drive ~ $ 5m worth tanks , modern aa missile systems , 152mm mobile howitzers and [ thermobaric missile launchers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tos-1 ) . 
  these are certainly piloted by rufed 's military . 
  my plan exactly . 
  i 'm looking for a job there atm - payment is approximately the same as in moscow but everything is ~ 1.5 times cheaper . 
  staying in rufed makes even less sense than before . 
  i admire your ability to stay positive after news how [ average russian ( you ? ), 
  is now 13 % less wealthy than average ukrainian ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/money/29/09/2015/560a7e119a794703cc3a51e0 ) . 
  karma at its best : attacker has suffered more than the victim . 
  even indians are a bit ( 2 % ) more wealthy than russian atm - and indian population is one of the poorest nations in the world . 
   people of those regions never wanted to be part of georgia plz stop bulshitting public . 
  abkhazians were a minority in abkhazia : 95k out of 525k . 
  majority were georgians ( 232k ) and i bet they all preferred to stay in georgia rather than starting a war with participation of rufed - that is why * rufed had to import thousands chechens to start full-scale war * - including those who had started a war against rufed itself just a year later and became infamous terrorists ( i 've met [ basaev ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shamil_basayev ) in gudauta ) . 
  i 'll never return to abkhazia while it belong to rufed - because it 's lawless enclave like eritrea unlike * the rest of georgia * . 
   everybody in that region are russian military short answer is `` yes '' . 
  most people left long before august , 2008 . 
  in july , 2008 those 20-30k remaining have [ attempted to overthrow puppet government installed by the kremlin ] ( http://www.russ.ru/pole/pravil-nye-osetiny-protiv-musora-shajki-kokojty ) - to the point where * rufed had to send military planes to patrol tskhinvali region * ( [ news ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2008/07/12/threat/ ) ) to demonstrate - what exactly may happen if ossetians will try to remove their `` president '' kokoity ? 
  basically in august , 2008 rufed has simply removed the handful of remaining locals - including georgians - from the region to keep it under control . 
  edit : words . 
  apologies - incorrect wording : `` nothing can grow '' . 
  of course there is a lot happening - as someone precisely described whole russian history as `` and then it got worse '' . 
  btw - congratulations on your new patriotic opportunity to join army and die fighting against isis , kurds , syrian opposition , alqueda for assad and kremlin oligarchs . 
  swamp as in `` dead space with nothing happening '' .
