  also it 's [ forest mostly ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geography_of_russia#ecoregions ) . 
  and [ swamps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasyugan_swamp ) . 
  so does rufed . 
  couple days ago allianz has published a [ rating of liquid assets ] ( https://www.allianz.com/v_1443445123000/media/economic_research/publications/specials/en/agwr2015en.pdf ) among population ( i 've understood it as `` available money '' ) : country is in the very bottom of the list , `` average russian '' has 13 % less money than `` average ukrainian '' - 800 euro . 
  because it 's one-way relations - kremlin pump money into the country , in exchange belarus simply does n't run away ( for now ) and it 's obvious they are ready to do so if there will be suitable situation . 
  like they 've restored border control between the countries in just 2 weeks when kremlin attempted to stop `` official contraband '' of embargoed food from belarus . 
  that does n't really look like an alliance . 
  i 'd say ukraine if this thread happened couple years ago ... 
  what about [ frigate ] ( https://fri-gate.org/ ) ? 
  it takes just few clicks to add to browser and work like a charm ( here at least ) for all your por ... democratic needs . 
   how else government pays for anything ? 
  mostly by selling oil and other natural resources to europe in this case . 
  oil prices dropped = nearly 4 % gdp deficit this year . 
   russian soldiers who were officially on leave and not supported by the russian government their actions are exactly the opposite to their pr garbage : those soldiers got [ 4300 combat medals officially ] ( https://www.bellingcat.comt/news/uk-and-europe/2016/08/31/russias-war-ukraine-medals-treacherous-numbers/ ) for their `` leave '' in ukraine . 
   trust to pollster correct . 
  if random heck will ask my opinion - i 'll just answer `` hail putin '' to be safe . 
  you never know if they are going to rebuild gulags in this or next decade ? 
  `` funny '' part : i 've seen a vacancy text with `` actual freedom of speech in the office '' option in the benefits list . 
  human rights became a luxury in this country . 
  tbh placing [ 40-400km range weapon systems ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s-400_ ( missile \\ ) ) along border does n't look like a defensive action . 
  right . 
  people say `` i have my own common sense '' as if they got it from a revelation or decades of research - and not from a societies which have up to 99 % believers . 
  when the government ban a news site then ( almost ) nobody care and move on . 
  when the government ban porn site then everyone start using [ frigate ] ( https://fri-gate.org/ ) ( which takes just couple clicks to install and use ) , vpns , tor , proxies etc. 
  with porn prohibition they are practically promote internet freedom . 
  my humor-o-meter is broken by your post - you really should add either / s or / nazi tag in case if that 's not a humor . 
  to `` anti-corruption '' unit in another executive branch - fsb - which is trying to impose * $ 150 billions * ( [ 10 trillions roubles ] ( https://lenta.ru/news/2016/08/10/comp/ ) ) `` anti-terrorist '' project / tax onto the country since free euro-money for expensive oil is n't an option anymore . 
  this sum is comparable to whole government 's annual budget ( 15 trillions ) . 
  thanks for the link !, 
  it make me wonder - how could slavic name appear in persia couple hundreds years before slavs appeared in the north ? 
  saint of what religion ? 
  i 'm not sure if `` vadim '' is possible name for a christian at all since baptism procedure makes sure the name is from `` approved '' list . 
  also vadim - it 's somewhat important since its unique `` bad '' connotation ( ~ sinister ) unlike usual `` positive '' names . 
  oil embargo may change that instantly . 
  you 've forgot about practice of self-coups in russian federation : ussr turns into rufed in 1991 , in 1993 yeltsin disband parliament . 
  i bet we have 100 % chance to see something like that again . 
   and the russian population will be satisfied again . 
  population is losing patience : rating of ruling party is dropping below 30 % just two weeks prior to elections . 
  in this situation army , fsb , national and regional elites may get out of control without oil money rain which they 've got during last 10 years . 
  there are already some strange - if not staged - legal processes against putin 's regional emissaries ( governors ) and `` pocket oligarchs '' which apparently represent shifts of power . 
  actually you were absolutely right - the person [ was banned ] ( http://m.bbc.com/sport/disability-sport/37310337 ) . 
  it 's known for 3.5 k years and called '' [ cassandra complex ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=cassandra+comple&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b#q=cassandra+complex ) '' : people do n't like obvious/precise predictions if they are n't pleasing . 
  yeltsin-style economic collapse . 
  it was n't critical for yeltsin who was n't rich personally - but for present government officials ( who `` earned '' billions ) loss of western oil money supply may be literally deadly . 
  probably that 's why west did n't use oil embargo : nobody want to deal with an anarchy . 
  you should check [ this article ] ( http://www.vz.ru/news/2016/9/6/830861.html ) . 
  one of the funds has lost 1/5 in august and will be depleted in march . 
  another one lost 10 % due to exchange rates ( they keep it in foreign currency and it has lost its rouble value ) and 1/3 is invested into projects with 10 + years roi terms - it 's half-empty already . 
  2018 is actually optimistic forecast - if economy wo n't sink further in 2017, 
  censor.net.ua is censored ( forbidden and blocked ) in russian federation ... 
  i wish someone made kremlin accountable for thousands people killed and millions became refugees in ukraine , georgia , moldova - all under pretension of `` ethnic '' `` local '' wars ( rather than russian invasions ) . 
  that would force the government to take care of couple millions refugees ( and thus think twice before starting new wars ) rather than just disregarding them as unwanted nuisance and asking to go back into devastated regions . 
  it did n't mess up my sense of identity because i was n't attached to any state in the first place : i grew up as a part of russian diaspora in abkhzania/georgia till the war started . 
  where `` diaspora '' mean just `` a bunch of non-locals '' since russians do n't form any type of relations as a community - or at least i did n't see anything remotely resembling russian community based on ethnicity . 
  except for neo-nazi groups and a religious group in south america maybe . 
  edit : yes , de-facto i live as an illegal alien after 1992 . 
  in the country where i was born and where my parents got their citizenship . 
  i know an ethnic russian family from kazakhstan living couple blocks away - they spent 10 + years getting their citizenships after ussr fall - and could n't do that till they 've purchased a real estate . 
  typical `` russian '' federation . 
  thanks for your advice !, 
  currently i see no point in the process since i already got georgian citizenship which is enough for international travels - especially after visa-free mode with eu couple weeks later . 
  as for living without proper documents in russia - it never was a problem so far . 
  up to the point where i could board planes without documents or with a copy of `` not a citizen '' `` document '' . 
  well , 15 years was n't enough even to break through initial barriers let alone finish it - all i could get was a pack of papers saying `` not a citizen '' . 
  i guess whole process in my case could last longer than my life span . 
  with the georgian citizenship whole procedure took just few weeks from the first try - and i 've never been in the country ( except for abkhazia ) and was n't born there . 
  thank you very much !, 
  i gave up on the idea ~ 10 years ago . 
  did n't want to break the law ( which actually may work when there is possible punitive outcome ) and spend $ 2-5k on a piece of paper which does not provide any real benefits . 
  yes , it 's actually that bad . 
  bureacracy use any ( un ) imaginable reason to deny citizenship to people born in ussr - * including ethnic russians * . 
  after 15 years in rufed i had to acquire * georgian * citizenship * in moscow * - even though both my parents are citizens of rufed and i was born on its territory and by law i should become a citizen automatically no matter of other possible citizenship i could have . 
  edit : alternatively it 's possible to bribe officials for $ 2-5k and get citizenship in couple months . 
  or undergo 2-5 years long procedure if you have a perfect set of papers ( my family did n't have it since there is actual war zone in the region from which we fled ) . 
  not really . 
  whole families of ussr citizens fled from - stans in 90s were denied rufed 's citizenship for decades - including my own . 
  my grandmother died in stateless status after 21 years in rufed despite multiple attempts to legalize her . 
  the most ridiculous part : she was ethnic russian , born on the territory of rsfsr thus eligible for citizenship by the laws and common sense - which never work in rufed . 
  edit : added `` common sense '', 
  you are looking in the wrong direction . 
  there are 2 funds used to accumulate currency from expensive oil sales which the government used to stabilize economy during 2014-16 - `` reserve fund '' and `` national prosperity fund '' . 
  government use them to cover $ 50-60b of their expenses - nearly 1/3 of total cost of the state . 
  as result reserve fund lost 75 % , `` prosperity fund '' 17 % in 2016 . 
  if oil price wo n't go up to $ 70 + then reserve fund will be fully depleted during q1 2017 , prosperity fund ( ~ $ 70b ) will last about 3-4 quarters since it has substantial part of it ( 1/3 ) already spent ( `` invested '' ) into long-term projects . 
  here is the [ article with numbers ] ( https://lenta.ru/news/2017/01/10/reservefund/ ) . 
  sanctions seems pointless but accompanied by petrochemical prices drop they 've nearly destroyed consumer market ( car sales , salaries , real estate prices collapsed by 50 % in 2 years to the levels of 2006/7 ) and almost annihilated government 's currency reserves . 
  should wait a year and see what will happen when kremlin will deplete the last reserves somewhere in august-november . 
  i bet the government will be much more cooperative when it will be asked to pay salaries of police and fsb from their own pockets . 
  interesting . 
  it look like i have a salary comparable to decent france/uk/germany salaries - despite mediocre absolute number . 
  however $ 100:250 e ratio also makes local rent prices look even more inadequate : * cheapest * single room apartment in moscow cost 900 euro ppp . 
  it was a big surprise to me - salaries in barcelona are exactly twice lower than in france/germany/amsterdam for the same job ( 20-30k vs 45-60k ) . 
  i 've expected to see 25-50k range ( similar to czechia ) . 
  60k combined with 20k tax , 12k apartment rent , 2-3k health insurance , 6k food cost , etc. 
  - it 's almost the same as my 36k ( pre-tax , sans apartment rent ) in moscow . 
  not to mention how i can get 60-70k pre-tax in moscow as well ( couple years later , as senior developer ) . 
   but it 's in third world countries . 
  correct , but people do n't feel the difference till they actually move . 
  note : as i understand taxes are practically the same everywhere ( 30-40 % ) but in some countries ( like russia ) employ ~ ~ ees ~ ~ ers pay them for people so some locals do n't even understand they pay eu-level taxes for african-level government services . 
  edit : employers , not employees .
