  no matter what they say in the process it 's the same ol' good georgian scenario with `` independent states '' and `` russian peacekeepers '' in the end . 
  the only regions which did n't show signs of separatism are central russia and ural . 
  there were few participants in august `` federalization '' events . 
  most were arrested and jailed for reasons like `` storing drugs '' . 
  it seems people still do n't understand there is no way to change anything legally without serious foreign support . 
  those are just minor episodes compared to real clashes happened during forming of other countries ( ussr , us , france , modern germany , ex-yugoslavia ) . 
  i 'm sure fall of rufed will be more peaceful than conflict in `` donbabwe '' . 
  i heard about separatist activity literally in every region except for central russia and ural . 
  people are being jailed and killed almost everywhere - from konigsberg to vladivostok . 
  southern russia was relatively calm ( still they all remember communist `` ethnic cleansing '' against cossacks ) - but kremlin itself is giving them ideas about `` novorossia '' . 
  tensions in caucasus regions have started in early 80s , long before fall of ussr . 
  in 91 chechnya was already cleansed of its russian population ( it was almost 50 % in grozny ) . 
  also it seems war between kremlin and chechnya has started due to relations between yeltsin and chechen disapora - he promised them something ( independence or maybe shared control over rufed ) for his support during imitation of coup-d-etas in 91 and then betrayed afaik . 
  outside of failing `` mlticultural '' regions there were zero clashes . 
  just like it will be during fall of rufed . 
  it look like they just do n't have a goal to save people , they have a goal to kill as few as possible . 
  [ theatre on dubrovka ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_theater_hostage_crisis ) is a good example of their work - they 've killed 40 terrorists and 133 hostages died in the process . 
  gas was used in [ theater ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_theater_hostage_crisis ) . 
  in that operation spetsnaz has killed 40 terrorists and 133 hostages ( out of 850 ) . 
  it did n't work for ukraine because us and eu allowed `` mini-ussr '' to invade neighbor countries ( georgia and moldova ) multiple times during 20 + years till government of rufed became absolutely sure they have cart-blanch to do anything on ex-ussr territory ( and probably beyond it too ) . 
  reaction which we see today should have happened 22 years ago when rufed invaded georgia using exactly the same tactics as today in eastern ukraine so ukraine could be absolutely safe today . 
  \\* i guess present situation will become classic for history books with title like `` why you should n't wait 20 years to react on invasion '', 
  what clashes did you see in russian federation during ussr fall ? 
  thank you very much !, 
  i 've forgot about jeep , pampers , jacuzzi - probably because i do n't use them that often . 
  unitaz , kedi are news to me . 
  plastir and scotch are n't exactly brand names - more like slang ( patented in the case of `` scotch '' ) . 
  no , i just do n't see the need to comment in sub-reddit dedicated to a state/country which is n't too interesting to me and most likely will disappear soon . 
  i believe right now is exactly the best moment to do this because due to concentration of power in russian federation its centralized around just few figures - if they go bankrupt whole structure will fall like house of cards . 
  and there wo n't be too much wars because existing governmental structures in different regions of rufed already act like semi-independent states - thus the need for internal passports , visas , seemingly excessive amount of bureaucracy . 
  morale is not an instinct - there is a basement for it . 
  and it 's not science which is just couple hundreds years old and was n't wide spread till mid-xx century - while basement of modern civilization ( and morale ) is ~ 1000 years old . 
  to see how communism has changed morale check ex-communist countries . 
  thievery , bribery , corruption is a norm there because `` profitable '' has replaced `` good '' . 
  recently people in 3 cities went into jail for this idea so it 's alive and semi-well . 
  with one `` but '' : china may want a piece of that territory and `` sr '' will need nuclear weapons to defend themselves . 
  i read it as `` please , continue buying our oil and gas so we could continue to terrorize our neighbors and population . '', 
  a lot of smaller states instead of empire which will fall apart anyway and harm a lot of other countries in the process if it will have enough time . 
  it 's not luck , it 's bad habit to form and expand empires instead of creating a country . 
  out of many countries formed from ussr only one has nuclear weapons right now and it 's much less dangerous than ussr was 30 + years ago . 
  smaller state = less aggressive and less dangerous . 
  at least there was christianity , not the `` best '' / modern kind but nonetheless it had morale basics . 
  russia wo n't turn into north korea - koreans are homogenous nation while russian federation is an empire with multiple `` mini-nations '' which are ready to depart any moment . 
  even russian regions are developing separatism movements lately . 
  bankruptcy of kremlin will result in formation of 10-20 smaller states which will be much easier to deal with . 
  or at least this development of situation should be the target for those who do n't want to see giant aggressive state with thermonuclear weapons and ~ 5000 tanks right at the eu border . 
  communism has destroyed ability of people for critical thinking , 95 % of population does n't know english , their only source of information are russian tv and sites which are flooded with propaganda and lies . 
  plus there is absolutely no morale - people do n't operate with terms like `` evil '' or `` good '' but `` profitable '' and `` detrimental '' instead , so if anything is n't detrimental to the person ( like lies of government about dead russian soldiers ) then it 's ok and can be ignored . 
  i just do n't watch tv , know english , can see evil and do n't tolerate it . 
  changing putin to another figure within the same state wo n't help - abkhazia , moldavia , ossetia were attacked before putin . 
  apparently russians have failed to create modern non-aggressive state on this territory and will continue to terrorize neighbors again and again . 
  for me solution is obvious , everyone else is just hesitating to speak it loudly because it 's dangerous and will require some effort . 
  there is no need for invasion . 
  europe / germany partnership with less inadequate governments and resulting switch to more reliable sources of gas and oil will be enough for kremlin to go bankrupt in couple years instead of terrorizing russia and whole ex-ussr region for decades having finances from europe . 
  xerox = every copying/printing device . 
   washington and bruxelles it 's really nice to see there are governments which does n't want to harm us - unlike our own . 
  however there is no point in caring about population of rufed at the cost of slower sanctions since kremlin is apparently goes for neo-stalinist / fascist state and population will be harmed much more severely if this state wo n't be stopped asap . 
  putin & co already created self-inflicted food embargo , in the next month they are going to forbid import of drugs . 
  and , for example , almost 100 % of insulin in the country is imported . 
  approximately the same amount as before . 
  these are prices from cian.ru . 
  these are n't lowest prices ( i 've skipped listings which are far from subway stations ) - and i 've expected ~ 30 % higher numbers . 
  [ here ] ( http://health.mail.ru/news/minpromtorg_zapretit_goszakupki_inostrannyh/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;social=fb ) . 
  it 's not crappy when government is turning country into another north korea and is preparing for bigger wars . 
  correct . 
  source of this information is just a facebook post however i 'm inclined to believe it having my own experience with rufed 's army : my family ( ethnic russians ) was killed with support and `` green light '' of russian federation in abkhazia ( total ~ 80k russians were either killed or expelled ) . 
  it seems some of ukrainian military groups which tried to escape had captured russian soldiers with them - and they were killed by russian troops along with ukrainians . 
  in the best traditions of stalinism . 
  here is how i see this situation , wall of text incoming : it seems like putin know what he is doing and act within his usual agenda ( to restore ussr ) - but apparently there is no hope to restore ussr already ( country is stagnating and state may start to fall apart during next financial crisis ) and putin is simply trapped : most likely he accumulated billions ( unknown seller has sold us treasuries for $ 70b in february ) in illegally `` earned '' assets which were unexpectedly returned into the country due to risk of losing them to eu/us sanctions . 
  he is extremely high value target right now - for his own environment in the first place . 
  if situation will start to develop into wrong direction he will be dead and his billions will be shared . 
  the only way for him to stay alive without losing money is to create dictatorship with military discipline while maintaining popularity among lower ranks of bureaucrats ( for protection from high-ranking bureaucrats ) . 
  in the process he has to act `` brave '' - i.e. 
  achieve all goals population expect from him - despite them being absolutely destructive for the country and the state itself . 
  so as a result we see mr. putin is turning the country into bigger and much more dangerous version of north korea ( north korea at least has an ideology and can be controlled by china - unlike russian federation ) and sending troops into ukraine openly ( loss of ukraine may result in massive wave o separatism within rufed and in putin 's funerals ) . 
  at least most of them did n't manufacture fake import/export permissions for bribes like putin ( most likely ) did in 90s in sanct petersburg . 
  or financed [ palace ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/putin%27s_palace ) building using laundered money . 
  i 'm not aware of details of pharmaceutical market but when couple days ago i 've asked my family to check what percentage of their drugs is imported ? 
  - result was 100 % . 
  afaik pharmaceutical industry in russian federation manufactures very limited set of drugs because it was possible to import cheap drugs from india and hi-tech/modern drugs from eu , japan , us , israel . 
  iirc nearly 100 % of insulin is imported . 
  total embargo will be a disaster - couple of my family members may simply die if they will stay in the country . 
  correct . 
  this state consist of people with mentality of bandits . 
  and for me it does look very strange how leaders of european countries did n't treat them as such but instead made themselves heavily dependent on oil and gas controlled by a gang of unreliable thugs with criminal motivation , habits - and nuclear weapons . 
  correct , `` foreign '' sanctions were targeted against elite and for population they look more like a joke - if not an invitation to take over whole ussr territory ( rouble exchange rate did n't drop yet , at least not substantially enough ) . 
  however if kremlin will implement foreign drugs embargo ( in mid-october ? ), 
  then effect will be much more dramatic - people will simply start to die immediately . 
  from 800 euro ( ~ 10-20km from kremlin ) to 1k ( 5-7km ) and up . 
  certain types of food have started to disappear ( i do n't have selection of stuffed olives anymore ) , prices are growing slowly , there is some empty space on displays ( merchandisers simply use a lot of `` kremlin-compatible '' products to cover `` holes '' ) . 
  it will be much more obvious in couple weeks because there is a lot of european products still ( ~ 1/4 of meat , 1/2 or more dairy , lot of fish , half of conserved vegetables ) . 
  but it 's hardly result of eu activity - food embargo is self-inflicted . 
  financial sanctions are much less noticeable . 
  they look like independent company - perhaps that is why they attempt to investigate facts instead of using fsb and police versions like most ( if not all ) other tv channels do . 
   i 'm suppose to read that as `` killed and wounded in ukraine '' , right ? 
  correct . 
  about another question - it 's poor choice of words , i 've re-phrased sentence . 
  senator was trying to investigate situation and was beaten - most likely by the same thugs ( soldiers ? ), 
  who attacked journalists . 
  governments of certain european countries who recently started to look like `` friends '' of kremlin should check eastern ukraine , south ossetia , abkhazia , transistria for examples - what happened with regions which did not actively opposed kremlin 's ideas ?
