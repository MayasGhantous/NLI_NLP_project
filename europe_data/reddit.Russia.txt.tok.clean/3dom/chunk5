  besides many russian companies who used europe for offshore activity are simply in the process of severe degradation or shut down - like yandex ( its founder and owner left ceo position few days ago ) . 
  - stans are already joining eurasian union voluntarily , kyrgyzstan will be accepted by the end of this year . 
  here is the [ scheme of conflict for august , 26-27 ] ( http://imgur.com/dwj2ikj ) . 
  huge fight in the south . 
  edit : i 've checked on map , distance from donetsk to mariupol is ~ 95 kilometers - and this giant front is filled with russian troops , imagine their amount . 
  russian federation : 143m . 
  stavropol region : 2.7 m people ( 2 % ) , it seems there are 400 dead and wounded in the region . 
  amount of dead and wounded in rufed = 400 * 143/2 .7 = ... 
  resulting number is `` a bit '' too high and probably it is wrong . 
  but even if it 's 4-5 times lower than simple logic dictates - it 's huge anyway for a single month or two + it show there are thousands of russian troops fighting in ukraine for month ( s ) . 
  these 400 dead and wounded soldiers were recruited in single stavropol region of rufed . 
  total number of dead and wounded for whole russian federation must be in thousands - and not every russian soldier on ukrainian territory was killed and wounded so their number is really more like [ 3 brigades ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/24/08/2014/944616.shtml#xtor=al-%5binternal_traffic%5d--%5brbc.ru%5d-%5bmain_body%5d-%5bitem_3%5d ) ( 10-15 thousands ) announced by leaders of `` rebels '' during this weekend . 
  you are correct - dying for worthless dictators in meaningless wars is russians ' specialty however i hope that imminent scandal around thousands of dead and wounded russian soldiers will demonstrate the scale of the invasion to the world so eu , us , nato will start to help ukraine with something more tangible . 
  and at the same time society in rufed can not hide it anymore : officials claim there is unofficial ( yet ) list of [ ~ 400 dead and wounded soldiers from north caucasus region only ] ( http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2ftop.rbc.ru%2fsociety%2f27%2f08%2f2014%2f945483.shtml%23xtor%3dal-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[item_1] ) . 
  total amount for whole rufed must be in thousands . 
  so far only 9 dagestani families were brave enough to ask for investigation about their relatives who died in `` rostov region '' ( and were fired + stripped of benefits ) - and dagestan is small territory ( 2 % of rufed 's population ) populated by ethnic minorities ( so hey care about each other ) . 
  i imagine count of dead ethnic russian soldiers is approximately 40 times higher ( i.e. 
  more than 350 ) and i guess hundreds families are being under pressure by authorities to lie about their sons , husbands , fathers . 
  there are rumors how there were [ multiple `` secret '' funerals in pskov after ukrainian army declared they are captured apc from pskov airborne division ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/incidents/25/08/2014/944935.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[item_1] ) . 
  other rumors says dead bodies are not being given to families who speak with journalists + there are [ miraculous resurrections ] ( https://www.facebook.com/avorobey/posts/10152386708534624 ) when families suddenly stop mourning and declare photos of fresh graves are fake . 
  edit : more bad news : it was predicted - for example here : '' [ what happened during this week ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ef8r9/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_24082014/cjz15q4 ) '' - that rufed will use aviation in the conflict - now [ ukrainians report two mi-24 attack helicopters ] ( http://www.rnbo.gov.ua/news/1791.html ) . 
  edit 2 : now there are articles how [ dead soldiers of rufed 's army are being fired retroactively and their families do not receive any benefits ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/26/08/2014/945059.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[item_4] ) + it seems there is severe pressure on families to lie about causes of deaths ( links above ) . 
  i 'm just preparing to use `` russia '' for another country . 
  i think users from uk/us/au will be frustrated since they ( have ) nothing to contribute . 
  ingen has lost its founder =( r.i.p. , baron attenborough of richmond upon thames . 
  i feel like i can read italian . 
  considering how much time some of us are spending on reddit i think that some of users could start talking in dozen new languages in a year or two . 
  i could n't imagine that structure of french sentences will be more comprehensible to me if they are translated into english rather than russian . 
  apparently fr/en structure has more similarities than fr/ru - even though i still see common words ( for example , fa\u00e7on ) . 
  it 's interesting to watch the start of new custom . 
  also it 's interesting how i have to adapt my native language for better translation . 
  i wish everyone typed like you , in 2 languages . 
  it could be extremely easy to learn new languages on reddit . 
  perhaps it can become a standard in / r/europe . 
  i hope i 'm wrong and this episode does n't mean anything serious . 
  but with kremlin confirmation bias does n't work - they like to make nearly worst possible decisions and i would n't be surprised if couple years later they 'll start to threat neighbors with nuclear bombs and missiles on fully loaded strategic bombers . 
  p. s. rufed military plane has entered space of finland just 1 week later after visit of finnish president to russia . 
   russia is vary of attacking finland still [ russian military plane has entered finnish space ] ( http://www.defmin.fi/?9_m=5943&amp;s=8 ) yesterday . 
  from rufed 's european neighbors only finland does not have official nato protection afaik . 
  bunch of people in 3 different cities willingly sacrificing their careers and freedom - for me it does look like there is some demand from society . 
  not to mention rufed citizens in caucasus region who are being shot by fsb without court trials almost daily . 
  after slogans `` stop feeding moscow ! '', 
  government has ceased building of stadium ( world cup 18 ) in kaliningrad / konigsberg . 
  official reason is `` too expensive '' - as if the price matters when they are going to steal most of the money or other stadiums cost much less or 50b winter olympics were n't expensive . 
  logic behind actions of state in rufed is inverted because it is formed by criminals ( for example in 90s there were attempts to start investigation against putin for corruption - accusation was bribery for faking import/export permissions ) . 
  a person which killed 16 people is getting 6 years term with a right for probation after 3 years , peaceful protesters are being jailed for 2-5 years for standing in the middle of street with a piece of paper in their hands - same for a [ businessmen who go bankrupt and are being accused of fraud ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/incidents/24/08/2014/944624.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[item_1] ) . 
  maximum security prisons are the least dangerous for inmates . 
  and no - the girl was sent into less secure prison afaik . 
  taxi driver was recidivist criminal and criminal state defended him ( posthumously ) and punished his victim . 
  i would n't expect from rufed and its puppets to follow any laws . 
  this state is built by criminals , it has criminal culture and ( apparently ) desire to become `` more famous '' war/international criminals . 
  if a state was built by criminals for criminals it 's logical for such state to defend criminals from society .

  i remember couple months ago they said they can not gather even 1 thousand of local volunteers ( and - unlike today - they were kind of winning side at that moment ) - i guess their present declaration means rufed is sending 3 fully equipped military brigades ( that 's 10-15 thousands soldiers with artillery , tanks , apcs , etc. ),

  couple weeks ago i 've published news how truck driver got 6 years for 18 people he killed ( +40 were injured ) . 
  what 's the difference ? 
  girls is citizen of rufed , truck driver is from armenia and armenian state actively participated in the process while there is no state which could defend russians against rufed . 
  all 3 `` judges '' were female and they have declared rape is n't dangerous enough for a person to defend her ( him ) self . 
  apparently in rufed people do not have a right for self-defense - self-defense is more dangerous for society than killing 18 people with a truck . 
  \\* note : next thing i expect to see in ukrainian conflict are fighter jets piloted by `` concerned citizens '' and explanation how rebels have captured them and quickly figured out how to use military airplanes . 
  just like [ it happened in georgia 20 years ago ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csnlc0ikk7y&amp;feature=player_embedded ) . 
  it seems 20 years was n't enough for kremlin to prepare different scenario . 
   considered being friendlier to neighboring countries . 
  `` rufed is ex-ussr so ex-ussr territories are rightfully ours '' , `` ukrainians are n't a nation , they are confused russians '' , `` everything russian belongs to rufed '' are very common opinions here - apparently putin also believe ( d ) into something like that . 
   see no problem with it . 
  us is n't trying to expand their territory by invading canada and mexico - even though they could use `` protection of englishmen '' `` reason '' for canadian campaign . 
  i know . 
  16 + episodes during 7 weeks . 
  apparently they have huge expenses + on inner market gazprom sells gas for fraction of its `` european '' price to cut off possibility of domestic competition and maintain its monopoly . 
  it look like money making is only a byproduct of their primary activity - politics . 
  it seems confirmation bias never work when it comes to kremlin - their decisions are in the worst part of possibilities spectrum .
