  besides north korea i can not imagine any other country banning import of food - and north korea threatening with its nuclear weapons almost daily so i would n't be surprised if kremlin will start to do the same . 
  false dmitry did n't change anything , no heritage left after him so there are not much emotions around his name . 
   aug 21 , 2014 it happened yesterday . 
  similar incident near japan . 
  note : these airplanes were [ designed to bear nuclear weapons ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tupolev_tu-95 ) . 
  i believe you misunderstood situation : gazprom has stopped delivery of gaz in may and it turned out company is not profitable without ukraine as a client . 
  i have to apologize - gazprom did not lost 80 % of profit , in q2 it [ lost whole profit and 7.5 b rubles ~ 200m euros on top of that ] ( http://www.rosbalt.ru/business/2014/08/13/1303453.html ) ( compared to 57b rubles / 1.5 b euros profit a year ago ) . 
  i see wrong usage of quotes : instead of `` invades ukraine '' they should be used on `` aid '' term . 
  few days ago gazprom and [ vneshtorgbank ] ( http://www.banki.ru/news/lenta/?id=7021152 ) have published financial results of q2 . 
  without ukraine and its money they lost 75-80 % of profitability . 
  there is metric ton of articles about possible jewish roots of malusha and vladimir in google - [ this one for example ] ( http://poiskpravdy.com/otkuda-est-poshel-knyaz-vladimir-i-kto-ego-nadoumil-rus-krestit/ ) . 
  or [ this ] ( http://freakopedia.ru/wiki/%d0%9c%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%83%d1%88%d0%b0_%e2%80%94_%d0%b5%d0%b2%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b9%d0%ba%d0%b0 ) . 
  by the way there was a nation on the territory of modern russia - [ khazars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khazars ) - who have converted to judaism in viii century . 
  there is not a single statement with `` jewish '' word in it . 
  probably because orthodox church can sue people and organizations for blasphemy . 
  russian language use `` familiarized '' forms of `` formal '' names . 
  `` formal names '' are used to communicate with people whom you barely know or want to express your respect - or exactly the opposite ( to show you are not happy with their behavior if a person is familiar ) . 
  when a person is familiar or loved then `` familiarized '' form is used . 
  for common jewish name malka familiarized form is malusha ( in fact `` malka '' sounds rude in russian ) - which is the name of vladimir 's mother . 
  neither `` malka '' nor `` malusha '' are n't russian/slavic names and afaik from thousand + years of history of russia `` malusha '' appears only once - as the name of vladimir 's mother . 
  edit : there are no historical documents which states `` vladimir and/or his mother was jewish '' . 
  if i was vladimir or his descendant i 'd destroy such documents to not to compromise myself as pureblood russian ruler - and i would n't be surprised if someone did exactly this . 
  however if today i 'll meet a woman with name malka or malusha i do n't need historical documents to assume she is jewish ( until proven otherwise ) . 
  what particular part are you interesting in ? 
  about malusha as a `` slavic '' form of malka ( other examples : maria =  masha , natalia =  natasha , pavel =  pavlusha , aleksei =  alesha ) - or malka as jewish name ? 
  edit : here is [ an article ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9c%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%83%d1%88%d0%b0 ) about her in russian wikipedia . 
   mother : malusha malusha = form of malka , common jewish name which mean `` queen '' in hebrew . 
  a lot of people do not believe in kgb 's revolt in 1991 ( conspirators were scared shitless and did n't look like conspirators at all - more like hostages who were forced to play the role ) so there is conspiracy theory : he voluntarily gave up ussr to politburo / yeltsin 's gang for them to privatize the country while west could declare they 've won cold war . 
  it 's all very controversial . 
  [ vladimir * the great ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_the_great ) baptized kievan rus , but used it to usurp power and to kill his political opponents in the process + it seems he was jewish ( his mother 's name was malka , she was n't `` royalty '' ) so there is some antisemitism around his name . 
  some people does not like figure of genghis khan : he killed almost half of population but mongols can be considered creators of russian state . 
  [ alexander nevski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_nevsky ) has rejected offer of western states to remove tatars and adopt catholicism but in return tatars turned his dynasty into rulers of newly created russian state + orthodox church declared him a saint . 
  [ ivan the terrible ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivan_the_terrible ) conquered lots of territories but after his rule country fell apart and there was a century of anarchy . 
  [ nikolas ii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicholas_ii_of_russia ) is a saint but lost russian empire . 
  \\* vladimir the great `` technically '' was born on the territory of modern ukraine ( moscow appeared 250 + years later ) . 
  so even his link to rufed can be questionable to some people . 
  must be either * lenin * ( for destroying russian empire and following century of chaos ) or * yeltsin * / * gorbachev * ( for destroying ussr and following decades of chaos ) . 
  compared to these other historical personalities are n't exactly hated - history of rufed is too controversial ( for example tataro-mongols have created/united russian provinces into state - but killed nearly 50 % of population in the process ) . 
  ( stalin can not be considered native to russian federation , he was born on territory of modern georgia ), 
  guys in kremlin are destroying rufed more effectively than any external enemy could . 
  perhaps we should be grateful to them for their hard work ... 
  it 's not `` my '' country - my ethnic roots and location does not make rufed `` my country '' automatically . 
  also from what i 've seen i doubt it can/should be called `` a country '' at all : after annexation of crimea it does n't even operate within internationally recognized borders . 
  what flag would you suggest for ethnic russian living in rufed ? 
  that 's ok , almost nobody has used the roofs anyway . 
  i 'm `` afraid '' dear leader will remove migrants from the country so muscovites will have to work as low wage workers themselves ( it may actually kill the economy because ~ 10 millions foreign migrants are ~ 20 % of work force ) . 
  now i wonder - what sanctions against population of russia will be implemented by dear leader to punish us for this heinous crime against his state ? 
  lenin mausoleum : +500 % glorious leaders ' birth rate in the world ; -2 golds , food , production per turn per square ; negative population growth rate for 100 years ; +80 % happiness ; inability to adopt free trade / capitalism , liberalism , free speech , democracy civics ; +1 free rocket scientist in each city ; double speed of production of military units ; 50 % more food production with serfdom . 
  levada is n't too reliable . 
  often i hear jokes about them like `` it could be nice if their interviewers have started to ask opinions of people * outside * of kremlin walls '' . 
  also `` 80 % approval rating '' in reality means `` 20 % openly disagree , others are n't sure or agree '' - among people i know nobody think `` ukrainian adventure '' will have positive effect for the country but exactly the opposite and most think putin has made huge mistake thinking georgian-moldovan `` peacekeeping invasion '' scenario could work in a country with 45m population . 
  it seems there are separatists in konigsberg / kaliningrad also - which is surrounded by nato countries . 
  not to mention suppressed civil war ( s ) on caucasus + freshly acquired crimea with 200k very unhappy tatars and almost million of ethnic ukrainians + tatarstan itself is somewhat volatile . 
  iraq ? 
  you mean russian federation is n't superpower equal to us - but aggressive authoritarian second world state with ( real ) weapons of mass destruction ? 
  `` see what us did [ so we are allowed to do the same or worse ] '' is a common argument of kremlin supporters . 
  constitution is inherited from ussr - which fell apart . 
  apparently `` multinational nation '' part does n't work - fsb have to kill people daily on caucasus and government pay billions to chechnya every year just to keep rufed in a single piece . 
  interesting information . 
  thanks !, 
  however i 'm not surprised - russia is n't exactly the place where the most disciplined people live . 
  also there is not much respect for the government . 
  like once i was in a police station and said something like `` but putin issued the law '' and got reply `` we do n't care what putin does , we have instructions '' . 
  correct , there is no single nation within rufed . 
  lately even russians do n't want to be in the same state with other russians within rufed - and they demand separate set of laws ( `` federalization '' events in siberia and kaliningrad ) . 
   country-invading nation . 
  while i 'm agree in vodka part ( what happened with your bear ? ), 
  it 's difficult not to use `` country-invading nation '' term for a country which is involved into 4 + military conflicts during just 23 years since its creation ( georgia , moldova , ukraine , civil wars in caucasus region ) . 
  add kiev maybe ? 
  and minsk . 
  russian government use monopoly on tv , newspapers , radio to manipulate public opinion as they please . 
  public is too weak to resist and eat everything this government has to offer including obviously destructive actions which are against everyone 's interests in the long run - like training chechens to fight against georgians in abkhazia just for the very same chechens to become `` freedom fighters '' and kill thousands rufed soldiers few months later . 
  or starting 3 wars in neighbor countries to prevent them from joining more developed nato and eu . 
  or pursuing idea of `` pax ~ ~ communist ~ ~ plutocratic russia '' instead of joining/enjoying `` pax americana '' . 
  russian government was n't democratically elected and does not rely on population in anything so their policies does not reflect interests and opinions of the population . 
  in fact government mostly ignores interests of population . 
  with dashcams . 
  reddit 's opinion about russia heavily depend on amount of newly opened pro-russian accounts and rt propaganda consumed by visitors of / r/worldnews, 
  apparently chess is an extreme sport . 
  ** russia ** , it seems western sanctions have started to work . 
  at least that part which allowed `` rosneft '' to demand $ 45b bailout .

  edit : i 've forgot to mention - [ there is 3000 + cars / 40 + hours long traffic jam near ferry between crimea and mainland russia ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/photoreport/15/08/2014/943168.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[item_14] ) . 
  it has increased from 1500 + cars ~ 1 month ago . 
  ussr as state did n't go anywhere . 
  it was modified - partially to support myth how west has won cold war ( instead of ussr 's management decided to privatize natural resources ) - but right now those modifications are being reverted because government 's goals were achieved . 
  it 's still the same aggressive state as it was 30 years ago - but weaker . 
  at the moment full `` unofficial '' prohibition to leave the country is covering fsb ( ~ 30k people ) , police ( ~ 1m ) , army ( 220k officers ) , president 's `` management company '' ( 100k ) , various bureaucrats ( ~ 1m ) . 
  they will not be prohibited to re-enter the country but their career may end . 
  afaik russian entry visa is among the most difficult visas to obtain . 
  once you are inside it 's not that difficult if you follow relatively simple rules ( carry copies of papers with you and register in new place during 3 days after arrival ) . 
   could you explain why russia would restrict entry into their own country from russian citizens ? 
  it look like the state is preparing for a war while corruption is its corner stone and it 's rightfully afraid bureaucrats will be bought by foreign intelligence if they leave the country for a day . 
   i ca n't comprehend how a country could restrict travel in their own country . 
  it 's actually very easy part : it happens because rufed is not a country but an empire which consist of multiple semi-independent states ( colonies ) without direct bureaucratic communications with each other and very poor informational infrastructure .
