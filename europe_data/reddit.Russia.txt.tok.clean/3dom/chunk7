  there are zero to none communications between various state organizations ( like police , pension fund , state-run banks and insurance companies ) within the same quasi-state ( like moscow region ) . 
  so citizens of these colonies/states have to have a lot of identification papers with maximum possible amount of information in them . 
  often people have to obtain papers in one organization to show them in another organization across the street - or even for the same organization but with different level ( federal vs municipal vs regional ) . 
  it 's like eu but with much less integration of bureaucrats in different countries . 
  that is why kremlin is so furious about political deals of ex-ussr states with eu - because once the integration process will be started for them it 'll be much easier to integrate into eu completely rather than return back to rufed which inherited 100 years old structure/design of ussr state ( which was a remake of serfdom-based tsarist russian empire ) . 
  if you work for the government you can not leave the country right now - at best you will be fined and/or fired upon return ( if you 'll manage to get out ) . 
  it look like the `` country '' is collapsing into isolated iran-like ( or even north korea-like ) state . 
  there were some corrections in civil codex last year and i heard there are severe penalties for violations of passport regime ( example : 2 weeks of jail time for expired internal passport ) . 
  getting out of the country is actually easy ( still ) - if you do not belong to 2 + millions people working for the state or do not plan to return . 
  nope , still here . 
  however i 'm finishing my stuff during this week ( if not tomorrow ) and getting out during next week most likely . 
  imagine what will happen if one of the trucks will carry and deploy a machine gun and/or cannon and start shooting onto ukrainians and they 'll have to answer . 
  russian `` news '' : `` ukrainians have killed our ~ ~ spetsnaz ~ ~ medics !! 1 ! '', 
  these are provocateurs , no doubt . 
  if anything kremlin surely does not care about people - otherwise they would close the border to prevent naive clowns ( and spetsnaz ) joining rebels . 
  official explanation : police [ search for money ( ~ 1 million euro ) of dagestani senator/businessman/criminal ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/12/08/2014/942407.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[item_4] ) . 
  during 2013 valio has imported products for 242m euros into russia . 
  21 years ago the very same person as today - [ shoigu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sergey_shoygu ) - has organized `` russian humanitarian convoy '' in abkhazia . 
  hundred + of unchecked trucks allowed a big group of abkhazian and chechen troops to sneak past defensive lines of georgians and cut off abkhazia 's capital - soukhumi - from mainland georgia . 
  result - fall of soukhumi , abkhazia is a somali-like lawless region today . 
  also russian `` peacekeepers '' like to allow artillery to shoot from their positions to provoke reciprocal fire and then blame locals for starting war - with `` peacekeeping '' invasion to follow . 
  georgia is a good example of russian `` humanitarian '' operations . 
  for me it will be a miracle if there are still people who can fall for `` russian humanitarian convoy '' trick . 
  it seems [ after shooting the wrong plane ] ( http://informnapalm.org/671-kakoj-samolet-sobyralys-sbyt-terrorysty/ ) and follow up [ discharge of 18 high-ranking officers ] ( http://euromaidanpress.com/2014/08/08/putin-secretly-and-suddenly-dismisses-18-high-ranking-officers/ ) kremlin is desperate to find a `` fair '' reason to invade ukraine if they have to use well-known `` humanitarian convoy '' tactic for that . 
  edit : added links . 
  edit 2 : kiev has offered to re-load cargo onto ukrainian trucks at the border , [ kremlin has rejected this `` ridiculous '' offer ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/12/08/2014/942479.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[item_8] ) . 
  it seems kremlin did n't like the idea to allow ukrainians to see spetsnaz battalion and its weapons hidden in 280 trucks . 
  i mean +1 battalion besides ~ 500 fsb and gru officers poorly disguised as truck drivers . 
  stock in stores was n't ( literally ) removed by the government - yet , it 's being bought out by people . 
  however i expect there will be prohibition to sell products originated from eu/us because present structure of the country and `` eurasian union '' allow import through kazakhstan and belarus . 
  ** russia ** , no more meat , only potato now * government has sanctioned its own population and western business with embargo on food import ( meat , poultry , dairy products , fruits , vegetables ) , [ up to 15 % of food was removed in certain segments ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/economics/09/08/2014/941977.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[item_4] ) - government says it will help local production . 
  thing is in most cases local food manufacturers partially belong to corrupted bureaucrats - so it look like the state simply removed its foreign competitors to substantially boost income of bureaucrats . 
  bulk prices for certain products have [ increased by 100 % already ] ( http://flashnord.com/news/russkoe-more-uvelichilo-otpusknuyu-cenu-na-losos-v-dva-raza ) ( salmon for example - and its local manufacturer belongs to the families of government officials and `` pocket oligarchs '' ) . 
  note : afaik quickly growing food prices are the main trigger behind `` arabian spring '' .

  i believe at that moment huns , vandals and other barbarians have bred somewhere around altai mountains to invade europe and destroy roman empire later ... 
  it could explain our tradition to invade western territories ( i mean - besides our tataro-mongol roots ) . 
  just oil and gas left to cut . 
  plus `` luxury goods '' ( cars , computer games ) . 
  i heard there are couple jewish people there . 
  afaik there was n't jewish majority - it 's just a title . 
  just like present government is creating `` gambling zones '' , `` hi-tech camps '' here and there but there are no actual casinos or hi-tech companies ( or just handful of them , not enough to justify title ) . 
  because corruption . 
  you try to do anything beyond family barn - you 'll get police , medics , attorney general , certification committees , emergency services , tax police extorting money from you in advance before you got any income . 
  instead of actually breeding pigs it 's faster and easier to get a loan to `` create a farm '' in the bank , share it with local police and prosecutors ( for proper investigation results ) and say to bank `` i 've tried and failed , your money gone , bye ! '', 
  jews have fled - now there are even less of them than it was in ussr . 
  those who left ( georgians , ukrainians , tajiks ) do not have a better place to go - not yet at least ( shops still have food here ) . 
  in russia there is only one side . 
  or gulag . 
  it 's not exactly `` was '' - we have the same bureaucracy , they did n't go anywhere in 1991 . 
  they just took a `` capitalism break '' to privatize and capitalize on natural resources . 
  now they are trying to return country into brezhnev-andropov era . 
  at least [ three people were sentenced and killed ] ( http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%94%d0%b5%d0%bb%d0%be_%d0%a0%d0%be%d0%ba%d0%be%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b0_%e2%80%94_%d0%a4%d0%b0%d0%b9%d0%b1%d0%b8%d1%88%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%ba%d0%be_%e2%80%94_%d0%af%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%b0 ) for selling jeans , cigarettes , currency . 
  yes , also oranges 2-3 times per year . 
  better do n't do that : in ussr people were sentenced to death for selling jeans . 
  probably meat import will be saved till the very end of relations - country depends on it heavily . 
  however there were news about prohibition of import of meat from one of eu countries earlier today ( romania or bulgaria ) . 
  at least now we have good relations with cuba - thanks to putin 's visit to them and $ 30b of written off debt - so we 'll be able to buy 1kg of sugar per month per person using food stamps . 
  just like it was during good ol' times of ussr . 
  6 months ago we did n't see how russia could invade ukraine . 
  most of us at least - i 've expected georgian scenario in ukraine since december / maidan start . 
  you ask question as if you were talking about real state and real government created by people for people instead of gang of confused crooks who inherited quasi-empire / quasi-country from a group of conspirators which destroyed ussr to privatize and ransack its natural resources . 
  logic of their behavior is different , they are protecting and saving their own money instead of the country . 
  russia import a lot - up to 30 % of beef , 50 % + fruits , some vegetables , all non-cheap alcohol ( except for few sorts of vodka ) . 
  if government will cut off these products from eu and us and us will convince argentina , brazil , turkey to join sanctions then starvation in russia is n't unrealistic . 
  for sure there will be shortage of meat products - just like it was in ussr . 
  if i was a conspiracy theorist i 'd say it 's being done on purpose to weaken population of russia - to prevent or postpone possible revolution . 
  starving people wo n't revolt . 
  no more meat , only potato now . 
  ( 30 % of beef consumed in the country was [ imported ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/06/08/2014/941409.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[main_item]-[title] ) - and only 1 % of potato ), 
  no need to go through mountains - there is no border control between russian federation and kazakhstan / belarus . 
  first of all - i do n't have proper papers to leave the `` country '' . 
  not to mention fact i do n't have a set of papers to live in it . 
  bureaucrats are just refusing to provide anything free of charge ( w/o bribes ) . 
  i doubt fsb is really monitoring anyone but few people they actually count as dangerous ( i.e. 
  terrorists or `` freedom fighters '' ) - they simply do n't have enough resources . 
  also of all bureaucrats in russia fsb personnel is the most sane people i 've met - they wo n't waste their time on minor nuisances , that 's the job of police and attorney general 's office ( who do n't speak english ) . 
  a friend of mine has participated in the war on armenian side ( his platoon has shot down at least one azeri helicopter ) - while being a conscription soldier of russian army . 
  ukraine maybe - no paperwork required . 
  if mother russia wo n't send couple thousands tanks to kiev first ... 
  it was n't georgia who dragged 150 + russian tanks to the border ( it takes 3 + months ) and started evacuation in south ossetia 2 weeks prior to the war . 
  to me russia is clearly an aggressor no matter what suitable bullcrap was made up to excuse 4 wars on ex-ussr territory ( ukraine , moldova , georgia , azerbaijan/nk ) . 
  i 'm not a citizen of rufed . 
  thanks for suggestion !, 
  but first i need to cross the border . 
  thank you very much !, 
  i do n't have time to learn german , i have to get out of the country while borders are n't closed and dear leader did n't ask me to fight against nato forces on western front or against people 's army of china in the east . 
  also if you did n't notice - i already speak english , 
  it 's not like i can buy tickets , get into desired country and say `` well , hello , there !, 
  gib job , gib munie , plez '' . 
  `` good '' destinations ( australia , us , germany , france , canada , etc. ), 
  require years of paperwork done ahead ( which is simply impossible in my case since i do n't have any papers at all ) , those which do n't - are n't much better than russia ( south america for example ) . 
  except for upcoming war and sanctions part . 
  i 've expected russian federation will fall apart during next deep financial/economic/political crisis - i did n't expect it will happen so soon ( due to sanctions ) . 
  kaliningrad has good chances to become independent . 
  if i were local government i 'd ask to join germany right away . 
  about invasion . 
  i believe there are well equipped military units in the region and tanks , cannons , apcs will be left in place in case of rufed fall - so invading force has good chances to meet somewhat strong and well-armed resistance so for lithuania it 's simply impossible task .
