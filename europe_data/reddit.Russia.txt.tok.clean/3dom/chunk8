  to remind you : in august , 2008 before invasion into georgia there were huge war games in russia near the border . 
  here goes news which i 've expected : [ unprecedented war games at the border of ukraine ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/04/08/2014/940668.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[main_item]-[photo] ) . 
  just like it happened at georgian border in 2008 . 
  high chance for ukrainian military to kill me in the process of asking them for asylum . 
  if it 's not unusual process - when i can not understand what did it do on the first page of relatively big news sites ? 
  i heard about re-used footage on russian tv . 
  lately i doubt there is anything but re-used footage on tv : important news are being delayed for days and it look like editors simply search archives to find appropriate scenes . 
  it was obvious in the case of crashed boeing when tone and content of news in the internet and on tv was very different for couple days , tv studios could n't re-build their agenda and `` live footage '' fast enough . 
  thanks for the story !, 
   what would be the gain ? 
  if kremlin wo n't start war with ukraine then ukraine will clear rebels in its eastern regions - and those are ( at least partially ) rufed citizens + population of russia was `` promised '' `` novorossia '' back in july . 
  it will be perceived as ( yet another ) military loss and weakness of kremlin and it may ( and most likely will ) trigger stronger separatist movements across russia - starting from crimea to tatarstan , kaliningrad/konigsberg , siberia ( they 've already started ) . 
  with ukraine and us when they 'll join . 
  i have no doubts us will join ukraine in this war in one form or another - because they 've `` guaranteed '' ukrainian territory in 1994 treaty and their reputation as world leader will be questioned ( even more ) by russian invasion into eastern ukraine . 
  you are correct , my synopsis is overblown as usually . 
  however i 've seen how war has started in abkhazia and situation in russia today is pretty close to that . 
  in fact it 's exactly the same : there is military on streets but everyone is calm and believe everything is fine - until one day you turn on tv and see people shooting each other not far from your home , and then couple days later you see exactly the same picture but in your window this time . 
  there is no certain destination . 
  could be nice to just escape from russian federation , before authorities will ask me to go to western front to fight against euro-gay jew nazis in the name of our glorious leader . 
  what is it ? 
  google output results only in lithuanian , i can not read it . 
  thanks for reminding . 
  from now on if anyone ask i 'll tell beijing and melbourne are in russia - to avoid being charged with separatism . 
  with ukraine to start with - and then with us and nato if they 'll want to join ( somehow i 'm sure us wo n't skip this one ) . 
  i believe if it was preparation only to a war with ukraine then there was n't `` test mobilization '' of reservists across whole country . 
  somehow i thought derbent is in azerbaijan . 
  news are n't themed , i post everything i find interesting . 
  string in the header is the synopsis of that i see and hear - including news , opinions of my friends , journalists , bloggers , official propaganda and rumors . 
  however in the list for this week i 've skipped links to videos of endless military columns heading to the west borders of russia . 
  they does look like preparations for a war - with ukraine at least and then maybe with us and nato if they 'll decide to participate . 
  and somehow i feel us will join ukraine in this war - otherwise status quo of pax americana will be destroyed ( us and gb has signed treaty to guarantee territory of ukraine in 1994 - which was broken by mr. putin ) . 
  country is n't ready for actual war - mostly because even small failure may result in explosion of separatism and collapse . 
  i think it 's not a preparation for a war but entourage for attempt to rebuild chaotic and corrupted putin 's bureaucracy into militarized dictatorship with firm structure which could withstand upcoming deep economic crisis . 
   what is russian government 's goal ? 
  there are no reasonable goals seemingly . 
  i guess right now government is trying to form a political ideology and structure within the society to protect their ( stolen ) capitals which they had to return into the country after threat of sanctions . 
  as result country is turning into second iran - big and successful in the past , but just a part of third world today . 
  except for iran does not have as many separatist movements as russian federation . 
  for me closed borders and mobilization of reservists are pretty much signs of possible full scale military conflict . 
  perhaps i should n't skip posting ( long ) videos of columns of military vehicles going to the west borders of russia . 
  lucky you . 
  i 'm stuck in here for few more weeks at least . 
  imagine fox news with nearly unlimited budget , zero legal responsibility for content , zero competition from other tv companies - and you 'll get a picture of what is going on in russia . 
  there is not much to read . 
  until this idea with siberian republic was re-animated by a group of artists there were just handful of people who pursued idea of `` zelesie republic '' ( nationalist russians mostly ) in the center of russia and it was perceived as stupid game of far right radicals . 
  one of them is shiropaev - here is [ his blog ] ( http://shiropaev.livejournal.com/ ) . 
  idea of siberian republic has better chances to become reality . 
  there will be ( mid-august ) `` meeting for siberian republic '' - so authorities use all their force to suppress it . 
  except for throwing people into jail ( yet ) . 
  can not perceive crimea as part of russian federation , not yet . 
  not during this year , not yet . 
  today was supposed to be my last day before getting papers to get out but it seems there are some troubles a.k.a. 
  more waiting . 
  i do n't care about us as long as they are not going to create and maintain 4 wars within european geographical borders ( as rufed did in georgia , azerbaijan , moldova , ukraine ) . 
  propaganda-free shows were closed 3-10 years ago . 
  this one simply became useless for authorities - they do n't need to play liberal anymore . 
  most `` opposing '' tv and radio shows use `` good + bad '' tactic : they curse and praise authorities at the same time ( example : echo of moscow radio station and its owner venediktov ) and as a result population think opposition consists of idiots only and authorities are n't that bad . 
  i did n't see anything like this . 
  however there are reports about azerbaijan attacking nagorny karabakh . 
  `` average russian '' ( i.e. 
  people i know ) believe government is f * d up and is trying to blame anyone but themselves . 
  problem is - state does not consist of `` average russians '' but mostly from corrupted clueless idiots - and these people make decisions . 
  ** russia ** , we are getting ready for a big war edit , monday - fresh ( and really bad ) news : [ russia is about to start huge war games at the ukrainian border ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/society/04/08/2014/940668.shtml#xtor=al-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[main_item]-[title] ) . 
  reminder : before invasion into georgia in 2008 there were huge war games at the border . 
  [ +1 link in english ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/08/04/uk-ukraine-crisis-russia-military-idukkbn0g40cm20140804 ) . 
  from now on invasion may begin at any moment and eastern ukraine is about to be turned into lawless wasteland like abkhazia , south ossetia , transistria by russian `` piece-keepers '' .

  here is fresh bonus [ video of military column near western border of the country ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swzwgjudyrm ) for you to enjoy . 
  +1 bonus : joke on tv : us will fight against us till the last available ukrainian . 
  one more link : people in kaliningrad enclave ( konigsberg ) decided to create event '' [ stop feeding moscow ] ( https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=665855116817425 ) '' as follow up of upcoming `` federalization '' events in siberia . 
  100 years ago a person demonstrated how an interesting idea ( combined with a bit of foreign finances ) may change everything in russia . 
  here is [ removed article / interview ] ( http://bramaby.com/ls/blog/rus/1171.html ) . 
  apparently clowns in the office of attorney general never heard about streisand effect . 
  suddenly , almost everyone has read the article and got inspired ~ ~ with ~ ~ by idea to create local republic with its own set of laws , bigger budget ( less taxes for kremlin ) , and maybe even local army ( like in chechnya ) . 
  [ denisovan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denisovan ) humans . 
  [ arkaim fort ] ( http://www.ancient-wisdom.co.uk/russiaarkaim.htm ) ( ~ 1600 bc ) also there is theory we had live mammoths up to ~ 1200 ad on remote northern islands ( until humans got them ) . 
  hypocrisy is still here . 
  probably even more now since there is no distinctive ideology and reasons to fight against west - but they have to do that to concentrate capital and power to protect it . 
  that may result in winking and congratulations with pregnancy . 
  hostility toward non-locals may be presented in provinces but in moscow , spb , sochi ( where i live ) nearly everyone is either migrant or a child of migrants so the only hostility i 've seen was between nationalities . 
  plus couple jokes like `` why are you so slow ? 
  are you native muscovite ? '', 
  ( meaning migrants are more motivated and thus more active/smart/cunning / etc. ), 
  russia is more like empire than a `` normal '' country - that 's why it 's so weird and that 's why government treat population like foreigners while boosting anti-separatism laws non-stop to prevent those `` foreigners '' from forming normal states instead of one giant ineffective federation which survives on free resources from uninhabited regions ( inhabited regions in russia often consume more than produce ) . 
  so far i heard only ukrainians in crimea are being `` rewarded '' by mandatory russian citizenship against their will . 
  but somehow i 'm sure this practice will be extended when/if government will need additional citizens ( in case of war ) or acquire more territories . 
  i believe people insist for everyone to drink because alcohol is used as stress relief drug ( instead of method of socialization ) and they do n't want anyone to remember details of follow up `` relieving '' with puking , idiotic speeches , scandals between family members , brawling . 
  this is correct - paper checks are common in moscow and spb + in sochi ( tourists ) . 
  however there are also [ `` customs offices '' on roads ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_42ojxwrl6i ) which act practically like real customs within country and attempt to pass them ( as passanger ) without papers may result in really bad experience . 
  certain things became worse since ussr . 
  russian citizenship and papers are now being used for persecution of locals and foreigners . 
  thing is russia is divided onto regions which are de-facto different countries and are being treated as such by bureaucracy . 
  lack of papers may ( and will ) result in identity check in police station and there might be complications if a person is from different region or country . 
  latest ( 2013 ) updates to civil code allow up to 15 days of detention for violations related to identity papers checks ( like expired * internal * russian passport ) . 
  drink when offered - or be ready to explain firmly and many times ( to the same person ) why do n't you do that ? 
  if you drink then people will start to call you `` brother '' after couple rounds ( for some it may take longer but it will happen sooner or later ) .
