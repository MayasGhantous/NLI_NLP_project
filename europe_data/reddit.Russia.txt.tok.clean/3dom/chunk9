  if you do n't drink then people will think you are evil and plotting against them . 
  do n't leave home without papers . 
  do n't smile at strangers , and - of course !, 
  - do n't be gay in public . 
  gay is illegal here . 
  it 's like asking wolves to guard sheep . 
  it 's invasion force - like in moldova and georgia . 
  if there were real peacekeeprs in south ossetia , moldova and abkhazia those conflicts could be solved 10-15 years ago - because they could n't start without kremlin help at the first place . 
  for me it 's total bullcrap us/europe tolerate occupation of these countries by russian `` peacekeepers '' - situation in ukraine is direct result of this `` peacekeeping '' because kremlin decided they have cart-blanch to `` peacekeep '' ex-ussr neighbors at will after three successful `` peacekeeping operations '' when everyone in the west said it 's victim 's fault they need peacekeeping . 
  maybe i 'm a bit too emotional about this because one of the conflicts destroyed region where i grew up ( abkhzaia ) and it 's still lawless ethiopia-like anarchy due to russian `` peacekeepers '' residing there instead of normal state . 
  let me add some for countries i 'm familiar with and which are n't presented here yet : [ satsivi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/satsivi ) for georgia - boiled poultry with walnut sauce ( bazhe ) . 
  plus , of course , various versions khachapuri - bread with cheese - and my favorite tkemali ( plum sauce ) . 
  [ dolma ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dolma ) for armenia ( or for whole south-east europe ? ), 
  abkhazia ( if it counts as country ) - [ mamalyga ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%c4%83m%c4%83lig%c4%83 ) ( maize porridge ) with asydzbal ( either plum or tomato sauce ) . 
  usually comes with cheese and sometimes with satsivi . 
  note : mamaliga counts as east european dish . 
  also [ ajika ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ajika ) - unique abkhazian `` dry '' sauce . 
  now i 've noticed it - thanks !, 
  but it look like some kind of `` help '' link - perhaps re-coloring it into green can make it more noticeable ?

  official `` reason '' - something is wrong with their food across whole giant territory of russia ( they use local components ) . 
  mcdonald 's restaurant was one of the symbols of perestroika as they were one of the first batch of western companies which started to work in russia during gorbachev period , their restaurant on pushkinskaia square was as popular as lenin 's mausoleum .

  sum of the compensation is extremely high - $ 50b - especially in situation when kremlin is in dire need of money . 
   this was mafia-related mafia is a government here . 
  i feel like abductors were fsb or police ( like a friend of mine said `` why would you hire criminal amateurs when there are trained professionals available - which come with official cover-up ? '' ), 
  as for visa/mastercard - they 've offered to local banks to pay `` fee '' for them . 
  everything that is happening does look like an obvious stupid attempt of kremlin to force these two companies to create similar state-run company / infrastructure for russian government and then government will kick them out ( and probably will start to work with china ) . 
  i 'd bet my money on them simply closing their russian support offices and transferring responsibility for their operations onto local banks ( which are fully controlled and partially belong to fsb - i.e. 
  to the very same government ) .

  this movie is an attempt to convince russian nationalists it 's not putin 's fault he has enticed violence in ukraine to create `` novorossia '' and then betrayed all who believed him and went to die in donetsk , slavyanks , etc.

  edit : kiev winning the war may ( and will ) provoke unrest in crimea which may spread across whole russia and it seems kremlin does not want kiev to finish the war on its own terms ( i.e.

  couple weeks ago in exactly the same situation ukrainian president did n't buy it and allowed kremlin to crap itself ( kremlin acted as if they were about to invade eastern ukraine if cease fire treaty wo n't be pro-longed - but did n't do it ) so now [ substantial amount of nationalists think kremlin / putin has betrayed idea of `` novorossia '' and `` ukrainian russians '' ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/09/07/2014/935472.shtml ) .

  after similar meeting twitter has decided ( suddenly ) to publish statistics of micro-blogs - probably to be fully compatible with russian `` anti-blogger '' law which require blog platforms to show statistics so popular blog authors ( 3k + visits daily ) could be forced to acquire `` media agency '' licenses and then forcefully shut down if needed . 
  ukraine most likely . 
  that 's what i 'm going to do in couple weeks if i 'll be lucky enough to escape from rufed . 
  people that capable of critical thinking are n't really rare in russia . 
  it 's rare case when such people have time and motivation to post ( instead of packing their belongings for example ) . 
  it 's not only / hardly about cost of war ( s ) for rufed . 
  when putin 's doctrine to restore ussr territory + foreign policy have failed miserably with ukraine breaking up with customs union then his own life and fortune were in grave danger because ukrainians ( our `` slavic brothers '' ! ), 
  have proved he 's not worthy as a partner , his ideas and methods are utter bullcrap mostly , he can not control ukraine even with yanukovich 's corrupted puppet regime . 
  crimean annexation and follow up campaign was his desperate and successful attempt to prove his `` worthiness '' to his own entourage - which is surely ready to share billions of `` not his '' money any moment ( there was ~ $ 70b us treasuries sale in feb/march by an unknown seller at the same time as rufed sold part of its us treasuries + 20b euros cash stash was found in russian airport few months ago ) . 
  with crimean campaign he has saved his life - literally . 
  apparently his entourage do not want to eat him alive now so we can see his course becoming less aggressive , he is not desperate anymore . 
  when there was evolution in russia ( in 90s ) i did n't call it `` ussr restoration '' . 
  present process is degradation back into ussr-like ( or worse ) state capitalism / socialism . 
   duma tightens the belt around russians ' neck 1 ) it 's hardly them - duma does not have independent will as organization and 2 ) apparently rufed 's population is incapable to create modern non-aggressive non-corrupted state so the faster they ( we ? ),
