  5:20 - `` just look at how much it costs !, 
  is this alright at all ? 
  for a bottle of sunflower oil , such a price . 
  even more , this oil is n't anything , it 's not even olive oil , understand me ? 
  this , this , it 's worthless .

  but this bottle here , look , it 's all in russian . 
  they ca n't really fool anyone here .

  well why would i look at the country of origin ? 
  well you can check , but i can tell it myself !, 
  i know it myself . 
  ( reporter : this bottle , `` altero '' , it says it 's made in russia , belgorod oblast . ), 
  really ? 
  well , then it 's going by the legal license ... 
  guess i 'll put it back ... 
  it all has to be ours , understand me !, 
  well , this one is ours for sure !, 
  yes ? 
  let 's check the country of origin .

  the bucks are being earned by `` them '' , understand me ? '', 
  6:45 - `` this is stuff here , it 's all spanish , understand me ? 
  and what relations do we have with the spanish ? 
  well , if , say , they give us an entry into the country without a required visa , so we can relax there on holiday - they will start taking our fingerprints , like with the last , well , you-know-who - a fingerprint just so we could enter the country , is this normal ? 
  it 's a bit upsetting to be handing over a fingerprint ... well , it 's just unnerving , you know ? 
  and yet , how come they can just sell their stuff here ? '', 
  ( i really , really have no fucking clue as to what he was going on about here ) .

  `` 4 bucks . 
  ( cashier : hold on a minute , it 's hard to scan them , you know , you just sorta ... ) did i accidentally bend them out of shape ? 
  bent the stick too hard , hahahaha !,

  well , we 're not gon na cause a mess ( bends down and picks up his crap and puts it back into the bag ) . 
  we 'll clean it up , so they wo n't say that we are filthy pigs .

  it 's a law , you know ? 
  we have nearly have a cold war , with the european union . 
  well , why , why does europe , do displeasing things to us ? 
  well , it tries to displease us ...

  we need to set up food producing factories on our own territory . 
  and feed europe as well , sell it too . 
  10:55 - help desk lady : `` everything that gets into our store follows the certificate , it goes through the food agencies and the government institutes . 
  so the product ... is of the correct quality , we would n't allow any other types . 
  ( man : well , the guys came in , to find any illegal products ... ) \\* shakes her head \\* that sort of thing we just could n't have . 
  as a russian person , i can say that : everything should be tasty , and good , and more of our own produce . '',

  bring a mop and i 'll wipe it . 
  or i 'll pay for the labour of the janitor . 
  because i bet she receives pennies . 
  i have nothing against the store - i 'm against the products , these products .

  1:50 - `` so do n't worry . 
  just the one thing , tell the janitor to clean up the mess .
