in ukraine that ribbon is now widely known as a symbol of donetsk/lugansk separatists . 
  that 's why they hate this ribbon so much . 
   do you know it was n't merely the decoration of that old man , hard earned in the war ? 
  order of glory 's ribbon is very short , and it 's a part of the orden . 
  i do n't think anybody will detach it and wear separately . 
  `` instead '' ? 
  it 's more like `` both '' . 
  i do not support putin at all . 
  the ones who support think mostly ( a ) + a lot of `` putin protects us from evil american imperialists '' . 
  they report , then they get an official statemend and deny it . 
  already got disproof : https://meduza.io/news/2015/03/26/irkutskie-vlasti-oprovergli-soobscheniya-ob-iz-yatii-karlsona-i-kolobka-iz-bibliotek, 
  it 's obvious for you , obvious for me . 
  but not that obvious for 70-80 % of russians . 
  all major russian medias are filled with propaganda , and western medias are portrayed as propagandistic liars ( oh the irony ) . 
  if you repeat a lie often enough , people will believe it , and you will even come to believe it yourself . 
  and that 's what happens here . 
  sadly , it 's easy to create parallel worlds when you control all major media . 
   as ties between moscow and washington strain over the ukraine conflict , leonov offered a few solemn words of wisdom : `` there have never been frontiers between astronauts . 
  the day that this notion sinks into the minds of politicians , our planet will be different . '', 
  not everyone , but most putin-supporters are . 
  propaganda is really strong here . 
  putin-supporters believe : * putin is a strong ruler that russia needs . 
  * there is no alternative to putin . 
  * russian opposition is actually trying to destroy russia . 
  * all major oppositioners are paid by usa . 
  * usa started ukrainian euromaidan by manipulating ukrainian opposition . 
  * usa is so angry about crimea because russia ruined usa 's plan to build a nato base in crimea . 
  * usa is manipulating eu goverments to enforce sanctions against russia . 
  * eu people are n't supporting sanctions , but us controls their goverments and they ca n't do anything with it . 
  it 's classical `` unite against external enemy '' propaganda that i see on tv every day . 
  it was extremely effective in ussr and it 's working well in russia now . 
  i think you will understand . 
  can you see * anyone * on this photo clearly ? 
  i see some people with student-like bags , but it 's hard to tell . 
  it already ended . 
  weather went shitty so i decided not to go there . 
  sadly , no photos for you except for ones found on the net . 
  hahahahaha when there was olympic fire in my city , schools were using kids to fill the roads around olympic fire . 
  it was ministry of education order . 
  now the same happens with this `` concert '' : http://i.imgur.com/zjtkmll.jpg, 
  this is not satire . 
  real propaganda . 
  they are clearly trying to joke about obama , not about putin . 
  5th column means sort of `` evil opposition paid by west who wants to kill russia '' . 
  portrait is fine . 
  ordering teachers to bring classes to `` reunion with crimea '' demonstraions ( not sure if it is right word ) to create a visibility of support is totally not . 
  maybe i will be there , would take some photos then . 
  true . 
  paid trolls are mostly for keeping this `` circle jerk '' rolling at full speed . 
  there already was a big economical failure . 
  rouble fell from 34 / $ to 60 / $ . 
  good thing i started buying dollars at 39 . 
  yes , this is true i think . 
  milliard = = billion = = 10 ^ 9, 
  there is a lot of nice words that can be used for describing not-so-nice things . 
  and vice versa . 
  that 's how propaganda works . 
  tenders are story on their own . 
  they were designed to get rid of `` arranging things '' , but * something went wrong * and now every big tender is arranged too . 
  everyone can try , but getting tender fair is really hard . 
  sadly , it 's not . 
  well , people in russia just want to be proud of their country . 
  but political forces use this for their own needs , taking this `` proud of country '' thing to absurd levels . 
  internet is a huge step towards united world , at least for regular people . 
  no limits , no borders , no countries . 
  i think there was a lot of people supporting this annexion in crimea . 
  maybe even 80 % . 
  but ukraine got crimea after ussr collapse for a reason , not just grabbed it and ran away . 
  crimea relies on ukrainian infrastructure . 
  there is no connections with russia . 
  after this annexion crimeans started to feel it . 
  water shortages , electrical shortages , sometimes even food shortages . 
  increase in prices ( life in ukraina is cheaper ) , no jobs , no tourism , no banks and a lot of dreams about bridge to russia . 
  and this is without mentioning sanctions . 
  well , that portraits are just there too . 
  and they were just there even when medvedev was president . 
  still with putin , not medvedev . 
  not sure if all this portrait stuff is normal or not . 
  this is an exhibition from art studio called `` 13 studio '' . 
  goverment-sponsored i think . 
  or they are really , really big fans . 
  https://instagram.com/13studiya/ but there is a lot of similar content created in social networks by regular users or maybe paid trolls . 
  well , there are some good high-tech companies in russia now . 
  roskosmos or kaspersky labs , for example . 
  but they are either based on ussr legacy or are totally on their own . 
  every high-tech company supported by goverment tends to be huge money-wasting machine , with rare exceptions , and that 's why i 'm that sceptic about this sillicon valley called skolkovo . 
  some of russian high-tech production are for mil/gov use only , not for regular citizens . 
  most of russian consumer electronics are block-assembled from imported parts , or even fully developed and produced somewhere in china for russian brands and then called `` russian '' to play on patriotism . 
  western production is simply superior . 
  cars , devices and electronics , industrial and medical equipment - basically everything . 
  that 's why every real high-tech company in russia uses a lot of western equipment in their work . 
  in case this billions were n't stolen by someone . 
  hehehehe . 
  that 's how russian innovations works !, 
  it 's sad that non-brainwashed russians are that rare . 
  propagandists control every major tv channel and most of major news sites , they are using paid bloggers and internet trolls to work on sites that they ca n't fully control - mostly on social networks . 
  propagandists are even using schools to * brainwash children * . 
  in every class of every modern russian school you can see putin portrait watching you from the wall , and i heard all schools were recently ordered to make a special lession for * celebrating `` reunion with crimea '' * at 18 mar. 
  `` creepy '' is not even the right world for it . 
  it 's both funny and sad to see how russia tries to be all independend from west while using a lot of western production and lacking any useable replacements for them .
