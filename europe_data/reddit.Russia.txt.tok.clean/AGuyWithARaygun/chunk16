  genocide of balts too . 
  you mean nazi germany , of course . 
  because i distinctly [ remember ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6gemqn/how_dup_policies_align_with_sharia_law/dipwri3/ ) [ you ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fkcf8/today_73_years_ago_was_the_dday_in_normandy/diiwojw/ ) wishing they won . 
  that 's probably just bad grammar . 
  there are no `` the '' or `` an '' in russian . 
  so they 're probably just screwing with translation . 
  look at the thread . 
  tell me who 's downvoting . 
  til i 'm an ultra-nationalist . 
  such a clever joke . 
  you must be proud . 
  thanks !, 
  do you mean in russian or in english ? 
  republic of belarus , probably, 
  that 's pretty good . 
  thanks for the info !, 
  that 's pretty interesting . 
  how did they fare ? 
  do n't they have flight schedules ? 
  did n't this article get posted yesterday ? 
  yes , how dare that evil plane stop a foreign jet fighter from approaching a minister of defense !, 
  awesome stuff, 
  is this `` eurogays '' i keep hearing about on t.v. 
  that 's sorta what others say about russia and putin . 
  anything 's possible, 
  thanks !, 
  do n't forget those goods still being easily accessible to the ruling class, 
  well it 's a good idea in concept , and i appreciate the work that went into creating these designs . 
  just feeling like they would be confusing is all, 
  thanks for the info !, 
  it makes a lot of sense, 
  well , obviously . 
  hence my other comment . 
  ah , my bad . 
  thanks !, 
  well , looks like i 'm losing weight after all, 
  probably blocking import of something . 
  again . 
  was that the plane that approached our minister of defense 's plane ? 
  that 's pretty cool , i 'd say . 
  hydrogen energetics gets overlooked , i feel . 
  he 's fun, 
  is n't being memorable part of the point of a flag ? 
  guess you 're right, 
  i have read the title , yes . 
  and i 'm not strawmanning . 
  pretty sure that 's not even what strawmanning means . 
  well shit . 
  add to it ldpr proposition to return `` god save the tsar '' anthem . 
  thanks !, 
  this mosque was promoted as moderate . 
  which , i think , means a counter for radical ones . 
  would you disagree ? 
  nice one, 
  could you explain the difference ? 
  because i do n't quite understand . 
  there are romanovs currently living in europe and usa . 
  they come here occasionally . 
  u/telesphorus _ ii i could google them , if you wish . 
  but do n't radical islamists kill turks as well ? 
  you 'd think they would n't want their own people to get radicalized , or at some point they might decide erdogan is n't orthodox enough . 
  same, 
  yeah , `` new '' . 
  like with medvedev . 
  what for ? 
  really , maybe we should restore ours as well ? 
  by your logic, 
  look on the bright side - it got lit at all, 
  would you like examples ? 
  but why ? 
  looks like a giant snake . 
  awesome stuff, 
  ... you got me, 
  no idea, 
  if only it had more participation, 
  there 's an outside ? 
  definitely new for me . 
  thanks !, 
  it 's kinda like french subs with americans rooting for le pen . 
  weird stuff . 
  dude , i 'm russian and i do n't go there . 
  and there are dozens of us !, 
  indeed . 
  not that i can blame them , it does appear as a logical thing to do, 
  polish-lithuanian commonwealth 2.0 when ? 
  that 's kinda surprising to me , tbh . 
  thanks !, 
  ancient aliens ? 
  jokes aside , it 's an interesting discovery, 
  on i 'm sure our lawmakers will comply . 
  any day now . 
  what about them ? 
   balanced opinion  reddit dude, 
  mmmm , space, 
  dragons are cool . 
  we need more dragons in general, 
  russian exclaves you say, 
  great stuff !, 
  i 'd post ours , but three of them are a variation of one , written by the same person . 
  kinda ruins the point .
