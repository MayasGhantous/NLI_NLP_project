  point taken, 
  good point, 
  fair enough, 
  they took it into account . 
  the voter turnout was low . 
  even better, 
  if they were elected , they were relegated the decision making . 
  that 's representative democracy . 
  plus that referendum was a consulting tool from the start , no ? 
  just trying to understand the position here, 
  it 's dangling around 10 in nizhny novgorod . 
  missed that . 
  thanks !, 
  but those people ratifying agreements , were.they elected ? 
  thanks for the info !, 
  alright, 
  i knew about russian ones , that 's why i decided to ask . 
  just felt odd that western powers would n't have anything similar . 
  you say they used to ? 
  but what have they switched to now ? 
  * official * approval rating . 
  bit off-topic , but since you mentioned new smoothbore guns , can those new guns fire atgms ? 
  i heard they could n't before, 
  why not ? 
  nice !, 
  wonder where mine would end up, 
  ouch . 
  will his insurance cover it ? 
  do n't confuse putin and russia, 
  you do n't consider ukraine to be europe or ? 
  there was this huge storm in moscow , around 160 people got hurt , at least 11 reportedly died . 
  plus there are ongoing floods in the south . 
  shit 's scary yo, 
  do n't give them ideas, 
  thanks !, 
  learning new things everyday, 
  there are polish troops in afghanistan ? 
  that 's a peculiar way to do it, 
  fascinating !, 
  we definitely should, 
  nice, 
  thanks, 
  a what ? 
  could be a similar thing , you 're right, 
  good point, 
  what a surprise, 
  thanks for the laugh, 
  word is , it 's the most damaging storm for the past 100 years, 
  diplomat does what diplomats do . 
  oh the horror !, 
  nice chairs, 
  i like it !, 
  been to prague in 2006 or so . 
  it was amazing . 
  the city breathes history and yet does n't feel any less modern . 
  also , becherovka is great and karel chapek is a world treasure . 
  used what ? 
  my knowledge of history is lacking, 
  glad to hear it . 
  thanks !, 
  good luck with that, 
  why 's that ? 
  is the pilot okay ? 
  how strange, 
  ca n't say for hungary , but in russia government often goes against such movements , despite sharing certain bits with their ideology . 
  usually it 's because they do n't approve of any civilian initiative that does n't come from them . 
  could be a similar situation . 
  they 're not affiliated and thus deemed a nuisance, 
  is he doing a silly walk ? 
  promises , promises, 
  thank you !, 
  sorry for misspelling, 
  thanks !, 
  who ,, 
  that 's pretty cool . 
  it 's nice to see there are clever young people here, 
  little question . 
  is senate separate from seym or is it a translation thing ? 
  agreed, 
  end of the world more likely . 
  nuclear winter will fuck everyone up, 
  at first maybe . 
  later on it felt more like preaching . 
  i 'm saying this as someone who never supported military interventions by my country : obama administration was trying to teach , not understand . 
  possibly because he had a set case of beliefs and ideals and my government does n't . 
  good luck !, 
  would n't chalk it under religion alone . 
  large families are pretty traditional there, 
  so not so innocent after all, 
  that 's a relief, 
  well that 's a relief, 
  thank you !, 
  fair enough . 
  thanks, 
  oh definitely , i agree, 
  staying true to your name . 
  i can respect that . 
  even better . 
  thanks !, 
  maybe it 's nit meant to represent geographical borders , but something else ?
