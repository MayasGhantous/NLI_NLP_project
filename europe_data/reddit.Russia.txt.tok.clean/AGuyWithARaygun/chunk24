  thanks !, 
  thanks !, 
  thanks !, 
  is that proton rocket ? 
  ah , silly me , you are just innocent victims , bullied by big bad joe !, 
  seriously ? 
  you 're gon na justify your country joining the absolute worst regime in modern history , the one that straight up put genocide on their political program , with `` the ussr made us '' ? 
  seriously ? 
  remind me , did n't romania join axis ? 
  [ check out top oh 11 or so comments ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6a3ot8/happy_victory_day_on_this_day_72_years_ago_soviet/?sort=confidence ), 
  nice one !, 
  what is it ? 
  well they `` used to be '' russian , so that 's new at least, 
  start with st. petersburg , it 's got museums and palaces n stuff . 
  if you prefer hiking , near anywhere is good, 
  sounds a bit like [ okroshka ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/okroshka ) . 
  thanks for the suggestion !, 
  oh , did n't notice . 
  thanks !, 
  thanks for elaboration !, 
  here 's hoping we 're not seeing a start of a new war in the region, 
  it 's the little things, 
  i do n't get it , what 's wrong with using `` baltic '' ? 
  i sincerely hoping it was n't my government sending those guns . 
  is there any information on the kind of hardware that got intercepted ? 
  did n't see it in the article, 
  i do indeed !, 
  saunas are awesome !, 
  description so manly i grew mustache just reading it, 
  thanks !, 
  it is indeed delicious !, 
  do you use nuts ? 
  firefighters are badass, 
  do you have a favorite recipe for the upcoming summer ? 
  is n't it australian ? 
  [ i 'm planting aluminium cucumbers oooh ] ( https://youtu.be/htmmbxhwnog ), 
  do you plan on celebrating ? 
  this is a very important note . 
  thank you . 
  was n't arguing , your position sounds sensible and reasonable to me . 
  we 're cool, 
  here 's hoping, 
  i 'll do my part, 
  ah , thanks for clarification !, 
  well , when you put it that way , i ca n't really argue, 
  it 's not harsh , rather logical . 
  nato is a military alliance , for protection against military threats . 
  inner problems inside russia will cause problems for other countries in the long run , but you are correct , it 's not nato 's concern . 
  and yes , prosperous , but calm russia would benefit everyone . 
  obviously !, 
  geez . 
  i feel your pain even across the ocean . 
  which also speaks volumes, 
  do n't forget nukes n shit, 
  do n't give em ideas, 
  you should . 
  especially if you 're from a neighboring country . 
  if something bad were to happen to us , the whole region will like feel it . 
  they ? 
  huh , never thought of it from this point of view, 
  russian b , confirmed, 
  on the brighter side , you could always elect someone better, 
  odd , i thought he was generally liked, 
  sometimes silence is louder than words, 
  nuff said, 
  [ mostly this ] ( https://www.flickr.com/photos/elvaundine/7280774774 ), 
  hey , not bad !, 
  given his age , he probably does already, 
  no , * aggressive * russia is a problem , to itself first . 
  there 's a difference . 
  not to me . 
  i mean , clinton had more votes , so the majority of americans did n't even vote for the guy, 
  that was just a guess . 
  not exactly serious one . 
  thanks for answering, 
  you should keep it in these colours after eurovision too, 
  why , if you do n't mind me asking ? 
  oh , right . 
  thanks !, 
  here 's hoping , i guess, 
  thanks !, 
  vulnerable to voters ? 
  calm down , napoleon !, 
  makes sense, 
  you make great points . 
  thanks for an elaborate response !, 
  niiice, 
  guess you 're right, 
   as was germany , poland and the baltics . 
  they were also then devastated by the ussr in prolonged mismanagement or outright oppression . 
  i 'm not attacking you here . 
  this is something i 'm constantly confused by the russian position on . 
  you were far from the only victims , and in many cases were far better off than others , but those peoples have since improved markedly more since their penumbra as far as living standards , corruption busting and the like go . 
  never said we were the only victims . 
  that would be ridiculous . 
  but let 's not pretend it did n't have it 's toll and we did n't have a marshall plan to fall back on . 
  it left a scar . 
   well you invaded afghanistan for one . 
  i do n't recall people cheerleading the chechens at all , but russia did publicly turn it 's capital grozny into `` the most destroyed city on earth '' so perhaps there is some truth to that . 
  i know who invaded whom .
