  thank you !, 
  any news on why they were attacked ? 
  i was under impression that crimean tatars were mostly pro-kiev , am i wrong ? 
  do n't be so harsh on yourself, 
  where did all the cars go ? 
  could any crimean/mainland ukrainian redditors eli5 the situation a little ? 
  i 'm not exactly trusting of my local news to be unbiased . 
  poor italy, 
  thank you !, 
  ca n't argue with zat !, 
  thanks !, 
  have a better one !, 
  thanks still , it is neat !, 
  that feel when able to read and understand macedonian . 
  cool . 
  are there maps for other literary works ? 
  those sneaky montenig - i mean monte-african-americans !, 
  i do.watch news . 
  and read news . 
  not just here too . 
  it ai n't happening , unclench already . 
  trieste is awesome , been there once . 
  got lost and had a nun explain me the directions . 
  saw a guy running across the square in underpants alone under heavy rain . 
  good times . 
  those towers are slightly unsettling, 
  last i checked poland was in nato and is one of the main supporters of usa in the region . 
  what invasion , friend ? 
  so they never got to my area ? 
  lame, 
  the what now ? 
  how do you pronounce it ? 
  try being one . 
  it 's actually funny at times , though not as funny as r/politics , they seen convinced putin secretly controls the world . 
  was about to say this . 
  first responder proves the point too . 
  disproven already . 
  the comment you posted is not on reddit either . 
  see , i was looking through r/europe alone . 
  a more extensive digging would yield much juicer results . 
  thanks !, 
  gotcha , thanks, 
  thanks, 
  heard about this article in the morning , and here you are , hey . 
  does anyone know how credible this zdf is ? 
  i 've never heard of them before . 
   with `` white people '' he includes also russian . 
  and what is the problem with that ? 
  how so ? 
  yes . 
  well , at least he quit, 
  how do you say maidan in turkish ? 
  the headline made it sound worse than the statement, 
  the guy in the thumbnail looks like my neighbor, 
  like , fight him personally ? 
  this i 'd like to watch !, 
  and thank whatever gods there may be for that !, 
  you 're too kind, 
  thanks !, 
  will do, 
  thanks for answering, 
  well alright . 
  thanks, 
  serious question . 
  does poland have their own facilities that make nuclear reactors , or will that mean buying elsewhere ? 
  i 'm ashamed to admit , but no , i have not . 
  thanks for explaining !, 
  what would you say are the pros ? 
  i 'm admittedly not well versed on the subject . 
  thanks !, 
  so should n't these poles be installed ( if they are n't already ) instead of the glass ? 
  how many things can stop a truck going full speed though ? 
  yesterday at worldnews there were claims that the video in question is exactly what shows the guy getting truncheon-d . 
  note , i have n't seen the video myself . 
  it is possible if they thought they could get away with it . 
  such things happen , unfortunately . 
  may i ask why ? 
  i 'm not familiar with the name . 
  will there be `` scotlandisours '' t-shirts ? 
  lot of stuff is formally possible . 
  some of them are only possible formally . 
  odd . 
  maybe i 'm reading wrong news , but the only mention of macron in news i 've seen was a general overview of all candidates . 
  it was fairly neutral in tone too . 
  do you need a running mate ? 
  from what i 've read if him , he 's not `` good '' , rather `` not aggressively bad '' . 
  he mentioned being willing to improve relationships between countries , is considered conservative and in general looks solid , unlike le pen , who 's a bit weird . 
  how do they fare ? 
  that does n't sound good, 
  i 'm slightly confused . 
  when tpp plans were unveiled , reddit seemed pretty uniformally against it . 
  what changed ? 
  it 's happy , he/she blames most of estonia 's problems on either russian minority or soviet times . 
  i 'm hardly an expert on such matters , but have you tried interest clubs , science exhibits , museums ? 
  okay , so unfortunately ( for me ) most of the comments were [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5k6wc9/bbc_news_russian_plane_disappears_from_radar/?sort=controversial ) and were removed by mods . 
  here 's what i did find though : [ russia must be put in its place ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5gpoi4/comment/dau7w51 ) [ a new definition of heaven ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5rsfkf/comment/dd9zkuz ) [ some more ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3erk10/comment/cti01m0 ) [ not sure if joking ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3wynr8/comment/cy08nx9 ) [ apparently talking is out of style ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4qt399/comment/d4w0gfv ) [ whatever that 's supposed to mean ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5r01wl/comment/dd3t0ic ) plus a couple of comments on how eu `` should meddle in russian internal affairs and elections '' , if you count those . 
  interpretate this as you wish . 
  thanks still !, 
  good luck, 
  i 've edited my earlier comment .
