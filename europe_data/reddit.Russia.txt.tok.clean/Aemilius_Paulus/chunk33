  so they do n't notice how much their leaders are fleecing them . 
  ok , i know that sounded very much cynical or / r/iamverysmart meets / r/conspiracy , but in the case of russia in particular , it is 100 % true . 
   the west did n't do anything to russia until we broke out ourselves . 
  you 're utterly delusional if you think russia just ` let ' the tiny baltic countries go free because they got scared of some civilians protesting . 
  the military was getting the tanks ready ... 
  but gorbachev spoke out against it . 
  he was a decent man , or at least as decent people went in ussr . 
  he was also in the middle of various negotiations with the west . 
  he was a reformist but his reforms were n't going so well . 
  west would guarantee certain loans to him and also he did n't expect the warsaw pact + baltics to join nato afterwards , so he decided to go against sending military in . 
  make no mistake , if not for the west helping you guys out , you 'd have another hungary or czechoslovakia . 
  **** on the other hand , i do n't have much to say about refugees . 
  you and i are from very different cultures , but one thing i noticed about eastern europeans ( and yes i 'm still including you even though i view balts as a bit closer to westerners ) is that eastern euros are a bit more conservative and a bit more xenophobic than westerners . 
  refugees wo n't sit well in eastern europe , as hypocritical as it is considering eastern euros are all working in the west and sending remittances too sometimes . 
  then again , baltic countries are n't exactly huge . 
  poland is spacious enough however , so who knows . 
  any ex-soviet country that still keeps the marriage laws from ussr on the books has the same thing . 
  we call it ` zags ' office ( * zapis aktov grazhdanskogo sostoyaniya * -- the writing of the acts of civil status to directly translate ) in russia , ukraine and moldova ( three countries i lived in ) they all have zags offices ( i am sure most other ex-soviet countries still have them too ) , though i 'm not sure if moldova still has , last i lived there was the 90s . 
  zags is basically a purely civil office which does records of marriage and divorce . 
  even if you have a church wedding , the main ceremony of the signing off plus also usually the ring exchange takes place in the zags , a it is the only legal one . 
  of course , naturally ussr was very much influenced by the revolutionary secularist experiments of france , so there is that too  france 's contribution to russian culture lasted for three solid centuries where so many of our things starting from language to fashion to name to laws to even customs were modelled after french ones . 
  ah , now the american realises how a russian feels here  to be fair , putin 's russia is likewise ( and arguably even much more so ) obsessed with the `` west '' . 
  thing is , most people on this sub , especially from the eastern europe , lack the mental capacity to understand that not all russians automatically qualify as putinbots simply by the virtue of carrying a russian flair . 
  when you say ` my language ' are you talking about russian or ukrainian ? 
  i was born in soviet chernovtsi and raised in northern moldova ( ukrainian speaking ) but most people in chernivtsi were russian speaking , ukrainian was unheard of in the early to late 90s . 
  i speak russian primarily myself , but i can speak ukrainian haltingly , or read and understand it ( not good at writing in it ) . 
  ukrainian sounds like the softer , archaic and more folksy sort of a version of russian . 
  like russian spoken by someone with a pleasant , but yokel accent . 
  as one famous russian writer said , russian is great for scientific treatises , ukrainian is good for poetry , as it has softer sounds . 
  swedish and norwegian are to german as ukrainian is to russian to me . 
  scandinavian languages just sound so quaint , archaic and sing-song to me . 
  latvian is a very beautiful language to me , very sing-song . 
  german obviously sounds harsh and cool , just like russian . 
  for that matter , polish sounds like a crazy ukrainian to me . 
  it sounds like ukrainian , many words are similar but it is hard to understand it . 
  very interesting how ukrainian is so easy to understand as a russian and polish is much easier to understand as a ukrainian whereas my pureblood russian friends ca n't understand a single polish phrase save the cursing . 
  well , look , 99 % of those who died at the hands of stalin died in the gulags , but i 'm still going to call it ` murder ' . 
  i guess execution was n't the right word though you 're right , yes . 
  that implies something more formal . 
  my point was that gulags were closed down after stalin and kgb was put on a rein . 
  same did not happen in romania , which means that ceausescu was a shitty person even by soviet standards . 
  another thing that i see is that some romanians blame ussr for thousands of deaths at the hands of ceausescu but you say that he was n't that violent ... can we get some other romanians to chime in here ? 
  i 'm not sure what 's the consensus . 
  kim il sung did a lot to industrialise his nation and while he had soviet support , his experiments were somewhat successful ( though ultimately they could not function without the cozy soviet trade relations which could be defined as an artificial external subsidy ) . 
  romanian economy was already falling in the 1970s , it was n't until early 1980s that the juche policy began destroying dprk economy due to a weakening of trade ties with china , their main partner . 
  i mean , shoot , what people forget a lot of times is that the dprk and rok gdp per capita was equal until the late 1970s -- you ca n't say the same about romania and greece for instance . 
  lastly , kim il sung was arguably more educated and came from a higher-placed background . 
  kim il sung 's juche ideals were a tremendous influence on romania , i agree , but kim il sung had a lot cozier relationship with ussr . 
  in the context of the current submission i thought mao was a good comparison . 
  source ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/securitate the securitate was more brutal than the kgb by the 70s and 80s . 
  ceausescu was far more illiberal than the soviet leadership after stalin , which makes him an interesting case , just as honecker was . 
  of course , you probably know more than me about this without a doubt , but i was raised in moldova and have a romanian uncle who still lives in chisinau and works a lot in bucuresti with ibm , so i 'm not entirely ignorant of the situation in romania ( though again , you may have some new information for me here too ) . 
  i do n't think you read my post at all , i pointed out that the population of estonians and latvian populations grew from 1959 to 1989 but fell in the period marked by wwii . 
  you repeated what i said . 
  i also said that the russian population went from 8 to 30 % , but that at the same time the native populations increased as well , just not at the rate that russian populations increased . 
  immigration does not count as ` genocide ' if the native population is not being restricted from giving birth or killed off . 
  at least not in my book and in the books of most people . 
  the word genocide carries a lot of gravity for most people , language rights and immigration are common topics for far-right white supremacists who cry about ` white genocide ' and look how seriously they are taken . 
  just because in some countries like the us the spanish language and hispanic descent will overtake that of the english language and white descent does n't imply ` genocide ' . 
   easy to make that mistake as you admited you had only 5 minutes to familiarize yourself with the information before starting to talk your wisdom at me . 
  i 'm certain you knew the exact numbers before you looked them up too   i 'll leave this post uncompleted . 
  i just realized i am sick of your smug dishonest idiocy and weaving of lies and ca n't really see benefit to me in engaging you . 
  yes , dishonestly quoting impartial numbers . 
  where are you mass killings after stalin ? 
  you still have n't answered that , avoiding me turn after turn . 
  i 'm sorry , but if you are going to complain that the estonian and latvian language was n't uniformly taught on an equal basis with the russian language , i 'm not going to agree with you there to call that ` genocide ' because by that genocide would be more common than invasions in history . 
  the terrifying genocide of the quebecois in canada !, 
  thank god that ended in the 1970s . 
  well , it 's a bit hard not to consider holodomor as a genocide because it really was . 
  social classes had the option to reform , if a kulak collectivised they would be unlikely to be sent to gulag . 
  and gulags were not death camps , mortality was a side effect , it was not the intended aim ( however , on the flipside , nor did stalin undertake any campaigns to reduce the mortality , indicating a violently punitive mindset ) . 
  i still think holodomor was a genocide because due to food distribution issues whole villages starved , but the irish famine had the same conditions of continuing export whilst countryside was starving and yet i 've yet to see western countries call it ` genocide ' . 
  nor for that matter the bengal famines which caused dozens of millions of deaths are ever repeated on this sub , in fact , despite the fact that uk continued starving indians well into the middle of 20th century does n't seem to ever get any mention on / r/europe and even though english killed more than the jewish holocaust if we count india , i do n't see anyone claiming uk is worse than the nazis because they killed more indians than nazis killed jews . 
  in fact , i do n't see mentions of it at all . 
  i 've also argued with many people here who were either ignorant or in denial about the congo genocide . 
  there is a big double standard here , the crimes of russia are paraded endlessly but the western crimes are conveniently omitted and denied . 
  i think ussr was a huge mistake and putin is the worst thing that happened to russia in the last 10 years , but i 'm not going to sit quietly while history is being distorted to fit a propaganda perspective . 
  the title of this whole submission is editorialised to rt-levels of distortion -- turns out the ' 420 civilians ' is a figure that was compiled over 21 years of occupation over half of which are traffic accidents . 
  now , i 'm not saying it is excusable , but imagine if such a title was made in regards to us -- it would be called out for being a blatant distortion and putinist whataboutism propaganda . 
  us soldiers also were involved in a lot of fatal traffic accidents in germany , but a title the likes of this simply would n't work , because things are only true if they are anti-russian , when you use the exact same tactic to make statements about the west it becomes ` putinist propaganda ' . 
   fuck you france , that 's what you get for stealing my girlfriend sorry to hear , but you have to admit , hard to compete ... : / i personally prefer german men , but i 'm not a woman , so there is that . 
  lol , not your fault , i just mentioned you because you 're the only guy with a baltic flair who does n't reply to me with crazy things like ` genocide of balts after stalin ' or ` nazi germany was far better than ussr ' considering that the former one as far as i can see never happened , only stalin mass murdered balts . 
   `` you find the idea that estonian and latvian cultures came close to being exterminated by the soviet union ridiculous '' . 
  yes , i do as a matter of fact , let 's take a look at the population of estonia ( since i could n't find a good , detailed graph for latvia in 5 mins ) : estonia population : ** 1939 ** - 1,126,413 ** 1989 ** 1,565,662 ** 2011 ** 1,294,455 russian percentage went 8-30 % depending on the census so yes , this does include the russian immigrants and occupiers , but after wwii and its aftershocks settled down ( during wwii estonians lost a lot of population either to death or migration ) , the estonian population grew each census since 1950 and until 1989 . 
  then after the soviet union fell apart , there was a sharp drop in russian and estonian population . 
  between 2000 and 2011 native estonian population fell from 930,000 to 900,000 estonians . 
  perhaps the russian saboteurs are genociding estonians to punish them for leaving ussr ??? 
  yes , * such genocide of estonians after stalin , definitely * . 
  edit : found one about latvia , the drop in population of native latvians after the breakup of the ussr is far worse . 
  in 1989 there were 1,387,757 latvians in latvia , in 2015 there were only 1,229,067 . 
  estonia lost less estonians during wwii than latvia lost after the breakup of the ussr . 
  obviously this is due to immigration , not death , but my point remains . 
  native balts were not ` genocided ' after stalin , on the contrary , their population grew . 
  in 1959 there were 1,297,881 latvians in latvia . 
  population grew by 90,000 1959-1989 but dropped by 159,000 after the ussr fell apart . 
  ****  i already regret responding to your first message , because i know what you are like and do n't want to have that sort of conversation today . 
  i regret that you had the ill sense to post something so nonsensical . 
  now i know you 're crazy , whereas before i did not know of you . 
  you know me even though you disregard all i say because of your paranoid belief that i am a paid shill that crafts propaganda of serpentine complexity ?
