but nationalism in the russian sense ( you speak russian = you are russian ) that 's pretty much the opposite of how our nationalists actually think . 
  they see being russian as belonging to the russian ethnic group . 
  i guess they have their own rules as to who can `` join '' and all that , but they most certainly wo n't see everybody who speaks russian as a russian , far from it . 
  so , for example an armenian or a kalmyk who speaks russian as their first language will not be seen as russian by our nationalists . 
   i do n't think it was nobility of poles to leave the russian faith to russians besides , this ignores the fact that sigismund iii ultimately wanted to convert russia to catholicism . 
  the fact that it did n't happen was because the poles got kicked out . 
   i mean , take the example of 1610 conquest of moscow - we could have forced russia into a personal union and enforce catholicism on russia but we opted not to do that respecting russia 's orthodoxy i mean ... sigismund iii wanted to convert russia to catholicism , and this of course only reignited the resistance against him . 
  poland did n't enforce catholicism on russia because it did n't win , not because it lacked egoism ( lol ) . 
  do you primarily speak spanish or basque in your everyday life ? 
  in general , how is the basque language doing ? 
   tatarstan leaving aside the arguments about the level of integration , mixed demographics and all that . 
  i 'm wondering how that would look in practise considering the fact that it would be a pretty small state surrounded by russia on all sides . 
   siberia regionalism i 'm from siberia , i 'm sure we have some people advocating for siberian separatism , even though i 've never met them . 
  but their amount is so negligible that they 're not in any way taken seriously by the locals . 
  it depends on what you mean by a break-up . 
  the more realistic ( if for various reasons not very likely at this point ) scenario would be chechnya and maaybe dagestan breaking away . 
  but it would be silly to call this a break-up of russia . 
  for russia to actually fall apart the break would need go across russia and divide the regions dominated by ethnic russians . 
  and ethnic russians are culturally speaking a pretty homogenous group . 
  the eu with its many nationalities certainly does not have a unifying identity close to that . 
  border regions are pretty swamped as far as i know . 
  but people are going to wherever there 's work , be that moscow/st pete , siberia or wherever . 
  of course there are also plenty ukrainians who are moving on a permanent basis , or alternatively there are people who came over as guest workers who end up settling down . 
  ukrainians who 've lived in russia for a long time are usually russian citizens , and that 's a whole other category . 
  i was talking specifically about ukrainian citizens who are coming to russia , many of them are good old fashioned guestworkers who are transferring money back home to their families in ukraine ( russia is still the leading country as far as that is concerned ) . 
  earlier this year ukrainian ministry of foreign affairs said something about 4 million ukrainian citizens in russia . 
   in russia , it 's the asians , usually from former ussr that work there . 
  plus a couple million ukrainian workers of course . 
  you 're forgetting about our biggest group of migrants . 
  ukraine is currently the number one source of migrants to russia , and that 's a stream that will not be drying up any time soon . 
   i trust eurostat data over russian stats agency data . 
  lol , where do you think eurostat gets the data ? 
  they get it from russia anyway . 
  it 's the russian government that has all the data about registered births in the country , how would outside agencies keep track of that independently ? 
  slovenia had a tfr of 1.58 in 2014 and not 1.33 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_slovenia, 
  russia 's total fertility rate went from 1.29 in 2005 to 1.75 in 2014 , so that 's a change of 0.46 . 
  basically my comment is the same as in the last thread , why not use the actual data from 2014 ? 
  yes , but they are not the drive behind the increase . 
  let 's compare the data from 2010 ( the one on the map ) and last year for the whole country and the north caucasian republics . 
  in 2010 the tfr was 1.57 and the total amount of births was ** 1,788,948 ** . 
  out of those we had 37,753 ( chechnya ) + 11,178 ( ingushetia ) + 52,057 ( dagestan ) + 10,303 ( north ossetia ) + 12,576 ( kabardino-balkaria ) + 6,139 ( karachay-cherkessia ) = ** 129,826 ** births ( north caucasian republics ) in 2015 the tfr was 1.78 and the total amount of births was ** 1,944,136 ** . 
  out of those 32,057 ( chechnya ) + 8,674 ( ingushetia ) + 54,724 ( dagestan ) + 10,341 ( north-ossetia ) + 12,627 ( kabardino-balkaria ) 5,803 ( karachay-cherkessia ) = ** 124,226 ** births ( north caucasian republics ) . 
  so while there 's been an increase in the fertility rates and the total amount of births in the whole country the contribution of the north caucasian republics has even seen a slight drop ( mostly because fertility rates in chechnya and ingushetia are creeping down ) . 
  some policies have been introduced that are believed to have had a positive influence like `` maternity capital '' . 
  that 's when you get some money after your second ( third , etc ) child that you can spend on certain child related things . 
  and i guess people feel more security and stability in general , so it 's easier to have children . 
   or is it the case of far away regions leading this ? 
  `` far away regions '' were n't exactly struggling with their demography before . 
  they just could n't save the overall picture due to their small share in the total population . 
  this raise would ' t be possible without some general improvement . 
  russia 's fertility rate in 2014 was 1.75 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_russia#after_wwii, 
  no offence , but putting chechnya and siberia of all places on the same list shows that you 're totally unfamiliar with russia . 
  seriously , siberia is uber russian . 
  trying to get a half-serious independence movement going here would sooner make you a laughing stock . 
  about 80 % of the russian population are ethnic russians , i 'm not sure if you thought that percentage was bigger based on this map . 
  but you have to take into account the difference in [ population density ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9f%d0%bb%d0%be%d1%82%d0%bd%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82%d1%8c_%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f_%d1%81%d1%83%d0%b1%d1%8a%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b2_%d0%a0%d0%be%d1%81%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%b9%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b9_%d0%a4%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%b8#/media/file:12_%d0%b2%d0%be%d0%bb_2.png ) across the country . 
  the asian part of the country is really huge but much less populated . 
  and since siberia was sparsely populated by the time russians got there it was n't very hard to , well , outnumber the natives . 
  like , my family ended up in siberia in the 19th century when the government was encouraging migrants from the western part of the country by offering free land . 
  why not ? 
  it can be both and neither . 
  you know , things will also depend heavily on which region/city you 're in . 
  ultimately speaking i 'm biased since it 's my home country and i like living here , other people might have different perceptions . 
  having spent some time in western europe in the past i can say that westerners sometimes have this exaggerated view on what life in russia can look like , but most of the time things are much more mundane than imagined . 
  idk how to explain really . 
  they 're associated with increased criminality . 
  you have to take into account that it 's often fairly young and uneducated men who are coming to russia looking to make money . 
  at the same time they are coming from a different more traditional society and in russia the social control they might have been under at home falls away , so it 's easier and more tempting to act out . 
  and i guess russia is seen as a more lucrative place by their criminal elements . 
  yes , but uzbeks , tajiks , azerbaijanis , etc are still foreign to russia and they also bring plenty of `` multiculturalism '' with them . 
  russia has the third biggest immigrant population in the world . 
  used to be second , but has been recently surpassed by germany . 
  which regions would you merge together ? 
  why ? 
  since most people living in eastern russia are ethnic russians , the europe-asia border is n't particularly meaningful to us . 
  ok , it makes sense she 'd say something like that if she had a strong interest in asia . 
  she must have been buryat if she looked asian and was from around baikal . 
  she was pulling your leg probably . 
  i mean who * really * cares about what happens in tibet besides tibetans ? 
  i 'm from siberia , but from what i gather from my friends who live in the far east , most of the time they have a pretty vague image of what is going on in japan or china . 
  and those are the people who actually live close to the border with china , unlike those living near baikal . 
   2 ) siberian russians , whose ancestors migrated to siberia before the revolution  3 ) the people who came to siberia during big industrial projects in soviet times . 
  there 's no difference between 2 and 3 , we 're just russian . 
  i 'm a mix of both , most of my family moved to siberia in the 19th century and one grandmother came over in the 1960s . 
  they do n't perceive themselves as different from each other . 
  11 year olds are already required to wear the hijab ? 
   for instance vladivostok was chinese in the early 19th century this is what i mean . 
  vladivostok was not chinese in the early 19th century , because there was no vladivostok back then . 
  it was established by the russians in 1860 . 
  the region where the city was later built used to be chinese of course and there were some local fisherman living in that area , since han chinese were banned from settling there by the qing dynasty . 
   crimea for instance used to be fully tatar before stalin . 
  no , crimea already was n't fully tatar at the end of the 19th century . 
  tatars were 35,55 % of the population in the 1897 census . 
  and in the last census before the war ( in 1939 ) tatars were at 19,4 % of the population . 
   others pre-existed which ones ? 
  could you give examples please ? 
   it 's hard to say , because some cities far to the east were completely repopulated with ethnic russians cities in the russian east were established by the russians anyway , i 'm not sure what you mean by ` repopulated ' ? 
  who knows , maybe over time we 're just getting closer to the same stats that other countries in the region have . 
  a convergence of sorts . 
  http://www.pewforum.org/2017/05/10/religious-belief-and-national-belonging-in-central-and-eastern-europe/ it seems that in comparison with other orthodox countries ( and catholic poland and croatia ) russia actually has a relatively higher percentage of self-declared non-religious people .
