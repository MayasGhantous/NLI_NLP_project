footage of the new ukrainian `` national guard '' out on maneuvers ? 
  seriously , which movie is this from ? 
  it looks like a battle scene where cossacks are fighting pollacks ( red and white flag in there ) . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  ukrainians should stop hating russians and start hating pollacks again . 
  we will help you destroy those catholic degenerates once and for all . 
  well , you obviously changed it . 
  if you can manage being the only black guy in ukraine , you can manage that . 
  you can not separate russia from its god-anointed emperor . 
  i do n't think that you watch ukrainian news . 
  two small recent examples of ukrainian propaganda at work : 1 . 
  a couple of days ago , ukrainian msm reported that their spetsnaz had recaptured two of the armored vehicles which were `` captured by the separatists '' earlier . 
  two things false about this : a. 
  the vehicles were not `` captured '' , but were handed over by ukrainian soldiers who did n't want to fight their own people and have either switched sides or disbanded . 
  the glorious ukrainian spetsnaz never recaptured any of them , because the very next day the `` separatists '' paraded all six vehicles , still `` safely '' in their possession . 
  early last week , the ukranianian msm reported that their glorious army had `` fought off '' an `` armed separatist attack '' against their base in mariupol , killing one `` separatist '' , wounding three and capturing sixty . 
  in reality , multiple pieces video evidence shows that the ukrainian troops opened fire on a crowd of unarmed protesters who were gathered at the base 's gate . 
  they did n't even have sticks , much less firearms . 
  both pieces of propaganda was picked up by the western msm and reported in the same manner as the ukrainians reported it , without questioning . 
  they have also been caught producing many fake videos , such as the one where a `` russian colonel '' is instructing the `` separatists '' . 
  the colonel in the video was later identified as a two bit alcoholic actor . 
  also , every few days , an article from kiev post or somethings , supposedly once-and-for-all proving that the russians are controlling things on the ground in eastern ukraine , makes it to the top of / r/worldnews they have all been subsequently discredited . 
  any way , the point is , the very same top western pr firms who won the propaganda war for tbilisi in 2008 , are currently spinning things for kiev . 
  russia is still terrible at propaganda compared to those spin-masters . 
   no , he did n't . 
  the person from belgo said exactly that . 
  you are right . 
  it 's not in this video though and i failed to remember it from the original broadcast . 
   no , you are lying . 
  this is the full broadcast on the official channel of rt. 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=lz1b8o9p0ts#t=7418 or maybe rt edited video to make putin weird as well ? 
  no lying . 
  i just remembered it differently . 
  however , it 's would n't have been out of repertoire for banderovtsy to do something like this . 
  in this case , just showing putin 's attempt at humor and not the rest of his perfectly reasonable and compassionate reply to the guy that did the trick of making him look bad . 
   this term originated from the ussr , when having a personal car was considered hubby . 
  edit : after the second thought , \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c ca n't be translated as `` auto enthusiast '' at all , \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c used there as amateur , non-professional , not as `` enthusiast '' . 
  if you are not a professional driver like taxi driver , etc. , you are \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c . 
  tl ; dr. you are full of shit . 
  yes , it is a very quaint soviet term and it personally makes me cringe a little and smile every time that i hear it used these days . 
  vladimir vladimirovich probably had the same reaction . 
  any way , i was wrong about several things in my post , but that does n't change the fact that this was putin 's attempt at `` kgb humor '' ( which was used several times during this call-in ) , that might seem callous to the westerners , but appears as perfectly innocent to me and every other russian , especially in the context of vladimir vladimirovich 's full reply and the fact that the guy is getting his road . 
  i might have been `` full out shit '' in my post , but the fact remains : this was a cheap attempt at smearing our leader posted by a ukrainian fascist . 
  that drunk guy was obviously a terrorist fsb operative . 
  no uproar when you talk about exterminating russians and your own russian-speaking population though . 
  awesome . 
  god forbid you mention `` federalism '' in a tv interview or the rightsec thugs will be waiting outside of the tv studio in order to beat the shit out of you . 
  in the glorious , free ukraine ... 
  `` sometimes people get sick and you ca n't even take them out of the village because the road is just terrible . '', 
  you made this part up . 
  also , this video is edited weird , like to make putin more `` callous '' , laughing in inappropriate places . 
  it 's not from the official broadcast . 
  the real thing was a lot more innocent and was clearly just an attempt at humor . 
  the guy did n't just say that he was a `` car owner '' . 
  he presented himself as a an `` auto enthusiast '' . 
  that 's what made it sound absurd and almost comical . 
  any way , nice job , kiev propaganda bot . 
  keeping scumming . 
  did you actually watch the `` propaganda show '' ? 
  most of it was uncomfortable questions about poor utility services , corruption , etc. 
  i am ex russian military and special forces . 
  when i saw the `` polite green men '' in crimea , i instantly recognized them as our guys - most likely professional ( contract ) paratroopers . 
  however , i do n't see any of ours in eastern ukraine . 
  sure , there are a few russian volunteers here and there , but there 's no russian military or spetsnaz on the ground . 
  i see a lot of former ukrainian military , lead by afghan war vets . 
  more moronic anti-russian propaganda . 
  growing by 1.3 % is considered shrinking now ?!? 
  yes . 
  the russian economy has slowed down after years of excellent growth , but you have to remember that russian per-capita gdp is way ahead of other brics as it is . 
  also , russia does n't even claim to be an `` assertive global power '' . 
  they were send there to develop these territories : teach at the universities , run science research labs , do skilled factory work , etc. 
  unlike the western imperialists , the soviet union did n't pursue a policy of forced russication . 
  children had to learn the russian language in schools , but every republic also got to keep their own language and cultural traditions . 
  it 's also ridiculous to compare these soviet `` settlers '' to those other ones , as they had no choice in the matter - you were sent to work in the baltics , western ukraine or ( god forbid ) one of the `` stans '' ( with kazakhstan being a notable exception ) . 
  yes . 
  they should be treated diffidently . 
  i 'm sick of people using those putin quotes out of context . 
  the catastrophe and tragedy that he 's talking about were nagorniy karabakh , ossetia , abkhazia , chechnya , georgian civil war , tajikistan civil war , etc. . . tens of thousands of people dead , hundreds of thousands of refugees , tens of millions of russians finding themselves living in foreign countries , families separated ... putin has no love for the soviet system and has repeatedly condemned it . 
  stop with the libel . 
  finns are funny little people . 
  you know what russians think about finland ? 
  we do n't . 
  however , if your little invasion fantasies and reminiscing about the good old days of mannerheim and white death make you feel better about your little selves , keep at it !, 
  poles really are ungrateful , vile people . 
  i avoid them at all costs , because whenever i see one , i get a strong desire to punch him out and i really do n't want to get in trouble with the law again . 
  you are a victim of years of constant `` blame everything on russia '' type of russophobic propaganda , but you will come around when the eu shows itself for what it really is - the fourth reich and begins to destroy your cultures . 
  we 'll have to come there and save your asses ungrateful assess from the blood-thirsty westerners ... again . 
  it is a rather empty gesture by a small bunch of ostracized malcontents . 
  you 'll still say goodbye to crimea tomorrow , bandera . 
  50,000 people in `` not '' massive for moscow ( a city of over 10,000,000 ) . 
  this is just a bunch of `` hipster '' opposition kiddies , protesting because it 's cool and hip . 
  typical moscovite elitist arrogance . 
  so , it 's a bunch of traitors ? 
  half of my family lives in crimea . 
  why do these people want them to continue living in an impoverished , not self-sustainable , clearly failed state that is ukraine , which is now ruled my a russophobic right-wing junta ?!? 
  by the way , big lol at the `` ukrainian army '' repelling anything . 
  they do n't really have a single combat-ready regiment and their troops are still equipped with soviet-afghan war era shit . 
  thanks , brothers . 
  wish that we could have done more for you in 1999 , but we had a leadership problem back then . 
  however , we will help you take kosovo back from the islamist terrorists yet and make those nato dogs pay for bombing your country too .
