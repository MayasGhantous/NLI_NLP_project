it 's horrible how russian gazprom uses gas prices as a political tool , right ? 
  [ those ] ( http://imgur.com/a/y2pjx ) strange cyrillic symbols reveals how deeply you are affected by low level propaganda . 
  i think you are right in every sentence ( and , obviously , i do n't support low-educated people who get attracted by mess like ukrainian conflict ) . 
  it 's very interesting who was behind his assassination , because it 's clear escalation of tenses : <, 
  and haplogroup n1c has nothing to do with irony and sarcasm ( =, 
  based on example of [ russian volounteer ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/17/prominent-warlord-arsen-motorola-pavlov-killed-donetsk-blast ) ( or i should say ` freedom fighter ' ? 
  ) , who was assassinated recently , [ locals ] ( http://imgur.com/a/czd6e ) seems to be very thankful - they do care . 
  yeah , if you run out of arguments , play a ` russian card ' , 
  that 's correct - most of the post-communist countries expirienced economy problems in early 90s ( [ data ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:aze:blr:hun:lva:pol:rus:ukr:est&amp;ifdim=region&amp;ind=false ) ) . 
  main reason for this is n't only social transformation , but the unpreparedness to compete with western goods because of their superior quality . 
  edit : worth to add , that ` poor 90s ' lead to a huge birth rate decrease , which soon will affect economy of post-communist [ countries ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_cbrt_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:blr:hun:lva:pol:rus:ukr:est&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=498430800000&amp;tend=1413579600000&amp;ind=false ), 
  it 's reminds me ukraine journalist 's suicide - took few minutes to turn it as russian special service 's job, 
  i was talking about thing common to all human , who 've evolved from the monkeys just recently and carries all of the monkey 's behavioral attributes . 
  ironically , you understood my words as an offense against ` your tribe ' with subsequent aggression against me and ` my tribe ' . 
  thus you confirmed my words and have made a fool of yourself  edit : too bad you did edit your [ comment ] ( http://imgur.com/a/qrw8v ) instead of apologies, 
   what i 've seen for the past 3 years coming out of kremlin and your state media , i 'd call that westernophobia ... see we can play that phobia card as well , your gov ' t and state media are spewing hatred against ` us ' westerners more times than i care to count . 
  that 's true , literally every government is palying this card . 
  naked monkeys tends to unite in a face of danger coming from neighbor tribe . 
  it 's f * cking biology and himmler was an amateur in operating these features . 
  however , there is a point i 'm repeatetly making over here - russian propaganda is clumsy and less represented , so it 's easier for us to ` wake up ' . 
  i do n't want to offend people like it seems , i deliberatly use rude words for extended emotional feedback . 
   your government please kindly accept the idea , that from opposite side it 's looks different . 
  for that reason it 's very important to increase diversity in information sources - both media and people . 
  my government or i should say putin 's inner circle indeed benefits from war/fear mongering , but so does western countries and especially military industrial complex . 
  there are numerous international competitions among students where eastern europeans and russians are doing great . 
  is it genetical advantage or consequence of education in communist countries ? 
  maybe something else ?

  / u/just _ szabi is right - a coin has two sides and it does n't kill to admit that totalitarian regimes of xx century also did something good . 
  yes , exactlly my point : primitive one liners can get upvoted if they fits simple condition - criticize russia/russians . 
  according to your comment history , you spend like 99 % of your time on reddit in russia related posts . 
  it 's ok , but you definetly knew details about those bloger and why this artcile tagged as `` misleading '' . 
  you are not revealing real information to community , but keep mocking russians . 
  why ? 
  - because you get dopamine release each time you get upvoted , and that 's creating rewarding stimulus for your brain ( same for vast majority of people here ) . 
  you may think it 's not too bad , after all you feels good so it must be something good happening . 
  but actually opposite is happening - you are crippling your brain with easy stimulus , just like drug addict or procrastinator . 
  we both aware of communism crimes ( well , i do n't agree with obvious exaggerations ) and we both know about the suffer people 've received from this ideology . 
  however , it seems that you do n't realise that there was something good in \u0441ommunism - it did not allow a person to become an idiot ( / wave eastern european it-guys ), 
  i 've registered on reddit like 4 month ago and it 's 4th ` russia denies invasion of poland ' here in my memory ( and second jerk over that blogger ) . 
  big surprise fellows did n't manage to pass through ` it 's not in their history books - nope , here is their history books ' in 7 hours . 
  what is pernament though is that simple russophobic comments receives highest marks . 
  community simply does n't seeking for historical context or at least details about mentioned bloger - ` russia is bad ' is enough to keep it going . 
  edit : the main point is that subreddit lacks of self-regulation - click-bait article with poor journalism attracts people simply for ` russia is bad ' narrative . 
  the reason for this is high percent of people with low cognitive capabilities who are affected by bandwagon and confirmation biass diseases . 
  just imagine how it 's hillarious when one of the most upvoted posts on a subreddit are fake photo by ukraininan militaries and an attempt to accuse russian for journalist 's suicide in ukraine . 
  ** o ** peration ** i ** raq ** l ** iberation took place between 2003-2011 , so it 's quite modern war with lots of high-end military gear ( and very-very democratic ) were used . 
  so in my opinion it 's remarkable , that western informational field injected with `` russia bombs civilians '' meme , while even pro-rebel sources like sohr provides data with noticeably low percent of civilian casualties . 
  also , note another meme `` russia bombs moderate rebels not isis '' - according to sohr ( who would lower numbers obviously ) ruaf killed up to 2758 members of the `` islamic state '' organization and 2851 fighters from the rebel and islamic factions . 
  that 's close numbers , is n't ? 
  so , once again , be aware of information you receive from your media - it seems it would be good for you . 
  worth to add that according to sohr out of 3915 civilian casualties 2398 are [ males above 18 years ] ( http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=51898 ) old , so do the math folks . 
  in overall , i bellieve that syrian civil war is a nice example why westeners should be aware of their mass media : it comes from a mildly controversial statement that refugee crisis caused by russian intervention , as well as rfom bitching about civilian casualties as soon as rebels come closer to total failure . 
  you do realise that you 've switched topic and originaly we are discussing economy issues in russia ? 
  it quite obvious , that we both could have separate views on the conflict , and for that reason our dispute wo n't change our opinions and wo n't add valuable information about the topic . 
  to be fair , it 's quite important to note that a lot of private russian firms are dodging taxes by paying employee without accounting it in official papers . 
  * one my friend * had official salary four times lower than actual ( = however , it 's not the case for majority of people, 
  ` war on ukraine ' thing is damaging only because of lose of market , which happened to both sides . 
  needless to say , that it 's not only no russian initiative , but we also warned ukrainian side about unavoidable damaging consiquences of opened market for eu goods . 
  respectable acra rating agency reported , that whole situation will cause quite long , but not that much deep recession in a real income . 
  important to note , that recession will look like downgrade in good 's quality , but not as deficit or lack of goods or services .

  voting results in rostov 's election station # 1958 are [ cancelled ] ( https://lenta.ru/news/2016/09/19/rostov/ ), 
  btw , is it widely spread in other countries to show online cameras at the election stations ? 
  thank you , dummy , that 's exactly my point : no matter what - blame russian federation, 
  it 's beyond laughable that western media and organisations does n't discuss revealed leak in a position of fair sport and required reformation in anti-doping authorities , but rather prefer to blame russia for hacker attack of unknown origin . 
  control over energy transit and prevention of eu-rus cooperation . 
  of course i 'll be labeled as putin bot and will trigger rage ... but i definetly advice to read his valdai and last un speeches . 
  inb4 ` it 's important what he does , not what he says ! ', 
  - it 's even more important what informational space you belongs to . 
  o / to be fair , russian oil not so easy to extract , to process and to transport . 
  oil industry have been profitable for so many years , so i believe a lot of top engineering skills/technologies are involved here . 
    russia targets the non-isis rebels , because those are closer to assad , and thus the bigger threat to assad . 
  russia was first to target isis oil business . 
  for some reason , usaf were allowing isis to run huge convoys over the desert , as well as to maintain financial operations with stolen oil . 
  of course , russian priority was nusra because of their proximity to big syrian cities , but it does n't mean that isis [ was untouched ] ( https://futuristrendcast.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/palmyra-russian-orchestra-concert.jpg ) . 
   there 's been a grand total of 161 russian airstrikes on isis since the day russia entered the conflict . 
   in contrast , us ' coalition has conducted 14,800 on isis source ? 
  according to anti-assad sohr , numbers are [ following ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/casualties_of_the_syrian_civil_war#foreign_air-strike_casualties ) . 
  so usaf kills about 0,4 jihadist per airstrike ? 
  definetly syria requires more weddings  how comes , that isis has started to lose territory only after russian intervention ? 
   as if it 's not propaganda meant to persuade people with weak cognitive abilities . 
  yeah , look at the numbers you 've provided ( =, 
  i realise that russian airstrikes causes deaths among civilians , but one of the undisputable fact is following : isis had been growing two years under usa lead coalition bombing , and then , year after russian intervention isis becomes waswas . 
  btw , i do n't trust american founded ngo 's - they are spreading lies among people with weak cognitive abilities  baghdad hospital in hreitan was directly targeted on 25 december 2015 and severely damaged . 
  a doctor and another medical worker at the hospital told amnesty international that a ** russian or syrian ** warplane fired ** missiles ** directly at the hospital . 
  russian ministry of defence denies deliberate civilian killings , as well as [ unconfirmed information ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vehv6j0gfho ) related to civilian infrastructure bombing, 
  according to the ukrainian site , which links to russian opposition source , where luzhin is speculating , that whole thing is about this paragraph . 
  actually , it 's lawyer and luzhin who are refering specifically to this fact , because it 's one of the few correct statements in those so-called ` facts about bandera ' . 
  whole situation is beyond comedy : soviet invasion is covered in russian school books ; everybody can google translate luzhin 's statements ; article posted in biased site - still people throwing shit on russia . 
  good thing noone commited suicide . 
  there are full bingo of westener 's delusions about ukraine : - yanukovich was pro-yanukovich , he was trying to balance between west and east . 
  most pro-russian moves by him are : allow russia to ** rent ** sevastopol naval base and official status for russian language in eastern ukraine . 
  - yanukovich was indeed legally elected , because country get tired of pro-west folks . 
  i hope it 's ok that i prefer [ real polls ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/187931/ukrainians-disillusioned-leadership.aspx ) instead of your opinion . 
  - they had a right to remove him by legitimate way , i.e. 
  by election or by impeachment procedure . 
  strange , but western media does n't report , that impeachment was n't successful : only 328 lawmakers did vote for impeachment , while 338 is required . . and constitutional court was disbanded right after the vote . 
  not to mention , that parliament was occupied by people with guns ... so there could be speculations about free will of 328 lawmakers .
