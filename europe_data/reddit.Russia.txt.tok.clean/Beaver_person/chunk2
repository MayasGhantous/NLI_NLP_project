  - i guess you refering to [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fns42rvixla ) . 
  it turns out that they were shot from behind - just like in any sniper 's appereance during color revolutions . 
  and imagine that - [ people from the police were killed to ] ( http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/ibigdan/8161099/5927278/5927278_original.jpg ) . 
   well ... 
  i know personaly many ukrainians who toke the opportunity of the conflict to immigrate to russia under the refugee status interesting flow of thoughts . 
  maybe it was their plan from the begining !, 
   most of the refugees did n't flee a war , but a state of fear that the russian media was spreading in compliance with the kremlin agenda yeah , it would be silly to think that they knew situation better due to eyewitness , - they must be fallen to russian propaganda . 
   russia opening the gate to ukrainian refugees was clearly a political move to legitimise the civil war you forget to mention humanitarian aid convoys - brilliant propaganda move , especially during blockade from ukrainian side . 
   are you trying to justify stealing with that ? 
  no , i was explaining that antonov 's employees would be much more valuable in russia , rather than somewhere in eu . 
  besides , stealing is n't proven yet : , 
  you are absolutely correct , our [ effort ] ( http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/56c37fb52e5265bb008b7729-1199-552/screen%20shot%202016-02-16%20at%202.56.51%20pm.png ) is undeniable . 
   you are probably seeing cars of ukraine `` refugees '' . 
  actually , you should n't put quotes there , because those ukrainians are real refugees - not some sort of economical migrants . 
  and it 's easy to recognise people from donetsk region - all of them has identical two symbols on car registration number 's . 
   sure russia `` moved '' some valuable factories in the east of ukraine to russian territory amid the conflict smoke . 
  probably some techical asserts indeed were stolen , however it does n't change the fact , that almost all ukrainian high-tech industry was oriented to russia ( mostly in military production ) . 
  i think it explains low cost of potential workers outside of russia . 
   antonov is not going to move to china , and china is not going to take over antonov . 
  that 's not entirely true : china boughts second uncomplete plane from antonov , but with a condition that all blue-prints will be delivered with the single plane . 
  i suppouse most of the antonov 's engineers already moved to russia , at least i keep seeing more and more cars with ukrainian registration numbers near one of the moscow 's aviation factory . 
  it 's a huge discover for me , thank you . 
  problems in russian economy not as serious as western media tries to portrait them , these sanctions even helps us to increase our security in certain fields . 
  besides , our relationships is n't zero-sum game , so i do n't see any reason for cheering . 
   just need to give a bit of time for the hangover but rf is already [ recovering ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-10/stealing-a-peek-at-russian-economic-recovery-before-it-happens ) . 
  you should finaly transit to the `` acceptance '' phase and realise , that it 's impossible to isolate largest country in the world with positive trade/migration/energy balance . 
  glad that you honest that much , however you missed the point : those `` suffers '' considered moderate , and sanctions does n't change people 's attitude to crimean accession . 
  only thing that is achieved so far , is a huge downgrade in eu-russia relationship , alongside with the decreased economical growth for both russia and eastern europe . 
  i 've to disagree about ` selected individuals ' - quite important economical sectors were put under sanctions : military , banking and of course energy sector . 
  obviously , a lot of people work in these sectors , so it affects every person in the country . 
  especially crimeans who passed through the huge challenges , including shifts in banking and legal systems and various sabotages from the ukrainian side . 
  what could make their life easier ? 
  - definitely not the additional sanctions just for their peninsula bleak media 's coverages of energy cutting and food blockade made me think , that crimea is n't intended to go back to the ukraine from the begining . 
  locals would n't accept this , and were punished for their position . 
  sanctions did change putin 's approval rating , but in his favor . 
  do n't think that elites would try to do a coup under fsb watch , even abroad you can end up with polonium ice-pick in your head . 
  how did you even came to such conclusion ? 
  lack of trust there means check for multiple resources with the simple idea all along - every media gives you just a part of whole picture , which better fits to agenda this media pushes . 
  for example , reuters reported that russian set up terror attack in instambul airport , but only rt reported , that those russian was actually chechen ` freedom fighter ' , who had been hiding in eu for many years . 
  when it comes to certain questions - yes , i represent majority of population . 
  the thing is , that after crimea accession society became more homogeneous . 
  if you interested in how my view correlates with other russians , i could search for polls, 
  i guess it was soviet union - contry that no longer exist , but still servers as scarecrow for people who does n't share interests with you . 
   we do n't care at this point balts represent majority in this sub , but it 's assymetry from actual population numbers . 
  for that reason , you have no morale grounds to say so . 
   bad evil west always hated us yes , we did n't saw required warm from west after cold war . 
  even more , we see informational and economical aggression from the west , - it 's not our initiative , but that 's how we get to cold-war ii . 
   absolutely always are others to blame . 
  that 's not entirely true , you keep making generalisations . 
  of course , i ca n't speak for entire russian population , but a lot of people are [ criticizes ] ( https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcrlqhli80dwb_peiv5uwo2rsbkya2hei_ynkz78co_5uymi-g103w ) current government . 
   if you believe all the shit that 's feeded to you by kremlin 's media , that 's your problem can you allow idea , that i 'm not even pro-kremlin and i do n't use state media as the source of information ? 
   the response for invasion of ukraine was necessary . 
  that 's right , eu population should condemn coup and color revolution in a rift of political tectonic plates . 
   if you ca n't stand that you actually must not invade neighbours we do n't distinguish political and military invasion . 
   we really ca n't get along . 
  ever . 
  or you will become ` kurds ' . 
  i might be missing something , but how exactly russia threaten poland ? 
   you simply assume all msm is lying and corrupt not that simple , but you right about our general idea : every media has it 's owner . 
   that way you can cherry pick facts to your liking . 
  sure , everybody affected by confirmation biass . 
  however , approach ` everybody tries to fool me ' helps to get complete picture . 
  for example , rt does n't even try to hide their bias , but they do report what western media ommits , for that reason you should be angry about rt-ban in this sub . 
   russian people are seeing only putin controlled tv anyway nope , i 've cutted my tv-cable more than 10 years ago , we do n't trust our media outlets as you was told . 
   putin has the ability to turn on or off the sentiment about `` russophobia '' no matter what the west actually does . 
  you 're trying to deny our intelligence , i do n't see reason to do so . 
   putin of course took all the credit he indeed deserves credit for creating right conditions for transition from 90s . 
   when their refrigerators are empty then the tv praising putin and active hostility to the rest of the world loses a lot of it 's power but russians lives better than ever before , what have changed for us recentrly - we lost our trust to eu , and it 's up to you folks , to gain it back edit : you should focus less on darkest one . 
  to be honest , i 've stopped reading on ` russian invasion of georgia ' , - it seems that article addressed to fishes with no memory at all . 
  those people prefer to refuse simple idea , that usa not only does n't care about eurasia , but put a lot of effort in order to destabilize our region . 
  numerous times hackers from russia and other countries , alogside with whistleblowers from usa , revealed whole picture . 
  but it seems that even plain fuck eu is n't enough . 
  which costs money and also requires medical examinations . 
  of course , such permission is prerequisite for better work positions and servers as possible tramplin in acquiring citizienship . 
  russian flag leftside also [ triggers ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4zt5v7/heartbreaking_picture_of_dog_who_wont_leave/d6yp89n ) pavlovian reaction . 
  do n't know why ` locals ' does n't consider it as an issue . 
   russia 25 years ago ( not ussr ! ), 
  produced more grain than russia ** now **  ** now ** russia imports more ** meat **, 
  yeah , sherlock , harvest varies from year to year , that 's why i gave you [ link ] ( http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/doc_2015/selhoz15.pdf ) with the additional statistics . 
  please be kind to follow right to the page 81 , and expand it with information for the year 2015 , which i also gave you . 
  do n't know why guy get downvoted , its indeed dutch disease . 
  we plan to survive possible shifts during global warming and overpopulation , excessive military spendings intend to make as less desirable target during happy xxi century . 
  i meant , do the [ fact ] ( http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/doc_2015/selhoz15.pdf ) [ checking ] ( http://prozerno.ru/index.php/novosti/229-rosstat-utochnil-dannye-po-sboru-zerna-v-rf-v-2015-g-do-104-8-mln-t ) yourself  now russia imports more meat , but exports grain . 
  and do n't spread [ l ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/agriculture/?country=ru&amp;commodity=beef-and-veal-meat&amp;graph=imports ) - [ i ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/agriculture/?country=ru&amp;commodity=broiler-meat&amp;graph=imports ) - [ e ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/agriculture/?country=ru&amp;commodity=swine-meat&amp;graph=imports ), 
  everything [ is fine ] ( https://professorsblogg.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/carl-bildt-twitter-odessa-pro-russian-thugs.png?w=700 ) , they were [ subhumans ] ( https://static.life.ru/posts/2014/6/135062/994a508e33d156fb2e90670b30790d98__980x.jpg ) after all, 
  [ coughs ] ( https://www.stratfor.com/sites/default/files/styles/stratfor_large__s_/public/styles/stratfor_large__s_/public/main/images/russia-nuclear-power-deals-graphic.png?itok=a0cnd_zn ), 
  that 's true , domestic demand on ssj is artificial , but so was demand on huawei equipment in china . 
  i do n't expect such success for ssj , but due too current cis countries currency fall , ssj potencialy can expand to kazahstan , belarus and armenia, 
  that 's right folks , space industry is where quality does n't matter, 
  suspiciously repeating pattern is a desperate searching for the russian track in growing number of journalist 's deaths/missings in ukraine . 
  worth to mention , that graph also misses [ military gear export ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defense_industry_of_russia#exports ) which is obviously high-tech, 
   russia 25 years ago ( not ussr ! ), 
  produced more wheat than russia now [ false ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/agriculture/?country=ru&amp;commodity=wheat&amp;graph=production )  now russia imports more meat , but exports grain . 
  it seems , that [ beef ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/agriculture/?country=ru&amp;commodity=beef-and-veal-meat&amp;graph=production ) production reduced dramaticaly , but [ poultry ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/agriculture/?country=ru&amp;commodity=broiler-meat&amp;graph=production ) and [ pork ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/agriculture/?country=ru&amp;commodity=swine-meat&amp;graph=production ) rises . 
  do n't make others check facts for you, 
  but you do n't oppouse me at all , just keep throwing insults without a discussion . 
  i just ca n't imagine how natural selection / evolution can go without shaping digestive system . 
  ability to digest food better gives you evolutionary advantage is n't it true ? 
  edit : oh i see , you became smart at / r/gaming and / r/anime ( =, 
   everything about humans puts us well into predator category .
