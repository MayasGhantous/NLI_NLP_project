  so you think that your nails and teeth as good as tiger 's / woolf 's / lion 's in killing mammals ? 
  dare to explain why predators sees less colors than humans ? 
   humans did n't evolve from monkeys , humans and monkeys both evolved from the same ancestor species . 
  we ca n't put as many steps as you desire , it does n't change the fact , that our meat consumption increased dramaticaly in xx century , and we consume too many red meat . 
   also snide insults to everyone who does n't agree with you sorry mate , too much coffeine , which is also bad for you ( =, 
  that 's not what i 've [ said ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/straw_man ) . 
  imagine group of monkeys with typical diet as linear combination of ** ex ** * ** ax ** , where ** ex ** - is efficiency in digesting food type ** x ** , and ** ax ** - is amount of available food type ** x ** . 
  in this case , total efficiency in food consumption , which correspond to ability to spread genes , would be equal to sum of ( ** ex * ax ** ) by ** x ** . 
  random mutations affects ** ex ** , but each ** ex ** multiplied by ** ax ** , so it 's more desirable to increase digestive efficiency for most available food type . 
  due too the fact , that we 've invented livestock/refrigerators just recently , our digestive system has better ** ex ** coefficients for croups and [ vegetables ] ( https://science6antoniohernandez.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/piramide.jpg?w=487 ) . 
   what has any of those claims got to do with animal ethics ? 
  well , we eat excessive amount of meat that 's not good for our health and guess what - meat does n't grows on a trees  you 've jumped from claims about pre-argiculture human diet , with no grounds by the way it seems that my color vision usefull to identify fruits ripeness ; my teeth and nails useless in hunting , but ok to clean banana or pistachio . 
  and i 've learned that we are evolved from monkeys . 
  is it solid arguments for you ? 
  i know that at certain point of evolution meat helped us to gain more energy in a time unit , however , it does n't mean that our hairy anchestors were eating meat three times a day . 
   to global warming yeah , unhealthy excessive meat consumption leads to global warming , there are even claims , that beef production contributes more than cars . 
  i hope you 're able to connect the dots here . 
   honestly no idea what your post is about . 
  yeah , i 've noticed that in / r/europe it 's hard to reach people on scientific and politics related topics . 
  it 's exactly how it works : the one who can better digests typical diet gains more benefit from same amount of food and that gives him/her evolutional advantage . 
  mutations with better efficiency in consuming ** typical ** food spread among the population , while efficiency in consuming ** non-typical ** doesnt play a role . 
  so we evolutionary shaped to consume more vegetables ( guess why they are considered healty food ) and less meat . 
  i think it depends on where you live : cats better fits to big cities , because they do n't need to go outside as often as dogs . 
  also , it 's very convinient that cats can go to the toilet wihout your help ( = what makes me a cat-person , is that cats do n't have pack 's subordination like dogs do . 
  it makes them nearly [ impossible to train ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auhxg1h0baq ) , but if cat comes to you for a weasel , you can be sure it 's honest interest and not some obedience thing . 
  edit : it seems that i 'm biassed towards dogs , awful that it could be caused by [ parasites ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toxoplasmosis ) - tell ya to balance the cat-dog scales ( =, 
  still we have heavy meat oriented diet . 
  i 'm not dietologist , but common sense dictates that evolution shaped our digestive system for less meat consumption - thousands of generations did n't have such an easy access to beef/pork/chicken . 
  yeah , we consume more but for only like hundred of generasions and with less rigorous selection . 
  by the way , a lot of serious scientists point on a fact , that during cows livestock cycle a lot of methane being produces , and methane is way more dangerous than co2 in global warming issue . 
  it turns out , that we destroy millions of lives to entertain our dopamine receptors ( meat is delicious , right ? 
  ) , and that spoils our body and our planet . 
  but fuck this , let 's fight with cannabis !, 
  i 'm not some sort of vegan , but i find it 's very disgraceful how we are acting with animals , and constatly prefer to pretend , that animals has no consciousness or feelings [ )  ( http://i.imgur.com/zicmoib.gif ), 
  it 's hard to reach you , people . 
  you keep repeating same memes that were introduced ( by talented people ) to you by propagandist and refuse to research what those battalions are actually doing . 
  repulse russian army in crimea by burning people in odessa is the same approach as fighting with bolsheviks by sawing ( no shit , do n't google it ) polish children . 
  that 's a big shame , and you ( westeners ) are helping ukrainians to dive even deeper in this disgrace by letting them glorify upa . 
  and these people complain about russian 's obsession with ` whatabout ' argument ... key moment here , is that kiev not only refused to condemn nazi and take weapons from them , but actually gave them more weapons and authority . 
  what could possibly goes [ wrong ] ( http://usnewsparadigm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/civilians-killed-in-lugansk-by-american-supported-junta.jpg ) in [ already polarized ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/%d0%94%d1%80%d1%83%d0%b3%d0%b8%d0%b9_%d1%82%d1%83%d1%80_2010_%d0%bf%d0%be_%d0%be%d0%ba%d1%80%d1%83%d0%b3%d0%b0%d1%85-en.png ) country screwed with the coup , if nazi has weapons and support from the government ? 
  sure , i do n't want to expand topic with ` history ' of how black sea and the caucasus mountains were appeared , but let 's say that there are a lot of history rewritting in ukraine . 
  what 's bothers me a lot , is that history books there paints russians not as closest people , but as the enemy in holy war which last like thousand years . 
   half of worlds skinheads live in your country who measured it ? 
  why it does n't correspond to what i actually see on a streets ? 
   we 're not even talking about russia 's authoritianism that 's right , we are talking about highly offensive new uniform of ukrainian army . 
   because he has already came from russia as a popular leader of multinational country , you sure ? 
   and even if you lose your loyalty to putin who told you , that i 'm loyal to putin ? 
  this assumption is a result of primitive black-and-white logic , fellow . 
   you would get beaten and thrown into jail i had participated in 2014 protests and did n't get to the jail ... what is wrong with my russia ? 
   and yet you sarcastically complain about ukraine . 
  because people simply unaware about what 's going on in this country because of insane censorship in western media space . 
   i ca n't comprehend how one can live in such paradox paradox is when your country is fighting with russian army for two years and yet ask for discounts and trade preferences from it . 
  when you terrorise your fellow citizens and expect loyality from them.when you call your neighbors sub-humans and yet your women vote for them . 
  so you never heard of [ azov battalion ] ( http://europe.newsweek.com/evidence-war-crimes-committed-ukrainian-nationalist-volunteers-grows-269604?rm=eu ) ? 
  oh , it 's a [ brave ] ( http://stuki-druki.com/news/images/ukrainskie-marodery.jpg ) men , who fight [ with russian army ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahwhqj8g7bk ) in east of ukraine . 
  edit : if you are realy not aware , i strongly suggest you italian documentary `` masks of revolution '' , - this film get censored all over the europe , however , not big deal to find it in the internet . 
  outside of cliche and stamps , issue with nazi has the country where those nazi carries weapon on legal basis , and where is common to say hello as : `` glory to the nation !, 
  glory to the heroes '', 
  decreased tensions with russia , increased sovereignty and peace for middle east - it 's all very undemocratic , i think that orban might be putin 's trojan horse . 
  outside of echo chamber there is turkey invading syria in order to beat ppk and isis . 
  why it should be ` excuse ' for turks , but no the ` revenge ' from kurds ? 
  i do n't know much about middle east , but even i know , that kurdish terrorists always choose government structures as their target . 
  first of all , i was very upset about how debates on russian tv looks like . 
  debate 's host allow interruptions during opponents speeches and it looks like that format of the ` show ' is following - bring one anti-kremlin guy in company of pro-kremlin ( host included ) folks . 
  everyone shitting on kasyanov because he simply lies about the [ current spendings ] ( https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=itf_inv-mtn_data ) on transport infrastructure in russia . 
  and what is more important , people remembers kasyanov as corrupt minister ( his nickname was ` misha - 2 % ' and ' 2 % ' - is a amount of his typical bribe ) . 
  more than that , fsb recorded a video in which kasyanov cheats on his wife and calls his supporters `` stupid minions '' during proccess . 
  also , vast majority of people in russia supports crimean 's accession , while kasyanov declares that we should give it back to ukraine , like crimeans some sort of thing . 
  so , kasyanov antipopular in russia , as polls shows , all anti-kremlin political parties wo n't pass 1 % mark . 
  nemtsov was also very unpopular and he also was a victim of fsb 's survey . 
  such opposition is very profitable for kremlin , and so was nemtsov . 
  in case of tragedy , kasyanov would be portraited in western media as popular politician and even as a worthy rival to putin . 
  in this sense , yes , expect kasyanov to be next nemstov . 
  novayagazeta appears to be anti-kremlin , but from my point of view they have better fact-checking then ngo 's news sources . 
  ca n't say for tv channels , but online sources less affected by censorship . 
  for example , one of the most popular anti-kremlin news outlet is a channel '' \u0414\u043e\u0436\u0434\u044c '' , which happen to be sponsored by `` gazprom '' . 
  so it 's quite probable that information about this events will reach wide auedience in russia . 
  in this case , good that story is covered by ` novayagazeta ' , - i often see links to their site , so it seems they have huge audience, 
  is there any other news source reporting about it ? 
  i 'm asking because news source is politicaly motivated ngo with certain audience , and they link to the other 's ngo site . 
  do n't get me wrong , i also believe that something like this could happen . 
  however , there were a lot of precedents when ngo 's news turn out to be a fake or higly edited story . 
  here is better visualisation , based on [ ukraine 's elections ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/%d0%94%d1%80%d1%83%d0%b3%d0%b8%d0%b9_%d1%82%d1%83%d1%80_2010_%d0%bf%d0%be_%d0%be%d0%ba%d1%80%d1%83%d0%b3%d0%b0%d1%85-en.png ) - gives some insight on why east ukraine did n't accept coup 's results . 
  anyway , i doubt that russia will go for the land where we do n't have massive support . 
  crimean operation went without a single shoot simply because ukraine authority did n't have any legitimacy among local population ( and ukrainian soldiers are not stupid [ to ever fight with russian army ] ( http://gordonua.com/img/article/149/63_tn.jpg ) ) . 
  and even more , '' [ false flag ] ( https://s13.postimg.org/lqchwfzvb/cpm_q_wu_uiaathge.jpg ) '' terror group arest did n't lead to invasion . 
  so in my point of view , poroshenko is fearmongering in purpouse to attract more attention and financial help . 
  that 's huge [ generalisation ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user3303/imageroot/20140901_isolated.jpg ) . 
  which is more than total number of women in berlin these days , but that 's not important for * historical truth *, 
  did you know , that obsessive compulsive disorder , like unhealthy fixation on darkest one , can be caused by high sugar consumption ? 
  i mention it , because i want to protect you from buying chocolate candies from poroshenko 's factories in russia ( =, 
  i like how you ommited that out of 117 international observers there are 76 osce representatives , but wrote :  osce is the only organization providing long term observation , while most observers are invited from ex-ussr edit : who might think that there could be people familiar with both russian language and math ... ( =, 
  well , at least [ poroshenko ] ( https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06kiev1706_a.html ) discuss it , not just blindly do what he was told to do , which is observable upgrade from 2004s coup edit : dear `` non-brothers '' , you 've got to realise , that at the moment your country nowhere near an independed state . 
  i assume some of you expect eu/usa to skyrocket your economy , or maybe that you capable to improve economy in a short term . 
  but in a reality next decades humanity will face giant challenges caused by global warming and resource shortage , in this circumstances kind a naive to expect decent growth . 
  more than that , your country is lead to the debt hole in atmoshpere of aggressive propaganda against russians - all of this is a signature of cynical intentions of foreign governors . 
  sure , at the moment we are affected by propaganda too , but anyway - you will never find someone who loves you like we do [ . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsjlmevdgc0 ), 
  it 's undisputed fact , that even ordinary person was bringed to war as soldier shotrly becomes cruel . 
  i mean , look at syrian civil war - there are yesterday neighbors torturing each other without a sign of mercy .
