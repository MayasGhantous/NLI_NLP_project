  were soviets innocent warriors in shining armor ? 
  - of course they were n't !, 
  however , it 's important to evaluate actual numbers of victims besides emotional stories , as well to remember that current generations have just a little responsibility for their grandfathers . 
  obviously , winner writes the history , but same applies to the cold war . 
  number of soviet victims rise like every year and laughable estimates are accepted without any crytics . 
  for example , noone dare to explain how russia increased population during bloody revolution , holodomor , stalin 's repressions and finaly world war that took dozens of million lives . 
  i encourage not to close eyes on soviet crimes , but be aware of context where it 's discussed . 
  for example , on of the top comment about 1968 anniversary was ' i hate fucking russians ' by slovak guy , who most likely not a piece of soap for nazi feet thanks to soviets, 
  obviously , russian federation has slightly lower standards in freedom of speech , but it does n't necessarily means that european medias are free from propaganda and censoring . 
  it 's quite important to understand , that the main danger of propaganda is [ one-side ] ( http://img.bibo.kz/?7402821.jpg ) coverage , which lead to primitive ` black-n-white ' judgment . 
  that not only decrease complexity of the views , but also a good soil for growing hate to other people . 
  have to agree , but do n't underestimate propaganda influence during these years and modern times . 
  yeah , lots of [ propaganda ] ( http://www.les-crises.fr/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/poll-france-nations-contribution-nazis-defeat-1.jpg ) and [ ingratitude ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost#phases_of_the_plan_and_its_implementation ) . 
  i ca n't describe how offensive this shit is . 
  edit : worth to add - unlike chinese who dislike japs , or balts who dislike russians , we do n't have any hard feelings to germans . 
  sure , my comment mostly based on two years old experience , however , i 've expanded it with explanation about current crimeans feeling . 
  i 've to note , that / r/europe has insane level of brigading and biass : you blindly believe to one-sided media report if it match your biass and do n't even try to accept what russians are writing . 
  from my point of view , you have to listen to both sides , check the facts and then think for yourself . 
  for example , in article and from ukrainian brigade you received information , that there are just a little number of tourists or even none of them . 
  however , is n't it easy to check flight radar or crimean airport [ site ] ( http://sipaero.ru/ ) ? 
  in reality , there are indeed a little bit less tourist , now they comes not only at summer , but all year long ( patriotic and curiosity reasons ) , and carries more money ( russian 2-3 times richer that ukrainians ) . 
  that lead to major rebuild in tourist industry , main change is that now more comfort and service required by tourists . 
  and yeah , do n't know why , but you missed main point of my post - ukraine and eu/usa ( additional sanctions on crimeans ) secured propaganda win for kremlin in peninsula . 
  wise westeners and ukrainians should ask themselfs - is their governments stupid to lose it that badly , or maybe noone believed that crimea is n't lost cause from the 2014 ? 
  oh c'mon , it 's almost pavlovian reaction : see russian flag - write ` annexed ' and ` invasion ' the fact that russia is in proxy war does n't necessarily mean , that ukraine authority has no profit from it . 
  i 'm sure west media does n't focus on problems inside ukraine , but in reality people there suffering even more than crimeans . 
  besides obvious propaganda reasons ( you eat less because of russia and our incompetence has nothing to do with this ) , kiev also needs to keep ultra-right batalions busy . 
   creates aggressive chauvinistic people we can see everywhere among russian minority so far it 's ukrainians shelling cities with russian majority , not the otherwise . 
  i suggest you to become a famous writer ( =, 
  sure thing , every media has it 's own agenda , biass and ** owner **  i think the more reasonable explanation is that you ca n't bear to see the news that disagrees with your worldview . 
  i can say same about your reaction on my comment , which is based on eyewitness . 
   the tourists are gone that 's popular myth in ukrainian segment of the network . 
  in reality number of tourist indeed decreased , however average income per tourist rised . 
  also , good thing is that tourists now arrives all year long , not just in summer . 
  try to find working online cameras in peninsula . 
   ukrainian water/electricity are gone it caused huge rage in crimea , but object of hate is ukrainians . 
  i honestly do n't understand how it was intended to work from point of view of ukrainians . 
  now russian authority has finished construction of so-called energy bridge ( [ here ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%ad%d0%bd%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b3%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82_%d0%b2_%d0%9a%d1%80%d1%8b%d0%bc ) , you can read about it on language that we both know )  salaries have stayed the same and prices are sky-high it depends on areas , however , i would agree that prices went up dramatically . 
  salarys/pensions also increased , but certainly behind rising of the prices . 
  main reason , of course , is a food blockade conducted for the goals that can not be explained by the logic of a healthy person . 
  at least i 'm sure it 's not only harms crimean 's view on ukraine , but also negatively affect southern regions of ukraine . 
   even for food items , which is the main article of spending for russians that 's true , however , we still enjoy ` above africa ' level of consumption  just look at regular [ income ] ( http://russia.trud.com/companies/roshen/ ) of russians who works on poroshenko 's factories, 
  incredibly sad fact is that it would improve the lives of all the southern regions of ukraine . 
  on the other hand , in the absence of a clear image of the aggressor ( and main trade visa-free partner at the same time ) it 's unlikely to be able to keep such a polarized country from collapse . 
  edit : that 's beyond comedy - why you people keep seeing thing as black and white ? 
  is it hard to accept , that kiev also benefits from war ? 
  and once again - it works both ways . 
  american military complex needs clients alongside with the reason for wealthy customers to spend their money on weapon . 
  situation could look like assymetrical , however there are a lot of things that benefits usa from turkey , like geography or agreement on preventing china financial expansion, 
  fair enough , literally all sides there has instruments of pressure on counterparts . 
  but it seems that usa went to far with supporting of kurds military groups - both gear and media coverage . 
  erdo no way stupid as western media tries to paint him , he knows that kurds federation/state could be used against turkey when needed . 
  that means ` dear usa , while we know that it was you behind the coup , please give us that innocent bastard so we can show to uneducated part of the society our growing strength , just like we did by shooting down russian airplane ... other way , we will continue to improve relationships with russia , and you do n't want that ' edit : and sure , russians will never share the base with a hostile alliance, 
  reuters news about russia has same [ cr ] ( http://www.oddee.com/_media/imgs/articles2/a96803_a502_georgians-reuters.jpg ) ed [ it ] ( http://www.oddee.com/_media/imgs/articles2/a96803_a502_georgians-reuters2.jpg ) abi [ ty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adnan_hajj_photographs_controversy ) as rt 's news on same topic . 
  it is difficult to argue that life has not improved for crimeans as they expected , however , they are [ quite happy ] ( https://www.quora.com/2015-russia-ukraine-conflict-do-people-in-crimea-regret-their-decision-to-be-a-part-of-russia ) to run away from ukraine . 
  please note , that ukraininan tv channels are n't banned in crimea , and , in some way , it was brilliant propaganda move from kremlin . 
  as a network engineer and * invasion unit * , i was in crimea shortly after referendum and can expand topic a little bit . 
  my task was to take part in deploying banking infrastructure , because ukrainian banks left peninsula with people 's deposits , and russian banks were about to leave in order to dodge sanctions . 
  that situation caused huge crowds near rf banks , because people were not sure if they would save their savings ... for my personal pride , they did get money back from sberbank , vtb and so on ( and even small compensation for stolen money from rf ) another big problem was about unprecedented unemployment rate caused by sanction-dodgers and ukrainian law , which forced business to leave peninsula . 
  also , people were suffering from countless bureaucratic procedures , you guys ca n't imagine queue for russian [ passports ] ( https://nahnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/8111.jpg ) . 
  i guess everybody knows , that during 2015 poor crimeans suffered from food and energy blockade which were set in order to change the mood of the crimean people ... it did work opposite way . 
  same applies to western sanctions on crimeans - yes , it hurts , but also strengthening their hate to west and ukraine . 
  main problem for them now is high goods cost , but i hope it will be solved with the [ bridge ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxttxk5jlce ) construction . 
  their current mood became even more pro-russian , source : crimean tatar girlfriend ( she was born in moscow , and yes , i oppress her from time to time , but only if she asks me to do so ), 
  obviously internal market protection should be limited in order to maintain proper competition . 
  however , russian food market was like two heads bellow european , and for that reason , was not capable to develop . 
  think about it this way : if you play among good players you improove your skill , but only if you can match their skill . 
  7 years old soccer child player would n't benefit from competing with mature professionals , he needs to play with contemporarys or just a little more old folks ( greetings to most european country ever ) now i also observe slow improvement in our food market , which was impossible just a few years before . 
  and other good news , some food producers have moved part of their production power to russia, 
  or it could be horrible bacteria from lake balathon , which control your body and mysteriously force you to practice water polo and eat hungarian version of pizza . 
  have to agree , i guess it comes from really ** explosive ** taste, 
  in this case , shortly before their utilization ` freedom fighters ' recorded video with a statement of loyality to is . 
  edit : but yeah , i would agree - is becomes something like franchise and every city can has own mac-jihad branch, 
  attentive latvians will be able to find horrible mistake of the 90s in this [ link ] ( http://stats.ioinformatics.org/halloffame/lva ), 
  shortly after student 's [ programming contest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acm_international_collegiate_programming_contest ) russians were joking about this [ pic ] ( https://v1.std3.ru/a0/e0/1463827834-a0e0752180c8937160a57bbc52843367.jpeg ) - guess which team is from usa, 
  looks great , and in some sort cures cities spoiled with late soviet architecture . 
  prepare for downvoting alongside with illogical explanation how increase in number of gas transit paths violates something besides ukraine 's ability to blackmail russia, 
  let me introduce my kremlin-bot operational mode ( =  nobody 's going to get gulaged over things like associating with non-russians i was refering to your previous comment . 
   if you 're a journalist uncovering things the authorities would rather people not hear according to [ statistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_journalists_killed_in_russia ) , number of killed journalists decreased dramaticaly . 
  as well as overall number of kills in russian federation . 
   a politician holding an unpopular position i do n't have aggregated data on english , but it [ seems ] ( http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/ruwiki/1601495 ) that numbers also decreased and , what is more important , most of killed politicians were pro-kremlin . 
   member of an not-so-loyal opposition party i guess you refer to nemtsov . 
  well , the thing is all opposition politicians became very unpopular right after crimea re-union . 
  not only because of their possition on ukraine/crimea , but also because of fsb-originated leaks . 
  so nemtsov was no where near to be a popular politician in russia . 
   whistleblower exposing corruption and here you refer to magnitsky . 
  i did n't believed government 's position on this case , but recently anti-kremlin journalist made a new investigation and it [ turns out ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb18orsjs7s ) that there are a lot of evidences supporting kremlin 's version . 
   russian intervention in syria did not cause the refugee crisis , but it certainly exacerbated it . 
  it 's [ opposite ] ( http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/maps/syria%20conflict/3-yr-growth-syrian-refugees-europe-final-web-624x306.jpg )  constantly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries is very good advice as well as to remember who interfered first . 
   btw , congratulations on your engagement !, 
  thanks !, 
  now i oppress crimean tatars even more . 
  lizard people are preventing us from knowing it, 
  crimeans are one of us , we have no morale ground to left them alone as we did in [ 90 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_sovereignty_referendum,_1991 ) - [ s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_referendum,_1994 ) . 
  good when you have non-racist proper functional soul and brains, 
  well , i glad to inform you that during my last * vacation * in hungary i made a marriage proposal to non-russian girl . 
  for some reason we are n't gulaged yet . 
  although i agree that russian state media uses usa as boogie man , it would be unfair not to admit , that usa constantly interfere in the internal affairs of other countries . 
  i even think that europeans have started to realise , that refugee crisis caused not by russian intervention in syria, 
  recent [ nekrasov 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrei_nekrasov ) [ documentary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmypbo6kw1k ) about magnitskiy went not as [ expected ] ( http://en.news-4-u.ru/in-the-european-parliament-the-scandal-has-canceled-the-premiere-of-the-film-about-sergei-magnitsky.html ) ( =,
