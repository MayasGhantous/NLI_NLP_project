  think about it this way - some sort of revolution should happen on 17 million square kilometers , several climate zones , among dozen of various nations and current believes/values of the russians . 
  not to mension migrant workers from ex-ussr countries , there are 10 mln of them in russian federation . 
  obviously , revolution in minds would n't affect every group , so some sort of instability could be reach . 
  that 's scary , considering consistent effort of the usa to destabilise our region ( including spread of pre-coup propaganda ), 
  sure thing - base is leased for the duration of syrian civil war , but you missing the point . 
  while russian military situated in iran and syria , usa unable to bring ` freedom ' and ` democracy ' to these places , and that 's something new what we did n't see since the fall of soviet union . 
  obviously , it 's sign of growing strength , not the opposite, 
  and what makes you think that vast majority of russians bellieved in these numbers ? 
  key point , is that shortly after the coup , georgia has started war by shelling civilians and peacekeepers in osetia , and western media spined it as russian [ agg ] ( http://www.oddee.com/_media/imgs/articles2/a96803_a502_georgians-reuters2.jpg ) ress [ ion ] ( http://www.oddee.com/_media/imgs/articles2/a96803_a502_georgians-reuters.jpg ) . 
  that 's exactly what i 'm talking about - after recovery from communism we are aware of propaganda , while you guys blindly bellieve that your media is free ( because your media told you so ) . 
  i clearly remember media coverage during georgian war : filmed georgian mlrs presented as russian , destruction in tskhinvali ( osetia ) presented as destruction in georgian gori , georgian tank shooting on houses also presented as russian . 
  osetians get they mouth [ shuted ] ( http://video.foxnews.com/v/3911776/just-so-scary/?#sp=show-clips ) . 
  considering unity among western sources of information these days , i tend to bellieve that such coverage was planed . 
  westeners have to realise , that russians not that naive and receptive to propaganda - it 's opposite , we are aware of what media saying and do n't trust government blindly . 
  so the recent raise in putin 's approval raiting inside russia caused not by ` our propaganda ' , but by ` yours ', 
  people get used to higher consumption rates , so they have lifted demands to the government . 
  from my personal observations , various social services become more available and transparent : for example , i 've successfully sued domestic services company thanks to data obtained from government sites ( it 's about fraud in bill for heating ) . 
  russia indeed distanced itself from ` the west ' , but it 's definetly not our initiative . 
  from my perspective , ` the west ' have started informational war against my country . 
  please note , i 'm not pushing that ` russia in innocent ' , - it 's as distant from truth as the ` russia is evil ', 
  well , to be honest some economy branches were sanctioned , like military and banking . 
  not to mention , that if bussiness/company of certain person get sanctioned , it affects people who works in this company . 
  my consumption decreased in quality , i 've to admit , that european foods has better quality . 
  however , i agree to decrease my comfort/consumption in order to allow crimea to run away from ukraine . 
  that 's a good point too - i can get why certain europeans does n't understand how badly revolution in russia could end . 
  in best case it would cause flooding of refugees alongside with increased tension all over the eastern europe , for the worst case scenario save as many bottle caps as possible . 
  i want to add , that besides media bitching about how bad rf is , we are slowly moving to the right direction . 
  slower than we should , however there are plenty of reasons why we are lagging , - main reason , in my point of view , is a huge size of the country and influence from the previous generations . 
  we need an evolution , not the revolution , which is dangerous for a such huge country, 
  ` there are jets that are using iranian base , but they ca n't use it as it 's actual base ' - did i get it correct ? 
  you ironically confirming what i 'm saying , or actually opposed to it ? 
  actually , that 's how it works . 
  we ( primates ) have the rewarding mechanism for doing what other primates in our group are doing . 
  that 's why [ bandwagon effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bandwagon_effect ) exist . 
  after accepting some position , we keep [ defending ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confirmation_bias ) it , - just like right here and right now . 
  i think , that described scheme adopted by governments long ago , and honestly do n't understand why you think it 's some sort of conspiracy , while there are so many evidences :0 edit : forget to add , that deploying bots in informational space can move the scails : it could be you position over crimean crysis , or your position on which coffee machine to buy ( believe me or not , some forum 's feedbacks about coffee machines are fakes , posted by bots ), 
  last person who leaves the country turns off lights in the airport ( c ) but actually , it 's not necessary - to that moment latvia will have cheap electricity . 
  but what if harsh conditions on russian troll factory is artistic exaggeration that better fits to your expectations ? 
  i mean , in these articles we are invited to believe a testimony of uneducated ( considering job role ) person . 
  what a huge disappointment i am ) =, 
  that 's right , in some sense it 's relies on domino-effect : ` neutral ' guy observes that majority has certain opinion and starts to follow this opinion with growing confirmation biass , but he could be unaware that those ` majority ' mainly consist of paid trolls or guys like him ( with artificial biass ), 
  that 's so true . 
  personaly , i prefer hockey matches over football because of football hooligans , who sometimes manage to spoil good atmosphere of hockey arena, 
  i ca n't find where i was protecting hooligans , just mentioned that ' i would beat someone ' in the internet looks funny . 
  however , you managed to bring politics in this . 
  well , just notice that person who is ` waving fists ' in his chair looks comical ( at least for me ), 
  you would shown them , right ? 
  troll factories indeed exist , however , it 's important to understand , that ` putin-bot ' memo inducted to west informational field with overvalued estimates and certain propaganda purpose . 
  if i would try to reveal some documents about magnitskiy case , i would be labeled as ` bot ' , who does n't deserve to be listened . 
  and that 's independent from what i actually wrote, 
  moscow was so [ eco-friendly ] ( https://m.vk.com/doc14422233_437765293?hash=8bb1c38345bdef15ea&amp;dl=469d6b7891900196dc ) yesterday ( =, 
  good news everyone - stolen land already given back , and [ people are happy about it ] ( https://www.quora.com/2015-russia-ukraine-conflict-do-people-in-crimea-regret-their-decision-to-be-a-part-of-russia ), 
  so far ukrainian authority adding political twist to the story behind the picture . 
  likely for us , those people inside ukr goverment does n't have massive [ support ] ( http://www.gallup.com/poll/187931/ukrainians-disillusioned-leadership.aspx ) among population , so things will eventualy back to normal, 
  spoiler alert : color revolution causes deaths among young men and losses in territory . 
  we would be very thankfull if west would stop applying soft power on our neighbors . 
  simply because in a world of growing demand and limited resourses you could easily become a little bit nervous , if power justifying nuclear bombing slowly creeping to your borders . 
  sure , i was sarcastic . 
  in fact , average price for square meter in moscow would be something in range of 100-200k rubles , which is about 1400-1800 euro . 
  considering average salary in moscow and bank 's interest rate , appartments seems to be unaffordable for most moscovites, 
  with just a liiiitle help of their media , western people chewed ` russia causes refugee crysis ' , so it 's not a big surprise that whole mess in ukraine presented as russian agression, 
  deploy more nato troops nearby russian border , i thought it 's obvious solution, 
  yeah , someday we 'll [ admit ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/26/russian-parliament-guilt-katyn-massacre ) crimes against poles, 
  well , i guess [ documents ] ( http://militera.lib.ru/research/0/pdf/lostxeno.pdf ) collected by russians during ww-ii also would n't fit , right ? 
  unfortunately in case of upa it 's very well documented . 
  do n't know why you ( i mean ukrainians ) glorify those bastards, 
  yeah , i heard that level of [ poverty ] ( https://realty.yandex.ru/newbuilding/72501 ) caused by brexit ( =, 
  what if i told you that reddit - is mainstream western media ? 
  actually , russia media links his dead with his inverstigations on [ odessa port factory ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9e%d0%b4%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%b9_%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b8%d0%bf%d0%be%d1%80%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b2%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d0%b7%d0%b0%d0%b2%d0%be%d0%b4 ) . 
  also , in russian media and blogs circulates idea , that olena prytula was original target, 
  the fact that western media pushes conspiracy theory about staged coup sort of confirmation who is responsible, 
  maybe that 's why axe-man was angry ? 
  well , jokes aside i have to agree that it 's rude to generalize all muslims . 
  arabic welcome on [ dresden ] ( http://huckcdn.lwlies.com/admin/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/dresden-train-credit-jenan-moussa-twitter-2.jpg ) train, 
  what if i told you that purpose of minsk agreement is not to bash russia ( which is not even a subject of agreement ) in media , but to implement peace and restore normal life in the regions under ukrainian flag ? 
  please be kind to read the [ agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minsk_ii ) . 
  btw , did you read eu association agreement ? 
  you suggest to cordon territory with ukrainian citizens , not to rescue them from evil ruskies, 
   just cordon them off and let them be miserable and drain russian monies . 
  actually , ukraine goverment has cut off all social welfare to luhansk and donetsk regions , including pensions for old folks , who 've been working in ukraine whole life . 
  besides , from you it almost sound like there is [ civil war ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iem14b6t0po ) in ukraine , not the fight against russian [ terrorists ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvydr0svg_k ), 
  prepare to be brigaded , truth like this should not be revealed here, 
  there is link in this article to acra 's ( rating agency ) research on the issue : - the shift in demand in favor of cheaper durable goods began in 2011 , in the segment food products - in 2013 . 
  the main cause of it was the end of the steady growth in real disposable incomes - consumer demand shifts to lower-cost categories of goods ( housing , clothing , footwear ) - since 2011 , there is steady growth in number of cars , but also in their average age - single-room apartments becomes more popular same applies to the vacations , people now prefer domestic tourism for financial reasons, 
  from logical point of view , increase in propaganda actually means opposite - we are becoming stronger . 
  and do n't fool yourself , recent coups and failed invasion in syria made you look less attractive and reliable in world leader 's eyes, 
  it 's common approach : regime-critical and pro-west are educated and smart , but everyone who opposed them are dumb peasants . 
  important part of this agenda is cartoon-like villain , who must be replaced and this will change everything in country without bloody civil war , but with insane economical growth, 
  thanks indeed , russians simply not ready to warmly welcome homosexuality , same actually applies to other slavic people . 
  shift in public opinion should n't be revolutionary , but smooth - generation after generation . 
  i do n't think that anybody laughs , some people may look cynical , but i does n't mean they cheers . 
  once again , people should accept decline in freedom , vote for suitable leader . 
  personaly i 'll be happy , if french people would ask themself is it my country who caused refugee crysis . 
  unfortuately , what they have to do is to accept more surveillance and some drawback in freedoms . 
  there is also suggested option to tolerate, 
  where is ' [ prison ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_gay_propaganda_law ) ' [ lie ] ( http://www.travelgayeurope.com/gay-map-of-moscow/ ) comes from ? 
  i hope not all europeans are so confiding , because other way their opinion can be manipulated let 's say with the single drawn baby image, 
  that should work even better than walking through the street while holding hands of each other, 
  there are : hundres died , combat airplanes shooting down helicopters , president 's bodyguards killed , goverment and military cleaning is on process ... 
  i do n't think that in such circumstances visa-free travel is important for vast majority of turks , and i more than sure that such statements from brussels ( and other nato partners ) does n't stabilise situation , completely opposite actually,
