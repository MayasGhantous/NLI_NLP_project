   after he became laboratory director , and in furtherance of his responsibility to improve russian sport performance by covering up doping , dr. rodchenkov developed a steroid cocktail optimized to avoid detection . 
  initially , that cocktail consisted of oral turinabol ( dehydrochloromethyl-testosterone ) , oxandrolone and methasterone . 
  the steroids were dissolved in alcohol ( chivas for the men 50 and vermouth for the women ) . 
  the solution was then swished in the mouth in order to be absorbed by the bucal membrane and then spit out . 
  dr. rodchenkov 's research indicated that , with the laboratory technology available at the time , the detection window for the steroids in the cocktail would not exceed 3-5 days . 
   the swapping occurred largely as described in the new york times article . 
  dr. rodchenkov provided ** credible evidence ** that the a and b bottles would pass through the `` mouse hole '' from the aliquoting room inside the secure perimeter of the sochi laboratory into an adjacent operations room , outside the secure perimeter . 
  from there , fsb officer evgeny blokhin would take the b bottles and leave the operations room . 
  in the meantime , clean urine from the athletes who had given their sample at a sochi doping control venue would be withdrawn from the freezer at the fsb building and brought over to the operations room to complete its thawing there . 
  the b sample bottle would be returned to the operations room by fsb blokhin , open and with the cap removed . 
  the dirty urine disposed of and replaced by clean urine would be put in the a and b bottles . 
  the stopper replaced in the a bottle and the b bottle cap screwed back into place ; the bottles would be passed back through the mouse hole thereby reentering the secure perimeter of the laboratory aliquoting room ready for clinical bench work the following morning . 
  what else do you need , huh ? 
  too bad you did n't tell me about your ` putin ' issue at the beginning of conversation ( =, 
  i know , if usa was behind this , we would see certaint information environment ( i.e. 
  bashing erdo and turks , while praising kurds ) before coup . 
  and , what is more important , usa immediatly condemned coup , not after it has failed . 
  wait a second ... 
  it could be heartbreaking , but : - syngas nowhere near as energy efficient as water-pumping storage plants . 
  - geographically spread infrastructure means huge losses in wires . 
  indeed , lack of proper terrain for hydropower is a reason to use other methods for energy storage , but syngas emerged not yesterday - engineers and economists had enough of time to decide would it be efficient to place more gas synthesis plants . 
  well , yeah i agree - electrolysis does n't require huge amount of heat , but the electicity . 
  anyway , it 's look like an experiment ( and a lack of [ storage ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pumped-storage_hydroelectricity ) plants ) rather than strong commercial use . 
  well , good luck with that, 
  balodis - balov ozoli\u0146\u0161 - ozolov godmanis - godov sound good and not offending , [ right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deniss_ivanovs ) ? 
  it 's valid point for me and i also realise that those parades serves as source of propaganda for russian state . 
  i do n't watch tv-news for like 10 years , but i remember ` bad latvians honors nazi ' report from state channel - most likely annual thing ( = but !, 
  segregation and boogeyman are the tool extensively used by both sides - it 's huge issue when ` bad guys ' are people who live in your country and they made up 30 % of population in your country . 
  so the point is - you should n't pick up disputable persons to honor . 
  there are a lot of people who contributed to baltic states independence , but for some reason you pick guys who were fighting alongside with nazi . 
  i think i explain too much , but once again : lots of people were born during 80s , they learned russian as main language and suddenly became out of the law . 
  so now they ` translate ' their family names ( what a hell is this ? ), 
  and live in atmospere of hate . 
  best approach is to consider 30 % of latvia and estonia as equal citizens . 
  of course , you also have another option - to expand hate between people and live with constant fear of russian occupation, 
   latvian legion was latvians finding a way to fight against the return of the soviet occupation definetly one side of the [ story ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_holocaust_in_latvia ) . 
  edit : and believe me , i do n't stand for baltic people to say sorry for this . 
  my point is that you do n't responsible for this , however , parades in nazi-uniform a bit too much . 
  [ nope ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/straw_man ) , i suggest to change approach in integration of russian population , one of the good steps would be allow them to call their babies as they want and provide citizen status to everyone who was born before baltic states independence, 
  is it even normal that we discuss ` not-a-citizen ' / ` do n't use your last name ' shit based on people 's loyality and opinions ? 
  sure enough , both sides should be doing steps towards each other , but from my opinion goverment have more tools and power compared to minorirty . 
  for reference , stop honoring [ nazi collaborators ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/remembrance_day_of_the_latvian_legionnaires ) would change russians stance dramaticaly . 
  once again , those people were there before your state , forcing them to learn your language same shit as soviets forcing you to learn russian . 
  find the way to co-exist spoiler : give them more rights , stop honoring nazi-collaborators edit : and yeah , here in land of opression and unjustice , we use multiple official languages in national [ republics ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/%d0%a3%d0%bb%d0%b8%d1%86%d0%b0_%d0%b0%d0%b3%d0%b8%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%bb%d1%8c.jpg ), 
  most of them were living here before states even appeared . 
  so , obviously , approach should n't be that rude, 
  surprised by this question . 
  according to the [ surveys ] ( http://www.levada.ru/en/2016/06/10/russia-s-friends-and-enemies-2/ ) we do n't have anything against them, 
  there is an option to use two languages . 
  ok m8 , let 's assume that russian federation behave very-very bad , what it have to do with russian-speaking population in baltic states o / ? 
   energy demand usually peaks from about 11:00 to 17:00 , or thereabouts , and completely slumps between 23:00 and 06:00 . 
  anyway , most sources of renewable energy are weather-dependent . 
  problem will be solved as soon as humanity will invent better batteries . 
   co-generating is a thing and in fact collecting heat from the sun is ridiculously easy once again - weather dependent . 
  maybe you can name few big metallurgy factories that relies on solar energy ? 
  ( =  no it is n't : exactly because it is n't sustainable . 
  say what ? 
  did n't get your point . 
   last , but not least : there is no reason to replace gas . 
  we can just synthesise it you know what is going to work even better ? 
  do n't heat water , just take water from sources in warm places and take it the europe . 
  of course , you need to freeze it to facilitate transportation . 
  as a russian a can tell you that the only reason why we dislike baltic states is their prejudice towards russian population . 
  it have nothing to do with a envy edit : for reference , it 's prohibited to use russian first and last names in latvia ; russian language is also out of the law , and russian 's do n't even have passports , but use ` not-a-citizen ' documents . 
  do n't know why baltic people ca n't move on and keep fighting soviet state which collapsed long ago . 
  russians do n't feel angry about germans , so someone could have good teachers how to forgive, 
  not quite , and here is why : - wind/solar power gains during day does n't correspond to the demand , i.e. 
  citizens watch tv even after sunset - some industries requires not only huge amount of electricity , but also the heat . 
  same applies to water heating for residents - fossil fuels provides very good ( energy put/energy gain ) ration , which is also important . 
  revelant [ information ] ( http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-g-n/lithuania.aspx ), 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urjhwrcxoiu ) . 
  question arise - why west propaganda sources trying so hard to proove russian mod wrong about ukraine 's buk systems in cto zone ? 
  suddenly , erdo realised , that sovereign kurdistan on pipes crossing was a plan all along . 
  took a lot of time . 
  of course it 's photoshop , ukranian [ army ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urjhwrcxoiu ) does n't need anti-aircraft missile [ systems ] ( http://www.ukrainewar.info/shooting-mh-17-buk-312-story-false-says-ukraine-crew-member/ ) to prevent russians from throwing babies from incubators . 
  besides , if those systems were driving across ukraine , they would be [ caught ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm48vi4tghy ) [ on ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkmream61oi ) [ camera ] ( https://youtu.be/qzkvy5hbsw0 ) , right ? 
  but now there is a law that allows policeman to shoot protesters . 
  in overall situation with human rights in ukraine get worse , for example goverment have prohibited russian tv and movies along with [ communist party ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/%d0%a0%d0%b5%d0%b7%d1%83%d0%bb%d1%8c%d1%82%d0%b0%d1%82%d1%8b_%d0%b2%d1%8b%d0%b1%d0%be%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b2_%d0%b2_%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b4%d1%83%2c%d0%a3%d0%ba%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b0_2014%2c%d0%9a%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%bc%d1%83%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b8%d1%87%d0%b5%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%8f_%d0%bf%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%82%d0%b8%d1%8f.png ) . 
  not to mention lots of political motivated murders . 
  and btw , there are a lot of protest in ukraine , however it wo n't grow to something special without media support ( including very-very free western media ), 
  maybe , just maybe , if you look at the flag , but not on the statement under this flag , you need to have a break ? 
  do n't think there are valuable resourses about russia in english . 
  however , i did n't look up for them , because i completely satisfied with semi-closed communities in russian-speaking internet segment . 
  so once again i would suggest biassed state sponsored sources like rt - at least they show what european outlets does n't . 
  emm ... i 've pointed ( with evidence ) on illegal income for military batallions , not the state/country . 
  does criminals appears from the opposite side ? 
  - of course , civil wars attracts villains . 
  i guess outside of russian-speaking community it 's not very clear that this war is a source of illegal income for worst part of ukraninan society . 
  the main reason why this people goes to so-called volounteer batalions have nothing to do with patriotism ( at least in most cases ) . 
  most ` profit ' now comes from security checkpoints - person who wants to leave rebel controlled area have to pay some bribe . 
  this issue actually related to the fact that ukrainian goverment refuse to pay pensions and other social payments in rebel hold areas . 
  second way to earn money while being a national hero - bribes on major roads that leads to russia ( especialy near crimea ) . 
  truck drivers has no option but to pay some money . 
  last but not least - simple [ rob ] ( https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcrt6_cpsp7jfd90h-vrtd7ibb2mniuqtmfjjq_tsfkaiwzo34si ) b [ ery ] ( https://youtu.be/ekz_pjhxcfe?t=34 ) . 
  edit : funny thing - every time i supply my posts with evidence links , i get downvoted to hell ( =, 
  completely agree - russian state propaganda is very blatant , so a lot of locals trying to avoid television and state-sponsored sources of information . 
  for example , my tv unconnected from the cable network , so i use it only for watching videos from the computer ( and as audio source sometimes ) . 
  ironicaly , russians ( and other peoples of our federation ) are more aware of propaganda due to soviet past and , let 's be honest , due to lack of professionalism among journalists . 
  take a free tip : in order to look unbiassed pick neutral nicknames ( =, 
  actually , presence of ` hostile ' propaganda is a good thing because it helps you to get extensive view on world news and politics .
