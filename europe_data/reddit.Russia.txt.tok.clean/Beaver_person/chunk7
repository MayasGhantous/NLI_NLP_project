  you just have to realise that since wwii governments and sub-national corporations works hard in [ pushing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh8dejyga5a ) their agenda , and for that reason you will never be free from [ domestic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/udo_ulfkotte ) [ propaganda ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iepzoln.jpg ) . 
  concept ` they telling lies , while we are telling only truth ' correlates with human instincts ( segregation ) and social behavior ( ' i have access to better information consumption ' ) . 
  be aware of this so , in my opinion , best way to get insight what 's going on whould be summyrized information from polar sources devided by two . 
  that approach extremly usefull against ` half of the story ' news, 
  so what the particular reason to pick nazi collaborators as national heroes ? 
  as a network engineer i 've visited this business-center multiple times : at first it realy was quite empty , but now it keeps improving both construction site and utilisation rate . 
  anyway , i would say this skyscrapers indeed not a result of rapidly growing economy , it 's more like guy buying big expencive car in order to compensate something ( = as a citizen i would prefer decent work and cash flow to ordinary housing appartments outside of moscow region . 
  some places looks realy depressing ( and keep in mind [ broken window theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/broken_windows_theory ) ) , but more importantly could be a reason for low birth rate - lack of affordable appartments literally stops couples from having babies . 
  this building is a living proof of russian brutality : we also built huge university in moscow during 50s , and guess what - ours is two meters taller, 
   `` rufed should bomb syria even more because it 's good for israel and i 'm jewish '' = hate crime against syrians i 'll correct you , if you do n't mind , - the point of those bloger was : `` i glad russia bombs syria , because it means more deaths among syrians '' . 
  - no , russia is doing what ? 
  it kills women , children and elderly . 
  - and you warmly welcome this ? 
  - of course . 
  they syrians . 
  - well , they are people too . 
  - no , they are syrians . 
  - the syrians are not people ? 
  - in what sense ? 
  they pose a threat to israel . 
  - and the women and children , and the elderly ? 
  - i do not care if they pose a threat to israel . 
  - well , the danger [ are ] the women and children and the elderly ? 
  - women ? 
  they give birth to syrian soldiers . 
  if they are bombed , they will not bear the syrian soldiers . 
  and thank god . 
  [ definitely ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_poland ) not like [ ireland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irish_population_analysis ) . 
   first of all the propaganda spanned generations [ you do n't say ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2g6x7n/which_nation_contributed_most_to_defeating/ ), 
  i literally shivering while reading this post - people quite seriously discuss how to grab kaliningrad from russia or what action should be taken by china to conquere russian far east . 
  quite surprising for the ` defence alliance ' topic . 
  if you could possible find strength to overpass your biass in order to think how nato looks like from the other side . 
  well , obviously , it serves as defensive alliance because none of the members was under attack for a while , but it would be not right to ommit agression made by alliance . 
  of course , you can use the argument of the russian aggression , but let 's try to move away from emotional triggers like ` annextion ' , ` democracy ' , ` freedom ' and ` totalitarian ' - the truth is that your bombs takes hundredfold more lifes . 
  believe it or not , but your society is subject to the monstrous propaganda . 
  and the worst part - you do not even notice this , maybe because you are not aware like russians ( i do n't watch tv for like ten years ) , or maybe because you prefer to think that you have access to better consumption of information ( our media is free - our media told us so ) . 
  so what 's the final point ? 
  please consider that you are forcibly moved to another cold war . 
  and if previous was indeed cold , it does n't neceasery means that current one would n't lead to disaster . 
  it 's up for us to resist to induced increase of tension and aggression, 
  so only ` good ' populism and ` justified ' spacegoats are alowed ? 
  edit : i mean , is n't bashing farage is populism at the moment ? 
  or does n't merkel 's [ proposal ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-scotland-germany-iduskcn0zc0qt ) leads to instability and hostile environment inside uk ? 
  it 's even funny that racist comment about racism get upvoted in this sub . 
  mate , kindly accept idea that people are different because of countless number of factors , even language affects brain structure , as scientists figured out . 
  so if poles not so positive about refugees it does n't necessary makes them racist ; while your comment definetly makes you look like a silly uneducated person with race-superiority complex . 
  illegal food imports destroyed for healthcare reasons - there are no guarantees that during cultivation of these fruits only safe chemicals were used, 
  that was sarcasm in my case, 
  expected turn of events , but still suprising because weightlifter get caught after other athlets . 
  is it not obvious that weightlifters abuse different kinds of doping ? 
  in my opinion , this is the sport in which the results of professionals exceed the limits of the human body long ago . 
  i still ca n't unsee video in which weightlifter breaks arm under the weight of the bar ) = it must be admitted that physical strength was a more important factor of sexual/natural selection among the slavs - as a consequence of climate conditions and the later development of the state in comparison with other european nations . 
  considering this fact , rather naive to believe that athletes from other countries do n't use doping, 
  yeah , and usa ** later ** respond with placing nuclear balistic missiles in turkey ( = edit : carlin was so right about your owners, 
  i 'm not switching from topic , but expanding it with remarkable information which could be interesting for readers . 
  regarding the reliability of the resource , i really do not understand how it can be positioned as a neutral . 
  for example , provided article is full of things that are impossible to prove ( non-invasive torture ) or simply lack of prooves ( like documented tortures ) , but the reader is invited to believe . 
  moreover , the article does not mention alternative point of view on events . 
  so i conclude , that this site ( registered shortly after crimea reunion ) is propaganda mouthpiece designed to create a biased view on ukraine 's events among english-speaking community, 
  position like this is the issue . 
  you see , huge amount of people prefer to stay in places where they were born , and to speak language they used to . 
  problem here is that society in ukraine is [ po ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/polls_razumkov_center_2009.svg/1024px-polls_razumkov_center_2009.svg.png ) - [ la ] ( https://www.rt.com/files/news/28/0e/c0/00/2u1.jpg ) - [ ri ] ( https://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/981/files/2014/03/ukr_salary_map.jpg ) - [ zed ] ( http://s4.pikabu.ru/post_img/big/2014/06/25/8/1403699311_1923467701.png ) in two parts and goverment not only [ ignores ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/ukraine-bans-communist-party-separatism ) the voice comming from one side , but also [ assists ] ( http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-crisis/pro-russian-journalist-oles-buzina-shot-dead-kiev-masked-gunmen-n342661 ) violence [ against ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahwhqj8g7bk ) [ them ] ( https://static.life.ru/posts/2014/6/135062/994a508e33d156fb2e90670b30790d98__980x.jpg ) . 
  i would like to add to this completely unbiassed article from reliable euromaidanpress.com that afanasyev and soloshenko were exchanged for two ukrainians ( not kidding ) elena grishinskaya ( she was pregnant btw ) and vitaliy didenko . 
  they were detained by the ukrainian security service ( sbu ) in april 2015 for `` separatism '' and `` treason '' . 
  according to the sbu reports , journalists have organized the movement `` people 's rada of bessarabia . '', 
  it had as its objective the protection of interests of national minorities in odessa region ( gagauz , bulgarians , moldovans and other nations ) . 
  in the case of `` people 's rada of bessarabia '' involved another odessa journalist artem buzila . 
  he was sentenced in 2015 to three years of imprisonment for separatism . 
  it 's so strange that we refuse to obey rules while playing with a cardsharper ( =, 
  thank you guys for belarusian shrimps in moscow shops ( = !, 
  get downvoted for [ this ] ( https://www.quora.com/2015-russia-ukraine-conflict-do-people-in-crimea-regret-their-decision-to-be-a-part-of-russia ) ( =, 
  so in order to improve life of miserable tatars and ukrainians west put sanctions on them ? 
  you know what 's going to work even better - cut water and electricity supplies to penisula ... oh , wait . 
  i ca n't understand logic behind this , it 's like punishment on people for their choice . 
  it 's also not very clear how this supposed to twist crimeans mood edit : it seems people do n't know , that besides ordinary sanctions on russian federation , there are additional sanctions for crimeans directly , like travel ban and various prohibition for bussines on penisula . 
  and that 's the strange part - if you want to show them how wrong they are with their [ choice ] ( https://www.quora.com/2015-russia-ukraine-conflict-do-people-in-crimea-regret-their-decision-to-be-a-part-of-russia ) , why to offend them ? 
  the point is as long as conflict exist , ukraine government not only has excuse for social and economic disaster , but also keeps ultra-right battalions busy . 
  i still think it 's important to evaluate reasoning behind the post , rather than flag . 
  in fact , whole ` russian troll ' meme injected in order to prevent you guys from unbiassed look over what russians are trying to explain or reveal, 
  well , but it would be silly not to consider ukraine goverment 's interest in keeping this conflict in active phase . 
  of course , it is undeniable that the russian culture was strongly influenced by the french in 18-19th centuries , especialy among noble class . 
  however , point about pushkin is totaly wrong , because he had be producing notable poems in russian since his childhood . 
  when i look at comment trees like this i frequently ask myself : how comes that / r/europe afraid of russian trolls , when dominant influence from ukrainian trolls is so clearly visible ? 
  i kid you not , majority of russia related posts filled with the highly upvoted patterned short comments . 
  this is either a sign of the presence of anti-putin bots , or the extremely low intelligence of the average / r/european . 
  it depends on a particular cases , there could n't be simpe answer like `` x affected with propaganda , while y are unbiased persons '' . 
  the truth is , as a man who is active in both informational spaces , i find both parties heavely affected by msm propaganda , and for that reason it 's very important to diversify information sources . 
  you are just retranslating memes without sufficient contribution to the discussion , what is horrible , is that people like you tend to dismiss opposite view with another meme ` russian bots ! ' . 
  it 's obvious , that russia supports those separatist , just like gulf states support islamists in syria . 
  russian goal over here is to prevent ukraine from joining nato , and minsk agreement design to serve this goal as well . 
  regardless of your political position , you must be mature enough to condemn the medieval siege in the 21st century, 
  i think the main reason for this is remarkable anti-russian bias over here . 
  for example , / r/europe supports awfull blockade of separatist-held territory , even if it means suffer for innocent people . 
  people do n't want to analyze events like this , all they want to do is to bash russia , of course it 's triggers reaction . 
  i you even capable to keep discussion without mocking russians or russian federation ? 
  governments uses soft power to prevent political party from getting financial aid , that should disturb europeans . 
  even without ` whatabout ' argument it 's clear , that both media spaces are loaded with crap . 
   and that gives russia to right to finance foreign parties ? 
  if it 's not prohibited by law . 
  for example , there are restrictions in possible foreign aid volume for politicans and media in russia .
