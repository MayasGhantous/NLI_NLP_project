  this blogger , sokolovsky , started whining about being prosecuted immediately . 
  we 've had this law for quite a while now , a whole load of people warned him against making this video , but he made it anyway . 
  i 'm not saying he deserved it , i 'm not saying that this law is n't retarded , but this guy is a fucking idiot . 
  sorry , what ? 
  `` to protest vote '' ? 
  there is some tank simulator . 
  are they ? 
  i do n't see any effects of them on either putin or his `` friends '' . 
  and trust me , i would be happy to see them . 
  oh great , now downvote me for the post without any context . 
  not only property , they 're still managing their businesses there . 
  oops , sorry , eastern ukraine . 
  edited . 
  to be honest , it mostly decreased public opinion on western countries . 
   he is not revealing that he is an ethnic russian , who emigrated to ireland how is he supposed to reveal that ? 
  * hello everyone , i 'm an ethnic russian * ? 
  and how did you find it out if he had n't reveal his ethnicity ? 
  stop painting the world in black in white already . 
  i do n't agree with his * why should we care * , but it does n't suddenly make me non-russian , right ? 
  this argument is just stupid . 
  it 's like if i accused you of being a european with strong interest of spreading anti-russian rhetoric . 
  it would sound like tv propaganda , and your statement sounds like it too . 
  more like between ( ex ) cpsu-members and non-communists . 
  russia is not going to return crimea , nor abandon ~ ~ west ~ ~ eastern ukraine ; at least not because of these sanctions . 
  i 'm sorry , but what are they going to achieve with them ? 
  every native german is somehow related to nazies , so is kinda irrelevant . 
  wtf is far-right ? 
  everybody who 's not left-leaning ? 
  for me , `` far right '' is someone who calls for genocide/segregation/ethnic cleansing/etc . 
  does this candidate do that ? 
   soon . 
  not really . 
  food security matters a lot , though . 
  are n't almost all ukranian journalists are putin critics ? 
  well , for some people it 's already happening . 
   the sanctions hurt russia way more than they hurt the eu i wonder if `` but their pit is deeper ! '', 
  kind of mentality will ever disappear in slavic countries . 
  none of these . 
  `` a just russia '' and communists pretend to be opposition sometimes , but it does n't really matter . 
  fuck these kinds of laws . 
  we 're also going to have them , sadly . 
  to create visibility of lawfulness . 
  i 'm already tired of these elections . 
  whatever who cares , we all know who is going to win . 
  well for many europeans these soldiers are also occupants . 
  ca n't really blame them for that . 
  why are n't you called as a putinbot for asking proofs ? 
  this is horrifying . 
  where and how does plastic gets stuck ? 
  you do realize that most parts of any absorbed food ca n't be digested ? 
  poland , as well as the rest of eastern europe , should be on its own . 
  both russian and eu ways are basically a deadlock . 
  uh , this is not true . 
  wtf why do i get downvoted for saying this ? 
  well , wto is not required for free trade . 
  yeah , `` a just russia '' is similar to european moderate left . 
  ldpr is big damn joke . 
  today they talk about freedom , tomorrow they embrace stalin . 
  the only reason people vote for them is `` hahahha their leader shouts some random shit '', 
  well , we had russian opposition coordination council , but it have n't achieved anything in the end . 
  others are not even worth mentioning . 
  russian opposition is too segregated and untrustworthy for most people . 
  okay , let 's get this straight . 
  there are two sentences : 1 ) they hunt down gay people . 
  2 ) they hunt down pedophiles and think that all homosexuals are same . 
  do you really think that there is no difference ? 
  inb4 i do n't approve their actions . 
  what the fuck ? 
  not at all . 
  well , `` just russia '' is kind of pro-west , but meh who cares about them . 
  i like how people in comments there say `` boohoo , trump is the same '' when it 's anti-hillary whistleblowers who are being found dead . 
  also , who the hell is kara-murza ? 
  because there is n't one . 
  i wish it was . 
  progapanda , sir . 
  do you know what is even more retarded ? 
  we now even have icons ( ! ), 
  with [ stalin ] ( http://pics.livejournal.com/metaciplenariy/pic/0000tpgr/s640x480 ) and [ lenin ] ( http://www.eg.ru/upimg/photo/133876.jpg ) , and they 're being considered as ( !!! ), 
  saints by some people . 
  that 's just not true . 
  many russians do miss ussr . 
  what 's the point ? 
  it 's funny how everybody seems to be surpised by this . 
  only for common soviet people ; that 's how propaganda worked . 
  andrey amalrik , for example , predicted that ussr will fall in 1984 , right when perestroika began . 
  level of shadow economy was sky high in early 80s already . 
  agro-industrial complex program in 70s-80s sucked out insane amount of money and achieved pure ** nothing ** , it was a complete failure . 
  so no , it was n't really stable . 
  yotaphone , you forgot about yotaphone !, 
  this, 
  at first , only politicians were sanctioned , so some mythologycal * they * did n't seem to care about me . 
  ah screw this . 
  with this attitude , go fuck yourself , mate . 
  it 's always nice to have some smartass who knows what i should spend my money on . 
  when will you soviet * we-should-control-everything * disappear already ? 
  because it 's the soviet system that creates this kind of authoritarism . 
  it did n't go away . 
  well it clearly has n't gotten better . 
  nothing will change if there is no putin anymore , clashes of elites mean ** nothing ** . 
  we had these clashes in 90s too .
