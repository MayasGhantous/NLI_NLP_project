  enough of this joke already , why the hell asking for proofs is considered bad here ? 
  i 'm not talking about this particular situation , just in general . 
  from my experience ( as a programmer ) , interns are never useful for the company . 
  when i was a mentor , i 've been spending 1-2 hours every day for one single intern . 
  yes , there were some outstanding uniques that could actually do work right away and earn money for the company , but they were all offered a job , so they are n't going to complain . 
  yay , we 've got the best score !, 
  * sadly , the statistics is n't wrong at all . 
  people in russia do feel really insecure while seeing the police around . 
  okay , i agree on this one . 
  i just feel uncomfortable when everyone seems to think that we 're basically worst polluters of all . 
  because they 're not brain-dead . 
  why would anyone want their children to be taught by a teacher with ~ 200 $ salary ? 
  nah , it would be better for putin if our team was n't allowed to the olympics . 
  much more opportunities to use words like `` plot '' , `` betrayal '' or `` sworn enemies '' on tv . 
  will it be considered as karma suicide if i say that the gap has nothing to do with any type of discrimination ? 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4w8zp1/the_town_that_reveals_how_russia_spills_two/d65hpw9 ), 
  so , according to [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4w8zp1/the_town_that_reveals_how_russia_spills_two/d656ocl ) , russia loses 17-20 million tonnes of oil . 
  according to [ this research ] ( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222650466_daily_oil_losses_in_shipping_crude_oil_measuring_crude_oil_loss_rates_in_daily_north_sea_shipping_operations ) , 354 thousand kilotonnes ( 354 million tons ) was lost in 2001 worldwide - let 's assume that these numbers have n't changed since then ( they are even bigger now , most probably ) . 
  so , we extract 13 % of oil and we are responsible for 4-5 % of its loss . 
  is it really bad ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  never in my life i 've seen these dreadful sceneries ( tv does not count ) with oil everywhere , and i was born in a town that was named after oil !, 
  no , turkish government is populist . 
  turks will be like `` yeaaaah we 've shown these stupid austrians '' it is n't really different from russian politics . 
  oh , so we should praise argentina for hiding nazi officers ? 
  why ? 
  the whole situation does n't automatically make them good people . 
  one of them could just convert , or they both may have represtened some minor islamic sect . 
  you know nothing about them except the fact that they 've been killed . 
  * jokes, 
  wow , what a big fookin surprise . 
  it 's the worst thing that can happen to the ruling elite , as people would n't want state 's hands in their pockets anymore . 
  1 ) they 'll just stop spending money on useless ( sorry ) shit that they would n't buy if inflation did n't exist . 
  they will still buy everything else . 
  2 ) moreover , deflation is caused by state regulations , which deal with things like planned obsolescence , which show that market can deal with decline in demand by itself . 
  3 ) why are we assuming that person a does have savings and person b does n't ? 
  there is nothing wrong in people reducing their spends . 
  it 's the natural process ; the state should n't force people to consume by triggering inflation . 
  and situations when government prohibits the circulation of foreign money because of high inflation just shows how dirty this policy is . 
   since when they use molotovs ? 
  far right and left wingers do , but not those islamists this is the most stupid thing i 've ever read . 
  no way , turkey !, 
  you ca n't do that !, 
  why the hell everybody behaves as if brexit has already happened ? 
  sorry , but why on earth would you have a problem with one of these ? 
  1 ) in early 20s ( 22-25 years old ) . 
  2 ) it became common in last 15-20 years . 
  3 ) 24-28 , i think . 
  because people in communist countries are poor . 
  i remember reading memoirs of some guy working in soviet troupe : when they went to west berlin for the first time , during the stroll one of the actors fell to his knees and shouted `` but we won the war ! '', 
  most people were doing useless job though . 
  you 're just delusional . 
  this has nothing to do with krautchan . 
  after the act of terrorism in volgograd in 2013 , lots of people in there stopped using public transport for several weeks . 
  meh , just read his other comments - he is an agressive militarist who hates literally everything . 
  save your time . 
  who the hell are you talking to ? 
  lmao, 
  the water will still poor on pavements mostly . 
  i guess our planners will never figure this out . 
  do they still recieve social support from the state ? 
  if so , this is n't wrong from my perspective . 
  not quite . 
  internet ? 
  oh , i 've just misread the comment . 
  yes , they are . 
  what 's the point ? 
  https://imgur.com/a/bnopc that 's how he answered in facebook . 
  well this is just stupid , everyone needs to have sugar in their ration . 
  it 's like extra-taxing salt or bread . 
  1 ) if they do n't pay for it , who the hell does ? 
  2 ) there are millions of health risk groups . 
  what do we do with them ? 
  3 ) can they actually `` pay for their own healtcare '' ? 
  as far as i 'm concerned , you ca n't refuse from paying for `` free '' healthcare in europe . 
  you clearly do n't know what you are talking about . 
  not really . 
  well , they do use things like that . 
  just with more secure software protocols . 
  i do n't think that rw extremists want to have an iranian muslim in their ranks . 
  this is about ethnicity and religion , not about borders . 
  god rest his soul . 
  this is really complicated . 
  tatarstan and baskortostan are rich regions - they 're basically donors that feed other regions - which leads to separatist sentiments . 
  however , they have a large number of both muslims and orthodox russians . 
  this leads to obvious confilcts of interests : remain vs independence vs association with kazakhstan or ( sic ! ), 
  even turkey . 
  obviously , russian supporters are much more common here , but nobody knows what will happen if things turn bad . 
  tatarstan is literally surrounded by other russian subjects . 
  it ca n't get independence unless bashkortostan wants it too ( together they can be taken by kazakhstan most probably , and this would end up really nasty ) or just entire country is falling apart . 
  the worst part is that russia does n't really need to use ` extended holidays ' anymore to keep the conflict going . 
  not without any peacekeeping forces there , at least . 
  from my point of view , czech republic is the most ` european ' country in europe - with good balance between statism and capitalism , nationalism and globalism , etc. 
  okay , i 'm fine with that . 
  though i still think the existence of these emails should be much more concerning than the hackers ' nationality . 
  you do n't believe everything you hear or read , do you ? 
  what 's wrong with asking for proofs ? 
  oh , and by they way , i did n't vote for putin in 2014 and i wo n't vote for him in 2018 , i do n't support annexation of crimea , i do n't consider a dope scandal as a conspiracy , i am not a communist and i do n't hate europeans or americans . 
  stop living in a imaginary world where everything is either black or white , as you look ridiculous . 
  how asking for a proof can be an absurd point ?
