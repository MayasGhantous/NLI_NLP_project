  whataboutx, 
  because these labels are being used on wrong people . 
  no one respects the intelligentsia . 
  freedom is given . 
  and nobody should be left without it for having privacy . 
  for me , it as basic as right to think freely , speak freely and live freely . 
  and i will consider your basic rights unnecessary to be fullfiled , if you consider mine unnecessary as well . 
  well , with all that whining about fake news this seems kinda hypocritical for me . 
   a forensic examination showed that urban had in fact been shot in the head between 4:30 and 5:30 p.m. , several hours before the attack began and people were downvoted to hell for saying that it was unlikely that the driver was fighting during the attack . 
  lol, 
  it 's much harder to control . 
  the size of wheels also reduces the control accuracy ; so this trick is about drivers ' professionalism . 
  it 's almost like people can only read titles . 
  wait ... 
   the prime minister is understood to be backing plans to `` lift and shift '' human rights enshrined in the european convention and write them into uk law . 
   he told mps : `` although we have no quarrel with the content of the european convention on human rights , it is the way in which that document is applied that gives us difficulty . '', 
  why do people deserve to be allowed to do whatever they want with their lives ? 
  why do people deserve to live at all ? 
   it really surprises me how easily people in the west buy government bullshit it 's good to know that such point of view still exist in r/europe . 
  that 's just selfishness and cowardice . 
  in russia it 's : ** 18-30 : ** 91 % ** 31-45 : ** 85 % ** 46-60 : ** 47 % ** 60 + : ** 16 %, 
  even if we had a 100 % accurate ai that would detect fake news , i still would oppose these kinds of laws . 
  everybody able to recommend anybody anything . 
  we do n't need you to tell lieberman what he should ( not ) say . 
  this feels weird to see comments like these coming from european . 
  jeez , you sound just like our roskomnadzor . 
  here you go , europe !, 
  see , you can into censorshit just like we do . 
  how much authoritarian ? 
  how much nationalistic ? 
  how much religious ? 
  [ ... ] how much isolationist ? 
  what does war-mongering even mean ? 
  there is n't binary choice between putin and `` yanks '' . 
  you 're talking like state propaganda : `` there is nobody but putin '', 
  does south ossetia deserve independence ? 
  with russian administration , russian jurisdiction and russian military presence , i suppose it is . 
  what a waste of money . 
  wow , that 's really sad . 
  where do you live ? 
  actually , many people do n't even consider christmas as a holiday . 
  aftermath of soviet past , i guess . 
  putin calls himself a liberal , does he look like a liberal to you ? 
  uh , soviet union always had problems with corruption and nepotism , just not as bad as in nowadays russia . 
  we have free education , free healthcare and sky-high taxes . 
  seems pretty socialist to me . 
   neo-nazi are you seriously trying to equate people who support holocaust with nationalists ? 
  400k in kaliningrad ? 
  what are we , china ? 
  lol, 
  what are exact opportunities that you want to be equal ? 
  so are they allowed not to give loans to people with certain color of skin ? 
  i think someone would end up in jail for this . 
  thanks . 
  yes it is a choice . 
  you are free to make some commune on whateverthefuck rules you want , if they do n't violate anyone 's rights . 
  in fact , there were plenty of colletivist mini-societies in 90s in russia , but in the end most of them collapsed due to some stupid minor shit like `` he took my milk from the fridge '', 
  can anyone check and translate this ? 
  what a retarded question . 
  i 'm tatar myself , with volga bulgar roots . 
  volga bulgars are not related with mongol tatars . 
  that 's not true , different tatars have different roots . 
  i agree with you , but what does it have to do with populists ? 
  because * emotions  law * in here . 
  what, 
  tor , l2p . 
   we ca n't just stop using the services because of that . 
  i mean , yeah , we could , but it would n't fix anything . 
  yes we can . 
  yes it would fix everything , over time . 
  but it did . 
  2008 was freaking horrible . 
  why would our military target hospitals ? 
  to be evil ? 
   undermining us democracy sigh, 
  even more if we take things like computers , mobile phones , etc. 
  also terrorist attack attempt in chechnya . 
  state media coverage actually make it look like a reason to be closer . 
  joint investigation , flowers at the embassy , all that stuff . 
  not only terrorists do that . 
  i have 35gb per month for ~ 10 bucks . 
  and i have opinion about your opinion . 
   this guy is more dangerous than stalin wtf is wrong with r/europe ? 
  i hear this shit more and more often . 
   so few people today in russia know much of anything about their country it 's quite funny how many people here seem to think that i 'm in any way pro-putin/pro-russian-politics just because my opinion is different from theirs . 
  fascism is strongly tied with anti-socialism and nationalism . 
  both these movements are quite marginal in russia , especially among politicians . 
  this is my weird russian ability to know about my country , not someone 's else . 
  and your stupid `` ussr is better than putin '' means you know nothing about russian/soviet revanchism , or you 're just another retarded communist . 
  no , you fucking do n't . 
  you do n't know either ussr revanchists or current russian politicians . 
  you do n't know current internal policies , you do n't know current public sentiment for them . 
  you do n't know processes in the russian military , you do n't know about their causes . 
  everything you say here is pretending like everything related to putin is the worst thing that can happen to russia , europe and world in general , while it 's obviously not true for anybody with at least piece of the brain . 
  putin and his administration is indeed an oligarchy , and it is somewhat imperialistic , but it is not fascist . 
  but if russia is pushed to fascism ( not into this stupid buzzword that you throw around , but into real one ) , you and me both will be fucked . 
  most american and european politicians realise this , and you do n't . 
   i 'd take the ussr over putins fascist state any time you simply do n't know what are you talking about then . 
  no , it 's not `` theoretically allowed '' . 
  it can only be used , if the state drops constitution and several international memorandums and agreements .
