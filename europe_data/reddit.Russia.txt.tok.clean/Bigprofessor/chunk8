  our most common is probably lenin st. 
  what the fuck ? 
  there is no death penalty in russia . 
  \u0421onstitutional court explicitly stated this . 
  europe already has american missile defense systems within its borders . 
  you 're extremely delusional if you think that they wo n't be a target . 
  that would be so much fun to be fucked by some state banking monopoly that will control all financial flows . 
  please ban us from swift , both we and you will love the brand new ussr . 
  is kosovo part of serbia ? 
  ask south ossetia about georgia . 
  he was n't targeting anyone . 
  he was selling people 's grain to buy factories from the west , which resulted in famine . 
  [ here is the view from my office . 
  i always was against annexation , but returning crimea now would the worst thing to do . 
  grey commieblocks , mud and shit-tear weather are indeed depressing . 
  it would n't be the issue now if politicians in ussr were n't so corrupt . 
  `` peace '' was bought from them . 
  there were lots of negotiations between tatarstan ( + bashkortostan ) and russia . 
  they 've bargained large autonomies despite having a russian ethnic majority , who were against independence . 
  they wo n't ask . 
  soviets hate the very idea of unequality , and would want everyone to be equally poor . 
  or dead . 
  his region gets a too much money for this . 
  i would be surprised if he gets even 10 % . 
  what 's your point ? 
  you want them to hack all candidates ? 
  how will you make them ? 
  so how do you separate cases when information is published selectively with those when there is just lack of data ? 
  are you saying that having some information is worse than having no information at all ? 
  there is something inherently wrong with being in russian liberal mainstream . 
  it 's just as fucked up as any other political movement in here . 
  they can offer nothing useful . 
  why so much fuss about hackers ? 
  caring about national cyber security is one thing , but talking about them in context of elections is really-really dumb . 
  is n't it better to know things about politicians that you 're going ( not ? ), 
  to vote for ? 
  liar . 
  oh , we have that one too . 
  if they wanted independence , they would have left in 91-92s , when everybody was allowed to leave . 
  total dissolution of the soviet union would the greatest thing happend to russia . 
  too bad it did n't happen and we still have cpsu members in charge . 
  90s pitfall is their fault . 
   the same people are you sure that they 're the same ? 
  that 's just your generalization/speculation . 
  it 's not so bad . 
  i just had to concentrate to understand them . 
  `` unborn children '' is not a valid statistical unit . 
  i will probably be downvoted for saying this , but apart from idiotic `` gay propaganda '' law , it 's not different from most of european countries . 
  at personal level , at least . 
  oh , sorry , i forgot that russia is basically mordor , populated by orcs with some sort of hivemind . 
  you 're right , there are no good people in here . 
  i was n't apologising stalin or communism , you moron , i was only pointing out errors in figures . 
  well , for example , russian human rights organisation `` memorial '' which is specialized on ussr repressions , [ states ^ ru ] ( http://echo.msk.ru/programs/staliname/696621-echo ) that 11-38 million were repressed ( not killed ) . 
  it creates a dangerous precedent when government is allowed to decide what people ca n't say or demonstrate , despite the fact that nobody 's rights are violated . 
  i hate stalin and communist regime in general , but 30 million people is an impossible number . 
  free speech with compromises is not free . 
  seriously , you can be prosecuted for that ? 
  jeez . 
  wtf am i reading ? 
  what does it even mean ? 
  of course i can tell people what they 're , that 's what * words * are designed for . 
  ascoldian baptism ( 860s ) - that 's when christianity started to spread in russian lands . 
  / r/serbia , we humbly request you not to kill any more erzherzogs . 
  in this particular case both claims are equally non-credible , as they 're not verifiable . 
  no shit , sherlock . 
  why should we care about them though ? 
  nobody will miss them , except , well , us . 
  humanazing * ideas * like `` nature '' or `` species '' ( as a whole ) is pretty useless . 
  putin : western intel services aiming to destabilize russia is this what politics should be - throwing shit at each other ? 
  is it just me , or this guy does n't have a voice ? 
  of course they can . 
  this policies should not be enforced by governments , however . 
  everybody has a right to be douche . 
  the treaty does n't make any distinction on the fact of agressor 's presence in the alliance . 
  honestly , i find these numbers pretty horrifying . 
  ooooooh , he 's only restricting art freedom for some random greater good , that 's a relief . 
  see , guys , nothing to worry about !, 
  i get ** why ** , i do n't get ** how ** . 
  i mean , i could give poll data to journalists who are not under italian jurisdiction . 
   no official poll must be published in this time window how is this possible ? 
  feels good . 
  making shitty websites remotly - maybe ; i think this category of `` programming '' is going to die pretty soon . 
  outsourcing something like applied nathematics , system programming , data science , etc is almost impossible in most cases . 
  it works for any field of activity . 
  yay , protectionism, 
   there are many bad effects of global warming this is quite questionable and unverifiable in long-term . 
  for example , mesozoic era was ** very ** warm , with high levels of carbon dioxide and low levels of oxygen ; and , due to greenhouse effect , climate zones were almost non-existent . 
  it was n't bad for species diversity , that 's for sure . 
  so when ( not if ) global warming becomes a serious issue , it will be only our problem that we will eventually overcome . 
  no , it 's not . 
  increased amount of carbon dioxide does improve the intensiveness of photosynthese , which is good for plants ( if they have enough water , though ) . 
  wtf , do you guys have biology and chemistry in your schools ? 
  lol why am i being downvoted, 
  that 's why reformation happened . 
  it 's not for the pope to decide how sins should be absolved . 
   in violation of international law yeah , and cuban expropriation of american property ( ~ 8 billions dollars ) was so lawful . 
  that 's definitely a spy , true gopnik despises rockers with their damn sign of the horns . 
  nah , i would be called 5th column if i wrote something like this under such articles about russia . 
  well , there is a somewhat common situation in organ translatation system when people get paid for * `` voluntary '' * organ donation . 
  anyway , i do n't know spanish and ca n't tell what this article is about .
