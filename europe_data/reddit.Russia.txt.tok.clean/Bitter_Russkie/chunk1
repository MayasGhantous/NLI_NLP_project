tssssk !, 
  we do n't consider people having a family and chidren to be better than those without them since 1973 . 
  race became an issue when the democrats and the us media decided that it was a good idea to lie repeatedly and craft a narrative of blacks being unjustly shot by police all over the us , and also to make excuses for ensuing violent riots . 
  in that case they should have voted hillary . 
   it really is amazing how the basic income and robots gon na our jerbs crowds ** see nothing wrong ** with the idea of government having control over how much money everyone gets . 
  money from robot taxpayers obviously . 
  it really is amazing how the basic income and robots gon na our jerbs crowds see nothing wrong with the idea of government having control over how much money everyone gets . 
  we 're just really insecure and afraid of a strong independent wymyn in the white house . 
  i did n't think of this myself . 
  the line belongs to justin trudeau . 
  it 's less than zero ? 
  if you kill your enemies - they win . 
   again we see * the entire european and north american * politics dominated by what happened in 1941 or 1991 . 
  communists vs fascists , the same story again and again . 
  i wonder when these guys will finally stop living in the past . 
  a little correction there . 
  everytime i see something this stupid i remember that they are polling grandmas who sit at home all day and still have a stationary phone . 
  i fail to see how this picture can be construed as anything but insulting to the viewer 's intelligence . 
   in its investigation , bloomberg spoke to an uber driver named shawn hofstede , who leased a 2016 toyota corolla through xchange for $ 155 a week after getting in a car accident . 
   eventually , he got fed up with this arrangement and told xchange to pick up the car . 
  he stopped paying and stopped driving for uber . 
  kay ... you can always read the word `` basically '' in leftist propaganda pieces as `` not really '' . 
   uber essentially replaces taxi drivers with indentured servants except of course they are not indentured to anyone , and you 're just being an overly emotional luddite . 
   there has been an investigation * citation needed *  and there 's prove oh , so you 're also illiterate , that explains a lot , how is school ? 
   mass murdering their neighbours now i 'm going to explain you a few things . 
  if your yank brain gets tired at any point i encourage you to take breaks . 
  what is happening in ukraine is a civil war stemming from the fact that the majority of the population of donetsk and luhansk is russian . 
  it is a tragedy and the russians were influenced by government propanga . 
  but you see , unlike the us that has freedom of speech \u2122 and freedom of press \u2122 and so on , in russia the political discourse and media outlets are censored and controlled in various mostly extra-legal ways , it is difficult to organize protests and have access to truth with some relaxations in moscow and st. petersburg . 
  the essential difference is that yanks have all the means at their disposal to hold their government resposible , but instead they choose to yippee-ka-yay around the world bombing everyone with no regard for any existing norms of international law or consequences . 
  that is why you are a nation of bloodthirsty morons . 
  no investigation , no decisive proof whether one of the different versions is correct . 
  all because tillerson said that there is ` no doubt ** in our minds ** ' that assad did it . 
  that is as much as you yanks need to start slinging explosives . 
  tell me , if you will - will you ever be content with the amount of blood you 've spilt in your pointless destabilizing wars around the world or is there no measurable quantity that would satisfy your bloodlust ? 
  shhh ... no questions , just war . 
  nah , just a lying snake you people elected . 
  you 'd think one would n't fall for the `` we must stop being the world policeman '' lie from a politician three times in a row , but here we are . 
  this time it 's totally going to be like japan 1945 . 
  or it * might * be another libya . 
  i do n't really know what i 'm talking about , i 'm just a retarded warmonger and i want more blood . 
  now , i get that there is a saying that history repeats itself . 
  but 15 years a cycle seems a bit too bizzare . 
  sure . 
  people refuse to call fascists fascists because that would hurt their feelings . 
  that happens aaaall the time ... 
  no evidence of any controversial political activity . 
  well , i guess putin strangled him with his bare hands and then ate his kidneys for dinner . 
  - / r/europe, 
  yes , there is a magic immaterial gender thing within everyone 's body that sometimes does n't match the chromosomes . 
  what 's so hard to understand ? 
   see , that 's where you simply assume and make up something to confirm your own argument . 
  oh , i am so terribly sorry , but you have to understand that us filthy peasants with no mind-reading capabilities have little choice but to make assumptions , since you in your cosmic wisdom have yet to produce a coherent thought connecting the war in iraq with terrorism in germany . 
  instead of providing evidence for your claim , you ask people to prove a negative . 
  you 're a genius mate . 
  oh no , do n't get me wrong , i can clearly see you train of thought . 
  the us does something criminal and stupid , therefore whitey deserves to pay . 
  i just do n't consider that coherent and intellectual . 
  centainly not a position from which you should intellectually condescend to a monkey , let alone another human being . 
   your edit :  and what does that have to do with germany , oh the enlightened one ? 
   what does terrorism have to do with hegemonial agression wars ? 
  perhaps before we start working on your edgyness and arrogance issues , you need to take a reading comprehension class . 
   this world is truly a hospital for the sick and crazy ... makes me wonder why i am here ... oh woe you , edgy von edgelord is such a unique intellectual snowflake he ca n't stand to mingle with the plebs . 
   and who inspired isis ? 
  could n't possibly been the drones , bombs , uranium ammunition that killed over a million iraqis and left a divided and \u00b4 fucked up country behind . 
  or the evolution and spread of the mujahedeen ( cia created to fight a proxy war against russia ) to al-qaida to isis ... and what does that have to do with germany , oh the enlightened one ? 
  we should form a research team . 
  virtue signaling is a term meaning mostly people using social media to express their opinion on every single thing . 
  signaling other people that they are indeed for all the good stuff and against all the bad things , while not exactly doing any research on any particular topic , or doing anything tangible . 
  that 's sexist , you homophobe !, 
  the only clarification that i 've found is that it primarily concerns schools in the south where some actual greeks live . 
  of course considering the fact that english is a compulsory foreign language and 95 % come out of school unable to speak a speck of it , this whole thing is hardly relevant to anything . 
  waste of money . 
   that is your opinion , now i dare you to consistently publish opinions as a journalist in russia contrary to putin 's aims . 
  be careful in those flat stairwells ... hmm ... 
  pass . 
  and honestly i was n't aware that the white house has coerced journos from nyt or cnn to fawn over president nobel peace prize or the clintons . 
  they are happy to do it on their own volition it seems to me . 
  `` because the press believed it was their duty to tell tell the truth and expose lies '' yeah ... no , the press believed it was their duty to be the pr-agency of the democratic party . 
   while 55 % of women been sexually harassed in the past 12 months weapons grade bullshit . 
  exactly . 
  the concept of * \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f * is non-sense garbage . 
  i happen to think it 's very relevant . 
  you see , one can ramble on about ww3 all day long , and people might just think you 're crazy . 
  hillary on the other hand has a history of making a huge mess . 
  i do n't think it 's far-fetched to say that people could have connected the dots . 
  which would not have been half as successful if it was n't for her lybia adventure . 
  we came , we saw , he died . 
  * cackle cackle *, 
   when chicken have teeth . 
  when a crayfish whistles on a mountain . 
  hmm ... 
  so between importing less terrorism and giving more power to the surveilance state the french choose the latter . 
  same as germany . 
  and some people say there are no common european values . 
  looks like someone learned a few things from the clintons . 
  oh poor guy . 
  he just wants to integrate into society by changing what everyone in said society is allowed to say and think . 
  this is fucking hilarious . 
  no intonation whatsoever , it 's like he 's reading from a teleprompter for the first time .
