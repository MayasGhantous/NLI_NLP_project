pls no . 
  there were [ german socialist revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_revolution_of_1918\u201319 ) with bavarian and bremen soviet republics , led by german communists , [ hungarian socialist revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutions_and_interventions_in_hungary_\\ ( 1918 -- 20 \\ ) ) led by hungarian communists , and [ many-many ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutions_of_1917\u201323#communist_revolutions_that_started_1917.e2.80.9324 ) others . 
  second international was truly international and was n't even born in russia . 
  i would n't say that it was russians . 
  they were bolsheviks in the first place . 
  world revolution and all that . 
  second this . 
  current situation is ok for putin . 
  conflict escalation does n't do anything good for him . 
  hmm , i would say he is definitely more right-wing than centrist . 
  as we say in russia : `` lingua latina non penis canis est ! '', 
  link ? 
   i 'd genuinely , from the russian speaking redditors , like to know how true and prevalent are such attitudes in russian media and russian mass media . 
  think of it as a religion . 
  for many russians , memories about ww2 are sacred . 
  just like muslims believe no one can draw caricatures to their prophet , a lot of russians think no one should throw shade at the red army . 
  sometimes they admit that there were war crimes and , in general , not so good behavior from soldiers , but it does n't matter because one : it was punished ; and two : they won and saved the world from the nazis . 
  smaller amount of russians hold similar views on the whole soviet union and , particulary , stalin . 
  yeah , there were repressions , famines etc. , but it was justified because `` he had found russia working with wooden ploughs and is leaving her equipped with atomic piles '' ( quote falsely attributed to churchill , but actually written by deutscher ; it was once in encyclop\u00e6dia britannica ) . 
  the end justifies the means . 
  the ussr was the perfect state and all the bad things either were needed or came from anglosaxones . 
  there 's also next point of view towards critics of the ussr from eastern europe : `` the soviet union saved you from the nazis . 
  without it you all would n't exist , so , basically , you owe us your existence . . we , in general , are unconcerned about your independence and even criticism of the ussr , but do not dare to touch what the ussr has given you . '', 
  [ i do n't know what are you talking about ] ( https://img.ifcdn.com/images/ff72d1aeeb4df819eb9a3df1a252f54f849fe27974a2fbd947a1e5e2b0bd736e_1.jpg ), 
  lol indeed . 
  also . 
  russian fetish -- furry . 
  can confirm . 
  i suggest `` new novgorod republic '' or `` great novgorod republic '' . 
  numbers in state 's name are not cool . 
  huh ? 
  did i miss something ? 
  upd : nevermimd , i remembered . 
  it was about wikipedia article . 
  so it was not `` russia '' but members of wiki community . 
  they renamed it on may , 13 , 2013 . 
  so , way before any conflict . 
  actually now it 's kievan rus ' again . 
  it 's not that simple . 
  first mikhail , the prince of tver , got the jarlyk from mongols and became the grand prince of vladimir , basically of all rus at that moment . 
  tried to conquer moscow , failed . 
  got in few conflicts with novgorod , using the mongol 's jarlyk . 
  then yuri , the grand prince of moscow , using mongol 's help , killed mikhail . 
  then dmitry , son of mikhail , complained to mongols about yuri ( he did n't give money to mongols ) and got the jarlyk . 
  then they went to the horde and there dmitri killed yuri and later was executed by mongols . 
  then there was an uprising in tver , which was suppressed by mongols using moscow army . 
  sorry about this wall of text . 
  i just want to show that basically everyone made aliance with the horde , fighting each other . 
  could they unite and try to confront the horde ? 
  well , of course . 
  but what they wanted was the power and i do n't think they was worried about occupation . 
   those who were killed by these collaborationists were the rus interesting approach . 
  i 'm pretty sure that all of slavic grand princes worked with mongols at some point . 
  most of the conflicts were against each other and not against the horde . 
  it 's just happened that moscow 's rulers `` won '' in that civil war . 
  it could be everyone . 
  i would n't say that it was something unusual at that times . 
  you said  real rus waged war against golden horde and did not collaborate with them . 
  but : lev danylovych of galicia invade poland and lithuania with mongol 's army . 
  yaroslav vselovolodovich was the first knyaz who recognized mongol 's authority . 
  alexander nevsky had a pretty close ties with them . 
  and all that was before muscovy even existed . 
  i agree that we can call grand duchy of moscow some sort of collaborationists ( based on modern moral standarts ) . 
  but in no way they were the only ones . 
  yeah , but were n't they actually some sort of the golden horde themselves ? 
  i mean , they came from scandinavia , conquer local tribes and lay them under the tribute . 
  and sometimes they were pretty brutal . 
   kievan rus was fairly progressive for its time as well which is hardly the case for russia today.muscovy was a tyrannical empire that subjugated all in its path , kind of like russia today . 
  but kievan rus started when rurik and then oleg conquered everything from novgorod to kiev . 
  how that 's any different from moscovy 's \u0441onquest ? 
  nothing . 
  the purpose of this stuff is making a mess . 
  it 's like throwing eggs . 
  it can be dangerous if it gets into the eyes though . 
  it 's actually quite [ popular ] ( https://www.google.ru/search?q=\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043a+\u0437\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430&amp;newwindow=1&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=3rj&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjfpvpx0dttahvdxcwkhbkebzcq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1517&amp;bih=774 ) weapon in russia and ukraine for a long time . 
  while your statement is true , this situation has very little to do with kadyrov . 
  people there would kill their gay relatives because it 's a shame to their families . 
  well , anti-communists do n't like him because he was a comunist . 
  stalinists do n't like him because of all anti-stalin campaigns . 
  and the general opinion , that he was pretty dumb and uneducated . 
  more positive than negative . 
  it really depends on person 's view on the ussr . 
  i think , only khrushchev and gorbachev are viewed mostly negative from both sides . 
  i would n't say that ivan iv is viewed as a hero here . 
  i think it 's quite the opposite actually . 
  zas\u0327is\u0327au\u0308s\u0327aa\u0308sa\u0308 and with digraphs and trigraphs : zaschischayuschajasja dunno , seems ok for me . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8sui-igw9k ), 
  it went out of use earlier and op is asking about 100 years . 
  and as you said , it was n't even mentioned . 
  though we had locomotive classes `` \u0474 '' and `` \u0472 '' till 1950-s . 
  in 1918 there was a reform that changed our language drastically . 
  * letters \u0462 , \u0472 and \u0406 were excluded from the alphabet . 
  * prefixes that end with `` \u0437 '' \u2192 end with `` \u0441 '' if the root starts with the voiceless consonant . 
  * just like in bulgarian we used to have \u042a on the end of every word that end with consonant . 
  the reform dropped it . 
  * ( in the genitive and accusative cases of adjectives and participles ) endings `` - \u0430\u0433\u043e '' \u2192 `` - \u0435\u0433\u043e '' or `` - \u043e\u0433\u043e '' . 
  * ( in the nominative and accusative cases of adjectives of feminine and neuter genders ) endings `` - \u044b\u044f '' and `` - i\u044f '' \u2192 `` - \u044b\u0435 '' and `` - \u0438\u0435 '' . 
  * there were word for the feminine form of `` they '' and the plural feminine form for the adjective `` one '' : `` \u043e\u043d\u0463 '' and `` \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0463 '' . 
  they changed to `` \u043e\u043d\u0438 '' and `` \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438 '' ( just like regular plural forms ) instead of `` \u043e\u043d\u0435 '' and `` \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0435 '' . 
  in 1934 `` \u0419 '' was included in the alphabet .
