in russia , we call them '' \u043f\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0446\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0451\u0432\u044b\u0435 '' because right before presidential elections in 2012 those who had been hired by united russia party got paid fifteen rubles per post . 
   probably because of that , he appeared on putin 's hitlist . 
  your country is n't that relevant, 
  \\  president flying on the old soviet plane that by the time was out of service even in russia \\  with bulk of his government \\  despite bad weather what can possibly go wrong ? 
  ah , right , it 's guided putin 's trees . 
   as i already said , an autonomous republic of crimea , an integral part of ukraine . 
  right , right . 
   if i have to explain you would n't understand . 
  it worth reading anyway and if you happen to read it sometime , pay attention to what sasha said to rorshach in response to his question about her father . 
  thanks a lot , i 'll check it out . 
   you feel insulted ? 
  cry me another river then . 
  crimea what ? 
   did you happen to read `` blindsight '' by peter watts ? 
  no i did not , can you give me a sneak peak ? 
   doing what exactly ? 
  insulting people , pushing your government 's agenda no matter how absurd it is . 
   that 's not of your business at all . 
  so , you totally not hiding from mobilization ? 
  have you received your draft notice ? 
  wow , what a words . 
  are you doing that voluntarily or getting paid ? 
  if not , why would n't you join the ukrainian military and take part in reclaiming your lost territories yourself ? 
  what ? 
  crimea river ? 
  too bad reddit does n't ban for that kind of comments . 
  \\  about the shit hole that is russia . 
  so why do you guys still using other evil communist soviet npps and not burning kizyaks instead ? 
  yokels ca n't into economy , that 's why . 
  but you 'll always blame your eastern neighbor because it makes your yokel government look better in the eyes of yokel population . 
  you . 
  have my upvote . 
  read . 
  article . 
  again . 
  the part about personnel resigned refers to similar flyby in april 2014 when russian jet allegedly disabled ship 's aegis system using ecm . 
  ... and then you woke up in the classroom with your pants full of shite . 
  kek , nice censorship . 
   funny that 70 years after war ended we still have revisionists . 
  yeah , about that ... 
   russians are maniacs who likes to kill . 
  \\  hoorah-patriotic volunteers \\  special forces  to take what ? 
  commie blocks ? 
  factories ? 
  how ? 
  demolish everything except your cool old buildings , take everything valuable that was brought in ( you know , ussr pumped a lot of money to make you a `` showcase of socialism '' ) , leave you with your independence . 
   oh yes we begged our way to usrr !, 
  [ sure you do !, 
   sends innocent russians to die in ukrainian `` civil war '' hoorah-patriotic volunteers who ready to kill for their beliefs and special forces are not the ones i can call `` innocent '' . 
   and soviet occupation was terrible ... maybe it was , maybe is was not . 
  i just think that when soviets let you go they should 've taken everything they made with them . 
  maybe , including russian population . 
   difference is that ukrainian citizens realized in what hell they 're living while russians still live in delusion while shouting `` glorious russia !, 
  ura ! '', 
  if you see someone in russia shouting that in some public gatherings they either paid ( usually 500-1000 rubles , so people with low-paid jobs , pensioners or students ) or forced by their employer . 
  average person in russia was always somewhere in the middle . 
   what bases ? 
  we need to beg ... just like baltics '' [ begged ] ( http://cdn.topwar.ru/uploads/previews/2011-04/0b166_4053_640x480.jpg ) '' to join ussr ? 
  please , do n't be ridiculous . 
   we - people of reddit , love reading bullsh * t. \\  russia is evil !, 
  \\  putin is literally hitler !, 
  \\  muh soviet occupation !, 
  \\  russia needs to be back in 90s !, 
  \\  glorious chechen ~ ~ jihadists ~ ~ freedom fighters fought oppressive russian regime !, 
  \\  ukraine is civilized european country and pinnacle of democracy !, 
  \\  thanks usa for ~ ~ occupation ~ ~ setting your bases in my country !, 
  that 's summary of comments section in this sub and it checks out . 
  oh , i would n't be so sure . 
   hopefully baltic states will get real independence from eu at some point, 
  why ? 
  that genocide started in late 80s - early 90s . 
  and let 's not forget genocide of russians in chechnya in 90s . 
   one of the lines russia has been pushing hard of late is that katyn massacre was done by germany source ? 
  mandatory military conscription existed and still exist in ussr , ukraine and russia , so there can be plenty of ex-operators who are natives , mercenaries or volunteers . 
  damn , it 's like i play mgsv all over again . 
  every country in eastern europe that constantly cries about evil russia . 
  it 's funny that they still use ~ ~ soviet ~ ~ - russian-occupational-liberator-uncivilized-barbarian-rifles . 
  \\  russia should be prosecuted \\  turkiye that 's even more hilarious than if it was said by someone from butthurt belt . 
  because what ukraine can do is to pretend it 's killing `` thousands of russian troops '' in donbass while being afraid to actually fight them in crimea . 
  so much for maidan . 
  still catching up with ukrainian media . 
  at least belarus ' army is n't that fucked up as ukrainian one . 
  [ and ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siberia_airlines_flight_1812 ) , although they admitted it . 
  you forgot dismemberment , and gibbing . 
  so what ? 
  i know that our state tv is rubbish , but i ca n't figure out what 's wrong with this image . 
  good job . 
   i 'm sure it 's accidental . 
  the ignorance is strong in this one . 
   two wrongs do n't make a right, 
   millions of domestic slaves, 
  well , there 's been a war in iraq over nonexistent wmds , bombing of libya for nothing , and support of insurgency in syria , again for nothing . 
   they are liars , we ca n't trust them at any level , we ca n't be partners , russia 's trainings are justified , there is no guarantee that us government wants peace . 
  i was n't talking about russian-only officials . 
  which ones can be trusted then ? 
  neither is us or china , india , pakistan , israel and south korea . 
  is your username a grau index though ? 
  it 's a very old saying . 
  nowadays , russia 's allies are just it 's nukes . 
  it 's 21st century , winter would n't stop nukes .
