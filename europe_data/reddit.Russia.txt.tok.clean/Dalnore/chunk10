  i 'll cite the school book by levandovsky ( for the 11th grade ) , which was used in my school . 
  you can google it if you want , as you know russian . 
  i 'll give my own translation , i hope it is good enough . 
  i 'll refrain from opinions , just direct citations . 
   is it called `` occupation '' or `` liberation '' of baltic states in russian history books that are studied in school ? 
  page 181 . 
   in september-october 1939 , the stalinist leadership imposed on estonia , latvia and lithuania `` mutual assistance agreements '' , under the terms of which they provided the ussr with their military bases . 
  the following year , `` elections '' were held in the seimas of lithuania and latvia and the state council of estonia . 
  candidates nominated by the communist parties and audited by the soviet special services participated in them . 
  the parliaments elected in this way applied for admission of their countries to the ussr . 
  in august 1940 this request was granted , and the ussr was replenished with three new `` socialist republics '' . 
  neither `` occupation '' nor `` liberation '' is used . 
  --  do they mention deportations ? 
  same page , 181 . 
   the newly acquired lands faced `` socialist transformations '' similar to those that were conducted in the ussr at the turn of the 1920s -- 1930s . 
  they were accompanied by terror and deportation of large numbers of people to siberia . 
  the answer is yes , it is briefly mentioned . 
  --  what russian pupils study about molotov-ribbentrop pact in school ? 
  page 179 . 
   in mid-august 1939 , stalin made his choice . 
  on august 23 , the day after the end of the sluggish military negotiations with britain and france , in moscow , molotov and german foreign minister ribbentrop signed a nonaggression pact and a secret additional protocol to it on the division of spheres of influence in eastern europe . 
  according to the latter , berlin recognized latvia , estonia , finland , the eastern part of poland and bessarabia as the sphere of influence of the soviet union . 
  in september 1939 this list was supplemented by lithuania . 
  --  what is called a main reason for famine in ukraine in 32-33 ? 
  page 161 :  the agriculture of the ussr , weakened by forced collectivization , in 1932-1933 , suffered from a great tragedy : hunger . 
  there was a drought and , as a result , a crop failure . 
  but the government , through the collective farms , continued steadily to pump out the main wealth-grain ( grain of different cultures ) from the main grain regions of the country , leaving nothing to the collective farmers for their own food . 
  bread went to the foreign market and was converted to the currency needed to purchase modern equipment for industrial giants under construction . 
  as a result , from 7.5 to 10 million people perished from hunger : russians , ukrainians , kazakhs . 
  yet the bolshevik leaders , who professed the old principle `` the end justifies the means '' , celebrated another victory . 
  two reasons are cited : drought and policy of the ussr government . 
  i can answer about molotov -- ribbentrop . 
  the secret protocol , according to which eastern poland and the baltic countries became the soviet sphere of influence , is definitely taught in schools . 
  other things i do n't remember well , school was 10 years ago . 
  i can try to look up our school book when i return from work . 
   a good king terrorizes the nobles and oligarchs into treating the commoners well . 
   putin is a good king . 
  those two statements seem to really contradict each other . 
  you might need to swap `` nobles and oligarchs '' and `` commoners '' .

  sputnik has an article in english mentioning this , but i do n't want to link to sputnik . 
   what does banning mean in this context ? 
   he just blocked navalny from commenting on his posts this . 
  considering the link is dated nov 2014 , those are likely ukrainian soldiers who defended the airport at that time . 
  actually , i 've got an impression from traveling to estonia , latvia , and czechia ( but not from austria ) that people there have much older cars than russians and just do n't care about them being old . 
  though i do n't have any statistical data . 
  there are definitely a lot more black suvs in russia . 
   there are literally two type of cars on the road , 20 years old ladas and tank-sized luxury suvs i very rarely see either of them . 
  an average car i see is a less-that-10-year-old low - or mid-tier foreign car . 
  at this moment , looking out of the window , i see a brand new kia rio , a ~ 10 y.o. 
  hyundai accent , a 4-y.o. 
  lada priora , and my 8 y.o. 
  i 'm in a large city , though . 
  that 's actually a terrible idea . 
  first , a significant chunk of russia 's territory on this map now belongs to ukraine and belarus . 
  second , this map is from the period when russia did n't exist yet , the country should be called kievan rus ' . 
  it 's a common ancestor of russia , ukraine , and belarus . 
  the saddest thing about this law is that children are the ones who suffer the most from its consequences . 
  i mean gay children . 
  they already live in a society which is very harsh towards them , they might fear to come out even to their families . 
  there is a non-profit organisation , [ children-404 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/children-404 ) . 
  they provide psychological help and information about homosexuality/bisexuality/transgenderism to support lgbt kids ; they also give them a social platform to share their experience and thoughts ( either anonymously or not ) . 
  as a consequence of this law , the founder of this organization has once been fined for 50000 rub ( ~ 2 average monthly salaries in russia ) , their site and their vk group have been banned . 
  there currently is a new vk group , it is available at the moment , but who knows when it might repeat . 
  most of those people do n't think the collapse was inevitable . 
  they blame it either on a group of politicians ( eltsin and others ) or on a foreign plot . 
  not that many would like to actually restore it . 
  that 's still the best source we can have . 
  the [ poll ] ( http://www.levada.ru/2016/12/05/raspad-sssr-prichiny-i-nostalgiya/ ) referenced in the article ( in russian ) . 
   why the perception of there being more mutual distrust and bitterness in the world ( when before we had the iron curtain ) ? 
  i think the poll implied `` mutual distrust and bitterness '' in the former ussr , not the world . 
  it is not mentioned in the poll , but that would be my assumption if i were polled . 
   also , `` 53 percent said that they missed the unified economic system '' - how did the transition work out/didn ' t work out ? 
  i think the translation is correct . 
  planned economy had many drawbacks , but the 90s brought complete economic collapse , so people regret this system fell . 
  this zhirinovsky 's son stays true to his family . 
  god , this colormap is awful . 
  i know . 
  i 'm talking about putin 's approval . 
  the 2014 surge in it is directly linked to the annexation of crimea ( rather than to the war in the donetsk and luhansk regions ) . 
  ** electrotyping ** ( moritz von jacobi ) ** arc welding ** ( nikolai benardos ) ** periodic table ** ( dmitri mendeleev ) ** electric tram ** ( fyodor pirotsky ) ** led ** ( oleg losev ) ** tokamak ** ( igor tamm , andrei sakharov , lev artsimovich ) ** kalashnikov ** ( mikhail kalashnikov . 
  not the first assault rifle , but the most popular ) ** tetris ** ( alexey pajitnov ), 
  to crimea , if to be more precise . 
  russia is not a proper democracy . 
  in authoritarian countries , governments do n't reflect the opinion of people , they create it . 
   russians are happy those ones have to be drunk . 
  other than what / u/mad _ programmer already said , as a government official , medvedev is n't allowed to have any kind of business . 
  the video shows medvedev 's ties to vineyards in russia and italy and also mentions several bills supporting the vine industry and promoted by him , which seems like lobbying for personal benefit . 
  the poll was more about national pride and national shame , i presume . 
  e.g. , 83 % are proud of winning in the great patriotic war . 
  most of those people were n't born yet back then . 
  i do n't see this happening any time soon , unfortunately . 
  it 's mostly the same old `` look how many things the ussr has built in the baltic countries , those ungrateful bastards '' and `` it 's the american propaganda fault that they dislike us '' . 
  and , with all recent events and the resurrection of the `` us vs them '' mentality , it currently does n't seem to get better . 
  not acknowledging the wrongdoings of our past is a huge mistakes . 
  but i ca n't understand this disregard of the repressions at all . 
  even if to be really self-centered and ignore all other nations that suffered , the soviet repressions are easily one of the worst things that happened to the russian nation itself . 
  millions were directly affected , yet it is ignored . 
  only 22 % are ashamed of the soviet repressions . 
  that 's rather sad .
