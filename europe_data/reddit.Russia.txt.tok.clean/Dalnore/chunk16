  but not only . 
  there are many other dictatorships over there . 
  even in europe , there is belarus . 
  where is my season 2 ... 
   russia is more european than ukraine by almost all objective criteria except the one that actually matters : ukraine is fully located in europe !, 
  to answer the question `` how exactly were his actions illegal ? '', 
  do i need to support the actions of the police to provide such information ? 
  wtf, 
  for example , [ this link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/rudrugs/comments/1derq9/%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d0%b8_%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%b6%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b4_%d0%b2%d1%8b%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%89%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f_%d0%bf%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%bb%d0%be%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%b1%d1%8b/ ) about growing psilocybes is not available to me without a proxy . 
  there was a [ huge thread ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3grpdf/tifu_by_getting_reddit_banned_in_russia/ ) when the whole reddit was blocked due to this link . 
  after that , the reddit 's administration banned this link in russia . 
  who knows . 
  reddit already blocks some content for russian users upon requests from roskomnadzor after it has been blocked for not doing so . 
  no , you remember it wrong . 
  he actually had a coordinated with authorities protest on sakharova as he wanted . 
  but a day before the protest he wrote in his blog that all potential contractors refused to install stage and sound at the protest location . 
  due to that he suddenly declared that the protest will be held not on sakharova , but on tverskaya ( which , of course , was n't coordinated with authorities ) . 
  and , to be honest , even as his mild supporter , i think it was a dick move of him , because there was an actual festival of reconstruction ( not some imaginary protest ) at tverskaya this day . 
  btw , my story was also about a navalny-related protest , but not in moscow . 
   that sounds like a permission to me - asking if i can protest on this day , in this place , at this time again , technically , they have to give you a good reason why you can not have a protest where you want . 
  but they find a way to come with some bullshit like `` oh , you know , there actually already is a different protest at this very place and this very time , sorry . 
  it begins at 7 am and ends at 10 pm , so we ca n't even suggest you a different time on the same day '' ( a real story from my own city , btw ) . 
  of course , this protest does n't have to exist in reality . 
   as much as i recall you have to ask for a permission to protest somewhat . 
  technically , it 's not a permission ( as there are many limitations to refusing a protest ; they have to give you alternative date and/or place for a protest if they refuse to approve the one you 're proposing ) , but in reality , when it comes to opposition rallies , it frequently acts as permission . 
  however , for a single picket , you do not need a permission . 
  i 'm not saying i like this law . 
  but if you want to consider legislation , his actions are indeed illegal under our country 's laws . 
   how exactly were his actions illegal ? 
  from a legal perspective , law 54-\u0424\u0417 article 8 part 2 prohibits picketing on territories outside courts . 
  `` disobedience '' is likely made up as usual . 
  as a person from this age range , i just can not imagine how it is possible to do nothing . 
  i 've been studying for 18 years already , and working since the age of 17 , and i frequently think that i 'm not efficient with my time and i should learn more things . 
  this is why we need end-to-end encryption . 
  also , your experience might depend on where you have been ; moscow and st. petersburg are typically more expensive than more provincial places , especially in services . 
  this map does n't show actual numbers . 
  estonia and russia have the same color , but estonia may be closer to $ 2k while russia closer to $ 1k . 
  thugs are usually not the most clever and knowledgeable people . 
  red , white and blue present ? 
  russian flag checks out . 
  there are people in russia who can mistake the dutch flag for the russian one . 
   there will be no russian walking on polish soil note to self : rent a bicycle when in poland . 
  good cheese is a threat to russian sovereignty !, 
  unlike differentiation , calculating integrals frequently involves guessing a good substitution , using residuals , and other not just technical approaches which require some sort of mathematical intuition . 
  which is not a good way to teach integrals , to be honest . 
   bmw it is more likely to be 90s . 
  old european cars flooded the market back then . 
  [ mavrodi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sergei_mavrodi ) created his financial pyramid in 1989 , it was very popular in the 90s . 
  i do n't have debts or rent either , but i typically spend at least $ 300 a month , so it 's hard for me to imagine living on just $ 150 . 
  belarus is probably cheaper then my city , though . 
  current minimum wage in russia is [ 7800 rub/month ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9c%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b7%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%80_%d0%be%d0%bf%d0%bb%d0%b0%d1%82%d1%8b_%d1%82%d1%80%d1%83%d0%b4%d0%b0_%d0%b2_%d0%a0%d0%be%d1%81%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%b8 ) . 
  it is equal to ~ $ 126/month or ~ $ 0.77 / hour ( assuming typical 168 hours/month ) . 
  i would consider a person earning that little extremely poor . 
  poland has 580.7 k hectares of land under organic farming , which constitutes 4.03 % of all land used for agriculture . 
  thus , poland has ~ 14517.5 k hectares of farmland . 
  for italy , the numbers are 1492.6 k and 12.34 % , respectively , resulting in ~ 12095.6 k hectares of farmland . 
  so , according to this data , poland has a little bit more farmland . 
  which one do you use ? 
  i 've checked in the oxford dictionary ( [ link ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/race ) ) , it says :  race  1.2 a group of people sharing the same culture , history , language , etc. 
  ; an ethnic group . 
   100 ruble notes do you think they know such small banknotes exist ? 
  publishing papers is easy . 
  publishing them in a reputable journal is not . 
   800 $ / month for 4 years holy shit , that 's even worse than what i 've got as a phd student in russia . 
  not only greece , same in russia . 
  attributing homosexuality to being brought up in a family without a father is not uncommon . 
  the criminal investigation by jit is still under way , we might learn more details in the future . 
  however , i doubt that it will be possible to punish those who are responsible . 
   pokemon go i 'll just leave it there : https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/11/pokemon-go-russian-youtuber-convicted-playing-church-ruslan-sokolovsky, 
  wtf i just watched . 
  our tv always finds ways to surprise me with new levels of bullshit . 
  i do not like the title as , technically , homosexuality is not a disease in russia since it officially complies with icd-10 . 
  other than that , it 's definitely a sad state of affairs . 
  damn , i 've been to portoferraio but have n't visited this place . 
  maybe next time . 
  i wonder how many things named after him i can say right off the top of my head ... lorentz force , lorentz transformations , lorentz -- lorenz formula , lorentz -- fitzgerald contraction . 
   they did n't really care about homosexuality male homosexual acts were considered a crime in the su , punishable by up to 5 years in prison . 
  courier delivery is possible , but it has additional cost and can negate the advantage of buying online in many cases . 
  it 's usually used for expensive things like electronics . 
   except that homosexuality is nature as well . 
  is n't that exactly what i was saying ? 
  online purchases could be better if i did n't have to receive my shipments at a post office . 
  waiting in a queue full of pensioners paying their utility bills is really discouraging . 
  it 's not `` behavior '' , it 's nature . 
  you can not promote homosexuality . 
  i know , my grandmother was just 1 year older than tanya savicheva , she had to cancel her education after 4 grades and went to a factory . 
  by the time of wwii , basic education was compound in the soviet union . 
  it was different back then , but handwriting was paid much more attention to than today . 
  calligraphy was even a separate subject , it was removed from curriculum in the 70s . 
   the letter \u044f , which is the trickiest letter to write in russian cyrillic alphabet , is written super properly , above the level of a 3rd grade kid wtf ? 
  not capital '' \u0410 '' , '' \u0416 '' , '' \u041a '' , not '' \u043d '' , '' \u0449 '' , not different links after '' \u043e '' , but '' \u044f '' ? 
  and i 'm fairly sure kids in 3rd grade are already able to write all cyrillic letters and probably have better cursive than most adults do as they are taught cursive at the very beginning of the 1st grade , and many adults just do n't care already . 
  her handwriting is n't even good , including this \u044f . 
  i used to have one in my apartment . 
  it had continuous water flaw regulated by a valve , which was incredibly convenient for washing shoes . 
  yes , we could use more federalization and decentralization . 
   the people do n't even elect governors actually , since 2012 , we again directly elect governors . 
   technically one can be sentenced to death in russia this is explicitly prohibited by the 2009 decision of the constitutional court . 
   their constitution allows it that 's actually debatable . 
  our constitution states that `` death sentence can be applied * up to its abolition * '' .
