  some people , including the head of the presidential humans right council , argue that death sentence has already been effectively abolished and thus is unconstitutional , therefore it can not be returned without changes to the constitution . 
   just so that you know , these allegedly executed people were allegedly former isis militants who came back from syria & iraq to chechnya could you point to the source ? 
  i think it is n't mentioned in the article . 
  when i wanted to swim this summer , i did n't mean * this * . 
  that 's not a scientific way of thinking . 
  we actually still do n't know why some people are gay , and there is no scientific consensus on how much it is influenced by biology and how much by environment . 
  we only know that the orientation is already established at least by the time of puberty and can not be changed . 
  for example , twin studies reveal that identical twins are more likely to have the same orientation , which indicates a big role of biology . 
  at the same time , not all identical twins have the same orientation , which indicates that genetics is not the only cause . 
  i would say that spinoza 's ideas are atheistic rather than deistic . 
   atheistic deist that 's impossible . 
  deism , by definition , assumes the belief in a deity that created our universe . 
  atheism rejects existence of any deities , both affecting and non-affecting the universe . 
  deism and atheism are similar only in the way they reject supernatural . 
   atheists `` know '' that there is no god . 
   agnostics `` do n't know '' whether there is a god . 
  that 's not true . 
  i 'm both an atheist ( i.e. , i do not believe in any gods ) and an agnostic ( i.e. , i do n't think it is possible to rationally disprove the existence of gods ) . 
  the ussr had an enormous stockpile of nuclear weapons . 
  the fact that the humanity still exists means that it was n't the worst way possible . 
  the aftermath might have been really bad , but i 'm immensely happy that i do not live in the soviet union , even in its latest version ( the stalin 's version is pretty much one of the worst states ever existed ) . 
  a country which denies its own citizens a right to travel abroad ; where simply buying foreign currency is a crime ; where the star wars trilogy , scorpion , pink floyd , ac/dc , etc are considered harmful is just pathetic . 
  the tsar , yes . 
  but i do n't think his murdered children ( including a 13 y.o. 
  son ) were that much to blame . 
  i do n't think they 'll find many gays this way . 
  having genital and buttocks tattoos is pretty extravagant . 
  i do n't know if this is present in your country , but here , quite a few people may call a person ` faggot ' just for long hair/tight jeans/an earring . 
  i had medical examination at military recruitment offices three times and i did n't have such checks . 
   can provide a medical certificate proving that they are sodomites wtf are they talking about ? 
  when did he admit ( except for crimea ) ? 
  i do n't follow putin and am surprised he could say something like that . 
  why are you asking * me * this ? 
  i 'm just commenting in a thread in which this comparison already exists . 
  you said `` a couple of superhigh buildings for the rich few with endless sea of poverty all around '' . 
  the whole moscow is definitely not `` sea of poverty '' . 
  so what ? 
  laws always use the full name of the country . 
  `` russia '' is widely used everywhere else and is a legitimate official name of the country , and you 're are saying `` there is no such thing '' , which is complete bullshit . 
  it 's like saying `` belarus '' does n't exist because `` republic of belarus '' is used in all laws . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) ( please correct me if this data is wrong ) , the average wage in estonia is $ 1,153 . 
  the average wage in moscow is 69,000 rub or $ 1,036 ( [ source ] ( http://tass.ru/moskva/3733550 ) ) . 
  the cost of living in estonia is probably a little bit higher as well ( assuming you do n't rent a flat , as they are really expensive in moscow ) . 
  moscow is just way more wealthy than russia as a whole . 
   usage of `` russia '' in official documents is an anecdote dude , i have `` russia '' written in my foreign passport in the `` place of birth '' field . 
  is it official enough ? 
   i 'm not sure whether your assertion is correct just open our [ constitution ] ( http://www.constitution.ru/10003000/10003000-3.htm ) and read the very first article . 
  being forced into a relationship with a person you do not love because of a traditionalist society is also a problem . 
  if they are not murdered or persecuted , it does n't mean that they do n't have other problems . 
  homophobia is still an issue in many countries . 
  inability to have a registered family and adopt children is also not a ` first world problem ' . 
  `` russia '' and `` russian federation '' are equivalent official names of the country as per the constitution . 
  no , the question was `` name 10 ( ! ), 
  most prominent figures of all times and nations '' . 
  the number of surnames requested is important . 
  i explained you why it might be expected to be dominated by natives of your country . 
  your conclusion does n't follow from the averaged data at all , you 'll have to look into individual answers for that , which are not provided . 
  it is easy to construct a set in which every single russian names just 3-4 russian surnames out of 10 , but the result is the same as in the poll . 
  you would have a valid point only if the question was to name 5 or less surnames , not 10 . 
  for 10 , you have insufficient data . 
  you ca n't draw such conclusions from this poll . 
  i think it might happen purely due to statistics , and the results would be somewhat similar in other big countries . 
  you 're given a task to recall ten surnames of prominent historic figures . 
  ten people is quite a few , you 'll probably have a couple of immediate answers and then start thinking who to add . 
  naturally , you 're more likely to recall famous people from your country because you know them better . 
  then , there are a lot more famous foreign historic figures , so the foreign people chosen by different polled individuals are less likely to overlap , resulting in lower percentage for all foreigners . 
  is the ethnicity important ? 
  catherine the great was ethnically german , but she was russian . 
  do n't know how to translate soviet term narod i think it is usually translated to `` people '' . 
  soviet people . 
  i think there is a general consensus that the causes of the famine were n't solely natural . 
  russia itself [ denounced ] ( https://duma.consultant.ru/documents/955838?items=1 ) the actions of the soviet authorities . 
  a few lines from the document :  as a result of a famine caused by forced collectivization many regions of rsfsr , kazakhstan , ukraine , belarus suffered . 
   < ...  the ussr authorities used repressive measures to ensure grain procurements , which significantly aggravated the hard consequences of harvest failure  the deputies of the state duma < ...  strongly condemn the regime which neglected the lives of people in order to achieve economic and political goals . 
  am i out of the loop and all of this have been proven wrong ? 
  i would translate the question as `` name the ten most outstanding/prominent historical figures of all times and nations '' . 
  i think those who answered assumed mostly positive influence ( at least i would ) . 
  also , it 's funny that the list of `` most outstanding historical figures of all * times and nations * '' has only three foreigners , but it 's expected due to statistics . 
  prominent foreign historic figures are less likely to be recalled by many people at once because there is a large pool of them , while there are less russians and they are more well-known to russians . 
  there is absolutely no justification for what happened under stalin . 
  there can be no goal worth of millions of lifes . 
   unintended famines  unintended really ? 
  the soviet famine of 1932 -- 33 ( which holodomor is a part of ) was n't unintended . 
  the poll used the word '' \u0432\u044b\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439\u0441\u044f '' , which is closer to `` outstanding '' or `` prominent '' than to `` great '' . 
  it still has some positive connotations , but not as much as '' \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 '' ( great ) . 
  i think i can technically call stalin or hitler '' \u0432\u044b\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439\u0441\u044f '' ( after all , they were exceptional at killing millions of people ) , but i would refrain from doing so nonetheless . 
  i also think that those who answered the poll meant it in a positive way . 
  the internal passport should be though of as a strange version of an id card with some additional information . 
  we do n't really need it to travel internally , any identification ( e.g. , driving license ) just in case is enough if you travel on your own , unless you need to buy long-range train or airline tickets . 
  but i guess it 's impossible to buy airline tickets without an id in most if not all countries . 
  technically , you 're not obliged to have any identification documents with you at all , but it 's better to have at least something because the police can demand them if they `` have sufficient grounds to suspect you might be a criminal '' which allows for very broad interpretation . 
  i agree , moscow is very different in many aspects . 
  there is still `` place of registration '' , but it has n't been a permit since 1991 . 
  you have to notify authorities of where you live and of your movements within some time . 
  if you do n't do that , you can be fined , but it 's not prohibitive . 
  there are two types of registration : permanent and temporary . 
  the permanent one is reflected in the internal passport ( national id ) , some social services are bound to it , and you can have only one place of permanent registration at a time . 
  the temporary is easily made when you move to any other place ( hotel , living with your relatives in another city for some time , etc ) . 
  you can move to moscow , rent a flat and temporary register it as your place of living and you 'll be a moscow resident completely legally . 
  however , you either have to own property or persuade the owners of that property ( maybe just give them money ) to change your permanent registration .
