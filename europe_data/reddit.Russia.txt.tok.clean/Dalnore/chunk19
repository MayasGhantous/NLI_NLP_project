  they did n't have that until now . 
  liquid helium is usually measured in liters . 
  and it 's several times more expensive than liquid nitrogen ( which is dirt cheap , 50 cents per liter or something like that ) . 
  my institute buys plenty of both . 
  i think the headline has a mistake . 
  she 's not a `` ukrainian librarian '' ( i believe she does n't have ukrainian citizenship ) , she is an ex-head of the ukrainian literature library in moscow . 
  as far a i know , greek \u03c6 usually transforms into `` ph '' in latin/english . 
  humongous hard-on collider ? 
  that 's not what i was hoping for when choosing to be a physicist ... 
  the worst offender for me is hearthstone . 
  they have a fancy serif font for nicknames , but use arial when the letters in the nickname are cyrillic . 
  considering they have the same fancy font in cyrillic for everything else in the game ( like card names , etc ) , it really irritates me . 
  good , blasphemy laws have no place in secular states . 
  because a lot of countries in the world have worse conditions ? 
  the us is # 43 on the `` societal safety '' list , behind most european countries ( germany is # 17 , btw ) . 
  but the us is still a very developed country , it just can not be low at the global scale . 
  [ global horizontal irradiation map ] ( http://solargis.com/assets/graphic/free-map/ghi/solargis-world-ghi-solar-resource-map-en.png ) . 
  mostly due to high latitudes , we are not the best country to invest into solar power . 
  also , there is large difference of power output between summer and winter also due to high latitude . 
  however , with rising efficiency of solar panels , we could definitely use them to save electricity and provide heat during summer though . 
  [ global wind map ] ( http://www.vaisala.com/vaisala%20documents/scientific%20papers/vaisala_global_wind_map.pdf ) . 
  again , unlike the northern coast of europe , for example , we do not have particularly strong winds in many places . 
  not all of them , according to the article . 
   human rights advocates and the lgbt-community activists have repeatedly complained about violence on part of these groups . 
  according to tymur levchuk , an executive director of the ` fulcrum ' lgbt-organization , in 2015 , the organization 's staff filed as many as 15 appeals to the public defender , with subsequent transfer to the police , with regard to video records featuring violence against the individuals whom the group members referred to as ` pedophiles and gays ' . 
  however , in his words , the cases either were not launched at all , or were closed due to lack of evidence . 
  she does n't sound pleasant , but it 's not a threat . 
  if he goes to chechnya after being invited personally by zakharova , his safety there is pretty much guaranteed , as any kind of incident would make an immense diplomatic scandal . 
  i think foreign journalists have a very low chance of being murdered . 
  they are more likely to be refused entry to some places , or to be detained and deported . 
   that should give you some indication where we really are  based on surveys from visitors of this website that 's not a good source of information . 
  by [ homicide rate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ) , russia is n't very high . 
  they have three different metrics : `` militarization '' , `` societal safety '' , `` involvement in domestic and international conflicts '' . 
  the us is placed very low on the first one , fairly high on the second one , and somewhere below the middle on the third one . 
  the third one seems questionable though . 
  e.g. , they are placed right above belarus , which is strange considering i do n't remember belarus being in any kind of a conflict . 
  visa free regime for ukraine is n't in power yet . 
   in other words we should make them non-citizens if ukrainian citizenship is their only citizenship , it violates article 15 of unhr and is directly prohibited by article 7.3 of the european convention on nationality ( ratified by ukraine ) . 
  no it 's not . 
  yandex.bar ( or yandex.elements ) you 're talking about is indeed shitty and hated by the it community , but they have plenty of good services and have successfully competed with google on the local market . 
  e.g. , their traffic app is better than google 's one for russia ( maybe for ukraine too ) . 
  yandex.market does n't have any competition whatsoever . 
  they have the most convenient app for local trains . 
  and many other things . 
  `` rossijane '' is for citizens of russia , regardless of their ethnicity . 
  thus it can not be used for an ethnic group . 
  we studied meters at school , they are on curriculum . 
  for many verses , it 's easy to detect the meter it uses , but not for the translation of hamlet i read . 
   russians felt some inconveniences do you really dare use such language ? 
  `` some inconveniences '' my ass . 
  i know well that ukrainians suffered a lot but it in no way justifies your neglect of russian victims . 
  we study literature from 5th through 11th grades . 
  foreign literature usually starts from ancient greek myths and middle east fairy tales and becomes more serious to the end . 
  why do * i * need to compare ? 
  you claimed that russians have suffered in `` incomprehensible , mystical way '' , which is quite disrespectful towards the actual russian victims of stalin 's terror . 
  i personally have not claimed that ukrainians suffered less or something like that . 
   your psychologically comfortable denialism what ?!, 
  what exactly do i deny ? 
   they `` also suffered '' . 
  somehow . 
  in some incomprehensible , mystical way the way is entirely comprehensible , hundreds of thousands of russians were repressed during the stalin 's terror , many were killed . 
  according to levada 's [ survey ] ( http://www.levada.ru/2017/05/23/stalinskie-repressii/ ) , every fifth russian has had a family member who suffered from the repression . 
  what i can not understand , though , is how people still defend the soviet union , especially the stalin 's period . 
  while we do n't have a full picture of what was going on , we know those things . 
  a journalist alexander minkin shoot him on video three weeks ago praising his street activity . 
  obviously , he assumed the boy was n't a beggar . 
  also , the boy does n't look like a beggar , he is tidy and has good clothes . 
  so it does n't seem like begging to me from the information i have , at least with certainty . 
  even the police has cancelled the protocol and issued an apology already . 
  we study both russian and foreign literature at school . 
  of course there are way more russian authors , but likes of dante , shakespeare , byron , goethe , london , poe , henry and some others are part of mandatory reading curriculum . 
  it is also assumed that children will read way more , many pieces of foreign literature are advised for extracurricular reading . 
  i think it is important to have a grasp of global culture . 
  there are dozens of russian hamlet translations . 
  i looked at the one i learned at school , but i can not easily detect the foot it uses , it 's a little bit irregular . 
  de jure it is , but russia is n't able to fully control it . 
  kadyrov gets money and ability to do almost whatever he wants in chechnya in exchange for staying loyal to putin . 
  in 2015 , there was a story when the police from stavropol shot a man ( who was on the federal wanted list ) in chechnya . 
  after that kadyrov said that , if police forces from other regions ever act in chechnya again without his approval , they will be killed . 
  we learned the `` to be , or not to be '' monologue by heart at school ( in russian , ofc ) . 
  i believe `` romeo and juliet '' and `` hamlet '' are mandatory for all schools . 
  holding hands and kissing in public is not forbidden in russia . 
  this only can get you into trouble because of homophobic people . 
  it 's somewhere near odessa , right ? 
  looks really cool . 
  i like an old paz serving as its head . 
  ai cups are very different in nature , as the strategies are developed over a rather long period of time . 
  in icpc , your team has only 5 hours to solve 10 problems without using any external resources . 
  it tests teamwork , proficiency in algorithms and mathematics , and ability to quickly produce correct and fast code . 
  regarding international ai competitions , i can recommend [ student starcraft ai tournament ] ( http://sscaitournament.com/ ) and other similar tournaments . 
  it does n't have new rules each year , so there is no `` surprise value '' , but the bots have become quite complex over the years . 
  and the games between the bots are live 24/7 on twitch . 
  great !, 
  also grats to the university of warsaw for the 2nd place !, 
  6 out of 12 medals go to europe ( 4 russia , 1 poland , 1 sweden ) . 
  the complete results table is [ here ] ( https://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/results ) . 
  before the mongols , kievan rus ' was entirely european by definition . 
  all of it was located in europe, 
  this chronicle is younger than the laurentian codex . 
  it seems its scans are n't publicly available , unfortunately .
