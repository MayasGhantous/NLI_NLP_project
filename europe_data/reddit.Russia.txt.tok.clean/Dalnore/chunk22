  second , the ussr never considered itself fully communist , but socialist instead . 
  the ussr has always been in the state of `` building of communism '' until its eventual collapse . 
  your comment is rather funny considering marx has introduced the concept of practice into gnoseology in order to fight hegel 's idealism , and this is one of his main achievements in philosophy . 
  not all [ msms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/men_who_have_sex_with_men ) are gay . 
  damn , i really want an actual copy of this book to see how things have changed . 
  back in the days when i was a schoolkid , these elections in the baltic states were described as rigged in my textbook . 
  well , he is one of the ministers , he helps them run . 
   here is the [ article ] in question . 
  it 's called `` 15 facts about banderovtsy , or what kremlin is silent about '' . 
  it 's a pro-bandera ukrainian nationalist polemic . 
  he has been fined explicitly for the statements about the attack of the ussr and germany on poland , not the other parts of the article about bandera , so they are not relevant . 
  however , the statement in the article is not accurate , it states that the ussr and germany attacked together on september 1 , while in fact the ussr intervened on september 17 . 
  this was used in the court . 
  there are two newspapers by kp : daily and weekly ( `` tolstushka '' ) . 
  660,000 is the circulation of its daily version ( in the source i have cited , the figure for the daily one is almost the same , 650k ) . 
  2.7 million is for the weekly , thicker , kp . 
  i do n't know how it is in other countries , but i think the way history has always been taught in russian schools is fundamentally wrong . 
  it 's usually just a collection of more or less accurate dates , facts , personalities with very little analysis and sometimes simple answers to very difficult questions . 
  it seems just boring and not very educative . 
  however , what else should i expect ... our minister of culture , vladimir medinsky , in his bullshit dissertation in historical sciences writes :  according to our contemporary , a well known scientist and thinker o.a. 
  platonov , the only criterion of positive or negative assessment is the national interests of russia . 
  the main question the historical science should answer is how much an event or a private act meets the interest of the country and the people . 
  weighing on the scales of russia 's national interests creates the absolute standard of truth and reliability of a historical work . 
  again , this is from the dissertation for which he got a degree of a doctor of historical sciences ( btw , this platonov guy he cites denies holocaust and states there is a judeo-masonic conspiracy against russia ) . 
  as a representative of the academia , i feel utterly disgusted . 
  really ? 
  this would be very surprising to me . 
  which ones are higher ? 
  i 've always been absolutely sure that # 1 is either kp or aif , but i am not able to quickly find any modern data . 
  in 2011 , kp was # 1 with 2.7 million copies printed weekly ( [ source in russian ] ( https://lenta.ru/news/2011/03/03/abc/ ) ) . 
   they decided yeah , sure . 
  islamic fundamentalism and islam are different things . 
  there are bashkortostan and tatarstan where islam is the most widespread religion , but they pose no danger . 
  you 're wrong . 
  only the russian * constitution * takes precedence , decisions of the echr can be rendered invalid only by the constitutional court . 
  in all other cases , echr decisions have to be satisfied . 
  if they are russian contractors , then the russian military . 
  as far i as know , there are entire units in the russian military made only of contractors . 
   also you mean `` fight '' not `` fought '' both . 
  some no longer do . 
  in my opinion , this is true . 
  several people i know , including relatives , really believe that ukraine is a fascist state . 
  ok , i 've listened to the actual interview ( [ source ] ( http://112.ua/video/poteri-rossiyskih-voysk-na-donbasse-sostavlyayut-ne-menee-15-tysyachi-chelovek-melnikova-234695.html ) in russian ) . 
  according to melnikova , the estimates are based solely on `` theoretical correlation between losses of belligerents '' . 
  she says that their families `` are silent , do not publish anything , do not ask for help '' , so your first statement is wrong . 
  --  it does not include russian volunteers and militia of ethnic russians direct citation from melnikova :  \u043c\u044b \u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0435\u043c , \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 , \u0434\u0430 , \u043d\u0443 \u044d\u0442\u0438 , \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u044b , \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0435 , \u0441\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044b , \u043e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0440\u044b \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 , \u043d\u0443 , \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435 1500 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a the translation is :  we think that russian losses , these so called volunteers , but in fact they are russian militants , soldiers , officers , are not less than 1500 people according to this , it seems to include all russian citizens . 
  ethnic russians from ukraine , of course , are not included ; she never talks about * ethnic * russians . 
  --  non ethnic russian forces melnikova uses adjective '' \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 '' ( `` russian '' as in citizenship ) , not '' \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 '' ( `` russian '' as in ethnicity ) , so chechens have to be included . 
  those who fought in ukraine are most likely contractors , not conscripts . 
  i am not very interested in military , but i am a healthy male of the age of conscription . 
  i just have to know the basics . 
  what do you mean by `` think about people '' ? 
  those people who , as soldiers or volunteers , fight in ukraine most likely believe they are fighting for the people of the eastern ukraine against `` fascist junta '' . 
  contractors . 
  they earn money for that . 
   it is a known fact that the bulk of russian forces in donbass are young conscripts known to whom ? 
  to my knowledge , russia does n't send conscripts abroad , it is illegal . 
  however , it is possible that conscripts are forced into signing contracts before being sent . 
  the article you linked article never mentions conscripts . 
  the main character of the article , petr khokhlov , is a contractor , as clearly stated in the text . 
  paratroopers from the 331 regiment were also contractors . 
  most likely contractors , not conscripts . 
  conscripts are useless , and sending them is dangerous for the reputation among the population . 
  serb attacked navalny last year . 
  no consequences . 
  one of suspected attackers , alexander petrunko , poured piss on a picture at a jock sturges exposition . 
  no consequences . 
  such actions are bound to become increasingly violent as long as the authorities ignore them . 
  i doubt there will be consequences for the attackers even in this case . 
  save me !, 
  central heating is still on !, 
  judging by [ varlamov 's experience ] ( http://varlamov.ru/2348080.html ) , common glasses are not the best protection . 
  you probably need to wear safety glasses . 
  omg , you continue to do this ... 
  i do n't know why he said this , but again , he was wrong in this case . 
  open the article in question and see if anything was removed . 
  this is just a sad state of things . 
  that 's the reason why it is banned . 
  this should work for turkey as it technically is subject to decisions of the echr . 
  however , i assume that erdogan can just ignore the court . 
   seems like you 're the only one who knows the details  no . 
  details are publicly available , everyone can look at this article . 
  i provided you with a link . 
  i do n't know why you search for opinions of different people when you can open the article in question and see its history . 
   even english-language wiki consider it as a censorship , including russia in the list of countries where wiki is censored by local governments . 
  but russian wiki wo n't tell you about it , of course . 
  wikipedia ** is ** censored in russia , but it is outer censorship , not the inner one . 
  and wikipedia stands against it . 
  several wikipedia articles are on the black list , and it has been blocked by the government once . 
  but it does n't mean the government has control over wikipedia . 
   but russian wiki wo n't tell you about it , of course . 
  the russian wiki has more details on this event than the english one : [ link ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%91%d0%bb%d0%be%d0%ba%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b5_%d0%92%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%bf%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%b8_%d0%b2_%d0%a0%d0%be%d1%81%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%b8 ), 
  next episode : `` there is no sex in ~ ~ the soviet union ~ ~ turkey '' . 
  how much i hate this `` protection of health or morals '' part ... 
   according to wikimedia russia director , the page was quickly edited by wikipedia volunteers to avoid violations of the law . 
  forced self-censorship is still censorship . 
  then he also does n't seem know the details or made this statement to please rkn . 
  i gave you the diff , there are no changes to the article . 
  if you find self-censorship there , feel free to show me . 
  also , in the same interview he states that in their edits participants follow academic sources , not the russian law .
