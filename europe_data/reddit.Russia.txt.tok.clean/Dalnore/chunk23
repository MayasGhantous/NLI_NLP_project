  the fact that several wikipedia articles have been on the black list for a long time supports this . 
   as totally reliable any wikipedia is by its own standards not a reliable source . 
  that 's one of the main ideas behind wikipedia . 
  all information on wikipedia has to be supported by external sources . 
   uncensored . 
  it 's clear that it 's influenced by the government if it is clear , you should be able to provide at least one example . 
  reverted edits by the government are not censorship at all . 
  they chose not to move data of russian users to servers in russia . 
  the first one is complete bullshit spread by roskomnadzor . 
  it is just an excuse pulled by them because they were afraid to ban wikipedia . 
  the difference between the versions when the article was banned and when it was unbanned is [ publicly available ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%d0%a7%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%81_%28%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%ba%d0%be%d1%82%d0%b8%d1%87%d0%b5%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b5_%d0%b2%d0%b5%d1%89%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%be%29&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=72944808&amp;oldid=72923708 ) . 
  if you look into it , you 'll see that there is almost no difference , so the claim it was unbanned because it was edited is just false . 
  you 're playing for roskomnadzor in this case . 
  the second one is about some idiot from the government making an edit which was never approved and deleted in 21 minutes ( ! ), 
  after it was made . 
  how could you possibly use this one to blame wikipedia ? 
  everyone can make any edit in any wiki-project . 
  if such edits from the government were approved , then we could make some conclusions , but they are not . 
  could you provide a couple of examples ? 
  not 2chan , but 2ch . hk . 
  it 's currently the most popular russian imageboard . 
   just have the connections not work/time out in the hopes that the user would think the censored site was broken it really works on people . 
  i know the basics of different layers of network protocols and how the government can interfere , but still , after hide.me proxy stopped working , for two days i thought that it was just broken . 
  only then i guessed that it mush be the isp ban . 
  i think the most obvious explanation is that they care about market share and profits . 
  facebook , google , twitter all comply with our government , for example . 
  so this is how liberty dies . 
  among large resources : linkedin , pornhub ( unbanned two weeks ago , was banned for several months ) , archive.org ( was banned for one year , now not banned ) , rutracker ( the largest torrent tracker in russia ) . 
  also several opposition sites ( e.g. , kasparov 's blog , grani.ru ) , several ukrainian news cites ( e.g. , censor.net.ua ) . 
  most companies comply with the russian government and just ban the undesirable content . 
  yes , it is possible but not very popular . 
  for example , \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442.\u0440\u0444 redirects to kremlin 's site . 
  `` propaganda of drugs or psychotropic substances '' . 
  there are plenty of russian-language sites with memes . 
  being critical does n't mean being vocal about it . 
  i 'm highly critical of russia , but i have no goal of spreading anything to people in russia . 
  i usually try not to come up with political talks and ask the same from people i speak to if i know that our political views are very different . 
  it 's just useless and annoying for both parties . 
  that 's disrespectful towards russian wiki editors . 
  unlike most foreign companies like google , twitter , etc , its administration has continuously refused to comply with roskomnadzor if it is against wikipedia 's rules and stood against censorship . 
  at the moment , [ 7 wikipedia pages ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%92%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%bf%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b8%d1%8f:%d0%a1%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%86%d1%8b_%d0%92%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%bf%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%b8,_%d0%b2%d0%bd%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%91%d0%bd%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b5_%d0%b2_%d0%95%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%82%d1%80_%d0%b7%d0%b0%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b5%d1%89%d1%91%d0%bd%d0%bd%d1%8b%d1%85_%d1%81%d0%b0%d0%b9%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b2 ) are still on the black list , every single one of them is sufficient to completely ban the entire wikipedia in russia . 
  everyone in russia knows wikipedia . 
  almost nobody knows reddit . 
  i do n't know which isp you use , but sites in russia are meant to be banned either by ip or by url ( using dpi ) . 
  how about pornhub ban for a long period of time ? 
  internet archive ? 
  hide.me proxy service ? 
  very unpopular sites . 
  reddit is not as important as wikipedia , especially in russia , and the ban did n't get it to being actually enforced . 
  they accidentally banned the entire wikipedia in august 2015 , but quickly revoked the decision the next day . 
  but in the first screenshots they also replace the desired page with a message about why it is blocked . 
  you can not do this if the desired page is https , your browser will not allow that unless you create a security exception . 
  the difference is https vs http . 
  you can not replace an https page if you do n't have a certificate . 
  as far as i understand , they replace wikipedia 's ssl certificates with fake ones to be able to ban individual articles . 
  am i right ? 
  yeah , i also think that his next term is relatively secured unless some really huge shit happens with our economy . 
  but after that , the future seems unclear . 
   you think there 's a coincidence the elections are on the anniversary of the annexation ? 
  it 's definitely no coincidence , they explicitly changed the law to make them on march 18 . 
  it 's not completely passed yet , according to the current law the elections have to be on march 11 . 
   regardless i do n't expect power struggles in the next 7 ( that 's how long a term is in russia right ? ), 
  years the term is 6 years . 
  that 's a strange way to block websites . 
  i think he might lose some of his influence with age ( he 's 64 already ) , and someone else from the government may try to seize the power . 
  he will still have medvedev ( or someone else ) to deal with these formalities . 
  that 's big if it lasts . 
  even our government does n't have the guts to block wikipedia . 
  while his site is n't blocked , his lj blog , which was one of the most popular ones there , was closed . 
  i think he lost quite a few readers due to moving the blog to a new platform . 
  regardless of what you think of navalny and his relevance in russian politics , this attack is undeniably politically motivated . 
  i think he is also famous for his posts from different countries . 
  he visited like 100 + of them . 
   local crime news with no international or ** political significance ** will be removed news about navalny obviously has political significance . 
  this seems to be getting a common thing . 
  disgusting and pathetic thugs . 
  a huge problem is that they get absolutely no punishment . 
   19 th century russia loved the french culture the aristocracy , if to be precise . 
  average ivan from a village did n't care about the french culture . 
  i might be wrong but i think most people nowadays are not that interested in classical culture . 
  that being said , the russian culture is a part of the european culture , and classical european literature is taught in schools ( dante , shakespeare , goethe , dickens , doyle , hugo , etc ) and beloved my many of those people who like literature . 
  in my childhood in 90s , i had a lot of books by european authors . 
  one of my favorite authors back then was jules verne ( btw , there is a [ monument ] ( https://pp.vk.me/c628328/v628328674/224cf/qo21az6qh6u.jpg ) devoted to him in my city ) . 
  famous classical composers like bach , beethoven , mozart , etc are known by everyone . 
  concerts of classical music at philharmonics almost always include pieces by european composers . 
  those who learn music also have to learn a lot of their pieces . 
  the same probably applies to art . 
  i 'm not very interested in it , but i probably can name a dozen or two of european artists . 
  `` gayr ** o ** pe '' ( from europe ) , not rape . 
  many do . 
  the notion that europe is degraded and morally inferior to russia which protects `` traditional family values '' is somewhat common . 
  i do n't know if this is scholarship or not . 
  as far as i understand , there just is quota for foreigners in some universities . 
  it is beneficial for governments because they can gain brains out of other countries like that . 
  a lot of talented young people from russia go for education to the eu countries or the us and frequently stay there after getting their degree . 
  there are also some collaboration projects in education between russia and the eu . 
  for example , my scientific advisor got phd in france in 90s , while still being a grad student of our local university . 
  edit : btw , russia is a part of the bologna process . 
   most of the russians know that fact the eu countries has a bigger average wage than russia ? 
  of course .
