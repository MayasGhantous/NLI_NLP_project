  why else would our authorities need horror stories about `` gayrope '' ? 
  if you can not challenge the standard of living , just declare their living `` immoral '' . 
  there is also a cult of `` european '' goods . 
  everything labeled `` european '' is assumed to be of superior quality compared to russian and chinese things . 
  if it was easy , there would be a lot more russians in the eu . 
  if you have necessary qualification , it is possible to get a job offer . 
  for example , in academia , there 're a lot of russian migrants . 
  another rather easy way is through education . 
  several people i know are getting free education in eu universities at the moment , including one person in finland . 
  there is a difference between not liking putin and actively acting against him . 
  navalny 's brother is in jail , for example . 
  if i wanted only to make money , i would leave science immediately and switch to it . 
  i just do n't want to , science is more interesting to me . 
  i think most scientists are qualified enough to find a job with a better income , but it 's not about money . 
  shame on me , i did n't even know marie 's and pierre 's daughter was a scientist , not only a nobel prize winner . 
  there would be no albert without isaac . 
  classical mechanics is still an example of a wonderfully constructed theory . 
  and it 's still pretty much useful for most applications . 
  with his mathematical principles of natural philosophy , he completely redefined what science is , bringing mathematic formalism into it . 
  truly one of the greatest thinkers in the history . 
  in which way are they forced ? 
  it 's hard to tell which language should be the original one in case of kiev . 
  the city is too old . 
  the oldest source i could find a good digital version of ( laurentian codex of the 14th century ) spells it like '' \u041a\u0438\u0454\u0432\u044a '' ( kiev ) . 
  but i 'm not sure if it is in old east slavic or already has features of old russian . 
  the split between old russian and old ukrainian dates back to approximately this century . 
  spelling `` kiev '' has also been in use in english for centuries , it 's a historic language norm ; `` kyiv '' appeared in the 20th century and started gaining popularity since 1990s with diplomatic efforts by ukraine . 
  i personally do not like when countries decide how their toponyms should be written in foreign languages . 
  if i insisted on changing `` moscow '' to `` moskva '' in english , that would be ridiculous , in my opinion . 
  it 's actually '' \u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432 '' in russian , '' \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432 '' in ukrainian , and `` kiev '' in english . 
  `` kyiv '' is a fairly [ recent trend ] ( https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=kiev%2ckyiv&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3b%2ckiev%3b%2cc0%3b.t1%3b%2ckyiv%3b%2cc0 ) which is far from being the language norm . 
  my point was to point out factually incorrect information , that 's all . 
  i believe that sticking to the facts is important . 
  if you want my opinion on this one law , i 've always strongly opposed it . 
  again , which ones ? 
  i know of a single federal law of 2013 , i do n't see any mentions of other nation-wide laws in this article either . 
   one homophobic law after another i remember only the `` gay propaganda '' one . 
  the rest of homophobia comes mostly from the rhetoric of media and officials . 
  the love between estonia and finland is so strong , the russian border connecting them still remains . 
  and we also have a small piece of land near kazakhstan left , yay !, 
  while chechens are russians , the difference between cultures of chechnya and the rest of russia is important in this case . 
  there are many transliteration systems of russian , a single standard does n't exist . 
  some of them are hideous . 
  e.g. , the variant used by our authorities for passports is just atrocious . 
  that 's actually a common problem , people can have slightly different names on several credit cards and in a passport . 
  not to my knowledge . 
  holy shit , his use of singular `` you '' was really disrespectful . 
  i would probably try to abandon the dialog with a person if they treated me like that . 
  churkin was way way better at speaking . 
  he said `` many , possibly most '' . 
  and i might be giving a low estimate , as i do n't have any data , just my impression . 
  i have never seen polls on beating , but 18 % think that gays should be persecuted , and additional 37 % think that they should be treated from illness . 
  [ source in russian ] ( http://www.levada.ru/2015/05/05/nevidimoe-menshinstvo-k-probleme-gomofobii-v-rossii/ ) . 
  i 'm fairly sure at least 20-30 % would openly support beating up gays . 
  the us , of course . 
  i do n't buy mustard . 
  heinz for ketchup , sloboda ( local brand ) for mayo . 
  is russia big ? 
  it was a person from india . 
  i guess [ banya ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banya_ ( sauna \\ ) ) counts as a type of sauna . 
  i 've been to a banya in a village several times . 
  i do n't know the temperature . 
  it was rather small , we visited it with a friend of mine , nude . 
  i do n't remember if there was a heater , probably not . 
  i do n't like hot humid air , i prefer a usual bath or a shower . 
  but at that village it was the only way to get yourself washed . 
  saint petersburg wins by a huge margin , in my opinion . 
  i have seen only few european cities , but i think prague is the best i 've seen so far . 
  no , it has to do with a car . 
  petrol pumps have a protection which should always unlock the pump when the tank is full . 
  however , with some cars , this protection works when the tank is not full because air can not exit fast enough at high flow of petrol . 
  i had such problems with my previous car , but never have them with my current one . 
  russian and english . 
  i can also decently understand spoken and written ukrainian . 
  as programming languages are also mentioned , i can add java , python , and c++ . 
  sure . 
  i 'm just too lazy to copy-paste characters with diacritics . 
  yes . 
  nn is the closest 1m + city to moscow . 
  we are even losing population due to this proximity . 
  i 've traveled to novosibirsk by train , for 40 hours . 
  what if we omit accented characters in czech and transliterate russian ? 
  i think so . 
  i have a feeling czech uses more sizzling consonants and less vowels . 
  `` przhishti zastavka something something '' , `` krtek '' . 
  as nn ( my city ) is very close to moscow ( 400 km ) , there is a single road , but it 's not really a highway . 
  in most parts , it has 4 lanes ( two lanes in each direction ) , without a proper median strip . 
  in some places , it has only two lanes ( one in each direction ) . 
  there are lots of traffic lights and intersections along the road . 
  it usually takes ~ 6 hours to cover these 400 km . 
  a road from my city to kazan , for example , is much worse . 
  it has only two lanes , so you always need to overtake slow trucks which might be rather dangerous at 90 + km/h . 
  i usually prefer to use train , it 's faster ( less than 4 hours ) and less expensive if you are alone . 
  planes are too expensive and inconvenient : airports in nn and moscow are not close to city centers , so getting to/from airports , registration , boarding , etc might cost you ~ 3 hours despite the actual flight taking only 40 min . 
  i use planes only when i have a transfer to a different flight in moscow . 
  highways outside moscow and st. petersburg areas can probably be counted on fingers . 
  in my oblast ' ( nizhny novgorod oblast ' ) , there 's a single 45-km-long piece of highway . 
  the conditions are great compared to most roads i encounter . 
  however , the one in my area suffers from rutting , and i 'm afraid of increasing my speed over 80 when it 's raining . 
  some highways in moscow and st.p are paid .
