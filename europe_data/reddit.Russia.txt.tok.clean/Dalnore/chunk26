  i usually pay ~ 4 $ / month . 
  my tariff plan does n't include any minutes or texts , i do n't make calls often and hardly ever send texts , it 's cheaper for me to pay by the amount i use . 
  it also includes 75 mb of data per day , and i do n't really need more , i have wifi almost everywhere . 
  the speed is 4g , but that 's not very relevant when you have 75 mb cap . 
  tethering is allowed . 
  i have roaming charges everywhere except for my home region ( nizhegorodskaya oblast ) , but my data is available without additional charges in the entirety of russia . 
  afaik , 2.5 m is the bare minimum allowed by modern russian standards . 
  i have 2.8 m and i find 2.5 m very depressing . 
  in modern houses , less than 2.7 m is probably found in economy-class housing . 
  khruschev-era commieblocks ( usually 5 floors ) typically suffer from very small kitchens ( 5-7 m2 ) , low ceilings ( 2.5 m ) , lack of lift , nonexistent insulation . 
  brezhnev-era ones ( 9 floors and more ) are better , but still not very comfortable by modern standards . 
  all of them are often really ugly and unpleasant to be inside but outside apartments . 
  also , they often cause wars for parking space . 
  modern-era commieblocks are fine to live in , except for the parking part . 
  no , there is n't . 
  however , i shorten `` kilometres '' to `` ke-me '' sometimes . 
  good at anything math-related . 
  bad at singing and tasks involving physical activity . 
  yes , it 's a public channel called [ russia-culture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia-k ) . 
  [ kholodets ] ( http://www.gastronom.ru/binfiles/images/20151103/b8561a6e.jpg ) ( meat aspic ) . 
  ca n't stand it at all . 
  [ dressed herring ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dressed_herring ) . 
  if we consider all kinds of metal subgenres of rock , then let 's say epica ( [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dys1_tuumi4 ) ) . 
  if not , i 'll go with a russian folk rock band melnitsa ( literally `` windmill '' ) . 
  [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g-1ereccpy ) , the video is not official . 
  per month . 
  first . 
  it does n't matter how many times you enter and leave the schengen zone as long as you have less than 90 days spent in a span of a halfyear . 
  far from it . 
  definitely not . 
  particularly rich people , criminals , corrupt officials , i think . 
  and their children and spouses . 
  50k does n't sound like * that * much for a car , i see plenty of more expensive cars even in my city , let alone rich cities like moscow . 
  cars are status symbols for many , some people could even spend 2 + yearly wages on them . 
  the latest one was shot by the soviet government . 
  nowadays , people usually feel pity for their faith , especially for the death of emperor 's children . 
  i spend around 300 $ a month unless i have unexpected spendings . 
  coffee from a coffee vending machine : 0.46 $ . 
  liter of milk : 0.77 $ . 
  loaf of bread : 0.37 $ . 
  transportation ticket ( bus/subway/tram ) : 0.30 $ . 
  cinema ticket : from 1.5 $ to 11 $ . 
  i was taught british english at school . 
  however , as american english has more global influence , i 'm trying to follow its style in writing and not to mix styles . 
  it 's important for me because scientific journals either prefer the american variant or at least demand consistency in choice of ame/bre . 
  also because spell-checkers often underline `` colour '' , `` favourite '' , and so on by default . 
  my spoken english is a mix of british and american with a mild russian accent . 
  i think the british accent is percieved as more posh , while the american one is more rough . 
  mother 39 , father 36 . 
  i 'll probably just spend my official vacation at work . 
  i have a lot of things to do . 
  i 've been to md and dc . 
  i do not like how much they focus on cars . 
  for example , i had a mall on the opposite side of the road from my hotel , but the only way i could walk to it was through the parking lot . 
  one mcdonalds i went to was barely reachable by foot . 
  also , lights for pedestrians which allow to begin crossing the road only for several seconds are irritating . 
  highways are very impressive , i wish we had something like this between cities . 
  overall , the infrastructure is good , but i prefer european cities i 've been to . 
  never saw one in nizhny novgorod . 
  i 've seen only several hybrid priuses . 
  according to [ sources ] ( https://www.autostat.ru/news/29517/ ) , there were only 920 electric cars in russia in jan 2017 . 
  i think this theory has even been initiated by bill kaysing who is an american . 
  i 'm just surprised so many people in russia of all places support this . 
  we have so much pride and legacy in space exploration from the times of the space race that diminishing the us achievements kinda diminishes our own ones . 
  for some reason , a lot of people support the theory that americans have never visited the moon . 
  not only it 's ridiculous , but so many supporters is really strange because the soviets never doubted the lunar missions . 
  ever ? 
  maybe . 
  but i think the chance of it happening during my lifespan is negligible . 
  yes , here you can live hardly ever using english in everyday life . 
  everything is dubbed and translated , even on the internet there 're tons of russian-language resources . 
  the default language is english . 
  but it does n't mean those who learned it at school can actually speak it . 
  the school level is not good enough , and there is very little practice of english in russia , it is often quickly forgotten . 
  in my experience , even among young people only few can comprehend spoken language and express their thoughts beyond very simple phrases . 
  russia is [ one of the worst ] ( http://www.ef.ru/epi/regions/europe/ ) in europe in the knowledge of english . 
  well , there are foreign people who stay and work at my institute for rather long periods of time ( month + ) , so it seems possible . 
  though it is probably very hard to do things on your own , as almost nobody speaks english . 
  however , medical centers are absolutely out of question . 
  only christmas . 
  we have new year holidays from december 31 to january 8 , so christmas ( january 7 ) is technically a holiday . 
  all other holidays are not religious . 
  i live in a city and drive 20 km to my workplace , so i see police cars almost every day . 
  our current parliament is called `` rabid printer '' for a reason . 
  if they did absolutely nothing , they would be at least less harmful . 
  several times a year . 
  usually not for long , several hours at worst . 
  power lines are not underground in the district i live . 
  holy cow , that 's awesome !, 
  now it is my favorite song about nn ( not that i know many ) . 
  actually , their pronunciation of nn sounds rather close to russian , only lacks stunning consonants and shwa . 
  great , thanks !, 
  strange that you palatalized the first `` n '' and did n't palatalize the second one . 
  is there some logic or just feeling ? 
  [ i tried ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s17wtllawmwf ) . 
  moscow and st. petersburg are spelled and pronounced in english different from russian . 
  moscow is spelled `` moskva '' ( \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 ) in russian , the second syllable is stressed . 
  st. petersburg is spelled sankt-peterburg ( \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433 ) . 
  but it 's not mispronunciation , i think , just localized names . 
  i would like to hear a foreigner trying to quickly pronounce the name of my city , nizhniy novgorod .
