  the first word is probably painful for many . 
  in this sense , free speech is almost always limited . 
  disclosing secret and confidential information , defamation , advocacy of violence are almost universally punishable . 
  usually english , german , or french ( english is the most popular ) . 
  some specialized schools teach more than 1 foreign language . 
  actually , two years ago , it has become mandatory to teach 2 foreign languages , but this law is n't in full force yet , afaik . 
  also , people in different russian republics learn their native languages alongside russian . 
  i think she should go to hell . 
  this almost global trend of cracking down on the internet is worrisome . 
  at least canadians have a better system of units . 
   nobody flees to a country that is poorer than your home country , my friend , regardless of circumstances . 
  i do n't agree , reasons can be not only economical . 
  e.g. , there are russians who fled to ukraine due to political reasons . 
  there are no victims in production of fictional porn , i do n't see a reason for it to be prohibited . 
  a country i have n't been to yet . 
  i 'm not sure which one will be the next , though , there are still plenty of them . 
  [ this ] ( https://nyti.ms/2snoalw ) . 
  new york , jersey , honolulu . 
  the quiz is a little bit too difficult for me though , i 've never heard of some of the colloquialisms . 
  usually once in two days , as i have little physical activity . 
  in summer , when it 's hot , daily . 
  who knows ... 
  i guess bad management and proximity to moscow can be the reasons . 
  kazan , as a capital of a republic , has more money and is more independent from moscow than nn . 
  it also attracts people from the nearest regions as the most developed city in the area . 
  nizhny novgorod is the only 1m + city in russia declining in population , which is a very bad sign . 
  it used to be the 3rd largest city in russia half a century ago , but soon it will become the 6th because kazan is going to surpass it in a few years . 
  it seems that a lot of young people leave for moscow , which makes future prospect for this city grim . 
  nizhny novgorod is located at a [ confluence ] ( https://www.photogorky.ru/photos/9a241df2a2d4893053417b8d99288126.jpg ) of two big rivers , oka and volga . 
  i guess it is appropriate to its size , nn is a 1.2 million city .

  seems accurate enough , though i do n't usually consider myself libertarian . 
  a lot of stray dogs and cats around . 
  all my pets used to be stray before we took them home . 
  i have 3 cats now , but we had different many over the years and 1 dog . 
  packs of stray dogs are worrisome and dangerous . 
  we 'll have to get there eventually . 
  though right now there is little incentive to establish a moon colony . 
  both * \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f * ( * rossiya * ) in russian and * russia * in english are well-established names , so i like them . 
  in some languages russia has somewhat weird names , like * venemaa * in estonian or * oroszorsz\u00e1g * in hungarian , but it 's a right of the native speakers of these languages to call countries like they want and are used to . 
  russia is not a smaller country , but the influence of the american culture in particular is obvious here . 
  regarding the language , i 'm fine with it . 
  we need a global language , and english is suitable for that role as it is not a very difficult language . 
  however , i actually think that the internet is making it much easier for talents from smaller countries to get known worldwide . 
  for example , the most viewed video on youtube is psy singing in korean and a little bit of english . 
  japan is not really a small country , but it it 's pretty isolated , and , nonetheless , anime has also become a global phenomenon in the recent few decades . 
  so i believe globalisation does n't necessarily mean domination of a single culture . 
  it was rather often used in / r/ukraina when i visited it in 2014 and 2015 . 
  i do n't know if it is still used , i no longer visit this sub . 
  pro-russian people are often called `` colorads '' . 
  while i disagree with such methods and wo n't use them if i ever have kids , but this was a single episode , and i think i was lucky to have a good and caring family . 
  i see a lot of parents who do n't really care about kids , always seem annoyed with them , shout at them constantly . 
  my mother was n't like that ( she raised me alone with my grandma , i rarely saw my father , though he 's also a good person ) . 
  moreover , i was raised in the 90s when they had to deprive themselves of many types of food just to provide me with everything i needed . 
  i ca n't be anything but eternally grateful to my mother for how much she struggled for me to succeed in life . 
  i do n't know many things about us states so i 'll use a political joke about the russian -- ukrainian relations and say `` colorado '' . 
  religion lost a lot of power during the soviet times , as atheism was supported and propagandized by the government , and clerics were persecuted . 
  at the moment , religion is gaining more power , which i really do n't like . 
  early 90s . 
  i was spanked with a belt once after i threw a toy car at my great granddad and caused a cut . 
  other than that , i was sometimes sightly slapped in the back of the head ( this actually happens up to this day ) . 
  using a sponge and dishwashing liquid . 
  i rinse the dishes . 
  i think this is unlikely to happen . 
  it is just too complicated , especially the writing system . 
  it would probably be nice to have it as a lingua franca instead of english due to its simplicity , but this idea is completely unrealistic . 
  the way it currently is , esperanto is a nice linguistic construct which can be learned for fun . 
  and english will probably remain the main international language for quite some time . 
  i like his '' \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440i\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0439\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0430 '' [ moment ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdrh8wztcnu ) . 
  the third reich , the ussr , or modern north korea all have had dissidents despite their best efforts . 
  modern russia is not even nearly close to propaganda capabilities those countries have had . 
  we have some alternative media outlets in russian , we have access to the internet which is not heavily censored . 
  not a fan . 
  [ chechil ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=chechil&amp;newwindow=1&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjf_llsx4duahul0hokhyknbtwq_auicigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=945 ) ? 
  not much , especially for political news . 
  too much propaganda . 
  i watch only biathlon and i do n't have huge favorites , but [ kaisa m\u00e4k\u00e4r\u00e4inen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaisa_m%c3%a4k%c3%a4r%c3%a4inen ) has a very likeable personality . 
  she 's russian . 
  if i open the windows , sometimes i can hear . 
  the nearest curch is not very close , so it is not loud and does n't bother me at all . 
  damn , a sore subject . 
  lack of cheese is the worst thing about sanctions for me . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://izvestia.ru/news/608873 ) , the most eaten cheese is `` russian '' . 
  however , i can not imagine how it is possible to eat * this * . 
  i guess it 's popular because it 's cheap . 
  i would n't expect a foreign tourist to know russian , and i would prefer at least half-decent english to basic phrases in russian . 
  as a tourist , i do not like when people do n't know english , as i consider it a basic skill for an educated person in the modern world . 
  however , i try to learn some basic phrases for countries where english is not as widespread . 
  monday . 
  and i hate software that assumes otherwise and does n't allow me to change this . 
  dashcams are legal and very popular . 
  i think russia might be the main producer of car crash videos on youtube . 
  i 'm not sure about security cams , but i think they are legal . 
  one of my neighbors has one . 
  i have never worked with a citizen of a different country on one team . 
  my current team is just 4 people , all russian . 
  i think the answer is simply `` due to historic reasons '' . 
  cyrillic was the script adopted in many slavic languages a long time ago . 
  russian currently has plenty of speakers , cyrillic script suits it rather well , so there is little reason to make such a change and switch to latin . 
  personally , i prefer having different letters to having diacritics or digraphs ( like polish cz , rz ) , so i would n't like to adopt latin .
