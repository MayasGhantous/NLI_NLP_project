  moscow was founded in the 12th century and became the capital in the 15th century . 
  orthodoxy and cyrillic script were adopted in the 10th century . 
  the country and the capital you 're looking for are kievan rus ' and kiev , not muscovy and moscow . 
  russians did n't exist back then . 
  also , researchers believe that cyril and methodius created only the glagolitic alphabet , and cyrillic was created by their disciples . 
  yes . 
  far from being the most solid one in europe , but it 's still a democracy as long as elections are not massively rigged , opposition exists , has media access , and can freely participate in elections . 
  russian keyboards have both standard qwerty and cyrillic \u0419\u0426\u0423\u041a\u0415\u041d labels ( [ image ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/kb_eng-rus_qwerty%28%d0%99%d0%a6%d0%a3%d0%9a%d0%95%d0%9d%29.svg/450px-kb_eng-rus_qwerty%28%d0%99%d0%a6%d0%a3%d0%9a%d0%95%d0%9d%29.svg.png ) ) , we typically use en ( us ) and ru ( ru ) layouts . 
  however , i do n't need labels on a keyboard at all , i type blindly in both layouts . 
  they are rather common , especially in academia . 
  i 've never met orthodox jews though . 
  jewish people i 've met are decent people , often very hardworking . 
  i wish more believers and non-believers had attitude like yours , we could avoid a lot of unnecessary hostility . 
  no , i do not need god . 
  no , this map lacks almost half of the surface area of europe . 
  i 'm completely unaware of the story about ak-12 . 
  according to sources , a new version of ak-12 was presented in september 2016 and is now being tested . 
  i think it 's easier to make mistakes when there is little difference then when you have completely different alphabets and layouts . 
  it 's not hard . 
  cyrillic \u0430 is where latin f is , and so on . 
  you just get used to it . 
  we use latin in maths . 
  it 's frequently used in brand names . 
  i think that latin is designed better than cyrillic . 
  letters have a lot of ascenders and descenders which make it easier to recognize a word by its visual shape . 
  but i do n't want russian to be written in latin . 
  i think it 's generally well known . 
  people might forget about northern ireland though . 
  [ ak-74m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ak-74#ak-74m ) , i believe . 
  i have never shot a gun in my life , but i have disassembled and assembled a variation of kalashnikov ( akm , if i remember correctly ) . 
  kalashnikovs seem to be great rifles : simple , cheap , efficient , reliable . 
  yes , sometimes . 
  i 've seen signs with tatar in tatarstan . 
  transliteration into latin is also common . 
  i have no idea , i have n't tried either of them . 
  i rarely go to mcdonald 's in russia ( over the last few years , i can remember just 3-4 times in russia but ~ 10 in the us ) . 
  and if i do , i prefer chicken . 
  i know it from this line . 
  for some reason , it 's not on the mcdonalds menu since last year , replaced with `` grand cheeseburger '' . 
  grammar does n't necessarily follows logic and can change with time . 
  the same logic as yours might be applied to grown up people , but calling a person `` it '' is a mistake in english . 
  if you do n't know the gender , you use either `` he '' ( as a generic pronoun ) or `` they '' , but never `` it '' . 
  however , there is quite a big movement against this `` generic he '' in english , because some people find it sexist . 
  regarding children , * a comprehensive grammar of the english language * states :  the wide selection of pronouns ( wholwhich-helshelit ) should not be understood to mean that all these are possible for all nouns in all contexts . 
  a mother is not likely to refer to her baby or child as * it * , but such nonpersonal reference may well be preferred by somebody who is emotionally unrelated to the child , or wishes to generalize across sex distinctions in scientific contexts . 
   < ...   the choice between personal and nonpersonal gender is determined primarily by whether the reference is to a ` person ' , ie to a being felt to possess characteristics associated with a member of the human race . 
  < ...  exceptional uses such as * it * referring to babies and * she * referring to ships have already been noted . 
  so , for english , it 's more of an exception . 
  it 's usually not a good idea to call a child `` it '' if you talk to its parents , for example , they might find it offensive . 
  you 'd better just ask if it is a he or a she before using any pronoun . 
  noun '' \u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043a '' ( russian for child ) is of masculine gender . 
  there is a synonymous noun '' \u0434\u0438\u0442\u044f '' which is of a neuter gender , but it is archaic . 
  in russian , i would refer to a child with a pronoun depending on its gender , or with the masculine pronoun if i did n't know the gender . 
  using the neuter pronoun '' \u043e\u043d\u043e '' would be either funny or mean , depending on the situation . 
  however , as far as i know , it 's possible to call a child `` it '' in english . 
  but it changes as the person grows up . 
  you ca n't call a person `` it '' . 
  `` they '' becomes a gender-neutral pronoun for people . 
  there could be an argument that we should respect a child as much as a grown up person and not use `` it '' . 
  i already knew that the american system of units is defined through its relation to metric units . 
  thank you for the video , very interesting . 
  i did n't know that the kg is going to be redefined in 2018 . 
  good news , i guess . 
  yes , i know than not everyone can speak russian there . 
  i 'm not sure of course , i just had this feeling with some people , but not all of them . 
  i think it 's even worse because i never properly learnt ukrainian . 
  he is not very well known in russia . 
  he is more likely to be known due to spacex , as teslas are not popular at all here . 
  i personally think he 's one of the most brilliant people of our time . 
  if it 's used as an argument against me , then yes , for i can not be responsible for the past . 
  also , if it 's suddenly brought up with little relevance to the current topic . 
  very common . 
  i have an impression that most young women would n't even go outside to throw away garbage without makeup on . 
  girls start wearing makeup at the age of 12-14 , i think . 
  the style and the quality significantly varies . 
  some women look really great with their makeup on , some look like cheap hookers . 
  schoolgirls often tend to look like the latter due to lack of experience . 
  hard to tell . 
  i would n't use the term `` patriotic '' because it has negative connotation for me , and i also despise modern russia as a state . 
  however , i do care about its future , and i want it to become a developed and influential country ( influential not in a sense `` we can nuke you '' , but by technological and economical power ) . 
  i just think the path it has chosen leads to its demise , not prosperity . 
  no , or at least i did n't notice . 
  i had a feeling that some people in riga and tallinn deliberately pretended that they did n't understand russian , but i do n't mind using english instead . 
  no , i have an assignment to do . 
  but , as you can see , i 'm actively replacing it with procrastination . 
   do you like the artist/song your country is sending this year ? 
  do you think there is a chance to win it ? 
  the song was average , but it 's irrelevant since we do not participate . 
   what 's your favourite song this year ? 
  none of them really resonated with me . 
  but i enjoyed the [ romanian entry ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lldzark8fsm ) , it is very cheerful . 
   what 's your favourite song of all time ? 
  i 'll name two . 
  [ rise like a phoenix ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qruiava4wrm ) and [ hard rock hallelujah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gah9nrgnhuu ) . 
  probably a very strange pair of songs . 
  i do not even know the grammar , but i wo n't use the help of google to write this sentence ( except for this \u0457 letter ) . 
  russian ( native ) and english ( fluent ) . 
  i can try to speak ukrainian , but it will be an ugly mixture of russian and ukrainian . 
  i know several phrases in japanese , german , and italian ( `` un sacchetto , per favore . '', 
  a single time in my experience a cashier in europe did n't know english . ),
