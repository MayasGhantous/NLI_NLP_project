  a significant part of our emigration is `` brain drain '' . 
  a ton of highly educated people left russia in 1990s . 
  this process slowed down in 2000s but it 's again on the rise since 2012 . 
  the main motive is the difference in the standard of living . 
  for some , there might be political motivation . 
  many people leave without considering going back , but some return . 
  i think the attitude to emigrants is generally neutral to negative ; some consider them traitors . 
  personally , i think that emigration is the right thing to do . 
  i hope to do the same eventually , i do not see my future here . 
  i 've made a [ map ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1rrsvxlpeqqk5eii3uberbk26sr0 ) of all places i can remember . 
  i would say , not much , and mostly in the central russia . 
  i 'm from nizhny novgorod , i 've been to many places along the rivers ( mostly volga ) while being on boat cruises . 
  i 've also been to moscow and st. petersburg . 
  the only place i 've been to in asia is novosibirsk . 
  from nizhny novgorod : to moscow ( either by bus or by train ) , it 's 400 km from here ; to some other large cities like kazan or saratov . 
  must be the default of 1998 . 
  horrible times , people struggled even with buying enough food . 
  but i was still a kid and do n't remember much . 
  the russian -- ukrainian conflict that started in 2014 will also be a major historic event , but it 's not finished yet . 
  one week ago , it was far too hot here . 
  now it 's a little bit colder than usual . 
  tomorrow is going to be +5 , which is rather cold . 
  what about the freedom of assembly ? 
  it is important . 
  i believe people should be able to gather for a demonstration if they feel like it , regardless of it being a serious protest or just for fun . 
  i believe that real votes are usually properly counted ( statistical analysis also supports this ) . 
  rigging happens with the votes of people who did n't come to vote or sold their votes . 
  also , there are strange polling stations usually located in prisons , military units , or psychiatric dispensaries , where the ruling party happens to get exactly 100 % of votes . 
  i 'm not a linguist , so do n't quote me on that . 
  i think these parts had a mishmash of different dialects of migrants from different places in russia mixed with dialects influenced by the local population . 
  a broad spectrum of distinct dialects was more characteristic of the european part of russia . 
  i think that moscow and sp had considerably different dialects back then ( btw , i can often detect natives of sp by their lexicon , as the `` cultural capital '' of russia they use weird names for several things ) . 
  alaska is very interesting right now , because descendants of the russian colonizers , isolated from the russian influence , managed to create a fantastic russian dialect not present anywhere else in the world . 
  it 's a mixture of xviii century russian , local neologisms and load words from english . 
  unfortunately , it 's dying out . 
  full equality . 
  legal marriages , adoption , anti-discrimination laws . 
  catholicism and protestantism have evolved alongside the western civilization , but i would n't really call them `` modernist '' either . 
  the church in the west still frequently opposes gay marriages , abortions , scientific theories it does n't like , etc. 
  the russian orthodox church is more conservative , it is quite open about being against the `` western values '' . 
  right now , there are different muslim countries and societies . 
  you have ones like saudi arabia or iran which live by the sharia law , where rights of women are severely limited , non-believers are in danger , etc. 
  then there are ones like bosnia and herzegovina , turkey , or kazakhstan which are mostly secular . 
  i think the evolution in the direction of the latter ones is possible . 
  i think there are two reasons . 
  first , russia as a country is definitely more segregated . 
  people rarely travel abroad , there are not as many foreign tourists as in europe , and so on . 
  it 's not on the soviet level , however , when people were n't even allowed to leave the country . 
  before the 90s , there was very little practical reason to learn english . 
  second , russians are less comfortable with english . 
  maybe it 's because there are more differences between russian and english than between german and english , or maybe because our education is just not good enough ( or more likely both ) . 
  yes , there are copies . 
  vk is way more popular than facebook . 
  google and yandex are more like 50/50 on the search engine market , and due to android google is likely to win in the long run . 
  the runet , the russian segment of the internet , is huge , you can find almost anything in russian . 
  for like 5 years after i had started using the internet , i had almost never used english . 
  then i just forced myself to go beyond this bubble . 
  at first , i was very uncomfortable with english , it required concentration and effort to understand , but i got used to it eventually . 
  not really . 
  education , spread of radio and television , and mass migration in the 20th century all led to the normalization of russian throughout the country . 
  there are some different local words , some distinguishable local sounds ( like southern russian or ukrainian `` g '' sound ) ; people from the caucasus region also often have strong accent in russian as it 's not their first language . 
  but all in all , it 's hard to tell where the person is from just by their speech . 
  in school , they are 3 months long , from the end of may to august 31 . 
  in universities , the exams are usually in june , than there is a vacation until september 1 . 
  oh , puzzle solved , it 's seeing boobs that turns children gay !, 
  so great we tolerate only shirtless men , traditional family values are well protected . 
  you go to a local polling station , show them your passport , they tick you on their list and give you a ballot ( or several , if there are multiple elections on the same day ) . 
  the ballot is a simple list ( like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/%d0%98%d0%b7%d0%b1%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b5%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d0%b1%d1%8e%d0%bb%d0%bb%d0%b5%d1%82%d0%b5%d0%bd%d1%8c_%d0%b4%d0%bb%d1%8f_%d0%b3%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%be%d1%81%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f_%d0%bd%d0%b0_%d0%b2%d1%8b%d0%b1%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%85_%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b7%d0%b8%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%bd%d1%82%d0%b0_%d0%a0%d0%be%d1%81%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%b8_4_%d0%bc%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%82%d0%b0_2012_%d0%b3%d0%be%d0%b4%d0%b0.jpg ) ) of candidates with basic information about them ( e.g. , year of birth , the party they represent , their current position ) . 
  then you go to a private booth and make a choice by making any mark in a box . 
  seeing the answers here , i 'm also surprised . 
  i have misunderstood your comment . 
  i apologize for that . 
  but i still am not sure that this can be considered racist . 
  being against immigration of * all * arabs ( or all representatives of a chosen country ) is racist . 
  but being concerned about the religious beliefs of the majority of immigrants is not necessarily racism . 
   this was the case mentioned the case mentioned is  first comment was : `` islam isnt compatible with western civilitzation '' and i can not see the generalization you speak about in this comment . 
  you should have found a better example . 
  not everywhere . 
  e.g. , in kazakhstan , the support for such punishment for apostasy is very low , and this kind of punishment does n't exist . 
  it 's also unlikely that those who want to enforce this punishment can get you in europe . 
  islam is a religion , not a race . 
  unlike a race , it can be chosen as well as dropped by people . 
  any criticism of islam or any other religion by definition can not be racist . 
   commonly spoken/used in your country i wish . 
  there is almost no way to practice english in russia beyond the classes . 
  regardless of whether one likes it or not , english is the current lingua franca . 
  due to technological progress , the world is becoming increasingly more connected and globalized . 
  in my opinion , not knowing english for a young person is just a shame . 
  regarding the whole europe , i find the fact that knowledge of english here is more or less widespread fantastic . 
  i can be sure that i can travel to almost any country in europe and be able to efficiently communicate with many people . 
  and it 's also great that we can all discuss things on this subreddit despite many differences between our countries . 
  ukrainian . 
  i can understand almost everything ( both spoken and written ) , but i do n't speak it at all . 
  most of the times i like it . 
  americans are usually very easy to understand ( might be because i hear this accent often ) , unlike the scots , for example . 
   neither of us have tanks that 's a missed opportunity for russian supermarkets . 
  north korea . 
  much less reputational losses than all other variants . 
  looking at nuclear wasteland . 
  android phones have a significant lead .
