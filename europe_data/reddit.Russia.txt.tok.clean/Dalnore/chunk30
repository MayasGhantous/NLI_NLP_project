  however , there are still a lot of people with iphones . 
  i 'm 24 , have n't started yet . 
  completely against . 
  migration policy should be reworked to make migration not as easy , but a complete ban on migration from any country is an unbelievably disgusting thing to do . 
  there should be one . 
  i actually tried to find it to remove some nails last sunday , but it seems it 's either lost or not in the most obvious place . 
  the future of humanity can not be ensured . 
  i 'm currently working in theoretical physics and doing a phd . 
  in general , i like it , though there is too much bureaucracy and the future is unpredictable . 
  this is my only source of income for almost 4 years already . 
  watching kiev major and doing some numerical simulations . 
  there are general schools and special schools called `` lyceums '' and `` gymnasiums '' with more advanced curriculum . 
  lyceums usually focus on technical subjects like maths , physics , economics , etc ; gymnasiums on humanities . 
  lyceums and gymnasiums are almost always the best schools in a city , so many people want to send their kids there . 
  other than that , these schools are not that different . 
  in any school , you can choose to study for 9 or 11 years . 
  if you want higher education , you have to choose 11 years . 
  after 9 years , you can continue with vocational education . 
  if we are talking about planes , the wright brothers . 
  usually something like `` 1 234,56 \u0440\u0443\u0431 . '', 
  there is now an official symbol of ruble , so `` 1234,56 '' ( it might not be present in the font you see ) is possible but still rarely seen . 
  the most popular social media in russia are russian : [ vk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vk_ ( social_networking \\ ) ) and [ ok ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/odnoklassniki ) , which far outnumber facebook by usage here . 
  popular foreign social media are instagram , youtube , maybe twitter . 
  skype , viber and whatsapp are also used a lot . 
  the so-called `` runet '' ( russian-language segment of the internet ) is rather big , you can find almost anything here . 
  we officially have internet censorship , sites or pages on the internet must be banned by all isps if they are on the register of prohibited sites . 
  there are quite a few sites i can not open without proxy , including several opposition sites . 
  the most notable bans include linkedin , pornhub ( just unbanned two weeks ago ) , rutracker ( the biggest torrent tracker in russia ) . 
  most foreign companies comply with the russian government and block the content for the russian users upon request , that 's why they are not banned ( e.g. , youtube , facebook , twitter , etc ) . 
  wikipedia is the only large company i know that strongly refuses to comply , and it 's on the register of the prohibited cites for a long time already , so in theory it should be banned as well . 
  but it is not actually banned for some reason , my guess is that it would cause enormous backlash . 
  not at all . 
  reddit in general is not very popular in russia ; most russians do not even speak english . 
  i can give my perception of an opinion of an `` average russian '' if i 'm asked to , but my own opinions usually differ from `` average '' a lot . 
  mostly indifferent , i think . 
  there are not many black people in russia , most of them are foreign students . 
  i have never spoken to a black person in russia . 
  i personally do n't care much about the race . 
  it 's just a little bit unusual . 
  i have never been drunk and try not to hang out with people when they are drunk , so i ca n't even think of a dumb situation . 
  that was just a shitty attempt to make a joke . 
  i would die from cancer in a few seconds . 
  of course . 
  i 'm a physicist , and they are one of the best scientific organizations in the world . 
  i do n't think there are many people who believe in this . 
  i have mixed feelings about the us . 
  it 's cultural and technological influence is undeniable , it 's a home to a lot of great people , and it seems to be able to provide at least some of them with opportunities . 
  but it definitely has its fair share of dumb people like anywhere on the earth . 
  i 'm not a huge fan of their foreign policy . 
  it seems to not work as intended , and the middle east is a huge mess . 
  i 'm also concerned about possible abuse of their power in the future . 
  however , i still think the us does a better job as the most influential country then , say , china or russia would do . 
  also , my opinion of the us has significantly suffered with the election of trump . 
  i 'm not sure , i have never seen anyone playing it . 
  however , one vlogger [ was arrested ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/05/pokemon-go-russian-youtuber-ruslan-sokolovsky-five-years-jail-church ) for playing pokemon go in a church , so it must be at least somewhat known . 
  it has been proposed by [ sergei aksyonov ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/58c85ed79a79477a9f0da3a5 ) ( the head of crimea ) and by [ vladimir zhirinovsky ] ( http://www.mk.ru/politics/2014/09/23/zhirinovskiy-predlozhil-izbirat-carya-na-10-let.html ) ( a mp and the leader of the liberal democratic party ) . 
  they are more like clowns then politicians , but nonetheless . 
  as far as i understand , it 's one of the [ types ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u041b\u0438\u043a_\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 ) of saints . 
  watch reddit , read youtube . 
  or vice versa . 
  technically , before the revolutions in 1917 . 
  nicholas ii is generally viewed as a rather mediocre leader who was n't able to save the country during very harsh times . 
  he 's also a saint of the orthodox church because of his violent death . 
  our current leader is rather close to being a monarch as well . 
  some deputies even proposed to make him one officially . 
  i 'm fairly sure it 's not good , but i like doing it . 
  '' \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e '' ( fatherland ) is of neuter gender . 
  there is also '' \u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 '' ( literally `` birthplace '' ) which is feminine . 
  a single state with the economy bigger than the whole russia . 
  a place contributing a lot to great scientific and technological advancement . 
  i 'm a physicist , but i do n't have my phd yet . 
  my work involves theoretical and numerical studies of laser-matter interaction , in particular wakefield acceleration . 
  as a somewhat side job , i also participate in the theoretical research in relativistic electronics . 
  really dislike him , if to put this gently . 
  contrary to a popular belief about mother russia , it 's usually fatherland ( \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e ) . 
  however , the image of the mother is used in several wwii posters and [ statues ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_motherland_calls ) . 
  the only thing that holds me back from buying cars with an automatic transmission is price . 
  i would prefer automatic in my traffic jams , but i have no problems with using manual , so spending additional 5-10 % on a car just to change the gearbox does n't usually seem like a good deal . 
  some people also think that cars with automatic transmission are for bad drivers or are `` not manly '' , but i do not share this opinion . 
  the market share of automatic transmissions seems to be growing rapidly in russia . 
  since 2013 , it is even possible to pass the driving test on a car with an automatic transmission . 
  in this case you are not allowed to drive manual though . 
  public transport in my city , nizhny novgorod ( pop . 
  of 1.2 million ) , is horrendous . 
  a huge share of public transportation is not controlled by the city and belongs to individual entrepreneurs which care only about profits . 
  they use mostly [ this kind ] ( http://www.bus-set.ru/images/stories/paz.jpg ) of buses , most of which are old and in need of repair . 
  it 's inconvenient and unreliable ; drivers often do n't obey traffic laws ( e.g. , they regularly ignore red traffic light ) , you can pay only by cash ( because of that , if the bus is full , all your trip you have to pass money and tickets for other passengers back and forth ) . 
  i do n't know a single place in the city where there is a dedicated lane for public transit , so it collects all of the traffic jams . 
  we also have two lines of metro which do n't cover much of the city , train intervals can sometimes be up to 15 minutes . 
  most tram railways have not been repaired for half a century and have been gradually removed by the city authorities . 
  edit : it 's even worse for tourists . 
  there is completely no information on bus stops . 
  and if you also happen not to speak russian , you 're completely screwed . 
  the situation is similar or worse in most provincial russian cities . 
  in most cities , [ marshrutkas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshrutka ) is the main means of transportation . 
  moscow and stp ( and probably kazan ) are different , they have actually functional transportation systems . 
  i do not like driving a car for almost two hours each day , but i do not want to suffer either . 
  i do n't always understand english when it is sung ( especially several genres of metal ) , but i will pretend that i do and not mention english-language bands . 
  i listen to several german bands : rammstein , in extremo , samsas traum . 
  i also often listen to japanese music , mostly to individual songs .
