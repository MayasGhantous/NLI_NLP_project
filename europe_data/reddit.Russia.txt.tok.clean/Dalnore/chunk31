  but i can name one band i sometimes listen to : buck tick . 
  i also like mozart l'op\u00e9ra rock in french . 
  usually at 13 . 
  i have been to novosibirsk ( technically asia ) and the us . 
  most russians never leave russia , so we are similar to the americans in that regard . 
  my guess is : to show off high status . 
  it 's one of those big expensive suvs , like porsche cayenne , lexus lx , bmw x6 , gelandewagen , etc. 
  suvs are also rather convenient on russian roads , unlike sport cars . 
  i do heat water/beverages in microwave if i need only one cup . 
  other than that , heating leftover food or food from a supermarket . 
  i have no experience with other countries , but drivers in moscow are nuts . 
  i mean , wtf is [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/tqr4yhjp-ks?t=2m ) , for example . 
   is russia officially europe ? 
  most of russian population lives in the european part . 
  some young people i know do n't own a tv and feel no need to . 
  there are 3 tv sets in my flat , but i almost never use them . 
  if i lived alone , i would get rid of them whatsoever . 
  sometimes i watch biathlon , but i could watch it on my pc as well . 
  apparently [ there is ] ( http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2fs10508-010-9696-y ) ( even for the czech republic !, 
  ) :  of particular note is that this country , like denmark and japan , had a prolonged interval during which possession of child pornography was not illegal and , like those other countries , showed a significant decrease in the incidence of child sex abuse . 
  i 'm not sure how conclusive this study is , but it 's quite an interesting topic for discussion . 
  i 'm all for banning actual cp as it 's a business built upon child abuse . 
  but laws banning cp often ban fictional cp as well , which i find rather stupid because there are no victims in the production of fiction . 
  unlike most ( if not all ) eu countries , watch and posses child porn . 
  only production and distribution are illegal . 
  [ party for everybody ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgustrmjzyc ) , sang mostly in udmurt language , got 2nd place on eurovision . 
  i have n't seen anyone else doing this , but i pay with my phone sometimes , my bank provides this feature . 
  cashiers do n't usually seem surprised . 
  it 's not a huge improvement over a contactless debit card . 
  it 's a little bit easier to get the phone out of the pocket , but i usually have to find my wallet nonetheless because of discount cards . 
  it is taught in most schools ( some teach german or french instead ) , but it 's usually forgotten after the school . 
  i would n't expect a random person in the street to speak english . 
  english proficiency in russia is one of the worst in europe . 
  the first m is palatalized . 
  i remember them flying to sochi during the last summer . 
  but at the moment they have no flights from/to nn . 
  god , there are even no direct flights to stp at the moment . 
  aeroflot currently does n't have many alternatives , especially for flying from nizhny novgorod . 
  i think they are quite good . 
  however , i have n't had much experience with flying other companies , the only other flag carrier i have flown by is air baltic . 
  the government has their controlling stake , so they are managed mostly by the government and do get special treatment from the government . 
  aeroflot gets almost all taxes from foreign companies flying over russia . 
  they also receive government subsidies to maintain unprofitable flights between regions of russia . 
  aeroflot is also the only big russian company using a considerable number of russian jets ( ssj ) , as they are forced to buy them . 
  it is a thing for political stuff . 
  but it is less popular than vk , ok , facebook , instagram , and livejournal . 
  i use it to follow people and companies i find interesting , but i rarely write anything myself . 
  i know many very different russians . 
  my opinion of the population of russia in general is rather negative for political reasons , but i try not to make any assumptions about individual people before i know them . 
  our kitchen and bathroom are too small for a washing machine . 
  yes . 
  but you may consider the domestic passport as a less convenient version of an id card with a little bit more info . 
  freedom of movement inside russia is a constitutional right . 
  i think it 's possible to drive around russia without this passport , using only a driving license . 
  it is necessary to have at least some identification on you just in case , but a driving licence should be sufficient for the police . 
  hotels also can have problems with this , i 'm not sure if they accept anything but a passport . 
  our domestic passport is also sufficient to travel to belarus , kazakhstan , and abkhazia . 
  it used to be sufficient to travel to ukraine , but now they require a regular foreign passport . 
  the domestic passport is a local identity document ( afaik , almost all european countries have id cards for that ) . 
  it 's always used if you need to identify yourself using a document ( like when buying a train ticket , making a contract , etc ) . 
  the foreign passport is used only to travel abroad . 
  in fact , only 28 % of russians have one . 
  yes , it is celebrated . 
  this year it 's the same day as catholic easter , april 16 . 
  people usually eat [ kulich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kulich ) and gift [ painted eggs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/easter_egg ) to each other . 
  when i was a kid , we also used to build a small sand slide and roll down these eggs , trying to crack other children 's eggs . 
  for some reason , people also tend to do a particularly thorough cleaning in their homes just before easter . 
  i 'm an atheist , i 'm neutral to slightly irritated when it comes to easter . 
  i do not like the part when everyone you meet greets you with '' \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435 ! '', 
  ( `` christ is risen !, 
  '' ) , and you are supposed to answer with '' \u0412\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0443 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435 ! '', 
  ( `` indeed risen ! '' ) . 
  i answer for the sake of being polite , but i ca n't say i enjoy it . 
  i have two passports , a domestic and a foreign ones . 
  this should be rather unusual for europe , i suppose . 
  the foreign one is boring , but it contains multiple visas which make it a little bit more interesting . 
  the domestic one currently contains only basic info and my registered place of living . 
  it can also contain additional info , like marriage , children , military status , blood group . 
  undoubtedly match tv . 
  its main channel is public , and there are several paid channels , so they together cover a lot of different events . 
  their only competitor is probably eurosport which i usually find somewhat boring . 
  i watch only biathlon though . 
  why ca n't i speak ukrainian ? 
  it 's similar enough to russian that i began to understand it just by listening to it long enough , but differences hold me from actually speaking it . 
  grammar is somewhat different , so i will definitely make a lot of mistakes with cases and conjugation , but it does n't affect my ability to understand in any way . 
  also , my active and passive vocabularies are very different in size , because i often hear and read ukrainian , but i have never had any experience speaking or writing . 
  so when i hear a ukrainian word , i usually understand what it means or just guess from the context ; but i find it hard to find proper ukrainian words if i try to speak . 
  even some ukrainians speak with a mixture of russian and ukrainian knows as [ surzhyk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surzhyk ) . 
  russian and english . 
  i also understand ukrainian quite well , but ca n't speak it . 
  not much , i 'm too young for that . 
  i 'm fairly sure anything i pay now will have no effect on my pension . 
  on such time scales , even the existence of the country is uncertain . 
  vodka . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu5kswkzqoi ) . 
  a fine song , but terrible pronunciation . 
  does n't matter , though , as we do n't actually have an entry anymore . 
  yes , i 've discussed this topic with my friends a couple of times . 
  i do n't care if people are fat . 
  it 's just none of my business , even if it is unhealthy for them .
