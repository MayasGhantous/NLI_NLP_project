  shaming people for being fat seems like an asshole behavior . 
  however , i do n't think it should be accepted as in `` it 's as fine to be fat as not to be fat '' . 
  because it is n't . 
  never heard of anything called `` the masters '' . 
  we have distinction between soviet and russian . 
  soviet : shitty but indestructible , russian : just shitty . 
  russian people generally think that russian and chinese things are crap , while european are superior . 
  some russian companies use european-sounding brands to play on these feelings : ralf ringer , vitek , borg , carlo pazolini , o'stin , highscreen , erich krause , etc. 
  consumables are usually local , other things are more likely to be foreign than not . 
  regarding things i use , my monitor is taiwanese ( benq ) , my tv is dutch ( philips ) , my mic is american ( blue ) , my keyboard is japanese ( mitsumi ) , my mouse is swiss ( logitech ) , pc components are american or korean ( intel , amd , samsung , corsair , wd , crucial ) , my phone is korean ( lg ) , my car is italian-japanese ( suzuki ) . 
  i 'm not sure if it is considered a true `` white collar '' , but i 'm a physicist . 
  as i 'm a theoretical one , i do all my work sitting at a desk . 
  i mean something like [ this ] ( https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/i/81lj1n6s4sl._ul1500_.jpg ) . 
  i even defended my master 's thesis in a similar shirt ( it was +30 outside this day ) , after which the faculty secretary said that it was inappropriate . 
  i do n't have a certain timetable , i can come to work whenever i want , or even skip a day and work from home if i need to . 
  i prefer to work from 11:30 to 20:00 in order to avoid most traffic jams . 
  no dress code at all . 
  i usually wear jeans , t-shirts , and sneakers ; sleeveless shirt , shorts and sandals when it 's too hot . 
  it is allowed , but you have to notify local authorities is you get one . 
  i 'm all for it . 
  there are many people with dual citizenship among our scientific community , it is really helpful for collaboration between countries . 
  i would also definitely like to get another citizenship someday . 
  prague is great , it 's my favorite so far . 
  riga is nice too , but its historical center is rather small . 
  however , the most unexpectedly nice old town for me was in tallinn . 
  i 'm ashamed to say i recall this painting from the [ opening ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqtfza3poso ) to elfen lied . 
  i 'm not sure , but probably [ black square ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/kazimir_malevich%2c_1915%2c_black_suprematic_square%2c_oil_on_linen_canvas%2c_79.5_x_79.5_cm%2c_tretyakov_gallery%2c_moscow.jpg/1024px-kazimir_malevich%2c_1915%2c_black_suprematic_square%2c_oil_on_linen_canvas%2c_79.5_x_79.5_cm%2c_tretyakov_gallery%2c_moscow.jpg ) by malevich . 
  my personal favorite is [ the apotheosis of war ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/apotheosis.jpg ) by [ vereshchagin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasily_vereshchagin ) . 
  it always strikes me . 
  [ sch\u00f6nbrunn palace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sch%c3%b6nbrunn_palace ) . 
  i have n't even been inside ( too miserly for that ) , but its surroundings are magnificent at sunset : [ small album ] ( http://imgur.com/a/43jfi ) . 
  meh , i guess moscow and st petersburg are fine , other places are not . 
  economically , there were worse times , but it 's still bad , and i do n't see many prospects for improvement . 
  20 million russians live below poverty threshold ( the average threshold is ~ 160 eur/month , i ca n't even imagine having this low income ) . 
  socially , it straight out sucks . 
  freedoms are gradually shut down , education is on decline , free medical care is subpar at best , infrastructure in many cities including mine is degrading , some roads look like they have survived an airstrike . 
  i think that our social sphere might have been better during the soviet times than right now . 
  all in all , i 'm terribly pessimistic . 
  multiple sources on the internet . 
  i ca n't listen to our tv `` news '' for more that 10 seconds . 
  the language of maths is almost always universal , as far as i know . 
  of course . 
  first of all , foreign languages are taught in school ( usually english , but sometimes german or french instead ) . 
  second , latin is needed for maths and many other sciences . 
  by the way , we learn separate names of latin letters for maths ( where y is `` igrek '' , q is `` ku '' , h is `` ush '' , etc ) . 
  and it 's almost impossible to live without at least the basic knowledge of latin , you have brand names in latin , urls in latin , etc. 
   is it legal for employers to fire people based on what they post on their social media/their political opinions in your country ? 
  it 's definitely illegal here , but it 's hard to prove that you were fired for your political views . 
  if your boss really wants you to be fired , they 'll easily find a way . 
  well , i can support it . 
  according to the [ analysis ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/nbk215773/ ) by the national research council , some conventional breeding processes including chemical mutagenesis and ionization radiation have a higher chance of unintended effects than rdna genetic engineering ( see chapter 3 ) . 
  a more recent [ analysis ] ( https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23395/genetically-engineered-crops-experiences-and-prospects ) concludes ( chapter 9 )  previous national research council reports have consistently said that the breeding process used to introduce a new trait into a crop is not a particularly useful indicator of new or increased hazards . 
  < ...  by focusing only on particular forms of genetic engineering , such process-based regulatory approaches may be underregulating plants developed with other breeding processes that can pose equal or greater hazards , increase exposure , or create greater uncertainty about risk . 
  it might hinder the technological advancement and may result in europe falling behind american and asian countries in biotechnology and agriculture in the future . 
  you 're completely wrong , / u/denex is correct . 
  the us is ranked # 21 * overall * : # 4-5 in `` food quality '' , # 1 in `` afford to eat '' , # 35-42 in `` enough to eat '' , and # 120 in `` food for health '' , resulting in # 21 ranking . 
  download the data and see for yourself . 
  because people are prone to antiscientific views . 
  two arguments here already mention `` precaution '' , which is a completely ridiculous argument . 
  all food we eat is genetically modified , the difference is the method : traditionally we use random mutations during artificial selection , gmos are obtained through genetic engineering . 
  if the result is the same , the technology does n't matter . 
  no traditionally selected varieties are tested for decades despite us not knowing what mutations actually occurred , we see only the properties . 
  the `` precaution '' argument should lead to meticulous testing of all new varieties of foods on a case-by-case basic regardless the technology used , and can not be used against gmo only . 
  basically , every single argument against gmo can be used as a completely similar argument against conventional artificial selection . 
  maybe `` legacy '' is not a right word , but i meant exactly what you say . 
  it is no longer a base unit in metric systems , but it remains widely used . 
  there are about 0.4 % of buddhists in russia . 
  many of them live in a few traditinally buddhist regions like kalmykia , tuva , buryatia , zabaykalsky krai . 
  btw , kalmykia is probably the only region in europe where buddhism is the most prevalent religion . 
  they are viewed neutrally . 
  yes , it is allowed . 
  i do n't have a strong opinion on this topic , but i 'm leaning towards it being allowed , so that countering possible state influence remains feasible . 
  i think you overestimate the level of public schools ( or public schools in czechia are really good ) . 
  in my opinion , some parents can definitely do better if they are motivated to do this . 
  it 's considered a variation of swastika , at least in russian and in english ( judging by wikipedia ) . 
  it 's not that frequently , and mostly with feet and inches , rarely with pounds or gallons . 
  for me , the most frustrating part is the inability to use anything but inches in some pieces of software , especially when i need something to be precise in cm . 
  but traveling to the us is very confusing . 
  not only i have to adapt to a different currency ( unlike euro , rouble is n't close to $ in value ) , but also to all different measurements . 
  some things are even conceptually different . 
  e.g. , i 'm used to measuring car fuel efficiency in liters/100 km . 
  you would probably use miles/gallon . 
  so in order to have any idea if a car is efficient or not , i 'll need not only to convert two measure units , but also to invert it . 
  well , '' ... takes a 10 incher '' makes a better porn video title than '' ... takes a 25 centimiterer '' . 
  well , it 's probably because the us is one of a very few countries that use this system , but it is a very influential country on the global scale , so we generally are forced to learn this system , as there is no way we wo n't bump into it from time to time . 
  this causes a little bit of frustration . 
  while computers can indeed convert between systems , you need to have the concept of values with units for that in your code or software , which is not always that convenient . 
  e.g. , i 'm writing a simple python script and i do n't want to use a library which supports dimensional units . 
  if i want to use `` 2 m 12 cm '' for some reason , i 'll write either 2.12 or 212 without giving it much though . 
  if i have 6 ' 8 '' instead , i 'll have to write this as `` 6 * 12 + 8 '' or `` 6 + 8/12 '' , which is less readable and can lead to unnecessary mistakes ( e.g. , 8/12 will be 0 in python 2 , which i might overlook because i usually use python 3 ) . 
  1991 -- yeltsin -- former chairman of the presidium of the supreme soviet of the russian sfsr . 
  1999 -- putin -- former prime minister . 
  2008 -- medvedev ( kinda president ) -- former first deputy prime minister . 
  2012 -- putin -- former putin . 
  currently , if you want to be a president , your surname should begin with `` put '' and end with `` in '' . 
  as humans are not computers and tend to make mistakes in arithmetic operations , having units with the same base as our number system ( i.e. , 10 ) seems objectively better . 
  it 's not totally useless , of course , but it is inefficient and justified only by the fact it is legacy . 
  some of them are neo-nazis ( neo-paganism seems to go well with anti-semitism and neo-nazism for some reason ) , but not necessarily . 
  they use a variety of swastikas ( usually not the one used by the third reich as it can get you into trouble ) and claim it is an old slavic symbol of the sun . 
  i * really * hate this example , it uses points similar to the defenders of the imperial system , i.e.
