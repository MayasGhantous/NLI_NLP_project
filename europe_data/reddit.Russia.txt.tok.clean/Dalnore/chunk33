  the relation to values relevant to the conditions on our planet or in their everyday lives . 
  in modern metric systems ( si , cgs ) , liters and calories are legacy and not used ; 1 degree is defined through the triple point of water , not its melting and boiling points , so it does n't depend on some arbitrary pressure ; masses and volumes are no longer related through water density . 
  the point of modern metric systems is universality . 
  edit : 1 gram of hydrogen also does n't have one mole of atoms . 
  the atomic weight of hydrogen is slightly higher than 1 g/mol for all isotopes . 
   why do europeans like metric so much ? 
   europeans do you understand that the metric system is used in almost all countries around the world with very few exceptions ? 
  in fact , the us is the * only * industrialized country which has n't adopted the metric system . 
  as a physicist , i can not help but hate the imperial system . 
  it is not convenient for calculations at all . 
  btw , as far as i know , physicists in the us use predominantly si or cgs . 
  yes , i do n't know much about this movement , but they are somewhat visible . 
  they claim to be following `` slavic traditions '' and usually hate christianity . 
  the most noticeable feature in clothing is the use of swastikas ( or `` kolovrats '' ) . 
  estonian flag has a really nice color combination . 
  preferably yes . 
  it is inconvenient otherwise . 
  '' \u042f \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043b\u044e \u0448\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0434 '' means `` i like chocolate '' both in russian and ukrainian . 
  it 's quite hard to construct exactly similar phrases because , despite many similar roots , inflection works differently in two languages , and alphabets are a little bit different . 
  when the ratification was declined by the duma , putin was n't the president yet . 
  of course , if putin really wanted to ratify this protocol , it would be done immediately . 
  when the 6th protocol was signed , the president proposed a law for the ratification of this protocol , but the duma decided that its ratification was premature at that moment . 
  and now there is no urgent need in the ratification , as capital punishment is no longer enforced even without it . 
  the possible ratification is also still not very popular with the population . 
  according to [ recent polls ] ( http://www.levada.ru/2017/02/08/smertnaya-kazn/ ) , only 16 % want to completely abolish capital punishment , 25 % are satisfied with the status quo , while 44 % want it back . 
  seven : red , orange , yellow , green , light blue , blue , violet . 
  you should have read this article a little bit further :  shortly before the end of this moratorium , on 19 november 2009 , the constitutional court of russia extended the national moratorium `` until the ratification of 6th protocol to the european convention of human rights '' . 
  it is a little bit confusing . 
  there is still capital punishment in our criminal code . 
  but it has been explicitly abolished by the order of the constitutional court , and our constitution no longer allowes it . 
  as the constitution is of higher power than the criminal code , in order for this criminal code articles to be legal , the constitution has to be changed . 
  for nizhny novgorod , it 's where the kremlin is . 
  it 's a historic center , the city administration is here , most of business activity is nearby . 
  btw , there is no death penalty in russia , it was a prerequisite to joining the council of europe . 
  well , first of all , russia does n't want to be in the eu . 
  but even if it wanted , it is too big , too poor , and too corrupt to be in the union . 
  when [ yarovaya law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yarovaya_law ) is fully implemented , it 's likely to become worse and more expensive . 
  we also have censorship , so i have to use proxy sometimes . 
  fibre connection , 50 mbit/s down , 100 up . 
  5 $ / month ( 0.5 % of my wage ) in city suburbs . 
  no cap . 
  breakfast : yogurt , two sandwiches ( one with butter and cheese , another with butter and ham ) , coffee with milk . 
  lunch : a salad ( something like olivier ) , rice with beef stroganoff , juice and [ vatrushka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vatrushka ) . 
  dinner : caesar salad ; a soup with some kind of noodles ; mashed potatoes with chicken stew , cherry tomatoes , pickled cucumbers , and broccoli ; tea . 
  right now , i 'm drinking kefir . 
  we have the same thing . 
  i 've been told several times something like `` do n't cry , you 're a man , you have to be strong . '', 
  i 'm also rather uncomfortable discussing emotions with male friends . 
  fortunately , i have n't been bullied in school that much , despite being awkward and too smart . 
  i tried to mention things which should be known worldwide , not only in the former soviet union . 
  in particular , masha is aired in the us , several european countries , several south american countries , several asian countries , as well as youtube and netflix . 
  one of the episodes is the 5th most watched video on youtube ( and the most watched non-music video ) with 2 billion views . 
  according to my experience , most people actually like putin . 
  a lot of people dislike the rest of the government ( the good old `` the tsar is good , the boyars are bad '' ) . 
  personally , i dislike both putin and the government . 
  not at all . 
  russia is generally not very good at cinema and tv series . 
  what it produces is often mediocre or worse , with some good exceptions ( e.g. , '' [ masha and the bear ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/masha_and_the_bear ) '' seems rather popular outside russia ) . 
  probably around 20 % of movies in cinema are russian . 
  i 'm not sure about tv series , maybe closer to 50/50 . 
  big foreign ones like got , simpsons , etc are present . 
  most other tv programs are russian-produced ( though some are forks of popular foreign ones , like the voice ) . 
  music is more competitive , there are quite a few fans of russian rock and russian rap . 
  but our modern pop music , imho , mostly sucks . 
  on typical pop radio stations , russian-language music ( some of it is not necessarily russian ) is ~ 15-25 % . 
  in gaming industry , russia is underwhelming . 
  i remember only a few big titles developed in russia , like [ space rangers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/space_rangers_2:_dominators ) , [ heroes of might and magic v ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heroes_of_might_and_magic_v ) , [ king 's bounty : the legend ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king%27s_bounty:_the_legend ) ( and several sequels ) . 
  it should be said that everything foreign in russia is almost always dubbed in russian . 
  the last two points seem rather radical . 
  i do n't know the op , but i think the issue with hostility might be not in the opinions per se , but in the attitude . 
  if you behave in a polite and calm manner , have some reasoning behind your opinion , and understand when it 's not a right time for a discussion ( the other person might not be interested in this topic at the moment at all ) , hostility probably should n't happen . 
   you pay with a 20 banknote , you usually do n't get the 1 lipa back got ta pay by card and save this 1 lipa . 
  the least valuable : [ 10 kopeks ] ( http://cennye-monety.ru/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tsennyie-monetyi-rossii-10-kopeek-sp.jpg ) , ~ 0.16 eurocents . 
  there are also 5 and 1 kopek coins , but they are quite rare nowadays and are no longer produced . 
  the most valuable : [ 5000 rub ] ( https://shop.conros.ru/pictures/big/976955.jpg ) , ~ 81 $ . 
  on pop music radio stations , about 15-25 % . 
  however , there are stations with only russian-language music . 
  as far as i know , there is no law for the minimum percentage . 
  way too poor . 
  waste is n't sorted where i live . 
  i have one garbage bin for everything . 
  the only thing i do n't throw away are batteries , i collect and take them to ikea , they have special containers for batteries . 
  i live near a military base . 
  military trucks and jeeps with black license plates are also quite often seen on the roads . 
  other vehicles , very rarely . 
  i do not care about ethnicities at all . 
  i would prefer that people in russia are able to speak russian , but that 's it . 
  i dislike the idea of nation states . 
  widely tolerated both by law enforcement and by people . 
  i ca n't think of a single person who uses something digital and is not a pirate . 
  my education was completely free . 
  i even had a stipend of ~ $ 60/month . 
  in general , there are some paid vacancies if you fail to get a free one , but i do n't know how much they cost . 
  almost never . 
  there are some black students whom you can see in public transport , but that 's it . 
  actually , i have never spoken to a black person in russia . 
  i ca n't say i know much about different european countries , i barely visited just several of them , so i do n't have specific countries and cultures in mind . 
  i 'm somewhat attracted to what can be called the `` european '' culture ( or `` western european '' for that matter , as i consider the russian culture european too , by definition ) . 
  cities for all people , not just car owners ( the thing i do not like about the us ) ; valuing human rights ; progressiveness in general . 
  still , i believe .
