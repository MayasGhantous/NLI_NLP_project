  not really . 
  text messages are useful when you do n't have data or for sending something to people who do n't use apps , but otherwise it 's too expensive . 
  however , i do n't like having several different im services . 
  i wish we had some open standard . 
  for men : jeans , t-shirt , sneakers . 
  maybe something like sweater , jacket , or hoodie . 
  all men currently sitting it my room are dressed like that . 
  for women : more variety . 
  jeans , skirts , blouses , sneakers , shoes , dresses . 
  yes . 
  in russia , ethnicities are self-determined . 
  that should definitely be pre-wwii stalin 's repressions ( including the man-made famine in 1932 ; ukraine and several other countries consider the ukrainian subset of the famine genocide ) . 
  tens of millions of people suffered during this period , millions died . 
  kiev . 
  kievan rus ' is definitely a very significant period in histories of belarus , ukraine , and russia . 
  crimea ( i 'll go with the international recognition here ) . 
  it was crucial for the existence of the black sea fleet of the russian empire . 
  hell no . 
  maybe immigration policies should be reconsidered , but straight up banning people for specific religious beliefs is barbaric . 
  unfortunately i do n't . 
  most articles i see are about the reasons of the crisis and the economy , not the life of ordinary people . 
  there are a few default-related photos on [ meduza ] ( https://meduza.io/galleries/2015/08/25/defolt-natsii ) . 
  fun america-related fact : the only affordable chicken in the 90s were the so called `` bush legs '' , chicken legs imported from the us . 
   how would you say it affects your outlook today ? 
  and the outlook of russians in general ? 
  i was a small happy kid loved by his family back then . 
  i had no idea things were that bad either , i had nothing to worry about and i did n't know it could be better . 
  it did n't have a big impact on my perception of life . 
  however , these events affected russians a lot . 
  that 's one of the main reasons why putin and his methods are so popular . 
  capitalism , democracy and liberal reforms are associated with chaos and poverty ; on the other hand , putin 's period began with enormous economic growth . 
  so people are willing to be stripped of many freedoms if this ensures economic stability ; stability is what putin usually promises . 
  the answer is `` no '' . 
  federal law 12.06.2002 n 67-\u0424\u0417 , article 58 , point 6 :  the following entities are prohibited to donate to election fighting funds < ...  :  b ) foreign citizens , except cases defined by article 4 point 10 of the current law . 
  point 4.10 is about foreign citizens who are residents of russia . 
  the default of 1998 . 
  my family barely had money to sufficiently eat ; things like chicken , meat , cheese were completely out of the question . 
  only three of them , all seem quite bad . 
  it 's very difficult to properly judge yeltsin , he got a crippled country to work with , many of reforms during his time were necessary , but he probably was n't competent enough for his job . 
  medvedev was n't a real president , he had to become one for putin not to break the constitution . 
  putin ... let me just say that i really hate him . 
  i still think lenin is more well-known overall than our famous writers . 
  i also checked [ mit pantheon ] ( http://pantheon.media.mit.edu/rankings/people/ru/all/-4000/2010/h15 ) , it agreed with me . 
  living : putin . 
  dead : probably lenin . 
  yes , i do . 
  it 's rather common to know it , but not overwhelmingly . 
  also , some people from the older generation might not now the lyrics as they were changed . 
  it 's a shame that sometimes our athletes are n't able to sing along the anthem . 
  the anthem often gives me a sad feeling . 
  it pulls my strings , it makes me want to love and admire russia , but there 's little to admire in modern russia . 
  i remember only receiving newspapers and leaflets from different candidates during elections . 
  mostly european . 
  definitely not asian ( except several republics ) . 
  most of the population lives in the european part . 
  historically and culturally it 's predominantly european . 
  to those who think that the heritage of the ussr makes it non-european : this heritage itself is completely european . 
  it 's wrong to define only one set of `` true '' values as european . 
  the fact that many russians want to distance themselves from europe is more of a political statement , not cultural . 
  if you ask any russian `` what country has a closest culture to yours '' , you almost always will get belarus or ukraine , which are solely european countries . 
  if you ask a russian to name chinese , arab , kazakh , indian or whatever composers , writers , poets , film directors , etc , they will almost always fail . 
  but i bet they 'll easily name a bunch of european ones . 
  the canteen at my work does n't accept cards . 
  coffee vending machines also do n't accept cards . 
  so i use cash daily . 
  in most other places i pay by card . 
  anime is rather popular among generations raised in 90s or later . 
  almost everyone from my age watched sailor moon or pokemon on tv in the childhood , so they at least have a concept of anime . 
  personally , i am a huge fan of anime , and quite a lot of my acquaintances also watch it somewhat regularly . 
  i ca n't say there 's a stigma , but there is definitely a lot of prejudice , especially among older generation . 
  it probably comes from the idea that cartoons are for kids . 
  some people , when they learn that some of these `` kid cartoons '' actually have adult themes , get angry and demand that a certain anime/manga is banned . 
  i remember that , in 2013 , a group of angry moms wrote a personal demand to putin to deal with death note manga sales in russia because , in their opinion , it was propaganda of suicide . 
  it 's illegal , can lead up to 1 year in prison . 
  i personally do n't think state symbols require that kind of protection . 
  we already had many `` resets '' in relations with the us , none of them lasted very long . 
  who knows how long the new one holds . 
  i 'm concerned that , with trump as well as some putin-loving politicians in the eu , the sanctions might end prematurely , which could give russia a green light for further aggressive moves . 
  the basis is the great triad : \u0445\u0443\u0439 ( huj , * dick * ) , \u043f\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430 ( pizda , * cunt * ) , \u0435\u0431\u0430\u0442\u044c ( yebat ' , * to fuck * ) . 
  you can create all sorts of complex curses using those three roots . 
  it 's probably possible to convey any thought using only them , especially if you are in construction or military . 
  there are other words , like \u0441\u0443\u043a\u0430 ( suka ; literally * female dog * , but used as * bitch * ) , \u0431\u043b\u044f\u0434\u044c ( blyad ' ; * whore * , but also used as an inerjection , much like `` fuck !, 
  those above are very obscene . 
  there are tons of much softer curse words . 
  better to draw something in the bulletin to make it invalid . 
  always . 
  and there is n't even an option to vote against everyone . 
  used to be common . 
  now it 's an administrative offense , but people still drink outside sometimes . 
  [ lay 's with caviar ] ( http://cdn-jpg.thedailymeal.net/sites/default/files/styles/tdm_slideshow_large/public/slides/5-lays%20caviar-zapadnik.jpg ) , i suppose . 
  i still find it disturbing , and it 's hard for me to eat it . 
  i 'd say french ( sorry op ) . 
  though i 've heard more french people than mediterranean , so that might have influenced my perception . 
  very different sounds and intonations ( with a tendency to shift the stress ) make it tiresome to listen to long speeches . 
  russians are also almost on the same level of badness . 
  never saw one . 
  exams consist of theory ( very easy , you just need to memorize the rules and practice example tests a bit ) , several exercises like parallel parking or starting uphill , and a short drive in the city . 
  most people attend a driving school . 
  some people pass exams without attending a school , but it is much more difficult because the examiners tend to have `` agreements '' with the schools and often show prejudice against those not from schools . 
  yes , makes life easier , especially googling -- as mentioned by op .
