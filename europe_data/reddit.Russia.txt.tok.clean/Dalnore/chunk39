  this is ridiculous if you ask me . 
  there must be people in russia who reject the leadership and their control over media enough to start some sort of projects of awareness . 
  a tiny minority . 
  the most prominent alternative outlets are shut down , like dozhd or the old lenta.ru . 
  people opposing the regime are usually labeled `` national traitors '' , `` the fifth column '' , etc. 
  it can also get you in some trouble if you become too loud and visible . 
   as in ... not enough people know english to access foreign media and see new perspectives ? 
  knowledge of english in general is poor . 
  people of modern generation refuse even to read texts longer than a couple of paragraphs . 
  making an effort of understanding a foreign text requires some dedication . 
  i know english fairly well and i usually use english ui everywhere , but i still find myself too lazy to read the english wikipedia instead of the russian one despite it usually having better quality articles . 
   international information at domodedowo this is really shameful . 
  according to recent polls , 72 % of people here do n't even have an international passport . 
  also consider the following : many people in general are not very curious , the main source of information for the majority is tv ( most of which is controlled by the state ) , our internet segment ( runet ) is significantly separated from outside by a language barrier . 
  many russians still have rather vague ideas about how life is in different countries . 
   they refuse to speak english i suspect this happens because many ( especially among school-kids ) just ca n't say more than a few simple phrases and ca n't understand foreigners speaking english at all . 
  for some reason , our education mostly focuses on the english grammar . 
  and there is little to no practice of listening to or speaking english beyond the classes , because everything is in russian , foreign tourists are rare , and the majority never leaves russia . 
  i know people going for a phd in physics ( where english is a must ) who can barely say a complete sentence . 
  i also have a feeling that the age of the average gamer in russia is lower , though i do n't know any statistics for that . 
   i think that the leadership is doing a great job from their perspective that 's because the perspective is created by the same leadership . 
  they are not opposition , they are people making an illusion of opposition . 
  even as presidential candidates they support putin as a candidate more than themselves . 
  indeed . 
  he 's praised for winning the war . 
  but i really do n't understand how anything positive he did could justify all the suffered and killed people . 
  i would also argue that the war was won despite him , not because of him . 
  elimination of many officers and inability to react to intelligence reports prior to the war resulting in absence of forces at the soviet borders seem like the choices which have lead to a lot more casualties . 
  yes , [ polls confirm ] ( http://www.levada.ru/eng/perceptions-stalin ) . 
  the strange thing is that , according to the polls , family members of 20 % currently living russians suffered from the stalin 's repressions . 
  the percentage is certainly bigger for estonia , but 20 % is still a huge number of affected ; it 's beyond my understanding how can anyone here praise him . 
  might be , though this opinion of mine was established rather long ago . 
   so you are of russian ethnicity , slavic ... 
  i do n't agree , but whatever . 
   you dont feel russian ? 
  i do n't value traditions very much , and ca n't stand some of them . 
  i do n't feel very united with either people of russia or ethnic russians . 
  i 'm probably somewhat a cosmopolitan . 
  as to my knowledge , my parents considers themselves russian , if it is what you mean . 
  however , i would n't agree with being called russian in any sense other than a holder of a russian passport . 
  because , first , it 's unconstitutional here ; and second , i think that it 's essential to identify with and feel unity with a group of people based on ancestry and traditions to be of that ethnicity . 
  i would n't object that much either , because i do n't care much about it ; i just do n't like having a label instead of being judged by how i behave and what a person i am . 
  none . 
  this choice is granted to me by the constitution . 
  by that logic , i 'm not russian . 
  estonian ( as well as most other countries adjectives ) can mean both ethic estonian and a citizen of estonia . 
  you can , but '' \u0433\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d '' was used in the russian empire to address people of high status ( usually noblemans ) . 
  for obvious reasons , it was almost completely abandoned in the ussr , and it still has some negative connotations of a word from class society . 
  that 's the problem with russian language . 
  there are a lot of `` titles '' to address strangers , but none of them is long established and completely neutral . 
  almost everyone does n't like some of those words , so you often have a chance of slightly offending someone . 
  no , we have it , but in front of surnames and positions . 
  you can use '' \u0433\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442 '' ( mister president ) , '' \u0433\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d '' ( mister putin ) , they are formal and polite . 
  however , a pair of a name and a patronymic is the most frequent used form of addressing someone politely . 
  if you use a name and a patronymic , nothing else is added in front of it . 
  '' \u041c\u0443\u0436\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430 '' is for strangers , when you do n't know their name . 
  before trump -- hell yes , america was probably the most hated country overall . 
  now the same people are usually rather enthusiastic about trump . 
  people that care usually never stop caring . 
  i would never intentionally swear when my mother hears me . 
  my grandmother had this kind of respect towards bread , she considered it a sin to even throw away crumbs . 
  her respect came from the constant hunger during her childhood , though . 
  \u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0449 is too deeply associated with communism , and a lot of people are not big fans of it . 
  unless we somehow manage to bring back communism ( i hope not ) , it 's not coming back soon . 
  \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d is used , but it has a feeling of speaking from the position of some authority ( english `` citizen '' has the same feeling , i believe ) . 
  it is expected from a policeman , a passportist , etc , but i think it 's too formal and cold . 
  some communism lovers also freak out when anyone addressees them with '' \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d '' and reply that they are '' \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0449 '' . 
  it 's also possible address a male person as '' \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430 '' ( man ) or '' \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a '' ( young man ) and a female person as '' \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430 '' ( woman ) or '' \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 '' ( young woman ) , but it 's easy to accidentally mess up , because some people prefer to be called `` young '' , while others prefer the opposite . 
  for example , i 'm 24 , and i still do n't really like when i 'm called '' \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430 '' , but i 'm getting used to it . 
  there is no generally accepted polite way to address a stranger ( like sir or ma'am in english ) since the fall of the soviet union ( with `` tovarisch '' mostly gone ) . 
  it is very inconvenient , because i never know how to address someone and i end up just with `` excuse me , could you ... '', 
  i would change a lot . 
  in my opinion , our unified state exam proved to be detrimental to education , because pupils are now taught to pass this particular exam instead of learning to think and solve problems . 
  i would completely get rid of it . 
  the number of high education institutions has to be decreased . 
  there are dozens of completely shitty institutions , which devalues higher education . 
  there is also lack of people enrolled in vocational education . 
  too many shitty lawyers , managers , and economists ; not enough technicians and engineers . 
  our higher education is in the middle of adopting the bologna process , so everything is a big mess , every year brings something new . 
  i hope , it will make things better in the end . 
  salaries in education are laughable . 
  some of school teachers in my city earn just 250 -- 300 eur a month . 
  should n't be like that for such an important profession . 
  yes , you can sign a contract to serve in the military . 
  the salary is rather high , especially for provinces . 
  as far as i know , people deployed to conflicts outside russia are usually not conscripts . 
  i think that a person with higher education should have some general knowledge on different important topics , so i do n't think that 's just bullshit . 
  i have a master 's degree in physics . 
  i did n't choose my courses ( there was no choice , we do n't have the bologna process system with credits and different courses yet ) . 
  other than courses related to physics and maths , i had 4 semesters of english ( totally not enough , russians in general suck at english , while it 's a requirement for my profession ) , 4 semesters of pe ( to be honest , i hated it ) , 4 semesters of philosophy ( actually , a very important thing for physicists ) , 2 semesters of russian history , 1 semester of economics , and 1 semester of anthropology . 
  as a healthy male person , i also had 5 semesters of military education . 
  i thought you meant the difference in the people 's culture , not only architecture . 
  st. petersburg certainly looks more similar to western european cities than moscow . 
  it 's much younger than moscow , and its founder peter the great was a big fan of the european architecture of his time and invited quite a lot of foreign architects . 
  as it was the capital until the soviet union , almost every emperor tried to build something special here . 
  however , there are old buildings in moscow too . 
   old/retro looking metrostation i think that 's rather typical of soviet-era metro stations . 
  moscow metro system is 20 years older than petersburg 's one , and moscow is also famous for its architecture style in metro . 
  for example , look at [ that ] ( http://www.boredpanda.com/moscow-metro-station-architecture-russia-bright-future-david-burdeny/ ) or google other photos . 
   i think it has many skyscrapers ( like london and new york ) actually , all skyscrapers in moscow are located in a business district called [ moscow city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_international_business_center ) .
