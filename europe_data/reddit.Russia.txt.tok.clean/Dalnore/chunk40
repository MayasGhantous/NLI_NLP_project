  this district is quite far away from the center of moscow . 
  i 've been to moscow several times , but never had a chance to go to this district . 
   lacks old ones that impression might be caused by the fact that moscow is huge ( almost 12 mil ) , and most of it are rather modern districts . 
  i think it 's rather hard to have a european feeling for a city that large . 
  however , take a look at google streetviews in the center of moscow including [ ilyinka str .

  moscow in general seems to me rather chaotic and is a mishmash of many styles , with heavy influence of the soviet architecture and some questionable decisions like 8-way cities in the center of the city . 
  sure , why not . 
  i think of russia as a mostly european country because of its history and the fact that its european part is the most populated one . 
  countries west of it are certainly entirely european by definition ( however , when i say or hear `` a trip to europe '' , i usually assume non-cis countries ) . 
  i do n't consider turkey and kazakhstan european ; also , i do not have a particular opinion on georgia , armenia , and azerbaijan . 
   culturally  st. petersburg is a very european city , while moscow is n't what 's the cultural difference between these two cities which separates them so much ? 
  there is a difference in architecture and city structure for sure , but i 'm not sure if this is enough . 
  prices in shops : 149,99 \u0440\u0443\u0431 . 
  ( or sometimes 149,99 ) . 
  large numbers : 10\u00a0000\u00a0000 decimal places : 1,236 quotation marks : we use french `` quotation marks '' ; or \u201e these ones `` for the second level or writing by hand . 
  but dumb quotes like `` these ones '' have become significantly more popular , since they are available on a keyboard . 
   when i see people try to buy a pack of cigarettes or a pack of gum with a credit card , my veins are starting to melt through the bones and skin . 
  with contactless payment , it 's much quicker to pay with a card than to count coins or to wait for change . 
   so do you also think if the majority of people in an autonomous republic inside russia want to become independent it should be up to them ? 
  secession is trickier than unification due to challenges in dividing infrastructure and a point possibly being made that resources should belong to all people of a certain country . 
  i think it should launch a large and rather long political discourse , which might end with a referendum . 
  i think of scotland as a fairly good recent example of this process . 
   and do you think russia should recognize kosovo ( since the independence is the result of it being up to the people ) ? 
  i 'm not educated enough on the history of that conflict , and it definitely does n't seem straightforward to me , so i prefer not having an opinion . 
  really ? 
  i did n't have a chance to choose where to be born . 
  i think it should be up to the people of moldova . 
  i do n't think forcefully changing borders in europe is a good idea . 
  i 've almost completely switched to debit cards ( there are still places where only cash is possible ) . 
  contactless payment makes it even more convenient . 
  i speak russian and english . 
  i use russian every day . 
  i rarely speak english , but i listen to it and read and write in it almost every day . 
  it 's my main language at work and on my pc . 
  the most disgusting thing is `` ea '' . 
  read - / i\u02d0 / , read ( again ! ), 
  - / e / , break - / e\u026a / , learn - / \u025c\u02d0 / , bear - / e\u0259 / , heart - / \u0251\u02d0 / . 
  i 'm sure there are even more . 
  to be honest , scottish is probably the most difficult to understand native accent for me . 
  probably it 's due to the fact i 'm not used to it . 
   wich but `` sandwich '' is not `` sand-itch '' . 
   / \u0254\u02d0 / and / \u0252 / are both / \u0254 / . 
  so `` stalk '' and `` stock '' become homophones ? 
  it 'd sound unnatural . 
  i could say `` brakovannyi brak '' ( with adjective from brak ) . 
  however , there 's already a book named '' \u0411\u0440\u0430\u043a \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0430 '' ( brak bez braka , marriage without flaws ) . 
  i was lucky to have a very good teacher who taught me the pronunciation of english sounds ( tongue and lips position , etc ) at a young age , so i can probably pronounce most of them well enough , especially when i try . 
  however , i hate english vowel sounds , especially / \u026a / vs / i / vs / i : / , / \u0254\u02d0 / vs / \u0252 / , / \u0252 / vs / \u028c / , / \u0259 / vs / \u00e6 / vs / \u025b / . 
  there are so many of them , and when i 'm speaking quickly , it 's difficult , for example , to make `` bad '' and `` bed '' distinct enough . 
  i also hardly can use the glottal stop , so i can only pronounce `` fountain '' with a full `` t '' sound . 
  in general it 's somewhat difficult for to pronounce words where you have to switch between `` v '' and `` w '' ( like * wave * ) , or to quickly switch between `` sh '' , `` th '' and `` s '' . 
  the worst word i had to pronounce during a public speech is * sheaths * . 
  * \u0411\u0440\u0430\u043a * ( brak ) means both * marriage * and * defect * , * flaw * . 
  that 's interesting , in russian * castle * is * \u0437\u0410\u043c\u043e\u043a * ( zamok ) , while * lock * is * \u0437\u0430\u043c\u041e\u043a * ( zamok ) . 
  they are also written the same , the only difference is in the stress . 
  according to the etymology dictionary , the roots of this similarity in russian are from middle high german sl\u014d\u0292 . 
  september . 
  probably the best time , it 's still very warm , but not overwhelmingly . 
  ~ ~ minimum wage is around $ 80 a month , which gives about 40 cents per hour for a 40-hour week . ~ ~ edit : i did n't know it was increased to $ 123 , or ~ 75 cents per hour . 
  afaik , sales tax does n't exist in russia . 
  vat is 18 % . 
  north : kizhi island , russia . 
  62 \u00b0 n south : national harbor , maryland , usa . 
  38 \u00b0 n west : dulles international airport , usa . 
  well , it 's obviously not a must-go place , but interesting nonetheless . 
  narva 's probably a little bit too nice for a small russian city . 
  i noticed a huge difference at the border . 
  when you go from narva to ivangorod , cars become more expensive , while everything else around you becomes shittier . 
  the same with the fortresses . 
  i personally think that the ivangorod fortress has more interesting things left , but there is no tourist infrastructure at all !, 
  it 's hard to reach it , and at first we could n't even find where to buy tickets . 
  it 's unbelievable how this historical object is not treated well enough . 
  the narva fortress is miles ahead in that regard . 
  however , almost exclusively russian speech and the ability to see russia just across the river ca n't make it feel foreign . 
  tallinn is more tricky . 
  the architecture definitely gives it a very ` european ' feeling . 
  not many signs and signboards are in russian ( and while in prague i could understand some words just because the language is slavic , estonian is obviously completely unintelligible for me ) . 
  however , russian is often heard in the streets , almost all people working in services understand it , and oh god they watched putin on channel 1 in the hostel 's kitchen ( i had to leave , could n't stand this ) . 
  all in all , tallinn definitely feels more foreign than russian to me , but russian influence is still very obvious . 
  i could recommend it as a very nice tourist destination for those russians who happen to not know foreign languages . 
   other than your home country, 
  i liked tallinn more . 
  i do n't really care much about towns being more or less ` russian ' , i just like visiting different places . 
  narva is old , and there are two fortresses ; interesting enough for me . 
  i traveled by bus from st petersburg , so it seemed a convenient and somewhat interesting place to stop for a couple of days . 
  as i obviously do n't need a visa to russia and i had a schengen multivisa , i could visit both narva and ivangorod fortresses . 
  however , a couple of days proved to be too long for that , not much is going on there . 
  in descending order : * ** italy ** -- 8 days . 
  1 day in rome , other on elba . 
  i had a conference . 
  * ** estonia ** -- 5 days . 
  part of a 2015 vacation in narva and tallinn . 
  * ** austria ** -- 4 days . 
  part of a 2014 vacation in vienna . 
  * ** czechia ** -- 4 days . 
  part of a 2014 vacation in prague . 
  * ** latvia ** -- 1 day . 
  i had a 20 hour transit in riga .
