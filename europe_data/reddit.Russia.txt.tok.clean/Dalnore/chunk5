  that here is always cold and snow . 
  i watch some anime , they show a location in the southern russia in summer . 
  and there 's a freaking blizzard !, 
  in russia , it 's common to blame the us for everything . 
  blaming obama for bad roads , cancelled trains , piss in elevators , etc is a joke which takes this attitude to the us to the extreme to ridicule this attitude . 
  sorry if my attempt is totally not funny . 
  o , it must be obama who always wets the bed . 
  he is already notorious for pissing in russian elevators . 
  i 'm surprised russian and belarusian words are so much longer than ukrainian . 
  in russia , district heating is much more prevalent then central heating . 
  we have many thermal power plants designed to provide both electricity and warm water/heating for entire districts . 
  it turns out to be rather efficient even when considering significant losses of heat on delivery . 
  however , this system is not very flexible , so we ca n't control when the heating is turned on and off , and it can be somewhat cold in apartments for several days/weeks in autumn . 
  that 's funny , because i 've never seen a geyser for a single tap . 
  country-wise differences can be significant , i guess . 
  no , you 're wrong . 
  in my apartment , we have a geyser , not a boiler , for all the water . 
  our incoming cold water is separated before the geyser in two parts . 
  one part is sent directly to all taps in the apartment , the other part is heated in the geyser ( it 's automatically turned on whenever there is flow , of course ) and is sent to all taps in the apartment via separate tubes . 
  this is how all geysers i 've seen in russia are connected to the water system . 
  it seems so . 
  in russia all showers are also with a hose . 
  they are still used here in some buildings . 
  modern geysers turn on and off automatically and can also sustain the temperature you set ( in degrees ) , so they are not very inconvenient . 
  but after that it starts to change the water temperature !, 
   operating a bathroom in europe an american shower with just one handle was n't obvious for me either . 
  that 's a very strange design to have a geyser just for one tap . 
  i have a geyser for all of the water in the apartment . 
  it 's not that bad . 
  this ca n't be non-intentional . 
  this is a pretty old pun . 
  there 's a [ song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzrpbgimens ) '' \u0422\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e '' ( `` tvori dobro '' , `` do good '' ) by shura . 
  '' \u0422\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432 '' ( `` travi bobrov '' , `` exterminate beavers '' ) is a misheard lyrics version of this song . 
  osp studio made a [ parody song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz-wy0yodzo ) '' \u0422\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432 '' more then ten years ago . 
  and i think the pun might be even older then these two songs . 
  at least '' \u0431\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u043e \u0437\u043b\u043e\u043c '' ( `` the struggle between good and evil '' ) is sometimes humorously referred to as '' \u0431\u043e\u0440\u044c\u0431\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430 \u0441 \u043a\u043e\u0437\u043b\u043e\u043c '' ( `` the struggle between beaver and goat '' ) . 
  i 'm surprised that this video is on the official channel of central ppk ( railway company ) . 
  however , i wo n't be surprised if someone is fired for it . 
  this is my own translation from the russian [ source ] ( http://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cknonkje02bw/content/id/2475728 ) . 
  i am not that sure about the word `` accident '' . 
  she uses '' \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0430 '' , which is usually stronger than `` accident '' . 
  `` catastrophe '' or `` disaster '' might be better . 
  `` cartoon characters demonstrate ways of suicide in a humorous format appealing to kids and teenagers '' , they said . 
  our mfa already made a statement :  russia is disappointed with the fact the situation around the `` boeing '' accident investigation does n't change . 
  the conclusions by the dutch prosecutor 's office confirm that the investigation is biased and politically motivated . 
  i 'm so disgusted ... 
   dumb ways to die fun fact : this video is banned in russia for suicide propaganda . 
  unfortunately , it 's not likely that russia will admit it . 
  by the way , will there be a published report like the last year ? 
  it would be a great source of information on the subject . 
  the main storyline is `` whatever happened , it 's ukraine 's and usa 's fault '' . 
  details may vary . 
  if this person already obtained the citizenship of the country , why should it matter that he/she is an immigrant ? 
  does it make them a worse citizen then those who were born in the country ? 
   are those criticising russia under russian flag here are not ethnical russians ? 
  at least not everyone . 
  i also find the concept that ethnicity should have something to do with the ability to criticize your own country somewhat ridiculous . 
  and we still have roaming for different regions of russia ... 
  something like 50 % or slightly more . 
  for me school was 8 years ago , and back them this topic was n't ignored . 
  i believe it has n't changed in the last 8 years . 
  of course , it is mentioned very briefly , but the molotov -- ribbentrop pact , the accession of eastern poland and the baltic states , the war against finland are taught . 
   russia criminalized even mentioning that the ussr helped to invade poland together with nazi germany what ? 
  it is mentioned even in history books for school students . 
  not that high , something like 10-15 % . 
  i mean , it 's usually one of the cheapest options for flying to many european countries . 
  moscow-riga , by the way , is expensive . 
  it 's cheaper to buy moscow-riga-tallinn ( or something like that ) and get off in riga . 
  it 's one of the cheapest options for our country . 
  banned for me ( rostelecom ) . 
  that 's basically the story of almost the entirety of our government . 
  watching porn is not illegal . 
  distributing it is . 
  some people get prosecuted for creating distributions on torrent-trackers . 
  if you only download and then stay a seed , you 're generally safe , as far as i know . 
  but , if some day they need you to be put in prison , they 'll possibly use this against you . 
  considering its owner , not a very good alternative . 
  according to her comments , she is even a history teacher . 
  that 's so much cooler than my desk with a pc . 
  i was commenting on its domestic success . 
  i know it has several international customers . 
  the first prototype of irkut mc-21 was presented a couple of months ago . 
   considering the world stage they 're basically the only real opposition to boeing/airbus together with embraer from brazil . 
  i think russia has to be replaced with bombardier . 
  their new cseries is promising . 
  the only jet currently being produced in fair numbers in russia is ssj100 . 
  it 's difficult to call that a real opposition . 
  most of ssjs are in aeroflot which is forced to buy them . 
  it does n't really seem it 's a very competitive plane . 
  e.g. , non-state-controlled s7 airlines want to buy embraers . 
  edit : i remember that airbaltic wanted to buy ssjs . 
  but then our relations quickly deteriorated . 
  i do n't . 
  i would appreciate a source with a direct quote . 
  however , how is it even relevant ? 
  i you think it justifies censorship , i disagree . 
  we have a lot of tatra t3s in nizhny novgorod . 
  however , some of them are in a terrible state inside : [ pic ] ( http://transit.parovoz.com/muralista-data/ru52/20080323_7696.jpg ) . 
  others are restored and look quite nice : [ pic ] ( http://transphoto.ru/photo/09/06/09/906091.jpg ) . 
   pretty much unregulated russian internet really ?
