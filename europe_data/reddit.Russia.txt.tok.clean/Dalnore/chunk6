  a few major internet media in russia have been captured by pro-kremlin people . 
  the most notable is lenta.ru , which used to be the most popular russian news website , but currently is a disgrace to its former self . 
  censorship on the internet is still not that widespread , but some political sites like the garry kasparov 's blog and several ukrainian news outlets are banned . 
   on what topic tv presents most objective information  foreign policy , 58 % that could be funny if i did n't live among these people . 
  levada is not controlled by our authorities . 
  and its director , lev gudkov , is often critical of the kremlin . 
   went to a pride parade in st. petersburg ( florida , usa ) i was really impressed until i saw the parentheses . 
  by the way , st. petersburg was the first ( and , afaik , currently the only one ) city in russia to hold a pride parade coordinated with the local authorities . 
  i 've never understood this argument . 
  they say it like the baltic countries could n't build these things themselves . 
  my ferry between tallinn and helsinki did n't have passport control . 
  still nothing compared to the number of authors of some physics papers . 
  i do n't think there is any rule prohibiting traveling to lithuania with any other schengen visa . 
  of course he could enter from poland ( btw , he is banned from latvia ) . 
  but , if his claim is true , why would he even try doing that ? 
  it 's possible that he has a schengen visa issued by another country . 
  you 'd better say that to the czechs . 
  that 's no opposition . 
  there are exactly 0 people from the opposition left in the parliament . 
  the last one was ponomaryov . 
  i find letter \u0142 somewhat strange . 
  i see \u0141\u00f3d\u017a , in my language it 's written and pronounced as \u041b\u043e\u0434\u0437\u044c ( lodz ' ) , but in polish it 's actually pronounced as something like * woodge * . 
  it 's much harder for us , it seems . 
  but somewhat knowing ukrainian helps a lot with polish . 
  putin will probably let him do almost anything as long as he 's loyal . 
  kadyrov is the highest authority , and he believes sharia law is above russian . 
  i have to disagree . 
  chechnya under kadyrov right now is basically an authoritarian muslim state where russian laws have little to no power . 
  yes , but to a much lesser extent . 
  some people tend to be somewhat hostile to non-russians in general , but it 's mostly a political issue , i think . 
  as an exception , most people here seem to hate romani people . 
  i think he definitely uses something to look younger . 
  he 's 63 , but there are almost no wrinkles on his face . 
  it 's not about `` russian by citizenship '' . 
  according to our constitution , ethnicity is a matter of self-identification . 
  no one except me has the right to define my ethnicity . 
  of course it 's not like that in the real life , and people would still put labels on me . 
  a fun fact : * russian * ( \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 / russkiy ) is the only ethnicity which is denoted by an adjective in the russian language . 
  both a person and a language can be called * \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 * , which is not the case for any other ethnicity . 
   ethnic russians are almost entirely descended from mongols . 
  what ?!, 
  do you have anything to support this claim ? 
  i have [ a scientific article ] ( http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.09.019 ) which seems to prove otherwise . 
  by the way , try looking at putin 's face when he was young . 
  now his face has too much botox . 
  that 's how it is in english . 
  there is no such differentiation between ethnicity and citizenship for most other countries in russian , though . 
  by the way , a person is called not * \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 * ( * rossiiskiy * ) , but * \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0438\u043d * ( * rossiyanin * ) , as nationalities are nouns in russian . 
  * russian * can mean both of russian ethnicity and of russian citizenship . 
  funnily enough , in the russian language these two meanings have different adjectives . 
  there actually is a second meaning of * nationality * ( definition from oxford dictionary ) :  an ethnic group forming a part of one or more political nations, 
  i think it is very common to be at least a little bit racist towards non-slavs in russia . 
  when somebody talks about people from caucasus and central asia , a term '' \u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0436\u043e\u043f\u044b\u0439 '' ( literally `` black-ass '' ) or other rude words are often used . 
  as i like traveling , for me it 's pretty damn terrible . 
  without this consideration , it 's not that bad , but i still ca n't get used to prices for electronics . 
  i guess i 'm not buying high-end pcs and smartphones in the nearest future . 
  it 's rather easy to get good education in russia for free . 
  however , the scholarship of $ 40/month sucks , so i also worked part-time since my third year . 
  given the current situation , it 's more likely we 'll cut off ourselves from the internet someday . 
  as long as the average russian thinks `` look how many roads , hospitals and schools we 've built for you , why do you hate us ?!, 
  you ungrateful bastards ! '', 
  about people from baltic states and fail to understand what ussr was to them , the dislike is fully justified . 
  we do n't have this bullshit ( maybe yet ) . 
  i think you underestimate the power of our media . 
  i 'm from a large city and i think what / u/occupythekremlin says is quite true . 
  something like `` alexander smirnov '' . 
  putin 's mass media is often stronger than family bonds . 
  it 's always either `` to fight terrorism '' or `` to protect children '' . 
  flags do not necessarily represent loyalty . 
  they may simply represent citizenship or residency . 
  liberal democratic party is neither liberal nor democratic . 
  orly ? 
   great !, 
  well done !, 
  i wonder why they included kazakhstan in the european quiz . 
  indeed , but it takes a special kind of insane to say it out loud . 
  for example , you would never hear such things coming from putin 's mouth . 
  though violence as a solution is somewhat common in russia , it 's not universal . 
  it 's way less common among well-educated people . 
  for example , i despise violence and i 've never deliberately hit people . 
  200 eur ( for air tickets ) is not that much for people in moscow . 
   igor lebedev well , he is a son of vladimir zhirinovsky who is notorious for saying ridiculous and terrifying things ( like after brussels bombings : `` terrorist acts in europe are beneficial to russia . 
  let them die and perish '' ) . 
  i guess he just follows the footsteps of his father . 
  russia is mostly an european country , you know . 
  of course . 
  gay rally is a perfect opportunity to show that ukraine `` has no moral values left '' and is `` ruled by western puppets '' . 
  i wonder if they 'll be able to link this rally to fascism somehow . 
  edit : a news presenter at a major weekend news program '' \u0412\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u041d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438 '' ( `` news of the week '' ) dmitry kiselev once said about gay people : `` i think they should be banned from donating blood or sperm , and if they die in a car crash , their hearts should be burnt or buried in the ground as unsuitable for the continuation of life '', 
   on what grounds are they prohibiting the rallies though ? 
  usually they cite security issues or backlash from the society . 
   also ca n't it be overturned by higher courts ? 
  russian courts would never overturn these decisions . 
  the highest possible court , the european court of human rights , has ruled these prohibitions illegal several times , but russia , despite being in the counsil of europe , does n't really care about this court . 
  in the near future , certainly not . 
  gay rallies in moscow are prohibited by the moscow city court until 2112 ( they became tired of prohibiting it every single year and made a prohibition for a 100 years in 2012 ) . 
  but everything may happen in the more or less distant future . 
  homosexuality has been removed from icd just 26 years ago . 
  lgbt movement is very young , but there has been huge progress in a relatively short period of time . 
  i believe the same thing should inevitable happen even in conservative russia .
