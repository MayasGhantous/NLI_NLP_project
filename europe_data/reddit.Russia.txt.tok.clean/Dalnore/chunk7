   also , happy russia day everyone !, 
  i want to see the reaction of our `` reporters '' in the evening news . 
  i 'm not sure i 'll be able to handle it though . 
  that 's decent progress compared to the previous year . 
  i hope there 'll be a time when such intense police protection wo n't be necessary . 
  i hope we 'll finally have one in moscow as well . 
  `` as the swede at poltava '' ( '' \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0448\u0432\u0435\u0434 \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0439 '' ) is a synonym of `` a complete failure '' , not `` weak '' . 
  for example , it may be used to describe a situation when your plan utterly fails . 
  it does n't mean you 're weak . 
  i ca n't say for bulgaria , but nasreddin is very well-known in russia . 
  stories about him are included in the school literature program . 
  so i wo n't be surprised if he 's well-known in bulgaria as well , those stories are awesome . 
  that 's not unexpected for a book from 1984 . 
  icd-9 listed homosexuality as a mental illness before it was removed from icd-10 in 1990 . 
  polish language has a lot of hushing sounds . 
  so for a completely unprepared russian fast polish speech sounds like `` pshe-pshe-pshe '' ( i believe it 's actually written as prze in polish ) with situational inclusion of `` kurwa '' . 
  i 'd guess , in russian . 
  some of these are definitely popular stereotypes , like estonians speaking slowly and belarusians liking potatoes . 
  for polish the stereotype other than `` against russia '' would be `` say ` pshe ' '' . 
  i 'm not completely sure of the origin , but it has become somewhat common in certain blogs to call ukraine `` country 404 '' meaning that it has failed as a sovereign state . 
  4 russian cities and no nizhny novgorod ? 
  i wish my city became relevant once again . 
  though the music is still the same , the lyrics are totally different . 
  russian is also not about fighting but about love for the country . 
  knowing some of the guys in top-10 personally , i 'm proud of such great results . 
  well , the bbc article is exactly about it . 
  using only big macs seems like a terrible idea . 
  but nonetheless lets take the information from the big mac index . 
  in jan 2014 the price was 89 rub ( 2.62 usd ) , in jan 2016 114 rub ( 1.63 usd ) . 
  nominal gdps per capita are 13,872 and 7,742 for 2014 and 2016 . 
  so , if we adjust the 2016 gdp to the changed prices we get 7,742 * 2.62 / 1.63 = 12,444 , which gives us a decline of ~ 10 % in gdp ppp using a very rough metric . 
  i still do n't think it 's anywhere close to being a reliable metric even when compared to our official statistics . 
  we 've already had nashi and the young guard of united russia . 
  `` gdp , current prices '' should never be used to calculate gdp change . 
  the imf site does n't even have this option to choose from if you want percents . 
  here is what you should be looking at instead : https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=60&amp;pr.y=7&amp;sy=2014&amp;ey=2021&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=922%2c926&amp;s=ngdp_rpch&amp;grp=0&amp;a=, 
  not really ... 
  i guess such difference is explained by a simple fact that the average wage in finland is just larger than in russia even after adjusting to ppp . 
   gdp per capita dropped 45 % from 2014 where does this information come from ? 
  the world bank forecasts show several percent drop which is already bad enough . 
  we 've had such a huge drop as you mention in two years of 1998-1999 when we had to default , but the current crisis is nowhere near close to that one . 
  i 'm fully aware of that . 
  i just happen to like traveling . 
  there is no overall good for everything metric , i guess . 
  does n't seem that bad for us until you realize that ppp metrics really suck when you travel to other countries . 
   what 's the current price of big mac in russia ? 
  should be about 120 rub ( less than 2 usd ) . 
  i would say that russia is responsible even if the buk was stolen from ukrainians as the aggressor which had started the conflict . 
  but it will probably not be possible to use this reasoning in the court . 
  worlds first airliner . 
  til we have mandatory winter tires . 
  i just always happen to change them because i want to stay alive . 
  capitalized '' \u0412\u044b '' should always used in the following cases : * in official documents when addressing a single person . 
  * in private correspondence when politely addressing a single person . 
  * in surveys , questionnaires and other forms that should be filled in by a single person . 
  in other cases singular form can be both '' \u0432\u044b '' and '' \u0412\u044b '' ( to express deep respect ) . 
  for example , in interview transcriptions it is usually non-capitalized even though the person being addressed is single . 
  in plural ( when addressing a group of people ) '' \u0432\u044b '' is never capitalized . 
  that 's a common misconception . 
  non-capitalized '' \u0432\u044b '' can be used in singular as well . 
  capitalized '' \u0412\u044b '' is usually limited to private correspondence and official documents , in other cases singular non-capitalized '' \u0432\u044b '' is correct too . 
  see http://new.gramota.ru/spravka/letters/22-spravka/letters/51-rubric-88, 
  '' \u0412\u044b '' is both polite singular and plural . 
  it can begin with a capital letter only when it is singular , though . 
  capital letters in russian are mostly limited to proper nouns . 
  some exceptions are * titles in officials papers ( like '' \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 '' -- `` the president of russian federation '' ) ; * words like '' \u0411\u043e\u0433 '' ( `` god '' when referring to the god of a monotheistic religion ) or '' \u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 '' ( `` homeland '' when referring to your own country ) ; * the pronoun '' \u0412\u044b '' ( `` you '' ) . 
  in russian there are two pronouns for singular `` you '' . 
  one is '' \u0442\u044b '' , which is informal and used to address relatives , friends , and sometimes people younger or of lower position than you . 
  the second one is '' \u0432\u044b / \u0412\u044b '' , which is the polite version and is often capitalized in correspondence . 
  yes . 
  i 'm also a progressive russian . 
  i vocally express my opinion on this topic whenever it is brought up among people i know . 
  murders based on hatred exist . 
  in russia , they are often ignored by the police . 
  but they are not overwhelmingly widespread , high suicide rates due to social stigmatization are a bigger issue . 
  i should also note that the murder rate in russia is the highest in europe , more than 10 times higher than in the netherlands . 
  it 's not a very safe country in general . 
   what if you live in a smaller town or village ? 
  you 'd better move to a large city as soon as you can . 
  and not only because of that , but because living in small towns really sucks in russia . 
   if you do n't have to live their life but i happen to have to . 
  i 'd say europeans are just used to a very high standard of living . 
  world overall is not as nice a place as europe . 
  if we are to use such strong words like `` living hell '' for anything , it devalues their meaning . 
  what my grandmother lived through in 1940s was living hell . 
  war is living hell . 
  what happens to anyone who opposes islamism in certain countries is living hell . 
  having no access to any kind of medicine and enough food is living hell . 
  russia is not a nice place to live for homosexuals , and has been becoming increasingly worse in the recent years , but i still would n't describe it as `` living in fear '' , but as `` living with caution '' . 
  it 's somewhat similar to europe and america several decades ago . 
  being completely open about it can damage your career and increases chances you 'll get picked on in the street . 
  but it 's not that hard to find friends who will either support you or at least not care . 
   living hell i would n't use such strong words . 
  putin indeed made things worse , and russia is rather bad compared to europe in that regard , but things are better than during the soviet times . 
  and there still are countries where being homosexual is punished by a death sentence . 
  it 's not even * their * country . 
  chechnya just quite openly ignores russian legislation . 
  120 kmh for russia . 
  not surprising we have high mortality in car accidents . 
  no , i did n't confuse it with doc .
