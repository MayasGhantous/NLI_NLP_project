  by the way ... afaik , all metro stations in russia have metal detectors at each entrance . 
  this shows how useless these security measures could actually be . 
  in two different metro stations . 
  edit : national anti-terrorist committee says it was a single explosion . 
  oh dear ... that 's terrible . 
  my condolences to those who were injured and to the relatives and friends of those who perished . 
  but you can protect freedom of religion . 
  islamic fundamentalism should not be tolerated , but i ca n't see why should i treat islam differently from christianity . 
  e.g. , muslims from tatarstan are not worse than russian christians regarding gay and women rights . 
  wow , great , dailymotion is banned in russia due to copyright infringement . 
   honestly , this is not what i 've said  yeah , but i ca n't agree that russia as a whole is a failed state . 
  the government has firm control ( i 'd even say too much control ) over the majority of its territories , basic public services are provided , it is accepted by the international community . 
  it 's not the most stable state , though , i wo n't be very surprised if it fails again during my lifespan . 
  i do agree that russia has failed in chechnya , but i do n't see an easy solution . 
  i 'll also add an opinion by heda saratova , the human rights defender at chechen human rights council ( translated from [ here ] ( https://govoritmoskva.ru/news/115110/ ) ) :  i can not draw the line , but i can say that even extreme measures against such people will not be condemned by the society we live in . 
  i think that , even if such a person is killed by his relatives , they will do anything to avoid disclosing it . 
  the entire judicial system , including the authorities , will take into consideration what happened in this family . 
  and they will not make a fuss and protect this person . 
  i have not received a single statement of claim , but i would not even consider it . 
   i 'm a chechen , i live in this society , and what you say is even worse than war . 
  if we close our eyes to this today , i am sure that our society will decompose , and this in no way should be tolerated . 
  i assure you , in our chechen society a person who respects himself , traditions and customs , he himself will , without any authorities , persecute and do everything to make sure such people in our society do not exist . 
  this is an evil with which every chechen will fight . 
  `` human rights defender '' , my ass . 
  to be fair , chechnya is vastly different from the rest of russia . 
  if this happened in my oblast ' , i would be genuinely surprised and terrified . 
  seems like we do n't have enough alive decapitated people to influence this value . 
  as far as i understand , / u/snijok90 is from ukraine . 
  this makes your inquiry look rather dumb . 
   a `` referendum '' was held and people `` voted '' ftfy, 
   only in serif fonts that 's not always true . 
  e.g. , in very popular sans serif arial they are different : \u041a and k ( for those who use the web version and have arial ) . 
  the lowercase ones ( \u043ak ) are always different . 
  edit : apparently , they are also different in roboto , the default sans serif on android . 
  damn , below zero again . 
  at least it delays my allergy . 
  these protests are bigger than anything we had since 2011-2012 , especially in provincial cities . 
  i do n't remember any comparable events in nizhny novgorod at all . 
  by the amount of people arrested ( more than 1000 in moscow ) , they are probably the biggest in the history of rufed . 
  seems like the case . 
  there were quite a few people with sneakers in moscow . 
  sneakers were the catalyst of the whole deal . 
  there is an explanation in the video . 
  tl ; dw : navalny 's team investigated a 2-year-old dump of a hacked medvedev 's mailbox and found quite a lot of orders of clothes and sneakers , which were confirmed to be for medvedev personally , as he appeared in these items in his photos . 
  the delivery address of the items corresponded to a medvedev 's friend and his charity fund . 
  they have started digging into it and found a lot more , leading to this investigation . 
  since when ? 
  the last time i remember him being under home arrest was in 2015 . 
  it was triggered by the investigation on russian prime minister dmitry medvedev made by navalny and his team : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrwlk7_gf9g ( with english subtitles ) . 
  the video shows multiple `` charity funds '' and other muddy ways which are used to hide property actually used by medvedev , like two yachts , several big residences , wineyards in russia and italy . 
  the russian government and media have been completely silent on this topic ; the organizers want them to at least make a response . 
  germany is # 7 in the world by total earnings , uk is # 11 , they are fine . 
  italy is really underwhelming though , only # 37 . 
  well , it 's live online . 
  i knew sergey lazarev and polina gagarina , they are popular singers in russia . 
   russians are illiterate in terms of the ability to use english . 
  what ? 
  many indeed are , but there are quite a few russians ( not trolls ) actively commenting in this sub . 
  some of them support our government , some do n't . 
  russian trolls commenting in english also exist . 
  during the paralympics , which are way less popular than the olympics . 
  as far as i understand , she is mostly known as a finalist of the a factor which does n't mean that much . 
  i , for one , have never heard of her prior to this eurovision nomination . 
  how can ukraine enforce tighter controls on the borders it ca n't control at all ? 
  i do n't know , the eu seems to struggle with greece which is smaller and way more developed . 
  ukrainian gdp per capita is ~ 3000 usd , the average monthly wage is less than $ 200 , and ukraine scores very low in terms of corruption . 
  it can improve in the future , but i doubt it will be in just a few years . 
  i think georgia is more likely to join the eu earlier than ukraine . 
  such a weak economy for such a big country as ukraine would probably become a huge problem for the eu if it joined it . 
  hulk for the president !, 
  your obsession with putin is ridiculous . 
  moscow city project had been created before putin even came to power . 
  the highest building was designed in 2001 , when putin was just in the beginning of his first term and nowhere close to being a dictator . 
  if you want to find someones personal ambitions , that would be luzhkov , the former mayor of moscow . 
  well , those buildings are not like the [ palace of the soviets ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/palace_of_the_soviets ) , they are for business . 
  china , the us have a lot of skyscrapers probably not because they compensate for something . 
  moscow and st. petersburg are really big cities , skyscrapers do n't feel out of place there . 
  in 2012 , the tallest building in europe was built in london which is also a very big city . 
  the uk does n't seem like `` the worst dictatorship '' . 
   if he died tomorrow there would be some serious turbulence . 
  well , this is mostly his fault . 
  if we had properly functioning democratic institutions , there would n't be so many problem with changing the leader . 
  towers are [ nonbuilding structures ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nonbuilding_structure ) , they do n't count . 
  actually , the top-3 tallest buildings in europe are in moscow , russia . 
  the tallest one is the [ federation tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federation_tower ) in moscow . 
  the tallest building under construction is [ lakhta center ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lakhta_center ) in st. petersburg ( 462 m , should be completed next year ) . 
  btw , the tallest structure in europe is also in moscow : the [ ostankino tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostankino_tower ) . 
  if  350m was in a separate category , russia would leave the uk behind too . 
  are n't the basics of cli ( at least cmd in windows ) taught in schools ? 
  unix shell is actually a very convenient tool , better than gui in many cases . 
   whenever russia collapses it somehow manages to rebuild itself in some even more nightmarish and totalitarian vision how many times has this happened ? 
  one ? 
  modern russia is nowhere close to being `` more nightmarish and totalitarian '' than the ussr . 
  at least yet . 
  their whole staff are mostly russians . 
  riga has been chosen just as a place safe from kremlin . 
  just look at the relevant wikipedia articles , they have the maps : [ war in donbass ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_in_donbass ) , [ abkhazia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abkhazia ) , [ south ossetia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_ossetia ) . 
  the only region actually annexed by russia is crimea . 
  russia recognizes abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states . 
  russia does not recognize donetsk and luhansk people 's republics .
