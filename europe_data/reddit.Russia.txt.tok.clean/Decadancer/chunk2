  what chances are , this is the mountain nearby the town i 've been living in . 
  just google `` crimean landscape '' , you 'd be amazed . 
  apparently you 're right . 
  i will see more into it . 
  source ? 
  btw , if it 's not from rt , it does n't count ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s upd : alright , it 's true , i 'm bad, 
  it 's a very cool place . 
  i tell you , every summer for my whole life i 've been there . 
  mountains for back-country camping and climbing , hills for paragliding and basejumping , sea for all sorts of fun , cheap places ( well , while it was in ukraine it was true , now much more expensive ) , small authentic towns and so on and so on . 
  cheap and high class wine and brandy everywhere . 
  was n't alive by that time , but friend of mine told me it was very-very possible to live there like a king on 50 $ for whole summer in 1990s . 
  unfortunately , it seems that after the bridge will be up , this romantics will go to hell , being killed by expensive hotels and high-dense districts being built on shore . 
  i 'll take some time and update later , deal ? 
  btw what does your flair mean ? 
  ca n't find translation in google, 
  well we ca n't know for sure what happened in both cases , and you may be right . 
  however , from what i 've heard about turk-armenian incident , it really shows clear racial hatred . 
   the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour , followed by the deportation of women , children , the elderly and infirm on death marches leading to the syrian desert . 
  -- wiki about armenian genocide i have n't ever heard about such or similar actions by russian empire towards circassians , and i do n't think they did happen . 
  it 's not like everyone of them , including women and children , was our enemy , but more like those who showed armed agression against russian troops . 
  so it seems like there is difference between these two cases . 
  however , i 'm not sure and may be wrong , so will investigate more about these events . 
  well , that is true that the area is a complete clusterfuck , and caucasian war is still going on after several centuries from its beginning . 
  ~ ~ however , i do n't think you may say it was a straight-up genocide , more like empire wanted to govern there , whereas some of the local nations did n't want it like that . 
  not all of them . 
  so killings were happening , not that `` i hate you for your skin colour and i will kill you '' . 
  more like `` i 'm the power and my troops will be here '' ~ ~ ~ ~ you ca n't even compare it with native american genocide in north america , for example , because it was n't really for land , nobody from russian middle-zone would go south to the mountains just to live there . ~ ~ #update : it seems that i 'm wrong , according to several both russian and english sources . 
  nope , i do n't mean it . 
  just poor sentence constructure . 
  armenian genocide did happen though , it is only fair to recognise it . 
  90 % you know, 
  there is literally no reason to cut ties with egypt apart from this one . 
  it is true . 
  crimea bridge will be done in a year or two , then heavy infrustructure comes to crimea with hotels and other resorts, 
  well , not always , but there are some individuals who find doing it to be funny, 
  ukraine is n't even in nato , then what is the difference between these actions and previous annextion ? 
  i do n't say it was legitimate or whatever , but nato has as equally zero rights to commit any armed actions in crimea as russia . 
  yeah , my bad, 
  cool word , maybe we could use it here especially since there was no snow until a couple days ago and it would sound very close to original pronunciation, 
  16 rubles =  0.20 eurocents upd : ofc 20 cents aka 0.20 euro , also wanted to emphasize that our post is shit and letter can travel for several weeks inside the country , with huge logistical mistakes, 
  well i feel sad and confused . 
  i ca n't claim that i 'm much patriotic , i do n't support our government either , but all these news just make me ask the direction we as the world , as the country , are moving . 
  i feel sad that people ca n't live peacefully . 
  i 'm sick of politics . 
  i 'm mad that everything is unclear and you ca n't say what and who is right and wrong . 
  so they 're terrorists assisting turkey in getting oil from is ? 
  what 's wrong ? 
  i can agree with you , however , i doubt that these turkmen brugades are fighting isis , at least some of them support it . 
  why else would they kill parachutists and shoot down russian heli then ? 
  it seems to be worth calling terrorism . 
  ok , thanks for your explanation . 
  so , your point is that now russia is bombing not only isis but also assad opposition who are fighting isis ? 
  but you said yourself that they 're rebels . 
  so are they against assad and isis at once ? 
  source ? 
  btw i 'm not watching russian tv , and i 'm not even pro-russian , i 'm just tired of hypocrisy, 
  those who support is ? 
  yes . 
  russia is not violating syrian airspace , the army is there because syrian govmnt invited them, 
  i understand your point , too , and just want to ask the following : next time turk jet violates syrian air border ( because they do it , too ) , are you ready to see it taken down ? 
  would you say it is just and correct answer to the violation ? 
  no , but people are furious because it was completely unnecessary act of violence . 
  turkey has violated syrian and greek airspaces countless times . 
  so now what ? 
  were those planes shot down ? 
  now what do we see here ? 
  `` oh , jet is coming through our 3-km territory in 10 seconds ? 
  let 's shoot it down when it is already on syrian territory ! '', 
  why ? 
  cool , thanks for honesty . 
  never thought about turkey as an enemy , but thanks for clarification . 
  still you claim that russia is evil , despite the fact it was us who brought this tension to the region 15 years ago . 
  oh , so america destroying normal countries like iraq and syria is ok then ? 
  and since when are we enemies ? 
  tbh there are some loops on the right side so who knows, 
  well , do we know that exactly ? 
  i mean , i admit that i may be wrong , but the problem is is the lack of informarion and its trustworthyness . 
  how do you know that al-assad is bad , for example , and that rebels are right ? 
  i do n't even know , honestly . 
  i can think what are the reasons for it to be true , for example , armenian or bulgar genocide and several wars in xix century , however it was long ago . 
  maybe so , but i have n't noticed just a straight hate towards turkish people . 
  well , because it is russian pilot who is dead , so understable . 
  however , hate is no good . 
  maybe russians are more agressive , too . 
  i think you 're wrong , at least what i 've heard . 
  turk rebels are fighting kurds . 
  kurds are fighting is . 
  so , de facto turks are fighting for is, 
  i thought the goal was to destroy isis not nato, 
  i am bit confused because if red trajectory is the russian plane , it only flew about 3 kilometres on turkish space before entering syrian , what will take less than a ** minute ** at speed near 300 km/h . 
  so question is -- was the plane really violating the border for 5 minutes ? 
  lol , how is bombing turk ** rebels ** was n't helping fight against is ? 
  however , if these rebels were threat for whole world , they should be destroyed , and sweden is wrong in clearly opposing this, 
  cool . 
  defence department stated that the plane was not violating turkish airspace . 
  if it 's true , everything gon na b bad next week anyway , this is fucking stupid . 
  turkey is doing some crazy shit , and nobody gives a damn . 
  would they shoot american or french plane ? 
  i doubt that . 
  i still do n't understand why you are so mad , lol some personal issues ?
