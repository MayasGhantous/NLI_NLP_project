wow !!!, 
  i always travel to uk for work ... and i did it so much that sometimes i forgot that london is not only skyscrapers . 
  hollande will win the 2nd round that is inevitable, 
  i saw it on the news you are right, 
  i 'm canadian so cant speak for europe but in this case . . 
  i think the us intervention is what we can call a good one ... ( please dont throw rock at me !, 
  i 'm not independantist , but we have a consensus in quebec from both independantist and federalist that the british rule was awful . 
  and you are wrong for the americans . 
  as soon the american declared independance the first thing they did toward us was that . 
  they sent benjamin franklin to propose us statehood and equal right and the protection of our language . 
  the british would only propose that after our first rebellion in 1836 . 
  they did the same thing with louisiana  and never tried to force them to give up french and learn english . 
  biggest joke ever ... the most bloodiest conflit on the canadian soil was around that idea . . [ patriot revolt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lower_canada_rebellion ) british tried many times to assimilate french but fail that was the main policy of the british government just read the [ durham report ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/report_on_the_affairs_of_british_north_america ) , read [ the metis rebelion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_river_rebellion ) rebelion , ontario french canadian assimilation , and the cause of the [ quiet revolution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quiet_revolution ) btw louisianna didnt even have half of the population of quebec . . we had clever french canadian politicians that saw the danger of staying quiet with uk and block all the attempt of [ imperialist faction ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imperial_federation ) to try to integrate us to uk and instead they push to create a bilingual canadian identity . 
  ** tldr : ** british rule was disguting for half of the population of canada, 
  the french canadian i am will disagree ... 
  yep he is clearly serious [ just here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pilvaz-jczg&amp;list=rdpilvaz-jczg#t=14 ), 
  kenyan and you are in poland ? 
  how the life is in poland for you ? 
  you are definitely right muslims are 3.2 % of the population of canada and they dont cause much trouble , i mean never saw a canadian politician talking publicly againts muslim , the far right almost dont even exist in canada !, 
  way to go ngos ... lets criticize the us-eu free trade deal ... but we will say nothing about the other 14 trades agreements that europe are negociating right now ( they are already in the 8 rounds with india and 9 rounds with mercosur ) . 
  hey but thats not a problem ... eu can do free trade with everyone except the usa ... 
   do you even know yourself what this vague vocabulary is intended to imply ? 
  norway is doing fine without the eu , as is iceland . 
  but ... but . . 
  they both have a juicy trade agreement ... and they have access to the eu 's single market and they adopt most eu legislation related to that market . 
  norway is even part of the shengen area . 
  yep they are doing fine with one foot in the eu door . 
  europe drag america in libya, 
  consider this war is over theres no way in hell that the rebels will still be here after the summer . 
  as a canadian i approve this message . 
   western companies never really managed to penetrate the japanese of korean markets but they managed to penetrate , singapore and malaysia markets korean and japanese market are hard to enter for the simple reason that [ chaebols ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chaebol ) and [ kereitsu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/keiretsu ) are dominating the korean and the japanese market coupled with heavy protectionism on keys sectors . 
  china dont have such interlocked companies outside the state plus chinese are definitely aiming for profits not market share.the japanese and korean system may look good but in the long run that kind of system destroy littles companies and entrepreneurship in japan and korea + may lead to a [ lost decade ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lost_decade_ ( japan ) in the case of japan . 
  and both are vulnerable to crisis see [ asia crisis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_asian_financial_crisis ) . 
  china would likely have a lost decade + a heavy crisis . 
  the guy totally crush you with facts . 
  i saw this new on foreign newspaper . 
  but no newspaper in france talk about that event even the far right newspaper [ minute ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minute_ ( french_newspaper ) and not even the center right [ le figaro ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/le_figaro ) not even the far left and the left newspapers in france . 
  i 'm maybe wrong or too early . . 
  i feel the cup will stay in europe for a long time . 
   america on the other hand is a federalised super state where each ** state has no identity or individualism , ** texas , southern states and northern state , california , new york and hawai . . 
  they dont have any identity right ... they are all the same ... right ? 
  and here a study for the recidivism rate in other crime from 2011 by university of british columbia forensic psychiatric hospital , canada and the maastricht university , netherlands  evaluating research on recidivism rates , it is apparent that approximately 52 % of the general offender population , between 31 % and 85 % of mentally ill offenders , and as many as 70-87 % of forensic patients do not reoffend after release http://www.academia.edu/1465126/resilience_and_successful_community_reintegration_among_female_forensic_psychiatric_patients_a_preliminary_investigation, 
  i was talking about the paedophile thing . . 
  i said it earlier and one of my comment the 25 % that are recidivist and 75 % that are not . . read my previous comment the study is here and btw i edit my my previous reply, 
  ok that will be quick  i read both your comments . 
  you 're sending a mixed message here ... 
  i was talking about the fact that child sex offenders are posted online for the public . 
  its ineffective  i just do n't believe the `` right to be forgotten '' is the proper approach yes it is ... only police should have access to criminal data and your past ... for example the guy may erase everything online from the public but if the police still have access to the file its ok and almost perfect . 
   and i believe there are better ways of handling that issue i would like to hear your solutions . . for the moment reintegration and to hide the criminals backgroung of someone to the public are the best solution for the moment . 
  75 % of success if you want to reach the 100 % . . go ahead and just do a study and we will see . 
   why ?!, 
  that 's the fucking question i 'm asking . 
  i do n't believe you need to be forgotten in order to start a new life it will make thing easier for them since the public will not have access . 
  if one day your neighbour decide to type your name on the internet just for fun and find that you did something bad in the past . . 
  i 'm sure their attitude will change even if that was the past and that may affect your whole life ... for example if you have children or family ... 
  i 'm not sure the neighbours will allow their son to play with the son of an ex-felon . . your child may be affected by your past ... you may lose your position in the parents association , people at work will dodge you etc. . . your wife could be affected also and your life may be crush just because your neighbour was curious . . simple example like that are a reason to be forgotten . 
  if its only the police that have the files on the guy this is not a problem ... you should wach the documentary [ hiltler children ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2359085/ ) 7/10 on imbdv its a look into the lives of the descendants of the top nazi officials who worked under hitler 's command . 
  how what they ancestors did still affected their lives ... and the challenges of protecting their families as they pass their name down to future generations-or decide not to produce any descendants at all . 
  and here an article on the [ new york times ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/us/killers-families-left-to-confront-fear-and-shame.html?pagewanted=all ) on how killers and small offenders ' families left to confront fear and shame . 
   btw we will always know for the big guys ... read streisand big guy are not the majority of the system , majority should not pay for the minority ... 
  if you think 25 % is high thats your math not mine but we can reverse 75 % that are not recidivist this is pretty good for me and they have the right to be forgotten ...  which has no `` right to be forgotten '' laws . 
  child sex offenders are posted online in the us its fairly ineffective . . again you didnt read anything ...  a study done by professors from columbia university and the university of michigan found that having ** police-only sex offender registries ( such as the registries in britain , canada and australia ) ** significantly reduces sex offender recidivism , ** but making information about sex offenders publicly available significantly increases recidivism rates . 
  ** http://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/jrockoff/papers/prescott%20rockoff%20meglaw%20jan%2010.pdf the congressional report is not about only child offenders but various criminals . 
  if you had truly read the report you would have seen that many were layoff because employers found about their past ... even if they were truly reintegrate ...  i 's just another loophole for criminals to escape through ** ex criminals . . who want a new start ** . 
  i dont have a particular opinion but offenders including sexual offenders , even gordon gekko should have the right to be forgotten and not to be remember to start a new life . 
  only the police should have the right to access to the criminal past of someone ... not the public all my sources are recent ... 
  the columbia study is from 2010 and the congressionnal report from february 2014 btw we will always know for the big guys ... read [ streisand effect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streisand_effect ), 
  you didnt read your own sources  estimates of recidivism vary because ** studies define this term in different ways ** . 
  ** one review found recidivism rates of 10 % to 50 % among pedophiles previously convicted of sexual abuse ** although this could include anything from an arrest for any offense to reconviction on a crime against a child . 
  ** one long-term study ** of previously convicted pedophiles ( with an average follow-up of 25 years ) found that ** one-fourth of heterosexual pedophiles ** and ** one-half of homosexual or bisexual ** pedophiles went on to commit another sexual offense against children . 
  studies have shown 96-98 % of the men ( paedophiles ) identifed as heterosexual/straight and only2-3 % identified as homosexual . 
  so if only 25 % of the 98 % are recidivist . 
  i dont consider that as high . 
   there is some encouraging news . 
  sexual crimes against u.s. children , as recorded by law enforcement agencies , declined 53 % between 1992 and 2006 . 
  a review identified four possible explanations for the decline : economic growth , increased numbers of police and child protection workers , greater efforts to identify and prosecute child sex offenders of all types , and ** increased treatment of aggressive behavior . ** . 
  and according to this congressional research from february 2014 reintegration is better and more effective in the us http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/rl34287.pdf, 
  please give me the sources for the stabbing i would love to see that, 
  i dont want to pick a fight with you bro ... 
  i just saw where you were going with your `` homogenous thing '', 
  yeah blame the police ... and i didnt even show you the corruption index of slovakia and poland ... 
  unfortunately uk ( 1.0 ) is better . . 
  how ??? 
  the crime rate for intentional homicide in slovakia and poland are much higher than in uk ??? 
  you can see the stats [ here ] from a unodc 's global study ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate ) plus [ violent crime ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-27119689 ) is falling in most western countries including uk ... 
  please explain me how poland and slovakia are better than uk ?? 
  nice no counter arguments ... 
  well this is exactly what i wrote that you were butthurt, 
   predictable . 
  just like every elections win of alexander lukashenko i dont know even the liberal opposition outsides and inside of belarus in their memorandum from what i read supported this point and the change of the date alone  but not the other change like the power of the president . 
   what i meant with the referendum is that it really was a disaster to the country so you are not belarussian and you are talking for them ... without nohing factual at that . 
   weffectively killed belarusian language etc. . . 
  such a fairytale . 
  you sound butthurt, 
  as a russian i am looking attentively what this american is saying   , 
   it seems that belarus did not cut off their communists time . 
  they decide to chose this national day with a referendum in 1995 ( after communism ) voters were asked whether independence day ( republic day ) should be moved to 3 july , the day of liberation of belarus . 
  if i remember well the results was 84 % . 
   do you think , that belarusians and ukrainians wanted to be taken by ussr at that time , and you had the right to their soil ? 
  considering the results maybe or maybe not it depend soviet invasion of poland is a national day in belarus .
