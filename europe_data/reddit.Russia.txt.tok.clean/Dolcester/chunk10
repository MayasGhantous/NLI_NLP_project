  in my case , always, 
  that has nothing to do with what you just asked  my original question was : in fact your original question was * so there is old guard , then there is liberals and oligarchs club . 
  where does that put putin and cooperative ozero ? 
  * wich finally , i did answer , there is no point to make a conversation . 
   and there was no mention of my state in there . 
  i know , i already told you that i deliberately mentionned it , 
  yes you are a big baby one at that a quick look on your comments history and how you engaged the conversation show it and see my edit are you saying that the oligarchs were not billionnaire before putin ? 
   want you to admit that after putin came to power his `` coop ozero '' - partners quickly became billionaires . 
  nothing else . 
  that was not your original question, 
   why are you trying to divert the discussion ? 
  did i say anything about my state ? 
  stick to the topic . 
  why major butthurt ? 
  i enjoy putting you down you wont make me stop  i did it i answered it while enjoying putting you down   in last 15 years . 
  sad that you are blind to this fact . 
  blind to fact ? 
  i was talking of the oligarchs that indeed were billionnaire before putin rise . 
  what do you want ? 
  and what are your inquiry , putin is part of the conservative and nationalist branch of united russia that start with his circle in the 90s wich finally took power . 
  lol you are butthurt because your failed state ( on somalia level ) is getting rape again hahaha putin is in power the oligarch had already their fortune it was either their side with him or be ready to walk away and to be put under pressure . 
  something your failed country does not have the capacity to do . 
  nemsov is associate `` with the 90s liberals and the oligarch club '' ( another category on their own ) no doubt about that . 
  prosperous ? 
  what was the average growth of the eu in the last 10 yeas compared to developped economy outsise it ? 
  when did wages rise ? 
  better , what is the current unemployement ? 
   jew ca n't be racist ? 
  til . 
  well you will learn something else i dont think they can be `` nazist '' wich the estonian guy `` use '', 
  you dont know russian politics much ... those are theories that doesnt add if not conspiracy ( yes they are ) zhirinovsky came into politics before putin and was third in popularity in the early 90s ( he had the same political opinions , during that time , putin was not even mayor ) he is the old guard , no politicians will disrespect the old guard no matter their political opinion and will let them talks no matter the nonsenses . 
   lol til usa today is a no name paper yes it is babe ( never saw it in international ) this is why it was easy to debunk  and that your mouth is shut , 
  sub went private rah rah ` merica '' boy you are throwing me a crappy midwest no name newspaper to prove something to a guy that trade commodities for his living ? 
  it does n't help that you did n't read my previous reply and that you did n't understand your own paper . 
  sorry i will stick with forbes , market analysis , research papers and oil executives and my own reports . 
  http://www.forbes.com/fdc/welcome_mjx.shtml now lets put you down ( i have a big day tomorrow ) first off , the fracking boom is over ; even in the usa ; you have to put more energy into ground then you get in btus you get out . 
  the only reason it took of in the us is because oil prices were high and it could under cut foreign imports ; since oil prices have come down many fracked wells have been abandoned it does not help that the american geophysical union has found out yesterday that [ fracking consume 28 times more water than it did 15 years ago ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/fracking-us-consuming-lot-more-water-it-used-1993514 ) with state like ny banning it 1 week ago and 6 others planning to do it . 
  as for natural gas , there is simply no cheap way to liquefy natural gas ; to ship natural gas requires expensive liquefaction , specialized ships , and expensive purpose-built receiving and storage terminals ; it nowhere near as cost efficient as natural gas that is simply compressed and shipped by pipeline . 
  on top of that , you are talking about the add cost of fracking the wells that simply natural gas !, 
  its not going to happen , russia will remain europe 's only source of natural gas . 
  furthermore your article conclusion is from is from a 2014 study and wrote clearly  russia also would n't be hurt right away by cheap lng imports , since its long-term contracts with europe would buffer the immediate impact . 
  * russian imports of 178.6 bcm in 2013 no less than 166 bcm was supplied under long-term contracts . 
  ( the sole exception were indeed uk imports which , as oies ( oxford institute for energy ) points out , probably did not come from russia at all , but were supplied by gazprom from other sources . ), 
  these contracts will not go away any time soon . 
  up to the mid-2020s , `` european companies are contractually obliged to import at least 115 bcm/year '' , oies points out . 
  in 2020 , european buyers will still have to purchase over 125 bcm of gas from gazprom ( or pay stiff penalties ) . 
  nor can sanctions intervene in these contracts . 
  furthermore the oies ( the oxford institute for energy studies ) also notes that russia can probably keep out lng supplies by lowering its prices . 
  the report adds that russia `` has the ability of delivering 250 bcm/year of pipeline gas to europe '' . 
  more generally , oies concludes that `` russian gas deliveries to europe will be highly competitive with all other pipeline gas and lng ( including us lng ) supplies throughout the period to 2030 , and gazprom 's market power to impact european hub prices may be considerable '' . 
  http://www.energypost.eu/everything-always-wanted-know-russian-gas-supplies-europe/ basically even until the mid 2020s , the u.s ( if fracking hasnt falling yet ) wont be able to match that ** not at all ** and does not have the capacity . 
  [ it does n't help that the worwlwatch institude has said 5 days ago that energy cost will rise as debt grows ( guess what europe ) nobody aint going to pay for overcrap engergy and jeopardize their interest particularly europe that swimming in a pile of debts as i aready wrote ] ( http://www.worldwatch.org/energy-costs-rising-national-debts-grow ) [ it does n't help that countries like latvia have joined southern europe and central europe and said two days ago that they wont take lng and will stick with russian gaz and appear to stick with the * status quo * ] ( http://www.energypost.eu/system-unconnected-vessels-gas-market-baltic-states/ ) * from their gas exports . 
  for now , the latter scenario seems more likely ; the iea expects russian gas exports to europe to remain stable through 2020 . 
  `` the need for drastic measures might not be there , but much depends on what strategy russia wants to engage in , '' says the iea 's jacazio * basically they agree it wont affect market share for russia or probably will impact only price ( wich i doubt ) wich precisely why russia has built turkish-stream . 
  there is one country moving and diversyiging today and ironically it is russia not europe , i mean by 2020 china will surpass germany as customers while europe will still be under long term contracts for russian gaz until 2028 further add that putin will finish a deal with india , south korea and north korea at the end of this year . 
  while europe long term plan will start only in 2030 ( it does n't help that their plans is falling right now ) . 
  sorry babe , russia is here to stay and commodity traders are betting on that, 
  i am a russian jew also , but live in canada and travel frequentely in russia since i have a business both in russia and germany . 
  i seriously had a doubt on your comment . 
  yeah i felt it also maybe diaspora guy ? 
  from his comment history he was born and live in israrel . 
  that is the thing nobody took it seriously . 
  * russian general prosecutor 's office claimed * : `` there is no perspective to check `` legality '' of estonia , latvia , and lituanias ind\u00e9pendance '' dude i am just reporting what he wrote . 
   i also saw article that more or less suggested he only made a statement because local media asked it from him now i might understand , i tought he chose to randomly comment now if it is a local media that asked him that question than it is perfectly understandable . 
  do you have any sources your link dont show it ? 
   maybe because he [ considered it an absurd provocation ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33325842 ) ? 
  yes i read it this is why ** i am asking why he didnt contact the russian executive and chose to comment instead on that ? 
  ** you should note also that this two mps are not part of the governement nor part of the executive . 
  he chose to comment , usually in diplomacy , you asked for an explanation first but he didnt he knew well what he was doing, 
  my understand if i read quite well your replies is that you were trying to blame putin ( the governement ) by implying they were behind it . 
  you should ask yourself why well know western media like the new york times , guardian or where i am in france didnt reported it ? 
  what i am asking myself also is why the lithuania 's foreign minister didnt call the russian executive or members of the governement ? 
  i wonder if foreign governement bother with what an mp said or outright meddle in every inquiry a prosecutor general receive ( god knows they usually receive alot of nonsenses per year ) yes the damage have been down thanks to propaganda . 
  its funny how you are trying to twist that story and that you have nothing to add . 
  no western media bother to ask the russian prosecutor office any questions . 
  you know in each parties they are radical right ? 
  and that putin party has factions ? 
  like in any countries , hell even the ccp in china has factions . 
  in that case two random mps asked the prosecutor a request wich by law he has an obligation to answer . 
  it is quite unlikely ( the part you are trying to twist ) it came from higher order considering how quick the governement distance himself the same day and that state media didnt even bother with that new much . 
  here we go babe  you have me confused with someone else , i never said that . 
  i only pointed out that russian friends are quite limited these days . 
  than why did you point the map of crimea recognition , does that mean the west has no friends because 80 % of countries did n't recognize the independance of kosovo . 
  what does `` friends '' mean anyway in a geopolitical context how is that `` few '' . 
  sanctions are usually the execution of political statement wich in that case not even the words `` few `` mean something '' . 
  this is hilarious  what the hell are you trying to communicate here ? 
  you 're canadian , speak english you might want to check your facts  i mean , okay . 
  we 'll see how long that lasts oh now you are trying to backdown while the entire discussion was start just on that clunky opinion from you :d  i suspect by 2020 with a new russian president we 'll see a more reconciliatory russia you are going to wait a long time , i suspect the complete opposite , wich show your complete ignorance of russian politics . 
  `` russia doesnt bow '' now it 's the finance guy/commodity trader  okay . 
  meanwhile the eu is building lng terminals for american shipping , is increasing natural gas purchases from norway , seeking a route for natural gas from the middle eas you love to dream no it wont happen or actually probably in a long long long time yeah ... the eu common energy policy that is all talks nothing concrete achieve and shaky at best while the average time for eu infrastructure projects is ten years while the plan have been pushed for ** `` 2030 '' ** now . 
  http://oilprice.com/energy/gas-prices/eu-struggling-to-diversify-away-from-russian-gas.html[3] and i dont know any commodity traders that truly thinks it will be a success [ not even the economist ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21639577-european-union-heads-battle-national-governments-energy-only-connect ) pretending they will take lng from norway and netherlands the only major alternative is lng , which historically sells for at least 50 % more. , even though the fact is that norway and netherlands production are set to declines by 2030 while they are forecast to equal about a fifth of eu demand  one thing that stand , , the fact that netherlands , which is currently a net gas exporter will decline significantly by 2030 is something that the iea has forecast a few years back , and is happening as we speak , here is the [ iea ] report ( http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/oil&amp;gassecu ... ) you might want to forget also the u.s while at least half of eastern europe and southern europe do not want lng . 
  as for middle east the only alternative is `` iran '' no plan is on the table right now for a gaz pipelines and anyway they wont be able . 
   and suing gazprom under some very serious anti-trust litigation . 
  [ 1 ] european companies and countries are contractually obligated to import at least 115 billion cubic meters ( bcm ) a year of russian gas , ( approximately 75 % of the 2013 import level ) , until the mid-2020s . 
  failure to adhere to these obligations would be result in said eu and countries companies becoming subject to international arbitration . 
  [ bro do you even read `` energy reports '' ? 
  ] ( http://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ng-92.pdf ) considering there wont be ready for 2025-2028 they will be force to renew the contracts . 
  with all this `` values '' based leadership today the eu is the world 's economic basket-case . 
  since 2007 , the eu economy has not seen any growth . 
  the eu unemployment rate is over 10 % .
