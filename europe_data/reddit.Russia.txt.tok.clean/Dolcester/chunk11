  the continent 's debt/gdp ratio is reaching unsustainable levels . 
  as a result , the eu electorate is starting to lose its trust in the current eu elites , which is evidenced by the sharp rise in support for anti-eu politicians . 
  you wont see , greece , austria , italy and hungary paying energy 50 % higher !!!!, 
  in your dream , they are the one rushing to make new deals with russia this year . 
  see hungary nuclear deal and `` turkish stream ''  i 'm also a math guy by trade . 
  certainly not an econ boy  the russian economy is expected to contract between 3 and 5 % in 2015 ... actually between 2 and 2.7 % according to the world bank , check and update your datas ; with growth picking up next year ( i do n't call that `` an economy down the shitter '' while the unemployement is at 5 % , inflation is falling , rubble performing [ and foreign reserves growing back at 200 millions per day ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-15/bank-of-russia-buys-181-million-to-start-rebuilding-reserves ) wich will go back to 500 billions , the double of the reserves we had before the crisis . 
  i wont even be surprise if the growth forecast will change to -1 % or 0.1 % at the end of the year . 
  by the way russia industrial production has grow by 250 % while share of oil has fallen from 43 % of the gdp in 2003 to 15 % in 2015 , and state revenue who depends 50 % on oil is now 23 % . 
  while export dependant on oil is fallen by 2 % each year and will go under 50 % in 2020 , putin is doing somewhat his job . 
   we are . 
  check out the projected us growth rate . 
  check out the american unemployment rate . 
  now compare that to the rest of the world . 
  part time jobs , wages who have not raise and who are stagnating since 35 years and even after the suppose `` recovery '' while somewhat comsumption is an all time high since 2007 while the federal reserve has not `` raise interest rate '' and using double speak with three massive plans of quantitative easing in the last three years . 
  but somewhat stocks are an all time high with a market cap over gdp ( currently at 123 % ) wich mean `` significately overvalued '' . 
  if it smell like that , quack like a duck , walk like a duck . 
  guess what ? 
  it 's a `` bubble '' !!!, 
  every finance guys know it ( i mean reading and opening any mainstream media ( finance ) would have tell you that ) . 
  this is hilarious reading you , you are inside a bubble at least that will last 1 year before the wake up assuming the fed do n't act like a chicken in september . 
  your economy is fluff  is there currently a better developed economy in the world ( with a population over 10 million ) ? 
  [ yes they are , reading at least the ocde economic reports would have show you that ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=eo ) why did you put the cap at 10 millions ? 
  this is strictly diffent than you saying * the best performing developed economy in the world *, 
  putting you down will be easy so i will begin soft ( altough you better check your facts , i am finance guy ) the map dont show half of the world ( countries ) wich show you are shockingly nut as as already wrote and dont show ** everyone ** ( wich was the point people were arguing ) now you are deflecting baby boy , stay focus ( pretty sure you didnt even read the sanctions ) 2 ) if we did care of the west we will not have size crimea ( altough your explanation is quite childish that even well know geopoliticians dont buy it in the west ( john mersmeier and kissinger for one ) naivety  everything was altough hilarious 1 ) threat of sanctions , eastern ukraine was soon size  get over it , the russian leadership dont give a crap of the feeling of the west 3 ) the deal with greece is quite important since its allow russia to bypass ** south stream ** and ukraine and i wrote that as commodity trader ( wich was in all papers ) altough i am not surprise of your ignorance . 
  4 ) i am a finance guy and economist you better add some numbers and explanation babe  so here were i will take it soft hahaha   meanwhile , your economy is in the toilet and the you better explain that  eu is intensely looking for alternatives to russian gas . 
  yeah right explain that also and the most hilarious * i am currently enjoying the best performing developed economy in the world * not even the fed buy that  anyway i am waiting for more meats around the bone as i told i will be soft after :(, 
   ll  [ lol with friends like these who needs enemies ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014#/media/file:recognition_of_crimean_referendum.svg ) god you must be nuts  [ maybe you should check the map of countries that put sanctions babe ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_sanctions_during_the_ukrainian_crisis )  since it drives your economy ? 
  hell , since always ? 
  and we would have not take crimea in that case babe  dream on its not in the russian character , remember its merkel and hollande who beg for the minsk agreement . 
    but we sure took some quite good investment deals . 
   like how the st petersburg economic forum was hailed as an incredible economic bonanza when somehow it managed to raise even less money than last year ? 
  you mean how some western companies are still doing business ? 
  and how russia will still be in the top 20 of foreign direct investment next year . 
  furthermore what does that have to do with the deals in greece ? 
  you should check the word `` everyone ''  desperately try to find new friends since when we care about the opinion of the west ? 
  and definitely not in the russian character ( wich i love ) the reality is simple nobody will put money in a hellhole like greece and no single country has the capacity to do it alone or has the ressources . 
  i dont know what you mean , i basically report the word of the deputy prime minister . 
  and what usualy i read in financial reports in the last 4 days , i work in finance so many people dont buy the fact that russia would have help since the first visit of tsirpas in april 19 but we sure took some quite good investment deals . 
   did n't russia say greece should stay in european union ? 
  i guess so they have a vote withing eu against sanctions , but still ... 
  yes we said that furthermore we already have what we want with `` turkish stream ''  [ a deputy finance minister told reuters there had been no request for money from greece , and ** russia had no resources for such a bailout ** ] ( http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idusl5n0z41bb20150618 ) * we have very strong political and economic relations with greece and in difficult times we always support our partners ... . 
  we are supportive of any solutions that greece and european partners and friends may propose . 
  certainly we have a priority to support investment projects and trade with greece , and if financial assistance is needed we will consider that . 
  but overall , it is our priority to have a stable europe , a stable greece and we 'll continue to supportive of a resolution of the greek financial crisis *, 
   you are n't understanding . 
  you ca n't compare this kind of thing . 
  you ca n't use city states that operate as rich trade hubs to full fledged nations . 
  well i dont think singaporeans would be happy if i told them they are not a full fledged nation considering they have a bigger army than denmark . 
  anyway `` the port and the hub of trade '' is only 7 % of the gdp of singapore . 
  for comparison in netherlands ( rotterdam the biggest port in europe and the third largest is 8 % of the gdp of netherlands ( higher than singapore ), 
  the comparison with singapore can be fair i frequentely see them in financial reports with denmark see my comment here http://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3biaj5/tax_revenue_collected_in_eu_countries_as_a/csmvmgb, 
   why in the fuck are you comparing a city full of insanely rich people with entire real countries ? 
  the guy is right this is why i put south korea vs france in my previous example . 
  this is why i put south korea just below , singapore still have 7 millions citizens ( similar to denmark ) something the other offshore do not have not even close or similar . 
  furthermore the share of services in singapore stand at 70 % with a strong manufacturial base higher than denmark , while for denmark they rely much more ( 76 % ) on services than singapore, 
  not reality its a question of priority , singapore and denmark who have roughly the same population ; singapore is nicer and better maintained than denmark ; and much more multicultural . 
  no one can claim that singapore is `` chaotic '' or `` disorganized '' , but the government of singapore consumes only 17.1 % gdp compared to denmark 's 57.6 % ; hong kong only spends 18.5 % another example would be south korea wich is at 30,2 % while france is at 56,1 %, 
  how does it relate to gender equality ? 
  some edgy teenagers in one week they can cheers an ukrainian user with a shell targetting people , clapping their hands on the tought of violating libya sovereignty or just wanting to see for the sake of it islamists in the caucasus while being angry when an islamist do something on their lands !, 
  like ironically today . 
  i have great respect for you people particularly circassians and dargins . 
  ** written by ** `` mr. brisiuck is charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires of ukraine in the united states, 
  russians and by extension the russian state dont live for the good eyes of `` europe '' each countries has each own interest and that is particularly fine . 
  here an article http://www.russia-direct.org/analysis/russia-losing-battle-isis-online, 
   and with kadyrov 's powers growing ( he 's openly challenges fsb now ) , his appetite is sure to grow , too . 
  oh come on !, 
  i do think this news was blow out of proportion and was a political stunt most of my analysis came from that ( quite good read ) http://carnegie.ru/eurasiaoutlook/?fa=59995 the idea is that and i quote * the acute phase of kadyrov 's conflict with the siloviki seems to have passed *, 
  read that http://carnegie.ru/eurasiaoutlook/?fa=59995  so why is there talk of him breaking this relationship with putin ? 
  this is simply impossible and unlikely if anything they are still rumors . 
  kadyrov made it clear to any state official who tried to pass himself off as a middleman that the latter was merely an errand boy for putin . 
  and that he want only to deal with putin . 
   if he broke this relationship , where would that leave him ? 
  he wont have enough money to pay for his militias for one and for maintaining order in cheychnya and if kadyrov were to split from moscow , no one would support him -- neither those who have always fought against the militants , nor the former militants who traded in their rebel fatigues for police uniforms . 
  and he definitely wo n't get any support from the militants still up in the forest ( who consider him as a traitor ) the fsb will likely be involve and pick a new man, 
   having in mind the particular situation with russia 's finances there was $ 30 billion in federal funds spent between 2000 and 2010 on the north caucasus ( wich include more than only chechnya also 5 other republics ) , a good part went to cheychna . 
  when we look at the finance it simply doesnt make sense , this not near to bankrupt russia or make them lower they are no cuts that are planned right now . 
  most people agree that has long putin is in power and kadyrov has control of cheychnya nothing will happen . 
  the only reasons people are worried is what will happen when putin will leave or when kadyrov died . 
   i thought him and putin were like best friends ? 
  kadyroy has few friends in moscow and putin is the one supporting him , his clan defected to putin during the second war ( a good bet from his father ) . 
  he has absolute control of the region to a point of total control and need moscow support as moscow need him . 
  the situation in cheychnya is that nobody want a new war , kadyrov is the one right now offering stability and peace trough russian subsidies . 
  and yes he likes personally putin there is no doubt about him, 
  [ no its french ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/isra%c3%abl ) , i didnt change my keyboard, 
  because i am involve in the community and various organizations in montreal . 
  https://www.rcchf.ca/ as for your friends i dont know , `` fan '' is also a strectch but usually russians understand including the one in the diaspora . 
  ok . . ok end of the duiscussion, 
   who cares ? 
  it is quite relevant  coverage in canada towards russia is overwhelmingly negative and has been since they invaded ukraine . 
  yes it is like that pretty much anywhere in the west , that still has not stop the diaspora to support him . 
   half-chinese has nothing to do with it . 
  not chinese but `` travelling in china '' that is writting on my flair read better next time and i tought it was clear you were ban of the sub . 
  you are annoying nillbop if not everywhere where i write a single comment in order to start something , there is seriously no discussion to make here . 
   having lived in canada for 5 years i 'm gon na have to call you out on that one , i dont care you are not russian nor canadian wich i am , furthermore i am not talking of the opinion of the ukrainian diaspora . 
   that 's because the diaspora 's image of russia is 99 % russian tv . 
  not in my case and not what i see both in canada and isra\u00ebl . 
  ( russian tv is barely accessible ) when i talk of the diaspora i talk also of immigrants and their children people that also have access to western news . 
  blaming only the media simply doesnt make sense at all they are simply other factors . 
   propaganda has won over the common sense .
