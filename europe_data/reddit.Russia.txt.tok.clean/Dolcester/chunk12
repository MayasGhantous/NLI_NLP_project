  oh come on even among the diaspora his popularity is an all time high . 
  i saw what you did there ... 
  i am from russia , i have already the canadian citizenship , right now i am in canada but travel two , three times per month back to russia . 
  the last time i was in ukraine was last year . 
  oh come on !, 
  yes it is bad i admit it ( altough the russian translation is less harsh )  and i meant it might not seem like a big deal to a russian jew , not to you . 
  things are just a mess right now nobody like kolomoisky ( yes an ukrainian jew ) specially us he is basically the one financing halfly far right groups in ukraine . 
  relations are tense between us and them , some leaders in ukraine simply act like they dont have any brains . 
  its politics and no i am not a special case http://www.jpost.com/diaspora/hang-ukrainian-jewish-leaders-says-former-russian-jewish-congress-president-393774, 
  you never wrote something intelligent , the 1932 \u00e9lections is what allowed hitler to have his first coalition governement after the 1932 elections hitler got the largest share of the vote and approached papen ( the current governement in power ) for coalition talks . 
  papen agree and obtained hindenburg 's consent to form the hitler cabinet on 30 january 1933 . 
  this is free and fair from a to z, 
  at the end and i say that as a russian jew , the guy is using rethoric they are no report of opression from what i read on jewish forum and jewish reports in eastern ukraine and the own rabbis say that those people were correct . 
  he use using rethoric sure that is bad but they are no reports and i met plenty of jewish ukrainians in synagogue that say they are not opresss or come close to it . 
  * asked about rebel leaders ' relationship with the jews under their control in february , vishedski 's assistant rabbi aryeh shvartz told the jerusalem post that `` they have acted well toward us . '' *, 
   using paramilitary forces to expel communists from the parliament , manufacturing a majority , is not democratic . 
  there is a reason most european nations have laws against uniformed extremist groups these days . 
  yes it is . 
  using article 48 of the weimar republic wich was perfectly legal, 
   you do n't know what you are talking about ( and no historian would actually side with you on this ) . 
  wich ignorance ? 
  the fact you are not able to grasp a modicus of thing wich is a complete horseshit you just wrote hitler asked for article 48 ( not the first one doing it ) and he got his coalition furthermore he already won election before ( 1932 ) and his party came first . 
  you are sputting nonsenses and waisting my times i am seriously curious to see those sources wich you wont be able to provide at all . 
  his rise was perfectly legal using the democratic institutions from a to z. 
  are you realy trying to argue cold histrical facts that even historians dont bother to argue . 
  the day after the fire hitler ** asked for ** and received from president hindenburg the * reichstag fire decree * , signed into law by hindenburg ** using article 48 of the weimar constitution ** . 
  ( note that hitler was not the frist one using it ) wich was perfectly legal according to the institution of the weimar republic . 
  [ `` revisionism '' can also have a various denifinitions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/historical_revisionism ) dude , you are a romanian guy arguing on something that even the germans accept , that the allies recognize themselves and that modern historians accepted as cold historical fact . 
  it doesnt help that you are carefully trying to castigate russia ( assuming that russia was the only one doing that ) while the expulsion of germans was first push by the polish and the czech but nah it has to be `` kaliningrad '' but not the other territories . 
  russians dont take lightly this kind of crap . 
   and you think people should pay for the actions of their leaders ? 
  i 'd like to see you queue up to repay putin 's crimes against ukraine and georgia . 
  what crimes , genocide , atrocities putin did to the `` ukrainians '' and the `` georgians '' i have not heard of any massacres or crime agaisnt humanites toward both of those peoples . 
  all was done democratically there is nothing to argue here , not even historians bother to argue on that . 
  there was 43,9 % for the nsdap in the 1933 election was the best result any party had ever had in the republic of weimar from 1919 to 1933 ( second best was 37,8 % for the social democrats immediately after wwi ) in march 1933 the german parliament passed what is known as \u201e erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz `` ( gesetz zur behebung der not von volk und reich ) , a law that allowed the nazi/deutschnationale coalition to govern without the consent of the parliament . 
  it was passed with a vast majority of deputies that would have allowed to change the constitution in any case . 
  so , since hitler and the nsdap had more votes than any other party during the republic of weimar and governed on the basis of a law that had been passed by the absolute majority of the parliament is seems reasonable to conclude that he was indeed democratically elected . 
  those are hard true cold historical facts . 
   the atrocities of the nazi regime do not justify destroying the lives of ordinary people in konigsberg , and invading their land those are simply the `` potsdam agreement '' otherwise you better asked poland to give back also eastern prussia . 
   these people had nothing to do with the decisions their leaders made at the end the nazi were elect to power , took the power democratically . 
  `` the germans people bear all the guilt of wwii '' what the allies call `` collectiv guilt '' * the expulsion of germans after world war ii by soviets , poles and czechoslovaks has been sometimes justified as collective punishment . 
  the goal was to punish the germans ; [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] the allies declared them collectively guilty of german war crimes . 
  [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] in the us and uk the ideas of german collective guilt and collective punishment originated not with the us and british people , but on higher policy levels . 
  [ 24 ] not until late in the war did the us public assign collective responsibility to the german people . 
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collective_punishment#expulsion_of_germans_after_the_war keep your revisionism for yourself and i say that as a jew also . 
  its just a fair price !, 
   will you give us your last tank ? 
  please . 
  :3 ukraine problems was never lack of tanks or weapons since the beginning of the conflict . 
  if anything look the iraqi army you stop using your su fighters and attact helicopters as soon they were being shot down easily . 
  good, 
  lol, 
   a russian court can be coerced or bribed into allowing putin to seize random assets in retaliation is preposterous . 
  not only would he not be brave enough to do this http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/25/us-russia-sanctions-law-iduskcn0hk1eo20140925, 
   nice to see russian taxpayers ready to foot the bill for their poor oligarchs . 
  how is kolomoisky doing ? 
   it would make it unlawful . 
  if the russian state wants to behave like a criminal regime illegally stealing assets because it does n't wants to adhere to treaties they signed themselves , that 's their call . 
  yeah yeah right ... right ... http://mobile.reuters.com/article/iduskcn0hk1eo20140925  but actions always have consequences , there wont have nothing at all i was working as a financial trader in london when putin was cracking down foreign companies after yeltsin years left and right . 
  traders and commodity traders where not even worried soon after russia was still in the top 20 of foreign investment . 
  i predict nothing at all, 
   foreign property is protected by several international treaties , among which the partnership and cooperation agreement the russians federation has with the eu . 
  and you think that can a stop governement lol ? 
  by the way i will need links please of you dont mind . 
  exactly, 
   the turkish stream was just a bluff , in recent statement , even the prime minister himself said that they wo n't participate in anything before eu agrees with russia . 
  do you have any sources , the constrcuction are already begin next month at least on the turkish side . 
  tough ?? 
  yes its propaganda , putin at least since 2013 has already launched a massive plan of modernization of the army and the naval air forces and to get ride of the 1980s and 1990s old equpipments . 
  we need to close that gap at least fast . 
   this username is revealing things about this user 's views that match his actual comments . 
  what is wrong with his comment history ? 
   ugh looking at your [ reddit posting profile it 's obvious i 'm talking to someone from within the military industrial complex ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hdjx6to.png ) so i do n't expect your view on this to be anything other than highly subjective and biased ( if not bought ) how did you do that wich website ? 
  look lady , you cant understand a modicus of things oh by the way nice dodge on churchill and the uk keep ignoring it ( ** that was a real case of holocaust ** )  it is you who is spinning the crap out of your `` stalin crimes '' . 
  what ? 
  are you saying that stalin didnt do crimes ? 
  here the thing what happen fall under stalinist crimes , orders signed by him , ** now read below this paragraph in bold carefully * '' ** unlike germans , nobody in the whole , soviets union vote for the soviets regime and were also victims . 
  ** german voted for their crazy governement . 
  ** no wonder since the end of the cold war poland , the baltic states or eastern europe never brougt russia b to courts for apology or compensation . 
  ** why ? 
   instead of actually showing me where that has happened you 're spinning russian 's saying stalin was a bad guy and did bad things as a wholesale coverage for everything - which is simply insane . 
  russia have recognize stalinist crimes this is the last time i repeat , do you understand ? 
   it 's like instead of recognizing , apologizing and reconsiling the holocaust and other atrocities germany had just said `` okay , hitler was bad guy , and there 's that . '', 
  nothing like germany , putin has already recognized that the system was force on the baltic states and nothing like the holocaust and i know what i am talking about i am jewish . 
  if even the west can not even recognize their own , at the exact same period . 
   and then you guys whine because many dislike russia . 
  russia could do with some common decency . 
  i never whine , most people dont care of their opinion . 
  they never had a valid case to bring it to court or ask compensation . 
  basically its all rethoric to s ** ck the hell out of the votes ( ironically they all host cia black site )  over & out . 
  you never brought a single intelligent point  except for this one more stupidity of yours :( :( well you are asking for nonsenses that even western countries dont do and acting like germany was ussr or that the ussr was the only one kicking out and making slave labour in europe at that time . 
  [ the czech did some nasty things ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/forced_labor_of_germans_after_world_war_ii ), 
  here we go , there is no point in arguing with that  merely saying that stalin was bad guy is certainly not the same as actually recognizing * youuuuuuuuuuu are trying to spin ... * * right round * , * right round * the links are pretty clear russia leadership have ** recognized ** stalin crimes . 
   and if all those atrocities have been officially recognised as you claim then please do list them regarding poland . 
  list them right here : they all enter into stalinist crimes nobody is snowflakes specially not the poles . 
  * `` even now you can hear people say that what happened to the many victims was justified by certain higher government aims , '' said a sombre-faced mr medvedev . 
  '' * * `` but nothing can be placed higher than the value of human life . 
  there can be no justification for the repressions . 
  '' * * `` it was vital to remember and mourn the millions of victim '' * - medvedev or saying `` we force our way on other nations '' is not a recognition now ?? 
  those is clearly a recognition , as i told you quit spinning they got pretty far while in uk nobody apologize/recognize the 6 millions people that died under a famine that winston churchill enigneered and the british administration engineered themselves ( roughly the same numbers as stalin and deliberately ) http://yourstory.com/2014/08/bengal-famine-genocide/ http://www.ibtimes.com/bengal-famine-1943-man-made-holocaust-1100525**** * later at a war cabinet meeting , churchill blamed the indians themselves for the famine , saying that they `` breed like rabbits *  irrelevant to what putin said in your link nice cherry picking , that part is * today , cia black sites are not true now ?
