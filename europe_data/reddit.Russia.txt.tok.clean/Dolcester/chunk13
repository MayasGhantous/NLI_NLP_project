  * ( some nasty u.s things ), 
  bla bla bla you are getting hysterical all those atrocities are all under ** stalin crimes ** ( a georgian on his orders ) ** they have recognize his crimes ** you are arguing nonsenses at this point . 
   then he claims that the americans are acting in a similar way the occupation of indians lands also or the repression of filipino nationalist movements are not true now ? 
  what ? 
  today cia black sites are not true now ? 
   poland against polish civilans . 
  you ca n't because they have n't recognize . 
  that enter in `` stalinist crimes '' http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/03/world/gorbachev-assails-crimes-of-stalin-lauds-khrushchev.html http://articles.latimes.com/1987-11-03/news/mn-18452_1_soviet-leader http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/6468199/russias-president-dmitry-medvedev-condemns-stalin.html http://m.ndtv.com/world-news/vladimir-putin-admits-russia-forcibly-imposed-soviet-model-on-eastern-europe-755623, 
  your datas doesnt invalidate my point at all . 
   apparently you mentioned people blowing themselves up in london as an indication that the uk has been wronging people by military operations wich is true no doubt on that . 
  you have a serious problem if you cant acknowledge that ( there is a reason why uk is between algeria and mali )  to the point that they 're willing to do that . 
  no doubt about that  however , if that is a reliable indicator , then russia scores * much * worse . 
  russia has chenchya ( our own internal province similar to eta in spain ) uk is directly link with the ** foreign ** crap they are doing in the middle east . 
  i dont understand your point make it clear and develop . 
  because i dont think you understand your own datas and my point . 
   while , so we 've got that going for us . 
  that part i was refering to the middle east there is a reasons why your governement has grown insecure and if he had a chance the young muslim extremist will blow himself in london . 
  and that is because of your governement meddling . 
   including various speeches at the duma and political meetings . 
  that is not true at all and blatantly a lie , soviets leadership , medvedev , gorbatchev and putin have ** recognized soviets crimes ** not one example as you trying to spin it . 
  do you know anything on russia . 
  did you bother to make a simple internet search ? 
   i mean the uk has n't annexed a neighbour in a while , so we 've got that going for us . 
  i guess this why some people want to blow themselves in the middle of london since 2003 . 
  what the fuck is the swedish left party and the left international forum ? 
  furthermore why is this artcle is only report by one newspaper furthermore why people are not waiting for the osce ( the true monitor ) did you ever read articles with solid sources in your entire life ? 
   was n't you told not to call the god 's name in vain ? 
  you are a good polish catholic but i am jewish and i am gon na keep my habits and say `` god '' when i want . 
   you know very well that the invasion of france and low countries was in spring of 1940 , after your ( another ) contract with germany was signed and before lend lease begun . 
  oskar i will repeat one last time , made a mistake , you know a lapsus ? 
  lend lease was only signed by the americans in ** march 1941 ** 1 year after france . 
  you should read the art of being right by shopenhaeur here the link ** and read the number 37 ** i know all the trick oskar http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_art_of_being_right ** again read number 37 in the link ** as i told you i know all the trick  you ca n't even quote precisely and still you tries to cheat me . 
  do n't be childish . 
  childish now ? 
   you have no reason to call me a liar , i have quite plenty reasons to call you like that , but it does n't matter at all . 
  i do n't care about your or my personal things , the problem here is that your gov is degenerating etchics of its subjects just to keep up the mythology of soviet union , at the expense of provocations and insults against your former subjects and neighbours . 
  yes i have plenty of reasosn to call you a liar . 
  you call me a fool wich i am not . 
  i mean didnt i showed you western sources ? 
  i mean you have nothing not any ammo and you cant recognize you are wrong . 
  as i told you i had this discussion thousand times . 
  putin isnt degenerating anything ( whatever that mean anyway ) now this conversation is turning into a rant against russia oskar , oskar !!!!, 
  now i am in hong kong and i have a meeting , i will answer tomorrow . 
  oskar , 1 ) calling someone a liar is not an insult if that is true ( i was not fooling around as you wrote )  such things you ignored , just to change the subject oskar , i never did that ** one time **  but the worst thing is that you just tried to manipulate me and then called it a `` mistake '' . 
  enough of that . 
  but jesus , it was the true !!, 
  oskar much of the things were answered and i never insult you one time . 
  its just that i am not an uneducated russian . 
  no you are liar and a bad person sir and taking me for an idiot and i showed you that you were wrong . 
  i only use western sources to make my point . 
  it was only since two years that some western media tried to blame only ussr . 
  never saw such things even during the cold war when i was traveling in the west . 
  god thanks some western historians are in our side . 
  if you use the latin script its `` do svidaniya '' not `` svidania '', 
  bla bla bla  bullcrap , the german-soviet commercial agreement was signed in february 1940 and it was broken when germans invided . 
  mistake i meant u.s brought only lend lease when france was invade its funny you are still taking me for a layman  but about what you 've done in `` western belarus '' and especially `` western ukraine '' , but the same goes for `` eternally russian '' crimea , chechnya and such . 
  wich we already apologize now read carefuly this is the last time i repeat it . 
   name a one which excuses german and soviet invasion by blaming poland for its actions against czechoslovakia and lithuania . 
  first time i 've heard such idiotic opinions it was in german war propaganda . 
  why did you wrote that what has to do do with what i wrote in my previous reply ? 
  the fact is simple poland cut czecoslovakia with the germans while invading lithuania . 
  this fact show that ussr actions were not isolate simply . 
  altough i dont see the link with this part you wrote with my previous reply . 
   the big bad `` west '' just forced you to invide and occupy others , not to mention the etchnic policies and slave labour ... no , neither czechs , nor the french were doing that , yes they were if you read carefully i made a link with the potsdam agreement after the war ** article 12 : **  orderly transfer of german populations main article expulsion of germans after world war ii the three governments , having considered the question in all its aspects , recognize that the transfer to germany of german populations , or elements thereof , remaining in poland , czechoslovakia and hungary , will have to be undertaken . 
  yes the french , the czech , the dutch http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forced_labor_of_germans_after_world_war_ii http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_evacuation_and_expulsi not to think what they were doing in their colonies . 
  and so on  ** that sneak invasion was a ** `` war crime '' ** , ** if anything was . 
  ** you are confusing yourself read carefully . 
  it classified the katyn massacre as a ` war crime ' ( killing prisoners of war was a violation of the international law then applicable ) , to which no statutes of limitation can apply you have no legal basis to call it otherwise a `` war crime '' . 
  there were ** two ** appeals , ** you lost both **  the difference between us is that we 're not under it anymore . 
  it must be a joke right ??? ... 
   but unfortunatelly for soviet apologists there are documents , historians and witnesses , all of which was of course censored and banned under the soviet occupation . 
  the difference between us is that we 're not under it anymore . 
  i am amazing this part was hilarious did you read the link i provide ???? 
  1 ) [ stalin ` planned to send a million troops to stop hitler if britain and france agreed pact ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/3223834/stalin-planned-to-send-a-million-troops-to-stop-hitler-if-britain-and-france-agreed-pact.html ) 2 ) [ joseph stalin was also upset by the results of the munich conference . 
  the soviets , who had a mutual military assistance treaty with czechoslovakia , felt betrayed by france , who also had a mutual military assistance treaty with czechoslovakia . 
  the british and french , however , mostly used the soviets as a threat to dangle over the germans . 
  stalin concluded that the west had actively colluded with hitler to hand over a central european country to the nazis , causing concern that they might do the same to the soviet union in the future , allowing the partition of the ussr between the western powers and the fascist axis . 
  this belief led the soviet union to reorient its foreign policy towards a rapprochement with germany , which eventually led to the signing of the molotov-ribbentrop pact in 1939 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/munich_agreement#citerefklaus_hildebrand1991 ) 3 ) [ stalin dint interpret the pact as permitting the ussr to grab territory ] ( https://books.google.ca/books?id=esedgcqk9ukc&amp;pg=pa256&amp;dq=stalin+did+not+instantly+interpret+the+protocol+on+the+sphere+of+influence+as+permitting+the+ussr+secret+as+permitting+the+ussr+to+grab+territory&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=t_xtvdk9dyscyqt1uydgda&amp;ved=0cb8q6aewaa#v=onepage&amp;q=stalin%20did%20not%20instantly%20interpret%20the%20protocol%20on%20the%20sphere%20of%20influence%20as%20permitting%20the%20ussr%20secret%20as%20permitting%20the%20ussr%20to%20grab%20territory&amp;f=false ), 
   yes , and right-wingers , who support the `` legitimate '' independence of crimea are totally neutral . 
  unfortunately despite the separatist invitation the osce and the un didnt want to come in crimea . 
  in that case , the osce is in turkey right now and youth leftist swedish are walking around while they have 0 mandates and not recognize . 
  truly a bad article, 
   ah , so there was just a one `` stalinist crime '' ? 
  i guess the historians you 're talking about are those that supports your opinion , what ? 
  those are ** western ** historians and i forgot the '' s '' in stalinist crime ** s ** its pretty much accepted in academia today . 
   the us did not train the german army when it was still pretending to respect versaillese treaty , but most of all they did not assist their army in invasions . 
  comparing those relations and value of these contracts what ?? 
  lend lease was only enacted ** in march 1941 ** only after france was beaten soviet cut aid with germany around the same time when we were sure that japan would not attact us in the back . 
   whatever treaties the baltic states signed with germans it did n't matter , the only reason for their existence was riga peace treaty what they did matter they were signed before the molotov-pact everyone had an alliance except ussr and the reject 14 times stalin offer for an alliance . 
  ussr was the last country to signed a deal with hitler . 
   so tell me , did the soviets declare war on poland ? 
  was there a war between these two states ? 
  it was done ** in march 1940 ** relation between ussr and poland would be re-established with a formal treaty that would end the invasion in september 1941 http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sikorsi%e2%80%93mayski_agreement i didnt hear or see the cases but something tell me that . 
  i should trust the european supreme court on human right better than a pole . 
  the case is close you brought it to appeal you simply lost . 
   and as for revisionism , that was the real reason behing wwii , since both germany and russia wanted a revision of the post wwi order . 
  this had to result in destruction of newly proclaimed or reestablished countries , but you both pushed that even further with etchnic cleanisng , deportations , slave labour and general terror . 
  nope , most historians today agree that some pop media are engaging in revisionism by blaming entirely ussr while the event that brought wwii start with the versailles treaty . 
  i trust historians better than some idiots media . 
  by the way , kicking out minorities was agree in the potsdam agreement article 14 .
