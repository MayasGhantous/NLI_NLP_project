  the czech , the french also use slave labors everyone was cleansing, 
  exactly what i was saying to him , i better wait a more credible source and the results tomorrow than trusting observer from the `` left party union of sweden '', 
   did you read the article ?!, 
  what fucking credibility does it have ? 
   ann-margarethe livh , ** who is working with the left international forum , a the division of the swedish left party responsible for international solidarity work ** totally neutral right ??? 
   it indicates quite a lot . 
  it indicate crap ** no shit at all ** there is not even a dammit report this entire article is base on `` someone said '', 
   one day , perhaps i 'll understand the russian logic . 
  perhaps . 
   what the fuck is a `` stalinist crime '' ? 
  did you learn history ? 
   you 're just making the same old excuses . 
  i am taking literrally the word of historians  the fact is russia collaborated with germany in that invasion and provided them with materials to continue that war , nothing can excuse that . 
  like most nations that were neutral including the u.s who provide cars , agricultural products ect nobody gave a shit on poland each nations had their own interest . 
  even the baltic states !!, 
  the treaties they signed with hitler were against you  ... the european court of human rights is not russia , your repressentatives there in their usual , arrogant and inslutive manner were the things is simple ** even neutral supreme court * '' call it a '' war crime get over it  i 've had this discussion many times as well and there 's nothing new you can tell me about that . 
  all i can say is that your gov builds your national `` pride '' on lies , manipulations and accusations against the victims of your criminal policies . 
  yeah right i trust historians not polish revisionism, 
  this entire article is bad the observer are not even affiliate with any credible organization . 
  this is hilarious  i think you also forgot to read this part . 
  here we go ** where a female official ** l was told by a man standing next to her on how to fill out her ballot , '' *, 
  altough i didnt like your comparison with putin all.this crap article is base on that  the military must not be within 100 meters of a polling station , so we said [ to the soldiers ] that what you are doing is illegal , '' ** ellen gustafsson , a monitor with the swedish left party 's ** youth wing , told the radio station . '', 
  there no basis to call that ** election fraud ** or i dont see anything . 
  there is a reasons why other media are not reporting this crap, 
   russia should pay compensation to the countries it occupied . 
  there is no clear legal basis for that furthermore the only country that has push for compensation is lithuania in 2000 ( we never heard them and they never brought it to court ), 
   and still after 5 long years we ca n't recive wreck of presidential plane . 
  there is no basis for that and its base on conspiracies theories russia has been quite open with the polish side read the dammit wiki ( it got some good sources ) http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_polish_air_force_tu-154_crash, 
  i had this discussion thousand and thousand times  nobody says a thing about deportation and enslavement of millions in sibiria , an etchnic cleansing ordered by nkvd in 1937 , not to mention the brutal occupation which followed the `` liberation '' this is false russia as constantly denounce ** stalinist crime ** what the fuck are you saying ??? 
   we have also declarations of putin which excuse the invasion on poland , baltic states , romania and finnland . 
  no no and no furthermore its obvious you didnt reach the speech yes soviet union had a good case it was even recognize by winston churchill himself http://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/35v007/z/cr8gltx http://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/35v007/z/cr84tz0 http://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/35v007/z/cr87q6y  as for katy\u0144 massacre , russia refuse to accept it as a crime against humanity , but rather calls it a `` war crime '' , no matter that there was n't a war then . 
  this is crap  ** the european court of human rights ** ruled on monday that russia had violated the rights of relatives of poles who were killed by the soviet secret police in 1940 , ** and described the katyn massacre as a `` war crime ** http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idusbre83f0ub20120416, 
   and ? 
  you do know the katyn massacre was just the tip of the iceberg , right ? 
  what do you want next ? 
  i have gorbatchev declaration . 
  yeltsin declaration and putin d\u00e9claration including various speeches at the duma and political meetings . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/7564156/vladimir-putin-and-donald-tusk-attend-katyn-massacre-memorial.html http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/26/russian-parliament-guilt-katyn-massacre, 
  well you cant speak for the entire europe . 
  england was hardly a democracy after its revolution in fact the polish commonwealth had more electors and people able to vote ( yes i have sources ) democracy would only come with legislative means in uk and a shift in economic powers among the social classes , same thing for scandinavia . 
  the only exception est la france . 
  and its outsiders that will tell them what to do ? 
  didnt you see what happen to algeria in the 90s ? 
  do you people in the west ever learn something ? 
  you were the one saying in / r/russia yesterday that snowden is an fsb agents and a traitor that should be shot ... 
  sorry , if i dont think you are able to point reality . . , 
  never wrote something intelligent that is amazing, 
  you never wrote something intelligent each time we had a debate did you read my comment ? 
  your power is ** boycotting ** thats it and that end here nothing else  conacaf has only two western countries wich are u.s and canada ( completely worthless ) good luck getting the approval of the caribeean and the central american states . 
  you might want to confuse with conmebol considering that 100 % of those nations have not put sanctions on russia and that they all have a huge good relation with russia its a safe bet that they wont follow you again  sorry like they did previously it going to take glaciers in hell to make argentina and brazil or any latin americian states to follow such idiocies, 
  yeah yeah we wil see in moscow for the fifa, 
  you know i never downvote but you keep doing the same thing ... anyway nope the us has done a complete shift and is leaving ukraine this is why kerry was in sotchi three weeks ago and need russia help with iran deal and syria that suit both russia and the us . 
  you have been missing the news quite alot am i right ? ... 
   the us and europe can only try to persuade that party to deescalate with sanctions , but that is n't really working . 
  well its what is happening right now get over it, 
   actually some politicians have already advocated for boycotting it . 
  especially after sepp blatter and putin threw a party a day after russia shot down mh17 . 
  i am seriously talking ... politicians in us and in europe are desecalating right now ... you do understand that no high ranking politicians or foreign policies experts are advocating that ???? 
  and i have been reading news quite often and from what my german employees told me . 
  stop being a hawk the world is not build on the prism you have . 
   we 'll see about that . 
  sure wan na bet ? 
   eu makes up about the entire world top in footbal , throw a few south american teams in the play and you ; ve got all that matters . 
  this is why i wrote `` you may boycot `` t ( wich will never happen anyway , eu politicians are not teenageer and are desecalating right now particularly the u.s ) and you cant stripped a cup from any country sorry !, 
  impossible and niet !, 
  you are looking for a fuss wich i am not, 
   maybe we ca n't strip it from russia , maybe we can nope you cant and there is no `` we '' in that quit smoking its fifa not the eu . 
   good luck with it . 
  thanks, 
   yeah , those things ... whatever they are , pffft . 
  you misunderstand me, 
  well western countries may boycott all they want but the west has no power to stripped a world cup no matter the wishes and considering fifa internationnal standing they are not idiot enough to do that on this pure basis and mix politics . 
  the only one is qatar and that will probably be a boycott or taking the cup away from them for whatever `` human rights things '', 
  this entire article is base on `` ukraine said '' i am going to check and wait for the updates of the osce and not propaganda please http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/daily-updates, 
  * `` attempt '' * implying that the clunky ukrainian army is able to stop an offensive how many ?? 
  isnt the x times they were suppose to wait for an offensive ? 
  the west call that `` democracy '', 
   the current prediction by russian authorities claims so . 
  what not only ? 
  imf , world bank , oecd ?? 
  are you serious ? 
  http://knoema.fr/anrvvef/russia-inflation-forecast-2013-2015-and-up-to-2060-data-and-charts  that exactly is wrong with the idea of observing for some more months and looking at the multiple data points then to actually establish a trend ? 
  i did that exactly see further below anyway give me one reason why i should not keep throwing insult at you at this point ? 
  ** here that again and i will repeat my self `` a trend '' can be also by looking with a previous month . 
  ** ** are you disagreeing with that ? 
  ** you are hawkish on a definition ( wich you never show and that you got out of your arse ) for nothing because you wanted to nitpick me . 
  did you ever read a central bank reports ? 
   either something has seriously gone wrong in your education or you 're not one - or at least not a successful one at that profession . 
  what an idiot statement i have argue you down quite well , time time i have show you are wrong in fact attacking my credentials are the only point you seems to brought . 
   and even that is flimsy as you only have two data points not really yesterday the datas of the month of may have show it has decrease for a third straight month now we have three datas points . 
  we can also check the datas month over month . 
  now here the monthly inflation over month since january https://www.statbureau.org/en/russia/inflation-charts-monthly-month-to-month, 
   go on with your merry ways as `` a financial/commodity trader ''  it seems it is you who just can not get over the fact that you do n't know what you 're talking about yeah yeah . . well at this point that is funny , lets be honest you never wrote a single intelligent point . 
   you do n't know what you 're talking about and doubling down on stupid . 
  just keep embarassing yourself , you have constantly arguing and nitpicking on nonsenses . 
  did you bother to read the graph at least and the page ? 
  * the monthly inflation rate slowed to 0.5 percent , the lowest since september of 2014 * * russian consumer prices rose 16.9 percent year-on-year in march of 2015 , following a 16.7 percent increase in february . 
  yet , monthly inflation slowed for the second straight month to its lowest since october last year *, 
  yes ... as i told you get over it, 
   wow .
