  just wow . 
  especially from a guy who is completely unable to grasp the elementary concept of trend . 
  well that is funny the graph is in front of you the average increase of inflation ** has constantly falling wich show a trend ** wich a constant gap reducing even acording to the central bank and some analysts , russia was on downward trend since janauary . 
  get over it  come back when you have a graph with several months of decline and then say the graph has a declining trend . 
  but it has no no and no a trend can be long term and short term short term mean it can be in relation to ( t-1 ) one month , three months before ( t-3 ) or the same quarter of the previous year ( t-4 ), 
  there is not much point to make a discussion , you have been constantly nitpicking and attacking my credentials now you are arguing on nonsenses when i clearly put in my reply to the guy a pew prediction link just below my explanation . 
  you never gave a single explanation on a trend  ah , now it 's `` a likely trend '' . 
  we 're slowly making progress , i see . 
  very , very slowly . 
  you are mentally challenged . 
  i am amaze at this point, 
  so yeah , you seriously think that i am a layman this is hllilarious . 
  when i look an ** inflation graph ** like what he put and i see the inflation constantly rising since 8 month by an average of 1,5 % . 
  and that suddenly it fall after this constant rise ** on the next quarter ** . 
  it show me that 1 ) whatever the currency it has suddenly stabilize which mean it show a likely trend 2 ) the central bank has step in in order to decelarate thus i can easily wrote that it is on a downward trend by just looking the graph . 
   it is a decline . 
  of one month . 
  you can not establish a * trend * based on that . 
  yeah ... its unbelievable you keep arguing on that http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-06/russian-inflation-ends-eight-month-acceleration-on-ruble-rebound, 
   i informed you that one month is not a trend . 
  again what are you blabing ??? 
  inform me on what exactly , who are you ? 
  do you know the definitin of a trend in economic term since when it have a fix number ? 
  i see a decline and its a trend when i am looking his graph first thing i see is after an ** 8 month climb ** it fell . 
  ** thus it is on a downward trend according to his own graph ** what you just wrote was sheer nonsenses and hilarious . 
   did n't you just claim you 're `` a financial/commodity trader '' ? 
  ysk the effect of the falling oil prices always has some inertia . 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  both the imf and the world bank expected the economy to get much worse or to stagnate wich didnt happen in those quarters . 
  the fallen of the o\u00efl price begin as early as the sumner 2014 it was coupled by a new round of sanctions by december o\u00efl reach a new low . 
  russia still manage to grew and by next 0,4 % both were unpredictable and nobody did expect growth in those quarters . 
  furthermore again it growth unexpectedly in fourth quarter . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-01/russia-s-economy-unexpectedly-expanded-0-4-in-fourth-quarter   the economy has a strong industrial base that as soon the economy crash start to take over the growth . 
   dude , russia 's manufacturing pmi is below 50 . 
  and it just fell even more to 47.6 . 
  you didnt read clearly what i wrote however i will answer . 
  russia saw a temporary spike in prices from the decline in purchasing power of ruble , but as imports have been replaced with ** domestic manufactures ( hence my comment ) * '' the numbers on inflation have been positive . 
  you can see clearly in your graph that during april russian private sector output rose across both the manufacturing and service sectors for the first time since september 2014 . 
  after accounting for seasonal factors . 
  wich mean it signalled stabilisation now as for the current pmi . 
  [ * `` however , the contraction remains primarily centered on the investment goods sector , while the ongoing trend towards price level stabilization suggests the macroeconomic environment is showing some sign of improvement . 
  this could , in time , help the manufacturing economy regain some lost ground over the coming months , '' smith added . 
  * ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/hsbc-russia-pmi-may-2015-6 ), 
   dude , one month does not a trend make . 
  bla bla bla what are you blabing ??? 
  inflarion is set to decline simply and is directly link to the rubble value thus on ** downward ** trend . 
  this are literally the word people use . 
   you sir , are a liar !, 
  dude i am a financial/commodity trader  current inflation rate is absolutely horrible and is sloooooooowly getting less horrible : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/inflation-cpi i clearly wrote it is falling and will reach pre crisis level there is a trend according to your own charts where it is falling and where it will reach an all time low according to prediction . 
  http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/economy/global-economy-watch/projections.jhtml  current ruble to dollar value is not horrible , just really bad : http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=usd&amp;to=rub&amp;view=5y jesus !, 
  this is not like that you made a currency analysis !!!!, 
  as i already wrote the ruble was so strong that the central had to cut interest rate by 12 % in order to ** weaken ** the currency http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-01/ruble-extends-declines-as-central-bank-suspends-one-year-fx-repo  current interest rate of 12.5 % is awful : http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/521769.html what are you talking those are the interest of the central bank ... did you read the conclusion of your own link  current loss of -4.3 % gdp is terrible : http://www.forbes.com/sites/paulroderickgregory/2015/05/29/the-russian-decline-is-accelerating-gdp-down-4-3-in-1q15/ no , no and no http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/11643830/russian-bear-will-roar-once-more-says-world-bank.html  these are n't normal values . 
  they 're values for a nation that is in a crisis . 
  of couse the country is in a mild crisis but beat the prediction and his definitely less worse that people expected in fact people were surprise http://m.ft.com/cms/s/0/a96a491c-ffcd-11e4-bc30-00144feabdc0.html in fact it was not a crisis but a recession while finland will still be in recession next year . 
   however you 're still projected to [ contract ] ( http://www.thestreet.com/story/13170287/1/russias-economic-outlook-looks-a-bit-less-bad-says-world-bank.html ) and still reliant on oil . 
  while the worst pr\u00e9diction didnt happen and the economic news are better furthermore grow will come quite early . 
  it has not comparable with iran and dont expect us to come to a table . 
  [ what is funny is that it is kerry that came to start de-sescalating thing and wanting to negociate ] ( http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/05/16/world/europe/a-diplomatic-victory-and-affirmation-for-putin.html?referrer= )  it can rise and fall in an instant . 
  if oil prices had gone down or remained as low as they were russia would n't be in the same position . 
  during the worst of the fallen o\u00efl prices the economy grew at 0,4 % ... also it depend , o\u00efl is only 16 % of our gdp . 
  the economy has a strong industrial base that as soon the economy crash start to take over the growth . 
  the debt to gdp is ratio in russia is low at around 14 % . 
  there is almost no leverage in the economy -- not on the household side , surely not on the government side and even most corporations are not over-levered with debt . 
  that makes it easier for russia to insulate itself . 
  lets be honest china coming and economic power will be huge boost in the future . 
  you know that the ruble was the best performing currencies in 2014 and early 2015 and regain it value so fast that the central bank had to cut interest rates . 
  furthermore since 3 month inflation is falling constantly . . and will reach pre crisis level . 
  did you ever read an update financial reports ? 
   but i suppose you are right . 
  we should be doing much , much more . 
  i personally believe that sanctions should be increased , finland and sweden should join nato as soon as possible and that eu should send advanced weapons support to ukraine . 
  sure this is why policies thinkers in the us are applying your ideas ... 
  the amount of desilusion i read was hilarious ... what next pre emptive strike on moscow ??? 
  follow by army division led by general scooby-do ? 
   britain was very liberal , even before napoleon . 
  austria-hungary was going to collapse , note that the universal suffrage and the censorship laws were draconians and how its treat jewish and catholic while in prussia and some german absolute monarchies they had better rights . 
   but it became more and more liberal , especially after the ausgleich . 
  prussia and imperial germany politically were authoritarian no doubt . 
   but that changed dramatically after the proclamation of the weimar republic . 
  prussia is not the weimar republic furthermore it took an entire world war to erase authoritarians tendancies out of the german mindset . 
  this article is weird its look like those old theories on sonderweg . 
   so that they will be less likely to repeat their aggressive ways in the future . 
  that has totally work ... 
  i am affraid of europe now ... 
  like what , what do you mean ? 
  well that was hilarious to read, 
  or probably he act according to its own interest . 
  lets be honest odessa is one of the largest russophonic city in ukraine the administration top to down including the police forces are pro russian , the business community and the local mafia and the city and the region is predominantly russian also . 
  poroshenko can not appointed one of his man as governor on the region and wont risk to bring another guy to the post . 
  in order to clean the city he has appointed an outsider to do the job inside the region . 
  this is bringing an outsider to clean the house so you are sure that your man will be here and cracking down those `` rusisans '' . 
  kiev tried to do the same thing with donesk now the tactics has change . 
  as for dniepropetrovsk , it was kolomoisky money that save the city this is why he appointed an oligarchs of the city as governor . 
  its all about divide and conquer and having fundamentally a mafia logic . 
  i am willing to wait 5 month to see, 
   and since he 's under poroschenko 's authority , he should have few opportunities to steal from the country . 
  well that is hilarious but who did poroshenko appointed in other regions ? . . 
  the same old bunch with link to local mafa , if that was a country wide move sure ... 
  i would have agree ... but he did appoint the same old bunch in all the other part of the country including oligarchs . 
  for example , the new dnipropetrovsk governor , valentin reznichenko like kolomoisky , is a pillar of the city 's powerful jewish community and is a former business partner of boris lozhkin , the multimillionaire publisher now serving as poroshenko 's chief of staff .
