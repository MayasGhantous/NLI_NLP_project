  and we saw plenty of countries tearing themselves appart , falling in instabilities and chaos . 
  ironically if countries in the 20th centuries would have pass such laws some of them would have not fall in communist or cia back regime ( usaid )  it just opens everything up for abuse by the ones in power . 
  ultimatly , this is n't about the populist ` west vs. east ' debate everyone loves to use these days . 
  who ? 
  fat foreign organisation loaded with cash there should be no reasons to worry . 
  but if you are involve in politics you should be kickout out of the country . 
   this particular discussion is about a law that threatens the freedom of an enormous amount of people and is defined in a way that could be easily abused . 
  it 's just a lose-lose for anyone who is n't part of the ruling elite . 
  give me a break some ngos are nothing more if most of the times tools of western foreign policy they first act is to destroy the people 's confidence in themselves and their leadership with regard to solving their own issue and to teach them to look for guidance from their `` benevolent white masters '' . 
  let every people solve their own issue and address their own concerns , why the constant butting in of busybodied westerners ? 
   in serbia , us pollsters penn , schoen and berland associates discovered that the assassinated pro-western opposition leader . 
  where did you get that ??? 
  zoran djindic was a ** staunch pro western ** he was the one who replace milosevic . 
   the funny thing is that russia is already doing [ that ] ( http://europe.newsweek.com/hackers-claim-leak-messages-between-kremlin-and-frances-front-national-319442 ) . 
  not even close to fuel unrest . 
  and if you see the patterns they only begin after 2004 . 
  those are loans and perfectly legals  i do n't know why you 're mentioning saudi money here , as that 's not relevant to what we 're discussing . 
  oh give me a break http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/11435388/austria-passes-controversial-reforms-to-islam-law-banning-foreign-funding.html  as for the second article : cuba and the us have a very special and specific relationship , with both doing very questionable things in the past . 
  comparing us-cuban relations with us-russian relations is like comparing apples with chairs let be honest both , this point you made was weak the past you are talking about is 3 years ago ? 
  like the fake vaccination program in pakistan with the complicity of 6 ngos ? 
  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-cia-fake-vaccination-campaign-endangers-us-all/ was venezuela and the color revolution a special relation also ? 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/03/international/americas/03venezuela.html or the fact that reporters without borders has been to show completely biased towards us state d\u00e9partement goal . 
  lets be honest this laws is perfectly normal and rationnal . 
  even democratic india is tired with the crap that ngos are . 
   kremlin is directly financing many european organizations and politicians , like marine le pen , in order to fuel instability in the european union . 
  everybody knows it , we do n't like it , but we 're not stopping them . 
  are you serious ? 
  they were funds by russian banks because french banks didnt want to give them loans and it was never a secret . 
   again you guys are here with your whataboutisms trying to direct attention away from russia . 
  look everybody what austria is doing !!!!, 
  crying whatboutism is a way to make a russian shut his mouth . 
  here the matter you wrote that in the west you dont do that . 
  i simplly gave you an example . 
  i wouldnt even be surprise if more countries make similar laws in the next years . 
  you sure love to see gulf money flow towards muslim ngos in poor neighbourhoods and mosque in the west am i right ? 
  i mean after all they brought enada in tunisia and democratic muslim brotherhood in egypt . 
   surely such organizations have always been illegal ? 
  what this law aims to do is broaden the definition of `` threat '' so that any inconvenient organization can be put under it - similar to america 's `` terrorism '' scare tactics . 
  wich is quite fine , foreign money should not mix with politics . 
  they became illegal as soon foreign countries use them to fuel unrest wich is quite true . 
  in fact in india . 
  greenpeace was kickout this year  in the west we do n't ban or censor organizations even if we do n't like their message or actions ( provided that they 're not illegal organizations , and no , simply being `` undesirable '' is n't illegal ) . 
  oh give me a break http://europe.newsweek.com/controversial-austrian-islam-law-bans-foreign-funding-islamic-groups-309753 luckily russia is not the west . 
   the article only describes the consequences of what happens when the opposition finally gets a voice and fair elections in an otherwise authoritarian regime . 
  and how those regimes where authorirarian ? 
  they got fund by american state department money ( 5 billions according to the last numbers ) and foreign billionnaire money . 
  this is simply wrong this is creating purposely unrest now what is funny is that the opposition become exactly like the one they toppled the only difference is that they are pro west ( see ukraine , georgia , kyrzhystan , serbia ) what would happen if russia funds massivelely pro russian organisation in the west . 
  i do hope you agree that saudi money should keep flowing to mosque and group in the west and around the world right ? 
  after all they brought democratic islamist mohammed morsi to power in egypt ? 
  again you didnt answer the question how should russia tackle things like that http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/usaid-latin-americans-cuba-rebellion-hiv-workshops, 
  the law allows state prosecutors to ** declare ** ngo a undesirable one . 
  read the law you 're discussing . 
  and what is wrong with that ? 
  why would a state not have the right to do that against foreign organization ??? 
  i mean how should russia taclke things like that . 
  the law is perfectly fine how then russia should tackle issue like that http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/26/ukraine.usa, 
  what are you talking about ??? 
  the law is quite simple  surely russia is a more politically stable country than cuba ... ? 
  that is the thing any regimes can be the target http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/26/ukraine.usa, 
   cutting off international relations between yes they are cut off . 
  the law allow state prosecutors to sue ngos . 
   and gain more power against any anti-putin/pro-democracy ngo and political parties . 
  the law is against ** foreign ** ngos ... 
  that was three years ago ... 
   but please be precise if you are comparing and giving exact values . 
  the website you use was wrong , i took the numbers of your own governement not wikipedia like you did . 
  i was correct all the time . 
  interesting in your comment history its like that you argue completely unabashed . 
   well , it happened that it happened to be you to do n't even know what are you writing . 
  well with all due respect i think the discussion should stop now . 
  i dont like the direction where this conversation is heading . 
   that . 
  it 's actually surprising to an adult ( i 'm assuming you 're an adult ) to say that 4 % is actually higher than 30 % . 
  wow well i need to seriously laugh now because you seems to not understand at all all the thing i wrote including the numbers . 
  furthermore my nationality has nothing to do with it , you see bias where you want to see it . 
  if you have a problem with the russian federation or the putin governement , i dont see how that should affect me or has to do anything with me . 
  i definitely dont think my answers should be questionned on the basis of my citizenship or some flag on an internet forum . 
   too bad agriculture is one of the least productive sectors of economy . 
  if agriculture is a high portion of gdp then you 're dealing with a rudimentary economy ( think sub-saharian africa level ) . 
  definitely not , really large scale industrial famlands could lead to processing industries like yogurt , food stuff etc. 
  this is how east asian nations catch the west both taiwan and south korea . 
  the surplus of cash from agriculture was soon invest in light industries . 
  one thing also was that between 1999 and 2008 the world was in the middle of the biggest commodity boom ever record because of china growth . 
  everyone jump in the bandwagon brazil and australia grew on soilbeans and cattle for example . 
  everyone was rushing during the commodity boom even the little dysfuntionnal african state to look for foreign investment and surfing on the boom . 
  on the other hand , ukraine output productions decline the market was close to a handful of oligarchs and the giant mines of the donbass ( biggest coal reserves in europe ) and the biggest shale gaz reserve were not developp or under the control of a rent seeking elite . 
   wow you 're denying yourself , think about posting twice lol seems you didnt see my reply and i dont know what my nationality has to do with that . 
  when i am trading or giving market analysis i use the number that central bank analysts and governements provide me not the internet by the way there is a mistake in 1948 and 1955 . 
  anyway according to your own governement ( minister of treasury ) it will be 106 billions euros just between 2014-2020 . http://msp.gov.pl/en/polish-economy/economic-news/4015,dok.html now lets include the 2007-2013 , 57 billions dollars i wrote in my previous reply + the 15 billions between 2004-2007 http://www.mir.gov.pl/english/news/strony/10years_of_polands_membershipinthe_eu_10years_withthe_europeanfunds.aspx this is still around the double of the marshall plan if not more just for one country . 
  if khazastan would have get this money there would need to multiply their gdp by 3 and 1/15 but even with less revenue than poland from oil they will probably surpass poland by 2019 . 
  theres is no way the eu will take ukraine, 
   your own link showed that poland 's net receipts of eu money are 3 % of the gdp oh no this is ** per year ** wich is enormous wich mean 57 billions dollars just between 2007-2013 . 
  wich will rise to 60 billions in the next years + the revenues the equivalent of the double of the marshall plan ( for the entire europe ) other countries dont have this luck . 
  kazhastan is one of them and probably the only country that will catch the west in central asia . 
  ( it help also that they have one of the most competent leader ), 
   per cent of gdp is bullshit because the rest of gdp is largely achieved by rotating that oil and gas revenue in the economy . 
  should the oil and gas profits fall off , everything else takes a big step down . 
  that is assuming that russia dont have a strong service industrie ( wich doesnt include o\u00efl processing ) but the service sector stand at 58 % of the gdp . 
  o\u00efl d\u00e9rivative products are include in the 37 % of the industry but they are below the defense industry . 
  and poland has a shitload of eu money more than what kazhastan earn with gaz and o\u00efl .
