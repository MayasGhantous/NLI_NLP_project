  this is why people use ** gdp per capita ** and gdp ** per capita ** nominal . 
  where kazhastan in this case is rank higher than turkey http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.pp.cd, 
   lithuanian officials have not provided any comment on the report . 
  interesting that the lithuanians have not made any comments or deny it . 
  not kazhastan they are better than turkey economically . 
   how good are those patents though ?? 
  china has been rife with intellectual theft , and a notorious for pursuing patent filings without much check on the quality of patents the explosion in chinese patent applications results partly from the nation 's emphasis on r&d . for example , china 's telecom giant , huawei corporation , increased r&d spending by more than 25 % in 2012 , to $ 4.7 billion , and holds more than 50,000 patents worldwide . 
  china 's other telecom giant , zte corp , invested $ 1.4 billion in r&d in 2012 and led the world in pct filings for the second straight year , with more than 3,900 applications ( 32 % more than second-place panasonic ) . 
  overall , china spends almost $ 300 billion on r&d , second only to the u.s. , with one recent study predicting r&d spending in china will exceed that of the u.s. by 2023 . http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2013/04/04/chinas-great-leap-forward-in-patents/id=38625/, 
  of patents ! = innovation well its a trend similarly to the little asian nations in the 80s particularly japan wich is a schoking example . 
  china is slowly given results and i wrote that as a financial trader and ex developement economist . 
  people will have quite a surprise with china if not in less than 8 years maybe less considering the speed they are acquiring technology abroad . 
   the first four lost in the game . 
  they were innovative to an extend but not as innovative as their competing nations or failed for other reasons they are still example well my point still stand autocracy was never link to lack of innovation in the case of prussia and imperial germany that was never the case . 
  england and france never came close . 
  today german engineering reputation could be link to prussia  the little asian tigers were never more than workbenches until they opened up their societies . 
  well in the case of taiwan 60 % of the cadres in the kuomingrang party did study abroad . 
  and asians nations are bad example they were always open intellectually but close economically ( that may have save them ) as i said to indians and africans any nations can surpass any western nations , 35 years ago south korea had the same level of gdp per capita than sub africa . 
  they are both flawed democracy furthermore their economic growth if not most was kickout by authoritarian regime . 
  ta\u00efwan and south korea were both innovative under dictatorship furthermore china is at the top of patents grants and will compete with boeing and airbus as early as 2018 ( see the comac c1919 ) there was never a link with autocracy and innovation ( prussia , imperial germany , ussr , japan and little asians tigers ), 
  the democracy index is wothless and you are berating me on the corruption index ? 
  `` democracy index * * the report does not indicate what kinds of experts , nor their number , nor whether the experts are employees of the economist intelligence unit or independent scholars , nor the nationalities of the experts . 
  *  all three of those countries are usually seen as ( flawed ) democracies though . 
  [ see for example ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democracy_index#democracy_index_by_country_.282014.29 ) [ look clearly their gdp growth over the years and when their evonomic d\u00e9veloppement happen ] ( http://www.google.ca/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_kd_zg&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=country&amp;idim=country:sgp:kor&amp;ifdim=country&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) both start under respective economic plans of their dictactors in this case it its park chung hee and south korea . 
   there have been several ` crackdowns ' on corruption in both china and russia and they never changed much in the long run . 
  it 's mostly just targeted at people who are n't in the right patronage network . 
  in the case of china they give results for now as i already wrote the ccp is closely following singapore and ta\u00efwan and what south korea did https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;ei=rqjxvemojiwxyatjsicgba&amp;url=http://www.cognitivestyles.com/gina_pca/korean%2520history%2520etc/corruption%2520and%2520nic%2520development%2520s%2520korea.pdf&amp;ved=0ceaqfjal&amp;usg=afqjcnee43xq4qh3jzkhvd849fkjeh10ya&amp;sig2=5tuaj5hqbztvcyrrwhbjmg furthermore according to foreign policy they are good results http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/01/09/chinas-anti-corruption-campaign-ensnares-tens-of-thousands-more/   singapore is a one party rule but still better than most eutopeans countries on the corruption index  singapore is indeed kind of an outlier . 
  but the corruption perception index just measures how much corruption average people perceive ( for example while dealing with bureaucracy ) . 
  it 's not far fetched to assume that there is a lot of behind the scenes corruption at the top level of government circles . 
  not singapore its well know among investors . 
  single is the perfect example of meritocracy and had never and i must emphasis never had this reputation . 
   take any democracy ranking and compare it to a gdp per capita ranking . 
  if you ignore petro-states , you will at least a very strong correlation . 
  what i am seeing is that well d\u00e9velopper countries have anemic growth or are fallen in recession and that since the end of wwii every country that have catch the western world on every points have been dictartorship . 
   well , it seems to be conventional wisdom nowadays , that china is prove that a good economy does n't need democracy . 
  i would argue though , that it is n't . 
  chinas economy is still small when put in relation to its huge population . 
  i would disagree you have singapore , south korea and taiwan as examples . 
  there is a massive crackdown campaign in china and theres has been true results . 
  in fact china follow the model of corruption crackdown that south korea and ta\u00efwan did when they were autocracy . 
  in fact singapore is a one party rule but still better than most eutopeans countries on the corruption index democracy was never link to economic growth . 
  theres not much critics to say to china considering from where she came to achieve those amazing progress . 
  lol i swear to god and on my family i didnt see your flair lol i replied and i didnt even know you were estonian . 
  yeah lmao, 
   more crucial and world-changing things/events are happening in the world and they just get unnoticed around here . 
  like estonia getting in the nordic category of eurovision, 
  if you think the russian governement or any arab states and the african union will let the eu pass with this resolution you are fucking insane . 
  reminds me of that scene in elysium . 
   enough to line some corrupt interest group 's pockets with no responsibility to justify their spending i dont know that is base on assumptions and what are they doing right now with eu cohesion funds ? 
   also allowing the formation of a politically dangerous monopoly and sidestepping common eu rules on public procurement that all 28 other countries are bound by , in the process . 
  at the end , gazprom has found a new route thru a non eu member ( turkey ) a country that the eu manage to alienate . 
  the south stream infrastructure is already largely in place all the way to the black sea . 
  from there , it can go to turkey as has been suggested . 
  there is no need for eu approval to build pipelines to a turkish supply hub , as long as it will not be done by gazprom and greece seems to be eager , as well as serbia and hungary . 
  i think the eu mainly achieved once again to shoot itself in the foot by killing south stream . 
  for oil & gas producers , there will always be a market for their products in the long-term . 
  it is consumers who constantly have to worry about securing supplies at a decent price . 
  anyway as a commodity trader , i definiely want to see what the eu common energy policy will give ( skepticism )  if bulgaria is in need of financing , there are options within the eu but for that you have to justify their purpose and provide results . 
  sure if you provide me the sources on how stagnating eu will give 400 millions more per year to bulgaria as compensation and the job losts . 
  south stream would have brought you more than 400 millions additional money enough to raise your health budget by 25 % . 
  i found that quite sad . 
  so it is your alt account well that is funny . 
  the translator is clunky i was raise and born in the west and i own a company both in russia and germany . 
  there is nothing disgusting with the d\u00e9finition it is simply the true . 
  ** oxford dictionnary ** : * an organism which lives in or on anotherorganism ( its host ) and benefits by derivingnutrients at the other 's expense *, 
  those are international waters . 
  well give me more infos to be honest this is an unchartered territory for me . 
  i am quite surprise . 
  i have invest in portugal in the boat industries ( only one transaction ) and i mean its looks like people ( middle class ) are trying to find a scapegoat on the angolese . 
  they are probably the only sane investors ( and i am a financial trader ) that would invest in southern europe . 
  in my opinion they do that because of similar culture . 
  i do not think they should be reject or being mocked even if its the elite . 
  and lets be honest they were the one here when investors across europe didnt want to put money in portugal . 
  but to be honest as i said i am quite surprise that there is some kind of backlash against them . 
  i have a question for your what is the polical climate for investors in portugal are there some kind of backlash from fringe parties ? 
  seriously dont you think you portuguese are pushing it a little bit and that the article is sensationnalist ? 
  i am a russian and i did some businesses in portugal from what i can see in trade shows , the angolese are quite good people but definitely a minority in place i go on the other hands i seen plenty of chinese and fellow russians . 
  oh you deserve to be on / r/badeconomics you do know that the most succesful asian nations have huge reserve ? 
  germany also . 
  russia similarly to asian nations buildup foreign reserves because of the asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 . 
  this is a standard mechanic of ** prudence ** that has been adopted . 
  most western countries suffer from massive trade imbalance wich mean they are not able to increase their foreign reserves ( in time of crisis they are badly hit ), 
  you know like when i wrote that * russia pharmaceuticals industries has been growing 10 % per year since 2003 ? 
  * by those numbers they will be in the top 3 by 2020 even early dont waiste my time, 
  all of them it is clear and obvious you didnt . 
  read the link please, 
   so despite the fact that you linked the same source article 3 times all my claims are back by datas and studies i even gave the link of those studies and my experience as a commodity trader and developement economist . 
  and by the way only two are from the same source article that shouldnt change anything if you did read the comments i gave you since i provide links and even graph . 
  mr nillbop we both know that i am not an idiot why do you need to engage ? 
  and i am not even a russian citizen * per se *  you 've been ruled by a tzar for 16 years and still worship the ground he walks on despite his relentless stupidity in driving off finance ministers , continued overreliance on oil and gas and his oligarch chums , and destroying russia 's standing in the world . 
  i already answer those points here http://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/31v55m/ruble_whipsaws_top_forecasters_as_worst_currency/cqaezcx here http://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/315wnw/russia_frees_itself_from_oils_curse_signs_are/cpyrwfm and here http://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/315wnw/russia_frees_itself_from_oils_curse_signs_are/cpyrwfm, 
   as an ethnic russian ukrainian citizen well i am one also do you really think that give you credit in front of me ? 
   i find this display of racism the highest form of retardedness . 
  you might want to check your lies . 
  i have never been racist towards you . 
   why do people always assume that being an ethnic russian means support for living in a virtual mafia state ukraine is still a mafia state and will still be . 
  i do hope the ethnic russians minority inside your country do agree ... 
  this is simply the true . 
  never wrote that . 
  yes i hate the west for good reasons ( they are reprobated bastards and unabashed ) but i do love my german and romanian employees .
