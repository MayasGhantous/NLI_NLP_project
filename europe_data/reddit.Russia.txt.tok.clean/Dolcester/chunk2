  they call it '' liberation '' . 
  thanks, 
  its not an elaborate operation and its explicitely part of their missions to collect infos and gather intels . 
  as you can see yourself it is written . 
  believing that they dont do that is naive the 2001 security act has biff up the role of the agency soviets spies use to imply to a foreign agent that this agent should meet them at point a. 
  when the foreign agent would come to point a because he was lure he would get caught up simply . 
   there really would be no point for us to spy on russia . 
  i mean what are we going to do with the information ? 
  topple putin ? 
  lol ... yeah right ... altough nice fallacy with bringing putin . 
  a spy do more than that with intels . 
   the estonian information board ( estonian : teabeamet ) is an foreign security service and intelligence agency within the republic of estonia 's government hierarchy . 
  ** created in 2001 ** under * `` the security authorities act ** the information board coordinates with all estonian intelligence ** functions , ** collects intelligence concerning foreign interests and activities ** and transmits information to thepresident , prime minister , the general staff of the estonian defence forces , the interior minister , the foreign minister , and theminister of defence . 
  now the ** 2001 securtiy act ** of estonia is quite important . 
   it 's like andorra spying on france . 
  does not make much sense does it ? 
  the comparison is stupid . 
  the head of state in andorra is the french president . 
   kohver was most likely investigating some drug smuggling ring or something . 
  probably was going to buy some information with the money . 
  turned out to be a trap . . no he got fuck in a classic russian intelligence method to caught up foreign spies since the cold war . 
  they were amateurs the estonian didnt play well on that one ( but they sure a good in pr ) this is why they didnt even bother to take legal actions and nato didnt even bother to comment . 
  i am not naive nor young . 
   do you really believe , estonia a tiny country of 1,3 million people could give two shits about spying on russia ? 
  yes , every countries spy or want to gather informations . 
  its the basis of intelligence gathering more when the neigbours is what they call a threat . 
   we have reasonable access to us , uk and nato intelligence , why would we send a publicly known intelligence officer to russia ? 
  when did i say to send him ( most reports wrote that he was trying to recruit . 
  its like that soviets spies use to spot americans and british spies . 
  altough i am israeli , israrel use to do that also . 
  i dont understand how can someone have 5000 cash on him and a gun in a remote corner . 
   it would make absolutely no sense . 
  considering that i study into that and that i grew up during the cold war outside and inside the west . 
  it make perfect sense . 
  i certainly do not understand the exchange when it could have been easy for estonia to raise the case to the echr and win easily ( if they were sure ) . 
  https://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/3hktwg/russia_jails_estonian_security_officer_in_top/cu8agv1?context=3 p.s : they were no formal declaration of nato in that case since the beginning of those events . 
  since when the job of of a spy is to only destabilize ? 
   you are funny some of them didnt grow up in the cold war . 
  i dont blame them, 
   i think you can be a european federalist and still give the people the just representation they demand . 
  why should catalan citizens be ruled by madrid if most of them do n't want to ? 
  because deep of them people hate `` breakup '' it is associate witth decline and failure . 
  the breakup of catalonia would be the death of spain ( lets seriously not kidding ourselves ) the complete erasing of this state and the concept of a `` spanish nation '' . 
  it would seal for good the decline of spain that has start since the 16th century , spain would be what the hre and austria hungary is now in history books . 
  people tend to dont like that no matter how much facts you might provide them and they tend to resist, 
  and i have live in hong kong ( china ) one of the mecca of capitalism, 
  dont do that he is trying to engage you and moving deeper in that case what you do is to ignore . 
  he can not stay focus and the conversation ended when you debunked him on his bullshit picture/article . 
  lol did he truly tried to put soviet troops picture from 1977 and tried to fool me ? 
   have you heard of the massive rise of 10 cent trolls out of china and russia to push kremlin/beijing ideology on western websites like reddit ? 
  [ have you heard the definition of what is a shill gambit ] ( http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/shill_gambit )  also , right before putin went to crimea they decide to put billboards of stalin all over * the billboards reading `` eternal glory to the victors '' are sponsored by the communist party * you bore me, 
  your link doesnt work, 
   and then goes on to host parades with lenin and stalin portraits shut up , its bullshit that you are throwing there werent 0 parades where officials show lenin and stalin portraits . 
  its made up, 
   ( except maybe russia , but that varies ) . 
  it isnt true as a russian jew i find this one funny . 
  the ussr is dead and putin doesnt piss off the community, 
   russias is burning through its reserves since it severly needs money to pay foreign contractors . 
  they are growing and not burning actually since 5 months http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/rurefeg:ind  the ruble isnt worth a damn anymore and international business is conducted in either dollars or euros . 
  also growing and way better than last year http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/usdrub:cur the ruble is not in danger as long it dont reach 88 with us$ like last december and january . 
   russia does not have low debt because it is so keen on keeping a balanced budget but because of its unreliability as a debtor . 
  we have a positive net international position even during the crisis and our bond is among the best in emerging market and way better http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/government-bond-yield  they defaulted not even two decades back . 
  what does that have to do with today situation ? 
  that is the exact reason why we have reeserve and the exact reason why the country has been able to keep the lowest debt when even other oil countries saw it rising . 
  keeping debt low was always a focus of the administration since 2003 . 
   russia simply doesnt find people/banks willing to lend them money . 
  bullshit in that case the yield would have not be like that . 
   they cant pay for that without currency reserves . 
  are there any other sources on that ? 
   why did we accept countries like hungary and poland into the eu ? 
  germany is going way overboard with this but i ca n't help but wonder why we accepted those estearn countries into the eu . 
  and i cant see germany agreeing to take ukraine in the next century , wich would strenghten the visegard group and eastern europeans position and weaken germany and france position . 
   its obvious that the slavic countries fit way better to russia than the eu what do you think is in my head as russian brazul ? 
  are you butthurt toreon , 
  good and how about the * basic imcome * hype ? 
  do you have any links on that ? 
   re-approved , ca n't see this being posted previously wow !!, 
  he did the same thing with something that i posted , i asked him an explanation he never gavr them . 
  kick that guy out please, 
   mali and angola also drastically improved their life expectancy , you are rationalizing way too hard angola is loaded with oil but people living under the un poverty line is 40 % vs 15.9 % in russia . 
  putting the level of medecine of mali in the 90s to that of russia is ridiculous . 
  anyway i am probably waisting my time with you . 
   those are substitutes from eu as a whole not fucking germany . 
  plus what do apples and oranges have in common ? 
  germany alone - europe 's largest economy - paid more than the 19 lowest-paying member states combined in the eu budget how much a city like warsaw deserve ??? 
  didnt they already gave money in international aid before even poland joined the eu ? 
   plus if it was n't in eu 's or shall i say germany 's interest to have countries such as poland in eu ( even at this price ) they would n't accept those countries to the eu . 
  probably , you were the one who knocked the door , the fact is that they are bleeding money  so yeah your argument is at the level of a 10 year old : germans bombed the shit out of poles but do n't be mad because eu gives them a lot of money now . 
  not really , you sound like someone who is quite greedy and unabashed it is a common things some business german people are saying it is disgusting to see in real ( i definitely hope you are an exception ) wich i am quite sure . 
  but i am not german so i cant judge, 
   they never paid for the total destruction of warsaw for example . 
  you dont find 300 billions euros eu cohesion funds ( the equivalent of two marchall plans ) enough ??? 
  why would we need un approval in syria ???? 
  do you understand when the un is necessary ? 
  assad is recognize as the leader of syria there isnt any need to ask for a un approval . 
  aghanistan was a direct invasion wich syria isnt . 
  soviets military aid in asia , africa , latin america are examples . 
  as a russian i love american romanticism and how you view things , i saw your post on gettysburg ect but i am a cold hard realist . 
  germany is playing its card in front of europe and slowly asserting their pimary role and what they always sought , i cant blame them . 
  they will be hurdle but at the end eastern europe and uk simply have no means to resist ( i expect merkel playing a card where she will try to push uk out or just adopting a '' dont give a shit attitude '' .
