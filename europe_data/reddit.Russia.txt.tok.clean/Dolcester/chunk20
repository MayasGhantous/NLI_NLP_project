  and my impression was that german businessmen and french businessmen are smart enough . 
  i never had to do geopolitical debate with them they are not like you ( middle class and eating bullshit each day ), 
  you might want to check your lies . 
  oh it is you mr haaki yes i do rember you . 
  at the end look how this discussion ended . 
  the guy was pathetic and underestimate me with no qualm . 
   i 'll worry about the integrity of the organ of state after the invasion they 're facing has been repelled . 
  it wont happen for one it has been acknowledge that russians troops are a minority and for two as long they dont want to negociate with the rebels they will lost . 
  this all i want to hear mr nilbop so they have lie to the eu , lie to their own people , lie to their opponents , lie to eu principles , lie to the international community and make germany and france look like fools . 
  tell me why a nation like that is worthy to join your institutions like the eu ? 
   i 'm saying the treaty - both treaties - were worthless from the start , as they only benefited russia 's goals . 
  so why did ukraine signed them and swear france and merkel they will respect it ? 
  you have never provide anything on how did russia break anything or how they are breaking something . 
  zero sources out of your shitty mouth ** point 9 ** * restore control of the state border to theukrainian government in the whole conflict zone , which has to start on the first day after the local election and end after the full political regulation ( local elections in particular districts of donetsk and luhansk oblasts based on the law of ukraine and constitutional reform ) by the end of 2015 , ** on the condition of fulfilment of point 11 ** ** point 11 ** * constitutional reform in ukraine , with a new constitution to come into effect by the end of 2015 , the key element of which is decentralisation ( taking into account peculiarities of particular districts of donetsk and luhansk oblasts , agreed with representatives of these districts ) , and also approval of permanent legislation on the special status of particular districts of donetsk and luhansk oblasts in accordance with the measures spelt out in the attached footnote , *, 
  like him you lack a modicus of brain . 
  in wich agreements it is writting they should ? 
  the agreement have a condition wich kiev have not yet talk point 11 . 
  it can only happen if point 11 is respect . 
  ** point 9 ** * restore control of the state border to theukrainian government in the whole conflict zone , which has to start on the first day after the local election and end after the full political regulation ( local elections in particular districts of donetsk and luhansk oblasts based on the law of ukraine and constitutional reform ) by the end of 2015 , ** on the condition of fulfilment of point 11 ** ** point 11 ** * constitutional reform in ukraine , with a new constitution to come into effect by the end of 2015 , the key element of which is decentralisation ( taking into account peculiarities of particular districts of donetsk and luhansk oblasts , agreed with representatives of these districts ) , and also approval of permanent legislation on the special status of particular districts of donetsk and luhansk oblasts in accordance with the measures spelt out in the attached footnote , *, 
   when both sides are breaching both this agreement and the previous one , and the nation which started this war continues to funnel arms , armaments , military personnel and guidance to the rebels , by what metric can it be said to have worked ? 
  do you have any sources where the russians and the rebels are breaking it or where russia is currently supplying troops and rebels ? 
  because again even germany , france and the us have say they have respect it . 
  do you understand the point of a cease fire and what are the goals . 
   it is a treaty that the main beligerent , russia , has demonstrated they never intended to honour , therefore it 's of no use to anyone but them . 
  bullshit and i have shown it ,   until the international community steps in with military force to end this contra-esque insurgency and secure the border in the east , no peace treaties can work . 
  they are already osce monitors in ukraine they are the one that have acknowledge that the rebels and russia respect the deal . 
   until the international community steps in with military force to end this contra-esque insurgency and secure the border in the east , no peace treaties can work . 
  again the minsk agreement was working it has been acknowledge even by the us ? 
  right now it is kiev that dont want to fullfill point 11 the border of the east should be secure if ukraine respect what they say they will do with point 11 they have not . 
  how do you know russia has no intention to enforce it when they have at a point that even germany and france recognize that russia and the rebels have done it?while ukraine have not fullfill his part . 
  are you sick ? 
  you are saying a piece of paper that my governement and europeans leaders signed is useless base on no evidence while diplomats , newspapers are contradicting your claims ? 
  well that is funny and quite ironic even the americans have not even pull out this excuse . 
  you must be nut there is not a single reason to do it and nobody ask it formaly in writting or brought the point . 
  i am affraid those troops are only in your mind . 
  i have already answer your question they were not a single peace talk that said that russians should remove something . 
  kiev never ask that when they sign the agreement by the way . 
  you are turning in circle, 
   seeing as the us was not apart of it then , the us can not break an agreement what a surprise they are willing to undermine germans and french efforts despite the disagreements of paris and berlin . 
  now look closely at the nations that sent trainers that should ring a bell . 
  the us and the uk governments were not actual signers of the minsk agreements , both have endorsed the agreement and have strenuously demanded that the terms be observed in the fullest . 
  http://rt.com/news/231827-us-sanctions-russia-minsk/ please nobody is stupid as soon the agreements was sign the us made clear they didnt like it and they didnt even hide it . 
  washington was skeptic since day one . 
  http://www.dw.de/minsk-agreement-on-ukraine-us-reactions/a-18255132 now that the russians and the rebels have respect it . 
  they are underming french and germans efforts and want to tackle that themselves by increasing the tensions ( now look the diplomatic ballet today ) there is simply no reasons for us to want the situation to calm down . 
  have you see how things were calm ? 
  rebels have even withdraw their heavy weapons and the eu was willing to withdraw sanctions probably after july not that its matter since greece would have push it anyway . 
  suddenly 1000 trainers out nowhere for no reasons are coming to trained what they call `` ukrainians troops '' and are willing to send drones and lethal aid out of nowhere ? 
  while kiev have made no move for devolution and constitutionnal agreements ? 
  do you seriously take the russians for idiot ? 
  we agree to an agreement russia , germany , france , belarus and ukraine . 
  ( 13 points ) merkel and hollande have even comment on the situation today and seems to agree . 
  the us and kiev are undermining a peace agreement with a reckless move and you seems blind to hell . 
  yes russians and the rebels have.the agreements never said that russians troops neeed to leave ukraine or mention anything about that . 
  us is breaking openly an agreement despite germany and france concerns and you are trying to justify that by some bullshit nonsenses . 
  how so ? 
  the russians and the rebels havent even move are waiting for ukraine ( that has not respect point 11 ), 
  there is no need to that since the situation is bond with minsk ii . 
  you are trying to justify the breaking of an agreement by justifying that was never part of it . 
  if you can find any mentions of that inside the agreements that have been negociate . 
  look i am not talking to a child . 
  respect your part the deal simply or simply say that you are not satisfy . 
  that was never part of minsk ii or the misnk memorandum . 
  and i cant see a mention of that in the 13 agreements . 
  yes they have withdraw haevy weapons see my other comment yes america is playing escalaton this is why merkel and france have made a declaration today one day after the ameicans said they will send trainers . 
  nobody is fool us have probably their reasons rebels wont do nothing they are doing their things and they have prove it . 
  russia has done nothing . 
  in order for the border to be secure ukraine need to fulfill point 11 of the agreement . 
  kiev have not give any signs . 
  yes the rebels have fully remove heavy weapons they have respect their part of the deals http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31779869 you got to be blind to not see that us is trying to increase, 
  considering that i have also the ukrainian citizenship and that my mother live in the country and that i do business in the country it is my concerns definitely . 
  they made a bad decision , no matter how you try to spin that this country is a fail state . 
  instead of working on this peace deal that germany and france manage to get ( with difficulty ) and to build on the momentum . 
  they approve like idiots foreign help and break some points of the peace deal . 
  the separatists have not move so as the russian troops we are waiting that ukraine fullful point 11 of the agreement wich they dont want to do . 
   russian arms , armament and military support this is minks ii by the way . 
  point 2 have been respected . 
  point 11 we are waiting the ukrainian side ukraine has not give any signs . 
  lie to yourself all you want to find an excuse to justify those trainers in ukrainers ( that are breaking the peace deals ) merkel and france seems to disagree . 
  https://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/estonian-german-foreign-ministers-insist-on-minsk-agreements-implementation-386517.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11397900/ukraine-crisis-do-not-try-to-scare-putin-warns-merkel.html the american and kiev are playing escalation and are betting on that . 
  the rebels wont see that in a good light . 
  they just made a declaration . 
  and trust me they wont be another minsk iii at the end it is ukraine that will lost . 
  look i am not taking to a child i know you are from eastern europe i have an office in sofia ( bulgaria ) you might be a western lapdog all you want but the facts are here . 
   it 's not the case , main cause why baathist generals joined daesh , is maliki / shia idiocy . 
  no its the us just see the * coalition provisional authority order number 2 : dissolution of entities * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coalition_provisional_authority_order_2 political changes after the american invasion accelerated their rise members of baath party were barred from government positions http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/10/4-biggest-takeaways-americas-effort-build-iraqi-army, 
  please the cease fire is clearly in place . 
  you might want to check your lies we never we have respect it, 
  it is being in place how can europe be so na\u00efve, 
  it is link with point 11 of the agreement wich the ukrainian have not fullfill . 
  ukraine need to do that first . 
  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/minsk_ii * constitutional reform in ukraine , with a new constitution to come into effect by the end of 2015 , the key element of which is decentralisation ( taking into account peculiarities of particular districts of donetsk and luhansk oblasts , agreed with representatives of these districts ) *, 
    lets make things clear western trained rebels those rebels turned islamist and control vast land of syria territory with more than 3000 fighters defecting . 
   looks like syria army is more fragile then chinese porcelain . 
  3000 fighters , vs 1,600 t-72s , + - 1,000 t-62s , 2,250 t-55s and 2,450 bmps . 
  and look who is winning . 
  stop posting shit . 
  it is the syrian that is making gain . 
  http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2015/04/16/406506/syria-army-retakes-northwestern-villages you do rember that us completely disband the iraki army . 
  those people were angry and the sunni tribes .
