  yes they are breaking it * however , just the presence of foreign military forces assisting the war-fighting capabilities of one side in the conflict is a violation of the spirit of the ceasefire agreement and is definitely an escalation of the conflict . 
  * http://m.liveleak.com/view?i=ca9_1424996518#sthash.gs0ye8gu.dpuf http://m.liveleak.com/view?i=ca9_1424996518 merkel seems to agree http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11397900/ukraine-crisis-do-not-try-to-scare-putin-warns-merkel.html, 
  in your dream wich is game over us is trying to push russia by escalating wich merkel completely disagree http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11397900/ukraine-crisis-do-not-try-to-scare-putin-warns-merkel.html and greece will definitely block any new initiative and will probably block any extension of the sanctions in july . 
  interesting in another thread you seems to deny the armenian genocide and now you are lecturing me about honor ( whatever that mean in international relations ), 
  wich honor ? 
  you are breaking openly a peace agreement the rebels are not even pushing and are still in the same place . 
  this is a clear case of us escalating not the other way around . 
  if what that guy said is true breaking peace agreement is a necessary evil for you ? 
  you are a good armchair general at the end with trainers or not ukraine while be on the losing side . 
  this agreement was almost beg by germany and france . 
   i will continue to be disgusted with you for being a lying cunt and a clown . 
  be disgust all you want this is cold blood realism . 
  and frankly that is your opinion note that it does not matter much . 
   do you happen to know what part of the minsk agreement this training supposedly violates ? 
  that is why i wrote at the end of my first comment * then if that is true *, 
   no one brought anyone , they came by themselves then yes i will continue the narrative of troops on `` vacation '' while smiling . 
  in that case i fully expect my governement ( russia ) to escalate things . 
  we made clear to germany and france that we dont want us meddling or any foreign entity . 
  we have respect the minsk agreement and every newspapers have acknowledge that . 
  breaking it by bringing us trainers and canadian trainers . 
  than there is no reasons to hold our part of the deal if that is true . 
  china is not cooking any books this has been already debunk on the contrary the chinese tend to underestimate their assets and datas for example beijing has found they had 300 billions dollars more . 
  rhodium group has already did an extensive study on chinese numbers http://rhg.com/notes/a-better-abacus-for-china, 
  lets make things clear western trained rebels those rebels turned islamist and control vast land of syria territory with more than 3000 fighters defecting . 
  this is meddling and making the situation worse . 
  no matter how you try to spin that . 
   in your head only the irak invasion and cleaning baathist element was in my head also . 
  during much of the syrian civil war , the turkish government ( a nato member ) has allowed the islamic state of iraq and the levant army to use the `` jihadi highway through its territory and lets not forget that us strikes without the authorization of the syrian governeement has push fighters to join isis http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/23/us-air-strikes-syra-driving-anti-assad-groups-support-isis  maybe . 
  but it does n't mean that civil war in libya would ended . 
  there is no `` maybe '' in that khadafi had the strong positon until the no fly zone happen and until foreign troops start to target its grounds forces . 
  as soon nato bombard campaign start khadafi start losing ground and the impetus which lead to a rebel offensive . 
  oh and lets not forget rebels receive intels from westerners . 
  and that claim of genocide by libyan forces and the reasons for the intervention were bullshit http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/29/hillary-clinton-libya-war-genocide-narrative-rejec/?page=all, 
  the entire conversation was if westerners are meddling in syria yes they are even the origin of isis can be trace to them . 
   ( and as i am writing for third time , all this came after daesh entered the scene , but feel free to ignore it , no fear i wont call you idiot ) yeah . . after daesh ... as early as 2013 * the cia is expanding a clandestine effort to train opposition fighters in syria amid concern that moderate , u.s.-backed militias are rapidly losing ground in the country 's civil war , u.s. officials said . 
  *  so if this is famed western meddling in syria by you , so be it . 
  i just found funny that this caused unability for assad dictatorship to crush all opposition in ** eastern style ** seem that * `` west '' * is sooo powerfull :d you bring syria while i was talking on libya ghadafi troops had a clear advantage there is nobody denying that misrata would have fall . 
  oh i see you are the same idiot . 
  westerners never fail to amaze me to be honest . 
   yes , your example is disappointing . 
  it is hilarious to think that these have any impact on current situation . 
  are you sure ? 
  * the disintegration of harakat hazzm marks a turning point for the fight to control the surroundings of aleppo , syria 's biggest city and economic center . 
  the area , once controlled by what the u.s. considered moderate rebels who could be trusted and armed to fight president bashar assad , is now dominated by sunni muslim extremists . 
  * * the first syrian rebel group to receive arms from the cia -- disbanded this week.as a result , much of northern syria is in the hands of the extremists , and the united states is left with no palatable ally in the area in the midst of a regional conflict that continues to spiral out of control . 
  *  do n't know , but you surely be able totell me . 
  or this is only rethorical question without answer ? 
  well 3000 fighters http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/08/free-syrian-army-rebels-defect-islamist-group last month it was hundred men . 
  as a russian jew i definitely disagree . 
  the tsar was someone that use to blame outsiders for his obvious imcompetence and archaic system during his reign one of the most famous pogroms took place -- in kishinev , on easter ( april 6-7 ) , 1903 . 
  the kishinev pogrom happened when there was a lot of tension in russia ( two years before the first , unsuccessful revolution ) . 
  wanting to dispel the tension , the czarist government once again organized a pogrom against the jews . 
  after two days of mayhem , the czar said , `` okay enough -- mission accomplished . 
  now it 's time to stop it . 
  while they were 12 000 russian troops that did nothing . 
  blaming other has been a constant feature of tsarist russia . 
  the guy ask example of `` western meddling `` i gave them . 
  i also never denied russia or anything you can see that in my first reply to the guy . 
  you mean the fsa who is allied with al nusra and the islamic front ? 
  how many of them defect to al quaeda with us weapons ? 
  well as long they are focus on economic growth ethiopians will back them but if not that will backfire . 
  from what i see they are truly focus for now . 
  the party has become a one party system you know crushing dissent massive diffamation laws slowly copying the model of china and the taiwanese kuomintang they dont even hide that . 
  the party has also become a technocracy . 
  i have been doing business in africa since 12 years and i am quite happy that gave true results . 
  as i said the asian model should be follow the other country in africa with biggest growth is rwanda . 
  paul kagame have been doing the same thing . 
  you might want to check your lies like training rebels in jordan as early as 2013 before isis http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/08/west-training-syrian-rebels-jordan http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10283758/first-syria-rebels-armed-and-trained-by-cia-on-way-to-battlefield.html and you know what is funny losing weapons and those fighters to islamist factions and i never wrote that somalia was a western intervention in my previous reply ( altough see how unosom quiclky withdraw from the countries and the battle of mogadishu ), 
  what are you talking about western and gulf states meddling are the only reasons assad as not win yet thanks god russia , china and iran backing are the reasons he didnt fall like khadafi . 
  without foreign intervention fast crushing of dissent like algeria would have made libya not become a shithole or a somalia . 
  ghadafhi was on its way to win and crush them . 
  intervening was a mistake and i blame the french . 
  the ethiopian dam has been finance 90 % by ethiopia . 
  the country has undermine democracy and have sent many people to china to study deng xiaoping reforms . 
  the country is on its way to become the dominant engine of growth in africa . 
  i do business over there and i am quite happy . 
  your republic is an angel sure there is nobody denying it . 
  your comment history is amazing, 
  so what you want to keep other countries below you ? 
  well if entire nations are still being poor mass immigration will keep going and all the tensions . 
  the west also need to be check . 
  japan is a special case since they still claim the russian kuril islands this is literally a gang , clique that is running the show . 
  i dont see that in a good light, 
  the faster the multipolar world happen the better it will be . 
  this is getting ridiculous, 
   the same people that perpetrated one of the worst genocides in modern times have not lost power for decades and there is clear discrimination against opposition parties . 
  thats false they have lost powers and war criminals were put on trials since the 80s https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khmer_rouge_tribunal i think you are confuse the current khmer ( kprp ) who is currentely in power are not the same as the one who did the genocide the kprp is an entire different political party you cant make the difference between the kprp and the cpk also the first elections were in 1998 while opposition parties only did a coalition and unite in the last election ( 2013 ) . 
   it is getting better oh i see i dont even know why i am waisting my time in this discussion . 
   the have one party with majority control . 
  no only a slight majority they have 68 of the 123 seats in the national assembly ( 48 % )  and opposition parties are heavily disadvantaged the opposition has 55 seats out of 123 ( 44 % ), 
   russia has a press freedom score below chad , bangladesh , and cambodia . 
  yes and italy has a press freedom lower than niger and haiti . 
  while nato member montenegro rank lower than qatar while france is below el savador by the way russia is between maylaysia and the phillipines and bangladesh and cambodia both are full fledge democracies, 
  they didnt extend sanctions on us and we didnt http://www.unian.info/world/1108887-georgia-not-planning-to-join-new-sanctions-against-russia.html http://tass.ru/en/russia/814290, 
  link is here buddy, 
  oh that cute is we use your own indicator `` transparency international '' poland corruption barely change since the end of the 90s . 
   also , if you understand economics ( which you do n't woosh ... dont think you know me much the rest of the reply is an insane rambling so i wont bother with it . 
   because those were sanctions by the eu and the world police ( usa ) you might ask yourself why some non nato and non eu members put them  it 's your choice , but get ready for people to start starving in that shithole . 
   i guess the russian deputy finance minister is retarded too . 
  nah  http://www.rbc.ru/economics/23/11/2015/5653207c9a79474929a83e4b the russian finance ministry still expected russia to still growth next year .
