  i am going to take my time with you why do you think turkey was the only nato member who didnt put sanctions on russia for our anexation of crimea ? 
  why do you think turkey didnt follow other europeans countries in putting sanctions on us when we were supporting donbass ? 
  why hasnt erdogan react when we arrest your own businessmen ? 
  why erdogan doesnt react when russia is annoying turkey economically by banning left and right and curbing your tourism sector . 
  turkey represent less than 4 % of our total trade and his meaningless . 
  there isnt any rational in thinking that we would be hurt much , stop smoking . 
   is money flowing to russia . 
  bullshit we have a net international investment position with you no way that your shithole is the one flowing money to us, 
  barclays themselve came up with a forecast that oil price is likely to rise to $ 50 by the end of 2015 and increase to $ 60 in 2016 . 
  while the uae themselves were bullish and confident enough to think that oil could reach 60 by the end next year . 
  yes i am going to take the retarded opinion of a finn over the imf and the world bank . 
   less and less trading partners . 
  thanks but i am going to enjoy that norhstream 2 merkel just signed :0, 
  we are the third biggest trade partners of turkey while they dont even crack our top 10 oh my god we are going to crumble hahahahaha your reply make as much sense as europeans bragging that russian sanctions wont hurt them . 
  turkey has no leverage whatsoever . 
  / u/parkitson got it wrong russia has currently the world 's most advance man portable anti aircraft missile i.e verba manpads . 
  about 50-100 of these in kurdish sepratist hands will make kurdish provinces no fly zones for helicopters and confine f-16s to altitudes  30,000 feet . 
  we have also have the some of the most advanced anti armour man portable missiles like the kornet . 
  downgraded export versions of which have destroyed/disabled israeli merkava and m-1 abram tanks . 
  we can also put s-400 / 500 batteries in syria to impose a 50-100 km wide no fly zone on the turkish side of the border . 
  turkey ** has 0 fucking chances ** no matter how delusionnal that yank is and stupid enough to think that russia require a direct land border to make turkey collapse . 
  ( altough we have armenia wich share directly a border with a country who doesnt recognize genocide and who has a border conflict with turkey including and who also has direct acess to kurdish lands ) . 
   2007 : european court of human rights rules against russia for repeatedly refusing to grant church of scientology status of valid religious organisation .

   well you need switzerland to play ball on that one , yep it takes two to tango, 
  well  you finally see how important being on topic is . 
  yeah its in your mind you are seeing thing like the bots shut !!!, 
  nope , i simply answered a question you deseperately asked afer the topic was close with me dominating  as usual of course  seems you arent observant :d hahahaha  when you were throwing around off-topic data . 
  again its all in your mind  pretty much the africa of europe ( ukraine included ) [ i didnt know estonia was higher than russia on this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_hiv/aids_adult_prevalence_rate ) :d in my case i prefer to stick with definition and the classification of what is a thirld country with respectable institutions or the ocde better life of index instead of * the institute of paranoid moron * :d but feel free to have your own opinion astlano will surely agree with you :o ruble , * thirld world * , pension funds , crimea . 
  i was really hoping you would stop hamstering , you are way too easy fuck i love it zzzz the tricks are getting old ** buddy ** :d one of my favorite part was this retarded one you wrote  perhaps you should keep your faith in the rubble ? 
  it ai n't doing so good . 
  ** hahahahaahab oh shit hahahaba lol **  how important being on topic is . 
  if you want it so much after you asked all those questions well ok go right ahead debunk me quick quick hurry up !!!, 
   -------------  you seemed to completely miss the point of me asking photographic or video evidence . 
  bla bla bla nah you never asked that you are just trying to save your ass where are the proof * memes * thats hilarious now  what even using western sources doesnt cut it for you lol [ i mean there is even an entire wiki article ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_euromaidan_regional_state_administration_occupations ) at that point you are just waisting my time on this one  that was easy . 
  next !!!, 
   you 're having some trouble following the topic of the previous comments . 
  nah it just good to see you hamstering and losing your shit   how exactly does that pertain to dpr/lpr not being utter shitholes ? 
  sure thats why kiev waiste manpower and start agreeing with every terms  it 's not like kiev is any hurry do abide by the minsk 2 agreement . 
  hahahahahahah [ as they have any choice ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11733025/angela-merkel-and-francois-hollande-urge-ukraine-leader-to-give-rebels-self-rule.html ) they sure are in hurry thats why they fast lane the autonomous law in the parliament poor kiev people even threw grenades at them for that  thats why they are withdrawing ** buddy ** the only people that are in no worry are the rebels since they have report the elections . 
  kiev seems to be butthurt . 
   no choice to do what ? 
  shovel money in regions that have been ruined , whose population has decreased substantially , a region that 's run by armed gangs ? 
  ** yep ** imf * so what about the risks ? 
  there is no point in glossing over the situation on the ground in ukraine . 
  if the conflict in the east of the country intensifies -- and we all certainly hope it wo n't -- then one has to be concerned about the sustainability of the expected recovery . 
  so we can only urge ukraine and russia to work with all parties to continue the peace process . 
  * buddy the industrial base , the fucking coal and even the gaz are in the east . 
  the most funny thing [ the separate districts of the luhansk region are even increasing coal supplies to kyiv-controlled parts of ukraine since three weeks ] ( http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/297576.html )  so , hence why they 'll utilize a measly amount of funds in improving dpr/lpr facilities , industry , etc. 
   figures . 
  it 's pretty much a 3rd world country . 
  [ well high income economy according to the world bank and the imf  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_bank_high-income_economy )  get back at me when you do . 
  you asked me a random question wich as nothing to do with the rest of the conversation i simply answered it :d :d feel free to leave hahaha, 
   might as well congratulate a special needs kid for getting a medal for participation . 
  not when you beat forecast to be in top  april 1 - 57.6 , april 15 49.9 , now 65.4 . 
  nice streak you had going there , dude . 
  [ oh and by the way the central bank voltuntarily lower the ruble in april up until june and welcome it since it was getting too strong ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-01/ruble-extends-declines-as-central-bank-suspends-one-year-fx-repo ) you might be happy to add that now :d * russia 's currency has traded stronger than its 60-day moving average for more than five weeks + that he has rebounded from a record-low close on aug. 24 and the upswing :0 *  that instability surely is welcome . 
  according to the world bank things have stabilize since a good three months  thanks for acknowledging rubbles humiliating defeat . 
  thanks for acknowledging it was strong :d  when compared to the reality of you living in russia kek oh i dont live in russia, 
   after it suffered a humiliating defeat . 
  haahahaa you are 100 % true and [ by march turned into a miracle ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-05/ruble-whipsaws-top-forecasters-as-worst-currency-becomes-best )  while you focus on its recent performance , you 're forgetting how rubble went from 35 against the dollar to 65 . 
  it indeed is strong you asked me how the ruble is doing . 
  the answer is fine . 
  why would add the 35 nonsenses and go back to july 2014 ? 
  [ still doesnt change that in a year to date base is 7.57 % ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/usdrub:cur )  indeed is strong well thanks for admiting it haahahahahah yep and should stay like that and no go higher nor go back to 35 . 
  thats why we are trying to lower it . 
  :d :d ( i seriously enjoy those smileys ), 
  thanks for the laugh so you are showing exactly what the article is saying looking at your graph ? 
  russia 's currency has traded stronger than its 60-day moving average for more than five weeks + that he has rebounded from a record-low close on aug. 24 and the upswing :0 and that the ruble volatility fell to an almost three-month low . 
  indeed it look quite good that might explain whythe reseves are going up . 
  and why the finance ministry want it to be lower . 
   wow he also said there 's no encirclement in debalstova . 
  you 're really desperate if you believe what he says . 
  oh sure ukrainian politicians are dumb but the bosses are germany and france . 
  thats why the autonomy law was pass and thats he withdrew heavy weapons . 
  wich mean he is fully cooperating germnay and france , i love those guys  rubble and strong . 
  you 're quite the fucking comedian lol you asked a question and i asnwer it with the most recent link :d :d hahaaha, 
   yeah , dude . 
  they have been itching so hard to do just that - follow minsk 2 . 
  haahahaha november 6 : [ deutsche welle : poroshenko says he is fully cooperating on minsk ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine-abroad/deutsche-welle-poroshenko-says-he-is-fully-cooperating-on-minsk-401530.html ) :d and thats cute poroshenko yesterday : [ i 'm sure about the unity of the eu and its solidarity with ukraine ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/poroshenko-im-sure-about-the-unity-of-the-eu-and-its-solidarity-with-ukraine/a-18832626 ) haahahahaha  btw , how is rubble doing ? 
  the currency is too strong now  we are trying to lower it :d :d november 11 bloomberg : http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-11/ruble-volatility-ebbing-opens-window-to-government-intervention, 
   just warming you up , dude . 
  hahaahahah lol  russian taxes/pension funds going to dpr/lpr will be next . 
  minsk agreement ii point 8 :  8 . 
  restoration of full social and economic links with affected areas including social transfers , such as payment of pensions . 
  to that end , ukraine will restore its banking services in districts affected by the conflict.define the modalities of a full restoration of social and economic connections , including social transfers , such as payments of pensions and other payments ( income and revenue , timely payment of communal bills , restoration of tax payments within the framework of ukrainian legal field ) . 
  i deeply think france for agreeing and who brought that inside the agreement  but as i already told you keep the faith !!, 
   deflect harder , dude . 
  in your mind  does n't surprise me , since you are a mongoloid rape baby .
