  hahaahahah wow that escalate quickly  that leaves you being the nut , since there 's only two us here . 
  nah they are probably four people in this thread assuming i count yasenfire . 
   posting sources where the majority of them do not pertain to what i said sure is easy . 
  yeah right ... haahaha hahahaa hhaahaha, 
   did you stutter ? 
  maybe  lol can you even fucking read ? 
  how ironic hahaahaha  never said there 's `` my crew '' in this exact thread . 
  that 's your own conjecture . 
  oh but you have astlano . 
  i call that a crew !!!, 
   oh so you 're the nut ? 
  glad we got that settled . 
  lol so astlano was in your mind also ? 
   i love how certain you are of course , the conversation was pretty easy on that front including my sources . 
   do n't worry , they 'll start with the pension funds , like they already did in regards to crimea . 
  wishes hahahahaba lol keep the faith !!, 
   just like you did with `` double the gdp of georgia '' ? 
  miam  ** that put ossetia at 8,390 $ us higher than georgia ( 7160 ) but right that still not the double but still quite a bit higher than georgia **   nope . 
  there 's more . 
  i see no one in this thread except you buddy and a nut hahahha '' ya got your all crew !!! '', 
   `` i am more popular than you !!!! '', 
  hahahahaba  what points ? 
  do n't tell me those were your points lol zzz  enjoy your taxes going to dpr/lpr , friendo . 
  hahahaba , keep the faith !!, 
   you must be dumb not to see the nature of my comments in / r/russia . 
  keep saving the face :(  i guess you 're also salty since you post here ? 
  oh lol hahahaba , i dont know buddy , i just your clunky logic   in regards to external approval - at least i got some . 
  because of one guy ?? 
  oh shit hahahaha `` i am more popular than you !!!! '', 
  hahahahaba  ca n't say that about you . 
  what 's even funnier - i 'm not the only whose highly skeptical of you being an economist . 
  your attempt at portraying yourself as economically knowledgeable has pretty much been pointless . 
  the shit you 've written is a testament to that . 
  go ahead and reply with a bunch of inane ramblings and shitloads of smileys . 
  they describe what kind of individual you are - laughable . 
  an entire paragraph of insults and not a adressing a single main points . 
  this is where i simply call it day and here a smiley for you , 
   you 're incapable of expressing your opinion due to your poor english skills . 
  and the classic about english skills as usual what no more nice now  and soon after i wrote * anyway i love better your rreply keep them like this one , 0 insults , nice and clean * huh huh   average russian gdp which you applied to s ossetia and and said the following '' = double of georgia '' . 
  bullshit never did that  ** that put ossetia at 8,390 $ us higher than georgia ( 7160 ) but right that still not the double but still quite a bit higher than georgia **  that part is quite clear hamstering is strong with you  why the hell do you even mention it in the first place zzzz you seems to forget i wrote  6 ) abkhazia and south ossetia are basically russian province now , ** they can move around and still have way more opportunities than a gerogian could ever hope **  so far , your effort has been lacking . 
  yeah ...  the length of my replies is directly proportional to the lenght of the you drive on . 
  oh oh oh call it what you want to save face its ok :d  as astaleno ( ? ), 
  its cute you are looking for external approval its also a classic :d what shoud i mentionned batyrsyrk , spaceracoon , yasenfire their opinions on you base on your comment history in the last two days . 
  definitely you are losing your way as your reply are getting weird , i mean why would i care about this guy . 
  reassuring yourself maybe who knows ? 
  oh and astlano is guy who tought that kiev wasnt going to give money until i properly put his ass down lol lol lol who would have tought that crazy folks hang together :d  you do live in an alternate reality . 
  stay salty , bruh . 
  hahahahah hahaha oh shit you crack me up again here i am gon na put it again :d here here --------  you jumping in the defense of dpr/lpr of course i did that more when your points were shit  showed how salty you got . 
  oh lol hahahaah lol said the guy with comments in / r/russia [ 1 ] oh shit lol you reply is more retarded when you are clearly the one who orginally replied to yasenfire comment and brought dnr/lpr in the entire thread hahahahahahahah even if your nonsense point was true i sure dont see how it can make salty / r/europe [ 2 ] : a forum for discussion about europe and its neighbourhood you see again its all in your mind :d, 
  wow  you clearly try equate s ossetian gdp pp with russia 's average . 
  more so , you also defending this disingenuous approach when confronted . 
  lol ** bullshit ** :d and i quote ; that cant be clearer than that  that put ossetia at 8,390 $ us higher than georgia ( 7160 ) but right that ** still not the double ** but still quite a bit higher than georgia  i was clearly talking about the the ** average ** russian citizen gdp per capita . 
   the amount of damage control is off the charts . 
  zzzz its in your mind like those invisible bots you were talking about  you jumping in the defense of dpr/lpr of course i did that more when your points were shit  showed how salty you got . 
  oh lol hahahaah lol said the guy with comments in / r/russia oh shit lol you reply is more retarded when you are clearly the one who orginally replied to yasenfire comment and brought dnr/lpr in the entire thread hahahahahahahah even if your nonsense point was true i sure dont see how it can make salty / r/europe : * a forum for discussion about europe and its neighbourhood * you see again its all in your mind :d thats sure explain why your message are getting shorter as your points drop  anyway i love better your rreply keep them like this one , 0 insults , nice and clean . 
   now since 90 % of south ossetians are officially now russian citizens in average a russian citizens have a gdp per capita of 23 000 $ = double of georgia hahahaababah hahahaababah oh shit thats funny do you have reading comprehension problems ? 
  where do you see that * `` you applied russia 's average gdp per capita to s ossetia * whats wrong in saying that ** in average ** a russian citizen has the double gdp than a gerogian . 
  this is factual should i show you the imf datas :d :d  gotcha b ** h. getting heated and losing your shit to soon being crush thats delicious  i like more the fact that your reply are getting shorter  back to square 1 :d keep the faith, 
   immediately after you applied russia 's average gdp per capita to s ossetia . 
  i never did that at all . 
   zzzz indeed hahahahaba, 
   you 're forgetting that part where you applied russia 's average gdp per capita to south ossetia zzzz there is nothing much to add   ** but right that still not the double ** but still quite a bit higher than georgia  ** and thats only the case of a russian poor region **, 
  wow one sentence now hahaahaha and talking about backpedaling lol  if there 's nothing wrong in admitting you 're wrong , zzzz zzzz  but right that still not the double but still quite a bit higher than georgia zzz zzz, 
   you surely are an economist . 
  wow one sentence only and the classic insult now should i put the study   where 's the proof , though ? 
  i am going to settle with germany  and what i wrote earlier . 
   false , when he was confronted he decided to backpedal . 
  how terrible !, 
  there is nothing wrong in admiting you are wrong  nah , dude . 
  its about what i wrote - subsidization . 
  then you chimed in and started to talk about a topic that does n't pertain to subsidization . 
  hahahahaaha study : ** you should read the link i gave.and probably my first reply ** wow you dont read ? 
   welp , unlike russian taxpayers , they certainly can afford to do that . 
  should i say `` that was force too ''  they do n't even have to scoop up some of those pension funds like russia did a while ago . 
  wow wow wow call 911 !!, 
  hahahahaaha  this sounds so awfully forced . 
  no its funny or hilarious  nice to see you admitted how `` you '' blew up ukraine . 
  no problem i was always a realist and never hide my opinion  let me know when dpr/lpr sees that money . 
  according to the osce things seems to get start as i wrote earlier . 
  but sure you can still hope , wishes are always good keep the faith !!, 
   i absolutely love seeing you get so heated and wasting so much time writing these long ass posts . 
  well you asked it you shall receive  i know exactly where i will stop   oh really ? 
  does my username is yasenfire ? 
   those sources did not show maidanuts storming cop stations with rifles . 
  haahaha haahaha  it just said how a bunch of guns were stolen . 
  are you sure only  ** a woman is in critical condition after she was shot in khmelnytsky ** during the storming of a local security service of ukraine office by anti-government maidan protesters . 
  ** a car reportedly drove up to the building and ** opened fire , with six to eight bullets hitting the woman in her chest ** nah those are reports it also said that people were killed  i 'm amazed you ca n't tell the difference . 
  zzz its good to see you `` hamstering ''   oh wait , you took the average amount of russia 's gdp and applied it directly to south ossetia , which is of course a very disingenuous way to count gdp . 
  gdp per capita by the way : we already went over this most ossetians have immigrated to north ossetia ( only 40 000 left ) be definition have all russian citizenship and being inside russian datas thus making it perfectly valid . 
   even more so when the gdp of russia 's regions fluctuates wildly . 
  bla bla bla i show clearly numbers in 2009 and 2013 between those years it still grew and was higher than shithole georgia   according to the datas while russia still grew in 2014 and even with a minus 3 % growth this year georgia wont go nowhere . 
   what happened to double the gdp of georgia ? 
  for someone who is telling i cant see things you seems a little bit lost did you see what i wrote in my previous reply ? 
  and i quote  ** but right that still not the double but still quite a bit higher than georgia  **   are you even trying , dude ? 
  this has finally put a nail in the coffin of you being an economist . 
  you certainly are n't fooling anyone but yourself . 
  try harder   you mean posting data that shows wages ( what you did ) as means of proving those regions are n't heavily subsidized ? 
  that would indicate you 're the one `` hamstering '' - whatever that means . 
  yep wow you cant read here what i wrote  ukraine being a centralized republic wich was never a federal republic the question to fiscal transfer is hard to see . 
  [ wich was the exact questions the german governement contact group in ukraine was trying to answer and similar conclusions ] ( https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www.beratergruppe-ukraine.de/download/tn/tn_04_2014_en.pdf%3fphpsessid%3d9179d51253f5275041d30440e4b7c42d&amp;ved=0cboqfjaaahukewio37jb3objahud7rqkhwlmctq&amp;usg=afqjcnhrfc3er-knibn_zsyemh6nfwbgdq&amp;sig2=yi60qsnslgqjmyi13z0hqq ) thanks germany !!!,
