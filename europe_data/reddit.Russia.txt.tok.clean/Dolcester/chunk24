  i was just debunking your bullshit as usual  and i highly doubt that ** two tiny wealthiest regions ** wich are 30 % of your exports are the one getting subsidies by backwards rural pro westerners but hey . 
   you might want to wait a few years and see how much advancement dpr/lpr will see . 
  as history has shown , probably not a whole lot . 
  oh i am surprise you quickly hide and wrote that sentimental shit . 
  with 0 datas and thinking . 
  lol you only have wishes poor you  there isnt any previous history . 
  german taxpayers and eu money taxpayers reconstruction seems to have always been success story one need to look the 90s and the 2000s . 
  i have no doubt that western european taxpayers will do good  `` taxpayers '' , i fucking love to use that world . 
  we fucking blow up ukraine and the german and the eu gave them 650 millions in reconstruction to the exact people that shit crack me up as i was saying to a friend . 
  hahahahaahaha hahahahaaha  hahahahaba  haahahahaha  you see ossetia and the other regions didnt get those candies  the saltyness is definitely real . 
  just keep getting heated - that will almost certainly make your response even more entertaining . 
  zzz, 
  zzz   you seemed to completely miss the point of me asking photographic or video evidence . 
  bla bla bla nah you never asked that you are just trying to save your ass where are the proof * memes * thats hilarious now  what even using western sources doesnt cut it for you lol [ i mean there is even an entire wiki article ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_euromaidan_regional_state_administration_occupations ) at that point you are just waisting my time on this one  that was easy . 
  next !!!, 
   you 're having some trouble following the topic of the previous comments . 
  nah it just good to see you hamstering and losing your shit   how exactly does that pertain to dpr/lpr not being utter shitholes ? 
  sure thats why kiev waiste manpower and start agreeing with every terms  it 's not like kiev is any hurry do abide by the minsk 2 agreement . 
  hahahahahahah [ as they have any choice ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11733025/angela-merkel-and-francois-hollande-urge-ukraine-leader-to-give-rebels-self-rule.html ) they sure are in hurry thats why they fast lane the autonomous law in the parliament poor kiev people even threw grenades at them for that  thats why they are withdrawing ** buddy ** the only people that are in no worry are the rebels since they have report the elections . 
  kiev seems to be butthurt . 
   no choice to do what ? 
  shovel money in regions that have been ruined , whose population has decreased substantially , a region that 's run by armed gangs ? 
  ** yep ** imf * so what about the risks ? 
  there is no point in glossing over the situation on the ground in ukraine . 
  if the conflict in the east of the country intensifies -- and we all certainly hope it wo n't -- then one has to be concerned about the sustainability of the expected recovery . 
  so we can only urge ukraine and russia to work with all parties to continue the peace process . 
  * buddy the industrial base , the fucking coal and even the gaz are in the east . 
  the most funny thing [ the separate districts of the luhansk region are even increasing coal supplies to kyiv-controlled parts of ukraine since three weeks ] ( http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/297576.html )  so , hence why they 'll utilize a measly amount of funds in improving dpr/lpr facilities , industry , etc. 
  nah you see this small amount is part of the bigger ** 650 millions ** that germany allocated to rebuilding eastern ukraine . 
  the entire money is manage and under german control [ poroshenko asks rada to ratify memo with germany on $ 500 million loan to restore donbas infrastructure ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/poroshenko-asks-rada-to-ratify-memo-with-germany-on-eur-500-million-loan-to-restore-donbas-infrastructure-392959.html ) also  in addition , the negotiating parties also agreed that ** ukraine would provide the german side with detailed estimates of repair costs . 
  ** ** it was also agreed that both sides would monitor the use of the funds ** i have no doubt that this half billion will go where it should . 
  and to add to that a whooping 240 millions from the eu from wich 55 % go in non governement control areas since one month http://ec.europa.eu/echo/where/europe-and-caucasus/ukraine_en thanks for your taxes  pseudo economist dolcester strikes yet again . 
  wow already  gdp per capita of georgia - $ 9,209 ( imf ) , $ 7,160 ( world bank ) , $ 7,700 ( cia factbook ) . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_\\ ( ppp \\ ) _ per_capita ) this leads me to question your claims of being an economist . 
  it 's certainly not the first time . 
   [ you see i use the datas of 2009 for russians regions by looking at the wiki article ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_federal_subjects_of_russia_by_gdp_per_capita ) wich mean in 2009 the region had an higher gdp that gerogia would only have only four years later in 2013  now if i use recent datas ( 2013 ) that put ossetia at 8,390 $ us higher than georgia ( 7160 ) since i dont have ppp 2013 ( wich is usually higher than usd ) account for growth they are probably already in the 10 000 . 
  but right that still not the double but still quite a bit higher than georgia  and thats only the case of a russian poor region wich beat gerogia . 
  now since 90 % of south ossetians are officially now russian citizens in average a russian citizens have a gdp per capita of 23 000 $ = double of georgia  yet , they 're still shit . 
  no amount of sugarcoating will fix that bla bla bla ** 0 proofs ** and 0 datas i am not even surprise still higher better than georgia  i 'm certain those splendid people who run these wannabe nations will succeed in improving the economical situation . 
  what you bet on ukraine ? 
  as it is ukraine who decide shit lol  nah you see the pro russian oligarchs and even the other will quickly open back the businesses . 
  if i remember well , donesk and most of its industry , sports teams , theathers were under the control of medvedchuk and akhmetov ( the wealthiest man in ukraine ) those are good guys and i seriously thank them    http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/02/12/world/europe/friend-of-putin-assumes-role-of-negotiator-in-ukrainian-conflict.html?_r=0&amp;referer=https://www.google.ca/ https://news.vice.com/article/billionaires-and-bogus-ballots-welcome-to-the-elections-in-eastern-ukraine i meant when i saw the results of the local elections last week i was smiling * but in a sign of the deep and lingering divisions in the country , gennady kernes , a former backer of viktor yanukovich , the russian-backed president who left office following protests in kiev 's maidan square , appears to have won a landslide first-round victory in russian-speaking kharkiv , ukraine 's second-largest city * the kremlin just have to send a signal those guys    and by the way those oligarchs/local guys seems to have giving an higher quality of life/salary than the rest of ukraine provinces before the war . 
  i am sure they know better at least than the rest how to manage shit at least . 
  gosh even the osce * speaking to journalists on tuesday , martin sajdik , who represents the organization for security and co-operation in europe ( osce ) in the group , said the discussion focused on the resumption of water supplies and the tangible progress in efforts to rebuild railways and power transmission lines . 
  he noted , however , that all the projects can only be implemented after demining these areas *  where 's the data showing the level of subsidy ? 
  keep hamstering  that does n't disapprove what the future holds for dpr/lpr . 
  just another region that will rely on russian taxpayer ** fucking hahahahahaha ** germany is doing a fucking good fine job oh and i also thank the eu  money to reach the previous standard of living , which was n't high to begin , or experience a slight increase . 
  you might want to wait for peace wich has just begin one moth ago . 
  i more surprise by the fact that with the fighting their production only decline by 31 % . 
   looking at other regions that gained their `` independence '' in a similar fashion and stand by mother there isnt any other regions . 
  ukraine is officially now bosnia herzegovina . 
  donesk doesnt have independance but autonomy wow you are actually moron and will be back in the rada by june  :0 : o russia just have a veto in ukraine foreign policy now nothing else . 
   russia is rather indicative of what will happen to dpr/lpr . 
  zzz not really haahaha its eu and ukraine problem now . 
  but you know i deeply thank german taxpayers  i also love north stream 2  and kiev new debt deal . 
   the saltyness is real . 
  insulting my credential as usual , losing your shit ( utter crap ) hamstering yet again . 
  and now saying that i am salty after i wrote that you were butthurt hmm hmm you see i use ** buddy ** to belittle you  ** budy ** you bore me, 
   yeah , they will never see that money until elections are held and the russian army and its proxies leave , and when ukraine controls the border , as the ukrainian government has said multiple times . 
  lol http://www.unian.info/economics/1143157-ukraine-to-use-over-eur-50-mln-from-loan-to-rebuild-donbas.html  they will get nothing from ukraine . 
  lol http://www.unian.info/economics/1143157-ukraine-to-use-over-eur-50-mln-from-loan-to-rebuild-donbas.html  so russia will have to pay for it and since it wo n't , it will remain a completely devastated region . 
  lol germany is doing a fine job , 
   you somehow failed to notice this - i do n't remember maidanuts storming cop stations while armed with aks , rpks , rpgs . 
  oh i noticed it this is exactly why i put my link so lets quote  ** `` we 've been told about 500 guns have disappeared from police armories , and no-one knows where they are right now , '' ** said euronews ' victoria ivaskevych in lviv  ** a woman is in critical condition after she was shot in khmelnytsky ** during the storming of a local security service of ukraine office by anti-government maidan protesters . 
  ** a car reportedly drove up to the building and ** opened fire , with six to eight bullets hitting the woman in her chest ** oh shooting at police station , killing people , stormig them + robbing there armory is not the same thing ? 
  here the funny thing they even create their own people council and there own parliament ** yeah buddy like eastern ukraine **  fulfilling the will of society , ** the executive committee of the lviv regional council , the people 's rada , is assuming full responsibility for the fate of the region and its citizens , '' the statement said ** buddy thats the same thing the only differences is that yanukovich didnt send the army . 
   we just have to take a look at abkhazia and south ossetia to see what the future holds for dpr/lpr . 
  dat prosperity 1 ) you might want to check the minsk agreement 2 2 ) they got exactly what they want wich mean almost full autonomy reconstruction will happen according to german and world bank terms . 
  the germans are even cooking the money . 
  3 ) ukraine has no choice considering the vital economic importance of those regions wich account for 20 % of ukraine industrial production . 
  ukraine is deep fuck without them 4 ) they have not the same status as the other breakaway republics 5 ) its ukraine 's industrial heartland wich account for one fifth of the country 's total gross domestic product and they simply have no choice to get them on feet , clunky ukraine wont go nowhere without them you just cant replace 30 % output like that . 
  prior to the start of the region 's war donetsk and luhansk oblasts together produced about 30 percent of ukraine 's exports . 
  hence why buddy http://www.unian.info/economics/1143157-ukraine-to-use-over-eur-50-mln-from-loan-to-rebuild-donbas.html 6 ) abkhazia and south ossetia are basically russian province now , they can move around and still have way more opportunities than a gerogian could ever hope . 
  by the time the war began in 2008 , fully 90 percent of the populations of abkhazia and south ossetia had become russian citizens . 
  by definition socio-economic statistics are difficult and almost impossible to find . 
  most south ossetians do not even live in de facto south ossetia state but have move in the province of north ossetia in russia wich had a gdp per capita of 10 000 $ wich is the double of georgia . 
  while abkhazia is a tourism hotspot wich receive 1 millions visitors per year but there hasnt been any survey since the mid 90s and the datas are mix with those of russian citizens . 
  at the end both provinces infrastructure were rebuilt . 
   were the industrial land of ukraine . 
  quite a few of their industrial facilities were shelled to kingdom come . 
  last i checked , those regions were subsidized regions before the war . 
  there isnt any `` were '' , [ industrial production in those regions only decline by 31 % ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/business/industrial-production-32-percent-down-in-donetsk-region-in-2014-384628.html ) 31 % is something you can up in less than two years assuming the cease fire hold the question is how long will they be back and not all the oblast was under their control . 
  and lol donetsk region was far richer and here the list of ukraine regions by gdp per capita https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ukrainian_subdivisions_by_gdp and the list of ukrainian oblasts and territories by salary https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ukrainian_oblasts_and_territories_by_salary total exports from ukraine in 2012 in usd were 68.8 bn , of which usd 14.1 bn donetsk and usd 4.2 bn luhansk the share of both regions in exports was significantly higher than their respective share in the overall economy . 
  ukraine being a centralized republic wich was never a federal republic the question to fiscal transfer is hard to see . 
   also , nice vote brigading bot you boys got there . 
  i think you are paranoid just stop being butthut . 
   are you in some kind of parallel reality ? 
  there will be no reconstruction http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/germany-to-lend-500-million-euro-for-eastern-ukraine-reconstruction-385099.html https://www.kfw.de/kfw-group/newsroom/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/pressemitteilungen-details_268609.html, 
   assaulting police stations is n't something i 'd say is normal . 
  yeah buddy http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/seizure-of-police-stations-in-lviv-continues-337130.html eastern ukraine did the exact same thing   if their lives are n't normal enough right now , it 's because they are in the center of civil war  that was their choice . 
  it 's not like they 'll get better - being a part of russkiy mir entails poverty and corruption . 
  they 'll still be `` dog shit '' . 
  oh they would still be better off than western ukraine for sure . 
  they have way more autonomy than before and the situation look better in the east since the peace plan seems to hold , they were the industrial land of ukraine and more wealthy if the peace plan hold i expect them to get better assuming also there is a reconstruction boom . 
   actually , the syrian involvement is highly unpopular in russia . 
  yeah i am curious to see those stats, 
   i found it funny when you say china can become like singapore . 
  singapore is a republic , just like the u.s. 
  there is a reason why i picked `` singapore '' and not france or germany thats because singapore is fundamentally an `` unliberal republic '' . 
  the pap virtually controll everything while being efficient .
