  you just dont put 300 billions in poland to expect them to say '' no '' when you are asking for something . 
  wednesday 14 september is truly a date i am willing to see ( virtually the entire migration policy of europe will be in the hand of germany/france ( lets not kidding ourselves on france by the way , they are playing second fiddle ) . 
  in businees meetings , the things some germans use to say on eastern europe and how they view themselves could be a little bit odd and even make me raise an eyebrow . 
  german foreign policy is quite idiosyncratic . 
  i am willing to see more . 
   i do n't know about you , but i 'd rather live in a country where the far right is throwing grenades at the central government if mass civilians death in peaceful protest as a result of those grenades are your thing well be happy . 
   tell me the tale about nazi in ukraine . 
  i dunno dude there isnt any other europeans countries where far right are throwing grenades at policemen and clashing openly with the central governement . 
  i love how americans are taking the world for fool  assad did n't develop syrias economy and security forces do you really believe what you just wrote ? 
  lets not kidding ourselves and please be smart , i am getting tired of to explain the same thing prior to the arab spring the u.s has put sanctions on syria that go back to 1980 and 2003 . 
  the 1980 sanctions were based on a technology ban applying to all goods and equipment containing ten percent or more in american components . 
  these were compounded in 2006 with systemic sanctions against the banking sector , especially the commercial bank of syria under the patriot act . 
  those sanctions cripple assad budget and skyrot unemployement in a country where oil was flowing wich led to the destruction of the social order . 
  while the other gulf states got away . 
  u.s is responsible * thus the sanctions , as a whole , represent a concerted policy package designed , at a minimum , to weaken the regime and reduce its political capacities , and , at a maximum , to open the way for its collapse due to economic damage * from the doha institute http://english.dohainstitute.org/release/a1eeff9a-1022-4e09-aaaf-fb27e7c454a7, 
  from the article * yiannis mouzalas told to vima radio that boats taking refugees to the greek mainland - the start point of a land route to germany through macedonia , serbia and hungary - would soon be using a second port to ease pressure on the island of 85,000 inhabitants *, 
  can you explain me this sudden change of german attitude towards immigrants , i am genuinely curious . 
  even among my germans business friends in business meetings , i saw that shift . 
  my sister is russian but own a business with her german husband in holstein , they plan to send one of their employee to look for refugees in munich . 
  those are people two years ago who would be consider as right wing !, 
  why is there a sudden u-turn . 
  while 1 year ago germany was know to be strict on immigration . 
  can you explain me this sudden change of german attitude towards immigrants , i am genuinely curious . 
  among even my germans business friends in business meetings , i saw that shift . 
  why is there a sudden u-turn , within one summer people have start to put germany in the same basket as sweden !, 
  while 1 year ago germany was know to be strict on immigration . 
   source pretty unreliable , but russia always like to deny loses in war . 
  the sources is quite bad that you admited yourself but you chose to close your eyes and keep pumping . 
  drop fallacies please, 
   so yes , israel has implemented limited sanctions against russia . 
  ** no not really ** i know quite well my second country * the banks are required to scan their credit portfolios in order to check whether they are working with parties subject to sanctions * basically only required to know of the peope they are working with are under sanctions . 
  * they are also required to establish rules for identifying and avoiding new transactions with parties subject to sanctions '' they jut need to identify clients under sanctions and if they want to avoid those parties with who they are working , they need to establish clear rules . 
  * and to define work procedures vis-a-vis the relevant parties * at the end they are still allow to work with those parties its up to them to decide or not . 
  there is simply zero sanctions in israel currentely . 
  no isra\u00ebl hasnt please check properly your article . 
  i know quite well what i am talking since i am a russian jew that would be political suicide in israel to put sanctions on russia . 
  http://www.unian.info/politics/1084506-israel-considers-crimea-to-be-ukrainian-but-wont-join-in-sanctions-against-russia.html http://www.timesofisrael.com/sanctions-propel-israel-russia-to-expand-agriculture-ties/ http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.617088, 
  in your list only japan has put sanctions . 
  not israel nor south korea, 
  you do know it was the same issue with reddit until reddit comply and was unban ? 
  why the complain from western europe , if the one who should get it get asylum and the others are deport ? 
   everyone claims asylum in order to prevent deportation . 
  but only certain groups get it granted . 
  what happen to the others that dont get asylum ? 
   not to mention the provocative `` zapad '' manouavres with russia which scenario includes cracking the rebel of polish minority or nuclear strike on warsaw . 
  sure and nato never do manouevres against us and the baltic states never had exercices where they crush russian minority upprising for example ? 
  as a russian i have a huge doubt on this thread actually . 
   i think we 'd still be that part of the world ahead in terms of being open-minded , tolerant and so on . 
  not really greeks took it form persia under cyrus the great wich was more ahead than greece and roma in terms of rights . 
  http://www.humanrights.com/what-are-human-rights/brief-history/cyrus-cylinder.html the west was rarely ahead from freedom of religion to basic things such as abolishing slavery . 
   yeah , i guess i 'm not as good of a tibla as you . 
  i can taste your salty tears, 
   you think you 're being manly never wrote that and i dont think you know the definitin of `` man up '' wih has nohing to do with the word `` manly '' . 
  there are alot of things you seems to dont know . 
   no we 'll hand it to you next time lil ' putin starts whining about how everyone 's out to get russia lol . 
  you are gloing to wait a long time if ever . 
   seriously go see a doctor , you have some sort of a development disorder or maybe alzheimers . 
  come on , man up a little bit you could have find better insult . 
  estonians are adorable . 
   yeah , i 'm done here . 
  of course  i 've made my case and wo n't continue arguing with someone who is deliberately ignoring or twisting what i say , along with childishly insulting me every step of the way . 
  i insult people or my employees when they are saying something stupid and easy to put down . 
  at that point insult might be the only thing that work on this sub quit fallacies i adress each of your points from a to z. 
   either way the reason i even argue with people like you is not because i want to change your mind since that seems impossible , but because i do n't want your bullshit infecting other peoples minds . 
  oh yeah tell me about ... 
  putting you down and show you were wrong is a hateful concept for people of your ilk more if it come from a russian . 
  you came , i argue you down because your brain seems to lack of knowledge how the kremlin work . 
  go crawl under a rock or as i told you read basic kreminology book . 
  marakenko and monaghan are probably the two only western worth to read . 
  p.s : most russians know how their politics works in each circles . 
  and definitely not a freaking crass latvian, 
  so you are saying that i am a shill or him ? 
   it seems you do n't follow facepalm look i will be slow with you . 
  baltic people seems to be retarded today ( i know that 's usual but come on make an effort ) . 
  so i will debunk one by one . 
  its crack me up seeing impying also to know russian politics better than me   he only mention of gazprom was when / u/tuesias [ 1 ] indicated that the newspaper was sold to gazprom in 2007 it was never sold furthermore komsomolskaya pravda even in the 1990s kp had always its reputation and never hide their view and clearly wrote what they were for . 
   and i never even mentioned it afterwards . 
  bullshit * you stupid western shill !, 
  gazprom-media is a privately owned enterprise !, 
  glory to pu ... wtf is happening ? 
  * lets pass , it is amusing  the main point i was always trying to explain - that the government controls the media house that owns komsomolskaya pravda . 
  that 's the thing your main point is false wich none of your links showed new media holding the media house ** is not owned by the government at all ** . 
   we obviously disagree on the roles gennady timchenko and yury kovalchuk have since you seem to think they 're businessmen that happen to be friends with putin , whereas i agree with the us and eu assessment which place them both in putin 's `` inner circle '' [ putin inner circle is call `` the ozero '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ozero ) ** gennady timochenko is not part of the ozero ** . 
  this is basic kreminology the inner sanctum of putin has less than 8 people . 
  wherea the list of the eu has more than 150 individuals some of them not even close to putin . 
  ** the eu never said it was his inner circle or use the word `` inner circle '' the fuck is that i would be surprise if they do ** http://europa.eu/newsroom/highlights/special-coverage/eu_sanctions/index_en.htm#3 yury kovalchuk is part of the `` ozero '' bu he is an exeption since he owned the biggest bank of russia and made his fortune ** before putin was even mayor and was still a youngster colonel and was a no name ) ** . 
  kovalchuk back yetlsin before in fact he back united russia since its inception . 
  calling him putin personal banker is a stretch [ similar how some of the biggest banks in the u.s like goldman sachs are backing the democratic party with the biggest donations to their pacs ] ( http://www.cnn.com/2010/politics/04/20/obama.goldman.donations/ ) . 
  it is funny how every single treasury of states of the u.s government under a democratic government came always from that bank . 
  [ time warners excutives were also the biggest contributors to obama campaign ] ( http://thehill.com/policy/technology/198350-comcast-time-warner-execs-have-been-big-obama-supporters ) kovalchuk owned medias even before putin was president . 
  as for his opinion on putin he said himself quite a lot of time in front of the media and the press he is quite open as he said `` he saw that guy and throw him his money and back his potential ; '' this well known in russia . 
   there is a reason these two were part of the sanctioned list . 
  are you dumb the eu put the biggest russian politicans and more than 150 people in russia on a bullshit list . 
  as shown you the list is not the inner sanctum of putin in fact less than 2 % of the list his are in his * inner sanctum * . 
  gennady timochenko is not part of the ozero and definitely out if it considering his past . 
   the links your provided with supposedly similar examples from uk and the us are on a completely different scale than what we 're talking about here , the first link talks about five previously unknown meetings between murdoch and cameron [ yeah that 's why its own party find that he was too close to murdoch right ??? 
  and getting access to high level security meeting ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-too-close-to-rupert-murdoch-say-constituents-7729175.html ) strangely all the newspapers of that guy back the conservative pary in uk and in australia since 1970 ? 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/15/world/europe/cameron-to-testify-over-murdoch-links-at-british-press-inquiry.html http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rupert-murdoch-gives-david-camerons-new-cabinet-his-stamp-of-approval-10246889.html  and the second link even explicitly says that the lobbying attempt failed . 
  bullshit for proof plus cnn or any media own by time warner are well know to be democrcats mouthpiece . 
  including the genereous advantages they had under clinton administration and the fact that those companies almost became oligopole without government interference .
