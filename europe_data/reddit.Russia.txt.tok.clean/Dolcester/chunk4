   i mean , it 's not even comparable . 
  yes they are  you will always assume and defend the two mentioned above as simple putin 's friends who just happen to be two of the most influential men quite a stretch and false to call those men the most influential men in russia . 
  did you ever read about russia or any proper kreminology book or are you sucking mashable links ??? . 
   whereas i will always insist on them playing a much larger role . 
  and that was not the conversation . 
  you are deflecting . 
   a government mouthpiece is n't bias , it 's a propaganda channel . 
  a bias is a preference which assumes a choice . 
  you do n't have a choice . 
  there is no point in arguing with you . 
  preaching satanism to the pope would be easier . 
  kp since the end of the wall never hide its view most russians if not all knows it and the editorial have always acknowledge it quite openly . 
  similar that the economist never hide that they were liberals and openly call it `` bias '' . 
   oh yeah sure , russia comes here , commits atrocities , tries to punish us for not licking it 's boot and suddenly we are the ones picking fights . 
  shut it and put the violon back in his closet . 
  i am putting down a german and one guy came with a made up bullshit about '' governement owned '' . 
  quit fallacies  no we just want you to not be a manipulative asshole all the time , is that too much to ask for ? 
  where , when , what who . 
  what does that have to do with the conversation or me ? 
   no , the entire conversation started with how funny this russian government lie is . 
  bullshit http://www.businessinsider.com.au/cnn-aviation-expert-theory-on-mh370-2015-2 you are unable to read ( i am not even surprise ) learn to make the difference between a government and a ragtag . 
  otherwise i have full access to call the dumbshit cnn and fox wrote as america government own words . 
   it seems you got a bit confused . 
  oh you wish !!!, 
  this entire conversation is changing and no more focus on my original point.its seems to be in the dna of baltics people . 
  so lets see `` no mention `` of gazprom ( a point two nuts including you brought and you entire explanation end by concluding that they are ** not own by the governement ** wich was the original conversation and saying only that the owners are close friend with putin ( thats another fallacy but lets pass ) . 
  [ a point that i already acknowledge on the same thread with another guy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3gu82o/z/cu1q12n ) you are naive enough to think that it isnt the case pretty much anywhere . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/leveson-inquiry/9227491/david-camerons-five-secret-meetings-with-rupert-murdoch.html http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-23/comcast-finds-golf-and-128-lobbyists-can-t-sell-u-s-on-merger stop embarassing yourself . 
   so you are shocked that journalists are killed ? 
  in what world do you live ? 
  western desilusion in a nutshell `` thinking their view are the world '' i never said that i was not schocked . 
   and you are shocked that putin is a main suspect behind a lot of high profile killings ? 
  ** putin was never the main suspect ** even liberal russians media acknowledge it ( only the moscow times that was delusionnal ) ** putin simply dont take journalists ** hashtag stop westernpropaganda  and there 's free press ? 
  do n't make me laugh . 
  never said it , 30 % of russian got their news from independant sources the numbers rise to 60 % in big cities according to the levada center . 
  you are changing the subject its funny its always eastern european people that want to start fight as you imply to know my country go crawl under a rock . 
  lets debunk you the entire conversation was to know ** if it was own by the governement wich is not ** now you are changing the goal post of course it is pro putin same as fox news is pro republicans and msnbc pro democrats or some newspapers in uk are pro conservative or bild is backing merkel and always shitting on the greeks . 
  are you delusionnal enough to think that bias doesnt exist ? 
  give me a break * death threats , journalists being killed . 
  and you call that fake ? 
  how stupid are you ?!, 
  * so putin kill now ? 
  putin dont take little wannabe journalist but big fish oligarchs . 
  this is schokingly not knowing how russia inner sanctum and how the ozeros works . 
  dont worry i know my country quite well go shot !!, 
  i am here throw your westerns nonsenses so i will debunk it asap , i might save a soul in the process . 
  sorry if i look like that but this sub sometimes is a lost case, 
   well you know that pretty much any news agency that does n't follow putins stories are bullied and threatened to stop working ? 
  you people are walking joke how does sucking propaganda taste ??? 
  what is the moscow times and novaya gazeta still doing in russia or vedomanti ??? 
  i am talking on the press . 
  oh here the downvotes quick let silence him . 
  people on this sub are the dumbest westerners you can come across is it in your dna ? 
  oh my god here the bbc link 2008 more earlier than your 2006 link  ** russian energy group yesn ( private ) emerged as the newspaper 's largest shareholder in 2007 , buying up stock from the prof-media holding company and the norwegian media group a-pressen ** http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4315129.stm but that doesnt stop here ** now today ** and here a bloomberg profile http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/people.asp?privcapid=26813613 the primary member of the board is ** the baltic media group a company base in estonian ** wich in turn is own by schibsted asa ( the biggest media group in norway ) a norwegian company god you people are embarassing . 
  : / u/ro4ers are you retarded ? 
   private individuals that happen to be friends with putin ? 
  are you dumb ? 
  [ so no media owners in the west are firend with politicians ??? 
  ] ( http://thehill.com/policy/technology/198350-comcast-time-warner-execs-have-been-big-obama-supporters ) murdoch is friend with putin now ? 
  owner of novaya gazeta or moscow times are putin friend ? 
   isnt all the press in russia owned and run by the government ? 
  western disinformation went far you seriously did believe that ? 
  no they are media that are owned by private individuals . 
  major russian newspapers with foreign owners include the vedomosti andsmartmoney owned by rupert murdoch ` es thenews corp for example * komsomolskaya pravda * is not own by the russian governement that german guy looks like a crass idiot, 
   russian government again working hard to make russia the laughing stock of the world . 
  since when * komsomolskaya pravda * is own by the russian governement ? 
  this sub look dumber more the day pass . 
  you should take mrs winslow 's soothing syrup, 
  they want to ban reddit , and that 's the excuse to do it . 
  my isp only blocked the page with the mushrooms thing . 
  the rest of reddit is working perfectly fine . 
  this is not putin and the illuminati . 
  probably number 2 they did something similar with facebook . 
   now you switched from share of ** manufacturing ** to share of ** industry ** . 
  oil and gas extraction is recorded as industry . 
  bubbah boy is that really hard for you to check facts ??? 
  never switch the share of manufacturing is still talk right after talking the share of industry ( the part of the message you dodge ) are you dumb ? 
  industry is ** 40 % ** of the output mining ( wich include oil and gaz extraction ) is ** 11 % **  have you really no shame ? 
  you are spending a considerable effort at just plainly lying in the internet . 
  is this the life your mom wanted for you ? 
  lying where ? 
  hahaha and of course you dodge the last part of my reply . 
  putting you down is easy . 
   is this the life your mom wanted for you ? 
  [ look you have to drop fallacy ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/maternal_insult ), 
   when a banana republic exports 100 million tonnes of bananas and one $ 10 electronic gadget then their high tech export is 100 % of their manufactured exports . 
  in that case we look the share of industry in russia wich is higher than poland . 
   russia exported $ 8.6 b worth of high-tech in 2013 . 
  that is a tiny amount . 
  wich is higher than australia isra\u00ebl is known to be as startup nation but its share of exports is tiny like also brazil ( embraer ) wich produce its own plane are cloud by their commodities exports . 
  as for poland ** p.s : ** the high tech sector in poland is drive by foreign companies wich are ** 56 % of the exports ** in that sector alone . 
  this is why countries like vietnam are able to be higher than italy or sweden !!, 
   cut your bullshit . 
  are you retarded ? 
  ** please bubbah boy % of manufacturial output is the real datas **  that is lower than poland 's and only 6.6 times higher than estonia 's although russia 's population is 106 times higher than estonia 's . 
  and an higher share than poland and estonia as a percentage of its exports . 
  while both dont have the same currency and not the value when covert to us$ . 
  get over it % of manufacturial output . 
   the issue here is that russia does not manufacture things . 
  the share of industry in russia is higher than poland .
