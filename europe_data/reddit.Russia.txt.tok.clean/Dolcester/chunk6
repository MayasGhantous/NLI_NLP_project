  percentage of people living under un international poverty line equatorial guinea : ** 76,8 % ** russia : ** 15,9 % ** ( lower than the eu average ) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_percentage_of_population_living_in_poverty i will also note that you dodge the other countries i gave . 
   eu has been tremendously good for poland , but due to other things and not direct payments starting in the middle of 2004 . 
  poland before 2004 has been the third biggest aid recipients of money in the world just after china and egypt [ while being back by the eu as early as 1999 ] ( https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/archives/pdf/key_documents/2000/pl_en.pdf&amp;ved=0cb8qfjabahukewjuuc67457hahukxr4khtfubu8&amp;usg=afqjcngakirndfg3ai9a3d-d77weqmflla&amp;sig2=jvy8kyyvzg7pou-abc1lqg )  [ ** from 1990 to 2000 poland received a bucket-load of aid -- more than any other country ** , in fact , except egypt , india and china [ see first chart ] . 
  there was plenty of debt relief , reducing poland 's external-debt-to-gdp ratio from 83 % in 1990 to 56 % a few years later . 
  all this was tied to strong reforms , like putting the economy in private hands ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/05/ukraine#b8ocjs9z4epujudk.99 ), 
  sure thats why nigeria , equatorial guinea and angola who had oil 20 years before russia are ridding this oil price right and their population improve am i right ??? 
  or maybe leadership and how you manage ressources has also a factor ? 
  thus given credit to the leadership . 
  oh yes south ossetians always want to be part of georgia am i right https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgian%e2%80%93ossetian_conflict_ ( 1918 % e2 % 80 % 9320 ) you crush them the first time and force your language down their throat ( i will admit with the help of ussr ) and expect them to still want to be with you ? 
  georgia completeley act like a dick with them they have a long history of resisting to georgian rule . 
  you were never multi ethnic when two groups were constantly opress and have a history of upprising . 
    no , it 's not , unless you plan to go to war with the rest of the world . 
  please check your facts and stop throwing fallacies . 
  yes protectionism is good when it is not apply to the extreme ( autarky ) asian nations didnt grow up by opening their legs wide to the free market some of their sectors were heavily protected at each stages of their growth . 
   i 've yet to see a single economist to claim that trade and specialisation you must have not read alot, 
  they are countries inside nato that we dont hate ( altough i dont understand why the word would be `` hate '' ) . 
  the romanian guy is exaggerating . 
  people dont talk about romania in russia , its not love nor hate . 
  funny you keep comparing to russia ( i tought we were dictatorship ) but you are not able to show eu or u.s examples who the hell ask you about t.v channels ? 
  are you intelligent enough to write something without fallacies ? 
   nobody banned songs , only propagand fucking bullshit and i quote  ukraine has named 14 russian singers and actors , including french-born gerard depardieu , ** whose work will be banned from tv , radio and cinemas ** now tell me how depardieu work and previous movies are propaganda ? 
  thats a reason to ban all the movies and song they did ? 
  there is no similar example in the eu or the u.s by the way . 
  [ you mean things like that ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/10/toronto-orchestra-cancels-ukraine-pianist-valentina-lisitsa-concert ) both are not the same situation they are not ban to enter the country and those are private events ( unlike the case of ukraine ) ukraine on the other hand is nitpicking and banning artists from entering on the spot for 5 years . 
  its funny you call my country a dictatorship but you use one of their example as an excuse for what ukraine just did . 
  and thats the reason to ban him ??? 
  its funny how the sbu dodge huge hollywood actors like steven seagal, 
  quit smoking, 
   as far as i know , about 1 million uzbeks ( or other muslims ) live in moscow . 
  so let just them declare the independent north uzbekistan in the territory of moscow and let them go ? 
  would you accept nope because south ossetia were always the majority . 
  wow troll are working hard . 
  south ossetians didnt like georgia they launch a war in 1917 for liberation simply . 
   south ossetia was created only in 1922 during the soviet era after independent georgia was invaded . 
  what a sweet lie https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgian%e2%80%93ossetian_conflict_ ( 1918 % e2 % 80 % 9320 ), 
  you wish, 
  the propaganda machine is open since at least 4 years . 
  more intense since the last 6 months . 
   i think it 's more about russia losing its biggest oil export market in an oversupplied world economy . 
  i never talk about `` self sufficiency '' we still buy food from latin america and asia . 
  there is no point in arguing with you you look nuts, 
  the point is rather distasteful . 
  according to the ocde russia doesnt have a reputation to fake its own economic datas unlike maybe the chinese . 
  second the ussr was communist . 
  there is not one state producer of meat currentely in russia . 
  but at least a thousand private local producers . 
   are sticking it to putin and his pointless sanctions '' bullshit http://mobile.globalmeatnews.com/industry-markets/russia-increases-meat-production-thanks-to-food-embargo, 
  . . there s something writting on the sticker ... 
  too late they are high on their own propaganda . 
  they are deep inside it and that was not the first time and that will keep going for a long time russia is seriously on a good path with those embargo see http://mobile.globalmeatnews.com/industry-markets/russia-increases-meat-production-thanks-to-food-embargo you see how they didnt even bother to show the positive things le the fact we still have a lower hunger index than some european countries . 
  god maybe bad but since at least 3-4 months , my patriotism went high . 
   was the question is whether it will continue to be . 
  yea right ... [ china medical devices restriction ] ( http://www.plasticstoday.com/articles/china-russia-build-new-barriers-foreign-medical-device-manufacturers-140916 ) [ japan medical devices restrictions ] ( http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docid=ft5489n9wd;chunk.id=d0e5957;doc.view=print ) interesting the japanese had a `` buy japanese programs '' since 1970 up until today , they grew up to dominate the field and became net producer . 
  [ south korea medical devices ] ( http://www.pacificbridgemedical.com/publication/regulatory-changes-in-the-south-korean-medical-market-medical-devices-and-pharmaceuticals/ ) wich will only be liberalize in 1999 and was one of th harshest in the world [ taiwan medical devices protecttionism ] ( http://www.amcham.com.tw/topics-archive/topics-archive-2012/vol-42-no-10/3779-industry-focus-a-report-on-the-medical-device-industry ) [ while taiwan as agressive subsitution import on hight tech since the day of the kmt ] ( http://www.cepal.org/publicaciones/xml/5/20905/lcg2220iamsdem.pdf ) note : ctrl + f asuming we do this ludicrous correlation with infanrt mortality ( the most idiot point ) . 
  we can use google datas to see the performance of asian tigers + china over the years ( note that i put china because russian restrictions are basically a copy paste and both are similar ) [ google datas graph ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z6409butolt8la_&amp;ctype=l&amp;met_y=im#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=im&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=country:kor:chn&amp;idim=country_group:asian+tigers&amp;ifdim=world&amp;tstart=1123300800000&amp;tend=1312603200000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) [ world bank datas for numbers between 1960 up until 2005 ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.dyn.imrt.in ) a constant fall ( note yhat south korea began its protectionist policies under park chung hee around 1970 ) . 
   having the best available incubators therefore reduces infant natality . 
  bullshit  but government apparently is n't interested in having the best available incubators . 
  that 's also a fallacy by the way  sources ? 
  that 's not at all what my stats show !, 
  your world bank datas are from 2013 , i expect an update at the end of this year . 
  i use the most recent datas ( 2014 ) http://www.indexmundi.com/map/?v=29 thats the most recent i had under my hand base on estimation . 
   and what 's wrong with thinking of the children ? 
  or the adults , for that matter ? 
  more fallacies you seriously love that point with children dont you ? 
  thinking of the children is fallacy , its an appeal to emotions , it supplant emotion and reason more importantly it is back by nothing . 
   you have a government that literally cares more about a few cronies ( the people directly affected by eu sanctions ) funny the eu line is that `` they do not target the population but the elites '' . 
  putin is doing a fine job  using bold letters wo n't make your point valid , you know that is why i use stats and historical datas while looking at countries with similar legislation . 
   and that will have an impact in public health , trust me . 
  yeah right ( no sources or datas ... )  what i 'm not so sure , however , is that it will always be the best equipment for the money . 
  well russia medical device industry export has grown by an average of 7 % during the last years , that should show their performance . 
  while the pharmaceutical industry is the fastest growing industry in our country and in the world with an annual growth of 10 % so much that we are in line to be in the top 3 by 2020 we are already in the top 10 !!!, 
  yeah protectionism , interesting , putin took also that idea from south korea according to some governeement officials . 
  [ its part of the 2020 industrialization plan ] ( https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/deloitte/ru/documents/life-sciences-health-care/russia-pharmaceutical-industry-2014.pdf&amp;ved=0cbsqfjaaahukewjll7crljxhahxcnj4khyenahw&amp;usg=afqjcnfn4gvzbnqeoagrv2ozremwkhqsjq&amp;sig2=k_6ntkj-maxifnposux8ja ) by the way we jump by an average of 6 places by year in the doing business index even this year we jump  actually , it 's pretty normal to import a large percentage of some categories of goods where other countries have competitive advantages , just like it 's normal to export to many other countries goods and services where you have competitive advantages . 
  you forgot the part of the theory where a country can build its competive advantage or improve i. 
  if we go further in ricardo theory , otherwise africa would be stock to sell bananas and china an obedient country selling rice . 
   but protectionism does n't help you compete . 
  this point is a complete nonsense never wrote full proctectionism but restriction  and one which you should consider before taking a biased reading of japan 's or korea 's economic history . 
  considering that i have a bacground in developement economics this is hilarious . 
   now you must be kidding not at all , i debunk and debunk constantly people on that point . 
  the wb is predicting growth by the way . 
  russia is under the sanctions from the biggest world economies and with oil at 50 ( two years ago that would be impossible ) . 
  but manage to reduce inflation , wages are risen , will still have a recession like australia , brazil , canada maybe less has keep one of the lowest unemployement in europe and one of the lowest poverty rate and even assuming it is under sanctions is still predict to growth next year . 
  anyway i am tired here a copy paste https://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/3d14x0/kiev_brainwashing_ukrainian_people_as_economy/ct10qar, 
   source ? 
  the original report indicated that this applied to * all * countries outside the `` eurasian economic area '' . 
  i 'm sure you 'll get great mri scanners from kazakhstan . 
  true for the first part but seems you didtn read the law   medical device market has a huge share in asia for example toshiba . 
  good thing japan is not the only country in asia . 
    and no and no and no babies is going to die . 
   [ babies die all the time , not only in russia , but also in the eu and elsewhere ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.dyn.imrt.in ) infant mortality was on a downard trend . 
  you are quoting stats out of context wich in itself his a fallacy . 
  i love how you put romania and bulgaria while russia has a lower infant rate than latvia and equal almost to estonia this argument is a blatant '' think of the children ''  but incubators were only an example . 
  the real money is made on consumables such as bandages , and i 'm pretty sure that increasing their cost to hospitals will have an impact on public health . 
  ** and i am pretty sure they wont ** this point is so laughable russia has around 1,200 manufacturers engaged in medical device production . 
  around 12,000 types of medical device are manufactured locally , including modern digital low dose x-ray apparatus , patient monitors , electrocardiographs , operating tables , hospital beds and medical . 
   resolution no . 
  102 obliges state and municipal authorities in russia , when performing procurements , to reject all bids containing a proposal to supply foreign-made products included in the list ** if such productsare not produced ** in belarus , armenia and kazakhstan , provided that at least two bids were filed for participation in the tender that meet the requirements of the procurement documentation , which * . 
   an exporter is just as dependent of its buyers as an importer is of its suppliers . 
  but that doesnt mean you still need to be an importer and not improve . 
  we are a talking about strenghten the internal production and being less dependant .
