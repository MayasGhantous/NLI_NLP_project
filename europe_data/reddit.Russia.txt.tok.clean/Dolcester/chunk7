  an exporter has a huge range of buyers more when the developping world is growing . 
  its not normal that a country depend 80 % of its imports and need to make step to compete . 
  similar to what south korea did in the 80s and japan in the 70s . 
   russia is a good case study indeed : look at what the lower price for your main export products , gas and oil , is doing to your economy . 
  good thing the economy is on a good path . 
   truly , the west loved you dearly before crimea , not true and laughable  so youre just buying the entrenchment propaganda from your authorities , thats all first i dont know what that mean '' i am buying '' or how do you know what i am buying ? . 
  and i was raise in canada while having the russian citizenship and working in asia right now . 
  so i have seen many `` autorities '' by the way propaganda is universal , the fact that you manage to wrote this reply is a perfect example of it . 
  yeah nobody call someone that put sanction on you , `` friendly '' thats the reality, 
  in that case he was not promote but demote and remove . 
  yes they are rather easy to produce and 20 % already come domestically . 
  i already told you those are `` limitations '' wich apply primarily and only to the eu while dodging other countries . 
  medical device market has a huge share in asia for example toshiba . 
  being forever dependant on countries hostile to you is never good . 
  countries need to move from being next importer , to net exporter and consumer simply . 
  and no and no and no babies is going to die . 
  this is not south sudan or a tribal tribe in amazonia . 
  no baby is going to die ... what are you talking about ?? 
  now the conversation is no more on condom . 
  look carefully your sources  banning the import of medical equipment seems stupid enough , do n't you think ? 
  where do you see the word `` ban '' ? 
  the governement is `` limiting '' not banning . 
  because 80 % of medical devices depend on foreign trade . 
  if one thing this governement is learning right now is to become less dependant from the west . 
  i will also note that the limitation do not concern asia , south america but only nations who put sanctions . 
  they apply primarily and first to strenghten russia domestic production , from what i read it similar to what some asian nations did . 
  russia is using some sanctions as an excuse to bypass the world trade organization ( in favor of its own producers ) for example http://www.euractiv.com/sections/social-europe-jobs/poland-wants-eu-complain-wto-over-russian-embargo-307859 http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2013/06/25/russias-wto-entry-one-year-on-business-is-disappointed/, 
   the restriction do not concern condom at all and have never been brought by the administration . 
  * the initiative has not been discussed in the russia administration yet . 
  putin 's spokesman dmitry peskov said that the kremlin did not discuss the possibility to refuse from foreign-made condoms * http://english.pravda.ru/news/russia/05-08-2015/131583-russia_sanctions_condoms-0/#sthash.divvyjqn.dpuf, 
  yeah that guy ( onishchenko ) was remove from his job in 2013 and give a new job where he would have no more power . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24651955 as for this article its cheap propaganda ( why there is even an `` s '' at official ) but this sub love to eat it those kind of things . 
   the fund estimated the immediate effect of sanctions and counter-sanctions had been to wipe between 1 and 1.5 percent off gdp , ** rising to 9 percent ** over the next few years ** these ** model-driven results were subject to significant uncertainty , it cautioned ** 9 % loss ** over the next few years ** , not in one year , ( but even with that there will still be positive gdp growth ) and their prediction would happen only and depend if the sanctions are still in place ( what the imf label as `` uncertainty '' ) . 
  [ dont think they will be around in the rest of 2016 ,2017 , 2018 , and 2019 ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-extends-economic-sanctions-on-russia-until-end-of-january-1434960823 ) the imf report is more than what this article is trying to show . 
  look carefully at op comments history . 
  you are waisting your time . 
  a `` french guy '' posting nonsenses and stereotypes that some of them i dont even know where they came from . 
  this sub reach a new low . 
  i wouldnt take this map seriously, 
  we dont have an extradition treaty with lithuania and didnt have one in 1991 . 
  when signing up to the european convention on extradition in 1996 , russia granted itself an exemption in accordance with article 61 of the state 's constitution , which says : `` a russian citizen can not be sent beyond the borders of the russian federation or given to another state '' . 
  lets cut sophistries and i will sum up your position and answer by a yes or no ** foreign ** organization engaging in political activities inside a country should be free/entitled to hide their funding ( despite well know cases where they are doing more ) is that what you are saying ? 
   that sounds just a wee bit paranoid . 
  not when you beging to see a common pattern . 
  democratic state like india had to crack on them since they were interfering 2 years ago https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/indias-crackdown-on-ngos-receiving-foreign-funding-prompts-us-criticism/2015/05/06/f65ec68a-f3f2-11e4-bca5-21b51bbdf93e_story.html or south korea there is nothing wrong in forcing an organisation to disclose its funding from a to z. 
  well he had tuberculosis his best books where written in russia . 
  plus he is the perfect example of socialism realism . 
   put it this way : name examples of modern russian culture ( say 20th century and on ) that were not authored by dissidents who had to leave the country , or who were otherwise repressed . 
  maxim gorky was one, 
  yes i saw it t and still propaganda wich is hilarious . 
  see from your own link http://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dhqvt/eu_warning_over_russia_land_grab_in_south_ossetia/ct58yn0, 
   which the eu later debunked as nonsense which whitewashed history . 
  ** it never happen ** now you are waisting my time , game over, 
  yeah more made up bullshit https://euobserver.com/foreign/28747 by the way those are the words of the eu independant commission , 
  made up bullshit from you nice  the eu report is here no matter how brainless you are  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8281990.stm now walk away, 
   discussion ended . 
  it 's obvious who 's here for spreading propaganda . 
  not able to refute , clunky argument , sophistries , lets not forget slow ( typial georgians ) what are going to eat ** your tie ** now , 
  already debunk now lets end this discussion fast because you seems you dont know how it work at all ? 
  you are really cute when you want ( the shame ) https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3d3a9j/russia_advances_2km_into_georgian_territory_a/ct1waot https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3d4t8m/creeping_occupation_russia_advances_2km_into/ct2h7vd?context=3, 
   that 's all you 've got ? 
  oh come one i dont even know why you are making this discussion ? 
  the previous guy asked who attact first and i answered georgia wich is true even according to the eu . 
  i dont know what point you are trying to make . 
   georgia moved in troops . 
  a lot of troops . 
  ** wich was not proportionate ** according to the eu . 
  ** and despite that russia warned georgia that it would intevene if georgia launch an invasion . 
  **  guy , who was later fired for incompetence said it was okay for russians to do whatever on account of the russian info he got . 
  he dare to see the situation  russians respond by invading georgia and occupying georgian territory . 
  ** despite being warned previously **  coincidentally , it blocks georgia from nato membership you cant enter nato with an open conflict wich georgia had since 1989 . 
  anuway their president was throw out of office and was a massive incompetent  it blocks a vital pipe-line from asia to eu . 
  ** not true **  at this point , you 're not worth my time . 
  this rat has better things to do . 
  you open the discussion feel free to walk away , i wont hold you , 
  let reiterate the situation georgia attact georgia answer was disproportionate while before the war russia has already warned that it would intervene if georgia launched an invasion but they still did it  oh by the way the south east europe pipeline was propose in 2011 as for trans-caspian gas pipeline it coudnlt have an impact on the war . 
  more nonsense from you, 
   good that you pointed it out . 
  i 'm actually on the fence ( har , har ) on this , but you do a good job of spreading badwill . 
  most russians have left this sub so i am here to look with my own eyes how far it can go . 
  every people that show how the story is false got downvotes . 
  last thing by the way you should check op comment history . 
  lol ** your article is from 20 may 2015 ** the author even wrote that the barri\u00e8re was built 3 years ago . 
  this sub is hilarious completeley amateurish , 
  and you are right here an explanation that back you more https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3d3a9j/russia_advances_2km_into_georgian_territory_a/ct1waot, 
  yes it is propaganda and lie furthermore https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3d3a9j/russia_advances_2km_into_georgian_territory_a/ct1waot this sub is a walking joke , questionning get you downvotes, 
  last thing apparently ** it was errect in 2013 ** i was fucking right , now look the downvotes  https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3d3a9j/russia_advances_2km_into_georgian_territory_a/ct1waot https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3d3a9j/russia_advances_2km_into_georgian_territory_a/ct1ouv6 oh last thing look at the comment history of the guy who posted it https://www.reddit.com/user/maltybeverage#page=1 propaganda , 
  i know babe  this is not all http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8281990.stm  a european union investigation ** claimed that `` open hostilities '' began with a large-scale georgian military operation against tskhinvali ** a report by the osce and i quote  a former senior organization for security and co-operation in europe ( osce ) official , ryan grist , who was in charge of unarmed monitors in south ossetia at war 's start , [ 68 ] told the bbc in november 2008 that he had been warning of georgia 's military activity before its move into the south ossetia region , saying there was a `` severe escalation '' and that this `` would give the russian federation any excuse it needed in terms of trying to support its own troops . 
  '' [ 69 ]  according to grist , it was georgia that launched the first military strikes against tskhinvali . 
  `` it was clear to me that the [ georgian ] attack was completely indiscriminate and disproportionate to any , if indeed there had been any , provocation , '' he said . 
  `` the attack was clearly , in my mind , an indiscriminate attack on the town , as a town . '', 
   i did a tineye search and did n't find any results . 
  what search engine did you use ? 
  here the same image different context that does not match the description of the article http://www.mfa.gov.ge/news/%e1%83%98%e1%83%a0%e1%83%90%e1%83%9a%e1%83%90%e1%83%9c%e1%83%93%e1%83%98%e1%83%94%e1%83%9a%e1%83%98-%e1%83%9e%e1%83%90%e1%83%a0%e1%83%9a%e1%83%90%e1%83%9b%e1%83%94%e1%83%9c%e1%83%a2%e1%83%90%e1%83%a0%e1%83%94%e1%83%91%e1%83%98-%e1%83%a1%e1%83%90%e1%83%9d%e1%83%99%e1%83%a3%e1%83%9e%e1%83%90%e1%83%aa%e1%83%98%e1%83%9d-%e1%83%ae%e1%83%90%e1%83%96%e1%83%a1-%e1%83%94%e1%83%ac%e1%83%95%e1%83%98%e1%83%95%e1%83%9c%e1%83%94.aspx?lang=en-us  it 's certainly being highlighted by sources critical of the kremlin , but i do n't see how that indicates that it would be false . 
  first only one media and it is the moscow times . 
  second please read the link i gave , the ministry of georgia does not cite any number of km my entire explnation is on my link  it is true that waiting for major western sources to look into it and verify it would make sense . 
  it has been now 3 days ...  err ... what yes proaganda , i have see worse than that but it is a joke anyway that story is a basket case of sheep mind . 
   it 's really funny to me seeing how it 's super-hard to process for your russian brain that two guys can kiss and the world not explode . 
  oh come one !!, 
  was that really necessary ?
