  have you read my comment history ? 
  when did i wrote that ? 
  i just told you that one video is far from representing a country . 
  haahhaha ad hominem nice  you are pathetic . 
  math turns against you and you tell me `` to drop that math '' ? 
  that is the weakest , most desperate argument wich math ?? 
  again do you have ** year on year ** datas for moscow ? 
    almost got close to the 1.43 attacks a day from moscow . 
  but not quite . 
  i told you to drop the math  aside for two none of them would be charge or would not be considered under the law  plus two aggressions , plus threats , plus generic non-slur insults . 
  hence my number : 10 attacks . 
  it 's lower than it should , but it 's nice and round . 
  2 agressions might hold but i will say only since walking on someone is hardly one and hard to distinguish but let see ** 0 threaths **  plus generic non-slur insults . 
  so they are not slur nor insults , and again the word gay is not an insult  hence my number : 10 attacks . 
  it 's lower than it should , but it 's nice and round . 
  wich are not attact ( huh huh jewish videos , calling someone `` jew '' huh huh huh  and i quote * in the jew video there was nothing outrageous some simpy call them jew * this is hilarious  it doesnt help that the number are out of your asses   all other data ( and anecdotal evidence ) seem to give the same results . 
  therefore the sample is representative . 
  two datas sets completely different , one year-to-year and the other 10 hours . 
  those datas are simpy not valid , did you pass basic maths ? 
  i work in fincance , i cant take gdp growth per year and compare it with gdp growth per month by making an extrapolation with gdp per month , i would be fired . 
  drop the math   what happens when two gay people kiss ? 
  when , you get two kissing people !, 
  no one is getting hurt . 
  you do realize that in many countries gay people can marry and have/adopt children right ? 
  this is not what i see with my anecdotal links but your anecdotal videos is anecdotal . 
  you mean that same missisipi ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55bfsuxiuxa and again more anecdotal videos  yes , that is what happens in russia , more sophistries , now clunky generealization   like plane crash ( incidentally , also russia 's speciality ) . 
  more sophistries that doesnt even add with real numbers this is hilarious  yes from 474 cases per year to maybe 480 . 
  and i dont give a crap about , the point still stand ** they are on the rise ** , 
  by the way internationnal times is using the moscow times ( wich in turn use as a source , a dubious no name georgian source . ), 
  by the way the moscow times is extremly biased even among liberal russians who prefer to use russia direct or russia beyong the headlines . 
  i have already adress that in this link as for democracy ad freedon watch i already adress those points see further below it doesnt help that the date and the description of the pcture they use in their article does not match at all when i do a simple reverse search https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3d4t8m/creeping_occupation_russia_advances_2km_into/ct28eg0?context=3 get over it , it is obvious kindergarden propaganda s ** cking it was good  that sub is hilarious, 
  well this is funny   do you even read ?? 
  again , thanks for giving me the links to disprove you !, 
  you are awesome !, 
  and again saying `` bitches '' is not hate speech so let see and i quote  in law , hate speech is any speech , gesture or conduct , writing , or display which is forbidden because ** it may incite violence or prejudicial action against or by a protected individual ** or group or because it disparages or intimidates a protected individual or group . 
  say the word `` bitch '' does not incite violence or hate in fact in the video they are none ** at that ** , in fact they are nothinh that incite violence . 
   let 's . 
  careful , i 'm going to use math and again false , your stats does not account for the percentage of people that are lgbt in moscow and still base only on one sample and still dont have a ** year on year ** data for moscow , those stats might have been the only attact in one year  ( that is an exageration but the point stay ) . 
  it doesnt help that they are less than ** 3 homophobic slurs ** in the entire video , i mean they are subtitle !!, 
  saying the word `` gay '' is not a slur by the way nor hate speech and you wouldnt be charge  in western countries , two gays kiss : and again more nonsensical drivel , i asked you what happen when two gay poeple kiss not what happen to their perpetrators i dont care nor does that seems to have an impact . 
  so let see and i wil repeat  two gay people kiss in western countries = discrimination , insult , attact but it doesnt stop here even with punishement , homophobic attact is still on the rise , 
   if they want to send in troops and build extermination camps yeah . . that excuse didnt hold with nazi germany and serbia where are suddenly your `` western value ''   care to provide a source ? 
  so people are asking while they are upvoting nonsenses ? 
  anyway here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/responsibility_for_the_russo-georgian_war, 
   lol . 
  saying `` come over you gay '' after you just shoulder-rammed him is threat here and in china . 
  who care about china , getting another children is also forbidden . 
   lol . 
  maybe in russia . 
  in the civilized world it 's an insult and hate speech if directed to a gay man or a woman . 
  and no whatever the definition of `` civilized word '' mean wich doesnt exist by the way https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech  as said , i use yours . 
  your own data is so bad that can be easily used against you . 
  wich you have not been able , i mean cant even do proper maths  have n't seen a rebuttal . 
  therefore , it holds . 
  wich neighborhood and part of the citiy they were again ? 
   and russia is around 100x worse ( by the most optimistic measures ) . 
  you 're welcome . 
  and 0 sources  they show statistical data . 
  let see moscow 13 millions citizens berlin : 3 milions  not delusional , it 's both intuitive and data-backed that crime spikes in unpopulated areas , at night and with the presence of alcohol . 
  what does that have to do with what i wrote , what is the link with my previous messages ? 
   in moscow you threaten to beat a couple of gays and no one even stops to look . 
  again , thanks for providing me more material !!, 
  what do you want sources where people walk among people on the street that are dying or in need ?? 
  are you dumb ? 
  now the most funy part  i dont get what you are trying to spin with my sources this is hilarious  they all had something in common gay people kiss = attact , insult and discrimination in western countries ( it doesnt help that its on the rise ) that is all i wanted to show wich i did , 
   come over here you gay ( this is a threat , btw , so one battery , one assault right there ) saying `` come over '' is not a threat where you will be arrest under threat laws '' and `` bitches '' is not hate speech  in one video from one couple of gays walking in broad daylight on busy streets . 
  i gave you 5 links with clear example where it happen in broad daylight in european capital , recent sources at that less than 1 year . 
   trying to suggest that berlin or london are anywhere near the hatred levels that russians feel for homosexuals is laughable . 
  i never talked about `` level of hatred '' but assault and homophobic attact , you have provide until now ** o sources ** wich mean its all nonsenses out of your head . 
   really do n't get what you are trying to prove that the videos definitely dont show 143 millions people wich you dare to argue base on nothing wich is hilarious wouldnt even hold , that your clunky explanation to disregard the jewish video doesnt hold , that you have 0 datas , that you tried to pull in my head that such events wont happen in european capitals in broad daylight wich is absurd and not true , i even show you clear sources where that did happen . 
  you have nothing . 
   btw , i do n't want to even imagine if they kissed ... or they walked at night ... or in small alleys . 
  yeah bla bla bla ( completely delusionnal ) http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/gay-couple-thrown-off-london-bus-kissing http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/calgary-taxi-driver-suspended-for-kicking-out-gay-man-and-calling-him-disgusting-for-kissing that was was two months ago http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3071304/college-running-accused-beating-two-gay-men-kissing-street.html, 
  its georgia that attact in 2008 . 
   oh , it 's so hard to believe that russia is misbehaving are you not able to check your sources ? 
  or infos at all ? 
  this is basic  here 's another source confirmed by european union monitoring mission your source is a ** georgian website again ** and the only one reporting that the eumm reported something but thats the thing no other sources mentionned the eeumm there is nothing on the website of the eeumm also http://www.eeas.europa.eu/ not a single thing on google search, 
   does n't say that in the whole city there were only 300 attacks , it says that this one group only took written notes about 300 . 
  still that is what they record and those are datats , they might be lower or in the uk they might be higher  well , there were two cases of battery instead . 
  good job !, 
  once case of battery  this means that while walking through moscow for one day moscow is a city of 13 millions people , berlin has barely 3 millions  let 's say that this number is not 20 , let 's say it 's 13 ( i counted 5 in the first minute of walking , should be about right ) . 
  first they were ** 0 ** in the first minute you need to know the defnition of insult ( homophobic one at that or hate speech ) and ** not 13 ** i advise you again to read a translation of the videos ( plenty around on reddit ) in the entire videos i count at least 7 slurs associate with homophobia in the entire video . 
  i saw it but it is a `` no name newspaper '' this source show 1.5 km ** unlike ** the 2 km quoted in that article . 
  that is not over the ministry of georgia has not provide any numbers or km just a statement wich was not rely by 0 major news ** 5 days ** ago http://police.ge/en/shinagan-saqmeta-saministros-gantskhadeba/8471 i call it what is , ** this is simply propaganda ** go ahead / r/europe enjoy it !, 
   i still do n't know where you came up with that number . 
  under `` analysis , by sarah rainsford , bbc news , st petersburg '' look again this is annoying . 
   yes , insults is 26 % and assault/threat another 26 % . 
  the assault threat section are combine , i dont know why you add it with insults . 
  that is not how it work furhtermore threath are `` violent crimes '' equal to assault ironically they were 0 threaths in this video . 
   i guesstimated the number of insults in the video ( for two people for one day ) to be around 20 . 
  that is the thing they were not ** 20 insult ** far from that and far below . 
   `` the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot . '', 
  i seriously dont get that story there is something seriously fishy ** 0 western sources reported it ** only this georgian website, 
   yes . 
  insulting is violence . 
  is not a crime . 
  the synonym of the word offence is crime the link show clearly that those offence were violent thus violent crime http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/feb/13/violent-sexual-crime-statistics-england-wales-2013   i already put the link just do ctrl+f `` more 300 ''  zero results . 
  but thanks for the tip . 
  and i told you how to do it are you seriously doing it on purpose ?
