  * one lgbt support group cited by human rights watch documented more than 300 homophobic attacks last year *  474 cases ** including insults ** in a whole year in a whole city . 
  you can see at least 10 % of that in the video alone . 
  * lets quote * * the maneo report shows that main offences in anti-gay acts of violence are insults ( 26 % ; 2011 : 30 % ) , actual and aggravated bodily harm ( 25 % ; 2011 : 21 % ) , and assaults and threats ( 26 % ; 2011 : 17 % ) * obviously insult is only 26 % while the rest are physical arms . 
  i stil dont know where you get that 10 % number assuming you understand russian or read the translation . 
   dude , really ? 
  are you really trying to prove that being gay is the same in russia i never did that , i asked an original question that nobody did answer yet , the polish guy and he tried to argue me down and the conversation did deflect without backing and making me eat nonsenses . 
   but you guys are definitely half a century behind on that matter and it is pretty fucked up and again more statements without facts or statistics see my reply 4 days ago , the last https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cwrbm/poll_shows_russian_attitudes_to_gay_people_are/ct08jpq?context=3, 
   offences . 
  not crimes . 
  very different . 
  i dont know so lets quote  in london alone , the metropolitan police recorded 1,073 ** violent homophobic offences ** http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/rise-in-homophobic-attacks-in-london-greater-manchester-south-wales-and-northern-ireland-say-police-9885511.html so they were violent  still have n't seen the source . 
  your source did not contain those numbers . 
  i already put the link just do ctrl+f `` more 300 '' http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30477728  making the numbers much more trustworthy ( as in `` not meaningless '' ) i tend to trust `` human rights numbers ''  i have seen 2 assaults in the moscow video alone . 
  wich still prove nothing and by the way one battery as for better sources for berlin http://www.maneo.de/en/news/detail/article/the-number-of-incidents-of-homophobic-violence-remains-high-homophobic-hate-violence-threatens-dem.html by the way none of you answered ** my orginal question ** and this conversation is seriously deflecting . 
  get over it one video can not show for 140 millions people . 
   i do n't see that figure in the link , ( seems awefully low , my guess would be under-reporting ) but ok ... well i mean is clearly written in the article and i quote  one lgbt support group cited by human rights watch documented more than 300 ** homophobic ** attacks last year *  ok , so not 1000 , but 300 . 
  let 's adjust to 360 for the whole year . 
  i took the datas from stotland yard the metropolitan police of london . . and i quote * scotland yard recorded 1,073 violent homophobic offences between january and october , up from 1,007 in 2013 and 1,002 in 2012 * see they are 300 ** assault ** in london but 1073 ** homophobic ** crimes while in st petersburg they are only 300 ** homophobic ** crimes . 
  you need to read better . 
  and fact check seriosuly your ratios . 
   nice fact checking , let 's do it again some time ... no problem , i am always good if you want we can do that again let see berlin * in berlin -- one of the most tolerant cities in the world , at least for gay men -- the percentages are higher . 
  out of 2,150 respondents , 43 percent reported hate crimes , up from 39 percent in 2006 * wich mean 1225 alone for berlin a city of 3 millions people . . 
   thanks for proving my point . 
  * attacks are so rare that when one happens it makes the news . 
  * ok so lets do some facts check i dont know according to the guardian they are around ** 1000 per year ** in london alone in 2014 http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/26/rise-violent-homophobic-crimes-reported-police while lgbt association record around 347 in st ptersbourg http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30477728 in both they are rising . 
  the numbers in uk are borderline schocking did you hear each of those attact in newspaper each day ? 
  i dont think so  also i talked about ** in the city center ** in * broad daylight * against ** random pair of homosexuals ** . 
  only two of my links were at night  the russian video ... not in the city center ? 
  well , sure * you do n't see the kremlin in the background * not really the soviet building clearly gave me a hint and i suggest to take a map of moscow . 
  beside i dont get it are you saying that working class people can not walk in those areas ? 
   besides : what about the second one ( which is much more violent/confrontational ) ? 
  sure it is still represent nothing at all and we dont know the background of the guy . 
  please again refrain to use anecdotes . 
  and you still didnt answer my question   with two of them outside the city center ( and one walking in the middle whatever on purpose ) outside the city center . 
  let see clearly the first one was defintiely outside the city center ( soviet style rise building appartement , air conditioneers in the backgroubd including the tiny corner store on the left  au contraire . 
  the fact that there * was * an attack tells * everything * . 
  ** no its not ** they walked amount a thousand of people 10 hours , it is ridiculous to claims it represent a country . 
   those guys could walk for a week around ( madrid , paris , amsterdam , brussels , berlin , vienna , rome , zurich , copenhagen , oslo , stockholm ) let see ** madrid : ** http://www.towleroad.com/2014/12/gay-couple-attacked-by-neo-nazi-gang-in-madrid/ ** paris : ** http://leplus.nouvelobs.com/contribution/1162129-nouvelle-agression-homophobe-a-paris-cette-violence-est-inacceptable.html ** amsterdam ** : http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/gay-man-beaten-loses-hearing-amsterdam-attack170614/ ** brussels : ** http://brusselstimes.com/belgium/3408/young-man-attacked-with-machete-in-marcinelle-for-being-gay ** vienna : ** http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/06/16/austria-gay-mep-attacked-with-acid-at-vienna-pride-parade/ ** rome : ** http://www.thelocal.it/20140627/rome-gay-centre-hit-by-faeces-attack ** copenhagen : ** http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/trans-woman-attacked-hammer-broad-daylight060613/ ** oslo : ** http://www.towleroad.com/2014/07/gay-man-attacked-with-glass-bottle-in-oslo-after-being-asked-if-he-is-gay/ ** stockolm : ** http://www.queerty.com/couple-attacked-one-stabbed-at-stocholm-europride-20080728 all debatable and anecdotes lets not forget this two gems below http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/26/rise-violent-homophobic-crimes-reported-police http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/muslim-mother-picking-up-children-from-school-has-hijab-pulled-off-and-attacked-by-assailants-10303354.html refrain to use anecdote please, 
   not even the same league . 
  and you still didnt my answer  this video shows two physical attacks in the middle of crowded streets in broad daylight . 
  with two of them outside the city center ( and one walking in the middle whatever on purpose ) outside the city center . 
  this videos is far from being representative both videos are worthless, 
  please i am curious defined `` civilized '' on wich criteria a nation is deemed to call `` civilized '' ? 
  you are right its up to 60 000 !, 
  and what kind of credibility the icps has ? 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_centre_for_prison_studies and you still have not answer my question . 
  no the law was passed it only affect 20 000 people not 200 000 !?? 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25433426 plus there is a chart you can see that the number of prissoners have been fallen since 5 years . 
   because it 's very likely the russian stats , like their old soviet counterparts , are a fabrication . 
  and it is very likely that you are lying without any single proof . 
  do you have any sources on that ? 
  after all this is coming from the icps . 
   you replied to that things are getting rapidly worse ( in terms of hum | an rights for gay people ) . 
  i was replying to his overall situation of the country getting worse ( not only in terms of gay rights ) wich is obviously false , the gay topic has been pretty static in russia since 2012 ( the date where putin pass his laws anyway in fact no new laws are being plan or were passed since 2013 . 
  the only thing i see is a rerun of the same show each year between muscovites and the governement wich obviously foreign media are blowing out of proportion each year [ furthermore i am waiting for the european court ruling on the case of * bayev and others v russia * ] ( https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/37475/en/european-court-of-human-rights:-%e2%80%98homosexual-propaganda%e2%80%99-bans-violate-freedom-of-expression ) so i dont know how he can claim things are getting worse since nothing did happen in 6 years or no laws are being planned right now for lgbt . 
  now one things stand in the `` open democracy '' article wich has directly a link with this current article and i quote  * the majority of russians probably have no opinion at all on gay matters , and only formulate one when prompted by the questions posed by vtsiom or the levada centre *  * the most glaring example was one run in 2005 by vtsiom ( a leading social and market research organisation owned by the state and managed by the government ) , where respondents had no opportunity to express a positive opinion about homosexuality . 
  people were asked the question : ` which of the following actions do you feel can never be justified ; which can be permitted in some cases , and which should be generally acceptable ? ' one example given for appraisal was ` homosexuality ' . 
  so respondents were allowed to choose between three negative options : ` should be banned ' ; ` okay sometimes ' and ` we can live with it ' -- not to mention the fact that homosexuality is described as an ` action ' * this is the exact same poll this dubious article is currently using as a reference to show a shift , how can he show it if the original poll 10 years ago was dubious or didnt ask for more positive opinion . 
   can you explain why you feel that way ? 
  i do n't understand how the video is relevant . 
  if he is truly russian he understand quite well the video and my point . 
  frankly i dont have time to write a wall of text on exactly this circlejerk . 
  i already gave some solid economic explanatation that mysteriously manage to get downvotes despites ** facts ** , people are not here to get fact but to listen walking idiot using hyperbole and sophistries . 
  https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cwrbm/poll_shows_russian_attitudes_to_gay_people_are/cszviyq?context=3 and here ** actually ** how to interpret russian polls instead of blaming putin ( the favorite sport ) https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/alexander-kondakov/do-russians-give-damn-about-homosexuality and additionnal infos . 
  definitely not i am quite serious . 
  big lol you belarussians are the best !, 
   yes , dream on mr. internet economist . 
  go tell the russian pensioners , that ruski econemy is going great : so you use ad hominem and a tiny bit of character assasination lets not forget an attempt to belittle me instead of debunking my points . 
  furthermore your link is from january and is link with inflation , ruble value ( all that i already adress in the two links i put ) furthermore get your shit update http://www.ipe.com/countries/cee/russian-pension-funds-set-for-more-secure-future/10007650.fullarticle http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mobile/business/article/russia-steps-back-from-brink-of-major-pensions-overhaul/519674.html you are not the brithest light in the room i guess huh huh huh , 
   it is not a joke . 
  yes it is  if russia keeps the current economic and foreign policy in place , chances are it will continue to stagnate and might never reclaim it 's place among the ( primary ) world powers . 
  oh boy ** crass economic ignorance ** in a nutshell , but i have already argue down people on that point https://np.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/3cp7yj/russia_is_top_us_national_security_threat_gen/csybdxl?context=3 https://np.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/3cp7yj/russia_is_top_us_national_security_threat_gen/csy9axs?context=3, 
   i seriously hope france is taking their orders from germany on this case . 
  that has to be probably , i strongly doubt at this point that the french can lead something right now inside the eu without germany approval . 
  this is no more the 90s and early 2000s where germany use to play the second fiddle . 
  [ yeah yeah right ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fopyrhhlt3m ), 
  lol big sorry did catch on !, 
  i am surprise you dont know that of course you should know that my dear estonian friend . 
  navalny was the hero of that sub !, 
   all in all not too surprising . 
  russia itself played a big part in the genocide . 
  it was the dutch that were watching all day long, 
  you would be surprise that veto was even backed by liberals in russia . 
  i edited yes and i wanted to talk to the guy in french . 
  yeah i saw the mod that was doing that from what i saw people were annoy with him . 
   while their budget is still in deficit , that deficit is also steadily declining since its highest point in 2010 , they were on path to reach a budget by 2010 before the crisis happened , and have recovered since then est ce que je dois te signaler que sa fait depuis 20 ans que l'italie n ' a pas eu un budget balanc\u00e9 ? 
   this french thing is getting hardcore . 
  what ? 
   there is n't an ideal job . 
  i just want earn enough money to pay bills the day they arrive and buy a nice house for me and my girlfriend . 
  yeah ... maybe not studiyng `` international relations '' would have seriously help ... 
   you mean that former polish-lithuanian territory that was annexed by russia circa 1790 ? 
  volhynia and eastern galicia was annexed by austria not russia, 
  maybe he was making a reference to the latin union https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/latin_monetary_union, 
  ending the conversation by calling me `` a shill '' ( because my comments history certainly does not matter , ya know ... ) i certainly didnt expext that ( roll eyes ) let see what rationnal wiki has to say on that http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/shill_gambit [ of course it also show your weakness ] ( http://www.discussionist.com/101521053 ), 
   ah , you 're right , it 's again your english skills that prevented me from parsing your answer : yet you were wrong no matter the false excuses  so to reiterate : there is old guard , there is liberals and oligarchs club and there is putin and cooperative ozero  ( can we call it the billionaires club ? ) . 
  the billionaires club does not touch we cant call him a billionnaire club if not all them are . 
   the old guard but their liberal opponents are found dead or in prison over past decade . 
  yes you seems to understand  and all this you present as some kind of achievement of russian civilization in your attempt to troll random person on the internet . 
  yet , another nonsensical drivel  well played .
