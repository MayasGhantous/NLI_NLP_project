  you are saying that the golden horde ( which kazakhstan was an integral part of ) and its various peoples did not have the same level of interaction with europe turkey has had ? 
  how are you measuring this `` interaction '' ? 
  many of the peoples that were part of the golden horde are native inhabitants of eastern europe . 
  ( tatars , bashkirs , kamlyks , and kazakhs ) is kazan , sarai , astrakhan , etc not enough evidence of interaction for you ? 
  are the polish forming gangs and going around england raping little white girls too ?

  im talking about armenia . 
  i do n't think it would work out . 
  we have conflicting interests and allies . 
  they also have a massive portrait of him carved into a mountain . 
  so its a red herring ? 
  touch\u00e9, 
  but officers hang do they ? 
  but do they hang in the police offices of mr. bean 's russia ? 
  well , that girl did n't put a sign over her pussy saying `` dicks welcome '', 
  i never questioned the democratic nature of the elections . 
  however , after viewing the links american users have sent me , perhaps i should have . 
  thanks for the cancer, 
  are us presidential elections usually this retarded ? 
  arabs has been invading and colonizing parts of europe for thousands of years . 
  if there is anyone who needs to come to terms with their history , its the arabs . 
  butthurt belt on suicide watch, 
   common language , ** ancestral ** , social , cultural , or national experiences .

  drugs are bad for you man . 
  you should get help . 
  you know we are not the only country with a great deal of stalinists . 
  care to actually inform me on what its supposed to mean then ? 
  because that salute is supposed to represent belief in one god . 
  i am almost sure that the picture you showed is a joke . 
  ( guy is making the islamic finger salute in front of a nazi flag . ), 
  you are n't wrong though . 
  many of the volunteer units are right sector militants or banderites who use the upa flag, 
   genocide is the intentional action to ** systematically eliminate ** an ethnic , national , racial , or religious group there is a proper definition , and no it can not apply to small massacres . 
  the issue i think you are trying to bring up is the politicization of the word , which leads to its definition being bent to fit a certain narrative . 
  is there a trailer ? 
  i apologize if that issue you presented offends you . 
  its not what you think !, 
  you just have to be in a place of worship .

  ( genocidal fascist dictator ) i hope you are not equating ivan iv ( and cromwell ) with hitler ... i can assure you , they are nothing alike . 
  i approve of the statue , but the spot for it should be changed . 
  he was an efficient ruler and should be honored as such . 
  most people 's problem is the spot where the statue is being built - many think it would not look good . 
  the issues of repression play a small role - he was a monarch and that is what monarchs did . 
  most european countries still honor some assholes from their past . 
  cromwell is honored in england with a statue . 
  ivan iv played an important role in our history and expansion of the state , its stupid that we do n't have a statue dedicated to him . 
  ( i personally believe the reason behind is the troubled times that came after his son 's death ), 
  japan has 120 million people,

  delusional englishmen believe the poles are the problem ? 
  its as if everything ubisoft does turns into a disaster .

  june deportation and operation priboi deported around 100,000 people all together . 
  the repression under stalin is still fresh in the minds of elderly across former soviet union .
