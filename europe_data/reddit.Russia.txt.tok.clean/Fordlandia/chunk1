yeah ... 
  i 'm going to be in munich in about two weeks , should i just skip the parks ? 
  fake , everyone knows there 's no such thing as bread in belarus . 
  only potatoes . 
  yeah , must be crazy to have 20 hours of darkness a day and then the exact opposite . 
  inb4 lapland is n't a safe enough area for refugees, 
  hah yeah , they 're in for a surprise once winter comes . 
  best prank ever . 
   medieval-like clerics like ? 
   the older generation is culturally closer to russians anyways , lol ouch, 
  yeah , often enough minorities are the loudests groups . 
  i 've been to latvia enough times to know that the average latvian could n't care less about whether i 'm russian or not as long as i do n't behave like an asshole , which i always make my primary goal when i 'm abroad , 
  that 's really nice to hear , 
   but i 'm biased you russian ? 
  i 've actually met quite a few latvian russians , all wonderful people . 
  where do you live now ? 
  what is the general ( or your personal ) attitude/sentiment towards the russian speaking population ? 
   i think latvia has the highest female model population per capita of any country ? 
  it 's estonia actually , 
  screw quality of life . 
  this is the true one and only measurable criteria for happiness . 
  i do n't live in russia anymore which is why i said i do n't know whether his claims are true or not , but relatives that still live there have told me that neo-nazi groups are still a problem and not a thing of the past . 
  let 's be honest for a moment , i do n't think he wanted new synagogues , but a safe life for him and his family . 
  and i know that russia is n't as anti semitic as france for instance , you do n't have to prove that to me , 
  he 's jewish , it 's safe to assume he wo n't be persecuted for his religion around there ( plus pretty much automatic citizenship ) . 
  i do n't know whether his claims are true or not from an objective view point , but it 's sad that russia is driving away intellects like ilya frank indirectly by not doing anything to these neo-nazi groups . 
  thanks , i always missed out on threads like the one about the eu army because i did n't know all the abbreviations . 
  update later with results, 
  thanks , i 'll try to fill in verona along with the alps   no i do n't live in italy anymore , i had to move to the uk 2 years ago because salaries in italy are a joke . 
  hopefully i can go back in a few years , but i do n't see the situation improving anytime soon . 
  i 'm sorry to hear that , my family also had to relocate because of ( among other reasons ) financial problems , and i wish i could go back . 
  hope things work out for you !, 
  haha , i knew it had to be either the netherlands or belgium . 
  thanks !, 
  my flight is actually to milan but i 've booked a hotel in como ( i 'll rent a car after i land ) and plan to hang around there for a couple days and , check out venice for a day ( like you suggested ) and hopefully see the alps too . 
  i 'll definetly read up on trentino alto adige and i will check to see if i can squeeze in another one of the cities you 've listed , thank you so much !!, 
  btw - annual visit ? 
  you do n't live in italy anymore ? 
  awesome video !, 
  where were you at 1:02 ? 
  also , that incredible street at 1:10 ... 
  hey , i 'm going to northern italy in september ( venice too ) and was wondering if there was anything i should be wary of , or just anything i should know in order to avoid being ripped off or having some sort of unpleasant experience there ... it 's my first time visiting italy , so could you give me any tips ? 
  well this is awkward, 
  russia :  ukraine  putin  gay cool, 
  shhh , vlad the great has spoken . 
  yeah this is n't going to work, 
  i 'm pretty sure preaching hate is n't considered free speech in the western world . 
  can confirm . 
  am russian . 
  spoke russian 99 % of the time . 
  saint petersburg is considered to be more similar to european cities ( in terms of tolerance and general mentality ) than moscow or other major russian cities . 
  i have n't been to moscow that many times but i think ( at least hope ) saint petersburg will perhaps project a somewhat different picture than what we 've seen here . 
  of course , the editor has the power to turn the video completely upside down depending on his agenda ; he can make russia look like the most homophobic place in the western world , or one of the more acceptant and tolerant countries in the western world . 
  in reality , ** on average ** , russians are somewhat more homophobic than germans or other europeans . 
  that does n't mean tolerant people do n't live there , it 's just that usually the loud minority is the one making all the headlines which in turn cast a huge shadow on the majority of people . 
  that being said , russia is n't on-par with europe on this matter , and that 's a direct result of long , long propaganda . 
  russia has alot to achieve in humanistic matters , unfortunately it does n't seem like things are heading for a change anytime soon . 
  i 'd be interested to watch the saint petersburg version of this video . 
  seriously though , what 'd you mean by '' ... ? '', 
  cause i feel like i 'm missing something, 
  that 's cool , i 've heard there 's a large russian community in canada . 
  some of my father 's family actually live there . 
  it 's fine , glad we cleared that up , 
  ... what ? 
  i was born in russia and i currently live in israel . 
  that 's incredibly unfair , borderline ignorant to say given how many ukranians they 've taken in in these desperate times . 
  the fact that ukranians are similar to poles in work ethic and language and can relatively easily integrate into the polish society does n't mean their display of humanity can be so easily dismissed . 
  i doubt that 's the reason . 
  there have been tens ( if not hundreds ) of posts on israel which is n't in europe too . 
  51 % to go . 
  i love how they 're saying what they think with no regards to how it may look - straight to the point , no bullshit . 
  i respect that . 
  sweden/germany ? 
  '' ... the role of the old west in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world '' . 
  i could n't agree more with what you just said . 
  everything that 's happening with ukraine is because putin still dreams about the soviet union and wishes to re-establish and re-gain everything they 've lost during the 90s . 
  if putin did n't dwell so much on past affairs , he could 've made russia on par with countries like germany and canada . 
  like you said , longing for `` lost lands '' is irrational and useless , especially in the case of russia . 
  what 's done is done , people , and countries , should move on . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the baltic states are really just western russia , that 's common knowledge . 
  ^ / s seriously , i do n't know what kind of drugs these people are on . 
  we 're the largest country in the world , that 's not big enough for them ? 
  what do czech people think about gays , blacks and jews ? 
  yeah , i know . 
  i live in israel , and that 's true , only i do n't think that that 's what he was implying . 
  really ? 
  ` you know nothing of me and i know nothing of you ' ? 
  i find that a bit hypocritical of you to say , at the very least , since you told that israeli guy that israel , and by extension it 's citizens , know alot about death . 
  so please , spare ** me ** your bullshit next time . 
  i explained what he meant , i did n't claim that what he said was true . 
  are n't you just so sophisticated and edgy . 
  refugees in israel are given the opportunity to work . 
  if they do n't , they do n't get welfare . 
  what he meant was you should n't offer welfare to just about anyone who enters your country since that pretty much eliminates the incentive to work . 
  could you elaborate on bosnia ? 
  do n't know how it compares to other european cities , but prague , probably the most expensive czech city , was shockingly really cheap . 
  from groceries to beer , everything was so much cheaper than back home , and that 's on top of it being one of the most beautiful cities in europe . 
  the bit about israel is ** complete ** bullshit , also why is it even on the list ? 
  way too strong .
