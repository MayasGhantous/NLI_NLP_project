  dude , chill out ... 
  how is this not child endangerment ? 
  hamas are only looking out for their own interests and they could n't give a damn about palestinians . 
  you think if corbyn will start calling them friends they will just melt away and await his commands ? 
  they 'll just keep doing whatever the hell is going to get them the most money in the bank at the end of the month . 
  they show literally no signs of willingness to negotiate . 
  also , i 've never heard corbyn call naftali bennett ( head of the jewish home party ) his `` friend '' or any other zionist mps in the knesset . 
  hahaha holy shit i 'm in tears looking at those pictures, 
  you think germany does n't spy on all of it 's allies ? 
  or france ? 
  or britain ? 
  spying has nothing to do with being an ally . 
  can confirm, 
  damn straight, 
  i look at this and just stare in awe , thinking each village is more beautiful than the last , and then i come across russia and belarus . 
  streisand effect , bitch . 
  i doubt that `` activist '' even gives a damn about the victims of the terror attack . 
   and have mexico pay for it ? 
  [ china 's going to pay for it !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/5nmk88czoug?t=2m5s ), 
  lie well about what ? 
  their skills ? 
  does denmark generally lean a bit more towards the right ? 
  ( compared to sweden ), 
   they heard about my sexual hangups and tried to convince me i was gay . 
  fucking useless . 
  the fuck ? 
  sounds like some seriously shitty shrinks . 
  regardless , i ca n't imagine what toll that experience must 've taken on you . 
  i sincerely hope you get better bro !, 
  i meant the latter seeing as how i 'm used to the former . 
  holy shit some of those wages ... 
  is the pay better ? 
  he did n't imply russia is a western country , he said that * even * in western countries social workers are n't paid too well . 
  could be . 
  could be two and a half . 
  it 's even worse if that 's how much he is paid if he indeed works full time . 
  it says 15 days in the picture . 
  hours differ from profession to profession , too . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's not a full time job . 
  still , social work is n't easy at all even if it is n't full time . 
  i 'm pretty sure he would 've already left if he had the money . 
  i really hope this becomes a thing, 
   part time ethical hacker i love this job description, 
  i also think the sound of the language is really interesting . 
  is it because of the turkish influence ? 
  you guys have such a unique language , it 's pretty damn cool, 
  it 's like you took the words out of my mouth, 
  gorgeous !, 
  i see nothing wrong here , what was the scandal about ? 
  just a regular saturday , eh ? 
  it 's alright , we can get the main idea from the auto translation . 
  unfortunately this translation is pretty bad ... 
  i mean , you can get the general idea but that 's about it . 
  are there any other english sources ? 
  thanks !, 
  nice of you to say this . 
  i could but unfortunately i 'd have no way of paying tuition . 
  russian jew here , i actually considered relocating and studying in germany but this past year i 've become more and more hesitant towards that decision . 
  i 've been to your country many times and have loved absolutely everything about it , but recent global events have made me skeptical about my safety there . 
  for what it 's worth , i hope you guys find and implement a solution as soon as possible so that nobody will have to feel unsafe . 
  thanks, 
  is n't immigration to the czech republic pretty difficult ? 
  how does one obtain residency permit/citizenship ? 
   i am pretty sure that neither you nor i can predict the future . 
  i do n't have to predict the future , there are very clear patterns when it comes to french immigration to israel . 
  99 % of them settle in cities like ashdod , petah tikwa and other cities which already have a significant french speaking population . 
  ** they 're not planning on building their homes in the palestinian territories ** . 
  why should they displace them in the first place if no one is going to take their place ? 
  makes no sense . 
   oh no , you got me , i am commenting on 100 + unrelated subreddits as a paid greek shill of palestine . 
  totally not possible that i have my own opinion . 
  / s i have n't read any one of your posts and have no intention of doing so , and when did i claim you 're a palestinian shill ? 
  i simply stated that you have a personal agenda which in your case obviously comes before facts . 
  i realize that as someone who actually *** lives *** in israel , i can throw facts at you all day long but you simply wo n't care since it does n't fit your narrative, 
  you 've no idea what you 're talking about . 
  these people are n't going to settle down in palestinian territories but rather in cities like ashdod , where there 's a significant french speaking population and where absolutely no palestinians live . 
  whatever fits your agenda , right ? 
  god i love that movie . 
  wait is n't that belarus, 
  top kek, 
  it 'll be like playing whac-a-mole, 
  who gives a shit ? 
  your answer to terrorism is `` at least we 're not x '' ? 
  ** try working together to fix the problem **, 
  what possible reason is there for france to bash belgium in these days ? 
  jesus , even in such difficult times , people still find time for this political pissing contest . 
  any way to get english subtitles for this ? 
  pretty interesting documentary . 
  did n't know that , thanks , 
  this is generally true , but for instance , some ukranians and belarussians will pronounce the \u0433 sound as an english `` h '' . 
  for example , my grandpa 's who 's from belarus says `` hovorit '' instead of `` govorit '' . 
  that 's a pretty small indicator , but still something that 's widely known . 
  also , some people claim that moscow and saint petersburg have their own unique `` accents '' , which are n't * really * accents but rather just putting an emphasis or straining different sounds . 
  overall , yeah , i 'd say relative to the size of russia , there 's a very little amount of dialects . 
  * alot * of russians go to egypt ( and turkey ) for vacation . 
  it 's definetly one of the top 3 destinations for russians . 
  mirrored german here . 
  genius up until some other genius decides to take matters into his own hands , since his government is doing jack shit, 
  that 's not true ; initially there were 6 against him , back in 1994 .
