  all of them are still in jail . 
  yeah there are plenty , but like i said , you do n't have to move to northern russia to experience cold weather . 
  well northern russia gets really hot in the summer ( the north has the biggest temperature differences between winter and summer ) and just the mosquitos alone would drive you crazy if you lived in the north ( they 're * really * bad ) . 
  would not recommend moving there to anyone i know . 
  there are cold countries where civilization is a thing , and where people do n't die because they froze to death while drinking vodka ( no , not a joke ) . 
  to be honest , i still ca n't tell if you 're trolling or not, 
  ... why ? 
  can . . can i move there ? 
  check back in a month and a bit i guess, 
  huh , i was standing right there on that bridge and admiring the view less than a week ago . 
  i 've never seen crazier students than portugese ones . 
  with their harry potter-like capes , quidditch sticks and non-stop singing it was really an eye opener everytime we saw them . 
  employed ? 
  damn , that 's gorgeous . 
  i do n't get these people . 
  they 've been living in germany for decades yet they still vote in turkey and i 've heard alot of them say that their life in germany is just `` temporary '' and that eventually they will go back to turkey , yet they do n't seem to ever do so . 
  they raise their kids as though they 're still living in turkey , they maintain their old way of life and some of them have no plans of ever assimilating ... what exactly ** is ** keeping them in germany ? 
  this dude should write a guide book . 
  but muh borders :(, 
  daaamn they mad, 
  i moved when i was a teenager to a country that does n't have these kind of windows . 
  do n't remember if we had them back home, 
  i never even knew these kind of windows existed until i visited munich . 
  yeah youtube comments have gotten incredibly disgusting the past few years , with anti semitic and other racist slurs and whatnot all over the place , not just on political videos . 
  before that it was just some dumb shitposting which was even arguably cute ( sometimes ) . 
  it 's somewhat stressful personally for me , but i try to stay out of it as much as i can . 
  you sound like a lovely bloke, 
  not all of us are as retarded as he is , fuck that guy . 
   they are inferior , so they bash a people superior to and more intelligent than them . 
  woah , calm down there, 
  how are the wages ? 
  lol if you think those youtube comments are racist , then you 've seen nothing, 
  best one i 've heard as of yet, 
  is that a cheeky reference to the whole ginger stereotype ? 
  where in norway do you live ? 
  i 'm happy to hear such things . 
  nations should stand up to that goofy looking fascist and his pussy cats . 
  10/10 translation , would read again , 
  do n't forget good ol' gulf countries & middle east . 
  that 's a combined population of at least 150 million people . 
  frankly , i 'm surprised there are jews in iceland . 
  i hope so too , 
  it 's good that sweden is standing up to russia , if you can call it that , however i honestly do n't think it 'll matter in the end . 
  realistically , even with conscription , sweden ca n't really face russia if they decide to invade . 
  their militaries are just not in the same level . 
  i want to emphazise that i 'm not saying this in a condescending way whatsoever , this is simply the truth . 
  the only thing i can think of that can perhaps explain this , is some sort of agreed upon plan by nato members in scandinavia and the baltic region , to enforce conscription as an attempt to deter russia from any future military actions , which could actually work , imo . 
  he was talking about renzi saying he 'll quit if the no camp wins . 
  erm ... on the off chance of sounding stupid , why do you guys have a tree up at the end of november ? 
  take me there this is so incredibly beautiful . 
  should 've known . 
  though , i was born in \u0413\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c so i do n't know minsk that well to be honest . 
  where in belarus is this ? 
  man , this looks wonderful . 
  i 've always been jealous of countries with such beautiful christmas markets . 
  hmm , i 've only ever heard of it because some famous russian actor was born there but otherwise i did n't know it was so heavily russian . 
  are they at least bilingual ? 
  there are religious russians in narva ? 
  til, 
  more goddammit, 
   fun thing is i have always check how to spell that name because it sounds like tsytskovits . 
  breath taking . 
  god , i just want to chill on that beach and then take a hike on those mountains ... 
  incredible that such architecture is still being built , even if just for the purpose of repair . 
  damn you really rustled some jimmies with that comment, 
  ... wow . 
  that 's really eye opening, 
  phew !, 
  thank god that we 're not at the bottom of this list !, 
   i hope they are n't using inquisition , medieval art and plays as reliable unbiased sources . 
  red hair is nowhere near `` common '' among ashkenazi jews . 
  it is somewhat common . 
  more than in russia probably ( excluding the udmurtic people ) but much less than ireland . 
  it 's more common in the hasidic/haredi communities ( ultraorthodox ) , and they 're 99 % ashkenazi from lithuania/russia/poland / secretely ireland ? 
  heh , i know what you mean . 
  people are rarely satisfied with what they have ... 
  i live , arguably , in a city with * true * 4 seasons . 
  summer can be 25 and 30 ( even had 35 this summer at some point ) , winter can be cold as fuck , and inbetween we have some pretty nice temps . 
  still , on a hot summer day i 'd complain about the heat and wish i was living in the baltics where they pray for the sun to break through the clouds and think to myself '' ** that 's perfect weather ** '' , and when it 's -30 and my eyelashes hurt i curse myself for not enjoying that 35 degree summer afternoon . 
  what sort of climate would you ideally want to live in ? 
  sounds like paradise to me . 
  huh . 
  who 'd have thunk it . 
  i never thought about basic income as a tool to combat unemployment . 
  super duper cool . 
  i think this is mostly lack of negative influence rather than actual positive influence . 
  one day brother , one day . 
  i actually live 400 km east of moscow , but i think i could arrange something . 
  this place looks like its worth the trip . 
  well shit . 
  had n't thought of that . 
   take your bike . 
  i 'd die before i even reach the border . 
  but damn ... cycling in that place must be fucking incredible . 
  never actually had a ` cycling ' trip , maybe this needs to be my first destination !, 
  thanks for the idea :d, 
  i 'd love to visit someday . 
  is that good/bad in the eyes of the danes ? 
  i know there 's a phrase in italy that says `` fumare come un turco '' . 
  truly the most beautiful continent .
