  hehe thanks for the advice man . 
  i travel quite a bit and it 's great to know what agencies i should avoid !, 
  europcar has n't let me down so far , 
   20 a day is impossible for a single person , trust me , i had that job in one of the busiest airports in france . 
  thanks for the insight , i actually do n't have a clue regarding how many cars those guys go through a day . 
  great to hear they 're more honest and responsible in france !, 
  i also did n't have any sort of problems in the malpensa ( milan ) airport last time i rented a europcar ... hope this is just a singular thing . 
  yeah , but it adds up if you go through 20 a day . 
  why do n't you take 8 seconds out of your day and google it ? 
  me and / u/kfijatass have already provided succinct explanations of the situation . 
  here , i 'll even google it for you ( credit to the bbc for their article on this topic ) :  what 's wrong with the reforms ? 
  poland 's judicial system is widely seen as slow and reforms are seen as necessary . 
  `` i 'm absolutely a supporter of this reform , but a wise reform , '' said president duda . 
   the three reforms give the justice minister and mps broad powers and have prompted alarm from the us as well as the eu . 
   * the first reform requires all supreme court judges to step down and gives the justice minister the power to decide who should stay on . 
   * the second gives politicians control over who sits on the national judiciary council which nominates supreme court judges . 
   * the third gives the justice minister the right to select and dismiss judges in lower courts, 
  sure , the judicial reform is widely seen as an attack on the independance of the supreme court of poland ( by replacing supreme court judges with governmental nominees , from what i 've read ) - effectively `` taking over '' . 
  while i agree with your distinction - i think you will also agree that a healthy , independant and strong judiciary system is integral for insuring justice and equality in the eyes of the law and ultimately , the democratic nature of a nation . 
  we can argue semantics but ultimately an independant judiciary system is one of the cornerstones of democracy . 
  edited for spelling, 
  what , protesting against the executive power taking over the judiciary system , which can lead to intrinsically damaging the judiciary system 's effectiveness in keeping the government in check instead of spreading it 's ass cheeks for them ? 
  although i 'm not polish nor a polish citizen i 'm proud of them for taking to the streets and ** successfully ** defending their democracy . 
  fair point . 
  i was half joking though , i 'm glad to hear this is the case . 
  yeah , but what about the english though ? 
  is baikal . 
   any actual tension is being from england in the uk but most of it is banter . 
  everyone i know from england love the irish and irish culture . 
  well shit , til . 
  i thought you guys hated each other with passion . 
  trainspotting has deceited me :(, 
  this is an incredible idea !, 
  awesome work, 
  it 's crap , mostly . 
  i know alot of guys and gals who moved to the us , germany , canada , even finland . 
  in russia however , in most cases , only the already somewhat well-off can afford to move , average ivan does n't have lots of options so he 's kinda stuck . 
  edited for spelling, 
  interesting , i thought there was too much tension between england/ireland/scotland for you guys to move to those parts . 
  anyhow , i really do hope shit gets sorted out soon enough for you !, 
  interesting , these problems are popping up in a whole variety of places in europe and outside of it . 
  talked to a bunch of friends from different countries and they all told me pretty much this . 
  italy , germany , canada , france and now ireland aswell . 
  it 's a damn tragic day when a person who was born in a city , grow up in it , is eventually forced out cause he ca n't make rent . 
  where are the irish moving to ? 
  other irish cities ? 
  europe ? 
  christ , that 's pretty rough . 
  one thing that 's on my mind constantly when i think about italy is when exactly did things take a turn for the worse ? 
  was it the same , say , 40 years ago ? 
  did the 2008 crisis hit italy extremely hard , or is it just plain , good old corruption ? 
  has the north gotten really bad aswell ? 
  is there migration towards the north inside of italy ? 
  heh , i 'd accept that . 
  seriously though , i 'm curious . 
  if that 's really the answer then ... alright , although it 's a bit anticlimactic . 
  what exactly drives that sense of hopelessness ? 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but i thought ireland has been doing really good economically in the past couple of years ? 
  that 's pretty new to me , cool . 
  so what exactly makes you think that the single variable determining drug use and subsequent drug death is russia ? 
  could you expand on this ? 
  as opposed to . . ? 
  not sure if it 's some kind of running joke or not, 
  if that 's the reason , why does finland have so few ( relatively to norway ) deaths ? 
  it 's border with russia is far more convient than norway 's . 
  i 'd very much like to know how you came to that conclusion too if that 's possible . 
  if a person wants to risk their entire life in exchange for a few beers , i guess that 's their choice . 
  but why should some poor guy who happened to drive by them at the same time get killed because of their callousness ? 
  the ultimate legacy . 
  thanks for the heads up !, 
  definitely agree . 
  what the fuck turkey ? 
  top comment explains it pretty well imo, 
  yeaahh ... no . 
  check out / u/shevagleb 's comment , or stick with your romanticized notions for all i care, 
  he jokingly did n't get the joke in order to make another joke, 
   jura is a mountain range , not a town my mistake  switzerland in latin hs helvetia . 
  the helvetii were a celtic tribe . 
  wow , today i learned . 
  stop !, 
  i can only take so much envy in me :( how does a town in switzerland get a celtic name though ? 
  switzerland really looks like it got the best of both ( perhaps more ) worlds . 
  they 've got amazing lakes like in northern italy , and the alps . 
  it 's major cities are also incredible . 
  coolest thing i 've seen in a long time . 
  i totally misunderstood you haha . 
  thought you meant that those shady types are undercover police . 
  wow , bullet doged . 
  awesome undercover work if that 's the case because we were approached by some really shady types . 
  thinking back , i can maybe guess why they do that ... we rented an apartment in bairro alto and people partied there from 7 to 7 with all kinds of good shit . 
  almost witnessed a rape , too . . is that why they 're trying to prevent or is it something else ? 
  in lisbon me and my friend were offered weed every 100 meters ... 4 grams for $ 20 , really cheap if you ask me . 
  some guy ** really ** wanted us to buy it from him and even showed us his id , the cab he rides and he was even dressed nice . 
  interesting experience all in all, 
   being a little russian exclave in the czech republic certainly felt that way when i was there . 
  or the yellow one above it ... 
  so , which do you prefer ? 
  frankly i 'm surprised the baltic countries are n't all light blue ... some are even light yellow . 
  kaunas felt like scotland to me . 
  do the czechs view karlovy vary as a touristy town ?
