   you can not have a single currency but then have multiple banks with their own agenda 's manipulating it actually the correct sentence would be : `` you can not have a single currency and separate fiscal systems '', 
   you are sure that ukraine is going to default ? 
  default is like a positional cauldron -- current government will deny it until the last moment . 
   then on the other hand at least some finns are indignant because they chose those russians who are on the black list to their delegation on purpose , trying to force finland to ignore the sanctions . 
  but those people on the list are also big shots in russia , like senators and duma congressmen . 
  glagolitic then , best runes . 
   uhm , so what 's exactly the difference other than the former looking like ugly russian-runes instead of being instantly recognizable as polish ? 
  one epic rune = one sound , no more digraphs . 
  ancient runes developed by bulgarian sages specifically to suit slavonic languages . 
  much benefits , already used by other slavs . 
   i definitely do n't see any benefit from switching in this comparison , quite the contrary . 
  why so serious ? 
   first , even russian wikipedia does n't call it a clone of kornet . 
  belarussians filtrated specs , known issue :(  second , and more important , is that javelin is fire-and-forget , while all ex-ussr ones need giudance by wire or laser beam . 
  the newest modifications are fire-and-forget . 
  look at the version for the armour vehicle ( em ) , for example . 
  it just shots one or two and goes away - plenty of videos on youtube . 
  javelins in normal conditions also use tripods . 
  that one is type difficult , \u0416 , but in calligraphy is written like a in `` article '' in [ this text ] ( http://i.imgur.com/heoijpk.gif ) . 
   bad comparison with javelin . 
  ca n't just carry a kornet around like that . 
  22,5 kg vs [ 27kg ] ( http://www.zid.ru/products/defence/51/detail/162?sphrase_id=21963 ), 
  your people use alphabet based on czech one , are n't you ? 
   we should make it more costly for the russians to use force . 
  i think it makes sense to give defensive weapons to the ukrainians , like mortars and anti-tank rockets , for the defense of major cities . 
  ukrainian anti-tank missiles ( skif ) are clones of russian ~ ~ corsair ~ ~ kornet class , which have twice the range of the javelins and can penetrate 80 % thicker armour . 
  so if they wan na help , they should give the money to ukrainian military industries , which would be logical thing to do ( close , their army already know how to use them , will help dying industry , etc ) . 
  but i do n't think that american weapons industry lobby who are truly pushing for supplying weapons to ukraine will have that . 
  ** edit : ** name typo, 
  czech alphabet ? 
  depends on someone 's age and cultural background . 
  detective authors : agatha christie and conan doyle were very popular even in soviet times ( see soviet ecranisation of [ sherlock holmes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhujgy6m0rq ) ) , among ` illegal literature ' - orwell and huxley obviously . 
  tolkien while sold in the 80 's was only popular in narrow circles . 
  so obviously people who read those books have idea of brits based on the characters described in those books . 
  those who loved british music of that golden era , was affected by that too . 
  people who studied history in detail know about the [ great game ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_great_game ) , russian and british empires continuous confrontations and rivalry through the xviii-xix centuries . 
  some unpleasant moments like assassination of paul i and crimean war coined the phrase '' * \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0442 * '' , literally meaning ` englishwomen shits ' and referring to queen victoria meddling in bad way in russian affairs . 
  so there is that . 
  also there is a state propaganda term `` anglo-saxons '' referring both to the population of united kingdom and ex-colonies , mostly usa . 
  so that term describes the new jewish-masons sort to speak , who conspire against sacred russia ( kek ) . 
  for those who do n't buy propaganda the traits for your people would be derived from the cultural pieces ( as i said before ) , and would be in my opinion : adventurous ( in good and bad way ) , snobbish , brave , polite , cunning and boring . 
  since i had personal experience i think that the stereotypes are true for some people , which reaffirm them , but false for most , since humans mostly are the same grey mass everywhere with similar tendencies , desires and priorities . 
   because we were rivals , we are rivals and we will be rivals . 
  like germany and france ? 
  what we are then asians ? 
  no , comrade ... we are europeans , somehow a bit more different than others . 
  but if you look close you can see that in europe the differences between each other nation are also significant . 
  take brits and greeks , us and french , estonians and portuguese -- everyone has particular cultural differences . 
  there is also this ` european values ' thing , but that is not what makes someone european . 
  because it is relatively modern ( 30-40 years ) invention . 
  300 years ago they bashed us for being tolerant toward homosexuals , now is the contrary ; 90 years ago they bashed us for being communists , today they denounce our inequality , same with family institutions ... 
  the common values in europe is a morphing thing , and we are a bit in desynchronization with the rest of them . 
  that 's all , they do n't only bash us for it , but also each other , that is how the synchronization and the harmony is achieved in the long run . 
  is is a good thing ? 
  we 'll see in due time , might even join them if the circumstances are right . 
  most of russians ( myself included ) , think of us as europeans . 
  caution zurfer75 , you may be infringing 282 article of our penal code by mocking those * obviously necessary * ` anti-extremism ' measures . 
  so your e-penises are almost 8 % larger than ours now ... interesting . 
  so they asked for it ... literally . 
   we do n't have oil and gas revenues that subsidize huge parts of our economy . 
  if it were n't for energy revenues , russia 's gdp per capita would also be significantly lower . 
  if russia did n't have enough resources to export , then there would be no foreign currency revenue , ruble would be much cheaper and russians would not afford to buy foreign products . 
  therefore our home industries would have it much easier not only to dominate in local market but to export elsewhere . 
  that is called in russia ` the resource curse ' . 
  in alternative scenario , similar to how poland for years compensated the lack of resources with cheaper labour force and social dumping we would do the same , but with more success conserving and modernizing old soviet industries . 
   for instance , income ( and wealth ) inequality is much higher in russia than it is in poland , skewing the statistics significantly . 
  yes , for that the gini coefficient [ is used ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality ) ( simplified of lorenz one , but that historically is not used as much as gini , cos no computers back in the day ) . 
  but even then it would be difficult to compare such values , because more thorough analysis is needed . 
  for example , in russia the difference between cities in very significant , but between cities and villages there is an abyss . 
  and 25 % of russians live in rural conditions , therefore having very important impact on the average values . 
  the best data in my own opinion to compare two countires quality of life are the [ wages adjusted to ppp ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/226956/average-world-wages-in-purchasing-power-parity-dollars/ ) . 
  that is because superrich people do n't get wages -- they get rents and other capital investment fruits . 
  and the statistic to use is the [ median ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_median_wage ) , not the average , so the tails ( unusual values ) do n't count . 
  ( unfortunatlly on link from wiki is not ppp adjusted , i think ) . 
   our statistical office claims that 38,5 million people live in poland , while in reality that number is closer to 37 million . 
  how do they manage to do that ? 
  in any case i had in mind baltic states . 
  puh-lease ... if the newest eu members did n't have the schengen escape valve , they would have significantly less values . 
   the russian army has carried out , in particular , the simulation of a nuclear attack on warsaw . 
  i wonder how they can figure that out ? 
  strange , in russian internets is mostly jokes and gigles about the matter . 
  why poles care what happens in us ? 
  if it only depended on russia , then by all means . 
  but there are bigger players like china and india . 
  putin might have said something along the lines : '' * you can submit your application to this new institution and we will make everything possible for you to be accepted * '' . 
  and tsipras might have spin it so the position of greece would look so desperate as it is . 
  like , having alternatives and things . 
  you are too optimistic . 
  also should be correct answer . 
   you got 6 out of 10 . 
  actually 7/10 , because :  which is the westernmost european capital city ? 
   answer provided : lisboa  correct answer : lisbon, 
   i 'm glad . 
  i do n't know what will happen but that 's a good decision . 
  it 's a good political decision for tsipras , because either greece accepts or not the proposal -- they have dark page in their future ahead . 
  this way he will not be blamed for it so much . 
   but only a million people live there so ? 
  with 35-40 % unemployment most of the men aspire to serve in his guard . 
  while officially he has handful number of subordinates , unofficially it is estimated to be over 50 000 . 
  making this way into top10 of european forces by active and trained personnel .
