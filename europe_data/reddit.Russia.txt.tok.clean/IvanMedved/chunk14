  nobody will move anything , because kadyrov has more forces than most european countries . 
  that 's from [ poedinok ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/poedinoktv/videos ) ( combat ) tv show . 
  normally the host invites guests with contradicting opinions about a contradicting topic . 
  flamewar and mutual insults ensured . 
  sometimes i think there was even a [ fistfight ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fzupmsxwfg ) or couple ( i do n't personally watch 1tv , but occasionally some extracts on youtube ) . 
  do n't be a schmuck now , those potziks still need to pay us something . 
  maybe they should let italy deport them ? 
  these factories indeed exist . 
  but this whole narrative fails to mention , that those factories also exist in all other countries . 
  when in china or russia those are called bots or shills and normally are linked directly to the regime . 
  when in western countries those are called astoturfers and are linked to private contractors who operate in interests of political parties and/or corporations . 
  and by ` your shit ' you mean our ex-colonies , and by ` get together ' you mean forcibly re-unify them in your body ? 
  what this has to do with the topic ? 
  the level of the news , is as if / r/europe was deleted by reddit administration . 
  if you go to / r/ukraina you 'll see that the most important ( upvoted ) story in weeks . 
   speaking about d3.ru , was n't it rather a pressure from . ru authorities than a will/butthurt of d3.ru owner the founder is bosnian serb who leaved his homeland to russia during the civil war , so in my [ impression of him ] ( http://i.imgur.com/au9442c.png ) , he just hates any encouragement of violence from one side or another . 
  in closed part of the site he posted a text explaining his actions , and while a fear of possible repercussions was one of minor reasons -- the continuous posts in ukrainian segment of the portal created significant conflict and flarewars . 
  just imagine ** how much flare and downvotes would create exactly the same scenario on reddit , same picture , but posted by another side of the conflict ** ? 
  now you have reaction of most d3 users . 
   fired by this baby , msta-s , a self propelled howitzer . 
  were n't you guys saying that msta-s is russian exclusive ? 
  ** more context : ** prepare for waves of refugees from d3.ru ( russian reddit/digg ) -- it 's admin got really butthurt because of a shell with '' * hello d3 written on it * '' and banned all ukrainian subs and their mods . 
   they even lied saying they do n't settle tax debt , all the while settling with other companies . 
  they can settle taxes , but they are not obliged , like the banks are not obliged to settle mortgage , while they can do it . 
  in my personal opinion only those companies that have unrelated troubles should be allowed to negotiate the payments , those which avoided and committed tax fraud for almost a decade should n't have such privilege . 
  i 'm not aware of any law that would impose fiscus the duty to negotiate long term payments . 
   rosneft , dissagree with this . 
  less than 10 bn in 2004 to 56bn in 2006 ? 
  let 's not confuse net worth and balance total , shall we ? 
  in the end of 2004 rosneft had $ 22bn debts in it 's balance sheets , compared to 2003 $ 4bn . 
  if we go [ the reports ] ( http://www.rosneft.com/investors/results_and_presentations/ ) the net worth was this : 2003 : $ 6,7 bn 2004 : $ 3,3 bn 2005 : $ 7,4 bn 2006 : $ 21bn how the increase happened ? 
  they took over those assets and filial companies of yukos , but not for free -- they bought them by contracting debt ( around $ 20bn ) with several banks , including foreign ones . 
  and while rosneft bought the largest part of yukos actives , there have been several important buyers ( source in [ russian wiki ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0420\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0430_\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0432_\u042e\u041a\u041e\u0421\u0430 ) ) . 
  why yukos net worth is $ 10bn while they had around $ 30bn in assets ? 
  well , because they also had debts , apparent and hidden ( responsibility for stealing from the filial companies ) , when the tax claim appeared it all surfaced , turning the net worth of the company almost to 0 . 
   you should read the judgement . 
  i read it ( partially , obviously ) . 
  also the others ( with which you seem to confuse this one in some aspects ) . 
  i also read all the khodorkovsky criminal cases , studied the scheme that was used with ukos to super-inflate the company ( economical bubble ) . 
  on this subreddit i maybe am the person who knows the most about this case . 
   the russian government lied and praticly never answered any of the letter from the company about settlement . 
  it does n't work like that in russian law ( continental/european law ) , it might in common law ( uk an ex-colonies ) . 
  in any case it does n't matter because the procedure of bankruptcy was initiated by private banks . 
  all according to russian law about the bankruptcy . 
  after which the judge studies the case , if the current actives do n't match current passives , then the procedure continues and he names konkursny administrator ( a trustee ) to manage the company . 
  if the trustee would led the company to ruin on purpose , there might be a case of responsibility of said administrator ( and his co-conspirators ) by our laws . 
  but in this case the decision is just arbitrary , it is either politically motivated ( see the date of the publication ) or directly bought by khodorkovsky mafia . 
  whole company net worth was n't even $ 10bn before the taxes charges , it was a bubble created by appropriating the extraction of the filial companies and then absorbing them , and later going for more companies ( so the scheme is not revealed ) . 
  yet they asked for over $ 100bn , and the court awarded them with $ 50bn -- it 's a joke , not justice . 
   it was illegal because they did n't let the company enough time to deal with the problem how could they deal with it ? 
  i looked up right now , total ukos debt was $ 29bn by the laws of bankruptcy any creditor has the right to inquire the procedure . 
  and indeed it was inquired and proceeded according to the law . 
   article 1 of protocol no . 
  1 of the european convention on human rights that is very generic . 
  the resolution was politically motivated . 
   the illegal seizing of the company generated $ 50bn now what illegal seizure ? 
  they had that $ 25bn debt to the state and other creditors . 
  the company had n't that cash , so it was bankrupted . 
  so those $ 1.15 bn generate 50bn how ? 
   they froze the money , then asked for a fine to be paid and then seize the company when they could n't pay because the cash was frozen . 
  total debt of yukos was of $ 25bn , do n't see what 1,15 would have changed ? 
   again though , there 's no protection here against a court ruling . 
  money is owed , and is available for seizure . 
  where does the protection come in ? 
  this is basic law - money is owed by subject a , you can not direct any action against subject b unless subject b is 100 % under a control . 
   i 'm not sure why you think private enterprise is protected from the rule of law . 
  because the rule of the court is against russian federation , not private companies . 
  if for example , an asset of gazprom is seized , then the private shareholders are harmed , among them not just russians , but also foreigners . 
   you do n't arrest property or chattel , you seize them . 
  same word in russian , sorry . 
   this is literally the purpose of injunctions - to prevent companies pre-emptively escaping the effects of the court 's ruling . 
  they can not seize more than what is ` owed ' and they can not go world wide simultaneously . 
  typo for edginess, 
   move russian-based company investments russian companies even with state participation are private corporations - their properties can not be arrested . 
  i only know a few exceptions to this . 
  what can be moved are liquid assets , and some real estate that is not used for diplomatic purposes , that can be liquidated and also brought to russia . 
   not only would he not be brave enough to do this , it would very directly into a massive escalation of action taken against his state . 
  everyone know that . 
  the most likely thing to happen if russian assets are frozen for real - move everything to neutral countries ( china/india ) and then putin more likely to retaliate against ukraine . 
  yeah , well , that 's just , like , your opinion , man . 
  well it will also be lawful , because of russian court order in russia . 
  problem ? 
   if the russian state wants to behave like a criminal regime illegally stealing assets because it does n't wants to adhere to treaties they signed themselves , that 's their call . 
  is n't this what france and belgium are already doing ? 
   foreign property is protected by several international treaties yes , this is the property i talked you about , the one protected by diplomatic agreements . 
  then there is property of the government which does not have this protections . 
  property of this type was seized in belgium and france . 
  we are talking about couple millions euros here . 
  not billions that are pretended to be taken by the court decision . 
   a russian court does n't have that jurisdiction . 
  russian court has jurisdiction over all foreign property on russian soil except the one protected by diplomatic agreements . 
  there might be a court in russia prior to that , making it lawful . 
   sure looks like it considering they 're seizing assets . 
  assets from france and belgium could be seized in return . 
   if they think they have a case they can bring it to court . 
  right now the court order is there , and it should be executed . 
  it wo n't be . 
   i do n't know who/where owned yukos , but there are probably more countries who will seize assets . 
  yukos was owned (  60 % ) by menatep group , which is the cover for khodorkovsky ` clan ' . 
  also some big international groups were involved , some journalists point to rothschilds .
