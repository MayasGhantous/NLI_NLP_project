  with ship engines the same situation is going on . 
  same line with other 50 + ukrainian corporations that are contributing to russian military modernization and generate more than 6 % of ukrainian gdp ( and significant part of currency income ) . 
  even if they cut everything they will end up harming themselves more than russian modernization program which will be postponed a couple of years because of that . 
  but new investment and workplaces will be generated as a result in russia . 
  regarding :  most of the microelectronics for space forces no , for space forces they use special silicon on sapphire insulator . 
  to stop the space radiation from causing malfunctions . 
  this technology is very specific and manufactured in russia , while 20nm tech already exists , for practical purposes 300-500nm is used . 
   the article also mentions helicopter and ship engines from ukraine . 
  ship engines are indeed a problem , but only temporal one . 
  similar situation happened with helicopter engines in 2010 with [ motor sich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motor_sich ) , whose owner started to ask for unreasonable prices . 
  in 2012 [ new factory/production lines ] ( http://www.klimov.ru ) were built in saint petersburg . 
  in 2014 motor sich was no longer needed . 
  with ship engines the same situation is going on .

   if you celebrate soviet 's successes as yours , why ca n't someone who has different perspective blame you for their mistakes ? 
  interesting question . 
  but it implies the same equation i stated above : russians = soviets = soviet government = local administrations . 
  soviet central government which created policy was n't consistent of sole ethnic russians , even if you check the statistics - russians were significantly under-represented in the central government through 20 's and 30 's . 
  and local government even under occupied and ` occupied ' territories was n't russian in most cases ( while russians were present ) . 
  because of that the moral and legal responsibility is shared among all the nations that formed soviet people . 
  so are the achievements : victory in ww2 , first in space , great scientific discoveries and welfare achievements ... after the separation -- some nations that were part of soviet union decided that they do n't need neither the achievements nor the responsibility . 
  but that is conjectural political decision . 
  it does n't change their history and their share in all that . 
  we russians do accept our share both in the blame and the glory . 
  but only our part . 
  in 1940 the incorporation of the baltic states to the soviet union is called annexation , because it was based on the decision of that government that was formed in the ` elections ' of 1940 in which only one party was allowed . 
  which is clearly a fraud committed by local socialists with aid of soviet union . 
  but what was the real support of the socialists/communists in 1940 ? 
  we ca n't say , and we ca n't say because communist parties were forbidden long ago and all 3 countries were authoritarian dictatorships which also had elections with only party of power in the voting list . 
  if we go to the time prior to the coups d'etat : lithuania in 1926 , latvia in 1934 and estonia in 1935 . 
  we can see that the lefties ( with communists banned ) held very much support among the population . 
  so it was not like , soviet union invaded and placed russians everywhere at the head . 
  the local administrations were formed with local population , and because of that there is that share of responsibility not just for achievements but also for the crimes . 
  ** edit : ** thank you for the gold , stranger . 
   what was long term ( like over a generation ) impact ? 
  yes , napoleon brought over 600 000 men and left with less than 20 000 . 
  those 580 000 + did n't kill themselves . 
   russians defeated germany hence the biggest celebration day to this day in russia is 9th may . 
  but they did n't do all that awful shit , these were soviets . 
  soviet people defeated the nazi germany , along poles , czechs , brits , french , americans and others . 
  so all have their right to celebrate , as we do in russia , or in belarus , or in kazakhstan ... 
  if someone for political reasons cancel the celebrations , then it 's their lose , but they cant change history . 
   you won the napoleonic wars , what 's there to be mad about ? 
  the damage . 
   so more or less everything that needs to be modernized ? 
  why do you assume that ? 
   these are official statements , but my grandparents and many others were just farmers and were deported to siberia for no reason . 
  if they were wealthy farmers , it might have been a possibility of wrong ` conviction ' . 
  i can not justify the actions of the soviet government if your grands were indeed innocent . 
  but if it serves you any purpose -- there was a program to try and fight local rural mafias called kulaks . 
  in many cases people were convicted because of false reports done by their neighbours who wanted to appropriate their possessions and lands . 
  unfortunately the policies were badly designed and criminally implemented . 
  because of that many people who were innocent ( among the independent farmers ) were wrongly persecuted . 
   they were no threat , they just wanted area and space to russify the region . 
  if we take in account first wave of deportations in the 1941 it was around 0,01 ~ ~ % ~ ~ , maybe 0,02 ~ ~ % ~ ~ of the total population . 
  hardly necessary amount to impact the demographics of region at the time . 
   the total number for the baltic states is about 200 000 . 
  i estimate this number because i only know of lithuania with 150 000 victims , so it 's probably way higher for all three . 
  but you are mixing the deportations of 1941 from the ` june deportations ' in the article , with deportation after ww2 . 
  you should n't . 
  while the post-war deportations also contained falsely accused to some degree you must understand that the deportation was substitutive measure against collaborators during war . 
  among other possible measures it was the softest possible one , and added the posterior amnesties in soviet union i can say that the destiny of many who collaborated with nazis even in western europe were more harsh in some cases . 
  ** edit : ** instead of 0,01 % is 1 % or 0,01 of 1 . 
  very few materials are imported . 
  contracts for mistral ships , italian armour , israeli drones -- were bought because of political reasons . 
  because there was lots of cash and why not score political point or two . 
  the only things right now that russian military industry either does n't do or does but significantly worse are : nightvision and thermalvision devices , intelligent portable combat systems , and little specific chips and very specific radars . 
  i 'm still mad about napoleonic wars , problem ? 
   russians deport people from moldova wow , dangerous sign of equality there . 
  you are implying that russians = soviets = soviet government = local socialist/communist administrations that decided who to be deported . 
  population ( forced ) resettlement was common practice both in russian empire and soviet union . 
  in case of soviet union deportations in 1941 -- people who the government though that would aid the germans in the upcoming war were subjected to resettlement in siberia . 
  for example , germans in general , nationalists , kulaks , political activists ... 
  in general it was considered 0,01 % of the total population . 
  but still big numbers , around 90-100 thousands for the three baltic states . 
  til military modernization costs money , who could have thought ? 
  russian objections will be used to paint eu as aggressor in our home-made/home-used propaganda . 
  have you heard the one about : `` when ukrainian was born the jews sorrowed '' ? 
  every single ideology has some sort of radical wing . 
  religions are obviously not an exception . 
  the question would be -- is the ** internal sorting ** inside that social group of shared ideology or religion lets the radical elements to grow and occupy important position , or instead it becomes the dead end for marginals ? 
  so there is the problem of so called fanatics -- people who obviously posses devotion to their ideology and also may seem by others as people who have certain virtues priced under that ideology . 
  right now , in many muslim communities -- they can not yet differentiate the concepts of fanaticism ( devotion without borders ) and virtue/sanctity ( acceptance of the harsh reality ) . 
  in europe we had similar problem in the medieval ages , which turned among other things into the crusades to the holy land , fact which you being a muslim might now . 
  now , having that history many of us project the possible scenarios of the future interactions and see that a possibility of hostilities is real because : 1 ) muslim communities might follow leaders who both posses the devotion , but also ambition of conquest and expansion , 2 ) this is covered under koran and sunna ( the possibility of conquest both kafirs and people of the book ) , 3 ) we actually see the surge of violence powered by such leaders in middle east right now . 
  that said , while there is a fear of possibility of hostilities -- there are also good examples of muslim communities living in * relative peace * with christians for centuries ( see tatarstan , kazakhstan , yugoslavia before the civil war ) . 
   that 's even more heroic !, 
  yep , defended their loot to the last . 
  edit : have you heard the expression skapy jak polak ? 
   russian reinforcements under prince pozharsky eventually starved the commonwealth garrison ( there were reports of cannibalism ) and forced its surrender on the 1 november ( though some sources give 6 november or 7 november ) after the 19-month siege hmmm ... could you provide a source , i always though that they all starved to death . 
  nobody surrendered . 
  yes we do . 
  tssssh ... do n't interrupt our circlejerk . 
  they have less conflicts with their neighbours . 
  also coastline helps ( tourism , trade , logistics ) . 
   what are you trying to say ? 
  that international did n't exist at that point , regardless of vienna and geneva ? 
  no , that it did n't work that way .
