  if you read plan barbarossa related documents , you can see that their plan ( as most of german military ` superplans ' thorough history ) has failed the first year . 
  they planned to advance positions to the line petersburg-moscow-rostov in august 1941 , by the end of the year to win the war . 
  accusations in this aspect against the leadership of the country normally come from anti-communist sources but have very questionable basis in facts . 
  it 's not assumption . 
  he is an historic figure . 
  if other one would be at the lead , he ( or she ) would receive the merit of saving us in our darkest hour . 
  while most of the people recognize crimes against humanity ( mostly their blood in one way or another ) during stalin rule , the salvation against complete extermination of all of us under germans is also attributed to him as the commander in chief of the country . 
   i gave you an example of the other country , like bosnia . 
  bosnia ? 
  where is that example ? 
   most of them if not all are closed down or reorganised for other purposes . 
  because the markets they were supplying to remained in the cis , and lithuanian government did n't applied to the cis for political reasons . 
  it 's not like the factories were worthless , it 's just the economical policy made them worthless , destroying achievements of the last half century and throwing the country into the turmoil for the next decade . 
   there are no 3rd world countries with market economies . 
  most of them are mixed economies . 
  that 's clearly untrue , unless you have some strange concept of ` mixed economy ' that fits your narrative . 
  but surely if apply it to also developed countries you will see that they also are mixed economies . 
  therefore it would be opposition not of ` open market economies ' versus ` planned economies ' but rather ` mixed economies ' vs ` planned economies ' because true open market economies do n't exist in nature . 
  in any case the main distinction point here would be the % of gdp that is spent by the governments . 
  and as [ we can see ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/gc.xpn.totl.gd.zs?order=wbapi_data_value_2012%20wbapi_data_value&amp;sort=asc ) plenty 3rd world countries have quite small budgets ratio compared to their economy size . 
   firstly , there is no such thing as western germany anymore . 
  obviously , so ? 
  you can still compare the data from west and east germany . 
   the support is kind of a hit or miss . 
  for example if you invest your given support to the social sector ( pensions , social aid , guarantees , etc. ), 
  like greece did , you are just burning that money . 
  it is nothing more when a waste . 
  they even sang about it in the eurovision . 
  on the other hand if you invest in the infrastructure , or quality of education . 
  you are guaranteeing yourself some sizable ... dividends , if you will . 
  what it has to do with the topic ? 
   scientithic theory dismisses ` what if ' cases as if they did n't existed . 
  unless it has some inpact on other outcomes . 
  any and all studies or comparisons do use scientithic theory as basis . 
  clearly , because of that i stated that only theoretical , but not anecdotal comparative would be viable . 
   judging from the direction lithuania was going at the time , it is estimated the lithuania would be around benelux country level . 
  based on what ? 
  you take some propaganda line from wikipedia that paints it all rosy colour and say something like that . 
  if you read about belgium history , you will see that they had very important industrial zones already in the 18th century ( see their industrialization history ) , ** based on their natural resources ** and also they had substantial ** colonial age ** during which they boosted their development by exploiting natives , starving them to death working , even cutting hands of their family members in mass to make them work . 
  the number of affected is [ estimated by millions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/congo_free_state#humanitarian_disaster ) . 
  also you forget that in 1926 lithuania had a coup which turned the country from a relative democracy into a right-wing dictatorship similar to what we see in south-western europe at the time . 
  the comparable country would be finland , also ex-russian province , independent at the same time . 
  but in any projection you can make lithuania would be much poorer for two main reasons : 1 . 
  resources : natural minerals , forests , people . 
  in everything finland is much wealthier than lithuania . 
  they also had a better start in industries ( which they already had from the imperial times , while lithuania was a village , agrarian country ) . 
  ww2 impact , there was no way in hell , that lithuania being between russia and germany would not be affected or barely affected ( like finland was ) . 
  therefore in any scenario lithuania would have been significantly poorer than finland and maybe even soviet union by the 80 's . 
   tell that o the uk . 
  since the end of the ww2 uk 's car industry was running on brasilian iron resouces . 
  it is not that uk does not have the resources itself though . 
  seriously ? 
  the most powerful country in the world until ww2 uk ? 
  the first industrialized country uk ? 
  the most resource-colonies until 60 's uk ? 
  the world trade routes master uk ? 
  it is a sin to even make such comparisons . 
  great britain was [ the first country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/industrial_revolution ) to overcome the agrarian phase because of it 's innovations and resources both from home and colonies . 
  and once you have the industry already existent and going you can search for best sources for the resources . 
   wrong again . 
  we do have some iron ore . again ? 
  as if i was mistaken before . 
  lithuania is a country with no natural resources . 
  obviously there are always some natural resources , but that does n't mean that they are extractable at economical break-even point , because of their quality , quantity , difficulty of extraction , etc. . . and that 's the point . 
  lithuania being an independent country would n't be able to industrialize like finland did it , because of the lack of resources . 
  only option would be something in lines of super-social-dumping ( like asian dragons did ) , so for example the level of life is half of polish and poles start to put factories in lithuania ( or russians , or germans ) . 
   can defend ussr as much as you want , but it will always be remembered as terror and dark times . 
  the topic initially was about planned economy . 
  go to the original comment :  it 's not like planned economy is something bad . 
  in my personal opinion planned economy can be much more efficient than one of open markets , and in the future countries will adopt it in one form or another . 
  would it really make a difference ? 
  let 's take independent yugoslavia - not part of comecon , could say that they also had planned economy . 
  did they manage to overreach somehow their neighbours ? 
  even if lithuania would be independent in political sense , it would be still 90-100 % dependent on russian resources and russian/polish markets . 
  unless as i stated before some miracle would happen , and an european tiger would have flourished . 
  su actually invested in baltic states industry , gave jobs , economy real sector , etc. . . 
   because we were at same level of economy as other western nations . 
  finland would be prime example . 
  in the 80 's finland had slightly ( 20-25 % ) above ussr gdp per capita ppp adjusted . 
  but finland can not be compared to small countries like lithuania , since sectors like forest , metallurgy , car industry -- and all other heavy industry would just not be possible in such small countries with inexistent natural resources . 
  you just can not predict such things . 
  maybe lithuania would have become a european tiger with high tech production and investigation . 
  or would remained an agrarian state with some boat making industry and that 's it . 
   it 's hard to recover as being small nation compare to other smaller countries who manage to be independent , who got aid from marshals plan after ww2 . 
  but marshal plan has nothing to do with the economy system , rather the allies of us received such package ( mutually beneficial ) for some concessions . 
  because that is historical aspect or political , but you can not condemn a centralized planned economy system based on that someone had n't received some aid because of that . 
  ua would rather sell their existent stocks which are genuine . 
   no , but we have this thing called statistics . 
  funny thing though , lithuanian western-sceptics claim it 's falsified . 
  although they ca n't support thier claim somehow . 
  strange ... how can you prove system fault with statistics when not in optimal experimental conditions ? 
  with same luck you could take either 3rd world country with market economy or with plan economy and state that the country 's flows are based on it 's economy system . 
  or you could take examples of eastern and western germany , north and south korea , etc. . . those at first glance would be good examples of system comparatives but later you study in detail and see that in those examples both south korea and western germany received substantial aid for political reasons . 
  therefore such comparisons could only be done when comparing two countries which did n't have significant political involvement . 
  for example , cuba with dominican republic or haiti . 
  in any case the only valid methodology would be actually theoretical reasoning , because when applied in practice just too many factors too actually say ` what if ' . 
  for example , what makes you thing that lithuania if you had n't have the soviet system would be richer in 1991 than it was ? 
  also why lithuania right now is not as rich as it should , when even after most devastating wars most countries under stable had recovered in under 10 years ? 
   that sounds so simple . 
  thanks , now i am going to open some factories .
