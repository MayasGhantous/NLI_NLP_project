  this point serves to illustrate that not only there was n't tension between russia and nato but the situation was fine even under putin during his fist term . 
  and it were the unitelar actions by nato in the mid 00 's that have broken the relations , therefore justifying in eyes of russian public countermeasures . 
   i am not sure where this argument actually leads . 
  there was political agreement to not accept new members in nato after reunification of germany . 
  that political agreement was n't formalized into memorandum . 
  by accepting new eastern members nato send various signals : * any promise or agreement by the west can not be trusted . 
  * nato is breaking the parity of forces in europe by accepting members that they can never effectively protect but will use them as buffer states between old members and russia . 
  therefore undermining our security to increase their own . 
   really ? 
  those are nato aggressions against russia ? 
  i am fairly certain that any neutral observer would strongly disagree . 
  though they might be threatening to putin and his regime , since they could lead by example . 
  because you think that those ` revolutions ' are something spontaneous that the majority of population wanted . 
  while in reality us sponsors through ngo 's and other ways both civilian opposition and radicals . 
  when the moment is right civilian opposition starts unrest which are joined by trained radicals causing the need of using police force . 
  since using police force always leads to casualties - those are exploited in foreign and local press to achieve even larger amount of supporters . 
  leaving the government two choices : either do nothing and be crashed by radical fighters hiding in the crowd or try suppress the unrest . 
  if the unrest is suppressed , then rinse and repeat , if not - it will grow until scenario 1 happens . 
  those revolutions main goal is to replace local government with the one loyal to us goals . 
  and we see how it happened : - in georgia in 2003 ( not a very good example , but first in our vicinity ) ; - in ukraine in 2004 ; - in kyrgyzstan in 2005 ; - in uzbekistan in 2005 ( failed ) ; - in belarus in 2006 ( failed ) ; - in armenia in 2008 ( failed ) ; - in moldova in 2010 ; - in ukraine in 2014 ; to that add that there were russian fleet bases already established ( or being constructed/recovered ) in syria , libya and yemen . 
  that + clear foreign sponsored ngo participation in russian unrest after elections in 2011 . 
  makes immense majority in russia that any participation of foreigners in our politics is not done in good faith , but to push their own agenda . 
  you talk about eu membership and prosperity . 
  ok , where is prosperity in georgia ? 
  they had regime changed in 2003 , and their leaders were always pro-eu , just after 2003 they also turned anti-russia . 
  what has been done in 12 years ? 
  nothing , those regime changes only suit political agenda , they do n't bring prosperity . 
  when will romania or bulgaria will have german level of prosperity ? 
  what is being done for that purpose ? 
  ah ... it 's not even a purpose . 
  well then , carry on . 
   though because of the current technical nature of the problem ( no abm system in the forseeable future would be able to withstand a russian attack with mirvs and decoys can not if russia makes the first strike . 
  if a preventive nuclear strike is made against russia , then it 's not so clear . 
  and that 's the scary part , the aa-missiles are easily dual purposed . 
  and therefore nato could be creating a quick nuclear strike group in europe ( against inf treaty ) without our knowledge . 
  how could we be sure it 's not the case if our inspectors are not allowed in the objects ? 
   you think so ? 
  i have n't seen nuclear drones yet . 
  what the difference - a war head is a war head . 
  inf clearly goes against that type of missiles nuclear or not . 
  to upgrade the war heads to tactical nuclear or even strategic in certain models would be no problem since the tech already exists and being developed . 
   where did nato violated a treaty and undermined russias interests ? 
  imho , this is putin 's game . 
  of course it 's putin 's game , and nato by it 's unfriendly acts plays into that narrative . 
  i 'll show you how : * nato sponsors colour revolutions in neighbour countries * - they want to make a coup in russia to stop our development and take our resources for free , like in the 90 's ; * nato breaks abmt treaty * - they want to undermine nuclear parity ; * nato install aa missiles in europe * - they could be installing fast-strike nuclear weapons against inf * nato is creating drones * - they are developing weapons against inf to undermine nuclear parity * nato intervenes in iraq and libya * - you see they intervened in functioning relatively wealthy countries and now they are shitty failed-states with people dying everyday . 
  do you want russia to become a failed-state ? 
  * us spending on weapons 10 times more than we do and have a dozen aircraft carriers * - who do they want to invade ? 
  why do they need such a force ? 
  and so on . 
  propaganda for militarization against possible nato aggression is very easy in russia because 95 % of said is true , factual information with far-fetched conclusions . 
  how can western countries help to cool down the situation ? 
  purpose a true common security system for whole europe . 
  invite russia to join common missile system . 
  what russians can do to help cool down the situation ? 
  right now - there are no ways . 
  anyone purposing to make first step towards the west will be seen as traitor . 
  and even if putin is gone tomorrow the ideas that state propaganda has imprinted will remain for at least a decade . 
   the russian central bank or do we have to expect waves of bankruptcies and more economic downfall ? 
  that depends on the russian government politics entirely in my opinion . 
  here are some facts : * our government foreign debt is virtually non-existent ( less than $ 40bn ) . 
  * russian total foreign debt is estimated at around [ $ 550bn ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/external-debt/forecast ) at the moment . 
  * our international reserves are estimated in [ $ 350bn ] ( http://www.cbr.ru/eng/hd_base/?prtid=mrrf_m ) . 
  * russian federation trade surplus is between [ $ 150-200bn ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/263634/trade-balance-of-goods-in-russia/ ) each year depending on oil prices . 
  * most of the surplus goes to the government because oil/gas export fee + most of the companies are state-owned . 
  * each year russian companies and government has to pay around $ 100-150bn of foreign debt , until is extinct ( in 2017 ) . 
  given that the oil price remain the same ( crucial factor ) . 
  oil and gas companies can repay their own debt in most cases without problem . 
  the rest of the companies and banks can be easily saved by the government if they consider it their priority . 
  but it might not happen . 
  and there are two scenarios : 1 . 
  oil and gas prices fall even more ( for example , brent oil < $ 40 bar ) , then it would present a problem , even if it is a priority . 
  government decides not to aid or restructure the debt of private companies this way effectively bankrupting them . 
  this way effectively changing their owners to government related for fraction of the price . 
   but on putin ? 
  what is the correct response to putin ? 
  is there one ? 
  putin was # 1 us ally after 9/11 : creating logistic routes of supply through russia and our [ csto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collective_security_treaty_organization ) allies , giving our contacts , intelligence , permitting invasion of afghanistan in un security council ... what happened after that ? 
  ok , i wo n't enter in nato expansion in 2004 . 
  but colour revolutions , regime changes , illegal invasions and assassinations of leaders/dictators that were contrary to us external policy ? 
  that would press anyone 's buttons . 
  also us withdrawal from abmt was a real big thing , like if russia just now withdraws from start . 
  it was downplayed by western media , but this was very serious . 
  and later the aa shield in europe - russian federation asked for years to participate or at least let it 's observers for periodical inspections . 
  also with 0 results . 
  then there is also drone program which clearly violates inf treaty . 
  putin 's foreign aggressive policy is ** justified in eyes of russian public ** precisely because of nato/us actions that violate our treaties , step on the nuclear parity and undermine our interests . 
   ok , so the b1 routinely flying a mile from russian airspace would be the same as it being on the ground at a base to you ? 
  you see no difference ? 
  if we had them placed , say in cuba - then it would be the same . 
  not that you are wrong , but your alliance nato is not helping the issue either . 
   it 's not about the real danger but about the agressive message straight from the last century which , together with his recent land grab and proxy war , leaves a really bad taste in my mouth . 
  the bombers begun to flight again in the mid 00 's . 
   but he is not patrolling your borders . 
  notice the difference ? 
  there is the idea of parity . 
  right now us have enormous nuclear and conventional advantage over us , because of those bases . 
  + nato is creating an aa global system excluding us from it . 
  the only way to stop the escalation is taking in account our interests . 
  the title does n't do justice to the article , which explains in detail :  the torrential outflow of cash was driven ** by debt repayments ** and a severe fall in investor confidence amid western sanctions and a steep drop in the price of oil , russia 's chief export . 
  it 's not just the investors leaving , is also means , that our companies are paying their debts to the western bankers without ability to refinance with those banks again because of sanctions .
