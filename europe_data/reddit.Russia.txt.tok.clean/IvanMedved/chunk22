  as you can see in [ this chart ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/external-debt/forecast ) . 
  which is bad , but not as bad would be case of $ 110bn of real investments leaving . 
  it is estimated 90 % debt , 10 % investors leaving , which is still huge . 
  what would that mean for our economy ? 
  it means that of our estimated trade surplus from this year ( around $ 200bn ) more than half will return to the west without any beneficial effect in our economy . 
  which is better than in 2014 when the equivalent of all our trade surplus left the country because of investors fleeing or companies paying debts . 
   from a european perspective , it 's equivalent to nuclear weapons in kaliningrad or crimea . 
  there are no nuclear weapons in krolewiec or crimea . 
  but taking in consideration the current circumstances there might be in the future . 
   which has a different quality than bombers . 
  you sense that tingling when there is tu-160 somewhere in the skies ready to erase you and all you love from existence in under 30 min ? 
  well maybe i also am , because there is a b-1 lancer stationed in a vicinity country that might do the same to me . 
  deal with it , or join non-proliferation movement . 
   that is something the western press rarely if ever reports . 
  i did n't know nato is flying nuclear bomber patrols along the russian airspace . 
  nato flies reconnaissance aircrafts normally . 
  but western press only informs , when they are [ intercepted too roughly ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-protest-unsafe-intercept-of-reconnaissance-plane-by-russian-fighter-jet-1428835391 ) . 
  nato bombers do n't patrol because there are already nuclear weapons stationed in turkey , germany and alaska . 
  instead spy planes fly around our borders , planes that are not covered by the mutual surveillance treaty ( open skies ) . 
  so did the frequency of nato flights/ship patrols . 
  it is something that has been done by both parties since the cold war era with small breaks . 
  only recently the media begun to sensationalise it again . 
  next low - name yushchenko as governor of dnepropetrovsk . 
  hmmm ... true . 
  your wise words will be reported to my kgb supervisor . 
   that seems to be the current logical path . 
  no , because if we apply your methodology , then we can not call nazis those who live in countries that are already our puppets . 
  but i give you a ` b - ' for effort . 
   just turning ? 
  i thought that 's what it means 90 % of times russians say it no , not there yet . 
  now slowly any nationalist if being regarded a nazi , and also anyone who says anything bad about soviet government , communism , etc. 
  also the word most commonly used is fascism , but in this case it would be more correct , because under socialist ideology fascism has it 's own definition different from the one from democratic ideology . 
  ** edit ** : also , you latvians are not helping the issue :p, 
  what a joke . 
  ` nazis ' are turning in the same ` terrorists ' turned for the west - people we do n't like . 
  oh man , this is classic . 
   yeah , screw babies , w\u00f6rk more . 
  w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk !, 
  nothing can go wrong . 
  and then import turks to compensate for population loss . 
  those in russia who mock democracy in russia like to remind their opponents of that particular parliamentary procedure in rzeczpospolita and it 's consequences . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6satcx4qdkq ) . 
  ** edit : ** * when asked about freedom of press putin replied that : `` like in a famous italian film a true man always must insist and the woman must resist ... '' *, 
  this reminds me of how putin once said that '' * it 's a boy thing to insist , and it 's a girl thing to resist * '' . 
  ok then , carry on . 
   so , when i 'm telling the truth about how russia invaded ukraine and is fueling war in eastern ukraine right now - it 's somehow bad ? 
  why ? 
  i make reference to specific type of people whose posts normally are featured in / r/tumblrinaction for our amusement . 
  it is not . 
  i propose a method and apply this method to existing information and invite anyone who does not agree for a debate . 
  i did , but he is like ... not very known . 
  definitely not leading critic , but indeed is a critic of the system . 
  i 'm wondering if [ hardcore ] ( https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hardcore-the-first-ever-action-pov-feature-film#/story ) ( also crowd-funded action-movie-parody ) will be so cool . 
   got to be an irl troll , surely . 
  or maybe some kind of performance art ? 
  or you know , just a bit craaa ~ zy . 
  like all those androgins from / r/tumblrinaction, 
  we actually do n't want to conquer all of europe . 
  oh man , you have like ... dozen of comments every day and 99 % of them about how russia is evil . 
  i do n't think i 'll be able to have a sane conversation with you . 
  i 'll go mad , and that taking in account that i already read censor and korrespondent . 
   please name three highly reputable russian sources . 
   they claimed 5 things , and 4 of them were definitely wrong . 
  that 's a fact . 
  please name , or at least provide a link . 
   besides you forgot to mention russian media shitstorm where they invented some spanish airspace officer who ` had proof ' that ukraine did that . 
  well they did n't quite invent him , because the man exists . 
  his name is carlos , he carried twitter.com/spainbuca account for years before euromaidan . 
  and it seems that he worked in borispol airport . 
  you can check that there are snapshots of his tweets in archive.org from march 2014 and there were in the internet screencaps from 2013 and 2012 from the same tweeter proving that he worked in borispol ( kiev ) . 
  but the common opinion right now in russian segment of the net is that the messages were lies , because of [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prfcqqvbzf4 ) , which is from may 8 , 2014 . 
  in which he states that he left ukraine with his family in fear for his life . 
  so the current accepted version , is that he in vengeance posted those tweets to fuck with ukrainian government reputation . 
  independently of anything else . 
   one german newspaper went for that and claimed that ukrainian pilot confessed he shot mh17 . 
  reliable sources you say ? 
  i stated , that we should assume that all sources have agenda , and will lie to fulfil it . 
  the difference is the willingness to risk the public trust . 
  i my opinion about that matter in [ another thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/37jhqi/russias_army_is_massing_troops_and_hundreds_of/crnjl7k ) . 
  for anyone who is interested , and not too emotional . 
   i mean professional soldiers versus butchers , bakers and candlestick-makers . 
  from where you take such silly assumption ? 
  most part of the male population passed through draft service , many of those in ukraine who has 45 years and more served in afghanistan and saw real combat . 
  if we assume that the rebels took hold of a buk launcher , then it would be no problem finding ex-draftees in their region or in russia that had experience with it , or hire mercenaries . 
  or ask through russian military contacts to give them a couple of specialists , not that i know anything about that . 
   you 're attempting to use fear of a russian invasion as an ameliorating factor for the insurrection 's actions in shooting down the plane ? 
  that 's an interesting tactic . 
  no , but there could be military exercise going wrong , like in 2001 . 
   if kiev believed it was in danger from a land-invasion it would mobilize for total war it currently does , they have third round of mobilization right now . 
  and a year ago all of their combat-ready army ( around 30 000 ) were already in donbass . 
  also , aa systems needed in case russia would want to bomb the shit out of ukrainian army like allies did in libya not long ago . 
  to pave the way for the rebels . 
   i 'll ask you for a source for strelkov 's claims , although i probably would n't trust the rebel 's word either way . 
  their credibility in this is not high . 
  [ discussion about the said group ] ( https://forum-antikvariat.ru/index.php/topic/204348-voennye-svodki-s-yugo-zapadnogo-fronta/page-18#entry2150701 ) on the antikvar forum . 
  \u041a\u043e\u0442\u044b\u0447 , who is strelkov ( igor ivanovich girkin ) , says that he is not registred in vkontakte and did n't gave right to anyone to publish in his name . 
  in may 2014 . 
  link on [ icorpus ] ( http://icorpus.ru/zayavlenie-strelkova-bespoletnuyu-zonu/ ) denouncing that group later , [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbst_w0eos0 ) proofing icorpus being the only official source . 
   again you can say whatever you like . 
  the buk was pictured in rebel hands in rebel territory being transported to russia .
