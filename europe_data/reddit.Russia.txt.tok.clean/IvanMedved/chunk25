  i 'll see how you laugh when your country education rank goes from # 1 to # 20 because of lack of funds . 
  some stupid flash mob / hidden advertisement . 
  austerity does n't quite work . 
  it 's just a way for neo-liberals to push their agenda and reduce social welfare in european states . 
   ah , yes , you are right . 
  still , ~ 75 ( or 25 , if only count from the independence ) years is plenty to learn the state language . 
  they do know state language , they just want their own heritage to be preserved . 
  is like , if during russian empire we would insist to everyone to learn russian , and only russian to be the state language of all regions ... oh , wait ... we did that . 
  but we are still hated for that . 
  in any case thanks for your insight . 
  through poles i had my insight of what latvians and estonians more or less think about russians without the bias of `` gulag , gulag , kladbishe , smert '' . 
  yes , i do n't deny that . 
  but i still insist that logic about : `` people , who leave their countries because they do n't like living in them , then they come to another country '' is not applicable . 
  vilnius was part of lithuania perhaps since foundation ( xii-xiii c. ) , but then it was also part of poland in the commonwealth for more than 5 hundred years . 
  poles came there in all that time of common country , do you really see them as foreign migrants ? 
   i do n't understand people , who leave their countries because they do n't like living in them , then they come to another country and inside it they start `` building '' a small version of their home country , which was the thing they were trying to get away from . 
  but only reason vilnius is part of lithuania , is because soviet union took it from poland in 1939 , not because some poles migrated there recently . 
  those poles who live there are mostly descendant from migrants when poland and lithuania were unified country . 
   but the tzar did have alliances , which were broken by the communist revolution . 
  see ? 
  rewriting history is a questionable way of justifying one 's deeds . 
  tsar had alliances in 1915 , but those were provisional . 
  it 's not about rewriting history , i do n't think you get the point . 
  what you are trying to do , is rewrite events from the past period of time . 
  what i stated is that provided that all the past events remain the same , but only ideology would be different - the results for post-war germany would be quite more severe . 
  without intent of provocation . 
  why would n't you create an autonomy with language rights for polish minority , since they are all centred around vilnius ? 
   but would the tzar have betrayed his allies to sign the molotov-ribentropp agreement ? 
  which allies ? 
  soviet union had no allies in europe at the time : poland , romania and finland were seen as foes who during civil war in former russia ( soviet union later ) annexed parts of it to suit their geo-political interests . 
  great britain and france did n't agree to form such alliance with soviet union , and after they created similar pacts themselves there was no significant alternative for soviet leadership to do . 
  or you think that france or britain could be trusted after the munich betrayal ? 
  do you ? 
  the war with nazi germany was unavoidable , everyone in soviet leadership was conscious about it . 
  if you study the documents at the time - you can see hundreds of factories and millions of people being prepared for evacuation since mid 1930 's . 
  so when the war started the machines were just loaded into the train containers and transported to the urals and siberia ( not in all cases of course ) . 
  if we had a monarchy , then the leadership surely would go for the same priorities : recover territories taken by neighbours during civil war , postpone the hostilities with germany as much as possible . 
  and preferably let the western potencies deal with it . 
  no one knew that france would be defeated so fast , and uk would be so passive . 
  what is your opinion about poland ? 
   like the western allies ? 
  no , because the nazi forces did n't commit massive crimes against humanity in western countries , apart from unavoidable dose of rape and pillage , but this consequence of any enemy army entering a city . 
  in case of soviet union over [ 20 million civilians died ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost ) , over 5 million people [ were enslaved ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ost-arbeiter ) and shipped to either be workers in farms and factories or a toy thing for rich germans . 
  similar numbers go for poland in proportion to their population . 
  and in a lesser , but important degree to yugoslavia and czechoslovakia . 
  now imagine the victims of those crimes entering eastern germany , people who liberated places like auschwitz and saw the piles of bodies , people who encountered and liberated slaves sharing their stories of abuse . 
  can you imagine what those people would do , if the main ideology would n't be that '' ** the germans were the first victim of nazism ** '' created and propagated by the communist party ? 
  in any other scenario , in which the victors from the east posses another ideology ( monarchy , fascism , nationalism , even democracy ) your people would be in best case scenario assimilated to polish/russian and those who refuse - subjected to deportation . 
  and in worst case scenario ... well you can imagine . 
  no , my point is that any other ideology would go in range from mirroring all that germans did in the east to a complete wipe out . 
  all the things considered , imagine if it were n't commies in charge of russia at the time . 
  what would be the outcome in this case ? 
  why you choose crazy people ? 
   why does russia need protection against this ? 
  because our propaganda is of very low quality and our government is corrupt . 
  but it does n't mean that it is the worst possible case . 
  go back 20 years and you will see why . 
  those ngo could be used to stage a coup like in many other countries ( see colour revolutions ) . 
   the entire world will be moving towards renewable resources , natural resources will become less and less important solar energy is already very advanced , the problem is the batteries . 
  because right now we still need liquid fuel . 
  so if you ever see in the news that somebody invented ' [ supercapacitor ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supercapacitor ) ' then know that mother russia is fucked , unless we invent one ourselves first . 
   you are correct , but if you were to check the projections with actual results then you would notice that the difference is minimal . 
  will see , will see   the chart was updated last month and even though it is based on projections , they still account for current developments hence the performance of russia . 
  what i saw using this google tool , is that when it says ` updated in 2015 ' it means that at least one data set was updated , but others could have not . 
  for example , the fall of russia and ukraine is much deeper than represented by the dotted lines . 
  and the period of slow growth was foreseen actually , because we had foreign capital exit at it 's high even before euromaidan ( as well as other developing markets ) . 
  [ full version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqmxb-hkb-e ), 
   that is absolutely not the problem . 
  the problem is that the law is vague . 
  not so frequent to see someone who understands the theory of law on reddit . 
  and you are correct - the division between `` undesirable '' and lawful ngos is very vague and is subjected to abuse . 
  but unfortunately there is no other way to protect russia against lobbyists from eu or usa who can push ( and are actually doing it in other parts of the world ) their agendas through those ngos . 
  on the bright side , there * is * a very specific part of the law that makes it only applicable to those ngos which receive money from abroad . 
  so the organizations who can and want to operate in good faith -- just have to stop accepting money from foreign sources . 
  dae thinks that this is prelude to include australia in a common trade union with eu ? 
  sorry , but i do n't see the point in speculating about rumours . 
  russia was n't prepared ? 
  of course not , the revolution/coup was totally unexpected . 
  but our army has been heavily modernized since 08.08.08 war and is always prepared . 
  and even then , compare situation of self-proclaimed republics now and in case if they had backing of russian and part of ukrainian army . 
  i sincerely do n't see how yanukovich was a puppet , also there other questions incompatible with him being putin 's slave , like he did n't privatized some of ukrainian strategic assets our government was eyeing for the last decade ( gas tube , gas storage , refineries , chemical and steel productions ... ) or that he did n't let us increase the fleet group in crimea . 
  and so , and so on . 
   you also realize that because of you already have natural resources you are not required to import them as you have your own . 
  yes , but because of the constant cash-inflow of the foreign currency our products are always more expensive than foreign ones ( because external trade creates foreign currency surplus , which makes it cheaper ) . 
  once the surplus from oil and gas starts to fade we will be able to compensate with other sectors and industries . 
  in fact russia is self-sufficient in most type of products except some of high tech and machinery . 
  the important thing is that the prices of oil and gas will fade gradually , not like in 2014 when oil fell almost 3 times . 
   why would it not ? 
  what do you think will happen ? 
  the country who 's economy nearly collapsed after annexing a peninsula that went to shit after annexation will annex all of ukraine ? 
  i sincerely do n't know . 
  [ 12 points from russia goes to russia ] ( https://youtu.be/dqmxb-hkb-e?t=49s ) , problem / r/europe ? 
  i agree with you , pokymonn thinks from perspective of a moldavian , but he does n't consider that ukraine ( if it remains as it is in the next years ) wont like to have transnistria , while budjak is a strategic region . 
  while from pan-romanian perspective getting bukovina is as important as getting moldova back . 
  but this one is also from 2013 , they just used the dash line for their projections . 
  just see ukraine on the line , for example . 
  russian oil and gas is not like in saudi arabia , where you can stick a drinking straw in the sand and you will have your oil of highest purity flowing over the place . 
  to get resources in russia you need to build thousands km of pipes , make super difficult exploration first from space , then from aircraft and lately on the ground . 
  also the extraction and purification is much more complicated .
