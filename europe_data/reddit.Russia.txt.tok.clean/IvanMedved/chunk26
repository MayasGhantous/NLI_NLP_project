  but even then exports of natural resources is only 15 % of our economy . 
  and the money ( yet with much stealing ) goes into development of tech , science , industries ... 
  not bad , but not at best of our potential . 
  i personally blame ~ ~ jews and ~ ~ corruption . 
  once we sort it out -- we will grow even more . 
  belarus is doing [ better than most of the balkan countries ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_kd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:rom:blr:alb:ksv:mkd:mne:srb:bgr:hrv:bih&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=643500000000&amp;tend=1369346400000&amp;ind=false ) , for example . 
  and balkan countries do n't have much relationship with russia since the fell of the comecon dismantlement . 
  ex-yugo was n't even in the trade block . 
  the main problem with ukraine and moldova is that they started to break relationship with russia without having alternative . 
  while baltic states , for example - first thing they did , they started to create exports alternatives in europe , and only then pissing off their eastern neighbour . 
  but you can not say that russia is suffocating it 's allies ( belarus and kazakhstan ) because both are doing well , and the fact they have a little less gdp ppp per capita than us , is not a proof of any sort of exploitation , like the difference in the same parameters between countries of old europe and new europe does n't prove that old eu is suffocating it 's newest members . 
   why did the association talks end abruptly because russian representatives read the draft of the agreement and stated that it is incompatible with existing trade agreements with [ cis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commonwealth_of_independent_states ) countries . 
  to which eu representatives stated that russia should mind it 's own business . 
  and the aa wo n't be modified to suit russian needs . 
  to which russia stated that either cis current agreement with ukraine or association agreement with eu has to be modified . 
  i do n't want to go in too much detail but it has to do with the possibility of european goods avoiding commonwealth border taxes through ukraine and something had to be done . 
  since neither part wanted to budge yanukovich called to a halt and public discussion of the agreement with eu . 
   why do the russians offer him asylum ? 
  why not ? 
  he was an ally , shitty , but ally -- not a puppet . 
  and his actions after he left for russia show exactly that . 
  imagine you are putin and you want to invade/control ukraine , your puppet ( in this hypothetical case ) is overthrown . 
  you evacuate him from crimea , what not is the most logical thing to do ? 
  return him to kharkov region and create parallel ` government in exile ' . 
  make him declare marshal law and order ukrainian army to form groups under your command . 
  also ask russian federation for military assistance and locals to create volunteer battalions . 
  russian military crosses border on legal basis , they form a task force to march on kiev . 
  but yanukovich lost his popularity , what to do ? 
  assassinate him , blame ` kiev junta ' and replace with somebody more charismatic and more controllable . 
  march on kiev and take the city . 
  let the western regions of the country form resistance and let them secede de facto . 
  voil\u00e0 -- ukraine under control , joins customs unions , etc. 
  why something like this was n't done ? 
  not this plan , not similar yanukovich was n't used at all . 
  if he was such a puppet of putin , he could be used in many many ways , but it was n't done . 
  but russia is doing alright . 
  how can this be ? 
  is that hopes for reunification with glorious ~ ~ russ ~ ~ romania ? 
  or fear of civil war in transnistria and/or gagauzia ? 
  [ why ? 
  ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_kd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:rus:rom:pol:ukr:blr:lva:ltu:est:mda&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=643500000000&amp;tend=1369346400000&amp;ind=false ), 
  well you did have one of the largest debt per capita among our trading block ( [ comecon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comecon ) ) . 
  while i acknowledge that yanukovich was the most ` pro-russian ' president in all of ukrainian history , i personally do n't see direct russian control over him . 
  if it was such , while talks about eu association in first place ? 
  or why did n't he dispersed euromaidan like we have our protests ( of similar size or bigger dispersed ? ) . 
  why agree on resolution purposed by the european union ? 
  etc, 
  what type and level of control ? 
  well , you could be close to the russian border and the isis . 
  such is life , comrade . 
  because spain is way too far from russian borders . 
  basically he is saying that he and his comrade are spies . 
  why ? 
  the question would be in estimating the numbers . 
  if there have been more then 3000 ukrainian troops in captivity of the `` republics '' and a bit less than 2000 separatists in captivity of ukrainian authorities ( or around 10 % of the total active group by either side at a time ) . 
  then how much russian troops are present in the eastern ukraine , if this is third case of ukrainian authorities capturing anyone related to russian military forces ? 
  man , do n't be a stereotype . 
  it 's a joke . 
   think of them as our ukraine just with the hatred not being real do n't find this comparation accurate . 
  the hatred is real , but only among very specific segment of the population . 
  most have bad feelings toward putin , but not russians in general . 
  think of this like sweds and danes . 
  in other news estonia just recieved their refugee quota . 
  otherwise us may sink their ship in your territorial waters and declare you war for it . 
  well , i 'm the exception that confirms the rule . 
  they be like '' ... hungary likes poland ? '', 
  nobody else does . 
  is this a [ question ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/is\u2013ought_problem ) of be or ought to be ? 
  actual remark for all the time and generations . 
   considering that millions of people were killed during the russian communist experiment that was based on fundamental atheism no . 
  the law of three spikelets is from 1932 , the nationalization of property mostly happened during civil war and was enforced after . 
  so we are talking early 20 's . 
  the law of spikelets was to protect the cooperatives which were busted by the state money : first , because they got a lot of production goods , like tractors , seed drill , pumps , grain elevators , mills ... 
  some of those production items were very attractive to independent farmers . 
  second , independent farmers , mostly so called kulaks were run out business , nobody wanted to work for them anymore even with mild cohesion , so they had to use even more violence and force to try to retain their way of life . 
  therefore cooperatives needed the protection . 
  the law is n't related to the hunger of winter 1932-1933 because it was applied equally in all soviet union , but only southern part was affected ( ukraine , southern russia and northern kazakhstan ) . 
   which is very similar to a name of oppressive soviet law that basically started holodomor so a law that punished theft of state property started holodomor ? 
   i 'd be interested to see your source on gmo pesticides being venom . 
  call it poison then . 
  you are being too miscellaneous . 
   good thing that gmo pesticides are among the safest in existence . 
  that is out of context , there can be multiple pesticides applied to gmo products that were develop to resist them . 
   pesticides are n't venom . 
  pesticides are literally venom for the weeds , insects or fungi . 
  the effects on human health depends in each and every case of pesticide type and concentration . 
  some pesticides ( which are no longer are used mostly ) can be so effective , that were used in concentration camps for mass extermination . 
   gmos actually reduce the use of pesticides some may . 
  that 's the reason why it should be heavily regulated . 
   can anyone eli5 why genetic modified food is bad ? 
  there are strains modified to be able to hold more pesticides ( venom ) without dying , therefore can be applied more pesticides , therefore the people who eat specific crop or plant could ingest more pesticide . 
  in theory . 
  no , by the time estonians started shooting it has already passed 2 days . 
   italy : so weak :( well compared to china we are all weak [ khe-khem ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp ) . 
  it was n't insignificant , it just was outside roman empire . 
  and slavs are a new name . 
  the article literally talks about how finns parook in siege , for example :  in fact the german and finnish armies maintained the siege together until january 1944 , but there was little , or no systematic shelling or bombing from the finnish positions . 
  however there was a conflict of interests , since after defeat of ussr the land was to go to finland . 
  and germans wanted to demolish all of the city so no memory of russia remains , while finish leadership wanted to conserve the city , by maintaining the blockade until all of the population starve . 
   i wish the united states had done more to help finland .
