  you are aware that finland fought on the nazis side , are you ? 
  also their forses took part in siege of st petersburg which lead over one million people to die from starvation . 
  posts like this are completly disgusting and make me sick . 
  he said manned , heavy angara without humans on board is scheduled in 3 years . 
  so when it is something good -- it is ukrainian people achievement . 
  if it is something bad -- evil moskals fault , even if all parties responsable are in both cases from ukraine . 
  why ? 
   action taken by then-part of ussr against ukraine how is it action taken by ussr against ukraine , what russia has to do with it ? 
   technically , non-standard drills that were conducted that day , were ordered from the main atomic authority in moscow . 
  the non-standard drills or better said safety experiment was ordered from moscow , but the experiment protocol was overridden from kiev and because of the delays another ( unprepared ) shift had to perform it . 
  what has russia to do with it ? 
  gulag for everyone who disturbs peace . 
  you can submit yourself to russia , we will fix this . 
   they are just afraid you . 
  if they are afraid of us , why they try to undermine us at every step they can . 
  would n't be logical to be like finland , nice and quiet neighbour minding their own business . 
  as long as i 'm aware there is no route that goes through those countries , they have their own separate supply pipes . 
  edit : [ a map ] ( http://cdn14.img22.ria.ru/images/16086/59/160865990.jpg ), 
   czechia , poland and slovakia will lose money cos of it -- protest logical . 
   hungary , romania and croatia want s. stream instead -- logical . 
   estonia , latvia and lithuania just to fuck with us :(, 
  why is that ? 
  if anything it would prop to change debt2shares ratio in the favour of the debt . 
  there must be connection points . 
  so ukraine is soviet now ? 
  he said fascist , not racist . 
  those are not the most . 
  in any case let 's start from the basics . 
  first one must read the [ definition ] ( https://treaties.un.org/pages/overview.aspx?path=overview/glossary/page1_en.xml#provisional ) of the term on the un homepage . 
   the obligations relating to provisional application are undertaken by a conscious voluntary act of the state consistent with its ** domestic legal framework ** . 
  which basically means that provisional application has a residual character . 
  for example , if there is a domestic law that can be interpreted in two ways and one way is in accordance with the treaty that is being in state of provisional application -- that is the correct way to interpret it . 
  but unless so is said in domestic laws -- non-ratified international treaty has no direct application and therefore it is not binding the state . 
  that same principles can be seen in the [ ect article 45 ] ( http://www.energycharter.org/fileadmin/documentsmedia/legal/ectc-en.pdf ) :  ** article 45 : provisional application **  each signatory agrees to apply this treaty provisionally pending its entry into force for such signatory in accordance with article 44 , ** to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution , laws or regulations ** . 
  the same residual force i deduct from the explanation from un page . 
  the binding force in this case would be very limited : to the likes of first example i mention and maybe some actions performed by the executive branch , like assigning agreed quotas or monetary quantities to some end . 
  it should not have binding force in a strict way the treaties do , when those are ratified , because so is done by the legislative branch of the government . 
  in our case , the arbitration ruling used the charters of the ect above russian law , which is unthinkable . 
  that would be the first question . 
  another question why they should n't had the jurisdiction is because the other part are in fact russian citizens and not foreign investors . 
  the court forgets one of the most important principles of the law which is the predominance of the substance over the form . 
  do you have questions in regards to the quantity of the compensation , which is the main thing in which i personally think the court did n't just had another ( questionable ) opinion but actually committed negligence ? 
  we bought them from sweden . 
   i have a link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/provisional_application_ ( treaty ) too !, 
  those are not binding , if you disagree i can explain you in detail . 
   ok , seriously , the arbitration verdict is 600 pages long , and it was written by specialists in international arbitration law . 
  there are no obviously wrong things in it , otherwise the careers of those arbitrators would have met an abrupt and miserable end . 
  for each conflict legal scholars can have dozens opinions , but in this case it is clear as day , that the valoration of $ 50 billion is wrong both economically . 
  and also morally , since so called foreign investors ( in reality russian citizens behind offshore companies ) obtained yukos shares in a fraudulent way , stealing assets of russian people in the early 90 's . 
  mere signature does n't bound the state without ratification . 
  [ source ] ( http://ask.un.org/faq/14594 ) . 
  they also misinterpreted the treaty articles . 
  aside from the fact that ukos never had networth even close to $ 50bn , and at the moement of the discovery of the tax fraud and the subsidiaries fraud it net worth became negative ( the liabilities exceeded the assets ) . 
  there are so many things wrong with the arbitration verdict that i do n't know where to start and how structure all the information i know . 
  there are two more instances . 
  the arbitrators not just did n't had the jurisdiction , they also applied a non ratified treaty , and from my interpretation even then misused it 's rules . 
  justice at last . 
  in wonder if higher instances will confirm this resolution . 
  because he is pseudo-socialist populist . 
   trump seems to want to abandon japan , south korea , taiwan , europe and israel it seem to me that he wants some more contribution for american military expenditure to protect those regions . 
  after all they are in grave debt . 
   no i understood . 
  clearly you did not , however russian humour is very specific . 
  i do n't expect you to . 
   that would make us no better than them . 
  obviosly , you are mistaken about what i suggested . 
  one bullet at a time , tovarish , one bullet at a time . 
   citing a forestry official whom it described as an eye-witness , gazeta polska codziennie reported that the russian machines , flying low and in formation , entered several kilometres into polish territory . 
  probably just overflying the border , after all they have gps + glonass and polish forestry official may have just mistaken . 
   that 's completely retarded . 
  very well argumented point , others not so much . 
   by largest output by nominal gdp the united kingdom is fifth , not ninth , since brazil is ninth . 
  nominal means nothing when comparing countries , since it depends on the exchange rate of the currencies . 
  for example , if a country devaluate it 's currency , say 20 % , it does n't mean that the output of goods and services has decreased 20 % ( however the number of nominal gdp will ) . 
  therefore for comparising several countries you need to meassure all the goods and services produced in the same prices , that 's is why ppp coefficient is used . 
  uk nominal gdp in proportion to other countries is in better position than the real , because of the exchange rate ( that is also the main reason why your country is in such bad shape in the international trade ) . 
   the european union will not ` punish ' the united kingdom is it leaves . 
  that would be the action of a playground bully and the eu can not afford to look like a bully . 
  that is an emotional argument , however i put punish into '' '' , because eu will simply introduce trade restrictions similar it has with non-union countries like usa , russia or china . 
   moreover , the united kingdom trades with the rest of the world ( much of the time without any kind of trade agreement ) . 
  if the uk leaves the eu production and trade will reorientate around the new trade barriers and less strict regulations . 
  to do that a massive devaluation of # would be needed , since it is quite overpriced and right now uk can export only to developed countries : eu members and usa mostly . 
  exports to commonwealth and usa are already maximized , exports to eu due to brexit are going to fall and to export to developing nations you would need a cheap # . 
  anyhow i personally want brexit to happen , because i hate england . 
  it is obvious , right now uk is 9th world economy with 20 years of negative trade saldo . 
  if you exit eu , they will `` punish '' trade relationships with you , which would lead to stagnation in your economic growth . 
  if you exit eu you wont be in top10 in 10 years from now . 
   at which point russia will become our official ally ? 
  after all - pis ideology is like 90 % compatible , just replace `` catholic '' to `` orthodox '' . 
  meh , by the time united russia ( the party ) will be gone . 
  you will be all alone . 
  transportations shill detected . 
  because people are retarded ? 
  i do n't know what you expect me to say . 
  if he would have had similar conduct in a public space he would be convicted for public disturbance all the same . 
  the difference in this case is that it is aggravated because of the state protection of traditional faiths . 
   that 's how we 'll get lviv back to break from within . 
  i hope he gets way more years in prison than pussy riot did . 
  ** edit ** : for anyone wondering he urinated in the temple and then [ used the budda statue as a punching bag ] ( http://i.imgur.com/z5dmgoa.jpg ) . 
  did you drew moustache to the ukrainian dude ?
