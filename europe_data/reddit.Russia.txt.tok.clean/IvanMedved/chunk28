  not bolshevik , but would n't mind : , 
  except orthoxerox is a liberal and he said '' ** we ** 'll have to start the revolution ... just like ** 100 years ago ** '' obviously making reference to february liberal revolution of 1917 . 
  the one which failed . 
  your revolution will fail , as anything that liberals put their hands on . 
  then we will see , because that would be next step in the escalation . 
  so it is a threat to escalate it even further . 
  curiously many us states have recognized nagorno . 
  points to the power of armenian diaspora i guess . 
  america ? 
  what ... did you by any chance misread armenia as america ? 
  i mentioned armenia for a reason , they are part of a defensive pact with russian federation , so russian government has legal basis and the duty to defend them . 
  the problem with karabkh is that even they do n't recognize it as an international entity . 
  so under current status quo all is going to rotate around minsk agreement ( not the one about ukraine ) . 
  unless armenia decides to lgally annex nagorno , then i do n't know what will happen . 
  humanitarian + russian troops ( which were stationed there under un mandate ) were attacked . 
   oh , i 'm just thinking if russia had enough political will to go and kick some serious isis butt to support their ally assad , can they step in militarily and put an end to this senseless conflict between two former soviet republics ? 
  not even armenia recognizes nagorno karabakh , on which ground can russia intervene right now ? 
   the wiki article provides references to works of acclaimed historians , you are free to acquire them and consult their sources . 
  the wiki sources historians who in their works mention the number souring memorial ogranization , which is foreign funded , anti-communist ogranization . 
  the reasearcher ( petrov ) in question is known by making absurd estimates . 
   you have no right to dismiss the work of historians from memorial either , they are literally infinitely more trustworthy than a personification of the where are proofs meme such as you . 
  they are an anti-communist organization run by ideologically biased people , and the article in question just mentions that number , `` by our data such and such '' , no sources , nothing . 
  if they researched the archives they could have taken certified copies of the source or at least give references . 
  it 's just that . 
  also so called `` polish operation '' is made up , during the great purge numerous social groups were checked sometimes in base on origin , but mostly on class and status . 
  mind you in the late 30 's the most of the executed were the executioners in the 20 's . 
   all the documents ordering the polish operation still existed safely in nkvd archives can you point out to online accesable one of them , which permits deduct such number of executed ? 
  because obviously there were operations against foreign intelegence operations , and one against polish agents , which probably lead to a couple hundreds arrested and convicted , not thousands and not the 139,835 people anticommunist propogandists from memorial made up . 
  someday we will find strengh to forgive your treason cousins . 
   ~ 700k displaced azerbaijanis and thousands massacred !, 
  that region ** never had more than 200k ** total population . 
  azers were 10-20 % through the history . 
   right , it 's really a very small part of the whole genocide of the polish people commited by the soviet union . 
  you are thinking of the polish operation of the nkvd  that 's a made up story by memorial , it has no basis in facts . 
  and if soviet union would stop at the border , then germans would probably wipe out all poles as per plan ost . 
  communist system is the most just amongs the existing ones and the economic disaster was caused by liberal policies in the 80 's . 
  if we talk about katyn tradegy , the most obvious conclusion is that germans executed the prisioners at some point , and decided to use it as propoganda in the moment , when soviet union was forming polish red army . 
  in the 90 's for political reasons ( anticommunism ) decided to to admit the guilt for this one , without basis on facts . 
  putin being anti-communist himself and in position of continuation of the liberal course can not deny it . 
  also in the 90 's and 00 's trying to improve relationship with poland meant that denying previous declarations would just bring more unneccesary conflict . 
  but now it can be spoken freely . 
  regarding stalin letter , among hundreds thousands of polish captured during liberation of western ukraine , western belarus and western lithuania -- some were to be charged for their crimes during the invasion and in the following years . 
  not related to ktayn . 
   in fact , all of them are seen as oppressors they really were in poland , raping , pillaging and killing millions . 
  that 's slander , without them there would be no poles left today . 
   katy\u0144 was a genocide act done by the soviet against polish . 
  the comparison is indecent . 
  even if commited by soviet , which i doubt , this act alone can not be considered genocide . 
  if poland demolishes soviet monuments that conmemorates victims and heroes of war it 's only logical to demolish katyn memorial .

   interesting since the adyge kingdom has been founded around 400 bc . 
  maybe my ancestors were existing and not existing at the same time before the 13th century ? 
  ok , maybe you can name in order adyge kings , say from 1000ad to 1200ad ? 
   i 'm not sure with whom you 're confusing circassians with , or if you 're lack of any knowledge on the subject but yet claiming some interesting things - maybe it 's still the boldness of the ignorance like thucydides stated centuries ago . 
  do you know that thucydides has also has n't existed in the ancient greece until the 13th century ? 
  ok , ok , i 'm not going to make fun out of you . 
  actually you only make fun of yourself . 
  ** thucydides talked about syracuse which is in sicily ( italy ) ** !, 
  i 'm so done talking to you . 
   northeastern caucasian peoples are the natives of northeastern caucasus circassians and crimean tatars come in 13th century to their ` native land ' and gradually replace and assimilate other people living there . 
  i can hardly call that native . 
   before that there was no dispute and russia was detached from caucasus for two centuries russia was bordering circassia and there were constant raids toward our don settlements . 
  also being protectorate of ottoman empire they waged war against us on sultan behalf . 
  not to mention that slavery was the pillar of circassia economy . 
   before that circassians and russians were even allies against persian and ottoman raids on some occasions yes , it is irrelevant . 
  only lasting alliance was during ivan iv , others were provisional and not consequential . 
   additionally , i suggest you to read `` documents of that time '' more , and/or maybe more things about this subject , since they are way different that you2re suggesting . 
  i do n't say that horror of war did n't happen . 
  i said that there was no planned genocide to exterminate cherkesi , only to resettle them to the ottoman empire , which agreed to host them , similar to how russian empire hosted greek and armenian refugees . 
   you know the term ` fremdsch\u00e4men ' ? 
  i do n't . 
  we have to differentiate between invasions and raids in this case . 
  the invasions of the steppe in one vessel or another are known from our historiography from it 's start . 
  initially invasions were lead by khazars ( jews ) who conquered some of the turkish tribes from northern caspian and converted them . 
  then their small empire broke thanks mostly to alans ( ossetians ) who were the major player in the caucasus prior khazars - those never raided us . 
  then pechenegs came and invaded rus for some while , but were small in number and were replaced by polovtsy ( cumans ) who invaded and raided rus until mongol crashed them in 1220 's . 
  during that period ( viii-xiiic ) several tribes pass through committing small raids like hungarians , alans and true bulgarians , but are barely mentioned by the chronologists . 
  mongols kill over half population of rus principalities ( but some are untouched and some are completely anhilited ) . 
  mongols were small minority of the invading armies , like all previous and posterior invasions - those snowballed somewhere in steppe when one tribe conquered their neighbours and brought them to fight other neighbours and then with all submitted losers went further and further until there were no more nomads , only farmers and cities . 
  but even then the losers of the cities were forced to be meatball for the taking of next cities ( no much option when your relatives are held hostage ) . 
  mongol empire actually were very rational and at last there is a century with almost no invasions ( only raids by rouge war-chieftains ) in exchange for constant tributes . 
  the problems begin again when golden horde eventually breaks and the nomads that were brought here by them start to act on their own - crimea is the most notable example , crimean tatars raided and invaded poland and moscow russia for centuries . 
  the last notable invasions that actually got to moscow were performed during times of troubles ( early 1600s ) . 
  after that big invasions occur until early 1700s , but none arrives to core russian territories only devastating the border provinces . 
  the raid continue from caucasian tribes and crimean tatars until 19th century . 
  russian activity on caucasus was mostly limited to building fortresses along the border until first ossetians and then georgians ask for a protectorate from russian empire . 
  trade routes start to flow and now apart from protection of russian population appeared two new priorities : protection of commercial routes through caucasus , protection of ossetians and later georgians .
