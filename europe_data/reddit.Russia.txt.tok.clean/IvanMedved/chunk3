  if you have couple billions euros go ahead , why not ? 
   thanks for the discussion , we can stop here . 
  i would discuss it , but after i saw what planned economy did to lithuania i will refrain from this entertainment . 
  are you like 90 years old ? 
   i am not sure about you , but i am not pharmaceutical expert , therefore i could ' t start such factory . 
  you do n't need to be , but it helps . 
  what you need to have is the capital and the abilities to lead a business all other things can be bought . 
  for example , you are not pharmaceutical expert , but you can hire one , or two or a team of 20 . 
  you need machinery ? 
  you buy it , in russia , you buy it abroad , it hire a team to develop the tools you need . 
  the capital is the only key ingredient here , capital and your capacity not to fuck up . 
   and how may , do you thing , there are people in russia who has necessery skills/knowledge to make such factory function and produce effective medicine successfuly there are multiple universities in russia that prepare top class biologists and pharmacists . 
  there are also over 30 different pharmaceutical companies in russia from which you can entice specialists . 
  but in any case there is always option to hire main experts abroad depending on your budget ( eastern europe , india for the cheap , western europe or us for top class expats ) . 
   which i presume is majority purchases for certain goods . 
  well congratulations , it is not planned economy yet . 
  it 's not like planned economy is something bad . 
  in my personal opinion planned economy can be much more efficient than one of open markets , and in the future countries will adopt it in one form or another . 
  since anyone can start such factory provided they have required capital , therefore it 's not completely state-regulated . 
  also private entities can import whatever they want , the law only affects governmental purchases . 
  new reborn game-modes are actually also cool .

   let me get this straight : nazis in ukraine bad , nazis in russia good ? 
  demushkin supports ukraine in the conflict . 
  source : vk.com/demushkin ( before vk.com blocked it ) . 
  partition of mongolia cyber-space obviously . 
  you do n't say . 
  livejournal was bought by russian company long time ago . 
  is very runet oriented . 
   the last one , tartu peace treaty , would set the border between pechory and pskov , so he would n't have broken the law as he would have been on estonian soil all the time . 
  the last one would be estonian ssr recognized borders . 
  but since modern estonian government does n't recognize essr - problem . 
  pechory is a city in russian federation , if anyone wondering . 
  there is no proof , but this is the most popular version on russian forums , since : 1 . 
  it was mentioned in [ several ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/08/estonia-russia-fsb-trap-eston-kohver ) [ sources ] ( https://euobserver.com/foreign/129925 ) , that he was going [ to meet an informant on the border ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article.php?id=506743 ) . 
  the fact of his investigation is also confirmed by estonian side . 
  he was detained supposedly by special forces and not border control . 
  the estonian officer was doing some investigation of the illegal border crossings ( trafficking/smuggling ) , and probably got an ` informant ' who promised to show him the ways where the border is crossed . 
  the informant led him through the border into a trap made by russian security forces . 
  that explains the money he had with himself ( for informant ) and the location in question . 
  because on the video shown by estonian newsmedia there is a dirt path crossing there . 
   when he was kidnapped , border officials from both sides went to the scene and both agreed that kohver was taken from estonian side that is not true , in many discussions video and written document was provided , but in none of them the info suggests anything remotely so .

  most of the newest modifications have the [ remote control ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_aedoyj4rlk/vt-82snjvzi/aaaaaaaacjc/83vejineoza/s1600/t-64bm%2bbulat_ukrainian%2bmain%2bbattle%2btank_12.jpg ) . 
  do n't see what way ? 
  there was n't any recognition for crimean tatar language in the legislation nor their heritage . 
  now there is . 
  and also funding for those programs . 
  right now the main question is the land question . 
  they want legalization of previous lands-grab ( or restitution , whatever you call it ) . 
  in some cases it is acceptable , in others it is not . 
  it 's also funny because if you watch current prime minister of ukraine , 2 years ago [ he wanted ` force solution ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlq7rtzzmwy ) against crimean tatars who demanded their land rights . 
  and now he seems all friendly to the idea of them , because he wants to push them and make them fight for ukraine against russian government . 
  crimean tatars obtained language and heritage rights they did n't when crimea was part of ukraine . 
  another topic is that there are some among them who would like even more rights ( like over-representation in the local parliament ) but that would be unconstitutional in russia . 
  yours make sense from scientific perspective . 
  ours is just virtual dick measurement contest with eu . 
  '' * it is there , where they burn ducks , that eventually they burn people * '' . 
   because you are the one criticizing the blog author ? 
  because he identified a tank based on an accessory ( a machine gun mount/ammo box ) . 
  and i pointed out that other tanks use same mount/ammo box ( and stabilizer , or whatever it is ) and provided photos of ukrainian tanks . 
  i could provide photos of russian tanks using the same , but i 'm sure that someone would twist it some way that it proves that on the op photo there is a russian tank . 
  and then , you say it 's not the same device beside the ammo-box . 
  but from the photos i provided it looks the same . 
  therefore it 's your turn to spend time searching internet for photos from the same perspective that will show the difference you are talking about . 
   if they 're the same we all , and even the blog author , will have to add that new model to the list . 
  the list is in your head luke . 
   still no photos of those nasty ua tanks from the point we all can actually compare them to the photo with a finger pointing guy ? 
  why should i provide a photo , since you are affirming that is different device , provide a photo from the same perspective , in which modernized ukrainian t-64 the device is different . 
  photo from such perspective even for t-90 is a very rare thing . 
   and as you can see , just as i said previously , its top is much lower than the top of ammo box , which is totally different from the `` finger pointing guy '' photo . 
  that would depend on perspective . 
  to determine how much it is lower on the [ op photo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qthb0cl.jpg ) is should be also filmed from at the same angle . 
  and the size is impossible to determine from the original photo , since only the tip is visible . 
   and it happened to be t-90 yeah , sure . 
   are they geolocated ? 
  just pictures does n't mean much . 
  you should also ask , how they determined that it is t-90 and not t-72 , for example . 
  i see many cases on reddit of people assuming ` x ' or ` y ' model , while design is almost identical . 
   are you kidding me ? 
  that looks like a totally different device , not even close . 
  hmmm ... an electronic [ device behind the ammo box ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qthb0cl.jpg ) at the same position as some ** totally different device ** in [ other t-64 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wxzadoi.jpg ) modernized tanks . 
  must be something completely different , not even close . 
  you are right !, 
   that big square muzzle brake , that 's definitely not a nsv you are aware that muzzle brake is an accessory that is mounted just like a silencer ? 
  you could with the same luck say that one is x model because it has optics in serial production , while another not . 
  but that all is beside the original point , in which you are mistaken . 
  you can see on the video of ukrainian bulat , or [ other photos ] ( http://alternathistory.org.ua/files/resize/170610_t-64-bulat_02-700x525.jpg ) . 
  ** edit : ** [ another video ] ( https://youtu.be/r7pnysjt5wa?t=36s ) , from ukrainian source . 
  yes , no problem there . 
  from the [ oldest scrap ] ( http://cdn.topwar.ru/uploads/posts/2013-07/1374650637_dop64066.jpg ) from [ the 70 's ] ( http://topwar.ru/uploads/posts/2010-10/1286450706_476.jpg ) to the [ newest ukrainian ` bulat ' ] ( https://youtu.be/i7-fl-aewkk?t=23s ) modernized versions . 
  the design of the ammo box for the machine gun remains the same . 
  initially t-90 also have nsv installed , and the latest ones kord . 
  but that has two particularities : 1 ) in the photo only ammo box is seen , and both machine-guns use the same calibre . 
  2 ) you have to be very proficient expert to differentiate between [ kord ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/kord_machine_gun_6p60_engineering_technologies_-_2010.jpg ) and [ nsv ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/nsv_machine_gun-01.jpg/1920px-nsv_machine_gun-01.jpg ) . 
  this is the problem with this topic , because one could make a photo of something soviet and make link to wikipedia to the newest model that looks almost identical . 
  i like how t-90 is determined by the universal machine-gun ammo box for ( most likely ) nsv . 
  let us hear your murrrr or we stop using your transit .
