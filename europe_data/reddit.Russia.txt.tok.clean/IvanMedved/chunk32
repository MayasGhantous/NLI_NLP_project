   did churchill create a system that forced people into gulags or labor camps in sibera to a certain fate of death churchill did ordered ( and from what i read , even partook before he was a nation 's leader ) into systematic terror in the british colonies with the intent of break the resistance of the oppressed local population . 
  british empire and nazi germany had the same ideology , the only difference is that brits achieved what hitler wanted 100-150 years before him . 
   the us company has majority of gmo patents under us law , you ca n't really make eu law which would ignore it . 
  us laws do n't apply in eu . 
  you just make law that genetic sequences can not be patented under biopatent directive ( methods and other innovation on other hand should be patented ) . 
  just like it was done with embryos . 
   then the major companies which are already established will eat up the production/supply and get the control over price/quantity making others incapable of competing , this would be solved by giving the governmental organizations control over the production to drive price to marginal costs that 's a fallacy , because the contrary will happen . 
  the major companies established thanks to the patent law created elevated ( in costs ) entries to the market for smaller companies . 
  if removed genetic material from biopatents , then smaller companies will have cheaper entry to the market while major companies will suffer because their assets ( patents in this case and business perspectives ) will deteriorate . 
  better idea -- a ban of patents on genetic material . 
  let the universities make research under eu grants , since it 's an important subject with much window to abuse . 
   one wrong does n't make other right . 
  true . 
  but why so much attention to stalin then ? 
  it 's our business . 
  and when i say our , i include you too . 
  not western europeans business . 
   hitler did n't send anyone to deathcamps personally neither . 
  you learn fast . 
   and there are still people alive who suffered under stalins regime - that usually makes also quite a difference how people perceive historical tyrants . 
  implying that there are no people who suffered under hitler regime . 
  their difference in death is only 9 years apart . 
  and after the war when all collaborators and similar where punished the number of repressions went significantly down . 
   i 'm not circlejerking about anybody , i merely pointed out that you 're comparing stalin with someone that came more than a century before him . 
  if you respond in a thread in which i answer to another guy who said :  what a joke . 
  do russians not have a memory , or are they really this keen on historical revisionism ? 
  and you do n't develop your own point i just must assume that you feel the same . 
  unless you say you do n't , or until you say you do n't in this case . 
   churchill 's crimes are just not on level with stalin ( or hitler ) . 
  i really would like to hear from you or anybody else how exactly they are comparable . 
  i just ca n't see how they are . 
  depend on how you look at it . 
  if we go by the numbers of dead , then hitler has his own category with over 25 million of innocent civilian population . 
  stalin innocent civilian population victims would be around 2 millions . 
  churchill innocent civilian population victims would be around 300-500 thousands ( very difficult to take correct estimates from the ex-colonies ) . 
  but if we take innocent civilian population victims due to wrong policies ( that cause hunger for example ) then they are more or less at same number of 10 millions . 
  but if we take the motivation of those crimes : hitler believed his race to be superior and take living space from others , who were inferior and only suited to be enslaved or exterminated . 
  churchill believed his race to be superior and wanted to retain control over the colonies populated by inferior races and harshly suppressed any intent of liberation movement . 
  stalin believed in better world and wanted all people on earth to live in a just society . 
  but also he believed that many people due their ambition and desire to be superior to others would want to prevent that . 
  and he created a system that punished those and made vast collateral damage over many innocents . 
  for me in this aspect churchill ( if your read about him , his quotes and remarks about race , dominance , colonies ) he was the same as hitler mentally . 
  it 's hitler happened to want to repeat british ` success ' in a more modern times . 
   stalin 's atrocities happened almost a full century after , so expectations of a civilized and fair society are naturally a lot higher . 
  ok , same time period churchill -- look at his crimes in africa or india . 
  is he respected in england ? 
  does that infuriate anyone in your civilized and fair society ? 
  truman same time period -- dropped nuclear devices that devastated two highly populated cities in japan to show off to the soviet union . 
  what do you say about that ? 
  and in most historical books in the west that fact is whitewashed , showed as a necessarily step to take . 
  but no , let 's all circle-jerk about stalin , whose crimes are known mostly because after his death his successor ( nikita khrushchev ) revealed and exposed everything ( except the ones in which he took part in ) . 
  how is it other people business what is written in our books , when in 99 % of the cases the subject of stalin is objective , facts are numbered and everyone makes his own conclusions . 
  `` but no !, 
  those russians dare to not learn our version of the history this is uncivilized and historical revisionism ! '', 
   how many people were sent to gulag by napoleon ? 
  the same as stalin -- 0 . 
  stalin did n't send people to labour camps personally . 
  he created a system , that in itself was harsh and permitted abuse of justice which lead to many being unjustly accused and sentenced ( because their neighbours did n't like them and submitted a false report to the nkvd , for example ) . 
  so did napoleon , he created a system , a war machine that caused much more death than stalin 's . 
  and if we take it toward the proportion of the total population , then maybe 10 times more than stalin repression machine . 
  obviously both of them in some cases abused the system to eliminate their personal enemies , but that is another question . 
   regardless , this is just whataboutism ; it has not impact on this discussion . 
  it does . 
  many europeans think that it 's their business on how we view history in russia , and try to tech us their version , many times short-sighted on facts based on myths and misconceptions . 
  stalin is n't respected because of his crimes , but because of his achievements . 
  even more , ** he is not as respected ** ( by many , but not the majority ) ** as he is accepted ** ( by most of the population ) as historical figure . 
  a leader under which our people were saved from complete annihilation around 75-80 years ago . 
  we do n't teach brits that they should despise cromwell or churchill because of their horrible crimes . 
  discuss your history books and silly paradigms , whitewash of genocide and abuse of primitive ethnicities along the same period . 
  and certainly do n't make a news report when a churchill gets a commemoration centre or a statue somewhere . 
  neither we do when napoleon gets one and we have more reason to hate him than any other nation ( except maybe jews , who suffered great deal under him ) . 
   the amount of direct victims of stalin 's repressions numbers 6-9 million . 
  6-9m victims yes , but that 's not mortal victims . 
  during stalin tyranny around 800-900 thousands people were sentenced to maximum penalty ( execution ) for political reasons . 
  around 5,5 millions went through labour camps ( for political reasons ) and part of them died there of illness and poor conditions . 
  that being said political reasons in most cases meant activities that are now decriminalized -- political activism , vocal opposition , critique , independent press . 
  but in many other cases there were some major crimes like corruption , incitement of violence , uprising , preparation of coup , treason of state , armed robberies -- all of those fell also within political crimes category . 
  no researcher group has ever gone through all the cases to produce reliable statistics ( archives are open for this kind of thing ) yet . 
   indirectly , he is also responsible for : 11 million dead red army soldiers , 5-6 million of civilians murdered by nazis , and about a million of civilians who died in leningrad/stalingrad . 
  that 's quite a thing to say , meaning that it was n't his intent or due to his incompetence that those men died . 
  germans had a plan to exterminate all the slavonic population living in europe and settle the place themselves . 
  and they followed this plan thoroughly . 
   counting only russia itself . 
  not i.e. 
  ukrainian holodomor the hunger in the 1932 was mainly to the drought and the number of the victims was not preventable . 
  what soviet administration did is transfer the hunger from the towns towards the villages . 
  and with equal proportion to all southern regions of the soviet union . 
  also it 's unfair to hall the hunger of 1932 ukrainian holodomor because twice ethnic russians died than ukrainians . 
  now if we go to napoleon on other hand ... oh the things that happened under his rule . 
  yet he is reviered by most of the french and nobody is indignified by it . 
   do russians not have a memory , or are they really this keen on historical revisionism ? 
  what is the difference between napoleon and stalin ? 
  is this a bad thing ? 
  it seems you have n't been following the reports closely enough . 
  the cologne police chief [ has been fired ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/08/cologne-violence-suspects-include-asylum-seekers ) after [ reports ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/world/europe/coordinated-attacks-on-women-in-cologne-were-unprecedented-germany-says.html ) appeared implicating him of trying [ cover up ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/328278-cologne-nye-assaults-cover-up/ ) all thing . 
  and it is clear that he is just a scapegoat following orders of his superiors . 
  you are doing it manually instead of exporting calc/excel charts into gimp/phtoshop ? 
  i admire your dedication . 
  ppp is useful because it compares the real size of the economies ( removing the exchange rate from the ecuation in a way ) . 
  imagine a simple model in which we want to compare how many apples each country produces .
