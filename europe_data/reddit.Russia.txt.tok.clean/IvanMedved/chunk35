  apart from this , if measures are not taken european goods could be introduced in russia in avoidance of taxed through ukraine . 
  therefore there will be consequences of economical type . 
  ffs finish dayz at once, 
  politics ? 
  the guy never did politics , he worked in kgb in the 80 's in the 90 's straight out started working as chief of security for khodorkovsky , performing wetwork for him . 
  some of the instances were proven and now he is serving life-sentence in prison . 
  nobody doubts the factual evidence , the only objection is that supposedly drugs were used to interrogate him , therefore all evidence obtained this way is tainted and should n't be accepted by the court . 
  calling him a political prisoner is just mocking the concept of political prisoners . 
   free pichugin , recognized as a political prisoner mmm ... khodorkovsky 's personal assasin is now a recognized political prisoner ? 
  next news isis starts a space mission . 
  better than having a soldier killed . 
  anyway such devices would be likely to kill enemy armoured vehicles . 
  then it can be used to target missiles on it 's position . 
   if he did n't criticize the russian intervention in ukraine , would he have been still charged ? 
  let 's not confuse things here . 
  he is a leftist extremist , his critique is not of the nature that you think it is . 
   anyway , calling for the expulsion of ukrainian refugees makes him an asshole , but a criminal ? 
  the form is what makes the key question in all hate crimes . 
  say same thing one way and you are a great politican - another and you are a criminal and a racist . 
  i think he deleted the video in question from his [ channel on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucyqia2mphkz7nghh58exqwq ) ( i ca n't find it now ) , but the guy calls for : 1 ) armed socialist revolution , 2 ) mass repressions against state officials his videos are full of emotional judgements and what can be qualified under russian criminal code as extremism . 
  and that is the reason of his second trial for calls for an armed rebellion . 
  actually while indeed he critised russian intervention in ukraine , his conviction under 282 rfcc was because of his call of expelling all ukrainian refugees from russia . 
  well since 1992 there were over 200 journalists murdered . 
  but only around 50 murders were related to their profession and happened not in the time of war . 
   the committee to protect journalists has described russia as `` one of the deadliest countries in the world for journalists , '' with 36 journalists killed since 1992 why the article mentions since 1992 ? 
  why only 36 ? 
  people would ask you were you got that shirt , so they can too . 
   as annoying and dysfunctional as american politics can be , this reminds me that a country whose citizens can express a wide variety of opinions without fear is a very good thing . 
  print t-shirt with `` return texas to mexico '' banner 2 . 
  go to texas or other southern state 3 . 
   turkey is ours , nobody can take our soil which our forefathers have died for . 
   the kurdish/hard-left party got ~ 5 million votes in the last election . 
  let 's assume all 5 million of those were from kurds . 
  that 's still only 1/3 of the kurdish vote at best . 
   that means 2/3 of kurds voted for the ruling akp government that has made it very clear what its policy towards the pkk would be post-election -- all out war until the pkk ` bury their weapons . ', 
  nice fallacy you got there . 
  how can you assume that 2/3 voted for akp if you do n't manage the data about % of kurds that voted ? 
  maybe 2/3 stayed at home ? 
  without a solid source you can not tell . 
  that could backfire sometime in summer . 
   it also does n't feel secure in it 's nearly puppet governments of transnistria and belarus , so it stopped giving them loans . 
  transnistria is n't official country - they can not receive loans , only aid . 
  belarus received this summer almost $ 1bn in credits from russia . 
  later on lukashenka postponed the question about new air base in belarus , which created difficulties to obtain more money , but instead of bowing to russia he is trying to negotiate this credit with imf . 
  in other words -- our leadership does n't feel secure with your current leadership to give loans that later may be not paid . 
  you are the lesser evil . 
   yes , but that involves transfers from government to private industry of foreign currency that the government could have otherwise kept . 
  no , it works differently . 
  russian exporter companies need to pay taxes , salaries , provisions and inputs . 
  therefore they exchange their foreign currency for roubles . 
  the currency enters our forex markets providing it for those who need it for the mentioned components . 
   if consumption is going down , it does not necessarily mean production is going up . 
  imports might have shrunk to 10 % of the total pie , but if the pie shrunk domestic output might not have actually gone up , even though its share of consumption has . 
  everything true . 
   honestly that is not always a good thing . 
  regardless of how much you produce at home any country will require outside components likely paid for in dollars , euros , or sometimes yuan . 
  a country has reserves for that , reserves that come from oil/gas , weaponry and space business . 
  i open the article , i read :  when russian entrepreneur dmitry potapenko exploded in rage at the moscow economic forum he could not have known he would become an internet sensation . 
  and i commented since , that fragment became memed over the internet . 
  now it 's being forced to ridicule the opposition , because on the fragment he rages about something that he made up . 
  he said that he makes business in europe and there is no triple transportation tax there . 
  but as everyone can check out it is common practice ( that russian federation copied from europe ) to have a tax on the fuel , a tax on the vehicle and paid roads . 
  that 's the thing that the man with glasses was calmly telling to him when he exploded with rage making fool of himself and anyone who reposted the fragment . 
  in the whole video he has another complain , about fiscal authorities checking on ` new businesses ' , while they should n't do that . 
  but what that man did , is to create new legal personalities for his old companies , therefore that advantage is not applicable to him . 
  fact that also was calmly explained to him . 
  in reality potapenko ( as i see from his other appearances on tv ) -- did importing business from europe , thing heavily impacted by rouble devaluation and russian sanctions on eu food industry , the true reason why he is so angry . 
  this is rich . 
  this is the dude who [ said ] ( https://youtu.be/nwyfaxwwmme?t=8m14s ) that he deals in europe and ** there is no triple tax on transport ** unlike in russia . 
  i would like someone to answer honestly , is there a country in europe that does n't have : * fuel tax * vehicle tax * paid roads/autobahns ? 
  will you really make me search youtube for videos of opposition political assemblies being rioted by extremist groups and political candidates beaten and shoved into waste containers ? 
   this bizarre , thoroughly ass-backwards logic makes hitler 's takeover of power a revolution and the romanian overthrow of ceausescu a coup . 
  both meant changes for previous system : hitler changed the system from a democracy to a dictatorship ( basically abolished reichstag ) , in which after 1933 you could only vote for nsdap . 
  and many other similar things . 
  and the romanian revolution brings back democracy , changing whole system also . 
  with many reforms that abolish planned economy , etc. 
  hitler 's actions could not be considered revolution in my opinion , because he was voted into the power and formed government ( if my memory does n't fail me ) and later usurped more and more authority . 
   change is slow in ukraine , partly because it 's hard to reform a thoroughly corrupt system without sending a lot of people to the guillotine or a cheka basement . 
  change is slow in ukraine because an oligarch was voted into power as president on one hand and criminal structures into rada on another . 
   if you compare with numbers from before euromaidan , the situation is very different . 
  that 's because of a massive dis-informational campaign of what eu is and when they will be able to join . 
  first of all , those politicians in power started in 2013-2014 by placing cu and eu almost at the same point at the time-table . 
  but in reality you can sign for cu and join in a couple of years , but signing aa-eu may lead you on a path of several decades until you are fit to join eu . 
  or you may never be able to join like turkey . 
  second , people know very well what cu is , they watch at belarus and get the general idea . 
  but people do n't understand how european institutions work . 
  so when yatsenuk ( current prime minister ) goes on tv and says : what is association with european union for everyone of you ? 
  '' [ it 's ** the wages and pensions 5 times higher that we have today in ukraine ** , an affordable medicine for everyone , new technologies , foreign investments , big market , ** cheap credits ** , and new jobs . 
  it is the right of every ukrainian freely to travel to europe without visas or borders ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqcrqtzuhui ) . '', 
  and people buy it , just like those refuges from middle east and africa buy the idea that their needs will be fully attended once they cross the sea . 
  since russian tv channels ( and euronews btw ) were forbidden in ukraine people without sat or cable only chew on propaganda like this . 
  it is normal that they think : that ukraine can join eu just as easily as cu and that eu would just fix their lives . 
  which as you probably know it 's not the case . 
  the path to eu it 's like asking a bank for a credit nowdays -- you have to prove first-hand that you do n't need the credit , then they 'll lend you . 
  if you can control almost everything from the media to the voting stations , why not ? 
  you know how much ' * pro-european * ' government promised to the ukrainian people before , during and shortly after maidan ? 
  they wo n't be able to deliver even 10 % , and it 's not like they will be able to blame russia for that now , you can not say '' hur dur russian aggressio that 's why we have the most corruption in all of our history '' . 
  and then the population will become very very disappointed and who knows what will happen in the next 3-5 years . 
  in mariopol -- ukrainian army controlled major port-city in donetsk region : absolute victory of 2/3 for opposition block ( pro-russian party if there is any ) in recent elections . 
  in odessa , another major port city and region capital -- pro-russian major with absolute victory over 50 % , etc. . .
