  you can not call a coup a revolution unless there is a radical change of the system . 
  it was just a coup . 
   i mean what 's a euro worth lately , 80 rubles ? 
  you want a few hundred rubles for your euro ? 
  it does n't mean anything if there is no stability . 
  nobody will invest millions in some business if in 3 years the tables will turn around . 
   it 's corruption and nepotism , these tend to be disastrous for the prosperity of a country . 
  the share of imports for the internal consumption was less than 15 % . 
  soon it will be under 10 % . 
  meaning that we will produce over 90 % of what our citizens and corporations consume . 
  but we can not export so much . 
   which begs the question , why did n't russia use the same backdoor to flood eu with cheap russian products ? 
  you can not unless oil becomes completely worthless . 
   like with nonsensical statement that the ukrainian parliament attempted to `` forbid speaking russian '' . 
  one of the first laws that rada voted on after maidan coup was to repeal any status for russian language . 
   it 's up to ukrainian people to change the constitution . 
  yes , but most of ukrainians wanted second language status for russian ( all 90 's polls , most of the 00 's ) . 
  and many polls suggest that many still want it , however i would n't be too much trusting the latest ones . 
   so , as it was n't part of the plc , there was no russification ? 
  this is some kind of weird logic . 
  to comprehend russification you have to study ehtnogenesis of the ukrainian , russian and belorussian people . 
  from medieval rus people after the mongol invasion started to segregate three main sub-ethnic groups : taken by polish kingdom in the west , taken by lithuania in the north and quasi-independent principalities in the north and east . 
  the southern-part of medieval rus was completely annihilated by nomads . 
  under polish influence medieval russian morphed into multiple dialects ( not formalized ) and in the mid 19th century those dialects were absorbed and formalized by ukrainian language in the south and belarusian in the north . 
  anyhow territories that never were part of polish-lithuanian commonwealth never received influence of proto-ukrainian dialects until their incorporation into the russian empire , therefore the statement of nounhud is mostly wrong . 
   the ethnic composition there is in part due to russification he says '' * there * '' , meaning quoting the article :  russian president vladimir putin will not abandon russians living in ** southeast ukraine ** but that part was n't ukrainian in any sense until 1917 at best . 
  for example , don region was always part of some eastern russian principality ( and later moscow ) . 
  while southern region was part of medieval rus , but abandoned due to constant nomad invasions ( for loot and slaves ) and only repopulated in the 19th century . 
  therefore you can not say that ethnic composition of the southeastern ukraine is that way because it was ` russified ' . 
  now you understand , do you ? 
  also being all the southern cities quite modern , it is well written who and at what point moved there . 
  for example the core population of odessa ( main ukrainian port-city ) were greeks , armenians and russians . 
  later on more russians and ukrainians moved in . 
  and a bit later also many jews moved in . 
  making in the late 19th century half of the city russian-speaking population , a third jews and the rest others . 
  and in same way you can follow any town or city in the south and see that it 's not like it was originally ukrainian and then by some mystic way russified . 
  he could n't have done it if a language spoken by half of the population had a legal status in the constitution . 
   the ethnic composition there is in part due to russification ; a program intended to bind ukraine into the russian empire . 
  the south and the east never were part of polish-lithuanian commonwealth .

   people should not decide in matters like this . 
  we ca n't let the majority decide what minority should do . 
  that would depend on countless factors . 
  but in general the majority does and should decide what everyone should do . 
  what you refer is that the ** prejudices ** of the majority should n't impair the ** rights ** of the minorities . 
  because those are categories of completely different weight . 
   decades ? 
  we 'll do this again in two years . 
  but that would n't respect the decision of the people . 
  it 's clearly not democratic to press an issue the establishment want to pass until it passes . 
  there should be bigger cooldown between such referendums , a generation maybe . 
   from the article you linked , basically you pulled crimea on us in 1806 wait , are you turk ? 
   yes it was not arbitrary , but i hope you see it was n't fair either . 
  well , romania pulled crimea 2014 on us in 1918 . 
  it was fair i guess , if the results were n't so bad for moldavians i would n't have objections . 
   it 's where the ussr * arbitrarily * decided to draw their border with the molotov-ribbentrop pact . 
   and in the past has occupied lithuania prior to that lithuania has been part of russia for couple centuries . 
  and it 's not like lithuania has n't occupied russia on numerous occasions . 
   if anything gay adoptive parents are better than alot of bio parents srsly ? 
  why so serious ? 
  half of the country already lives in moscow . 
   russia - 52 lol  ukraine - 19 kek  kosovo - 6 wtf guys , you are sick, 
  kadyrov maybe the only sane chechen i ever heard of . 
  new interesting way to suicide . 
  did n't remember what all pan twardowsky was about until heard ` zegarmits swiatla purpurowy ' song . 
  very cool short . 
  `` girl must resist , but boy must insist '' vv putin, 
  i was n't talking about crimea , but whatever . 
   nato is n't like russia , it 's not going to send soldiers into the parliament and hold a session at gunpoint ( which is exactly what happened in crimea ) . 
  why do that , when you can arm local thugs to do the job ? 
  you can either have tiny protest in the center or huge in the `` outskirts '' ( see bolotnaya ) . 
  russian influence . 
  since zhirinovsky got old i though i 'd never enjoy a sight of a good old parlament brawl . 
  thank you ukrainian friends for keeping me entertained . 
  so under condition of moving capital to kiev you would annex us ? 
  lavra is the place where first rus dukes rest . 
  it is sacred for all russians . 
  putin there is just overstretching the myth about where vladimir was baptized . 
  that would be lavra , in kiev . 
  the sanctions have to be renewed every 6 months . 
  if a single country votes against -- those are not renewed . 
  with a bit of luck , the sanctions would stop in january . 
  because eu and ukrainian leadership refused to introduce rules so eu produced goods are not re-exported into russian-led trade union from ukraine . 
  therefore a businessman could simply export any goods to ukraine , then change the packages/reassemble and export to russia under ukrainian preferential quota . 
  taking in account the corruption in that part of europe , that can not be prevented in practice . 
  that 's one point . 
  another is that cis-fta moved from trade union ( 2011 agreement ) into a customs union and all members are expected to join this new agreement ( like eu countries were expected to join tce in 2004 ) . 
  a country can not be part of more than one customs union . 
  and last but not least , euaa harms others members of the cis-fta because the equilibrium previous to 2016 vanishes -- now in ukrainian markets of goods and services they will have to compete with eu goods and services ( at better price/quantity ) , which worsen their position . 
  also in their own territory they would have to compete with ukrainian goods and services which were also pushed away from national markets and will be seeking export at dumping prices , which also worsen other members positions . 
  therefore logical conclusions are : 1 ) ukraine joining eu-aa worsen other cis-fta positions , 2 ) either ukraine will be expelled from cis-fta or the agreements compatibilized somehow . 
   they are still somewhat formally part of cis , but it 's apparent that after the dcfta ( free trade area between eu and ukraine ) will enter into force on january 1 , 2016 , ukraine is ready to leave the cis free trade zone agreement if russia will attempt to `` blackmail '' them on dcfta . 
  yes , but this is no threat , like poroshenko or the article present it . 
  it means that both agreements are incompatible , and that ukraine has to choose ( already chosen ) . 
   excep trade agreements do not establish that the union 's laws supersede sovereign law simply because such union laws do not exist . 
  actually some constitutions establish that international pacts are sources of law equal to the constitution itself . 
  others do n't . 
  anyhow after the ratification of the pact or agreement - it becomes part of the sovereign law itself . 
  anyhow it does n't matter since at no point i affirmed such thing . 
  i simply stated that , in case a state adopts an agreement incompatible with previous one , the logical consequence is that the former will be nullified .
