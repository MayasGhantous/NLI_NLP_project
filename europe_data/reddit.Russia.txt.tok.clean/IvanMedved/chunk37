  and the state ( ukraine in this case ) will be expelled from such trade agreements . 
  and this is not a threat by any means , like the article or ukrainian government tries to present it . 
   if one side desides to break it at best the other can take it up with international institutions such as creditors or ask for arbitration . 
  the institutions that resolve the disputes about agreement are stipulated in the agreement itself . 
  not some abstract arbitration from your imagination . 
   which 1994 cis trade agreement are you referring to ? 
  [ \u0421\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d \u0421\u041d\u0413 \u043e\u0442 15.04.1994 '' \u041e \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0437\u043e\u043d\u044b \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0438 '' ] ( http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_law_3635/ ) , it 's [ redaction from 1999 ] ( http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_law_30113/9a0bb03c9a84f7ad17fb82d98b1012742f170aab/#dst100019 ) . 
  and it is worth mentioning the actual agreement that applies to ukraine at the moment : '' [ \u0414\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440 \u043e \u0437\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0438 ] ( http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_law_121497/ ) '' ( 18.10.2011 ) . 
  ukraine as member of such agreements has received discounts on resources ( gas and oil ) and other preferences . 
  different economists and politicians estimate a transfer of net $ 200bn to ukraine from russia in the last 20 years . 
   although ukraine was one of the founding countries and ratified the creation agreement in december 1991 , ukraine chose not to ratify the cis charter . 
  following the 2014 parliamentary election , a new bill to denounce the cis agreement was introduced . 
  that quote is more about political union of cis , not the trade zone . 
  the trade zone started with series of agreements in 1994-2011 , after which new version ( customs union ) was purposed . 
  right now ukraine is still part of cis trade agreements in it 's 2011 version and still recieving quotas and privileges for it 's trade with countries of the union . 
   except ukrane is n't in any union with russia . 
  it 's a sovereign country . 
  are you implying that portugal is not a sovereign country ? 
  anyway , ukraine is part of cis trade agreements since 1994 , which would be analogue to eu trade agreements pre-maastricht treaty . 
   theats imagine eu country ( for example , portugal ) independently establishing a free trade pact with china . 
  when the authorities are inquiered about it , chiniese authorities say that it is not eu business and that portugal is an independent country . 
  then eu leaders say , that then portugal would be most likely out of the union unless that trade agreement is revised to be compatible with european agreements . 
  would that be called a threat by the media then ? 
   a lot of russia has the same climate as poland , you do n't have to subsidize apples , they just grow on trees . 
  am i missing something or this country is so messed up that they ca n't even organize orchard ? 
  since there was a lot of foreign currency inflow through the oil/gas exports -- our products were always much more expensive than foreign ones . 
  therefore it had n't any economical sense to produce , for example , apples . 
  if you can buy from poland 30-40 % cheaper . 
  now this rouble down it makes some sense , but it would be uncertain investment . 
  [ you know what ? 
  ] ( http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/f/fd/troll_rival_23.mp3 ), 
   that is why crimeans have electricity only 2 hours per day first of all , electricity is needed to run basic services , like heating , water pumps , hospitals , etc. 
  those must run either 24h or at least most part of the day . 
  second , if you had electricity for 2h/day , you would use all the appliances : washing machine , iron , computer ... at that time . 
  and this use will be for all , requiring maximum load for the lines . 
  because of this concentration you can not provide as much time , as basic math tells you . 
  because normal consumption data is for normal use concentration . 
   crimea needs about 1,200 mw , they are only giving about 200 mw 1200mw is the peak consumtion in summer . 
  normal consumtion is around 900mw . 
  home production right now is around 400mw ( if count emergency generators ) . 
  yesterday 100mw started flowing as a test . 
  today already 200 mw at full capacity of 1st line . 
  20 december another line of 200 mw should start working . 
  this way covering 700mw without emergency generators , which is less than normal , but sufficient for decent way of life . 
  in may another 400mw line will be up . 
  this way covering 100 % of crimean neccesities . 
  the only problem that is possible , is that right now there is no infrastructure to recieve those 400mw in may . 
  rekt for the haters from [ the other post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3v4z4j/months_after_russian_annexation_hopes_start_to/ ), 
  why they dont compare the photos with the ones taken in may or june ? 
  as i see it , between the images that are compared there is a significant difference because of the angle/inclination of the perspective + time ( midday and morning ) + date + quality . 
  because he confused the locations . 
  i still do n't get how the difference in hat bellingcat published points to russian mod satelity pictures being fake . 
  is it true that when you were captured and tortured they removed your sense of irony ? 
  so when erdogan is stepping down ? 
  are you american by any chance ? 
  as long as i 'm aware the latest prototype is still operational in kharkov . 
  but it is a faulty design , there was a need of funds to continue the development , and now it 's just a relict of the past . 
  i 'm not a specialist on the matter , but very interested in the subject . 
  and from what i read it could have been different . 
  yes , but iter is a tokamak . 
  and wendelstein 7-x is a stellator . 
  stellators should be in theory more safe , efficient and last longer . 
  the problem with stellators , is while a tokamak is simetrical -- a stellator is not . 
  therefore early versions , like torsatron were `` leaking '' due to not the optimal form . 
  but now with supercomputers you can calculate the most efficient form for a stellator which is ( for now ) 7-x . 
  another problem would be putting it into mass-production , but it 's not like tokamak design has advanced there further for now . 
  the problem with our stellator is that the leading team and infrastructure remained in kharkov ( ukraine ) , and was n't saved by international support like russian team with iter project ( who joined their colleges in japan , us and eu , and even had some financing at home thanks to that ) . 
  therefore one source of ideas and innovations less -- sad :( but i hope 7-x shows good results , therefore providing valueble data for demo project . 
  it 's a pity our torsatron was abandoned :( go germany !, 
  colaborate with fbk ( navalny 's organization ) . 
  take example from spain . 
  do not take example from uk . 
  it seems that it is not easy to surprise you at all , 
  it 's much bigger , than you think . 
  since the mob he is linked to is directly responsable for [ kushchevskaya massacre ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/kushchevskaya_massacre ) . 
  and this news also affects eu , since greek officials were likely to help his family to wash the money . 
   and do people have ownership deeds on these ? 
  depends on each case . 
  the cooperatives are in decay , because private corporations are slowly taking over since the 90 's , and cooperatives that did well transformed into corporations later on . 
  corporations are just privatized sovkhozs by the way . 
  the land is never a problem . 
  usually only 30 % of arable land in russia is exploited . 
   yeah ... that 's why they disappeared after 1991 . 
  cuz they were `` voluntary '' . 
  erm ... they just changed denomination . 
  just like kolkhoz were called obshchinas before the revolution , now they are called simply cooperatives . 
  do n't you understant the kolkhoz had no money ? 
  no , the individual farmers did n't have money and used manual ploughs and cattle to farm land . 
  sovkhoz and kolkhoz had state credits at very low interests to purchase any equipment they needed . 
  for whom do you think those hundred of thousands units of equipment were produced ? 
   imagine a village has 10 farmers . 
  you steal their land and all their products and supplies . 
  except kolkhoz is a voluntary cooperative of ex-individual farmers , while sovkhoz is a state cooperative . 
  a kolkhoz is created by a village that puts everything together and works the land , and even by then those 83 % is not even 30 % of potentially arable and vacant land . 
  russia is not western europe , in our vast space the precious resource for agriculture were the people , and not the land . 
  since you confuse basic concepts i do n't see a point to continue this conversation . 
   yeah in 1933 , ukrainian farmers all had that . 
  how much vodka did you put in the cool aid that you 're drinking ? 
  the good thing about soviet cooperatives is the sharing of inventory . 
  kharkiv locomotive factory produced thousands of tractors before 1933 , and the problem was only cooperatives had fund to purchase them .
