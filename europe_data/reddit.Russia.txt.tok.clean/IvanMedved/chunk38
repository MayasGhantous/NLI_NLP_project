   because the communists built them in 2 years wut ? 
  ** edit ** : i might as well provide [ some sources ] ( http://www.avtomash.ru/katalog/histori/muzei_t/index.html ) , for total tractors in su production : zaparogec ( 1923-27 ) - 500 units kolomenec ( 1923-29 ) - 500 units fordson-f ( ford licensed 1924-33 ) - 36100 units universal ( 1934-1955 ) - 211500 units \u0421\u0425\u0422\u0417 ( licensed 1930-1950 ) - 390500 units and so on . 
   well here 's the thing . 
  the coops at first ( and i doubt even after ) were not at all productive . 
  cooperatives had tractors , irrigation systems , pumps , mills ... 
  individual farmers used ploughs  and food was taken out of the country . 
  saying it was n't a man-made famine is so stupid . 
  you can compare the exports of food between 1930-1931 and 1932-1933 taking data from september to december . 
  there were no exports in comparative . 
   a man-made famine the famine was n't man-made because the main cause of scarcity of food was a drought -- a natural event , that drastically reduced the harvest in autumn 1932 . 
  such droughts occurred at least once in two decades and there was a famine in that area almost every decade . 
  in what did influenced human factor in this case you would ask ? 
  well the administration transferred the from the towns to the villages ... 
  i 'll explain : normally when scarcity of provision appears -- the population of the villages are not the ones who suffer the least , since they have the most direct access to the results of the latest harvest . 
  therefore the cities are the place in which the scarcity of food hits the most . 
  what bolsheviks has done is continue a policy created in the old empire , which consisted in taking fee for the land use ' * in natura * ' . 
  with the difference that the rates were established based not on the average results between all the producers , but on average results of the cooperatives . 
  since cooperatives were much more effective than individual farmers -- the fee was pretty high for them . 
  this way soviet government ` gave incentives ' farmers to move into cooperatives and this way fixing the [ scissors crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scissors_crisis ) . 
  this way in the end who suffered the hunger the most were individual farmers in drought affected areas . 
  the soviet policies did n't change the numbers of victims significantly , but indeed changed the subjects . 
  by economy china was the world 's first economical power until 19th century , and british with colonies were second and then british empire , until they became the 1st until the late 19th century in which usa took the lead which they had until recent couple years in which china became 1st once again . 
  by military power , the factor i was talking about above -- russia took the lead in ground forces in the 17th century , and with creation of the first fleet by peter i in the early 1700s , became the most powerful state in the world . 
  position which was lost in late 19th century due to delay in the industrialization processes in russian empire . 
  all planes except the civilian were hit with manpads which can be adquired by raiding a military base or a sbu quarters . 
  global procedure is the same -- interception is used . 
  he said that crimean tatars are being killed one by one . 
  which clearly not the case . 
  there is one political activist who was killed and it 's unknown if it was the government ( which i doubt ) , nationalists ( viable ) or cossacks . 
  about people missing -- there are different allegations in this aspect , never saw a number bigger than 10 with names written . 
  which is unfortunate , but most of them arent even political activists , just people missing which is statistically normal with russia 's murder/missing rates . 
   that 's not even true . 
  china has a far superior military than russia . 
  and india 's military comes close to the russian military . 
  china and india only superpass russia in * potential * manpower , which in modern conflict does n't mean much . 
  in the hardware both in tech and number of units/devices russia superpass china on the ground , sea and air . 
   russia is n't a super power , never was , and never will be . 
  big military toys mean nothing if your economy is shit . 
  you can win battles , but not wars . 
  russian empire was the strongest country in the world for 2 centuries ( 1700-1900 ) . 
  during 1905-1917 some positions were lost and later on regained in the late 20 's until 1991 . 
  being 2nd world most powerful country in those years . 
  right now , russia is 5th most powerful economy in the world and has the second most powerful military after us . 
  russia does n't need to do it , since our western partners already did it . 
  the only link is missing -- the nexus with turkish government . 
  obviosly russians did it , just ethnic russians , not russian official forces , and in most cases not russian nationals either . 
  and ukraine is not even a regional power . 
  russia might obviosly overlook this agression , but only if turkey concedes something we want . 
  turkmen militants are mostly present in an nusra , which is a terrorist group . 
  and oil does n't come from turkmen , do n't put words in my moith i did n't say . 
  oil comes from the wells controlled by daesh . 
  regarding who is more believable , mind to remind you , that turkey 's leadership has direct interests in protecting those groups , while russian military has no interests in violating turkish border . 
  and we are not . 
  russia is the country with second most powerful army in the world and enough capabilities to enforce our interests in case of agression . 
   and started to kill tatars one by one how many crimean tatars have been killed since 2014 ? 
   the comfort of russian nationals in turkey unfortunatly noone is going to travel there any ore unless current or future leadership will start to deescalate the situation . 
  nato reconossanse planes regulary fly near russian borders in similar fashion russian planes do . 
  sometimes willingly or not they violate our airspace . 
  the normal procedure is to scramble jets , intercept and escort them out . 
  a shoot down is only possible if the plane is irresponsive to : radio and visual signals from the interceptor jets pilots . 
  also a warning shot is usually fired before bringing it down . 
  an exception maybe a jet flying at the altitude unreachable by our interceptors , then visual communication or warning shot is not possible . 
   1 ) russian jets have been violating turkish airspace for the past 3 months . 
  there is a limit to how many times you can break international law . 
  2 ) russian jets ignored every warning given to them , and did not once reply to a request to `` go south '' immediately . 
  allegedly . 
   3 ) russian ambassador was summoned and told there would be consequences for further ** bombing of turkish border allies ** and continuing to violate turkish airspace . 
  ah the true reason . 
  someone got mad because daesh oil transporters and installations got bombed . 
  also those poor poor an nusra jihadists , someone must protect them against evil russia . 
  because it was turkey the country which harmed russia not the other way around , what happens if similar incedent repeats itself , but turkey will be the main offended party ? 
  for example , turkish jet enters syrian air space and its gets downed by russian aa forces ? 
  what will local nationalists will do to our tourists ? 
  regarding turks visiting russia , there rules about business visas that were overlooked before , but now are enforced . 
  because people attending a business forum by no way are tourists . 
  if russian bomber indeed violated turkish airspace , then shooting it down for being in your airspace for less than 20 seconds -- it 's unproportionate response and therefore an act of agression itself unprecedented in russian-nato relationship . 
  if russian jet did n't violate your airspace ( and i tend to believe my ministry of defense on this one ) , it is even more sever act of agression , an act of war even . 
  in any of both cases there will be consecuences for such actions . 
  and what did turkey leadership thought would happen ? 
  i hope western countries do n't start ww3 , when we start shooting down turkish jets that are bombing kurds . 
  global food market is one of customers and not suppliers . 
  they distabilize themselves just fine . 
  it 's just some politicians are attention whoring by pointind at `` hand of moscow '' for most of their problems . 
  the problem with bombing campaign is that you try to choose very well your targets and timing to avoid civilian casualties . 
  but in this i highly doubt that there will be any consideration for people living in that particular area . 
  those turkmen jihadists on syria 's side of the border ... oh boy . 
  there are done , so done . 
  yes , and what did i say , read carefully please . 
  ukraine stopped paying for the gas recently . 
  against turkey 1v1 ( mostly ) . 
  not global conflicts in which russia faced more important enemies that the ottomans . 
  my ancestors sure did . 
  anyhow turkey leadership should note history lessons from it . 
  we won the last 10 wars against them . 
  apart from radioactive contamination there are no differences with thermobaric bombs . 
  except those are newer than tactical nuclear bombs and therefore there are less in russian/usa stocks . 
  there are strategical nuclear devices created to destroy strategic locations , industries , bases , highly populated areas ... and then there are tactical nuclear bombs , created to destroy concentration of enemy forces . 
  you can perfectly use tactical nuclear bombs in a regular conflict , if you do n't care for the stigma . 
  we 'll do for sure , dont doubt it . 
  after they expel you from nato for supporting isis .
