  google translate fail . 
  ** edit : ** actually i wrote it in polish and google translate gives another version \u0ca0_\u0ca0 a pole that has basic knowledge of russian . 
  time to bomb ankara then . 
  all those are gentitive cases that mean origin or property ( just like in latin ) . 
  in polish - sky , - ich in ukrainian - ko , - yak , - yuk in russian - ov , - ev , - in are typical , but can be exchanged , because of ancestral origin mostly . 
  thanks captain . 
  dnepr river comes from russia and belarus . 
  let 's cut it too maybe ? 
  depends on the functionality . 
  if the portal is supossed to intersact with existing complex databases , then it can cost that and a lot more . 
  like those fansy electronic citezenship services estonia or russia have . 
   there 's no way you are lifting more a few months pre comp training unless you 're nervous . 
  previous cycle to the championship can be 99 % controlled , everyday routine , all minute accounted : food , sleep , training time , home situation . 
  if someone goes to any championship away from his home he loses time to travel , his schedule , probably food , day zone + nerves as you said . 
  obviously his cycle will peak at the event , but unless the event is in his home town or a day trip away ( which also can be stressful ) it can be normal to underperform . 
  at least how i extrapolate this from the pl to classic weightlifting . 
  that plus as you said the ` vitamins ' . 
   i 'm not pretending the us is any better , but they are bad at weightlifting cause it 's one of the few sports that they actually test . 
  my hypothesis would be is that their home sports ( like american football ) are taking all the good athletes . 
  because wl does n't pay as much . 
  yes but in training he ( apart from taking substances ) also can be on the top of his training macro-cycle and do 240 there . 
  and during olympics he does n't have that boost from the training routine . 
  anyway all , or almost all pros dope , at least in russia ( and other countries which compete with similar results : china , usa , all ex-soviet countries , germany , turkey ... ) . 
  there is an interesting [ interview with koklyaev ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni8vlaq_kvs ) ( if you know who he is ) subtitled , in which they touch the subject . 
  ** edit : ** in the video he talks about it at around 26:00 , obviously being both practising athletes he does n't speak about it directly . 
  but if you have practiced the sport , you know what [ he is talking about ] ( https://youtu.be/ni8vlaq_kvs?t=35m00s ) . 
   i 'm just saying that it is possible to be professional without drugs if your country is n't tolerant of drugs . 
  doping is not always illegal drugs , there are the testosterone boosters i talked you before ( substances that boost your own testosterone production , and which are not in the list of forbidden substances ) . 
  there are also people who take drugs in the career start , then when they become undetectable enter competition . 
  because in heavy sports , the results do n't dissipate , unless you traumatize yourself or stop training . 
  and maybe in norway because of small population you can manage to do it , but in any big country like russia , or usa , or even poland -- you train all your life , make 350kg , then there are dozens of people who can do 355-360 with the same body weight and who used doping in the past . 
  therefore you take a sample ( at least from big countries ) and people who participated in olympic weightlifting or powerlifting and you will get a number close to 100 % of people who used doping . 
  another question would that there are no such tests , that can detect either clever methods of hiding it , or users from the past who stopped . 
  well there goes your answer . 
  350 is hell of a result for somebody who does n't dope , but in russia , for example 350 for his weight he would n't get the international master of sports status , therefore we would n't even get a shot of participating at olympics since there are so many people much stronger than him . 
  and you can ask him which % he thinks uses doping ( at least before entering pro scene , to gain main parameters and then just maintains the results ) not just in russia , china or usa , in his own national team which % ? 
  you can get to 85 kg bodymass in powerlifting and heavy athletics only with supplements but for almost all population it would be impossible to get master of sports ( or the analogue title in norway ) without somekind of testosterone booster ( there are some legal options btw ) . 
  if your friend has good genetics for lifting ( high % of white muscle , which is typical for scandinavians , balts and northerns slavs ) he almost surely will never get a record in his weight bracket . 
  and the fact that he manages to enter official competition has more to do with a relatively small population in norway . 
  when i practiced eveyone who started training for candidate to master were already chewing on some metandristerol or some shit like that , except those who were in their 60-70kg , because there the genetics and good training is what dominates mostly . 
  may i guess that he is in under 70kg bracket ? 
  all people who practice professional sports use doping of some kind , most of it is illegal . 
  you can buy old btr either in russia or belarus for under 20k , the only catch is that it 's amortization would be around 90-95 % , so you can buy several . 
  one to ride and others for spare parts . 
  lj is owned by a russian company . 
  a bit less than half of population was and it is christian , and that was the reason for those civil wars i told you above . 
   i mean is there any prosperous islam county with democratical ruling system which tolerate minorities of any kind ? 
  if you exclude a couple civil wars in the past lebanon fits in and it 's in the same region . 
   there are large numbers of islamist groups who could take over from isis . 
  none are as powerful but who says they ca n't become in the vacuum that will be created ? 
  the only way to fill the vacuum is after daesh and other extremists are hit into submissive position -- pour money into the region to help it recover and develop . 
  i 'm upvoting this post so us much people us possible see this new excrement of informnapalm.org, 
   also a reminder that mass surveillance does n't freaking work to protect against these sort of attacks . 
  i could n't say . 
  because the law only has 6 month and to build infrastructure for mass surveillance you need at least 2 years . 
  better example would be boston marathon bombings , in which cia had so much intel , that they were ** saturated ** and mostly ignored russian fsb warnings . 
  from [ national statistics bureau ] ( http://www.gks.ru/wps/wcm/connect/rosstat_main/rosstat/ru/statistics/accounts/ ) , under : 1 . 
  ( * in current prices * ) then a simple formula ( add extraction and refinery , divide by total ) in calc to calculate the % . 
  so ** oil and gas make up to 11,02 % of russian gdp ** . 
  obviously there are connected sectors like production of metal pipes , pumps , drilling rigs ... then there are depending sectors , like services of accountability , legal , provisions for the oil companies . 
  those will be directly affected , but later . 
  and those could affect others that depend on them , this way causing a recession spiral in our economy . 
  but for now if oil and gas prices go down 50 % , then the same is expected to happen to the sector share in russian gdp ( going from 11 % to 5,5 % ) . 
  and important note , this happens only on numbers for now , because the production in short term is the same quantity . 
  in mid term it may reduce the quantity , or not . 
  and in long term it will be reduced for sure ( because no investments are made in new oil fields ) . 
  ah , yes you are right in that . 
  about economy being oil reliant -- we 'll to what extent it will harm us in the next 2-3 years . 
  yes , but what it has to do with my commentary ? 
  that table does n't take in account the prices , it is meaningless . 
  it converts directly the rubles and zloty into euros with current exchange rates . 
   polish people make double no , they do n't . 
  oil and gas are around 10 % of our economy ( in terms of national currency ) . 
  the prices go down 2 times . 
  therefore 10/2 = 5 % fall is expected . 
  at least . 
  will this traspass into other sectors of the economy is yet to see ... 1st sector is doing great , industry is actually doing good , if you exclude all related to extraction , transportation an refinement of gas and oil . 
  services are stagnating a bit , but banking sector is being sanitized , which is good . 
  foreign debt reduced over that period of time twice the amount our reserves have . 
  and the government debt has increased a couple of % , but it is stil one of the lowest among g20 . 
  we should do such threads by period and genre . 
  also people should post a top10 or something . 
  because there are stories that are just too famous , like don quijote in case of spain or war and peace in case of russia , or hamlet in case of england . 
  you have to realize that some southern countries like spain did better in terms of debt/deficit before the crisis . 
  and northern countries just benefited too much because of the low interests during almost a decade , because of better pr . 
  if not , who will buy all the stuff produced ? 
  you either have an utopia based on automatism in which nobody has to work for food on the table or you have antiutopia in which corporations will find way to exterminate people they have no use for ( see 1st deus-ex game ) . 
  why nobody pronounces their family name correctly ? 
  i saw an acussation claiming that it is a trophy . 
  some people are just to wit for their good . 
   now everything is 30 % more expensive . 
  i share your pain , dat gtx 980 for 50 000 :(, 
  you dont say ? 
  country literally absorbs jobs and investments from half-continent , why could that be ? 
   also what with this so desired independence ? 
  can somebody explain me , please . 
  catalonya is like ukrainian ssr in the 1991 . 
   i was just reading about the recent catalan elections , and it turns out that this parlimentary vote ( the `` in favour '' of the split ) has less than half of the population 's backing . 
  how is this legal ? 
  legality does n't come from popular support , that would be legitimacy .
