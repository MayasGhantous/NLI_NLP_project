   the us had the theory a year before prokhorov 's 1958 paper and built the first functioning laser in 1960 , so if you want firsts , the us technically had it . 
  erm ... masers were created in 1954 by prohorov and basov in ussr , and in parallel by townes in usa . 
  they all got nobel for that . 
  lasers :3, 
  also 7zip . 
  do n't know if irony or not , since it 's one of ukrainian main news web-portals . 
  so the leader of her group is [ being investigated ] ( http://zn.ua/politics/eks-komandira-aydara-melnichuka-obvinyayut-v-prichastnosti-k-trem-ubiystvam-175845_.html ) in kiev for creating a gang and several murders , but she becomes war hero ? 
  i did n't skip , i quoted and i invited you to read whole interview . 
   they claim they 've been studying the archives - what is your reason to not believe it ? 
  because they provide 0 copies from the archives ( which can be easily taken with official seal ) and they are known anti-communist organization funded by foreign governments . 
  and the lead investigator seem to be a bit insane . 
  why they base it on census data ? 
  because the difference for poles between 26 and 39 census is around 130 thousands . 
  if they claimed more it would be suspicious . 
  but they accommodated the maximum number , but they screwed up because they did n't check the migration from the union data , which between 1926 and 1939 is estimated between 1,5 and 2 million people , many of who went to europe ( poland included ) . 
   as recent as 2010 even in ukraine which is quite a bit more open in regards to nkvd archives you could only go inside , without permission to take any pictures , you were only allowed to copy data by hand . 
  not case of russia , all declassified documents can be copied , or at least referenced by their registry number . 
  so someone like me could go and check . 
   do you have any evidence of fair trial for those people ? 
  how could there have been fair trial if nkvd order explicitly says that it is troika that sentences people and punishment ( whether execution or gulag ) happens immediately . 
  no , troika is not a fair trial , it does n't mean that the rate of conviction was 100 % . 
  and not everyone who was arrested even went to trial . 
  there were preliminary arrests , investigation , interrogations , etc. . . ** edit ** : and as for proofing of poles migrating to poland , for example from polish [ wikipedia ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierwszy_powszechny_spis_ludno\u015bci ) :  wyniki pierwszego powszechnego spis ludno\u015bci zosta\u0142y publikowane w serii statystyka polski w 29 tomach , z kt\u00f3rych ostatni zosta\u0142 wydany w 1932 roku . 
   you claim it was census data . 
  gorlanov , tsaplin , zemskov and others claim to have studied official reports from nkvd/kgb . 
  do you have any evidence to support your claim ? 
  it would be diabolical proof , since i can not proof that something did n't happen . 
  they should have published certified copies from the archives on which they base their numbers . 
  maybe it 's all made up , or maybe they just publish the numbers for all arrested and prosecuted during aug 1937 - sep 1938 . 
  it 's just people give credibility to a society whose main investigator goes to radio and says that during great purge ( 1937-1938 ) : '' * [ 1000 's of millions were arrested ] ( http://echo.msk.ru/programs/staliname/677212-echo/ ) , it is a statistical data * '' . 
  and then the interviewer seeing the clear error asks again and he responds : '' * yes , 1500 millions * '' . 
  that is the lead investigator of memo.ru and the source for the 111 091 poles executed . 
  since you are ukrainian i recommend to read the whole interview and make your own assumptions about his mental health . 
  ( at the end of the interview he were explained during pause his error , and he corrected it ) . 
   15000 people in 10 days . 
  yes , that would be more likely , responding to the order in question that you quoted before :  all not yet arrested active members of pov according to lists ;  all remaining prisoners of war of polish army ;  immigrants from poland , ignoring their immigration date ;  political emigrants and people exchanged due to political reasons ;  former members of antisoviet political parties ;  most active local antisoviet nationalistic elements of polish regions ; it does n't mean that they were all subjected to investigation , to trial , found guilty and later executed . 
   after reading all this - do you honestly believe in any kind of fair investigation and trial to be performed for those massive amounts of people ? 
  obviously i say that the numbers are taken from the census , they placed a number not based on reports as they , but allocated a maximum number that would be credible at least with the census difference between 26 and 39 . 
  that ignores the fact that almost 2 million people migrated from ussr in the 20 's and 30 's . 
  if they were basing their data on so called reports , they would publish them with ` seal ' of the archive . 
  white-blue-red were first used on [ oryol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_frigate_oryol ) but it is unknown if in form of stripes or cross , or other form . 
  since it has been discussed on the subreddit before i 'll tell that people will links an article in a russian anti-communist society memo.ru , that tells such story among many others . 
  on which they base it : difference of 110 thousands between two census , an order to investigate the presence of polish spies in soviet union among people who entered the soviet union from poland for whatever reason since the polish-soviet war . 
  that 's it . 
  ** edit : ** here is [ the source ] ( http://www.memo.ru/history/polacy/00485-1.htm ) for the 111091 number . 
  actually we 'd prefer never happened in this case , since it 's all made up . 
  at some point some dissident compared the numbers for poles between 1926 and 1939 and considered the difference as victims of purges . 
  while in reality it 's unknown if there were victims at all or that number migrated to poland in that decade . 
  yes , that 's my point . 
  ppp makes prices equal when comparing different countries . 
  so 1 kg of gold is 1 kg of gold . 
  obviously there are complications because the production around the globe is not homogeneous . 
  but it makes perfectly illustrates the point . 
  for example , 1 metric ton of rice made in china will cost much less than 1 metric ton of rice in european union . 
  if no correction coefficient is applied , then the product in eu will add more to the gdp while it 's the same metric ton of rice . 
  since that happens with many products . 
  agencies which calculate and compare countries gdp take a sample of products and prices and compare them , deriving a ppp coefficient . 
  so all the production is estimated in more or less the same prices , therefore being able to compare real size of their economy ( the production of goods and the services ) . 
   if you accuse others of being biased and to certain degree live in propaganda bubble you right away have to admit that you yourself are in same circumstance yes i am , and i 'm aware of it . 
  but economics is one thing i have studies in , and we studied by mostly us published books , so i 'm also have more or less big picture . 
  i also do n't watch tv and gather my information from multiple sources . 
  therefore just in this topic i have very low bias . 
   germany produces huge amount of globally successful brands while russia almost none . 
  german brands are final goods for customers , some of which are world wide known ( mercedes ) , others are less known ( bosch ) , and some are more specific and known only among specialists ( silex ) . 
  in russia mostly components are made , machinery , steel plates and pieces . 
  there are very few good final goods brands , and those which are good are not known outside russia . 
  so there are firms like bork , which home appliances i ( and anyone who used them ) would prefer to bosch , but it 's almost unknown outside cis . 
   but of course it does !, 
  what economy is bigger , one that produces 1 kg of gold or another that produces 1t of packed soil ? 
  the thing about ppp is that it places the same traded items and services at same price between countries . 
  so the question would be , which country produces more one which produces 1kg of gold or another that produces 1kg of gold ? 
  in both countries the price of gold is different . 
  that 's the flaw of your main point . 
   could manipulate their domestic prices and claim that 1t of cheese costs 1rouble . 
  you can not manipulate the prices without creation of deficit , like it was in soviet union , for example . 
  the ppp coefficients are estimated by international organizations that have top professionals of the field of economy working for them : imf , world bank , un ... 
  if something was manipulated for pure statistics they would note so . 
  while the exchange rate is manipulated for other economical reasons . 
  if countries would n't manipulate it , and the information would be perfect ( 0 risks , just like in initial adam smith models ) then the levels of prices would be more or less similar between countries and such coefficient would n't be necessary . 
   explain me like i 'm 5 . 
  ok dear boy , imagine that there different countries in the world , and people who live in thouse countries produce goods and provide services to each other and also to the foreigners . 
  in exchange they also recieve goods and services from each other and the foreigners . 
  so one day the economists , people who are experts in the field of such things decide to create a meassure for those goods and services produced in a given territory or country in a given period of time . 
  they called that tool gdp and it was created for 2 fundamental reasons : firstly , to compare the performance of one country 's production from year to year . 
  and simple solution would be calculate it nominal using the total value amount of goods and services purchased ( or sold , depending on the methodology ) in a given territory + net exports , that from the year in question divided by the base year . 
  the problem would be that , the nominal would n't account for inflation , therefore if almost always account much more ` growth ' than there was in reality . 
  so we must calculate the ` real ' growth , by deflating the gdp by the coefficient we take from estimating the inflation ( increase of global prices in a given country in a given period ) . 
  that real estimate is the correct one to observe the evolution of a given economy in time . 
  secondly , gdp was used to compare economy size between countries . 
  and the problem instantly came because each country statistical bureau estimated their gdp in the national currency . 
  one possible solution , like in previous example , would be to calculate it nominal , just by converting at current exchange rate such quantities and be done with it . 
  but from here comes the flow , since we used economical value units ( currency ) to estimate goods and services we are now comparing two countries with possibly different prices levels . 
  but then we are no longer comparing real size , but something else . 
  therefore economists have decided that to compare one country with another ( just like with year prices in previous example ) we should calculate all gdp conversions at the same level of prices . 
  with this we can actually compare the real size of the economies ( for the estimated number of goods and services ) and not abstract currency numbers . 
  this is how [ purchasing power parity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/purchasing_power_parity ) coefficient was created . 
  this ` coefficient ' is applied to the nominal values of the gdp so they can be compared one with another . 
  but it 's not very objective , each agency tends to have a couple of % difference because of the composition of basic ` sample ' is used to compare the levels of prices . 
  anyway such agencies have done such estimates , and by those it seems that russian economy [ was bigger than german ] ( http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/gdp_ppp.pdf ) at certain point . 
  [ or not ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html ) .
