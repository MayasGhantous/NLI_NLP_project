   in reality , it was one if not the most least bad . 
  [ ahem ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/demomex-1518-1623.png ) . 
   eh ... no , not really . 
  do n't tell it in words , draw a polandball comic about it . 
  while rugen is historically slavonic it is in germany . 
  how dull you are to think that circumnavigating the world in 11 days in a balloon is a poor use of time ? 
  where is your adventurer spirit ? 
   the article is a source . 
  you do n't have to believe it . 
  but us officials are basing the assumption it is russia off of their own intelligence investigations . 
  someone took a shit in my doorstep . 
  must be russian spies . 
  / s oh wait , no / s the article , as people tell me , is serious . 
  next you know russians will be blamed for drinking all water and causing droughts . 
  never understood people mocking when someone asks for source . 
   yes , it is a serious article , ivan . 
  it is also a standard practice of russians security services why do you think it were secret services and not just extreme nationalists or other thugs ? 
  most russians in this sub know of certain serb that at one point took a piss at us embassy in moscow , does n't mean he works for gru . 
  putin 's secretary told the news that erdogan called and apologized . 
  no confirmation from turkey 's officials yet . 
  but if they do n't deny it soon , it probably happened . 
   russian intruders had broken into their homes late at night , only to rearrange the furniture or turn on all the lights and televisions , and then leave is this a serious article or something like the onion ? 
   moscow from being one of the regions whose money it 's not moscow 's money . 
   this map is n't about that , it 's about what regions ' money are used to sustain other regions are you really that dense ? 
  where does that '' * region 's money * '' comes from ? 
  from taxes . 
  does moscow collects taxes only on the economical activity that is done in moscow ? 
  moscow also collects money from other regions activity . 
  how is that possible ? 
  because many regional companies and businesses have their hq in moscow . 
  and they pay almost 100 % of their taxes in moscow . 
  meanwhile they can have up to 95 % of their economical activity in another regions . 
  by that moscow effectively drains other regions of cash , therefore that map you posted is no valid , it 's void of content . 
  because moscow does n't donate to other regions like it suggests . 
   wrong . 
  look at this map the map forgets to mention , that lots of corporations have hq in moscow , while the base operations are in province , which lead to taxes being paid in moscow . 
   eu does n't have the muscle to defend its own members in eastern europe . 
  it would be brexit-level stupidity to kick us out when they are the only ones who can keep baltics , poland safe . 
  poland can defend themselves just fine . 
  while baltic countries are not defendable in any case or scenario . 
  russian troops can take riga , talin and vilnius in 48 hours regardless of the number of troops or prevention plans nato has . 
   they should be economically punished as hard as possible . 
  taking example from my country in this case is not the best idea , i think . 
  i propose shared sovereignty over latvia , 
  interesting if it will affect < 20bn $ lawsuit of gasprom against ukraine . 
   i can buy a 75 year old ** brandy ** for like 200 $ there . 
  it 's insane ftfy, 
  there is a thing called reputation , and scientology ` church ' has very bad one everywhere . 
   you also want to choose the best ideology for other people , that 's exactly what was highly regarded by leo strauss : the philosophy king . 
  now i 'm not suggesting you ca n't choose the best thing for other people , i 'm just saying that people will not agree with this , they will rebel , it 's part of their nature . 
  what i 'm talking about is removing the harmful ideologies , those which condone and/or promote use of tools such as : violence , oppression , limitation of rights and exploitation . 
  i 'm not saying this one or that one * is * the ideology of the people . 
  of course , if i have to choose between two ideologies , being an ** ideology always an evil ** i 'll choose the lesser one . 
  and there are certain forms of opposing ideologies that are equally almost harmless , for example : which is lesser evil social-democracy or true liberalism . 
  i do n't know , both have quite productive forms . 
   you are free to believe whatever you like what if someone believes something horribly harmful , like that it is ok to kill infidels , and that though it empowered by his ideology ? 
  should that ideology spread be permitted , or should it be restricted ? 
   it is illegal in russia to criticize the orthodox church 's theological position on gays never positioned russia as perfect state that is aligned with my ideas . 
  i feel for russian people , being mostly ethnic russian myself and sharing most of common ` interests ' . 
  the history of homosexuality in russia in complicated and not entirely linked to orthodox church . 
  prior russian opening to europe by peter i ( 18th century ) - sources indicate that homosexuality was not criminalized in russia . 
  later on it became so , being decriminalized after the revolution of 1917 only to be criminalized again during that period of time , which was clearly atheistic in nature . 
  while it was not criminalized during orthodox church maximum power period ( prior peter i , who abolished patriarchate ) . 
  right now the church is obviously against homosexuality , but so are radical nationalists and communists ( who are mostly atheists ) . 
  homophobia against male homosexuality is pretty common feature of all russian population . 
  there seem to be some kind of rupture in the channel of communication which leads you to believe that i 'm a neo-conservative . 
  i am not . 
  obviously i like to read many authors from all of the spectrum ( because everyone can have an interesting idea , worth contemplating ) , but i do n't recall ever being interested in neocons , they are too binary , with weird people like those socialists that later in life become new born christians . 
   i 'll never stop them or supress them from thinking freely , which is exactly what your neocon friends and putin 's orthodox cronies are doing . 
  does removal of scientology church enters your conception of the suppression of free thinking ? 
   cut your leo straussian crap like , now , buddy . 
  i 've wasted too much time debating fuckers like that . 
  the fact it 's ardent follower , the neocons , almost bankrupted america and is bankrupting russia as we speak , is self evident . 
  neocons ? 
  if i had to situate myself somewhere in the political spectrum it would be quite far from those guys . 
  some ideas of nationalists are good , some ideas from marxism are good . 
  some methods proposed are outdated , some are not . 
  first thing is to determine the interests -- what final result and intermediary points we want to achieve and then choose the most efficient tools based on scientific method . 
   in fact , if someone claims he has to spread lies to achieve the greater good , then i am very much qualified to question whether this so called ` greater good ' itself is also part of the lie . 
  it is as simple as that . 
  i do n't advocate for lying . 
  in fact , i said the most productive ideologies must be preserved . 
  and if we had to choose between marxism-leninism and christian orthodoxy , i 'd choose marxism every single time , because that ideology is based on better philosophy and is not filled with mythical figures and general bullshit . 
  if i had to choose between islam and christianity , i 'll choose christianity every single time , because christian holy book has hundred times less calls for irrational violence than islam . 
  and in islam if i have to choose between relatively peaceful sufism and radical salafism -- i 'll choose sufism every single time . 
  if you try to vacate the society of all ideology , in no time new virulent and aggressive forms will appear : sects , cults , radical extremist groups ... because most people need some sort of ideology , you can not train most of the population to live without it . 
  i also prefer it over * weltanschauung * . 
   but a country where the majority of people are clinging to spiritual or religious service to make their lives somewhat bearable , must be a failed one . 
  i do n't see it like that exactly . 
  in general most of the people are incapable of producing their own original cosmovision . 
  like explaining the present , and the past , predicting the future and finding the * raison d'etre * for themselves . 
  ideology is a [ memetic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memetics ) construct that base itself on very simple and understandable principles and normally a full ideology covers most of the topics of life and death . 
  many times we can see complicated philosophical systems serve as base for much simpler and attainable ideologies . 
  like for example , marxism , which is actually quite sophisticated philosophy that through hegelian triad to analyse history , predict the future and draw conclusions for the present . 
  turns into a simpler set of principles as ` equality of opportunities ' , ` control of means of production ' and ` dictatorship of the proletariat ' that are understandable for the masses which in case of acceptance of this ideology start to operate with cliches and memes like that . 
  or buddhism , which is also quite complicated philosophical system - turned into religion for most of it 's branches . 
  rational mind should attack any ideology it finds , since it is a closed system , a prison cell for ideas . 
  religious views , political ideologies , atavisms of the past -- are like chains on a free thinker . 
  but not everyone is a free thinker and is capable of finding his or her own unique form of understanding the world and even in this case it is not always going to be a smart way . 
  for these cases , relatively peaceful and productive ideologies should be preserved in the society for people to absorb , otherwise new more virulent and aggressive ones , like scientology could take their place and ` welcome back , dark ages ' .
