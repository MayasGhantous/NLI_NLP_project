  but is n't her case a complete oposite ? 
  she was ukrainian military helicopter pilot , and then she left to join aidar ? 
   i guess they realised that they could no longer get anything useful out of her . 
  sending her to ukraine is the best way to undermine poroshenko government , since she is kinda patriotic/nationalistic ex-member of [ aidar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aidar_battalion ) therefore i suppose she does n't approve minsk ii . 
  since she is very recognizable any critique from her towards current regime in ukraine can lay some serious media blows to already unpopular president poroshenko . 
  our government denies that those are soldiers . 
  let 's see how the tune will change once they arrive to the motherland . 
  wow svinokolbasin at 1:07 . 
  i hope one day rl puts me on their video too . 
  genocide written between apostrophes -- dick move dw.com, 
  no , what he says is correct . 
  automatic universal manipulators can replace ( and actually do replace in many cases human force already - see [ tesla factory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnd6jeifxb4 ) ) , after aprox . 
  2020 those systems would replace not only static workforce ( labour in factories , closed areas ) but also dynamic jobs , like lorry-drivers and taxis ( see dozens of projects of auto-driving vehicles ) . 
  and in service jobs we already have enchanced databases with sort-of ia like watson and others that help in legal and medicine . 
  in networks the populatization of cloud reduces drastically the number of it specialists needed ( a couple dozen sysadmins to serve a datacenter which provides for thousands of companies which no longer need a dedicated sysadmin specialist ) . 
  etc etc, 
   half of latvia 's population lives in the riga metropolitan area and they do n't even have metro . 
  is key to some of our shipments to syria . 
  is gibraltar protected by nato ? 
  all that hysteria in the media starting with the submarines and misquoting our minister of exterior is just to manipulate people to vote ` yes ' for nato membership . 
  the amount of dust released would cause a small [ ice age ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_winter ) which would probably kill you all . 
   romanian people on this subreddit make romania sound pretty cool they are trying to compensate all the pr damage gypsies do to their country . 
   i think we 're the only country in the world , that 's putting billionaires in jail . 
  also chinese do that , also they put them against the wall . 
  like you did with ceausescu . 
  you have lots in common .

   who will be going to war with whom ? 
  well if somehow navalny gets to power , there can be between the people who would support him ( needs support to get to power , duh ) . 
  and the people who would oppose him . 
  their privileges as a * estate * were abolished after the revolution . 
  so now anyone can call himself a cossack . 
  there are multiple organizations serious and clowns . 
  most of them are just vigilantes . 
  in some regions they were recognized a status of public miltia . 
   hint : read the headline . 
  yeah right , if having civil war is changing things for the better , than maybe .

  already had [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4i0ot3/russias_valery_gergiev_conducts_concert_in/ ) on / r/europe . 
   does moscow neglect the east ? 
  \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0436\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c , they take too much taxes , wish they reinvest more in my hometown . 
   the us is not perfect at least here the political opposition does not end up dead and the leaders children do not suddenly become billionaires . 
  to answer that , one should ask himself what comes first : the spirit or the matter ? 
  and does it matter at all ? 
   must suck to live in a country with crooked politicians . 
  oh the irony is rich !, 
   i think it would be very stupid to pay money for such things . 
  look at germans , it 's not like they are more efficient and less lazy than rest of europeans , but they invested a ton of time and money into all that * ordnung * pr , some even started to believe in it . 
   he also conducted a concert in tskhinvali after the war with georgia . 
  great conductor , but questionable ethics . 
  well he is ossetian , so you could n't question his principles in that . 
  yes , but the people moved . 
  so you never know , for example : many tribes from caucasus mountains ended up in spain . 
  slavs expanded from modern poland/ukraine in all directions . 
  germans expanded south from modern denmark . 
  etc etc, 
  which was your original name anyway ? 
  hey , we do n't think you are gypsies . 
  in russian gypsies are \u0446\u044b\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0435 ( tsiegany ) , and romanians are \u0440\u0443\u043c\u044b\u043d\u044b ( ruminy ) . 
   and neither was finland in 1906 . 
  it was a grand duchy , part of the russian empire . 
  finland had it 's own legislative body since they were incorporated in 1807-1809 . 
  good . 
   take the national theatre for example it 's so pretty o __ o, 
  tssssh ... do n't spoil the narrative . 
  it 's not fake , the title might lead someone who does n't understand law to think that domestic violence is now legal , but the article covers it well :  the bill would remove the charge of `` battery within families '' from russia 's criminal code , downgrading it to an administrative offence . 
  criminal charges would only be brought against offenders if familial beatings took place more than once a year . 
  because vallar57 does n't know that decriminalising means . 
  decriminalize - means exclude from criminal code . 
  and that what in fact is happening . 
   if once an angry * tourist * has been to this country hmmm ... 
  only from legal point of view , but from moral point of view it would be the same . 
  the aqueduct does n't even need resources to provide water to crimea , so they built a dam to stop the water flowing . 
  the river from which ukrainian government cut the aqueduct starts in russia . 
  should by your logic russian government divert the flow of water from russian territory up north ? 
   the contents of the quote are horrible but they could be said by anyone during a drunken haze . 
  is it really reasonable to prosecute random facebook rants like that ? 
  its not a random facebook rant , its an article in a ukrainian newspaper that he reposted among other things . 
  if it was reposted , for example , in a state of drunken haze , he should allege that in court . 
  that is how justice system should work , prosecute for objective realities , and then consider alleged subjective circumstances during the trial . 
   is it really reasonable to be sentenced to years in jail for an opinion on facebook ? 
  that mostly a philosophical question . 
  i posted my original reply , because the original article from op is a biased one which operates with half-truths . 
  because from the title you can get an idea that you can be prosecuted in russia for posting that `` crimea is ukraine '' . 
  however the reality is different , the article explains it :  andrei bubeev , the russian blogger serving a 2.5 year sentence for social network reposts of an article entitled `` crimea is ukraine '' . 
  which is true but , the linked original article is in russian , so most of the readers would n't bother to read/translate it and base their opinion on the neutral quotes from the `` crimea is ukraine '' and deduce that it is just a critical article of russian political regime . 
  however that article is in fact a clear example of a hate speech manifesto . 
  and just if you substitute russians with jews and russia with israel ( ukraine with palestina and so on ... ) you would get a text that will result in conviction for hate speech crime in most european countries . 
  again , i dont really want to debate philosophical questions our of it . 
  rather point that the article op posted is biased and produces misinformation in the mind of the reader . 
   agree or disagree with his opinion but that is hardly incitement for genocide . 
  you can use google translate yourself , this paragraph is unequivocally calling to exterminate over 100 000 people . 
  whole article can be clearly interpreted as incitement of hatred , article that is present in most criminal codes of europe . 
   maybe when the us claims the me as a new state ? 
  why any idiot would assume responsibilities of the people in that way when you can install a puppet government and loot the economy ?
