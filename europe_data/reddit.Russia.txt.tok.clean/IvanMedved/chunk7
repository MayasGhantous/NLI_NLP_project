  therefore 2 times more than european average . 
  also all other sources like statista.com i mentioned below or [ hydrocarbons-technology . com ] ( http://www.hydrocarbons-technology.com/features/featurethe-10-biggest-oil-refining-countries/ ) place russian refining capabilities on 3rd place after usa and china . 
  that done in absolute numbers . 
  but taking in account much lower population and industry , i can with certain degree of certenity say that ** russia has more than enough refining capabilities to provide for itself and several other countries ** . 
  you can see anyone related to production/trade : [ this one ] ( https://www.fuelseurope.eu/uploads/modules/dataroom/graphs_fuels_europe-_2015_12.jpg ) , or [ this one ] ( https://www.fuelseurope.eu/uploads/modules/dataroom/graphs_fuels_europe-_2015_5.jpg ) , in 2003-2007 [ all gasoil imported by eu was russian , then usa came to the market ] ( https://www.fuelseurope.eu/uploads/modules/dataroom/graphs_fuels_europe-_2015_14.jpg ) , also look at this one about [ refining capacity ] ( https://www.fuelseurope.eu/uploads/modules/dataroom/graphs_fuels_europe-_2015_34.jpg ) ( interestingly belarus and kazakhstan are included in eurasia group , while russia has it 's own ) . 
  also i found another nice [ source ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/273579/countries-with-the-largest-oil-refinery-capacity/ ) for the refinery capabilities . 
  i could also provide a source for the fact that 50 % of russian-produced gasoil/diesel is exported , and around 10 % of our gasoline ( also in 2016 is expected to even increase the production due to several refineries being upgraded ) . 
  we have domestic price controls on gasoline , because of that refineries try to export as much as they can . 
  all domestic consumption is homemade , over 50 % of diesel production goes to export and so does over 10 % of gasoline . 
  the article is full of shit . 
  ** edit ** : might as well add a [ source ] ( https://www.fuelseurope.eu/dataroom ) ** edit2 ** : actually the data i saw when i said that '' * all domestic consumption is homemade * '' was accounted for our so called trade union between russia , belarus and kazakhstan . 
  so some of the production might be in those two affiliated countries . 
  the only reason there could be a shortage , is because local refinery companies are trying to sell everything they can abroad . 
  dude with golden teeth can not even speak russian and does n't seem to understand the interviewer . 
  what evidence ? 
  everything presented in this thread are links to a report in which estonian border guards called russian border guards and said : `` here happened a trespassing '' , `` based on the path and footprints indeed it happened '' answered russian border guards . 
  after which estonian officers informed that there was a kidnapping , but they also do n't know where exactly . 
  that 's it . 
  it would be sold in the way there . 
  could be inexact in 2 places ( because of bad calligraphy ) , but that does n't impact the meaning . 
  now the translation : * in the area of the border sign to the left 30 meters has happened infringement of the border regime from the russian and estonian sides . 
  during mutual inspection we were informed by the estonian side of a disappearance of a citizen of estonian republic . 
  * * the fact of the border infringement is acknowledged by both russian and estonian sides . 
  * * during the inspection of the incident was used a video-recorder : sony handycam hdr-cx 730 *, 
  he is not quite , his duty was n't to patrol the border from what i take from estonian sources - he was border police investigator . 
  and supposedly he was meeting an informant . 
  it was most likely a trap made by russian services . 
  why go to a border at all if not for crossing it ? 
   and what wpuld they have reached with that ? 
  nothing . 
  imagine that their agent went across the border and was taken there . 
  what can be done or said about it ? 
  nothing . 
  clearly by claiming that the agent was taken from estonian soil they create an international scandal . 
  actually their news-network seemed to miss some part in subtitle translation . 
   there 's even video of it with russian border-guards agreeing with estonian border-guards where kidnapping took place . 
  maybe estonian subtitles are not exact , but they do n't agree : they are working versions based on the information from estonian borderguards . 
  if you tell me exact timeframe from the video , i 'll give you transcription that you yourself could translate in google . 
  and will also provide my translation . 
   there 's signatures of russian border-guards who testified that he was taken from estonian side . 
  no , the document published simply states that `` estonian border-guards brought us and showed us signs of struggle , also informed us that x person is missing '' . 
  it could be done postfactum by estonian border patrol . 
   the fact remains that an estonian police officer investigating over border smuggling was abducted from estonian soil by russian operatives . 
  that 's a version , not a fact . 
  how can you call it a fact when there is n't even a witness that supports it ? 
  estonian guards found signs of struggle on the ground somewhere . 
  signs in both russian and estonian territory . 
  and this is the basis of the version that he was abducted from estonia . 
  but the signs are not even solidly linked to his abduction/detention . 
   because kohver 's task specifically included investigating organized crime and had already some warnings from local government in pskov , it 's quite clear he messed with `` wrong people '' and paid the price for that . 
  so i believe he indeed was abducted in estonia . 
  even by estonian version he was abducted 2-3 meters inside estonian border . 
  in my personal opinion ( from the objects they took from him there was a large sum of money ) , he was meeting an informant to whom we was going to pay for information . 
  but the meeting was a trap made by russian special services who took him . 
  on which side of the border ? 
  i do n't know . 
  no , it 's just denied that he was abducted on estonian soil , instead detained on russian . 
  those are legends , like 300 spartans , or panfilov 's 28 ... 
  [ aria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiqds9nu_w ) !!, 
  united russia has over 2 millions party members . 
   east european nation muhahahahahahahahaha, 
  spokesman do not have much chance to be corrupt . 
  more likely it was a gift from another corrupt official . 
   i am not paid for that shit . 
  that 's not true . 
   absurdal examples of soviet-era propaganda ok , conversation finished . 
   `` i do n't like the source , so it does n't count . '', 
  because it 's not a source , they dont explain methodology or genuine source . 
  just fabricate facts . 
   so if you really want to i can easily quote said pages for you . 
  quote the methodology . 
   the numbers come from nkvd archives memo.ru is an anti-communist website and organization . 
  they have dozens of such pages with 0 factual confirmation . 
   here . 
  0 trust in nazi sources . 
  they identified bodies killed with german bullets by the newspapers they had . 
  interestingly that while they were killing millions in camps they decided to create an investigation commission for some polish soldiers they ` magically ' found . 
  extracts from soviet archives while are likely to be genuine just point out to what i mentioned before -- convicted during trials . 
  while what is written by hand seems falsification to me . 
  it has however a seal of russian state archive . 
  so i do n't know what to think about that . 
   norman davies ( 1982 ) ... you just copied sources from wikipedia . 
  sources i can not check obviously , and that in most cases , since it is en wikipedia will point to other sources in russian or polish . 
  are n't there any interviews with respectable historians ( polish or russian ) or some memory society in poland , that explains their methodology ? 
   you are right , i also doubt it . 
  the soviet government executed far more than 1/7 of its polish population . 
   there 's no need for such roundabout methods , as in this particular case you can find the entire list of at lest 111,091 poles executed by nkvd on nkvd order no . 
  i just read that order , there is not such list there . 
  there even can not be a list , because yezhov is just ordering to take action to find polish spies , and to do so he orders to preventively arrest : spies , members of polish nationalist organizations , remaining polish officers from the war , those who flee to russia from poland at any time and political exchanged . 
  arrest does n't mean that all were prosecuted , and from those prosecuted not everyone is going to be found guilty , and from those found guilty not everyone is going to be executed . 
  i highly doubt that soviet government would execute almost 1/7 of it 's polish population . 
  more likely the difference between 1926 and 1939 census is that many poles just migrated to poland . 
   they all happened to be buried at least three years before 1943 could you source that ? 
  i doubt that it is even possible by the science advances of the time to pin-point such date of death . 
   sadly , osadniks were only a small minority out of over a million poles who were deported to siberia . 
  most of deported poles , mine ancestors included , were living on those lands for centuries . 
  can you provide a better source than wikipedia ? 
  some polish memory institution must exist or something . 
   yeah , fortunately soviets abandoned the `` total extermination '' approach after germans attacked them . 
  are you just trolling right now ?
