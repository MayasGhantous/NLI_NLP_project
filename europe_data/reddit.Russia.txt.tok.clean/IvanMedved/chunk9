  whoa , for a moment i though you were describing usa . 
  its obvious putin didnt succeed yeltsin politically . 
  of course not , yeltsin was corrupt peace of shit , that was in power illegally selling out and destroying his own country . 
  also it was yeltsin who ` appointed ' putin as his successor . 
  please tell me what indicators do you use that show that russia is less democratic today than in the 90 's ? 
   before the 2000s ( before putin ruled ) russia was more of a democracy compared to the last 10 years . 
  so when boris yeltsin made a coup in 1993 and later falsified elections in 1996 -- it was more democratic because you know , we were ` friends ' with the west . 
   again , when ukrainian were advancing there were plenty of captured russians . 
  at the time there were captured some soldiers without weapons on btr dozens of km away from the conflict zone , who said they were lost . 
  and those 2 dudes who said that they are spies , but russian ministry of defence said they are not longer . 
  that does n't account even for 0,1 % of all captured , since ukrainian government side had over 3000 captives during the time of the conflict . 
  any way do you have a list with proof-pics/videos ? 
  why they are not paraded or showed to the world as the last 2 ` spies ' were ? 
  that is a strawman argument , i did not preach such versions . 
  also you are leaning away from the main argument , is that because you can not answer , rationalize or oppose it ? 
   russia to tend to strike in the back so it 's kinda hard to get prisoners that way . 
  there can not be rational explanation , that could place numerous russian group of troops in donbass while the % of captives by ukrainian army is almost 100 locals and any captures russian ( presumably military or not ) makes news . 
  only rational explanation would that there are n't any troops from russia at all , or very small group of instructors and specialists . 
  it would make other parties to no accept the elections . 
  and they inform about that . 
  and if they can not gain access to the elections points then they 'll inform about that too . 
   all that despite the sanctions . 
  then if our establishment would n't care about the sanctions why not admit it ? 
  i mean , usa invades other countries all the time and almost never tries to hide it . 
  if our troops have invaded at least half of the captives by ukrainian army would be russian soldiers . 
  while there would have been much greater results in territory control that i can observe from dnr/lnr performance . 
  i 'm proud of my people and their heritage . 
  our country ( and not just ours ) is an instrument , means to our goals . 
   we are a small country far away from civilization great how you subtly insulted us and the swedes . 
  if russian government would n't mind sanctions at all , our troops would have invaded in spring 2014 . 
  or later on . 
  not with sanctions , no . 
  i do n't see how that would change the status quo then . 
  and europeans seem unhappy with the status quo , they will keep pressing my government . 
  do n't know what will happen then . 
   and there 's not enough observers to set at each station the entire time there more than enough , it 's not a country we are talking about here . 
  but a fraction of 2 regions . 
  obviously if the elections passed with many faults - nobody will acknowledge them . 
   i do n't believe it . 
  it is a territory ruled by gangsters and pro-ukrainian candidates campaigning there would not be safe . 
  then the osce would note it as so . 
  what the problem ? 
  it 's easy to check by sending osce observers . 
   stalin apologist detected . 
  what is wrong with the russian psyche that you love genocidal leaders so much . 
  stalin killed and enslaved millions of russians . 
  i 'm not stalin apologist , stalin administration usurped power , halted ` soviet style democracy ' until his death , and lead authoritarian style policy which caused much suffering to many people . 
  in particular almost 1 million was subjected to trails and executed for political reasons . 
  millions went through labour camps ( also for political reasons ) . 
  but that does n't mean that everything that has been said against his administration is true . 
  take in account that there were 3 important regimes that denounced stalin period - nazi germany , postwar usa and khrushchev administration ( ussr ) . 
  all three regimes had relevant propaganda machines which sometimes spoke truth , sometimes exaggerated and sometimes invented things . 
  when regarding crimes against humanity performed by stalin administration , we should easily accept most of what khrushchev report talked about ( because he was interested in surfacing all the dirt , which did n't affect him personally ) + independent investigations based on archives and testimonials . 
  at present day , there are also articles published by ideological anti-communists . 
  sometimes they remind of true facts , sometimes they exaggerate , sometimes they lie . 
  if i point out that some article , or it 's source has no basis in fact , probably just because it does n't mention it 's source of information , that does n't make me stalin apologist . 
  i would be one , if i 'd say that those actions if they happened or not , were justified . 
  that would make me a stalin apologist . 
  but not the case . 
  the only relevant critique to the internationalism policies of the ussr in all you mentioned was so called russification . 
  in what it consisted ? 
  in the fact that russian language was obligatory subject in all schools . 
  parents still decided in which language their children were to study ( their native , russian or another ) . 
  if that is some sort of oppression what to do about mandatory english or spanish classes in non-english or spanish schools ? 
  or are all the world being englified ? 
   operation priboi . 
  not based on ethnic group pertinence , but on social class/membership in the dictatorial administration . 
  if you were to place examples of people being resettled based on ethnic origin , that would be crimean tatars , chechens and ingush people . 
  however there is more to it . 
   polish operation of the nkvd . 
  that article is from the same series of `` stalin killed 30 million people , personally '' . 
  ** edit ** : polish operation of the nkvd i followed the sources - most of them go to russian website memo.ru which is full of articles like that , but no other source there , no investigation . 
  they just seem to make facts up . 
  kazakhstan can be either dependent on russia or on china . 
  in second case they will be just absorbed like yugurs were . 
  soviet union desintegrated , but not for that reason . 
  during it 's existence the ethnic and cultural friction mostly was caused by organized crime -- interracial/ethnic marriages were a normal thing , radical nationalism was rare and spread among pariahs and other freaks . 
  what to do instead is internationalism - worked for soviet union , will work for eu . 
  edit : not a joke, 
   that search hardly proves anything , you can do the same with the english text and get similar results . 
  no , because in russian there is a rhyme because both monkey ( obeziyana ) and obama en in - ma / - na in russian . 
  also both begin with ob - . 
  practically both words sound very similar . 
   which is basically ussr 2.0 lite . 
  therefore , kazakhstan bans the fish . 
  comecon , ussr 2.0 would be union state of russia and belarus ( probably kazakhstan in the future ) . 
  then why you share your ` professional ' opinion ? 
  it 's not like those policemen are speacial ops who shoot at targets each day in different scenarios . 
  they have training but they are not requiered to be marksmen . 
   also a trained professional should be able to hit a moving target less than 10 meters away from him . 
  if they wanted to finish him off like we see in us police videos , where they shoot at the chest , then yes . 
  if they wanted to shoot him in the leg it would be as difficult as shooting at torso size running target at 30-40m . 
   how can you be professionally qualified to shoot a gun and miss so many shots ? 
  have you tried to shoot at moving target even once irl ? 
  or you judge from your cs : go experience ? 
  nikolaev is historically russian city populated by russians . 
  the equipment even in france built ships was russian , and it was also a problem , because who pays for the demontage of it ? 
  right now it was agreed that french side pays for everything .
