molotov-ribbentrop pact put the russians and the germans above all the other peoples . 
  it diminished the citizens of the countries between them to being nothing else but human shields and completely ignored their rights . 
  which was an ** absolutely standard modus operandi ** for a majority of `` relevant '' countries during that era . 
  stop looking at things from 21st century perspective and realize that this was a time of empires , war crimes , covert operations , illegal coups , struggles for independence and so on and so forth . 
  some citizens of some countries can argue that not much has changed for them in the next 70 years and things remain the same , with countries arbitrarily embargoing them or bombing into oblivion and throwing them into chaos of civil war , while `` noping the fuck out '' in regards to holding responsibility for their actions . 
  if tomorrow lets say putin and russian intelligence would get significant amount of proof , that they can confirm to a vast degree that lets say china is planning to invade and occupy russia 's far east , i would expect for russia to prepare for that course of action ( including quiting start treaties if necessary ) . 
  well , this is the point of having `` secret protocols '' for stuff like molotov-ribbentrop pact , what was the motivation behind this pact and what led to it is whole another matter . 
  you have secret protocols in which you are `` guaranteed a right '' ( or whatever the language of that document was ) to have baltics , poland and others to be in your `` sphere of influence '' , effectively moving your border several hundreds kilometers west and giving an opportunity to prepare to defend this area by the `` science/art of war '' . 
  if russians would not have moved in and refused to occupy `` smaller guys '' , germany would have done it no problem and the border would be ever so closer to soviet union . 
  things like fog of war exist , soviet leadership did not had the capabilities to read hitlers or japanese emperor mind at the time , the whole situation around soviet union was pretty menacing and world preferred to look the other way . 
  put yourself in stalin or molotov shoes , provide yourself with historical context ( specifically how old soviet leadership was , what they went through , what signals did they received from france , britain and u.s at the time , what was the circumstances of russian civil war and so on and so forth ) and ask yourself what you would have done without pretending to be that you are on some kind of `` high moral horse '' ? 
  what is the point of your question ? 
  are we discussing here * militarily capabilities of poland vs nazi germany * at the time or list ** war crimes ** during that era and this war in particular ? 
  or do you think that i somehow `` excuse '' soviet union actions in regards to katyn ? 
  where did i said that , please show me caz for the love of god , i could not find anything like that in my previous comment . 
  if you are interested in my views on molotov-ribbentrop you can check my comment history , i had a similar discussion about 11-12 days ago , i do n't post that often so it should be relatively easy to find . 
   and there is no guarantee germans would beat poland , and even if , it would still be better buffer zone than conquered territory . 
  so , nazi 's handed france , britain , soviet union , united states and other `` lesser states '' armies their asses in initial warfare , but poland would somehow magically `` reborn like a phoenix '' and beat the shit out of them ? 
  do you realize that if you loose means of production during modern warfare ( for that time in was tanks , planes , arms ; resources like oil , steel etc , ammunition and all the other logistics required to wage a war ) you are as good as dead ? 
  2nd question - what is harder to `` waltz through '' - territory of another state prepared for war with fortifications , trenches , militarily bases , strategically positioned artillery pieces and hundreds of thousands of troops or ** occupied territory ** with 95 % + of control by gestapo , ss , wehrmacht bases everywhere , no standing armies to defend , just partisans living in the forest mostly ( as it happened in numerous other countries ) ? 
  answer this honestly and you might get the idea why it `` makes sense '' ( as unfair it is to `` smaller guys '' ) to move the border so to speak . 
  what happened during 1920 ? 
  i thought poland `` broke away '' from russian empire and formed as a country again , only to invade and fight with all of its neighbors following pilsudski vision of `` felt the time was right to expand polish borders as far east as feasible , to be followed by a polish-led intermarium federation of east-central european states as a bulwark against the re-emergence of german and russian imperialisms '' . 
  ( thats from wiki article on soviet-polish war , you should read it up if you have n't ) how can you whitewash aggressive invasion of its neighbors with a desire to create your own little empire as something positive or worth praising ? 
  how was ukrainians and lithuanians treated in `` greater poland '' at the time and prior to that during commonwealth ? 
  what do they teach in polish schools ? 
  i wonder do poles actually believe that they would have `` turned the tide of the war '' against nazi germany and like in hollywood movies `` on the last breath , with all their might crushed puny nazi 's and claimed victory '' ? 
  was poland at the time stronger militarily than france and britain ? 
  land to station troops , bases , fortifications , build airports and all the other stuff , that countries prepare in case of war ( which is exactly what `` time '' means in this context ) . 
  poland would lost 99.9 % and the border would have been several hundred kilometers closer to soviet union . 
  need i remind you how close nazi 's ended up to moscow ? 
  horosho !, 
  ask putin what he tries to achieve in ukraine , not me man . 
  i would have to guess he has some kind of goal in mind or some sort of desirable outcome and if he ca n't achieve it via force , he should have prepared for some sort of negotiations , no ? 
  i mean its kind a logical to prepare at least 2 or 3 scenarios for possible developments of situation on the ground and how it will affect russian and russian population . 
  an honest mistake . 
  it may come offensive , but there is a decent possibility that russians do n't give a fuck about portugal and its culture and just do what it wants , without looking back at your culture or with an aim to intimidate you . 
  you are simply being considered as unimportant and your interests can be overlooked . 
  just a theory though . 
  barring oil going below 80 $ ( and even this is questionable , since we had historical precedents and global growth was constantly being slashed by international institutions ) , everything that happened to russia after crimea was * extremely predictable * . 
  writing was on the wall for anyone with 2 brain cells , it was obvious that sanctions would escalate gradually , economy went to shit ( and it was struggling ** before ** euromaidan ) , russian government actions in previous years practically destroyed small and medium side business with their own fucking hands ( and held zero responsibility for that and continue to work for this day ) , sochi was a 40 + bln $ `` potemkin village '' , vladivostok was a 20 bln $ summit , world cup 2018 would again be somewhere in the lines of 30 bln $ + and many , many , many other signals that economy was in bad shape . 
  this is kind a infuriating that nothing was done to prevent any of the damage , except move russian securities ( u.s bonds and stuff that was parts of russian reserves ) and oligarchs money from list of possible sanctioned countries . 
  to make things even worse , i see no coherent long-term strategical thinking of how to lessen our dependence on western technology and imports overall , the only thing i hear is `` we hope that sanctions will be lifted and oil go up '' . 
  what kind of strategy is that and how can russia negotiate from such position , apart from bending over and taking it up the ass ? 
  this is the type of journalism that i like , although i do n't know much about ukrainian organized crime , but the article itself seems quite informative and provided with lots of details . 
  possible crackdown on russia related organized crime in eastern europe/baltics in 3,2,1 ? 
  we are as proficient in renaming stuff just as much as in art of redrawing maps . 
  how about stasi , sounds nice , da ? 
  no , no , no , nooo kgb , 
  is berlin nice this time of year ? 
  we are polite tourists , come with our own transportation , have a decent self-defense skills and proficient in referendums and such . 
  please respond ( \u00b4 \uff65 \u03c9 \uff65 ` ), 
  lil bit , but you should not sweat about it , ~ ~ kill ~ ~ ignore everyone who tells you otherwise . 
   paul has worked at the central intelligence agency , the foreign broadcast information service , he served as special assistant for soviet nationalities and special advisor for soviet nationality and baltic affairs at the us department of state , he was the director of research and director of communications and technology at radio liberty/radio free europe , and the carnegie endowment for international peace . 
  does this raise some flags in your mind ? 
  what if the guy was ex-kgb/fsb , worked in russian ministry of foreign affairs etc etc ? 
  you can also write he lives on lubyanka nowadays also , so the picture would be even better . 
  i have troubles taking people like that seriously , especially when after reading the article the end game is always - `` poor little ukrainians did nothing wrong , they are just cleverly outsmarted and manipulated by evil putin all the time ( forcing them to do plenty of stupid stuff and engage in absurd amount of bullshit spewing via their media outlets ) -  we should immediately get them into nato and isolate russia forever and ever '' . 
  ** does this not smell funny to you ? 
  ** on a side note , if putin is as smart as mr. ex-cia is saying , why russia lost ukraine geopolitically in the first place ? 
  is n't putin `` genius '' implies that he is smarter than all those `` misled ukrainians '' and can manipulate them on a whim ? 
  i have so much trouble with articles like this and the work required to repel bullshit is at least x10 of what it takes to create it ( or formulate an `` authentic looking oped '' ) . 
  i dunno , for me it looks like european union making a mid-long term bet that eurasian union will not work out ( dissolve ) , russia will be weakened significantly and they could `` snatch it '' under russia 's nose . 
  judging by the way things are going in russian economy and our government `` steps '' ( in me personally they provoke a strong desire to see them on light poles moving sideways by the wind in `` english ties '' ) , its not that likely that this bet would fail . 
  regardless 140 million $ is peanuts and an opportunity to build better relations in the future etc , etc. 
  overall looks like a smart move with very little to loose . 
  russia was quite liberal , democratically oriented and wanted to reform . 
  i remember times when our parliament was not united russia with a majority of votes , there were plenty of liberal oriented forces , plenty of fights in duma , throwing water in face of political opponent ( hi zhirinovskii ) and a whole lot of other funky business . 
  unfortunately neoliberalizm and shock therapy completely discredited the idea of democracy and free market in russia , to the point when it became a swear word . 
  people who carried out those `` reforms and policies '' are universally hated amongst majority of population with a passion . 
  funnily enough putin has plenty of those people still around like chubais , kudrin used to be our finance minister and is considered influential even now , nabiullina ( central bank head ) is from that era as well , he also visited funeral of gaidar i think . 
  in a way he is walking on a very thin ice , since his economic policies are being conducted by western oriented liberals who has done * an enormous amount of damage * to russian economy , personally i would like to see them all hanged or at least given 10 years of prison each for absolute lack of any responsibility or accountability for their `` laws and ideas '' . 
  but domestically siloviki and `` patriotic minded '' people has gained an enormous amount of influence and they look at liberals with a badly hidden contempt/desire to get rid of them ( the worse russian economy is doing , the higher the chance that russian population will turn on liberals as an object of hatred , violence ) . 
  putin is no safe from population anger either , since he is effectively 15 years in power and its under his terms the situation has not changed one bit ( got worse arguably on plenty of other fronts ) , he can always channel the anger toward the liberals/ukrainians though to avoid `` the strike '' . 
  the longer the downturn of russian economy will continue , the bigger the demands of rosneft , rzd , gazprom & others for reserve fund money would be , the bloodier the bill will be in the end . 
  not really , there are fundamental problems with the way world operated in the past 30 years and what the mechanism of this `` unprecedented growth '' was . 
  it no longer works due to variety of reasons including transitioning economy ( talks about where exactly our society is headed and what skills would be necessary in the future is rather rare , but its a fundamental issue to formulate a policy/goal and go towards it ) . 
  general problem is there is too much populism , lack for desire to reform/change status-quo and engagement of population into the dialogue about their future . 
  too many elites , billionaires and their buddies talk about `` how to fix the economy '' without the desire to sustain significant pain or restriction of their power , thus its doomed to fail when those policies would not find support from general population . 
  if people do n't trust their government , elected officials , corporations , media and elites , they wo n't respond to challenges of time either , preferring `` my house is on a sidelines , i want nothing to do with it , i just live here and would like to be left alone '' . 
  less trust = less engagement , less engagement = elites rot and `` boil in their own juice '' , social ladders do n't work , people angry , bad stuff happens . 
  psst , wan na make a pact with a couple of secret protocols ? 
  deal is good , promise !, 
  but ... it was meant as a light joke and not a serious post ... sigh, 
  look at eastern europe gas prices and baltic states , you might see a pattern here  you want to move away from russia 's influence , prepare to open your wallet both as a country and as population in general . 
  if your government will follow up on their promises of reforms , they will cancel their energy subsidies for population as well and price will rise again . 
  its one of the parts of russian economic pressure towards ukraine , get used to it , plenty more of that will come in the future . 
  on behalf of russia i would like to apologize that we are not giving out free gas to everyone , i know its disappointing to ask money for provided services , but we are such an unreasonable bunch !, 
  shhh , its a secret holiday destination . 
  to be announced ... 
  wow . 
  really ? 
  and poor ukrainians are victims of putin evil mind games forcing them to make mistakes and do all sorts of dumb shit ? 
  ( ukrainians themselves has nothing to do with it , right ? 
  all evil plan of russia ! ), 
  i wish putin was half as smart as western media paint him to be in their james bond villain portray , maybe then russia would not loose ukraine as a whole geopolitically and was not under sanctions and hated by a shit ton of countries worldwide . 
   how do you figure ? 
  if you go back to threads about the us bases in europe most people were talking about how the us is europe 's biggest enemy and russia is a partner . 
  i dunno , its just a general feeling i had from the sub ( and other places like worldnews and whatnot ) . 
  hard to pinpoint exactly , but the amount of negativity was always pretty high in regards to pretty much any issue , but then again i am not `` an old guard '' of this sub , so i might be wrong .
