  are we back to 19 century , yet ? 
  when is the next crimean war ? 
   i 'm not sure what you are saying here . 
  in a game of civ when you go to war with another country with which you have a trading agreement , you immediately loose the resources you were trading with thus penalty is * immediately * effective . 
  sanctions do not operate like that , they have more of a mid and long term effects which would cripple future growth and create a number of problems later down the line . 
  if you were to get on the `` hype train '' of sanctions and fail to recognize when to jump off the loco , you might create a bigger mess than you initially intended to be . 
  thats all i am saying . 
   breal which treaty ? 
  i 'm a little confused by your arguement here , but both the eu and russia are already engaged in a spiralling game of tit-for-tat sanctions i agree , we are already on the path of `` who is going to inflict the most amount of damage for the other side '' , but ** the desirable ** outcome for europe might slightly deviate from the path that russia will choose . 
  basically i think we * both * might loose more than we initially wanted , with some very ugly developments further down the line . 
   i do n't think anyone is unsure about the nature of the sanctions/invasion of ukraine escalating . 
  in fact merkel 's hesitancy in particular to commit to stronger sanctions , as well as russians own limited sanctions , speaks volumes on this . 
  although it is true that the amount of sanctions russia could conceivably bring to bear against the eu/us without damaging it 's own economy severely is , at best , moderate . 
  i see this a bit differently , in my opinion merkel has caved in into hawks and is on a path of non-stop sanctions every other month , regardless of ukrainians developments ( non-stop pressure until unconditional surrender so to speak ) . 
  it is unlikely that russia will tolerate such treatment , so `` voice of reason '' would be drown in `` hawkishness '' from both sides -  thus making things even worse . 
   well for several reasons , mostly because the heads of state of the eu have repeatedly said that this is exactly what it will take to stop the sanctions against russia ; full withdrawal of forces from ukraine 's sovereign territory , full withdrawal of backing of pro-russian rebels in the donbas , and in all likelihood reparations for the damage inflicted on ukraine by russia . 
  so , russia must admit that it basically has lost what it considers as its own backyard or `` sphere of influence '' , pay the reparations + quietly roll over and die to its western overlords ? 
  are you a big fan of treaty of versailles by chance ? 
  you do realize that this is an equivalent of political suicide for putin & co , right ? 
  on a side note , how would you describe the role of turkey in syrian crisis ( and other gulf states ) ? 
  not that i am engaged in whataboutism , but i do wonder why is that european officials has repeatedly traveled to maidan to participate in protests against * elected democratically government * and did ** nothing ** for turkish protests ? 
  somethings got ta give , right ? 
   no-one is under any illusions that this will be the case . 
  russia has opened pandora 's box and the reprecussions for the invasion of ukraine will be felt for years diplomatically . 
  what it can control now is how long the effects will be felt economically . 
  what some pro-russian posters fail to understand , and i say this with no arrogance but as diplomatically as possible , is that these sanctions are not going away . 
  i am by no means a pro-russian poster , what i am trying to advocate is a bit of restrain in eagerness to `` punish evil russia '' . 
  usually , tunnel visioning something is bad and while i do think that europe will not lift sanctions out of nowhere , until conflict is over , the idea that russia itself will stop unless it will be grated a * somewhat * desirable/acceptable outcome is naive . 
  thus the spiral continues . 
   tl ; dr no-one believes this is going to end soon , but the only way it does end is with russia acceding to demands to remove itself from ukraine . 
  tl ; dr to yours - ukraine is in western sphere of influence now , russia can go fuck itself and can not protect its national interests/backyard because it is too weak . 
  i am sure this will go exactly as planned and we will all live happily ever after , 
  greenpeace was also an international case with foreigners involved , it was resolved as predictable as it could . 
  if this particular case is as black and white as its portrayed by estonians , then i expect for the dude to go back to estonia `` shortly '' ( max 6 months of `` investigation '' followed by case falling apart ) . 
  for diplomacy to work interested parties should be presented with * acceptable * scenarios , the question is - what is acceptable for ukraine , eu and russia ? 
  so far kiev did everything it could to alienate russia and gave zero incentive for negotiations or any deescalation hopes . 
  russia perceives current ukrainian officials and their course as non-negotiable and will do everything it can to destroy ukraine economically ( and if ukraine would have a serious case of nato membership on the table perhaps militarily ) . 
  this is a personal opinion obviously and i do not represent russian government in any way , shape or form , but when i listen to what ukrainian officials say , i start to wonder how the hell are they in their positions , where are their education/diplomacy skills/logic/common sense ? 
  why do they act like african tribesmen with little regard to centuries of world history and politics ? 
  how can they believe any of the bullshit they are spewing on a daily basis and carry on like nothing happened ? 
  by russian law maximum prison sentence for their `` offense '' was 7 years ( media loved the story and everyone screamed how they would be locked up for life ) , they got the minimum * 2 * followed by a parole . 
  in essence about ~ 1,5 years or so , mostly because they were extremely hostile in their attitude and showed `` very little remorse of their actions '' . 
  this was a clear `` show process '' from the get go and to make things clear i believe i even commented on the issue on reddit back then disagreeing with harsh sentence ( a sentiment which was shared among many russians , but no one listens to them anyway ) . 
  although later down the line when i saw a bit of their `` art performances '' i changed my stance a little , half a year/1 year would be still enough though , but no russian law exists like that i think , so we got what we got . 
  on the issue of a citizen of sovereign country i agree , but it could be anything from fuck-ups at local level , to similarity with `` razvozhaev '' case in kiev to `` extrajudicial renditions '' and so on ( this is spy games * to an extent * , we do n't know enough details except cross-border fact ) . 
  i have no idea what is going on in our intelligence services heads though , regardless of my nickname  i think the situation will be dealt with in private as in most of those cases usually . 
  and immediately loose face ? 
  ( incompetent leader unable to control its intelligence services ) greenpeace case was also a lot of posturing and chest bumping , but what happened was exactly as i predicted - released after some `` time for thought '' . 
  same story with pussy riot `` zomg 7 years in jail , what a horrendous injustice ! '' . 
  this is russia we are talking about , loosing face here or not looking tough enough is almost a crime , 
  i am not sure , but i think something similar happened with '' \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0434 \u0420\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0437\u0436\u0430\u0435\u0432 '' in ukraine back in 2012 i think . 
  no court , no hearings , just kidnapped and transferred to russia . 
  in eyes of intelligence services no one really cared back then , so they might have gotten some ideas from it , who knows maybe they perceive eesti the same way as ukraine and have little respect for its sovereignty , which is a case of concern ofc  its spy games anyway , there is a lot of gray shit out there . 
  what if countries economies do not operate like the game of civ ? 
  what if you break the treaty and sanction someone it would have more of a middle and long term consequences and instigate a spiral of `` responses '' followed by the other side `` reacting '' to not look weak and `` stand by its european allies '' ? 
  what if people often * overreact * to any bad news and create even more problems/complications , than they initially envisioned ? 
  there are others ` what ifs ` like how population perceives sanctions , who controls `` the perceiving mechanism '' and so on . 
  why is everything so simplistic and people think that if russia would immediately stop the support for `` rebels '' everything happen prior to that would magically go away in a span of 1 month with zero consequences for respective parties involved ? 
  what if this was an operation by russian counter-intelligence who `` overstepped their boundaries '' ( or did not care about a `` small '' violation from their perspective ) and not directly orchestrated by putin sitting in a war room behind the monitor with intense look on his face ? 
  what are the possibilities of intelligence services operating outside the knowledge of `` putin 's sauron eye '' ? 
  not that i would defend the guy , but the simplicity of russia = putin is a bit silly in my opinion . 
  if russia is rejected , laughed upon , ignored , threatened or disregarded by west , russia has no choice but to look for other centers of power . 
  its a union of necessity , just like good old 19 century alliances to `` oppose '' other threats  its not like russia is not aware of china 's favorite hobby of redrawing ancient maps , but this problem will arise further down the line 15 + years from now , the `` present '' dictates the necessity of such relations for both parties : /, 
  we also watch game of thrones and other tv series ( perhaps through not so legal means , but anyway ) . 
  how dare we ? 
  lack of professionalism , general hatred and * dehumanization * for `` the other side '' , attempts to instigate fear/terror , lack of training , perhaps personal reasons to dislike south-easterners to name a few . 
  when pro-maidan forces `` has won '' they thought that they could do as they please , it turns out not everyone felt the same way and now they have a `` situation '' on their hands . 
  well , lets see - confiscating accumulative part of our pension funds for 2nd year in a row is a done deal , we are being cut off from international finance markets bit by bit , denied or soon to be denied access to technological know-how in energy sphere ( cripples future growth ) , every single state owned company wants to raid our reserve funds in one way or another and every single one of them is talking about billions or dozens on billions of $ $ $ . 
  prices continue to rise on everything , credit lines for population also go up on stuff like mortgages and so on . 
  government is actively engaged in talks about raising taxes or introducing new ones , constantly want to change the budget ( every 3 months or so ) , a shit ton of `` investment projects '' from `` innovative rosnano '' is borderline bankrupt or have no demand at all . 
  a majority of local oblast ' / state run deficits and cut spending . 
  do i need to continue ? 
  you should ask yourself a number of questions - will ukrainian situation settle down in near future ? 
  ( a real stop , not truces to regroup armies , rearm , heal wounded and go back guns blazing ) will ukrainians accept loss of south-east ? 
  ( crimea is obv long gone ) how does current crisis affect russian international image for investors ? 
  ( see assets confiscation of ukrainian oligarchs , ban on food imports and other `` adventures '' ) even if `` peace is established '' how soon will sanctions go away both ways ? 
  meaning no one would immediately cancel them , there would be a time lag of 3 + month anyway , otherwise all of them were meaningless + putin trade deals with latin america would go to shit as well . 
  there is a certain lag between sanctions being implemented , sanctions beginning to work their magic and sanctions being lifted bit by bit . 
  regardless of the outcome humans operate on emotional basis , so when they feel their investment/trade is under threat they will * almost always * overreact in one way or another . 
  think about how people react to various possible shortages/crisis in supermarkets or whatnot , people raid the place buying everything and then proceed to be on stand-by so to speak . 
  thus even if sanctions were to be lifted , a lot of players would be extremely cautious . 
  russian economic outlook looked bleak even in 2013 with constant downgrading of gdp forecast almost on a monthly basis by our `` respective officials '' . 
  if you want numbers ( although i am not investor/economist or smtn , so take it for whats it worth ) i would say that russia this year * in best possible scenario * would have 0,3-0 ,5 % of gdp increase . 
  worst - is contraction of ~ 2-3 % . 
  if situation will not change ( and i highly doubt that russian government is capable of introducing any meaningful reforms or strategical directions ) , next year would be worse for russia than current one . 
  well it is an old news so to speak , i am too lazy to dig up livejournal articles , articles in russian media / popular internet sites etc. 
  if you do n't want to believe me , whatever , no big deal  its just funny to read from perspective of someone who has lived in russian informational field/space . 
  you can count russia out if you were hoping for improvements finland . 
  we are in a pretty bad shape , it * will * get worse , so i guess search for something new ? 
  be it either markets , technologies , partnerships , arms or whatever . 
  i could have sworn i saw gas initially in your post , but maybe i am going crazy : / nonetheless , estonia does not hold the same weight that germany , france and others do , realpolitik so to speak . 
  russia might cut gas in an absolute extreme , desperate move , not sooner . 
  too much potential damage . 
  if only you guys knew how mistral deal was critisized in runet a while ago during serdyukov era  its funny to see how the `` other side '' is flaming it right now , 
  https://www.google.ru/search?hl=ru&amp;source=hp&amp;q=russia+cuts+off+gas+to+estonia&amp;gbv=2&amp;oq=russia+cuts+off+gas+to+estonia&amp;gs_l=heirloom-hp.3...787.6070.0.6194.34.24.2.7.2.2.250.2828.0j18j3.21.0....0...1ac.1.34.heirloom-hp..12.22.2389.3nrcsyfi7la putin will calm down , when he gets acceptable for * him * solution to the conflict or when russian society go nuts . 
  so far , russian public opinion is pretty apathetic and inert . 
  what about ukrainian society ? 
  how are they doing in terms of economics and a general psyche ? 
  are u seriously going to bring up something that happened in 1993 during yeltsin era with all the chaos , `` shock therapy '' en route and all the other shit that was going on at that time ? 
  at that time estonia even was n't even a member of eu/nato if i remember correctly , was it not ?
