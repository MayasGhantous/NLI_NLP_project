  there is a difference in threatening and acting upon a threat , especially during times of crisis ( more bullshit from both sides ) . 
  poland pays what it pays because they had no alternative ( and because of their political stances , their previous role in gas transit alongside ukraine and others ) , which is why they are building lng terminal . 
  but it took them quite some time to do so , so if europe wants to diversify they should also start building , but it still would require * a considerable amount of money and time * . 
  even if you build a shit ton of lngs , either the price will go up or gasprom will lower the price to make it less economically viable , thus undermining the investment/fracking revolution to some extent . 
  sanctions are already in place , they already had an impact and will continue to worsen situation , more are en route , where is the `` line in the sand '' so to speak ? 
  i consider cutting off gas as an ** extreme ** option at which point we are basically at war to some extent ( thus our relations for near-time future is fucked ) . 
  what next ? 
  russians roll over and quietly die ? 
  perhaps i misunderstood you overall , mainly because there are quite a number of people here who advocate for eu to cut off gas transit from russia , in that case i apologize . 
  i am not a putin supporter btw , but i do wonder what good even more escalation will bring and at which point both sides would calm the fuck down . 
  from article `` russia will nevertheless threaten to stop supplying ukraine and the eu over the winter '' . 
  when exactly did russia or putin said anything like that ? 
  or is it mr. former ambassador talking out of his ass ? 
  or are you taking political bickering for its face value during times of crisis ? 
  i can see russia bullying ukraine , but why the fuck would we threaten our * european * customers ? 
  while it is true that european market is significantly more important for russia , there is a simple truth behind all of that - europe uses russian gas because the price is * economically viable * and ** there is no infrastructure in place to replace russian gas within a 1 year period ** . 
  after 1 year what next ? 
  will dozens of lng terminals magically pop-up everywhere ? 
  will price in domestic market of u.s & co remain the same when they began to export ? 
  can they meet demand in 1 , 1,5 year period ? 
  what is going to become with european economy in the meantime ? 
  basically , ** who has better foundations and benefited the most throughout the whole ukrainian ordeal ? 
  ** if you escalate even further ( for ex . 
  i 've read about military drills in western ukraine with 1k troops ) what stops rebels from `` acquiring '' jets from their respective local pawn shops/captured from army ? 
  what stops russia from escalating even further or taking an even more aggressive stance ? 
  even if you succeed , do you think russian will forget any of that ? 
  what our relations would look like 5-10 years on from now ? 
  well i am not naive enough to think that morality in politics exists , but then this sub becomes basically a joke and a field of information war with a very clear bias and agenda . 
  with russian interest not presented at all + all the talks about partnership in german/russian relations and all that jazz . 
  so much for discussion and dialogue , huh ? 
  well , what you are basically suggesting is a proxy war between eu and russia with ukrainians + volunteers serving as cannon fodder to gain ukraine as sphere of influence for either russia or eu . 
  are n't you the `` good guys '' ? 
  absolutely . 
  lets make everything produced in eu even less competitive on global stage , giving their `` trade partners '' more trump cards and growth , while eu goes back to recession . 
  great strategical thinking right there , i am sure beijing and washington would engage in standing ovations . 
  this `` progressive thinking '' is right there with ukrainians wanting to stop transit of russian oil/gas and other great ideas . 
  war cost money . 
  ukraine is in ** very ** bad shape economically , * if * they could get another loan from imf & co , how are they going to pay back any of that eventually ? 
  i dunno what is currently being negotiated in minsk , but ato is an expensive campaign . 
  will europe be fine with giving money for war for non-european union member ? 
  exchanging prisoners is a common practice there , sometimes they give some kind of guarantees or promises to not fight anymore and go home and stuff like that . 
  eastern europe has been throwing shit , tantrums , insults , blackmailed or threatened to blackmail russia with transit of gas and oil and expressed a heavily anti-russian opinion/behavior ** long before ** any ukrainian conflict . 
  i will agree on the part that russia has `` played the game '' and wanted to avoid dealing with relying on countries like poland and ukraine for transit of materials , but this is just geopolitics and desire to get more $ for products that you supply . 
  do n't pretend like you are some kind of saints who loved russia dearly after soviet union collapsed and russophobia is some kind of recent development , its not . 
  hello redditor for 8 hours without a flair agreeing with another redditor with 1 day old account , thank you for your valuable contribution . 
  the only reasonable explanation for your post that i can find of , is that you have lost someone close to you on mh17 , perhaps a family member or a dear friend . 
  otherwise ? 
  well , my intention was to make a bit of fun of the guy , mostly because of his overreaction to a joke comment by someone else ( plus when i read threads , you have stuff like short term memory and somehow he associated for me with `` dude who should take a chill pill '' ) . 
  perhaps too much polandball , oh well . 
  i kind a understand it with russiphication attempts , `` overstaying our welcome after ww2 '' and other things , i do wonder though why eastern europe has universally engaged in shit-throwing festival toward russia right after soviet union dissolved and continue to do so , to this day . 
  i do hope that russia one day improve enough to be accepted in european family , but we are miles away and it seems like we are rowing in the opposite direction , 
  this topic requires study of russian psyche and attitude problems ( russia does no wrong etc ) . 
  its hard for me to give an explanation what * might * is happening in a number of russian citizen heads , why they think that way and how did it come to this . 
  i am not qualified and it would possibly require a book or two . 
   this seems like an extremely weird thing from a former communist state . 
  surely it should be the opposite ? 
  this is how russian government deals with problems , golden trio if i may : 1 ) raise prices/taxes . 
  2 ) deny , forbid , restrict . 
  3 ) shift the responsibility to population , avoid any accountability at all costs . 
  presented in every single piece of legislation , law or reform at least since 1998 , maybe it goes even further in history . 
  people vastly overestimate desire of russians for communist state , nanny-state , complete and total regulation of every aspect of our lives . 
  we just want a decent enough live with clear and simple rules , which do not change every 6 months . 
  its probably hard for you to grasp , but for example russian pension system was reformed quite a number of times already , they plan to change it again and already froze `` accumulative part of pension fund '' for 2nd year in a row and expressed desire to abolish it . 
  basically russia 's laws change every other day , tax codes are constantly changing as well , everything is resembling `` a madmen in asylum during a seizure '' , nothing even close resembling strategical thinking . 
  it is sad to see how russian budget is being `` forecast '' for 3 years in advance by our ministries only to change outlooks every 3 months or so ( naturally downward trend ) . 
   do you want to leave russia ? 
  and if so do you/will you ever have the means to ? 
  i never seriously considered it , but i heavily dislike current trends : 1 ) blissful ignorance ( i do n't know how much of that is genuine , for example on our local news site i started to think that a lot of people either are crazy or being paid to write idiotic comments which can be described as `` hoorah , patriotism ! '' ) . 
  hoorah patriotism is when we get sanctioned , ban food imports , involve ourselves in ukraine and generally express a negative viewpoint of the west * and everyone approves of it * , sort a like `` yeah , we 'll show them bastards !, 
  glory to russia ! '' . 
  i fail to understand how people are unable to see long term consequences of russia 's actions around the world . 
  for example with crimea we ruined relations with ukraine for a long time , scared finland , gave an excuse for china for future `` protection of oppressed minorities '' possibly on russian turf as well , created points of tension in relations with central asian republics + belarus and kazakhstan ( eurasian union used to be somewhat voluntarily organization , now we are `` messing '' with other nation borders , which makes you wonder ) . 
  china gas deal also look quite weak in terms of prices and we gave them plenty of trump cards to negotiate . 
  european partners also probably has reviewed their approach with russia to a certain extent , but i obviously do n't know much about that  of course we also look like hypocrites on international stage , look incompetent with mh17 flight , captured russian soldiers with documents and all that stuff . 
  this does not look as a carefully constructed master plan to improve russia 's positions on world stage or in our own backyard , makes you also wonder what the fuck our intelligence services are doing . 
  2 ) censorship and desire to avoid any public discussion of our problems ( witch hunts , `` you are not patriot !, 
  '' , `` you are state department agent or paid by cia !, 
  '' ) , `` everything is good in danish kingdom '' , `` we are a quiet harbor '' . 
  goes hand to hand with lack of accountability , people who failed national projects time and time again and shown nothing except `` hey we are a natural monopoly , lets raise prices ! '', 
  are still working in important positions , high profile cases are swept under the rug ( because ties , corruption , buddies in crime etc ) . 
  3 ) general trend of blaming everything on others or lack of accountability . 
  i dislike when i read that sochi cost 50 billion dollars and * everyone is fine with it * no one is in jail , all is well . 
  well guess what , russian citizen , world cup 2018 would also cost a shit ton of money . 
  russian summit in vladivostok cost us 20 billion $ , the new road which was constructed specifically for the event got `` washed away '' at least 3 times already . 
  there are others of course like `` lets raise taxes '' , a whole bunch of them . 
  but back to topic of emigration , i do n't think i represent a typical russian , i was heavily exposed to western world from at least 6 years when i got my zx-spectrum , now i am 27 , i have stopped watching russian tv about a decade ago because it was piece of shit , i tend to have a skeptical view and has grown into a cynic . 
  in terms of can i earn enough money to travel abroad and live there ? 
  yes . 
  am i restricted in movements ? 
  no , we are not north korea yet , neither iron curtain has befall on russia , i doubt it will in the next year or two . 
  i also have some responsibilities and tend to plan ahead , meaning if i were to decide to leave russia , i would not live on streets in the next couple of months and would have enough information or funds to last at least half a year without serious cutbacks in standard of living , this requires time to accumulate funds , investigate possible destinations and other details . 
  plan ahead basically  oligarchs and stolen russian money stored abroad is a slippery slope and while from the point of law britain is following its hundreds year of judicial traditions , russia seriously lack in that regard , thus russians tend to favor social justice more . 
  `` if its fair it does not have to be lawful necessarily '' type of approach . 
  ( russians also respect ordnung as in `` order '' quite a lot , which is why some people like stalin a lot , since in their minds he was `` strong and fair leader with functioning state apparatus '' ) difference in culture , history and traditions i guess . 
  true to a certain extent , this is probably how brits felt after ww2 , during the times of british empire dissolve . 
  russia gives a bit different vibe though in my opinion , more of a weimar republic with authoritarian tendencies . 
  i ca n't bring myself to your `` level '' and even if tried , you would still beat me with experience  you have won , congratz . 
  have a nice evening . 
   so you are saying that what russia/putin is doing now is in retaliation for what nato and the west did after the ussr fell ? 
  its just one of many other factors , its not the `` one and only , root of all evil '' type of thing .
