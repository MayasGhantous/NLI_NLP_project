  this is my personal opinion , but i think russian mental health was heavily damaged during perestroika/shock therapy and quite a number of our compatriots have a `` mess in their heads '' . 
  we lack national identity , we lack directions in which we want to go , we lack motivation to do anything meaningful or strive for any efficiency whatsoever , after all - we live from oil and gas revenue mostly . 
  the only good things oligarchs good at is stealing other peoples money or businesses , meaning if someone creates a successful enterprise in russia with decent profit , immediately pop-up local `` friends or protectors '' or if it was even more lucrative - oligarch who raid or `` acquire majority of control '' via not so legal practises . 
  naturally , russian government officials are as efficient as u.s congress , probably worse . 
  to be completely honest i can not name you a single reform in russia which could honestly be labeled as `` successful '' . 
  maybe i am ill-informed , but this is a general feeling in population - `` leave us the fuck alone with your `` care '' and `` initiatives '' '' . 
  in terms of economy , everything was going downhill before any euromaidan activities , russian economical model of living from oil/gas has reached its peak and our budget runs deficits with oil even at 100 $ barrel , now it will be used as a convenient excuse and scapegoat for our own failures and missteps . 
  i do n't know how many russians on reddit there is , but this is pretty much the same as russians in r/dota2 , vocal idiots are easily noticed , people who are not interested in flame war just behave and try to blend in . 
  i personally stopped visiting this sub for about 3 months and `` checked it out '' right about mh17 got shot down , i rarely comment anyways , mostly because people see russian flair or opinion which differs from theirs and automatically label you as a moron , astroturfer , `` insert random isult here '' . 
  it is also worth mentioning that level headed russians tend to express desire to leave russia , there are enough polls out there with data , russia is far from lawful place with `` fair rules , fair game '' . 
  they might not act on this desire , but they express it nonetheless , worth mentioning i think . 
  as for putin steps , who knows ? 
  it all depends . 
  for example i can see russia leaving start treaties some time in the future if situation escalates , after all nukes are cheap and cost-effective deterrent . 
  yukos 50 billion $ fine was curious as well , i have a hard time believing that russia will pay anything at all . 
  i do n't know the legalities and in which european/western treaties russia is engaged , but i can see us leaving them or acting extremely aggressive to any attempts to seize governmental property . 
  maybe shareholders of menatep group would have `` a clear case of suicide '' some time in the future . 
  we are somewhat of a mafia state and if anything mafia is known for , it is the fact that no one likes when someone messes with their money . 
  in terms of relations with european union , current sanctions are damaging enough for russian economy and will continue to damage it even more , mostly due to lack of access for `` cheap credit lines '' . 
  i expect russian gdp to contract this year , inflation on food to skyrocket , taxes to rise , jobs to be lost , full scale economical crisis to be short . 
  it was long due , structural reforms do not exist due to reasons mentioned above , so we are in for a tough ride . 
  are we going to ban machinery from germany ? 
  somehow i doubt it , after all , almost everything in terms of electronics is being produced in the west , nations without machines or means to repair them in 21st century are destined to fail . 
  if we resort to china again , we will get crap ** and expensive one ** , beggars cant be choosers  it was also somewhat funny to read that russia imports 80-90 % of seeds for potato from netherlands or something , talk about : `` lets help our agricultural sector '' and other things like sperm from animals to produce meat etc. 
  basically russian government is ** incompetent ** and they have no * grand designs * , just stupid and short-sighted reactionary measures to boost domestic morale . 
  i would still call crimea annexation although a questionable move , but pretty well executed and i honestly think that if we did not pushed in eastern ukraine , west would have swallowed the pill . 
  putin pushed too far . 
  in terms of propaganda , i would say for a non-internet user pretty hard , everything is state controlled , state owned or heavily influenced . 
  it used to be a bit better , but serious pressure was exerted during ukrainian uprising . 
  overwhelming majority of information is controlled is some way , filtered or blatantly misrepresented ( lies ) . 
  even with internet roskomnadzor has done plenty of blocking anything with opposing views to `` general party line '' , ofc you can still work around it , but its annoying . 
  if you need a general sense of direction , probably chinese great firewall . 
  i do n't like gorbachev . 
  i can understand a western feeling that he was great for you guys , united germany , peace of our time and his actions led to what might be considered as a golden age of western civilization ( up to date ) , but for russians it was not all rainbows and unicorns . 
  but as a politician he was quite weak , he went with both radical political and economical reforms and kind a failed in russians eyes . 
  i would say that he is right there with drunktard yeltsin , a lot of people lost everything or almost everything , this is not something that is easily forgettable . 
  shock therapy was a disaster , 90s were a mess and term `` shitocrasy '' emerged ( \u0434\u0435\u0440\u044c\u043c\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u044f ) . 
  a lot of disappointment , depression , despair and no one seemed to care how russia was looted to the ground by crooks who stored their money abroad  btw i still fail to see any of london ( or other place ) `` new residents '' punished or expelled , this is a ringing bell for me personally that no one ever gave a fuck about russian citizens at all . 
  ofc this is like an arms exports , if not you , then someone else will do it , such is the game  i am also more and more disappointed with putin approach and government actions , i fail to see any coherent policy at all + nothing but desire to `` hide the head in the sand '' . 
  sorry for long list of answers , complicated matters are hard to present in couple sentences and they would give quite an inaccurate viewpoint otherwise . 
  ( not that i think my views are accurate or represent majority of russians , just a random opinion on the internet ) . 
  i am never playing a victim since i lack agenda or motivation to defend current russia in any way , shape or form . 
  all i am giving is a perspective which quite a number of russian might share , know your enemy and all that stuff , its useful , trust me  maybe someday romanians will learn concepts of international relations , different opinions , various worldviews , art of diplomacy/realpolitik and a bit of logic with a simple chain of cause -  consequence . 
  its a process , i know , 
  big countries loose influence when they are weak or unable to exercise in power play . 
  this has happened numerous times in russian history , when russia lost control over ukraine in one way or another , most recent example would be 2004 orange revolution and changes in policies that ukrainian government went with during yushenko years . 
  `` there is nothing new under the moon '' ( c ) nato might have won and will continue to winning , but it sure as hell no thanks to romania or any other `` great nation '' who 's favorite past time includes constant shit-throwing at russia . 
  all you guys do is talk big and hide behind stronger and more advanced nations like germany , france , netherlands , uk and others . 
  after all , its part of your national identity to hate everything that has to do with russia or its history , nothing will change in the next 10 to 20 years . 
  i will go and cry again in a corner , this is how bad i feel !!, 
  sigh , its really sad when people seeing `` enemy flair '' immediately attack a person without even bothering checking their comment history . 
  russian flair = worst scum on earth , ura-patriot , die in a ditch colorado bug . 
  london is full of rich russkies who stole money from russia , never hear anything about it when corruption is being brought upon , weird huh ? 
  un might calculate seasonal adjustments , weather and other stuff in its calculations , who knows , anyway , congrats romania !, 
  * clap clap clap *  how does it feel when literally every single country that has escaped your sphere of influence since the 90s is better off than it was under soviet rule , and better off than mommy russia itself ? 
  you tell that to ukraine and all the stans . 
  you argument would be more accurate if you avoided stuff like : `` literally every single country '' , but then again , it would require balanced approach , avoidance of labeling people and generally more mature way of communication . 
  its a shame that russia went the path it went and countries , politicians , leaders and institutions never seemed to care in 90s , neither in early 2000s when russian interests/positions were repeatedly violated/disregarded . 
  might makes right though , history is written by victors and all that jazz . 
  now we are reaping the fruits of what was sowed for the last couple decades at least , current russian mentality/attitude is just a backlash + attempts to preserve power by corrupt politicians and their buddies oligarchs . 
  brainwashing and propaganda works , especially if the other side is `` helping you out on a regular basis '' by providing constant points to talk about/confirm your words . 
  i also cry daily about `` russia which we lost '' / s ( russian catch phrase here ) . 
  i formed my views on world and russia long time ago , i am sorry your attempt to `` guess my thoughts '' failed so miserably , perhaps another time , 
  we are on our way already , no worries ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  you sound angry , drink some tea to calm nerves , train for emigration to britain , 
  | and thought , okay merkel , you are naive . 
  its good intentions but ... naive . 
  maybe she is or maybe she is not thinking in terms of 1-2 year lifespan and think how actions of europe as whole could seriously damage future relations with russia further down the line . 
  russians never forget , look at u.s / russia relations and how they decayed over the last decade . 
  i do n't think we will see any `` improvement '' on that front at least until early-mid 20s , there would be no more new deals in terms of nuclear weapons , russia will remain extremely hostile to u.s interest around the world and would try to seriously undermine them at any chance , * trade * will not improve either . 
  is it a win-win in your opinion ? 
  sanctions already done plenty and will continue to damage russian economy even more , right now russians do n't think much about them except rising prices on everything ( which is a story of russia citizen life for more than 20 years ) . 
  would you like even more sanctions , so that russia would do something even more stupid than ban imports of agriculture in august ? 
  russian economy were not doing that well as of early 2013 at least , now the process accelerates even faster , growth is zero ( or negative ) , things are looking worse and worse by the day . 
  at some point people might actually start to believe that `` evil western pigdogs did it to us !!! '', 
  given the right amount of brainwashing and propaganda . 
  not a good thing to have . 
  giving a cornered animal an out is a legitimate strategy , look at u.s & syria chemical weapons thingy . 
  in the article - politics , careful and vague attempts to defuse situation , private negotiations , a number of speculations/opinions , a small jab at russia for its `` engagement '' in south-eastern ukraine ( which was headlined in the article almost as in clickbait ) . 
  itt - emotional response for speculations and hearsays , germany is literally molotov-ribbentrop sellouts , germany is worst leader eu , how dare they think of anything except complete russian humiliation ( which russian government does a pretty good job in itself ) , lets break our ties with russia once and for all !, 
  i wonder why is that people desire instant gratification so much and if not presented , they are outraged that life is a bit more complex than that . 
  so far i have not seen any country leaving european union , neither did any of them dropped euro , nor anyone took the `` leadership role '' and proposed genius solution to european problems . 
  where are new economical models ? 
  where are new ways of thinking ? 
  where are breakthroughs in terms of political and social studies ? 
  anyone , anything ??? 
  a lot of europe is unemployed and educated , surely they know `` the truth '' how to fix everything and can deliver a new golden age for european union . 
  i thought there were plenty of grants and subsidies , institutions and universities , so that young and talented could shine !, 
  where are they ? 
  are they being silenced by stazi ? 
  what people are doing in europe besides throwing shit at their respective governing bodies and blaming everything on someone ? 
  grow the fuck up . 
  complaining again , typical pole  anyway i think you are not unique in that regard - in fact i think that almost entire world is in similar situation , everyone pretends that they are doing better and growing/recovering , while in fact no one has any idea how to solve any of the problems we are currently facing . 
  people just roll with it with no general plan or directions except a bunch of meaningless concepts/name tags such as : `` inequality '' , `` austerity '' , `` qe '' and others . 
  so far its been * at least * 6 years of lets preserve the status-quo , avoid any serious movements/reforms and hope its goes away . 
  reminds me of russian '' \u0410\u0432\u043e\u0441\u044c '' attitude , 
  pssst , hey poland , wan na try some migrants ? 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) i heard you guys are doing relatively well economically and have like 97 % monoethnicity or smtn , surely a bit immigrants here and there wo n't harm , right ? 
   you can feed them with apples n stuff .
