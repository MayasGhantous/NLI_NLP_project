  its all meh in the end . 
  i am kind a interested in 2 events though : 1st is maidan shooting , its been already what , half a year ? 
  give me evidence , names , video recordings , court hearing , experts analysis , arrests and so on . 
  if someone kills 100 people it should be fairly easy to give at least some kind of explanation apart from `` hurr , durr , they did it ! '' . 
  2nd would be malaysian flight , what i am mainly interested are dispatcher comms between ground control and an airplane . 
  black boxes were already deciphered and sbu confiscated audio hearings i think ? 
  gib evidence , this should not be that hard for dutch/brits and damning evidence surely would help ukrainian side ? 
  so many lies everywhere , no accountability whatsoever and a general feeling that states are just making shit up on the fly , i wonder where that road will lead us : /, 
  middle east is religious . 
  shias ( iran , iraq and others ) is 12 % negative , sunnis ( fabulous champions of human rights such as saudi arabia , qatar and others ) is 80 % hate . 
  this is pretty straightforward , russia advised against iraq invasion -  ignored , civil war , hundreds of thousands dead . 
  russia advised against libya hard line , abstained in `` no-fly zone '' , was pissed when it was deceived and vocally expressed such displeasure . 
  well , libya is a wonderful place i heard nowadays / s russia took a stance in syria against `` lets overthrow assad '' plan , no one gave a fuck and continued to supply and train `` rebels '' . 
  result is isis , millions of refugees and caliphate . 
  egypt and saudis are somewhat close , well , its really fucking hard to describe who likes who in middle east and who hates and plots against whom . 
  whole place is basically a clusterfuck . 
  propaganda also works wonders , people there are even more illiterate and listen to al-jazeera , their local `` approved '' news or western media if they are fairly progressive . 
  none of those sources are pro-russian in any way , shape or form . 
  i do n't know much about israel though , i do n't think we meddle there that much or lecture them ( ? ), 
  they probably are ok with chaotic middle east ( if everyone is weak , its means that israel will remain dominant force in the region ) , thus you can `` play '' the region . 
  i am not talking about ukrainian military towing remnants of columns anywhere , i am talking about traveling to the place of engagement , while filming the process . 
  basically civilian `` refugees '' with hidden cameras or something along the lines , there is plenty of spy tech out there and plenty of `` covers '' such as being refugee , journalist , aid worker , doctor , being lost etc etc etc. 
  people `` flee '' to russia , perhaps with their belongings and stop by the destroyed column , because they are `` curious bystanders '' . 
  cover obviously is mostly in case this place is controlled by rebels and they get questioned/stopped . 
  we are living in 21st century , there is so much different shit out there smartphones , dashcams , hidden cameras , satellites , drones with high res shit , give ** something ** as a proof of your words . 
  does ukraine has drones from `` friends '' or something with cameras and stuff ? 
  if they truly did destroyed a column , i doubt someone would bother to bring wreckage back to russia or hide it anywhere . 
  is there a technical possibility to drive to the place where column was destroyed while filming the process with dashcam or whatever and provide actual video footage of shelling results ? 
  there is a difference between `` volunteers '' going to some country to fight there ( see islamic fighters from europe in middle east ) and official army troops being caught * sent * to other country and subsequently destroyed/killed , this shit is way harder to sell to otherwise indifferent russian public . 
  i disagree . 
  sanctions do n't work the way people on the internet think they do - immediate and total meltdown of everything they touch . 
  there were weak parts initially such as restrictions for putin 's inner circle etc , its uncomfortable for them , but nothing too critical , world is a big place . 
  round 2 and 3 were significantly worse for russian economy : restriction of borrowing for russian banks automatically means that russian credit lines for population skyrocket , rates for things like mortgages already climbing , there are other problems as well . 
  what russian banks were doing up until now was borrow in the west for whatever they could 3,4,5,6,7 % and give to population for 12-13-14 etc , relatively simple and profitable business , mainly because russian central bank refused to lower the rates/finance the economy ( beats me why they are not following their beloved washington consensus/frs and ecb ) . 
  russian state owned companies also financed abroad , which is why corporative debt of russia was ~ 700 + bln $ , now they ca n't afford it and companies like rosneft asked recently for 40 bln $ from state . 
  its a shit ton of money out of russian reserve fund ( if it still exists anyway ) . 
  there are plenty of other beggars and every single one of them wants billions of dollars for their `` investment '' policies . 
  this is just what capital restrictions can and will do , mainly because world financial system belongs to west and they can do whatever the fuck they want with it . 
  other sanctions serve other purposes - restriction of technology in energy and defense sphere affect peoples livelihood . 
  if id say tomorrow i wo n't sell you spare parts for your car , you could still drive a car for a while , but when it breaks down - you wo n't have a way to fix it thus you would not be able to drive . 
  same with energy - russian oil and gas companies still work , but with restrictions of technology they ca n't expand into arctic , ca n't upgrade pipes , ca n't develop new fields and so on . 
  defense contractors employ ~ 2 million people in russia , if they ca n't finish their job , because western companies refuse to supply them with `` double purpose '' products/technology , they might loose their job and russian modernization of an army goes to shit as well . 
  all of this is pretty bad , but the main thing is - ** effect is not immediate ** . 
  all of this is true for * ukraine * as well , their lives are getting a bit worse by the day due to hryvna problems , trade with russia , war and others . 
  problems will continue to accumulate and can eventually lead to a snowball effect , solutions must be found , otherwise a significant drop in quality of life is imminent for both russia and ukraine . 
  ukraine has less time for that though , this winter and next year spring would be crucial for them . 
  when this thing started , i said that unless west wishes to make out of ukraine another poland during late 80 , early 90s ( read up - debt forgiven , massive funding , basically a marshall aid plan times x ) , they will fail . 
  i stand by my words , you either help them massively or the pendulum swings back ( given ukrainians desire to truly change how they operate as a nation ) . 
  nothing that i did not expect several months ago , when russia annexed crimea . 
  i thought he would be a bit more rational though , meaning take crimea , stir some shit up in south-east ukraine and back out to let europe + u.s save face , but the `` play '' has turned into `` drama '' already . 
  it does look like a self-fulfilling prophecy about ukraine in nato , possible war and all that jazz . 
  its like we want this shit or smtn , ukraine were in transitioned/turbulent period and during `` uneasy '' times all sorts of shit gets brought to surface ( including infamous zomg nazi 's etc ) . 
  its natural for things to be somewhat chaotic during uprisings and state not always have 100 % of control , nor do people react adequately . 
  i mean listen to yatsenyuk , guy is a millionaire , supposed to be smart , but his statements are like comedy gold . 
  it was kind a ironic to hear about russia transferring tech `` captured '' in crimea ( described by russian officials as junk ) only to hear that later down the line , separatists are having a hard time and russia will halt the transfer of the equipment . 
  we still continue to release captured/fled ukrainian military personnel back to ukraine , but i guess here we ca n't really legally detain them . 
  overall i do n't think the picture is that grim as you described , because europe were slowly moving away from russian energy sources for quite some time already and transportation of oil & gas by sea still cost some money along with terminals , tankers and such , but yes , putin kind a did gave `` a second breath '' for eurozone and its not so clear to me that crimea was worth all of it . 
  not to mention future economic damage from sanctions in terms of equipment in energy sector and shittier credit lines for population for 15 % a year or smtn . 
  such is life in russia . 
  good thing i stopped watching russian tv a decade ago : /, 
  numbers do n't lie bro , why there are significantly less russians in different stans and why are they not coming back there , if its safe now and no one will harm them in any way ? 
  from your viewpoint people just got up and left to never come back , with no `` outside stimuli '' so to speak . 
  just like god knows how many syrians suddenly decided to relocate from their respective country , or yazidi guys or any other ethnic group who suddenly had the urge to travel !, 
  this is your universal truth , deviation from it means death for you , got it . 
  yes , what should russia have done in case russian citizens were ethnically cleansed in chechnya or simply made leave under a barrel of ak ? 
  this one is for first chechen campaign . 
  for second one , what should russia do if 10k of `` enlightened freedom fighters '' invaded neighbor republic and started killing people with all the usual stops of : `` nice '' videos of beheadings , rapes , kidnappings , theft , violence and hostage/ransom situations ( list goes on ) ? 
  basically , what should have russia done if isis invaded dagestan right about now ? 
  politely ask them to leave and stop or take it up the ass ? 
  i am sure you can come up with a great plan to solve all world problems . 
  edit to your edit , so you base your viewpoint on assumptions and wishful thinking that russians just packed their things and left all the republics and actions of people from these republics had nothing to do with it , right ? 
  then why is that russians are not returning back to their homes then , i mean , no one is carpet bombing them anymore , so its totally is ok right ? 
  where are you from , pick a flair please , so i could understand with whom i am trying to engage in a conversation , but feel more and more like a conversation between and blind and a deaf man . 
  judging by human history we will have ww3 in this century , perhaps not the way ww2 played out and somewhat different due to tech development . 
  but that would probably be around mid century , when number of problems we currently have will increase tenfold and people wo n't be able to get clean water , food , energy and so on . 
  no , i am not judging anyone , you can stop putting words in my mouth , thank you very much . 
  i do point out time and time again , that nothing appears in vacuum and things and relations develop over time between interested parties , what you are trying to do is to portray the world as a clear-cut black and white picture , where one side is clearly in the wrong , because it did something . 
  however you completely disregard the other side of the story , thus when you choose a certain viewpoint/worldview , you completely ignore possibilities or anything that does not fit the narrative . 
  in that aspect you are closer to religious fanatics just like the `` wonderful '' people from isis i mentioned before . 
  chechens did a whole lot more than a couple of terror acts and their atrocities are well documented , just like russia did a lot of terrible things to them as well . 
  the difference between me and you , is that i am more open minded and can try to understand the other side , for you - there is only one universal truth and you are its adept , anything that does not fit into it is dismissed , disregarded and thrown out to dumpster . 
  tell me , oh great one , why is that russian % population in oppressed chechnya is ~ 3-5 % ? 
  you would think if we ethnically cleansed the place and `` removed chechens from premises '' there would be more of us than during soviet times at least , no ? 
  yes , the world is black and white , russians are clearly the worst scum on earth and they just enjoy oppressing and killing everyone !!!, 
  / s there is no way that wonderful peace loving chechens would do anything bad . 
  brothers tsarnaev send you regards bro or if you are more up to date , isis did nothing wrong , `` leave them alone ! '', 
  ( c ) * in tears * . 
  what did russian peacekeepers did wrong in georgia ? 
  died at the hands of georgian artillery/aviation ? 
  who is an example of constructivism anyway ? 
  dutch ? 
  is cyprus issue has solved itself ? 
  what about african peacekeeping missions , how successful are they ? 
  i do n't like pointing fingers , but you are from united states , you guys are a definition of * overdoing * things with your carrier groups and general overreaction to anything from shutting down entire city because of 2 terrorists on the loose , to 700 billion $ military budget . 
  your ww2 history is kind a interesting in that regard , the amount of tech , ships , planes and army you amass before any operation is astounding and you almost annihilate anyone who oppose you  ( vietnam , fire bombings , nukes etc ) . 
  i wonder is it because it is generally how you are or you care about casualties and safe of your troops , hard to tell : / nonetheless , impressive . 
  i can see your point . 
  how would you describe ukrainian media then and sources that ukrainian redditors provide here ? 
  even though i do n't speak ukrainian , i can probably understand 40-50 % of it , so when i followed initial euromaidan i daily heard all sorts of shit about russia and its involvement . 
  as it turned out up until crimea , all of it was bullshit ; but a lie repeated 100 000 times worked pretty well and the sentiment of euromaidan was ** strongly ** anti-russian ( including the infamous `` deal '' ) .
