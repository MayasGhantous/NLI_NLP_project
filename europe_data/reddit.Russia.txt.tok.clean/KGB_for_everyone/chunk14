  a lot of it was on russian as well and quite a number of videos were debunked as fake being released by sbu , media and various `` activists '' , do n't you think it also creates a certain `` information field '' which implants certain ideas into subconscious ? 
  ca n't say anything about officials , from what i 've seen there seems to be a constant interest from either u.s military or u.s led think-tank groups mostly in regards to united european military . 
  they probe from time to time with `` how would you feel about european military or picking up the required 2.0 % nato spending stuff '' on a regular basis , i guess if they are interested in shifting their focus to `` pivot in asia '' and africa . 
  it only makes sense to slowly , but surely influence and check out what people think , after all its probably harder to make constant census among population and annoy them with questions , while on the internet its way easier , cheaper and faster . 
  russia 's actions in ukraine helped a lot i am sure of it , 
  do you think georgian army was planning to give out candy in south osetia via grads ? 
  how do you think things would work out if they say capture tsikhnvalli and blew up the only tunnel which connects them to `` mainland '' so to speak ? 
  what are the chances of `` removing osetians from premises '' if they for about 20 years hated and shot at each other almost every other day ? 
  do you think osetians would sit quietly and take it up the butt ? 
  what if georgians blew up their homes and they had nowhere to go but russia , is this considered ethnic cleansing or democratic `` redeployment '' of population ? 
  all i am trying to say is i somehow doubt that it would be all unicorns and rainbows there if russia did not stopped georgia right from the get go . 
  you invade someone with a plan most of the time , i doubt osetians were included in those plans in any nice way possible . 
  but there is close to zero doubt that russia and others are engaged in their respective `` 50 cent '' parties , the issue is - why do you think they are here ? 
  i highly doubt that i am somehow more intelligent than people in charge of these astroturfers , after all , they probably are connected to intelligence services and various think tank groups , to spread `` correct version of events '' . 
  i can understand * worldnews * being heavily shilled with it ~ 7 mln subs ( even paid to mods or smtn ) , this sub however is 100 times lesser , the closest to european official seen here was some danish lady i think which did an ama , what makes you think that russia will waste time and resources here , especially judging by / r/europe frontpage and comment section , quite ineffectively ? 
  i am sure its as black and white as you described , silly me , thinking it was a bit more complicated and it was a process which started * at least * ~ 20 years ago ( if not more ) with mutual hate , anger and contempt . 
  they just suddenly started hate each other out of the blue and ethnically cleanse their enemies !, 
  i wonder if russians from former soviet republics are considered ethnically cleansed , because judging by the numbers of before soviet union collapse and after , number of russians significantly drop in these respected republics ( stans , chechnya , dagestan and others ) . 
  i wonder why was that and why russian families had to leave in such a hurry leaving behind their homes , property or selling them for cents ? 
  edit to your edit , i think russia started to care when 10k `` brave freedom fighters with a taste for beheading '' strolled into dagestan . 
  chechnya was a definition of a failed state by any means , hell , they still probably are , but at least they are kept quiet under kadyrov warlord persona . 
  i think its better than blowing up schools , capturing musical theaters , bombing metro 's and train stations , bus routes and all the other wonderful things that these people were engaged in . 
  i personally would vote with 2 hands and a leg to let chechnya go if they so wish so , but please do n't come to russia with your organized crime groups , human trafficking , violent , barbaric behavior and culture . 
  we have plenty of `` oppressed '' minorities from central asia whom when they liberated themselves from evil russians strangely ended up being mexicans of russia . 
  as it turned out , when russians left , they did n't exactly immediately turned into saudi arabia or kuweit and shit went downhill . 
  nowadays they fix our bathrooms or sell fruits . 
  hell of a `` great future '' , your ancestors participated in great buildings of the century , enjoyed relatively high standard of living , had employment and social benefits , their grandsons are gastarbaitars . 
  talk about change . 
  right for self-determination , ever heard about it ? 
  by that logic there is no place for kurdistan in iraq + syria + turkey , kosovo should not exist because it was a part of yugoslavia and so on . 
  these republic/puppet buffer states has made their choice more than 20 years ago , when all the other republic/buffer states broke free from evil soviet union , the difference with georgia is that they decided they could get away with getting them back via force , it did n't worked out . 
  last time i checked georgia signed european association document recently and there were no `` peacekeepers '' on the street of tbilisi . 
  where is the mysterious hand of moscow in georgia nowadays ? 
  genuinely interested . 
  so , honest question : whenever you read something that differentiates from your worldview , you immediately dismiss all other points or thoughts , right ? 
  like a certain person posts a wall of text , you find something you do n't like ( grammatical error , inaccuracy , overexaggeration ) and dismiss everything else that person writes hence onward ? 
  i will admit that i used somewhat of a hyperbole and a cheap shot at united states , but the main point remains the same , after 2008 war georgia remained a sovereign state , its borders were practically ( there are reports about russian fences here and there , but nothing outrageous ) untouched , its president at the time is still not in gulag , newly elected georgia pm/president is pretty european oriented and russia does jack shit about it , european investigation committee has found that georgia started the conflict ( read wiki if you do n't believe me ) there are no ongoing civil war there , nor every day car bombings and stuff . 
  in my playbook , this is * not that bad * of an outcome for a ** conflict ** between two states . 
  russia did n't bombed georgia into the stone age and people seem to be living * ok ` ish * there ? 
  small edit : my cheap shot was also about soviet union engagement in afghanistan , we stayed there for 10 years , i would like to think that we learned the lesson with prolonged campaigns in other countries . 
  russian shill reporting for duty !, 
  watched bits and pieces of the movie , enjoyed music backgrounds of evil imperialist russia and a nice and light tune of poor little tbilisi + other minor things like comparison between living conditions of russian army vs georgian ( it was no secret that russian side was poor equipped and looked hideous , hence rearmament campaign and so on i guess ) , boris nemtsov in every single anti-regime video it seems etc. 
  overall , 8/10 propaganda video . 
  strangely enough mr.saakashvilli is still alive and kicking ( not even in jail , although georgians themselves issued an arrest order recently i think ? 
  state department was `` concerned '' about its little pet project and voiced its solicitude , was kind a amusing to see ) and georgia is not occupied by russian forces for 10 years . 
  neither abkhazia nor south ossetia is annexed into russian federation either , weird , huh?but anyway back to more interesting topic . 
  i am genuinely interested by which criteria redditors here engage in witch hunts ? 
  like , what exactly indicates a russian paid shill and why do you think so ? 
  i thought about this for a bit and this makes no sense to me at all , this is a relatively small sub with ~ 70k subs and about 300-500 people online every moment or so , unless there is some kind of interesting development or event like eurovision/wc . 
  what makes you people think that russia is actively engaged here ? 
  a lot of anti-russian news are heavily upvoted and usually at the top of the front page here , anti russian comments have more positive score than pro russian ones , the quality of news are right there with sun/daily mail , fox news etc. 
  whats the deal ? 
  here is how you could really shill and sway public opinions ( my thoughts ) : 1 ) register a number of alt accounts preferably via proxies , tors and other shit , so that your ips would show different places of the world , thus negating the possible investigation of mods ( i dunno if they see ips and shit , so i included them as well ) / admins . 
  the reason this is effective should be obvious , first several upvotes matter a whole lot more on reddit than the next 30 and so on . 
  there were numerous scandals on r/dota2 , unidan guy , chanman etc , there is plenty of good evidence why people do it and what power it gives to them . 
  2 ) when you have these alts you can either heavily downvote anti-russian sentiment or upvote pro russian ones , pretty straightforward i think . 
  3 ) if possible , comment via these alts as well , preferably using ** non-russian ** flair . 
  the reason i think this is somewhat important is whenever i see german , french/uk flair i subconsciously give them more `` power '' so to speak , as to having more balanced view or whatever . 
  i * expect * russia bashing from ukrainians and eastern europeans/baltics more , thus the weight this messages carry degrades over time . 
  this is somewhat of a / pol stuff , when people on imgboards made fun of poles and their martyr syndrom , similar to how a lot of eastern europeans hated russia even before ukraine ordeal . 
  you can also use this alt accounts to troll , neglect , make fun of someone with valid points , basically nsa/gchq playbook of killing internet discussions from time to time . 
  4 ) give occasional gold or two with similar reasoning of non-russian flair , gold = someone thought this is interesting , important -  i should probably check it out . 
  5 ) voting rings/downvote brigades should be used from time to time as well . 
  there is probably more aspects to that , these are the first that come to mind . 
  from what i 've seen here , if anything , this is exactly the opposite of a place , where russian shills are engaged . 
  thoughts ? 
  subsidize farmers via ecb credit lines or smtn , this is nowhere near the bailout levels of any banks and this is peoples jobs and livelihood . 
  maybe debatable , but russia still has n't done shit in south osetia and abkhazia besides giving out money to local elites , i do n't think people there live any better than they were , although i might be wrong in that regard , but its usual corruption + corruption + kickbacks ordeal . 
  i was n't the one who said that georgians elected pro russian candidate though , i think i hinted at association agreement and trade stuff as evidence of that : /, 
  well , for starters russians did n't start the 2008 war , neither did they annexed south ossetia and abkhazia afterwards , only recognized their independence which was not so different from status-quo before the conflict . 
  i am not sure , but i think georgia recently signed eu association agreement ? 
  its not like georgia is eager to join eurasian union or anything like that , just mainly damage control and reestablishment of trade ties , makes sense . 
  i disagree , if anything , this is a nice excuse to implement sergei glazyev '' \u0438\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 '' strategy , which roughly means changing easy to replace western products ( such as agriculture and low tech products , whatever it is russia importing is ) with our own native production . 
  theoretically this should boost gdp growth , tax collection and create dem jobs . 
  on practice , if russia was expecting an escalation in terms of sanctions and its role in ukraine , we should have reacted way before and created and implemented a variety of policies and plans , to counter possible negatives . 
  this is a simple game of chess with quite predictable outcomes if i may , did russian government seriously thought there would be no repercussions ? 
  i also wonder , why is that russian intelligence/industrial groups are not actively engaged in industrial espionage against technological leaders such as germany , france , netherlands , united states , israel and others . 
  not that i would encourage stealing others people work or anything , but if you want to go full machiavelli/ussr like approach , you need access to the tech , otherwise your economy will implode and you loose power . 
  i know we kind a already do this stuff , but nowhere near the required level if we wanted to sever our ties with west , hell , china does this shit for decades and no one really cares it seems . 
  it would also be nice to create stuff like schools/engineering courses and try to get countries mentioned above in teaching how to work on modern technologies , maybe even previous gen , but you need to start * somewhere * . 
  what i am looking at is raiding pension funds , raise of taxes , censorship , desire to spent reserve funds and a general lack of strategical thinking on any level . 
  is russian elite really that rotten and incapable of thinking several steps ahead ? 
  you do n't have to be a genius for any of that , it has happened numerous times in human history , do they not read books or smtn . 
  well , yes , as soon as we annexed crimea it became a reality . 
  if beforehand it was somewhat of a cold , with '' \u0445\u043e\u0445\u043b\u044b \u043d\u0435\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438 , \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0441\u044b '' banter , now its beyond good and evil so to speak . 
  overall , its not that it was impossible to predict such outcome given the media pumping of population minds and hostile actions from russia and to a lesser extent ukraine ( you guys were * mostly * talk , it was nothing new really , so i have no idea why the change of heart and such radical actions from our side ) . 
  it would be nice for a change , to have politics think about their actions consequences before the fallout . 
  i mean , srsly , i can understand the idea behind crimea annexation as being not worth complete meltdown of international relations between europe + u.s vs russia ( not that i am an avid supporter of it ) , in this respect we `` only '' completely destroy our future relations with 40 million ukrainians . 
  but to mock every single sanction imposed at the same time covertly ( or not so ) supporting `` rebels '' would surely have a greater impact you would think . 
  i mean this is not rocket science that consequences would follow russia 's actions and we will have troubles with all kind of shit starting from joint ukrainian designed military tech to western financial systems and so on . 
  now we are banning food imports , which would not be so bad if ** beforehand ** we developed our own agricultural segment , not in august ffs . 
  there are shit like cycles of reproduction , branding , marketing , audience targeting and so on . 
  i really do n't fucking get it , this is not that hard to calculate and if you are committing some actions , you should be able to include consequences into equation and what needs to be done to nullify the effect of those consequences without major economical damage to your country . 
  winning great patriotic war is great and all , but loosing 27 million people in the process not so much . 
  you can add there stuff like from 33 to 50 % of country being completely and utterly destroyed , the need to compete in arms race and other regions with somewhat of a united western world with united states in the lead ( who btw accumulated by the end of ww2 about 50 % of world wealth , you are brit , you should have an estimation what kind of power it gives ) with reserve currency status and all that stuff . 
  there are many other things like proxy wars , cold war , censorship , purges/gulags ( although much less after ww2 ) etc , etc. 
  russians are proud about ww2 win , as it was a war for survival and we did survive , but calling it the greatest time , is like calling someone who fought cancer and won , but lost almost everything in the process - from hair to house , to will to live , to abandoning any ideals or dreams we ever had . 
  nowadays we just live the day without giving a shit about anything . 
  peter was a great reformer who modernized russia , but it was catching up to west mostly , we were never in the lead , nor did russian people ever enjoyed prosperity . 
  look up construction of st.petersburg , dictator at heart , although western oriented .
