  i would say that there are still plenty of talented russian programmers , who work and live in russia , but yes , brain drain is an old problem as well and there is little being done about it . 
  no matter how hard you try , people will always look for better opportunities or search for places where `` grass is greener '' . 
   you talk about voting for putin and `` his '' oligarchs rather than voting for `` random people '' or western appointed puppets . 
  this again is a trait of russian fatalism . 
  i was n't talking about puppets , i was talking about a real alternative to putin . 
  do you think there 's something inherently different here which hinders russia 's attempts of establishment a proper government ? 
  again this government does not need to be pro anything . 
  all it has to do is be accountable and work for its people ( from my point of view something putin fails at ) . 
  opposition in russia does not exist , reasons for that are plenty and thensome , there is no alternative to putin apart from maybe navalny guy , but he looks a bit shady and i would say that he moved into political field too soon , he should a fought corruption and bribery more , develop his brand and recognition and do the other political stuff like gathering supporters , developing positive political program with changes and all the other shit politicians do . 
  as of now , his fate is in limbo , he is under house arrest on questionable charges , but from my pov ( i ca n't speak for all the russians obv ) it will be hard for him to make a career , people do n't trust him enough . 
  they kind a had a chance to do something during 2011-2012 protest movement , but all the opposition leaders kept on pulling blanket on themselves , so they discredited in the eyes of population . 
  again , this is just my point of view , i can not speak for everyone . 
  as for something preventing russians from revolting first read this http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1z9j57/putin_ask_for_authorization_to_send_russian/cfrtb6m then this http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1z9j57/putin_ask_for_authorization_to_send_russian/cfrw0xh i wish there was a couple hours long movie or smtn , which would explain who are russians , how they came where they are now and what led to it , because i am tired of posting wall of texts trying to explain something very obvious to me , but hard to understand for people from other countries . 
  it would be so much easier to communicate with having a starting point , which everyone would be aware of . 
  but back to `` proper government '' , again all goes back to 90s and lost of trust . 
  ** russians do not trust other russians ** , this is pretty much it . 
  90s were a time when first it was the government who betrayed its people and stole from them everything , dismantling social institutions and services in the meantime . 
  government consist of people as stupid as it sounds , so the people in order to survive , went full fucking retard and betrayed themselves meaning - no more brothers and sisters , no more friends and communes , no more * trust * , ** only money ** . 
  it is hard to explain what was going on during 90s , something like wild wild west with a general desire to screw your neighbor , steal the money , * everything for myself and fuck the other guy * . 
  if you are familiar with history , try to combine something like great depression + weimar republic stuff , this was russia in late 80s , and throughout all 90s . 
  when millions died from diseases , poverty and loss of ideals/everything they worked , hoped for - west watched and was glad to provide assistance in sheltering stolen money , selling properties , establishing offshore companies and all the other shit . 
  i would say this is one of the main reason of russian distrust for you guys ( again from my pov ) . 
  about russia + america revolting stuff , i would not be so sure , russia does not have the capabilities of nsa and other dozen intelligence agencies , i am no psychic , i only see what is currently going on and judging by that - `` the people '' are loosing , maybe it will change , who knows , but i am russian so i am optimistic that its gon na be way worse than it is right now  lastly , i took no offense or anything like that , you seemed genuinely interested so i tried to answer the best i could , i tend not to put labels on people , apart from when they are obviously loaded with an agenda or special interest . 
  reassessment is needed , but it is unclear whether russia would go full retard or stop half-way , a lot of unknowns still in play , so its hard to predict which path we will take . 
  well , kprf which is second biggest party is decapitated due to zyuganov ( its leader since 90s ) , you can think of him as apparatchik who is good at `` cleaning up place '' , but who has no desire for power and it is highly likely he is on a payroll of kremlin in some way , be it shares of stock , money , property or anything else . 
  guy is a useless piece of shit , nothing in common with someone who would want to lead someone or change something . 
  zhirinovsky and ldpr is a state approved clown , whose job is to steal votes from kprf and accumulate far right retards , he talks a lot of stupid shit , no one takes him seriously , but he serves his purpose of controlling radical viewpoints . 
  during recent protests a couple of new faces appeared who seemed to be against a status-quo , they are in jail now , some of them justified , some not . 
  generally i have n't really followed them , caz i am not a radical . 
  there was prokhorov and his joke of a party , `` spravedlivaya rossiya '' with mironov ( who is an old friend of putin ) and a couple of others parties , all of them shares one trait in common - they are a `` button pushers '' , meaning they do everything kremlin says or orders to . 
  opposition in russia does not exist , there is a variety of reasons for that as well , i would put equal guilt both on opposition leaders and kremlin for that . 
  russians do n't trust anyone ( except maybe their family members ) . 
  period . 
  reasons for that are plenty , but the general idea is betrayal - by both state and west . 
  no one * important * gives a shit about a russian or his opinion , so russians in return do n't give a shit about anything at all . 
  russians are just like any human are dualistic in nature , the only difference is - being more extreme version of it . 
  this means that russians can be kind , understanding and caring or unbelievably violent , cruel and hating . 
  middle ground segment again simply not care . 
  if given a choice of whom to put as a head of state ( although i never voted for the guy ) i would choose putin over a random piece of shit or a western appointed `` prominent opposition leader '' , because from my point of view western leaders/think tanks/politicians/corporations / banks do n't give a shit about a russian or his everyday life , or what he think . 
  they already showed that attitude time and time again , so in my mind in a pure sense of self-preservation putin and his buddies oligarchs whom he controls , would be more interested in a prosperous and strong russia . 
  need i remind you where did all the stolen money from russia went from the last 20 + years of plundering russia ? 
  do you think no one knew where they came from ? 
  do you think anyone cared ? 
  so when i hear about bad corrupt russia nowadays and how it would be just wonderful if it would be more complacent and cooperative , a small movement upwards starts in the corner of my mouth , with a thought of `` hey , how about you guys would just go and fuck yourself '' . 
  lastly , about injustice stuff , united states for example has a bigger income inequality disparity than anyone in the world and i believe there are about 50 million people on food stamps or smtn , why no one revolting there , when trillions of dollars are pumped into wall street ? 
  russians are just as people as americans , they are not aliens from other galaxy , their reasoning would be similar if asked . 
  there is this thing called intelligence and special services , there are things like agents , high officials on payroll and many many other wonderful things . 
  to think that russian intelligence did not knew about upcoming `` dealing with south osetia '' problem is pretty silly . 
  in order to take on territory you need years of preparations , logistical and military training ( including stuff like instructors from other countries like israel and whatnot ) and so on . 
  let 's not forget the fact that israelis i believe gave away georgian drone codes/controls in exchange for iranian , at least i 've read something like that . 
  it is highly likely that saakashvili was betrayed by someone from his inner circle or one of his `` allies '' for something very lucrative from the russian side . 
  such is life . 
  if id be an immoral realpolitik asshole , i would throw these protesters under the bus , preferably with a lot of violence involved , thus making them martyrs/heroes . 
  only to be back several months later when hatred towards newly elected government and imf reforms would grew enough , to stir serious dissent and large enough protests , not couple thousand people . 
  but putin already surprised world before , so who knows wtf is going on : /, 
  enjoy your tea comrade ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  eastern europeans base themselves anti-russian as part of their * national identity * , this is a very useful tool to point finger at big bad wolf to the east . 
  for all the talk of their `` miracles '' and `` developments '' none of them reached anything close to south korea , japan or any other asian tigers , so blaming russia for every single misfortune is only natural for them , because russia is no saint either and has done plenty of shit in the past , but they simply ** can not let it go ** . 
  there are plenty of reasons for such behavior and one of them is ** money ** , meaning they expect for russia to * pay * for poor victims of occupation , oppression , yada yada , similar to germany . 
  naturally russia will never agree to any of this shit , so nothing will change in the next couple decades . 
  regarding the so called `` russian launched agressive cyberattack on estonia '' . 
  i am a part of russian informational field and i remember runet being up in arms about the whole ordeal . 
  almost everyone was pissed at estonians , people were really upset and wanted to take action/do something . 
  experts in wiki article disagree with the notion of this being engineered and conducted by russian special forces . 
  i tend to agree with that and judging from * my personal experience * this was something i 'd call a `` patriotic ddos '' , nothing more , nothing less . 
  and lastly , this was no lenin statue who no one gives a fuck about , but a memorial for ww2 soldiers , this is no joke for common russian and if you for example would pee in a `` eternal fire '' in any russian city , there is a decent chance that if get caught - first someone would break a couple of bones in your body and then you will get a criminal record ( maybe even serve couple years in colony ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_estonia, 
  do you think that putin is a character from red alert or smtn ? 
  sitting in his cabinet , discussing with his * economic * advisers in banes voice - `` it does n't matter who we are , what matters is our plan . 
  no one cared who i was till i took part of ukraine . 
  the fire rises and the time for fear will come when baltics , finland and entirety of eastern europe would once again became a part of glorious mother russia '' . 
  guy was fired 9 years ago , probably left a sour taste in his mouth , now his job is to spew all kinds of bullshit for his employers and if you can combine pleasure with work - all the better .

  possession is 9/10 of the law , crimea is a lost cause . 
  economy was tanking whole previous year and flight of capital only accelerated , if anything - this is a perfect excuse to blame sanctions for worsening economical condition , common russians are not that invested in stocks and shit , they do n't care . 
  devaluation of currency is also good for exports , bad for population again ( caz a lot of food and goods is imported ) , but you can blame west once again  i would like to know the amount of `` real '' foreign investment in russia though , not money laundered in tax havens and offshore such as cyprus , netherlands and later returned to russia to do business . 
  nato was pretty hostile to russia from the point of its creation to collapse of soviet union . 
  it did not dissolved but in fact increased its activity , thus your argument is invalid . 
  you guys live in your informational field , russians live in different one , in russian - west betrayed russia over and over again , thus animosity towards you grew . 
  again , from russian pov we offered you help and proposed partnership or asked for security guarantees , you spat on our face , denounced us as loosers and shat on all kinds of agreements and treaties . 
  putin is a logical conclusion to open humiliation and complete disregard of russian interest . 
  lastly , you do realize that the leader who would let ukraine join nato would be a national traitor in the eyes of the russians , right ? 
  this is pure and simple geopolitics , no hatred , just strategic position and immense importance for russian national security . 
  i think this is more of a russia being back against the wall , since even `` our backyard '' is at threat . 
  russia would have responded be it putin or any other guy and i doubt that this is the end of the story . 
  there was this thing , called war , it destroyed from 33 to 50 % of the country , killed 27 million people ( as shitty as it sounds , loosing males of working age is worse for economy and country , than cripples or old people ) , left ussr with huge debts and a need to restore almost everything including places like poland , baltics , east germany and so on . 
  compare this to united states who had zero unemployment , became the richest country in the world with gigantic industrial machine , acquired former british empire markets and many , many , many other things . 
  sometimes i wonder if people even think about other side 's ** starting conditions ** ... 
  well its not like they fall from the sky  you develop them over time and a lot of basic things like food , chemicals , flowers , some machinery . 
  basically instead of sending money to siemens , metro and bayern , we would start making our own , perhaps shittier , but we would have no choice , thus diversifying our economy and creating jobs . 
  its gon na be tough , but if we want to stop being an `` energy empire '' , this needs to be done . 
   that is an insane version of events . 
  i ca n't say anything because i have n't been there , but several ukrainian posters have presented to me a different version . 
  maidan started as a protest against corruption . 
  russia was not portrayed negatively in media , there 's been a massive pro/anti russian divide ( again , i repeat what i 've read ) . 
  da fuck you are talking about ? 
  euromaidan has its name for a reason . 
  it started as a protest ** against ** russia proposed deal and signed by yanukovych , you know , the one with 15 billion $ and a reduction on price for gas . 
  yanukovych kept bullshitting his people that they are moving towards association agreement and europe , but he crumbled under russian economical pressure . 
  the first month of euromaidan it was a protest ** against ** russian deal and ** for ** european future . 
  then * later * down the line it become a protest against corruption , bad yanukovych and government .
