  the initial opposition leaders - klitchko , yatsenyuk , tyahnibok were all for european deal , read up how it started jeez . 
  during this whole time russia was portrayed not in a positive light , whenever i tuned in into live streams such as expresso , spilno and others i kept on hearing the same fucking shit that was during orange revolution of 2004 , `` russian tanks are coming '' , `` chechen spetsnaz is almost there '' , `` russian intelligence is everywhere ! '' . 
  i would agree , that the amount of anti-russian bullshit has skyrocketed since invasion of crimea , but it was pretty bad even before events of 20-21 of february . 
  open euromaidan and euromaidanpr twitter , scroll back to couple months and observe `` daily reminders '' of hand of moscow . 
  this is brainwashing in its finest , propaganda is being used by both sides , so when you hear that russia is bullshitting with banderovets stuff , there is an equal amount of bullshit from ukrainian media . 
  these are well known and documented manipulation of mass conscious techniques , they create the mood , the attitude and the notion of enemy . 
  * both sides * were engaged in this shit . 
   i really do n't understand russian logic - russian imperialism dictates to conquer all the orthodox , slavic or generically eastern european lands because they 're similar . 
  surely , with hundreds of years of brutal domination and today with the internet you 'd discover that they 're different ? 
  i am no imperialist , so i ca n't tell . 
  you should talk to someone who is interested in restoration of soviet union , not me . 
   and also pan-slavic romanticism , best propaganda invention of russians !, 
  i really ca n't see why the belief that `` slavs are superior than germanics because they 're more spiritual '' is any less wrong than `` germanics are superior than slavs because they 're more rational '' . 
  i expressed a concern that it would be pretty sad if `` brothers '' would start slaughtering each other , nothing else . 
  nor russian nor ukrainians would benefit from a blood bath , but a weakened russia is desirable for pretty much everyone from china to u.s to european union , so russia would continue to cave in to foreign interests . 
  i do n't think there are many russians who think that `` russians are superior to everyone else !, 
  '' , i think they are in a overwhelming minority , just like praviy sector or svoboda guys . 
   and many russians still have an imperialist mindset . 
  two mad dogs fought over a bone , the red dog won , why would the bone be grateful ? 
   shit on your history ? 
  like what ? 
  ask compensation for fifty years of you shitting on our history , of teaching about `` evil feudal and imperialist poles '' and how empress catherine the great destroyed poland `` because she was pure-blooded german '' ? 
  remind you of nkvd massacres of officers and civilians ? 
  do you expect poland to stay silenced ? 
  yes they do and poles also think that they are the greatest , `` from sea to sea '' and so on . 
  so what ? 
  i do n't think i have proposed anywhere to invade everyone around us and conquer the world , nor any sane russian would propose such thing , we are peaceful people and only get violent if you try to fuck with us . 
  you should be grateful , because black dog wanted to kill your mom and dad , and their mom and dad and a lot of other moms and dads , if black dog would have won , poland , ukraine , baltics , jews - none of them would exist , as simple as that . 
  red dog also restored your country devastated by war . 
  if you remember history - poland annexed part of czechoslovakia , refused russian troops to pass through , thinking they could handle germans , you failed , the rest is history . 
  through sheer existence of red dog concepts like colonial empire vanished over the time , new things like worker right were introduced , pensions were implemented and many other things . 
  if red dog would not exist , you would * probably * still work 15 hours a day for minimum wage without any benefits or social stuff . 
  if you would pay attention where world labor force is moving , you would notice that everything shifts to dismantling of social institutions and abandoning or workers rights , rich keep on getting richer , poor get even more poorer and in debt . 
  i believe there are even talks about debt prisons somewhere in the states , if this is not 18 century shit , i do n't know what is . 
  how would you like also an idea to pay bail outs for failed banks , bad debt with your money ? 
  this is already a reality and things would get even `` funnier '' , not so long ago polish pension funds were all transferred under management of state , do you think they did it out of care for the people ? 
   shit on your history ? 
  like what ? 
  ask compensation for fifty years of you shitting on our history , of teaching about `` evil feudal and imperialist poles '' and how empress catherine the great destroyed poland `` because she was pure-blooded german '' ? 
  remind you of nkvd massacres of officers and civilians ? 
  do you expect poland to stay silenced ? 
  if you want money , you wo n't get shit , simple as that . 
  there are always 2 sides of the coin , you can bring poland partitioning , i can bring your opportunism during 1605 war and your sacking of moscow . 
  you as hardcore polish nationalist may not like it , but the idea that you guys are angels , who did no wrong and constantly suffer because everyone around you is evil , is disingenuous to say the least . 
  russians has a very good historical memory and they do n't forget `` good deeds '' , you may not like it , but in reality poland and your commonwealth managed throughout history to piss off pretty much everyone around it . 
  there is a certain pattern from a ** russian point of view ** , best described by this comic http://i.imgur.com/ccc5afp.png you start pissing everyone off , you will get handled by `` bigger boys '' . 
  most recent examples would be you installing abm shield , russia deploying iskanders ; poland wants a better gas prices - russia and germany build nord stream . 
  bigger and stronger countries has ** more tools ** to influence its neighbors or work around troubling developments , you guys do n't have that much . 
  this is why you are `` most important partner '' with u.s and host all those cia prisons , missile shields and other shit , because by yourself in world of realpolitik poland is not that strong . 
  this is also the reason for existence of polandball , which originated on image boards such as krautchan and 4chan . 
  in regards to katyn and other atrocities , yeah this was stalin getting rid of opposition and possible `` polish divisions '' , a war crime no doubt about that . 
  but we acknowledged it and apologized several times already i believe ? 
  what more do you want ? 
   hahaha , so you actually admit that these are government-manufactured ? 
  so why would even russia be mad over sanctions , when it 's been using them for years , even in a clandestine form ? 
  everyone with 2 brain cells know these are government manufactured , but no one will say this out loud , because this is illegal under a variety of treaties . 
  this is called soft power instrument , there are many others . 
  russia is not the only country in the world who exercises such things , european union is the same . 
  now where the hell did you read that i was mad about sanctions or against them ? 
  everyone knew they were coming and if freezing assets and property of wealthy oligarchs abroad would bring these money back - i am all for it !, 
  remove dirty money from london , stop selling property to russian officials , stop laundering money in tax havens and bring them home . 
  but european union wo n't do any of that , because that would hurt their economies . 
  i am for ** more ** sanctions on wealthy russian officials and oligarchs , make them move money home , not feed european economies and house markets . 
   and when they start considering themselves people , we send in the troops . 
  that 's the russian policy . 
  god forbid they have culture we do n't approve of !, 
  a different road to socialism - send in the tanks !, 
  elections won by the wrong candidate - send in the tanks !, 
  independent worker union - send in the tanks !, 
  are we talking about modern russia or soviet union here ? 
  you should choose one , caz otherwise its pretty difficult to have a discussion . 
  you should also open wiki and type `` colorful revolutions '' and who is behind them , protip - not russia . 
  so far russian `` send in the tanks '' ( which i by the way do n't understand and my feelings toward the fact fluctuate from neutral , to slightly negative ) resulted in 1 dead guy with suspicious circumstances around it . 
  but euromaidan had 100 body bags and i have n't heard anything about international investigation of the matter or any names at all , weird is n't it ? 
  compare this to kosovo campaign , iraq , afghanistan , syria , libya or even egypt coup and counter coup . 
  i guess referendum was rigged as well and all those people celebrating on the streets of simferopol and crimea has done it under machine gun threat ? 
   ukraine is not part of russia anymore . 
  you ca n't enter it and pretend that nothing has happened . 
  russia has ensured territorial integrity of ukraine for fuck 's sake . 
  sure , crimea was immensely important to russian economy and military , and in the long run it would probably better to negotiate a hong-kong-like status for it . 
  but russia has stated its message `` we are ready to invade an independent state in the name of recreating soviet union and we are not afraid of western repercussion '' . 
  why are then russians so hostile when other independent states that have been conquered by the soviet empire declare their negativity ? 
  you ca n't bomb serbia , occupy the country , make referendum and pretend that its ok . serbia constitution does not allow that , serbia is a sovereign state . 
  there 's been plenty of posts about budapest memorandum , how it was not ratified and all the other legal international aspects of this mess . 
  i am not gon na pretend that i am a specialist in international law , neither should you . 
  i know there were other `` precedents '' or `` special cases '' in the past , in the end west has shown the way - `` might makes right '' and international law means jack shit , if you can not enforce it . 
  there is western point of view on recent events , there is a russian one as well . 
  again , do n't put your words in my mouth , i never said we should occupy crimea and ukraine for the sake of it , i too would like to see a better solution , but i am no fucking kremlin official or putin , so i have no fucking idea why it could not be done , but i would guess there were some reasons behind it . 
  i am not a policy maker , i just express my opinion on internet , is that a crime ? 
  you can express your negativity , but biting the hand that feeds you is your own doing . 
  latvia wants for russians to keep on buying their property and lithuania wants to continue to be a major transport hub for trade between russia and europe - it is wise not to shit on someone who is giving you money and work . 
  imagine you openly smearing your employer in front of everyone and him as well , you would loose your job immediately and he will get someone else . 
  this is the same in international relations - you want to make a moral stand and `` do the right thing '' , prepare to open your wallet . 
   so you consider ` destalinization ' and ` perestroika ' equal to shitting on your history ? 
  that 's an interesting point of view . 
  i grew up in russian information field , vast majority of it consisted at the time of shitting on our history , disregarding any achievements and basically saying everything is bad and we should feel bad . 
  as i grew up i have read a lot about situation in russia during different times and the more i have read the more obvious `` liberal '' version of events looked like a whole bunch of bullshit . 
   that 's true , nazism was a direct consequence of western philosophy of rationalism and progress . 
  except that goals of the soviet union were n't much different - just replace ` slavs ' with ` non-communists ' . 
  communism initially was anti capitalist in its nature , thus the idea of confrontation was considered inevitable .
