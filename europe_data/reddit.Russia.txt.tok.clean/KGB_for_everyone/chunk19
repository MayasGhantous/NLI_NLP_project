  you add to that the fact that allies * invaded * soviet union during civil war , were generally hostile towards new state and the idea that ussr would be on friendly terms with west seems ridiculous to me . 
  you continue to look on things from 21 century perspective , back then idealogies existed , it was `` us vs them '' type of thing . 
  eventually stalin dropped the idea of international communist revolution and dismantled '' \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d '' . 
  if communism was equal to nazism , you `` hardcore polish nationalist '' would not exist today and independent poland would not exist as well , this is just a fact based on sheer size and manpower of soviet union compared to polish solidarnost ' movement . 
  your struggle for freedom was crucial , but it was ussr who has let you go . 
   russia ( whom you conveniently omit from your list of empires , nevertheless is in many way the epitome of imperialism , starting from ivan the emperor of all russia and ending , well , with crimea and even possibly transsnistria today ) has laid its eyes on europe many times , in particular the balkans . 
  there is no point even in mentioning russia because back then it was called ** russian empire ** . 
  every empire is the same as i said and they want more influence , power , resources and markets . 
  russian empirialism is well documented and balkans were russian sphere of interest for centuries , this is widely known by everyone at the time , hell , we even started ww1 because of them and pan-slavinism . 
  russia was a policemen of europe in 19 century , but why is it that russia did not conquered your beloved europe ? 
  i mean we took paris , participated in a number of police actions against revolutions and had a pretty good army at the time , yet we did not occupied and conquered europe like napoleon . 
  the answer is again goes in notion with what was considered normal at the time - * spheres of influence and existed treaties * , if russia were to start annexing parts of germany or france , there would be immediately formed a coalition with a goal to stop russia from becoming a dominant power on european continent . 
  open wiki and read about `` great game '' and britain 's actions on the continent throughout centuries . 
  but back to modern times , today poland ( for example ) has ** nothing ** of interest for russia , except missile defence shield , worth of conquest . 
  compared to what russia possess in terms of resources , water and land mass , you possess no threat , nor any significant value . 
  same can be said about any baltics or other countries who are scared shitless of russian tanks rolling in . 
  time of ideologies are long gone and its all about ** raw natural resources ** and ** markets to sell your shit ** now . 
  europe has exhausted its resources long time ago and what you have right now is often economically too expensive to develop . 
  i do n't know if you are aware , but big ** markets ** are the reason for economical prosperity . 
  lets say a pole is working day and night to make pierogi , but he needs to sell them . 
  you can make as much pierogi as your neighbors , friends , city , country can buy and then you hit the economical wall of `` demand met '' . 
  this means that you can not sell any more pierogi and can not grow any more , making you stagnant at best . 
  meanwhile your neighbor from ukraine has managed to get on russian market and sell even more pierogi that you , double the amount , tripple the amount , he is economically stronger than you and he ** can ** start economical warfare against you , to get your market as well . 
  he would possess a variety of instruments from price dumping to smearing campaigns , to pressure on authorities and so on , the list is pretty long . 
  now , because you have n't expanded and improved , you has lost your job and source of income + your country lost taxpayer and money instead of flowing ** in ** poland , are gon na go ** out ** to ukraine , thus even more improving ukraine 's economical position allowing it to buy even more goods and services and poland falling behind even more . 
  this is what markets are all about . 
   so what you 're saying that a ) buffer states actually should belong to one of two zones of influence ( which rather defeats their purpose , other than being a meatshield for your empire and b ) people living there have no say over the future of your motherland . 
  i am not saying anything , i am talking about human history here . 
  belgium wanted to stay neutral , they became highway to france . 
  weak do n't choose my friend , entire human history is confirmation to my words . 
  if you want to be neutral and stay out - you either need to be a natural fortress with every single household having a gun and rigged tunnels , roads , bridges + controlling your neighbors money ( swiss ) or if you are far away and possess no strategical significance you can trade both sides and profit immensely ( sweden ) . 
  in times of big wars there is no choosing , you do what your stronger neighbor tells you to do , such is life . 
  and yes , buffer states serve as a temporarily obstacle to overcome for invading force , thus giving you more time to prepare for war . 
  lastly , about `` no say in motherland stuff '' , again - weak do n't choose , world was split between great powers at the time under a certain condition , one of them was not meddling into others sphere of influence , it was mostly honored because otherwise it would destabilize whole world and everyone would start shitting in each other back yard , making xx century even more bloody than it was . 
  think cuban missile crisis every other year , how do you like that prospect ? 
  i thought it was an obvious joke , because the guy was from norway , no ? 
  i 've seen it over and over again here , how norwegians joked how they would get even more rich if russian gas and oil dependency is reduced . 
  guess i was wrong, 
  ofc , no one is talking about immediate `` tea parties '' , things are yet to unfold . 
  this is like a beginning of act 2 for a long play , a lot of interesting and exciting things await us  and i would agree about magnitsky as well , initially this looked like an applied pressure , which unfortunately hit a vulnerable spot of mr.magnitsky health : / not that i am not feeling bad for him or his family though , its always suck to loose someone close . 
  do u have jewish ancestry by chance ? 
  acceptable loses . 
  putin actually told them several times before to move money and property out of foreign accounts , there were laws prohibiting this etc -  their own fault . 
  it is actually beneficial for the people of russia to see stolen money being frozen or arrested , this means that they have to keep in at least in russia ( maybe if we are lucky , even invest them into our economy ) . 
  you freeze money or restrain capital - you loose credibility and reputation of a safe haven , cyprus was 1 st bell , this is more of a gong . 
  if there would be an escalation of sanctions , it is highly likely that russia will begin abandoning everything that has to do with western financial system or western products , thus stimulating our our production and economy . 
  russia ** can ** afford autarky with several notable exceptions which can be compensated on asian market . 
  this will hurt european economy badly , thus undermining you competitiveness against china/u . s and collapsing smaller economies like latvia , eesti etc. 
  this is why i said i am more interested in european union actions and noted that things might get `` funny '' closer to winter . 
  most of them have moved their assets somewhere else , maybe even in russia . 
  these people are not dumb , i am more interested in european sanctions . 
  this autumn/winter is gon na be action packed i guarantee it  navalny , unfortunately , might share fate of magnitsky or have a sudden heart attack . 
  when you mess with oligarchs money , they are not happy about that . 
  but muh monieees :( http://duckrabbit.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/vladimir-putin-cry-at-victory1.jpg u heartless bastards , how dare u !, 
  this would highly depend on governing body and its ties to business people . 
  for example i would not trust russian government in terms of regulation and accountability , but a dutch one - i see no problem . 
  corporations have bad image not only because `` omg , evil bastards , fuck you !, 
  '' , but also due to fact that their colleagues from other parts of economy have a terrible track record ( oil , mining , banking industry , electricity and many others ) , they are often not held accountable at all . 
  if you live in a 3rd world country , chances of them paying for any damage or health related issues is slim to none , people can not afford multi million dollar law firms or media coverage . 
  they 'll probably need at least 5 years to reverse their public image and built some trust , but even then people would look suspiciously at them , due to previous `` incidents '' . 
  western devils may not understand kirzovie sapogi : / but boots on the ground they know !, 
  you called , comrade ? 
  is there an oppressed minority to be taken care of ? 
  russia is always willing to lend a hand and a boot , 
  it is generally a bad idea to rely on multi-national corporations when it comes to food production and food safety . 
  they are greedy , they want to control it , they are not interested in public health or better competition , they ** will ** raise prices . 
  imagine finland depending on russia for food , do you like the idea and the leverage russia would got over finland ? 
  privyet ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  this is just a start of internal power struggle , batkivshina and udar ( as a side kick ) vs svoboda + right sector . 
  new maidan = svoboda or right sector would be the guys `` who are against bad new idiots , who lost crimea and have n't fixed our country in a month '' . 
  this reminds me of egypt again , what was essentially a liberal protest - lost to muslim brotherhood , because they were better at `` working '' locals , had better networks and proper structure . 
  you guys should watch out , there is gon na be a lot of finger pointing and `` emotional rides '' . 
  ah , sorry about that then . 
  nikolai ii was probably one of the worst tzars in history of russia , so i guess no surprises there . 
  russian national identity is mostly based on ww2 and role of ussr in it . 
  through a series of destalinizations , perestroikas and basically shitting on our history , this is like the only thing left for us . 
  in a way it all makes sense , because eastern front was not all tea and bagles , but a campaign for extermination not even remotely similar to anything western front ever saw . 
  what soviet union faced was * almost * a completely united europe , who came not to conquer , but to end the existence of slavs and get lebensraum for itself . 
  this is actually perfectly falls in line with every empire ever , since all they care about is - markets and resources . 
  think about it for a bit , india did not invaded britain ; chinese were conquered by small japan ; native americans ordeal ; dutch colonies ; spanish empire ; all of them shared the same pattern -  a leader of its time looks to expand it influence and get those 2 ** key ** things . 
  in that way modern russia do not see itself as a threat to europe , precisely because there is nothing of interest there , but russia on the other hand is like the biggest prize ever . 
  but back to ww2 and su , after the victory churchill proposed a plan to redraw maps of europe and establish spheres on influence . 
  stalin agreed and this is why when there were communist uprising in greece , he did nothing and when there were uprisings in czechoslovakia and other places , west mostly remained silent . 
  because of cold war split and a somewhat competing ideologies it was essential to keep those buffer states between mainland ussr and western world , we fought via proxies mainly . 
  people often look at things from the perspective of a modern , liberal , civilized man , but back then things like empires still existed , concentration camps or deportation were a ** normal practice ** , oppression of minorities bloomed with all colors of rainbow . 
  history is a crazy thing and if u want to understand russians a bit more , i highly suggest reading some books from russia right after revolution and what followed it , to ussr , eastern front and end of ww2 and what followed it . 
  but back to modern times , estonians might felt threatened or scared , but truth is russia is not really interested in them ; it is widely accepted by population that baltics , poles , finns are a lost cause and should be left alone ( unless they start to shit on our history or try to shake balance of regional power with things like anti missile shields etc ) . 
  baltics or poles for example get reminded that big part of their trade is with russia , only when they are being assholes , with stuff like border restrictions , swine plague bans and so on . 
  finns are mostly quiet , so almost no troubles with them . 
  ukraine also falls under this category , they are a weird bunch and when they start shitting on everything russian and treat folks like bandera a hero , gas prises rise and trade barriers are implemented , when they are chill - no problems . 
  in a mind of a russian - we almost never start any kind of shit or a mess , we just react to it and defend our interests . 
  crimea in that sense is a bit weird and something i would call an `` overstep of boundaries '' , but from geopolitical point ( historical justice for some ) of view its probably the correct move , since ukraine was already lost for at least 1 presidential cycle . 
  euromaidan initially started as a protest to eurasian union stuff , during its 3 months russia was portrayed heavily negative in ukrainian media , so in a sense people were brainwashed and pro-russian candidate could not win , then shootings happen and the probability of it went to even lower number and lastly eu/u . s brokered deal went out the window as well . 
  so , no matter who russia would get as a candidate , he had zero chance of victory , which i guess `` upset '' kremlin to say the least . 
  thus events of kicking the guy on the ground started with a potential to continue in south-eastern ukraine . 
  to be honest , after reading both ukrnet and runet i do n't think we see each other as a brothers or even a friends anymore . 
  the amount of hatred is overwhelming , everyone is an `` armchair warrior '' and while russians are mostly trolling or making fun of them ( as usually is , when you feel powerful ) , ukrainians is more up in arms and wanting to fight ( which i guess is fair , since we took crimea , but they kind a were not too fond of us even before ) . 
  overall , i expressed my concerns on reddit a couple months ago , that one of the worst things i fear could happen - would be slav on slav action . 
  back then it was elusive and highly unlikely , today i am not so optimistic anymore . 
  but i thought you sold all of them to finland ?
