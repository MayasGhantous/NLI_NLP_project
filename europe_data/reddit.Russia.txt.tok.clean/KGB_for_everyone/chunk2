   i am sure it would not be happy , but the ukraine , us , eu , osce , un , and russia all agreed to them . 
  so there certainly seems like there would be some pressure . 
  but they would have to be legal and observed , not have someone with a kalashnikov checking the ballot to make sure someone cast the `` right '' vote . 
  there was an agreement on 20th of something of february where russia was present as silent observer , document was backed by both eu and u.s , the next day yanukovych was thrown out of the office and no one bats an eye . 
  prior to this , russia made * zero * noise or any moves at all , just quietly watched anti-russian hysteria of euromaidan and people who shouted incredible amount of bullshit about russian tanks in kiev , chechens in buses and plenty of other shit , i watched live streams mostly and read what `` leaders of euromaidan '' said at the time , there was nothing good about russia there and plenty of hate speech . 
  after that you are wondering why russia might be skeptical about backing of previously mentioned international organizations/countries ? 
   i definitely agree . 
  but dont you think people would feel it was at least more fair if there was a vote and they were confident the vote was not rigged ? 
  yes it would , but you play with the cards you were dealt and hope that the other side wo n't cheat ( and they previously were caught cheating and pretending that `` its all good '' ) . 
  the fact that plenty of european and american officials traveled to sovereign country and * officially * supported euromaidan , while giving zero fucks about turkish protests ( or more recent hong kong ) forces me to read between lines and take it for whats it worth . 
  eu+u . s was interested in specific outcome , namely ukraine in europe , thus my `` spider senses are tingling '' . 
  not to say that this was 100 % orchestrated by cia yada , yada , but i do think that ngos and `` foreign aid '' + informational background backing played its role . 
  russia was lied/deceived in the past plenty of times or its interest disregarded , under whatever straw-mans or technicalities , thus i doubt that modern day russia trusts a word coming out of west mouth . 
  just a guess though . 
  i was mostly referring to pre-ukraine situation , after yanukovych/crimea i think our policies has gone off the rails and `` the ball got rolling '' ( launched by russian propaganda and ukrainians acting as retards , sorry if it offends someone its just my view on those events ) . 
  after that it snowballs and you loose control little by little , nationalism gets crazier , its harder to pull back domestically and so on . 
  even before ukraine it was `` everybody hates chris '' starring as russia in main role , after that its just non-stop carnival of russia hate train . 
  as for trade agreement , russian officials gave some vague statements on to why it would be hurting to russian economy , ( cheap ukrainian goods would undermine russian ones , because ukrainian ca n't compete with europeans when tariffs and trade barriers would be lifted , thus russia looses money and jobs ) but nothing too significant . 
  as for circumstances of eu deal , well , russia `` bribed '' as some would say , as american officials would say `` provided aid '' for ukraine , but people got upset and went on the streets , after that everything else is history with a result of `` russia 's guy '' fleeing the country and russian interest having no chance to be represented in the next ~ 5 years or so . 
  as for minsk agreements , i do n't think anyone took those seriously from any side and even if they did i doubt ukraine would simply `` let go of south-east '' if it choose to vote so . 
  there was 2 referendums , completely legal in 90s , both ignored . 
  you should also take into account domestic audience in both russia and ukraine , both are very similar in their view of `` our boys fought and spilled blood there and for what ? 
  so that politicians can make backstage deals and spit on the graves of our patriots ?! '', 
  there is plenty of bullshit from both sides , stupid decisions and `` overloading '' people 's minds with propaganda related materials , in circumstances like this referendums have dire consequences for the loosing side with possibility of civil unrest being * quite high * . 
  overall its a complicated issue with a significant domestic segment in play and we have very little of `` real info '' in what heads of state or intelligence apparatus has in store . 
  its just a general feeling that i got from reading most of western russia related articles or comments , very little context provided as to why russia and russians act in the way they did , support people they support and behave in general . 
  for me it just looks like in westerner eyes russians are just barbaric horde , who hates everything liberal on genetic level with a general conservative/reactionary/bigotry worldview and were always that way . 
  occasionally you can stumble on article or two how `` the world came to be '' so to speak , but its rarely talked about and everything else mostly is being wrapped into reddit oriented 1-2-3-4 liners of oversimplification and black & white attitude . 
  its a complicated matter overall and i doubt that subreddits comment section is a place for it * by design * . 
  the simplicity will always win over context providing , because people do n't like to read a lot ( myself included )  russia = bad , is easy to understand , has plenty of historical data/context to back that up , ** extremely widespread ** view in eastern europe and many , many other reasons why it is welcomed with open arms . 
  russia is not helping to reverse the notion either , both domestically and internationally . 
  90 % burn of the body is probably as close to hell as you can get remaining alive . 
  i am worried about my sons future and my husband well being , therefore * i will burn myself alive * . 
  that surely will help everyone involved and solve all our problems !, 
  unless she had a couple of millions of debt in her name ( in terms of mortgage , credits and so on ) and bulgaria has no inheritance of debt by family members ( or something of the sort ) , going full tibet is hardly the answer . 
  putting morals aside , you can probably make more money on black market if you sell your organs as well , to help your family financially , * but thats just fucked up on some basic level * . 
   my country top kek , 
  nah , i was mostly giving an insight into russian political field and why population perceives liberals in such negative way  its funny for me to read articles about russia going against liberalism and `` western values '' when there is literally zero mentioning anywhere in said articles what led to such state of affairs . 
  invisible hand of the market was quite a popular term from russian liberals constantly declared during 90s and early 00s as * the way to go * . 
  in russian public opinion it transformed into `` invisible hand market touches you inappropriately ( genitals and such ) '' . 
  its also one of the reason they lost quite a bit of public support after their policies were implemented and with known results putin rose to power and everything that comes with him  its funny to see how events 15-20 years ago shape current russian mindset and general public opinion in regards to those actors and what views they represent , truly a * monumental fuck up * . 
  russia-europe border is pretty big , both by land and sea , what stops them from following in their mediterranean brothers footsteps ? 
  if people can pay 1k $ for a boat to europe from lybia , surely they can afford a bribe for russian captain of ship , border guard or a random truck driver to smuggle him into eu ? 
  there are a lot of things you can do , to enter the country illegally if you really put your mind to it , but the fact that they do nothing indicates that something else here is at play ( perhaps ) . 
  a couple of old jokes from russia for you : `` how do you know know if a person have an iphone ? 
  - its easy , he will boast about it in the first 5 minutes of conversation ! '', 
  2 ) `` you buy iphone not to talk via it , but to talk * about it * ! '', 
  this is just a couple of examples , plenty more of that stuff in runet segment overall . 
  generally a status thing like in china , if you have iphone - you are a `` cool kid '' / have money . 
  hence stupid monuments and other retarded shit happening in russia , we are not exactly the sanest or smartest bunch and susceptible to marketing campaigns/propaganda , since whole capitalism , marketing and everything that comes with it is relatively new for russian consumers . 
  but what about free market , invisible hand , freedom of capital movement and business and all that capitalism stuff ? 
  money talks , right ? 
  who are we to go against the rightful hand of free market ? 
  maybeee after enough brainwashing , strong no , maaaaaaybe , somewhat of a strong no . 
  these are domestic policies in play which would not change in peoples mind in near term future . 
  there are things that i would like to see as a russian living in russia , but this has nothing to do with being european from europe . 
  maybe gradually decrease the amount of domestic ( and maybe other ) propaganda to the point where over zealous nationalism is not our `` refugee '' from reality ? 
  it would help for russia and russians to realize where exactly do they stand and perhaps tone down a bit with `` patriot '' talk and escalations of all sorts like flying bombers and whatnot . 
  there are things that r/europe would want to see i am sure of , but domestically would be a disaster or immediate radicalization of society , which is not a good thing in our current political climate . 
  not that many options * acceptable for both parties * overall , without significant consequences for one of the side ** and without looking like `` we fucking lost/sold out to the enemy '' **, 
   just like all the other journalists who work in war zones : with courage . 
  has nothing to do with the discussion , what is the actual proof that he is in fact in donetsk to be able to report anything ? 
   this is typical gay-obsessed russian frustration . 
  i do n't give a shit about anyone being gay , but what i do give a shit about is deliberate misleading campaigns engineered by 3rd parties , which has nothing to do with reality on the ground . 
  this was a clear example of piece of shit journalism during arab spring being taken for a `` face value '' by gullible people , a * clear case of manipulation and misrepresentation * . 
  people write about putinbots , they should also consider that other factions are engaged in all sorts of psyops and informational war . 
  do i need to remind you about reddit numbers from american air base or something ? 
  it was reported repeatedly and to think that nothing `` funny '' is taking place after all the snowden and nsa bullshit is beyond silly . 
   i fail to see how you 've provided convincing arguments so far why not . 
  there is a russian saying '' \u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0431\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0430 '' which roughly translates as `` one old woman said '' with everything that comes after , which describes mostly rumors and hear-says , generally an impossible to verify source of information . 
   witness testimony reporting , like journalism has been conducted for more than a hundred years . 
  who is a witness ? 
  what is his credentials ? 
  what makes you think that mr.matsuka has not made them up in his head to give his words legitimacy ? 
  in an age of disinformation , viral marketing , manipulations of data and constant propaganda campaigns , `` eyewitness report '' become a whole lot less valuable in terms of giving accurate information from the `` locals '' . 
  everyone have a phone with a camera nowadays , where is video , a picture , anything besides a couple lines on twitter ? 
  you can cover face , change voice , there are a ton of things you can do , but i am supposed to `` take your word for it '' ? 
  why ? 
  what makes you so `` trustworthy '' ? 
   that fact that things happen more than once does n't mean that somebody who is reporting it is `` repeating '' things . 
  no it is n't , but the contents of the `` news '' looks more like `` adding constant fuel to the fire '' , rather than investigative journalism or reporting from the locals . 
  there is a clear benefactor in such campaign , who has been repeatedly caught in the past doing so with all sorts of bullshit including nuclear strikes . 
  its also funny to read about coal deliveries by cargo trucks to russia when a lot of donbass mines are flooded ( not even saying anything about the economic viability of such deliveries ) or sunflower seeds in fucking november . 
  where the fuck did they found it ** in november ** is beyond me . 
   you would n't know what journalism is , unfortunately . 
  as it turns out , my ability to detect bullshit is higher than yours , but this mostly has to do with the fact that i lived all my life in russian informational field and there is plenty of bullshit here , hence i am not as gullible as people like you . 
  `` matsuka was forced to flee his home in donetsk after a slew of death threats and attempts on his life intensified with the city 's occupation by pro-russian rebels '' out of curiosity how can he report something , when judging by the info provided by cjfe he is being actively targeted and fled the place overall ? 
  this is like stories about liberal-gay woman from egypt reporting about `` crimes of the mubarak '' who later turned out to be 20 something british dude writing without pants in his apartment somewhere in britain ( i do n't remember where exactly ) . 
  i will not dispute the fact that `` humanitarian convoy '' is quite possibly being used as a front for supplies and whatnot , but this has nothing to do with this so called `` journalism '' . 
  a clearly interested party is being `` tweeting '' something with zero factual proof and simply repeating the 2-3 months old story , almost like a copy-paste . 
  again , * this is not journalism * . 
  this is wishful thinking , ukraine during euromaidan/after overthrowing yanukovych was in `` revolutionary madness '' ( meaning `` we have won and if you disagree with us i am going to beat the shit out of you/fuck you '' type of behavior ) . 
  hence all the `` language law '' proposals , leninopad , guys like muzychko and other pieces of shit got their 15 mins of glory . 
  for them it was a done deal and they were `` almost there '' , then russia made its move with crimea ( * using * the situation of chaos and madness in kiev + inability of army to do pretty much anything ) and later down the line other more predictable steps . 
  to answer the question whether it was a viable option to `` submit to putin '' would be ** no ** , media is controlled by oligarchs or people like them and in ukrainian political/informational field european orientation was an obvious choice . 
  it would be basically a `` betrayal of principles of euromaidan '' in their eyes or `` what were our boys and girls were dieing for and protesting for ? 
  '' , if someone voices a concern about role of russia at the time he was a `` traitor/non-patriot/colorado bug/fsb agent '' . 
  * i am not sure * , but i think conditions of imf loans was `` territorial integrity '' or something like that ( perhaps forcing them into war in south-east , but again i 'm not 100 % sure and too lazy to check it or wonder about `` secret '' parts ) . 
  generally speaking after overthrowing yanukovych there was no turning back for them , they made a choice and majority silently , or not so much , agreed with them . 
  after that its history and everyone involved will be paying the bill for it , be it ukraine , european union or russia .
