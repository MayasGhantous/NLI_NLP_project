  hmmm ... dis is suspicious . 
  puuutiiin , some weird dudes with german accents are conspiring again !, 
  save us , our glorious leader and protector of oppressed minorities !, 
  well if you are asking will putin start invading baltics , poles or finns , the answer is - no . 
  he is not crazy and there is no sentiment for `` helping out '' those countries , they are independent and no one really cares about them . 
  as of his goals , well he essentially control the media as of late , so he creates this goals in a sense . 
  public opinion is usually formed by the media , will he use nationalist feelings to further consolidate his power ? 
  of course !, 
  will he declare holy war against west and go yolo ? 
  putin 's main interest is his own survival i guess , so in a sense of self preservation he would continue to defend russian interests around the world . 
  what they include ? 
  good question . 
  in a way russia might become more like authoritarian china with `` great russia firewall '' , far less cooperation with west on any issues and `` a bit '' chilly relations , but a lot of it would depend on sanctions for this and possible further incidents . 
  lastly , i d say that russia feels extremely sensitive whenever there are u.s intrusions , meddling in russian sphere of influence/interest and thus russia projects similar attitude toward eu ( caz they follow the suit ) . 
  its a combination of things as in every thing , nostalgia for former glory , desire to be someone on international stage , a convenient distraction from modern day problems and many , many other things . 
  russia does not exactly enjoyed fall of the soviet union , ( open wiki and read up about stuff like shock therapy , life expectancy , drugs , alcohol consumption ) so the time when russians think that `` historical injustice/unfairness '' was fixed as in crimea , they felt proud . 
  now , this is a bit of a stretch , but after the fall of the soviet union russia probably felt ( and to a certain extent was ) treated like weimar republic and russians never forget , so there 's that . 
  but most of this stuff is bitterness and if i would take a guess , closest thing would be british empire loosing its empire status something like this : http://countryballs.net/news/nobody_can_stop_the_great_british_empire/2014-03-11-233 however , it does not change the fact that due to russia constantly feel being threatened or treated unjustly ( lies about no fly zones , nato creeping toward eastern borders , missile defend shields , whole ordeal with ukraine , colorful revolutions and others ) and a serious lack of desire to improve things domestically ( think soviet union minus social aspect of it due to corruption , oligarchs , poor management ) the possibility of other `` incidents '' is there . 
  possible nearest places are south-eastern ukraine and transnistria region of moldova ( but this is already widely covered in the media , so nothing new here ) . 
  a lot of things would depend on how eu/russia/u . s relations would develop , if west will keep on pushing into russian sphere of interest , russia will probably change the way it acts on international stage and be far less cooperative or understanding . 
  nothing is set in stone though , things are constantly changing and new stuff happen , but the potential for cold war 2 is there . 
  weird , from what i have read from russian history books , russian empire took you from sweden rule and given a lot of rights and autonomy type of things , also the fact that finnish nationalism formed under russian rule etc. 
  our lowest point was a winter war which was from soviet perspective to protect st.petersburg , but after ww2 no one touched you and afaik you benefited from trade with soviet/russia lately a lot . 
  do n't worry comrade , soon new wave of sanctions would hit and your economy would go down the drain . 
  plenty of material for complaining , 
  give back sochi gold assholes !, 
  well , judging by the article a big chunk of them come from syria , libya and other arab spring countries . 
  there is a certain pattern there - you arm and supply some guys , bomb others , finance coups for thirds and shit gets bad . 
  i get that majority of it is not european union doing ( though judging by syria and libya cases , some of you were more trigger happy than others ) , but maybe you should talk with your `` key partner '' . 
  you ca n't stop people from searching for a better life , but overwhelming majority of them would not moved in the first place , if things would be ok ` ish back home . 
  as a food for thought , imagine china economically collapsing and what wave of migration it would trigger ... 
  scary perspective , esp for us . 
  looks like a drunken russian banter . 
  although judging by wave of `` patriotism '' with regards to recent events in runet , it makes you wonder about grandeur delusion of our citizens and `` elites '' . 
  i guess this is how ` murica felt after 9/11 - `` we are gon na show those goddamn bastards !!! '', 
  i thought europe and a place-you-should-not-name were kind a interconnected , but ok , sry , my bad . 
  is to keep kebab migrants away , poland you are of genius !, 
  til defending russian interests right on our doorstep is becoming too strong . 
  hooray , i guess : /, 
  can you pinpoint exactly where am i ** factually ** wrong ? 
  no emotions , just events and acting bodies - where did i lied ? 
  russian media went downhill from early 2000s and up until recently there were still places like lenta , livejournal , echo of moscow etc , now they are blocked or silenced . 
  i never denied any of that , but this does not change the fact that whenever there is a `` consensus '' in west - everyone repeats the same shit over and over again , like a parrot , now russian media is up to your standards - journalism is dead , repeating official version of events is the way to go . 
  turkey never ** got ** any coverage even before crimea shitstorm , you can not deny the fact that european and united states officials went to the capital of foreign nation and actively encouraged protesters to fight against regime , while covertly supporting them through shadows . 
  where are the same actions in stambul , since you guys are so concerned about human rights and fighting corrupted and unlawful , oppressive regimes ? 
  coming from u.s this is rich . 
  you guys never really stopped with whole `` covert and not-so regime changes '' do you ? 
  list is just keep on growing with every year and your hand is seen everywhere throughout latin america , middle east and as of lately right on our doorstep - georgia , ukraine , kyrgyzstan . 
  when guys like pierre omidyar finances euromaidan , the possibility of such actions not being approved by washington/state department is close to zero , i am sure that in a not so distant future he will be handsomely rewarded with either `` a surprisingly successful venture '' or `` got really lucky on stock market '' . 
  i would guess that he is just one of many other `` shadow bankers '' . 
  i never defended yanukovych actions , i think he is a weak politician and a shitty horse to bet on , but if it would be any other guy i am sure russia would exert the same amount of pressure and negotiated same deal with a different guy . 
  you say about turkish protests got a shit load of coverage , but judging by reddit or front pages of cnn and nbc i see a lot of crimea , ukraine and russia and almost nothing on turkey . 
  i do not hear about european officials going to center of stambul and declaring their support in their fight against `` terrible oppressive regime '' , i do not see any u.s congressman or folks from state department either . 
  strange , is n't it ? 
  whats coming out of lenta nowadays is a state approved point of view , just like in enlightened west !, 
  we now big boys with full control of media and state approved propaganda to brainwash people , just like you . 
  its a bit sad , but i guess crushing dissent is a way to go in a modern world ( from nsa with love ) . 
  its true that you did not invaded those countries , you just slowly but surely installed nato bases closer to russia with each year , pursuing your very own concept of encirclement and containment . 
  you did however bombed the shit out of serbs and recognized kosovo , thus creating a precedent . 
  you kind a did financed revolution of roses in georgia and later equipped , trained and supplied georgian military and u knew what they had in mind , you just wanted to look how russia will react , look at combat readiness and all that nice `` raw data '' that you love so much . 
  distracting world from chinese olympics was just a nice bonus . 
  there were all those other things like a magical transformation of `` non fly zone '' into `` lets bomb the shit out of kaddafi '' , the unilateral exit in anti ballistic missile shield thing and many , many , many other wonderful things . 
  i am sure people on the streets of crimea and sevastopol who celebrated their independence from kiev were all held at a gunpoint and forced by evil russkies . 
  the larger picture includes the fact that european union and united states actively participated in undermining yanukovych 's regime , expressed all kinds of support and financed euromaidan to a certain extent . 
  also provided `` informational support '' , meaning formed public opinion in a certain way through propaganda . 
  i can guess for kremlin 's perspective things look exactly like orange revolution of 2004 , which is widely accepted as organized and financed by the west . 
  may i remind you , yanukovych won those elections and was pro-russia back then , but he was changed for yushenko who was openly anti-russian . 
  this time when the eu did not got the deal it wanted , similar things happen . 
  russia lost ukraine first when people started to die from fire-arms ( there is no international led investigation in that matter and if someone would kill 100 people , i would like to know who did it , how he did it and why ) . 
  second time russia lost ukraine the next day , when deal brokered by both eu + us and opposition went out the window and u guys immediately supported `` new reality '' . 
  crimea is just damage control and only a 1st chapter in a battle for ukraine . 
  you guys are hypocrites and the fact that turkish protest movement has no media coverage , no u.s senator or ambassador , no eu official visiting there and expressing their support in a fight against `` bad , corrupt regime '' speaks for itself . 
  you had undeniable interests in ukraine , you played dirty when you could get what you want , now it * will * get ugly for everyone . 
  in regards to spain , greek problem basically what you are saying that things will get better in time , i look at timeline of 5 years and things only get worse , but whatever , let 's pretend that they can someday pay their debt or magically create several million jobs without creating even more bubbles or debt . 
  in regards to cyprus , how is it exactly different from any tax havens really ? 
  luxembourg , all the british isles and other microstates . 
  also , who the fuck told cypriot banks that it is safe and okay to buy greek bonds , who encouraged them ? 
  was it not europe ? 
  they do have sun and sea , so they 'll manage somehow probably , but what exactly of value mobile games produce ? 
  an app made by 10 people which you can sold for couple millions if you are really lucky ? 
  you do realize that this is entertainment and non-essential life expenses and you ca n't base your economy on that . 
  the smaller the country , the easier it is to rebalance economy , but bigger countries ca n't be that quick to react or restructure , because they are * big * . 
  my joke about how russia 's fuel cost is formed is just an indication of what there is plenty in the world already - monopolies and cartel agreement . 
  this is really simple again , there is no need in competition when exxon , royal dutch shell and bp can gather and set a price they want . 
  human history shows time and time again , if market is being `` let go '' , it goes ** full retard ** and creates shit like 2008 global clusterfuck , destroys any sort of meaningful regulation or safety measures designed to protect people and by the way , they control the media as well , so if something would be discovered - firstly they will call you a conspiritard , then will deny everything and in the end everyone will say that they already knew . 
  it is truly sad when one by one conspiracy theories are being proven as true and no one gives a shit , ** zero ** consequences . 
  in regards to growth , sooo , this growth you are talking about is backed up by a strong and solid economies , and not credit bubbles and debt , right ? 
  caz if they are , well , our future is not so bright . 
  eu gdp growth in 2013 was something like zero ??? 
   in global markets commodities have the same price everywhere and for everybody . 
  in this day and age , you do n't have to own or control a resource , what you need to have is something to trade with it , and that is what europe has lots of . 
  in case of russian gas and oil , they are priced by the global markets , they are not cheap for europeans , they do n't bring any competitive advantage to european industries . 
  if in case of trade war between russia and eu , europe would buy its oil from global markets with global prices . 
  are we talking here about an immediate trade war or possible trade war in near future , where resources would be lets say `` harder to get '' ? 
  there are also things like transportation costs , extraction costs , labor costs , reliability of shipments , infrastructure costs . 
  let 's be real here , europe imports russian resources not because they love us so much , but because its financially best option for them and other options ( including shit like renewables ) is simply more expensive . 
  you can start going full wind/geo thermal/solar , buy raw materials from africa ( where you will meet china 's needs and demands ) and transport it via ships , but this will simply cost you more , ** otherwise you would already be doing that ** . 
  i believe i * did answered * about russia 's perceived threat by providing ** historical data ** who attacks who and why the do it . 
  read my post about empires , markets and access to resources . 
  there is nothing of interest for russia in europe that we can not already buy or have and we * do * have other sources to buy equipment , cars and agricultural stuff .
