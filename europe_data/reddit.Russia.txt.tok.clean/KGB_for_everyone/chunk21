  europe * can * buy their energy and materials from others , but cost of their manufacturing would increase significantly and cost of life will rise as well . 
  thus we will both hurt each other , while our competitors in the face of u.s and china will strenghten their position . 
  unfortunately i am not a guy from kremlin or smtn , so i can only provide my armchair opinion that russia will simply go full nuclear retard and deploy lots and lots of nukes . 
  lastly , no doubt that imf reforms are needed in ukraine , since they have n't done shit in 20 years , what i am saying is `` how will the general population react to a decline in lifestyle ? '', 
  and `` what makes you think that russia will not use turmoil caused by harsh economic conditions to further destabilize ukraine and annex eastern parts of it ? '' . 
  i mean really , government in kiev is already almost as anti-russian as it gets , why would russia stop in its quest to secure its interest and move borders away ? 
  putin did mentioned not so long ago , that `` we did not started this '' . 
  if ukraine hates russia so much , i highly doubt that kremlin will think about brotherly feelings or support them economically , they screamed about `` hand of moscow '' for couple of months without any proof , now they might as well see it . 
  but this is just speculations of what might be happen sometime in the future , in the end russia again ** reacts ** to outside intrusion from eu and u.s. 
   i would like to add that thanks to russian invasion to crimea regardless do the locals want it or not will make the eu to speed up its efforts to form a unified european army . 
  if russia would invade eastern ukraine , this would even further make this transformation more hasty ...  have you ever wondered how would you feel if you would have a neighbor with 500 million inhabitants and who is economically and technologically superior to you and that has armed forces triple the size of yours , and who shares the same border from black sea to barents sea ? 
  i already expressed my concerns about consequences of russia 's actions in crimea in other threads , i do think that our actions will have bigger impact than some asset freezes and visa bans and bigger european military is one of them . 
  but when such things would materialize , russia will probably leave anti-nuclear treaties and just deploy several thousand nukes as a deterrent . 
  cheap and cost effective solution . 
   the idea to this date has been that by integrating economies and enabling russians to do business in the west , it will in long term liberalize the russian economy and society , thus enabling it to transform to a modern democratic state . 
  unfortunately it seems that this idea has been largely wrong in the case of russian political elite . 
  however the thing is that declaring a cold war against russian political elite would also hurt ordinary russians so that is n't something that should and would lightly chosen as a policy . 
  this does not change the fact that west ** systematically ** attacked russia 's interest around the globe and was more than happy to hoard dirty russian money , stolen from local population . 
  in fact , there was no effort whatsoever from western elites to address this issue , thus i am skeptical that policy makers from eu or u.s give a shit about poor local population . 
  i can probably name a dozen of events when u chose to look the other way for the sake of profit or gaining influence , one of my favorite is comments about afghanistan opium 40x times increase in production since invasion - `` but this is their only source of income ! '' . 
  fucking love it . 
   i have many friends that come from eastern european countries and they all think that eu has done lots of good for their countries : and this is very understandable as eu is funding everything from motorways to culture , not to mention that due to eu citizens from these countries have had the ability to move all over eu . 
  not to mention that some people , especially romanians see the eu as the only force to repair their countries as their political elite is so corrupted that without outside help no change will ever happen . 
   now if you talked about countries such as portugal , spain , greece and cyprus , these countries are in trouble because they had an economic bubble , however the thing is that without the eu and without eu funds , they would be lot more poorer than they now are . 
  spain for example was almost going to become a net payer thanks to decades of eu funds to help the spanish to build their economy . 
  all this is fantastic and i am sure a lot of people benefited from eu up until they became financially insolvent , but this does not refute my point that spainiards , greeks , portuguese or cypriots are fucked . 
  this is not complicated , they joined eu , got rid of any production stuff and decided to make `` service '' economy with tourism , house bubbles and shit like that . 
  then they naturally collapsed and are unable to recover at all , year after year they show record number unemployment , vacant homes , immigration numbers are through the roof , debt is skyrocketing . 
  you know that , i know that , they know that . 
  what european union offered them as solution does not seem to work , in fact it looks like it make things worse ( and i am not even commenting on terms of bailouts , role of european banks and their exposure ) . 
   lots of work has been moved or outsourced to eastern european countries where it has taken the place of old industries that were not and would never have been competitive in global market . 
   in my honest opinion the only way to build competitive economy is to face global markets from the day one without subsidies . 
  domestic companies either handle it or not , if they are replaced by foreign companies that has largely happened in retailing and banking , then that is positive development as those foreign entities have been more competitive and thus been able to offer better services for the rest of the economy . 
  again , this model is beneficial to someone who is already stronk and will only make them stronger . 
  rich get richer type of thing . 
  jobs are being created , no doubt about that , but profits are leaving countries and leave a miniscule impact on local economies . 
  and if suddenly this `` trickle down economics '' cease to exist ( as we 've seen on cyprus for example ) , local population is left with what is called `` naked ass '' . 
  good luck surviving without any kind of competitive global product + outstanding debt . 
   the answer is again let the market do their job . 
  if people do n't have skills that are in demand or the investment environment friendly enough then their wages have to go down until equilibrium is achieved . 
  in case of russia foreign companies would gladly invest into russia if the business environment and especially the government was more stable and less corrupt . 
  for example many finnish pulp and paper companies have tried to invest to russia , but due to erratic local government officials , they have deemed it too risky thus preferring to invest in southern america . 
  do note that if you are going to build a pulp or paper mill , the company doing the investments needs to be sure on what is going to happen in the next 20-30 years and be sure that nothing jeopardizes their investment . 
  i get that you are `` let the market do its thing '' and `` invisible hand of the market '' type of guy , i am unfortunately not as optimistic . 
  in russia free market capitalism means increase of prices every year by a random number ( it used to be double digits ) , just because we can and we are in monopoly/cartel agreement . 
  the old joke of - prices on oil has raised , so we must raise prises on fuel as well !, 
  prices on oil has declined , so we must raise prices on fuel to compensate loss of profit !, 
  prices on oil has not changed , we must raise prices because `` insert any random reason '' . 
  but thats not the point here , what i 've personally witnessed throughout years is that workers on a global scale loose their rights on a yearly basis . 
  people loose their jobs and no one gives a shit about them , because they either outsource their job to china/india/sea or simply buy a legal `` slave '' in form of gasterbaiter who will work for 1/5 , 1/10th of wages . 
  this is very good for corporations as charts show , i am sure you saw a couple of them with corporate profits being at all times high . 
  for common folk working for a minimum wage , with no social benefits or vacation does not sound like a fantastic career opportunity though . 
  what i am afraid of , is that eventually we will go back to early xx century work environment which was pretty close to slavery and there is enough evidence that we are slowly , but surely walking in that direction . 
  i 'm not gon na defend russian laws and policies , caz they are truly retarded , but the idea that south america is gon na be stable for 20-30 years is lil bit funny   have you ever thought that europeans regard russia as a loaded gun against it ? 
  for example when russia and us had dispute about us missile defense system , what happened was that russia located short range nuclear missiles to kaliningrad that are pinpointed towards europe . 
  not to mention that russia has a huge nuclear arsenal multiple times bigger than european states together have . 
  russia is the loaded gun for europeans , that is why eastern european countries joined the nato and eu , and that is why ukraine is also going to join both organizations . 
  your example is historically inaccurate unfortunately . 
  almost entire human history indicates that it is in fact industrial , advanced nations who go for a land and resources grab , not the other way around . 
  india did not conquered british empire and pillaged it for centuries , china did not attacked tiny japan or sea , germany , united states , french empire . 
  advanced nations need two things - ** resources ** and ** markets to sell their shit ** . 
  modern europe is useless in that regard , you do n't have anything of interest to russia that we can not already simply buy ( either from you or china/u . s ) . 
  the only reason why certain parts might become relevant is if big war was incoming , thus buffer states would be of utmost importance . 
  but back to resources , europe needs energy and raw materials ( to compete with china and u.s ) . 
  there are a number of places in the world , where you can get them . 
  in south america you will meet united states in all its might and c.i.a activity , coups , economical pressure and to a lesser extent china ; in africa china is already a big player , they will increase their presence there as well ; middle east is unstable as always and they lack in certain aspects ; and then there is russia who provides you with cheap shit , which kind a helps to compete with both u.s and china + a big market for your stuff . 
  now imagine there is a trade war between eu and russia , how do you think it will affect european competitiveness ? 
  imagine that china would get even cheaper energy and resources , thus making their products even cheaper ? 
  lastly , about missile shield and russian nukes , there is this thing in logic - cause and consequence . 
  its really simple , united states decided unilaterally to quit some treaty about anti-ballistic stuff and put their missiles in poland/czezh republic , russia tried to negotiate , relocate , get some guarantees of non-hostility towards russia , we got the middle finger . 
  as a response russia deployed iskander . 
  again , russia ** reacted ** , not caused this shitstorm . 
  my point about ukraine in nato remains , russia will invade and occupy eastern part for sure if such event to occur , western and central parts are questionable . 
  we shall see when imf reforms will hit general population to the amount of unrest in south-eastern part of ukraine . 
  well , for starters you are alive and was born , you might like read about ww2 a little and what was planned for polish state . 
  we kind a stopped full implementation of this thing http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost that counts for something , is n't it ? 
  there was this other guy napoleon who wanted to conquer the world as well , well it 's unclear what he had in store for everyone , but i doubt that he would put polish ( although poland aligned itself with the guy , because it was partitioned before ) or russian interests before french . 
  poles might hate russia with passion , but you are pretty much a ethnically homogenous ( ? ), 
  society , meaning you do n't really have any troubles with minorities . 
  i also think that because poland was so long under russian rule and wanted to break free etc , your elites actually care about your country and its future and judging by how poland treads on world stage your hatred for russia and desire to prove the world that poland is stronk helps you implement correct measures and not become a third world country . 
  poland was also rebuilt after war and all the things that come with it - schools , hospitals , roads , houses etc. 
  then there are things like famous russian poets , scientists , into space guys and other folks ... russia did plenty of fucked up stuff to poland throughout history , but you guys are not exactly angels either . 
  there was plenty of bad blood between both states and punch exchanges , unfortunately for poland , you managed to piss off pretty much everyone around you and generally lack friends or allies -  so you had a sad history as a result . 
  russia is the worst thing that has ever happened to * poland * ftfy, 
  alternatively , the other side of the coin is that poland was notoriously bad when it comes to friends and pretty much pissed off everyone around them to a certain degree + polish opportunism resulted in poland being fucked up by other big nations over and over and over again . 
  you guys never learn : /, 
  different countries , different strategic value etc. 
  only in fairy-tales every one is equal and just as important , in real world , no one really cares about somalia , but saudi arabia or egypt is a key player in regional power balance . 
  georgia was already a safe house for chechens during 2 campaigns and acted not exactly friendly even before `` revolution of roses '' , after that they went full retard with known results . 
  you can debate georgias role and speculate if they were a `` probe '' , test of grounds for red line and where russia exactly stands , caz previously russia was loosing its sphere of influence one by one , without any kind of fight . 
  circumstances of conflict also varied ( there was this fight for independence 20 years ago from south ossetia and abkhazia ) and i d say russia 's actions in regards to georgia were justified to a bigger extent , than what we are doing in crimea right now . 
  this is not about invading someone per se , this is about putting a gun next to someones head and watching how they react . 
  when it comes to nato i imagine a polite , smiling senior gentleman who have kind eyes , somewhat clumsy of a walk , maybe even a cane with a hand behind his back , but he is making his little steps towards you with every year , he continues to smile and speak about human rights , express his concern about your state of affairs and all the other small talk . 
  unfortunately , he still has a gun behind his back and very much would like to put it next to your head . 
  that gentleman may never pull the trigger or load the gun , but the threat to live like that is enough in itself , which is why i expressed my concern about ukraine in nato and what will happen if such event would occur . 
  you can check my recent history if you want , i explained how i see what west represents and how some russians feel about it . 
  geopolitics are always complicated and there is at least 2 sides with varying agenda and different worldviews . 
  as a final accord , id like to note that nato is u.s led alliance and their agenda not necessarily pursues european union interests . 
  europe is not completely free from u.s influence either ( see recent snowden affair , landing of bolivian president plane etc ) . 
  if you were to check my comment history , you would see that i actually critisize putin and not exactly understand why we act in such manner when it comes to ukraine .
