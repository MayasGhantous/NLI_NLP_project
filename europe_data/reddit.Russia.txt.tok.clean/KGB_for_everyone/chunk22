  i lack in terms of lies , because i would like to hear an explanation from native ukrainian from shit i see on the internet , because the way i see it , this is a very dangerous game with potentially grave consequences . 
  whenever i tuned in into maidan streams from espresso and such , i constantly heard about `` russian spetsnaz , chechen omon , hand of moscow '' and so on ( maybe i was that unlucky , i do n't know ) . 
  all of this i consider as propaganda campaign with a goal to unite/legitimaze protest movement against a common enemy -  blame the other guy for your and your countries failures is the way to go ( same can be said about russia ) . 
  what u basically saying is , i am not gon na explain why people in mask are beating the shit out of someone on the streets , i will ignore a dude with an ak in a meeting and pretend that all is well , and right sector activists ( this is mvd of ukraine speaking , not me ) who killed 2 people and hurt others did nothing wrong . 
  this is a remarkable example of wishful ignorance , to say the least . 
  the fact that you consider everyone who is not agreeing with your opinion as kremlin shills is disturbing and if your compatriots share that feeling , the awakening might be sudden and unpleasant . 
  personally i do n't think that ukraine suddenly became banderovets paradise , but desire to `` close eyes '' on such elements , their role and increasing influence is disturbing . 
  this might end in tears for both parties , which is what i would like to avoid by all means . 
  i do n't know enough about romania 's role apart from being supply base and a significant manpower in ww2 . 
  i would guess a number of complicated reason and geopolitical situation + part of molotov-ribbentrop pact about bessarabia ? 
  but your ally germany has given green light to ussr and later same ally gave something to hungary ( transylvania i think or smtn ? ) . 
  regardless , my point of extermination campaign remains , this is not exactly retaking what was lost , this is participation in genocide , submission to slavery etc. 
  who the fuck is this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsj2vv3jfcq i saw that video after yanukovych was deposed etc i am sure you saw video about a guy called muzichko or smtn with an ak . 
  have you read about kharkiv or donetsk i do n't remember exactly , where right sector activists killed 2 people ? 
  this is like the first things that come to mind , i am sure there is more , but whatever . 
  what i find funny , is that russian forces in crimea are illegitimate , occupying bastards and guys like this are important partners , who is concerned about future of ukraine and whatnot . 
  do n't close your eyes on radical elements of your protest movement or you will pay the same price egypt did with muslim brotherhood . 
  you may argue that : `` but we are different !, 
  '' , well , guess what , egyptian liberals thought so too , in the end they had what they had . 
  organized people with vertical of power , military style chain of command and defined goals usually succeed more than people `` who are for everything good , against everything bad '' . 
  i assume you followed euromaidan from the start , would you deny that euromaidan/euromaidanpr twitter accounts and links provided to ukrainians media outlets was anti-russian in their origin ? 
  by anti-russian i mean a daily reminder how : `` evil russia is coming for you ! '', 
  yeah we do have all that and if we someday by some miracle stop being retarded , our model can not be replicated exactly because we have everything . 
  not sure about conquering stuff , last time europeans tried to , they came under a united banner with a desire to exterminate and enslave , you guys participated btw  i have my doubts about `` we are here for the good of your people and totally not to loot , plunder and rape you '' . 
  but hey , optimism is a good quality !, 
  well , there was this * elected * president of ukraine , he chose russian deal , we all know what happened next . 
  now he is no longer available and democratic and lawful europe is ready to sign official deal with what technically is a violent coup . 
  ukraine does not have an elected president right now , their parliament is heavily influenced by armed people in masks with questionable background , but none of this concerns anyone and westerners are more than happy to give ukraine loans , recognition and support . 
  i also would like to remind that initial euromaidan goal was - `` away from russia , towards europe ! '' . 
  this is not exactly a scenario in which 2 people calls for cat `` kitty , kitty , kitty '' , this is all sorts of cheating and tricks . 
  p.s : if you think i protect yanukovych or defend russian actions , you are wrong . 
  if yanukovych was not such a piece of shit things would be different , but russia has a tendency to bet on a wrong horse when it comes to ukraine . 
  war is good for business though , coming from u.s you should know better about capabilities of military industrial complex . 
  if european union and united states truly did not wanted any of that , then they would not sent their officials on maidan , ( senators , ministers , influential officials ) stopped or prohibited financing of ngo 's and stuff ( when pierre omidyar sends money to ukraine , i give you 99.9 percent that it was discussed before in state department/washington ) . 
  read about roles of western ngos in arab spring , colorful revolutions in early 2000s and so on . 
  evidence is there and there is plenty , hell , even state department recently made a report that they spent 5 billion dollars on `` democratization '' of ukraine . 
  if this is not meddling , i do n't know what is . 
  i am indifferent towards european union , i do not think its some devil incarnate nor a heaven for everyone . 
  i do think however , that if you are weak economically and lack vision and desire to improve your country , you might get the rough end of the stick the same way some countries already had a pleasure to experience . 
  ask their citizens if they see future in their respective countries or any prospects of improvement , ask if european union has answers or methods to improve situation there and not leave people to poverty or immigration . 
  business opportunities are fantastic , but * starting conditions * are different ( think civ 5 if u played it ) . 
  germany ** is ** strong and it is very hard to compete with them on pretty much anything that they produce with their several centuries old industrial school/tradition ( i am not blaming them , their work ethic is admirable ) . 
  other countries has other strengths , so if you open your market for their products , you can expect for local production to go under . 
  you know what comes next , so if you do not have a plan how to employ millions , perhaps you d better get one first , then execute this plan and theeen join political and economical unions from position of strength , not as banana republic . 
  this is not unique problem but a global one and russia has plenty of outright shitty or useless jobs who are not competitive or has any chances on global market ( i 'm looking at you avtovaz ) . 
  there is ** a lot ** of incoming unemployment to be experienced with automation of previous workforces alone , ( if you add here competitiveness and possible crisis its even worse ) this people need a job . 
  what kind of job ? 
  how do you teach millions ? 
  what will be needed in several years ? 
  how much do you pay ? 
  who will do all of that ? 
  where do you get money for this ? 
  there are other issues , but this is my view on what is european union and what awaits us in the future . 
  now on to what i consider evil and hostile to russia and russian interests , which is nato , led by united states of democracy . 
  having lived my whole life in russia and russian information field , i saw over and over again how we were tricked , lied to , condemned , ignored or spat on . 
  what you might see as separate events non connected to each other , i see as a continuing efforts to undermine russian interests or concerns . 
  you and i can be as friendly and peace loving to each other , respect each other and wish for us the best , but this means jack shit when it comes to policymakers . 
  i look at western actions and see a continuation of cold war era policies , with an end goal to put a gun next to russia 's head ( maybe there is more , i do n't know ) . 
  open map of europe , look at ukraine and realize that ukraine in nato is a gun next to russia 's head , or since you are finnish , a knife next to throat . 
  now , how do you like to live with such prospects ? 
  in places where russia has no interests , it does not obstruct anyone - frenchies wanted to `` help out '' mali ? 
  be our guest !, 
  central african republic genocide ? 
  no problem , send your boys !, 
  weapons of mass destruction in iraq ? 
  hey , guys , maybe you like should n't do this stuff , there is no proof of this and it might turn bad ... no ? 
  mkay , do your thing i guess . 
  terrorists bombed on 9/11 ? 
  here is some intel on afghanistan , we wo n't get in your way . 
  iran is developing nukes and you sanction and embargo them ? 
  ok , we 'll play along . 
  list goes on and on . 
  but when russia defends its interest , its the fucking lucifer walking on earth . 
  worst country eu , burn the witch , dirty commies , warmongering assholes !, 
  this is amazing to watch from russian perspective . 
  and now to last thing which i hate the most about western world - unreal , outstanding , infinite ** hypocrisy ** . 
  i fucking `` love '' reading western media outlets or politicians , when they start to talk about corruption , or how russia is bad because : `` insert here '' . 
  `` russia is the most corrupted country ever !, 
  russian people suffer so much and its such a shame what they must endure '' --  psssst , if you are like oligarch or government official who stole billions , you can totally buy our super expensive property , million dollar watches and yachts and park your illegal money in our banks and tax havens . 
  no questions asked , we are sure everything is in accordance to law . 
  we might remember some time later if it is convenient for us that you have accounts and stuff here , so we can freeze this shit and show that we are with da people though !, 
  examples are plenty and then some , but about russian eu membership , again i am not a policymaker , i am just a dude who likes to read about stuff and sometimes i comment on things . 
  my opinion is irrelevant in that respect , if russia is to join eu , i would prefer we do it smart and with some kind of vision , not for the sake of it and hope for the best . 
  sorry for wall of text . 
  very simple , here is what western elites say to each other : `` this is a historic opportunity to take ukraine away from russian influence . 
  no matter the cost , we must achieve this goal and do everything we can ! '', 
  ironically , the exact same reasoning would be used by russia to occupy entirety of ukraine ( not sure about western part though ) , when they decide to join nato . 
  such move would be met with overwhelming support from russian population , thus second cold war will begun . 
  it reminds me both pre ww1 europe and weimar republic . 
  shhhh , little hungary , soon the nightmare will be over and once again you will be a part of glorious russian empire  fear not comrade , we will liberate you from capitalist pig-dog western devils and hug you as close as possible :p, 
  well , yanukovych * is * a piece of shit corrupted politician who did not even tried to hide anything . 
  there is no fucking way i 'm gon na defend him and he did fucked up ukraine beyond all recognition , but this is not about that . 
  its about how the people * feel * they are being represented in kiev or if they were being heard at all . 
  people ** need ** to feel that their opinion is important , taken into account or at least being listen to . 
  people also need to feel like they are being represented by someone , that someone protects their interests , their desires , their aspirations ; kiev did a pretty shitty job at addressing those issues ( if not outright ignored them ) . 
  become a parrot and repeat every day in media how you value their opinion , how you will respect their choice , how you want for all of ukraine to succeed and then * maybe * you will have a chance to preserve united ukraine . 
  i * hope * that there is still a chance for deescalation and i do believe that moscow would settle at crimea if ukraine would declare ( and sign some documents ) that it will not join nato or try to seriously hurt russian interest . 
  but as of now , russia will continue undermining ukrainian sovereignty , attack current kiev administration and show `` real moscow influence '' for further disintegration of ukraine . 
  correct move is not to play though , the more euromaidan sends its activists and tries to confront pro-russian ( or anti-maidan ) forces even with peaceful protests , the bigger the animosity towards them will grow . 
  it is pretty simple i think , you threw out `` their guy '' in a somewhat of a divided country , made a bunch of really stupid moves or statements and propagated desire to ban their representatives , they will pay you the same coin .
