  denounce kiev as illegitimate , accuse you of being banderovets and a western whore and so on . 
  if turchinov and rada would stop the whole let 's arrest their mayors thing , appoint oligarchs as governors etc. 
  and simply declare to them in a diplomatic fashion `` we value and respect your opinion and understand your concerns , so lets all work together for the future of ukraine and listen to the will of ** all ** ukrainians on 25th of may '' there would be no casus belli for escalation . 
  ** the more you try to impose your view on others , who not necessarily share it , the bigger the divide you will get ** . 
  just random thoughts . 
  something like this , im lazy http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1z9j57/putin_ask_for_authorization_to_send_russian/cfrw0xh also , if russians are rioting , heads roll and governments shatter . 
  we are not exactly easy to get going , but when we do , boy , hold on to your horses , you are in for a wild ride . 
  i know how internet works  for every ban there is a work around , no worries . 
  i 'm more interested what awaits ukraine and russia when we `` will move in to restore constitutional order '' , this is a bit `` wild '' for my taste . 
  hmmmm , a series of bans on echo , ej , kasparov and some other sites ... 
  i 'll take a wild guess for a 1000 and say this is a crushing of dissent before full scale invasion in ukraine . 
  i wonder if they would block reddit as well  :| :(, 
  1 ) leninopad + kutuzov + soldier monument . 
  2 ) law about languages ( regardless if it later was vetoed by president , the vector of legislature without a proposed alternative is beyond retarded and outright hostile ) . 
  there is a reason why even people from lviv considered this stupid and short sighted . 
  3 ) a lot of general posturing and anti-russian statements about `` removing russia from premises '' ( ending base renting agreements and whatnot ) . 
  what u see as a number of silly mistakes , kremlin might view ( ** and use ** ) as a confirmation of anti-russian nature of protests and outright hostility to both russians and pro-russian speaking population . 
  i 'm not defending russia 's actions or what i consider as putin 's dangerous * opportunism * ( or kicking the guy on the floor ) , but i do hope that kiev will tread more carefully , otherwise we might see round 2 . 
  of course !, 
  russian media is shit and blatant propaganda with a target audience of pensioners etc. 
  there was ( and still is ) an ongoing propaganda war around the ukraine . 
  the amount of bullshit or blatant disinformation was ( is ) astounding , fake videos , ninja-edits , cutting things out of context , you name it , ukraine had it all . 
  out of curiosity i followed euromaidan/euromaidanpr twitters and links provided to opposition sites , almost daily there were speculations , accusations , blatant lies with a general notion of `` evil russia is coming for you ! '' . 
  same can be said about euromaidan stage . 
  now , if you shit in people 's head for several months in a row , regardless how big of a lie you tell , on subconscious level you will start associate russia with everything `` bad '' , this is just how human brain works . 
  i 'll give you a 99.9 % that kremlin watched very closely how russia was portrayed , who said what , what was the general notion and so on . 
  so , when `` opposition '' came to power , the very first things they did was ** openly ** anti-russian and they promised even more in regards to crimea as well ( and naval bases stationed there ) . 
  at this point i think kremlin decided to show what `` real influence '' looks like . 
  the question is if `` wolf '' would show its teeth , if things were more calm or followed the deal mediated by europe . 
  you can call it `` battle for ukraine '' if you want and this was round 1 , which is ending with crimean referendum ( if things would go as everyone thinks they would , we 'll have a russian crimea and a somewhat defused situation ) . 
  round 2 would be about eastern ukraine as a whole and the general population reaction to imf reforms and kiev actions/elections . 
  very bad moves would be serious nato talks or `` right sector '' rise to power through elections . 
  feels like we are on a highway to brezhnev era minus all the social stuff this song describes it pretty well i think http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl0rhibyly0, 
  well , i guess `` boy '' cried wolf for ~ 3 months and eventually wolf came and showed what he is truly capable of . 
  a shame , really , i wonder if all this could be avoided if `` revolutionaries '' would be a bit more restraint in their quest to obtain legitimacy in the eyes of the people . 
  as it stands now , when imf reforms would be introduced and implemented , i think there is a decent chance for a continuation of `` banquet '' . 
  ukraine will face a lot of unrest and pain in the nearest future , but its a price for couple decades of retardation , no easy way outs :(, 
  swiss already `` bended over '' to u.s on taxes and this was supposed to be their `` thing '' ... 
  things are complicated in international politics and i 'm afraid mr.snowden is stuck in russia for a while : / i hope he is well though , i do n't think he deserves the shit he is getting from `` international media '' . 
  realistically i think it was never even on the table , unless europe wants hordes of migrants from central asia : / somehow i doubt it, 
  you * can * start embargoing russia left and right , ban everyone from entering , restricting movement of capital and stop buying russian gas and oil , but just like russian people will face consequences from putin 's actions ** in not so distant future ** , european citizens will face consequences as well . 
  gas prises will rise , european firms will start loosing russian market , dirty russian money in real estate in latvia or any other country like spain or uk will find another place to stay . 
  there is ** a lot ** of illegal russian money in europe , as funny as it sounds they provide jobs for constructions of villas , german premium car manufacturers , swiss clock makers , london banks , you name it . 
  real world is different from comic books or movies , people here expect `` white knight , balls deep charge against russia '' , but such action is pretty stupid and will have grave economical repercussions . 
  there are calculations to be made , risks to analyze , negotiations to be held . 
  again , there will be consequences , but do n't expect an immediate `` fuck russia '' response from europe , its just short sighted and silly really . 
  russian parliament does not have any opposition , nor discussions . 
  there was a famous quote by a previous '' \u0441\u043f\u0438\u043a\u0435\u0440 '' , smtn like a head of parliament `` parliament is not a place for discussions ! '', 
  by mr. gryzlov . 
  there is a second name for parliament in russia - `` mad printer '' . 
  well , russia always had a pretty shitty international view , i was thinking more about things like finland becoming nato member and installing missile defend shields , increased military presence in europe , full scale western support for syrian islamists ( for a later possible gas pipe ) , saudi arabia given a free passage from washington to finance terrorists , massive investments into greece gas , possible problems with russian money and property in the west , arctic race etc. 
  all these are pretty bad in my opinion , i am sure policymakers can think of something even worse . 
  i kind a hope everyone would take a chill pill and let it all fade away , caz escalation can lead to a lot of ugly things and confrontations , which are unnecessary . 
  this feels like a mistake , although i can not pinpoint how exactly this will backfire on russia . 
  i am also hoping that everyone will calm down a bit and stop escalating a complicated situation even more . 
  if situation would spiral out of control , there is a chance that russians and russian military will start `` dealing '' with crimean tatars ( 2 russians died the other day one of whom was a woman , when tatars made their push ) . 
  mobs are hard to control and seems like they are not exactly best friends with each other . 
  lastly , yanukovich should not live in russia , especially in a reportedly 52 mln $ mansion , dump him to belarus or some stan , he is a useless burden which most certainly would damage future russia-ukraine relationship . 
  this is all `` what ifs '' territory , if you have a clash of ideologies and have a weak state you will loose . 
  russia lost russo-japanese war , ww1 and got 2 revolutions because at the time it was `` a sick man of europe '' with a gigantic agrarian sector , you add to that civil war , military involvement of `` allies '' and restrictions of credit lines to a young communist state and its pretty hard to think that anyone would left ussr alone , let alone help it . 
  so in that regard industrialization was necessary just to survive and a * time window * was quite limited . 
  if no one is giving you money , you have to earn it with what u got , therefore -  collectivization to finance industrialization . 
  again , if ussr did not industrialized in time either we would outright lost in ww2 and got exterminated in accordance to generalplan ost , or suffered ** even more ** casualties that we did , may i remind you ussr lost 27 million people . 
  there would be no ukraine , no belarus , a significantly less number poles and so on down the list . 
  we actually can kind a speculate because ussr shares a somewhat similar fate with another country who suffered during ww2 just as much , which is china . 
  they were also a sick man of asia , suffering from legacy of opium wars , colonization and all the `` wonderful '' things that happen to them during their 100 years of shame . 
  they actually ** lost ** to japan and got their country occupied and if u would take a look at numbers , its pretty hard to comprehend how can 500 million people loose to ~ 70 , but they did . 
  there is no such things as `` spherical horses in vacuum '' in history , a combination of factors result in a somewhat predictable outcome -  therefore a concepts of blitzkriegs , because otherwise you can not win . 
  would it be great if ussr took its time and developed slow and steady a highly advanced both agrarian and industrial sector , just like england or france or germany ? 
  no doubt about it . 
  did it had at least decades for that ? 
  absolutely fucking not . 
  lastly , even though no one ever seems to remember that , russians died and suffered just as much , but no one even bothers to mention them , its all about holodomor or holocaust . 
  a bit sad , but i guess russians are not people enough . 
  its nothing like that though , no one says ukrainians are savages or deserve to be treated like crap , what i am saying is that since ukraine got allied with russia in xvii century their territory over the years increased greatly , their population grew tremendously , they had opportunities for public and state service , they were protected from kebab/polish invasions , nazi extermination campaign and so on and so forth . 
  when you compare that treatment with what ireland or scotland ( even recently there was a report about british crown classifying oil findings from scots or smtn like that like ~ 40-50 years ago ) got over the same centuries of `` friendship '' , the pieces of the puzzle does not add up . 
  even today when you look at ukraine population decline since 90s , why is it under `` evil soviet '' they were growing along side with their gdp and when they got free , they lost about 7 million people and their economy is collapsing . 
  again , i am not saying ukrainians and cossacks did not contribute greatly for russia and their country as well , all i am saying is - if u compare what ireland or scotland got compared to ukraine , its not all that `` black and white '' to me . 
  its funny , because if u compare to what ireland or scotland got from british empire and what ukrainians gained from russia over the centuries , one might think that someone is `` ungrateful '' to say the least . 
  but , their current `` national identity '' is based upon evil russia oppressing freedom-loving ukraine for centuries and exploiting them like india . 
  no wonder we are salty : /, 
  ja , germany would be delighted to hear about that !, 
  thats a nice terminal you have there polan , would be a shame if anything happen to it http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/russiaball_pleased.jpg, 
  by your logic persons fate is decided from the place where he was born and not where he grew up , with whom interacted , where did he got his education and life experience . 
  if u think that way , i 'm afraid nothing i say will ever reach you . 
  again , using your logic moscow should belong to poles because during '' \u0421\u043c\u0443\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f '' they were controlling it for some time . 
  a bit ridiculous is it not ? 
  its just to be expected in a somewhat divided country , you oust `` their '' elected candidate and declare him illegitimate and that you will not follow orders from kiev in western ukraine , they will declare `` new power '' illegitimate ( at least until new elections ) and will not follow orders as well . 
  i mentioned previously that if ukrainians were to be smart , they wo n't push the whole `` obey me '' thing and give an opportunity for an honest vote ( and their respective candidate/representative ) and whatnot . 
  this is a familiar scenario from middle east , if things would go badly , we might see a new `` european sudan '' . 
  so far ukrainians are doing a fine job of alienating russia and russia sympathizers , i can kind of understand `` leninopad '' , but kutuzov memorial and unknown soldier is uncalled for ( from my perspective ) . 
  there will be more `` getting rid of bad influence '' , caz it is easier to blame `` homoseks/migrants/russians '' in your troubles , rather than acknowledging that perhaps you are not as perfect as you thought you were .

  upr existed for like 4 years , even compared to the time russian empire controlled crimea this is nothing . 
  well , '' \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 '' and co has kind a shown a way with the whole capturing of administrative buildings , forcing governors resignations etc. 
  some guy even was beaten on square and handcuffed with his family threatened or smtn . 
  this is a double-edged sword , `` you reap what you sow '' type of thing . 
  good thinking comrade !, 
  khrushev was an ukrainian and at the time no one thought anything bad could happen . 
  even though he was an idiot , after stalin death he was the next gen. secretary , so its pretty hard to disobey someone like that ( at the time ) .
