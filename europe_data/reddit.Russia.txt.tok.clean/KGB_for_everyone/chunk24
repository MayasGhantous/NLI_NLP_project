  its pretty simple , eu wanted ukraine in its sphere of influence , they got them . 
  now if things would go smoothly and in a non-retarded way , there would be 2 parallel branches of power existing up until presidential elections on 25th of may . 
  the possibility of a pro-russian candidate victory is minimal , so ukraine will get someone like yatsenyuk/klichko ( with a probability of timoshenko giving support to one of them ) -  anti-russian president -  no deal , no better gas prices , increased economic pressure , no restructuring of loans and so on . 
  so ukraine will need money to simply not default until 25th of may and then depending on who won , they would need even more money . 
  if eu treaty would be signed , i believe commentators even here acknowledged that a lot of ukrainian industry would fall apart and closed down , so european union would need to fund educational programs as well ( if you destroy someones job , its a good idea to give them another one or skills to get a new one ) . 
  there are of course other problems like infrastructure etc , but its not critical . 
  i think the sooner you start educational programs with grants and whatnot , the better . 
  more time -  more opportunity to learn and not end up like greece or portugal . 
  all this ofc if russia would just sit there and watch , without trying to do anything funny . 
  so far i have n't really seen any serious russian involvement even though euromaidanpr twitter almost daily claims otherwise . 
  for 3 months the best they could do is to get some kind of ribbon , which is funny , caz today i 've read on lenta.ru an article where journalist in a conversation with `` activists '' saw hand-made press badges ( while they obviously were not ) . 
  i 'm not sure why u are being downvoted , i understood your message as that of a compassion and not judgement ( as of things to come ) . 
  basically i assumed it being just softhearted from your side : / we are living in the 21st century and people are still killing each other by thousands , caz they do n't like `` that other guy and what he believes in '' . 
  its just a fact . 
  declare state of emergency . 
  get army on the streets . 
  either arrest yanukovych and his family or let them flee ( dunno who would want them though , maybe some kind of stan or belarus if russia would ask really nicely ) . 
  announce early elections in like 1 month and give a lot of air time for politicians to promote themselves , especially independent ones . 
  all this should be done by high ranking military/intelligence officers and ** negotiate ** with either russia or imf or eu or us an immediate financial help package to avoid sovereign default . 
  basically pull of an egypt style coup to stabilize situation and get this situation defused . 
  that is if ukrainians want to keep their country as a whole and stop the violence . 
  in other case , ukraine will fall apart and level of hatred and violence will skyrocket . 
  also worth mentioning that the divide between pro-european western ukraine and pro-russian south-east would still exist and everything that comes with it . 
  unfortunately human history indicates that as a species we are not that good at negotiating or understanding the other side , we rather prefer `` submit to my point of view or fuck you '' style of approach . 
  in this very thread you suggest war with my country , give ideas about some kind of vunderwaffe and preach about democracy and everlasting peace after ww2 ( which is a whole lot of bullshit in itself ) . 
  not to mention remarks about women just waiting to be liberated by `` big nato dicks '' , waiting to get fucked . 
  reminds me of muslim preachers as well with all the virgins talk . 
  there have been plenty of interference from both european union and u.s. as of late , including officials visiting anti-government protest and giving them support . 
  just fucking imagine russian mps or iranian or chinese , preaching in the middle of washington . 
  this is ridiculous . 
  yet it happen in kiev . 
  well , in 2004 opposition came to power ( by whatever means ) and disappointed `` the people '' , so `` the people '' voted for other candidate , who as it turns out is just as disappointing . 
  if yanukovich is russia 's man , then why the fuck did he throw fuel into the fire with all the eu association talks , constant promises and so on ? 
  it seems like this idiot tried to sit on two chairs and as it is quite often happens , failed miserably . 
  you remind me of this fucking douchebag http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se32hateivw stop being a douche and get your head out of your ass you self-righteous moron . 
  edit , typo *, 
  i am not sure i understand guillotine clause correctly , basically if swiss refuse to vote the way eu wants , all previous treaties might be reworked ( which would fuck up economy as far as i understand ) ? 
  is this correct or am i missing something ? 
   the association agreement would not suddenly prevent trade , market opportunities and trade agreements between ukraine and russia to their mutual benefit . 
  not even a eu membership would do that : even if ukraine someday decided to apply for a eu membership there would be benefits and new opportunities for russia and russian businesses too . 
  it will not completely stop it , but i thought russia already made several hints how it will start to treat ukraine . 
  when you benefit from non-market based relations with someone , its not exactly wise to ignore that someone and do as you want . 
  if russia is holding a significant amount of power over ukraine and its financial stability , what makes you think that such power would not be exercised ? 
   it 's not a zero sum game . 
  but with the all or nothing approach your question seems to assume it is . 
  your model implies substantial economical growth , when afaik eurozone is in crisis and there is no light in the end of the tunnel . 
  demand in stagnant economies is finite , in shrinking it is lowering . 
  no one can buy shit when he has no money , i think it is obvious for everyone . 
  when you have no job , you do n't have any money . 
  what is worse is that demand was artificially boosted by reaganomics and debt issuing . 
  so unless you know a way to erase all the government and private debt accumulated over the last 20-30 years , there is no solution in the current system . 
  that is , if things remain the same and there would be no another global meltdown . 
  all i 'm saying is if russian officials ( putin oligarchs ) decide to restrict trade with ukraine to put them under pressure , they can do so and in that case europe would need to step up its game ( support ukrainian products ) . 
  but in doing so , they would have to replace european products with ukrainian . 
  if you buy `` freedom cheese '' , this means you do n't buy a normal dutch or french one , which in the long run , hurts their respective manufacturers . 
  this is why markets are so important , they keep jobs and cash inside the country . 
  i will not comment on imf , because for a russian this is an organization which `` advised '' shock therapy , privatization and all the other wonderful things that happen to my country during 90s . 
  i 'm not exactly objective here and have a hard time seeing any success stories from imf . 
  but as a westerner , i 'm sure you see the other picture . 
  regarding conditions of the loan , google gives this http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-31/ukraine-vows-to-curb-reserves-plunge-as-imf-repeats-loan-demands.html or ** even better ** this http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/10/31/ukraine-imf-idinl5n0il1ti20131031 sounds more like `` citizen , pay up '' , rather than `` comprehensive economical reforms to boost investment and whatnot '' . 
  also , does not address the fact that * european * demand for both steel and chemicals is not that high ( difficult to pay back to say the least ) . 
   the association agreement means even more trade than the existing trade agreements with the eu ( e.g. 
  the deep and comprehensive free trade area ( dcfta ) gives ukraine a free access to the eu 's over 500 million consumers and market with a combined economy of 12.9 trillion euros - while russia 's customs union has only 170 million consumers and a combined economy of 1.4 trillion euros . 
  giving access does not mean you can sell anything though , ukrainian products are not that competitive or in high demand , european on the other hand ... 
  there is one seriously competitive asset ukraine has , which is its farmland ( china kind a confirms my words ) . 
  again , demand for steel and chemicals is not that high in europe and whats more important that you need ** energy ** to produce both steel and chemicals . 
  guess who controls energy prices and who can make prices even less competitive ? 
  as a side note i am actually quite interested in ukraine success story , since i consider them as a somewhat more poor brother , so if they can do it , so can we . 
  i would like to hear what are they planning to do with all the oligarchs who control ~ 80 % of their economies though , i have not heard ** anything ** about them from euromaidan activists , but they seem to me as an `` elephant in the room '' . 
  yes , i understand what power and control means , but i 'm talking about next thing in line which is * consequences * . 
  in any given scenario in which europe is embracing ukraine , there is one * universal * outcome - such move would be seen by russia as ** extremely ** unfriendly . 
  hard to tell exactly what russia would do , but it would be quite unpleasant and eu-russia relations would be ruined for decades . 
  to clarify , 10 billion is this year only ( there would be plenty more to come ) to avoid default + you would need to compensate a loss of russian market for ukraine ( buy more ukrainian farm goods for ex , less european ) . 
  lets say klitchko ( or yatsenyuk ) has won and become a president and tyahnibok magically disappeared with his ultra-nationalist agenda . 
  as far as i remember their political platform initially was `` away from corrupt russia , embrace new hope in form of eu '' . 
  regardless how much i read various opinions of `` experts '' or just folks from livejournal and whatnot , there is a constant theme of `` bad russian influence '' . 
  so the question is - `` why would russia give ukraine any money , any debt relief , any market opportunities or any better deal on gas , if your political elite ( and it seems a huge portion of your population ) is openly anti-russian ? '', 
  and a follow-up question to fellow europeans - `` would you support giving ukraine a loan of at least 10 bln $ and buying more of their products ? 
  ( more agriculture stuff i guess ? 
  doubt anyone would buy machinery , when you have germany ), 
  do you have any proof of that or are you just pulling `` facts '' out of your ass ? 
  the reason im asking is because i 've seen plenty of cherry-picking footage with zero follow-ups , sort of like implanting information in people subconscious to manipulate them into your pov . 
  otherwise you are no better than any other asshole who screams left right and centre about zionists , cia and so on . 
  when this started i thought of this as an early electoral campaign to get some votes for opposition and interested parties , now its spiraling out of control into full scale revolution with capturing of local administrations and such . 
  i just hope ukraine wo n't turn out like sudan in the end . 
  be safe and try to sort things out in a non-violent way . 
  maaaybe bulgarians , but doubt so . 
  things like that do n't happen overnight , its been brewing for decades . 
  when soviet union collapsed , a lot of local politicians were like `` its all russia fault , we ourselves are awesome and will succeed 100 % ! '' . 
  or had somewhat similar train of thought . 
  20 + years has passed since and results are mixed . 
  some stans ( mostly with resources like kazakstan and turkmenistan ) are doing ok , some turned into a third world shithole with no future prospects . 
  there is also baltics who always were somewhat different , but its still funny to see pr attempts from tiny estonia to posture itself as an it-giant and cutting edge in innovation or poland 's `` invest in eastern poland '' commercials . 
  one would think that if things were great , there would be no need for such things , but i 'm no estonian or polish and overall they are definitely doing better than others ( or at least they look like they do ) . 
  and then there is ukraine . 
  i ca n't really describe whats wrong with it , but it feels like a girl who tries to live with 2 boyfriends and play them against each other for her own benefit . 
  she 's been `` dancing '' with both russia and eu for quite some time , taking monies from both sides and accepting gifts and whatnot . 
  main problem is , she is financially insolvent and unwilling to do anything about it . 
  recent russia-ukraine relations went sour after orange revolution in 2004 i think , when tymoshenko + yushenko came to power and started basically shitting on anything that have to do with russia , russian language , russian bases , schools , commemorating questionable ( from russian point of view ) `` heroes '' . 
  before all that , ukraine had a pretty good deal on energy , you can say even `` friendly '' .
