  naturally , when your close neighbor starts to shit on you , there are consequences . 
  for ukraine it was gas prices . 
  to put it simple - without cheap russian gas its pretty hard for ukrainian economy to properly function without huge deficits . 
  there were also petty things like giving support to saakashvili during 2008 conflict , a lot of russians considered such act as backstabbing . 
  then world crisis came and ukraine started taking loans from the likes of imf to fund deficits . 
  now its generally a ** very bad ** sign , when you need to go into debt to finance public sector . 
  if russia would not have loaned ~ 15 bln $ , it might very well default on its obligations , caz they simply can not pay it back . 
  somewhere along the line , ukrainians grew tired of yushenko + tymoshenko tandem and elected a new president with hopes for a better future and whatnot . 
  problem is , dude is just as corrupt and unwilling to modernize his country in any significant fashion . 
  think politburo 70 + old geezers and brezhnev zastoi era mentality . 
  i should also mention that dudes son suddenly became a very successful and talented businessman , a billionaire no less . 
  if you need a more graphic comparison , think just as bad as russia , but with waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay less access to natural resources . 
  and obvious things like outdated equipment , reactionary population and so on . 
  also local oligarchs , pretty wealthy oligarch with connections to political parties and their leaders . 
  ukrainians probably can write a book or two about their aspirations and what went wrong , who is to blame and how did this happen , but in the end they tried to sit on both chairs while giving almost nothing in return . 
  all good eventually comes to an end and so it is time for ukraine to decide , which chair she prefers most . 
  as bystander , its looks like ukrainians believe that eu will magically solve all its problems and things would start to get better for them . 
  as someone who reads a little bit about world news everyday , i have my doubts about `` recoveries '' and `` all will be good soonish '' . 
  as a russian , i do n't really understand how even awesome !, 
  and popular boxer can lead a country . 
  ( as a sidenote russian media portrays klitchko as merkels puppet and tbh i do think that merkel is super-heavyweight politician and klitchko is infant in that regard ) . 
  p.s : i think yanukovych as 2015 candidate is done for , so the deal with russia in up in the air . 
  i do n't think that he will be toppled in revolution , but he has no prospects as a candidate , so his usefulness for russia is quite low . 
  i do n't know ukrainian , but some guy called lutsenko talks about him being arrested by crook yanukovych , blah , blah , blah , i 'm with you people and so on . 
  its hard to understand caz rip left ear + background noise + lag , but overall impression is of typical political semi-pr bullshit to score some points , try to influence the other side and weird mentioning of chechnya ( ??? ) . 
  dunno wtf is that about , but ukrainians love to tell scary stories how evil russian spetznaz was summoned from moscow etc ( same happended during orange revolution when yushenko + tymosheko got in power ) . 
  dude also mentions his own name quite a lot . 
  random perspective from another russian for you my german friend - this guy does n't feel right . 
  i had pc since i was like 6 or 7 ( so i 've had like a lifetime of anglosphere internet , forums , games and so on ) and this guy in particular feels wrong . 
  too much of little things like puns , blunt statements about invading someone , random mentioning of facts or events , but they hold no significant value , because they wo n't happen any time soon ( so there is no point in actually saying anything like that ) . 
  guy overall feels wrong , he 's posting hours assuming he is from moscow is from 23:00 and 8 hours straight , assuming he 's an official , you ** do ** need to work and not answer ama 's on reddit for the entire night . 
  also little stuff like creating account 3 days ago right around when protests began etc. 
  from a random russian point of view i think there is a media campaign currently going on around ukraine and its protests , its not unheard of to create fake profiles of brave freedom activists ( i remember reading about a gay woman from egypt during arab spring who turned out to be a dude from london or smtn like that ) to sway public opinions ( or to piss someone off ) . 
  just keep in mind that this guy might be not legit and this is internet . 
  dude is weird for a russian , especially for an official in lt.col rank ( fsb type ? ), 
  you are a major tax haven , with some shady policies and a pretty strong financial sector , in that you are quite similar to british . 
  last time i checked kaliningrad was a russian territory , so russia can do whatever the fuck it wants on it . 
  whats more important is the desire to undermine m.a.d , via highly advanced missile defense systems near russian borders . 
  ussr did n't nuked anyone in cold war , russia is but a shadow of its former self , still somewhat capable , but against france + uk+g ermany economic and industrial potential is not even close . 
  also , as a side note , i do n't really understand the desire to piss us off , i 'm pretty sure there are cheap and cost effective methods to ensure earths annihilation , like nuking the pole to contaminate all fresh water ( and who knows what would happen when million cubic meters of ice instantly melts ) or some sort of diseases/viruses being released from russian embassies in case of attack . 
  if u put some thought into that , you probably can come up with some really fucked up doomsday devices , the problem with them - once you create them , there is always a risk of `` errors '' which may ( or may not ) wipe out humanity . 
  personally , i prefer nukes , safer and scary enough so no one would want to fuck with each other , as long as mutual assured destruction is guaranteed . 
  in russia everything is owned either by the state or their best buddies - oligarchs . 
  this means that the main source of inflation is rising prices by either state owned companies like gazprom , rosneft , any electrical company , russian railroads , rushydro or their buddies-oligarchs who control all the big retailing groups , factories and so on . 
  the logic goes like this : state owned gazprom or rosneft is increasing prices on gas each year by ~ 15 percent , every other industry is increasing prices as well , nodding on the rising prices in energy . 
  there is an ongoing joke in russia : `` the prices of oil has risen on world market , we need to increase as well !, 
  the prices has fallen on world market , we need to increase prices to compensate our losses of super-profits ! '', 
  this is the general theme in everything . 
  industries are monopolized and owned by the state , there is no competition almost , cartel deals are a common thing . 
  in this environment , our corporations and banks lend money from abroad , ** because ** our rates are too high . 
  if you owe money to foreign banks , they dictate the terms of paying back , not your very own central bank . 
  so if anything happens , that they wo n't like ( like say devaluing of the currency -  profits become lower because russia import goods each year of ~ 300 billion dollars -  balance sheet looks worse -  terms for credit change ) , you ca n't move as freely as u would like . 
  i 've heard this story over and over again and each year official inflation is `` decreasing '' , but prices on everyday commodities keep on rising like a clock . 
  u do n't honestly think that greeks or spaniards will pay out their debts , do you ? 
  this is the same type of deal , russia will never see this money again . 
  i am 99 % sure that 15 billion is not the final number . 
  financially insolvent countries tend to ask `` gib monies '' on a regular basis , europe is right next door , examples are plenty . 
  it also does not negate the fact , that russian reserves are being used to pay for other country financial retardation , while russian economy is not exactly booming by any means . 
  there were i believe at least 4 downgrades in economic forecasts this year alone , not exactly bullish , eh ? 
  5 % unemployment sounds great on paper , but i 'm afraid that its sort a like german/american statistics , semi-truth with shades of gray , part time jobs , part of made-up numbers . 
  even so , in ** declining ** economy people are getting fired left , right and center , salaries are being cut and getting a new job is actually * harder * , it already happened in 08-09 years , what makes you think that this time will be any different ? 
  especially with forecasts of decline on oil and gas prices by 2017 ( peak shale in us , saudi arabia final push ) . 
  as a bonus we will have an overall decline in demand for consumer products just like in any other crisis , especially with current credit rates . 
  you ca n't possibly pay out 15-20 percent a year without a job or when your salary is being cut ( even more stress for general population and financial institutions as well , due to inability to collect payments ) . 
  all this is just a local semi-european , semi-russian crisis ; real global one will be far more severe . 
  p.s : caucasians from stans , with permits , really ... ? 
  and what kind of jobs exactly are they working on ? 
  last time i checked they sell fruits and vegetables on the streets , work in kitchens and build something not exactly high-tech . 
  so , russia will loose profits from gas exports ** and ** provide a 15 billion `` loan '' ( which will never be repaid ) from our very own `` norway style savings fund '' ( which was designed for crises ) . 
  20 billion for apec 2012 in vladivostok , 40 + billion for sochi ( funny story , russia apparently is buying snow machines from israel , caz who would have thought - hosting a winter games in sub-tropics is not a great idea ) , will host world cup 2018 and other `` mega-projects '' . 
  meanwhile our economy is stagnating at best , general population is under extreme credit pressure ( with rates of 15-20 % a year ) , production is shrinking etc. 
  i consider myself somewhat patriotic , but what the actual fuck ? 
  why is serdyukov and his ladies get an amnesty ? 
  why do i keep reading about our corporate debt of ~ 700 + billion $ to foreign banks , because our very own central bank refuses to credit the economy and lower the rates , which as far as i understand cripples our ability to devalue currency . 
  how come prices are keep rising every fucking year for ~ 15 percent on pretty much everything required in daily lives like electricity , heat , all sorts of food and water . 
  how come not a single fucking soul or institution is responsible for a cascade of shitty decision making and outright horrible policies/reforms ? 
  the list is ** infinite ** . 
  but nooo , we need ukraine in customs union so lets give them free money , jobs and access to our markets . 
  meanwhile for our population by words of our dear prime-minister medvedev `` someone , perhaps it would be quite significant part of population , will have not only to change his job , but his career and residency as well '' . 
  lets pretend for the sake of argument that ukraine is in customs union . 
  what next ? 
  who is gon na fight corruption , provide jobs , stimulate growth , invest in education ( and provide the incentive not to leave abroad ) ? 
  so far government managed to fuck up almost every important piece of legislation in recent decade or 2 , i can not name any of the big reforms that were a success . 
  maybe someone will help me out on this one ? 
  protest without leader is pointless , no one to lead - nowhere to go . 
  like an old story about swan , crab and barracuda , everyone pulls their way , the cart remains still . 
  if you do not see , how klitchko is `` campaigning '' on this mass protest , then u r blind . 
  its pretty obvious from here and i do n't really see any other candidate worth something . 
  i do n't know much about him , but somehow i find it hard to believe that a boxer can lead a country to prosperity . 
  i 've read a bit about ukraine 's situation in last couple weeks and from what i understand is your currency is devaluing , there are talks about limiting the amount of $ $ $ u can convert from local currency ( caz of lack of reserves ) , in 2014 ukraine has ~ 10 billion usd in maturing debt and u ca n't afford that , so the talks with imf is being held ( which is always a bad sign ) . 
  you add to that an overall external debt of ~ 130 billion and rising , decline in gdp , rise in bonds risks ( some say ~ 50 % chance of default as of now ) and its not a pretty picture . 
  how in such economic conditions ukraine can reform its industries in according to eu association agreement to just * keep * their economy alive ( not even talking about a rise of exports or production ) , i have no fucking idea . 
  in the end i 'm afraid of one thing only : ukraine joins eu association agreement -  it economy gets fucked beyond recognition -  ukraine takes a shit ton of loans from chinese , imf , world banks and the like , which can not be repaid -  shit happens , situation gets worse and new `` leader '' rises , who seek help from east -  now its a fucking russian problem . 
  so far the story remains the same : 2004 russia is bad , ukraine is awesome , fuck russia , go ukraine !, 
  smtn , smtn , russian spetsnaz , chechen militias , evil moscow plots ( add whatever you feel like here ) . 
  almost 10 years later , after yushenko + timoshenko + yanukovich ; same fucking story all over again . 
  all in all , if ukrainians think life can be improved via eu , go for it ; perhaps this time ** is ** different . 
  sounds like a good deal for chinese , they 'll get even more high quality land for food production for `` rent '' . 
  it caught some attention , not sure about tv ( do n't watch obviously ) , but internet media outlets/random experts published quite a bit . 
  i 'm somewhat uncertain why it became such an important matter for both europe and russia and feel like this issue is being pushed in a hastily manner ; more importantly , i do n't know what ukrainians think about that ( i have seen polls and such , but do n't think couple thousands respondents can represent whole country ) .
