  the deal terms are also a mystery from both russian and european side ( not the official part ofc , the `` we will give you x bln $ and trade privileges one '' ) . 
  from what i have learned , association -  road to eu , free trade = good for european manufactures , not sure how ukrainian goods gon na compete with germans . 
  loosing jobs is not good i would imagine , look at troubled eu countries . 
  overall i feel like ukraine is a big country with lots of people and lots of troubles . 
  if they want to join european union , they would need to compete with one of the most technologically advanced entity in the world , for that they need modernization = a shit ton of money . 
  who is gon na give it to them ( and who 's gon na watch how they are being spent ) ? 
  that is if they want to be equals , if they would prefer an `` i want to gtfo to eu '' ( maybe even legitimize local oligarchs wealth ? ), 
  approach , we might see a new poland style migration . 
  in russian mindset eu = nato bases in a couple years time , missile defend shields and general slow creeping towards russian borders , we do n't like that . 
  if ukraine were to join russian thingy , they would probably keep their trading privileges , maybe got a better deal on gas and so on . 
  i guess putin also has in mind ukrainian population as somewhat of a counter to a growing muslim community in russia . 
  russians are going full yolo in the past couple decades , killing themselves with an efficiency even nazi 's could n't have dreamed of . 
  well , u have seen internet footage , documentaries and stuff , we are not gon na last that long with the current lifestyle . 
  on the other hand folks from central asia and other muslims are mass migrating to russia to work ( and eventually bring their whole families with them ) , study and stay for good . 
  they often do n't drink , do n't do drugs , have stronger family ties , generally stick together and have more babies . 
  so , russia might transform in like 50 years from current ~ 20mln muslims , to like 40-50 . 
  this process might transform russia from the way it operates today on the world stage , to something different ; not necessarily worse , but slightly more different . 
  for sure there are whole lot of other reasons , why customs union should include ukraine , but this requires a book or smtn . 
  experts say that if ukraine to join it would greatly benefit from trade with russia , but somehow they forgot to mention that our economy is stagnating , we recently had * sequester !, 
  * and general feeling is that of incoming a decade of slow growth at best . 
  economic forecasts are worsening each month , budgets are being cut , all the good stuff . 
  if you want to sell something , you need demand , in a shitty economy , there is not much demand afaik . 
  now that medvedevs modernization became what every single russian thought what it would be -  a whole lot of bullshit , we can safely agree that russian economy has reached its peak as an energetic empire . 
  oil , gas , wood and metal prices are not gon na go up and if anything , the iran 's deal would drop the price quite a bit , which is ** very ** bad for russian budget . 
  in the end , citizens of ukraine should decide whether or not they should join eu or russia and if they ca n't decide , then the government is not doing its fucking job of showing what suits them best . 
  if nazi = soviet , then ussr occupied eastern europe and central asia , installed puppet regimes , purges , illegal deportations , dealt significant economic damage to a economy blah , blah , blah . 
  then russia , as a legal successor , logically ( and there are probably international laws of some kind or treaties ) would have to pay for `` damages '' , displaced people , economic damage and so on . 
  basically 15 countries would get in line to get sum moneys for `` poor relatives '' who suffered greatly ( and not to recently , hey only ~ 25 years ) . 
  thats not gon na happen , look at germany and their israel relations or an occasional greece `` counting ww2 damages '' . 
  also , lots of other reasons like pride , dislike of `` petty local nationalists '' , reputation damage and so on . 
  myths are created not to represent historical facts , but to unite people under the same banners . 
  in the end , consider that russia lost cold war and history is written by the winners . 
  i do n't know how to explain , but ill try : 1 ) russians do n't trust their government ; we tend to think that our `` elites '' are scumbags , who want to steal our money to buy a nice villa and live there for the rest of their lives ( and most of the time that is exactly the case ) . 
  2 ) out society is atomized , which means that you can not trust anybody and its near impossible to find selfless folks who would work 24x7 for the good of all people . 
  3 ) if russian officials fuck-up ( and they do 9/10 times ) , no one is punished . 
  this creates a system of : `` i 'm not responsible for anything and even if i am , worst case scenario - im gon na get transfered in other department '' . 
  no responsibility = inability to solve any problem . 
  there are lots of other details , mental conditions , etc which prevails in russian society . 
  overall , nothing will change until 2014 sochi olympics . 
  after the `` disaster '' , we might see a strong protest movement , until then , status quo shall be remained . 
  id like to add that its all a theater pretty much . 
  you ca n't look weak in the eyes of russian public , that makes you a shitty leader , a `` weakling '' that is easy to push-around ( and therefore you are unable to protect russian interests ) . 
  same story with arctic sunrise , the crew would be held for ~ 6 months and then the case either would fall apart due to `` errors '' or they 'd be pardoned by putin , especially if they are foreigners . 
  russian members though - quite possibly may get like 4-5 years . 
  if anything , you should look out for the likes of turkmenistan ( glory to turkmen-bashi ! ), 
  or some other stan with lots of natural resources to loot . 
  lithuania does n't have much to offer and there is no immediate military threat from european union , so no need in buffer zones . 
  as of right now , oligarchy is busy with excellent money laundering schemes such as sochi 2014 , apec summits , world cup 2018 and so on . 
  and yes , this is probably `` payback '' for greenpeace / russian diplomat incident . 
  i 'm not interested in trolling anyone , neither in defending current russian regime ; i find it pretty much the same as yeltsin era bunch of oligarchs , looting the country dry + inability to implement ** any ** sensible or working reforms . 
  i 'm not a long time lurker on this subreddit , but through the short time i 've been reading it , it looks to me like an anti-russian circle jerk most of the time ( mainly supported by guys from baltics/poland any former ussr pretty much ) and * subtle * notion that european union is a holy entity , trying to help poor , little , struggling countries to survive in this tough world with bullies everywhere . 
  i find this notion bullshit . 
  what i tried to point out that various `` entities '' behave pretty much the same on the international area ( remember chinese solar panel deal ? 
  ) , pursuing their interest . 
  in that sense i find russia and europe as 2 sides of the same coin - be with us , or get fucked . 
  personally , i do n't care about downvotes/upvotes , but id like to know what is the reasoning behind them . 
  sometimes i try to present a potential scenario ( and based on human history , its usually not that far fetched ) , but i simply get downvoted without any meaningful explanation . 
  remember cyprus deal ? 
  russian money = dirty and bad , so people were `` ok '' with stealing them , caz they are `` russian mafia '' . 
  well i have some news for you , german elections are over , g20 meeting approved a bail-in cyprus style solutions as a standard procedure for insolvent banks , so i wonder what will europeans say , when say slovakia will get the same treatment ? 
  so what you are saying essentially is that conditions are simply not there yet , we need another meltdown ( on a global scale preferably ) , so europe could make a full circle and find a new `` jews '' , in this case - blame russians and immigrants/gypsies for every possible sin in the world . 
  you have seen how greeks/spainiards/portugals blamed germany for their problems , right ? 
  its only a matter of guidance , to point the finger properly and brainwash the population through `` social media '' and msm . 
  we can add the fact that russia , in case shit hits the fan , probably would go back to an old autarky-like-model ( and its probably one of the few countries in the world that could actually pull it off somewhat successfully due to its size and resources ) . 
  naturally this would mean a loss of revenue on a giant scale , no one will buy shit because no one can afford it , greek style unemployment and so on . 
  after that `` cannon fodder '' from eastern european countries with a lot of historical hate would provide a fantastic opportunity to form some `` rebel groups '' and start rocking the boat , with support from `` democratic '' nations obviously . 
  yeah , next time you hear anything about a potential reduction in nuclear arsenals and russian `` cold attitude '' , do n't act surprised or offended . 
  hey there hypocrite have a read http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trade_sanctions im sure that u are more than capable of using google as well , do n't act like europe or usa is a saint . 
  you do exactly the same ( or even worse ) shit around the globe , condemning other nations to being a 3rd world shithole . 
  have a nice day . 
  i highly doubt that germans will outsource their jobs and tax revenue to eastern europe . 
  how many foreign direct investment came to baltics or eastern poland ? 
  what happen to that money during 08-09 crisis ? 
  why does a shit ton of educated workforce left their respective countries after joining eu and does n't plan to come back ? 
  ( including bulgarians , romanians and so on ) where will you accommodate several million ukrainians who will search for a better life and job opportunities in europe ? 
  may i remind you about spainiards , portuguese , greek , possibly italy ? 
  lastly , i 'm no specialist , but changing the entire railroad network sounds a little more expensive than 20 billion eur and thats just one `` project '' . 
  well , good luck ukraine and europe in finding a job for several million ukrainians . 
  obviously any production that ukraine has left will be dismantled like its been done already time and time again . 
  and i do wonder who will give lots and lots of moneys for rebuilding entire railroad networks and other shit , i thought europe was in a state of crisis , 
  wording matters , historical facts helps , trying to distance yourself and looking at things as an observer from the ropes is crucial ; comparison with what was before/during and after also helps , as in looking at the development and possible alternatives . 
  basically less emotions , more undisputed facts . 
  and no matter what , in the nearest future , there is no way russia would be seen as anything but a boogeyman , u can look up 19 century propaganda posters and how russia was portrayed back then . 
  nations living near each other usually have a lot of bad blood between them , which leads to sort of a childish behavior : country a : `` u killed my people ! '', 
  country b : `` u killed jews ! '', 
  country a : `` but u occupied me ! '', 
  country b : `` but u invaded me before that ! '', 
  look at china , korea , japan , vietnam . 
  absolutely the same story . 
  i will sound like a heartless douchebag , but i still want to understand the baltics mentality - how not being crushed by tanks and violently oppressed is a worthy achievement ? 
  i 'm asking because one side is immensely more powerful than even all others combined and it did not acted in oppressive or soul-crushing way and let things go ? 
  how is it your achievement ? 
  sorry if its offensive to baltic people , but we have a living proof that soviet union could acted the same way china did on tiananmen or in tibet for that matter and no one would raise an eyebrow or lift a finger . 
  well u ca n't really dodge ww1 as a major power on the continent and russia was on the right side , just did n't lasted long enough due to shitty previous developments and inability to modernize in time . 
  russo-japanese war was a naval conflict mostly with outdated piece of shit ships against ( pumped up by u.s ) nippon soon-to-be-empire . 
  bolsheviks and stalin sort a go together and while the idea was not so bad ( equality , rights , freedoms and shit ) , human material remained the same - selfish , greedy , violent . 
  we ca n't have nice things , without altering basic human behavior . 
  and they * did * achieved a shit ton for such a poor and outdated country as russia was at 1918 ( electrification , mass education , health care , gigantic industrial projects , nuclear capabilities , man in space , abolishing famines after a number of fuck-ups , providing homes ( ? ), 
  rights for women , ww2 for fuck sake ; list can go quite far . 
  as it stands in modern russia , what would you say about sending thieves and corrupt assholes to gulags or shot on site ?
