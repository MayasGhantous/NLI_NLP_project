  i 'm sure u have an idea of scale and how widespread it is . 
  and every time i hear about molotov-ribbentrop i want to bang my head against a wall , there are * timelines * , actions of participating players , strategies , global dispositions and overall situation atm and a bijillion other factors which all ends up in one simple fact - if u would stop pretending that ** anyone ** is their clear state of mind would do anything else other than signed this piece of paper , u r delusional and have no idea how politics work . 
  there are ** no saints ** and all the previous actions of other players suggests , that what they ultimately aspired for was for germans and russians to kill each other as much as possible and then they 'd arrive late to the party ( just like it eventually turned out ) . 
  as for the main question of the topic , a failure to reform soviet state which ultimately led to it downfall and resulted in what i would call a 20 years of shame in russian history , there is absolutely nothing to be proud of in the last 20 years and its a fucking disgrace for a country like russia . 
  if i offended you , i apologize . 
  i did not meant to say that all hollywood does , is making crappy movies to fed everybody around the world . 
  it does make some of the best movies/tv series in the world as well . 
  what i 'm trying to say , is there is a cooperation between dod ( and other agencies ) and hollywood and they are pretty open about that . 
  it does cost a ** lot ** of money to film real tanks , helicopters , aircraft carries , jet planes and shit like that . 
  it does help with recruiting in army/navy/air force ( same as powerful media pictures on reddit popping up from time to time `` kid hugging father from afghanistan , wife cries in the background '' ) . 
  there is a level of influence going through people minds when they see how great everything is in america ( see immigration ) . 
  it does help creating a certain image ( argo for ex . ), 
  around the world . 
  this is an element of soft power . 
  what i do n't like is the fact , that french movie industry in this particular case would die 99 % guaranteed . 
  and we will loose another great school of cinematography . 
  i like diversity & freedom of choice and not relying on one particular place is a nice add-on to that . 
  thanks for the list though , its impossible to see everything , but i would trust your list is good , so i 'll check out what have i missed . 
  russian movies used to be great , well made and funny , now its piece of shit which i can not stand . 
  the key problem i would say is a global trend of `` more stupid and pretty content '' . 
  and americans are unmatched in that regard , hollywood is great when it comes to entertainment , but horrible when it comes to inspiring/thought provoking techniques . 
  all you do is watch how some `` rambo '' beat the shit out of bad guys and `` glorious u.s. army '' saves the day yet again . 
  kind a portrays a nice narrative of kind , caring world police , who would come and save us all . 
  the cooperation between military and hollywood is well-known and this is sort of indirect subsidies which actually are quite beneficial for international image and imposing your way of life on everybody . 
  monkey see , monkey wants . 
  people stopped thinking for themselves and all they want is new crap to feel good about themselves , while reality is slowly decaying around them . 
  it means that after cold war has ended ( ? 
  ) , nothing really changed and europe as a whole is still under strict control of us intelligence , just like good old times . 
  there is a reason why people like putin does n't have mobile phones , exchanging plans with obama via letters etc. 
  in any movie you would see stuff like `` not on the phone , meet in person '' and off-grid servers . 
  it also makes you wonder if the reason why europeans cant be so successful in start ups/innovations due to industrial espionage and large scale thievery of `` new ideas '' . 
  i remember how i read couple years ago , how in my city ( novosibirsk ) came some american `` investors/business people '' with ashton kutcher as a shill to look for `` new ideas '' , do n't think they got what they wanted though , but the event was interesting i would imagine . 
  same with not so long ago comment by mark zuckerberg , who came to moscow i believe to hire a ton of russian programmers and flew them asap to usa with nice fat paychecks , benefits and so on ( did n't get what he wanted either if i remember correctly ) . 
  same with fundamental science research i think , you invest tons of time and money in r&d and then if the technology looks promising , huge corporation comes in and makes an `` offer you can not refuse '' or simply yet again steal and publish/patent faster . 
  well , the interest rates are close to zero , there is no solutions to be found as of yet , banks got even bigger than before , people loose jobs all the time , world economies slow down ( for ex . 
  there is even data about russian economy slowing down significantly/going into recession , but mostly due to shitty policies ) and people still consume more , than they can afford - so yes , correction is imminent . 
  but it should be bigger than 2008 , mostly due to `` kick the can down the road '' mentality . 
  wall street creates magnificent financial instruments called derivatives , wall st. knows that this instruments is a piece of shit , wall st. pays ratings agencies ( moody 's , fitch etc ) to give this derivatives aaa ( highest ) rating , wall st. sells this `` safe '' `` insured '' crap to every idiot around the globe and eventually taken over by greed fucks himself as well ( at least for a while ) . 
  so in the end u have this derivatives which is in a number of several hundred trillion dollars of `` value '' , but there is not enough real assets in entire world to cover this financial instruments . 
  the end ? 
  so , can we expect cyprus style solution now ? 
  if i were slovenian , id take my money out the banks asap . 
  as for the economy and the ongoing crisis some folks say that `` in the situation when you do n't produce anything and do n't export anything to other countries , you live on a borrowed money and a borrowed time '' . 
  more importantly , in globalized economy there is no need to pay john smith 3k $ per month , when li wu can and will be glad to work for 300 $ per month . 
  so effectively you are competing not against your local population , but against 2-3 billion asians as well + immigrants ofc . 
  i think the reason even germany wants for eu to succeed is because they are export driven economy , meaning * they need markets for their production and ability to buy their products * . 
  if u ca n't sell anything and your warehouses are full of stockpiled shit , you are unable to provide jobs for your own population , because no one needs your crap anyway . 
  the biggest problem right now is that central bank rates are already close to zero , so its impossible to grow out the debt . 
  people lived on borrowed time for ~ 30 years , now is the time to pay the bill . 
  13 % seems quite optimistic , around 20-25 % is more likely . 
  no production , no tourism , no money = no economy . 
  and of course there is also another side of context , when poland after revolution and start of russian civil war felt adventurous ( like it did in the past a couple of times before ) and decided it wants ukraine , intermarium and all the other `` from sea to sea '' visions that visited brains of poles at the time  its an old game of : `` we did nuthing wrong or at least we would be better off , if we succeeded , obviously , thus our actions are justified '' . 
  damn , i wish there was some info why russia is getting involved more in syria lately . 
  backroom deals with iran and its nuclear program peace talks ( or perhaps old agreement of switcharoo between iranian republican guard and eventual russian involvement ) or maybe something else ? 
  maybe `` west '' planned something and our intelligence decided to act preemtively ? 
  weird timing , weird stories of syrian `` vacations '' , its not like we can supply it without passing through other countries first . 
  as far as `` humanitarian aid '' goes , there is nothing humanitarian in russian ruling class left , only self interests , so is it a `` ukrainian humanitarian convoy '' ? 
  ( eventually ), 
  i highly doubt russia wants syria or ukraine for that matter , just pointing out another possible problem europe will have to face soonish ( ? ), 
  and better have contigency plans for it as well : / as for sanctions , considering what russia has done , they are not that bad and its not like west could `` close its eyes '' , considering geopolitical implications , specifically in asian region . 
  russia is an emerging market and like almost every other emerging market , its crashing due to global economy and commodities ( metals , oils , gas ) being on the downside , so unless u can magically fix global economy , u ca n't do anything -_-, 
  does n't have to be a warzone , logic is fairly simple - bad economic terms in russia = no jobs , no decent pay -  since no work home , search for other places , russia has huge border with europe , meaning its hard to guard it all -  throw away papers/illegally cross into eu in search of better opportunities . 
  i kind a wonder , if situation in russia will continue to deteriorate ( and the possibility of that is quite high ) , will millions of seasonal and not-so seasonal tadjiks , uzbeks , kyrgyzs and others will try their luck with europe ? 
  every year russia essentially gives a lot of dirty work to central asia , but with economy in decline , will they seek greener pastures as well ? 
  apparently it is more effective to finance refugees or propaganda campaign among them about beautiful and full of opportunities europe instead of fringe parties on both sides of political spectrum ; _ ; damn putin , ca n't do anything right :d / s anyways , as was said many times previously , problem is here to stay for decades , current idea of handling it is sub-optimal to say the least , so here 's hoping that europe would manage to formulate a more tangible policy , without pissing off its member states in the process . 
  russian tech lately has malfunctioned quite a number of times and that is only known public issues , fallen helicopters , not working tanks during parade , etc. 
  20 years of lagging behind/doing nothing would do that and u loose expertise , professionals and things start to look ugly . 
  but do n't worry , u need to increase ur target army budget to at least 2 % of gdp and create a united european army force to match `` russian threat '' , 
  it would be an interesting scenario , considering uk has more weight in the union than lets say greece . 
  a lot of things may happen , we may learn a thing or two about `` european unity '' and free press and all that , its also interesting how world will react to the fact . 
  as it stands , uk ai n't going anywhere ( even with whole immigration problem ) , they wo n't gain much and cons  pros , seems like standard political bickering from cameron & co , even though the direction uk took lately looks a bit `` off '' . 
  your hopes are misplaced at least in short terms . 
  you should read between lines as : `` muricans are not too fond of the deal and think its a bit over the top/not feasible , so they want to know the details better '' . 
  it looks more like a scouting trip to see where europe stands , whats their vision at least mid-term wise , how they think this will shape european project and every detail that goes along with it . 
  they are not going to berlin , frankfurt and paris to pull their dick out on the table and proclaim : '' y' all stupid , here what u should do '' . 
  ( thats hyperbole ofc , you can substitute the phrase with diplomatic way of * what yurop should do * , but its essentially the same way of lecturing , which europe will not tolerate ) its rather rude , undiplomatic and borderline stupid to say that to your biggest allies and puts them into spotlight in a negative way . 
  even the news itself is an indication of the fact that washington/new york is not too happy and wants a better understanding of inner european flows . 
  u.s will react based on the information mr.lew will get and what signals he will receive from europe , but i highly doubt it would be cowboy like behavior . 
  the issue is quite sensitive and can be considered as yet another trial for europeans to take care of themselves in formulating a cohesive policy/strategy and how u.s should position itself in regard to that . 
  its a no small matter tbh , but it requires surgeon like precision and operation may take a while . 
  `` silence kiddo , grown ups are talking ! '', 
  welfare will be abolished in almost any shape or form by lets say mid century if u r an optimist , you can hear the voices for that even now in some shape or form and that it without cataclysmic events of any sorts . 
  troubles in economy - slash public sector as hard as u can , lower wages , raise pension age , the usual neoliberal dream . 
  pensions will be gone by lets say 2075-2100 , assuming humanity lives to see the day obviously . 
  again , fairly optimistic scenario . 
  most likely in the next financial crisis a lot of people 's saving will be wiped for good , since `` smart money '' know better , but a sucker is born every minute and pensions are a great long term source of investment/finance , so i think people in power & money will try to drag the `` music '' as long as they could . 
  judging by the way things are going , people would be happy to have a job that could pay for the necessities + internet and maybe a little bit to the side for a rainy day . 
  well , since its highly unlikely that merkel will pull the leash ( pardon my french ) on schauble , to calm him down a bit , the options left are some kind of last minute deal . 
  latest proposal seems `` a bit '' over the top , so its either grexit or syriza + tsipras sacrifices itself/steps down as a ruling party in greece , this may soften `` hawks '' stance a bit and prolong suffering ( another extra package , new party elected which accepts troika & co demands and thus they might get a bone as well ) . 
  sort a like a soft mode regime change with an underlying notion of : `` if u wo n't do everything we say to you , we are going to suffocate u economically for good '' . 
  all in all , its quite interesting to observe , since this pretty much defines future of european union and how next `` greece like situation '' will be dealt with . 
  a lab rat of sorts . 
  u pretty much described european politics in a nutshell , thats how things were done `` back in the day '' , when there was no `` european union dream/project '' . 
  the fact that europe is going back to old practices only signals the fact that `` age of prosperity , social stability and security '' has ended ( is ending ? ), 
  and since there is not enough money for everyone , weak will follow strong or be abandoned to their demise . 
  sort a - do as i say or else . 
  i wonder if u.s will do anything , besides standard lip service of `` resolve your issues '' , since europe is kind a important to their national security interests and more importantly is a valuable asset on world stage politics ( it is good to show that u lead `` free world '' and all that , and `` progressive nations '' agree with us + many other perks like media , surveillance , trade , global striking capabilities and many , many others ) . 
  if things go south i would imagine washington will take a step back and reevaluate the situation and we will see quite a lot of activity from u.s all over the continent , since leaving europe to `` boil in its own juice '' is not really an option . 
  whole thing looks quite messy from outsider perspective and media seems to be glad to add fuel to the fire : /, 
  russian economy is shrinking , people loose jobs or stop doing business due to glorious duma/government policies ( tax , tax , tax and stupid proposals for everyone oprah style ) .
