  there is a certain view , voiced by academics or people who know their economy , that this fall russia will become `` a turbulent place '' of sorts . 
  social unrest is possible , but not during summer and since a lot of russians know how tough times look like and have dachas with ability to plant potato and other vegetables ( for tough times ) + some sort of savings and an approach of `` been there , done that '' , it is also entirely plausible that people will `` suck it up and continue with their lives '' . 
  sort a like ukrainians do , their economy imploded and they are fucked for years to come , but you do n't hear about them protesting or organizing a new maidan . 
  role of government ( state initiatives ) will increase even more in russia i expect . 
  is that so , my german friend ? 
  * writes down something in notebook * . 
  well then , carry on -_- ** whistles away **, 
  udija reporting , enjoy your eritrean refugees  as a savage udijanian i think our evil empire should spread good word about bestuania in more african countries and middle east , glad to be of help !, 
  id like to add here do n't urinate/shit/vandalize `` eternal fire '' monuments in russia , bad idea . 
  looks like a band aid , rather than a solution to a ** long term ** problem . 
  `` hordes of migrants '' are here to stay and if situation globally will continue to deteriorate ( and it will , caz no one wants to deal with tough shit ) , the numbers of migrants / `` refugees '' will either stabilize ( optimistic scenario ) or continue to rise with each year , as situation `` on the ground '' in their home countries continue to get worse and worse . 
  i wish china would last without financial catastrophe for at least ~ 10 years or so , but their bubble and market reminds me a mixed bag of pre-great depression u.s and asian financial crisis ( the japanese one ) , once it pops , a loooooooot of people will loose everything and be upset about it . 
  new great resettlement of people is going to be hella massive ( assuming the rage ofc will not be channeled towards war/lebensraum rhetoric ) . 
  sigh . 
  perhaps i was in the wrong and paid for that for 5 years , perhaps i lost a generation and plenty of prospects in the future , perhaps i will pay for my mistakes for years to come , but the doctor 's treatment looks more and more like he wants to kill me or make me terminally ill , instead of fixing me . 
  perhaps i am worried about my future ( and future of my body ) for a reason ? 
  coach might be a great guy and all that , but i kind a start to smell and there are like these weird spots on my body , is this is how its supposed to be , before i get better , doc ? 
  i got fat and in order to be more `` fit '' , i started to eat less and then i stopped drinking as much water as well as per suggestion of the `` coach '' , stopped taking medication as well , also lost my job , my utility bills went up like a clock and i have no prospects to find a decent paying job in my home country . 
  fuck it , i almost lost an ability to get any food as well , but the doctor says : `` i am going to be okay '' , even though he said the same 5 years ago and diagnosed my treatment wrongly for several times , but pay no attention , doctors are always right . 
  just a little bit more of less food , water , medicine , jobs or hope and i 'll most certainly get there , just a little . 
  interesting , i do n't think that this will be taken kindly by kremlin & co , but what do i know :d as the saying goes : `` what could possibly go wrong ? '', 
  excellent time to invest in wall building industry i imagine :d especially if the things will continue to go the direction they currently are , i would imagine countries bordering at least greece and italy would be quite interested in these services . 
  funny how after ~ 25-30 years we are building walls again, 
  i do n't know about argentina , but i think russia is a bit more wealthier and has more things to offer ( or to make profit from ) than greece . 
  you know , the usual : resources , transit between china and europe , decent human capital etc. 
  countries are fundamentally unequal in their geography and access to precious resources/trade routes ( be it oil , gas , water , metals , woods or waever ) . 
  greece in that regard is in interesting position , since they have theoretically have some valuable assets ( ships , decent tourist industry ) , but its not enough and assuming if they do default , they will sell everything they own for pennies , making their life even more miserable and closely resembling russia during 90s ( and i wo n't wish for anyone to go through that ) . 
  nice headline 8/10 . 
  murican troops stationed in eastern europe/baltics / `` central europe '' although somewhat small in numbers , still represent biggest military alliance on the planet with x10 + the budget of russia , with far more advanced tech and manpower readiness + plenty of combat experience in all of the `` adventures '' of nato and friends around the globe . 
  not to mention the tendency of americans to overreact on anything , which can even remotely threaten their national security ( or their rigorous `` patriotism '' and how they essentially fap on their military in general ) , so attack on `` small number of troops '' is essentially attack on u.s. 
  in the end , we either have incompetent former ambassador of the united states to the ukraine who have no idea what he is talking about or a special interest group person , with an agenda to deliver to the `` masses '' ( and coincidentally i would assume the job at atlantic council thingy pays rather well , perhaps with a bonus or two from defense industry , you never kow  ) . 
  not to mention that in all of the so called `` prognosis '' , russian public opinion is somehow considered as a mindless retards , who are ready to die for the tzar and his buddies 24x7 and participation rate of future `` crusades '' would be unquestionable . 
  the number of `` volunteers '' for a 140 million country in a `` holy crusade against fascism '' is laughable , but western media and `` analysts '' still completely ignore this simple fact . 
  numbers do n't add up and stink . 
  preparation for smearing campaign/boycott for 2018 championship in russia ( just remember how much shit was thrown at russia prior to sochi and thats without any ukrainian events ) or maybe they just got salty that qatar had more money to bribe fifa . 
  i do n't care either way , i hope in fact russia would be stripped of the event as soon as possible , so that dozens of billions of $ wo n't be wasted on useless shit like stadiums and the like . 
  we are not in a position to `` look respectable '' or build more of potemkin villages . 
  u r going to eat your `` vegetables '' and like it or else there is no more eu funds/investments for your country . 
  this is the price all of eastern europe & co will pay , since u ca n't have cake and eat it too  otherwise russia will have a field day , especially with the news of eu drawing plans to bomb some more to deny them ability to take refuge . 
  where is your humanity , human rights , liberal values now ? 
  oh look former foreign minister of lithuania and twice the ambassador to nato is talking shit about russia again , what a surprise !, 
  surely eastern europeans/baltics / `` central europeans '' have the most unbiased version of academic history in the world and know better than anyone else what led to ww2 and who were the actors responsible for hitler 's rise , * continental politics at the time * and well known `` love '' between commies vs fascists vs capitalists . 
  and surely geopolitical situation has not changed either during and right after ww2 ( nope , no atomic bombs in one particular nations hands which they actually ** used ** , nothing to see here citizen ) . 
  world was ready to enter an unprecedented era of peace and it was all ussr faults that cold war started . 
  in 5-10 years the numbers will change a bit more , rinse-repeat and that kids is how you rewrite history . 
  this probbly contributes to the fact that `` humanity never learn from history '' , because the history itself becomes bullshit to fuel certain views/agenda and glorify `` the good guys '' ( insert middle kingdom , # 1 , invincible red army myths , blah blah blah ) . 
  europe also needs to steal or `` create opportunities '' ( buy out ) other countries brightest and most talented people/ideas and for that u might want an independent spying agencies which will serve * your * countries ( bloc ) interests , not report to washington of what they are interested and what they discovered in the process . 
  read up about the likes of in-q-tel and consider what kind of job they have , who helps them with targets and what goals they pursue . 
  developed lithuania prepare to add kebab ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) others will follow suit somewhat i guess , 
  1 ) i do n't think germany can handle all the problems which european union faces alone , but i see very little indication of anyone else rising to the challenge or proposing any meaningful reforms or solutions . 
  its like people stopped thinking and just go with the flow or `` consensus '' , people refuse to ask hard questions and think everything will go away or fix itself magically , it wo n't . 
  2 ) i think this sub has turned * somewhat * into eastern-european circle jerk , with the predominant topic of how russia sucks ass and should burn in hell or how things are terrible here or how we are all doomed . 
  you might as well be right , but the novelty itself dies off with time and its kind a tiring to see 5 news about russia and evil russkies on front page every day , with the usual comment section . 
  to the point of not wanting to comment on any issue at all and just ignoring it all together . 
  3 ) i think european union as an entity is a competitor to the united states , not an ally or a friend and if europe would tie itself up with the likes of ttip and other treaties , it will loose its competitiveness and become a market for american products once again . 
  costs of production and energy resources should be considered as well and europe is lacking in that regard as far as i know . 
  but its not a developed nation !, 
  russian tourism knows no boundaries and we enjoy high end quality and classy resorts as well , lithuania fits and has minorities who can show us the road  see ya in a bit -_-, 
  wow , sounds so nice !, 
  recommend as a vacation destination ? 
  are u pretending to be an idiot or just naturally act this way ? 
  simple question - if i know that i am responsible for a crime and the guys i hurt are now have all the power to do anything they want , without anyone blinking an eye , why in the world would i stay in that named country , only to get the exact same treatment that we witnessed recently coming from ukrainian cases of `` suicides '' ? 
  you do n't have free reign of nazis killing everyone they do n't like , that is true , u just ban every other thought that is not `` true patriotic ukrainian dream '' and harass and assault people , who dare say anything otherwise . 
  if things would continue go the way , they are currently going , u have 3 realistic scenarios . 
  1 ) is the most optimistic one , europe/imf & co `` look the other way '' and continue financing your country , to the point of u guys * actually reforming * and solving the gargantuan amount of problems your economy faces . 
  your standard of life will continue to drop , but u will endure it for `` the dream '' . 
  in like 3 or 4 years u will see signs of recovery , but ur `` baltics ` anization '' ( everything u already did was pretty fast in my humble opinion , but there is more to come ) will create an enormous rift between our 2 nations . 
  ofc it would be championed as `` freeing from tyranny of russia '' , but there will be consequences not only from kremlin , but from russian population attitude as well . 
  2nd is u remain more of the same , take 1 step forward , 2 steps back , a shit ton of people leave ur respective country to find `` a better life '' , ukraine problems are sort a contained , but there is no `` light of hope '' , just more of the same old , same old . 
  3rd option is radical and the most dangerous , since in the event of collapse of current government the most likely party to take power would be * radical nationalist with an agenda , combat training and weapons and ** will ** to use them against anyone , who disagrees with their views * . 
  its somewhat far fetched for now , but if things would not improve and `` business as usual '' continues its course , there will be a `` request/demand '' from society to deal with our problems * by any means necessary * . 
  simple truth is as it was the case in syria , egypt and other arab nations , the ones who are the most prepared to take power in ur country ( after ur government ) , is nationalistic elements with severe case of delusions , fueled by your media space . 
  in this case a real war will break out between russia and ukraine , eventually and its going to be a hell of a ugly one at that . 
  so tell me `` pretty well informed guy '' , lets say : `` i , organized anti-maidan and hired thugs and coordinated them and everything , resulting in other people getting hurt , now that i lost and the guys who i was fighting came to power , i have a great idea - lets stay in the capital city , flooded with people whom i was fighting against have a pretty much free reign and no accountability whatsoever . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? '', 
  realistic my ass . 
  i caught myself on the thought , that you can say pretty much the same about any eastern european / `` central european '' / baltic flag and `` discussion '' involving russia , but then i thought to myself : `` wait a minute , i do n't know the guy , maybe this time its different ! '', 
  after scrolling down a bit and seeing a joke comment by mr.zurfer and your enlightened european response to his flair , i sighed , nodded and laughed a bit , 
  anonymous international , lel . 
  chances of connections to major intelligence agencies are through the roof , it is very convenient to claim that some `` anonymous group '' hacked and released shit , beneficial to particular parties , meanwhile u make a straight face and claim `` that was n't me , it was anonymous/korean hackers/terrorist '' . 
  no matter how smart of a hacker you are , if fsb/nsa/mi6 wants to find u , it will , unless u know all the ins and outs of the `` playfield '' , but in that case u have worked in the field , 
  you are `` hated '' not because you are somehow more progressive than others or anything like that , moscow in many peoples minds associates with power and wealth . 
  rublevka/cooperative ozero and the likes , all the oligarch and all the bullshit usually comes from moscow , since regions otherwise practically have no voice and have to `` follow in line '' with kremlin policy . 
  we ca n't vote for our governors either or they can be `` removed '' at any point in time , caz putin . 
  what pisses people even more is the fact that majority of transportation/logistics/taxes / headquarters of big companies are located in moscow as well , making regional budgets even more poor . 
  so when people hear how moscow is going to build 20 more metro stations in 5 years and poor fuckers somewhere in central russia or syberia get a middle finger , instead of development funds , then yes , a lot of people are going to be pissed off . 
  ( naturally metro is not the only problem , everything from roads to schools to hospitals ) that actually transfers to pretty much anything when comparing moscow/st . petersburg with the rest of the country , the 2 `` capitals '' get a shit ton of money and tax revenue , while others have to `` scrap by '' , because of our wonderful `` vertical of power '' . 
  in this regard the fact that moscow ( kremlin ) not that long ago decided that local budgets now has to give to federal center like 60 % of the taxes and leave about 40 % to themselves ( it used to be the other way around if i remember correctly ) , while at the same time refusing any responsibility for social services and `` privatizing '' shit or giving directives a-la `` may orders of mr.putin '' , ** without ** giving any extra money or weakening the pressure on business pissed a lot of people off . 
  no one gives a shit about how many gay bars do you have or how many hipsters there are on the streets of moscow . 
  piracy , not being able to speak foreign languages/not caring , `` my friends are not there , so why should i ? 
  '' , up until recent times russian analogues were mostly left untouched by the caring hand of the government ( meaning there was more freedom to express yourself , since no one really gave a shit what you post there and stuff like that ; more freedom kind a ) . 
  runet is also a historical space with its own memes , jokes and culture , going back into like 90s . 
  contrary to the popular belief here , russians are not only `` monsters who want to kill us all '' , but they also enjoy a good laugh , funny gif or interesting read ( livejournal and such ) . 
  the fact that the only thing western citizen knows about is that : '' russia bad , dashcam drunktards , insert stereotype here '' only indicates that there was very little of cultural exchange or desire to `` broaden horizons '' from western netizens . 
  you basically live in your own bubble , russians live in theirs , chinese live in their own middle kingdom , etc. 
  alternative view would be russian propaganda spins this `` solving problem '' as blockade of leningrad during ww2 , make parallels of current ukraine + romania as axis and how glorious mother russia has to cut path to `` suffering , oppressed russians , who die from hunger , because of fascists '' . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  merkel wo n't back down , its not an issue on which she can flip-flop and `` give in '' to popular opinion ( and popular opinion in germany afaik is heavily pro-sanctions and wo n't change for quite some time ) . 
  there will be diplomatic dances , lots of talks about dropping sanctions , promises of something to russia `` if russia does this , that and that '' ( and if by some miracle conflict will get frozen/tone down significantly , maybe even parts of sanctions will be lifted , but the majority will stay for a while ) . 
  the thing is , this issue is a leadership test for germans as well , so if they back down , eastern / `` central '' europeans , baltics and a number of other countries would see this as `` betrayal of them and their interest , selling us for russkies dirty money , blah , blah , blah ( insert domestic/internal eu rhetoric to gather votes or rally population for smtn ) .
