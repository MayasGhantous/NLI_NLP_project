  merkel & co repeatedly said that sanctions will be lifted when russia gives back crimea to ukraine and you perfectly know this ai n't happening , so they are here to stay for quite some time and as life gradually becomes worse for everyday russian , we might see some interesting changes from within russian society ( and by interesting , i do n't necessarily mean that it will be beneficial/good for you guys  ) . 
  this is russia we are talking about , we are kind of an unpredictable nation and have a tendency to go to the extremes . 
  which wo n't happen and you perfectly know that as well . 
  so , they are here to stay , 
  why do europeans act like spoiled kids who did n't get their toys , jump on bandwagons so easily and refuse to listen/acknowledge any other viewpoint , that does not fit in their `` dream '' of how it 's supposed to be ? 
  world is a bit more complex than `` hurr , durr , this guy goes against my views/interest , so i hate him and everything that has to do with him or his agenda '' . 
  i do n't like parroting ; learn to think for yourself and try to always put yourself into other person shoes , before you speak out/jump on the hate train ( and if there is a sudden surge of `` interest '' for a particular topic from the msm , you might want to question the views expressed by them a bit , since they all usually sing in unison like a good chorus ) . 
  i call this `` positive reinforcement circle jerk '' , when u ask a question knowing the answer well in advance . 
  here 's my ** asshole ** arm-chair general view on the whole thing : eastern europeans/baltics / `` central europeans '' ( your attempts to distance yourself from eastern european image is adorable poland , just like eesti can into nordic and progressive it/look at us we r sooo futuristic ) are essentially american `` special friends '' or `` allies '' ( essentially cocksuckers , who would do everything * cough send troops to american wars , host cia black sites , etc etc * for sempai to notice them ) . 
  thus the question and the response was predetermined well in advance , i consider this as a form of manipulation and something on the line of `` forming a positive image of american troops stationed abroad '' both domestically and to present europe as a unified front against aggressive russkies-commies-threat . 
  hell , you can probably show this topic to grunts going there ( who might wonder or question if they are wanted there or how safe it is there ) , telling them : `` look , they love us there !, 
  we got ta protect the little guys , caz we r number 1 . 
  usa !, 
  usa !, 
  usa ! '', 
  in a way i consider this pathetic , but i can understand the reasoning and the motive behind this topic in general as part of information campaign , which quickly found its audience on / r/europe . 
  russian internal politics right now is an object of constant surveillance , since there is a clear interest from the west for a change from within russia . 
  creating martyrs from washed up politicians with no base support , is not something someone , who was for 15 years more or less ruled the country , would do . 
  and even going by `` ponyatia '' , killing someone for name-calling is `` bespredel '' . 
  dictators are also interested in self preservation and creating martyrs during times of economic downturn and confrontation with the west is not the smartest thing to do . 
  if i understand that , former kgb with security apparatus behind him most likely understand that as well . 
  do you think world politics is kindergarten or ran by teens during puberty period with hormone disorders ? 
  of all the theories i 've heard who and why did it , this one has got to be the stupidest of them all . 
  how many people entered on year to year basis comparatively to a western border to describe this as `` campaign to destabilize eu/finland '' ? 
  this could be anything ranging from organized crime/siloviki ( and they are pretty chummy with each other ) trying to earn a buck all the way to a political bargaining chip since our relations with west are generally shit anyway , so `` we do n't have to cooperate on things we have nothing to gain from and if u want for this to stop , u might want to give us smtn of interest in return '' . 
  refugees/asylum seekers are a problem and russia logically wants nothing to do with it ( same game of hot potato europe enjoyed so much last year ) , so such behaviour is not surprising tbh : / lets be real here , eu needs to get its shit together and it does itself more harm than any `` possible ochestrated russian efforts '' just like russia 's worst enemy are policies implemented by russian state and not some cia conspiracy sleeper cells -_-, 
  and when they wo n't find jobs or `` promised paradise '' as was advertised by either their fantasies or smugglers and face a potential threat of deportations + little to no opportunity to find a spouse or someone of opposite gender interested in them ( well , duh , they have no jobs , no prospects , a questionable system of values and live in a legal limbo ) , they will `` disappear '' , but not entirely , u will see a surge in `` gangs of arab/north african origin '' and crimes associated with that . 
  or join isis , that is an option as well , since `` west hates us and our way of living , they are islamophobes !!! '', 
  but hey , there is always a possibility for a miracle , right ? 
  another day , another step further from civilized world towards a bright north korean future . 
  hooray !, 
  another step of reducing population outrage in case of swift block i guess -_- i wonder how long will it take to promote the system and start a new war without `` holding back for silly reasons such as economics '' for stronk russia . 
  * sigh *, 
  do users in / r/turkey mention the fact that top turkish officials were caught scheming a false flag operation in syria a couple of years ago or their memory is a bit vague ? 
  or do they mention the fact that somehow isis and all other `` beatiful freedom fighters '' get into syria overwhelmingly via turkey and * everyone * knows that ? 
  same goes for weapons smuggling obviously for various `` groups '' there and all the criminal activity that goes along it - illegal arms trade , oil smuggling etc. 
  i love the recent narrative of `` 70k moderate rebels '' , 2-3 months ago , syria had 4 or 5 trained moderate guys on the ground and a shit ton of academics and policymakers stated repeatedly how syrian `` moderate opposition '' is practically a non-factor on the ground there , but now somehow they have a standing army as soon as russia joined in . 
  brilliant . 
  as far as im concerned , people who cut off heads only on thursdays instead of every day of the week are not that much better that isis , but hey , freedom . 
  as far as `` humanitarian convoys '' go , well , i already mentioned what those convoys really are and its not a secret for anyone just like russias actions in ukraine . 
  let me remind u that for all intents and purposes regardless how general west feels about assad or how syria 's neighbours want to see the country , he is an elected president of the country and russia was ** invited ** to operate in the country , which gives our actions there all the legitimacy in accordance to international law , thus if turkish airplanes decide to visit syrian airspace , russia will most likely shoot them down after recent incident . 
  erdogan does what any politician will do in its place when he gives speech in front of his supporters - tell fairy tales and twist facts for his own personal gain without mentioning the role him and his ruling party played in the conflict , thus - `` we r the good guys , russians are unreasonably overreacting and smell bad '' . 
  i do think that stuff that russia is pulling off is petty and `` borderline emotional '' , but putin & co also has an electorate , for whom he likes to present himself as `` stronk leader '' , thus russia 's actions are somewhat expected . 
  for all intents and purposes this is not a break up of international relationships between the two countries , but a significant cool down . 
  as long as retards who advocate war and demand a `` stronk response '' are silenced , all is within `` norm '' . 
  i wonder if its technically possible to get some barely flying mig or su , remove everything expensive from it ( to lower the costs essentially ) , create a sort of a remote control similar to drone tech and put 2 `` dummies '' who look like humans and blow up the plane in that area remotely with dummies `` ejecting '' . 
  lets say other planes might stick around a bit for authenticity and even some helis might get up to look plausible enough ( but not travel far , so that `` freedom tows and alike '' wo n't get to shine ) . 
  retards in that area would start shooting , scream their allahu akbar and would like to check out their `` spoils/victories '' and this is where either another group of bombers join in on the fun in the area where dummies landed or our new cruise missiles x101s or waever ( do n't remember how its called ) join the party . 
  oh well , probably hard to pull it off or not worth the effort : /, 
  probably the usual , explosives and firearms smuggled from neighboring countries ( people already mentioned central asia as a major security threat ) , travel a bit to `` good enough target '' in one of the cities , do the same as paris/beslan/dubrovka etc. 
  even though russia has like one of the most per capita policemen in the world and our security services can do absolutely whatever they want , with no oversight , its still wo n't be enough , considering the * geography * of russia and its neighboring countries + widespread culture of corruption future terror acts are only a matter of time ; _ ; i 'm sure '' \u0441\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u041c\u0412\u0414 '' ( internal security services cuts ) would be blamed for this `` failure '' and more `` legislation to protect ourselves '' will make its way real quick through our wonderful duma ^_^ tbh i have no idea how can u protect all the schools , universities , hospitals and kindergardens , u ca n't have spetsnaz camping in every building . 
  pl0x answer , im asking for a friend , 
  all 5 of them ? 
  or whoever it is left of 500 million dollar training program . 
  i do n't get it , everyone knows that `` moderate opposition '' is the ** tiniest and weakest ** group in syria for a long time , u.s & co supports the absolute minority group in terms of power or capability to govern , what gives ? 
  our nuclear arsenal . 
  ofc there are still emperor alexander iii words , still true today . 
  i meant ukraine is a foreign / `` patriotic '' war to send promising `` revolutionaries/fighters '' to die or to `` trim the bushes '' so to speak and keep them down . 
  syria is strictly geopolitics , while ukraine is more of a domestic issue . 
  why ca n't people see parallels with syria ? 
  europeans & co dumped their radical unintegrated retards into the bloodbath that syria is and it still continues to serve as a giant vaccuum for all sorts of radical extremists ( primarily islam ) and potential security threats/time bombs . 
  kremlin/ruling elite as u would expect are only interested in their self preservation and nationalist groups is a potential threat for status-quo , thus u use/actively promote conflict in ukraine as a place where their `` dreams of greater russia '' die along with them . 
  i 'm sure every single person out there that fought in ukraine `` volunteer '' or not is on some sort of watchlist and judging by the fate of all sorts of field commanders who has made a name for themselves , none of them will live to tell the tale eventually . 
  its an excellent stategy tbh - people who are ready to fight ukrainians ( previously brotherly nation , blah blah blah ) are not that far off from potentially causing instability within russia , thus u kill 2 birds with 1 stone . 
  communists are part of the establishment since at least 90s . 
  the usual trade off is turkey style deal tourism & other shit , maybe some money or tech or intel thrown towards egyptians . 
  all in all , the usual bs and `` insert excuse here a la rent for 20 years or waever rocks your boat '' . 
  i wonder if his bro was as progressive as he is . 
  what a loss for poland ;( so many cool laws and initiatives lost due to the tragedy :( double time , double effort !, 
  kiev is the capital of ukraine , under `` control '' of poroshenko & co. 
  sometimes some para-military , ex military , right wing groups etc do what they usually do - which is assassinations / `` accidents '' , protests / `` fight '' with authorities to get something they want or get someone out of trouble or pursue their own agenda . 
  isis does not operate on the territory of ukraine as far as i know . 
  setting urself on fire is plausible , if channel had some troubles with ratings or wanted to direct public attention towards it , if people behind it is in clash with someone powerful ( i dunno internal political situation in ukraine , so u would have to ask them for insight on how the things are nowadays there ) . 
  if this level of information warfare confuses u greatly , to the point that u write messages like that , perhaps u should read a couple of books or improve your cognitive abilities . 
  alternatively u can stop reading news , caz your post gives me an impression that u have a what is called '' \u043a\u0430\u0448\u0430 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435 '' `` porridge in the head '' which is a russian expression for chaos in the head ( i dunno english equivalent ) . 
  overall , your `` ability to detect bullshit '' seems a bit on the low part and there is plenty of bullshit everywhere nowadays , with people wanting certain agendas to become mainstream or certain views to triumph over others , so u might to either work on that or follow old testaments like `` cui bono ? '', 
  and `` take things with a grain of salt '' . 
  well , ukraine was with russia for like ~ 300 years , so its not really surprising that their `` quest for national heroes '' grasps for straws or `` peculiar people '' who `` fought for ukraine independance '' . 
  as far as i remember the idea behind dissolution of ussr in plenty of the republics was basically - `` russians suck dick , they are the worst scum on earth and they hold us back , if we free ourselves from them , we will prosper like never before in our history , caz we r so damn awesome '' . 
  for some it worked out well , others not so much . 
  when `` promised land '' did not come for 25 + years and significant parts of your national identity are build upon ideology of intolerance + u have an ongoing conflict and an overall gloomy economic outlook , its quite hard to take a step back so to speak and the usual go-to strategy is simply double-down on yer shit . 
  history does n't really exist in vaccuum and neighboring states and shit they pull on each other provides plenty of historical context why one side decided to fuck over the other ( not that i try to whitewash any crimes commited or not condemn nazi and their collaborators ) during that particular period or another . 
  personally , i think ukraine should find less of an `` interesting character '' to glorify or perhaps try to build up an image of everyday mykola who wants his country to prosper and he does everything in his power to do so ( promote business side , law abiding and so on and so forth ) , but for that u r gon na have to address oligarch / `` respectable people '' i would imagine and i 'm not sure if they are up to that : / bees against honey and all that . 
  does n't work that way . 
  assuming this whole thing is not staged , majority of military initially took a wait and see approach ( pretty common for uprisings in which military is not the direct actor initially ) , in case a shit ton of supporters poured on the streets of turkish cities in `` celebration of removal of dictator blah , blah , blah '' in which case u simply join a `` popular uprising against an usurper islamist fuck and we never liked him anyway yada , yada '' . 
  seems like people either preferred to follow the instructions or simply stayed in the safety of their houses and because media was not under control ( nor erdogan was taken into custody ) , a call to arms was made for his supporters ( democratically elected , akp , 50 % , etc etc ) . 
  when `` civilians '' get on the street , shooting them does not really help your case , especially considering u have failed to show that `` the people '' are also on your side , thus whole thing fell apart pretty fast . 
  * cough ukraine cough * its also worth mentioning that erdogan supporters or benefactors ( islamists and other interest groups ) has lots to loose , in case coup succeeds , thus their desire to `` pour on the streets '' is significantly higher to protect their `` standing '' . 
  as for direct aftermath of the failed coup , its fairly obvious - more power to erdogan and his friends , more control if media , more drakonian laws `` i will make turkey great again '' type of speeches left and right and a moderate witch hunt most likely + lots of empty promises . 
  after 2-3 years u might see another coup , this time better organized and with more support from general population , but i would say chances of `` unstable situation unfolding in turkey '' would be significantly higher this time . 
  nothing out of the ordinary will happen in the matter of days or weeks in turkey , everything follows its logical course , 
  ehm , did n't erdogan placed almost every single news media outlet be it tv or newspaper or whatever under his direct ( or his friends ) control , caz u know mass jailings of journalists , treason charges , raidings of police etc etc ? 
  same as russia more or less or a number of other countries really . 
  thats like relying on rt or other governmental channels/newspapers/media personalities to represent a view different other than established narrative of `` glorious leader will save us all '' : / in any coup , there are a number of critical targets that u should take control of and media outlets ( information control ) most definately have a place in top3 . 
  even freaking bolsheviks took control of telegraph and shit ~_~, 
  russia is a corrupt country . 
  russia is ( was ? ), 
  number 2 destination for migrants/seasonal workers ( primarily from central asian republics aka stans and then some ) . 
  do you want several million central asian ( and others will figure out the `` new route '' quickly anyway , age of information after all ) `` refugees/workers '' on top of what you currently have ? 
  after all , europe pays more i would imagine -_- its kind a like turkey in that regard , although we allegedly share a bit more in common ( even if plenty of `` patriots '' are in denial about that ) .
