  without west ukraine is pretty much doomed to stuff like default and everything that comes after that ( hence you will be paying the bill in dozens of billions $ ) . 
  have you seen the world lately ? 
  or do you mean european war in 2014 ? 
  well , case in point yugoslavia . 
  russian public opinion has a variety of views on everything , but official `` are you for war in ukraine ? '', 
  question got ~ 8 % approval a month or two ago ( consider the amount of propaganda being dumped on russian people and have a little bit respect for russian people ability to be not swayed by bullshit ) . 
  russia is a pretty big place with a lot of different people , make a correlation between population of russia and how many russians participated in ukrainian conflict since the start of ato . 
  you can even take * outrageous * ukrainian numbers like ** half ** of separatists are russians and they rotate every 1 or two months or so ( this is war , no one knows for sure obviously ) . 
  number of separatists also varies from 10 to 20k , no one knows for sure as well . 
  when you do the math , ask yourself what would the ** real war ** look like with full blown russian military invasion * with air support * , with precision missiles , navy , satellites and so on , not artillery barrages and ambushes from `` green line '' ( forests , tall grass and so on ) . 
  separatists consists of a shit ton of parties with a whole variety of views from reconstructors ( people who like some medieval shit action ) , to monarchists , cossacks , a bunch of far right , `` opportunists/criminals '' ( they do commit crimes and get executed by the laws of `` war time '' it seems ) , old military in retirement ( and occasional `` vacationers '' ) , communists or people with leftists views and a bunch of others . 
  `` england has been offered a choice between war and shame . 
  she has chosen shame , and will get war . '', 
  if you need more recent example look no further than iraq and state of its army , constant reports of mass killings by isis of tribal man , yazidi 's and their women being sold into sex slavery and so on . 
  when you read how someone mass executes hundreds of combat ready men i kind a wonder , why would you not take ak in your hand together with your neighbors at least and defend yourself ** and your family ** . 
  at least you would die protecting something which you hold close to your heart and would not feel regret/remorse when someone puts a gun next to your head or rape your woman in front of your eyes . 
  does that answer the question ? 
  probably nothing good on the official government channels , you know the drill ; regardless i do n't need constant media coverage to formulate my opinion of it and whether it should exist or not in the first place . 
  there is that simple thing like - ask yourself how europe would look like tomorrow if european union is gone and where exactly a lot of countries both big and small would stand on world stage . 
  thats an easy one , if economy overall is doing good/better , then more civilized approach for corrupt politicians & like , if not - `` english ties '' , french know-how and so on . 
  are ukrainians that delusional or something ? 
  russia would rather see the world burn in nuclear fire , than let itself be divided by anyone . 
  there is a significant lack of appreciation how * relatively peaceful * soviet union dissolved , i doubt it would happen again in the same way as it did before . 
  `` it does not matter what the actual opinion of people is '' how democratic of you  i am sure that this sentiment is widely shared among ukrainians as well , just to point out to your previous argument about referendums and kiev readiness to acknowledge it  on a topic of tragedies , sooo what was the tragedy in georgia in 2008 and why it was n't sanctioned into oblivion ? 
  looked like a forced change of border and attempt of annexation , but ukrainians widely supported it at the time , sent buks & stuff and did a bunch of other `` funny business '' . 
  i remember very well the informational background of that war and ukrainian media and government stance at the time ( together with their friends from eastern europe + baltics ) . 
  what was the tragedy of 2014 scottish referendum ? 
  no one was suffering from civil war afaik , but they still did it without any major tragedies , what gives ? 
  what is an upcoming tragedy of catalonian referendum ? 
  are they in a state of civil war as well ? 
  from my bell tower , it looks like this : in international relations it seems that status quo is being supported only if it fits western interests ( * cough * for example gulf states * cough * ) , if not - democratically or not so leaders are being ousted , countries bombed into oblivion/stone age , chaos spread , sanctions implemented . 
  ** if ** something is not to western liking , they change it or assert a significant amount of pressure through economic ( and other covert ) means . 
  cia still exists by the way , together with other 16 or so agencies and an army of ngos , you do n't really think that they ceased their operations around the world , do you ? 
   got ta protect those `` special interest '' and `` american way of life '' , wiki might help you out if you are interested in their previous `` operations '' ( not to say that euromaidan was cia plot or smtn , just to point out that quite often the local `` dissent '' is not exactly what it seems to be ) . 
  what i see is a bunch of `` exceptions '' by icj and quite a hypocritical stance on international affairs , far from being `` honest , transparent or motivated by humanism '' . 
  ofc `` protection of oppressed minorities '' is a bullshit argument , its as old as known world anyway , but the fact that it was almost bloodless and widely supported speak for itself . 
  people wanted it and ** because they could not do it legally ** ( due to ukrainian population political views like you expressed earlier as well ) , they chose * bullshit way * . 
  its a touchy subject for ukrainians , i understand and quite likely seen as `` unfair '' , but there is nothing fair in geopolitics ( especially if they are both supported domestically and locally quite heavily ) . 
  russia is already paying a hefty price for its `` adventures '' and it will continue to do so with unknown , unpleasant , unavoidable consequences for time to come , such is life when you are as weak as current rufed is . 
  well , russia `` seized the opportunity '' or `` did not let crisis go to waste '' , but the underlying notion remains - people ** legally ** voted at least ** twice ** through * democratic processes * and were told to go fuck themselves . 
  if you ca n't achieve your goals through legal means what else remains ? 
  what makes you think that ukraine would have acknowledged the results of 3rd referendum or did not tried to influence it the same way `` polite green man '' allegedly did ? 
  central government in kiev was weak and disorganized/state of chaos , crimeans took an opportunity ( with help from `` polite green men '' ) and voted the fuck out of ukraine . 
  is it that hard to grasp ? 
  if in result of `` occupation and annexation '' only 1 person died in questionable circumstances , maybe popular support was still there and people were not threatened by the machine guns next to their head ? 
  well , people love here bringing up `` salami tactics '' . 
  is n't this what they are doing anyway ? 
  little by little , acre by acre settlements being built , water resources taken control of and all the other israelian state problems being taken care of . 
  then we hear `` words of condemnation '' from europe/u . s -  project close to completion -  rinse-repeat with occasional bombing campaign or two . 
  http://russialist.org/number-of-russians-ready-to-support-putin-in-presidential-polls-falls-from-66-to-38/ `` age of shitty numbers '' , but since r/europe loves levada, 
  you mean like in 1990s when they had ** two ** and basically were told to go fuck themselves by kiev ? 
  you can give a political spin to pretty much anything nowadays . 
  what is more likely - fifa not giving a shit about crimea and russia-ukraine relations ( i doubt they even bothered to check the video beforehand in relations to peninsula ) or fifa is pro-russian conspiracy group legitimizing annexation of crimea via football related video ? 
  what is their power anyway ? 
  do they have votes in u.n or hold seats in security council ? 
  there is a simple fact , which no one likes to talk about here , but it remains a reality nonetheless , crimea is a russian territory and will remain so in the near future . 
  i will even dare to say that `` general west '' would not give a shit about it either , if it was n't for south-east `` vacationers '' and the related regional/geopolitical troubles/instability that they bring in regards to eastern europe/nordics . 
  last 15 years kind a indicates that this is exactly what is happening , whether to agree with such course of action or condemn it is a different matter , but `` might makes right '' is * the * modus operandi lately . 
  at least from a perspective of a random russian netizen . 
  you just do n't get it maaan , russia is helping for pilots to keep their jobs , they have families to feed !, 
  `` the moor has done its duty , the moor can go '', 
  if you are scared of full scale invasion , simply imagine the amount of troops required for this , concentration of armor and jets + required informational `` background '' for population . 
  you could see it miles away and have plenty of time to prepare , your biggest enemy would be internal destabilization , which may provide enough `` noise '' for appearance of `` polite green men '' , but even this is waaay different than ukrainian situation ( you guys are in nato , european union and god knows what else local military defence treaty ) . 
  well , crimea was surprising to be honest ( but i guess if we had intelligence daily reports like world leaders have , we could saw it coming ... perhaps ) , everything else was fairly predictable and * logical in its own twisted way * . 
  just do n't judge russia 's actions by some sort of humanism , love for all `` da people '' or `` high morals '' ( none of those exist in politics anyway ) . 
  i can give you at least one region in the world , where foreign jihadis travel to ( from europe by the numbers as well ) , get trained and supplied by a variety of political actors both from the local region and `` kind-a covert , but you know exactly who we are talking about here '' . 
  where is the animosity and tension there , everything is quietly being swept under the rug  its like saying that ukrainians will `` let go/grant autonomy of donbass/lugansk '' , not gon na happen , war will continue in the spring , sanctions would probably stay until next spring/late summer ** at least ** ( and even if they would be lifted for a brief period of time , they would return really fast and in a more severe way , regardless of who 's fault would it be ) . 
  russia will continue suffer economically , population will get angrier by the day , after some time its a fair game - for example , there could be `` ukrainian nationalists-homo-fascist terror acts '' , which usually works as a red rag for angry people . 
  if you are optimistic , maybe putin will quietly dump `` separatists '' and leave them to die , perhaps via `` accidental false intelligence '' . 
  time will tell , as they say , so far winter is coming , whole picture should be more clear by the february or so , both in terms of which path russia will choose and what ukrainians are going to do domestically ( apart from militarizing like crazy and accumulating a shit ton of tech near donetsk/lugansk which is a given ) . 
  a couple of old jokes which often are used nowadays : 1 ) - `` we have improved our standards of living '' , said the government . 
  - `` we are happy for you '' , said the people . 
  2 ) - `` experts claim , that our population is living better than before '' - `` but people say , that they feel no changes at all ! '', 
  - `` thats because they are not experts ! '', 
  there are plenty of russian sites with anecdotes & stuff , you can probably find translated ones either , but its true that its quite difficult to transfer the play of words and context of native speakers . 
  solar system with all moons should suffice i think , then russia - satisfied !, 
  doubtful , open military conflict will most certainly lead to nuclear exchange , which no one would want . 
  economical dominance is more likely , since putin & his friends seem to embrace the idea of chinese partnership ( questionable deals with unclear profit for russian population ) . 
  there would be plenty of indications/actions of aggressive china in south-east asia first , sort a like japan pre-ww2 . 
  so far russia seems more than happy to sell resources for scraps , why would china want to change anything , if `` spice keeps on flowing '' with not that much of a fuss ? 
  china is an important trading partner !, 
  ( we are too scared to say anything otherwise about tibet , dalai lama dude and so on just like west stays quiet about the matter  ), 
  so far we are bribing them or have a significant grip on their immigrants/elites , who knows what future holds though , 
  russia like snowy wasteland , russia ... take ? 
  russian population support for war with ukraine was ~ 8 % ( with all the propaganda , pretty remarkable ) . 
  even if we were to adopt a ** crazy ** idea that like half of `` separatists '' in south-east are russian troops , the overall number with all the rotation every other month or so would be around 30k . 
  ( given that usual estimate of `` separatists '' numbers varies from 10 to 20k ) . 
  russia has a population of 146 million people , 30000/1460000 = 0,02 % of population actively participated in the conflict ( and this is extremely generous , borderline * ukraine level of estimates * ) . 
  how come simple math does not add up with what you are saying ? 
  how come you think that bulgarians , romanians , baltics or poles are fine , objective and level headed european citizens , but russian want to literally kill everyone ? 
  how come soviet union in height of cold war did not nuked the world during cuban crisis and the level of antagonism back then was way , way higher than nowadays ? 
  there is a significant difference in semantics what exactly russians might support ( and i would argue the 80 % number is bullshit in itself due to variety of reasons ) , but even if i were to take your statement at face , russians might support putin as a sole political figure on our whole political field worth listening to or supporting , * everyone else is not trustworthy at all * . 
  look past a bunch of stupid numbers in the age , when they are being manipulated or affected one way or another almost on a daily basis ( you are from europe , you should be aware how unemployment being constantly redefined , how gdp/gni being retroactively recalculated and so on ) . 
  there are three kinds of lies : lies , damned lies , and statistics ( \u0441 ) why do you give so much credit to numbers in the age of manipulation ? 
  ah , yes , sorry i bothered . 
  i forgot what sub this is and that russia is a barbaric horde hell bent on world conquer and killing everyone , apologizes enlightened citizen of rome , i 'll go back to my cave . 
  what if you were to create something like a political tv show with 2 opposing viewpoints being presented by a number of experts and counter-arguments for each other ? 
  sort a like , what if you were actually educating people about the issues they are supposed to be engaged with , instead of separation - `` they have their lives , we have ours '' ( and we have a right to be stupid ! ) . 
  do n't you see a certain problem here , especially with regards to involvement of young people in politics and formation of new policies/ideas ? 
  i mainly ask , because i live in russia and shit here is ridiculously disfunctional with what it feels like 2 parallel universes existing , one is power and their fucked up cloud castles ( where everything is great ) , the other is normal people who just wish they would fucking choked on a huge dick and die with their initiatives and new laws/taxes .
