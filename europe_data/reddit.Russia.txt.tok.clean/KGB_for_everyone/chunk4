  i gave you 2 examples of ** actual battles ** of soviets vs japan ** before ** world war 2 , china was already ** occupied ** ( 500 million + people lost to a bunch of islands in pacific ocean , how come ? ), 
  there were a ton of indication that japs were itching to fight and have their share of `` lebensraum '' , look at the map of asia and look how close sakhalin , vladivostok and khabarovsk to them are . 
  this was an undeveloped , backwards region with little to no people and production , defending this piece of land would be a nightmare , if japs somehow cut off trans-siberian railroad . 
  soviet navy was almost non-existent in pacific region at the time and if you would like an example of russia failing miserable , look no further than russo-japanese war of early xx century . 
  you put too much emphasis on a random piece of paper and completely ignore what they represent and what the * mood * was at the time . 
  the reason i brought spanish civil war was again to show the readiness of the so called `` allies '' ( in form of soviets and nazi 's ) to fight with each other and fund the other side . 
  by your logic , soviet union was an ally of united states during vietnam war , because soviets financed and gave equipment to north , united states was on south side ? 
  do you see how silly the argument is ? 
  i am saying that soviet leadership was ** forced ** to sign mrp , ** because of all the shit previously combined in one huge menacing picture ** for the existence of it . 
  soviet union was alone in the world , surrounded by `` fascist friends '' with quite a peculiar ideology and views on slavs . 
  the countries that were annexed was as you said earlier ** a buffer ** or a collateral , something that made perfect sense at the time if you were to get off your mighty moral horse and look at the global disposition of forces at the time . 
  make it so , that soviets did not occupied those regions , how many days would baltics and eastern europe last against nazi military machine ? 
  how many months did france last , a military powerhouse at the time ? 
  netherlands ? 
  norway ? 
  france was also considered a continental powerhouse at the time , together with britain , how much did they last and what would have happened to uk if la manche was not there ? 
  and that was a 1 front war , without japan possibility of joining in on the fun . 
  when people talk about how strong soviets were , i ask them , why with all the military might ** in 1941 ** within a summer campaign nazi 's were that close to moscow ? 
  what if war started in 1939 then , when soviets did not had those t-34s and production base being built everywhere in * extreme rush * . 
  never did i said that ussr was benevolent or invaded poland out of goodness of its heart , ( to protect minorities if it rocks your boat ) this was a typical bullshit excuse used by many , many countries before to achieve their strategic goals and give some form of * legitimacy * to their claims ( at least in eyes of domestic population ) . 
  people generally do n't like wars and dieing , but if you brainwash them or say that you `` protect your countrymates abroad '' you might have a different `` more understanding '' population . 
  poland and baltics were a buffer to move the border several hundred kilometers from soviet union , geopolitically it made perfect fucking sense in the same way how soviets wanted to move the border with finland in regards to st.petersbourg . 
  there are no morals or feels in global politics , just cold blooded calculation and what was the best for your country . 
  baltics and poles in that regard were victims of circumstances , surrounded by * far stronger * entities at the time . 
  by eastern europeans i mean the likes of romania , hungary , slovakia and others , hence i gave you a list of fascist countries in europe . 
  romania was doomed to join because oil that was 99.9 % , hungary = trianon + plenty of other reasons in regards to say ukraine , slovaks had their reasons as well . 
  look at alliances and global situation at the time , soviets had ** zero ** friends in the world . 
  i do n't know if we need to agree with each other necessarily , all i was advocating about that there were plenty of reasons to sign mrp and delay the war in soviet leadership mind . 
  understand a simple thing - ** no one gives a shit about morals , human rights or someones territorial integrity in face of looming war ** . 
  writing on the wall was already there , all the signals indicated at potential of huge conflict in europe , to accuse soviets in looking out after themselves being the `` commies/reds '' they were , is insulting to soviet diplomatic and intelligence services . 
  by 1939 axis was pretty much formed and was looking for targets so to speak , given mine provided historical dates here is japan testing soviets http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet\u2013japanese_border_conflicts#battle_of_lake_khasan 2 paragraps only . 
  soviets fought against nazi 's in spanish civil war , was it also nothing to write home about ? 
  even if i were to took your argument at face value , are you seriously accusing soviet leadership of looking out for its own interest in context of munich agreement ? 
  those stupid soviets wanted to delay the war as far as possible , how dare them !, 
  only patrician brits and french can have a privilege of watching 2 nations butcher each other , how dare they look out for themselves !, 
  `` soviet union was strongest military power in the world ? '', 
  really , dude ? 
  winter war ring any bells ? 
  the state of soviet aviation and tanks at the time was pretty pathetic , not to mention the fact that soviet union ~ 10-12 years ago was an agrarian society and was in the middle of industrialization and relocation of former peasants into cities . 
  what you are writing for me is borderline crazy and right there with `` stalin was preparing to attack hitler , but hittler was too fast ! '', 
  as for support , japan , italy , a number of eastern european states would suffice , without lend lease , all alone on international stage ( and in a possible war on 2 fronts ) soviet union had not that much of a chance of winning and even if it somehow magically achieved such a feat , there would be way more than 27 ** million ** lost lives . 
  i was clearly talking about legal acts of occupation of sovereign countries , but if you want to talk about moral aspect then yes , what soviet union did with deportations and killings was * horrible * , but what exactly these crimes against humanity had to do with responsibility of soviet union for starting ww2 ? 
  i will say it again , to clarify wtf i was talking about earlier - soviet union is being accused here of essentially being in collusion with nazi germany to start ww2 , it is being ** equally ** as blamed as nazi 's , with * zero * mention of events ( and nations ) that led to mrp and its secret protocols . 
  i call such approach bullshit and having very little to do with geopolitical reality at the time . 
  read up http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-comintern_pact for example and tell me in the face that mrp was wrong in context of 1938 munich agreement . 
  and on what basis are you making that assumption given the fact that * anti-comintern pact * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-comintern_pact was signed in ** 1936 ** by japan and germany ? 
  but i 'll bite anyway : `` uhh , without munchen agreement of 1938 / occupation of chezhoslovakia/allied negotiations breakdown , soviet union would not signed mrp , let alone invaded poland . 
  do you see a certain timeframe pattern here ? 
  and here is for your notion about germany being the sole fascist regime in europe at the time http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_fascist_movements here is some more if you have time http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fascism#world_war_i_and_aftermath_.281914.e2.80.931929.29 ( if you do n't , pre ww2 and ww2 part would be enough ) if you are interested , read in wiki about spanish civil war especially the part which side supported soviets and nazi 's . 
  germany behaved extremely aggressively and revanchist-like prior to any of the events in eastern europe taking place and they had their reasons for it ( mostly economical and bitterness over treaty of versailes ) . 
  you honestly think that they would hit the brakes and said : `` sorry , we were wrong , lets all be friends ? '', 
  mein kempf was published years ago , society already formed their views and propaganda was working day and night to form `` correct narrative '' . 
  its a bit sad for me , that people here think that all those events had nothing to do with mrp or had any effect forming policies throughout the continent , that eventually build up itself as ww2 . 
  have you not read first paragraph ? 
  katyn was a war crime and was condemned by russia as far as i know . 
  or do you want to know why it was carried out ? 
  what katyn has to deal with accusation of `` soviet union started ww2 together with nazi germany '' ? 
  we need some sort of understanding here , what we are currently discussing - war crimes during ww2 ? 
  events that led to ww2 ? 
  consequences of policies that were implemented and carried out prior to ww2 ? 
  my initial response ( which was downvoted into oblivion ) was in response to initial donvito comment , everything else was just to try to portray ** the state of world ** prior and during the events . 
  shit is always complicated , even now , hence my questioning of `` legitimacy '' of this viewpoint . 
  never did i advocate that killing thousands of people were ok or that i supported it , the only thing that i can do is only ** speculate ** what were the motives and how much was driven by idealogy , desire to punish/get rid of `` unnecessary elements '' and so on . 
  but katyn on a scale of events that led to ww2 , had pretty much nothing to do with it , hence i am puzzled . 
  russia is a god of viral videos . 
  we own liveleak , we monopolized dash cams ( even with footage of meteors falling out the sky ) , we are as fucking crazy as you get . 
  i never whitewashed or justified war crimes of soviet union , what i never understood was the `` soviet union and nazi germany started ww2 '' argument . 
  for me it is factually and fundamentally wrong and molotov ribbentrop pakt and soviet union occupation of poland and baltics was years in the making by a shit ton of parties involved , but all of them get close to zero mentioning nowadays . 
  for me personally , this is rewriting of the history and quite a dishonest position to be taken . 
  so when people write that molotov-ribbentrop pakt was a grand plan of stalin and hitler dividing europe to their liking with dreams of world conquest together , my eyebrows are raised and i wonder what kind of drugs are they doing ? 
  very simple question - if what soviet union did was that wrong , terrible , outrageous - how come united kingdom and france did not declared war on it ? 
  surely an ally of nazi germany ( as people advocate here ) would be an enemy of the `` free world '' and declared and denounced immediately ? 
  why is everything is so simple and black and white there , i do n't get it ; why do people ignore historical context i do n't get either . 
  this is such a complicated historical topic and so many little things and decisions led to ww2 , but the `` dumbed down redditors version of events '' is annoying as hell . 
  i understand that eastern european/baltics position in regards to soviet union has plenty of valid reasons and negative experiences , but what i never understood , is how people completely ignore everything that happened prior to the * start * of ww2 , sort a like its just happened out of the blue with zero `` developments '' in the past . 
  coincidentally , current financial crisis did not materialized in 2008-2009 , it was 30 years in the making , but not many people talk about it , since there is very little in regards to actual policies or alternatives to `` debt economies '' . 
  to put it on simple terms , if i were to break a couple of your fingers ( or your brothers fingers ) , spit in your face and express what i think about you and your mom , but revisit you a couple of years later and start to wonder `` why you do n't like me ? '', 
  i think the answer would be fairly obvious . 
  to pretend that general west was extremely friendly towards soviet union since its establishment and did nothing wrong is dishonest . 
  events happened , decisions were made , ideaologies collided and as a result we got ww2 , not because hitler and stalin met up and decided to split up the world between them . 
  this is all i was advocating , * something else apart the circlejerk * . 
  option number 1 - sign the pact * after * munchen 1938 treaty and prevent war for a couple of years ( with all the prospects of japan joining in on the fun , may i remind you axis existed and japan did tried to poke soviets at the time ) . 
  basically , have more time to prepare defences and increase military readiness of troops , increase production and so on . 
  option number 2 - do not sign the pact and go to war with nazi germany , while france , britain & others look how germans and russians slaughter each other , with a possibility to later join in on the fun `` for spoils of war/come late to a party '' . 
  ( possibility of war on 2 fronts was also there ) or if you are cynical enough , join in on the side of the country which was loosing , so that other one would not get `` too stronk '' , meanwhile supplying them both and making a fortune . 
  you are a soviet leader , choose your poison . 
  what is best for your country ? 
  which view is represented on a bigger scale in west/reddit ? 
  i do n't know about you , but i see about 95 % of posts in regards to ww2 with : `` soviet union + nazi germany has started world war 2 '' type of comments . 
  goes hand in hand with narrative `` russia - bad , fucking barbarian horde , if only they would did everything we want and never opened their mouth or opposed us , life would be sooo great ! '', 
  so , because brits were not met with fierce resistance and partisan movement , invasion of sovereign country which was not part of the axis is totally fine ? 
  how about sinking other country 's navy because `` napoleon might have got it '' ? 
  the difference was the fact that poland and soviet union/russian empire had * quite a history * prior with poland including pilsudski `` adventures '' in ukraine during russian civil war . 
  to ignore international relations before and the global `` balance of power '' so to speak is a bit weird in my opinion . 
  countries always pursue their national interest , it is a natural state of things . 
  no one bothered with morality or some sort of `` codes '' prior to ww2 ( except maybe with chemical/bioweapon , but then again , japan was nuked twice so i do n't know which would be worse ) , hence `` detention facilities '' for `` potential 5th column '' in a variety of countries ( including canada , united states and others ) . 
  to judge soviet union actions by 21st century standards and ignoring or belittling the events * and actors * that ** led to the situation ** at all , is disingenuous and have very little in common with accurate picture of the world at the time or prior to it . 
  for modern people like us - idealogies , class struggle and capitalism vs communism sound stupid and something distant . 
  for people of that time - empires were a real fucking deal , india was a british colony , a shit ton of worker rights or social institutions did not exist , womens could not vote and many , many other stuff . 
  to ignore the fact , that 70 + years ago ** world was different on a fundamental level ** makes for quite an inaccurate world picture and generalizations like donvito expressed ( and which are quite popular on this sub it seems ) .
