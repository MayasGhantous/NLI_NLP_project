  this is my personal opinion , obviously , but i always try to look at things in context with prior development , not on a `` spherical horse in a vacuum '' . 
  even current russia did not materialized overnight , it had quite a history and the single most damaging factor would be 90s style of democracy if i were to make a call , but there were other events of course , so its always * not that simple * . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_civil_war#other_factions read up , it was relatively close to your country and should provide a couple ideas about `` cooperation and friendship '' on the continent at the time . 
  its not that much really . 
  nazi 's killed by low estimates * only jews * of 4,8 ** million ** , you are saying `` many times higher than what nazis did '' . 
  how many more and please do show on demographical graphs the representation of `` soviet union literally killed everyone ! '', 
  this is a subject of heated academics debate with quite a number of `` interested parties '' to represent `` correct version of history '' . 
  please , do tell , who is more right in your opinion ? 
  what i asked or advocated about was , not : `` lets say that soviet union did no wrong and it was the greatest thing ever happened in history '' , but the desire for historical justice , not `` hurr , durr , soviet union and nazi germany started ww2 , they are the worst , everyone and everything else had nothing to do with it ! '', 
  i am saying that a variety of events , experiences and developments led to the conflict and presenting the issue as `` adolf and stalin got together and decided to split poland and invade everyone around them '' is fucking retarded and has nothing to do with how geopolitics work in * any historical period * . 
  british empire had no other way , than to invade iceland !, 
  british empire = nazi germany = soviet union . 
  case solved , right ? 
  ah , this is so simple !, 
  someone bothers to ask for your opinion about events prior to ww2 and asks for your evaluation of those events and what impact they had on soviet union , its people and political leadership , but this is too complicated . 
  i am so sorry that i dared to suggest that prior events and relationships/experience might have something to do with molotov ribbentrop pact and division of poland . 
  being an edgy ~ 20 year redditor old sure have its perks , too bad soviet leadership was n't as smart as you , but then again , they actually fought in wars , saw with their eyes `` friends from west '' invading their country and how they `` negotiate '' and `` deal '' with weaker countries ( being empires pursuing their national interest and all that jazz ) . 
  keep drinking you kool-aid of `` correct version of history '' , i have nothing to talk with you about . 
  jokes about persons mom in russia can lead to broken bones and visit to a doctor , this is simply a cultural difference , granted its not always as extreme as this , but the general attitude is quite different from western one . 
  i am aware of secret protocols of molotov-ribbentrop pact . 
  please do answer me about the share of responsibility of allied nations prior to division of poland . 
  please give an evaluation of allied invasion of russia during civil war . 
  please give an evaluation of american & other capital financing of nazi party and nazi germany prior to ww2 . 
  please give an evaluation of red brigades and allies actions during spanish civil war with well known participation of luftwaffe ( or whatever it was called back then ) . 
  please give me an evaluation about soviet union being unrecognized until 1933 by united states for example and you can read about molotov-ribbentrop pact in last paragraph here https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/ussr please give an evaluation on poland position on regional security and their `` stance of movement of troops '' for regional stability . 
  please give an evaluation about division of czechoslovakia in which poland also took part ( and did not condemned it as far as i know at the time ) . 
  please give an evaluation on `` peace of our time '' and the stance that france and britain took towards soviet union proposition to form an alliance against nazi germany . 
  since we are on the topic of invasions anyway , give an evaluation of occupation of iran during ww2 for lend-lease , united kingdom iceland `` adventures '' and so on . 
  please open the 1939 map of the world , look at it very closely and then ask yourself `` how come i judge soviet union actions based upon 21st century standards/morals and give zero mentioning about imperial powers at the time , completely ignoring their role and using a shining example of generalization ? '', 
  as for as equally as bad soviet union , please give me an equivalent of generalplan ost or jew extermination campaign by soviet union . 
  they are the same , you say , so give me an example of state sanctioned genocide campaign with the clear goal of extermination of a race or a nation . 
  when you do all that , ask yourself why did you used `` yeah , after they started the war together with their buddy adolf ... '' and maybe you could come to an understanding why i was so pissed off and why this sentiment for any educated russian is beyond annoying and borderline rage inducing . 
  i agree that history cares little about random person feelings , but i am positive that revisionism , over-simplification and generalizations are its mortal enemy . 
  the more people write like you , the less history has anything to do with facts or contexts . 
  granted this is reddit and / r/europe , so comments like yours would be always upvoted since `` the enemy is clear and he is right there , on our eastern border ! '', 
  and u are saying this based on what exactly ? 
  you still did n't answered to the first part , btw , i am interested in hearing your opinion , since you wrote : `` yeah , after they started the war together with their buddy adolf ... '' i have seen plenty of comments like that and they piss me off probably the most out of anything that people write online , including involvement of people 's relatives . 
  and what was all that chezhoslovakia business about , `` peace of our time '' , british + french negotiation positions with soviet union and all that jazz ? 
  a series of unfortunate events which had nothing to do with war , right ? 
  it was all about great buddies adolf and stalin , together they gathered and decided to start ww2 , right ? 
  are u implying that soviet union was the same as nazi germany ? 
  ( ignoring everything that has happened prior to the conflict including civil war and allied intervention + idealogical confrontation of commies vs capitalists ? ), 
  illarionov is the same for me as zhirinovskii same as nemtsov same as yavlinskii and a number of others . 
  combined with . ua its probably 95 % + someone talking out of their ass . 
  goes in line with seeing moscowtimes as a source = 99 % of russia is horrible and we are doomed , abandon all hope and so on . 
  after a certain amount of time you just stop caring and ignore the outlet right away . 
  not really , id say the downfall is too quick and overwhelming . 
  somehow i have a bad feeling about this : / ( call it a gut feeling if u want ), 
  takes notes - `` pretend to be delivering euromonies for stealthy into baltics '' . 
  russia you are of genius !, 
  its a complicated ever changing system of values . 
  is greenland profitable for denmark ? 
  there are plenty of reasons to keep crimea in russia 's hands , a lot of history there as well . 
  it is a valuable asset and if russia wants to keep it that way , we are going to have to open our wallet  nothing comes for free, 
  was n't one of the main reasons finland breakaway from russian empire was the said policy ? 
  reasons for acknowledging might be that russia can admit its mistakes , even it would take a century  ( something that is missing in established russian world image , sort a like other countries in the world condemned colonialism and wiping off indigenous populations across the globe ) its just a random idea anyway , i agree that airspace/threatening part is counter-productive . 
  belarus is 4 times smaller and ukraine gives me personally a vibe of financial black hole ( in regards to outstanding corruption ) , so i doubt we could afford it on any mid-long term life span . 
  targeted influence would be way more effective and beneficial , ( at least it might have created a force opposing euromaidan or something ) u.s does what it does because its immensely rich and powerful with control of worlds reserve currency , too much depends on them and their market , for others to try to fuck with them in any serious way . 
  well , not doing anything is not an answer either  so at least its something . 
  i do wonder about russian foreign policy in regards to ukraine - what was it ? 
  they are too dependent on us economically , so `` where the hell are they going to from a submarine '' ( russian expression of '' \u041a\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0442\u044b \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0448\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0438 '' ) ? 
  we are making dirty deals with their oligarchs , so everything is fine ? 
  we control them through gas/banks/industry and they are not a real country ? 
  some people express the opinion that what russia should have done was bribe not the entirety of ukraine , but establish a bunch of pro-russian ngo 's and formulate a clear pro-russian narrative/bias through various programs , cultural festivals , years of russia in ukraine and whatever the other shit that ngo 's do . 
  also buy every single media outlet in ukraine is crucial , raise pro-russian journalists in ukraine if necessary ( following in you know who 's steps  ) . 
  perhaps create a series of propaganda films or tv series to further advance our goals there . 
  as it stands , clearly it was n't enough . 
  i do think we give a shit ton of money and trade privileges to belarus though , so there 's that ( i fail to see the return though , lukashenko talks a lot but in delivery aspect he is not a role model ) . 
  as for airspace , i personally do n't care , military does what military love to do - posturing , look important , train , detect response times and so on . 
  sort a like intelligence have their little `` spy games '' , military has theirs . 
  no , simple matter of money and pride - russia apologizes -  russia is an occupant and has to pay a shit ton of money for `` suffering victims '' and be ashamed for its actions . 
  if this happens i believe the list is 15 countries long with plenty of `` poor relatives '' to go around . 
  domestically this would be a political suicide and a case of russians going bananas whoever proposes such a thing . 
  there would also be plenty of legal questions like security council membership for `` war crime nation '' or crisis of national identity ( russia still has plenty of soviet era infrastructure/production lines , legacy on which we live and supposed to be ashamed of ? ), 
  there are reasons why nations that occupied others/colonized them , almost never acknowledged responsibility or desire to pay up immediately after the exit ( germany is an exception ) . 
  the wound is too fresh i think and russians will never accept such steps in nearest couple decades at least . 
  ukrainian european union membership is pretty much a game over for russia 's dreams of eurasian union or having any significant influence in ukraine ** over time ** . 
  russia 's capital and influence would erode away * either way eventually * , the difference would only be in speed only -  thus the destabilization / `` adventures '' of vacationers . 
  russia might have consolidated various political entities in ukraine in its anti-russian sentiment of `` foreign invader '' , but single national identity does not necessarily mean that you will succeed and overcome all obstacles along the way . 
  russia will have plenty of `` sticks into wheels '' prepared for you and its doubtful that you will be left alone to your devises . 
  i would dare to say that pro-russian sentiment would be silenced in ukraine either way ( regardless of crimea/south east ) after yanukovych was ousted . 
  russia had no chance for influence or someone with even remote chances of winning in upcoming elections , thus ukraine would be lost either way for at least 1 election term of ~ 5 years or so . 
  in that time frame ukraine * with help of west * possibly could achieve european union membership status being approved , their industry , legal and social institutions reformed and distance themselves from russia quite heavily ( nato membership is also a significant factor ) . 
  this is unacceptable for kremlin , especially ** on domestic market ** , successful democratic ukraine is a deadly disease for oligarchs and their friends , thus you must be destroyed . 
  overall , you might have won the battle , but the `` war '' is far from over and its not a military one which is being portrayed in your country 's media , but an economical you should be afraid of . 
  not to say that russia is not adding fuel to the fire with its `` vacationers '' , but war is expensive and it makes reforms quite a challenge , thus its serves * one of * ( there are other i am sure of ) its purpose of making ukraine a fail state . 
  tough times ahead of you , it was known from the beginning , but you 've made a choice and would have to follow the path to the end , good luck , 
  before ukraine i would say russia was not viewed the same way that countries mentioned above did . 
  now i can not say i feel the same way ( and judging by this sub , neither can europeans ) . 
  i highly doubt that apart from brainwashed parts of population ( which you could easily brainwash the other way if you really wanted to establish a certain narrative ) and all the political/diplomatic talk , russian officials view china as some sort of great `` ally '' who help us out of goodness of their heart . 
  china pursues its own interest which is natural , thus a lot of asean countries ally themselves with u.s / regional countries against rising china . 
  more problems will arise in future in central asia thats for sure , but russian officials has more immediate `` threats '' to deal with ( at least in their heads ) . 
  forming coherent foreign policy and building a strong economy/nation is hard and requires a lot of effort , living off `` the pipe '' is way simpler and requires less work + brings more money for their pockets . 
  welcome to russian `` effective proprietor '' mentality . 
  '' \u041a\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430 '' is classified , shush there peasant , 
  an illusion of partner ? 
  ( helps domestically , as well to portray that its not whole relevant world against russia , but some parts are `` abstaining/against '' ) maaaaaybe future possibilities of diversifying our nat.gas / oil trade routes somewhere apart from europe , thus when europe moves away from russian energy sources little by little ( strengthening their negotiation position in result ) russia could also have some other place to sell ( eventually doing the same ) . 
  an alliance of convenience/necessity , rather that of friendship/shared world view . 
  not much room for political maneuvering in russia 's current state , we are * almost * in the corner looking angrily at everyone around us , wondering what next . 
  a lot of what you described has to do with domestic policies and their support by population ( `` how dare those fuckers do anything to us glorious russians !? '',
