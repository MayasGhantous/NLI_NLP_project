  if you imply the last part , then its not like this is unprecedented practice to protect your assets/puppets / `` our guy there '' . 
  human rights violators , people accused of serious crimes at home quite often find shelter in the west in general with the help of * money * , 
  good thing you ca n't read comments on russian/ukrainian from ukrainian sources , on ukrainian news or videos then , its quite a spectacle and `` civilized '' conversation  ( but then again youtube comments are generally shit and internet is a place for shitposting , flame wars in some peoples mind ) . 
  as for ukrainian army , i would agree if ukrainians * had an army * , not rag tag nationalistic batallions with no serious military training or knowledge of `` art of war '' . 
  you need time , money and equipment to properly train artillery , pilots and others , ukraine is lacking in that regard imho . 
  france has denounced united kingdom , 
  he is implying that russia in its evil genius has infiltrated azarov , pshonka and yanukovych as sleeper agents in ukraine decades ago and in its `` genius '' russia has said to those puppets to promise ukrainians a deal to join eu trade agreement , encouraged a notion of association with european union ( to become a member state ) , advised to shoot people on maidan , install draconian anti-protest laws etc etc etc. 
  some ukrainians believe that this is true ... 
  if you are a call of duty guy then : `` the numbers , mason !, 
  what do they meaaan ? '', 
  type of thing . 
  * allegedly * blew up a civilian airliner , investigation is underway afaik ( although initially i thought the same ) . 
  i would like to contest the notion that they do n't care who get hurt in the process though , because the downed liner generated a shit ton of attention and pressure on them . 
  prior to the `` event '' no one really cared about ukrainian conflict , after is quite a different story . 
  ukrainian official statement does not automatically prove that this is the doing of `` separatists '' , in fact if previous statements is any indication , its quite the opposite . 
  stop being a victim of information war , ukrainians bullshit just as much as russians . 
  to literally invade other sovereign states you need a considerable occupation force ( not just 100-200k troops ) + broad-wide support from the population . 
  russian support for war in ukraine was ( last time i checked ) ~ 8 % . 
  that is not to say of all the other shit you will need , including ** extremely rapid ** deterioration of trade and political ties will almost entirety of globe ( even less money , goods , technologies etc ) . 
  as of right now , russia is so-so , kind a stupid and weird in its actions with its * somewhat stealthy * war in ukraine , but nothing really that outrageous or insane as in occupation , deportation and all the other stops . 
  there is a difference in support of putin ( i would argue that 85 % number is bullshit in one way or another , but i ca n't prove it and its just a general feeling that the picture which is portrayed by polls is inaccurate/misleading ) . 
  nonetheless russians may see putin as somewhat ok ` ish figure in our * current political climate * , but there is very little support for actual war . 
  last couple things - 1st i would like to give 3dom a benefit of the doubt in his `` forecast/vision '' and point out that he ( in the same way as i am ) is just a random russian netizen , thus he can easily be just as wrong as any other guy . 
  flair does not give an immediate prove that the person who is speaking is in fact knows what he is talking about or has any sort of `` insider knowledge '' of situation inside russia . 
  if its offensive i would like to apologize , but he states that he wrote a blog , but can not provide proof of that because he is in russia ( which implies he is scared for his life , which is fair i guess ) , but at the same time he is leaving russia from what i can remember for at least half a year already . 
  last point , current russian developments * in my personal opinion * has more to do with crushing local dissent in an ** extremely ** troubled economic times ahead . 
  russian economy is in trouble , has been for a while before ukrainian events , there is * very little * faith in possibility of russian government to solve those problems , thus - standard of life will decrease -  dissent will rise -  you need to prepare to crackdown on protests , internet , civil society , hungry people -  you create a shit ton of oppressive laws , raise taxes on everything and follow a general `` hardline '' all for the sake of preservation of power and money . 
  reputational ? 
  whatever the word , no significant damage for european union image on international scale . 
  in case of ukraine , eu/u . s/imf & co had the incentive to back you guys up because people were dieing under flag of european union and for the trade deal with them , so if you bail out on such `` sacrifice '' ( even if it was unwanted for example ) , you loose face in one way or another . 
  that sort of thing . 
  as of right now , nothing outrageous or really interesting happened in hong kong , so eu prefers to stay quiet . 
  if you would remember arab spring even united states initially claimed quite a neutral position and backed `` revolution '' only after significant violence broke out and some `` stuff happened here and there '' . 
  a natural development for pretty much any political or economical event , the smartest thing is to look how things work out and then `` provide statement '' . 
  name of the source is quite funny in my opinion  nonetheless , there is nothing to gain for eu either economically or politically via backing of the protesters , no considerable reputation damage as of ** this moment ** either . 
  cloud storage for anything even remotely valuable/incriminating is beyond stupid . 
  at least cloud storage guys + intelligence agencies would always had access/means to browse the content . 
  scales of economy and problems accumulated are incomparable imho . 
  you could react , restructure , reform and pull out ahead eventually so fast , because you are relatively small , which means its easier to navigate or achieve consensus between parts of population . 
  big countries = big problems is usually the name of the game . 
  kind a ironic and sad at the same time . 
  europeans wonder why shiites kill sunnis and suicide bomb each other in 21st century , civilized european society my ass : / same cave dwellers with tribal system of identification as 5k + years ago . 
  its probably too late to respond , but anyway - out of pure curiosity what did you expect top european politician ( arguably most influential ) to say publicly : `` we are definately , 100 % going to abandon russian energy supplies effective now ! '', 
  ( you can add `` fuck russia ! '', 
  for contrast as well with middle finger showing to camera for threatrics effect ) and a following up on that question , how would russia react lets say in late september to public denouncation and borderline break of trade ties ? 
  sometimes i wonder about the age of commenters here or their image of how international politics work . 
  its not like nato was not expanding prior to ukrainian conflict or did not had plans for that either : / not that russia has any right to complain though , since we lack in terms of `` positive message '' for the world in any way , shape or form . 
  as it turns out criminal oligarchy with complete disregard for freedom of speech , human rights and other `` useless shit '' is not that popular in the world . 
  who woulda thought ? 
  if you come with friends ( 100k + ) obviously - winter , 
  its not like war would not resume after winter : / ( if truce holds until then anyway ), 
  a tool is a tool . 
  no one expects russian liberation !, 
  ( almost as good as spanish inquisition ) ukrainians certainly did n't see us coming :d, 
  how should i put this ? 
  current russian economic model ( sell recourses , produce nothing ourselves , import a shit ton of essentials ) has reached its peak/very close to it , thus russian standard of life will no longer improve . 
  if you take into account annual inflation in russia of 7 + % , it in fact will decline . 
  ofc this is ** extremely oversimplified ** , but russian economy is in deep shit and first signs of that development were seen even in 2013 before any ukrainian events . 
  at first it would be blamed on sanctions/west/insert excuse here , then when excuses will no longer work/fly with population government will crackdown heavily on any dissent ( whats going on right now is pretty much nothing compared to things to come lets say 4-5 years from now on ) . 
  if you need comparisons - authoritarian state with extreme control from security apparatus , qaddafi , assad and others come to mind , maybe a bit `` lighter '' . 
  the reason i am optimisticly pessimistic is that i have seen how russian government and economical bloc works , what sort of reforms are being implemented , their success rate , accuracy of forecasts , general direction of proposed laws , `` professionalism '' of business & banks + a general idea how population will react to any of the `` new great ideas bestowed on population from olympus '' . 
  pretty much zero faith that anything would be reformed in any meaningful way or that population will embrace any of the changes is a political reality in russia . 
  obviously no one is going to reassess our rearmament programs , dozens of billions of $ thrown into world cups , `` mega projects '' by state-run companies and other `` investments '' . 
  thus russia is destined to fail in one way or another , as russia will grow weaker , geopolitical situation inside and outside of russia will dictate significant changes in russian sphere of influence so to speak . 
  first places to look would be loosing grasp on central asian republics and big troubles in eurasian union ( whatever that thing was called anyway ) . 
  after that its a free-for-all , i can see caucasus being on fire again , if you ask will syberia/far east try to breakaway the answer is no . 
  as for event horizon id say next 5 years is crucial for survival of russia in its current incarnation , if we fail , then i can see same problems that plagued russia in xx century making a spectacular comeback and history might repeat itself  ( so overall a 10 year time lag ) . 
  that russia is an eternal monolithic block with hivemind like system and everyone here wants soviet union back . 
  things are complicated here and our current mental image reminds me of america in early iraq invasion ( silence of opposing views via thuggery methods is also a thing , because russia : / ) . 
  propaganda purposes ? 
  to promote `` more balanced view '' among local minorities which is not originating from kremlin ? 
  overall , a precautionary measure against future appearance of `` polite green men and their supporters '' , although i doubt that anyone will buy any of this shit anymore , but you can never be too safe i guess  not bad from political standpoint either . 
  ** a lot ** of russians act online like xbox kids - obnoxious , loud , rude , constant swearing and mums involved , act extremely stupid/retarded and very often try to ruin the fun for others . 
  normal russians try to keep low profile or communicate not as much and generally try to be less associated with `` them '' . 
  this is basically an illustration of russian : `` the main problem of runet is schoolboys '' . 
  ofc not every single one of them , yada , yada , but you should get the idea - the general cultural level of runet is pretty low , flame wars , name calling , people 's moms involvement , constant negativity etc etc. 
  at least this is my understanding of how westerners feel mixed with my own thoughts . 
  it would be nice if this sub had north korean flair so i could celebrate with everyone the direction in which russia currently is going , 
  is this germany without prussia ? 
  pathetic !, 
  maybe we should lend konigsberg to you for a couple of years , so that instincts would kick in and we could get the party rollin , 
  embrace the dark side !, 
  you know you want to !, 
  paging germany and austro-hungarian empire : `` guys , we got some partitioning to do '' . 
  not bashing russia ? 
  not making ridiculous claims or retarded comments by ukrainian `` officials '' ? 
  russia is not portrayed as a stupid barbarian who is hell bent on world conquer and will claim eastern europe tomorrow ? 
  what is wrong with you op , why ca n't you fit in and discuss the best possible ways to split russia , so that those pesky russians will know their place ? 
  i guess this sub is a simple example how quickly even somewhat educated group of people can change and `` peace of our time '' or `` we are so interconnected in global trade , war is impossible and an unreal thought '' is just wishful thinking/delusions . 
  just like pre-ww1 world , 
  as soon as countries will learn about the `` program '' a number of `` incidents '' will occur , with lethal outcomes most likely . 
  people in power who authorized the decision would either loose everything or have an accident themselves . 
  ukrainian nuclear facilities will be closed down and dismantled/cease to operate + no one will provide nuclear materials either . 
  nukes/bio/chemical weapons are no joke and such activities are closely monitored by all parties involved i am 99.999999 % sure about that . 
  this is not mythical terrorists/vials of anthrax in un by mr.powell , this is serious global security risk and no interested `` party '' would want to deal with ukrainian made nukes/chems/bio weapons on the loose . 
  old history with a lot of bankroll/help by major powers during geopolitical tensions/clash of interest ? 
  nukes are a problem , especially in unstable states , ukraine is far from stable as it is . 
  adding up even more headache and variables into equation of mad is hardly a sound strategy or the one with which major powers ( you can argue here that russia is a banana republic and so on , but we still have operating intelligence services and know-how in nuclear proliferation ) would like to deal with in the future . 
  it also would create a considerable amount of `` complications '' with other states , who desire to acquire `` security '' . 
  general rule of thumb is - `` do not make things harder , than they already are '' or create unnecessary security risks in the future .
