  do n't you think that this is a common sense type of thing ? 
  are you familiar with iranian nuclear program and what `` happens '' to their scientists all the time or their nuclear enrichment programs ? 
  do you think european union , united states or russia will look calmly at you and your `` adventures on the path of science '' ? 
  sometimes i wonder whats going on in heads of ukrainians and their respective officials , what exactly their media is feeding them , so that they think that this is a * viable * option at all ? 
  the reason i even responded to your comment is that i have seen quite a number of ukrainian comments/opinions ( from officials as well ) with similar worldviews and it puzzles my mind how can you even believe that any of that is even remotely possible . 
  sorry if this offended you , its just hard for me to comprehend . 
  if you think that ** any ** center of power will let ukraine develop its very own nuclear arsenal , you are quite delusional in my opinion : /, 
  we love them all equally and those little cyka 's are coming back , whether they like it or not \u0ca0 \u203f \u0ca0, 
  i dunno about that , rebels might find a plane or two in hangars/bunkers/insert excuse here in donetsk airport or ukrainian pilots might `` deflect '' and promptly disappear in fear for his and his family life . 
  you never know with this type of things , 
  russia 's love is unconditional and non-negotiable , 
  russia is ready to help anytime !, 
  just give us a call , 555-liberationfromnazi 's . 
  people read too much into meaningless statistics anyway . 
  this is russia , there are not that many really good and high quality universities in the first place , but a shit ton of `` colleges '' who `` teach '' all sorts of useless shit with extremely poor quality . 
  basically russian education system has turned/have been turning into * for profit organization * for quite some time . 
  pretty much any university has meaningless or stupid courses , like `` business '' , `` economy '' and all the other `` humanitarian branches '' . 
  russia has a lot of people with `` a degree '' , but the quality of those degrees is closer to - attend lectures , pay money and participate in exams & n stuff , congratz you have a degree . 
  of course the fact that almost every single job requires `` a degree '' ( \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 ) by hr is not helping either . 
  naturally a lot of people who attend high quality uni 's have a tendency to leave the country or concentrate around moscow/st . petersburg . 
  all in all its a pretty poor and outdated system , which requires reforms , but in nowadays russia no one is really interested in investing in quality education . 
  even if you do , there is a very good chance that the person who will get one will try to leave for `` greener pastures ''  brain drain is a real deal and people will always look out for their interest . 
  to paraphrase baron vladimir harkonnen : `` who controls humanitarian aid , controls the rebels '' , 
  not in a state of cold war with russia would be nice for starters , though its not * exactly * europe 's fault : / as for eu inner workings i am obviously quite uninformed , but i would like for europe to have contingency plans for potential meltdown of global financial system . 
  something more progressive and forward thinking/oriented , rather than throwing money at the banks or confiscating peoples assets . 
  perhaps a backup plan or two . 
  in terms of where to go , its way harder since no one seems to realize to what type of world we are heading into , thus developing a coherent policy without knowing end game or any of the strategic objectives becomes quite difficult . 
  as to what eu will be doing in 5 years , probably thinking really hard how to handle unemployment and social security net being a burden big enough for economies , to want to do something with it/reform in some way . 
  not a positive one , but the one that keeps `` siloviki '' aka security apparatus pretty happy . 
  take it for what its worth . 
  i know he does n't either , hence my initial remarks about sauron eye in regards to another redditor post . 
  the thing is - we do n't know enough details and what we are currently engaged with is debating on something , of which we have very little of * actual * information . 
  too little facts , too many fantasies . 
  as for intelligence operatives actions i have no idea either , but people do dumb shit all the time , there are also times when you get `` caught up in a moment '' and do n't think clearly/disregard possible consequences . 
  this is people like you and me to an extent , people make mistakes like for example - shooting down a civilian airplane . 
  in cases of someone `` acting outside of their jurisdiction '' and being publicly caught doing it , cases like that are usually handed in private ( as in any other extremely corrupt state ) , with people knowing very little of the details or negotiations taking place . 
  if fsb/svr operatives are at fault here , they would be quietly discharged from the service/get a severe stern letter and possibly start something like a private security agency or something of the sorts , `` honorable retirement '' so to speak . 
  making things public and blowing things out of proportion is frowned upon and considered unprofessional ( i would have to guess ) . 
  russia has an image to maintain and persecuting or selling out its very own intelligence is not the smartest strategy domestically or for morale of other security apparatus . 
  as for chekism and his control of fsb/svr , i highly doubt that he personally oversees every single operation that these agencies are engaged with . 
  after all russian security apparatus is quite big , russia is a big place with a lot of `` troubled regions '' and russia does have other work to do . 
  do you need a sock ? 
  you can give it back some time later , dobby would not mind at all . 
  edit : alternatively - glad to be of assistance , massa . 
  can i get my cornbread and fried chicken now ? 
  master praised dobby , dobby is a happy elf now !, 
  `` dobby is used to poor treatment in this sub , dobby gets it all the time '' ( paraphrasing ) . 
  is there something new on the market ? 
  is n't this is a general representation of russia in media nowadays anyway ? 
  perhaps badly drawn maps with funny smell which confuses the hell out of russian troops is better ? 
  nonetheless , its pretty obvious that i am a backwards barbarian who has no right to sit at the dining table , i will go back to my dog kernel , since `` no russians are allowed '' in the restaurant . 
  permission to go outside , master ? 
  * pulls out tongue in anticipation of fresh air *, 
  how about joining ukrainian volunteers batallions then ? 
  plenty of fighting there and you can be on the forefront so to speak !, 
  but thanks for taking a joke for its face value , obviously only patricians are allowed to make/have fun of others , plebs should know their place . 
  dirty scum dared to open his mouth to roman nobility , `` guards , seize him ! '', 
  bye , polite danish citizen , was nice talking to you ;-), 
  i obviously represent the entirety of russian population right here and not allowed to have fun or respond to insulting insinuations in any way , sorry i dared to open my mouth , this untermensh will go and quietly sit in the corner with vodka and krokodil now . 
  but you were making a clever little joke about russia being a backwards retarded place , who has no place on the world stage . 
  why the sudden change of mood ? 
  how about enriched uranium instead ? 
   delivery is also free and way faster than any other known methods !, 
  stop hurting my feelings i might start to cry ;-), 
  thanks !, 
  see you in 30-40 years , when most of the world easily accessible resources would be depleted and russia would `` remind you how kind you were to us '' . 
  a scramble for resources so to speak and you would not be invited  i am sure this wo n't happen though , since humanity has a history of working together for a common goal and putting aside their differences , right ? 
   okay two points : you asked me `` why is everyone so sure this would end if russia agreed to demands ? '', 
  i told you why ; because the eu are setting the sanctions and they have stated repeatedly that they will lift them if russia accedes . 
  was that question in bad faith ? 
  because now you are talking about imperialism . 
  this is not a logical issue for russia but an emotional one , in russian media this conflict already shifted to a matter of `` prestige '' and if putin & co bends over , it is equivalent of political suicide for him . 
  this is not a matter of how i describe anything , but how * russian public and officials * view ukraine . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  to put it simple , i ** highly doubt ** that your proposal of russia completely pulling out of ukraine and a paying reparations will be accepted by any party involved . 
  i am not going to argue that eu is better for ukraine , since i am not a supporter of russian `` adventures '' in south-eastern ukraine . 
  i posted my views back when euromaidan only started and wondered why we even need them and what are our long term strategical goals or directives . 
  as far as nowadays ukraine goes , i want nothing to do with it , its a country on the brink of economic disaster which will cost an enormous amount of money to fix , i want russia nothing to do with that . 
   if one country invades another and helps destroy parts of it then they should be expected to pay reparations . 
  it happened in world war 2 . 
  it happened to the usa in iraq and afghanistan , costing their economy billions and billions of dollars . 
  why should n't russia pay for invading ? 
  it makes no sense . 
  russia paying reparations is an insult which no russian will * ever * tolerate in russian mindset ( as far as i can tell ) . 
  not going to happen . 
   let me put this in context for you ; russia is being asked to pull it 's army out of a peaceful country that it has invaded and stop backing the insurgency that is costing the citizens of that country their lives , and you are telling me this is asking russia to roll over and die ? 
  european jihadists travel to syria to fight assad or establish islamic caliphate through turkey ( zero obstacles on the border and probably is encouraged by them ) with money and support from gulf states and full knowledge of u.s intelligence . 
  russian jihadists travel to ukraine to fight what they perceive as `` insert required propaganda here '' . 
  i will not deny that russia is involved heavily in south-east , but the amount of russian troops involved is vastly overestimated . 
  you can think of them as `` advisors being deployed '' , since you are from west and probably heard that phrase once or twice . 
  since russia lacks puppets or client-states and is acting against a somewhat united u.s + eu combo , it had to resort to `` not so covert means '' . 
  the reasons for russian invasion are only known to putin and his inner circle , i am not in it unfortunately , so i can not give you an insight what he is thinking and why does he acted the way he did . 
  the main topic is russia is not satisfied with current ukrainian establishment and want `` regime change '' for whatever the reasons , the fact that we resorted to such means is not a sign of strength , but weakness as you pointed out previously . 
  completely loosing face domestically would be devastating and russia is lacking in terms of `` prominent capable opposition leaders '' . 
  who is going to replace mr.putin ? 
   i 'm going to give you a chance to explain yourself about this . 
  i tried in the part above , this issue is no longer logical one and will have huge impact on domestic audience , the idea of russia paying reparations is like a spit in the face of russian population . 
  whoever would come up with it would immediately be lynched . 
  treaty of versailles was one of the main reasons for nazi germany to appear , russia has quite a number of similarities with pre ww2 germany already , if history is any indication - things might get worse is an understatement . 
  one of the reasons would also be the way west treated russia after soviet union collapse - something like `` no one is forgotten , nothing is forgiven/forgotten '' .
