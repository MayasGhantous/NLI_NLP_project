   i 'm not following the syrian crisis so i do n't feel knowledgeable enough to talk about it . 
  you can check my post history if you like , it 's simply not something i 'm currently interested in . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/world/middleeast/qatars-support-of-extremists-alienates-allies-near-and-far.html?_r=0 read between the lines , how come turkey border is not secured ? 
  how come there are no outrages or media hype ? 
  how is it fine to arm `` moderates '' who later have a tendency to become isis , but russia doing what it considers in its own national interest is unjust ? 
  ( this is me speculating , i obviously do n't have a complete picture )  i 'm sorry , what officials are you talking about ? 
  i 'm not denying they went there , if any did , i just ca n't think of any off the top of my head . 
  i will say that relations with turkey have been extremely cool for a long time with several member states strongly opposed to including them in the eu , so i 'm not sure why you would expect eu involvement in turkish protests . 
  the eu is simply not interested in including turkey on certain levels . 
  there is a russian joke for that - `` once upon a time ambassadors of united states , france , spain , germany and denmark ; secretary of state staff member victoria nuland ; american senators cris merphy and john mccain ; minister of foreign relations of germany guido westerwelle ; high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy catherine ashton ; former georgian president mikhail saakashvili ; minister of foreign affairs of netherlands frans timmermans ; european mp yacek protacevich ; minister of foreign affairs of lithuania linas linkyavichous ; speaker of lithuanian seim loretta grauzhinene ; former prime minister of poland yaroslav kazcynski ; senator of czech republic yaromir shtenina gathered on maidan and - accused russia of meddling in ukraine internal affairs . '', 
  the reason i bring turkey & a constant support of euromaidan in western press ( favorable coverage , ngos and other shit ) is to indicate that perhaps you were quite interested in a certain outcome , pursuing your interests . 
  as for the part about rewarding russia , i never said anything like that , what i suggested is giving russia a way out , not a complete humiliation which would backfire domestically tremendously . 
   i have been polite to you about this and argued in good faith while backing up reasoning as logically and reasonably as i can while seeking not to offend your sensibilities . 
  if you continue to be snide to me , that wo n't happen again . 
  i tried to be polite and argue in good faith as well , but the stuff i 've been reading between lines here and in other treads gave me an impression that the way europe + u.s envision the conclusion of the conflict slightly deviates from russian political reality . 
  if i offended you , i apologize , this was not my intention ; if i read between lines a little too much , i apologize as well , force of habit to look at things through different perspective/prism . 
   now , to deal with your final point , as impolitely as you phrased it : there is no reason for ukraine not to seek closer ties with the eu . 
  there is no reason for the eu to stop ukraine doing this . 
  russia openly invaded ukraine and continues to occupy and attack it . 
  there is no going back to russian hegemony for ukraine . 
  which is why i questioned putins actions as soon as crimea was announced and wondered why are we completely ruining our relations with ukraine and europe for decades to come . 
  i also wondered about the consequences of russia 's actions around the globe , the precedent of protecting `` oppressed minorities '' in 21st century with china 's newfound hobby of cartography and others . 
  i am not anti-eu , `` fuck the west '' type of guy , but i fail to see the conclusion of the current conflict any time soon , given the rhetoric and ongoing trends . 
  this is a talk of deaf person with a blind man , reality for both of them slightly deviates from their respective vision . 
  i was giving a perspective of someone who is not even watching state-run tv companies , gets his information from the internet and followed the initial euromaidan videostreams/programs with an opportunity to hear out the ukrainians and what they were fighting for . 
  this is my * personal opinion that i got from watching stuff that i could hear first hand * , euromaidan was russophobic in its core and as soon as they got into power in a coup , the very first things they wanted to do only confirmed my views . 
  nothing else , you are free to disagree , this is just an opinion . 
  now imagine the mindset of people who are being fed propaganda daily . 
   so it 's a videogame ? 
  people here on reddit sure treat sanctions like it is one . 
  sanctions are being implemented and everyone screams `` they do n't work , they are shit , moar !!! '' . 
  reddit culture of immediate gratification dictates the narrative if things are not immediately go the way the consensus want them to be , its all `` we are doomed , nothing is working , germany are selling out eastern europe for gas ! '', 
  thus the gradual escalation in extremist views and desire to go further and further , but when would be a time for slow down , you wo n't have an opportunity already , since that train has long gone . 
   i 'm still confused ; what was the treaty you referred to breaking earlier ? 
  video game treaties , i made an analogy of what happens in games when treaties are broken and tried vaguely to point out that life is not a video game and things do n't work they do on the screen . 
  sanctions = consequences , but they do n't work immediately as a lot of people here seem to think , that is all i was trying to say . 
   even now , there is talk about the sanctions being lifted next month if russia can be seen to be facilitating a peaceful resolution to events . 
  europe has been bending over backwards not to hit russia with hard sanctions . 
  i doubt it , russian food import ban is 1 year long . 
  putin visited latin america at what , july ? 
  how will it make him and his business partners in russia look , if russia lifts sanctions and fucks with latin american suppliers ? 
  how will he look domestically ? 
  sanctions are here to stay for at least half a year if not more , this is a case of ship long sailed . 
  supply lines are being established , russia is seeking money & possibly technologies/market opportunities in asia , we are slowly drifting away from each other . 
  i agree that initial sanctions were pretty mild ( slap on the wrist of putin inner circle ) , but the ones which followed the suit are quite different from those . 
  if you implement even harsher ones , well it might be not as their architects imagined they would work  there is an allegedly bismark quote in runet ( probably a city legend type of thing though ) `` never fight against russians . 
  your every cunning will be responded by their unpredictable stupidity '' . 
  well , * start * sort a indicates the start of protests in my opinion , not russian annexation of crimea : / i did questioned the notion of `` fascist everywhere '' portrayed by russian media initially and wondered why we were doing that , but its not like kremlin reports directly to me , so i have no idea . 
  i get my information like any other person from open sources and the `` background picture '' i got from euromaidan was quite russophobic in its core * in my personal opinion * . 
  no one bothered to explain why ukraine was so important for customs union or what were the long-term plans for the organization , asking questions is quite unpatriotic in russia nowadays anyway  i do think that russia strategy for ukraine is failing miserably though and has been for quite some time , so with nowadays ukraine ( read pre-technical default with 5324658936498 problems ) i want nothing to do with . 
  let europe + u.s handle the economic mess that they currently in , its gon na cost an enormous amount of money : /, 
  i am not against bombing isis , just to be clear , i can even overlook violation of international law and un mandate or whatever there is , what i am against is a situation similar to no-fly zone in libya . 
  `` activities '' in which united states military has engaged last several times were quite far from success in my opinion and it would be a shame if `` mistakes happen '' and some bombs `` totally accidentally '' fall on assad troops ( or even killed him via mistaking his car/convoy for militants or whatever the excuse would be ) . 
  you have a history of lies , so excuse me for being skeptical in your efforts to combat terrorism . 
  on a side note , eu and nato geography quite differs from russian one , ukraine is as close as it gets to russia , so no wonder we are kind a concerned . 
  this is a simple case of putting yourself in other person shoes and see how would you react to `` interesting '' developments in mexico , canada or cuba from lets say chinese . 
  as for turkey and gulf states , your intelligence services know exactly what is going on there , so in a manner of speech its happening with a quiet approval ( since no one seems to object or some parties are actively interested in regime change * wink , wink , nudge , nudge * ) . 
  why is cuba under embargo when soviet union ceased to exist ? 
  surely this is a relic of communism scare , right ? 
  what gives , how come its not abolished completely in 21st century politics ? 
  the question is not me name-calling something , but how russia and russian officials perceive ukraine , i am nobody in that regard . 
  people here love to hate the messenger or someone who dares to ask questions which deviate from established status-quo ( if i disagree with something , it has not right to exist so to speak or alternatively i will ignore it ) , thus the downvotes . 
  there is a beautiful rainbow cloud castle in which we would all like to live someday and then there is realpolitik in which nations pursue their own interests , not some humanism or human rights concern ( thus my example of middle eastern countries and how more powerful countries operated there for decades and continue to do so ) . 
  would it be nice if we all joined our hands and sang kumbaya , sure thing , but human history suggests otherwise , so theres that : /, 
  no , it would be a crimean war when ukraine would be heavily rearmed and trained by nato specialists with a clear goal of `` taking back whats rightfully ours '' . 
  i was thinking more of georgia style conflict with ukrainians ( and russians ) serving as cannon fodder for political games of parties involved . 
  its not that far fetched if ukraine fails to reform and improve its economic situation , you can always go back to good old style fashioned nationalism and blame everything on the other guy , 
  i have n't watched russian tv for a decade , so i ca n't really tell , but i would say that russia officially was quite reserved up until shootings at maidan and yanukovych fleeing happened . 
  thats at least the impression that i got from runet , initially this was a case of `` curious zoo '' with russians acting like an interested bystanders who see a free attraction , so why the hell not . 
  it all went downhill after mass shootings and `` the shit '' which always exists in any country , surfaced to the top of the discussion with ukrainians helping out almost on a daily basis with videos & n stuff . 
  i stand by the fact that initially euromaidan was anti-russian in its basis ( european deal ) and the informational background that i got from watching all the streams at the time and active parties involved in protests was quite russophobic in its core . 
  turkey is a democracy that is engaged in all sorts of shit in syria ( including planning false flags caught ** on record ) ** yet no one dares to say anything about them and everything is being quietly swept under the rug . 
  nothing to see here citizen , move along . 
  the gassing own people is not proven and `` evidence '' was highly debatable and your country intelligence services questioned the legitimacy and accuracy of the reports . 
  do n't tell me you already forgot wmds in iraq , kuweit ambassador daughter stories and all the other pieces of shit that was spewed for decades by government officials to justify what they wanted to do . 
  hell , assad even gave up chemical weapons , is this something you do , when you plan on gassing everyone who you do n't like ? 
  sounds kind a stupid , just like your `` line in the sand '' . 
  it would be whataboutism if this was not happening for 3 + years straight and ** continue to do so ** . 
  this is happening exactly * right now * as we speak and champions of humans rights and citadels of democracy - european union and united states have borderline * zero * coverage of the issue ( united states are actually engaged in syria right now and i am pretty sure they know enough ) . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/world/middleeast/qatars-support-of-extremists-alienates-allies-near-and-far.html?_r=0 is this is a case `` do as we say , not as we do '' ? 
  so , why does west act so surprised when russia engages in exactly the shit that they are doing ( or ignoring with full knowledge of the issue ) for decades ? 
  you gave an example of russian meddling , i gave an counter-example * which is not even a history * but an ongoing process . 
  i even used your almost exact words and changed ukraine with syria to indicate how silly the argument is . 
   in which century do you live again ? 
  i live in 21st one , but with each passing day i am slowly starting to wonder if this is true and we are not going back to 19 century style of politics . 
   returning to the status quo is hardly death , and nothing at all like versailles treaty . 
  do you even have any idea of the magnitude of the latter ? 
  how can you even come to a comparison that stupid ? 
  status-quo was ukraine in neither association agreement nor nato options on the table , playing both sides against each other while failing to create a functioning state on a spectacular scale . 
  current status-quo advocated by our irish friend there is at least the same that was during yushenko years ( anti-russian ) , i would argue much worse though . 
  it might not been such a bad deal overall , but in russian reality this is borderline catastrophic for current political establishment . 
  so , lets say putin is ousted , who will replace him ? 
  what is the state of russian opposition ? 
  who are `` prominent opposition leaders '' handpicked as ` our guys there ` ? 
  i dislike one-dimensional approaches and try to argue that you should at least try to `` fit in other guys shoes '' to understand him better and how can you deal with him . 
  syria would like for turkey , gulf states and u.s to stop mingling with their internal affairs . 
  what a bunch of unreasonable provocateurs !, 
  its almost as if they believed that they are independent sovereign state with a right to defend itself . 
  if kiev does not want to engage with russia ( and repeatedly publicly declare its anti-russian stance before any crimean developments ) , russia has no incentive to hold back and pursue its own national interests . 
  west has shown repeatedly the way to go - might makes right ( see all the bombing campaigns and `` rebels '' popping up everywhere ) .
