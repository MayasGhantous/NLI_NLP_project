add / r/ru there , the same 100 | 0 or so . 
  and as for ireland , it 's rather to count regarding `` native '' language to be irish , or at least somehow mixed in such proportion `` languages : english , irish , ulster scots '' . 
   the removal of un peacekeepers from srebrenica that 's the thing the un had to deal with and decide on ; not the criminal robbers called nato ( that is , as we all understand - the us and a bunch of puppets ; thus - the us ) . 
  a lot of blatant garbage , sorry . 
  mind your texas and \\ or mexica ; serbia was n't neither mexica nor texas . 
   do n't think you can say the same about texas , except that they were briefly independent . 
  you are quite ridiculous , going too `` deep '' into history , i can say that about your whole country and even continent , 
  free catalonia !, 
   ignored the un the only who ignored the un was that garbage i asked about - the us and the eu ( nato ) - why thinking it had _ any _ right - be that moral or legal - to get involved . 
  why anti-slav ? 
  do you know what ss was , which commemorations they do there ? 
  or you already `` moved on '' too far , probably following the advice of that brazillian guy ? 
  [ latvia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/remembrance_day_of_the_latvian_legionnaires ) ... well , i am too lazy to show stuff , just google it `` ss march estonia '' , `` latvia '' ; `` commemoration nazis in baltic states '' , so on and so forth . 
  `` equality '' has limits ; ignorance has n't . 
   break away well , currently and fortunately , it 's more about `` collecting '' regions back , you know  besides , true ... noone has a right to criminally bomb any souvereign countries like the us is used to do , if not invited with a peacekeeping mission or so , being invited by both sides , etc. . or , at the very least , to act on the permission of the un . 
   the us and eu who is this garbage and what right did it have over serbia except the criminal brutal force ? 
  and how is this right practically realized ? 
  by the way ... sweden is more reasonable  _ at the same time , when all prisoners in norway have internet in their cells , sweden warrantlessly wiretaps all telephone and internet traffic that crosses its borders . _, 
  stolen and ruined the next day after he fled . 
   wars over nazis are not ; especially in their baltic harbour . 
   is it really so much to ask to not commit acts of genocide ? 
  to ask - is n't ; but that 's not the role of the us in yugoslavia story , as the us criminally bombed them instead of asking . 
   moldova well , when the mess started there , moldova was barely `` independent '' ; so russians are there due to [ joint control commision ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joint_control_commission#history ) [ with both russia and moldova in ] ... it 's a long and complicated story , that happened in `` our own country '' de-facto and de-jure to some extent [ regarding the military presence in ] . 
  putting it shortly : if you 'd bomb texas or even `` texas of the next day after it got independent from the us '' , noone would care about . 
  so , i 'd like to have a right to use your house , wife and even maybe mummy if you do n't mind . 
  well , seriously speaking the point about `` gay rights '' is social ; social stuff , or rather public stuff ... it 's the point where _ public _ decides , right ? 
  the institution of marriage , for example , or `` propaganda among children '' are more than public and social . 
  and any ` private ' \\ ` personal ' rights of gays are quite well in russia , do n't worry . 
  it 's quite lunatic to confuse what 's `` private '' and what 's `` public '' , with a bias to any side . 
   russia has ... 
  does russia know about it ? 
  kinda confused ? 
  the bot from the us is asking turks for `` proofs '' . 
  hell , was n't pope notified that [ ukraine has no arena for eurovision , culture minister says ] ( http://uatoday.tv/entertainment/ukraine-has-no-arena-for-eurovision-minister-says-682840.html ), 
   rt i see that rt is kinda your god , but could n't you bring up anything coherent once at least ? 
  it 's about evidences and the us [ whatever ridiculous it looks put in one the same row ] ... 
  so , did you love the american-styled and america-recognized evidences , or ? 
  here some [ more `` evidences '' ] ( http://rian.com.ua/images/36237/34/362373421.jpg ) of that type . 
  you are quite blank . 
  it 's the obvious explanation to why noone cares of sending any `` evidences '' to the us , or the us pretends it did n't get them ( in any sense of `` getting '' ) as the only evidences the us recognizes are sent by me in the previous comment . 
  lay off of cnn , troll . 
  get some life , face the world , face the realities . 
  well , what can be weaker than the substandard lies the us practises the last decade or even more ? 
  i guess , it 's just that trust to the us is rapidly decreasing . 
   if ... who the hell are you to `` if '' anything there , in a sovereign country 's inner stuff ? 
  besides , the sequence matters actually , does n't it ? 
  ; if it 's clearly shown , that there is a country ( the us ) who does n't give a fck about any international rights and stuff [ which , before the 2008 ru-ge conflict was demonstrated by the us at least twice ] , then it evokes a corresponding reaction . 
  maybe because the only type of `` evidences '' the us so far recognizes are like [ this ] ( http://rusnext.ru/sites/default/files/kolin_pauell.jpg ) so that just no sense in sending any ? 
   assassinating some of them do it obviously by themselves , like the recent ( well , months ago or so ) suicide-bombings in the airport or so , i do n't remember ; `` russians '' were mentioned there among the terrorists . 
  sure ; long ago ; as well as about other countless terrorists turkey was and still is harbouring [ run-away `` freedom fighters '' from chechenya , etc. ], 
  despite all the notifications and even demands to extradite . 
  no , of course it 's not !, 
  it 's the hubs of happy multiculturalism !, 
  the enemy is in the different direction : the east , russia , gay rights , stuff , you know . 
  no ; just showing how absurd the expectation of `` talking without mentioning nato '' ( especially in the political area ) was . 
  as obviously nothing else really matters so far . 
   why ... ? 
  i would like a russians input on one of the many problems his country is facing . 
  maybe , because [ russia 's war on drugs is hurting america ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/russias-war-on-drugs-is-hurting-america/2016/07/28/b64e45dc-54dd-11e6-bbf5-957ad17b4385_story.html ) ? 
  wow ; you are so much into such a substandard propaganda ... ( a piece of which i saw on some so-called `` documentary '' a century ago or so ) . 
  well , no wonder you percieve that stuff as `` a joke '' and even probably [ laughed about ] ( https://cassandraparkin.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/laughing-at-fat-people.jpg ) :d okay . 
  wow ; turkey got sane , or ? 
  although despite all the recent glimpses of sanity in turkey like turning back to realism ( what media somehow used to call `` anti-americanism '' ) , and now even trying to fight terrorists ... it still has a 0 trust , i guess . 
   ... as opposed to russia , which promotes state-terrorism perhaps we just have different definitions of what to call `` terrorism '' and it 's quite distinctly seen in syria of nowadays ? 
  or you are just so much lunatic that somehow confused russia and the ussr ? 
   a joke of such quality , fortunately , no . 
  sure ; what else matters ? 
  maybe about some mcduck 's hamburger or a hollywood 's batman you 'd like to have a conversation ? 
  or , oh , i forgot : gay rights ? 
  well ; the us loves europe ; i am just not sure in which position precisely . 
   that this gulen guy was behind it all . 
  well , the us got a quite solid reputation [ and not in turkey only , i guess ] for being a shelter for well-known criminals and terrorists of foreing origin . 
   what happened to you , russia ? 
   you used to be cool . 
  when ? 
  when quiet about the us-led nato 's crime in serbia \\ yougoslavia ? 
  when having gdp of some tunisia 's size ? 
  well , `` to be cool '' , we 've certainly have different views on what it means . 
  i really distrust this poll . 
  some weird garbage . 
   the french government does not have balls, 
  it 's a small meaningless island dwelling near the continent , enough close to ; so why not actually ? 
  rather just some realism . 
  kiev is lunatic as hell . 
   you do not think its strange why is it strange ? 
   not the rule as it is in russia tell me more , boy , what do you know about `` rules '' in \\ of russia ? 
  the new european realities reached the uk too . 
   if a group books out a resort , the group can set the dress code . 
  wahaha ; has this group still not booked out the whole country ? 
  comming soon . 
  well ; anyone having brains - be that irish one or not - would like to have a referendum on this criminal `` partnership '' . 
  it 's not , it 's specific for more-or-less educated people not from uzbekistan and/or rural ukraine xd, 
  eurasia , definitely . 
  neither `` europe '' nor `` asia '' . 
  something unique . 
  yes , i do . 
  in other peoples ' houses , usually , there are icons somewhere ... it can be on a little shelf , on a table or even hidden in a table 's drawer , if it 's somehow does n't fit the interior or people are n't much ( or at all ) religious ( or not all of the family members are ) . 
  also , almost everyone has either a little [ cross ] ( https://e-a.d-cd.net/5ba7538s-960.jpg ) or several orthodox [ icons ] ( http://s.drom.ru/1/reviews/photos/ford/focus/big_62647_33475_add_1.jpeg?u=1313078 ) in a car ... a majority does , i think . 
  so , `` western '' means `` rich '' and `` catholic or protestant ( and in no way not being homosexual ones , blessing gay marriages in their churches ) '' ? 
  you have just perfectly described the european so-called values and criteria - i am willing to thank you for this ; some lunatics over there were talking about some `` religious freedoms '' or so , damn it .
