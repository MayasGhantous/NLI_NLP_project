  it 's rather in a few decades the eu will finally realize that the eu is some type of a caliphate working as a china 's franchise . 
   also because russia under putin seems to think in old east-west terms and sees the us as it 's `` main rival '' . 
  that 's what i meant by `` the are n't sure about it '' . 
  that 's why elcin 's rating was ca . 
  10 % and putin 's is 70 % ( when going to any slightest foreign affairs then rises up to 95 % ) and the only guy in the whole 1000 + years history who was kind of `` pro-western '' was peter i the great , who quite brutally imposed the `` western tradition '' on russia ( exclusively because of his own preferences and his friendship with certain dutch fleet-constructors who helped him to military crush some sweden on the sea , as russia having no fleet could n't really cope with them on the sea unlike on the ground , between this and then ) ? 
  the problem is in the very wording , that is deeply rooted in its racist past and alike nazi stuff obviously , as if `` people of a certain skin color '' or `` a certain geographical location '' somehow `` differ '' from others , are having some `` unique '' values or `` traits '' or so . 
  it 's an absolutly stone-age rubbish seen in such details , `` the west '' still ca n't really get rid of ... up to even coming to absurd paradoxes like including japan in the `` western world '' , literally calling it so ( that is , due to a certain political agenda japan currently fits in a bunch of certain countries , with the most of them being located `` in the west '' geographically , but the very wording of it is just ridiculous , making no sense ) . 
  nice doctrine . 
  nor russia is that . 
  it depends on what to compare with ; originally it was like `` christian vs muslim ( non-christian ) '' , but even since 1000 there was a certain split into orthodox greece \\ konstantinopol ( at first ) and latin rome , and the further it goes \\ the more complicated it all becomes - the less `` common '' grounds remain and the more variety comes into play . 
  so , within the nowadays traditionally christian \\ atheist world , russia ( at the very least ) definitely is n't a part of the nowadays `` europe '' or moreover `` western world '' ( political \\ cultural ; though , of course , the geographical sense is still valid , the other thing is that since we all have stopped using horses for dealing with geography the things have dramatically changed and do n't really matter anymore ) . 
  the point of it is ... ? 
  the same between russia \\ ukraine \\ belorus and probably kazachstan \\ uzbekistan \\ tajikistan ( for kazachs , almost everyone speaking russian and to watch it russian ) . 
  armenian \\ georgian \\ azerbaijan also , but probably to a lesser degree , though still more `` do '' than `` do n't '' . 
  and the rest of the former ussr republics . 
  what `` billions of euros '' exactly and to what friend and under what circumstances \\ conditions he `` passed '' ? 
  your imagination seems basically to be a very rich one , it 's a pity the knowledge is too poor . 
  true . 
  agreed . 
  re-name `` corruption '' into something like `` lobbying '' and relax . 
  why do you think ( or were taught to think ) that orban is corrupt , because he is against the refugee \\ immigrants madness ( and perhaps actually that 's exactly why he is bribed by russians , no ? 
  well , i 'd say the perfect example of how history is written by winners can be seen right now , many years after the collapse of the ussr , when americans are quite much convinced that `` private ryan '' who was `` to be saved '' won the wwll , for instance , while '' _ bloody soviets were just military incapable to `` strategically bomb civilians '' that 's why japaneses are to be thankful for hiroshima and germans must celebrate dresden-bombardments ( and they in fact do from time to time ) _ '' [ just one brief example ] . 
  no relations to them , except for serbia , maybe . 
  none , i 'd say . 
  50 y.o. 
  + , seek the state to be more realiable , maybe . 
   in soviet union had to use the same cookbook , if they wanted to do something of their own they had to have it approved by authorities really ? 
  the first time i hear of it !, 
  stalin in every kitchen ?!, 
  no stalin in a toilet ? 
   \u0448\u0435\u0437\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0433 at least now , in modern russian it means : `` beach recliner '' , `` lounge chair '' , [ this ] ( https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/beach-recliners-259461.jpg ) , while \u0434\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d is [ this ] ( http://www.shatura.com/images/divany.jpg ), 
  are you a russian ? 
  from [ here ] ( http://www.flyingheritage.com/images/slideshows/plane/bf109-7.jpg ) obviously :d, 
  wahaha , you are everywhere hunting for german words , or ? 
  \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0430 , there are many various ... usually just simply '' \u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c '' ( bed ) ... but mostly '' \u0434\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d '' . 
  sofa troops \\ forces \\ military ( \u0434\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430 ; \u0432\u043e\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430 - branch of military , so it is like `` naval military '' , `` air military '' and also `` sofa \\ couch military '' ) , probably . 
  it 's about something violent or brave , mostly political \\ historical \\ social , usually critical , categorical and very passionate and of course after the event . 
  always tackling the issue directly from his sofa . 
  learn of course , also german and french ( sometimes two languages at once ) , but noone cares . 
  everyone learns it just `` for a mark '' and forgets it immediately afterwards ( and \\ or retains just some knowledge in reading \\ writting in english ) . 
  germany and \\ or austria and \\ or the nl . 
  i am faithful to my wife . 
  right that , in a small yellow box the second shelf in the supermarket next to my house . 
  really , too many too list . 
  but what naivity did you see in , say , farage 's claim ( if such existed or could be somehow perceived in that way ) about the fact `` the uk '' ( or france in lepen 's case ) ca n't and wo n't be `` russian slaves '' ? 
  you think russia needs or wants ( i do n't even mention `` can '' ) to `` make them slaves '' ? 
   besides , why are you shifting this to napoleon ? 
  i am telling you , that at least three times russian army stood in berlin , one time in paris ; and even in such conditions ( not to mention any ` le pen turning to putin ' ) no any french \\ german `` slaves '' ... so that this : _ the ** naivety ** of some people like farage who thinks their counties are too powerful to turn into russian slaves _ ... is some incoherent absurd . 
  and in what way were they any slaves ? 
  and what happened say in 1813 or 1760 ? 
  really ? 
  maybe you count how many times russian army stood on the ruins of berlin or even paris ( not to mention anything else ) ? 
  hm ... no french \\ german slaves are still surrounding me . 
  why ? 
   declare allegiance to russia if fn gets to power are just completly crazy . 
  it 's absurd . 
  rather will be generally just talkable . 
  not like a pussy ( remember the story with those ships ; france built it , france wanted money , france [ paid money ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/313590-france-russia-mistral-compensation/ ) instead of earning money - `` hail , the us !, 
  there are in some . 
   does not mean they are going to turn france over to russia if they ever get to power . 
  it depends on what you mean with `` turn it over to russia '' , it really depends . 
  and i think you did n't just understand it in the way the op implied it . 
  [ angry residents of a region in germany have lashed out at the european union ` dictatorship ' and launched a petition to move the state to russian rule . 
  ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/703448/saxony-petition-to-leave-eu-run-dictatorship-of-germany-and-move-state-to-russia ) germany generally understands russia perfectly well ; and the east of it , well , up to sentiments like `` putin , annex us '' , 
  germany is rather anti-american , i think . 
  pro-american is `` new europe '' , that is , poland , ukraine , baltic-states , who else there . 
  and sweden \\ scandinavia in general . 
  more-or-less all-sufficient countries like germany , the uk , france , even italy - they are more interested in preserving what they currently have ( and that definitely does n't include any turbulences or escalations of anything ) - quite big economics and more-or-less peaceful , stable way of living , while the eastern europe is itching as hell . 
  it 's rather a rare exception for the very basic things and more-or-less valid for moscow ( maybe partly st. peterburg ) only ( everywhere else this exception is vanishingly small , i guess ) . 
  yes . 
  ( almost ? ), 
  all buildings do . 
  for technical \\ domestic use though . 
  well , in russia one ca n't get much ( if anything ) speaking english or anything except russian `` in the streets '' . 
  a possitive one , one that brings it back to realities . 
  only those who live here . 
  `` generally '' i ca n't say , as `` generally '' - in a more-or-less considerable percentage ( comparing to the natives ) noone really speaks russian as foreign language . 
  but personally - from my personal expierence seeing quite many foreigners speaking russian as second language : german . 
  why not to create a state of beneluxcrobulrom ? 
  none . 
  ukraine . 
  haha , no , exclusively girls . 
  were people in the us so pro- ? 
  lived in the us : vanity , bustling , smiles , kind of provincialism . 
  lived in china : really liked it - weird , unflappable , diligent , disciplined . 
  visited ... well , really , it 's easier to list the places i did n't visit , but among special impressions i got were : thailand - the girls . 
  gubkinsky ( https://vk.com/album-29017_225689227 ) ; st. petersbourg ; tyumen . 
  pushkin , probably . 
  a hen is n't a bird , poland is n't abroad ( a rhyme in russian ) . 
  chinese grammar ( sometimes goes as chinese charter \\ paper \\ document ) = something incomprehensible . 
  extremely weird that part about france is . 
  well , it 's like comparing `` hollywood '' with `` realities '' , it makes such a sharp impression putting it mildly . 
  i 'd advise to put some `` people of walmart '' stuff as a preview to any hollywood movie , to reduce a possible cultural shock .
