   spelling as if anyone cares about spelling of tallin . 
   and the estonian ss-veterans did the right thing well , just banal fascists \\ nazis . 
  it never ends fine , remember . 
   no , basically just russians do that . 
  there is no difference for the west . 
  estonia is n't really `` the west '' , just an insignificant village in the eastern europe . 
   whose ss-veterans nowadays march in tallin and there around  tallinn !!!, 
  who the hell cares what 's the name of that , or moreover the precise spelling , if the point is the estonian ** ss ** - veterans ? 
   the ussr was enemy no . 
  1 to the democratic world , an existential threat . 
  enemy of my enemy is my friend . 
  simple as that . 
  really ? 
  the world thought and thinks hitler was . 
  but , oh , well , to engage in a discussion with an estonian is rather useless and that 's definitely not for me . 
  what about ca . 
  300 vs 3000 , destroying a half of marseille city this summer on euro 2016 ? 
  and keeping doing so almost every day during a week or so ? 
  it was a big international event of course , but still , such things happen from time to time in regional leagues , and of course plenty of smaller scale . 
  it 's not very likely . 
  heh : [ `` submitted 4 days ago by tommy_gun88 '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/54ply0/have_you_ever_made_friends_with_a_traveling/ ) theoretically it 's possible , but the probability is vanishingly small , i think . 
  oh , by the way , iirc hebrew has been `` dead '' for centuries or so , and then artificially ` resurrected ' in israel ( '60s or so ) , they artificially made people learn it , so that an entire folk , the population of israel ( ca . 
  8 mln . ), 
  speaks that . 
  wiki says this : _ hebrew had ceased to be an everyday spoken language somewhere between 200 and 400 ce , declining since the aftermath of the bar kokhba revolt . 
  aramaic and to a lesser extent greek were already in use as international languages , especially among elites and immigrants . 
  it survived into the medieval period as the language of jewish liturgy , rabbinic literature , intra-jewish commerce , and poetry . 
  ** then , in the 19th century , it was revived as a spoken and literary language ** , and , according to ethnologue , had become , as of 1998 , the language of 5 million people worldwide . _ but somewhere i read it that it was revived right from the creation of the nowadays israel-state in '50s \\ '60s ( or , probably , that was meant as something like to an `` official '' \\ `` state '' - extent ) . 
  so that it 's a nice example of `` re-creating '' \\ `` resurrecting '' language , though again , behind that there were those jews , many of whom were/are fanatically fascinated with their great cultural \\ religious heritage and that was the inspiration for such a big-scaled project . 
  so , next to hitler ( whose [ ss-veterans ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lndgkzgwyrm ) nowadays march in tallin and there around ) among your estonian `` brother in arms '' against the evil soviets is [ `` this guy - freedom fighter '' ] ( http://flashbak.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/independent-1993.jpeg ) , is n't he ? 
  is n't something like `` end justifies the means '' a line of estonia 's anthem ? 
  but why roughly speaking noone speaks it ? 
  because there is no such countries like the us \\ uk \\ canada \\ australia [ `` most traditionally '' ] with their economics and armies behind it to teach europe and \\ or the world that ? 
  so , theoretically , it 's a nice idea , such an artificial , easy language ... but practically , well , esperanto did show the results . 
   no , you simply deflected . 
  you seem to be in a hard denial , but it does n't change anthing . 
  ok .  the ussr referdendum was boycotted by a lot of states was it not ? 
  by what states ? 
  i do n't know , maybe right in those mentioned lithuania , latvia and estonia . 
  i did quote that : the turnout was `` nearly 77 % '' of the ussr citizens . 
   the president of the ussr , chairman of the supreme soviet and general secretary of the cpsu had no right to sign the belavezha accords ? 
  in that situation - no . 
  it 's a big topic on the russian ( read - the soviet ) legislation needing a lot of elaboration . 
   the point i made is that russia treated it 's subjects badly , that 's it . 
  do you agree or disagree with that statement ? 
  simple yes/no would suffice . 
  your logic is messed up as hell , the question is incoherent , logically wrong . 
  you put a value judgment ( `` badly '' ) and demand a lunatic answer ( maybe you could get such one from your polish , as i suspect , country-fellows , but definitely not from me , i am used to serious stuff ) . 
  `` badly '' estimated in kg. , maybe ? 
  what 's the quantity below which that 's to be `` badly '' ( one of the lunatic options you put : `` yes '' ) and over which it 's '' [ not bad ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/disneycreate/images/5/53/not_bad.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20131018195503 ) '' ( another lunatic option : `` no '' ) . 
  any value judgement is to be regarded in comparision with something else , otherwise it makes no slightest sense . 
   well , no flag , because i move around a lot oh , quite an ordinary fate for a ukranian nowadays . 
  oh , well , then okay . 
  prehaps then you have to `` reject '' the results of it in `` dependent '' estonia , voting 90 % for `` independence '' . 
  i elaborated below : lithuania , latvia , estonia voted against preservation of the ussr making up the core of those 27 % . 
   what ? 
  you 're doing that deflection thing again ? 
  i just elaborated it , showing why your first point is irrelevant , instead of just calling that : `` irrelevant '' . 
   latvia , lithuania , estonia right those 27 % ( + minorities everywhere ) for _ dissolution of the ussr _ , very true . 
  ukraine 's refferendum ( december ) was a half year later , - after the ussr 's reffrendum ( march ) was held , - when criminal gorbachev , that had _ no legal right _ to ddisolve it , in fact made already everything for dissolution . 
   i never made that claim . 
  please stop projecting . 
  that was the only point you made . 
   i 've seen plenty in russian news on the ukraine tv ? 
  ok .  thus english-translated articles no need to translate anything , as you can just post the original articles ( in german - the very original ; and \\ or that being republished \\ translated on the all other , including many british media in english ) . 
  because you claim ridiculous stuff which is not true . 
  oh , now i got it , you read ` russian news ' on ` ukranian tv channels ' . 
  okay then . 
  really ? 
  oh , i am not surprised actually , that you are an ukrainian actually :-) why no flag ? 
  to save my ( - and maybe many other people 's as well ) time . 
   how is that even a response ? 
  russia did n't exactly treat the nations it brought into the soviet union or in the russian empire particularly well . 
  are you sure ? 
  maybe you ask the former uk colonies , how the uk treated them and why they got independent , before crying about ` brexit ' that this vile anglosaxon evil empire is leaving you ? 
  and well , 77 % by a 70 % turnout found the ussr treating them nice , voting against its dissolution ... [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_union_referendum,_1991] actually , both , the empire and the ussr were dissolved illegaly , due to some criminal revolutions , when a group of crooked guys - the first , lenin , funded from germany , for example , the second - still alive gorbachev and his drunkard-successor elcin , _ probably _ from the us ( maybe not really funded - no real evidences so far , but oh , well , say _ variously supported _ , and that 's just obvious ) , dissolved it _ at-the-wish _ in fact . 
   how is that an answer ? 
  if you want to have a discussion about the american spying program that 's one thing it 's pointing out the absurd claim you did as if `` oh , we are doing so fine , not as proxies at all , unlike the things russia did to us !, 
  '' , that 's just irrelevant . 
  yeah , it 's trully ridiculous to use google-translator , if you can read english stuff in , say , express : http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/703448/saxony-petition-to-leave-eu-run-dictatorship-of-germany-and-move-state-to-russia i do n't even mention the translated german `` stern '' as the original source . 
   that it 's either incorporated exactly : my first comment is right about that . 
  and as for :  ruled by proxy with the control the us has over , say , mrs. merkel ( over who the hell then do n't \\ could n't they have that in this europe ? ), 
  putting bugs all over her , spying on her just like on a kid , i really doubt she is n't a proxy and \\ or much different from a proxy one , after all the possible info the us collected about her . 
   russia treats their allies like shit hm . 
  neither the uk nor greece were \\ are russian allies , you know . 
  or you mean putin bought them both and mrs. merkel in addition , to make them treat each other in that way ? 
  and how do you know that , not knowing the russian language ? 
  definitely clinton . 
  but both are quite , well , you know it yourself . 
  i want the eu to join russia , or so . 
  edit : that 's just an ironic joke , hell , i got so many comments , *** that :d a message to all my polish , ukranian-israeli , estonian and czech interlocutors in the comment thread below : i kindly ask you , - hell , please , stay in the eu !, 
  just to carry on . 
   cologne in germany . 
  cologne managed to become quite notorious about any ` fests ' in it just within the last year . 
   santa lives ...

  in vienna , it seems , a crooked fake lives . 
  i was born and raised in russia , been living in germany , the us , canada , sweden , finland ( that is - at least more than 1 + year permanently ) , and traveled many other places ( almost every european country , brazil in the south america and several asian countries [ unfortunately have n't been to japan though ] ; for weeks or so ) . 
  nowhere abroad i found it generally better than in germany .
