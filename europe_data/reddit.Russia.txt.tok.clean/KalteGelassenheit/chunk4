  but that 's probably my personal aesthetic preference . 
  germany , for sure . 
  the best of the best in europe without any doubt ( if to exclude russia , of course :d ) . 
  where exactly , what state ? 
  not at all ; but generally , there are nice things people listen to from time to time ( or can be heard on radio ) , people usually do n't even know the name of , just so - for one time to listen . 
  selling out arenas does n't really mean there are any ` fans ' ; just so , random people willing to listen to what in europe is called `` folk '' ( in this case it 'd be like `` american folk '' ) , to some certain type of melody and spend a calm evening at a cozy festival . 
  exclusively acquaintances . 
  i do n't see ( m ) any reasons why to maintain any friendship further with some random traveling person i helped in something or spend an hour or two chatting about various triffling matters . 
  no any dialects at all ; if not to count `` ukranian language '' and `` belorussian language '' as russian language 's dialects . 
  ca n't you read the question put on the refferendum ? 
   ** do you consider necessary the preservation of the union of soviet socialist republics ** as a renewed federation of equal sovereign republics in which the rights and freedom of an individual of any nationality will be fully guaranteed ? 
  _ 77 % of voters ( with a 80 % voter turnout ) are ** in favor ** ** of the preservation of the ussr ** _, 
  did n't properly counter the criminals dissolving the ussr [ against the will of the people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_union_referendum,_1991 ) . 
  true . 
  maybe germans still tend to call it k\u00f6nigsberg ( to some extent , some extremist minorities or so ) . 
  and how do you call kaliningrad ? 
  no , not really . 
  hopefully , but barely . 
  moscow never sleeps , la-la-la . 
  it 's just one of the theories - about the ethimology . 
  it 's a common slavic name for germans ... nothing exclusively russian , but probably of the same reason , like `` not able to speak [ the language of where they got to ; in russia it was definitely the german influx in 18th century ] '', 
  there are quite many possible options ... noone 's nice . 
  with `` every fifth child born by a ` foreign ' mother '' , no ? 
  russia has/had a long history of various relations with germany : the ca . 
  of german folks , peasants ( ~ every 100th of living and ~ every 10th/50th of the working-age german ; so the scales and proportions were more significant than if ` nowadays ' ) moved to russia just 250 years back in the times of catherine ii the great ( who was [ partly ] a german herself ) . 
  even before her , peter i the great , was inviting and employing many germans for various offices and duties . 
  for a big part of russians ( if not for everyone ) ` the west ' ( or rather and at least ` europe ' ) equals germany ( just from the second half of the 20th century ` the west ' equals `` us '' more than `` germany '' ) and symbolizes its best qualities , the true prussian spirit : how do you call it , germans - sauberkeit , sicherheit , ordnung . 
  thus , some type of respect ( that russia has towards the west ) is paid to germany , whereas somehow , - i do n't know why exactly - the whole or the main part of contempt and disgust usually to the us :d, 
  leipzig ( und the ddr as well ) rules !, 
  no , barely such a thing is in russian . 
  i think it must be like in german as i know they refer to it as like : `` er ** hat ** gelesen '' ( as a statement of fact : `` he has read '' ) and `` er ** habe ** gelesen '' ( as in `` i heard , or someone said that _ he has ** allegedly ** read _ '' ) . 
  this `` allegedly '' - meaning . 
  i agree . 
  the university 's library and \\ or the internet satisfies it perfectly . 
  just rarely i saw guys who had to buy something as `` the internet '' was uncomfortable for them , while the library either missed or its supply of some specific books . 
  was not enough for the students ' demand , 
  nothing at all . 
   \u041a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b , \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b - something others do or something you 've done many years ago . 
  is it not like `` i said '' and \\ or `` it is said \\ they said ( as in abstract `` they say '' not implying some certain `` they '' , without a certain clarification who `` they '' as it does n't matter , generally `` they '' , `` the people in general say '' ) '' ? 
  in such case , the verb - its form - `` said '' wo n't be the same in russian , but will change according to the situation , without necessary putting these `` i '' , `` it '' , `` they '' . 
  [ true ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxjk0mpzcg0 ) , there is a verison named `` fully full little box '' ( \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 , as the line of its lyrics ) ... but i doubt many know it under that name either . 
  it 's folk music ... having countless versions and titles . 
  looks much like german with its 2-meters-long words . 
   you only have `` past finished tense '' both : `` finished '' ( perfective ) and `` non-finished but lasting '' ( imperfective ) . 
  \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u043b ( pokupal ) is like `` was buying '' . 
  \u041a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b ( kupil ) is like `` bought , did buy , have bought '' . 
   2 variants if you were present when something had happened or if you were absent then no such thing in russian , i think . 
  that 's poland , what are you surprised at :d, 
  would show these albums : https://vk.com/album-29017_225689227, 
  russia definitely . 
  never and nowhere . 
  the obvious difference : russians are n't muslim and are n't inclined to any `` allahu bah-bah '' . 
  but thank god , there is no refugee \\ migrant ` problem ' in europe with russians nowadays , but a 100x-easier one , with the influx from africa \\ middle east . 
  did listen to it : it must be some national folk music . 
  it is '' \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 '' , but i did n't knew the precise name , though this melody i knew of course . 
  most russians would refer to it as `` traditional national folk music '' or so , without knowing its precise name . 
  yes , ca . 
  in what is this tendency shown ? 
   each generation is more and more likely to abandon religion . 
  that 's why the religiously-motivated terrorist attacks and the rage came - rather intensified - in europe in 2014-2016 ( with some slight glimpses before , in 2000-2014 ; often [ always ? ], 
  commited by ` second \\ third ' generations ) and not then when the ` wild ' turkish muslims were invited to rebuild germany and \\ or the first ` savages ' from maghreb just arrived in france ? 
  why ? 
  both : you think i am having some `` islamophobia '' and \\ or should take it elsewhere ? 
  :d why not actually ? 
  the eu 's head , how can that be else !, 
  you are probably the one who have the problems with muslims :d i just give data and obvious logical conclusions . 
  no any policy at all , and no tipping at all . 
  just for fun up to one 's own decision randomly and very rarely . 
  but it obvious that muslims prevail in their birth rate quite significantly . 
  the more muslims , the more rapidly the total birth rate ups, 
  here is a nice chart by pew research : [ in france of 2005-2010 it was of 2.8 per muslim and 1.9 per non-muslim ] ( https://muslimstatistics.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/fertility-mdii-graphics-webready-90-w610.png ), 
   no , the dominant factor is were you spent your childhood . 
  in the muslim neighborhood , sure !, 
  you guess something else ? 
   much stronger welfare https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=socx_agg# spain spending 26.8 % of its gdp for ` welfare ' ; france 31.9 % . 
  it 's ca . 
  10-25 % difference , not like the difference ~ 250 % in the number of muslims just like the same difference in birth rate . 
   are you comparing immigrants with people with at least on grandparent from the maghrib ? 
  yes , that is a slightly vague quotation , but actually , later on i gave more fresh and certain data : 4 % muslims in spain and 11 % in france ... so , probably `` one grandparent from the maghrib '' matters up to making his grand-children muslim or so , the dominant factor . 
  i see . 
  well , nowadays it 's difficult to relate any `` economical situation '' with `` birth rate '' , as the access to necessities and basically quite appropriate living is provided ( almost ) everywhere . 
  the current dominant mindset and culture matter much more , the system of values . 
  the only significant difference between spain and france in this regard is ca . 
  11 % of muslims in france and ca . 
  4 % in spain . 
  almost 3 times difference ... 2.5 times ... so you can see the according difference in the birth rate , with a little correction to the natural , mostly catholic-rooted or whatever , southern approach of spaniards to family comparing to that in france . 
   okay , but do you believe that 3 million people can bump up the national fertility rate of a country of 66 million from 1.3 to 2.0 ? 
  not possible . 
  3.5 mln . 
  in 2005 ( nowadays it 's 10 + or so , i guess ) . 
  more than possible , as it 's quite usual for a muslim family to have 3-5-10 kids . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_france#ethnic_groups https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_spain#major_immigration ** in spain ** it shows 4.5 mln . 
  immigrants , with 0.7 from morocco + 0.05 pakistan and 0.05 algeria , altogether ** 0.8 ** ( the only ethnic muslims ) in ** 2014 ** ** in france ** it shows : '' _ according to michel tribalat , a researcher at ined , there were ** 3.5 ** million people of maghrebi origin ( with at least one grandparent from algeria , morocco or tunisia ) living in france in ** 2005 ** _ '' , imagine how many now , in 2016 . 
  so , you see . 
  maybe because you got `` 14 % of immigrants '' ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_spain#major_immigration ) made up by english and german pensioners relaxing on the sunny beach , no ? 
  while france got that from algeria and morocco . 
  where is logic ? 
  is n't it easier to make kids and take care of them if you are absolutely sure that you 'll be provided various additional welfare just so for your kid , or in case you lose the job or so ... how would it be easier without a welfare ? 
  where in the world is it proportional ? 
  it 's obviously the other way around , the poorer a country is , the higher bith rate it has .
