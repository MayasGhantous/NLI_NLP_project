  in each of the european countries the birth rate is made up by immigrants of muslim background . 
  the natives do n't breed at all , vanishing numbers . 
  heh , i bet : liechtenstein is more friendly , 20x6 km . 
  with 30k . 
  of millionaires and those who get salaries being hired to several billionairs at once who in turn hide in that `` off-shore '' in the rural tranqulity and thrilling views of alpes and according to the law must hire the locals ... but the question remains , is it actually a country , or ? 
  iceland is way bigger by territory , but populated like a suburban neighbourhood of a big city [ ca . 
  russia is diverse ( in all possible senses ) ; more diverse than any other european country or maybe any other country in this world generally ( including the us though it has blacks as `` already native '' for instance ) . 
  hence , anything you mention in a superlative form , authomatically means : russia . 
  and if speaking of `` averagely '' , then , well ... it depends . 
  heh ; mentioned that like `` multiculturalism for free for everyone ! '', 
  up to something absurd as hell . 
  but the eastern european countries do n't share and do n't accept any quotas on refugees and stuff , so like critically and sanely opposing it , or at least trying to . 
  and switzerland yet . 
  you are a lucky one . 
   obvious troll detected . 
  was n't the one who gave birth to you in the clinic changing your gender to a `` bestiality-rights-defender '' a troll ? 
   [ a dark horse ] ( http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/dark+horse ), 
  why not ? 
   russian whores on the highway brothel i guess you confused it with ukranian . 
   would call switzerland quiet fanatic when it comes foreigners , heck it 's the reason they probably will have to leave the common market . 
  i agree probably it 's true , thanks for the formulation : `` fanatic concerning foreigners '' . 
  it 's a catholic ( protestants ' ? ), 
  day or so . 
  not recognized by the absolute majority of orthodox , much less by the significant muslim minorities . 
  dubbing , of course . 
  `` a foreigner '' . 
  accordingly , but not spending much time on him if he 's talking too incoherently ; also i personally , as a 0.1 % exception could also speak english to him to clarify what is up . 
  in no way ; except for maybe some night clubs arranging halloween-styled parties on that night . 
   i was really impressed by all the putin souvenirs for sale in belgrade why was you really impressed by this , if putin - regarding the mentions on the media or so , is way more popular than batman or so in this world ? 
  [ no , this is not africa ] ( http://u24.ru/img/news/article_big_171901435390594.jpg ) , and [ this is not russia ] ( https://pp.vk.me/c636321/v636321516/24d54/y8hcriehmry.jpg ) . 
  if croatia for instance would like to claim its closeness to russia selling the russian goods or the putin souvenirs as a symbol of that or so , i doubt it 'd be approved on the russian side . 
  with serbia it 's definitely a bit different . 
   guilders :d, 
  where ? 
  finland seems to be one of the least affected by the refugee \\ immigrant-issues so far [ at least regarding the current wave of the recent 1-2 years ] . 
  they are fanatic because of you , you caused many scars to them . 
  i think they are obsessed with their independence ... which they 'd like to expand on the whole island ? 
   ... keeping itself to itself , ** trying to put out fires in summer ** whatever terrible it might be , but the wording is really funny :d i know too little about portugal , unfortunately . 
  i know brazil and brazilians ( the former portugal 's colony speaking portugues ) , but they are n't calm and i doubt they are resistant to lunatic influences from outside , though they are nice people . 
  portugal is a dark horse for me . 
  ok , you troll , corrected  heh , put it seriously . 
  and you are from ... ? 
  are n't leftists for `` social justice '' , that is - for the rights of working-class people exploited and supressed by super-rich ? 
  or nowadays it 's more about the rights of welfare-suckers ? 
  why ? 
  i have never been to there myself , but it looks nice from the outside . 
  what could be the possible public obsessions there ? 
   least religious fanatics on average - former eastern germany sometimes i feel really sad that it 's no longer an independent country . 
   estonia under '' _ a permanent threat of being conquered in 24 hours by russia _ '' . 
   least democratic what do you mean by this , like `` i will never be elected as a president '' ? 
   a person that values any idea or possesion so much to kill people because of it well , i am not going to physically die ; it 's rather about psychological \\ cultural \\ legal ` violence ' , fanatically imposing on you certain pseudo - ` progressive ' ideas . 
   if i want to know where least fanatical people live , i would look for low murder rate and atheism . 
  atheism can be quite fanatic too ; the militant atheism of the former ussr is a nice example of that , plus some societies used to mockery and various disgusting and offensive provocations towards believers of various religions , which 's quite common nowadays . 
  seems to be switzerland again or the eastern europe , - hungary ( what is about catholics there ) ? 
  portugal ? 
  in russia , [ yes ] ( https://www.avito.ru/moskva/gruzoviki_i_spetstehnika/avtodoma ) . 
  in europe ... in the tiny overpopulated areas ... what for or where to use such ones ?!, 
  though in the netherlands , for instance , they nest on the waters in the little [ boat-houses ] ( http://i1.trekearth.com/photos/67164/boat_house1.jpg ) . 
  anything and everything one tells or believes about russia turns out to be a lie after a more-or-less careful research , or , at the very best , a blatant ignorance \\ terrible mistake \\ deep delusion . 
  heh , you forgot stuff like `` lunatism '' a.k.a. 
  `` what i think of myself and what i wannabe and what you must think of me ! '' . 
  such disorders - the disease occurrence and the processes of its development - one also can find in history , carefully researching it . 
  we , the multinational people of the russian federation , united by a common fate on our land , establishing human rights and freedoms , civil peace and accord , preserving the historically established state unity , proceeding from the universally recognized principles of equality and self-determination of peoples , honoring the memory of ancestors who have conveyed to us the love and respect for fatherland and faith in good and justice , reviving the sovereign statehood of russia and asserting the firmness of its democratic basic , striving to ensure the well-being and prosperity of russia , proceeding from the responsibility for our fatherland before present and future generations , recognizing ourselves as part of the world community , adopt the constitution of the russian federation . 
  [ i ` am lovin ' it !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvfzf3f2wsc ), 
  seems to be like a prediction , or a plan , a most-probable prospect for the future . 
  heh , and all those dumbasses thought : `` oh , such a nice nostalgic song ! '', 
  spain should release catalonia ; britain should release scotland and n. ireland . 
  france should release corsica ... and they all together - together with the rest - have to go through some rebranding , changing its name to a caliphate called the united emirates of europe from atlantic to the very persian gulf ( turkey finally included , even if lost a half of itself to some independent kurdistan or so ; britain 's brexit also annulied ) . 
  which do you mean , that piece which belongs to russia ? 
  none , ( un ) fortunately . 
  _ economically , ** liechtenstein ** has the third highest gross domestic product per person in the world when adjusted for purchasing power parity , after qatar and luxembourg , and the highest when not adjusted by purchasing power parity _ . 
  but these dwarfs , they do n't look even like states ( not to mention `` nations '' , which is determined by `` language , lifestyle , history , culture '' and not by a paper signed in the un or a bit before that ) . 
  what is this little sly liechtenstein ( i like liechtenstein , by the way ) , for instance ? 
  it 's like a byproduct ( if not just a product or a part ) of the german nation , although a separate one ... its office . 
  and about their `` riches '' , there are , for instance , suburbs of london , moscow and even paris ( not to mention the countries \\ nations ) the inhabitants of which could buy entire liechtenstein ( and \\ or together with luxembourg ) with all its people including ... so the `` riches '' are quite relative there . 
   where a man ** can not ** walk where ever he wishes ? 
  but see below , there are comments about that in a quite detailed way . 
  https://vk.com/album-29017_225689227 ( northwest siberia ), 
  any russian-speaking areas on the earth and in the space . 
   imperialistic well , no ... otherwise [ spaniards ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanish_empire ) would be the first or at least the second or so , to some extent ... while they definitely are n't calm and imperturbable ; and do n't make an impression of being much pragmatic . 
  and why ? 
  i do n't think so , actually . 
  it 's quite usual for any country , i asked whether are any where it 'd be otherwise .

  who is calmer , less emotional , more orginized and more well-disciplined - germans or swedes ? 
  so , do you view the swedes - and swedish sterile organization together with their ability to calmly soar above the ground to not disturb the perfect ordunung of things , - enviously ? 
  and who is less noisy and \\ or emotional ? 
   are you forced to live by great forests and not able to visit them ? 
  such madness . 
  who told you that ? 
  if ca . 
  0.1 % of the forests were owned and forbidden to roam - or in other words even if just 0.1 % of our forests ** were n't ** , - nobody would even notice it !, 
  i specially googled it - never had such a question before - whether it 's legal to own forests in russia , - did n't even find a clear answer among the first results ... never saw private forests . 
  some years ago i saw a lake owned by somebody who invested there , built some `` fee fishing zone '' and put the fences [ nothing special , it 's not even a resort climate nor anything special built there ] ... it existed a year or two , he went bancrupt i guess as noone really went there , having plenty of other places for free around .
