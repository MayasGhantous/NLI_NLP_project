highly likely they were fucking executed in a secret prison for gay refugees . 
  how come , why is europe handling the refugees so irresponsibly ? 
  like children with toys . 
  5-fucking-thousand people . 
  it 's a disaster . 
   trump plans to promote u.s. natural gas exports as part of his new `` energy dominance '' policy while attending the summit . 
  price ? 
  no doubts that 30 % of european gas consumption will have to be american gas . 
  the only thing is : they 'll have to buy it for a significantly higher price compared to the russian / qatari gas prices ( example first months of 2017 in portugal - [ 7.2 $ ] ( https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_move_poe2_dcu_nus-npo_m.htm ) [ add to there the transportation within the eu - from portugal ] ; russian - [ 5.5-4 .9 $ ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=russian-natural-gas ) ) . 
  somebody must make america great again after all !, 
  the devil is in the detail , revealing the whole picture in this way , i think . 
  well , if this youngster was n't drunk he 'd be more timid and maybe even would n't do this . 
  it 's not the point . 
  if he 'd be drunk and behaving weirdly , or maybe even agressively toward somebody ( if he has certain troubles in life ) or whatever else coming out of his subconsciousness he ca n't control because of alcohol - it 's one thing . 
  behaviour of drunk people is exactly a great indication of what 's really going on there , what are the real intentions there . 
  i can imagine a soccer fans fight ( whether drunk or not ) , i can imagine weird behaviour of a drunk man , even a fight because of a girl or something , because of some insult ( or something wrongly perceived as offensive ) , whatever else - a lot of things . 
  but hatred randomly targeting a flag of a country _ in peaceful/neutral/positive _ event : it 's a clear indication . 
   you do n't think there are drunkards on cultural festivals ? 
  do n't you know that when someone 's drunk his true hidden intentions come out and are difficult to control/hide ? 
  if he 'd fight somebody or break something or so , then no big deal , but his aggression was focused on and triggered exactly by the very flag - in calm , peaceful surrounding which is supposed to depict it as friendly , calm and neutral ( if not positive ) . 
  thus , probably inside of people there is no slightest hint of understanding that actually , at least in some way turkey can be positive , normal and friendly ? 
  a total agony in other words , total hatred ( based on nazi/racist grounds , focused on a country - on turkey ) . 
  at broad daylight on some calm , peaceful , neutral cultural event ( obviously so ) ? 
  oh , just a normal day , i see !, 
  they could celebrate their liberation ( or it was done not by nato but largely or exclusively by russia and they just could n't skip that , which 's also bad and not fitting in some crooked narratives ? ), 
  and maybe fight turks on some soccer/sport games or so , at such a low level from time to time . 
  but it 's obviously a cultural , non-political event , representing turkey as a country out of any crooked narratives . 
  what is such an `` identity '' ( based on something negative ) worth generally ? 
  it 's rather some agony . 
  it 's a big nazi/racist hatred circulating in europe . 
  manners are lost , barbarism is thriving . 
  very sad . 
  from all over the eu ( and even from outside of it ) they gathered `` to protest '' there . 
  it 's fair to assume that the most `` not giving a shit '' ( about any `` grandparents work , that just are n't there '' ) were the rampant lunatics from abroad . 
  why do you think it 's work of their grandparents and not the eu open borders ? 
  [ we came to hamburg to protest about g20 -- and found a dystopian nightmare sre\u0107ko horvat ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/06/hamburg-protest-g20-dystopian-nightmare-security-disunity-politics ), 
  real names of who ? 
  of certain dead or ` missing ' ( went to syria ) people ? 
  i told you who are ` people who are n't at home ' in a tiny republic of 1 mln . 
  people . 
  ridiculous wording : `` the list of novaya gazeta '' ( what does this even mean ? 
  if you have any proofs and generally ready to bear legal responsibility for your random words , then put it as `` the list of tortured and executed gay people in chechenya , by novaya gazeta '' ) . 
   it might mean abandoning the single market , or it might not . 
  `` single market '' does n't mean much . 
  2016 eu import : * 20 % china * 14 % us * 7.1 % switzerland * 7.0 % russia * 4 % turkey * 4 % japan http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2006/september/tradoc_122530.02.2017.pdf with import making ~ 50 % of `` total eu trade '' ( 1 700 000 ml . 
  out of 3 450 000 ml. , and 50 % for export ) even if the eu puts sanctions on the uk like it did on russia , the uk easily could take 7 % or whatever proportion they need/can . 
  there are also japan and canada deals . 
  plus significant negotiations with india and china . 
  not to mention that `` leaving the eu '' will in no way mean britain completely abandoning the eu market .

  well , from time to time , once a ( several ) month ( s ) or so there are news from caucasus ( and often from chechenya , as the lands who obviously gave the majority or a significant part of those 10-15k . 
  of russian-speaking terrorists in syria ) , like : two militants killed in the mountains , a group of 5 terrorirsts killed in a forest , 8 terrorists assaulted an army supply depot and also were killed , etc. . is this list a compilation of their names ?

  it 's just a ridiculously incompetent piece of lowest propaganda . 
   \u25a0 russia has intensified its crackdown on dissidents . 
  last month , more than 1,700 people were arrested for peaceful protest -- the largest number of arrests in a single day in decades . 
  ** detained ** ( absolute majority released afterwards ) . 
  after mass madness , trying to disrupt a public fest . 
  one of the countless examples : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13pu97obn2o  \u25a0 more than a hundred gay men have been targeted by purges in chechnya . 
  three deaths have been confirmed . 
  several men are still missing , and dozens more are in hiding elsewhere in russia . 
  in response to earlier international pressure , the government in moscow has promised to investigate the matter , but nothing is known about the progress of this investigation . 
  here 's even nothing to comment , beyond common sense . 
  absolutely random info . 
   \u25a0 a moscow court has reached a guilty verdict in the case of five men accused of killing opposition politician boris nemtsov in 2015 . 
  the court failed to interrogate their motives , however ; nothing is known about who ordered the hit . 
  `` who ordered to kill kennedy ?! '' . 
  nemtsov has been nothing in his recent years , except for remaning a big shady criminal figure from '90s with nobody-knows-what bussiness shemes having in his last years . 
   \u25a0 the number of political prisoners in russia is growing . 
  they include people arrested for peaceful protest and even for statements made on social media . 
  they also include ukrainian film director oleg sentsov , who is serving a 20-year sentence on trumped-up charges of terrorism . 
  ukranian filmdirector , i got it . 
   \u25a0 most recently , law enforcement targeted a moscow contemporary theater called gogol center . 
  former managing director aleksei malobrodsky is in jail . 
  he is ** accused of embezzling state funds earmarked for a production of `` a midsummer night 's dream , '' ** _ which the prosecution falsely claims was never staged _ . 
  so , what 's the problem there ? 
  he needs to adress people on facebook in order to prove that a great huge public event has ever taken place ? 
  vague , if not ridiculous . 
  he is n't in jail . 
  he 's in a remand center . 
  well , pre-war syria was n't ugly either : http://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/before-after-war-photos-aleppo-syria-fb1__700.jpg, 
   citing two unidentified sources that 's where it starts and where it ends . 
  leave the ghetto . 
   have heterosexuals been discriminated against to a point where they can still today be killed for their sexuality in some parts of the world ? 
  if they were , then rather nobody could march on this march at all . 
  happy , kind . 
  dresden , probably . 
   if society was n't so heavily heteronormative , and lgbt people were n't persecuted then pride parades would n't need to be a thing . 
  they are n't persecuted . 
  parades , propaganda , such stuff would be necessary if they were persecuted . 
  they are n't . 
  what 's the problem now ? 
  for how long will they march with flags and such stuff , chanting ?

   is it related to the colonization of siberia ? 
  it 's called `` colony-settlement '' ( full version of it translated literally ) . 
   who goes there ? 
  mostly those who committed a crime through negligence and/or committed a crime for the first time . 
  crimes of small gravity .
