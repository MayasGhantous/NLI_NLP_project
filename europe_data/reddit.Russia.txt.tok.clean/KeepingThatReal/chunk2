   how does it work ? 
  they can freely move on the territory of the colony , often they are allowed to wear ordinary clothes and even in certain cases their families/direct relatives are allowed to live with them there . 
  then it 's a tricky conflict of interests so to speak :d, 
  omg , great !, 
  reminds me of my home village in north-west siberia - vk.com/albums-29017 , currently it 's midnight sun there too !, 
  dogs ledge and stuff can be met mostly among various indigenous fancy folks living in the forests :d where exactly is it ? 
  and what time the pic was made , if you know/remember ? 
  angela is in , angela approves , relax . 
  in a way of `` marching with a flag and chanting '' ? 
  never saw anything like that , only on communist rallies long ago ( i have always been suspecting they are still there just added lots of colors to their red ) . 
   no more straight people showing any form of affection at all . 
  why ? 
  what kind of `` affection '' do you mean ? 
  have you ever seen straight people marching and chanting like : `` we are straight , we are straight , here is our flag '' ? 
  what if a woman will rape another woman there , maybe even a dozen of times - free lesbian love so to speak , at a `` man-free '' music fest , - will there be a `` human-free '' rock music festival next year ? 
   at a photo op before their private g20 summit meeting , the russian president leaned in to mr trump , gestured to the journalists in the room , and asked : `` these are the ones hurting you ? '' no , not at the photo but at the tweet on some journalist 's twitter there , obviously making fun of it : https://twitter.com/dimsmirnov175/status/883370772865134593, 
  a bit incorrect , maybe a bit outdated .

  you should learn what the law and procedure mean , instead of keeping on the progress in barbarism . 
  your random `` opinions '' and low quality `` knowledge '' do n't bother me at all . 
  that 's exactly the case . 
  i am not well familiar with all the details of what has been going on in turkey , but as for the us the scale of the rampant fake and sabotage doings there is just incredible and unprecedented . 
  so , being from the netherlands taught you to throw around serious accusations even before your own inept court & investigation group have made any certain final decision on it all ? 
  no surprise . 
  low energy !, 
   i do n't know what you 're trying to say . 
  no surprise , that 's actually almost exactly what is called `` shocked and destroyed '' . 
   sure , putin is the good guy , and 27 eu countries are all horrible villains . 
  / s 27 eu countries ? 
  ukraine , you are n't even in the eu to speak for the 27 eu countries , relax , totlitarian wannabe hive-mind-ruler . 
   are you even trying to spread decent propaganda ? 
  i am not you , i am not spreading any propaganda at all . 
  are you shocked ? 
  ca n't you believe this ? 
   done nothing that could be considered `` untrustworthy '' ? 
  what exactly ? 
  promised to `` build the wall '' and still did n't ? 
  just technical issues , the funds are still not there enough : _ during g20 meeting , trump says mexico will ` absolutely ' finance wall , but president pe\u00f1a nieto allows comments to go unchallenged . _, 
   sure , but you 're spreading propaganda on behalf of the putin regime and what if not ? 
  are you then automatically shocked and destroyed ? 
   your enemies divided my enemies ? 
  i have none . 
  you are stuck in some obsolete past - having too many enemies probably , you need to update yourself dramatically . 
  `` deepstate '' has nothing to do with the law , it 's exactly opposing the law , a shady bunch of random people controlled by certain heads of departments and stuff ( quite often with incredbile money behind them ) . 
  they have been doing their job shitty as hell . 
  they 've just got to go . 
  they do n't want to go . 
  they will stop at nothing , using whatever fakes they can produce and crimes they can commit in order to stay in office . 
  i think it 's on the contrary , everything tends to disintegrate ( despite all the great efforts , fakenews and stuff trying to support it and hold together , producing absurd stuff like russia/china/whatever-threat and so on , trying to resurrect the mythical ghosts of past ; a couple of lines on rt destroys it seemingly to the core - just as an example , painted on the fakenews and having nothing to do with reality but probably simpler to understand for the fakenews-lovers ) : take a look at ` good atlantic unity ' , the rifts in nato/eu , so on . 
  it 's time of nations and folks to decide who they are and what they want ; not some abstract unnatural and absurd creatures from the obsolete past nobody knows why and what for existing . 
   the problem is that you ca n't trust any of the words coming out of his mouth . 
  name a mouth you can trust every or any words coming out if it . 
  trump , on the other hand , having a very short political career record , has not done something what he could be reproached for as `` not trustworthy '' . 
  of course , he 's under a big `` deep state '' pressure at home with all that fakenews and even certain sabotage of his work in the administration , but those are rather technical issues . 
  afraid of touching this ? 
  what disgusting trash-nazism . 
  that 's what your `` good '' nation taught you ? 
  no surprise , that you are so much pained by russia . 
  but probably not enough , unlike some others who also learned through that some really great manners . 
  wahahaha , omg , i have just read, 
  junker got drunk at the g20 party , screwed up as hell . 
  exactly . 
  but somebody wanted to see an eye roll in it , thus cut it and posted like that . 
  i absolutely agree , but oh , well , have you ever seen the facial expression of a mom or some random nerd who is n't much into what 's going on actually when he 's stumbled upon the preparation to rush b ; that 's exactly like those tweets . 
  wahahaahah , but why the fattys ? 
  it 's rather a funny video you brought up, 
  it 's a man who 's jealous of sexy european ladies of reproductive age in particular , i guess . 
  he also seems to equal blah blah channel to black-black-cock or so . 
  and an lgbt flag there : always protesting . 
  good people . 
  wahahahaa what is this supposed to be ? 
  debunked my fakenews :(, 
  putin is very happy in the second pic , do n't you see it ? 
  and trump is very happy too actually , his hand is also straight ( not crooked ) and honest . 
  take a closer look at the faces ( both in each pic ) . 
  who are these people , where do they come from and what do they want ? 
  like an army of barbarian criminals . 
  `` 196 police officers injured '' - it 's like a decent war operation . 
  what the hell is this generally ? 
  edit : `` at least 196 officers were injured '', 
  she followed his finger with her eyes as if he was pointing at something , but there was nothing - it 's just such a gesture - and then felt like stupid because there is nothing there at where she looked ? 
   it feels like she 's more bureaucratic than political . 
  and you like it a lot ? 
  :d the full lecture : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lhaidikujm ( wahahah , like pointing out the directions ), 
  on schedule ; total $ 4 bn . 
  ; 1/7 of the bridge will be 33 m. high navigable parts . 
  90 % upvoted , you have contributed to the upvotes % probably, 
  i thought some refugees seeking better conditions and stuff found this party - where junker got obviously drunk - great to be at and so sneaked in , as usual . 
  will somebody compensate it somehow or it 's just like a bad lottery ? 
  it 's called g20 and ~ 40 people there in . 
  refugees sneaked in , probably . 
  read the article : we are n't in 2015 , it 's 2017 and up to 1.5-2 .5 % this year for russia, 
   germany growing faster than russia you mean like this : https://d3fy651gv2fhd3.cloudfront.net/charts/germany-gdp-growth.png?s=grgdppgq&amp;v=201707031816v ... ? 
  well , the life style of `` doing nothing , pumping oil '' is fortunately lost , true . 
  what a wonderful thing we got rid of !, 
  she 's hottest with the mostest . 
   which is the measure you should use when comparing two economies to each other . 
  maybe you should . 
  sane people prefer real stuff over the digits on the screen - you ca n't even eat those digits . 
   you have it backwards you need to update yourself dramatically .
