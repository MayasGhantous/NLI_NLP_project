   ppp is useless when comparing two different economies to each other . 
  are you insane ? 
  economy is not the number of empty digits on your pc screen , economy is real stuff you can afford/buy/produce / etc. 
  for those numbers , using those numbers - that 's exactly what ppp is : `` purchase power '' . 
  nominal . 
  ppp matters . 
  and all those recent reports of `` 39 % being in grey economy '' ( which are really ridiculous , as up to 300 % are there ) , etc. 
  haha , why, 
  you probably tried to completely ignore the article , otherwise would notice :  `` the really devastating news for ` our western partners ' ( as putin likes to refer to them ) must be -- which we are the first to report -- the extraordinary decrease in the share of oil & gas revenue in russia 's gdp . '', 
  :d omg , they are like having a party there, 
  not so soon . 
  ca n't you read english ( are you an ukrainian immigrant in the uk ) ? 
  playing a fool has never been a good answer or generally a good option in life . 
  i have asked : how do you know it 's ukraine ( read - that crimea is allegedly a part of ukraine ) ? 
  have you ever been to there yourself or you are living in some lost media/papers ` reality ' which does n't coincide with objective reality and that 's why so often called like `` fake stuff '' ? 
  have you been to there ? 
  how do you know it 's ukraine ? 
  eternity ... sounds sweet !, 
  check this and all the other albums there vk.com/album-101373101_220631836 , get `` deeper '' a bit , so to speak . 
   making a picture of a person she does n't like why is this assumption ? 
  obviously it 's on the contrary , she `` likes '' him or whatever . 
  it is populated by ca . 
  2 mln . 
  people . 
  people are n't really a thing `` to steal '' or whatever like that , if someone does n't have your way of thinking , of course . 
  you are n't used to bear responsibility for your random fake words , i understand it well , but nevertheless , would n't you be afraid to ever say this to any of those people right there - to be like a man , reasoning you know , coming to the `` stolen '' place and `` rescuing '' it like `` hey , guys , did you know you are stolen ? 
  this your peninsula is stolen ? 
  i found this stolen thing here , i am going to bring it back to its owner '' or all you can do is to type fake empty words which are worth literally nothing , not making any slightest sense ? 
  that 's a refined observation , i must tell you !, 
  i upvote everyone !, 
  literally every comment here . 
  my people , come and comment passionately , a free upvote to everybody in the name of high energy !, 
  only here , only in this thread and only today , hurry up for god 's sake !, 
  we need a big , great discussion !, 
  what are those sanctions if the us agreed to sell patriot missiles to poland !, 
  surface-to-air missiles , kindly note - in the most modern configuration . 
  a great bussiness deal is reached !, 
  a memorandum is signed !, 
   the truth is , we do n't care about you at all , russia is very rarely in then news in estonia . 
  that 's why all you generally do ( and you generally do n't do a lot , here i agree ) is `` complaining about bad russia threat '' and thus `` begging for more subsidies '' and stuff ? 
  poland , hello !, 
  why are you so angry making me report you , did n't trump inspire you ? 
  my mistake , have been watching them . 
  this koktebel : http://uastreaming.net/live/40/webcam-online-koktebel-obzornaya-veb-kamera-na-zdanii-brigantina.html ( all the views , history , etc. 
  ) , are you unable to google or are blocked there in ukraine completely , not only on vk , having exclusively some single random shady pic to see which you resent to here by some reason calling it `` koktebel 2015 '' or something ? 
  singling them out as `` migrants '' , `` temporary residents '' , `` permanent residents '' whatever else but never as citizens , who can vote and have all the rights/duties/obligations a country grants , and who make up a `` population '' which generally matters as a population of a country for this country , - not as a patient in a nusring home and for a department that hires migrant workers to be nurses . 
  stay a nurse , man !, 
  i feel no hope there , even for a good education changing anything there as it 's either too late or just impossible in principle . 
  `` butthurt '' ?!, 
  you just try to read what you are writting ( \u261e \uff9f \u2200 \uff9f ) \u261e !, 
  :d i of course understand that `` making sense '' has never been among estonian priorities ( unlike being `` so sensitive '' and `` getting so offended '' , also `` playing an eternal victim '' in a bid for some eternal subsidies ) , but oh , well , i am not an estonian . 
  meybe because it 's not 2015 , 2014 and even not 2013 ( but in fact 2011 , 2012 , 2013 ) - the gruesome ukranian years , heh , a steady decline - but 2017 , instead ? 
   the webcam was turned off the ukranian one , made in 1992 ? 
  it got just broken , obviously :( enjoy all the sides of it  webcam : http://www.glavmore.ru/webcam/gelendzhik-naberezhnaya.html webcam : http://www.glavmore.ru/webcam/gelendzhik.html google any other there . 
  social network : https://vk.com/koktebelll2017 ( oh , sorry , [ blocked in ukraine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6xw8kbwvfe ) , haha ), 
  have n't you ever heard of such a thing as `` census '' ? 
  who `` they '' ? 
  the nurses in a nursing home ? 
  stay there . 
  [ ** turkey rejects proposals to drop eu accession talks : minister ** . _ turkey rejects any proposals to drop european union accession talks in favor of cooperation in other areas , its eu affairs minister omer celik said on thursday ahead of a european parliament vote on suspending turkey 's membership bid _ . 
  ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-eu-minister-iduskbn19r0p4 ), 
  ask europe : how is it generally called in the eu - `` bad corruption '' or `` good lobbying and stuff '' to be counted in good statistics ? 
  it 's hard to understand what `` real life '' of an estonian in a permanent search for jobs in finland is , sorry . 
  usually people count the ones able to vote in the legal sense of the word and who generally has all the rights to say : `` it 's my country , i am the man of this country ! '' . 
  what trifling matter of internal management is , is interesting only for certain accountants in a nursing home . 
  you really make no sense . 
  i am not really interested in a discussion for the sake of discussion , and must acknowledge you as a not-interesting-interlocutor and hence leave you . 
  low energy !, 
  vagueness !, 
  nonsense . 
  i have no idea , obviously something similar to what is in front of/opposite to it :d, 
  `` fewer '' , what ? 
  it 's the increase of population which came out of `` change in the calculation methodology '' obviously starting to calculate not citizens but whoever and for whatever reasons came to the country and is `` living in '' . 
  please , educate yourself , and let me , mister democratic estonian , trust to and rely on the world bank more than on the estonia statistics , who also admits itself : ** the increase in the population figure was also influenced by changes in the calculation methodology **, 
  they do , for domestic `` use '' ( mainly economical , managing social and work stuff ) . 
  but when speaking of `` population '' in general : `` what 's the population of that or this country ? '', 
  - they count citizens . 
  who among any more-or-less significant entities except this wiki-aricle and estonia statistics seeking to make it look nice does operate it in that way ? 
  yes . 
  astrakhan oblast , mistyped there a bit , in english it 's `` astrakhan '' . 
   population is usually counted with people living in the country , not citizens , `` usually in estonia '' , as usual . 
  got you , little mister . 
  thanks !, 
  the world is used to do it in the other way though - exactly by the number of citizens and counting the `` migrants '' , etc. 
  `` living/working '' singled out in a separate category . 
   see people , this is a golden example of a brainwashed person !, 
  really , you speak like a worst communist agitator , mister , haha . 
  better if you learned and loaned nukes and spaceships from the ussr instead of that . 
  this you mean :  in 2015 the country experienced population growth . 
  the population mainly increased as a result of net immigration of european union citizens . 
  ... with the reference : [ `` the population increase was influenced by external migration '' ] ( https://www.stat.ee/277564 ) . 
  4 may 2016 . 
  statistics estonia . 
  retrieved 14 june 2016 ? 
   the population figure decreased by 1,336 persons due to negative natural increase , but increased by 2,410 as a result of positive net migration . 
  the increase in the population figure was also influenced by changes in the calculation methodology , resulting in 1,599 persons being added to the population . 
  a methodology trick , most lickely . 
  like counted `` migrants '' and `` retired pensioners '' from the eu as `` living in '' to make it look nice , while `` population '' is usually counted by the number of citizens of a country . 
  otherwise russia 's population , for instance , would be of a ** vague ** figures like between 155 to 185 mln . 
  ( more ? ),
