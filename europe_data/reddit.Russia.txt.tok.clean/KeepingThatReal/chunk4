  by what data ? 
  google operating `` world bank data '' suggests it as : * 2011 - 1.327 mln . 
  * 2012 - 1.323 mln . 
  * 2013 - 1.318 mln . 
  * 2014 - 1.315 mln . 
  * 2015 - 1.312 mln . 
  ... with no data availiable further . 
  they have been like that everywhere in the former ussr republics . 
  a disasterous situation of a random dissolution of an incredible country !, 
  in estonia the situation must be especially dramatic before it has joined the eu subsidies in 2004 . 
  joined with shakes , obviously , the following 2005 was quite aggressive , with the energy rising , but then luckily calmed down . 
  proportional to estonia losing its population due to the outflow , emigration ? 
  though , no !, 
  lost just ~ 1/3 of it for this period of time . 
  the rest , probably , became too old for such silly stuff as homicide . 
  you read your post history at first , it 'd be enough . 
  you mean like : https://cs7059.userapi.com/c540100/v540100407/260d5/-th0ylkyx74.jpg ( note the weather , heh ) ? 
  just check it here : https://vk.com/sdamnaleto on a daily basis . 
  if 6.5 + mln . 
  ppl . 
  ( last season ; the same as this currently ) is for you not `` hordes '' , then ... just re-read your failing post history , okie . 
  reaching deals is always great . 
  expecting something for too long - is n't !, 
  what a low energy !, 
  getting even lower from year to year . 
  started with 200 k. in 2011 and finished this year with 4 k. okie . 
  i do n't , nobody does , nor do those hordes of tourists there not to mention the locals . 
  but hromadske-kek said something else two or three months ago , showed a pic of a puddle ... hm !, 
  how to solve this incredible riddle !, 
  we need to appoint a new attorney general to investigate this hoax of the century !, 
  did you know what mr junker said to ** [ you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mwrwfaissi ) ** recently ? 
  he 's your neighbor by the way , from the little lux , you must be used to what they say to you . 
  the lowest example of the blatant fakenews , haha . 
  i congratulate you & 170 k. of those poisoned eating such a trash and vomiting some low energy in the comments afterwards . 
  hromadske-ske-kek ; kinda outdated , no ? 
  9 may . 
  here you can see some big bad hailstones in balaklava , crimea on 4.7.2017 . 
  suffering , no water : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0lpjkyozjm, 
  it 's g20 , it 's a serious matter . 
  it automatically concerns the other 19 ( 18 , ok , excluding germany ) , who were going to have talks with turkey as the part of g20 . 
  is it salty , worth to read so to speak ? 
  i am in a time saving mode , need some prompts . 
  does turkey have ~ 4 % of nationals having their original state/leader outside turkey ? 
  what about the good eruopean values ? 
  it 's obviously about so-called `` public rights '' like `` marriages , adoption , crooked propaganda '' , etc. 
  they obviously do and clearly realise from where and to where it led them . 
   how would you rate that show 's popularity ? 
  in the video , where he speaks ? 
  it 's the federal state tv channel `` russia 1 '' , mainstream . 
  it 's mostly `` political/social stuff '' tv channel : talkshows , discussions , debates , documentaries , etc. . 
  the very show itself , well , it 's one of the countless there 24/7 with a short break for news and some movie in the evening . 
  did you watch the video ? 
  yeah , according to the original source they bought it ( to expose there ) in 2013 , it was produced in 1960 and in 1998 underwent restoration . 
  not said who sold it though and why exactly it 's radioactive . 
  what a low energy !, 
  lacks ` values ' ( though some true ` double-standard ' values somebody never lacks there . 
  wow , wow , wow . 
  i think it 's a good suggestion to never join that as you have been musing it recently , haha . 
  besides , undereducated anti-russian swede , i 'd just suggest you one more time to open some map and in other ways to educate yourself , trying to get your shit together deeming russia `` western '' or by some reason `` far eastern '' and so on , you are n't an interesting interlocutor , hence it 's time to leave you . 
  the same what they did before , stimulating people to give birth : `` complex of measures to support family and motherhood '' , stretching and mainly focusing it on women 30 + until the new generation sustainable wave comes to adult age . 
   the entire western world is currently facing natural population decline ... and also an abyss of sodomy . 
  russia is n't the `` western world '' , luckily , you could use some map or so , to educate yourself at first , then maybe you 'll also stop being too `` anti- '' in general . 
  oh , true , it 's some `` gap '' from '90s , when the people who are supposed to give birth now simply were n't born then . 
  that 's why this year ( in the beggining of it ) they were modifying the `` maternal capital '' and other supportive tools , adding/refocusing it on `` older mothers '' , 35 + giving birth , etc. . 
  like - no , maybe saw something like that on some `` pseudo-liberal '' page on vk 5 years ago or on the `` pseudo-liberal '' radio station ran by the guy who is a [ living meme ] ( http://xn--80aa3aekaebe4a6lc.xn--p1ai/userfiles/pict/files/zfi0odr7w6.jpg ) himself , but am not sure what exactly that trash was about . 
  even the link you sent to me - which 's actually empty ( having a list of two memes - about stupid ` insta-girls ' and some fat minor mc-dj , containing `` voronezh '' ) - does n't know it . 
  thus , i am not surprised that the `` meme '' circulated mainly or only on your obviously personal blog `` known to three '' . 
  actually , it 's too regional . 
  certain things can be there in every place pointing finger at the next door or so , but looking at it as a whole , no such certain place can be singled out . 
   1 ) ... that one part of the country where all the weird shit happens ? 
  i think none . 
  it can happen and from time to time does everywhere . 
   2 ) ... facebook/another major social network ? 
  vk ; and a less popular - od ( odnoklassniki , ok.ru )  3 ) ... buzzfeed ? 
  `` life.ru '' , i think . 
  maybe not really `` buzzfeed '' but nothing closer to buzzfeed is there . 
   4 ) ... that really stupid meme you wish foreigners would understand ? 
  i think all the memes are loaned from somewhere , though there is one which started like : '' ... , be a man , bleat ! '', 
  ( later on transformed in many versions ) , i think it 's exclusively russian , though not sure and it looks like this : http://bleat.ru/  5 ) ... that one comedian/comedy show that goes way too far that you wish foreigners would understand ? 
  heh , i will keep it to myself . 
  generally , there are quite many of those and they all make specific fun , of course , most of which would n't be understood by foreigners . 
  not for nothing nato ( nato strategic communications center of excellence ) studied an old , originated in the ussr ` amatuer/student ' comedy comptetion show [ by the way , obviously you paid for it , mister ; for a new joke appearing on russian comedy shows ] as `` a tool of mighty kremlin hand '' making russians invincible zombies : * original here : http://www.stratcomcoe.org/stratcom-laughs-search-analytical-framework it 's a good joke itself , fitting those `` anschlag '' for 40 + or this ` self-made ' students competition . 
  besides , `` comedy club '' is the most popular comedy show on tv , i think , is just like the dirty american `` stand-ups '' . 
  also there are quite many popular youtube self-made ` comedy channels ' . 
   6 ) ... that one easy to make fun of celebrity ? 
  too many . 
  it depends on what kind of fun you are going to make . 
   7 ) ... that one idiot politician ? 
  jirinovsky probably and his people . 
  he 's not `` an idiot '' at all , actually , but is , let 's say a bright one , extremely outspoken and absolutely not `` politically correct '' and loving to perform `` a show '' at many tv talkshows , debates , etc. , it 's a trump-multiplied-by-ten-in-one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3milsiybkls ( with english subtitles , a bit `` reduced '' and `` adapted '' but all in all the fine ones ), 
  wahaha , omg , it 's just disasterous , beyond any common sense . 
  time reveals who is who so to speak . 
  by the way , is it your personal blog known to three , mister from / r/liberta ? 
  i really loved the part `` about me '' there :d, 
  more here : https://vk.com/album-101373101_241427637 https://vk.com/albums-35824409, 
  what if i downvote this random absurd novelist ? 
  wow , wow , wow . 
  poland is fine with it . 
  it 's very catholic since recently as we know . 
  why are you sending me videos of 2007 ( even if you re-uploaded it in 2017 ) ?
