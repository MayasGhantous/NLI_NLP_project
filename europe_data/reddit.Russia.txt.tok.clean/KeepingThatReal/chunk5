  in the first video he 's asking some : `` so you are a fascist ? '', 
  ( ~ 2007 ) , in the second is a squabble between chechen and dagestan wrestler fans ( which also happens at many sports events regulary ) . 
  third is a fight between football players ( the teams there are absolutely international ) , omg . 
  the forth it 's even written there : 1 ) no civilians involved ; 2 ) no casualities ; 3 ) the conflict was n't about ` national hatred ' . 
  you , boy , visit at least one football game in your life , not to mention serve in the army , to know what life means , instead of watching old videos on youtube :d that 's all you can do , to send me 4 outdated as hell videos for the 145 mln . 
  country ? 
  you need a dramatic update of your life . 
  you are n't an interesting interlocutor , hence it 's time to leave you . 
  ' 08 , ' 13 , good cnn ; where are good for you early '90s ? 
  you need to update yourself dramatically . 
  no wonder . 
  except for being quoted on cnn & co. it has never and nowhere been popular . 
  it follows the fate of dozhd ' , a good media who used to be good on the internet and also providing cnn & co. with good materials , but then reduced itself to a ` paid subscription only ' , selling caps with own logo for a year or so , before such a dramatic decision was made . 
  it 's a great catholic achievement !, 
   these statistics run against the kremlin 's triumphalist narrative , in which strong leadership and shrewd investments allowed russia to decisively turn a demographic corner . 
  it does n't run against ; for the last four years it looks like +30 k. , +30 k. , +30 k. , -3 k. . ( after being like -150 k , -200 k. , -550 k. 
  respectively back ) calculate it yourself . 
  you are one of the `` degraded & low quality so-called ` minorities ' in the eu '' demanding some `` crooked worship '' ? 
  thanks . 
  but somehow i could n't care less , you know , naverstivay dalshe wherever you nest in :d, 
  \u033f\u033f \u033f\u033f \u033f\u033f \u033f ' \u033f ' \\ \u0335\u0347\u033f\u033f \\ \u0437 = ( \u2580 \u035c\u035e\u0296 \u2580 ) = \u03b5 / \u0335\u0347\u033f\u033f / ' \u033f ' \u033f \u033f \u033f\u033f \u033f\u033f \u033f\u033f chechens also build well - work as construction workers - and even have auto industry established - take a look at `` chechen auto '' - https://vk.com/album-101373101_242427429 ( or re-established , not sure about whether it existed there since the ussr times ) , besides ordinary russia 's lada models they make there . 
  agrocultural/food stuff and energy/chemistry facilities are also there . 
   i mean , there are also chechens fighting for the ukraine , and unlike kadyrov people , they 're there by their own will and not for the money . 
  do n't think that a ukrainian is stupid enough to not see things in the rf either . 
  well , there are bastards everywhere , no doubts , ca . 
  10 k. of russians ( russian-speaking , from the former-ussr altogether who also have visa-free with russia ) are fighting for is in syria ( have been fighting , now obviously their number is significantly reduced ) , various jihadi-toliks and such scum . 
  `` chechens fighting for the ukraine '' are the run-away terrorists from the `` is '' once having a hold on the russian soil in chechenya with all the `` sharia '' stuff and so on , since they were defeated some of them ran away in bad pain to europe mainly ( to where else ?!, 
  bad russia , persectution , bear , bomba , stalin , give me a refugee status , i am the `` freedom fighter '' ; not only such chechens are in europe surely , many ran away just from the very fact of the war and destruction , and many also from those very terrorirsts ) , and from then on , some of the most pained are trying to oppose russia . 
  also , `` not for money '' is a bit of exageration too , especially regarding the `` good qatari/saudi/turkey funding of the freedom fight in chechenya '' which instantly ceased once the funding lines were cut . 
   and unlike kadyrov people what unlike kadurov people ? 
  fighting for money ? 
  you know , they 'd make some money out of you for such words once heard in real , i think . 
   it 's just , weird . 
  no , it 's just pathetic - they are still stuck in the outdated paradigm of their good saudi/qatari sponsors of early '90s in their desperate hope to sew feud and nationalism in russia/caucasus - and also perfectly illustrating their intellectual and other capabilities , what they generally are worth and what they `` see '' ( being totally blind , putting it mildly , with their brains too mild , melted down ) . 
  and a big pain as a result of it all leads them to such `` weird & absurd madness '' like that helpless comment full of spite and wishful illusions . 
  i have explained the situation as a whole so to speak , in details . 
  on the contrary : whatever makes math happy , - regarding the majority of the people , i underline this , - and maybe even including these tiny farmers who can afterwards get hired to those big farms and earn 10 times more than if they were doing it on their own in an inept way . 
  basic common sense and pragmatism instead of crooked worship of degraded & low quality so-called ` minorities ' as in the eu . 
  read the russia 's constitution or at least some wiki :  chapter 1 . 
  the fundamentals of the constitutional system  article 1  the russian federation - russia is a democratic federal law-bound state with a republican form of government . 
   ** the names `` russian federation '' and `` russia '' shall be equal . 
  no , only on the internet ( the foreign segment of it ) by such random pained persons , it 's highly likely a terrorist or a pained ukrainian - even much more insane things one can hear from them , as they are n't really in touch with realities because of their poor education , pain , fears , and such things , they need an urgent & dramatic update of themselves from early '90s - are lagging behind for a couple of decades . 
  it happens all over the world . 
  for everyone , who are not those certain 20 small farmers . 
  first of all for big farmers ( big bussiness , of course ) but also for everyone else through taxes and jobs . 
  it 's optimisation of efficiency , which - just as anything else - never lets absolutely everyone be pleased . 
  there are no `` wheat-oligarchs '' in russia , it 's not really a field to become an oligrach , ask poland . 
  big farmers taking lands from small farmers using certain legislation tricks , is not really a big deal . 
  it happens . 
  russia has become the first wheat exporter in the world 2015 , remained that in 2016 and grows the volumes in 2017 , plus incredible rise in other agricultural positions . 
  so , for russia as a whole it must be good all in all . 
   why anybody should be afraid ? 
  hm , not anybody , but you . 
  ask yourself this question as you are obviously too afraid to visit it and to see : it 's really russia , a really great region of russia , - only you can know it why you are so afraid , i have no idea . 
  maybe because you are n't russian ( nor chechen ) ? 
  oh , i see , you post a lot at r/siryancivilwar , prolly you 're so much pained by the russian ( and in particular certain chechen ) units acting in syria ? 
  many terrorists are pained by this , so you are n't alone in this ` grief ' , do n't be sad . 
  the russian psyche includes helping own people , not only using them as slaves , trading them or whatever else of that kind . 
  truth and justice over any laws and money , that 's exactly what russian psyche and culture are , that 's why the west is so shocked and helpless in the realms which go beyond its very narrow narrotive . 
  when you follow the ** real ** and ** worth it ** needs of your people instead of viewing your and any other people as a trading matter , geopolitics and all the rest go well and just perfect , naturally . 
  it 's a tiny region of russia , open the map or better just visit if you are n't afraid of course . 
  belorussia does n't !, 
  :d and this year russia did not prolong something there or so , does n't care about it , for a long time already . 
  formally in , but actually does n't care . 
  two or three years ago adopted certain amendments giving the decisions of the state court priority over the european court decisions , then did n't pay some fees , and also does n't prolong something . 
  i did . 
  and you seemingly did n't finish it ? 
   the council of europe urged it to be adopted by other european organisations , and in 1985 the european communities ( ec ) adopted it . 
  that 's where it starts and where it ends :d vague !, 
  does n't coincide with geography , realities and basically with common sense . 
  who the hell cares what the eu ( and all its councils together with communities ) `` adopted '' , `` designed '' or `` urged '' there , except for the eu of course , who obviously cares . 
   the eu flag is the flag of europe , not just the eu but the whole of europe who told you such a funny thing ? 
   the flag of europe , or european flag is an official symbol of two separate organisations -- the council of europe ( coe ) and the european union ( eu ) . 
   the flag was designed in 1955 , and officially launched later that year by the council of europe as a symbol for the whole of europe . 
  the council of europe urged it to be adopted by other european organisations , and in 1985 the european communities ( ec ) adopted it . 
   lol you think i 'm a ukrainian nationalist . 
  first of all i see that you are poorly educated , that 's the point !, 
   like really dude , you do n't know what a nationalist is . 
  you seem to know it well . 
  enjoy . 
   i 'm from xar ` kov . 
  did you come to there from rural galicia in a permanent traditional search for jobs ? 
   also the whole debacle going on in ukraine makes for a opportune time for putin to take crimea with less backlash . 
  and a `` pro-russian '' ( in what way was he pro-russian ? ), 
  president was a poorer `` opportunity '' promising more backlash ? 
   no , and i never said that . 
  i am asking you , following your crooked logic . 
  russia decided to listen to crimean people 's cry for the reunification only when their lives were in real danger . 
  learn your history ( not the one in which you are convincing yourself of preposterous things like you were the ones who excavated the black sea and taught egyptian pharaons ukranian mova , but a normal one , a real ) , galicia , make an investigation of the struggle of crimean people for independence from ukraine which has a solid history from the very 1992 . 
  all the rest is just too incoherent to even comment on . 
  exactly !, 
  but all in all the same . 
  a withdrawal . 
  and finally an independence . 
  in those times - from the burden of the american colonies , now - from the vague eu . 
  democratic peaceful decision is also a great favorable condition !, 
  that 's quite shady !, 
   if i jump off a skyscraper wrong premise , wrong example . 
  in such a case even this low energy fakenews would n't have such a wording as `` could be '' , would n't make such a vague random phrase ( tweet ) a news , as well as any more-or-less serious person ( that is - having something more-or-less serious to say ) would n't put it in this way `` in possible branches of the future '' . 
  that 's just pain ... and an entire factual mistake .
