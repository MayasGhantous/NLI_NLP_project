  do n't you feel it ? 
  `` low energy ! '', 
  in other words . 
  berlin is generally a permanent disappointment . 
  sad but true . 
  though i have a couple of good friends there . 
  \u00ba\u0644\u035f\u00ba \u00ba\u0644\u035f\u00ba \u00ba\u0644\u035f\u00ba \u00ba\u0644\u035f\u00ba \u00ba\u0644\u035f\u00ba as for coffee ( and other various fancy & refined beverages and food ) - france , of course . 
   a substantial number of tall buildings have been added to london 's skyline since the 1990s . 
  you call them `` tall '' ? 
  that 's pazuzu !, 
  unhappy with the shard . 
   all about appearance . 
  you know who is used to say this , right ? 
  mr obama i hear you , you went even lower , from calling russia 's economy `` in tatters '' to something like `` in the shitter '' . 
  low energy !, 
  maybe you need to update yourself dramatically , in order to solve this riddle how russia 's `` economy in the shitter '' is building what the uk 's `` great '' economy just ca n't , being able to afford only this fancy the shard ? 
  [ lakhta ] ( https://pp.userapi.com/c837234/v837234656/41a3f/lalqoee7z3y.jpg ) ( jun. ),

  spb 's [ lakhta ] ( https://pp.userapi.com/c837234/v837234656/41a3f/lalqoee7z3y.jpg ) center construction site missing just ~ 50 m.to become taller than the tallest tower in the moscow 's federation complex . 
  to be finished in 2018 ( 460 or 465 m. ; will be also `` the second among the us skyscapers '' ) . 
  the key phrase here is ** could be ** . 
  negotiations are n't over . 
   he wrote : `` lots !, 
  i said before ref was dumb idea , other things shdve been tried 1st . 
  ** in some possible branches of the future ** leaving will be an error . '' well , generally , any step one makes can be `` an error '' in `` some possible branches of the future '' . 
  what about other branches of this very future ? 
  something what only estonians can get . 
  thanks , talk to the wall as even a proper education wo n't help there , i suppose . 
  yes , what 's the problem with it ? 
  if you 'd ever get out of r/europe and r/czech at least for a little moment , then maybe you would n't be so shocked by the doings in this world , to be a little finger of which you tried to pretend in such a lunatic and shameless way . 
   how do you know crimeans wanted this independence before your army arrived there ? 
  because it 's populated by 95 % russians and it 's not a big deal to find out their struggle for independence from ukraine and reunification with russia since the very dissolution of the ussr in 1992  do n't be surprised when entire world hates you with these accusations and thinking . 
  hope you will get out of that stone age soon . 
  haha , little boy , you are n't the `` entire world '' , you are n't even the little finger of it , your false pride made you blind and lost in crooked illusions . 
  get back to reality and also get some education . 
   why does n't netherlands take back belgium ? 
  because belgians do n't want this . 
   why does n't mexico take back california ? 
  because californians do n't want this . 
   oh , let 's not forget about `` oppressed '' russian minority on alaska that russia once owned . . because alaskans do n't want this . 
  i understand that in the eu you are n't used to look up to what people want , instead of that just cherishing the authorities and crooked ideology very much , loving to sell double-standards you call `` values '' and such stuff and brits as traditionally the most sane and reasonable have already appreciated it a lot , but luckily russia 's acting in a different manner . 
  you generally love talking to yourself but it seems it does n't really work anymore :d, 
  what absurd are you talking about , your madness at maidan in kiev , when in the center of the capital `` snipers '' shot people and that triggered the mad crowd and that exactly resulted in the violent coup which brought the current criminals to power , and the third year you by some reason ca n't find who those `` invisible russian hackers '' were ? 
  sad , low energy , go find another excuse for burning down innocent elderly , mothers with children and just sane people alive by nazis as you timidly call them `` ultras '' in odessa and in other countless crimes across ukraine . 
  `` ultras & nazis are good . 
  when people - elderly , mothers with children - march against the illegal coup and are getting killed by good ultras & nazis in a most terrible way with all those countless videos depicting everything in details ( and not only in odessa ) - it 's good , people shoudl n't try to protect themselves against good ultras and nazis . 
  ultras are innocent , nazis are good '' - a good ukranian `` logic '' . 
  `` ultras and nazis of ukraine - that 's what is good for ukraine ! '', 
  little ukranian , i have seen too many foreigners studying/speaking/writting russian and even born in russia , etc. 
  for you trying to fool me :d go , post and comment random stuff on `` liberta '' :d, 
  `` human rights in ukraine '' ? 
  halya reporting . 
  thanks . 
  what is this funny fake of `` human rights watch '' or so ? 
  just after all those countless maidan-massacres and the madness that still is on there it looks too absurd , with that '' ... in ukraine '' watching `` russian trolls on the internet '' taking such `` bad propaganda pictures '' of beautiful crimea :d, 
  that 's probably why you are posting random stuff to / r/liberta in russian ? 
  okay , i make no mistake and do n't really care who you are , anyhow you are replying in a perfectly `` ukranian logic '' . 
   if only such `` massacre '' would have happen in donetsk , thousands of lives could have been saved . 
  haha , that 's a truly ukranian answer , so much languid desire i see in it : '' _ if only such [ massacre ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swzcu0fhvbw ) ( yes , it 's without quotations , you watch the video ) would have happen in donetsk _ '' ... no , little ukranian , this world does n't work like that , you ca n't judge it by yourself ( if you do n't want to come to disasterous outcomes ) , not everybody is so coward , undignified and slavish ; when people can , they gon na fight such criminal terrorists , especially when they are well aware of what those terrorists are like , after the odessa and many other `` events '' across ukraine . 
   we do have our own vices , though . 
  `` prozac nation '' , exactly . 
  it 's arguable which is safer . 
  kinda outdated , mister , update yourself dramatically it fits more britain talking to the eu nowadays :d, 
  you are poorly informed , fed much propaganda . 
  stolen from ... ? 
  why is nobody going to take it back ? 
  most important is : _ not from its people _ who were in danger of their lives getting stolen just like in odessa and across ukraine during the nazi madness and thus asked to steal them from this : [ the odessa massacre on may 2 , 2014 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swzcu0fhvbw ), 
  that 's all ? 
  not surprised though . 
  but that 's exactly what your crooked propaganda ( sorry , good media ) is publishing , not i , i 've just decided to repost it so to speak , the essence of it in such a brief ` headline ' to fit in . 
  what a low energy !, 
   slaviansk there is a civil war going on , as good ukraine decided `` to be at war with russia in donbass '' but by some reason never `` at war with russia in crimea '' , maybe because it 's really russia there in crimea and ukraine knows it very well , unlike in donbass they shell it on a daily basis ? 
  that 's it . 
  austria is probably really concerned with all the doings going on over there . 
  this beautiful picture is a propaganda for you ? 
  it destroys and scares you ?!, 
  oh , man , something is really wrong with you . 
  how are you going to oppose the bad propaganda , forbidding people to take pictures ? 
  you do at first , then we will talk , mr pacifir croat . 
  to discuss empty random assumptions , it 's maybe much welcomed in croatia , but is n't really a serious thing . 
   the minority laws will be the same as in crimea and you mean you know anything about `` crimea laws '' ? 
  really ? 
  well , try . 
  let 's see who and how will `` self-determine '' himself . 
  can you `` annex '' it without a single shot fired having 95 + % approval of the local `` nauru '' population ? 
  do , come on , the international law has such an item as `` people 's right to self-determination '' . 
   if crimea now looks anything like it did in 2015 +2016 what are you talking about ? 
  have you ever been to there , generally ? 
  :d the kerch bridge , the highway through the whole peninsula , the simferopol 's airport , the power bridge , completely rebuilt artek children center , two local huge powerplants , [ feodosia 's shipyard ] ( https://pp.userapi.com/c836524/v836524139/64011/s3echs1wffu.jpg ) started [ building various ships there ] ( https://pp.userapi.com/c836524/v836524139/64034/kj1jaaokjz8.jpg ) , compare it to what it looked like [ `` during ukraine '' ] ( https://pp.userapi.com/c837725/v837725060/47dcd/fkuv3ve1tpe.jpg ) ... not to mention their permanent squabble there that the private/tourist bussiness building boom is `` eating up the beaches '' taking everything along the coast . 
   it ca n't afford to bring crimea back to its previous condition to what conditions ? 
  you mean like the new airports , roads , bridges , hotels , resorts ' infrastructure and so on ? 
  for 2014-2016 it got 8.5 bln . $ from the russia 's federal center ( sheer subsidies additionnal to the own local budget ) , it 's what crimea have never seen for the whole two decades of being a part of ukraine , having its budget in 2012 ( ukraine ) as 1.25 bln . $ and in 2013 as 1 bln . 
  ok , keep on dreaming about your `` if `` s and hitler . 
  reported . 
   why are 69 % in russia regretting and only 34 % in ukraine ? 
  because they hope to suck the subsidies , but the hopes are vanishing . 
  maybe because you are the one sucking the eu subsidies more than most ? 
   edit : and plenty of germans in the 50s were sad that hitler lost . 
  there is no questionable `` if '' there . 
  it 's exclusively your `` if '' , `` if '' as the only thing you can generally rely on .
