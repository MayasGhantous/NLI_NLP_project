  do people in greece want to leave the eu ? 
  sorry if i 'm being inquisitive , i 'm just interested in this, 
  this sucks :( is this a result of the eu/imf imposed policies ? 
  i 'm 98 % sure he 's either a troll or one of those / r/politota idiots, 
  i 've lived over half my life in the ` free world ' . 
  i think i got a pretty good idea as to what it is, 
  yeah my bad : - /, 
  / u/shoryukenist has it right . 
  i probably should have used a different word, 
  it 's a good song tho and is pretty catchy . 
  also i thought you were from the baltics : s, 
  also , here is a link to a thread on / r/russia you might find interesting , and should better explain our attitude towards you . 
  honestly , yeah . 
  the baltics are n't important in any way . 
  you guys have too much of a high opinion of yourself , while honestly most russians do n't even give you a passing thought unless asked . 
  also , ` unofficial cyber attack ' ? 
  that easily could have come from anywhere by anyone . 
  saying something does n't make it true . 
  also , i highly doubt it is the official position of the russian federation that your pm is a nazi . 
  it was probably some nut job in parliament . 
  edit : thought you were from the baltics, 
  why the hell would russia ever invade the baltics ? 
  no offense , but to us they are simply ` shitty little countries ' ( not trying to insult , believe it or not ) , that have absolutely ** nothing ** we want . 
  plus , there is always nato . 
  imo , germany should step up to be a great power , but the interests of germany are not the same as the interests of the us , or even of europe or nato, 
  russian here . 
  i agree with you 100 % . 
  i 'm actually sick and tired of europeans saying we are n't ` free ' just because putin is in power . 
  well guess what : i voted for him , everyone in my family voted for him , and all of my friends save two voted for him . 
  i would vote for him again in 2018 but he already said he will retire and not run for reelection . 
  just because our democracy votes for stuff you do n't agree with does not mean our democracy is flawed . 
  i see nothing wrong with russia being a subordinate power to china if it comes to it . 
  you do know the program ended in 1973 , before the russian federation was a country . 
  technically it currently is the finest in the world ever since the cutbacks at nasa, 
  dafuq is up with this fear mongering and clickbait ? 
  worked for me . 
  try this : http://rbth.com/international/2014/07/09/un_confirms_flight_of_500000_ukrainian_refugees_to_russia_38063.html, 
  you 're paying the europeans who are buying from us . 
  in the end , we get money , you get gas , everyone walks away happy, 
  same thing has been happening every year for the past decade : - / . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's the same ` lawmaker ' , too, 
  true , but you could always ask for one , they are about 60 usds for a 6-month visa i think . 
  question is how efficient the russian consulates in poland are , aka the amount of time it will take to process, 
  st. petersburg is pretty inexpensive with tons of historical sights . 
  you can also take a train ride to moscow , but moscow is actually pretty costly for food and hotels and stuff . 
  and moscow gets a little hot in the summer . 
  so st. petersburg, 
  that 's great . 
  we 're getting paid for this gas at least . 
  putin , obviously . 
  if you mean in the eu , farage . 
  guy makes a lot of good points and seems to have a strong following , but a stronger and larger group of people opposing him, 
  not affected by it . 
  kind of like us citizens and nsa spying i guess . 
  well , we would love to , but the west has constantly been pursuing a policy of containment against us and working against russia 's influence . 
  aligning with china is mostly a defensive measure against the west encroaching on russia 's old influence . 
  exactly . 
  that 's why this will never happen, 
  nuclear weapons are a thing, 
  everyday . 
  why would n't i ? 
  he helped cause the collapse of the ussr . 
  the problem was not the reforms , the problem was that they were caused too rapidly , and along with the soviet system which could n't sustain itself , caused the ussr to fall . 
  it is possible that if he and other traitors such as gorbachev slowed down the reforms and stayed away from the disastrous ` shock ' policy , we could be seeing a modern , happy , politically free and economically viable ussr , one without the iron curtain and one that does n't need to plunder eastern europe to exist . 
  i do n't entirely see eye-to-eye with putin , but i completely agree with him that the collapse of the ussr was the greatest geopolitical disaster of the modern era . 
  russia sold alaska because it was bankrupt from the crimea war and there were widespread famines and small revolts . 
  comparatively , it might have been stronger on the world stage , but honestly , who cares about that ? 
  life is vastly better , and ultimately that is all that matters . 
  plus , we have this thing called nuclear weapons . 
  also , our technology is on par with america in most areas , even surpassing the usa in some , like anti-air missiles . 
  i would say modern russia is a lot more secure then the russian empire ever was in its entire lifetime, 
  may he rest in hell for the treasons he committed . 
  most siberians are actually ethnic russians , but there are a lot of natives still even after the conquests . 
  however , they have blended in a lot with the settlers so pretty much everyone there claims ethnic status even when they are not because its hard to disprove and they get some government benefits . 
  i would make an educated guess and say they also support russia, 
  ca n't say you 're wrong, 
  in what way ? 
  different times . 
  it 's not 1867 any more . 
  already served my two years . 
  wo n't say no to serving two more if the country called me up . 
  never going to happen . 
  siberia is an integral part of russia , and most russians , including me , will lay down our lives if the world needs to be reminded of the fact, 
  the guy is bullshitting you . 
  siberia is and always will be an integral part of russia , and i as well as many others will lay down our lives if the world needs to be reminded of that fact, 
  my best friend is . 
  no one agrees with me ? 
  i take it you have n't met a lot of my countrymen . 
  if you 're really so anti-russian already and want to see the fall of my country , nothing i can type will change your mind . 
  just please understand that right now , the federation and its people are more united then ever before , and living better then ever before . 
  i simply do n't see why as a human being you would want to take that away from over a hundred and a half ** million ** people . 
  the chechnyan problem is waaaaay overblown in the west , it was big 15 years ago in 1999 , but now is almost nonexistent . 
  no one wants to rebel or separate , we all understand that russia is the best place for us right now . 
  the rest of the world will be screwed because we have the biggest amount of nuclear weapons , and , should the federation fall , some will almost certainly fall into radical hands, 
  ww3 has been around the corner since the end of ww2 , and i fear it always will be . 
  despite this , we must n't let hate and unjustified mistrust and bad history cloud our judgements of the future . 
  we must all strive for peace - the fall of one of the world 's great powers , especially the one with the highest amount of nuclear weapons which could easily fall into the hands of radicals , will be horrible to that goal and to the entire human race should the worst come to past . 
  the cold war is over , even though its warriors still make current decisions and are subscribed to cold war thinking . 
  despite that , it is time to move on, 
  the empire ?
