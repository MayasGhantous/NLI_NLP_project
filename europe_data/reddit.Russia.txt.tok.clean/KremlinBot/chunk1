the first paragraph is just a lot of bs from a person who does n't know what he 's talking about . 
  do n't project other conflicts on this one because it 's very different . 
  it 's long to explain how much this is a putin-orchestrated puppet show , but there never was a separatist movement in eastern ukraine . 
  the support for armed separatism among the locals stayed [ minimal ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/25/putin-s-number-one-gunman-in-ukraine-warns-him-of-possible-defeat.html ) even after the gru colonel and other insurgent leaders from moscow created all the conditions for the crazies to run around with guns in that particular region of 7 million people ( there 's somehow no rebellion in similar parts of ukraine where the gru did n't show up ) the referendums . 
  those `` referendums '' that the fsb holds in ukraine can not be taken seriously . 
  even if they were n't making up the results ( it 's clear that they do ) , it would still be not normal to hold referendums within a week or two , under a de facto occupation , in complete isolation when only the insanely propagandistic putin tv is allowed to be broadcast and journalists , activists , politicians get abducted and tortured ( often to death ) . 
  i do n't know why you 're getting downvoted . 
  russia had been bombing the shit out of georgia and saying it 's `` local abkhazian self-defense '' etc. 
  it was the same shit . 
  and yes , shojgu ( the current defense minister ) was involved . 
  the kgb wanted that black sea fleet since forever . 
  the latest referendum was rushed and massively fraudulent , its result can not be taken seriously . 
  i do n't know a lot about 94 , but zhirinovsky won the parliamentary elections in russia during that period , so it was a different era of crazy . 
  do you really want to make conclusions based on that ? 
  this article says it all http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/pressure-mounts-for-more-aggressive-stance-against-russia-a-989216.html  later , in a telephone conversation with merkel , putin demanded a unilateral cease-fire , which the chancellor then pushed for in kiev . 
  after ukrainian leaders finally agreed , putin allowed pro-russian rebels to capture several border crossings that have been since been used to facilitate transports of supply replenishments from russia . 
  she 's been the good cop to putin 's bad cop . 
  if you read her bio , she used to head the `` agitation and propaganda ( agitprop ) department '' of the young communists of east germany , or something like that . 
  and she speaks fluent russian . 
  so i 'm not sure if she 's the idiot or the people expecting her to act in the interests of free europe . 
  well , you got the top job in the eu and you were right about putin . 
  things are looking good in terms of relevance . 
  i think you have to be open minded !, 
  the federalization of germany is not such a bad idea . 
  contact your local ~ ~ gru spetsnaz ~ ~ people 's militia representatives for the details ( you 'll recognize them by the thick russian accent ), 
  they are legitimizing putin 's demands and taking his side , which he 's gon na use to escalate the situation further . 
  you ca n't play those games with a thug like putin . 
  if they had an agreement , putin would n't be launching a massive counteroffensive now . 
  the germans are just being stupid here . 
  i 'm saying that the germans are applying pressure on the wrong side , while it 's urgently needed on the other side . 
  btw , they are clearly not volunteers anymore , but regular troops . 
  * some * decentralization is expected from pro-west folks anyway . 
  it was yanukovych who gave himself superpowers after the orange revolution stripped most of them from the president ( like he brought back appointed governors to ukraine regions and so on ) the question is whether they can give putin a little so he can declare victory or he 'll insist on having puppet states in ukraine like in georgia . 
  i just do n't understand how saying this can be on the germans ' agenda when putin is marching troops into ukraine . 
  hundreds of people are gon na die in the next two days just so he can have a little better negotiating position in minsk . 
  just rebuild the wall already !, 
  i know some of you want to , germans . 
  through that i found the following chilling quote which i have n't heard http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_terror#purpose and some idiots argued that the bolsheviks did n't wipe out the potential of the russian people . 
   everything in my freezer is domestic . 
  = the best i can afford is crap . 
   once the ukraine crisis is over i love your optimism . 
  it 's a big question if it 'll be over soon and if it 'll be followed by the latvian crisis , the estonian crisis and so on ( possibly even finnish crisis ) . 
  you should 've stuck to mcdonald 's . 
  there 's plenty of ice and your favorite fodder there , trust me . 
   does that mean the decision has already been made ? 
  they may be bluffing , but who knows with these ex-kgb assholes . 
  i think ukraine has enough to deal with as is . 
  i think it 's not , the title is a bit misleading ( took me five times to get it out though ) . 
  but the `` mc '' is super troubling . 
  i 've read about it before but this is the first time i 've seen a column of troops with it . 
   eurasian union most people i know get shivers from it , and the whole idea of `` asification '' of russia . 
  it 's like a plan of chinese colonization , the first step to actually formalize it . 
  http://abcnews.go.com/international/story?id=82969 http://thediplomat.com/2013/10/is-russia-losing-control-of-its-far-east/, 
  do n't forget about this toy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9a52-4_tornado there were reports that putin used it from rf territory . 
   mainly outside fighters from russia , chechenya , ossetia , serbia , russian neo-nazies etc. 
  and regular rf troops from russian territory unleashing devastating rocket artillery carpet bombings of ukrainian positions that are trying to secure the border . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqkaouidnvo&amp;list=uurxyjhmvbewjirb2yku5euq that was probably the biggest scumbag move right after the terrorist tactic of using civilian human shields that was announced by putin and practiced ubiquitously by the `` rebels '' . 
  the west could help the ukrainians a little to recapture that area . 
  there were reports that strelkov lost an entire platoon of his top fighters ( probably gru ) near the missile launch site snizhne . 
  how hard would it be to push a little further ? 
  thanks for the link . 
  it 's nice to find people who know what they 're talking about in this sea of propaganda and bullshit . 
  [ slawomir sierakowski on putin 's useful idiots in the new york times ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/29/opinion/sierakowski-putins-useful-idiots.html?_r=0 ), 
  is isis also officially led by seasoned , senior cia agents and other washington insiders ? 
  because that 's what 's going on in eastern ukraine . 
  i 'm fairly sure that the guys that are with him are former law enforcement and are technically subordinate to the interior ministry ( territorial defense battalions ) and you saw the regional police chief around him as well . 
  he 's a populist and he 's often overdoing his acting , but calling him a thug is just moronic under the circumstances . 
   gather 5 thousands signatures in 20 days before being allowed to participate in elections and sign all gathered papers with own signature also an important detail is that these are municipal ( totally impotent ) parliament candidates , their districts have on the order of 100k people living in them . 
  so the demanding of 5k verifiable signatures is ridiculous in and of itself . 
  and they can always say that the signatures are fake without an explanation . 
  there are also intercepted phone calls where they discuss the matter , including the youtube video in which he 's being abducted . 
  lukashenko will just issue a decree to implement a proper democracy in 6 months ... additionally , all the officials that either turn out to be incompetent in implementing democracy or try to steal the transitioning-to-democracy money will be jailed . 
  well , you 're not offending * me * . 
  but i 'd really like to get to the bottom of your love for the putin regime . 
  i 've noticed that many greeks feel the same way . 
  i find this weird because if it 's for a religions reason , then you may want to check out the religion of the demonized ( first by stalin , and now by putin ) ukrainian ww2-era freedom fighter , which is also the religion of so many west ukrainians fighting right now for their country http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stepan_bandera, 
  there 's also this ( the first point ) : https://www.facebook.com/dmitry.tymchuk/posts/522348151227178 the rebels have at least 10 [ grads ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bm-21_grad ) , many [ nonas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2s9_nona ) as seen [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tbsevt71bg ) , smuggled from russia , and a proven track record of trying to get civilians ( and journalists ) killed . 
  also , russia is really close to that part of lugansk ( less than 10 km ) wheres the range of grad rockets can reach 45 km and nona mortars ' 12.8 km . 
  here 's what the locals say ( that separatists fired grads at them ) : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iizzxcetccc, 
  not what he said at all . 
  and the woman is a yanukovych party mp ( probably still on his payroll ) this is why ukraine urgently needs new parliamentary elections . 
  which will hopefully take place when the war ends . 
  and what is your problem , `` neutrolgreek '' ? 
  you think putin is the great fighter for orthodox christianity or something ? 
  you 're completely delusional . 
  well , it 's pretty clear why putin wants these expensive assault ships , as his navy chief said :  `` if we had these ships , it would 've taken 40 minutes to invade georgia , instead of 26 hours '' with turkey , romania , bulgaria and the baltic states already in nato , and ukraine , moldova and georgia fighting for their right to join the civilized world , it would be really stupid to empower putin like that . 
  then again , lately the west has been very disappointing . 
   girkin is a retired russian military intelligence gru colonel not retired according to the european council ( they should know ) http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=oj:jol_2014_160_r_0013, 
   now only a handful of people dare to walk in the open near the city hall , barricaded by sandbags and fenced off by the rebels . 
  so the rebel compound , that everybody avoids , which is inside the city , does n't get hit . 
  which is what i 'm saying - the government is clearly trying to avoid civilian casualties at all costs , while the mercenaries do n't care and use human shields every time they can . 
   mass shellings , rocket attacks , and such on cities controlled by separatists . 
  most likely done by rebels to give putin a casus belli . 
  the government troops do n't even respond when the rebels shell them from populated areas , which is pretty much how they fight . 
  this is why it took so unbelievably long to disable the [ nona ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2s9_nona ) that was in rebel hands and killed and injured dozens of troops and civilians . 
  so this guy holds the monopoly on `` the truth '' ? 
  good to know . 
  that is incredibly simplistic and propagandistic . 
  you seem to completely ignore the times we 're talking about . 
  just one example .
