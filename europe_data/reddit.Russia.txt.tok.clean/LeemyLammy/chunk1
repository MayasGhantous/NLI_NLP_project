  can we just not going a full circle this time around please, 
  this looks even more awesome, 
  you were sentenced to 30 years in gulag for blasphemy . 
  i 'm russian and that triggered me, 
  thanks . 
  i have read about it and it seems that they have given this information on official request by the fsb , so it 's not like they were secretly leaking it . 
  it 's bad , of course , and the fact that nashi ( putinjugend ) got their hands on this info and they were calling people about their support of navalny is even worse , but this happened in 2011 and i have n't found information about incidents like this one ever since . 
  chief editor of yandex , elena kolmanovskaya , said in the interview to `` echo of moscow '' : `` the company is very dissatisfied with the current situation and we share the resentment of our users . 
  after our lawyers consider this situation , we will understand what we can do about this . '', 
  so i think it 's safe to use yandex . 
  ( note that i 'm not some yandex pr employee :d ), 
  what did i just read ? 
  from where are you getting all of this ? 
  of course there was some shady stuff with yandex , the most recent one is when their automatic news aggregator did n't show anything about the mass protests on 26 of march , but i have n't heard anything about yandex leaking personal info to the gov. 
  could you provide some proof, 
  it is . 
  it means being lazy, 
  note that the article is pretty lengthy and google made a lot of mistakes in translation . 
  i tried to correct some of them , but there 's still plenty of them translation :  38 % of russians approved the actions of people who went to mass protests against corruption in power on march 26 ( see the graph on page 02 ) , according to a recent survey by the levada center . 
  the same 38 % of respondents believe that citizens have been pushed to this because of the accumulated dissatisfaction with the state of affairs in the country , and 36 % explain rallies by the desire to express outrage at corruption . 
  only 24 % believe that the participants of the rallies have received money for their protest actions . 
   more than 60 % of the respondents `` know well '' or at least `` hear something '' about the protests that took place on march 26 throughout russia . 
  the same survey recorded a sharp decline in the approval of the activities of prime minister dmitry medvedev , who was the main antihero of these rallies : for a month his personal rating declined by 10 percentage points , and the government 's rating by 6 percentage points . 
   interest in rallies is now much lower than during the 2011-2012 protests , although the motives for participation are about the same , says aleksey grazhdankin , deputy director of levada center . 
  then , in addition , those who approved the protests were more than twice as many as those who did not approve , now the level of approval and disapproval is roughly the same , he continues : `` and in 2014-2015 . 
  the level of disapproval of the protests was , i guess , 2 times higher than their approval . '', 
   mobilization of society is falling , but the level of confidence in the authorities is still higher than it was in 2013 , the sociologist states : `` the downward trend in approving of the activities of the government and authorities has been running since 2015 . 
  now the trigger for the changing of the sentiment has been the film of the anti-corruption foundation on medvedev . 
  attitude to putin does not change , and medvedev 's approval has dropped by 10 percentage points due to the film . '', 
   grazhdankin said that navalny 's recognizability and possible voting for him as a presidential candidate reached a maximum : if in april 2011 he was known by 6 % and only 2 % were ready to support him , now 55 % know him and about 10 % could vote for him , and 2 % talk about it with confidence . 
  `` as for now , we can talk about the balance of supporters and opponents of the protests . 
  if the authorities wo n't take countermeasures , the number of supporters [ of the protests ] may grow again . 
  at one time , in order to bring down the wave of protests , [ a number of tv films ] were launched , such as `` anatomy of the protest '' , and the courts , while the propaganda artillery is not deployed yet , nothing prevents it from being launched again . '', 
  gryadkin said . 
   the goverment abstained from commenting the falling rating of the prime minister . 
  `` the rating of the government and the prime minister is traditionally lower than the presidential one , because it is the government that makes unpopular economic decisions . 
  therefore , the reaction of the white house to the fluctuate in the rating is calm , '' - explained the goverment official . 
   it is worth recalling that the representatives of the country 's top leadership reacted to the protests on march 26 very carefully . 
  president vladimir putin said that the fight against corruption should be at the center of the public 's attention , but he does not think it 's right when some political forces try to use this tool for self-promotion before the elections . 
  medvedev said that the task of navalny is to get people out onto the streets and achieve his political goals . 
  the chairwoman of the federation council valentina matvienko suggested that the authorities should listen to the protesters and conduct a dialogue with them . 
   the figure of 38 % who approve of the protests on march 26 needs to be checked , we ca n't draw conclusions that a new protest wave is being formed , believes political scientist konstantin kostin : `` if you look at the dynamics of 2011-2012 , the smaller the number of protests , the more people considered it to be normal if someone comes out to claim their rights . 
  even the maidan did not change the situation , although during the crimean mobilization the readiness to enter the protests fell . '', 
   it is all the more difficult to draw conclusions about the presidential campaign from the data of the levada center , kostin continues : `` the participants of these protests were an already estamblished protest movements , plus those who demanded the solution of a local problems , plus there was a situational reaction of the youth . '', 
  also kostin doubts that the recognizability of navalny has reached 55 % . 
   political scientist alexander kynev considers the figure of 38 % of the approval of the rallies to be colossal , but calls for skepticism - in the media , from which the majority of the population gets its news , the point of view on the protests is only critical . 
   the protest is considered to be socially approvable again , political scientist abbas gallyamov believes : `` first and foremost , this is beneficial to the systemic opposition , which , unlike navalny , will be present in the ballots . 
  the systemic opposition should strengthen the protest rhetoric and watch the growth of their ratings . '', 
  but navalny also has reason for optimism : if such a large number of people do not exclude voting for him , then the number of those who are ready to go onto the streets on his call can go to millions , the expert continues : `` if the authorities continue to do the same mistakes - for example , the prime minister on the day of the protests wrote that he had skied well , or the authorities put the topic of the illegality of the protests on march 26 at the center of the agenda and immediately , after that , demonstratively violated the law by organizing events - then the number of protesters will grown even more . '', 
   putin is interested in the apoliticality and in the quickness of the presidential campaign , gallyamov is sure : `` politicization works against the authorities , the fashion for protest returns , now the less politics , the better . '', 
  in september , in the regional elections , the protest agenda will only become stronger , the expert thinks . 
   elections are far away as for now , it 's possible that an urge for protests will last a year , but it is unlikely , says political scientist mikhail vinogradov : `` 38 % show that corruption can cause a reaction in both the opposition and loyalists camps and allows the opposition to fight for the sympathy of the loyalists . 
  but whether protesters can keep interest in themselves and the rift in society is a question . '', 
  if they can , this will lead to an increase in turnout and a decrease in power indicators , the tactic of 2011 will return - to vote for any party other than the ruling one , he continues , the politicians like yevgeny roizman in yekaterinburg can use this . 
  `` but people do not look after other territories , '' vinogradov said . 
  `` and although there is a temptation to use elections , for example , in the sverdlovsk region as an example of openness , there is no fact that it will interest people moscow or st.
