  now i ca n't unsee this , thanks ... 
  people should n't care about their apartments ? 
  ya seychas vot voobshche nichego ne ponyal , no ya znayu , kak budet velosiped na frantsuzkom : la bicyclette !, 
  white counter, 
  12th of june, 
  it 's one of the main concerns about this law . 
  people would be assigned according to the area of their previous apartments , not according to the their price, 
  i 'm oversimplifying quite a bit here but it 's a protest * against the renovation law . 
  it will allow moscow government to tear down houses which are in need of repair without people 's approval . 
  the story is much more complex though, 
  it 's not only about khruschevks , according to the law , even the kremlin can be demolished . 
  [ context ] ( https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-moscow-protests-demolition-krushchev-era-housing/28487244.html ) also worth noting that alexei navalny attended the protest but was removed by the police when he approached the stage . 
  dmitry gudkov , a prominent russian politician , refused to give his speech because of this . 
  police says 5k people went there , independent source says 20k people . 
  [ kremlin bots are all over twitter right now ] ( https://i.imgur.com/dkoo5kz.jpg ) , spamming that only 5k attended the protest . 
  yes , it is . 
  it 's forbidden to read extremist literature , especially in public !, 
   i guess that 's because of the decades lasting propaganda . 
  and those are russians outside of russia , now try to imagine what 's it 's like inside of russia where all the media is controlled . 
   that probably are even worse than the putin 's regime . 
  actually , no . 
  the communist party in itself is controlled and just a spoiler for the united russia during the parliamentary elections and the head of the communist party is an asshole , but there are some reasonable individual communists . 
  the most recent case : the communists in the duma demanded to launch a parliamentary investigation into the alleged corruption of the prime minister . 
  their proposal was declined the thing about this year 's protests is that they have widened . 
  there 're protests in the citites where people were quiet just 2-3 years ago . 
  it 's true that there were n't that many people in moscow but remember that this protest was n't sanctioned , as a result 1030 people were detained . 
  we 'll see what will happen in moscow on 14 of may and what will happen all across russia on 12th of june , when navalny planned his next protest ( 173 cities are already preparing for this ) they were anti-soviet protests in russia too . 
  for example [ this one ] ( http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/egaristotel/50675427/109458/109458_original.jpg ) ( approx 400-500 thousands of people ),

  i 'm so happy for them . 
  the company has been failing constantly for the past several years , they deserve their bonuses !, 
  heartwarming video, 
  that is the dumbest thing i 've read in this thread . 
  great job !, 
  as far as i understand , the afd has lost its momentum and they have been failing big time recently . 
  can someone confirm or refute this ? 
  sounds amazing , honestly, 
  i think it 's finally time to invent a new economic system : memeism . 
  why dailysabah is n't banned yet ? 
  that 's an interesting bot, 
  does anybody know what nazis did with them ? 
  did they remelt them into metal or just stored them away ? 
  you ca n't eat crimea, 
  funny enough , pizza hunt is n't popular at all . 
   extreme anti-immigrant views . 
  lie  many navalny supporters are extremely anti-immigrant citation needed  in a bizarre video , navalny appeared to compare people from the caucasus to `` cockroaches '' that need to be exterminated . 
  misleading . 
  if the author thinks that all people from the caucasus look like the chechen terrorists , then he 's probably a huge racist  at least some features of democracy . 
  like canceling the elections of the local governors in most of the regions . 
  i can smell the democracy . 
  i 've heard in some of his or his right hand man q & a session that their full and in depth presidential program has n't been published yet and that they will release it closer to 2018 . 
  but take it with a grain of salt because i really ca n't remember where i 've heard that, 
  it 's a short way from a horseshoe theory point of view * enlightened centrism intensifies *,

  whoooooo ? 
  hey , rogozin is pro putin now , so that 's alright !, 
   his views of russia 's external policies start to implement minsk agreements . 
  abandon assad and join the west coalition against isis . 
  introduce the visa regime with the central asia . 
  abandon the euroasian ideology and start to treat russia as a european county both in the external and internal policies . 
  does n't sound too painful for the west . 
  frankly speaking he wo n't return crimea easily ( no one will , really ) but at least he advocates for an honest referendum with the help from international observers and longer period of debating the issue . 
   internal policies bring back the elections of the regional governors , give more power to the mayors , introduce the contract army , judicial reform , abandon hate speech laws , reduce the powers of the president i do n't like his pro gun position though and do n't like the fact that he participated in the russian march ( even though that 's not that big of a deal as everyone think it is ) , also his plan to raise a minimum wage to a 25000 rubles does n't sound too realistic . 
  find all the information about a man with a blurred face only by his clothes and by the way he walks . 
  hwndu season 6 : from moscow with green, 
  if the police will keep ignoring that kind of stuff , eventually people will fight back themselves . 
  this regime in its persuade to hold the power as long as possible is digging its own grave . 
  his doctor suspects that it was zelyonka mixed with some chemical because simple zelyonka can not cause such a long lasting * eye damage, 
  the attackers of navalny have been identified as memebrs of the radical pro-kremlin movement serb . 
  interesting is that they have been invited to the state duma with an `` interesting proposal '' on the day of this attack . 
  these idiots are also known for constantly ruining nemtsov memorial . 
  i hope that some people will be kind enough to gouge out their eyes in return because police obviously wo n't do anything about it . 
  edit : one of the attacker confessed that he was there , says `` he was just filming '' . 
  serb denies the allegations but their leader says `` i wish we participated in this '' . 
  interesting is that the other attacker was leading a storm of the kharkiv 's administration back in 2014 in the attempt to create a `` kharkiv `` people 's '' republic '' . 
  also this attacker is literally one handshake away from putin because he had meetings with putin 's advisor glazyev . 
  he is n't . 
  he said that he hires bodyguards only during the protests and during his visits to the regions outside of moscow . 
  he actually takes a lot of criticism from his supporters because he does n't spend enough money for his own protection . 
  it 's a very strange coincidence but in the last frame of the video , which compared navalny to hitler , [ he was depicted without his right eye and was covered in zelenka . 
  [ vladimir , i 'm already a demon ] ( https://imgur.com/a/k5cdn ), 
  comparing terrorists to cockroaches is now islamophobic apparently . 
  if by routinely running around calling all non-white russians cockroaches you mean doing this just once and comparing not all non-white russians to cockroaches but chechen terrorists , then yes , he 's such a xenophobe !, 
  also he calls for a decentralization of russia so native republics would have more control over their lands . 
  i see that this retarded salon article hit everyone hard, 
   khodorkovsky just another oligarch got rich from bilking yeltsin regime . 
  he stolen billions from the russian people . 
  good , you 've almost got it . 
  now apply this not only to hodor but to putin and all of his billionaire friends and bandits as well . 
  you 've overslept it all !, 
  it 's like they 've opened a witch hunt season or something . 
  4 attacks in 3 days , that 's terrible . 
  he said that his eyesight will heal in a week and his eye will regain its normal color . 
  he also said that if his eye wo n't open tomorrow he wo n't open his new campaign headquarters personally but will send his right hand man to do so . 
  update : he was released from a hospital and held a [ live broadcast on youtube ] ( http://navalnymd.feldman.photo/media/post/rf5myjp-zopo.jpg ) . 
  he was diagnosed with a chemical burn of the right eye, 
  russian opposition leader alexei navalny was hospitalized on thursday , after an unknown man attacked him outside his office in moscow . 
  the assailant sprayed a green antiseptic into navalny 's face , drenching his right eye in the noxious chemical .
