  then , after terror attacks in europe , it was transformed into its current version, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  that 's a very old meme, 
  fair enough . 
  there 's a high possibility that this video was released on the kremlin 's order . 
  lol some user released a high quality video a day after the information was leaked that the kremlin wants to fight navalny like if he was hitler and which was obviously made by myducksvision who are known for being shills for the united russia, 
  they wo n't be next .

  i do n't think that his positions have changed all that much throughout the years , but of course he wants power . 
  no matter if he will be allowed to run for presidency or not but he already became the leader of the opposition or to quote belkovsky : \u0415\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0411\u0435\u0437\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u041b\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0440 \u041e\u043f\u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0438 - \u0415\u0411\u041b\u041e, 
  they are , good thing that navalny has n't been attending these marches since 2012 , then . 
  and russian marches are n't exclusive to the neo-nazis , all kinds of nationalists were attending them , from the neo-nazis , to the radical leftists like national-bolsheviks , to the conservatives and national-democrats . 
  i 'm not playing a devil 's advocate here , i do n't like the fact that he helped to organize one russian march and i do n't like his pro-gun position , but as far as i know he was just on one of these marches in 2011, 
  the only person in the world who would just return crimea without any negotiations is novodvorskaya but she 's dead . 
  at least he calls for a honest referendum , that 's the best you can get , really . 
  for comparison , khodorkovsky just outright says that he wo n't return it . 
  he does n't have any bad ideas about ukraine, 
  i fixed the title : putin and his cronies will use every resource to destroy russia, 
  the kremlin has also released [ this hilarious video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rosjvjieknw&amp;t=168s ) comparing navalny to hitler and to a rapist of your mom and thus [ the meme gates were open ] ( https://imgur.com/a/nenor ), 
  vetoing is just a reflex at this point, 
  ave maria !, 
  i presume that most of the turks in russia are either living in moscow or kazan and they 're probably businessmen or teachers because turkish language is popular among tatars and other turkic peoples in russia, 
  this guy is annoying, 
  i 'd like to welcome turkey into our friendly authoritarian neighborhood . 
  here 's north korea , he 's a good fellow , just do n't disagree with him ever and you 'll be fine . 
  and here 's china , he 's rich but a very , very mean boy and he only cares about himself , so be careful around him . 
  oh , who am i you ask ? 
  well , i 'm russia of course . 
  i 'm sure we can get along , we both had a chance to join a cool `` western boys '' club , but we 're too insecure to try new things , so we stick to our good ol' ways !, 
  we will the best friends , i tell ya !, 
  remember to crush any opposition , to label anyone who disagrees with you as a foreign spy , to rig any elections in your favor ( i see that you 're already quite good at this  , to choke a small business , to persecute a free press , and so on , and so forth !, 
  ps : the summer coup should have won, 
  should i begin to count every single one incompetent and damaging * politician , it 'd take me all day long .

  got ta love this bolton 's sigil on the chest of peter the great, 
  i say , just get rid of this tiny bald person already, 
  there is a small village of putino in russia !, 
  unfortunately it has nothing to do with our almighty leader, 
  lebensraum gone wrong, 
  getting rid of the current moscow 's regime does n't apply breaking up the country . 
  you know what will happen with bashkortostan ? 
  tatarstan will just eat it . 
  tatars and bashkirs are n't really fan of each other , their relationship is almost mimicking russian-ukraine relationship . 
  and most of the regions wo n't be better off without moscow , especially in the far east . 
  it 's so beautiful i want to cry . 
  guilliman will lead us into the new great crusade !, 
  emperor protects !, 
  other than tatarstan and some republics of the northern caucasus there 're really no candidates . 
  other republics are mostly too poor to try to scede from moscow . 
  yes , during the 90s some regions tried to uplift themselves into being a republic ( ural republic , kaliningrad ) but it was n't due to some separatist notions , but because the constitution at these times was unjust and republics had more control over their budget than other regions . 
  there was a referendum for tatarstan 's sovereignty in the 90s but i 'm sure there wo n't be another one because in that case tatarstan would be landlocked by russia in all directions . 
  so most of the troubles in that scenario will come from the caucasus . 
  there 're could potentially be some problems with ingria , karelia , tuva ( which is reaaaally poor ) , sakha and yakutia , but i belive that nothing too serious will happen with these regions . 
  i disagree . 
  russians are a absolute majority in most of the former colonies . 
  what would be the point ? 
  russia can prosper without falling apart . 
  just give more authority to the regions , bring back elections , give people more levers with which they can control elected deputies and governors . 
  of course this will take time and money but it 's worth trying . 
  yes but the problem with tatarstan is that this republic will have to give up all the annual earnings just to compinsate for the amount of money that moscow took and tatarstan already gives 60 % of the taxes to the kremlin . 
  we also ca n't control how these money are spent , for example moscow takes a pretty damn big share from * the regions ' tax money , while it obviously does n't need them . 
  a lot of money from the rich regions goes to chechnya , but the chechens are still poor , while kadyrov buys himself one of the largest private jet in existence . 
  putin in his pursuit for loyalty had taken a lot of power from the regions which inevitably made them poorer , in most of the regions he even canceled the elections for the regional governor . 
  that 's just fucked up , really . 
  i do n't want my republic to feed moscow and chechnya , i want 50 or 40 % of my republic 's money to go to the regions which are really in the need for help , and the fact that kremlin is trying to make us poorer is infuriating . 
  yes , but building villages and cities is expansive . 
  there are some positives though , recently a new town was built near my city . 
  it 's called innopolis . 
  check it out on google , it 's pretty cool . 
  that is an impressive way to avoid answering the question . 
  you argue that russia is objectively evil because a lot of people died throughout history . 
  should russians always think of themselves as the villains because russians killed a lot of russians throughout history ? 
  a lot of land is literally uninhabitable , so it 's not all that surprising . 
  there are also millions of russians who died because of russia . 
  should russians dislike being russians ? 
  you 're really trying too hard, 
  seems like you 're just trying very hard looking for excuses to hate someone, 
  no , thanks, 
  there 's no reason why it would lost its republics if it would be more democratic . 
  telling everyone that russia would collapse if it would be more open is actually one of many putinists ' talking points . 
  i would argue that the harder the grip the more likely it 's that republics would be enraged . 
  the most recent example : president of tatarstan politely told the kremlin to fuck off , because moscow is forcefully taking money from the rich regions . 
  also this map is genuinely triggering . 
  i now know what it was like for the british chaps to see a map without the uk :d, 
  i 'm triggered, 
  what ? 
  this guy just said that this diplomat is uncultured . 
  if the american ambassador would say something like this , people would call him uncultured , too . 
  there is no point in the first part of your message, 
  i like how all of the western media avoided the fact the image which was banned said `` putin voters are like faggots , there are a lot of them around , but none among my friends '', 
  i do n't think that anyone in this thread is trying to claim that they 're some sort of an expert in the hostage rescue operations , however if the mothers of beslan think that the use of force in this case was unjust they should have a right to a thorough investigation . 
  ec decided that * russia had a partial blame in the high number of casualties , kremlin thinks that the verdict was wrong, 
  the first verdict was announced in 2015 and the ec is famous for its long trials . 
  personally i do n't think that the timing is suspicious, 
  it was so cringeworthy . 
  it looks like they just grabbed this guy from the streets a week ago . 
  how is this a blatant attempt to drag attention from anything if the victims and relatives of the victims demanded a trial against russia for using a grenade launchers and tanks in the siege and for not doing enough to prevent this from happening in the first place . 
  the trial began in 2007 as far as i know so it 's not like the european court suddenly condemned russia out of nowhere . 
  god , the comments under this article are pure cancer . 
  the bogpill is very hard to swallow,
