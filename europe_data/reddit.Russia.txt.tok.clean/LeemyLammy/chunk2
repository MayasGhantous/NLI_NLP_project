  i just expanded it a little , i hope that 's okay . 
  original title :  medvedev responded to the accusations of navalny translated article :  prime minister dmitry medvedev responded to allegations of corruption during a conversation with workers at the tambov bacon plant . 
   `` to whom is this profitable ? 
  this is beneficial to those who order this kind of ( compromising ) stories , materials . 
  these are , as a rule , people who have quite specific political goals , '' medvedev said ( quoted by tass ) . 
   the investigation is `` sponsored by private investors '' who seek to `` pull people out into the streets , '' ( quoted by interfax )  oppositionist alexei navalny , who urged the population to go to rallies on march 26 , is called by medvedev as `` a famous character '' who openly declares his desire to become president . 
  he recalled that navalny has a criminal record . 
  the head of government said that `` young people are being put under a law enforcement car '' , which is unfair on the part of politicians who pursue their `` selfish interests '' . 
   compromising materials collected by the anti-corruption foundation ( fbk ) are called `` nonsense and papers '' by the prime minister , tass reports . 
  the investigation itself he described as `` compote '' , ria novosti reported . 
   `` and everything is done on the principle of `` compote '' : they take different dregs , nonsense , they gather it , if it concerns me , my acquaintances , people i 've never heard of at all , about some places where i have been and places that i have never heard of , they gather some papers , photographs , clothes , then create a product and present it , `` he said ( quoted by interfax ) . 
   medvedev noted that he continues to work , as he has `` strong nerves '' . 
   on march 2 , fbk published a large-scale investigation `` he 's not dimon '' , dedicated to the secret assets of medvedev . 
  fbk claims that the head of government purchased them for `` bribes of oligarchs and state bank loans '' using a `` criminal scheme '' based on non-profit foundations . 
  before that , medvedev and his representatives refused to comment on the investigation . 
   the lack of reaction of the authorities served as an occasion for rallies `` he is not dimon '' , which took place on march 26 in almost 100 cities of russia . 
  most of them were not coordinated , which led to mass detentions , including police detaining minors . 
   after the rallies , the russian academic fund called on medvedev to help organize events dedicated to fighting corruption for secondary and high school students . 
  then you 'd have an enormous anarchy state with nukes at your doors . 
  i do n't think that this would be the best solution :d, 
  google translation of the article :  russian president vladimir putin signed a law that allows russians who are under sanctions to not declare incomes and not pay taxes in russia in special cases . 
   the law acts retroactively - from january 1 , 2014 . 
   the bill was submitted to the state duma by a deputy from the united russia , andrei makarov , in march . 
   who specifically needs a new law , makarov did not explain . 
  as medusa learned , the amendments may be beneficial , first of all , to gennady timchenko , who paid taxes for many years in switzerland , but lives in russia because of the american sanctions . 
  this man has no shame left, 
   almost i see that you 're very optimistic :d, 
  there is no law in russia that says killing and abducting gaymen is okay . 
  there is a law that outlaws `` gay propaganda '' ( whatever that means ) and it does n't prohibits you from being gay ( this law is still a giant pile of shit , but it 's important to note that being gay is not a crime in russia ) . 
  chechnya is a veeeeeeery autonomous region , since kadyrov gets an enoromous amount of money from the kremlin to ensure that there wo n't be another war and he can do whatever he wants and in most cases there wo n't be any consequences . 
  basically kadyrov is a feudal lord and chechnya is his little personal feudal state . 
  it 's just disgusting , frankly . 
  islam in the volga region of russia is generally pretty liberal , since islam here has gone through the reformation known as [ jadidism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jadid ) . 
  russia : 1 ) truckers launched a nationwide strike aimed at abolishing the controversial `` platon '' tax , in which heavy vehicles are charged tolls on federal highways .

  [ you all know the answer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pyongyang/ ), 
  he was pretty liberal , that 's true . 
  but that does n't mean that he should n't be hold accountable for his wrongdoings . 
  bribing and lobbying are some serious allegations and should be investigated . 
  but i agree with you on the `` compromise '' part . 
  medvedev is n't a big threat to russia but just another cog in the putin 's absolutely rotten system . 
  putin himself should be number 1 priority . 
  i see 2 giant chinese flags on this map . 
  did you meant '' ... do n't see the us or chinese flag in the eu '' ? 
  almost . 
  russian flag was introduced during the reign of peter 's father alexis i. 
  he invited some dutch masters to build russia 's first frigate , presumably that 's when the russian flag was invented via rearranging the colors of the dutch flag . 
  i see . 
  fontanka reported that the truckers did that , but they asked a local activist , not the truckers themselves . 
  [ some protesters burned down a car in petersburg ] ( https://youtu.be/sfseacolln8 ), 
  `` the court rejected ten of our applications at once . 
  even the call of witnesses . 
  classics of the russian justice . '', 
  said navalny on his twitter, 
  yes , because russians are too stupid to realize that they 're being robbed without the west enlightening them,

  ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=qrwlk7_gf9g ), 
  they 're trying not to speak about it . 
  apparently , the most important news of the day is about eurovision, 
  it 's a protest against the prime-minister in specific and against the current government , including putin , in general . 
  depends on the city . 
  it 's hard to estimate , since protests are n't over yet , in petersburg there 're around 10,000 people . 
  again , depends on the city . 
  in some of them they 're arresting people . 
  so far more than 200 people in moscow were detained . 
  they want a reaction and the answers . 
  a film about the corruption of the prime-minister has been a huge phenomena ( more than 15 million views ) , but the goverment did n't react on it at all . 
  the goverment was trying to outlaw the protests , but in some cities they were officially approved ( kazan ) and the mayor of yekaterinburg praised the protest in his town . 
  doubt it, 
  that 's a temporary measure, 
  you do n't understand how it works . 
  you see , according to the 2014 statistics , there 're 148 russians in iceland therefore iceland is a rightful russian territory . 
  note that this method does n't work with other nations, 
  surely you meant `` the entire britanskaya oblast ' of the russian empire '', 
  reeeeeeeeeeee, 
  the empire on which the potatoes never sets, 
  no gib !, 
  my clay !, 
  that 's why the orthodox church is the best church . 
  1204 and 1453 - worst years of my life . 
  beautiful, 
  this hapenned in kaliningrad , so it 's only natural that they were trying to make it look more western european . 
  as far as i know they 're trying to prepare the city to the 2018 fifa world cup and initially they wanted to restore more buildings but they did n't have enough money , so only 3 buildings were repaired, 
  30 out of 170 councillors of the federal council are women 72 out of 450 deputies of the state duma are women the minister of health is a woman the minister of education is a woman the head of the central bank is a woman and i 'm sure i forgot someone else , so it 's not like it 's a sausage only party, 
  memes are just keep getting real , it 's terrifying, 
  i feel like the term kievan rus ' is kinda disingenuous since it excludes 20 years when the capital was in novgorod . 
  just rus ' would be better, 
  everyone wanted to be rome . 
  he was the coolest kid at school . 
  it is unknown , but there 're rumors that he did n't die , just [ returned to his home planet ] ( http://cs9.pikabu.ru/images/previews_comm/2017-02_1/148595729314727350.jpg ), 
  we may never know because , unfortunately , he passed away 2 years ago, 
  also known as svidetel 's wedding dress edit : to add some context , this guy was a popular russian meme in the early days of runet known as svidetel from fryazin . 
  the meme originated from [ this wedding photo ] ( http://lurkmore.so/images/c/ce/svidetel.jpg ) , he was just so out of place in this picture that it has become popular to photoshop him into different photos where he would look just as equally out of place .

  damn , that 's so cool, 
  you can only serve for two terms so naturally putin stepped down after his first 2 terms but run again after medvedev . 
  in 2008 the bill which prolonged the presidential term from 4 to 6 years has passed . 
  it wo n't for at least 7 more years,
