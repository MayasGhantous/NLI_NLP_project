  because of the whitewashing of soviet crimes in history books, 
  but i think it 's safe to assume that in the most `` no data '' countries the percentage is pretty small, 
  of course it had maritime culture . 
  novgorod rep * ublic had a close ties with the hanseatic league through a seaborne trade , and kiev traded with byzantine through don . 
  it 's just that it never had a considerably large fleet prior to peter . 
  you have n't been in eastern europe , have you ? 
  and `` tipskid '' reminds me of `` deepshit '' for some reason, 
  i like this :d boatland inhabited by the boat-people, 
  i drank tea + vodka `` cocktail '' a couple of times . 
  that was n't the most pleasant experience in my lifetime but it makes you twice as happy, 
  venemaa probably comes from the veneti , which was one of the oldest ethnonym used to describe different proto slavic tribes during the roman empire . 
  as far as i know there is no connection between those venetians and adriatic venetians but i could be wrong, 
  a lot of people here see medvedev as some kind of goofy and modern politician . 
  he loves photography , casual clothing , apple , skiing , science and he wanted to warm up a relationship with the west . 
  a criminal is still a criminal , it does n't matter how he chooses to present himself . 
  great investigation !,

  fair enough, 
  merica is just a teen in his `` you do n't understand me , mom '' phase . 
  soon it will get smarter and will let all of european countries to annex some of their territory , mark my words . 
  ( alaska and california are ours , mkay guys ? ), 
  and you sound like a doomed person, 
  i suppose that by your own standards you 'd against the fact that russia officially hosts the forum for european and american separatists and has strong ties with several opposition figures in europe ? 
  stop rewriting history , everyone knows that he was a famous russian general \u041d\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d .

  apparently , antarctica does n't have lyrics as well, 
  it was polonium disguised as a liver cancer, 
  he was a secret kgb officer , that should be obvious to anyone at this point, 
  everyone is compared to hitler .

  what a beautiful alphabet, 
  i 'd like to ride a camel though, 
  oh , trust me , i 've read dozens if not hundreds of manupilative articles in my life , i mean , look at my flair :d, 
  have you read anything in my reply other than these two words ? 
  1 . yes , it did 2 . that 's also correct however the wording of the article is terrible . 
  facts : as for now , there 're no concrete evidence that russia did it , nato diplomat said that it was likely perpetrated by russia . 
  what the author of the article did : he manipulated the words of a diplomat in the title , so that it would looked as if russia 100 % did this , despite that there 're no evidence that it did that yet . 
  i 'm not arguing that there is 99.9 % chance that russia did this , however this article is manupilative and click-baity ( i doubt that this word exist but nah ), 
  thanks for providing additional and important information, 
  i could give you a boat but you do n't have an access to the sea :p, 
  i said that it 's most likely to be russia  a percentage is quite high in my opinion but this article is objectively bad, 
  what the hell is this article ? 
   nato : russia targeted german army with fake news campaign  lithuanian police is investigating the incident . 
  the address from which the emails accusing the soldiers were sent no longer exists , according to the german defense ministry , but authorities are looking to track the ip-address . 
  so they have no idea but because of lisa-accident , this is russia . 
  i mean , it could be russia , and a percentage is quite high in my opinion , but they do n't know that yet . 
  and this is n't a campaign against german soldiers in lithuania if there was only one accident . 
  and according to the first damn paragraph of this article , nato diplomat said that this was * likely * perpetrated by russia , while the title directly says that this was done by russia . 
  big difference . 
  i feel like this article was written just for the sake of a title and that 's it, 
  please try to say that yougoslavia should have remained a single state to a croat, 
  from a person who understands international law you sure do not understand that if estonia has no territorial claims then there is nothing to return, 
  ok , i have no intent of starting a holywar and i 'm against the annexation . 
  that being said , is it safe to assume that you 're against the existence of kosovo if you think that notions of people of a certain nationality or culture deciding `` their own path '' is unacceptable ? 
  would you be against the independence of scotland or catalonia for example ? 
  edit : and yes , nationality is something more than a citizenship and there is nothing racist in it . 
  it is n't, 
  we 've been trying to take it back for you since forever but we failed , sorry :(, 
  my pants are outraged / s, 
  the most constantinoplian of european cities : istanbul :p, 
  what ? 
  no , it is n't since estonia has no territorial claims, 
  well , i saw that thread and i did n't see any russian that was triggered by the picture , there was just one guy with an isle of man flair , as for the media , that i ca n't tell , since i generally do n't watch russian tv, 
  nohow , nothing 's wrong with it , it was during the traditional parade on the 9th of may, 
  no , it is n't . 
  agree . 
  it upsets me , but if people of the oblast in general do n't want any changes , then it 's completely fine . 
  the notion of renaming the oblast rises every now and then actually and from a different levels : there were several petitions , the head of the administration of a city suggested renaming , the regional duma of the oblast was talking about it , putin suggested that the symbol of the oblast should be kant , not kalinin , et cetera . 
  but every time these ideas just did n't get enough public support, 
  i 'd rather have a historical names too . 
  the place has a rich history , these names mean something . 
  the famous treaties of tilsit were signed in tilsit which is called sovetsk now , which is a pretty empty word . 
  it 's a big shame that the historic names of towns and villages were not returned after the fall of communism, 
  why ? 
  there were many ukrainians before gulag . 
  see : green ukraine for example, 
  this is a flag of the finnish air force or some segment of the finnish air force . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  [ there 's one on the presidential standard as well ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/presidential_standard_of_finland.svg/1000px-presidential_standard_of_finland.svg.png ) edit : nevermind , op posted an additional information while i was writing my comment, 
  stop being evil , poland !, 
  i know you 're the reason why our officials are stealing millions upon millions of rubles and are n't doing anything else !, 
  stop it !, 
  thinking that the economic instability is the main threat to russia , 60 % of people are n't supporting any political party , yet at the same time the majority thinks that the president and the government are efficient and the country is moving in the right direction . 
  how are the people in r/russia combining these things ? 
  well , i mean , of course the government media has been calling the ukrainian government a nazis and a punishers for a quite some time now , but this guy 's claim that a thread about croatia was posted by the russian is utterly stupid . 
  he will blame russia for peeing himself soon . 
  care to provide evidence for this bullshit claim ? 
  the guy who posted the original thread has been a reddit user for 5 years and judging by the first 3 pages of this profile he 's a croat, 
  ivangorod fortress is a castle that was established by the russian tsar ivan the third on * the west border of the grand duchy of moscow , that 's what this is :p, 
  good luck doing that in -20 \u00b0 \u0421 -- -40 \u00b0 \u0421 in that gear :d, 
  fucking hell , that 's so despicable . 
  it 's like pissing on someone 's grave . 
  no dignity whatsoever . 
  [ i will now believe that this is how you imagined me . 
  is it something that happens often to you ? 
  i will murder you to death, 
  you 're now banned from r/vexillology, 
  yeah , pretty much because it was difficult to get an education or a decent job if you was n't a member of the communist party or komsomol , so some people were forced to hide their personal views until late 80s - early 90s,
