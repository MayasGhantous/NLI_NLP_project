  i believe there is no data on the ethnicity of the voters, 
  well he was officially diagnosed with [ an acute intoxication from an unstated substance ] ( http://www.newsru.com/russia/06feb2017/karamurza.html ) , which means he was poisoned in the technical meaning of the word ( like in `` alcohol poisoning '' ) , so even if he was n't poisoned by someone , i believe that my wording is correct, 
  `` he ca n't talk yet , but he consciously communicates with us with his eyes '' says his lawyer [ prominent putin critic was allegedly poisoned not so long ago and fell into a coma . 
  ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/02/03/russian-activist-felled-2015-suspected-poisoning-hospitalized-similar-symptoms/97437612/ ), 
  temple of all religions is an architectural complex , which consists of an orthodox church , a mosque , a synagogue , and a pagoda . 
  edit : i think i should add some interesting facts about this temple , since my initial comment is a bit dry the basis of the temple is actually a childhood home of ildar khanov , which was built by his father and one room of that old house still exist inside the temple , it serves as a little museum of ildar khanov according to khanov himself an angel came to him in his sleep and asked him to build a church . 
  khanov asked him how can he do that if he does n't have any resources . 
  an angel said to him to start digging and people will follow , so the next day he dug for 2 hours when his friend approached him and , after learning what he 's doing , promised to send him 15 masons . 
  and that 's how the work begun .

  after you 're gone , that is, 
  this article is pretty funny , satirical and so on , but no one banned anything . 
  chairman just said that they might add bears to the list of animals which you ca n't keep at homes in cities . 
  the bill with such list will be viewed in duma only in may , so until then your bears are safe . 
  ... and so many opportunities ... 
  it 's called [ metro-2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metro-2 ) but it 's in moscow . 
  no ultimatum !, 
  the strike must be unexpected and precise !, 
  i suggest pushing everyone on to live tube tracks , maybe some of the people would be russians, 
  i for one suggest sending franco-british troops to the us with the purpose of restoring the british rule over its lost colony, 
  what a dick, 
  sorry , i ca n't reply to your message because i 'm blind , therefore ca n't see it, 
  so just some standard balderdash about the west trying to stage a coup , but with the west being germany and poland instead of the us , like in my country . 
  really ? 
  what did he say ? 
  i 'm blind , can confirm , this is true, 
  oh , i guess beating her up is okay then . 
  antifa is copying the nazi methods , as usual , nothing knew . 
   but that seems to be a naive thought for now . 
  for now it is , but who knows . 
  it all comes down to whoever will be after putin, 
  are you suggesting decreasing the russian population by the same methods as the communists decreased the tatar population ? 
  how will they become the majority of the population considering that they 're only 10 % of the total population at the moment ? 
  i guess you will be shocked when you 'll see the flags of slovenia and slovakia :d i did n't read your comment fully , frankly . 
  i genuinely try to avoid any thread regarding crimea . 
  usually it 's too much of a shitstorm from both sides . 
  i 've read your reply now and i generally agree but it 's important to understand that russia wo n't withdraw anyone from crimea in at least 15 years . 
  and even if more liberal government will come to power after putin they might have recognize the situation as illegal but they wo n't just give it up . 
  yes, 
   how surprising for a russian . 
  next time you 'll try to judge people by their flares at least google some basic european flags, 
  latvia : make waifus , not war, 
  i 'm feeling very generous today . 
  want to bring back the good old rivalry between the grand duchy of lithuania and the grand duchy of moscow, 
  hey , lithuania , wan na split it 50/50 ? 
  well , he never hide the fact that he 's a nationalist . 
  he was a frequent participant of the `` russian marches '' . 
  he has a big issues with the russian immigration policies and the big sums of donations to the caucasus region . 
  as far as `` easily became hard line fascist '' , i highly doubt it . 
  he 's a rational man and he distanced himself from the more right wing opposition as soon as he understood that this can be used as a tool against him and that it damages his image in the eyes of the more left wing opposition . 
  i think it would be easier with sevastopol than it is with kaliningrad . 
  sevastopol is much smaller than kaliningrad ( 1079 compared to 15125 ) so it would be easier to take care of sevastopol . 
  i would prefer the scenario in which we would just buy sevastopol , and the rest of crimea would stay in ukraine . 
  i know that this is an extremely unlikely scenario but i think it makes sense : russia would get a so crucial stable military base + a very important city for russia from a historical perspective ; it 's a thousand times more convenient for ukraine to take care of crimea than it is for russia , since the peninsula is directly contacted to the mainland , it was one of the main reasons why crimea was given to ukraine in the first place in 1954 . 
  i think it 's a win-win scenario for everyone , and assuming that ukraine had a very hard time from an economical perspective back in 2014 , i think that we would be able to sign an agreement that would benefit both sides . 
  i believe that sending troops was completely unnecessary and things just got worse for everyone because of that . 
  hahahhahahaha jesus christ , i have n't seen it , this is so awkward , fucking hell ... 
  [ well it can be hard for the burgers to know the difference between the two :p ] ( http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/science/screen%20shot%202013-04-22%20at%202.31.59%20pm.png ), 
  username checks out, 
  this sounds like a good deal , at least yours is funny, 
  i imagine that the main difficulties will be the cases and the stresses . 
  there are 6 cases in the russian language and learning all of them can be quite a challenge . 
  russian adjectives for example have at least 28 different forms depending on the context , sometimes even more . 
  and there is no strict rules on the stresses unlike in the german or the french , but the stress is very important , so it 's just something you need to learn by heart in most of the cases . 
  grammar can be difficult as well , i think . 
  there 're tons of rules and even more exceptions to these rules . 
  phonetic can be difficult but i heard that it 's not that difficult for a foreigner , especially for the germans , but you 're going to have a hard time pronouncing \u042b , \u0428 , \u0429 , \u042d and maybe some other letters , i also heard that it 's hard for some people to understand what the hell is \u042c and \u042a , because those are letters but they have no sound behind them and you just ca n't pronounce them . 
  there was also a big sex scandal when the sex tape was leaked , in which he , victor shenderovich and some other guy whose name i forgot were banging a prostitute simultaneously, 
  well the russian language has a lot of shortened words to make things simpler , a large amount of them comes from the soviet times : \u041a\u043e\u043b\u0445\u043e\u0437 for \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e , \u0440\u0430\u0439\u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u043c for \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 , etc. 
  but the russian language is n't know for the large amount of the long words , it does n't have that much of them , frankly . 
  most of the words are relatively short or they have a medium length , some of the most common are even shorter than in the english : brother - \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442 , with - c , from - \u0438\u0437 , people - \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438 and the thing with the phrase '' \u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0451\u043c \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0435 '' is that you can pronounce is almost as fast as the `` world peace '' if you 're the native speaker . 
  it 's like in the german language - at first you 're going to have a hard times pronouncing something like f\u00fcnfhundertvierundneunzig fast but eventually you 'll do it pretty quickly, 
  kinda like it . 
  `` world peace '' will be '' \u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0451\u043c \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0435 '' which literally translates as `` the peace in all the world '', 
  eduard limonov for example , creator of the national bolshevik party , creating something like this requires some significant brain damage . 
  funny enough , dugin was a member of this party, 
  agree . 
  here you get a feeling that he 's just some professor with a silly eurasian ideology , but when you go outside the runet , it 's dugin all over the place :d, 
  bad teacher is one of the worst things that can happen to a child in school, 
  that 's terrible :d, 
  it 's all just a terrible misunderstanding !, 
  i can confirm it !, 
  and since we 're on this topic i might as well share some interesting story about this word . 
  there 's a hundred years old legend about the famous book by tolstoy `` war and peace '' . 
  in the russian language it reads as '' \u0412\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u041c\u0438\u0440 '' so a lot of people were debating about what he meant by the word '' \u041c\u0438\u0440 '' `` world '' or `` peace '' or maybe both . 
  the problem with this is that until the 1918 reform these words were separate : peace was \u043c\u0438\u0440\u044a world was \u043c\u0456\u0440\u044a the first edition of the book came out by the name '' \u0412\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u044a '' , which translates as `` war and peace '' , so this debate is pretty irrelevant , but the legend is still popular, 
  \u041c\u0438\u0440 means both `` world '' and `` peace '' . 
  it may seem like not that big of a deal to most of you , but it kinda is . 
  i 'm sure that a lot of you guys , who has ever visited st petersburg , visited the st isaac 's cathedral as well . 
  it 's an incredible place , and given of how unbelievably corrupt the roc is , the cathedral will suffer if something wo n't be done about it . 
  and apparently some of the united russia mps [ attacked ] ( https://youtu.be/hqqpwi7boqo ) the oppositionist from the yabloko party , who was against giving the cathedral to the roc , in the city 's parliament today, 
  that 's so impressive , actually . 
  is there a map of that train 's route ? 
  that 's a good thing, 
  heeeeeeeey : c, 
  no , i 'm not . 
  how did you concluded that from my message, 
  fully agree . 
  but i do n't think that today 's escalation will even come close to the cold war . 
  as i said earlier today in another thread : the cold war is the iron curtain , cuban missile crisis , arms race , the korean war , the vietnam war .
