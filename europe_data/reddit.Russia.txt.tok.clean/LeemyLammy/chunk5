  sure , the war in ukraine is terrible , but it 's nowhere near the cold war level of madness . 
  i do n't believe that we have a new cold war . 
  just some snowfall that will inevitably transform into a puddle during a sunny spring day . 
  russia is acting extremly logical if you look at its actions under a presupposition that its goal is to benefit putin and his friends and not the russian people, 
  this . 
  a lot of young people are dreaming to enter the baltic universities . 
  why would they decide to be a part of the motherland again . 
  i ca n't blame some of you for being wary of russia . 
  but suggesting that there could be war between russia and nato is ridiculous . 
   britain 's increasingly isolationist character so what ? 
  britain would still be a part of nato  trump 's unpredictability good thing that you have mad dog mattis now who is pro-nato and who said that the russian actions in crimea are much more severe , more serious than washington and the european union are treating it . 
  and how can russia instigate a conflict in estonia exactly . 
  do you believe that the russians who earn much more in estonia than they would have in russia will suddenly want to join the ever-poor ( ing ) motherland ? 
  the war between russia and nato is impossible . 
  do n't overestimate russia . 
  it has the gdp of italy while it could have had the gdp of saudi arabia for christ sake  the us can protect itself from russia . 
  estonia ca n't . 
  good thing that you have the article 5 of the north atlantic treaty, 
  indeed it would be beneficial for everyone . 
  but i 'm afraid such actions wo n't happen until 2024 at a very least, 
  that the war between nato and russia is impossible . 
  do n't overestimate russian military forces, 
  wow !, 
  it 's almost like all of these nonsensical talks about russia going to war against nato i see on this sub almost on a daily basis are complete and utter garbage . 
  who would have thought . 
  [ make lithuania great again ] ( https://www.stratfor.com/sites/default/files/main/images/polish-lithuanian_commonwealth2.jpg ), 
  i would n't even say that this is the second cold war . 
  the cold war is the iron curtain , cuban missile crisis , arms race , the korean war , the vietnam war . 
  sure , the war in ukraine is terrible , but it 's nowhere near the cold war level of madness, 
  his baseless statement was a reply to your baseless presupposition that `` majority of russians want to discredit the independence of ukraine as much as they can . '', 
  buy our women please , support the economy . 
   europe on the brink of wwiii ? 
  betteridge 's law of headlines . 
  and no , it 's not . 
  next !, 
  because this is n't a professional army . 
  every man from 18 to 27 is obligated to serve 1 year in the army . 
  it 's just a regular citizens and sometimes you will be unfortunate enough to serve alongside with an uneducated thugs and fuckheads like the ones on the video, 
  [ here 's ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/14229935.jpg ) a better one :d, 
  i quite like them . 
  these things are so odd it 's interesting [ photo 1 ] ( http://photogoroda.com/uploads/5281-521739.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/14229706.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( http://nesiditsa.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/naberezhnyie-chelnyi.-bulvar-e%60ntuziastov.jpg ), 
  here is the most famous [ soviet monument of my hometown . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iyynb5o.jpg ) it depicts the motherland as a phoenix and the soldiers beneath her wings . 
  the funny thing is that when this monument was just opened , every citizen of the city was so outraged of how ugly it looked that the special commission from moscow decided that it should be destroyed and its architect should be thrown in jail . 
  they 've tried to blow up the whole thing but they failed . 
  the situation has changed when this monument became semi-famous in the region and turned out that a lot of people actually liked it outside the city . 
  it was even named one of the most beautiful monument devoted to the second ww . 
  so they just stop bothering and leave it there .

   grand duchy of moscow as a settlement of the golden horde , founded by khan mengu-timur appeared only in 1277 . 
  lie . 
  it 's unknown when the city was founded , but it 's know that in the year of 1147 it was already a city . 
   `` moscovites '' were tribes which settled in the vast lands of modern tula , ryazan and moscow in 9-12 centuries lie . 
  moscovites were n't some strange unknown tribe . 
  it was just regular east slavs , the same as in novgorod or kiev . 
  he was the grand prince of vladimir-suzdal  destroyed kyiv lie . 
  he did n't destroyed it . 
  but his actions in the city were cruel , that 's true i did n't read any further because it 's so obviously full of bullshit . 
  try better next time , please, 
   the meeting had not been announced by trump team officials or russian officials , and reports say iceland has not been formally contacted about such an event . 
  sooooo it 's just a gossip, 
   shortly thereafter the russian sergeant produced a bottle of vodka and glasses , and all the men toasted and drank . 
  the life itself is just one big meme, 
  trump will save us !, 
  i wonder to what kind of tartaria they were referring to . 
  kazan was already conquered in 1552 . 
  maybe crimean tartaria ? 
  it was conquered much much later, 
  that was already a pretty big country in 1570, 
   and , sadly but necessary , that 's why we should stop treating them as members of the human kind . 
  i suggest putting those animals in camps . 
  that would be a good solution . 
  the final solution .

  if there is one thing i 've learnt about him , it 's that sergei lukianenko loves some good memes, 
  lukianenko is too busy with his hilarious twitter account . 
  i always have a good laugh when i read his feed . 
  [ example ] ( https://pp.vk.me/c836722/v836722793/15795/2_tpf5t4pya.jpg ), 
  it 's not that typical . 
  order of the russian knights ( the name may sound strange , but their goal was to establish a constitutional monarchy ) , decemberists , narodniks , westernizer , february revolution , samoizdat during the soviet times , the 90s , the list goes on . 
  my point is , it may seems for the people from the rest of europe , that the russians were always * happy with an iron fist , but it 's not true . 
  as long as there was an autocracy in russia , there also was an opposition to this . 
  sometimes it was big , sometimes it was n't big , but it always was here, 
  this, 
  * third rome intensifies *, 
  `` you can take our freedom , but you ca n't take our alcohol ! '', 
  - every russian in history , probably . 
  what would it accomplish ? 
  russia is n't japan . 
  you know that there were plans to transform the outskirts of moscow into `` the snowy wasteland '' if they would have been conquered by the germans . 
  w\u0142adys\u0142aw sikorski who spoke with stalin said to stafford cripps that `` the russians will continue to fight , despite the fate of moscow '' . 
  russians were perfoming the scorched earth tactic of their own land for centuries if it was under attack . 
  nuking moscow and saint petersburg would accomplish nothing . 
  and how do you think the world would react if the us would suddenly attack their own ally just months after the end of the wwii, 
  man , the price on vodka just keeps going up here :( if something wo n't be done this could lead to a great vodka revolution of 2017, 
  give me the control over media and 20 years and the russians will become the greatest freedom lovers in existence , just like they were in the early 90s . 
  just because today 's population was fooled by the kgb agent , does n't mean that the russians were n't one of the main forces which contributed to the dissolution of the soviet union, 
  it 's a win-win situation for everyone !, 
  you must be living in moscow or saint petersburg where the gopniks can afford such a fancy clothing .
