  it 's time for the britain to take its clay back !, 
  well , you can condemn both the us and the russian interferences in others countries . 
  however , saying that the russian hacking ( which has n't even been proven yet ) is an `` act of war '' , like mccain , is very stupid and very hypocritical . 
  i guess you could say that this kinda happened a long time ago :d russia and belarus are in the union state together, 
  `` he persecutes homosexuals '' did the author even read the hrw article which he cited ? 
  the legislation was proposed by the 2 communists and anyone can propose any idiotic legislation in the russian parliament . 
  and btw it did n't even pass . 
  what exactly putin have to do with it ? 
  this guy is fucking hilarious . 
  he 's like a finnish zhirinovsky on steroids, 
  i think you may have just awakened a dragon by calling poland the eastern european country :d, 
  jesus christ , poland !, 
  no wonder someone had to split ya !, 
  finally !, 
  will germany come to the party as well ? 
  i think it 's partially both :d, 
  fair point, 
  that 's a pretty long phrase to yell , while you 're trying to throw yourself at the russian tanks with tons of explosives attached to your body :d, 
  well russia has kaliningrad, 
  what is lithuanian for `` banzai '' ? 
  `` the academics - whose work was funded by the russian science foundation and the us national science foundation - stress that ` high uncertainty ' in ` climatic projections ' does not allow definitive conclusions , and they offer six different scenarios for the speed of the changes '' i guess they just forgot to add this pretty important quote from the original article . 
  '' ` such change should not significantly affect well-engineered structures , ' said the study , implying less well-built constructions would be undermined . '', 
  oh , and this one , i guess . 
  wait , what am i reading again ? 
  @realdonaldtrump : did you folks see a nuclear mushroom above moscow ? 
  it 's yyyyuuuuge !, 
  my twitter feed is filled with the jokes on this topic today . 
  my favorite one : `` hermitage . 
  huge queue ( -20 outside ) . 
  suddenly a scream : `` fucking fuck !!!, 
  what are you doing here ? 
  are you all an art critics or something ? 
  also : [ opening of the fountains in peterhof , 1983 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vseecej.jpg ) petersburg is the cultural capital of russia indeed !, 
  edit : how the heck did the article about the queues outside the museum transformed into another `` russia this russia that '' circlejerk ? 
  i suppose that the intelligence knows pretty much about any russian speaking isis member + tight border control so i think they will be capable of keeping track on them . 
  but i do n't know what will happen if they will come back . 
  as i said the special forces were able to prevent most of the attacks , so maybe everything will be alright , maybe not . 
  as long as there is no another nord-ost or beslan i 'm happy, 
  i always had a special place for the finnish history in my heart and even more special place for mannerheim . 
  what an unique persona !, 
  we even had a memorial plaque installed in his honor not so long ago in st. petersburg . 
  unfortunately some commies , who were unable to look behind soviet propaganda posters , poured it with paint and it had to be taken down . 
  would love to visit your country someday, 
  what a bs title . 
  the only thing in this article that is somewhat relevant to the title is the segment where the author discusses how russia allegedly makes it easier for the jihadists to leave the country and join the isis so they can die in syria and be less of the problem in russia . 
  even if it 's true , well ... fine by me . 
  there were almost no terror attacks for the past 2 years , but there were a lot of supposed attacks which were prevented , so the police and the special forces are doing a decent job is this field as well . 
  i say , let all of those fuckers go , so they can die from the airstrikes or the drone strikes in their lovely desert . 
  certainly not from me , i do n't listen to a lot of music in general :d try out listening to alai oli , it is n't folk music but more like a russian regie . 
  they 're pretty good imo, 
  have you read my comment ? 
  this guy is a deepshit and a fucking lunatic that 's why i said that it 's very bad when courses like these have an ideology . 
  but these an army-like training camps for boys and men have existed long before a war in ukraine . 
  wow . 
  i did n't know about them . 
  they 're amazing !, 
  we actually have a plenty of modernized folk music . 
  it has become quite popular . 
  the few examples that i can pull out of my head immediately are : [ neuromonakh feofan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnpluxog7xq ) [ otava yo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jq0xnjyb0a ) [ reelroad\u044a ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqgwolltodq ), 
  there is nothing bad in these training camps for young boys . 
  it 's very bad when they have some sort of ideology . 
  i participated in one of these courses during my time in school . 
  we were taught how to fire a gun , how to assemble and disassemble the kalashnikov , how to provide first aid , how to build a tent and so on . 
  does this make me a militia in the eyes of the man who wrote this article ? 
  in fact , a lot of schools in russia have these ( or the similar ones ) courses , it helps the young boys to prepare themselves for the army , because participation in the army is mandatory for all men aged 18 to 27 . 
  and imo the skills which i listed above are pretty helpful to anyone even if you 're not going to use them later in your life . 
  technically these things were medical tinctures but everything is an alcohol if you 're brave enough . 
  russia is pretty accurate , especially in the context that 70 + people died here recently because of the cheap homemade alcohol which they were drinking out of despair . 
  well 41 % of the russians are saying that they do n't have enough money for food and clothing ( [ source is in russian ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/economics/26/07/2016/579790cf9a79470210398c81 ) ) . 
  but , hey , we 're strong again !, 
  yep . 
  even russians are protesting . 
  some of the most recent example that i can remember was the `` deceived crimea '' protest in simferopol a few months ago . 
  basically , people wanted to complain to putin that the authorities are corrupt and nothing was done in 2 years to improve the life for crimeans . 
  some of the people got arrested . 
  i 'm sure there is more , but i personally do n't follow crimean news anymore . 
  just got too sick of it . 
  i was n't asked if i wanted crimea to be a part of russia . 
  i do n't want our budget 's money to go to them or chechnya , while most of our regions are in the deep crisis . 
  do n't slay my manly pussy , america , please, 
  jesus , what a cancerous thread, 
  he does n't hate it , it was a joke :d a lot of people were confused , so he even had to clarify his position in the comments, 
  probably , + highly romanticized bandit culture . 
  i 've only recently found out about this channel and have already watched all of his videos . 
  he 's very good . 
  tuva is not an easy topic . 
  it was fully integrated into russia only in 2009 , if i recall correctly , until that some articles of their constitution contradicted the constitution of the russian federation . 
  there were some clashes between the russians and the tuvinians . 
  i guess this can explain such a high numbers . 
  it 's weird though since the tuvinians themselves asked the russian emperor to annex them and russia did n't really want that because this could 've screwed up the relationships with china . 
  edit : i found an amazing article about tuva by famous ilja azar . 
  if there is some russian-speaking people who want to know more about the region , i highly recommend it [ link ] ( https://meduza.io/feature/2016/09/15/tuvinskaya-narodnaya-respublika ), 
  damn siberians ca n't behave themselves !, 
  it is !, 
  i 'm not arguing that :d but i think we can give this post a pass, 
  it is n't on the european soil but culturally it 's european ( [ p1 ] ( https://vladivostok-city.com/uploads/i/bg/502f7a1ece6a76.73034766.821.jpg ) , [ p2 ] ( http://cs413926.vk.me/v413926281/699b/to76ykfn4a8.jpg ) , [ p3 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nuzsb4b.jpg ) , [ p4 ] ( http://static.diary.ru/userdir/1/6/1/7/161764/5353824.jpg ) ) of course , by my logic we can post here american cities , since its culture is heavily based on the european one . 
  so my logic is debatable . 
  but i think we can count vladivostok as a european city since it 's located in the european country with european culture . 
  that 's the most r/accidentalrenaissance photo i 've seen !, 
  yeah , pretty much .
