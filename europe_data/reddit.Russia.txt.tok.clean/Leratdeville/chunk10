  it seems our ancestors did n't finish their antifascist job , and nazis are in europe again . 
  disgusting did you already blame gypsies for all romanian problems ? 
  if not , you can do it right now . 
  it 's totally liberal and tolerant . 
  european union was built on idea that cooperation will help to prevent future wars and you guys want to start wars . 
  they are heroes . 
  you have to apologize, 
  if all the wrongdoings of su are russian fault , then achievements , losses , victories also belong to russia . 
  it 's usually like `` holodomor committed by russians '' but `` soviets won ww2 '' etc. 
  `` apparently '' no he is n't and he never was influential . 
  he was fired from university , month ago he was fired from small tv channel . 
  why would they do this if he controls putin ( that 's what western redditors told me ), 
  concentration camps for gays is totally not something isis would do . 
  kek, 
  why would anybody like a piece of isis in his country ? 
  they won first chechen war , they were independent , nobody forced them to invade dagestan, 
  they did, 
   and again , by what right did russia invade chechnya after the dissolution of the ussr ? 
  chechnya was an autonomous region inside russian soviet republic . 
  it was n't soviet republic ( like ukraine , georgia , kazakhstan ) , it was just a region inside russia . 
  so decades of rule of russian empire do n't matter at all because they had their republic for three years !, 
  wow !, 
  it 's true ussr and ri are completely different states, 
  no , they are more liberal than russian government none of them supported chechens in their gay hunt , they strongly condemned it, 
  we conquered chechnya in 19th century, 
  i can tell you that so-called `` russian nationalists '' care less about gays and fascists than russian government . 
  actually , nationalists are pretty neutral towards them ( it does n't mean they would allow them adopt kids though ) . 
  and for sure they do n't sympathy for dictators . 
  `` we will democratically win because obviously our people will support our ideas . '', 
  maybe if you think putin and dugin are nationalists which is absolutely wrong , then yes , this picture might be true . 
  some of them use/used it , turkey too, 
  turkey is a nato country . 
  why did n't he use m-16 ? 
   chechenya-the-movie . com huh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lebpmz1e1nc, 
   you islamic state people wat, 
  it 's like one drug cartel against other cartel . 
  they are similar but hate each other with passion . 
  no , they just wo n't investigate if some journalists suddenly die, 
  marine le pen is a nazi bitch , breaking news . 
  and water is wet too !, 
  yeah just 200 upvotes ( compared with 7000 here ) and 65 % rating ( compared with 78 % here ) plus in case of map with germany people only want to divide german state , here they actually want to drown 140 millions of us . 
   why so sensitive ? 
  because we all know a big part of users upvoted this picture , do genuinely support this idea  denmark vs sweden banter is just people joking,

  shashlik, 
   croatia : catholic serbs, 
   which , in your opinion is the most beautiful city in all of europe ? 
  i will tell you even more - bronze night is a mutual estonian-russian intelligences ' provocation, 
   but at least he 's not a nationalist like those vile tolerant europeans !, 
  stop being a clown its not funny or entertaining i didnt say this shit , only you say it, 
   the small nationalist parties in democratic european states are the real problem !, 
  if you think so  putin is not , i repeat is not a nationalist !, 
  he is a soviet clown , yes, 
   i 'd even go as far as saying that , who would rightfully take land away from every nationalist state . 
  for his own nation 's good of course as his state is n't nationalist . 
  did i already say that he is n't a nationalist ? 
   he is a glorious anti-nationalist that 's what russian nationalists call him in every tolerant european country there is legal nationalist party . 
  in russia there is none , zhirinovsky is the closest , but he 's a pro-kremln clown , it 's not his real ideology, 
   perhaps a child finds it difficult to correctly differentiate between a normal russian and a tibla ? 
  but for estonian kids there werent normal russians , there were only horde of tibla who occupied , deported them and dare to come into their schools . 
   a second hand interpretation of a single case of school bullying ? 
  not single , i can find many similar cases on forums where people discussed it . 
  and you can not say `` it wuz written on rt propaganda factory '' , that 's all real stories from real people . 
   and here it is people . 
  that smelly smell . 
  smellf of what ? 
  smell of a russian subhuman tibla me ? 
  smell of a scum , animal , living monstrosity putin is a soviet man who does n't / does n't want to understand concept of nation and nationalism . 
  estonian state tries to do something ... and russian parents guess it 's time for their son to be an integrated citizen of estonia , they send him to estonian school and then he is getting bullied because estonian kids ' parents are not so tolerant and already brainwashed their children to hate tibla . 
  that what i fucking heard irl , not from `` estonian propaganda . '', 
  keep deny it ok . 
   so did integration and chances for a better future . 
  except he 's happy inhabitant of stockholm now , working as programmer haha  estonian ubermenschen ? 
  you do know that tibla is n't used for every russian , right ? 
  it is used for homo sovieticus type of russian or nowadays for pro-putin type people . 
  perhaps they were right , considering how much their friends ( i.e you ) believe into kremlin propaganda . 
  but people were bullied for ther ethnicity and they told me about that in real life . 
  where is kremlin propaganda here ? 
   last i checked russia was a nationalistic if one supports putin , then he should also support macron , merkel , hillary clinton since putin is very similar to them in terms of nationalism and ethnic policy . 
  they think russia is defending itself . 
  huh why would i believe you , not them ? 
   the na\u00efve claim  \u00ef so you 're ukrainian , not estonian ? 
  ` russian people are scum ' coming from an estonian is correct . 
  thank god estonians tell it without any russian propaganda . 
  / u/h2ppyme , where are you ? 
  you replied almost instantly but now you suddenly keep silence ? 
  i already have one [ guy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6lw5tv/the_russophobia_myth_appealing_to_the_lowest/djxpdg7/ ) calling russians scum , what stops other estonians from it ? 
  http://i.imgur.com/tir06s1.png now tell me im brainwashed, 
  enjoy http://i.imgur.com/tir06s1.png  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6lw5tv/the_russophobia_myth_appealing_to_the_lowest/djxpdg7/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage ), 
  subhuman treatment comes from estonian society , estonian state is far less radical than estonian society . 
  in r/europe you said that russian people are scum not so long time ago , are n't you ashamed ? 
  if you hold such views towards russia-russians , what keeps you from seeing estonia-russians as scum/subhumans ? 
  now tell me i get paid from kremlin . 
  that 's what people told me straight in my face , irl, 
  maybe stop treat them as subhumans ? 
  yes , ukrainian refugee ;  how was your experience with them ? 
  good, 
  bagged milk ; having a dash cam, 
   civil war triggered, 
  not decade but twelve years ago there were huge protests against the `` direct payments '' scheme .
