  it is still most successful and big protests , much bigger than protests against putin in 2011-2012, 
  english year 3-11, 
  it did n't change , i support same things that i supported before, 
  [ polyushko pole ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04_rdxjquoq ), 
  he speaks good german and english, 
  there was black man among prominent members of this party , right ? 
  scandinavians imo . 
  anyway russians and other slavs age the worst, 
  tigers , bears , wolves , etc, 
  xerox , jeep, 
   do n't really have an opinion - what makes it controversial ? 
  ukraine will lose ~ 2bln $ a year for gas transit, 
  dugin he 's popular among redditors hehe, 
  october revolution, 
  we should make [ amur tiger ] ( http://dinoanimals.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/siberian_amur_tiger-5.jpg ) our national animal, 
  do you like maskinen or ck ? 
  rap scene is huge , predominant language is russian . 
  i think our rap is pretty good . 
  i will re-post some songs i like that i posted days ago here . 
  sweden, 
  capitalism is the reason . 
   i 've always wanted to visit russia , but i do n't speak a single word of russian . 
  other western tourists somehow manage it, 
  no around 90 % young adults do n't know english, 
  soviet rubles ? 
  never , except when talking about soviet union . 
  yes , i 've been there 3 times , did n't like it though, 
   but they became gradually more and more expensive each year , so only the well-to-do families can afford them now . 
  i 've been to summer camps only because my mom 's factory did n't stop soviet practice and provided 50 % discount . 
  sonic youth , placebo , slowdive , kent , the kinks, 
   just look at the major ethnic differences in almost every study there is - russians almost always stick out in the negative way 1 ) it 's not their country ( estonia is a national state which purpose is to preserve ethnic estonians ' culture and language ) so they have always to `` swim against the tide '' and work harder than ethnic estonians . 
  2 ) they were sent as factory workers ( mostly ) . 
  factories closed -  they lost jobs . 
  3 ) they ( russians ) were damaged more by soviets so they have less experience . 
  enlighten us , 
  if such people exist here , they simply do n't leave their home region , since there is no chances they could find a good job , rent apartments , study in university without help of `` diaspora '' . 
  ofc it 's different here in general than in estonia smaller nations inside russia ca n't compete with russian language and they all learn it anyway . 
   there were some of them who kept talking to me in russian even though i do n't understand a single word in russian and it was really irritating . 
   how is this even possible . 
  easy , well you already know your country is segregated . 
  what is more important , they do n't feel they are `` soviet era immigrants '' , they think it 's their home . 
  you need visa for belarus http://usa.mfa.gov.by/en/consular_issues/visas/ for ukraine you do n't need it, 
  belarus has best chances to join eu . 
  if they wanted , they would 've joined eu much faster than ukraine , turkey , russia, 
  it 's pretty fucking annoying, 
  lack of national solidarity homo hominis lupus est - `` a man is a wolf to another man '', 
  mother 23 , father 25, 
   illegal migrants they flee from war and death , they are victims, 
  it comes from french fable `` le rat de ville et le rat des champs '' by jean de la fontaine, 
  well , the question was finland or iceland ;d  i 'd probably just rather go to stockholm or copenhagen in that case if you want to go to a nordic city . 
  good choice although helsinki is very good too, 
  i like cities more than nature, 
  finland iceland looks dull and boring, 
  we did this game with the word `` zhopa '' ( ass ), 
   did you read the books about the bullerby children , by astrid lindgren , when you were young ? 
  no never heard about this book, 
   most of the people on here have beautiful english , despite not coming from countries that speak that natively . 
  i speak english better than 90 + percent of my countrymen . 
  and my english is shit !, 
  idea for portuguese economic miracle : portugal can become european hub for brazilian intellectuals who want to live in richer , less corrupted and violent society and speak their native language . 
  once you controlled big territories in america ; portuguese sounds like russian for many people ; surprisingly portugal is poor compared with spain ; people in mozambique and brazil speak your language . 
   eastern europeans , would your country be able to resist 3 days in case of a russian invasion ? 
  yeah, 
  controversial answer : crimea noncontroversial answer : altai, 
  check this out http://nordicweeks.ru/ we have also days of sweden https://www.mreporter.ru/reports/187417, 
  there are also days of nordic countries , days of france , days of germany , days of spain , maybe some other `` days '' in various cities . 
  it 's boring `` oh balalaika and vodka jokes you 're so original hahahaxaxaxa '', 
  divorced, 
  it looks suspiciously similar to putin 's behaviour, 
  yes he is, 
  the truman show, 
  they sell [ figurines with shitting people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caganer ),

   `` national veterans ' day '' and `` commemoration day of fallen soldiers '' kiitos 1939-45, 
  it 's so weird , the whole city is making preparations for victory day . 
  parade , fireworks , immortal regiment , there will be so many events on 9th may . 
  are you all serious ? 
  ** nobody ** is talking about that shady side of red army here . 
  i heard similar stories many times on / r/askreddit too , but i 'm still suspicious, 
  no we do n't blogs that criticize it but we have communities that love ugly houses and show it in a romantic way https://vk.com/plattenbauten, 
  you can find almost everything in russian , and there are huge barriers between us and the `` west '' . 
  more than 80 % of population have only visited post-soviet countries , you need to get visa , you need money etc. 
  so most people do n't need english language , it 's useless thing for them . 
  a lot of people search for brand clothes ( lonsdale , tommy hilfiger , sergio tacchini , ralph lauren , stone island , fred perry etc ) in our second-hand shops . 
  my favorite conspiracy theory : russia is a crypto colony of great britain since 1917 directly controlled from london . 
  communists ( english and german spies ) came to power and turned it into colony . 
  soon german spies were killed/kicked out and russia became fully british . 
  they call russia a `` british nuclear weapons platform '' . 
  first international https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_workingmen%27s_association was based in london . 
  communist manifesto was published in 1848 in london . 
  conventions of rsdrp ( russian social democratic workers party ) were held in london . 
  in 1848 after publishing of communist manifesto `` suddenly '' in various european countries revolutions started . 
  france , germany , austro-hungary , italy , poland , denmark , switzerland . 
  fans of this theory claim that all these events were just an attempt to destabilize continental europe by englishmen . 
  all russian elites prefer to settle in london . 
  not amsterdam , new york , stockholm , berlin , only london . 
  and sometimes france/switzerland . 
  and so on and so on dmitry galkovsky created this theory https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dmitry_galkovsky, 
   any other countries/universities that you 'd suggest i should look into ? 
  a lot of ukrainians study in poland,
