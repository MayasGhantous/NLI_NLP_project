  jesus christ how do my fellow countrymen even live with kurats like you in one country, 
  you forgot to call me putinist haha, 
  `` because you are not oppressing russians . '', 
  yeah, 
  lithuania is ok , probably best baltic country . 
   ex soviet countries , what do you think of other former soviet countries ? 
  nothing good, 
  [ tarasp castle ] ( http://c7.alamy.com/comp/ag380f/tarasp-castle-in-tarasp-switzerland-ag380f.jpg ) i wanted to see it for many years , my parents bought a photo album with image of this castle on photo album cover in nineties , i really liked this place, 
  come and see, 
  almost everyone here watched klass, 
   i thought nato was a response to the soviet unio and the eastern bloc ? 
  it 's always only `` response '' . 
  `` response '' to `` iranian threat '' , `` response '' to `` north korean threat '' etc. 
  nato was created against russia , what can i feel about it hmmm, 
  probably yes turkey is very active in the ` turkic world ' , they are active in tatarstan plus we have around 100000 meskhetian turks . 
  very common among 35 + yo women . 
  less common among men . 
  they were good guys ( :, 
  tea, 
  stereotypical estonian is very slow, 
  1970-1980 probably, 
  i will not give you money, 
   alcoholic slavic subhumans rude ;(, 
  czech legion stole our gold in civil war ;(, 
   yesterday we had a russian general boasting about walking through finnish lapland to sweden in just two days . 
  can you tell more about this ? 
  poor people , just like us they do n't have their own state . 
  i hope it will change soon, 
  tatarstan has its own president and constitution . 
  that 's why there are actually two presidents in russia . 
  articles, 
  it 's not hard to rule russia but absolutely useless . 
  ( alexander ii ) russia itself is a universe and it needs nobody . 
  ( catherine the great ) did anybody meet an honest man with blue eyes ? 
   one was a true stereotype though - with a stalin 's picture as his computer wallpaper and agitating other russians to not get along with estonians did estonians bully him ? 
   they woudn \u00b4 t help defending our land against hitler . 
  our country answered their treason by ethnic cleansing them after wwii ended . 
  are you hinting at something ? 
  one estonian guy told me there is unspoken directive to help ethnic russians avoid conscription if they do n't want to serve in army .

   can you imagine any other european country shooting down a civilian plane ? 
  yes . 
  it actually happened . 
  sure  why it 's my country and my nation , i 'm scared of where is russia heading to .

  no we are outsiders, 
  yes and no . 
  sexism is pretty strong . 
  at the same time , women retire 5 years earliear than men and live 10 years longer . 
  also if parents divorce and ca n't decide with whom will child live , there is 95 % chance mother will win custody battle , judges always judge in favour of mothers unless they are junkies/alcoholics . 
  blm is a pro-russian tool to destabilize the us with protests . 
  quote from a book foundations of geopolitics of famous fascist and close putin 's adviser alexander dugin  russia should use its special forces within the borders of the united states to fuel instability and separatism , for instance , provoke `` afro-american racists '' . 
  russia should `` introduce geopolitical disorder into internal american activity , encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic , social and racial conflicts , actively supporting all dissident movements -- extremist , racist , and sectarian groups , thus destabilizing internal political processes in the u.s blm is a huge threat to american and european security . 
  eagle and reshka, 
  russian government is n't nationalistic , people are . 
  and that 's not a tragedy , whole eastern europe is nationalistic . 
  read less bullshit articles like `` putin is a nationalist leader '' , talk to at least one modern russian nationalist ( not neo-nazis or otheir idiots ) . 
  many people are deluded , including european/american nationalists . 
  they think putin `` protects white people '' ( what a bullshit ! ), 
  majority of people want to reduce immigration from central asian and caucasian republics , government does n't do it . 
  there are less and less jobs for our citizens , why do we import central asians ? 
  majority of muscovites do n't appreciate what their city [ looks like ] ( http://varlamov.me/img/kurban_bairam12/00s.jpg ) . 
  certain neighborhoods are becoming dangerous . 
  sorry i do n't want muslim ghettos in my city . 
  government oppresses nationalistic movements or fills them with provocateurs , we do n't have any official nationalistic party like front national / afd / pvv / sverigedemokraterna . 
  so basically russia must become normal national state like other eastern european countries . 
  nationalism as a main ideology ; knowing own national interests ; less stupidity ; less oligarchs influence . 
  my country ? 
  economic stagnation . 
  europe , and civilization ? 
  idk edit : oh , ttip will be bad for eu 's economy, 
  i want russians to be like poles, 
  best slavs ; poor man 's austria, 
  nah it 's all just old english propaganda to whitewash their kings . 
  1 ) he is not terrible he is `` formidable '' 2 ) most of bad stories about him look normal if you know what other european rulers did at the time, 
  man who won ww2 ; strong leader who was cruel but fair ( `` if we had stalin today officials would n't rob us like now , he would shoot them '' ) ; murderous tyrant opinions are very different !, 
  my favorite russian conspiracy theory : in 1917 britain-backed communist spies installed communist regime here and turned russia into british crypto-colony . 
  since 1917 this crypto-colony fights for british interests . 
  ww2 was fight for others interests where colony wasted 27 millions of people for kaliningrad , polish danzig , french occupation zone in germany . 
  enemy was defeated but who is the winner ? 
  according to theory cold war is a british-american rivalry . 
  in 1948 soviets and americans almost started nuclear war . 
  who would get profit ? 
  ** britain ** , because their puppets here would survive but the main enemy ( america ) would be destroyed . 
  russia is still crypto-colony , brits control ~ 70 % , 30 % control dutch , french , austrian , german elites , almost all oligarchs , celebrities , top officials choose to settle in london . 
  that 's why russia is so anti american , because it 's just a european gun against americans , even `` english nuclear weapons platform '' .
