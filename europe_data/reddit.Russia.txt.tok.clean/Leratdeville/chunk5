  i heard number of hiv positive people is n't growing anymore in africa . 
  at this point russians should learn from africans how to manage things probably . 
  they 're not against it , let 's say . 
  less people = less pensions leechers etc. 
  more money for yachts and mansions in london . 
   crimeans were in favor of joining russia thats true though, 
   also , rights are funded by russians in the west . 
  only one time when marin le pen got a loan from russian bank . 
  that 's all your `` funding . '', 
  election interference is worse , its tragedy for millions . 
  russa = enemy , dont let them fool you ; syrian pro-assad and pro-putin spies from syrian intelligence are already in western europe . 
  they will rape and rob people , thats what putin commanded them . 
  their goal is to ** undermine west , democracy and freedom . 
  ** they want you to stop believe leaders of the free world , they want you to become racist xenophobic bigot . 
  russian spies orchestrating sex attacks in germany . 
  he is n't nationalist lol . 
  russian nationalists can only dream of political scene like in europe where nationalist parties act open , promote their ideas and ideology . 
  crimea and ukraine thing are just temporary things ( almost forgotten now ) of an old multicultural man . 
  i do n't wan na die in jail , i wo n't protest . 
  you want me to protest and suffer because allegedly russia is trying to undermine eu & nato - your organizations !, 
  ukraine ? 
  well , me and my friends are outraged after what happened in 2014 and what putin did . 
  you 're very spoiled , you want people die for your interests . 
  no way man , no way . 
  die for your eu if you want . 
  as long as your fucking eu hosts russian corruptioners , thieves and oligarchs with their stolen money , you can not teach me anything . 
  beautiful , she deserves it, 
  poland demolished a lot of red army monuments , not only lenin and dzerzhinsky monuments . 
  mmm they taught me in my school that baltic states were forced to join ussr . 
  i remember it was in our schoolbooks , along with molotov-ribbentrop pact etc , but you spread bullshit like all schools teach insane cold war propaganda bullshit . 
  sure . 
  i , some other lads on the internet . 
  `` we '' have nothing to be ashamed about . 
  in the moment of death we will tell `` we did n't hide , we did n't betray , we helped people and we did a right thing , we are not ashamed of what happened in our lives in 2014 . '', 
  `` we '' did n't commit any crimes , putin commited crimes . 
  not-my-government should be ashamed but they 're busy spending stolen money in london . 
  did i say `` putin helped '' ? 
  stop lying and posing as a good man compared with that barbarian !, 
  you , man from finnish national state , definitely know finland would never betray and leave people like russia did in ukraine . 
  to turn this land into sovereign decent national state and end this regressive degrading shithole is my and others duty . 
  maybe they ** should n't ** kill so called `` terrorists '' if they know they will hit civilians ? 
   you are here very busy defending all the atrocities you 've done i am not . 
  in 2014 everyone realized what `` russia '' is . 
  and what ukraine is . 
  and `` we '' never commited any atrocities , we helped people . 
  `` we '' have nothing to be ashamed about , many of us realized what government we have here after what happened in 2014 . 
  if `` russia '' did bad things , why the fuck should i ignore ukrainian shelling and focus on one side ? 
   keep trying to twist the truth with your lies it 's truth about odessa . 
  you ignore it because you 're biased pro-ukrainian man . 
  you will ignore every uncomfortable truth . 
  but you can not hide corpses and dead people . 
  there are photos etc. 
   and knowing the mentality most russians , like yourself , display , it 's very easy to see them shelling civilians whose home they have occupied only to demonize their victim . 
  we did n't donate for volunteer battalions , there were protests with hundreds and thousands of people protesting against war and screaming `` fuck off from there '' . 
  we had newspapers writing against war , journalists saying `` give them freedom ! '', 
  no , we have nothing to be ashamed about , at least in this case . 
  yeah ukrainians spread lies like that all the time . 
  i remember a day after odessa tragedy they 've been talking that only `` tourists '' from belgorod died and nothng to worry about . 
  then it became clear they burned their countrymen . 
  we talk about ukraine, 
   remember that no one recognizes those 3 billions as ukraine 's debt to russia because it will mean ukrainian default, 
  ukraine is killing and shelling civilians in the east you do n't even protest against it , you welcome and appreciate it . 
  ukrainian internet patriots laughed at odessa burning , women died from ukrainian bomb etc. 
  learn from us --  https://lenta.ru/russia/2000/02/19/miting/, 
  sure he would steal some millions , well ukraine is not ideal and ukrainians are not ideal . 
  you say like corruption is something nonexistent in this part of world . 
   putin 's cash made sure it would n't be more possible than that . 
  no , after some years he would just start again talking about signing this agreement to get another money from russia . 
  it would help ukrainian state to survive , just like imf money help them survive now . 
   are you denying that yanukovych spent millions of the public 's money to fuel his lavish lifestyle ? 
  maybe . 
  but every nation has the government it deserves . 
  ok so it 's already `` not literally golden '' hehe, 
  you say `` loyalty to moscow '' , i say `` benefiting from trading with biggest neighbor and taking investments from this country . '', 
   than fixing ukraine 's corruption and integrating ukraine with the rest of europe . 
  under his rule ukraine got as close to europe as possible . 
   so doing a 180 on the eu association agreement just before he was to sign it and propose joining the eeu instead was to benefit ukraine putin offered him ~ $ 15 bln for not signing this colonial agreement . 
   the guy even had a golden toilet he did n't . 
  you spread fake news , my trumpete friend . 
   while most of the country lived in poverty good infrastructure , huge national companies , strong industry does n't like come from the void . 
  ukraine ca n't just make complex things from nothing and sell them . 
   constitutional reforms stifling civil liberties of his people he canceled it . 
   this man had a villa with golden furniture . 
  keep spreading fake news , putinist . 
  he never had golden furniture . 
   the consenquence of maidan was that they got rid of yanukovych and ukraine now leanas towards europe more than ever actually ukraine leaned towards europe more than ever under yanukovich . 
  he is a normal ukrainian nationalist who sucked money from both russia & eu , promoted ukrainization of ukrainian schools and eurointegration . 
  i think he cared about ukraine more than poroshenko . 
  link pls, 
   unlike they 're helping to ethnic russians repatriating to russia they do n't help ethnic russians repatriate ** at all ** . 
  you do n't know what fucking problems people face when they try to get russian passport . 
  it seems their plan is to help everyone * but * ethnic russian repatriate . 
  it seems they get fucking passport 10 times faster and easier than ethnic russian because of diaspora help and corruption . 
  how many votes he got from podesta/dnc hacking ? 
  how many votes he lost because almost all media were anti-trump ? 
  how many votes he lost because of `` grab by the pussy '' ? 
  how many votes hillary lost ( and trump got ) when fbi declared they will continue investigate her few days before the elections ? 
  most of refugees are not even syrian , i do n't know why would bombing ** drastically ** increase anything, 
  colony must fight for other 's interests like in good old 1941, 
  and why do you think moldovan illiteracy is russian fail ?
