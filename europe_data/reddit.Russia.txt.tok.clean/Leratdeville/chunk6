  why do you think it was because of russia ? 
   well because moldova was until 1918 part of the russian empire ... finland and baltics too . 
  yeah but they think they would live like western europeans which is wrong , they would live like modern greeks or portuguese, 
  well , some parts of romania had 20-30 % literacy rate in 1930 . 
  it 's lower than literacy in estonia in 1897 during russian empire . 
  it 's a mistake to think that romania ( and other eastern european countries ) , is poorer than western european countries only because of communism . 
  although many romanians probably think like that ... 
  zhirinovsky and zuganov are too old , to make elections less boring they let this man run for president . 
  you know who will win anyway . 
  exactly !, 
  the best example is when he described the collapse of the soviet union as `` the greatest geopolitical catastrophe '' of the 20th century . 
  but nobody says about the second part where he mentions that break-up of the ussr in 1991 was `` a real drama '' ** which left tens of millions of russians outside the russian federation ** . 
  they found themselves in new nationalist states . 
  kazakhstan , baltics , uzbekistan , turkmenistan they all became nationalist . 
  for fuck 's sake how this is not a tragedy ?!, 
  i partly condemn collapse of the su in the way we have seen in 1991 ** only ** because of this thing . 
  it should 've collapsed more peaceful and mild way . 
  when poles , romanians and balts glorify it , they care about their national interests . 
  `` who the fuck cares about local small genocides ? 
  hooray !, 
  we 're free yay !!! '', 
  well , for a minute think about ** my ** national interest . 
  `` titushki '' are paid sportsmen and `` chavs '' used to suppress pro-european protesters . 
  `` plan shatun '' is an alleged plan of vladislav surkov , putin 's aide , to destabilize ukraine by protests , according to his leaked e-mail . 
  yanukovich was a normal ukrainian nationalist , he ukrainized ukrainian schools , sucked money from russia , almost stopped conscription , slmost signed agreement with eu . 
  he successfully balanced between eu and russia . 
  and corruption ... all of their presidents were and will be corrupted . 
  just like in russia bc thats the mentality of our people, 
   brainwashed putinbots you mean . 
  putinbots are everywhere  russians are to blame for communism , russians alone !, 
  no , we are victims of communism, 
   and who the heck keeps upvoting you ? 
  thinking people with knowledge of history . 
   that was you , dear russian . 
  that was all you !, 
  lies, 
  and why they live worse than us now ? 
  are we still robbing them ? 
  i wonder how, 
  we did n't . 
  we fought against bolshevik scum and you helped bolshevik scum , along with hot latvian boys . 
  we are victims of communism . 
   you still control areas that are not indigenous russian areas . 
  oh , what a fucking russian occupant , he does n't want his country to collapse . 
  i 'm soooooooooo bad if i do n't want it . 
  i 'm soooooo bad i do n't want to ruin achievements of our ancestors . 
  have you asked them ? 
  do they want to become completely independent ? 
  maybe , not all of them are separatists , maybe they have relatives in moscow or saint-petersburg , maybe they work on factories and sell production to various russian regions without barriers ? 
  have you thought about this ? 
   and continue to russify these people ... 
  they russify themselves because their nations are very small and they do n't have much content in native languages . 
  you will never find harry potter or a game of thrones translated into kalmyk language because nobody will do it and nobody will buy such book . 
  we do n't have to do anything , my friend , because our russian sphere is 100x , 500x , 200x bigger then theirs , there are tons of various websites , tv shows , movies , books , games on russian and almost zero in their languages . 
  just few days ago on youtube on trainfever russian stream i saw a conversation between ukrainian schoolboy and other guy , ukrainian apologized for bad knowledge of russian and said he speaks ukrainian at home and in his school they teach polish instead of russian . 
  but he chose to come to russian stream anyway , ** i wonder why ** ? 
  russians suffered from ussr as much as other nations , you will not make me think i am guilty . 
   people were killed and sent to siberia because they dared speak their own language any proof ? 
  nobody banned or suppressed their culture and languages, 
   mari language as a state language is studied in 154 schools . 
  course `` history and culture of the peoples republic of mari el '' is conducted in 353 schools . 
  thus , the study of native and mari state languages covering more than 80 percent of the students 1-9-graders and nearly all the children of mari nationality . 
  the study of the mari language is included in the curriculum , there are n't any talks about elective study of it . 
  we have different sources . 
  are they our colonies ? 
  wow, 
  who is controlling moldova , ukraine and georgia ? 
  who is their master ? 
   elective courses no , it 's obligated . 
  there is already independent baltics , belarus , moldova , ukraine , what else do you need ? 
  you 're very spoiled, 
  they ca n't resist influence of 300x times bigger russian sphere . 
  they marry russians , they go study in moscow and other cities , they move to other cities . 
  mixed children forget mari culture etc. 
   do maris have their schools in mari language ? 
  they have classes with mari language , i do n't know about schools . 
  ~ 40 % of schoolchildren study mari language there . 
  their language is official in mari el republic even though only 42 % of population call themselves mari . 
  looking at 95 % russian speaking narva with estonian official language , you do n't have a right to teach us . 
   you assume that we would say something in a `` conversation yes . 
  something totally non politically correct about the 1/3 of your country . 
  what can that be ? 
  in '90s they loved as so much huh it 's not like we 're better now but this sympathy to alcoholic president was so disgusting . 
  but they obey, 
  you just have to stop oppressing them and be friendly i do n't want russia to invade estonia, 
   however if they are being persecuted by what claims to be a civilized country agree , estonian crimes against russian minority must be investigated, 
  yeah it 's like that . 
  if you obey you 'll be ok . 
  if you do n't , you 're separatist and will be persecuted . 
   because russia does n't a good relationship with protecting non russian minorities they 're good there as long as they do n't oppose annexation . 
  our anti-communists died in civil war . 
  our peasants protested and were killed with chemical weapons . 
  but you portray it as if there was n't any resistance, 
  it was nicer when your country did n't support white army and sent estonian red riflemen terrorists to russia . 
  why they hell you complain if your country helped this communist monster come to power . 
  at first he killed our national elite . 
  then he killed our peasants and ordinary people . 
  then he devoured delicious untouched eastern europe . 
  communist poland is your fault mostly , your people chose to not fight back . 
  i do n't believe in western media .
