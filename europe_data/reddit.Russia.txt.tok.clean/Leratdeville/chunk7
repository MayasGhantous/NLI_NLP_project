  they are owned by oligarchs and spread propaganda . 
   only the ones licking the owner 's ass should be hired that 's like ... everywhere you must be loyal to owner and media have some agenda . 
  what should i talk about russia here ? 
  that they must hire these skilled pro-maidan ukrainian geniuses just to not let them lose life in paris and french salary , smth like that ? 
  if you want to be pro-ukrainian , do it . 
  ** just not for russia 's money . 
  ** you 're being told russia is a piss poor state , but sometimes it ... actually can offer something . 
  this thread is about russia and ukraine . 
  what a mystery !, 
   but you do n't criticize it anywhere near as actively as cherry-picking the consequences it already happened . 
  i do n't know what to do about it now . 
  yes , russian army killed civilians there . 
  i only hope there will never be 3rd chechen war . 
  here is the proof ** proof **, 
   do you criticize as well russian invasion in ukraine yes i do . 
  they turned regions into shitholes , they continue supply fuel for ukrainian tanks ( !, 
  ) , they made thousands of people leave their homeland even though it was easy to prevent . 
  they give passports to '80s actors while poor suffering people from donbass ca n't get russian passports . 
  ;(  you ca n't find anything even remotely resembling grozny during chechnya war there were at least some protests about it . 
  like literally `` fuck off from chechnya '' , `` do n't start war '' , `` do n't make our boys fight '' . 
  meanwhile \u041a\u043e\u0446\u0430\u0431\u0430 was jalied for promoting avoidance of ato conscription . 
  he 's beletsky hiding under fake account bruh, 
  i talk about how easy it was for ukrainians to start shelling cities with their own slavic countrymen and dehumanize them . 
  you know what 's the most sad ? 
  western ukrainians refused participate in it . 
  anti-conscription protests occurred only in western ukraine . 
  so people from the heartland of ukrainian nationalism do n't need this . 
  any proof i 'm paid putinbot ? 
  i care . 
  russia is guilty for massive false brainwashing of people here and there and spreading of false ideas . 
  nothing special for `` russia '' , just another crime in the long list of crimes of this shithole . 
  but if they talk about shot people , i talk about burned people . 
  if i stop talk about burned people , it will be only them talking about shot people and nobody will mention ever burned people . 
  it 's sad but ... that 's how i view it . 
  nope . 
  it 's about ukrainians who shit on us for years and mock everything russian . 
  and then they apply for a russian job just to stay further in paris to not return in glorious ukraine . 
  when they worked for ukrainian service , they shat on russia and posted disgusting articles ( you wo n't know about these articles because you do n't know ukrainian/russian language ) . 
  then they lost a job because ukraine stopped paying and they decided to ... work for russians because ... we were all born and raised in soviet union !, 
  but for years they were extremely russophobic , pro-european , anti-russian until they lost a job . 
  you do n't know these people . 
  i know them good , they wo n't fool me . 
  i know ultra pro-ukrainian man from nikolaev who lived and worked in moscow for years , supported ukrainian nationalism , upa and bandera , eradication of russian language and culture in ukraine , yet he never stopped making money in dirty russia . 
  in 2014 he moved to poznan to avoid conscription , applied and got a job in russian-speaking call centre . 
  hilarious and people like him are ** everywhere ** there . 
  and please answer : will media in your country hire pro-russian journalist ? 
  it 's a fucking one-sided circlejerk where we got insulted and you guys are shining civilized knights . 
  but i definitely know pro-russian journalists are viewed with great suspicion in your country , like everywhere in the west . 
  they have respected european media like euromaidanpress or kyivpost . 
  but they want to work for russians ... why ? 
  i ask people third time in this thread : will media in your country hire pro-russian journalist ? 
  ** honest answer pls **, 
  give me 15 rubles instead of funding azov nazis plox, 
   russia destabilized odessa and this led to six people being shot dead . 
  russian neo nazi were present there you spread this shit for days since tragedy . 
  `` tourists from belgorod '' and other shit , i remember all of it . 
  at the end it 's clear you burned your own citizens of ukraine . 
   i 'm sure ukraine will stop everything they are currently doing once russia removes itself , its weapons , soldiers and money and stops ignoring ua sovereignty . 
  it 's not a reason to shell cities . 
   you can still naturalize everyone from donbass or luhansk who i.e. 
  speak russian or has a picture of putin . 
  noone will cry . 
  i wish i could . 
  but i ca n't help these poor people . 
  they 're trapped between cruel russian state and disgusting ukrainian nationalists . 
   i.e. 
  speak russian ukrainians told me there is no oppression of russian language there . 
  but sometimes real sentiment is becoming visible ; and that sentiment is speak ukrainian or gtfo ** suitcase  train station  moscow ** fucking traitor of glorious ukraine, 
  yes . 
  i was always like that . 
   there 's this thing called freedom of speech . 
  would irish euronews hire ex-sputnik russian journalist ? 
   do n't forget about the whole ussr ukrainian stance : they genocided us damn russians . 
  we 're europeans , they 're mongols . 
  my stance : we suffered from stalin as much as you and we experienced the same famine and repressions . 
  do people with closest mentality and genetics have to hate each other ? 
  they will get rid of it when they stop persecuting journalists , being corrupted shithole full of oligarchs , repent for burning of 40 + people in odessa and calling them * leptinotarsa decemlineata * . 
  that will mean they 're different . 
  soviet degeneracy and `` cannibalism '' , sort of , is still alive there , unfortunately . 
  i ca n't believe czech people will kill , rob and rape slovaks with a pleasure , it 's just impossible for me . 
  and that means they were much more european in 1989 than us in 2016 . 
  at the same time ukrainians are ok with shelling cities and burning people . 
  and russians are ... ** very ** far from ideal also , just to not look like a one-sided propagandist . 
  these people shat on russia for years , why should russian service hire them ? 
  would latvian service hire pro-russian journalists ? 
  by the way ukraine paid for years , from 2009 to 2014 . 
  when they finally became european in 2014 , they stopped paying and even banned euronews . 
  i 'm surprised ukrainians want to work with these nasty mongols ... ah , mongols have money to pay for russian service , and ukraine does n't want to pay . 
  and what is more important - none of ukrainian journalists want to leave paris so they chose to overcome their disgust to just keep living there , even if it means they will be working with russians . 
  i guess ukrainians should n't work with their enemies , it will be betrayal of ukrainian revolution . 
  well , i 'm russian and therefore i 'm degenerate eastern mongol , you always knew that . 
   the difference is that in my country they can actually hold a referendum about this - and it is n't even rigged . 
  yeah sure . 
  and siemens does n't bribe everybody . 
  and money was n't stolen in berlin airport project . 
  but you said `` the less of them the better '' , well at least you want them out . 
  berliners and bavarians live in one country for only 150 years . 
  i wonder when will you give to oppressed nations independence, 
  russian untermensch with destroyed from vodka and krokodil brain ca n't learn it properly . 
  i am so sorry .
