  chechnya is a fucking russian region . 
  why should we pull out troops from chechnya ? 
   making russia more pro western would be in everyone 's interest . 
  west can change russian regime in one month . 
  but i start to believe west needs a boogeyman , a mad dog barking at everyone . 
  it will help to unite the eu , to suppress some pesky countries not wiling to obey brussels . 
  like `` oh you 're angry at eu ? 
  maybe you 're nazi fascist dictator genociding putin puppet ? '', 
  i really think when crimea happened , there was a huge party at nato headquarter , with cocaine and prostitutes . 
  ... because they were finally able to ask for budget increasing again , to talk about russian threat and huge danger from east for all free nations of the free worlds . 
  so yeah i really think there are groups that are interested in cold war 2.0 , here and in west . 
   stuff like radio free europe , and euromaidan have failed miserably . 
  and that 's very good !, 
  :d at least people wo n't believe `` russian liberals '' anymore . 
  they are outcasts , despised and hated . 
  their ideals are rotten . 
  i 'm glad they will never get more than 2 % . 
  they have to become truly ** russian liberals ** or they will just disappear like meaningless tiny ants biting us . 
  even khodorkovsky says russia must become a national state and he is a some kind of nationalist ( word you fear sooooo much ) , for example . 
  i am not putinist , you have to really know russian political scene to know what i 'm talking about . 
  ( and it 's impossible without living here for years , without knowing russian and russian history , mindset , mentality , without reading tons of russian news and historical books ) . 
  there are people jailed for posting a nazi swastika image in social networks here . 
  i do not support it and therefore i 'm against ban of any symbols you do n't like . 
  rest in peace, 
  wikipedia said it 's ravel ; _ ; but yeah when we * liberate * it will be \u0420\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043b\u044c  and \u042e\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432 !, 
  i do not criticize that `` nazism is bad '' , i agree with that . 
  it 's just me observing european mindset , what 's inside your mind , what 's your attitude towards various minorities , ideologoies . 
  it seems you people still live in '30s and consider us untermenschen . 
  pretty symptomatic , was it your grandparent angry after siberian pow camp who put these ideas into your head ? 
   well , together with stuff like this : junkies are scum that 's true , heroin injecting animals destroy their lives and lives of their family members , i have no sympathy for them . 
  so yeah : `` and the same people who went on berlin pride to celebrate european freedom and culture of love , next day will think about me being dead/killed/starving with pleasure . '', 
   digusting terrorist state that tries to destroy my european union you better afraid of america , russia is weak and right parties are n't popular , meanwhile america will colonize you and crush your economy with ttip . 
  that 's the most worrying type of westerners , unfortunately people like you are pretty common . 
  from one side : we have to accept refugees , gays are normal people , nazism is bad , i am a liberal open-minded person . 
  from the other side : drown them in sanctions , starve them to death , watch them dying and collapsing . 
  and the same people who went on berlin pride to celebrate european freedom and culture of love , next day will think about me being dead/killed/starving with pleasure . 
   whenever i see a russian athlete on tv i switch channel yeah ~ ~ cowards ~ ~ brave westerners already booed russian sportsmen who live and train not in russia ( ! ), 
  for years . 
  / r/russia thinks it 's a good time to make tallinn ** ravel ** again . 
   do you think that a different country getting caught in state-run doping programs would have been ignored ? 
  sure . 
  not with brazil , brazil is a weak state , unstable and poor . 
  rich countries can do what they want to brazil and other colonies like russia . 
  but with western countries , it 's clear they do n't even need to invent `` mouse hole '' to change samples , they just give adhd/asthma meds lmao . 
  1917-1947 is a fucking worst decades of endless genocide . 
  we completely lost our national elite and educated people . 
  and ww2 which results are controversial ( we wasted 27 millions of our best people for fuckin polish danzig , french occupation zone in germany and russian piece of shit konigsberg . 
  the bravest people with love in their hearts died , you must be a very good man if youre ready to die for your motherland , to die in your 21 years , to give your young life for this idea . ), 
  oh and also ecpropriation , famines , oppression etc. 
  no , it was wrong to annex crimea, 
  moscow = / = russia do you know this russian proverb ? 
  and yes if i talk about late soviet union , it means i dont mention for a moment not only ukrainian famine victims but also every other suffered nation in the hardest first 30 years of su , including my nation . 
  because russians are the most brainwashed about soviet union . 
  we sold oil during soviet era too . 
  su : we sell oil and live as shitty as moldovans . 
  independence : we sell oil and live ... better !, 
  it 's not true , russians suffered as much as other nations in russian empire . 
  you have to research living conditions in london in 19th century , for example . 
  non-russians suffered too during su but overall we experienced soviet paradise the most . 
  no , su was anti-russian project and russians are the biggest victims of communism, 
  we experienced the same famine , repressions and collectivization . 
  whats your point ? 
  ebil russians genocided ukrainians ? 
  also : here i talk about late su ( 50s-80s ), 
   yeah , because they were robbing everyone around . 
  life in soviet russia was equal or worse than life in soviet ukraine , moldova , armenia . 
  and soviet tajikistan was better place in soviet times . 
  but now we live ** better ** than them , after 25 years of independence . 
  and they live ** worse ** than us . 
  who robbed who ? 
   it 's terryfing that so many russians , including putin , would like to have this empire restored . 
  russians were the only nation brainwashed enough to start calling themselves `` soviet people '' . 
  no any lithuanian or georgian called himself * soviet * , he called himself lithuanian . 
  this brainwashing resulted in what we see today . 
  many of russians are actually ** soviet ** , they consider soviet civilization their civilization , they feel ussr was their state . 
  imperial times for them are like an ancient greece for modern greeks . 
  dpr and lpr are both anti-russian ugly golems created by disgusting russian state . 
  if someone supports ** people of eastern ukraine ** , it does n't mean he supports `` dpr '' and actions of kremlin . 
  do n't insult me even if i 'm russian ( = stinky violent scum in your eyes ) you do n't have a right to discriminate me, 
   you got more natural resources per capita than almost every other nation . 
  i think it 's true for norway , not for us , 
  you want to leave us without resources ... you want to make our nation poorer . 
  you must be honest , ** you do n't like us ** . 
  it 's easier to be a good guy when the percentage of population killed by nazis in your country is 14 times lower than in ussr . 
  who am i if i hate putin and consider this article a cheap shitty propaganda ? 
  ~ 430 euro in moscow for a standard most common soviet 32 sq m flat , it 's not easy to find a 25 sq m apartments here . 
  how do governments manage to work there ? 
  how do officials communicate ? 
  for example , if a building or road belong to two countries , how do they solve problems ? 
  if somethings that belongs to two countries at the same time must be fixed , they have different budgets and officials since they live in different countries , how they do it ? 
  zdravstvuite ( formal ) privet , zdarova ( informal ) with males you must shake hands . 
  is n't ukraine already poorer than moldova ? 
  russian crypto-colony indeed, 
  fun fact : in italy they toured as a `` red army choir '' in the czech republic they toured as an `` alexandrov choir '' well ... you know why , 
  i really like swedish flag, 
   it also felt very strange to be regarded as the `` bad guys '' , it 's not a feeling i am used to as a dutch man . 
  i remember this story , there was a lot of desinformation like monument was blown up / sawed in half , that people were brutally beaten and killed by estonian police , remnants of soldiers buried there were damaged etc. 
  one protester dmitry ganin was knifed and murdered , it was well-known and also fueled protests . 
  you call for genocide right now , your people already committed one genocide against jews , why do you need to kill again ? 
  no u,
