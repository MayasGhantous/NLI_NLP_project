  it 's important . 
  current ukraine includes also former novorossia 's gubernias . 
  that were never considered to be ukrainan before the ussr . 
  ( novorossia was affiliated to ukrainian republik by soviets ** only in 1920 ** , without azov ** and crimea ** ) . 
  it was bessarabia ( odessa ) , ekaterinoslav ( in 1926-2016 named dnepropetrovsk ) , zaporozhie , nikolaev , kherson , azov gubernias . 
  in late xix tavrida also became considered as novorossian gubernia . 
  crimea was part of tavrida . 
  there are another lands in current ukraine not mentioned above . 
  first - part of don host oblast ( don cossack host ) . 
  it was also ever russian . 
  now some of it is in current donetsk and lugansk regions of ukraine . 
  second - lvov and north bukovina ( both belonged to austro-hungrian empire , later lvov was in poland , 1919-1939 and bukovina in romania , 1919-1940 ) . 
  now let me say about some common accepted historical principles . 
  some state may claim or speak about current or former territories if there had been the state at all . 
  with this very territories . 
  thus lithuanians and belorussians may argue about something when remembering the territory of grand duchy of lithuania ( xiii c. - 1795 ) . 
  poles may about lvov ... and similar . 
  anything ( and only territories ) that could be spoken as ukraine is cossack hetmanate ( also named ruthenian state or zaporizhian host ) . 
  the hetmanate was founded by the hetman of zaporizhian host bohdan khmelnytsky during the uprising of 1648 -- 57 . 
  before all this lands have belonged to poland . 
  please , have a time to look at the map . 
  ( i am at your service if you need a link to historical maps on the territories i am speaking here and above ) . 
  no crimea at all . 
  crimea even did not belong to poland . 
  it was part of crimean khanate ( 1441-1783 ) . 
  from 1478 was under turkey ( vassal state of ottoman empire ) , in 1774 was released as a nationally independent state , following the russo-turkish treaty of k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck kaynarca , and formally annexed by the russian empire in 1783 . 
  and named tavrida . 
  ( do you see any ukraine here ? 
  not even poland as i 've mentioned before  . 
  hope you find it interesting . 
  best regards . 
   1783 -1921 as part of malorossia ( ukraine ) wrong . 
  two times . 
  the second time - because ukraine ( especially it became within the ussr ) is not the same as malorossia . 
  though i am not stating that everything is ok with water . 
   crimea was russian only ... you misunderstand the article . 
  it is about autonomous republic , such politico-administrative unit . 
  crimea became russian in 1783 . 
  part of it in 1774 already . 
  i think ukrainians still are . 
  if you listen to them . 
   does what benefits him at the moment his country . 
  does not all the governments supposed to do the same ? 
  this bold statement should be discussed . 
  do they have any ? 
   were they actually kinder to the baltic states sure . 
  they became the allies at once . 
  ask the few jews survived . 
   few years . 
  only if you name livonia independent . 
  sure . 
  and let 's look at the poland map as of 1815 https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kr%c3%b3lestwo_polskie_ ( kongresowe ) # / media/file : congress_poland_in_1815 . png and guess , who have fight all this wars for poland to have the borders it had in 1917 ? 
  i agree . 
  now potus needs to press some for poland to be happy with the price and sign a long-term deal . 
   sure you are . 
  but this is ouroboros . 
  not definition . 
  depends on whom do you call minority . 
  russia do not have enough water in nearby regions right, 
  lot of water was used to make rice plantations in crimea . 
  they are closed now , so not everything is such bad . 
  too big a pipe , unrealistic . 
  better to look at israel and water-saving technology in agriculture . 
  anyway , crimea has lived without dnieper waters until 1960-s, 
   cared more for the strategic goals than the people wrong . 
  go to crimea , ask people . 
  that is it . 
  would european solidarity be so strong as willing to pay more for american liquefied gas ? 
  america insists on such solidarity - and want to sanction european companies that do not want ` solidarity ' with the ns2 . 
   european is arbitrary term . 
  that should be the start - and the end - of discussion , 
  good map , thank you . 
  if we go this way - i should agree . 
  though i 'm afraid that ukrainians would not be so happy , 
  you may refer to the russians as minority . 
  just do remember - you would not be accepted in democratic and liberal europe until you defend the minorities rights . 
  lgbt 's is not enough , 
   culture does n't involve just religion . 
  we have pagan cultural celebrations fyi . 
  who has not ? 
  many in the world are pagans still . 
  does that make them european ? 
   not really , we 're all indo-europeans . 
  as well as half of india and east ( persians and around ) . 
  does not make them any european at all . 
   indo-european ? 
  see above , plus - not true for the finnish , estonian and hungarian - but does not make this countries less european . 
  and do not forget about some \u015al\u0105sk cieszy\u0144ski - present from hitler . 
  that is the point !, 
  at last you do agree . 
  why not to take the land if you can , yes ? 
  they were buying the rains ? 
  or paid for gravitation ? 
   because ww1 has finished in 1918 because you managed to grab some at 1917-1918 from the former russian empire ? 
   culture christian  people different  language english one ? 
  and , sorry , what are the other parts . 
  except geography ? 
  i do not argue with that . 
  and the further the lesser part . 
  i do not want to have different conclusions than now .
