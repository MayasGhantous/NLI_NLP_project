  how you can manage to be not an american . 
  - second . 
  how you can manage to be not an american and be proud of it . 
   visa , mastercard you are right mostly , but at least these two work . 
  ( i was there this winter , used them both for paying and taking cash ), 
   crimea relied mainly on agriculture you know , funny thing is that crimea was and is importing most of it food . 
  and before it came from ukraine , mostly from kherson region . 
  now ukraine closed the borders , so food import goes from russia . 
   russia does n't let its people be openly threatened right . 
  it looks as some of them sincerely can not understand anything except money matters . 
  their logic : russia pays crimea , thus russians should be really unhappy about its ` occupation ' . 
  one russian tourist leaves there at least four times more money . 
  ( and you can see it by the raised prices at the restaurants at the tourist places . 
  yes , i was there this winter . 
  average ukrainian can not afford now vacations there . 
  yes , i was also in kiev year ago . 
  it 's much cheaper there ) . 
  as for the state sector - about 80 % of crimea 's budget goes from russia . 
  thus teachers , pensioners ( and like ) receive now two-three times more comparing to ukraine . 
  yes . 
  but they ( some of them ) complained to the moscow one , when choosing a place to stay . 
  if it 's his apartment - it 's his business . 
  wrong . 
  less and less . 
  the worst is behind . 
  i was there this new year holidays . 
   how is the traffic handled you can not handle the moscow traffic . 
  only by banning it at all . 
  everything in history is natural . 
   even the noah 's flood, 
   in the baltic sea no . 
  because it 's not a sea . 
  it 's a trap for any fleet  even subs . 
   crimea is running out of patriotic euphoria value just lives happily . 
  without euphoria . 
   has not actually gained anything of tangible worth from seizing crimea yes , we are spending money for their support . 
  one thing somebody can not understand , that we are not concerned about it . 
   patrushev called for optimizing water consumption and using alternative options , for example , desalination of sea water . 
  sure , this is the real ultimatum for ukraine . 
  the languages should not be protected . 
  and can not be , alas . 
  the languages rise and fall , and can not be supported artificially . 
   does it make it equally no . 
  the difference is that somebody 's apartment is his private property . 
  it 's a free country . 
   what 's wrong with skinny jeans unfortunately , not all of girls legs should be exposed like this . 
   phobia is irrational by definition it just terminology . 
  and i think that all this phobias ( or anti-s ) have right to exist . 
  in few words - because peoples ** are ** different + have a right to like or dislike some others national features . 
  just be straight and do not deny it if you have . 
  it 's normal . 
  being a right-winged and anti-liberal as i am , i have no privilege to deny the right of having opinions other than mine . 
  the mayor of riga continuously fined for using the russian when communicating with his electorate gives me sorrow . 
  sure , for somebody it is pure fun . 
   i guess you know how every 3 million lithuanian live sure not . 
  though most of people here do know everything about 140 millons of russians   and that style would you agree that we have more ... let 's name it relaxedness opposed to the latvian-german ` ordnung ' ? 
   just because your children ohhhh i am speaking of having many relatives there and visiting them . 
  they say that from that times also some human rights were established , do they ? 
  or it is just silly myth ? 
   being against russia 's regime , against its policies or against the ** people supporting ** such regime or policies , is not russophobic , but plain common sense . 
  and about 90 % of russians are supporting . 
  hence we see it russophobic . 
  logical ? 
   alcoholism is not specific i am not on alcoholism . 
  i 'm not so deadly serious  i am on a style of life . 
   and this is the typical argument now save god , not an argument . 
  why should i try to persuade you ? 
  just an opinion . 
  you really can not understand there how little do we care . 
  ( no offence , just our self-sufficiency ) . 
  ps ( do you read russian ? ), 
  read once again , please . 
  it 's sign . 
  effect of . 
  btw my wife is half lithuanian . 
  so grandfather of my children is 100 % lithuanian . 
  lives in klaipeda now , used to live in kaunas . 
  you can imagine that i know lithuanians not only from tv . 
  though maybe he is not 100 % from your point of view . 
  because he is ` zhmud ' . 
   swedes decided they want it this way not swedes . 
  russians . 
  finnish people just let it stay the same way later . 
  but swedens were the occupants for the centuries !, 
  how you could be so tolerant to them ? 
  nobody else drinks with so much fun and persistence . 
  polacs try , but still can not overtake  mind - such drinking is not the similarity itself - it is sign of deeper similarity . 
  you 've abandoned white man 's burden  if not - maybe they would live now better and not rushing on the boats to europe . 
  right . 
  and we infiltrate them through ` guardian 's . 
  hope you enjoyed this one . 
  be patient . 
  to be continued . 
  we are working . 
   probably a russian paid troll . 
  but sure . 
  look at obama . 
  it 's even worse . 
  no good porn here . 
  we have to smuggle it from germany .
