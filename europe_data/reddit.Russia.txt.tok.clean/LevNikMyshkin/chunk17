  in moldova and baltic states crime rates dropped after legalization of firearms . 
  this radio is owned by gazprom . 
  sure they should know . 
  only beginning . 
  and not all of them . 
   production of 2170 cells for qualification started in december and today , production begins on cells that will be used in tesla 's powerwall 2 and powerpack 2 energy products . 
  model 3 cell production will follow in q2 and by 2018 , the gigafactory will produce 35 gwh/year of lithium-ion battery cells , nearly as much as the rest of the entire world 's battery production combined . 
  https://www.tesla.com/blog/battery-cell-production-begins-gigafactory and yes , it is good for us . 
  but does not improve technology itself . 
   you could always import lng gas from the us as well sure . 
  that what us wants . 
  just pay more . 
  are you personally ready ? 
  hey , guys and gals !, 
  do not whine , be positive . 
  and take a time to think . 
  not just following propaganda emotions . 
  this was an *** open *** poll . 
  participants were asked to name *** any *** ten names that would come to their mind . 
  quickly !, 
  there was no list . 
  what does it mean as you look at the results ? 
  *** only *** 38 % of voters mentioned ( and not necessarily at the first place ) stalin at all . 
  relaxed ? 
  i see . 
  too bad . 
   stalin streets should be renamed had been done in the soviet union already . 
  that is it !, 
  you say he was some small unknown \u0441lerk ? 
  nothing of the kind . 
   the baltic states are in fact building the third reich no such opinions . 
  though there are some suspicions on ukraine , true . 
  silly russians just to not understand the helpfulness of anti-russia sanctions for themselves . 
  they should applause for sure . 
  gas transit money are taken off ukraine and poland and some of it goes to germany . 
  and gas there becomes less expensive . 
  thus for somebody it is wrong . 
  for somebody is right . 
  and very wrong for the us - they still hope to sell their expensive liquefied gas to europe . 
  with ns2 it would be rejected for sure . 
  ( that 's why right now they are thinking of expanding anti-russian sanctions on the ` cooperating ' european companies - to strike them out of the project ) . 
  edit oh , here you are . 
  they even do not try to keep it to themselves . 
   and later this week we 'll have an important announcement on the president 's agenda in terms of how it will help establish american energy dominance . 
   they would take the money and it would be your money . 
  renewable 's energy is much more expensive . 
  are you ready to suffer for the just cause of punishing the russia ? 
   also the safest . 
  and more ecological than solar . 
  considering the waste and damage to nature while producing them . 
   renewables are cheap not yet . 
  they are sponsored by the state . 
  ( except hydropowered , of course ), 
  do you now how they make it ? 
  look at their car battery . 
  just like in your laptop , but much-much more chinese power cells . 
  now think about - how long your phone battery works effectively before replacing ... 
  so it was germans who stopped ignalinos atomin\u0117 elektrin\u0117 ? 
   ( the foolish decision to stop atomic energetics , i agree ), 
  sorry to say . 
  it just means that there are bigger percent of ... hmmmm ... trying to be polite ... ignorant users that open attachments in their mail without using their head , 
   i see russia , i see canadians here , where is russia ? 
  y 're right . 
  the last law states that practically every where there should be ` state language ' used . 
  even as the only one at the preschool education . 
   of trying to suppress ukrainians and their language nothing of the kind . 
  with stalin there was visa versa - forced ukranization of russian-speaking gubernias ( provinces ) that was transfered to the republic of ukraine rather artificially . 
  repeat : 83 % of population thinks and speaks in russian . 
  can you imagine belgium closing french-speaking schools or finland closing swedish-speaking and so on ? 
  why do you you think it 's ok for ukrain ? 
  let me answer for you - everything is ok now if it 's anti-russian . 
  though i have to admit that few of the ukranian mps are for making russian the second state language . 
  let 's see . 
  about genocide - it 's hard to use this word because mostly people of the same nation and the same language fight there against each other . 
  though many ukranian politics dream of something of the kind . 
  the head of the ministry of culture eugene nishuk stated that in the east of ukraine '' *** there is no genetics *** '' , since to these cities the authorities of the ussr were consciously inhabited people https://www.unian.ua/society/1639377-ministr-kulturi-zayaviv-scho-na-shodi-ukrajini-nemae-niyakoji-genetiki-sotsmereji-obureni.html ( this is ukranian source ) if this is not a nazi statement , i do not know what nazism is . 
  about the civil war they have - children in kiev are safe . 
  people are safe . 
  while civilian population suffered greatly from mass bombing in the east . 
  more than 70 children alone killed . 
  does anybody in europe or usa care ? 
  http://nk.org.ua/ukraina/angelyi-pamyati-pogibshih-detey-donbassa-57464 https://www.novorosinform.org/articles/7201 every name fixed . 
  is bombing civilians genocide ? 
  damn true !, 
  as we say here : ukraine is russia !, 
  everything is russia !, 
  except kosovo - it is serbia !, 
  not for ukraine , 
   russia captured quite a territory of ukraine so they say . 
   half of the current ukraine was never ukraine till the soviet lenin-made artificial ` national republics ' borders . 
  not encouraging . 
  forcing . 
  that is the difference . 
  are swedish occupants in finland denied of their language ? 
  used google to speed up translation , so excuse me if ... 
  article 1 . 
  ukrainian language - the only official language in ukraine 1 . 
  the only official ( official ) language in ukraine is ukrainian . 
  article 4 . 
  duty citizen of ukraine speak the state language 1 .
