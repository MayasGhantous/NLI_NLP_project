  but not so bad as it may seem . 
  have a look at the report https://kfcontent.blob.core.windows.net/research/1080/documents/en/newslettermoscowcity2016decembereng-4385.pdf, 
  please , have a look https://kfcontent.blob.core.windows.net/research/1080/documents/en/newslettermoscowcity2016decembereng-4385.pdf, 
  biased article . 
  ok , maybe this changes are wrong , but the real differences made to the legislation are these -- ** only the first beating ** now is the subject to private prosecution , not the public as before ( excuse me if i am not so good at the legal terminology ) . 
  it means that if the beaten wife did not complain this first time , the punishment is not for criminal offence , just administrative ( penalty or short arrest ) . 
  if somebody complained to the - the same criminal offence as it was before . 
  repeat . 
  and only for the first such act . 
  what for was it made ? 
  maybe just too many stories about some family fight - and the wife without a spouse , who is sitting in jail already . 
  there was no chance for the family to set it right . 
  the law had forbidden it . 
  yep, 
  though you have to admit that these buildings do not make such noticeable skyline in reality . 
  agreed, 
   the aforementioned countries will be blackmailed by germany with our gas then  the cruel germans will decide whether to move gas further . 
  i wonder what they will do with the surplus . 
  speaking to yourself ? 
   read infonapalm o sure . 
  this is the ** truth almighty ** i hope . 
  even poroshenko can not point out the ** troops ** few instructors are not the troops . 
  in this way we have american and nato troops there also , yes ? 
   still have problem with finding tenants yep . 
  it 's not for them , though . 
  low market now . 
  oh that twisty !, 
  once i found myself standing at its ground . 
  looked up ... 
  it was like feeling sick after a good drink - it went round and round in my eyes , 
  right, 
  to tell the truth it is not . 
  just good photo . 
  ( look up , i 've send the link to other beautiful pictures by the same guy , and to tell another truth we locals do not like this spot at all  it is too unmoscow . 
  cheers !, 
  ( sorry , cant stop drinking ) . 
  btw this is the photo by dmitry chistoprudov you can find much more at his lj for ex . 
  from this page http://chistoprudov.livejournal.com/196035.html, 
   more resources spent on more socially productive let 's hope . 
  i am not against . 
  i do respect your point of view . 
  it is really desirable . 
  just do not leave somebody unemployed cutting his job at the munition factory . 
  he will not understand such money savings . 
  the sevastopol rent was ending in 2017 though . 
  what is the difference for a man where he should get his salary ? 
   source ? 
  you 're right . 
  only his words . 
  nothing written . 
  weaponry , not weaponry , what is the difference ? 
  workers are paid more than janitors . 
  that matters . 
  i love lithuanians . 
  nice people . 
  very like us ( or we are if you like ) , 
  i 'm here for less than a week . 
  but please leave your irony for yourself . 
  ukranians are our brotherhood nation . 
  and it 's a pity to look at what they have . 
  the did n't deserve it . 
  yes , i was in kiev year ago . 
   about the rights of ethnic russians  port of sevastopol both . 
  coincided . 
  but even ukranians can not find one . 
  we do pray here for the ukraine to have a successful democracy . 
  i hope to see it in my life . 
  hope it 'll stop the civil war . 
  nobody is interested at failed state on their border . 
  thank you . 
   why russia took crimea we do not need us fleet in the crimea  continues to fight in east-ukraine there were/are no our troops . 
  though we help the locals . 
  p.s i visited crimea this winter . 
  people are really happy the way it went . 
   shrank like 2 times after 2014 events a ) it 's all about oil price , not some events . 
  b ) not two times if you are not looking only at the imported goods . 
  he does . 
  naive guy he was . 
  woe to argentina !, 
   weeee are the champions , weeee are the champions , weeee are the champions ... of the world !, 
   thank you . 
  europe will not become more or less reliant on our gas . 
  it would be the same gas at the same needed amount . 
  it 's just that poland and mainly ukraine will lose their gas transit piece of pie . 
  those pieces will go to germany and to buyers in europe . 
  nato already has greece and ... ups , turkey . 
  sure . 
  and turkey is also nato member . 
  if something ... whose side would the join army fight at ? 
  i see . 
  you do not know . 
  please , look at salis . 
  http://www.nato.int/cps/bu/natohq/topics_50106.htm it is working from 2006 and can not be replaced with anything as effective till now . 
  alas , even us can not provide such capability . 
  and guess whose are the cargo planes . 
  and what will happen if under this contract nato should try to quickly move their forces towards russia borders , not in some afganistan . 
  i mean that money should be spent . 
  in any way . 
  not saved in some vault or american treasury bonds . 
  thus the worker receives a salary , brings the money to the butcher and grocery and so on and so on .
