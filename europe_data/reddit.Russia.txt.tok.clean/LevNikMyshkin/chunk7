  misunderstood and misinterpreted . 
  sincere or expressly ? 
  let me explain . 
  this was an ** open ** poll . 
  participants were asked to name ** any ten ** names of influential in history people that would come to their mind . 
  quickly !, 
  by phone , in a minute . 
  there was ** no list ** to choose from and/or to compare . 
  try yourself  what does it mean as you look at the results ? 
  only 38 % of voters mentioned ( and not necessarily at the first place ) stalin at all . 
  just remembered . 
  and just 38 % . 
  relaxed ? 
    your government goes crazy whenever someb i do not see it, 
   instead of making the lives of russian people better . 
  the joke is that we began to live better only after stopping to fulfill western advises and follow their politics . 
  grand-grand dad of my wife was a faithful soldier of the empire . 
   never in the history o why never ? 
  opposite . 
  almost ever . 
  but we used to . 
   short period while we have some rose hopes about it has ended . 
  the western world does not need an independent and strong russia . 
  may be , too scared ? 
  it is your right though . 
  no  just using the same common arguments . 
  if it looked this way - i have received my goal . 
  you know better , i 'm serious . 
   stop playing the victim . 
  that is it !, 
  we are the only who do not  too proud , may be . 
  everybody like to have a scapegoat to blame  and here we are - very handy for half of europe . 
   latvian rifleman regiment suppressed anti-soviet uprising in moscow . 
  dzerzhinsky was polac , stalin was georgian , kruschev ukranian . 
  and nobody is allowed to speak of a role in revolution of some unmentionable nation . 
  baltics are counting their people that were send to gulag as if they were send there for their nationality . 
  completely forgetting to compare the number of russians already there . 
  and nobody in east eur . 
  is remembering their own communists . 
   the latin alphabet is not well suited to slavic languages exactly . 
  ( or should use 4 letters instead of one , like in polish , 
  western ( and our opposition ) media makes a big fuss about it , but no . 
   russians suffered more and for longer time during communism ? 
  exactly . 
  but common opinon - to blame not communists , but russians . 
   and also refused to fight the russians , the americans or the british . 
  they declared the war to us and uk . 
  was bombed by allies . 
  but - true - did not declare the war to the ussr . 
  really ? 
  i bet that we had much more children suffering the same way . 
  and for much more time . 
  btw grand-grand dad of my wife was killed at plevna . 
  voluntereed . 
  we use their alphabet . 
   suffered from them in another when ? 
  good for you . 
  you mean , that you have not closed your ignalinos atomin\u0117 elektrin\u0117 , losing energy independence for joining eu ? 
  and similar ... 
  the difference ( from now ) is that with yeltsin russia really gave up . 
  russia was giving everything trying to be liked . 
  all in vain . 
  ( look at kozyrev , foreign minister of russia under yeltsin . 
  mister ` yes ' . 
  sold all for nothing , have not received anything . 
  now lives in miami - surprise ! ), 
  point me the russian hitler everybody here is so concerned . 
  yes . 
   second point is visible in the op . 
  billboards like that are forcing . 
  the thing is - i , living in moscow have a chance to see such poster and stuff - only here . 
  but majority in reddit sincerely think that they now better ( sure , due to the immaculate western media , 
  the question is - why everybody has the right to be himself . 
  french - being french , american - being american , and so on . 
  but russians ? 
  not for them . 
  never . 
  they owe everybody , as i can see here also . 
  yes . 
  he became named czar in 1947 . 
  and before that he was grand duke of grand duchy of moscow . 
  and would we say that just renaming means new state ? 
  we tried . 
  unfortunately . 
  during yeltsin . 
  thank you , no more . 
  it just became obvious - that never russia would be liked . 
  unless disappeared . 
  that is the point . 
  your opponent have lost two times - first , when after you have pointed him the sources - and he more then ignored them , second , when he insulted . 
  ps have you seen ` niekas nenor\u0117jo mirti ' with great donatas banionis ? 
   something nice about russia but such would be politically incorrect !, 
  thank god !, 
   nothing new just russia being russia damn right !, 
  and why russia should want to be not/less russian ? 
  yes !, 
  and no ukraine at all , 
  support for navalny hear is marginal . 
   does this battle even hold a prominent place in the russian psyche  no . 
  they have been forcing it for the past couple of years , no .
