  and another no  edit : believe me . 
  the majority ( people here that are not very interested in history ) does not remember this battle at all . 
  and nobody is forcing . 
  our . 
  let me remind you that novorossia never has been ukrainian in any way . 
  granted by bolsheviks to ukraine only in 1920 . 
  ukrainian statehood can be discussed within the borders of cossack hetmanate only . 
  they are not . 
  saving your people from such hate is . 
  it is so hard for somebody to be unbiased , 
  so you should agree that it 's logical for russia to reciprocate . 
   germany has no obligation to `` gift '' money to ukraine . 
  the same with russia . 
  hi there . 
  but i just do not care about this ukrainian stuff . 
  yes . 
  it 's \u0430 free country . 
  so we allow crazy freaks appear on tv . 
  man at pub . 
  hearing that somebody orders pint of harp : - are they out of guinness already ? 
  agreed . 
  and never 've caught with lies . 
  biased ? 
  sure , and have to be . 
  who is not ? 
  i 'm myself biased - i do not like to announce my own limitations . 
   and in return they got a whole bunch of gloating but no partnership or cooperation . 
  yep . 
  that is the feeling here . 
  russia with yeltsin was giving everything trying to be liked . 
  all in vain . 
  ( look at kozyrev , foreign minister of russia under yeltsin . 
  mister ` yes ' . 
  sold all for nothing , have not received anything . 
  now lives in miami - surprise ! ), 
   russia is the only country today in the world that has a national strategy ... to confront nato as an enemy surprise . 
  surprise !, 
  right . 
  and euronews is brilliant compared to bbc . 
  in the uzbekistan there was : - optimists are studying english - pessimists are studying arabic - realists are studying the ak47, 
  we have something of the kind . 
  russian speaking people who feel themselves ukrainian . 
  did they ? 
  you are ? 
  sad . 
   russia has to pick enemies that we try hard , but it looks as everybody is already threatened . 
  except china and africa . 
  too cold for them in siberia , 
  with the source code you can see , what is and can be updated . 
  in the ussr we had a joke . 
  how the china should conquer us ? 
  to declare the war and then to surrender !, 
  so probably nato exists, 
  ` zapad 2017 ' ** will be held sept 14-20 ** . 
  13 000 men expected to participate . 
  ` zapad 2013 ' had 10 000 . 
  though ` vostok 2014 ' exercise had more than 15 000 . 
  ** edit ** ` vostok 2014 ' totally involved more than 100 000 . 
  sure , not at the same ` battleground ' , but training this way or that . 
  compare to this one  major nato exercises in eastern europe have begun in bulgaria on tuesday involving 25,000 military personnel from more than 20 allied and partner countries as the u.s. seeks to reassure nato 's european allies . 
  the best at least from the 1917, 
  the difference is not so big as you imagine . 
  do you know tom lehrer ? 
  if not , you should look  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhhzf66c1dc, 
   climate change is the biggest threat to our species and the us president denies it exists . 
  do not think so . 
  denies that human influence has been the dominant cause . 
  bad news . 
  we should try harder . 
  yep . 
  and they owe us novorossia , 
  try google  https://translate.google.ru/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ru&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fde.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2f0-euro-schein&amp;edit-text=, 
  that 's the point . 
  kaspersky offered us officials the source code of his antivirus . 
  they are not interested . 
  but so far the russians have 81 % . 
  so we have no threat to became ` muslim ' in a rather long run . 
  ancient egyptians were not arabs . 
  same for the phoenicians ( later carthaginians ) . 
  but not europeans also . 
  this correlation is not so strong , though exists . 
  we have significant correlation - more children - in traditionally muslim regions . 
  sorry , - i ca n't google in latvian , so could not find if there is latvian text . 
  but try to googletranslate it into english . 
  it looks rather readable https://translate.google.ru/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ru&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.russkije.lv%2fru%2fpub%2fread%2frusskie-v-latvii-sbornik%2frus-v-latvii-1-fedotov.html&amp;edit-text= as for the tables there are the nations in this order - latvian - russian - belorussian - ukrainian - german - jewish - polish - lithuanian - estonian - others, 
  we had had a good example in rhodesia . 
  but then it became zimbabwe . 
   for a lot of companies , especially large ones , cost structure and market for all . 
  it 's capitalism . 
  look for ` supply and demand ', 
  well , in russia we have a very strong correlation . 
  well , in russia we have a very strong correlation . 
   brest is a pretty large city true . 
  but almost everybody has relatives in the smaller town , village or owns a vacation home ( sometimes just log ) with a piece of land . 
  have to compare this with the % of muslim population . 
  but this is a common rule - the poorer , the higher the birth rate ( for the same culture at least ) . 
  i 've found an interesting ( and neutral  study on the pre-soviet and soviet years . 
   `` swedish minority '' it 's the `` swedish speaking finns '' how do you distinguish them ? 
  i am serious . 
  2014 data .
