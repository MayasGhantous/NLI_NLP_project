there 's still no evidence of assad using chemical weapons and not rebels , so i guess the question is n't closed yet . 
  i 'm guessing bases in ukraine , abhazia , etc. 
  are n't foreign ? 
  it should be noted , that most of ukraine is fine . 
  maidan in kiev is the only unstable place . 
  it also should be noted , that maidan activists were beaten up when they came to harkov . 
  syria was n't allied with russia , until the usa had n't started funding terrorists in it . 
  so , you are admitting that the russian law about foreign agents is a good law , and everyone should have one ? 
  which is a nice conspiracy theory , and people on this reddit have explained before why it is bullshit . 
  gazprom nikaragua is called `` nigaz '' . 
  [ true story ] ( http://www.brandinfection.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/nigaz.png ) . 
  according to russian embassy in warsaw , borusevich has been forbidden entry into russia because of the sanctions . 
  in 2018 putin will most likely be elected president for his second consecutive term . 
  after that , in 2024 he ca n't run for presidency . 
  in 2030 he can , but he 'll be 77 . 
  i 'm sure putin will go for the next presidenship . 
  he ca n't , by law , go for the one afterwards , and he 'll be in his 70s for the one after that . 
  i kinda doubt he 'll want that burden when he is that old . 
  the most surprising thing for me is that people trust zuganov * and prohorov * more than they trust nemtsov . 
  in russia 45 % knew about him , but only 1 % was willing to vote for him, 
  apparently gitenev was n't killed in this tank . 
  according to chabanov , the man showing the passport , the tankmen were allowed to leave . 
  gitenev is currently being searched for by the red cross . 
  dead and imaginary ? 
  `` they '' - who ? 
  rostov region 's russia 24 branch ? 
  because that 's where this picture comes from . 
  [ eye of sadovnichiy ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/absurdopedia/images/6/62/msu.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20061125220937 ), 
  you are free to not believe him , but according to the video description it 's one guy ( evgeniy jurov ) and , occasionally , a writer . 
  he claims that he is doing it in his free time - hence the long ( up to three months ) gaps between the videos . 
  people here , on / r/europe claimed that they recongize some of the art assets being from counter strike . 
  most of the art are the edited photogrpahs - the channel has a tutorial on making that kind of editing . 
  i seriously envy this guy 's talent . 
  i 'm 100 % confident that / u/yuriydee was talking about the novaya gazeta 's publication . 
   biggest opposition figure [ a levanda poll from last year shows that only 45 % of russians even recognized nemtsov 's name ; of those 45 % , only 1 % `` trusted '' him -- compared to 17 % , who said they did not trust him . 
  why are you so surprised ? 
  [ mysterious snipers ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjhj6hks0jg&amp;feature=youtu.be ) have successfuly used sacrifices to fuel ukrainian , arab ( spring ) and many other rebellions . 
  we can go all the way back to the murder of franz ferdinand in saraevo . 
  killing people publically for political gain is not a new thing . 
  it did . 
  an undated document allegedly made by a group unrelated to the government , allegedly written between 4th and 17th of february, 
  you 'll have to wait . 
  it was three years ago , or something like that , so i 'll have to dig . 
  i know , right ? 
  kgb is just not the same nowadays . 
  no duh . 
  the question is - who ordered them . 
   according to the investigative committee 's official spokesperson , vladimir markin , all possible motives are being taken into account , though nemtsov 's political activities are not among the primary leads . 
  wait , what ? 
  today markin said that their [ main theories are ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2015/02/28/nemtsovcharlie/ ) : * islamist extremists . 
  nemtsov was getting death threats because of his opinion about charlie hebdo . 
  nemtsov 's death is being used for destabilization of political situation . 
  * nemtsov 's relation to ukraine . 
  nemtsov was getting money from there . 
  * nemtsov 's business . 
   also , charlie is n't in power neither are authors of the posters , though you can theoretize otherwise . 
   have n't you been following runet today ? 
  livejournal comment section is cancer , so i 'm not reading it . 
  actual popular bloggers did n't seem to be celebrating . 
   as for public vilification , i 'm talking about things like [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aayvnrb.jpg ) . 
  while i can talk about opposition using same shit to vilify the government , instead i 'm going to ask this question : is charlie hebdo [ vilifying ] ( https://sullydish.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/fillette.jpg ) le [ pen ] ( http://nordpresse.be/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/affiche-lepen.jpg ) ? 
  what does that say about french politics ? 
  also i think that top right picture is completely fair , and i ca n't read the small text on the top left picture to pass judgement . 
  the bottom ones are shit . 
  right . 
   they 're becoming outlaws , in the old sense of the word -- the law does n't protect them . 
  well , that 's just not true . 
  nemtsov 's murder is being investigated . 
  politkovskaya 's murder was investigated , and the criminals were found ( though , if you believe in the government conspiracy against her , then you do n't accept the results of the investigation ) . 
   this is what happens when you drive lumpen into violent frenzy , and give them a sense that their violence will be celebrated , not punished . 
  who is promoting and celebrating violence ? 
  united russia , medvedev and putin have declared their condolences to the nemtsov 's relatives . 
  who is celebrating violence ? 
   putin has built a system in which opposition figures are publicly vilified , harassed and hounded it 's arguable as to how much putin built that system , but opposition does n't shy from vilifying and harassing the current government . 
  in 2012 they were burning putin-strawman . 
  navalny 's black pr campaign was absolutely epic . 
   or not attacked poland in 1920 at all  if the ussr would n't had invaded poland in 1939 , then poland had actually pretty good chance against germany . 
  we can also discuss what would have happened if poland did n't attack the soviets in 1919 , but how is that helpful ? 
  ussr 's ally czechoslovakia is being invaded by the germans , and poland blocks all attempts by the soviet army to go and help the czechs . 
  now , poland is perfectly justified here , because the soviet army would probably stop in poland on the way back , but we all know how the decision to not let the ussr fight the nazis worked out for poland . 
  is that what they teach you in the ukraine ? 
  it will be supplied and trained by the us for years before ending in a stalemate ? 
   he was told many times that his son would die from hemophilia but rasputin found a way to bring him back every time . 
  the story of rasputin is actually quite mundane , and lacks most of the exciting details it got over the years . 
  tl ; dr : alexey romanov is sick with hemophilia . 
  the court doctors are trying to cure him using the latest , most fashionable method - reducing blood coagulation . 
  * for some reason that does n't work * . 
  rasputin and the royal family meet each other , and rasputin performs a miracle . 
  he kicks out the court doctors , which stops them from reducing blood coagulation of alexey who is sick with hemophilia . 
  * miraculously , that helps * . 
  rasputin moves to st. petersburg and gets an appartment as a reward . 
  then the story gets muddy . 
  according to the popular sources , rasputin has a large influence on the royal family , before being killed . 
  according to the memoirs of eye-witnesses , rasputin has no influence , and rarely appears in the palace . 
  then he is put on trial for heresy , and then he is mysteriously killed . 
  [ according to bbc he was killed by mi-6 ] ( http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/who-killed-rasputin/ ) , who feared his influence on the empress .
