  we know for a fact that ukraine has a troll army , so `` reddit name '' is not a valid identification . 
  the photo from outside is also not a conclusive proof , since it 's impossible to even verify that it 's the same house . 
  `` i 'm forced to eat russian steaks instead of australian one '' is like `` i 'm forced to eat salmon instead of royal lobster with caviar '' . 
  i understand your plight , but i ca n't really feel sorry for you . 
  there 's recently been a huge post in livejournal how living for a middle class man on the salary of 250k rubles is basically poverty . 
  for reference , average wage in russia is 30k rubles . 
  high-end middle class of moscow are strange people . 
  not really . 
  things like parmezan were a rarity to begin with , and now you can buy russian-made one . 
  and eating australian steaks over russian steaks ... well , can you say `` muscovites '' ? 
  in the south-western regions we eat beef . 
  not steaks , but we make goulash and cook beef . 
  it 's good in plov for example . 
  russian parmezan actually appeared in the stores , so that 's one of the pluses we got out of the sanctions . 
   if that 's true , then the baltics should cite the soviet constitution to prove they had the right to secede from the soviet union . 
  it 's not a question of baltics having the right to secede . 
  it 's the question of the state council of the ussr 's power to accept that secession . 
   to whom ? 
  there was no ukraine in 1954 , just the soviet union and its republics . 
  to ukrainian ssr . 
   i ca n't see why else they 'd want to be highlighting the similarity to crimea because a few weeks ago the legality of crimean transfer was questioned in the same way . 
  a highly relevant part of the interfax 's article uatoday chose to ignore :  `` legally , the decision to accept independence of baltic states is flawed , due to being accepted by a non-constitutional authority '' , - commented a member of the agency [ prosecution office ] on the deputy 's inquiry . 
   according to him , the answer to this inquiry `` will be the same as with crimea '' . 
  the agency 's source reminded that russian federation 's prosecution office already found illegal the decision to transfer crimea to ukraine in 1954 , however , according to him the decision does n't have any legal consequences . 
   `` rf 's prosecution office merely acknowledged the fact , that transfer of crimea to the ukraine in khrushchev 's times was unconstitutional , because the decision was made by a non-authorised government body '' . 
  the horror . 
  is it true that poles self-destruct when forced to agree with russians ? 
  that 's called propaganda . 
  it does n't have to actually be true . 
  the difference seems to be the distance from your border . 
  i mean , mujaheddin killed all the soviets and became a peaceful democratic nation , right ? 
   orthodox church [ according to a russian orthodox church 's sponsored website ] ( http://www.sedmitza.ru/text/5668549.html ) , the holy synod of helladic orthodox church with archbishop of athens sent a message asking eu to be calm and understanding in helping greece with its financial problems . 
  i could n't find any info on this in english . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.ytimg.com/vi/m7eat4gebii/hqdefault.jpg ) is the charlie hebdo calling everyone who votes for le pen shit . 
  literally . 
  please , tell me how this is a witty insightful satire that does n't exist to reinforce author 's political views . 
  yeah , that 's what political cartoons are . 
  should i post the charlie hebdo cover compilation and talk about horrible french propaganda ? 
  so you are saying that this is n't even your final form yet ? 
   but homosexuality is natural . 
  this is irrelevant to the public opinion . 
  `` in public opinion pluto is a planet '' and `` pluto is actually not a planet '' are both valid statements . 
  this is the problem with democracy - how do we count votes ? 
  should we forbid homosexual marriage in russia because the majority of russians are against it , or should we allow it because the majority of russian gays ( who are a minor part of russians ) are for it ? 
  should south ossetia be independent because the majority of south ossetians want to be independent , or should it be part of georgia because the majority of georgians ( who outweight ossetians by numbers ) do n't want it to be independent ? 
  the answer is always completely arbitrary . 
  i mean attacks . 
  it 's a joke , because nato is a defensive pact , but estonia constantly demands for nato to attack russia . 
  just to illustrate the point , here 's an article from 2009 : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/6480227/russia-simulates-nuclear-attack-on-poland.html, 
  scenario : nato finally listens to estonia and pre-emptively defends against russia . 
  in this case sending troops into baltics is something russia would do as a defensive move . 
  somehow i do n't see finland developing its own cpu . 
  or satelite navigation . 
  or delivering people and cargo into space . 
  good point . 
  i guess i never thought about \u0451 having an umlaut . 
   and he 's not even investing into the cash cow of energy ( in terms of r&d , development , and exploration ) . 
  you are hilarious , mate . 
  russia is getting all those deals to build nuclear reactors just becaus of our dashing looks . 
  ~ ~ there are no umlauts in russian ~ ~ there is only one umlaut in russian - '' \u0401 '' . 
  the story checks out in this case . 
  the lithuanian ambassador in ukraine said that lithuania is ready to be the first country to arm the ukraine . 
  the `` lithuanian tanks are already in the mailbox '' thing was a fever dream of ukrainian media . 
  god does n't need to participate in elections . 
  this is relevant to justification of `` invasion of crimea '' how ? 
  hurr durr dank meme [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9egg4ls7sw ), 
  of course . 
  tamerlane was looking for someone to teach his donkey to talk . 
  nobody wanted the job . 
  finally the wise men of the dunes - hodja nasreddin took the position and promised to teach the donkey to talk in 10 years time . 
  - are you crazy ? 
  his friends asked him . 
  - not really , hodja answered , the money is good the job is not hard and in 10 years a lot might happen : i might die , or tamerlane might die or surely enough this old donkey might die . 
   there 's no second class citizens . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-citizens_ ( latvia ), 
  except every time in the past 20 years crimea tried to have a referendum or use its own constitution ( it is an autonomous region ) , ukraine said lolno . 
  le sigh . 
  [ 91 % of crimeans think the referendum was free and fair ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/08/despite-concerns-about-governance-ukrainians-want-to-remain-one-country/ ) , and yet people still talk about voting over a barrel . 
  orignal [ tass ] ( http://tass.ru/politika/2063961 ) message . 
  dolgov is talking about lithuania openly using facist symbols and how the situation with human rights in europe is being overshadowed by ukrainian crisis . 
  he 's kind of right . 
  the whole thing with the second-class citizens in latvia is odd . 
   they have to show that they really care about russian-speaking populations everywhere so their invasion of crimea will `` make more sense '' and seem more justified . 
  russia 's justification for crimea is a democratic referendum . 
  there 's no need for any stronger justification . 
  ratnikov is a clown , and is yet another reason to hate yeltzin . 
  he claims that aliens saved the world from ww3 , and that us is using psychotropic weapons in pakistan . 
  title is editorialised and misleading . 
  the interview ratnikov gave is the source of the quote , not the ` actual ' mind reading results . 
  hmmmmm . 
  funny how just yesterday [ novaya gazeta ] ( http://www.novayagazeta.ru/columns/68930.html ) published an article claiming that albright 's statement is a product of kremlin trolls . 
  edit : and [ tv rain ] ( http://tvrain.ru/articles/mind_readers-389717/ ) , almost simultaneously ... 
   you have no idea how badly the average american would want to swat russia down like the insignificant gnat that they are and people are talking about hateful putin 's propaganda . 
  * \u0401\u043b\u043a\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0438 yeah , okroshka with kefir or whey are very common ( and delicious ) . 
  when did you stop beating your wife ? 
   georgia you mean when georgia was the aggressor ? 
  the fact recognized by the eu ? 
  yeah , that 's quite an example of russian thirst for blood . 
  because reading the article is too hard , despite the headlines always lying . 
  good thing russia is not the second kind then .
