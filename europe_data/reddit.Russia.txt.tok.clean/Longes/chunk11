   speaking good about the us , ukraine or opposition , talking trash about great vladimir speaking about politics and religion with anyone but close friends is a terrible idea in general , no matter the country . 
  in the list of * 2015 * . 
  the whole thing is * really * strange and makes me scratch my head . 
  [ here 's the explanation of the scores ] ( http://library.fundforpeace.org/library/cfsir1418-castmanual2014-english-03a.pdf ) . 
  russia has 9.3 in group grievance . 
  this is :  group grievance is extremely deep and generates systematic acts of violent retribution combined with frequent spontaneous outbursts of group-based violence us has 5.0 :  group grievances are present but are receding or being addressed on a tentative basis and yet russia does n't have a real equialent to [ ferguson riots ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferguson_unrest ), 
  what are you talking about ? 
  look , i understand what you are saying . 
  but what i 'm saying is that rulings of echr were ignored before and that `` how much should we respect the echr 's rulings '' is a legitimate question that bothers politicians in many countries . 
  [ relevant article ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/03/conservatives-ignore-european-court-human-rights-rulings ), 
   countries that do not comply lose good-will from other countries to cooperate and work together . 
  poor uk , italy and turkey are all alone in this cold distrustful world . 
  i weep for them . 
   russia is going to be fine as a result of isolating itself from the whole world . 
  muh isolation : * http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/06/19/uk-saudi-russia-nuclear-idukkbn0oz10r20150619 * http://rt.com/business/268279-russia-greece-turkish-stream/ * http://www.ibtimes.com/russia-builds-space-program-saudi-arabia-iran-amid-roscosmos-struggles-1969236 * http://www.firstpost.com/world/russia-to-help-india-set-up-high-speed-railway-projects-2301564.html * ... 
   if a russian can read the guardian it 's very likely your views already have much in common not necessarily . 
  ability to read foreign media led me to believe that i ca n't fully trust any single media source and that every article needs to be carefully combed because headlines are full of shit too often, 
  grumble , grumble . 
  the `` guidelines '' thing was a joke . 
  in regards to the document you quoted , the big question is : or what ? 
  the only real way a country can be punished for ignoring echr 's rulings is the expulsion of the country from the council of europe . 
  which had n't happened before when other countries ignored echr 's rulings . 
  it * can * happen , but it had n't yet . 
  i 've presented some examples of countries ignoring echr in the other thread here . 
  the reaction to her death was pretty disgusting . 
  ** foreign affairs ** * saudi arabia , russia sign nuclear power cooperation deal . 
  [ reuters ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/06/19/uk-saudi-russia-nuclear-idukkbn0oz10r20150619 ) * russia , greece sign $ 2bn deal on turkish stream gas pipeline . 
  [ rt ] ( http://rt.com/business/268279-russia-greece-turkish-stream/ ), 
  the main theory that floats in the russian blogosphere is that the arrest was done as an intimidation move before the [ st. petersburg economic forum ] ( http://www.forumspb.com/ ) . 
  with the forum being over , the accounts were quickly unblocked to avoid escalation .

  it gets much less impressive when you notice that the last three columns are made of [ 1 hrivna ] ( http://fmimg.finmarket.ru/banknotes/980/980_k_1_a.jpg ) banknotes . 
  they are more like `` guidelines '' than actual rules . 
  that being said , recognizing decisions of echr below the laws of the country and decisions of internal courts is nothing new on the world arena . 
   after moscow vowed retaliation . 
  nice editorialization here . 
  alternatively , for russians it will mean another thing - thugish intimidation does n't work and europeans had to back off . 
  it 's not like pumping the state full of american weapons ever worked either . 
  when they did it to afghanistan we got al-qaeda . 
  when they did it to the middle east we got many things including isis . 
  yet another proof that yurop is the us puppet , amirite ? 
  bulgaria has a hand very far up its ass , while for greece things ca n't go much worse than they already are . 
  i 'm sorry , i got confused . 
  southern stream . 
  this has more to do with the changed economic zones and less with the car quality . 
  lada kalina is allegedly pretty decent . 
  but obviously it 's easier to buy a car from another eu member in latvia than to buy it from russia . 
  [ \u263a ] ( http://www.religiousfreedomcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/putinsmile.jpg ), 
  ukraine pipelines were going to be ` swapped ' with the ~ ~ northern ~ ~ southern stream anyway , since ukraine had a nasty tendency to steal gas . 
  not always . 
  look at ukraine : march : we wo n't give money unless you deal with your debts . 
  june : we 'll give you the money , just reclassify your debt to russia as a `` personal '' debt . 
  good , good ... 
  imf is less of a bank and more of a mafia loanshark that tells you exactly what color and size toilet you should buy with the money you took . 
  fun fact : european court of human rights actually has not authority to enforce its rulings . 
  they are implemented on a case by case basis by the members of the council of europe , and have been ignored in the past by uk , italy , and some other countries . 
  media attacks and misrepresents your country ? 
  oh man , i feel so sorry for you . 
  i 'd like to remind you that transnistria secceded because popular front won the parliamentary elections and wanted to do the ethnic cleansing of moldova . 
   putin said no to cyprus [ did n't russia restructure cyprus ' debt recently ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/26/us-russia-cyprus-military-iduskbn0lu1ew20150226 ) ? 
  whataboutism !, 
  free for all !, 
  and let no one leave empty handed !, 
  that 's kind of his point - that the excuse for americans aresting fifa people is incredibly flimsy . 
  the headline is a lie . 
  is that the joke ? 
  bloody hell , will ~ ~ the western propaganda machine ~ ~ you people stop ? 
  not `` investigate the apollo missions '' . 
  investigate the disappearance of materials from nasa . 
  here 's a direct quote :  `` no , we are not saying they never flew up there and just filmed a movie instead . 
  but all these scientific , or perhaps even cultural artifacts are part of an international human heritage , and their disappearance is a great loss for all of us . 
  an investigation would reveal [ what happened and where they are ] . '', 
  what exactly do you dislike in this article ? 
  what medusa wrote :  russia 's federal investigative committee representative vladimir markin called for an international investigation into the moon landing . 
  what markin said :  `` no , we are not saying they never flew up there and just filmed a movie instead . 
  but all these scientific , or perhaps even cultural artifacts are part of an international human heritage , and their disappearance is a great loss for all of us . 
   so the initative of our american colleagues , even if it is legally ridiculous , can find a reasonable continuation in form of a wave of international democratic investigations . 
  and maybe then the american ambassadors will stop dictating to presidents and the pope what they should do with russia . 
  it 's not a threat . 
  it 's a `` hypocrites '' cry and mild trolling . 
  it 's a fragment of the show set by night wolves in sevastopol last year . 
  an interpretive dance representation of events in the ukraine . 
  welcome to russia , enjoy your stay . 
  we 've had this since the last year for blogs :p, 
  yeltzin pretty much single-handedly destroyed everything that was left from the soviet union . 
  our sovietophilles usually reminisce about 50s-70s . 
  no really . 
  russia as a state is in no danger of being bankrupt in the close future . 
  russia 's foreign debt is ridiculously small . 
  now , russian corporations on the other hand ... 
   message to the baltics ? 
  probably not . 
  the only possible effect of this investigation is that the living members of the council ( are there any ? ), 
  will be judged and given a prison sentence for treason . 
  there 's literally nothing else that can come out of it . 
  it 's not like baltic states will go `` well , you 've got us , it was illegal , i guess we 'd better declare ourselves socialist republics again . '', 
  even for internal audience this is ridiculously weak . 
  no one really cares about the legitimacy of state concil of ussr - ussr does n't exist anymore and members of the council are no longer in the politics . 
  my guess is - this is aimed at the electorate of these deputies to show that they are doing something . 
  it 's a joke , watch the video .
