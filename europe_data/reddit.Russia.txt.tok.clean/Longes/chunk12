  have you tried to [ kill the poor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owi7doeo_yg ) ? 
  [ dalia 's father was in nkvd ] ( http://www.ekspertai.eu/ekspertai-eu-turimi-dokumentai-rodokad-prezidentes-tevelis-polikarpas-grybauskas-tarnavo-nkvd/ ) , but i 've never heard of dalia herself being in kgb . 
  but he was n't openly presenting an opinion - he was being paid to lie . 
  but muh western free press ... 
   there 's a lot of people i know in russia -- prominent business people skipping the fact that people mcfaul is friends with are very likely to be hardcore anti-putin group . 
  *** rich people do n't like when their wealth is threatened *** . 
  in other news : birds still shit . 
  is evidence of bbc [ cutting and manipulating the information ] ( https://tompride.wordpress.com/2014/09/11/bbc-reporter-caught-red-handed-manipulating-video-in-scottish-indy-campaign/ ) good enough ? 
  the poster is literally bringing up the us in his post . 
  stop smoking . 
   operator error it 's not a one-time pad if you use it twice , amirite ? 
  the rest are not weaknesses - just qualities of one-time pads . 
  they are inconvenient enough to be used in a daily life , but simple enough to achieve to be used in certain military situations . 
  does this mean that us under bush was all about tyranny ? 
  that question has been solved 66 years ago . 
  the encryption can be unbreakable , if it 's a one-time pad . 
  otherwise it is always breakable . 
  poland 's dependence on coal is the result of poland avoiding dependence on russian gas . 
  what does this have to do with communism ? 
   i expected you to reply with `` 1984 '' ca n't imagine why . 
  ramenskoe chose to celebrate their city day and russia day like that - good for them . 
  i think it 's kind of dumb , but it 's not like they are doing anything bad . 
  ramenskoe is not a moscow suburb - it 's a city in the moscow region , center of ramenskiy district of moscow region . 
   found deep within ukrainian territory , beyond even the current rebel lines , heading for transnistria neither of which is a fucking nato member . 
  fuck , what you suggest is so crazy that it needs a huge special explanation . 
  the real world that the rest of us live in has major powers with nuclear weapons pointed at each other that are capable of destroying all human civilization on the earth . 
  all out war is not * unthinkable * only in the sense that we are physically capable of thinking about it , having grown up and spent our entire lives living under the shadow of this terrible truth . 
  all out war is , however , * extremely undesirable * . 
  because of the whole thing of blotting out the sun with the ashes of the dead . 
  people are n't really keen on going there . 
  so what happens is that the major powers draw extremely clear lines in the sand that would cause them to rain nuclear hellfire on each other , and because the lines are clear , they are not crossed . 
  and then new generations can be born , live , and die under the shadow of the atom without being vaporized and left as shadows on the walls . 
  the thing where estonia and georgia and you want nato to throw its weight around and threaten military intervention against great powers that have very specifically not crossed the line is insane . 
  that is the worst thing you could possibly do . 
  it undermines world peace in a way that was n't even possible for the majority of human history . 
   have nato bomb them you , sir , are the most insane and evil person in this thread . 
  nato is a defensive alliance , which does n't include ukraine or moldova . 
  and yet you want this defensive alliance to start a nuclear war . 
  oh my , is that a whataboutism i smell ?!, 
  so if you play the democracy card , then you recognize crimean referendum as legit , hm ? 
  facepalm.jpg again , for the slowest kids , i 'll try to explain . 
  ussr did n't have an [ official language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/official_language ) . 
  at all . 
  there was no such thing as an official language of the soviet union . 
  individual republics * did have * their own official languages . 
  ukrainian ssr had ukrainian as an official language . 
  the official language of lithuanian ssr was _ lithuanian _ . 
  not russian . 
  lithuanian . 
  do you know the difference between `` official language '' and `` language everyone uses '' ? 
   so that is how you get all the perks , but none of the liabilities of being a successor state . 
  i take it you do n't count taking the debts as `` liabilities '', 
  forced meme is forced . 
   what was the official language in all of the states up until 1990 ussr did n't have an official language . 
  removal of official language [ was one of the points ] ( https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/ru:\u041d\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d_\u043b\u0438_\u043e\u0431\u044f\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439_\u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439_\u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a%3f_ ( \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d ) ) of lenin 's political agenda . 
  it just is . 
  according to a recent poll only 4 % know what is actually being celebrated . 
   even these cities , apart from cultural sights and business areas , have low standards of living and crappy infrastructure . 
  have you been to russia ? 
  because i currently live in germany , and german public transportation sucks . 
  standards of living are pretty close overall . 
  it 's actually called `` day of russia '' and is obscure as hell . 
  still a state holiday though . 
  the holiday is so obscure that ( according to the recent poll ) only 4 % of russians can name the day . 
   thats sounds wired to me that 's because the common impression of ussr as `` russian empire 2.0 '' is misguided . 
  which still has nothing to do with `` god gave me perfect judgement '', 
  you can start with [ this ] ( https://wikileaks.org/wiki/corruption_in_norway,_ghana_or_both%3f_statoil_v._biofuel_and_the_kroll_inc._private_intelligence_report,_feb_2009 ) . 
  the most famous corruption case of statoil is probably when they bribed iranian officials , which you can easily find yourself . 
   norway is trustworthy except for all the times norwegian oil companies bribed government officials to secure the deals . 
  estonians think a lot about evil russians conquering them , but the reverse is not true . 
  it 's not a quote actually . 
  [ here 's the original interview ] ( http://www.corriere.it/english/15_giugno_07/vladimir-putin-interview-to-the-italian-newspaper-corriere-sera-44c5a66c-0d12-11e5-8612-1eda5b996824.shtml ) . 
  as you can see , `` god gave me perfect judgement '' is not a direct qoute - it 's a headline mashable made up . 
  and it refers to putin saying `` i regret nothing in my life '' . 
  good job , western propaganda . 
  well , last time us deployed missiles we had a cuban missile crisis, 
   still in negotiations with france after ... 2 years ? 
  one year . 
  first mention of delays was from last september . 
   why not negotiate with ukraine ? 
  `` officials pledge to sue '' is pretty much a meaningless buzzing . 
  of course they are going to negotiate . 
  `` we 'll sue you '' is just the first thing you say after the other side breaks the contract . 
   france refuses to hand over the ships ... . nothing . 
  the negotiations are still in the process . 
  it 's not like suying france is an instantaneous thing . 
  it sure as hell taps their phones :p, 
  lots of photos inside . 
  [ second part of the set ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ru&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fsdelanounas.ru%2fblogs%2f63479%2f&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  stop putting words in my mouth . 
  saakashvilli is currently working for poroshenko , he 's not a mastermind of anything . 
  saakashvilli 's previous record includes ( and ends with ) provocations in south osetia and a failed attack on russian peacekeepers . 
  saakashvilli 's assignment as a governor of odessa , a region bordering with transnistria , simultaneously with ukraine stopping the military cooperation agreements with russia , simultaneously with poroshenko saying that he 'll help moldova become a single country again raises eyebrows . 
   like russian state propaganda says like a single opinion piece in a single newspaper says . 
   til president of ukraine and romania is saakashvilli . 
  great strawman !, 
  saakashvilli is the governor of odessa . 
  i 'm also saying that the government that was said to have possibly been involved in 9/11 found no evidence of 9/11 being an inside job . 
  clarification : i 'm not saying 9/11 was an inside job , i 'm just making the comparison . 
   that is a legitimate question , by the way .
