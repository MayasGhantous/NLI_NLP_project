  no , it 's not . 
  there is documental proof that capitulation would not be accepted , and that the population of leningrad would be exterminated . 
  the evacuation of leningrad was impossible . 
  it 's an offensive question and it 's a stupid question . 
  [ and dojd apologized for it ] ( https://twitter.com/vorewig/status/427483442625142784 ) . 
  [ citation needed ] . 
  his lawyer claimed that it was [ thallium poisoning ] ( http://echo.msk.ru/programs/exit/55971/ ) , which is not radioactive . 
  the results of the expertise are not classified , and at the very least [ were available to novaya gazeta ] ( http://2004.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2004/46n/n46n-s05.shtml ) . 
  in 2008 the case [ was reopened ] ( http://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/29713.html ) , but was closed again as no crime was found .

  define `` freedom of the press '' . 
  russian press is free to write whatever the hell they want , they are not being censored . 
  of course , writing whatever the hell you want is not a recipe for success , as dojd has demonstrated . 
  when you write things that are stupid and offensive , people stand against you ( i 'm refering to the `` should ussr have given leningrad to the nazis to save lives '' debacle that started dojd 's downfall ) . 
  but slon.ru , novaya gazeta and echo moskvi are doing fine . 
  the reason so many journalists of novaya gazeta got killed is because they are picking a fight with the chechen government . 
  the government of chechnya is corrupt . 
  the government of chechnya is vile . 
  but picking a fight with it is insane , and the best you can expect is that your murderer will be found . 
   yury shchekochikhin there is no proof that it was murder , rather than death from natural causes . 
  with chechnya in particular , the problem is that it 's a volatile territory that is barely under control and is full of terrorists in the mountains . 
  there is little that can be done about government of chechnya without the whole thing exploding into third chechen war . 
  are all us allies on the obama 's payroll ? 
   georgia you wot mate ? 
  [ georgia attacked russian peacekeepers ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8281990.stm ) in south osetia , not the other way around . 
  based on saakashvilli 's past behavior , sounds like ukraine is preparing something there . 
  they know the main thing - putin fell victim to one of the classic blunders - `` never go in against a sicilian when death is on the line '' !, 
   demonstration of the seismic shifts in the world energy landscape emanating from america 's shale fields . 
  this seems weird to me . 
  did n't rig count fell to the lowest since 2010 , mostly due to shale rigs being closed ? 
  uk entered war after germany sunk [ ss athenia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ss_athenia ) . 
  but i 'll give you that , uk and france did have a military pact with poland and they decided to honor it . 
   at that time the soviet union was co-operating with germany to divide up eastern europe . 
  i know that bashing ussr is fashionable right now , but at that time uk and france cooperated with germany to solve the `` czechoslovakian problem '' ( direct quote from chamberlain ) . 
  czechoslovakian industry and arsenal were a major factor in the following growth of germany . 
  and at the same time us was selling massive quantities of oil to germany and financed nationalist movement which led hitler to power . 
   `` they asked me why i did n't have any children , '' she remembers . 
  `` they asked me if i was married . '' beneath their line of questioning was the suggestion that somehow the attack was her fault . 
  i love how guardian skips the part where she says that `` he ( officer ) was polite , and told me that i 'm brave for reporting , and that bastards should be punished . '', 
  that 's hardly the biggest problem with ttip . 
   meanwhile the established story line of history is very much that ze evil german attempted world domination and had to be stopped . 
  well , that 's not the full truth , is it ? 
  the attack on czechoslovakia was discussed and allowed by the ` good guys ' in [ munich betrayal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/munich_agreement ) . 
  ww2 did n't happen because of evil . 
  it happened because realpolitik went horribly ~ ~ right ~ ~ wrong . 
  the wonderful powers of propaganda and white/black mentality . 
  le sigh . 
  interestingly enough , my grandgrandpa who fought in ww2 and was a commandant of a small city in germany , had a great respect for hitler for what he did for the country . 
   speaking of which , the lesson much of the world learned from ww2 is `` sometimes it is necessary to go to war with really evil nations '' . 
  that 's naive . 
  the allies did n't fight the axis because nazism is evil . 
  they fought the axis because axis was bombing uk , invading ussr , and blowing up us ships . 
  according to the clarification lnr published , naming crimea as ( not ) part of ukraine is outside of their competence . 
  your post implies that russia attacked peaceful innocent georgia under the guise of defending south ossetians . 
  [ got away with winning a war _ georgia started _ ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8281990.stm ) ? 
  are you high ? 
   usa did n't even have any economic power over europe or asia . 
  that 's ... complicated . 
  over europe usa has military power via its omnipresent bases and economic power via oil dollar . 
  and is trying to get more power by pushing ttip . 
  over asia usa has economic power via oil dollar and its muppets ( like japan and south korea ) . 
  you mean when georgia was the agressor and even osce reported that ? 
   in fact that 's true , russia nationalised over 250 private companies in crimea as of february as well as all of those owned by ukrainian state . 
  most of those belonged to kolomoyskiy , so i ca n't feel bad about them . 
  this is literaly a quote from the article , fuck off . 
  no , because i do n't feel like trailing through pages of history to find the crimea discussions . 
   fifa said investigations into such claims were ongoing and , as yet , there was no evidence of wrongdoing . 
  what are we discussing again ? 
  well , / u/rogerhollis 's flair says `` ira did nothing wrong '' . 
  car bomb . 
  but reddit told me that russia is pillaging in crimea . 
  hmmmmmmmm . 
  i seem to remember this niche group called `` right sector '' . 
  you probably never heard of it . 
  those who do n't are yet to present any political program that does n't start and end with `` remove putin '' . 
  i love how this is right next to the message about the election fraud in turkey . 
   scala admits he has not seen evidence of corruption . 
  but you have to agree that `` no evidence of world cup corruption found '' is a worse headline than `` russia & qatar may lose world cups '', 
  and so the propaganda attack begins . 
  all three of those things are `` in case of russian invasion '' . 
   does n't matter if nato or anybody is actually `` afraid '' or not of course it does matter . 
  if nato is afraid of russia invading , then saying `` nato is afraid of russia '' invading is not patronising . 
  and if nato is n't afraid of russia invading , then why does the us promise to install those new military bases in europe and screams how eu is n't spending enough on military ? 
  what 's that all about ? 
  you are right . 
  the information about the march being 30 minutes long comes from [ meduza ] ( https://meduza.io/galleries/2015/06/06/marsh-dlinoy-v-polchasa ) , which references reuters . 
  i have never understood how some people feel they need a parade to show where they stick their genitals . 
  the big question is : is this support , or is this a token gesture for the eu ? 
  the evidence points to the latter , as the parade members were asked to disperse after they walked for 500m . 
  so then you agree that two out of three points in the bellingcat analysis are wrong and we no longer need to discuss them , we can just focus on the `` reference analysis '' part of the bellingcat report ? 
  i never understand why people need a parade to celebrate where they stick their dicks . 
   ok , so the dutch report is finished ? 
  or at least partly finished ? 
   how did they get the proof ? 
  it 's an expert analysis based on the preliminary report of the official investigators . 
   why did n't they release this from the beginning presumably almaz-antey released their analysis as soon as they finished it . 
  so you think it was a su then ? 
   youtube profile with 1 video upload rocket manufacturers do n't have a great need for youtube videos . 
  i do n't see what this quote have to do with anything . 
  tl ; dr : it was buk m1 , it was a rocket 9\u041c38\u041c1 , the launch was made from zaroshenskoe .
