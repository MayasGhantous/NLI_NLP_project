  while i agree that the drought was the primary reason , people resisting collectivisation to the point of burning the fields and killing their own cattle added to the problem . 
   b ) the main reason for the hunger was bad harvest caused by drought . 
  well , let 's be fair here . 
  the complete clusterfuck of transition to collectivisation was just as important . 
  do n't add any quotation marks . 
  it 's better this way . 
  in russian '' \u0431\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043d '' means a specific type of white bread , something like a french baguette . 
  [ this is not ] ( http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6005/89437319.1e/0_8b753_f3259e1_xl.jpg ), 
  two dozen fully clothed people , some of them holding a piece of paper or a flag . 
  do you expect them to wear niqab to be kosher to you ? 
  judging by the [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fij-gf7pk0s ) , there are three pro-gay people and everyone else is anti-gay . 
  so , looking at the video , there are about 3 gays . 
  presumably the other 17 are anti-gays . 
  oh , the horrible repression . 
  ussr was the first country to reach moon 's surface with its luna-2 ship , and photograph the dark side of the moon with luna-3 . 
  sadly , comrade jebediah failed to return , so neil armstrong became the first man to stand on the surface ~ ~ and come back ~ ~ . 
  i think the author just uses some very large period as a `` stalingrad battle '' . 
  he does mention the smaller number , but then goes `` in total blah blah '', 
  right . 
  the barrier troops were allowed the use of weapons as needed . 
  each armed division must have its own barrier troop no larger than a batallion in numbers . 
  the barrier troops report to the division 's commander , and must be equiped with the transportation . 
  the job of the barrier troops is helping the commanding officers in keeping discipline and stopping panicking soldiers , using weapons if needed , supporting the honest soldiers . 
  political officers should be working together with the commanders and barrier troops . 
  create barrier troops within five days from recieving the order . 
  report about the execution . 
  but barrier troops were n't just machine gunning everyone who retreats , and there 's plenty of documental and statistical evidence to support this . 
  depends on the determined reason for soldier being captured away from the battle . 
  rare few were executed by firing squad . 
  most got sent back to their division or to the penal unit . 
  edit : from 1 august 1942 to 15 october 1942 there is this statistic : 140.755 soldiers were caught by the barrier troops . 
  3980 were arrested , 1189 were executed , 2961 were sent to the penal units , 131.094 were sent back to their units . 
  hm , okay , you are correct . 
  russian wiki says that according to soviet data german army lost more that 900000 people , and gives a reference to some 2002 history book ( which i 'm currently loading ) that sets axis total losses at 1.5 mil . 
  edit : 1.5 mil including wounded and pows , according to the book . 
   the soviets even machine gunned anyone who retreated . 
  that 's a myth . 
  barrier troops existed , and you can read about them in detail ( in russian ) [ here ] ( http://militera.lib.ru/research/pyhalov_i/13.html ) . 
  but they were n't machine gunning anyone who retreats . 
  the majority of people caught by barrier troops were judged by the military court and given one punishment or the other . 
  in 1944 the barrier troops were dismissed at all , because red army began the offensive . 
   when they came across minefields and the like they just sent men through it calculating the losses like you would if there was an artillery barrage or battle . 
  this is questionable , but may be true . 
  the only source is eisenhower , to whom zhukov allegedly explained this tactic . 
  huh . 
  i thought ( and wikipedia supports me ) that germans lost more people at stalingrad than the red army did . 
  no , therre is n't . 
  russian mainstream opposition is insane , and has no idea how to get people on their side . 
  read these quotes from our mainstream opposition , and tell me if you 'd vote for them . 
  `` i have no illusions about russian language . 
  honestly , i think that cyrillic alphabet is a national disaster , and read more books in english than in russian '' - yulia latinina `` in russia everything spreads around and hangs like pasta from the spoon . 
  1/6th of the earth has been inhabited by spineless protoplasm '' - valeria novodvorskaya `` two thirds ( of russians ) are latent xenophobes , latent criminals '' - roman dobrohotov `` we should stop hypocritical preaching about the veterans ' feelings , which are hurt by attacks on soviet regime . 
  evil must be punished . 
  scorn of decendants - the least that builders and defenders of the soviet regime deserve . '', 
  - alexander podrabinek `` putin 's electorate are lumpens and putin 's electorate are bydlo '' - yulia latinina `` there were 2 demonstrations , of free people and of anchovi . 
  and i must say that kremlin 's strategy won - there were more anchovi . 
  there are more anchovi in russia than free people . '', 
  - yulia latinina `` shoigu put the first stone into the new pet cemetary . '', 
  - olga romanova , about the opening of federal military cemetary `` russian nation is a cancer on humanity . '', 
  - valeriya novodvorskaya `` do n't think - distribute . 
  let them answer . '', 
  - alexey navalny , about information on his blog `` so , we need proper sociological data to plan our political and anticorruption activity . 
  we want to know what people in small cities think , and what we should say to them , so they take the pitchforks and siege the `` united russia '' office . 
  what people in big cities think , and what they should be thinking to start burning tires on the streets ? '', 
  - alexey navalny `` first 1917 , then 1937 . 
  two destructions of the elites led to russia becoming a country of genetic garbage . 
  i 'd ban this country . '', 
  what happened to `` russian elections are corrupt '' and `` statistics showing overwhelming support of putin are a sham '' ? 
  you do realise that russia is not the only country with secret blacklists ? 
  ever heard of the us ? 
  why ? 
  average salary in moscow is about 690 , so it 's quite a large salary . 
  i hope we 'll have less faked moments , like [ this ] ( http://www.pulp-and-fiber.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sochi-toilets_2812481b.jpg ) infamous picture . 
  not everything that happens in russia is tied to putin . 
  / u/rinnve means kara-murza is n't dead yet . 
  he 's just in hospital with kindey failure . 
  stop . 
  you give maxim staviski as an example . 
  maxim staviski was in a car crash in 2008 in bulgaria . 
  is 2008 bulgaria a communist country ? 
  so when rt presents a recording - it 's a falsification ? 
  sure .

  [ reuters . 
  ] ( http://rt.com/news/245141-reuters-witness-misreport-mh17/ ), 
  i 've seen new york times falsify the information , i 've seen bbc falsify the information , i 've seen reuters falsify the information . 
  i have no reason to trust any of them . 
  ludmila shavenkova used to be head of irkutsk regional election committee . 
  after the crash she left the position and is currently working as a consultant for the united russia . 
  i do n't see how either position immediately implies `` ties with putin '' . 
   one of the most blatant examples - maxim staviski an ice skating champion and at the time face of a do n't drink and drive campaighn was caught by the police recklessly speedin and under the influence and let off with just a verbal warning .
