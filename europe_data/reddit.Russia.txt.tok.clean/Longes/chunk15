  just a few km-s down the road he caused a major accident , killing a young boy and leaving a girl in a vegitative state . 
  he 's yet to face any concequices . 
  bulgaria is a communist country ? 
  it is an amnesty in honor of 70th day of victory over the nazi germany . 
  the amnesty extends to everyone who commited a non-intentional crime ( like a car accident ) and was sentenced for no more than 5 years . 
  this article is amazing . 
  we can start with the title :  russian official 's daughter with ties to putin spared jail due to nazi amnesty `` with ties to putin '' here means that ludmila shavenkova is a consultant of united russia in [ irkutsk ] ( https://www.google.de/maps/place/%d0%98%d1%80%d0%ba%d1%83%d1%82%d1%81%d0%ba,+%d0%98%d1%80%d0%ba%d1%83%d1%82%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%8f+%d0%be%d0%b1%d0%bb%d0%b0%d1%81%d1%82%d1%8c,+%d0%a0%d0%be%d1%81%d1%81%d0%b8%d1%8f/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x5da83ad353e2f665:0x31d6cd1456d8e94e?sa=x&amp;ei=3-xmvcqhfyt2uouxgyah&amp;ved=0cikbepibma4 ) . 
  `` nazi amnesty '' is an amnesty in honor of 70th day of victory over the nazi germany . 
  the amnesty extends to everyone who commited a non-intentional crime ( like a car accident ) and was sentenced for no more than 5 years . 
  it 's not on case by case basis - you either fit the criteria and go free , or you do n't . 
  now , the process over shavenkova was almost certainly corrupt . 
  she got an unusually large delay before she 'll have to go to the colony . 
  but blaming every single thing that happens in russia personally on putin is just insane . 
  but ludmila shavenkova is not a high ranking member . 
  she 's a consultant in irkutsk . 
   a news source has to stand on it 's own . 
  you have to trust it . 
  this is insane . 
  memes are hard you guys !, 
  but muh corrupt totalitarian regime !, 
   communism  slaves what does this even have to do with anything ? 
  that 's not really true . 
  germans trust merkel . 
  russians trust putin . 
  americans used to trust obama at the start . 
  some leaders are more successful and popular , some are less . 
   you need to understand the country 's `` general direction '' in order to answer that , as well as have some criteria by which it may be compared with other possible directions . 
  you can quite easily rephrase the question as `` were changes in the last few years positive ? 
  do you want them to continue ? 
  y/n '' . 
  you are reading it wrong . 
  the question is `` who should be responsible for x : national government , local government or private sector '' . 
  do you really want your healthcare to be privatised ? 
   the girl looks super depressed and can hardly walk in the wedding video . 
  she does n't * always * look depressed . 
  [ here you can see her smiling on camera ] ( http://lifenews.ru/news/154008 ) ( starts at about 00:55 ) . 
  of course , the entire thing is qutie fishy , and astahov 's position is disgusting . 
  but there is nothing anyone can do about the marriage . 
  chechnya is still a hot spot with terrorists in it , and having another chechen war is not something russia can afford :(, 
   was that event the direct context for the making of the law ? 
  that particular event ? 
  usaid has been banned in russia since 2012 . 
  the campaign forcing foreign funded ngos to be clean and open has been slowly moving since then . 
   considering that they 're building an imitation of the ussr [ citation needed ], 
  the problem is that separating ` good ' ngos from ` bad ' ngos is basically impossible . 
  [ us was brewing revolution under the guise of something as innocent as hiv aid ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/usaid-latin-americans-cuba-rebellion-hiv-workshops ) . 
  finding the truth for heavily politicised topics like human rights is even harder . 
  people seriously need to learn what `` whataboutism '' is , before they start screaming . 
  i 'll give you a hint : presenting the reason why a certain law was passed is not whataboutism . 
  i call it political cowardice because it 's the lazy option . 
  it 's the `` i do n't like those people , find better ones for me '' option . 
  russia is a democratic country , you do n't need a noble bloodline to be a politician . 
  you do n't like people on the voting ballot - go and participate in the elections as a candidate . 
  or find someone you like and help them be a candidate . 
  `` i do n't like the mayoral/regional/presidential candidates , but i do n't want to do anything to create a candidate i like '' is a weak choice . 
  edit : though i suppose `` political cowardice '' is the wrong choice of words . 
  political immaturity would be better . 
  we used to have `` none of the above '' field , but it was removed a few years ago . 
  i agree with the decision . 
  `` none of the above '' is a political cowardice . 
  things like that are sadly common on regional elections :(, 
  yes . 
  you need to register as an observer in advance , but anyone can do that . 
  that 's a ballot from the presidential election 2012 . 
  names are in the left column , their birth year , city where they live and their current political involvement and party membership are in the middle column . 
  those frenchmen need to keep their cocks under control . 
  seems secure . 
  one can not simply tear the duct tape . 
   russia has 11 of these . 
  wrong . 
  * russian army * has 11 of these . 
  they are not prisoners of war if they are russian soldiers , because ukraine is not at war with russia . 
  critizing ? 
  more like lying about it . 
   and all this with the welcoming benefit of starting to disengage our economy from countries like middle eastern fucked up theocracies or tyrants like mr. putin . 
  fun fact !, 
  russia is one of the leaders in the field of nuclear energetics , and builds nuclear reactors wherever it can . 
  is it true that greeks never ever work ? 
  to be fair , both situations are something i can expect from the early 90s russia . 
  we went so far in the last 20 years . 
  what a great propaganda piece . 
  there were two teams `` nhl stars '' and `` nhl league '' . 
  putin was in the first one . 
  both teams consisted mainly of politicians and regional businessmen . 
  nhl legaue did n't have any professional hockey players . 
  edit : nhl here stands for `` night hockey league '', 
  i 'm not sure what 1991 coup you are talking about . 
  on 12 january 1991 yeltzin met ruitel , and estonia was accepted as a sovereign country . 
  on march 3rd 1991 a referendum happened , and estonia left ussr officially . 
  the closest i can think of is the attempted coup of may 1990 , when * pro-ussr * estonians tried to overthrow the high soviet , which just recently renamed estonian soviet socialist republic into estonian republic . 
  edit : i think you mean the august coup , when a group of conservative ussr government members tried to overthrow gorbachev . 
  an armored column was sent from * pskov * ( it was n't already on the estonian territory , like you claim ) , and , on august 21st , took over the tv center in tallin . 
  which they left the very same day , when the coup failed . 
   as the president paused for a short interview surrounded by his security entourage , an old man button-holed him to ask about the benefits he was due as someone affected by the 1986 nuclear disaster in chernobyl . 
  are there any recordings , other reports , anything else on this ? 
  i 'd expect russian opposition to talk about such thing , but i ca n't find anything . 
  well , you may want to include that `` him '' is [ rolandas paulauskas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rolandas_paulauskas ) . 
   if this type of thing happend here im afraid there would be bodies on pikes , burned villages and extermination camps probably not . 
  in 1990 ussr was a rotting carcass , and leaving it was as simple as saying `` we quit '' . 
  he 'd be quite right though .
