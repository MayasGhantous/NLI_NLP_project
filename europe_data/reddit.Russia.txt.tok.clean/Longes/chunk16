  ukraine 's official reason for becoming a country was the coup against soviet government . 
  if we are going to talk about circumstances that lead to molotov-ribentropp pact , then yes . 
   it will not make an iota difference to the simple fact that dividing countries up between dictatorships was a calculated game by both sides to maximize gains and minimize effort . 
  dividing countries was a calculated game by * all sides * . 
  do i really need to remind you about munich betrayal ? 
  chamberlain and daladier could have simply protected czechoslovakia , as per their agreements . 
  but they did n't and that 's that . 
  it may have something to do with bandera being a nationalist terrorist , and his attempts to purge all non-ukrainians . 
  however , what putin said is still true . 
  ussr first tried to make an alliance with france and uk , and when that did n't work out - formed a pact with germany . 
  jumping straight to the last part is an insane attempt to ignore large chunk of the political background of the situation . 
  has the austerity policy * ever * worked ? 
  \u0411\u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440 , \u0411\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0434\u0430 and \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0442 are good movies , though i ca n't vouch for their accuracy - i was too young in the 90s . 
  but they do n't portray the life of modern russia at all . 
  russia went a long way since the 90s . 
  zvyagintsev has said in an interview that he based the movie on the story of [ american welder marvin heemeyer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marvin_heemeyer ), 
  i feel like we live in different russias . 
  plus , need i remind you that leviathan is based on events that happened * in the us * ? 
  if you tried , you might remember that ussr first tried to make a pact with france , uk and poland , and go protect czechoslovakia . 
  except poland wanted a piece of czechoslovakia , and was ( rightly ) afraid that helpful soviet soldiers would n't leave afterwards . 
  and france and uk wanted germany and ussr fight , without being involved themselves . 
  so yes , ussr had to do it , or wait until the germans conquer europe and come to their doorstep . 
  poles were happy to help the germans split czechoslovakia , and its allies were happy to participate in the munich betrayal . 
  you really should n't be pointing fingers over `` helped nazi germany in the beginning '' . 
   there is no place for sensuality , private pleasure , or non-functional beauty . 
  [ here 's a poster motivating the textile industry workers to produce prettier clothing . 
  i do n't have an idealized opinion of the soviet system . 
  it was plagued with problems , most of which were n't solved by the time ussr fell apart . 
  however . 
   soviet visual culture in the posters was incredibly depressing , morose and solemn , humorless and emotionally draining . 
  this is an objective statement . 
  you do n't say `` to me the visual culture was ... '' or `` i think ... '' . 
  you claim that all soviet visiual culture is badwrongdepressing . 
  you claim that this poster is easy identify as a soviet poster , because of how depressing it is , because all soviet posters were depressing . 
  which is easily , verifiably not true , as i have shown . 
   all of those include a political message duh . 
  that 's what propaganda is . 
  what else do you expect from government-produced prosters ? 
   most present a struggle in some way yes , like the first or fourth posters , which say that honest labor will produce good results . 
  or the third poster , which says that the capitalist , thankless job of a store clerk is still important . 
  or the last two posters , glorifying physical fitness . 
   you ca n't really accuse him here , as it 's foremost an opinion informed by his daily life in the soviet union . 
  i can , and i will accuse him of being a troll . 
  or at least a liar . 
   the representation of the body is such that you are supposed to take good care of your body in order to better serve your motherland as a worker/soldier/mother . 
  do the right thing !, 
  fight the man !, 
  eat chips 24/7 and get fat to spite the oppressive soviet government !, 
  i did n't say they were art masterpieces . 
  some are better , some are worse . 
  i merely object to / u/pm _ your_best_thing claim that all soviet art was literally `` big brother is watching you '', 
   try living surrounded by this fake upbeat shit 24/7 . 
   soviet visual culture in the posters was incredibly depressing , morose and solemn , humorless and emotionally draining . 
  so were they depressing , morose and solemn or happy and upbeat ? 
  you ca n't have both . 
  the caption to the shop keeper poster says `` quality trading/store keeping - honorable labor . '', 
   soviet visual culture in the posters was incredibly depressing , morose and solemn , humorless and emotionally draining . 
  you are full of shit .

  if russia does n't have moral authority to call out armenian genocide , than no one in the world has moral authority to call out russia 's position in ukrainian crisis . 
   let 's say you buy a jet for 200 mio . 
  you put it in a hangar . 
  so how does this jet contribute to your economy from that point on , after it has been produced ? 
  it prevents my neighbour from comming to my country and taking away all my mio . 
   it 's the state religion . 
  no , no it is n't . 
  russia is a secular state and has no religion, 
  low oil prices killed shale oil industry , so i 'm not sure how much of a benefit that is . 
  ivan the terrible is a bad example of a `` bad ruller '' . 
  ivan the terrible was pretty decent actually , for his time . 
  he unified russia , broke the khanate 's back , pushed away the turks . 
  his terror campaign is disgusting , but very much in line with the number of people killed in european countries for political and religious reasons . 
  / r/polandball, 
  i 'm curious where you got those numbers . 
  mundi [ lists 2013 ppp as 18k ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/russia/gdp_per_capita_%28ppp%29.html ), 
  that is a useless number . 
  the ppp is interesting , the number of dollars you can get is n't . 
  it 's a damn shame that guardian is not presenting the entire situation . 
   moscow said the move would make u.n. states that do not recognize same-sex marriages liable for the costs of some of those additional benefits and increase the likelihood of fraud . 
  under the new arrangement , according to the russian memo , `` each staff member who is not married can easily register sham traditional or same-sex marriage and can get additional dependency allowances . '', 
  they are not accurate in the slightest . 
  sometimes they are almost opposite of each other . 
  i 'll wait for an official report , rather than `` leaked information '' . 
  this is yet to be proven today . 
  the sun already knew everything it needs to know the day after the crash . 
  quality reporting , amirite ? 
  i do n't see daily mail , fox news and the sun being in danger of closing any time soon . 
  well , that 's a nice country you 've got over here . 
  it would be a shame if something happened to it . 
  poor oppressed crimeans are suffering under the iron heel of the country they did n't vote to join .

   wrong . 
  germany does n't have government media , she has public media . 
  the difference is that they 're not government-controlled nor is there censorship . 
  they are not * directly * government controlled . 
  but heads and editors of every large german newspaper and channel are members of the government propaganda committees , american `` democracy '' organizations , etc. 
   the regulatory committees are made up of an array of different social groups , political parties are just one of them yes , [ ofcom is technically independent from the government . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ofcom ) ofcom also tried to push rt out of britain multiple times due to `` biased coverage '' . 
  ofcom is yet to succeed .
