  merkel will soon be 10 year chancelor , should we call her fuhrer ? 
   any counterarguments ? 
  sure . 
  western media are just as prone to lying as russian media are , and , in many countries , are tightly controlled by the governments , through media regulators ( britain ) or direct ties ( germany ) . 
  access to western channels ( at least the ones broadcasting in russian ) is possible in russia , through various cable providers and internet . 
  you can even get euronews for free . 
  crimea is a decent vacation spot right now , what makes you think otherwise ? 
  wait , what ? 
  emperor of mankind has no redeeming qualities . 
  like , zero . 
  less than putin . 
  teh emperor was a paranoid douchebag with communication issues who refuse to explain any of his policies to his subjects , which resulted in cargo cults after his death . 
  he also doomed humanity by refusing to talk to his kids . 
   secessionism and separatism should always be multilateral and agreed upon does this hold true when the legitimate government of the country has been overthrown in a coup ? 
  and the region that wants out is not supporting the revolutionaries ? 
  discussing what should have been done is all nice and good , but crimea has been demanding a referendum for a long time now . 
  ever since their constitution was removed , and their autonomous status was spit upon . 
  without military action crimea would be stuck in the ukraine , will of the people be damned .

  polish propaganda is bizarre . 
  40 thousand toilets were made in russian empire by 1912 , and 150 thousand were made in ussr in 1929 .

  i 'm assuming he is refering to the [ famous photograph ] ( http://albumwar2.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/39525.jpg ) that shows challenges of language barrier , and power of propaganda . 
  this photo is often presented as a soldier stealing a bike from the german woman . 
  in reality it 's a misunderstanding , the guy wanted to buy it . 
  silly hollande , thinking he has a vote in the matters . 
  why gas ? 
  because gas companies and countries are really good at pushing their interests , and eu is ~ ~ dumb ~ ~ populist enough to go against nuclear powef after fukushima . 
  also , completely remaking you electricity system is bloody expensive . 
  why * russian * gas ? 
  short answer - because there is no other choice . 
  eu produces roughly third of its own gas , and that 's the limit . 
  gas from us is expensive . 
  gas from saudi is blocked by syria . 
  gas from iran is blocked by sanctions . 
  whatever sources eu has are already supplying as much as they can , at a higher than russian price . 
  russia has better than average wealth distribution . 
  jesus christ , cameron , just go ahead and do it then , or shut up . 
  we are at abbot-level of peacock threatening , where every week cameron says a new version of `` we should do something ! '',

  ukrainian couch army in action . 
  and that 's the problem . 
  even if the investigation is truly honest and unbiased , and finds that nemtsov was killed for gambling debts by mafia , or something like that - no one is going to believe that . 
  this is a statement on the level of `` all jews are cunning bastards '' and `` all americans have been genetically cultivated to be fat imperialists '' - stupid and nazist . 
   `` first 1917 , then 1937 . 
  two destructions of the elites led to russia becoming a country of genetic garbage . 
  i 'd ban this country . '', 
  - ksenia sobchak clearly this is the truth we need . 
  various kinds of notable . 
  latinina is probably the most notable liberal journalist , she has been awarded the [ `` defender of freedom '' award ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/latynina1.jpg ) . 
  novodvorskaya has been a leader of multiple parties , before dying last year from infection . 
  sobchak does n't represent any party , but is a highly vocal opposition member , she was a member of russian opposition coordination council . 
  dobrohotov is a leader of the `` 5th december '' party , social movement `` we '' . 
  he 's also a journalist . 
  like , these are n't fringe freaks . 
  this is mainstream opposition in russia . 
  our fringe freaks are ultra-nationalists and neo-nazis , who keep popping up no matter how hard they are squashed . 
  russia houses hundreds of thousands of refuges - literaly mordor . 
  yurop does n't want any refugees - good guy yurop . 
  it does n't really matter now what the investigation finds - public opinion has been formed and the culprit has already been assigned . 
  let me demonstrate why the opposition does n't have support in russia , by using the words of the notable opposition figures . 
  `` i have no illusions about russian language . 
  honestly , i think that cyrillic alphabet is a national disaster , and read more books in english than in russian '' - yulia latinina `` in russia everything spreads around and hangs like pasta from the spoon . 
  1/6th of the earth has been inhabited by spineless protoplasm '' - valeria novodvorskaya `` two thirds ( of russians ) are latent xenophobes , latent criminals '' - roman dobrohotov `` we should stop hypocritical preaching about the veterans ' feelings , which are hurt by attacks on soviet regime .
