   he was once a damn vice-pm of a damn country , and been into politics for over 2 decades . 
  literally everyone who 's over 30 knew him . 
  [ you are verifiably wrong . ] ( http://www.levada.ru/07-02-2014/uznavaemost-oppozitsionnykh-politikov/ ) . 
  45 % of russians knew who nemtsov was , and 1 % trusted him . 
   there are no political threats to putin in the country . 
  he either kills them or imprisons them . 
  and that 's why there are no real opposition , and no leaders of opposition . 
  no , and fuck you . 
  there are no real opposition in russia because everyone in the opposition is a complet fuckwit . 
  here , let me get you some quotes from the opposition . 
  tell me if you would support a person who says that about your country . 
  `` i have no illusions about russian language . 
  honestly , i think that cyrillic alphabet is a national disaster , and read more books in english than in russian '' - yulia latinina `` in russia everything spreads around and hangs like past from the spoon . 
  1/6th of the earth has been inhabited by spineless protoplasm '' - valeria novodvorskaya `` two thirds ( of russians ) are latent xenophobes , latent criminals '' - roman dobrohotov `` we should stop hypocritical preaching about the veterans ' feelings , which are hurt by attacks on soviet regime .

  - ksenia sobchak gee , i wonder why these people have minimal support . 
  surprise : politicians and journalists have more than one enemy , usually . 
  just because putin was a mutual enemy for all of them does n't actually mean anything . 
   shoot them down shoot down planes flying in the international airspace ? 
  yeah , that will go well . 
   imho the most probable theory is a gopnik brainwashed by the propaganda calling nemcov `` traitor of russia '' . 
  antimajdan has huge following , same with the nashi , that 's the kind of people that could get such idea . 
  that 's pretty unlikely . 
  the murder appears to be very well planned , so `` professional hitmen '' is a better theory . 
  only if you are a big fan of panov 's `` secret city '' urban fantasy series . 
  otherwise it 's a real term . 
  will i be able to earn ten thousand democracy points while voting from home ? 
  let 's be neutral and call him the great armenian composer chopinosyan ? 
  have to agree with the map , chocolate and waffles are what i 'd think about . 
  definitely not the french fries . 
  til : dutch is basically transliterated russian . 
  on the scale from bearly to unbearable , how oppressed are you guys feeling ? 
   so after 1 or 2 years passed and after recent accident in baltic sea , same story appeared in the russian internet and as you can see , finally but not suddenly it appeared on russia tv . 
  this article _ is _ about 2014 incident with cook . 
  they are talking about april 2014 in the article , rather than april 2016 . 
  however , i agree , it is written in a deliberately obtuse and confusing way . 
  click here to learn . 
  the democrats hate them . 
  the author is from azerbaijan as far as i can tell . 
  [ there is a video of the aftermath ] ( https://lenta.ru/news/2016/04/11/stavrovid/ ) . 
  latest statement is that there were two attackers . 
  the one who got into the police station got killed , the other blew himself up outside . 
  it 's a training exercise against public protest turned riot , where ` protesters ' start burning tires and attacking people . 
  and this is a training against public protest that has turned into a riot , with burning tires and flying stones . 
  the captions say that , but of course op would rather push his agenda . 
  considering that russian head of the doping lab destroyed most of the samples stored there and suddenly moved to the us to a better job , they can find hard drugs in those tests and russia wo n't be able to prove anything . 
   look up \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432 i 'm pretty sure odessa is not in russia . 
  the other russia are people who think that putin is not hardcore enough . 
  there 's currently some dissent among them over support of crimean referendum and donbas . 
  some think that putin did the right thing , while others think the real leader would have declared war on ukraine and taken kiev by now instead of pussyfooting . 
  just so we are clear , this is an unregistered political party and the members of the march were arrested . 
   ( russian police can now shoot protestors without warning ) . 
  no , russian special services can now use firearms in the crowds in case of a terrorist attack . 
   i 'd see this more as an economic sanction against russian cinema do you honestly believe that any profits from russian movies sold in ukraine actually go to russian movie industry ? 
  i believe brother 2 has been banned in ukraine back in 2014 because of that very ukrainian mafia scene . 
  which is funny , because they were n't even the villains of the story . 
  i like brother 1 better as well , but i like the soundtrack of 2 better . 
  probably because nautilus is something i listen all the time anyway , unlike agata kristi or ocean elzi . 
   i 'm not sure why they say there is no law to permit the authorities to do anything to relatives of terrorists . 
  because this is `` sins of the fathers '' bullshit . 
  your family is not responsible for your behavior , and should not be persecuted for it unless they are directly involved . 
  he was super rich to begin with . 
  his father was on forbes list in 2011 , as 198th richest man in the world . 
  hmmm . 
  why would russia back a pro-russian politician instead of anti-russian one ? 
  someone call sherlock holmes , this mystery is just too complicated . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-russia-death-iduskcn0wq28z  `` the soldier died heroically , calling the strike onto himself after he was discovered and surrounded by terrorists , '' interfax cited the source as saying . 
  you are saying `` russians '' as if ethnical russians have some secret plan according to which they ran the country . 
  you know , like the zion elders . 
  which is why stalin and beria were georgian and sent both russians and non-russians to gulags . 
   this is semi true .
