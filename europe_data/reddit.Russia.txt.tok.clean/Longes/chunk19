  ussr worked on uprooting identity except russian identity which was promoted . 
  oh come on , this is bullshit . 
  how much in common does the ussr have with the russian empire ? 
  it 's as much `` russian '' as it is georgian or kazakh . 
  / u/kinmix explained , while i can explaine the reasoning . 
  international standards . 
  it 's up to the captain to make a decision to prevent the airports from getting in cahoots with certain airlines and refusing their competitors . 
  i ca n't quite tell if you are being sarcastic or not . 
  well , that would be insane , because i do n't think 319 has ever been used in relation to president ( though it could be used for that ) . 
  it 's used when someone insults acting police officers or judges or people like that . 
  the proposed law is silly . 
  but if you have an idiotic law of your own , you do n't get to point fingers and scream bloody murder . 
   another thing is that which countries really go out for looking those people who are talking shit about the leader of their country and who are not . 
  so , when was the last time someone was judged for insulting putin ? 
  article 319 is primarily used when someone is attacking police or judge , since they count as government representatives . 
   these laws are new . 
  they are enforced . 
  they are not enforced because they do n't fucking exist yet . 
  the article is about a law proposal , not an actual law . 
  i 'm still not sure what you are trying to argue . 
  there are laws against insulting the head of the state in most european countries . 
  that is a fact . 
  there 's a law against insulting president of germany . 
  there 's a law against insulting spanish royal family . 
  you are being hypocritical when you are trying to hold this law * proposal * as an example of horrible totalitarian state of russia . 
  this law proposal is stupid , and i hope it does n't get through . 
  but you need to stop lying :  you can ( and people do ) insult the head of state all the time both publicly and privately in any western democracy . 
  and you are trying to equate the law that was actually used with a proposal by a regional pm in russia . 
  [ how about people being fined in spain ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7092866.stm ) ? 
  and look at the downvote brigade rolling in ...  public figures should never be beyond a common man when it comes to law . 
  i agree . 
  this law is stupid , and i hope it wo n't be passed . 
  [ bullshit ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/world/europe/dutch-prosecuting-abulkasim-al-jaberi-over-insults-to-king-willem-alexander.html?_r=0 ) . 
  [ germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/censorship_in_the_federal_republic_of_germany#main_laws ) : disparagement of the federal president . 
  you can be put in jail for up to 5 years . 
  [ spain ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7092866.stm ) : slandering or defaming the spanish royal family can carry a sentence of up to two years in prison . 
  [ netherlands ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/dutch-protester-may-prison-insulting-king-134705446.html ) : a protester who shouted an obscenity about the dutch king could face up to five years in prison and a fine of more than 20,000 euros . 
  virtually every european country has a law against insulting the head of the state . 
  any , except for germany , spain , netherlands , norway ... 
  dude , where do you live ? 
  there are laws against insulting the state and head of the state in most european countries . 
  [ are ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/censorship_in_the_federal_republic_of_germany#main_laws ) [ you ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7092866.stm ) [ sure ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/dutch-protester-may-prison-insulting-king-134705446.html ) ? 
   russia is acting like a parody of itself you know that insulting [ president of germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/censorship_in_the_federal_republic_of_germany#main_laws ) can lead up to 5 years in jail ? 
  hold my vote , i 'm going in !, 
  i know poroshenko is bad , but `` a tyrant and a despot '' ? 
   good guy putin , raising consumption in the us [ i hope not ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuberculosis ), 
  so when will ukraine declare war with russia and stop fighting `` terrorists '' ? 
  it 's stavropol :p also togliatti is a valid english spelling of \u0422\u043e\u043b\u044c\u044f\u0442\u0442\u0438 alongside tolyatti . 
  hughesovka , i guess , would be the most correct . 
   st. petersburg in florida named after the hometown of one of its founders . 
  russian donetsk is the oldest , and is called that because it 's on the river don . 
  ukrainian donetsk was originally called usovka after its founder john hughes . 
  it got renamed into `` stalinov '' after the revolution and in donetsk in the 60s ( after the river donets , which is nowhere near ) . 
  ukrainian ssr was weird . 
  i do n't know what 's up with the kazahkstan 's donetsk village . 
   first , respondents may be lying . 
  in a [ recent study ] ( http://kommersant.ru/doc/2897562 ) , levada center showed that 26 percent of russians are afraid to express their opinions in surveys . 
  asking whether someone supports war in putin 's russia is pretty sensitive ; some may feel lying is safer . 
  so perhaps more russian muslims disapprove of putin 's intervention in syria than we know . 
  it 's like no one bothered to read the third goddamn paragraph of the article they are linking which very clearly states the opinion of the vice-director of levada :  \u0418\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438 \u0432 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0430\u0445 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u043b\u043e\u044f\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043a \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 , \u0447\u0435\u043c \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435 , \u043d\u043e \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441-\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441 \u043d\u0430 5 %  sometimes polled people speak about the government more positively than they really think , ** but in reality the evaluation error is more or less 5 % ** . 
  it 's actually worse . 
  there 's another donetsk in kazakhstan . 
  and there was also another donetsk in luhasnk region of ukraine many years ago . 
  same in russian : `` sobaka layet , karavan idet '' . 
  i think the phrase actually originates in azerbaijan . 
  we have both of those sayings exactly . 
  * the apple does n't fall far from the tree . 
  * make the fool pray to god , he 'll bust his own forehead . 
  * seven fridays in a week -- about a person who changes his mind constantly * you made the porrige - you eat it -- deal with the consequences of your actions * grey gets in the beard , devil gets in the -- old people be crazy, 
  believe it or not , but stalin is also remembered for industrialisation and victory in wwii rather than for gulags . 
  i must be missing the op 's point . 
  5th of march is when stalin died , so people ( most likely organised by the communist party ) gathered to put down flowers for him . 
  is that supposed to be a horrible sign of evil russia being evil ? 
  are we supposed to revile stalin and burn down all images of him ? 
  sealiously ? 
  indeed !, 
  this all worked out swimmingly . 
  phew . 
  navaly avoided the crisis here . 
  i seal what you did there . 
  cool story , bro . 
  economical mismanagement and us being better at the cold war definitely had nothing to do with anything . 
  ussr fell purely because of terror . 
  because countries and alliances do n't last forever . 
  ussr fell apart after 70 years of existence . 
  why would anyone assume that eu is where we hit the perfection , and that alliance will totally last until the heat death of the universe ? 
  guessing what will happen 25 years into the future is pointless , because geopolitical landscape could be completely changed by that point . 
  russia too . 
  quite a few countries , including every single ex-ussr country . 
  at least someone did n't add `` because they were destroyed by glorious stronk russia '' to the text . 
  okay ? 
  what does russia have to do with anything ? 
  in 20-25 years russia could very well not exist either . 
  ussr existed for all of 70 years . 
  talking about things 20 years into the future has all acuracy of reading sheep guts . 
  considering that in 20-25 years nato , ukraine and eu could very well not exist - pretty much , yes . 
   holy shit , this sounds like every post-revolution government ever there , i fixed it . 
  i 've never been so disappointed by the article . 
   i thought that that was just because of tradition . 
  it was because kirza boots used by the russian army were nearly impossible to wear with socks .
