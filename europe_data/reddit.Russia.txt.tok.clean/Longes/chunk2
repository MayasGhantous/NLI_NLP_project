  i.e. , it 's a very general medal that can be awarded for a variety of reasons . 
  what i 'm saying is - you should probably find a better metaphor . 
  a church is a church . 
  it had its moment in the 13th-15th century , when monasteries moved the science forward , and then it went back to being a political institution . 
  i hope it goes away , but it 's highly unlikely . 
  and i would have gotten away with it too , if it were n't for you meddling trolls !, 
  ad hominem , the troll 's last defense . 
   that also happened right after it was annexed with the osce observers ( mainly german ) forbidden from intereting . 
  you mean the osce observers [ that were invited and declined ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/10/ukraine-crisis-referendum-osce-idusl6n0m73ap20140310 ) ? 
  goalpost mover detected . 
  so , via the wayback machine i 've managed to find that picture . 
  [ that 's a photo from 1977 victory parade ] ( http://www.gettyimages.in/detail/news-photo/red-square-moscow-nov-1977-soviet-troops-march-in-the-nov-news-photo/170982774 ) . 
  how exactly is it related to modern russia ? 
   putin is kissing icons at church putin is an orthodox christian , news at 11 . 
   whilst speaking fondly of the ussr i seem to remember him saying `` whoever does not miss the soviet union has no heart . 
  whoever wants it back has no brain . '', 
   they `` they '' here being the communist party of russian federation . 
  gee , i wonder why . 
  also the bbillboard is celebrating the victory in world war 2 , which stalin was kinda sorta involved in . 
   russia unveils two stalin monuments in single day and those people are also worshiping the tzar and are devout christians ? 
  you are an idiot with a horribly twisted view of russia . 
  ~ ~ men in black ~ ~ ~ ~ cia ~ ~ ~ ~ kgb ~ ~ fsb does not in fact come to your house randomly to take you away and brainwash you . 
  clearly he 's a bloodthirsty tyrant that can rival stalin himself . 
  that 's the only way to get such ratings , you know . 
  pretty much no one does that . 
  edit : [ mixing communism and religion is not a purely russian thing by the way ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/02/06/us-greece-lenin-idusl0677226020070206 ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,000,000,000  one billion , short scale ; one thousand million or milliard, 
  then we should be talking about the entire budget , and not just federal budget , no ? 
  in which case the energy resources export ammounts to [ about 30 % ] ( http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/finans/fin21.htm ) . 
  i do n't know how significant that is , because the structure of saudi arabia 's budget is hidden from me . 
   russia would not be able to pay its bills . 
  what , all 46 milliard dollars of debt the state has ? 
  that 's a whooping 2 % of the gdp . 
   instead they have become a white alcoholic saudi arabia saudi arabia - oil export is 45 % of the country 's gdp . 
  russia - oil export is 9 % of the country 's gdp . 
  clearly those two are the same . 
  ah , i see , i 've made a mistake . 
  my bad . 
  but [ ren tv has already apologised for it being a fake ] ( http://ren.tv/novosti/2015-09-21/feyk-pro-uchastie-posla-ssha-v-mitinge-oppozicii-zapustili-blogery ) . 
   no doubt is cast on the photo . 
  ren tv is a channel that makes shows about psychics and aliens . 
  i do n't know why anyone expects real credibility from them . 
  no , russian engineer gennady kravtsov jailed over revealling classified information . 
  which he admitted that he may have done . 
  you are a lying liar who lies . 
  as the article says , the photo is from social networks , and not from any actual media source . 
  in the same way i can claim that [ the rumors of obama being a batman villain ] ( http://www.ayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/funny-barack-obama-faces-4.jpg ) are very definitely not true , and are in fact a dirty provocation by the opposition . 
   fucking putin 's press secretary wears watches that exceeds his annual income . 
  he 's also married to an olympic champion and tv star , whose estimated annual income vastly exceeds the estimated price of that watch . 
   i vividly remember when the court was about to decide wether to give navalny a real prison sentence a bunch of people flooded central moscow and the authorities chickened out . 
  [ 1500 people protesting the sentence does n't even qualify as a mob ] ( http://www.forbes.ru/sobytiya/obshchestvo/online/276895-aktsiya-protesta-protiv-prigovora-bratyam-navalnym-onlain-transly ) . 
  that 's seriously less than 0.1 % of russians . 
   do you guys enjoy getting ripped off and bamboozled or something ? 
  no , i enjoy seeing my country improve and prosper over the last 15 years . 
  ( inb4 `` it 's 100 % oil ! '', 
  wow . 
  it 's hard to imagine a title more confusing and misleading . 
   so many people went into the street that they backpedalled pfhahaha . 
  the largest movement navalny ever got was the bolotnaya riot , and look how well that went . 
  attention to navalny 's trial was negligible , as is navalny himself now . 
  he had his moment , and he failed . 
   i 'm pretty sure that even calling it `` counter-sanctions '' instead of simply `` sanctions '' already strongly implies that it 's the eus fault . 
  i 'm pretty sure it would be an objective truth , because eu imposed sanctions and russia imposed counter-sanctions . 
   pro-kremlin activists even attached fake , us diplomatic licence-plates to a car and filmed it at a campaign rally , to `` prove '' that the opposition are treacherous puppets of the west . 
  it 's not like they even had to do this , when members of the us embassy admit that they visited kostroma and were seen together with navalny & co, 
  not a clue . 
  i do n't think the bolded/unbolded name actually matters that much , since there 's a handy logo on the left side . 
  `` new '' ? 
  only vocal pro-american opposition is the * real * opposition . 
  do n't you know anything about politics ? 
   as for why some of names are in bold , i have no fucking clue . 
  looks like putin 's `` united russia '' and zhirinovsky 's `` ldpr '' both are in bold , so i assume position parties get highlighted while opposition just gets plain font . 
  no , the [ kostroma 's election commitee has clarified this ] ( http://kostroma.izbirkom.ru/way/1049340/sx/art/1101967/cp/1/br/1049344.html.html ) . 
  it 's literally the same writing as in the party 's charter . 
  the parties that have their names bolded had their names bolded in their charters . 
  edit : it 's also the same reason for why some parties are in full capital letters and some are not . 
  in the same sense as `` wanted '' is a russian movie , i suppose . 
   muktah khadimat i 'll admit my ignorance . 
  this is the first time i see these words , and brief google search turned up nothing . 
  is there anything i can read about it ? 
  i 'm sure greece 's kneecaps will be just fine after it refuses to pay its debts . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_cyclone pretty much . 
  the guys who survived the afghanistan war went on to become the al-qaeda , armed with us guns and trained by us soldiers . 
   russia made afghanistan a mess . 
  wooooow . 
  revolutionary mood appears in afghanistan , us starts training and arming the rebels , the afghani government requests the ussr 's help , ussr answers . 
  clearly the afghanistan war happened because ussr decided to answer the legitimate government 's plea for help , and not because of operation cyclone or anything like that . 
  well , eu is the germany 's fourth reich , only via the economic control now . 
  read the greece 's loan agreements . 
  the problem i have is with various journalists saying `` russia promised x in minsk 2 . '', 
  this is always factually wrong and biased , because russia did n't promise anything in minsk 2 . 
  it could n't possibly have promissed anything in minsk 2 ( other than cooperation ) , because russia denies its involvement with the civil war/anti-terrorist operation/russian invasion in the ukraine . 
   but do the same things russia do russian state does not support violence against homosexuals , and does n't promote it . 
  `` the netherlands '' is looking down at you . 
  there are several countries which begin with a definite article . 
  it 's `` the congo '' , `` the sudan '' , `` the netherlands '' , `` the bahamas '' , and `` the philippines '' . 
  also `` the united states '' of course . 
  countries get a `` the '' in english if they are a geographical region like `` the sudan '' , if they are plural noun like `` the netherlands '' , or if they are in long form and have an adjective-noun structure like `` the slovak republic '' . 
  they are also given a `` the '' if they conform to all three of those , like `` the united states '' . 
  so it 's `` the netherlands '' or `` holland '' ( no `` the '' ) .
