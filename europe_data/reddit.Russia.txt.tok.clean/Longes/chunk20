  the portyanki are gone because kirza boots are gone now . 
   soldiers get actual socks instead of rags you really should n't shit on portyanki just like that . 
  there is a number of very good reasons to use them instead of socks . 
  kirza boots were destroying socks in days , while portyanki were much more durable and easier to dry out and reuse . 
  the primary reason for poryanki not being used anymore is the change of army footwear from kirza to combat boots . 
  where was i complaining ? 
  i said that  we are living in 21st century and russian paranoia of the `` evil '' west and the rest of the world is claustrophobic and filled with complexes . 
  is not actually paranoia . 
  how is that complaining ? 
  `` oh , but what about russia ?! '', 
  you say . 
  well , nothing about russia . 
  i was n't talking about russia . 
  nothing ? 
  bush and hitler were n't spies but i would n't call them nice or shy of using military . 
  it 's a `` hilarious '' joke . 
  in russia you register in your regional army center when you are 16 ( i think ) and when you turn 18 and are not studying in the university you get a draft paper . 
  it 's more complex than that , but this is the gyst of things . 
  hopefully by 2032 i 'll be living on mars . 
   we are living in 21st century and russian paranoia of the `` evil '' west and the rest of the world is claustrophobic and filled with complexes . 
  but ... we know that the west is `` evil '' . 
  we know about the nsa , we know about the us spying on every allied government , we know about the us [ instigation of revolutionary activities ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/04/report-u-s-aid-used-hiv-program-in-cuba-to-foment-rebellion/ ) in various countries . 
  the whole `` we are totally innocent friendly bunnies '' thing is n't going to work in 2016 . 
  bloody hilarious . 
   yeah , but not burka-wearing foreign nannies though . 
  do n't be such a nationalist . 
  also it 's a hijab , burka is the one that covers the whole face . 
  russian police has a really bad pr and the 90s attitudes towards it are still stronk . 
  i think it 's just a really cool picture . 
  not really , no . 
  are you people seriously getting into the `` whose account is older '' competition ? 
  it could have been worse , he could have called it `` cock-choker '' .

   barszcz i know as borscht ; the ukranian types apparently look very different due to all the range of varieties . 
  there 's a saying that you can never eat the same borscht from different cooks - everyone has a secret recipe . 
   i do n't know how its done in russia , but we have high schools that teach something specific , from trades like hairdresser and metal works to it , medicine , electrical engineering . 
  there are trade schools in russia called \u041f\u0423 ( pu - profession school ) which teach medium skill level crafts - factory workers , plumbers , farmers , builders , etc. 
  they are currently experiencing a minor renaissance , because skilled workers can earn more than office clerks . 
  the kind of an idiot that attempts to forcefuly subjugate the region the moment ussr fell apart . 
  especially in the case of south ossetia , where they did n't want to be part of georgia . 
  russia , georgia and south ossetia had a peace keeping agreement . 
  turkey and chechnya do n't . 
  we 'd probably have a better opinion of navalny is he : 1 . 
  offered any kind of development plan other than `` fire the current government and everything will magically be better . '', 
  was n't as corrupt as the people he 's fighting against . 
  kadyrov really showed him up by publishing yashin 's report on kadyrov ahead of time in kadyrov 's own instagram . 
   navalny , 39 , who has repeatedly denounced the corruption of russian elites , lauded the decision on his blog . 
   `` the truth is with us and we will win , '' he wrote , adding that he wanted to `` defend the country from the thieves and villains who seized power in russia '' . 
  navalny is trying to keep up the face in a bad position , since the european court neither cancelled the decision of russian court , nor ordered a 100k euros fine that navalny wanted . 
  well , russia does build nuclear reactors for foreign countries , you could always ask ... 
  we are talking about refugees going into europe here . 
  refugees that remained in ukraine are not a subject of discussion by default . 
  put the goal post back please . 
  here 's the original claim :  perhaps some in russia think they can fill europe with more refugees ? 
  here 's my response :  you realise that most ukrainian refugees are in russia , not in europe ? 
  the sources i provided show that most ukrainian refugees that leave ukraine went to russia , and not europe . 
  [ 2014 - euronews . 
  ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2015/04/22/ukraine-crisis-has-created-more-than-2-million-refugees-un-reports/ )  russia has seen 659,143 ukrainians claiming asylum or another form of permission to stay in the country . 
  this number excludes anyone who has chosen to cross the border without contacting the authorities or those with russian citizenship who have left eastern ukraine . 
  [ 2014 - bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29029060 )  in the past three weeks alone , the number of people displaced inside ukraine itself has doubled to at least 260,000 , according to the un 's vincent cochetel in geneva . 
   another 814,000 people have crossed the border into russia this year , he says . 
  [ 2015 - radio liberty . 
  ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-ukraine-asylum-requests-unhcr/27079360.html )  the report by the un refugee agency ( unhcr ) says a total of 271,200 ukrainians applied for refugee status or temporary asylum in russia after the outbreak of the ukraine conflict -- about 99 percent of the asylum claims in russia during 2014 . 
   about 19,000 ukrainians also filed asylum requests in 67 other countries . 
  i believe my point stands - most ukrainian refugees go to russia .

  you realise that most ukrainian refugees are in russia , not in europe ? 
  well yeah , roads and power plants do n't come cheap . 
  putin picks the only place in russia without snow to host the winter olympics . 
  you do know that previous olympic games were held in subtropical cities like turin and nagano ? 
  oh look , a fresh account that spent most of its time talking shit about russia accuses people of being shills . 
  it 's funny how you come up on all russia threads to talk shit . 
   happens all the time . 
  let me re-read the article here ...  in 2015 , aircraft of the russian armed forces violated the estonian airspace on three occasions . 
  my god !, 
  three times ?!!!, 
  that totally is all the time !, 
  but those are russian muslims - not really a conflict . 
  is there something stopping europe from passing similar laws ? 
  ragnarok used to be big in russia .

   the only thing i know about this country is that it 's the poorest in europe .
