  [ i 'm afraid that the ukraine stole the title ] ( http://blogs.elenasmodels.com/en/ukraine-is-rated-as-the-poorest-country-in-europe-by-credit-suisse/ ), 
  no , it 's sadly true for moldova . 
  stolen kidneys are one of the biggest export articles there . 
  it was a joke . 
  verily thou art correct . 
  / s edit : though i suppose you are right . 
  dead language would be a better choice of words than extinct . 
  shakespeare lived all the way back in 16th century , but you 'd probably have trouble trying to read his original writings . 
  languages change over time , all the time . 
  [ here 's a front page of lomonosov 's `` russian grammar '' , 1755 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/lomonosov_russian_grammar_1755_title.png?uselang=ru ) . 
  i can read this , but i 'd never write or say anything like this because the language changed and we no longer even have a letter `` i '' . 
  '' \u042a '' dropped off in most places after the 20th century reform . 
  church slavonic went completely extinct . 
  is it ? 
  i remember it being a thing ten years ago , but i thought the meme sort of died down since then . 
  maybe i 'm just not visiting shitty parts of runet often enough . 
  language arguments are pretty bizarre overall . 
  i mean , both russian and ukrainian languages basically did n't exist in a recognizable form until 16th century , and did n't exist in a modern form until * 20th * . 
  thanks to the communists for uncensoring ukrainian and reforming russian . 
  us will rue the day they crossed us , as we unveil our secret weapon and rename them into ... * burgerstan * . 
  they 'll never see it comming !, 
  the one who does n't jump is a moskal ? 
  hmm , not really - we have both words . 
  rus , ruthenia and russia all come from the same source - name of the people who formed ancient rus . 
  its etymology is a hotly debated topic with no definitive answer . 
  ruthenia and russia are latinized versions of `` rus '' , while rossia is a greek version . 
  in russian language words rus and rossia are both used ( \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c and \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f ) . 
  rus is generally used if you talk about ancient rus , or if you are talking in a mythic sense about russian land or spirit of russia - that sort of thing . 
  rossia is used in normal conversations . 
  [ insult laws ] ( http://www.wpfc.org/site/docs/pdf/insult%20laws-text.pdf ), 
  the reason being that '' `` rus '' or `` russia '' is a historical name for the ukraine '', 
  1 in 4 do n't like answering polls ( 25 % ) . 
  1 in 8 are afraid ( 50 % of 25 % ) . 
  get your numbers right . 
  how is that a worrying number ? 
  [ only 14 % of people in the us contacted by pew research center answer the polls ] ( http://www.people-press.org/2012/05/15/assessing-the-representativeness-of-public-opinion-surveys/ ) . 
  people just do n't like polling anymore . 
  head of the levada center says that they believe the lying only creates about 4 % error in the polls - that 's not that much . 
  muesli is not a real cereal . 
  you are referring [ to the levada poll ] ( http://www.bbc.com/russian/society/2016/01/160122_qd_russia_polls_fear ) ( ru ) which said that 26 % of russians do n't want to answer polls and * 56 % of them * do n't do it because they are afraid of reprecussions . 
  head of levada also commented that they think the polls are no more than 4-6 % wrong due to this . 
  but ... it is n't . 
  it will be an official policy once it has been passed . 
  would n't be the first time a prosecutor 's or deputy 's idea has been denied . 
  uuuuh , i thought prosecutors in russia are a part of the government structure rather than independent contractors . 
  how could there not be a `` kremlin-backed '' prosecutor ? 
  it 's like `` white house backed associate justice seeks ... '', 
  you are welcome to provide a counter-example . 
  i asked you for the truth and instead got anecdotes . 
  this is n't `` truth '' . 
  if i ask trump supporter about a situation in america i would get an opinion , but it would n't be `` truth '' . 
  you ca n't make judgements based on a tiny collection of anecdotes . 
  oh yes , we should totally rely on the testimony of five random people from the street . 
  they know exactly how everything is in crimea !, 
  i see your anecdotes and i raise you [ actual statistics ] ( http://fedpress.ru/news/econom/rest/1419931848-krym-prinyal-chetyre-milliona-turistov-za-2014-god ) ( ru ) . 
  first sentence of my message . 
  there 's a link there . 
   it is no longer touristic . 
  it is empty now if you want to visit . 
  would you mind backing this up with a source of some sourt ? 
  because it was doing fine in 2014 . 
  [ liar liar pants on fire ] ( http://fedpress.ru/news/econom/rest/1419931848-krym-prinyal-chetyre-milliona-turistov-za-2014-god ) . 
  in 2014 crimea has been visited by 4 million tourists , compared to 6 million in 2013 . 
  in 2014 it was 90 % russians . 
  the total number of russians who visited crimea increased three times . 
   whatever georgian troops were doing in georgia it is none of russia 's business . 
  [ it is ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sochi_agreement ) . 
  russia * did n't * ban polish trucks . 
  poland * did n't * ban russian trucks . 
  the old agreement has ended and the new one is being negotiated , and until that is done there is not cargo trucking . 
  this is like feeling butthurt because rech pospolita has invaded tsardom of russia in the past or because of the war of roses or something . 
  no they did n't . 
  [ russia and poland ca n't agree on truck quotas ] ( http://tass.ru/en/economy/853514 ) . 
  meanwhile in ukraine ` activists ' from svoboda and right sector have set up an illegal checkpoint on the border , and now have been legitimized by the government . 
  somehow i doubt russian truck drivers are going to blame russian government for ukrainian nazis ( we are talking about svoboda and right sector here ) blocking the border . 
  as for poland , / u/ivanow is n't quite right . 
  [ the previous agreement between russia and poland has expired ] ( http://uatoday.tv/politics/freight-traffic-between-the-eu-and-russia-is-under-threat-583007.html ) . 
  russia wants to revise it before extending , while poland wants to keep everything as it was . 
  [ currently poland is stalling for time ] ( http://tass.ru/en/economy/853514 ) . 
  since there is no agreement on transportation quotas - no trucks are going from either side . 
  this is n't `` russia spitefully banned polish trucks . '', 
  this is `` russia and poland ca n't agree on truck quotas . '', 
  at the bare minimum russia is supporting syrian kurds .

  [ ukrainian ` activists ' blocked transit of russian trucks through ukraine four days ago .

  ukrainian ` activists ' stopped transit of russian trucks through ukraine , then russia officially banned ukrainian truck transit through russia , and now ukraine officially banned russian truck transit through ukraine . 
  last year there was an article about a british student who moved to poland and flies to england every week because that 's cheaper for him than to live permanently in england , so ... 
  you must be mistaken about something , dolgoprudny has never been a closed city , especialy not after the war when mipt was opened and the place got flooded with students . 
  trains and buses are fine . 
  i used to go to my university on the other end of the town by bus - hour there , hour back . 
  if i wanted to go to the regional center i could use a train or a bus , both are going pretty regularly . 
   some turkish circassians living in adygheya have , however , reportedly been subjected to pressure from russia 's federal security service ( fsb ) to renounce their turkish citizenship . 
  [ the very first article linked by rfel ] ( http://kavpolit.com/articles/iz_kbr_vydvorjajut_ne_po_genam_a_po_pasportu-22684/ ) states that this information turned out to be false , with asker sokht as source . 
  cherry picking information , rfel , as always .
