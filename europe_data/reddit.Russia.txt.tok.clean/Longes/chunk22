  well , it 's not like world war ii was any earlier for europe than it was for us ( okay , technically it was ) . 
  i mean , i guess chechen war sort of counts . 
   i wonder what life 's like in there . 
  probably not that different from any other regional russian town , just with a different vacation schedule . 
  there is n't much inter-city mobility in russia compared to european countries , because everything is far away . 
  my hometown is 2000km away from moscow and 100km away from the regional center ( i.e. 
  the biggest town in the region ) . 
  while i may occasionally go to the regional center to see their theater or to shop in the metro cash & carry , it 's not something i do regularly . 
  you made a very specific statement :  `` they do n't want to fund the infrastructure on a possibly lost territory '' . 
  there is no funding to speak of , because the electricity and infrastructure in crimea are paid for by russians . 
  `` ukraine does n't want to pay for crimean electricity '' and `` ukraine does n't want to sell electricity to crimea '' are two different things . 
  now put the goalpoast back . 
   you 're asking russians , that are lagging with providing necessary infrastructure what are you talking about exactly ? 
  the energy line is being built , supplying 430 megawatt , and is planned to expand in june to 850 megawatt . 
  building a line by sea in a year is relatively fast . 
   or ukrainians whose economy is strained by the conflict , so they do n't want to fund the infrastructure on a possibly lost territory ? 
  the electricity was paid for by russia . 
  and now it is n't ? 
  russia did renovate artek . 
  or is there supposed to be a massive flow of tourists to crimea * in february * ? 
   just months after ** lobbying ** for jeremy corbyn 's election as leader of the uk opposition source : [ dailybeast ] ( http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/17/how-putin-is-meddling-in-england-s-elections.html ) . 
  i guess `` lobbying '' now means providing positive media coverage , rather than influencing the government . 
  it sure is hard to get past the first sentence without lying . 
  you are not even from europe . 
   if they are threatening world war for failure , yes . 
  however , i doubt russia said this and believe this to be a bad translation . 
  does this sound like a threat to you ? 
   `` all sides must be compelled to sit at the negotiating table instead of unleashing a new world war . '', 
  wait wait wait . 
   medvedev , speaking to germany 's handelsblatt newspaper on the eve of talks between major powers on syria in munich , said the united states and russia must exert pressure on all sides in the conflict to secure a ceasefire . 
  so russia is pressuring for the peace talks , and * russia * is the bad guy here ? 
  i meant `` liberal opposition '' - people like navalny , kasianov , kasparov . 
  ldpr are radicals and zhirinovskiy is basically trump for all intents and purposes . 
  kprf are the nostalgia party for old people . 
  polish plumbers are not the same as colonial slaves :p colonial slavs ? 
  well , for the post-reform russian army i think syrian conflict is the first war , so ... 
  united kingdom of great britain and ireland formed in 1801 , united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland formed in 1922 . 
  considering that modern britain is nothing like the british empire - yes , uk is less than 100 years old . 
  economy prognosis above 6 months is quickly approaching the precision of reading sheep guts , so this is really far away you are looking . 
  most countries in the world are less than 200 years old , including russia , uk and saudi arabia . 
  the problem with the most opposition parties in russia is that their agenda starts and ends with `` get us into the government '' . 
  their only promise is to remove putin and replace the government . 
  and that 's a shitty promise when the majority of people like putin . 
  ldpr at least has a program and promises to do things . 
  they are also not the largest by number of members - kprf and ldpr are . 
  i sent a request to our telepath division . 
  they 'll get back to you with the answer in 2-3 months . 
  you can distinguish caucasians from slavs ( in general - slightly darker skin , black hair , more common facial hair ) . 
  i 'm not sure if you can distinguish chechens from non-chechens living in the connected regions . 
  but that 's a wild generalizations - there 's a lot of different people . 
  foreigners keep assuming that russia is literally mordor , with putin as sauron , rulling with the iron hand and micro-managing ever single move of his trusty nazguls . 
  it 's not like there are coalitions , and personal interests and different power groups . 
  ldpr is the biggest ( 250k people ) and most trusted ( 14 % trust zhirinovskiy as a politician ) . 
  communist party is the second largest and most trusted . 
  150k , 9 % russians trust zyuganov . 
  parnas has 46k people , and its leaders enjoy amazing 0.5-1 % of russians trusting them . 
  putin personally baked the cake . 
  so then he can be described as `` russian politician '' . 
  the words `` putin 's opponent attacked '' load the headline . 
  they imply that kasiyanov was attacked * because * he is putin 's opponent . 
  which is n't true . 
   he tried to run for president but he was refused registration . 
  for falsifying signatures . 
  saying that kasyanov is putin 's opponent is weird , when [ only 1.6 % trust him ] ( http://www.levada.ru/old/29-10-2008/reitingi-odobreniya-i-doveriya-prezidentu-pravitelstvu-i-vedushchim-politikam ) according to levada polls . 
  but he did manage to piss off kadyrov somehow ( i was n't following this story so i do n't know what it 's all about ) . 
   mikhail m. kasyanov , a leading figure in the political opposition whose image the leader of chechnya , ramzan a. kadyrov , menacingly posted online in the cross hairs of a sniper rifle this month , was attacked late tuesday in moscow by a dozen or so men who placed a cake on his head at a restaurant . 
  so , kadyrov 's opponent then . 
  not putin 's . 
   the us benefits from having a reputation of reporting as-accurate-as-it-can accurate data . 
  if it simply lied about what russia was doing , it would be harder to make statements about what russia does in the future . 
  so there is some cost to the us that gives it an incentive to provide accurate data . 
  i 'm not so sure about this one . 
  us is in the position where it can tell whatever they want to whomever they want , and no reprecussions would happen . 
  what , sweden would suddenly quit nato and get a real army ? 
  germany would drum up the defense spendings and start developing nuclear missiles ? 
  as long as us is the military force of europe it can freely disregard the opinion of peasants . 
   in donbass : 7,500 + russian infantry according to ukraine 's defense ministry . 
  yeah . 
  that 's exactly how it works when you sign under the peace plan - you choose between a compromise and continuing the armed conflict . 
  you think that ukraine should have continued fighting the rebels ? 
  that would have made everything better ? 
  it depends . 
  which plane you are on and what are you targeting ? 
  the prices were rising from 1994 to 1997 , but for some reason gdp kept falling under yeltzin . 
  it 's almost like government needs to do something other than just watch oligarchs sell oil ... 
  see that gdp graph ? 
  [ from 2000 to 2004 oil prices were falling , not rising ] ( http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/23/oilparabolic1.png ) . 
  russian does n't really have a `` posh '' acccent . 
  it has northern and southern accents , which differ on how you pronounce `` o '' in certain positions ( as o or as a ) , and it has `` literary '' russian and `` folk '' russian , which differ in certain words ( eggplant - \u0431\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0436\u0430\u043d ( baklazhan ) vs. \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 ( sinenkiy , literally `` blue '' ) ) . 
  `` folk russian '' varries from place to place . 
  it has nothing to do with propaganda . 
  total assets of russia in 1999 were $ 100 billion , in 2011 only the stabilization reserve fund was $ 156 billion . 
  [ gdp by ppp increased 8.3 times ] ( http://pics.livejournal.com/yevgeny_buyanov/pic/0000heyt ) . 
  pension increased 3 times , accounting for inflation . 
  unemployment decreased from 13 % to 7 % . 
  external debt decreased from 78 % of gdp to * 2 % of gdp * . 
  number of deaths per year decreased by 9 % . 
  average life expectancy increased by 4 years . 
  ` propaganda ' helps , but there are real results to show for putin 's presidency . 
  putin , some shady guy with puting in background , putin again .
