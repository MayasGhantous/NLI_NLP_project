  you forgot yeltzin . 
  and `` shady guy '' was called medvedev . 
  only when they stop censoring the most important parts . 
  [ said by novodvorskaya ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valeriya_novodvorskaya ), 
  afaik , `` social worker '' in russia is a person that helps lone old people - buying products , buying medicine , assissting in medical procedures assigned to the person , etc. 
  it does n't require university-level education in russia ( though obviously it is a hard work , do n't get me wrong here ) . 
  edit : it 's not [ this ] ( https://www.prospects.ac.uk/job-profiles/social-worker ) . 
  what i mean is - a yeltzin 's government had over a hundred ` advisors ' from the us government structures . 
  this is not how free countries work , you do n't invite people from the foreign government to run your country for you . 
  a number of objectively terrible decisions were made under pressure , like for example making a decades long contract with de birs to sell them diamonds for a negligible price ( a contract that was later revoked by putin ) . 
  i 'm not sure why you are not clicking that - doubting your antivirus ? 
  it 's a collection of audiofiles . 
  [ tl ; dr is here ] ( http://www.interfax.ru/russia/222808 ) ( ru ), 
  i do n't have a good answer to that question . 
  i understand why such laws exist - to prevent hostile takeover via election rigging . 
  that 's a risk that exists . 
  on the other hand , if the public really does support the candidate - then why should n't such candidate hold the post for longer ? 
  longer presidency terms allow for more coherent policies and tighter control . 
   except , you know ... warmer . 
  my hometown reaches +40 in summer . 
  and -15 in winter ...  _ <, 
   that 's mainly down to the massive amounts of influence the kremlin has over internal media outlets and politicians , they only show the ones that are completely insane to make putin look like the only sensible option . 
  of course . 
  [ when nemtsov 's phone calls were published ] ( http://lifenews.ru/news/77459 ) and revealed that nemtsov calls people who support the opposition `` hamsters '' ( runet slang for mindless followers of blogs ) and `` cowardly penguins '' - that was a putin 's conspiracy to twist his words . 
  [ when kasparov bribed fide officials ] ( http://observer.com/2015/11/putins-press-relishes-chess-icon-garry-kasparovs-bribery-scandal/ ) - that was putin personally holding his hand and pushing him to sin . 
  the letter of the law is that the president can hold two consecutive terms . 
  i do n't know what `` the spirit of the law '' was supposed to be , and we can argue about it till the cows come home . 
  we can also argue about yeltzin 's laws and decisions of his administration , since early russian government was running under massive us oversight ( ussr lost cold war and had to pay for it ) . 
  just because a law exists does n't mean it 's a good law . 
   russians also love videogames and porn who does n't love videogames and porn ? 
  sir , do n't leave your computer . 
  [ ivan ] ( http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/391043371306975295/85efe39c55e710d4dff876ffdfed70fcf7e0356e/ ) is on his way to discuss your possession of sensitive information . 
   i refuse to believe that all liberal politicians in russia says `` russian nation is the cancer on the face of the planet '' . 
  not all . 
  just notable personalities that western media calls `` opposition leaders ''  just get rid of putin now why would we get rid of democratically elected president supported by the abolute majority of the population ? 
  what kind of democracy would that be ? 
  yeah , rubles per month , sorry . 
  `` ... the personification of the devil as the symbol of all evil assumes the living shape of the jew . '' gaza war crimes . 
  now try to say that statement is completely without merit . 
  do you see a problem with this kind of logic ? 
  more importantly - it does n't matter is the statement is true or not . 
  you ca n't have a political campaign with that kind of statement !, 
  do you think a politician can be successful in germany by claiming `` all germans are nazis '' ? 
  or in us `` american nation is a warmongering monstrosity , we should submit to the superior wisdom of russia '' ? 
  average salary in russia is about 25-30k rubles per month . 
  about 50k in moscow . 
   liberalism needs to become culturally and politically accepted , no more `` if you disagree with tsar putin you are against russia itself '' and then they 're killed/intimidated/imprisoned / arrested on trumped up charges . 
  liberals needs to be sane before they are accepted . 
  so far russian opposition calls for bloody revolution and tire burning and says things like `` russian nation is the cancer on the face of the planet '' . 
  why do you think they are unpopular ? 
   transparency needs to be at least attempted , no one understands what the fuck is going on in the kremlin ever ; which makes russia all the more scary . 
  how can anyone trust a government like that ? 
  [ russia is improving its transparency international corruption rating every year ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/russia-improves-standing-corruption-league-table-420072 ) . 
  [ well there 's your problem ] ( http://cdn.meme.am/instances/57858087.jpg ) . 
  unqualified labor just does n't pay well . 
  anywhere . 
  low conviction rates are always bad - they mean that the police is taking people in at random and the lawyers have an easy time blowing off the accusations . 
  the court time is wasted , trails go cold , crimes go unsolved . 
  high conviction rates mean one of three things - either courts are not working and just hammer down the `` guilty '' button , or police is working well and only brings actual criminals to court , or police is working terribly and only brings people that are absolutely most certainly guilty to the court . 
  by itself conviction rate does n't show which of the cases is present . 
  japan is case three , for example . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  are you insane ? 
  us had 93 % conviction rate in 2012 . 
  japan has * 99.97 % * conviction rate . 
  high conviction rates * are normal * . 
  or , you know , when the police is doing their job . 
  if your courts have a 50 % conviction rate , then your police is shit and is bringing up people to court more or less at random . 
   first you need to understand that in russia courts have 95 % conviction rates . 
  you say it like that 's a bad thing . 
  let 's not be overly optimistic . 
  yup . 
  where are the news of greece 's economy these days ? 
  yup . 
  while it 's true that the interest rate is n't going down to fend off inflation , it 's not really `` hiked '' . 
  it is currently 11 % . 
  [ here 's the graph of interest rate since 1992 to 2009 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/cbr_discount_rate_1992-2009.png?uselang=ru ) . 
  from 2009 to 2015 it went down to 8 % . 
  i 'm pretty sure that i can randomly pick a country and a year and find '' ____ is on the verge of collapse '' article . 
  there are ancient egyptian memos from the priests to the pharaoh about the upcomming end of the world because the youths are disrespecting the gods and not doing proper work . 
  it 's kind of a complex problem . 
  i think it is a sign of stength in comparison to the insanity of negative interest rates which are sweeping the world , but i 'm really not qualified to properly discuss this . 
  the entire article is filled with these leaps . 
  russia still has massive currency reserves , gold reserves , positive ( 11 % ) bank interest rate and tiny government debts . 
  we are years away from `` economy collapse '' . 
  i honestly do n't know what his job is supposed to be . 
  the * average * salary in my small hometown ( south of russia , near ukraine ) is 300 $ a month . 
  i worked for 800 $ as a programmer . 
  he must be a janitor or something . 
   if you have good income 600-700 $ if we are talking about moscow , then that 's not a `` good '' income - that 's average income . 
  [ average wages by profession in moscow ] ( http://bs-life.ru/rabota/zarplata/moskwa2013.html ) , for those curious . 
  in russian , so google translate . 
  yeah , but with those skills you can make a comfortable living in any country , including your own . 
  programmers have pretty good income in russia . 
  so do good engineers and good doctors . 
  and if you are shit at your job , then moving to sweden wo n't make your life better . 
  a degree in anything wo n't guarantee you anything . 
  job experience is the only thing that really counts . 
   interested in the other side of this story , meduza spoke with some of the crimeans who dissent from the majority view . 
  ah , where would we be without the clickbait titles hiding the minority report .
