   you hear about various complications , whether it 's finding a job or trying to get service at a clinic . 
  a while back , my head was aching badly and i decided to go see a doctor . 
  before , you could just go to the neurologist . 
  now , in order to get to him , you have to get a referral from a general practitioner . 
  welcome to european medicine , lady . 
  i 'm just explaining why he is confused - if you only know the russian name for it , then there 's no way you can decipher what `` plc '' stands for . 
  in russian `` polish-lithuanian commonwealth '' is '' \u0420\u0435\u0447\u044c \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0430\u044f '' ( rzeczpospolita ) , which does n't sound or translate anywhere close to `` polish-lithuanian commonwealth '' . 
  so it 's confusing if you do n't know the english term . 
   like aksakov said in his editorial for the '' \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c '' now , i could n't actually find the quote and understand the context ( and i have reasons to believe it is important here - aksakov was promoting various democratic initiatives in bulgaria ) , but why are you bringing up things written by 19th century poet ? 
  he is trolling .

  in the land of steel beams and jet fuel putin is behind everything , comrade . 
  [ greek economic crisis too ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/42x21s/why_is_russia_sowing_discontent_among_russians/czdszms ) . 
  an you are linching negroes . 
  you know how this argument goes , right ? 
  if hitler says that you are a tyranical asshole because of x , then ignoring everything just because it was hitler who said it is not the solution . 
  the best movie is a shitty gag comedy that parodies a bunch of different western and russian movies . 
  it features some decent russian comedians and satirists , but is still shit . 
  has 3.1 / 10 on russian imdb clone . 
  was a massive success in the first week due to its cast , but lost 72 % of views by the second week . 
  the script writer died in an airplane crash in 2006 , before he could see the movie finished . 
  too long did n't watch . 
  he wants a short summary of the movies . 
   in russia you can cover up an investigation about a blown up building which lead to a war against chechnia . 
  `` jet fuel ca n't melt steel beams '' ? 
  really ? 
  this ? 
   maybe putin ca n't stomach the idea of a well-liked but not terribly important russia that is one of many medium-sized powers . 
  it 's much simpler . 
  when putin suggested that russia may become part of nato , putin 's ratings took a plunge . 
  russians do n't believe in nato or us 's good intentions . 
  putin is behind the refugee crisis now ? 
  seriously ? 
  and the greece 's shit economical situation ? 
   it just feels like being scolded by north korea about human rights . 
  you do n't need to be wearing all white to notice that the shit stinks . 
  if you are being scolded by north korea about human rights , it does n't mean you can just ignore the broken human rights . 
  that 's an ad hominem argument , and that argument is shit . 
  [ sure ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bsxtocmceaawqk6.jpg ) . 
  which would prove what exactly ? 
  that old boy networks are totally a thing ? 
  whataboutism in action . 
   is the eu really a european union of european values ? 
  or is it nothing more than a paperwork of functionaries and diktat from franco-german interests for the continent under its control ? 
  it 's a union of countries that protects and promotes the interests of its members . 
  they are not the justice league . 
  and please stop screaming . 
   is ukraine worthy of no western and european solidarity solely because it is n't a paper signatory ? 
  yes . 
  that 's how agreements work . 
  if you are not part of nato , then you are not obligated to do what nato asks , and nato is not obligated to help you . 
  what agreements are we talking about here ? 
   in the end , the bill in the duma failed to pass . 
  perhaps the many closeted homosexuals in russia 's business and political elite frustrated the legislation . 
  but there is no guarantee it will not resurface . 
  did they really have to fall back on `` you only hate gays because you are gay yourself '' attack ? 
   what the russian military requires is a big efficiency upgrade [ it got one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_russian_military_reform ) . 
  while there 's still a need of technical upgrade , the structural reorganization has been fairly successful . 
  49 % answered that russians do n't like to answer polls ( which , ironically , means that most russians do like answering polls ) , and 56 % of them said that russians do n't like answering polls because they are afraid of negative consequences . 
  let 's be clear here . 
  it 's not `` 26 % of russians are scared to talk to pollsters '' . 
  it 's `` 26 % of russians think russians are not honest with the pollsters because they are afraid of consequnces '' . 
  which is something i can believe . 
  because this is what russian opposition really believes - that everyone in the country is oppressed and controlled by the evil government . 
  sadly , he 's been giving the silent treatment ever since we switched to this newfangled `` democracy '' thing . 
  this metric shows the correlation between price of oil and price of petrol . 
  it 's useful , because a lot of people love to claim that the price of petrol always goes up in russia , no matter the price of oil . 
   oleg chernozub , the head of the polling company , told the russian business newspaper vedemosti that russians may be happy because they feel relieved . 
  `` panic in december 2014 - january 2015 was replaced by the euphoria of the fact that a disaster did not happen , '' he said . 
  and he 's right . 
  things are nowhere near as bad as they were in 1998 . 
  because he 's lying . 
  [ here 's the graph that shows price of petrol in russia in barrels of oil per year ] ( http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/fritzmorgen/12791732/298847/298847_900.png ) . 
  [ here 's an up to date comparison of petrol prices in europe in euro ] ( http://autotraveler.ru/spravka/benzine-in-europe.html#.vqazjfnhcm8 ) . 
  it 's in russian , but you can follow the flags or use google translate . 
  petrol in norway is three times as expensive as it is in russia , for example . 
   jak ci na imi\u0119 i see bits that bled out into ukrainian !, 
  most times duma gets things right no one hears about it . 
   yes , russians have worst english proficiency in europe . 
  worst after turkey and azerbaijan , nearly identical with france ( 0.25 points of difference ) . 
  yup . 
  if you live alone on minimum wage - you are basically fucked . 
  15 % of russians live below the poverty line though , so you can survive apparently . 
  because it 's not imported . 
  things made abroad are now very expensive , but things made in russia grow in price at a much more realistic rate . 
  newsflash - ussr fell apart 25 years ago . 
   that 's why russians are n't using google and facebook , but instead their services vkontakte and yandex that 's ... a rather bizarre explanation . 
  russians are using vkontakte and yandex because they were first to claim the market . 
  yandex is only two years older than google , for example . 
  by the time facebook became a thing vkontakte has made a successful ( and arguably better designed ) clone and took over the market and crushed other , shittier clones . 
  and then people did n't move to facebook because they already have an established social network . 
   roads are from stalin era . 
  and there 's rampant crime on the streets is this what polish news tell about russia ? 
  because things are nowhere near as bad as you say , [ especially if you take other countries into comparison . ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/russia/united-states/crime ) . 
  although yes , things could be better . 
  we are not germany yet . 
  russia is currently capitalizing on its weak currency and is improving its domestic goods production to replace the import products . 
  that 's minimum wage . 
  average wage in 2014 was 32611 rubles ( $ 377 ) . 
  median across russia : 25 rubles for a kilo .
