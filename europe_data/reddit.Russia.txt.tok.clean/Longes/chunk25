  i highly recommend reading [ this article ] ( http://polismi.ru/politika/geografiya-i-politesy/1293-eto-ne-rossiya-putinskaya-eto-putin-rossijskij.html ) ( ru ) . 
  what do you consider to be `` the truth '' ? 
  cnn ? 
  fox news ? 
  zero hedge ? 
  euronews ? 
  the last two are available in russian on tv . 
  people in russia * do * have access to a non-government viewpoint . 
  by total number of users that 's more than the number of people who just live in germany , so i do n't know what you are raving about . 
  people who consider official news to be propaganda , have access to internet and do n't speak english can bloody well read something like slon.ru , tvrain.ru , echo.msk.ru or any other oppositionaly-minded website . 
  or even livejournal . 
  it 's really funny how people still believe that putin 's support ratings are rigged , and that russians * actually * disagree with what the government but are too afraid to speak . 
   russian internet is shit bullshit . 
  russia has 67 % of people with access to internet , or 87.5 million people . 
  that 's 67th and 6th place in the world . 
  there are also plenty of pro-western and/or oppositional media in radio and newspapers . 
  i 'm rather curious as to what documentary that is . 
  i could n't find anything about orlov , gum and us , but maybe i just did n't search hard enough . 
  anglia = england , but is frequently expanded to include the entirety of uk . 
  the data is , sadly , meaningless , without a comparison with the data in previous years . 
  plus the prices are give in hrivna , rather than being converted into something universal . 
  russia responded to protect a peacekeeping agreement it had with ossetia and georgia . 
  soylent green is people !, 
  people !, 
   nobody wants them never said that . 
  * government * does n't want them in the public libraries owned by the government . 
   why are you apologizing for nazism ? 
  we can talk about nazism when owning and selling those books is verbotten . 
  slippery slope and all that . 
   it 's like banning quran in a country with a christian majority . 
  not banning in general - banning from the state-owned libraries . 
  you can go to a shop and buy as many soros ' books as you want . 
   you can always give it to people who are willing to own new books like these . 
  i wrote :  they ca n't donate them to someone , because state giving out books that were confiscated from state institutions for being anti-state would be very silly and defeat the purpose . 
  the government does n't want to pay for spreading certain ideas . 
  that 's understandable . 
  but that means they ca n't give out books they confiscated , because they confiscated them precisely not to give out those books . 
  while the analogy is understandable , and looks very bad - what are you going to do with them ? 
  they ca n't donate them to someone , because state giving out books that were confiscated from state institutions for being anti-state would be very silly and defeat the purpose . 
  it 's not like you ca n't buy or sell soros ' books . 
  they are not confiscated from the stores . 
  they are confiscated from state-run libraries . 
   putin did n't exactly create the climate that would prevent these kind of happenings . 
  why would he ? 
  stalin is fairly popular in russia now , and he has been popular in russia twenty years ago . 
  kinda hard to say , because my diet is weird . 
  i mostly eat meat , vegetable salads and porridge ( [ buckwheat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kasha ) , [ pearl barley ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pearl_barley ) and [ maize porrige ] ( http://www.vkusnopolezno.ru/images/stories/receipts/kasha/kukur_kasha2.jpg ) ) . 
  and soups sometimes . 
  but as far as i know , chicken and pork dishes are common , and potatoes and porrige are common garnishes . 
  i do n't know what this `` dried hedgehog '' thing is all about . 
  we do n't actually eat all that much bacon in russia . 
  for some reason . 
  not every politician is an oligarch , but most oligarchs eventually get into politics . 
  some try and then back out , like [ prokhorov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_prokhorov ) . 
  `` cheap mass produced housing '' and `` well done and beautiful '' rarely go together . 
  it 's fair . 
  you whine about ugly soviet appartment buildings , we whine about [ ugly american houses with paper-thin walls ] ( http://www.homefuture.website/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/american-suburban-neighborhood-cmxkmt02.jpg ) . 
  i guess `` armed police raid officies of russian oligarch mikhail khodorkovsky in moscow '' does n't sound as good . 
  i 'm afraid i left my economics degree in my other pants . 
   and are still relevant these days this is an important point . 
  there 's nothing wrong with studying the methods used in the past and trying to figure out which of them were functional and can be used today . 
  a bigger problem is that solzhenitsyn is incredibly biased against the ussr , and was promoting tsarizm like it was the best thing in the world . 
  as such , everything he says about the us must be taken with a pound of salt . 
  i could be wrong , but i think the gulag archipelago is on the summer reading list . 
  the curious hypocrisy of the anti-kremlin poster : armed takeover of the government in ukraine : totally legitimate democracy . 
  protest in montenegro : paid russian shills , all 5000 of them . 
  the context are montenegro 's population protesting joining the nato , and russia having reasonable fears about nato . 
  you are missing the point . 
  as does / u/syndane _ x though . 
  zhirinovskiy is neither a lunatic nor a fool . 
  zhirinovskiy is popular . 
  there absolutely are people in russia who think that putin should be playing tougher , that we should nuke the us right fucking now , and that we should finally stop ~ ~ all the blacks from voting ~ ~ all the chechens from getting subsidies . 
  and these people are the ones that are going to vote for zhirinovskiy , because that 's what zhirinovskiy promises them . 
  nemtsov was a politician and a businessman , and was periodically criticizing islam . 
  yes , it is quite possible that nemtsov 's death was n't a kremlin-mandated hit . 
  you must have missed the part where the protests are against the corrupt government . 
  three rings for the baltic kings under the sky , seven for the caucasus lords in their halls of stone , nine for the asian stans doomed to die , one for the dark lord on his dark throne in the land of russia where the winters lie, 
  so you are against people of montenegro democratically making a decision ? 
  done . 
  the absolute majority of security patches are dealing with online functionality though , which hopefully is n't present on the nuclear power plant terminal . 
  meduza tends to be biased when they give opinions rather than sticking to the facts . 
  it also probably wo n't be around for long , because meduza is already in debt and makes no profit . 
  come on , we had this topic already . 
  dobryakova was being sarcastic about the whole thing , and the reporter did n't bother to clarify . 
  [ previous thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3wahnp/russian_production_of_tshirts_with_antiturkish/ ), 
  he 's not talking about abolishing conscription , he 's talking about conscripting women into the army . 
  hurr durr , how do i read . 
  i read that as `` volunteer battalion of fighting pro-russian insurgents '' . 
  what agreements ? 
  i 'm pretty sure joint control commission did n't set any limits on how long the peace keeping forces can stay . 
   reportedly being held by a volunteer battalion fighting pro-russian insurgents in the east of the ex-soviet state .

  [ just five days ago it was svoboda 's ultra-nationalists ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/dec/07/stolen-dutch-paintings-sale-ukrainian-militia ) ~ ~, 
  yeah , i 've added a bit on transinistria in the edit . 
  for both countries main export is crime . 
  to qoute obi-wan kenobi : `` only sith deal in absolutes '' . 
  `` pretty poor '' is an understatement of the century . 
  moldova is the poorest country in europe . 
  one of moldova 's leading export articles [ * are stolen human kidneys * ] ( http://ihatedialysis.com/forum/index.php?topic=8188.0 ) . 
  transnistria is * slightly * better than moldova , because transnistria gets economic aid from russia while moldova is kinda on its own .
