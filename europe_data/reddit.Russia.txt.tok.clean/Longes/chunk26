  average salary in transnistria is 180 $ vs. 120 $ in moldova . 
  i do n't have any information on how well does the law enforcement works in either of the countries , but i ca n't imagine it works well . 
  edit : google-fu has been unleashed . 
  transnistria 's chief exports are knock-offs of old russian weapons , and trans-shipping of afghanistan opium . 
  so yes , transnistria is also a shithole . 
  that 's ... an interesting conclusion . 
  yeah . 
  all that time we are using definite articles in russian , we always add `` the '' . 
  [ there is no real consensus on `` the ukraine '' or `` ukraine '' ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18233844 ) , but `` the '' causes waves of butthurt in ukrainian nationalists who percieve it as some sort of attack on their independence . 
   check who the ceo is should i know who alexander ordzjonikidze is ? 
  he was ceo of ren-tv , so ? 
   the list of the nmg shareholders gazprom 's proxy , a non-state owned bank , a non-state owned gas company and a russo-finnish enterprenuer . 
  70 % of rsn is owned by structures that are not state-owned . 
  that 's a great question . 
  officially , there is no war . 
  what is happening in donbas is an anti-terrorist operation . 
  however , the armed conflict seems to be quieting down , and [ with joe biden ordering the course to decentralization ] ( https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/12/09/remarks-vice-president-joe-biden-ukrainian-rada ) we may see ukraine fulfilling minsk ii . 
  but coal supplies have nothing to do with the conflict in donbas . 
  russia cut coal deliveries when ukraine stopped supplying power to crimea , and russia resumed coal deliveries when ukraine restored power . 
   rsn fabricating fake news is not surprising . 
  it 's their job as a state owned source of propaganda . 
  rsn is not state owned . 
   deliveries of coking coal to the ukraine have been resumed . 
  this was reported on thursday , december 10th , by minister of energy of russian federation alexander novak . 
   `` yesterday ( december 9th ) president gave an order to resume the deliveries . 
  coking coal is already being supplied to the industries that use it '' , - told the minister to the journalists . 
   the president has explained that this must be done , because kiev has turned on a power line `` kahovskaia - titan - krasnoperekopsk '' that delivers energy to crimea . 
  the rest of the article is a recap of the energy crisis , so i wo n't bother translating it . 
  singular is definitely `` ingush '' . 
   from a car passing by ? 
  yes . 
   and they got away without anyone seeing what the car or the guy looked like ? 
  apparently the incident was caught on video by a surveilance cam from the nearby building . 
   the actual definiton is : which means the forbes article is lying , as the definition i provided is taken from the article . 
  i 'm saying absolutely nothing about the bcg report - only about the forbes article that draws certain conclusions from the report . 
   http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2013/10/10/231446353/if-you-think-wealth-disparity-is-bad-herez-look-at-russia credit suisse 's report is so bad , that i do n't even know where to begin . 
  they do n't reveal how they got the numbers , and no sane mathematical methods can result in the same value of real estate per person that cs got . 
  according to them people of taiwan are twice as rich as russians are , and median household value in russia is supposed to be 871 $ . 
  considering that the mass majority of russians own real estate , this is insane . 
  gini is weighted by the greatness of distribution . 
  if we have one man with salary of 100000000000 $ and 100000000000 men with salary of 0 $ , then we have gini of 100 . 
  can someone provide context ? 
  is there something bad happening in finland ? 
  are these the poor people/refugees ? 
  it 's an automated system for making truckers pay for usage of federal roads as a compensation for damage trucks do to the roads . 
   i would not believe longes without any sources . 
  he is very biased toward russia , and i admit while i am biased against russia i can back up what i say with sources . 
  i linked my source . 
  it 's literally the article that started the `` 70 % '' meme . 
  there are problems , but they are not world-ending level bad . 
  by [ gini index ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2172rank.html ) russia is slightly better than us and china , but much worse than germany . 
   i heard recently that 70 % of the wealth of your country is held by 1 % of its residents . 
  this is a well known meme originating [ from forbes ( ru ) ] ( http://www.forbes.ru/sobytiya/82724-bcg-rossiiskie-millionery-kontroliruyut-70-bogatstva-strany ) . 
  it is somewhat deceptive . 
  the forbes ' data comes from global wealth report by boston consulting group . 
  this report defines wealth as `` total value of controlled investment assets and cash . 
  personal business , non-investment real estate and luxury items are not considered '' . 
  so the fact that i own an apartment , but do n't own any stocks makes me a penniless bum . 
  not a different rock band . 
  `` va-bank '' . 
  the ones who are singing the song in the article . 
  the song that you linked . 
  that group does n't exist anymore . 
  that does n't stop its members from getting together and performing a song . 
  because , you know , members of va-bank are n't dead and can get together . 
  va-bank 's ex-members are the ones singing `` and after berlin '' . 
  oh come on now . 
  you do n't have to disguise your activities . 
  [ even bbc knows about them ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/monitoring/ukraines-new-online-army-in-media-war-with-russia ) . 
  the author is n't lying and the song does exist . 
  but the rock band no longer does . 
  the song is a stand-alone creation by sclar and his ex-group-members . 
  did you really have to edit the title ? 
  what was wrong with the original :  ** russia ratchets up war rhetoric - and not just in syria ** a rock band sings about taking berlin ; politicians and the media threaten a nuclear attack . 
  the war rhetoric in russia is impossible to ignore . 
  but there 's a different mood within russian society . 
  not to mention the stuff at the end of the article :  jens siegert , head of the moscow office of the heinrich b\u00f6ll foundation , told dw that war fantasies are not that widespread in russia . 
  so , well done , sir troll . 
  you 've twisted the message excellently . 
  unrelated to the core message , but possibly interesting : `` va-bank '' rock band fell apart in 2008 , because the group leader and founder decided to go solo . 
  edit : a number of people seem to be confused by what i wrote . 
  the song in question exists , and was performed by alexander sclar ( ex-leader and founder of va-bank ) and ex-members of va-bank . 
  this is a response to the trucker protests over `` platon '' system that were happening recently . 
  we are yet to see the reaction . 
  what do you call us 's war in iraq and fight against isis then ? 
  oh , and bombing of libya , let 's not forget about that . 
   what you stated as good is incredibly pathetic . 
  you guys keep saying that , but no one puts out any numbers . 
  from what i could gather , us was harvesting 90 million ton of grain in the 30s , and 140 in the 50s . 
  compared to ussr 's 95 in 1940 , * 47 in 1945 * , and 125 in 1960 . 
  but hey , let 's all ignore world war ii . 
  it 's not like anything happend on soviet territory at that time , right ? 
  my disgust comes from the fact that ` organic ' food is a marketing strategy . 
  corporations like monsanto are doing horrible things to ensure their monopoly , but that 's not the reason to give up on genetically modified products and modern pesticides . 
  i fail to see how this article is relevant . 
  / u/nazgobius is talking about collectivization , which ended by 1950 . 
  the data in the article does n't even start until 1966 . 
  to say that collectivization had positive/negative impact you need to compare it with how things were before that . 
  also the article does n't appear to provide sources for the information in the tables , which go against the things i 've read . 
  that 's actually not true .
