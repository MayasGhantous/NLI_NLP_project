  the agriculture in ussr was doing pretty well once it got over the transition phase . 
  the amount of produced meat and grain doubled from 1913 to 1980 . 
   organic food production yay . 
   and that would be fine if the constitution originally stipulated a 6 year term . 
  amending it from 4 years to 6 years is granting the president a lot more power than he was originally intended to have . 
  the original term ( in 1991 ) was 5 years . 
  in 1993 it was reduced to 4 years . 
  in 2012 it was increased to 6 . 
  moscow being anywhere near the word `` cheapest '' is just bizarre . 
   amendments that weaken the constitution i do n't consider the extention of a presidential term to 6 years to be a weakness . 
  there is n't anything magical about 4 years . 
   stay in power indefinitely you still need to be actually elected . 
   was n't the limit to consecutive terms rather then total number a loophole introduced by yeltsin ? 
  the entire constitution was written during yeltsin 's term , with him being the first president of russian federation and all . 
   also , how about extending the term from 4 years to 6 ? 
  using consitutional way to introduce amendments to the constitution is hardly `` not caring about the constitution '' . 
  would you like to provide an example of the state not caring about the constitution ? 
  because that would be easier for all of us . 
  i ca n't remember any other notable examples where constitution * could have been broken * , but was n't . 
  well , that 's a rather broad question . 
  would you accept the answer `` putin , when he became a prime minister for four years instead of shitting on the constitution and going for the third consecutive term '' ? 
  these are n't ` real ' words . 
  judging by '' \u0438\u0437\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0434 '' i would assume this is something from dota voice chat . 
   in place of ** ideology-based opposition ** to the west , russia 's troll state offers up only irascibility and schadenfreude , the glee derived from other people 's frustrations . 
  russian constitution does n't allow us to have a state ideology . 
  edit : a number of people seem unhappy with this . 
  [ you can check it for yourself ] ( http://www.constitution.ru/10003000/10003000-3.htm ) : article 13.2 . 
  `` no ideology can be made state or mandatory '' . 
  that is a lovely whataboutism , but bandera is an actual nazi collaborator . 
  whatever stalin did does n't purify bandera . 
   the reason why the majority of the russian population sincerely believes that the government of ukraine consists of a fascist junta has also to do with the specific russian connotation of this concept i 'd say that maidan being filled with the [ portraits of bandera ] ( http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/drugoi/484155/8944310/8944310_original.jpg ) played a major role in the `` fascist junta '' meme . 
   it is therefore no surprise that in russia , members of the democratic opposition , the real anti-fascists , are called `` demofascists . '' it mirrors -- 80 years later -- stalin 's attacks on the `` social fascists . '' this usage of the term is entirely new to me . 
  the term itself is highly antiquated , and barely used in the modern language . 
  it comes from the 1990s , when new democrats were writing angry letters and organizing angry meetings demanding that communist party must be squashed , communism must be banned , and anyone who looks even a little bit red must be shot . 
  hence the joking term . 
  its usage in the context of euromaidan is exactly the same - new democratic ukrainian government stiffling freedom of speech , banning communist party , etc leads to them being called demofascists . 
  still , the term is extremely rare . 
  of course he does . 
  stop . 
  it 's an example . 
  do n't read too much into it . 
  i do n't expect texas to become a glorious barony either . 
  if you want to be technical - ussr included a number of territories that used to be part of the polish rebulic . 
  but honestly , i do n't care . 
  this is n't a topic about whether poland was part of the soviet union ( polish republic or its successor states were n't ) . 
   come on , look at the old soviet roubles in your wallet oh yeah , just let me find them in between those imperial rubles , deutsche marks and cowrie shells i keep in my wallet . 
  let 's say that countries finally decide to demand us pays its debt , the economy crashes and now there 's chaos everywhere . 
  various states get angry at each other , and decide to spilt . 
  alaska joins canada , texas becomes glorious barony of texas , and so on . 
  but everything from iowa and to the east stays together , and renames itself into best empire of murica . 
  best empire can claim that they are the ** successor state ** to the usa , which would mean that they take on the rights ( such as place in un and nato ) and obligations ( debts , place in nato ) of the usa . 
  ussr did n't just `` rename its country '' . 
  it fell apart . 
  kazakhstan went its own way , russia went its own way . 
  and russia became the successor state to the ussr . 
  rewrites ? 
  was n't lugovoy 's innocence a russian version all this time ? 
  what , do you just let anyone come and wash * your * hands ?!, 
  the west 's moral values trully are all rotten !, 
  it 's worth noting that the alleged connection with chaika did n't save them from life sentence . 
   the protesters threatened a full blockade of moscow today unless their demands for a radical restructuring of the government are met . 
  russia 's riot and traffic police have not been able to halt the convoys , and the russian government has refused good-faith talks . 
  [ aaaand it 's gone ] ( http://www.bbc.com/russian/russia/2015/11/151130_lorries_strike_vologda ) . 
   russian authorities have successfuly prevented a mass protest by truckers from various regions of the country , who were planning to arrive to moscow by monday and block the traffic on mkad . 
  is this a joke , forbes ? 
   putin 's propaganda machine can not brand three million ordinary citizens as traitors and cia agents . 
  you do n't need to brand three million ordinary citizens as cia agents . 
  you only need to brand the leaders and the firestarters . 
  your py-sql library 's directory does n't exist . 
  successfuly installed py-sql library into empty directory . 
  you are missing py-sql library . 
  ha , just think about all the dependencies you need to resolve for the soap !, 
  ''   sudo wash_hands . sh '', 
   butthurt belt is that what we are calling the baltics now ? 
  `` cyka '' ? 
  what is this shit ? 
  where is my glorious '' \u0419\u0426\u0423\u041a\u0415\u041d '' ? 
  this is also what happens when said farmers burn down their fields and kill the animals rather than share them in kolhoz . 
  do n't get me wrong , the entire thing was horribly mismanaged , but management was far from the only problem . 
  title edited to a more neutral tone . 
   thanks for playing right into isis propaganda pal , you are not even trying . 
  `` crusade '' * is * isis propaganda . 
  like , seriously . 
  read the article . 
  isis spokesman is the one saying the word `` crusade '' . 
  if you tried reading past the headline , you 'd learn that it was isis spokesman who called russia 's aid in syria a crusade . 
  not chaplin . 
  misleading title - isis spokesman is the one who called it a crusade , not chaplin . 
  `` that guy said that russian army went to fight terrorism which is a holy war or something like that . '', 
   `` the fight with terrorism is a holy battle , '' said chaplin literally the second paragraph of the article . 
  he does n't use the word `` crusade '' in this article either . 
  isis 's spokesman is the one who calls russia 's actions a crusade . 
   in mid-october , abu muhammad al-adnani , the official spokesman for the islamic state , called for jihad against russia . 
  in a 40-minute audio message that also included an appeal for `` islamic youth '' to `` ignite '' attacks against the united states , adnani singled out chaplin 's statement as evidence that moscow was engaged in a `` crusaders ' war '' against muslims . 
  `` russia will be defeated , '' he pledged . 
  no , this is just how wto works . 
  sanctions are not allowed , so countries have to get creative . 
  what do you mean `` says '' ? 
  this is literally in the article , right above the tweet discussed here . 
   it 's kind of ` fuck you , russia ' thing .
