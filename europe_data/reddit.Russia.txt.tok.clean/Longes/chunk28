  it 's kind of `` we are broke and ca n't pay '' thing . 
  why ? 
  latvian ssr was doing pretty well in terms of industry . 
   this kind of short-term border violation can never be regarded as a pretext for a hostile attack [ president of turkey erdogan , 2012 ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/nato-condemns-downing-of-turkish-jet-by-syria/2012/06/26/gjqajzqs3v_story.html ), 
  except this logic is madness , especially when your airspace is right next to the active war zone . 
  i 'm pretty sure [ this explosion in the glasses bit ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/8/8a/command_and_conquer.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20070606013452 ) was animated somewhere . 
  bringing examples from 30 years ago is n't really relevant . 
  was n't this in the intro to the original command & conquer ? 
  if you send ten warning simultaneously , that means he ignored ten warnings , right ? 
  no need to dig into the details . 
  it 's a polandball joke . 
  also top kek - polish space achievements are thanks to the hated ussr . 
   who is the very reason this war spiraled out of control it 's not like anyone has trained and equipped the ` rebels ' , right ? 
  no external encouragement present . 
  none whatsoever . 
  because polan cant into space . 
  censorship is not the same as not being recognised as a religion . 
  thank god we patched up that giant hole in the constitution . 
  maybe if uk starts broadcasting gay porn into the ocean it 'll do like the swedish one and go away ? 
  without a context , i 'm utterly confused . 
  i read that as `` young ( french ) people who left to live/fight/help in syria '' , which lead me to understand the le pen 's version as `` we must understand ( forgive ) the young people who left for syria '' and actual version `` we must understand ( study ) the motives behind people leaving for syria '' . 
  neither of which seem to be bad and `` taubira 's resignation '' worthy . 
  what are they talking about ? 
  what does government have to do with this ? 
   along with argentina , ukraine , bolivia , andorra and israel , it has been deemed `` non-compliant '' by wada . 
   brazil , belgium , france , greece , mexico and spain have been placed on a ` watch list ' and must meet strict conditions by march 2016 or face similar action . 
   meanwhile , kenya has been ordered to explain its doping controls or join those countries under scrutiny . 
  estonian sounds slow to russian ear ( much like native english sounds super fast ) , which leads to many anecdotes where estonians are stereotyped as slow . 
  not stupid , just slow thinkers and talkers . 
   `` estonians love the tallinn zoo where they go on sundays to watch sloths frolic and zip across the trees . '', 
  north of moscow . 
  [ green and striped green areas on this map ] ( http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/images/maps/map12.gif ), 
  judging by the accent map i have , * muscovites * would actually say harasho . 
  but people a bit further up north would say horosho . 
  yup . 
  meanwhile akaniye is how belarussians pronounce it . 
  [ here 's a handy-dandy map ] ( http://www.gramota.ru/book/village/map12.html ) that shows a bit of the geographical accent spread . 
  green stands for okaniye , orange for akaniye , purple for some special variant of akaniye . 
  the biggest accent split in russian is between northern and southern russian . 
  in northern russian the okaniye vocalization is used . 
  moscow is pronounced as written - moskva , milk - moloko . 
  in southern russian akaniye vocalization is used , and the letter `` o '' is frequently pronounced as a - maskva , malako . 
  huh . 
  i actually commonly use a number of those , despite not being from odessa . 
   how come this is not the case with russian ? 
  mass immigration during the imperial and soviet time combined with soviet and modern widespread tv and internet connection have ` normalized ' the language around the country . 
  you can still get dialect oddities , but they are minor . 
  mahazyn would be southern russian , in rostov and krasnodar . 
  g is commonly pronounced as h in those parts . 
   there are no dialects in russian that 's actually not true . 
  it 's hard to notice the dialects because they only differ in few words here and there , but they exist , especially in rural areas . 
  for example , in my home region eggplants ( \u0431\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0436\u0430\u043d\u044b ) are commonly called '' \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0435 '' ( literally , `` blue '' as an adjective ) . 
  in terms of accents you are correct , the o vocalization is characteristic for northern accents , and a for southern . 
  i hope you reconsider . 
  for example , [ here 's sexton spelling `` consular '' in the us embassy 's blog ] ( http://embassy-voices.livejournal.com/72484.html ) . 
  and [ here 's state department saying berry is `` special envoy for the human rights of lgbt persons '' ] ( http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/02/237772.htm ) , rather than lgbti . 
  it 's strange to expect perfect grammar from politicians ( or people in general ) when president-level figures make mistakes all the time ( george bush , anyone ? 
  the `` debunking '' is kinda shit . 
  for example , [ here 's sexton spelling `` consular '' in the us embassy 's blog ] ( http://embassy-voices.livejournal.com/72484.html ) . 
  and [ here 's state department saying berry is `` special envoy for the human rights of lgbt persons '' ] ( http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2015/02/237772.htm ) , rather than lgbti . 
  lack of flawless orthography and punctuation is not a proof of fakeness , is what i 'm saying .

   but meddling into ukrainian affairs like described above is ok i must have missed that time when a democracy-promoting group in ukraine turned out to be secretly financed and controlled by russia . 
   but if we take the latest `` sunday evening with soloviev '' as an example well , that explains why you are so confused . 
  `` sunday night with vladimir solovyeov '' is a talk-show with * eight * politicians from different political parties . 
  of course you are going to get conflicting opinions . 
   violate religious freedoms of ukrainian citizens wat, 
  i 'm pretty sure russian officials were saying `` stop jumping to conclusions while we are doing the research '' .

   i wish i was taught even a little history from other countries in school skimping out on foreign history is a common thing everywhere  _ <, 
   clickbaity headline makes it sound like governments are funding is man , if only someone here knew english and was capable of reading a sentence to the end before jumping to conclusions . 
   putin : isis financed ** from ** 40 countries , including g20 members `` from 40 countries '' and `` by 40 countries '' are very different . 
  `` primary theory '' is no the same as `` we 've confirmed it '' . 
  there 's some ammount of butthurt going on in livejournal . 
  livejournal added french flag to the design after the paris attack , but did n't do the same after the plane 's bombing , or after terror attacks in arabic countries . 
  civilized white people are more important than unwashed eastern and southern barbarians , yo . 
   i really do n't know his point from the article :  putin also spoke of the urgent need to curb the illegal oil trade by is . 
   `` i 've shown our colleagues photos taken from space and from aircraft which clearly demonstrate the scale of the illegal trade in oil and petroleum products , '' he said . 
   `` the motorcade of refueling vehicles stretched for dozens of kilometers , so that from a height of 4,000 to 5,000 meters they stretch beyond the horizon , '' putin added , comparing the convoy to gas and oil pipeline systems . 
   it 's not the right time to try and figure out which country is more and which is less effective in the battle with islamic state , as now ** a united international effort is needed against the terrorist group , putin said . 
  well , shoigu has been fairly successful as an administrator so far . 
  i dunno , what caused the other armed conflicts between finland and ussr ? 
  as in latvian news portal ? 
  i feel that you are a glorious ukrainian internet warrior . 
  because if i take some reasonable internet resource , like [ gazeta.ru ] ( http://www.gazeta.ru/business/news/2015/11/12/n_7876115.shtml ) , then i see `` ministry of finance of us hopes that russia will rethink its position on ukrainian debt '' . 
  [ or interfax ] ( http://www.interfax.ru/business/478764 ) : `` ministry of finance of us asked russia to restructure ukrainian debt '' [ or lenta.ru ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2015/11/12/jack_lew/ ) : `` ministry of finance of us asked russia to rethink its position on ukrainian debt '', 
  the cassus beli for winter war was a shelling of a soviet guard post . 
  the background for the war is that leningrad is important and too close to finnish border to be safe , and that finland has had two military conflicts with the ussr ( initiated by finland ) in the past . 
   gross domestic product shrank 4.1 percent last quarter from a year earlier after decreasing 4.6 percent in the previous three months , the federal statistics service said thursday , citing preliminary data . 
  that was better than the median of 18 estimates in a bloomberg survey for a 4.4 percent contraction . 
   `` things are no longer getting worse , '' liza ermolenko , a london-based analyst at capital economics ltd. , said by phone before the release . 
  til : bloomberg and capital economics ltd. are russian officials . 
  is that why so many poles live and work outside of poland ? 
  because poland is too good for them ? 
  in russian history there 's a distinction between ww2 ( 1939-1945 ) and great patriotic war ( 1941-1945 ) . 
  the main amount of time is obviously dedicated to the latter and to the battles between ussr and germany .
