  from what i remember , the non-ussr events that are discussed are : reasons for ww2 , uk and france joining the war , us joining the war , general statistics on the losses . 
  i think . 
  i do n't really remember how much i got in school and how much absorbed from the internet . 
  absolutely . 
  but 5-10 years is more of a `` suddenly crisis '' than ussr 's fall or russian empire 's stagnation . 
  i highly recommend the excellent 2005 tv adaptation of the book . 
  [ subbed version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t6w9hkxv6g ), 
   and only putins friends benefit from it yeah , it 's not like living standards in russia greatly increased over the last 20 years . 
  noooooo . 
  what i 'm saying is that it 's not `` suddenly crisis '' as you paint it , with the exception of ww2 . 
  your opinion of `` 99 % russians '' is incredibly insulting . 
   do you think there 's a chance of russians booting him out ? 
  highly improbable . 
  it 's not about doctoring misinformation - putin 's actions are supported by the absolute majority of the population . 
   `` look how powerful tzarist russia is !! '', 
  until it got into multiple wars and was going down . 
  i do n't think anyone has ever claimed that nikolay ii 's reign was particularly great . 
   `` but hey , now look how powerful stalin is ! '', 
  - `` ooops half his cuntry just burned and almost collapsed under the german invasion . 
  good thing the americans sent all that land lease '' and then got much better . 
  but hey , what do i know , captain america won wwii by himself , right ? 
   `` but hey , now look how powerful the nuclear ussr is ! '', 
  again , stagnating ussr of the 80s is rarely called the pinacle of power . 
  it 's a friendly game between non-athletes , what kind of contest did you expect ?

  damn , you are right . 
  it 's been far too long since i 've seen brigada , and i associate all crime dramas with peterburg by default , 
  there are many tv adaptations , about five i think . 
  the one i linked is the latest ( and in my opinion , the best ) - from 2005 . 
  seventeen moments of spring . 
  [ eng sub on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zizoma9pyv8 ) an absolute classic , the black and white 12-episode drama about shtirlitz , a soviet spy in hitler 's germany . 
  brigada . 
  [ eng sub on daily motion ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xt78vy_brigada-2002-episode-01-subtitles-en-slo-bg_shortfilms ) another cult classic , this one is about rise and fall of four friends who form a criminal syndicate in 90s moscow . 
  master and margarita . 
  [ eng sub on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t6w9hkxv6g ) ecranisation of bulgakov 's book . 
  the plot alternates between two settings : moscow in the 1930s , where satan and his retinue arrive to hold a ball and cause mischief , and jerusalem , where pontius pilate talks with and judges jesus . 
  there is 2ch . ru/2chan . net/whatever it is called now which is a russian imageboard . 
  edit : what 's up with silent downvoting ? 
  anyone is upset by there being a russian imageboard ?

  i honestly do n't know . 
  i do n't like spending weeks on the beach , so i 've never actually been in egypt . 
  it 's much easier for you , since being part of schengen other eu citizens do n't need a visa to visit . 
  most of them . 
  in 2011 there were 2 million foreign tourists and 32 million internal tourists . 
  visas , language barrier , poor tourism infrastructure , and now politics , are creating barriers for tourism . 
  i have n't checked any records , but last summer two of my acquaintances who own small hotels in sochi and geledzhik were super happy , because they were full all the way into october . 
  for russians it 's because egypt is cheap , warm in autumn/spring , and you do n't need a visa to enter . 
  mind you , netherlands also exports twice as much dairy as it imports . 
  it 's most likely the difference between raw/processed produce , and some sort of eu economical weirdness . 
   russia imports most of its food this does n't mean `` russia imports more than exports '' , genius . 
  `` imports most of its food '' means that you import more than you produce . 
  no one denied that . 
  no one even said anything about russia being net importer or exporter . 
  you understand the difference between `` russia imports more than it exports '' and `` russia imports most of its food '' , right ? 
  i 've never claimed otherwise . 
  the only thing i said about exports is that russia is one of the largest grain exporters . 
   more than 75 % of russia 's potatoes are grown basically in people 's backyards and summer gardens . 
  russia last year imported more than 200 million euros worth of potatoes from egypt . 
  in 2011 russia imported 1.5 million tons of potatoes . 
  in 2013 it imported 443 thousand tons . 
  in 2013 30 million tons of potatoes were produced in russia , half of which are for food . 
  you 'll have to excuse me if i do n't consider 1.5 % of production to be meaningful import . 
  [ source ] ( http://ria.ru/economy/20140606/1010983952.html ) as of 2012 , russia is fourth in the world in total dairy imports , after germany , italy and netherlands . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.vlant-consult.ru/modules/download.php?aid=442 ) and [ source ] ( http://www.clal.it/en/?section=stat_russia ) . 
  that is not correct . 
  russia is a major grain exporter ( third place in the world , after us and eu ) . 
  in terms of other products , russia imports about 25 % of consumed sugar and meat , 20 % of dairy products . 
  it exports 25 % of produced oil , exports fish and has minimum export and import of potatoes . 
  people would still ( and are already ) support the action in syria . 
  isis is seen as a threat , especially because of unstable muslim region of chechnya . 
  isis is already publishing journals in russian , so their terrorist attack would be seen not as a response , but as a continuation of the isis attack on russia . 
  but it has an incentive to hide it ?

  heavily depends on the city in which you are , but outside of moscow you can get a decent soup + main course + dessert for about 4 $ . 
   apply some critique that you put on usa for killing 5000 civilians on soviet union , who killed hundreds of thousands . 
  i 'm sorry , but what critique you are talking about ? 
  when you say `` invaded '' , i assume you mean `` was invited by the government '' , no ?

  false alarm , nothing is being cancelled . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.interfax.ru/culture/476411 )  because of the recieved letter the public chamber of the region has made an unplanned meeting , on which the director of the drama theater michail matveev has told , that the tour of the foreign theater is organised for the russian-finish cultural forum . 
  for this play there is an age requirement , and viewers are free to decide if they want to see the play . 
  the minister of culture of the republic , anastasia prokudina , has mentioned that the theater is independent in its choice of art styles , repertoire , and publication of any advertisements and materials that do n't break the law . 
  [ moscow state university is still denying this rumor ] ( http://www.interfax.ru/russia/474684 ) . 
  it 's a complicated question , and the answer is pretty much `` car lobby '' . 
  driving a car is a prestige thing , and marketing department works really hard to make sure you do n't forget that the stinky public transportation users are the inferior race . 
   the parties will progressively establish a free trade area over a transitional period of a maximum of 10 years starting from the entry into force of the agreement . 
  yes , yes it does . 
  at this point ukraine loses the free trade with russia , because russia does n't want tax-free eu goods flooding its markets . 
  which products of ukrainian industry do you consider to be good enough to compete with eu-made goods on eu-markets ? 
   to the point where he reneged on his overtures to his people about seeking closer ties with the eu you kind of forgot to mention how the proposed eu treaty was incredibly shitty for ukrainian economy . 
   you really should look at some of the other crazy shit they 've done like their new law to force universities to submit their findings to government security services prior to publicly releasing them on the web .
