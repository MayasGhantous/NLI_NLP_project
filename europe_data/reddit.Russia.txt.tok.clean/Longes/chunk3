  ukraine is a word meaning `` borderland '' and thus refers to the actual region that the country is on rather than to the corporate entity of the country itself . 
  so properly speaking , in english it has a `` the '' . 
  ukrainian nationalists get their jimmies ruffled when they see `` the '' is added for a large number of reasons . 
  that is wrong , and the people who flip their shit about putting a definite article on the ukraine are blowing smoke . 
  it fits the english usage pattern of a country that gets a definite article , so it gets a definite article . 
  there is no shame attached to countries getting a definite article in english , or the united states and the united kingdom probably would have done something about it long ago . 
  remember , it 's `` the united kingdom '' , but there is no `` the '' in `` great britain '' . 
  and there 's always going to be a `` the '' in `` the ukraine '' . 
  i must have missed all the communist terrorist activity that happened in the last fifteen years . 
   first the kremlin reneged on its promises le sigh . 
  kremlin promised nothing in minsk 2 , because kremlin claimed and keeps claiming that there are no russian soldiers in ukraine . 
  by the author 's logic every mention of `` mr. poroshenko '' should be replaced with `` merkel and hollande '' . 
  * unidentified putin riding disguised medvedev , ftfy, 
  they are protesting against the unidentified vandals illegaly breaking an art piece . 
  so bravery . 
  much protest . 
  wow . 
  it 's not like all world economies are suffering right now . 
  no siree . 
   putin literally did n't manage to achieve anything beyond trickle-down economics that 's a bizarre statement . 
  russian economy has been steadily getting better in the last twenty years . 
  the importance of oil export in the state budget was going down , not up . 
  state budget itself grew 14 times , and the state has virtually no foreign debt . 
  the moscow times is cancer . 
  a lying , truth-twisting cancer . 
  and people say russian government does nothing to fight corruption . 
   condom ban : [ let 's use the original article , shall we ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russian-health-officials-comment-on-proposed-condom-ban/527010.html ) ? 
  the one that lacks any kind of information they added in the later articles . 
  the problem is them constantly lying and twisting information for the purposes of propaganda . 
  the condom ` ban ' is a recent example ( actually a proposed import restriction for the medical clinics ) . 
  or ban of beevor 's history books ( actually removal of soros ' fund history books from the school library ) . 
  the only sources are . ua and themoscowtimes . 
  seems legit . 
  despite what you may have been told , russia is n't actually full of raving homicidal xenophobic barbarians . 
  it 's highly unlikely that you being an american would somehow influence your tourist life . 
  that seems doubtful . 
  [ experts promise the continuing fall of the number of us shale rigs ] ( http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/drilling/#tabs-summary-2 ), 
  did you even read the links i posted ? 
  ukraine did fucking stopped providing services . 
  it stopped providing electricity two months after the referendum . 
  well couple of years ago crimea was still part of ukraine , so i do n't know what you are rambling on about here . 
  i could n't find anything that would support that claim , though maybe i did n't search that hard . 
  water was cut off two months after the referendum . 
   crimea alone is useless for him when electricity and water goes from ukraine . 
  you are aware that ukraine cut off [ electricity ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-cuts-power-train-services-to-crimea-1419605074 ) and [ water ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/ukraine-cuts-off-water-supply-to-crimea/5381277 ) a year ago . 
   he attracted widespread attention earlier this week for an appearance on rbk , but the analyst for the rikom group gave more detailed answers to the ura.ru news agency . 
  if he is even partially correct , russia faces not a `` black monday '' or a `` black september '' but a `` black '' and bleak future . 
  it 's rather hard to trust zhukovskiy , when [ on rbk he says ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfdot1n2qd8 ) that russia 's budget is made with an assumption of 3600 rubles for a barrel , and will suffer from the actual price of 3250 . 
  while in reality [ russia 's budget is made with an assumption of 3075 rubles for a barrel ] ( http://quote.rbc.ru/topnews/2015/04/10/34346341.html ) . 
  sure . 
  i assume the fragments will be studied , and results will eventually be published . 
  and then we can talk about europe doing/not doing something . 
  but why are we talking about it now ? 
  in response to what ? 
  rocket bits being found ? 
  i imagine europe will continue the investigation and eventually publish an official report which can be used as a basis for doing something . 
  what part of `` consumer use of condoms is not banned or restricted '' do you not understand ? 
  it 's a really hard scientific question , and saying `` reasonable '' is an exaggeration on my part . 
  `` commonly used by everyone '' would be a better choice of words . 
  modern liberal economists argue that protectionism is bad , but then again modern liberal economists argued that greek crisis is literally impossible , and look where that got us . 
  [ you can see that pretty much every country that is n't africa is employing protectionist measures ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/protectionist_measures_taken_2008%e2%80%932013_according_to_global_trade_alert.png ) . 
  yes yes , onishenko is an idiot for saying that , * and also for not reading the material before making comments * . 
   but its still a ridiculous ban . 
  it 's really not . 
  protectionism is a reasonable policy , and this particular restriction does n't majorly affect the russian population . 
  it 's for medical clinics . 
  you yourself can buy whatever you want . 
  this is a continuation of the broken phone antics . 
  the consumer use condoms are neither banned nor restricted . 
  import of condoms ( and many other medical items ) for medical clinics is restricted . 
  so for example the ultrasound tests will be using localy made condoms . 
  and those producers would be willing to invite ukrainians to the market to crash their profits ? 
  i 'd imagine existing eu farmers would have a few words to say about that . 
  what can i say , russia has to bring balance to the force . 
  it is our destiny . 
  edit : it 's a star wars joke . 
  no no no , you have to do it right , with the capital hard sign !, 
  from personal experience , the vast majority of the russian speakers in uk are actually kazakhs . 
  most likely a bid for mutual support . 
  hollande 's balls are in a vice , since [ india 's rafale deal is dead ] ( http://thediplomat.com/2015/08/confirmed-indias-mother-of-all-defense-deals-is-dead/ ) , and mistrals are a disappointment and ongoing drain on resources . 
  and russia needs all the friends it can get . 
  the message on kremlin.ru also says that negotiations were `` in a traditionally friendly for russo-french negotiations tone '', 
  http://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/fao-provide-livestock-fodder-risk-farms-eastern-ukraine-enruuk this is probably what he 's talking about . 
  edit : why am i being downvoted ? 
  already posted, 
  synopsis : on august 5th putin and holande had a phone call and came to a decision regarding the mistrals . 
  after expert negotiations a compromise was reached regarding the refund of russian investment into mistrals and return of russian equipment . 
  france has already transfered the money and will have full ownership of the ships as soon as it returns the equipment . 
  did they manage to save the tiger from the alcohol poisoning caused by proximity of depardieu ? 
  probably . 
  it 's sad , this kind of hatemongering helps no one . 
  it 's not . 
  there are reason as to why destruction of smuggled food is an [ international ] ( http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/horse-meat-scandal-48-tons-1715395 ) [ practice ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/smuggled-frozen-meat-worth-almost-half-billion-dollars-seized-china-some-it-40-years-1981095 ) . 
  keeping smuggled food with a purpose of redistributing it later invites corruption like nothing else . 
  there are n't a lot of statues of stalin . 
   political theorist well , i 'm not quite sure , but i 've heard that lenin had some other accomplishments . 
  someone has far too much free time . 
  no , that 's `` and you are also doing it '' . 
  `` are you linching negroes '' would be if i pointed out nsa spying , or something else unrelated . 
  ok , so your point of view is that every book should be free and equally accessible in a school library , from the hubbard 's dianetics to mein kampf to catcher in the rye , is that correct ?
