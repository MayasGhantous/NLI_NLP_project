  guess what libraries do . 
  as a director of a state funded library , sharina is generally expected to follow the laws , and not distribute books that are considered to promote national hatred . 
  to further put this in perspective : in american mcdonalds a big mac costs 4 $ . 
  in russian mcdonalds it costs 110 rubles - 1.7 $ . 
  personally , i think abdullaev has intentionally created a very `` we are being oppressed '' sounding misunderstanding and then ` clarified ' it . 
  [ link to the full interview given to tass ] ( http://tass.ru/en/sport/832283 ), 
  except this has nothing to do with the grip of the state :  update : in comments to meduza , abdullaev clarified that the moscow times ' new owner has never interfered with the paper 's content policy and has pledged never to do so in the future . 
  `` my contradictions with him [ kudryavtsev ] , '' abdullaev says , `` are about the division of administrative powers over the editorial office , not about the content policies . '', 
   moscow times  untainted news sources about russia are we talking about the same the moscow times here ? 
  eh , i can believe it . 
  being dead also reduces your dependency on air and all that . 
  is looking for a job a valid reason to get an asylum ? 
  i 'm having a bit of trouble believing that almost 100k people applied for asylum from russia to europe . 
  that 's ... not true at all . 
  we need an entrance visa to enter the countries that do n't have a visa-less regime with russia . 
  there 's a grand total of 100 countries that russians can enter without a visa - like egypt , brazil or argentina . 
  the only ex-ussr country that still has exit visas is uzbekistan . 
  edit : ok , sorry , i read your message incorrectly . 
  you are talking about foreigners requering visa to leave the country , which is a completely different beast . 
  yes , your russian visa is both entrance and exit . 
  that 's how modern visas work everywhere . 
  if i were to overstay my visa period in a shengen country , i could be imprisoned and prevented from leaving the country until a new visa is made or until the police procedure is finished . 
  that 's just how visas work . 
   russian government can deny permission for scientists to leave the country . 
  source please ? 
  unless they are working for the military , i 've never heard about any such rule . 
   this is just the newest development in russia . 
  good thing it did n't happen , as [ msu denies the claim ] ( http://www.interfax.ru/russia/474684 ) . 
  `` i support freedom of speech , but only if you are saying the things i approved ! '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_the_great https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catherine_the_great, 
   i thought that initially there was a lot of skepticism there was . 
  but things change . 
  most people are against isis and , thanks to chechnya being part of russia , see it as a legitimate threat to the country . 
  plus the ` adventure ' has been highly successful so far , so there 's that . 
   man got 2 years of probation for reposting a pro-maidan message http://grani.ru/people/2310/ the pro-maidan message that says ( not the full text ) `` fight against the chekist regime of putin !, 
  make guerrila squads !, 
  destroy military infrastructure ! '', 
  i 'm not a linguist , but i feel like this is a call to extremism . 
  really ? 
  because i 'd have to start with peter i and catherine ii as great russian leaders . 
  i 'm afraid i have no information on internal workings and financial structure of rt america , so i ca n't comment on that . 
  this is an update to an old law , which allowed 50 % ownership . 
  for reference , 20-25 % foreign ownership laws function in us , canada and spain . 
  much crackdown . 
  so oppressive . 
  wow . 
   i could agree with that but for now foreign media is what is targeted in russia . 
  foreign media is not targeted in russia . 
  political organisations funded by foreign countries are the ones that get the `` foreign agent '' tag . 
   in 2012 , russia introduced a law that labels all non-governmental and non-profit organizations that receive funding from abroad `` foreign agents '' , meaning that they are subjected to vigorous state control and extensive audits . 
  in addition , they have to start their every publication and statement with a disclosure that it is being given by a `` foreign agent '' . 
  so , how exactly is this related to the organizations closing down ? 
  which organizations closed down ? 
  why do n't they want to go through audits ?

  [ link to the full report ] ( http://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=ukr&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=550&amp;page=1 ), 
  the article is from february 2014 . 
  yanukovich was still in power . 
   but my father told me that it was almost impossible to see drunk people he 's probably right . 
  alcohol consumption in the ussr was lower . 
  nothing , most likely . 
  trump is a populist , not a homicidal maniac . 
  he just says stupid shit , rather than do it . 
  sweet . 
   studying in university was free . 
   medicine was much better and free . 
  wait , it 's not free in the ukraine right now ? 
   people have n't drinking much like now in russia . 
  alcohol consumption statistics are actually very interesting . 
  [ here are the statistics for russia from 1970 to 2010 ] ( http://ruxpert.ru/images/e/e0/%d0%9f%d0%be%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b1%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b5_%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%be%d0%bb%d1%8f_%d0%b2_%d0%a0%d0%be%d1%81%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%b8_%d0%92%d0%9e%d0%97.png ) . 
  white is spirits , red is wine , yellow is beer . 
  you can see the sharp spike in the 90s . 
  after trailing the [ who website ] ( http://data.euro.who.int/hfadb/shell_en.html ) we can see that alcohol consumption in europe actually averages to roughly the same numbers ( ~ 10 liters per person per year ) , which makes me think that it 's mostly linked to wealth and availability , rather than to any cultural factors . 
  i must have missed the referendum in sudentenland . 
  but it 's interesting to see that you are not a democrat and reject the right of people for democratic self-determination . 
   oh fucking please . 
  he was made `` prime minister '' just because constitutionally he could n't serve a 3rd consecutive term as president , and so he put a puppet to keep his seat warm for him , while at the same time extending the term limits for presidency from 4 to 6 years . 
  who are you even attempting to kid that putin was n't the leader of russia and holding the strings all the time throughout ? 
  gasp , putin follows the constitutional procedure of the country and leaves the chair , rather than do some horrible tyranical thing and change the constitution !, 
  how dares he !, 
   ah , the ol' `` we invaded ukraine defensively '' apologist implication . 
  please put the goalpost back where it belongs . 
  the point of the discussion is `` did us say bad things about russia and called it a major threat ? '' . 
  the answer is yes , as multiple citations have proven . 
   putin forced the return of russian-speaking lands under his control , even if he had to destroy neighboring countries in order to do it , under the claim of `` self-determination '' . 
  so i take it you consider the crimean referendum and all the following polls showing that crimeans are mostly happy with being part of russia to be a fabrication by the russian government . 
   whether president or prime minister his position as leader of the russians is the same that is a lie , and i hope you have something to back it up with . 
   but hey if he 's not the successor of hitler you should explain to me why the neonazis love him so much . 
  i ca n't explain that , because russian nationalists are mostly angry at putin for not sending the army into the ukraine . 
  glory to arstotzka !, 
   soviet occupation was actually a good thing for the countries it touched . 
  i 'm not sure where you get this from . 
  putin is a universally supported president who won the elections multiple times because russians support him . 
  yes , clearly we should extrapolate from this that he 's a bloodthirsty tyrant that will only stop being a president when he 's dead . 
  yah , there are definitely no terrorist scares and red scares and russia scares in the us . 
  before that kissinger was [ merely talking how putin sees the events in the ukraine as a model of what `` we ( us ) want to do in russia '' ] ( https://russian.rt.com/inotv/2014-02-02/kissindzher-russkie-ne-mogut-bezrazlichno ) .
