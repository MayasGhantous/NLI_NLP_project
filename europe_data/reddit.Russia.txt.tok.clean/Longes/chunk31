  i should clarify : in the unified state examination on math which you pass at the end of your school there are three parts : * a - multiple choice test . 
  * b - problems where you only need to write the answer . 
  * c - a few ( three ? ), 
  complex problems where you need to write the full solution and make a drawing for the geometry problem . 
  a is the easiest , c is the hardest .

  if it was a live stream , then you are suggesting that the rt administration knew exactly what was going to be said and cut the video . 
  how would they know the exact moment when to cut it ? 
  because ` award ' could be a nice name for a bribe to get information and/or sabotage something . 
  spoiler alert : rt is freely available on the internet and is designed for foreign consumer , not russians . 
  because unless there 's a ridiculous discount , it would be silly for russia to accept such a deal , since france has already proven itself to be unreliable . 
  so german rt stream loses the feed while every other rt stream works fine . 
  why do you assume censorship ? 
  clearly this is a clever ploy to keep the german viewers of russia today ignorant . 
  everyone else in the world who watches rt ? 
  it 's okay , they can watch .

  your ability to miss the forest for the trees amazes me . 
  it is irrelevant , because the statement `` country a kidnaps children from country b to improve country a demographics '' is not disproven by country b having poor demographics . 
  it does n't matter if the country b has poor , average or amazing birthrate , so long as there are children for country a to kidnap . 
  it 's a fallacy . 
  i do n't know where the lgbt couples came from . 
  the original sources i provided in the thread do n't mention lgbt at all . 
   russians have used the birthrate in europe to show the decadence and decline of the west , while russia itself suffers from the same dynamic . 
  that 's not true at all . 
  our demographical problems are an acknowledge fact , but the situtation is actually getting better . 
  you yourself cited the source that shows this .

  ` russian media ' ( i should really start quoting zerohedge and saying `` american media says ___ '' ) [ says ] ( http://rusnovosti.ru/posts/389061 ) that finnish government is abusing the juvenile code to take children out of the immigrant families .

  [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johan_b%c3%a4ckman ) says [ that finland is indeed rather fond of taking children from russian immigrants ] ( http://rbth.com/news/2015/03/09/child_seized_from_russian_mother_in_finland_44337.html ) . 
  i do n't have enough information to say if he 's lying or not . 
  irrelevant . 
  that 's still a rather low birth rate , and in both sweden and finland there 's a negative dynamic . 
  if the ` kidnapping ' is really happening to boost the demographic , then you do n't really care about the birth rate in the country of origin - you just care about getting the children . 
  before people start screaming about insane russian propaganda , here 's the actual story . 
  according to johan backman , a finnish human rights activists , children of russian immigrants are being semi-legally seized by the finnish state . 
  [ here 's an english language article from march 2015 ] ( http://rbth.com/news/2015/03/09/child_seized_from_russian_mother_in_finland_44337.html ) . 
  [ 5 days ago , on 27.09 he reported that a child has been siezed from lubov semenova ] ( http://lifenews.ru/news/162403 ) . 
  [ maria yarmush , a juvenile justice specialist and a lawyer , spoke in the interview that she believes that finnish government siezes children to bump up the demographics reduced by the population getting old ] ( http://rusnovosti.ru/posts/389061 ) . 
  she advised people to avoid traveling to finland , sweden , and norway with children . 
  she does n't even mention lgbt . 
  so cut the `` russian media '' and `` government controlled '' bullshit . 
  a single lawyer had this opinion in an interview to a radio station . 
  and it 's based on actual cases of children of russian immigrants being taken by the finnish state . 
  edit : [ if anyone cares , the child has been given back ] ( http://riafan.ru/424055-izyatuyu-iz-rossiyskoy-semi-vlastyami-finlyandii-devochku-vernuli-roditelyam/ ) . 
  no , it 's a response to ukraine banning russian flights . 
  it also happened about two days ago .

  but since 2007 he is 100 % supported by the united russia . 
  to the point where he was the party chairman in between the presidential terms .

  we have 77 parties total . 
  the largest ones are : * united russia . 
  head - dmitriy medved ( current pm , previous president ) . 
  currently rulling party . 
  * communist party of russian federation . 
  head - zuganov . 
  second largest party . 
  * liberal-democratic party of russia . 
  zhirinovskiy is a crazy populist/nationalist who said he wants to bring back the monarchy .
