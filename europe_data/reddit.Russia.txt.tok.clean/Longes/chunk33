  ria novosti mediaholding has n't existed for 2 years now . 
   man who was really preparing a coup to oust the elected consul by this definition ? 
  quite a few . 
  navalny , for example . 
  well it 's a good thing that rt is not a state tv then , is it ? 
  it 's not owned by kremlin , it 's financed by kremlin . 
  in this case the problem is not that levada recieved foreign funding ( it did ) , but that levada 's director was giving lectures where he calls russian government a corrupt mafia . 
  as such instead of being considered an impartial observer , levada became a political actor . 
  which , combined with foreign funding , made it a foreign agent . 
  if levada was doing only one of those things - it would n't be a foreign agent . 
  no , [ they got busted for making opinion pieces ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/politics/06/09/2016/57ceaf969a79473d2c782a3d ) . 
  specifically , because gudkov gave lectures where he called russian government a corrupt mafia . 
  this moved levada from being an unbiased observer to a political actor . 
  which is exactly why putin 's name is n't even mentioned in neither this article nor any of the russian articles on topic . 
  this is seriously more about japan and dispute over kuril islands than it is about putin or america . 
  the world does n't end with reddit . 
  i mean come on , read the article . 
   muravsky has adamantly defended the image of the troops running from the explosion despite it being the subject of an [ open letter by ukrainian photojournalists ] ( http://blogs.lb.ua/lbua/343305_zayava_ukrainskih_fotozhurnalistiv.html ) that called it a `` clumsy '' attempt at information warfare and a ukrainian soldier familiar with the incident said the photo was `` staged '' and that the troops involved had been coerced to defend muravsky 's account by higher-ups . 
  well then you clearly did n't read the article submitted because everything i mentioned was from the article . 
   defense agency has received a lot of his high quality and artistic design photos that were never considered by the ministry as documentary or real war photos you do realise that this is a quote from the ministry of defense * after * they sacked muravsky ? 
  this is them covering their asses . 
  [ business insider ] ( http://www.businessinsider.de/front-lines-ukraine-2016-8?r=us&amp;ir=t ) clearly thought that the images are real . 
  [ geoff pyatt ] ( https://twitter.com/geoffpyatt/status/765882832854089728 ) clearly was presenting them as real . 
  except that of course muravsky is lying and [ shyrokne was not shelled on june 4 ] ( https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2016/08/screen-shot-2016-08-26-at-12.51.42-1024x550.png&amp;w=1484 ) . 
  he is deliberately spreading misinformation to push an agenda . 
  if your job is to lie to people and you are revealed to be a liar - losing your job is the logical consequence . 
   i do n't really understand what 's wrong in staging photos , unless they are clearly labeled as non-staged . 
  let 's use one of the world 's best known conspiracy theory examples - apollo 11 . 
  if there a difference between `` apollo photos are staged - there was no moon landing '' and `` apollo photos are not staged - there was a moon landing '' ? 
  that 's a lovely whataboutism you got there . 
  wait what ? 
  nationalism needs to rise ? 
  * nationalism * ? 
   garry kasparov 's blog you remember how on a conference in washington kasparov called for `` democratic bombing '' of russia , a la yugoslavia ? 
  yes , we do know what democracy is . 
  we have a democratically elected president , mate . 
  in russian , [ yes ] ( https://cont.ws/post/196030 ) . 
  in 2000 , a month after becoming a president putin said that russia may join nato at some point . 
  according to the polls 30 % approved the statement , 51 % disapproved . 
   he then charted an independent course from his sponsors . 
  early on putin actually talked about the possibility of russia joining nato . 
  the reaction was his lowest popularity rating ever . 
   nothing older than yesterday popped up according to gazmanov the list is secret , and the only way to learn is to be stopped by a border guard . 
  this circlejerk is amazing . 
   they should know that they are in persona non grata list gazmanov claims that no , he did not know about any such list . 
  what does `` right thing '' mean ? 
  i trust putin will do the right thing for russia , but is that good or bad for europe ( the answer is : it varies ) . 
  would putin do the right thing for europe ? 
  i do n't know . 
  and even then - what * is * the right thing for europe ? 
  there is no unified european goal for which all countries strive . 
  some people will say that yeah , putin is killing brown people in the east so he 's totally doing the right thing for europe . 
  some people will say that dude , putin is n't killing anywhere near as many brown people as he should - we need a stronger leader than putin . 
  some people will say that no , putin is killing too many brown people - we need a softer leader than putin . 
  the question in the poll is ridiculously vague . 
  putin 's agents in the ukrainian government , that 's who . 
  so your response to pew and gallup polls is a sarcastic north korea comparison . 
  so because of that ukrainian athletes who are photographed with russian athletes should be called national traitors by ukrainians ? 
  what ? 
  it 's being reposted everywhere because of the absolutely insane reaction from the ukrainian public and politicians . 
  when some ukrainian athletes expressed concern over russian athletes removed from the olympics , [ ukrainian minister of sport ] ( http://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news/27901722.html ) said that russian propagandists tricked the athletes and that ukrainian athletes should avoid all contact with russian media . 
  when this photo came up , the facebook response were accusations of ukrainian athletes being national traitors . 
  the state officials talked about stripping funding from the athletes . 
   there is already war between russia and ukraine so , when is ukrainian government going to officially state it ? 
   putin is an alpha male type you do realise that russian government and ministry of external affairs have people other than putin working on external politics ? 
  well , maybe you 'd know if you actually read what russian media says , instead of just building strawmen in your head . 
  turkey backing isis is a fairly minor thing in russian internal politics . 
  the big anti-turkey pr point was downing the jet . 
  but [ erdogan apologised for that ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36689801 ) ( sort of , maybe ) , so the government can work on restoring the relationships and keep the face . 
  right , but that does n't show how cheap or expensive the bridge is . 
  if i say that an apple costs 5 $ and an orange costs 50 $ - are these expensive oranges ? 
  cheap oranges ? 
  i do n't know , the comparison gives no information that would allow me to make such judgement . 
   however , the latter would connect more people and wealthier regions for a smaller price tag . 
  so what , russia should have just left crimea connected only by barges and focused on wealthy regions ? 
  well , that 's an apples to oranges comparison . 
  why not count the number of hamburgers you could buy with that money ? 
  or the number of submarines ? 
  unlikely . 
  in this particular situation no flexibility of conscience is required . 
  [ erdogan apologised ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36689801 ) ( sorta , maybe ) , so russia shows forgiveness and generocity and starts restoring the ties beneficial to both countries . 
  well , it 's lying in this very article for example . 
  rfe :  nonetheless , kremlin auditors estimated in june 2015 that two-thirds of the money allocated for the bridge over the preceding year was unaccounted for . 
  what appears to be the source ( [ bloomberg ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-24/crimea-is-now-putin-s-problem-child ) )  and kremlin auditors reported in june that two-thirds of the money moscow sent crimea last year for road building could n't be accounted for . 
  not the money allocated for the bridge - money sent to crimea for road building . 
  i 'm afraid the unsourced statement of anonimous auditors printed by radio freedom is n't good enough for me . 
  now , i googled a bit , and here 's what i found ... [ bloomberg , 2015 ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-24/crimea-is-now-putin-s-problem-child )  and kremlin auditors reported in june that two-thirds of the money moscow * sent crimea last year for road building * could n't be accounted for . 
  money sent to crimea to build roads in crimea . 
  not the bridge . 
  roads in crimea . 
  and guess what , many of crimean government workers are now under investigation for corruption . 
  it 's almost like someone is trying to fix the problem ... 
  i 'll leave it for you to decide if radio freedom author merely could n't read the original article properly , or if he is trying to push an agenda by lying . 
  [ on the positive side ( ru ) ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/business/19/02/2016/56c6f7549a7947ee2032cf90?from=main ) : the overall bridge building expenses in 2015 were slightly below the planned expenses . 
  when it 's expensive , it 's because russian government is stealing the money . 
  when it 's cheap , it 's because everything is cheap in russia and russian government is still stealing all the money . 
  some people can never be pleased , i guess . 
  bay bridge . 
  $ 6.4 billion . 
  great belt east bridge .
