  no , bolsheviks being funded by germany and \u00d6sterreich to crush the russian empire is an actual theory with reasonable amount of evidence . 
  however there is a lot of arguing over details . 
  some say that lenin was a straight up puppet for the foreign governments , some say that he recieved funding while fighting the empire and then went his own way . 
  so it has been the fourth reich all along . 
  extra context for those wondering : this table on one regional channel is literally the only place where this data appeared . 
   instead of risking to confuse the audience on subjects they may be less than familiar with riiiiiiiiiight ... 
  just so we are clear - the case against urlashov began in 2013 . 
  proving that someone is corrupt is a slow work . 
  what do you call the munich betrayal ? 
  everyone allied with nazis at one point or another . 
  do note that the newspaper does n't mention any sources . 
  are we looking at the same poll here ? 
  they 'd rather live in germany than in russia , and they 'd rather live in russia than any other country on the list . 
  errr ... what ? 
  did you expect them to pick russia multiple times or something ? 
  except he is a liar . 
  vast majority of people on that list were `` provisional '' because they were asigned governors before the institution of governor elections , and changed their status until the elections could happen . 
   kind of like kadyrov did recently ( resign , and be provisionally reappointed by putin ) now you are just making false equialency and lie . 
  not only kadyrov did not resign , ~ ~ but he also has n't been reappointed . ~ ~ correction . 
  kadyrov has been reappointed until the elections in september 2016 due to the duration of his term running out in march 2016 . 
  this has nothing to do with the article you posted though , and kadyrov 's ` resignation ' ( which did n't happen ) . 
  the correct title would be `` putin makes head of fsb of kaliningrad region provisionary governor of kaliningrad region '' . 
  but that 's much less sensationalist . 
  up until 2012 governors were asigned and not elected . 
  as such anyone who is provisional around 2012 has `` provisional '' due to holding the post in the past . 
  yes . 
  he has as much power as a real governor had . 
  here 's what happened : governor of kaliningrad region is elected for five years , and no more than two consecutive terms . 
  from 2010 to 2016 the governor was tzukanov . 
  in 2016 tzukanov was dismissed from his duty as a governor by presidential decree , and asigned the position of presidential representative in kaliningrad region . 
  since region needs a governor until the elections next year , zinichev has been given the temporary position , most likely because he was head of fsb of kaliningrad region since 2015 . 
  in 2017 elections will happen , and zinichev will either go back to being head of fsb , or become a full governor . 
  zinichev is not a governor though . 
  he is appointed as a temporary governor until the elections next year . 
  misleading title . 
  zinichev is assigned as a temporary governor of the region until the elections . 
  is there a reason to believe that a man who was head of fsb of kaliningrad region will be a particularly bad temporary governor ? 
  nevermind , i misread his message . 
  if you want people to take you seriously , you should show a comparably protected hard drive used by us ( or any other ) military and its price .

  i said that military has a reason not to use wireless all the time , and i stand by it . 
  i never said that no military device ever uses wireless connections . 
   still much cheaper than upgrade of the whole system where it is used ~ ~ i take it you made the cost analysis and are ready to wow us with results ? ~ ~ edit : nevermind , i misread the message .

   considered kievan rus was settled by rurik 's vikings this is so wrong i do n't even know where to start, 
   the slavs have defeated us . 
  they have smashed our land , our nation , our ideology ...  this signifies them are an aryan race and they will force this world in the knees ... 
  this quote , whether it is real or not , is the cornerstone of russian nazism . 
  well , that , and the hatred of brown people . 
  russian nazis generally cherry-pick bits and pieces of nazi theories and hitler 's speeches ( and alleged words ) to prove that slavs have been the aryan master race all along . 
   i forgot sakhalin russian stealth technology . 
  so stronk . 
  much invisible . 
   no , the average quality and price of cheese on shelves was acceptable until imports were banned oh bullshit . 
  people and tv were complaining about palm oils and crap since the early 2000s . 
  and again , are you seriously suggesting that the government is * forcing * cheese producers to make low quality products ? 
  because i 'm pretty sure they do it on their own , taking advantage of the crappy standards provided by the government . 
  of course not . 
  terrible quality control has been around long before 2014 . 
   people tolerate anything the ** state imposes ** , that reduces their quality of life . 
  if you were to actually read the article , you 'd see the following :  food producers were now required only to declare that their food met quality standards . 
  they , together with retailers , were responsible for quality . 
  the state limited itself to checking each manufacturer once every three years -- and undertook to give prior warning before arriving , unless an official complaint was received . 
   `` it was a victory for businesses that lobbied for less state control , '' says alexei alexeyenko , assistant to the head of russia 's federal service for veterinary and phytosanitary surveillance , rosselkhoznadzor . 
   moldova has also been `` negotiating '' with russia for 23 years to pull its troops out of transnistria , it made several promises but never kept them . 
  enlighten me , what promises would those be ? 
  ( i genuinely do n't know , this is a serious question ), 
   but neither kiev nor the insurgents have followed the steps agreed upon in a february 2015 truce deal negotiated with the help of germany and france . 
   monitors from the organization for security and co-operation in europe ( osce ) report that neither side has withdrawn its heaviest weapons from the front line -- one of the first points of the pact . 
   the heaviest clashes have come along the 30-kilometre-wide ( 19-mile-wide ) buffer zone the sides agreed to set up during last year 's peace negotiations in the belarussian capital minsk . 
  as you can see ukraine does n't feel much like negotiating either . 
  you realise that protecting south ossetia against georgian aggression was the purpose of those peacekeepers , and that georgia agreed for them to be there ? 
   russo-georgian war in 2008 [ you mean the war georgia started ?
