   by not voting never said anything about not voting . 
  imho , voting `` against all '' or not voting at all is political immaturity . 
   look at the brexit vote - young people in the uk were overwhelmingly in favor of remaining . 
  but they did n't get out the vote [ neither of these is true . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/09/young-people-referendum-turnout-brexit-twice-as-high ), 
  another factor is a scale of influence . 
  i , personally , believe that my vote matters . 
  but it 's one vote out of 143.5 million . 
  the influence i have over the country is negligible . 
  i could expand it by joining a political party or starting my own political party , in which case i would be able to influence more affairs in russia . 
  20 % feel like they ca n't influence what happens in their work environment and 23 % feel the same towards their district . 
  i 'm curious to see similar polls for other countries . 
  the article makes no attempt to clarify that it is only track and field team that is banned , nor does it bother to mention that there are 440 athletes participating most of whom are n't in the track and field . 
  so i can only assume that the author is intentionally obfuscating the truth . 
  they disqualified the track and field team . 
  that 's 136 athletes out of 440 russian athletes total . 
  north korea is a model modern government . 
  it 's amazing how people support russian laws against foreign funding of political organisations , but refuse to admit it . 
  that you tried to lie about russian media and failed horribly . 
  but / u/hrulj is trying to make a statement about evil russian propaganda , which does n't really work when the source are uk tabloids . 
  also admiral kuznetsov is literally russia 's largest warship , so the first part of the sun title is n't even a metaphor or overstatement or anything . 
  one photo hardly makes a trend .

   i read several articles . 
  the picture they chose to use for the meeting was telling enough about neutrality of it . 
  i also read several articles .

   even putin 's handshake is designed to make the other come and reach out to him , rather than other way around . 
  not seeing it : [ 1 ] ( https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_908w/2010-2019/wires/images/2014-11-13/ap/fifa_wcup_bids_investigation-0f44b.jpg&amp;w=1484 ) , [ 2 ] ( http://retired.talkingpointsmemo.com/images/obama-putin-handshake-3.jpg ) . 
  you are lying . 
  in ukraine 's defense , right sector are effectively rogue at this point and do n't take orders from the ukrainian army . 
  but we already know that countries are considering to leave . 
  czechs said that they may leave if brexit happens back in february . 
  edit : it appears people do n't believe me . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/czechrepublic/12170994/czechs-will-follow-britain-out-of-eu.html )  the czech republic may choose to follow britain out of the european union , the country 's prime minister said , amid growing fears in brussels of a `` contagion '' . 
   bohuslav sobotka said that a `` czexit '' may take place . 
  the czech republic only joined the eu in 2004 and has been the beneficiary of billions in development funds , but has some of the most hostile public opinion . 
  dem downvotes . 
   on june 23 , it reappeared , * with all proposals about revoking russians ' citizenship removed completely . 
  * i 'm glad you agree with russian duma . 
  i 'm not sure why you are surprised . 
  these were almost certainly not the same people , so difference in 1 % is unimportant . 
  and down from 37 % in 2007, 
  through sweden !, 
  [ in 2001 ] ( http://wciom.ru/zh/print_q.php?s_id=405&amp;q_id=32590&amp;date=15.06.2000 ) when putin said that russia may join nato at some point only 31 % approved . 
  and he stopped , because of the very negative public reaction to those speeches . 
  the law does n't have anything to do with homosexuals . 
  they were detained for holding a banner , at which point overzealous policemen detained them for protesting , and released in a few hours . 
  not sure , but `` buk installation '' seems to be used often if google is to be believed . 
  that 's how it is written in the [ original article ] ( https://www.om.nl/actueel/nieuwsberichten/@94715/jit-will-present/ ) . 
  `` buk installation '' means the entire complex , not just the missile . 
   the jit is still waiting for information from the russian federation about buk installations . 
  that 's `` increased pressure '' ? 
  excellent unbiased reporting , bbc !, 
  remember yanukovych 's golden loaf and its subsequent `` loss '' ? 
  well , now the investigators say that the golden loaf never existed to begin with . 
  [ aggravation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aggravation_ ( law ) ) is a real term, 
   first is a picture of toothpaste let 's be clear here , the picture of the toothpaste is [ accompanied ] ( http://vk.com/wall-72278108?day=04042016&amp;offset=15120&amp;w=wall-72278108_479279%2fall ) by a short article about the only good form of opposition in russia being complete and utter destruction of russia . 
  most likely no . 
  essays by [ boris stomakhin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boris_stomakhin ) however are considered hate speech . 
  he also reposted essays by [ boris stomakhin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boris_stomakhin ) , which i assume is the real reason he was arrested . 
  hard to say . 
  in case of bubeyev there are aggravating circumstances - he has been previously arrested for hate speech and illegal possession of firearms . 
  the `` expert '' is actually talking about incorrect use of condoms by teenagers leading to dangerous sex . 
  his argument is bad and he should feel bad . 
  as usual , themoscowtimes is twisting and turning the truth in every possible way to fit its agenda . 
   kremlin-backed experts have described condoms as the main cause of russia hiv epidemic , the kommersant newspaper reported tuesday . 
  the [ kommersant article ] ( http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3000818 ) is titled `` nothing russian found in hiv '' . 
  the report made by the `` experts '' appears to be crazy and politicized . 
  it is also made by two doctors of history and one doctor of sociology . 
  but lets get to the important part . 
   study co-author igor beloborodov claimed that condoms were one of the factors causing the spread of the disease . 
   `` the contraceptive industry is interested in selling their products and encouraging under-aged people to engage in sex , '' he said . 
  beloborodov claims that condoms do n't protect teenagers from hiv as well as celibacy and monogamy does by appealing to authority , in this case some spanish doctor named `` hoakin de irala '' . 
  his arguments are bad , but he does n't blame condoms for hiv . 
  edit : i stand corrected . 
  at the end of the day hate speech is a crime in most countries , whether you do it on the internet or not . 
  it 's not `` now '' , the fighting was ocasionally happening all the time . 
  look at the bottom of the article , where it mentions dnr civilians wounded by ukrainian shelling . 
  because according to german laws isp and wi-fi provider are responsible for the actions of users . 
  if someone downloaded child porn or `` x-men : apocalypse '' on your network - you are the responsible party . 
  so no one wants to take the risk . 
  if we are talking about sorm , then switching to facebook will do sweet fuck all to protect you from surveilance because the packets are intercepted at the isp . 
   russian facebook no . 
  there is a very clear reason why vkontakte has won the russian market , and that reason is that vkontakte was first on the russian market . 
  facebook became available to non-us users in 2006 . 
  vk was launched in 2006 . 
  vk was targeting specifically russian audience , had ( arguably ) better design and in general existed in the environment where facebook was n't a competitor . 
  and because switching a social network is a massive undertaking most people do n't want to do ( how many people switched to g + ? 
  ) , by the time facebook reached russian audience everyone was already on vk and did n't bother to move . 
  because there was no real reason to move . 
  mail.ru used to be big . 
  no idea how they are doing these days . 
  i think they mostly survive on services other than actual mail . 
  was n't nival owned by mail.ru at some point ? 
  [ facebook was spying on belgian citizens ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/21/facebook-spying-belgian-citizens-nsa-data-regulator-lawsuit ) . 
  nsa was spying on everyone . 
  why would i consider facebook to be a safer alternative to vk ? 
  so , not at all for a private message . 
  i 'm yet to see anyone arrested for private messages in vk,
