   you guys seem to have your own social media vk.com appeared a few years after facebook as facebook knock-off and got really successful due to being in russian before facebook was . 
  and once you 've spent two-three years in a social network and all your friends are there , what 's the motivation to abandon it and make a new page on facebook ? 
  what 's the point ? 
   own video sites most are crap , people use youtube all the time . 
   own gaming servers language barrier . 
   instead of trying to join other countries who work together in some way you 'll just make your own etc. 
  honestly , this question is kind of crazy . 
  it 's like asking `` oh , why do n't you just buy audi and ignore every other car brand ? '', 
  or `` well why do n't you just use windows instead of ubuntu ? '' . 
  social networks are a business , online video services are a business . 
  they exist because they can make money on russian market and because they satisfy a demand other services do n't . 
  edit : on the state level , promoting internal production of goods and services is a normal , natural desire of a country rooted in the desire for independence . 
  you can see it in market protectionism , which is present in practically every country , performed via taxing of imported goods to drive up their price . 
  on the state level the primary reason for such activities is security . 
  if you make your own food , cars , etc. 
  then the foreign countries ca n't cut the supply to force you to do things . 
   clean as a thistle grammar nazi mode on . 
  it 's `` clean as a ** whistle ** '', 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-tyne-32003957  nine people have been arrested after flags were burned during a far-right demonstration in newcastle .

   while it certainly is more democratic than transnistria that ... is a highly questionable statement . 
  `` everyone who disagrees with me is a sub-human idiot '' is not a helpful attitude . 
  it is n't . 
  it 's an elective program you can participate in . 
   low quality weapons nor rain nor sleet nor common sense will stop / u/occupythekremlin from finding something bad to say about russia . 
   but . . how do these laws even pass ?!, 
  they did n't . 
  this is a law proposal . 
  the difference here is that cossacks are not just an organisation - they are an ethos . 
  they have their own culture , traditions , etc. 
  in ussr they were effectively destroyed , but are currently trying to rebuild themselves . 
  they exist not because they have a purpose , but because they want to exist . 
  they are occasionally used as volunteers by police to aid with public security during some events , but they do n't actually have any special rights . 
  because accusing people of being the thing they do n't like is the oldest trick in the book . 
  see also feminism and `` internalized misogyny '' . 
  much like any other ethos trying to cling to its roots . 
  they wear traditional costumes and demand the government recognise them and give them privileges ( like carrying arms ) , while the government ignores all those demands . 
  i expected petka and vasilii ivanovich , but that works too . 
  business as usual : 9th of may gets closer , oppositional media begin their attempts to undermine the holiday . 
  the story of everyone in russia being shot at the first sign of dissent is blown way out of proportion . 
  there is nothing more permanent than a temporary solution . 
   one of their pretexts for war with georgia [ eu puts the blame on georgia for starting the war ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/georgia/6247620/eu-blames-georgia-for-starting-war-with-russia.html ) . 
  you keep lying about that over and over and over again . 
  it was a colaboration with india all along . 
  however you do declare that carrot are fruit so that portugal can get subsidies to their carrot jam makers . 
  not only that . 
  milonov is one of the more active politicians and has a long and polarizing history . 
  some of his ideas are actually decent . 
  he 's been working towards improvement of st. petersburg 's infrastructure , improving life for homeless people by giving them homes and jobs , fought against microcredits , promoted the laws demanding that all deputies and potential deputies publish their income and their family 's income . 
  but he also unironically suggested creating morality police , called `` childfree '' a mental disorder and a form of political extremism , and wanted to fine people who walk around in public bare chested or wearing a swimsuit . 
  implying that not everything outside of russia is the shit . 
  personally - i do n't know . 
  judging by the [ newspaper articles ] ( http://www.spb.aif.ru/food/advice/134801 ) it 's a mental holdover from the 90s when buying foreign stuff was cool and prestigious - a remnant of an idea that outside of russia everything is the shit . 
  it 's not , but it makes milonov sound a tiny bit more like a monster . 
  and milonov is n't even lying - shopping tours to finland are kind of a part of st. petersburg 's culture . 
   we 'll pry it off their cold dead hands crimea for swedes ? 
  the intro has proven to be so controversial that korobatov apologised and rewrote it . 
  [ article in question ] ( http://www.yar.kp.ru/daily/26638.4/3656727/ ) . 
  i think they just took the dailymail article and used it to pad out the program time . 
  a proper propaganda piece would probably be longer and more sensationalist . 
  mind explaining the joke for me ? 
  i guess i need to translate the [ original story ] ( https://www.1tv.ru/news/2017/02/04/319200-evropu_nakryl_ovoschnoy_krizis_tseny_rastut_a_prilavki_opusteli ) . 
  thankfully , it 's short - 30 seconds of video . 
   rationing of vegetables began in europe . 
  in supermarkests of uk , norway and denmark the shelves are empty . 
  what remains is controlled - no more than three packets of salad and two packets of broccoli per person . 
  and the prices are enormous . 
  for example , the prices of eggplants and squash grew four times over the month !, 
   the reason for this is the bad harvest that happened due to overly cold winter in italy and spain - primary producers this time of year . 
  first the agricultural regions were hit by massive rains , then by frost . 
  according to the experts if the weather does n't get better , europeans might also lose their citrus . 
  that 's it . 
  that 's the whole story . 
  the video also shows the photographs from the dailymail article on the topic . 
  which i ca n't link because / r/europe is the judge of what is real and what is n't . 
  when two minutes of hate are over and you guys are done circlejerking each other , you can also read the [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38852721 ) story on the same topic . 
   though there is a big difference between shortage and rationing . 
  so bbc is also a russian puppet then ? 
  google translate :  coop norway has also been faced with challenges availability of including broccoli and iceberg lettuce . 
   -- currently we have goods in store , but we can not exclude that at times can be supply problems in some areas . 
  we should at least do what we can for this not to frame our customers , communication manager at coop norway harald kristiansen . 
   well there are issues with iceberg lettuce and broccoli apparently due to weather issues . 
  which is exactly the reason given in the russian news story . 
  judging by the comments here , it 's not long until russia finally defeats all the rebels in donetsk . 
  most likely - yes . 
  citalopram overdose was the suspected cause last time . 
  from what i could find , this means the bureaucracy and obsolete technology . 
  but do n't quote me on this . 
  the bad news is that our former surgeon-general spoke against this saying that `` placebo works '' and `` medicine is more art than science '' . 
  fortunately - former . 
  as you probably know , it is impossible to identify sarcasm over internet . 
  as opposed to the happiness they feel from being shelled by the ukrainian army ? 
  [ eu found georgia responsible for starting the war ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/georgia/6247620/eu-blames-georgia-for-starting-war-with-russia.html ) . 
  woah there buddy . 
  put that goalpost back where you took it . 
  the question was n't whether islamic terrorism in europe plays into the russian hands . 
  the question was whether us is known for supporting islamic terrorists . 
  and yes . 
  it is known for doing that .
