  because a joint defense system becomes a threat to the sovereignty of eu 's member states . 
  an army owned by the eu can be turned against any single member state that dissents , an implicit or even explicit threat against any potential brexit . 
  now , personally , i believe that abandoning nationalism completely and becoming a single nation is the way forward . 
  no germany , no uk , no spain - eu . 
  however , that did n't work out for the ussr . 
  they did consider it . 
  [ eu found georgia responsible for starting the war ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/georgia/6247620/eu-blames-georgia-for-starting-war-with-russia.html ) . 
  you are missing the point , dumbo . 
  if ukraine declares war on russia then ukraine will have to deal with russian army in open warfare . 
  alternatively , if ukraine did what it agreed to do in minsk , the conflict would also be over . 
  but ukraine does n't do that . 
  if ukraine declares war on russia , then instead of fighting rebels in the eastern ukraine they 'll have to deal with the actual russian army stomping to kiev . 
  people on reddit ca n't be arsed to read short articles . 
  you should at least add a summary if you want to get the message across . 
  op posted a link to polish website below . 
  in russian , as far as i can see , only ukrainian websites are covering this story . 
  ~ ~ i ca n't verify that actually . 
  [ this is the train in question ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strizh_ ( train ) ) . 
  the article uses singular and russian wiki also uses singular . 
  it 's a high-speed train between moscow and nijni novgorod so i can totally believe that there 's only one train , but there could be some terminology i 'm missing . ~ ~ edit : i was wrong . 
  there are seven trains . 
  anyway , russian railways representative [ responded to this ] ( https://meduza.io/news/2017/01/23/rzhd-ubrala-iz-vagonov-strizha-tablichki-s-narisovannym-shriftom-braylya ) saying that yes , the plaque existed , that this is how they got the trains from the manufacturer , and that the stickers are being replaced this month for new ones anyway . 
  so why did you write `` trains in russia '' when it 's one train having one plaque ? 
   as they did with `` americano '' by renaming it to `` rossiano '' which was a joke made by an ambassador from azerbaijan . 
   some russian restaurans in nazistic patriotic flashback even started to rename it to `` russian cabbage soup '' which was [ claimed ] ( https://twitter.com/tolokno/status/504964291401764865?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw ) by a pussy riot member in a very , very close up shot of the menu , without specifying in which restaurant , and not verified by anyone ever . 
  if this sounds like i 'm implying that she 's a lying piece of shit , it 's because i am . 
   it is called `` ukrainsky borsch '' i will believe you that there are places that call it `` ukrainskiy borsch '' , but that 's hardly universal and hardly proves anything . 
  roots of brosch go to kievan rus so we might as well discuss how it 's a traditional drevlianian dish or something . 
  borsch is certainly not a traditional dish for northern russian people , but i do not believe that you 'll be successful in trying to prove that it was invented specifically by south-eastern slavs that became ukrainians as opposed to all other south-eastern slavs . 
  eeeeh ... shashlik is a hard topic because i do n't have hard definitions for it . 
  every single culture ever had the idea of putting marinated meat on a stick and cooking it - kebabs and barbeque are basically the same as shashlik . 
  as far as i know , slavs had some form of cooking meat on a roast , but the name `` shashlik '' and probably some cooking techniques came from tatars . 
  not exclusively , unless you posit that all south-eastern slavs are/were ukrainians . 
  you meant to say `` specific '' . 
  is that a big problem in poland ? 
  writing free form requests and statements is actually rather common in most countries , germany included . 
  according to the article i linked ugay , in his own words , was asked to ** write ** and sign a promise to arrive to court at a later date or be kept in a detention center . 
  i do n't know why ugay phrased his response as `` i wo n't sign a blank piece of paper '' , but his version of the request is clearly not about signing a blank piece of paper . 
  i dunno , i 'm an atheist and do n't really follow the religious news . 
  i think , though i could be wrong , that ugay is the first person to be arrested based on this law . 
   whoever starts preaching anything except orthodox christianity or some other religion that 's considered `` traditional '' , risks being arrested and questioned about `` who he works for '' , even if he actually is n't a part of any religious organisation and preaches something he personally believes in . 
  it 's not about being traditional , it 's about being registered as a religious organization . 
  [ here 's a list of religious organizations registered in russian federation ] ( http://www.gks.ru/bgd/regl/b15_11/isswww.exe/stg/d01/11-03.htm ) . 
  they can do missionary work . 
  others , like scientology , ca n't . 
  while there is in fact risk of being arrested should someone complain to the police about you , if you are not actually a member of the religious organization - you can preach whatever you want . 
   a significant increase in the number of people who are n't officially members of any religious organizations but just happen to privately believe in the teachings of his holiness bhaktivedanta swami < redacted  ; this is basically what ugay is trying to claim - that he 's just `` a russian man '' . 
  i think the logic here is that investigation will determine whether you are involved in the activities of a religious group or whether you really are just some dude from the street . 
  no , this is ~ ~ bullshit ~ ~ cherrypicking . 
   [ ugay is describing events after he was arrested and delivered to the detention center ]  then [ interrogating officer ] gave me a blank paper and said that i have two options : either i keep denying everything and then i spend at least two days here , i.e. 
  48 hours at least , and i get put in a cell , and then i go to court , or i write a promise to arrive [ to court ? ], 
  with my signature and they release me . 
  i said i wo n't sign a blank piece of paper . 
  charges against krasnov have been dropped and he is free . 
   is being a missionary really against the law ? 
  missionary activity is limited , but not completely restricted . 
  * a missionary needs to have credentials from his religious organization verifying that they do indeed appoint him as a missionary . 
  * the missionary needs to be part of a religious organization registered as such with the government . 
  this cockblocks sects like scientology and other cults . 
  however , this does not affect civilians . 
  if you ask your muslim uncle to come to school and give other kids a presentation on islam - that 's legit , assuming he 's not an ordained priest or anything like that . 
  though it might be against some other school-related law i do n't know about . 
  * any religious propaganda materials need to be clearly marked as such . 
  and clearly marked with the organization from which they originate . 
  this cockblocks cults from pretending to be traditional religions . 
  * missionary activity can not be performed in places designed for habitation . 
  meaning that if jehovah 's witnesses come to your door to preach - that 's against the law because that 's missionary activity in your house . 
   also : ugay ? 
  hope he does n't travel to the us with that name . 
  it 's pronounced `` oogai '' . 
  i do n't really know how to properly transliterate his name . 
  edit :  i do n't see why you need to presecute their leaders . 
  here 's the deal . 
  in saint petersburg there is a guy named nail nasibulin . 
  his wife and daughter fell prey to a cult and disappeared , and since then he 's been zealously watching out for sects and informing the authorities . 
  he came to the petersburg 's police and claimed that dmitriy ugay is performing illegal missionary activity . 
  police arrested ugay and he 's currently on trial . 
  the trial is currently suspended as the prosecution is gathering witnesses to determine if ugay 's lecture involved missionary activity . 
  ugay is a high ranking member of sri chaitanya , an international krishnait organisation . 
  [ here 's a page in vkontakte ( ru ) ] ( https://vk.com/page-97886228_50932457 ) that links the names `` dmitriy ugay '' ( \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0423\u0433\u0430\u0439 ) and `` sripad bhakti ashrai dandi maharaj '' ( ugay 's religious name ) and describes him the following way :  [ ugay ] has highest philosophical education , was a teacher in gurukul . 
  ... dandi maharaj - head of publishing house sri chaitanya sarasvati , is involved in translating and editing of books , reads lectures , curates internet projects and missionary programs . 
  there are also testimonies from professors of religious studies saying that ugay is a member of sri chaitanya . 
  there is absolutely no doubt at all that ugay is a professional missionary , and it is rather strange that he lies about it in court . 
  all claims that he 's just a programmer and just `` a russian man '' are obfuscation . 
  the case is currently suspended until january 18th as the prosecution is gathering witnesses . 
  honestly , i do n't really care . 
  in russian there are no articles so there is no `` ukraine vs. the ukraine '' . 
  i keep saying `` the ukraine '' because it makes ukrainian nationalists butthurt on the internet . 
  because seriously , saying that you are being oppressed by the article is stupid . 
  `` the united states '' is okay and `` the sudan '' is okay , but the ukraine is too good for articles . 
   the fact that you 're using the term ` the ukraine ' instead of ` ukraine ' simply proves that you view ukraine as nothing more as a rebellious province of russia . 
  also on my list of linguistic oppression : the congo , the sudan and the united states . 
  edit : and hey , the netherlands too . 
  what was the right way to do it ? 
  revolution in the ukraine happened , crimea declared its independence due to the revolution and voted to join russia . 
  sans joining russia , this is literally how the ukraine became independent from the soviet union . 
  that case of bad journalism did n't originate from russia though . 
  just google `` sweden bans christmas lights '' and you 'll find it repeated over and over . 
   because of the lack of independent pollsters did something happen to levada ? 
   yes , because you always bring dogs when two heads of state meet he kinda does .
