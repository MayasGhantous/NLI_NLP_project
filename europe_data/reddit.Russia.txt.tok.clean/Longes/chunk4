  how does it make it worse ? 
  certain books are being removed from the school libraries because they do n't align with the curriculum . 
  how is this horrible terribad ? 
  [ this is a thing that happens in the world ] ( http://wisconsindailyindependent.com/8000-books-removed-from-racine-public-school-libraries/ ) . 
  governments like to control education to an extent . 
  [ we learned from the best ] ( http://wisconsindailyindependent.com/8000-books-removed-from-racine-public-school-libraries/ ), 
  nothing is being banned . 
  materials published by soros foundation are being removed from school libraries . 
   edit : added keegan , as / u/longes correctly pointed out . 
  my post :  it bans books published by the soros fund under the editoring of beevor and keening . 
  what 's the problem again ? 
  well . 
  the story gets better . 
  apparently the import restriction is only for the medical clinics . 
  shops will still be able to sell them . 
  but medical clinics that use condoms for ultrasonography , for example , will have to buy russian made ones . 
  i 'm not sure where you read it in the article . 
  every time it 's either `` beevor and keening '' or a few words about beevor 's work in the middle of the article . 
  so , not `` russia defends '' but `` former official makes an idiotic claim '', 
   they banned imported flowers because they did n't want their people to see that the price was getting too large ... definitely not because netherlands imposes sanctions on russia . 
  nope . 
  just another step in campaign of terror against the russian people . 
   or joining russia you realise that the feeling must be mutual ? 
  so , as it turns out this is yet more propaganda from themoscowtimes . 
  here 's the order - http://www.e1.ru/news/images/new1/427/882/images/19 ( 1 ) . jpg it does n't ban books written by beevor . 
  it bans books published by the soros fund under the editoring of beevor and keening . 
  beevor has been criticised for his use of unreliable and anecdotal sources in the past . 
  and what ? 
  you show the data for 2012 , which says that economic crisis increased the number of people identifying as believers . 
  this is an article that shows the data for 2015 , which says the number of people who trust religion has decreased . 
  it 's more likely that they ca n't make a reasonable claim for anything else , rather than not wanting it . 
  it is ? 
  i 'm an atheist myself , but i think they are pretty . 
  better than the dark grey of catholic churches . 
  edit : i 'm generalizing of course . 
  some catholic churches are pretty cool , and glass mozaics are always neat . 
  the pictures show that the number of believers increased in 2012 and reached the level of 2007 . 
  since then 3 years passed . 
   cprf is pro-orthodox , weirdly enough communism 's view of religion is complicated . 
  strong anti-religious stance is mainly a trait of marxism-leninism . 
  stalin 's government on the other hand decided that church would be a useful tool in the wwii environment , and was pretty chill about religion . 
  it 's not a ban at all . 
  it 's a restriction on import to support the local manufacturing . 
  onishenko is a very ... special ex-minister . 
  it is indeed fox news propaganda . 
  there is no condom ban . 
  it 's not a ban on those items , it 's a restriction on import of those items to support local manufacturers . 
  on further consideration , the map does n't even fit the data from pintprice . 
  i have no idea how it was made . 
  i do n't understand how the map was made . 
  minimum wage in russia is 87 euro . 
  cheapest beer from pintprice is 0.36 , average is 1.45 , resulting in 241 beers or 60 beers . 
  but it ca n't possibly be using average price , because for ukraine it is using the lowest price ( average results in 94 beers ) . 
  it appears to be the lowest price from http://www.pintprice.com/, 
  looks like they used the lowest price from http://www.pintprice.com/, 
  nuclear is good for russia - it 's building a lot of reactors all over the world already . 
  alternate theory - he 's using gps which is guiding him by the roads . 
  well , let 's look at objective metrics to test your statement . 
  [ specifically , at the gini index ] ( https://www.quandl.com/collections/demography/gini-index-by-country ) . 
  well , that 's not so bad . 
  slightly worse than uk , slightly better than us . 
  [ and if you look at the graphic ] ( https://www.quandl.com/data/worldbank/rus_si_pov_gini-russian-federation-gini-index?utm_medium=graph&amp;utm_source=quandl ) , you 'll see that the people were getting more equal at a fairly stable rate for teh last 20 years . 
  there 's nothing new in the article that would be worth discussing . 
  just the general hurr-durr veto is bad . 
  and russia vetoed the tribunal because it violates un resolution 2166 , and politicizes the matter . 
  everything has its reasons . 
  reddit in general , really . 
  people screamed whataboutism at a discussion of ngos doing bad things in a thread about a russian foreign agents law . 
  no , i 'm pointing out the flawed logic in `` russia vetoed tribunal = russia did it '' . 
  does the last year vote against an anti-nazism resolution by us , canada and ukraine mean those countries are controlled by the nazis ? 
  let 's try it . 
  '' [ ukraine nazis ] ( https://www.google.de/search?q=ukraine+nazis&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cayq_auoawovchmiopbq__qkxwivxo0sch1eyw06 ) '' . 
  well , that proves it - ukraine is in fact nazist . 
  google said so . 
  and neither of those two people actually signed minsk 2 . 
  not a clue . 
  maybe people disapprove of your idea of a limit on the maximum number of terms . 
  well , we do n't have any other indicators , so ef will have to do . 
  not the first time `` everybody knows '' is wrong . 
  one look at your post history and frequency shows that you obviously shill on reddit for a living . 
  i 'm not surprised that you 'd support a flawed methodology . 
  no one has denied the presence of russian volunteers , no ? 
  11 % , actually . 
  pretty bad result overall - 32nd place in the world by the ammount of people who speak english . 
  though there are regional outliers - for example moscow region has better results than germany . 
  as of 2013 russia was in top-10 countries by the dynamic of improvement ( i.e. , the ammount of people who know english is increasing at a very good rate ) . 
  edit : no need to get butthurt , people . 
  you can check the [ ef page yourself ] ( http://www.ef.co.uk/epi/spotlights/europe/russia/ ), 
  i 'm ... not sure . 
  my bad . 
  oh wow , a video with a whole 17k views . 
  practically everyone seen it !, 
  yes , russia has a problem with racism . 
  but russians do n't `` always '' call obama `` monkey '' ( at least not the people i generally talk with ) . 
  my point was - using a google search on a particular pair of words is meaningless . 
  you get the same results with the `` obama monkey '' search , because that 's how the images are described . 
  it 's a non-representative search , because the only results you get are those that match your querry . 
  [ that 's comming to an end ] ( http://en.delfi.lt/nordic-baltic/belarus-bans-re-export-of-estonian-and-latvian-canned-fish-to-russia.d?id=68218712 ), 
  that search hardly proves anything , you can do the same with the english text and get similar results . 
  facepalm.jpg at least for football fans i already had no expectations of sanity and civility .
