  but come on guys ... :(, 
  hard to disagree with him . 
   if you make it too short , on the other hand , politicians might have nothing to lose once elected , and the office could become a throwaway thing . 
  even worse , if you make it too short , then the president/chancelor/whoever wo n't have enough time to actually do anything . 
  many country-wide policies reuqire years to implement . 
  does gauck ever actually do anything ? 
  we never hear about him , it 's always merkelmerkelmerkel . 
  came into the thread expecting putin to be mentioned . 
  was not disappointed . 
  what are the common characteristics sufficient to call eeu the ussr 2.0 lite ? 
  kazakhstan 's state language is kazakh . 
  but russian is an official language , meaning it can be used ( and mostly is used ) for official documents and dealing with the government . 
  by that logic eu is basically fourth reich lite . 
  apparently . 
  though i 'm guessing it was mostly canned fish . 
  with all that money greece does n't have . 
  london bankers ? 
  was n't the german empire the main funding force behind the bolsheviks ? 
  you should disown dojd the same way you disown ekho . 
  after all , dojd was endorsed by medvedev while he was a president , and was built on the state money given to save kit-finance . 
  i meant him . 
  i agree that her actions are unethical , when a ukrainian guy offers to shoot at people on camera , a journalist should politely refuse . 
  but i still think the title is exagerated . 
  the title seems a bit exagerrated . 
  the rebel commander offered , saying they are going to return fire anyway . 
  the better comparison would be the nikaragua vs. 
  us case . 
  the question is ultimately `` if the independent militants supported by the government x do action y , is the government x responsible for y ? '', 
  in the case of nikaragua un decided that no , us is not responsible for anything nikaraguan contras did . 
  tribunal ! = investigation . 
  in fact , one of the reasons russia is vetoeing the tribunal is because there was n't an open , transparent investigation going . 
  nothing ? 
  it 's always been a rag . 
   i do not understand why the russian people fail to see how the contradictions contained in the official propaganda are increasing daily . 
  on the one hand , everyone understands that russian soldiers are performing heroic feats in hostile ukraine . 
  and while the president denies their presence on foreign soil , their secret exploits seem somehow greater than any performed without duplicity . 
  well done , men !, 
  bravo !, 
  i feel like the author visited some kind of alternate russia . 
  that 's the moscow times for you . 
  while it is owned by gasprom , ekho moskvy claims that it 's self-funded ( through advertising ) and has a long standing reputation of liberal oppositionary pro-us media . 
  while chechnya is infamously corrupt , it is corrupt in favor of kadyrov , and i doubt he 's a big fan of isis . 
  i did n't say `` for no reason '' . 
  i ca n't find a direct name of law about it , but here yevgeniy chichvarkin , a large russian bussinessman [ writes how he got a letter from his uk bank ] ( https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1536306226620540&amp;id=100007235320406 ) in 2015 , which requires him to prove where he got all his money . 
  and apparently he 's not the only one . 
  not going to work anymore . 
  uk clearly showed that it 's ready to take away your assets at the drop of a hat , so it 's impossible to trust them . 
  but one should probably read the text , before being a dick about it . 
  you know that accountants are paid good money to not do `` routine mistakes '' , because tax collectors view those ` mistakes ' very poorly ? 
  you got it !, 
  because being forced to disclose their activities makes the majority of ngos unable to fulfill their purpose . 
  poe 's law and all that . 
  and considering how / u/hulagukan does n't understand what whataboutism is and he 's not the first , i tend to assume the worst . 
  so where 's the whataboutism in the things i said ? 
  how is that relevant ? 
  i 'm talking about usaid being an american ngo that 's banned in russia in a thread about foreign ngos in russia . 
  where 's the whataboutism ? 
  because since 2005 dynasty was funding the [ fund `` liberal mission '' ] ( http://www.liberal.ru/ ) , which is engaged in political activities and funding liberal opposition . 
   edit : arts is way better example . 
  due to censorship they barely produced any artists if you compare to pre-soviet era - you could argue back then russia made some of the greatest writers and musicians of all time . 
  that 's just some soviet writers of the top of my head . 
   whataboutism you keep using that word . 
  i do not think it means what you think it means . 
  how does disclosure of funding sources and recievers hurt science ? 
  it 's not like foreign funds like usaid ever did any malicious activity . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/usaid-latin-americans-cuba-rebellion-hiv-workshops oh :(, 
  to what end what ? 
  mark admonais is pretty well known . 
  oh moscowtimes , you are as shit as always . 
  this has actually been discussed a year ago . 
  [ and by times ] ( http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article4203957.ece ), 
   if it was true , which i doubt , it does not make any sense . 
  truthfulness notwithstanding , if greece decided to print drachmas , it would have to ask russia . 
  because greece does n't have equipment or materials to print its own money and russia is providing the service for some countries . 
  apparently russia is selling money paper to canada . 
  when usaid was banned people were screaming how that 's an attack on democracy . 
  does n't mean it was n't a good move . 
  being a foreign agent does n't mean the fund has to stop working , it means the fund must be crystal clear about where the money are comming from and where they are going , but dynasty prefered to close rather than do that . 
  well , you ca n't talk about russia being evil when it 's not being evil , so everyone just has to go to other threads , 
  it 's not about people being morally corrupt though . 
  it 's about americans having the power to go `` that 's a nice daughter you have here . 
  it would be a shame if something happened to her . '', 
  being morally corrupt is not a requirement for blackmail . 
  too much conflicting information , and i do n't find media to be trustworthy with anything but clear facts . 
  i 'm witholding judgement until i can read the report myself . 
  russia has blacklisted major cultural figures ... when exactly ? 
  trust me , ukrainian history books are a thing of beauty . 
  it 's like reading lord of the rings . 
  edit : just to put things in perspective , [ this ] ( http://sputnikipogrom.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/01-skify.jpg ) is shown as a territory of ancient ukraine as a scythian country in v-iv b.c. 
  he is !, 
  dude was a good actor . 
  well , your politicians have already said that recent right sector problems are due to russian agents infiltrating right sector . 
  i 've clearly been underestimating ~ ~ kgb ~ ~ ~ ~ gru ~ ~ kgb all these years . 
   it 's clearly helping russians and their bullshit spin it 's not much of a spin if it 's true , is it ? 
  you meant `` flammable '' :p, 
   look at your own government that fully protects rebels that by accident shot down a civilian plane . 
  stiiiiill waiting for that investigation report before i agree with you . 
  [ lifted 2 days ago ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/21/world/middleeast/security-council-following-iran-nuclear-pact-votes-to-lift-sanctions.html ) . 
  after how many years ? 
  edit : on further reading , not even lifted .
