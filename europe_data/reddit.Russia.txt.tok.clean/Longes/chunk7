   after all , they are the only country to care and constantly cry about them . 
  except for , you know , all those lithuanians who are upset about their removal , and who are the topic of the article . 
  [ are we ignoring that time when eu said that georgia is responsible for the conflict ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/eu-report-independent-experts-blame-georgia-for-south-ossetia-war-a-650228.html ) ? 
  it 's surprisingly hard to come to one true theory when the investigation materials are hidden and your experts are n't allowed to participate . 
  there could have been an initial growth in 2014 , after he became a president and ukraine still had a few coins in the bank . 
  but as of right now - he 's losing money . 
   according to karatnycky , high-ranking ukrainian officials believe right sector `` is heavily infiltrated by agent provocateurs , including those linked to the fsb '' -- the federal security service , russia 's main state security agency . 
  [ according to bloomberg ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-08/billionaire-no-more-ukraine-president-s-fortune-fades-with-war ) , he lost 30 % of his fortune . 
  the main reason seems to be sanctions against his stuff in russia , which was the main importer of roshen candy . 
  and the need to personally fund the war since ukraine is broke . 
  the problem is that these are crazy armed nazists with military and revolutionary experience . 
   russia 's regional governments have fallen deeply into debt under the weight of these pledges . 
  and with a drop in aid from the federal budget , which is increasingly tied up in such expensive projects as military rearmament and the integration of crimea , relief is nowhere in sight . 
   a report issued by moscow 's higher school of economics ( hse ) in may found that 20 of russia 's 83 regions may be technically in default already . 
  what the propaganda times does n't tell you : according to the hse 's report , the crisis in the regions is due to the fact that ** from 2009 to 2014 ** the social spending in the region was almost doubled , but the budgets grew slower . 
  well , shukhevych was also in nachtingal , so it 's hard to say that he 's an innocent white bunny . 
  it 's possible to become a millionaire in russia as well . 
  hell , if i move in with my parents and do n't go on vacation in summer , i can be a millionaire in about two years . 
   they really did n't apply any time constraint in the poll ? 
  the phrasing implies that it 's a monthly income of 1 million or more . 
   i have a difficult time believing that russians feel this way . 
  i can easily believe that russians feel this way , even if it 's not factually true . 
  it 's the same thing with `` corruption is everywhere ! '', 
  i 've recently read a blog post where a ( self-proclaimed ) middle class moscow man is whining that his salary of 250k rubles per month is basically nothing and he 's at the poverty limit . 
  for reference , that 's 6 times more than the median salary in russia . 
  people believe strange things . 
  well , a million rubles is not much , but you can buy a decent appartment for five millions , so it 's nothing to scoff at either . 
  you wo n't be eating caviar from a golden plate , but having a million is a good thing . 
  okay , please explain to me how byvshev is making an innocent and benign reference here . 
  he 's been convicted to community service . 
  especially when it 's the moscow times \u25d4 _ \u25d4, 
  yes . 
  yearly salary is never used in russia . 
  it 's been posted twice in the comment section here . 
  and there are only 15 comments currently . 
  given the way `` moscal '' is used in the modern ukrainian , and the rest of the poem , i doubt it 's a reference . 
  the question is pretty vague honestly . 
  but yes , '' \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c '' ( it 's in caps because that 's how levada writes their questions ) is continuous , not a single time . 
  '' , then it would be `` is it possible to honestly earn millions of rubles in russia today ? 
  '' , over arbitrary length of time . 
  it 's the difference of `` i can put half of my salary under the pillow for five years and have a million '' and `` my salary is one million rubles . '', 
  the pun works in english too , but i 'm still downvoting you because it 's so painful . 
  / r/europe does n't like when ukrainian government is shown in a bad light . 
  [ i 've made a rough translation of the poem ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3dcuwc/russian_teacher_convicted_for_writing_poem_in/ct4176t ), 
  mr. byvshev was convicted because his poem incites international hatred ( according to the court 's experts ) . 
  allow me to translate the poem ( i 'll probably lose the rhyme ) and judge for yourself . 
   some unknown spetznaz appeared  ( kremlin is quiet about `` mysterious invaders '' . ), 
   `` not one step back from the putin 's chekists ! '', 
  -  echoes in the wounded hearts . 
    to all invasions of the moscal thugs  friends , answer as bandera did :  `` let the occupants drown in their blood ! '', 
  -  you ca n't deal differently with `` those vermin '' . 
    meet enemies as your ancestors did ,  so the enemy 's boots wo n't trample our soil . 
   prepare some lead porrige for them . 
   in the bloody battle god will protect you !, 
    it 's too early for you to put down your arms  russia is threateining you with another attack . 
   let the spirit of roman shuhevich live !, 
   let god be your guide !, 
  roman shuhevich was the vice-commander of nachtingal . 
  moscal is a degrading word for russians , akin to russian use of `` hohol '' for ukrainians . 
  in russia ? 
  no , not really , unless you are talking with export-oriented businessmen . 
   the majority of russians believe it is impossible to become a ruble millionaire without bending the rules , a poll conducted by independent levada center revealed tuesday . 
  as usual , moscowtimes twists the truth for the sake of propaganda . 
   do you believe it is possible to honestly earn millions of rubles in russia today ? 
  i.e. , is it possible to have a salary of more than million rubles . 
  not `` is it possible to become a ruble millionaire ? '', 
  memes are hard to get rid of , especially if they were true just 20 years ago . 
  the problem with putin 's ` wealth ' is that there is no credible proof that it exists . 
  this is the reason why putin is absent from forbes ' richest people list .

  how can i relax when putin has mastered the time itself and retroactively built the fence in [ 2013 ] ( http://www.frontnews.ge/ge/news/10637-%e1%83%a1%e1%83%a3%e1%83%a0%e1%83%98%e1%83%9c%e1%83%90%e1%83%9b%e1%83%98%e1%83%a1-%e1%83%93%e1%83%94%e1%83%9a%e1%83%94%e1%83%92%e1%83%90%e1%83%aa%e1%83%98%e1%83%90%e1%83%9b-%e1%83%ac%e1%83%94%e1%83%a0%e1%83%9d%e1%83%95%e1%83%90%e1%83%9c%e1%83%98-%e1%83%93%e1%83%90-%e1%83%93%e1%83%95%e1%83%90%e1%83%9c%e1%83%98-%e1%83%9b%e1%83%9d%e1%83%98%e1%83%9c%e1%83%90%e1%83%ae%e1%83%a3%e1%83%9a%e1%83%90 ) ? 
  [ here 's the source of the picture ] ( http://www.frontnews.ge/ge/news/10637-%e1%83%a1%e1%83%a3%e1%83%a0%e1%83%98%e1%83%9c%e1%83%90%e1%83%9b%e1%83%98%e1%83%a1-%e1%83%93%e1%83%94%e1%83%9a%e1%83%94%e1%83%92%e1%83%90%e1%83%aa%e1%83%98%e1%83%90%e1%83%9b-%e1%83%ac%e1%83%94%e1%83%a0%e1%83%9d%e1%83%95%e1%83%90%e1%83%9c%e1%83%98-%e1%83%93%e1%83%90-%e1%83%93%e1%83%95%e1%83%90%e1%83%9c%e1%83%98-%e1%83%9b%e1%83%9d%e1%83%98%e1%83%9c%e1%83%90%e1%83%ae%e1%83%a3%e1%83%9a%e1%83%90 ) . 
  check the date . 
   that 's not what merkel and hollande are talking about . 
  they are suggesting to take donbass back ( not by force ) and basically support them financially , but without any political influence . 
  basically taxation without representation . 
  so , that thing ukraine promised to do when it signed minsk ii ? 
  it 's not quite the same when moscow has 12 million people in it , and everything other than london ( 8 mil . ), 
  has less than 4 million . 
  i do n't have any info on foreign tourism in russia , but as far as i know , it 's always been fairly weak due to need for visas and stuff . 
  for europeans it 's just easier to go somewhere in the eu , because they can just go . 
  however i do n't think there 'd be any special negative reaction towards the tourists today . 
  i know that the rising tensions have positively affected internal tourism - the aformentioned sochi and gelendjik had great summer last year . 
  source - friends among family hotel owners . 
   also , what time of year would you recommend for tourist-y visits ? 
  i get the idea that autumn is a good time , as i 've heard st. petersburg gets very humid during the summertime . 
  depends on the place , obviously . 
  russia is big and its climates are varied . 
  if you are going for the seas - sochi or gelendjik , then august or early autumn are optimal . 
  moscow is better in late spring or early autumn , as it is devilishly hot in summer and cold and snowy in winter . 
  st. petersburg sucks 24/7 365 , so there is never a ` good ' time to visit , but i personally prefer it in winter , based on the few visits i had . 
  it 's also important to understand that moscow ` suburbs ' are often separate cities , like zelenograd or dolgoprudniy . 
  because moscow is just that big . 
  i have the same feeling about czech language :d though some words are deceptively similar while having different meanings . 
  not really . 
  just new sociological information . 
  then number of people who want to leave is roughly the same as in last years . 
  edit :  am i missing something big ? 
  did something happen ? 
  well , there are all those sanctions and the ukrainian crisis ... edit 2 : the peak number of wishful emigrants seems to be 2008 , when 17 % wanted to leave .
