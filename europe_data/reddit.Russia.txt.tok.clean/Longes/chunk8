  the number of people who want to emigrate from russia is still roughly the same - 11-13 % . 
  the majority of people who want to leave are young adulta 18-24 y.o. 
  ( 26 % ) and supporters of non-parliamentary parties ( 39 % ) . 
  however , the majority of russians ( 85 % ) do n't want to leave russia . 
  the main factor in desire to emigrate is still the desire to improve your lifestyle ( get better salary , social benefits , etc. ) . 
  in the last poll this was chosen by 40 % of the respondents . 
  however , this number decreased from the last year 47 % in 2014 ) . 
  there are also fewer people who expect social protection and stability from a new homeland ( 12 % in 2014 , 7 % in 2015 ) and hope for better opportunities in career ( 14 % to 6 % ) . 
  each tenth person ( 9 % ) is ready to leave for a country with better climate or ecology . 
  6 % say they want to leave because of the government 's policies , 4 % do n't want to live in russia . 
  5 % just want to see the world , while 3 % want to meet new culture . 
  however , the majority of people who want to leave are not ready to leave in a near future , or did n't think about leaving at all . 
  only 12 % of respondents are ready to emigrate in the nearest few years . 
  ~ ~ i 'll translate the important points in a minute . ~ ~ edit : see below . 
  the oldest russian sociological organisation . 
  owned by the government . 
   turkish stream failed news to me !, 
  in terms of economy belarus is heavily tied to russia though . 
  greece needs to learn from ukraine . 
  that 's where true masters of playing both sides lived until recently . 
   how in the holy perkele did we become the assholes in this scenario finland was heavily blocking greece 's attempt at negotiations recently , and then there 's the whole thing with not letting russian delegation visit the osce summit . 
   building new pipelines from russia to western europe is out of fashion [ which is why germany is also buidling one ] ( http://rt.com/business/268060-russia-gas-germany-europe/ ) . 
  you have your timeline wrong . 
  poverty and social unrest happened after the euromaidan . 
  we only have the word of * the internet * that nemtsov was assassinated by putin , yet everyone assumes it 's true . 
  as is the amount of anti-russian propaganda in the text . 
  i mean , really , `` russian invasion of georgia '' ? 
  [ it 's already been established that georgia was the aggressor ] ( www.spiegel.de/international/world/eu-report-independent-experts-blame-georgia-for-south-ossetia-war-a-650228.html ) . 
  as opposed to [ amnesty of criminals in ukraine in 2014 ] ( http://timlawyer.com.ua/amnistiya-v-ukraine-2014 ) for completely no reason ? 
  government gives big amnesty from time to time , that 's not unusual . 
  this one was timed to 9th of may , which is also not unusual - amnesties are often tied to large celebrations . 
  yes , kadyrov is democratically elected . 
  do you have a problem with this ? 
   and yes , do n't even think quoting aksyonov 'cause that criminal wo n't make you sound any solid either . 
  you know what `` alleged '' means , right ? 
  it 's impossible to discuss crimean policies and avoid aksyonov * because aksyonov is a goddamn chairman of the council of ministers of the republic * . 
  oh wow , a troll asking for proofs . 
  i do n't delete my posts . 
  what is vague about it ? 
  what kind of information do you expect ? 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.rg.ru/2015/07/07/reg-kfo/turkey.html ) a bigger text in russian , with quotes from aksenov and sarptash . 
  it 's propaganda because ... ? 
  oh wow , a person with a nick `` putin_vor '' ( vor means thief in russian ) and less than a year of reddit history finds it in himself to call someone a `` dumb spammer '' and a shill . 
  according to a recent poll by focus.ua , dmitriy yarosh of the right sector is the most trusted ukrainian politician . 
  saakashvilli is on the second place , yegor soboloev on third . 
  yulia timoshenko took the tenth place . 
  http://www.prisonstudies.org/country/russian-federation you can see that the number of prisoners was steadily falling over the last years . 
   sems unlikely to me , because according to the statistics about the proportion of foreign prisoners that you can pick in the drop down menu on the left only about 7 percent of seychells prisoners are foreigners . 
  well , that 's weird then . 
  that means the entire free population of seychells is roughly 700 people . 
  you should see the other topic i posted , about turkey and crimea signing a cooperation agreement . 
  30 % upvoted . 
  are mostly un-funded , and used to keep somali pirates and the like . 
  baltic states do n't have a history of hating facists . 
  they tend to balance between mild indiference and lukewarm approval . 
  you should probably read the article before you start spouting propaganda . 
  clearly the recent charleston shooting means that black people should flee the us right now . 
  that being said , yes , there are sadly crazed idiots in russia . 
  this , however  but us laws do n't promote this kind of behaviour , like does n't russian `` anti-gay propaganda '' law . 
  is not true . 
  most of those stories are from before the law was passed . 
  ---------------------------- this article is full of propaganda and/or poor research by the way :  2 : gay dating app blocked , users threatened with arrest the article neglects to mention that the app was hacked , not blocked by the authorities . 
   3 : three men sentenced for stabbing and setting alight man they believed was gay  although the main motive for the crime was homophobia , the three men were prosecuted for murder , not hate crime . 
  that 's because there is no prosecution for hate crime in russia . 
  hate crime is forbidden , but is classified as vandalism/murder/whatever in each individual case . 
  for example , pussy riot commiting hate crime against christians was classified as vandalism . 
   if it continues like this , sooner it will be as bad as middle east or uganda that 's not so much of a slippery slope fallacy , as it is a 90 \u00b0 cliff fallacy . 
  i 'm pretty sure serbia asked for it . 
  russia 's action should n't have been a surprise for anyone - [ serbians expected it ] ( http://inserbia.info/today/2015/06/russia-to-cast-veto-on-srebrenica-resolution-if-serbia-requests-it/ ) . 
   because if you look at this map , you will see that national republics are the leaders of growth , the biggest two seem to be nenets autonomous okrug , which has 63 % of ethnic russians , 18 % of nents , 8 % of komi and 2 % of ukrainians . 
  and khanty-mansi autonomous okrug , which has 68 % of russians , 7 % of tatars , and 6 % of ukrainians . 
  that 's actually the highest percentage of russians in khanty-mansi ao since 1979 . 
  edit : i did n't notice the small republics at the bottom , which have higher numbers , but i do n't have time to check their populations right now . 
   while the reality suggests the opposite - that it 's people from caucasus and other national republics that are responsible for the most of the growth . 
  from your source :  according to the 2010 census , ethnic russian people make up 81 % of the total population . 
  ** this share remained steady over the last few decades . 
  ** this suggests that no , immigration is not the major factor in population growth , and is in line with the birth rates or ethnic russians . 
   yep . 
  oil and natural gas prices surely have nothing to do with that . 
  of course they were important . 
  but oil and gas prices are not the ultimate deciding factor in the economy and social benefits . 
  oil and gas exports need to be carefuly managed , so people like hodorkovskiy do n't sell oil as `` well liquid '' to avoid taxes . 
  that 's what us officials were saying for the last ten years . 
  in 2012 we had hillary clinton say that eurasian union is a threat and must be stopped . 
  in 2009 we had cia list russia as one of the most dangerous countries to the us . 
  the us-russia relations were going downhill since the orange revolution of 2004 . 
  fun fact : vladimir putin is not even a member of the united russia . 
  although arguing that united russia does n't fully support him would be disinginious of me . 
   ethnic russian population i do n't think that 's a worthy topic to discuss . 
  russia is a multi-ethnical country , it 's even in our anthem . 
  getting back to the actual question : i would attribute better population growth to russia transitioning out of the 90s far better than ukraine , due to putin 's administration being vastly more competent than everyone who was in power in ukraine . 
  do note that russia came back to population growth level of ussr collapse . 
  ukraine is still below it . 
  i do n't think migration from asian countries is all that influential - it was far easier for them to migrate during the ussr period . 
  `` steal '' . 
   compare the graphs for two countries that went through similar transformations in the past few decades : russia , ukraine . 
  they are similar , as i expect them to be , but russia 's growth curve is sharper than ukraine 's . 
  from 8 to 14 , as opposed to from 8 to 11 . 
   he seriously , stop talking about russia like it 's a giant robot piloted by putin 's will and nothing else . 
  germany also lost a war and their opinion on the matter and ability to disagree were largely non-existent .
