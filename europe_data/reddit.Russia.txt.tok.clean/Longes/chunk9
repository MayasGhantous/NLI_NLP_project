  oh man , ad hominem attack on a media ? 
  there is a time and place for everything , especially in the international diplomacy . 
  especially when some people do n't agree with you . 
  why do n't you come up to your mother right now and call her a fat old cow ? 
   while homosexuality is not illegal in russia , mr putin introduced a law in 2013 that bans symbols which promote `` non-traditional '' values . 
   homosexuality is not illegal in russia , however the country has implemented a law since 2013 which outlaws the use of symbols which could be considered `` propaganda '' promoting `` non traditional '' values . 
  can independent.co.uk at least hire an editor ? 
  i agree with russia 's stance that the decision is currently counter-productive and will only increase the tension in the region . 
  i , personally , consider the bosniak genocide to be a genocide . 
  glory to the heroes ' homeland !, 
  edit : what 's the downvote for ? 
  this is what the poster says . 
  it 's `` rap sheet '' , not `` wrap sheet '' . 
  greece is actually a soviet republic in disguise !, 
  it infiltrated eu to destroy filthy capitalist unions and banking systems !, 
  ah , you think you 've bested me !, 
  ha ha !, 
  you fool !, 
  you fell victim to one of the classic blunders - the most famous of which is `` never get involved in a land war in asia '' - but only slightly less well-known is this : `` never go in against / u/longes when conspiracy is on the line '' !, 
  everyone knows that putin has been replaced by a double long time ago !, 
  but where did the real putin go , you might ask ? 
  weeeeeell ... have you ever seen the real!putin and tsipras together in the same room ? 
   which i do doubt it will , since it 's under 10k people protesting about electricity prices . 
  that 's what yanukovich said . 
  since it 's for both tsipras and putin - tsipin . 
  have you ever seen putin and tsipras together in the same room ? 
   could the recent russian posturing it 's not recent . 
  russians have been flying around for the last ten years , and americans have been flying around russian border for the last twenty years . 
  recently it just became a hot topic in the news . 
  from the details of shokin 's assignment , he looks to me like the guy set up to clean the office from old elements and take the fall . 
   they can merely submit to putin in a way that saves face . 
  ukraine as a country - maybe . 
  but not under the current leadership . 
  remember that they came to power with the screams of `` eu , not russia '' and `` knife the muscovites '' . 
  first of all , it neither wants to nor needs . 
  there is seriously nothing interesting for russia in the western ukraine . 
  second , it will be brutal and painful due to local resistance and brainwashing of the last 20 years . 
  in crimea people like russia enough to vote overwhelmingly `` yes '' in a referendum . 
  in lvov or kiev they do n't . 
  well , if you consider all yanukovich-time corruption investigations to be pollitical attacks , and all euromaidan-time corruption investigations to be justice !!, 
  ! 1 , then of course you 'll come to the conclusion you came to . 
  what crackdown ? 
  specifically on general prosecutor , or on regional administration in general ? 
  because [ there were ] ( http://www.rospres.com/corruption/3521/ ) crackdowns on regional administration in yanukovich time . 
  or rather , nobody can prove putin has all the billiards of monies people claim he has . 
  and now they 'll have to kill you ... 
  [ only because the portrait is so small ] ( http://image.zn.ua/media/images/original/may2015/116335.jpg ) :p, 
  no no no . 
  1.8 billions sent to ukraine got lost on its way from the border . 
  corrupt politicians and oligarchs were overthrown during euromaidan , remember ? 
  probably older . 
  this edition of civil codex is from march 2014 . 
  you should repost this as a 1st level thread , it is currently hidden behind the deleted comment . 
  it 's not like political cartoons were ever in a particularly good taste . 
   travel ban to some important people . 
  http://europa.eu/newsroom/highlights/special-coverage/eu_sanctions/index_en.htm * eu nationals and companies may no longer buy or sell new bonds , equity or similar financial instruments with a maturity exceeding 30 days , issued by : * five major state-owned russian banks , their subsidiaries outside the eu and those acting on their behalf or under their control . 
  * three major russia energy companies and * three major russian defence companies . 
  * services related to the issuing of such financial instruments , e.g. 
  brokering , are also prohibited .

  * services necessary for deep water oil exploration and production , arctic oil exploration or production and shale oil projects in russia may not be supplied , for instance drilling , well testing or logging services . 
  and then there 's the full isolation of crimea --------------------------------------------- now , you may not know it , but energy and weapons are large russian exports . 
  finland keeps ` special treatment ' of russia ? 
  obviously . 
  the impact of sanctions russia can put on , say , france , is completely different from the impact of sanctions on finland . 
  eu uses its economy ( puts sanctions ) against russia - good guy eu . 
  russia uses its economy ( puts sanctions ) against finland - scumbag russia . 
  so , what ? 
  russia is supposed to ignore finland sanctioning it ? 
  japan and russia are still at war . 
  never signed a peace treaty after wwii . 
  which is a problem in its own right , as many people never get past reading the comments to actually reading the article . 
  i 've experienced 45 in a very humid south-western russian town . 
  it 's very unpleasant . 
   as you call them . 
  / u/hypetys does , not me . 
   the worst region in ukraine in terms of freedom of speech remains occupied crimea so then why does the map show kiev as being the worst ? 
  no , that was either red blob or yellow-black blob . 
  totaly different . 
  so then we should compare numbers with 2013 and older , before we start talking about `` corrupt muppets for russia '' . 
  2014 is the euromaidan bunch being in power . 
  yes . 
  and zadornov is a comedian whose late career is built on the joke `` they ( americans ) are soooo dumb . '', 
  he 's also heavily into pseudo-linguistical bullshit these days . 
  still , russian government is _ extremely _ harsh on the use of drugs for medical purposes . 
  like , way overboard . 
  as we can see , once all the meddling journalists died , the number of attacks on journalists decreased . 
  i mean , it 's just a coincidence that the number of attacks increased 6 times after the revolution . 
   they are making sketches on mh17 strictly speaking , he is making jokes about us diplomats talking about mh17 . 
  [ was it this one ? 
  ] ( http://cs5.pikabu.ru/post_img/2014/04/13/12/1397418327_1783587994.png ) it 's by the `` russian pensioners ' party for justice '' . 
  the text says : `` russia does n't need marked cards . '', 
  it 's probably safe to say that sherlock holmes tv series is the father of all stereotypes about britons , at least among the people older than 20 . 
  soon , soon , and you too shall be assimilated into the ever-morphing white-blue-red blob !, 
  it does n't really prove anything .
