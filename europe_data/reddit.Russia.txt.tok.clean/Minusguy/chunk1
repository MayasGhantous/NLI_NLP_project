second this, 
  every single one except for moscow , st. petersburg and yekaterinburg , maybe . 
  \u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0447 \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0430 -  golovach lena -  golova chlena translates to penis glans . 
  i think young parents is a beautiful thing but it 's close to impossible due to modern society and lifestyle . 
  my mother was 34 and my father was 26 . 
  i do n't think having me was a good decision . 
  for money in general you can say ** babki ** , ** bablo ** , ** babosiki ** , for 10 rubles -- ** chirik ** , for 50 rubles -- ** paltos ** , ** poltinnik ** , for 1000 rubles -- ** kosar ** , ** kes ** , ** k ** , ** shtuka ** . 
  there 's an immense amount of slang in russian , that 's only what i know of . 
  not at all . 
  tatar names , probably , like elsa or gulnara . 
  i 'm afraid that it 's racist and subjective though . 
  tatar people i know never call their children with non-slavic names . 
  do n't forget vladlena and dazdraperma !, 
  any , basically . 
  as long as you are not a fanatic . 
  i 'm 99 % sure that you ca n't do this unintentionally . 
  i used a public toilet in france and it had an automatic door all covered in shit . 
  i had to wrap my foot in toilet paper and push a small button with a tip of my shoe in order to get out . 
  if paying will prevent this kind of thing in the future then i 'm totally fine with it . 
  however , sometimes you really need to use the toilet but you do n't have an exact coin . 
  somewhat . 
  some of parties are heavily influenced by said american home parties but we have a thing called ** vpiska ** . 
  it 's basically a name for a trashy home party with a lot of alcohol . 
  well , it did happen , but i do n't order ice cream very often . 
  people dance to any music as long as they drunk . 
  drunk moves are ridiculous no matter what . 
  it seems like no european country understands the real motivations behind those actions . 
  i 'm not an apologist and i try to be as neutral as possible , mainly because i know close to nothing when it comes to politics . 
  but i can assure you that russian government has no interest in conquering the world . 
  it 's sheer protection . 
  how exactly did it change the way you view wear , weapons and violence ? 
  i 'm asking because i 'm very anti-war and i realise that i 'm probably not the one who 's right, 
  i personally think it should be a career choice and not mandatory . 
  maybe it will work in sweden , especially given the fact that women are to serve as well . 
  but i know that it does n't in russia . 
  but hey , then again , sweden is a much more civilised country . 
  also , what are the reasons for reintroduction ? 
  it ca n't be good . 
  drink and fight . 
  i believe that all the european cultures are not too far apart , so i identify myself as european . 
  i think every european nation has its ' strengths and weaknesses . 
  smoking is quite popular but it has diminished . 
  it 's now a rare occasion to see a man walking down the street with a cigarette , something that i have seen a dozens of times on a daily basis before . 
  i 'd say smoking is not for bad boys here as well . 
  i 've been to paris recently and i 've seen a whole family smoking . 
  children were in their teens but it was extremely weird to me anyway . 
  georgy zhukov was n't really that good, 
  it 's just too expensive and time consuming . 
  there are people who are vegetarians but they start from upper-middle class . 
  i think it 's 15 is the average . 
  i 'd say moscow state institute of international relations . 
  it 's really expensive to get to study there and you have to score 100 % on state exam to study there on free basis . 
  hint : it 's impossible . 
  circle jerk , to be honest and quite . 
  i love these words . 
  i get the idea and i absolutely love it . 
  i 'm pretty sure that i will move to some small city in the future . 
  living in a city with a population over 1 million is annoying and i never got used to it . 
  thank you very much , have a happy new year too !, 
  you know , i studied psychology for a while to resolve some personal problems and the reason is pretty clear . 
  the amount of subtle brainwashing everywhere is just astounding . 
  people naturally need an enemy most of the time and governments use this elaborately . 
  nobody needs responsible adults that can think independently , it 's not a secret . 
  governments are just playing a game of monopoly , after all . 
  and they use filthy techniques a lot . 
  i mean it would be hard to make a universal agreement for all nations to never quarrel and live happily without threats , propaganda and stuff . 
  but not impossible . 
  but hard enough for no one ever to try . 
  anecdote is a story without any credible source . 
  i believe that russians and eastern europeans just never tell stories that are n't funny , thus the word anecdote is vastly associated with joke . 
  anything other than that is a gossip , a wisdom or a complaint . 
  you guys really like propaganda . 
  i have real sources , not media . 
  everyone puts down russia but they do n't care about their image , do n't feel the need to appear good , they just do what works best for the country . 
  you do n't know many russian people , do you ? 
  they do n't like making choices , ocd is a trait , not illness here . 
  not legalizing self-sex marriage and stuff like that has a very good reason * inside * the country , not just bashing europe , us or doing so because they 're homophobic . 
  you greatly underestimate the intelligence of people in charge because they want you to . 
  they are n't power hungry too ( unlike us but that may be propaganda too ) . 
  these people are strategists , not rulers . 
  well , never thought i was going to say that but fuck poland then . 
  and we 're getting sick from this . 
  anecdote does n't mean ' a joke ' in english . 
  i 've fallen for that too :(, 
  you could n't get it any more right than that . 
  it would be stupid to believe that us is not . 
  it 's like cold war is never going to end . 
  that people who really rule the world are some kind of illuminati clan . 
  they probably do n't hide or hide so well that you 'll never guess who is . 
  i just ca n't believe that intelligent elite of our societies unknowingly behaves like children . 
  they totally know something we do n't know and they know most meaningful event for a couple of years before hand . 
  that , and yes , 9/11 was an inside job . 
  terrorists and isis are funded by other governments . 
  i do n't even find it disgusting or disturbing , it 's just meh . 
  children 's play that 's gone too far . 
  i wish i could imagine what studying russian is like . 
  do you have hard time understanding declensions and genders ? 
  russian ( native ) , english and german to a degree . 
  planning on learning french and some nordic language . 
  -15 to +20 would be perfect,
