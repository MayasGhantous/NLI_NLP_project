  i guess any source is unreliable if it provides news you do n't like . 
  i 'm surprised the thread was n't marked as `` fake news '' , the latest buzzword used to dismiss the opposition worldview . 
  do n't want to put words in his mouth but since there is no reply yet , i have to guess the answer would be something like : `` i do n't agree with russia policies , therefore it 's not europe '' . 
  well , it was a rhetorical question . 
  here 's the thing . 
  / r/europe has to pretend to be free and open , ca n't give out hints of censorship hence threads like this have to be removed . 
  how is it unsourced if it 's a direct link to bbc ? 
  then why am i seeing your bunch on every exam in my university ? 
  the amount of people with tridents on their passports is astonishing really . 
  why do you keep coming here , taking up seats in our universities and enjoying our free education ? 
  why do you keep using this petition website ? 
  the government has stated many time already , if you want to petition then use roi as it 's the only place where only russian citizens can vote and bots are not possible . 
  or is it another one of the useless pseudo-political stunts ? 
  what kind of reason could they give ? 
  `` not suiting the narrative '' ? 
   part of europe in a very broad meaning , much like russia . 
  `` very broad '' , really ? 
  russia is the [ largest european state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe ) taking up almost 40 % of the continent . 
  [ and it continues ... ] ( https://i.imgur.com/wtdnnwe.gif ), 
  and what does it have to do with the topic at hand ? 
   they have the same access like anyone else and it 's free . 
  even for non-eu \\ eaa citizens ? 
   even illegal children have a right for education in belgium but we are n't talking about children , are we ? 
  do they have access to any sort of education though ? 
  is it free for them ? 
  i 'd celebrate such development if not for the history of these regions showing them rapidly turning into sharia shitholes attempting to raid russian towns . 
  those regions are nothing but a resource drain with people refusing to live in a modern world . 
  and they wo n't leave because otherwise they lose all of those sweet federal budget donations . 
  they 're also talking about an [ imaginary stalin ] ( https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/russias-imaginery-stalin-57848 ) . 
   even today , russia still repeats the same `` baltic states voted for ussr annexation '' lie . 
  it 's the first time i hear it . 
  even in the history books in schools it clearly states the chain of event like this : liberation from nazis -  installation of a provisional government by soviet forces -  the said government votes to join ussr . 
  anyone with a half a brain can deduct that the government installed by soviet forces was clearly a communist one and would n't make any other decision . 
   in a recent study 58 % of russians said stalin played very/mostly positive role in history . 
  except when people talk about stalin , they do n't really talk about stalin himself but some imaginary idea of stalin . 
  here 's an [ article explaining what i mean ] ( https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/russias-imaginery-stalin-57848 ) . 
   you know , nearly every family has people who have died because of these named repressions and the same in russian and every other ex-ussr state . 
  you rarely find a family unaffected by the purges , one way or another . 
  even as this article shows , this particular order majorly affected russians . 
  while i 'm not even going to try to downplay the effects of ussr on baltic states , it 's a bit annoying to see how often you people trying to present yourself as the most important victims . 
  i do n't think that people advocating for communism after the numerous failed attempts to implement it would care about any crimes committed by stalin and his circle . 
  would it be 760k or 760kk , communists will find a way to justify it `` for the greater cause '' . 
  ah , are n't we love broad generalizations . 
  [ great terror ( ru wiki ) ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%91%d0%be%d0%bb%d1%8c%d1%88%d0%be%d0%b9_%d1%82%d0%b5%d1%80%d1%80%d0%be%d1%80 ) or [ great purge \\ terror ( en wiki ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_purge ) - is a very specific part of the repressions . 
  i 'm not sure what 's your problem . 
  it has nothing to do with you or baltics in general . 
  is that the problem ? 
  you 're trying to refer to different events . 
  what 's it called ... hmmm ... 
  whataboutism ? 
  not when the article is focused on one , very specific part of the stalinist repressions and clearly states so . 
  simple example . 
  if there is an article about the d-day describing the amount of soldiers killed during the landing by germans . 
  if there is no mention of the eastern front and casualties there , is it whitewashing ? 
  no , he literally stated that it 's supposedly whitewashing . 
  if it 's whitewashing then if it 's `` only '' 760 , not millions , then it 's ok . 
  it 's still not whitewashing . 
  i mean , you have to be a total psychopath to think that `` oh well , it was only 760 thousand , no biggie . '', 
  again . 
   the `` great terror '' is part of the stalinist repressions of the 1920s-1950s . 
  the article talks about one specific order and one specific year . 
  how the hell 760 thousand dead within one year is whitewashing ? 
   `` the great terror '' is a term applied to the period of mass repressions in the ussr in 1937-1938 . 
  the repressions were conducted by the nkvd organs at the direction of the highest party and political leadership of the ussr . 
  victims of repression were both representatives of political and military elites , as well as ordinary citizens . 
  according to researchers , ** more than 1.5 million people were affected by the `` great terror '' ** . 
  * the `` great terror '' is part of the stalinist repressions of the 1920s-1950s * . 
  stated in the end of the article . 
  also , 760 is n't enough for you ? 
  or is it that hard for you people to accept that not every russian is a fan of stalin ? 
  and not everything in russia is propaganda against you personally .

  about how the bolsheviks staged a campaign of repression , the victims of which were more than 760 thousand people - in the review of rbc   july 30 , 1937 was issued a special order of the nkvd \u2116 00447 , which launched a campaign against `` anti-soviet elements '' , better known as `` kulak operation . '', 
  to carry out repression , so-called troikas were formed - extrajudicial criminal prosecution bodies , consisting of three people and operating at the level of the republic , the province or the region . 
  the troika delivered sentences in absentia on the basis of materials from the nkvd . 
  order no . 
  00447 approved the personnel of all 64 triples , which included local heads of state security , party and prosecutorial employees . 
  the decision of the `` troika '' was not subject to appeal . 
    order no . 
  00447 clearly defined the contingent of persons subject to repression : former well-to-do peasants who remained in the village or settled in cities , former members of anti-soviet parties , members of cossack , whiteguard , fascist , terrorist and espionage-sabotage organizations , the most active `` churchmen '' as well as criminals . 
  some of the repressions were carried out against those already in the camps . 
    from the text of order no . 
  00447 : `` the task for the state security organs is to destroy the whole gang of anti-soviet elements in the most merciless way , to protect the working people of the soviet people from their counter-revolutionary intrigues and , finally , to end their vile subversive work against the foundations of the soviet state once and for all '' . 
    all those who fell under the repression were divided into two groups : `` the most hostile '' ( `` first category '' ) , who were sentenced to be shot , and `` less active '' ( `` second category '' ) , who were imprisoned in camps or prisons . 
  the families of the repressed were registered and , according to the decision of the troika , could `` be subject to accommodation in camps or labor villages '' . 
    each regional administration of the nkvd was ordered to repress a certain number of people in the `` first '' and `` second '' categories . 
  `` limits '' were formed on the basis of requests from the regions themselves . 
    the initial plan ordered the arrest of about 270 thousand people , more than 70 thousand of them - to shoot ( including 10 thousand prisoners in the camps ) . 
  in agreement with the leadership of the nkvd and the politburo of the central committee of the cpsu ( b ) , the regions were repeatedly provided with additional limits . 
    as a result of the `` kulak operation , '' the initial quotas for repression were almost three times exceeded , and plans for execution were more than five times higher . 
    according to the nkvd , on the basis of order no . 
  00447 , from august 5 , 1937 to november 1 , 1938 , more than 760,000 people were repressed , of which more than 380,000 were executed . 
  researchers call even more number of repressed during the `` kulak operation '' - 818 thousand people , of which 436 thousand people were shot under the shooting . 
    in order no . 
  00447 , the terms of the `` kulak operation '' were determined . 
  in most regions , it began on august 5 , 1937 , and was due to end in december , but the terms were repeatedly shifted . 
    finally , order no . 
  00447 ceased to be effective until november 17 , 1938 , when the ussr council of people 's commissars and the central committee issued a decree `` on arrests , public prosecutor 's supervision and investigation '' , which terminated the activities of threes and allowed arrests only with the sanction of the court or the prosecutor . 
    in the resolution , the chairman of the council of people 's commissars of the ussr , vyacheslav molotov , and the secretary of the central committee of the cpsu ( b ) , joseph stalin , assessed the mass repressive campaigns , including the `` kulak '' campaign . 
  they rated the results of the campaigns positively , laying the blame for `` shortcomings and distortions '' in the work of the nkvd .
