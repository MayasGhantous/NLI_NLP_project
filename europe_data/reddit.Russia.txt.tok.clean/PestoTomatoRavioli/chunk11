   [ national distribution of people affected by order no . 
  00447 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v53kzyb.png )   from the resolution of the council of people 's commissars of the ussr and the central committee of the cpsu ( b. 
  ) : `` mass operations to smash and uproot enemy elements , conducted by the nkvd organs in 1937-1938 , with simplified conduct of the investigation and trial , could not but lead to a number of major shortcomings and distortions in the work bodies of the nkvd and the prosecutor 's office . 
  the biggest shortcoming in the work of the nkvd organs is the deeply rooted simplified investigation procedure , in which , as a rule , the investigator confines himself to getting a confession from the accused and does not care at all about supporting this recognition with the necessary documentary data . '', 
    organizational issues did not take long , and the names of yesterday 's hangmen appeared in the execution lists . 
    `` the great terror '' is a term applied to the period of mass repressions in the ussr in 1937-1938 . 
  the repressions were conducted by the nkvd organs at the direction of the highest party and political leadership of the ussr . 
  victims of repression were both representatives of political and military elites , as well as ordinary citizens . 
  according to researchers , more than 1.5 million people were affected by the `` great terror '' . 
  the `` great terror '' is part of the stalinist repressions of the 1920s-1950s . 
  lol , what a load of bs . 
  study made by whom ? 
  state-run statistics agency ? 
  or sate-run tv channels themselves ? 
  i mean , all of the kids i see barely watch any tv at all , youtube and social media is the source of information for them . 
  more so , every waking hour they spend in their phones . 
  sure . 
  i doubt it would be enforceable in any country . 
  however , that was n't the point . 
   do n't worry , we are n't going to round up these individuals and ask them to don their rubber gloves and repay the community debt . 
  the real reason behind our experiment is to highlight the lack of consumer awareness when signing up to use free wifi . 
  all users were given the chance to flag up the questionable clause in return for a prize , but remarkably only one individual , which is 0.000045 % of all wifi users throughout the whole two-weeks , managed to spot it . 
  it 's a reasonable point . 
  good , good . 
  let the corruption flow through you !, 
  i especially like the transition from `` i 'm the strongest country '' to `` me and my friend ... '' . 
  it 's like an angry midget in the middle school trying to insight a fight between two larger kids . 
  old news . 
  also . 
   league of safe internet every time i see the name of this organizations i cringe . 
  also like how [ they 're describing themselves ] ( http://www.ligainternet.ru/en/liga/about.php ) . 
   our mission mission is complete eradication of dangerous online content by making the professional community and industry players adopt self-regulation , to avoid censorship . 
  basically `` we 're trying to avoid censorship by enforcing censorship '' . 
  have you even tried reading about her work before throwing retarded statements like this ? 
  unlike many other `` russian opposition activists '' ? 
  she actually lives and works in russia . 
  the grip tightens . 
  the saddest part of it all is that if we get a russian version of [ golden shield ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_shield_project ) , most people wo n't even notice . 
  there are some positive developments among younger generation that are protesting against [ internet censorship ] ( https://newizv.ru/news/society/18-07-2017/meriya-moskvy-soglasovala-shestvie-za-svobodnyy-internet-23-iyulya?ind=1&amp;page=1&amp;show_dt=1 ) but even now we hear voices claiming that the youngsters had their minds poisoned by western propaganda and hence the censorship should become even harsher . 
   a new study has provided perhaps the most detailed look to date on the true state of political and economic play on the peninsula . 
  published by the ** ukrainian institute for the future ** , a new but well-connected think tank based in kiev , the report -- entitled `` crimea : three years of occupation '' -- draws on data from local sources and the analysis of seasoned specialists to paint a damning picture of the human and economic costs of russian rule , and to make a compelling case that the kremlin 's crimean project is a threat to crimeans themselves , as well as to everyone else . 
  i 'm absolutely sure it 's a balanced and unbiased report . 
  not really . 
  if it would be the case , nord stream and nord stream 2 would n't exist . 
   why are you you , who ? 
  me personally ? 
  i do n't do that . 
  as well as many others . 
  i 'm not sure who 're trying to insult , russians or yourself by assuming that every bloody russian thinks the same . 
  and on the figure of stalin , here 's [ great article ] ( https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/russias-imaginery-stalin-57848 ) , which is fairly close to reality . 
   red army no one is praising red army for its numerous crimes . 
  people praise it for averting total annihilation . 
  and again . 
  you treat red army as some sort of a hive-mind or a red blob driven by a singular will . 
  how is it even possible ? 
   banana republic do you even understand the meaning of the term ? 
  also . 
  what my `` banana republic '' has to do with anything ? 
   can eu into anonymous alcoholics group ? 
  well of course !, 
  just fill in this form and do n't forget to specify your name and full address . 
  are we really ? 
  i noticed that the amount of younger people abusing alcohol is significantly lower than it used to be 15-20 years ago . 
  good luck running your factories with `` green energy '' . 
  it 's the best part of any social media . 
  the actual content pales in front of the discussions in the comment sections . 
  actually , it would be interesting to see an actual polish school history books . 
  i know many details are omitted in russian history books when it comes down to ww2 . 
  i wonder if the same is true for poland but obviously with different representation of facts . 
  now , now . 
  russians were the masterrace , totally not oppressed by the communist regime . 
  and even if they were , no one cares because they 're russians and it 's their fault anyway !, 
  [ nothing really new in this part of the world ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b8/breznev-honecker_1979.jpg ) . 
  on the left , obviously . 
   european idea what 's '' european idea '' ? 
  because everything , literally everything in the world , is about russia !, 
  this new and shiny liquid gas seaport . 
  now the us becomes a player on the european gas market . 
  i do n't like this statement !, 
  must be russians !, 
   says a lot , really . 
  what does it say exactly ? 
  because there is no investigation ? 
  i mean . 
  if we go with the ukrainian version , then these were russian servicemen which under no circumstance can be tried under the dutch jurisdiction for this . 
  if these were mercenaries \\ rebels then the individuals are either dead or so far away no one will ever find them . 
  not to mention how are they even planning to identify the people . 
  if they plan to prosecute russia for facilitating the event or militants as a group for perpetrating the crime then it ca n't be done anywhere outsider of an international court ( see kosovo trials ) . 
  have you ever dreamed about becoming a us citizen ? 
  today is your lucky day as for only $ 199.99 you can get a genuine * united states passport !, 
  * not valid in the us . 
  names , give us names . 
  would be better to see who they 're planning to prosecute . 
  probably no one . 
  or maybe they 'll find some poor bastard bystander just to keep face but never convict him . 
  also . 
   whathappenedtoflightmh17.com lol p.s. 
  foreseeing all of the comments : yes , they pay me $ 68 per day for shilling on reddit !, 
  the best part of this post on imgur is the comment section . 
  i 'm mildly surprised with the amount of people convinced that `` russia is not in europe '' .
