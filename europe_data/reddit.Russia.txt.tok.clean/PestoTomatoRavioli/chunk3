  / s there is a significant difference between proxies and army . 
  there was 2 instances when russian military , actually went to ukraine and in both cases ukraine forces were utterly decimated . 
  or rather 3 , the 3rd one would be crimea . 
  even though i condemn my own government for doing it , saying that ukrainian military is in any way comparable to russian is ridiculous . 
  nato is a military block inherently hostile to russia . 
  nato forces are in norway , hence a legitimate target for the nuclear deterrence to keep any hotheads at bay . 
  you do know what deterrence is , right ? 
  not outraged , amused rather . 
  country which builds its entire identity on the idea of opposing russia while can never realistically do anything against it . 
  it 's sad an pathetic . 
  what 's wrong with landline phones though ? 
  because ca n't say russians are doing anything right . 
  they 're evil in everything they do . 
  see a russian eating cereal for breakfast ? 
  you can be sure he 's doing it in an evil way and probably thinking about conquering poland at the same time as well !, 
   revenge pure and simple as i remember reading it from the history books , it was rationalized by demoralization of the enemy . 
  so it 's not a simple revenge . 
  hence multiple ethnic crime groups in every city in the country . 
  oh yeah , i remember that well . 
  no no . 
  al-qaeda are evil fundamentalist muslims , in chechnya there were only brave freedom fighters fighting for democracy . 
  a pole that is trying to slap others with inferiority complex labels , that 's rich . 
  it 's also funny as you obviously ca n't see the irony . 
  ignored ? 
  by ignored you mean portraying islamist nutjobs as brave freedom fighters and pouring weapons and money in to the region ? 
  russia did n't want a freaking [ isis like state ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chechen_republic_of_ichkeria ) at its borders , especially when this state is [ staging attacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_of_dagestan ) and [ acts of terror ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_apartment_bombings ) killing hundreds civilians . 
  what 's wrong about elimination of the enemy combatants ? 
  how is it a crime ? 
  russian military did a lot of shit during this war ( corrupt command coupled with an untrained conscripts ca n't result in anything but disaster ) . 
  however , this particular event ca n't amount to any wrongdoing whatsoever . 
   no , we 're not perfect ... just better . 
  and here i thought all of the \u00dcbermensch were dead . 
  you live and learn , i guess . 
  maybe the same people who 's downvoting [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5a1vsr/bank_of_englands_governor_mark_carney_may_decide/ ) , and [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5a4afd/the_history_of_the_british_isles_every_year/ ) , and maybe even [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/59u774/the_poles_looking_to_leave_the_uk_after_brexit/ ) . 
  so let 's play this game together , shall we ? 
  how much are you getting paid for making baseless implications while the average upvote \\ downvote rate is roughly same in the entire subreddit ? 
  / u/jabadabaduh , you shameless shill , spreading propaganda . 
  someone should make a mod to replace all of the leaders in the game with modern ones . 
  freedom of speech strikes again !, 
  it 's called [ atrocity propaganda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atrocity_propaganda ), 
   just because you 're pro-western , it does n't mean that you 're not a corrupt bastard . 
  of course it is . 
  did n't you get the memo ? 
  all westerners are innocent , peace-loving elves proudly standing against the barbarous orcs from ~ ~ mordor ~ ~ the east . 
  russian aggression in ** syria ** , really ? 
  i find it quite entertaining how all of the experts on everything in the internet have not idea what sootblowing is . 
  edit : a word, 
  yet it 's eu which crying it 's head off every time russia moves its troops ** anywhere ** on its own territory . 
  plebs and aristocracy basically . 
  this is a wig . 
  he 's suffering from cancer . 
  why not ? 
  why would n't chechens vote for him and his party ? 
  he 's showering them with money . 
  i have n't expected anything else from him . 
  i do n't think so . 
  [ turnout ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_legislative_election,_2016 ) was a mere 47 % . 
  basically pensioners , chechnya , most of putin supporters . 
  most of the opposition decided `` nah , no point voting , elections are rigged anyway '' . 
  do n't forget , out of 140m people , 40m are pensioners and these will always vote for putin + united russia . 
  edit : fixed abbreviation, 
  97 % actually . 
  he was . 
  and the `` best '' part of it all is that he 's constantly telling russians how they should n't look for medical assistance abroad because medicine in russia is good enough !, 
  that 's not what i said . 
  not at all . 
  true , i guess . 
  then again . 
  out of 140kk of total population , 40kk are pensioners who are most certainly supporting this rhetoric out of nostalgic feelings , then there is chechnya which is very nationalistic . 
  and ofc there are nationalists as well in other regions . 
  i guess it would account in total for 60kk . 
  then again , considering that on average less than 50 % even bothered to vote this year the picture is getting clear . 
  asocial turk living in the uk ? 
  yep . 
  i suspect most of our political `` elite '' have their families living abroad . 
  imagine something like this in the us . 
  what would happen with a politician who does n't even want his family live in the country he wants to represent ? 
  well at least in the us different clowns come with a different circus shows . 
  some variety at least . 
  it 's usually some local nonsense . 
  i guess local mayors are getting some bonuses if the local population supports putin \\ united russia . 
  plus results from that particular voting station were nullified . 
  believe it or not but people who bothered to vote at all are voting for `` putin '' . 
  i myself saw some old woman asking `` who should i choose to vote for putin ? '', 
  at the voting station . 
  our opposition are a bunch or retards too busy with their own internal squabbling while the electorate is either `` boycotting '' the election , or coming in and stealing \\ damaging ballots . 
  they do n't realize that each unaccounted or damaged ballot will be counted as additional percentage spread evenly among all parties , meaning our opposition in its ignorance is basically increasing the number of seats our ruling party holds . 
  this is what i think most people do n't get . 
  our elections are open and democratic but our opposition is in total disarray . 
  they ca n't even claim they 're suppressed because who 'd even bother suppressing such a useless opponent ? 
   jesus christ , clinton is n't trying to start a war with russia . 
  [ clinton : us should use ` military response ' to fight cyberattacks from russia and china ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/clinton-us-should-use-military-response-fight-cyberattacks-russia-china-1579187 ) [ hillary clinton goes all-in on syria no-fly zone ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-syria-no-fly-zone-third-debate_us_58084280e4b0180a36e91a53 ) and it seems like both of them are [ obsessed with russia ] ( https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/789642611439042565 ) . 
  i 'm starting to wonder if they 're electing a us president or a russian one . 
  if i 'd have to guess it 's because if clinton will start a war with russia as she 's planning apparently , finland will get its share of consequences as well . 
  ideologically yucky , yes we are . 
  also , every time ukraine [ is stealing gas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia%e2%80%93ukraine_gas_disputes ) , eu media do n't hesitate to spin it like its russian fault . 
  for purposes of trolling it should be russian !, 
  yes . 
  yes it is . 
  while the majority of population does n't care about that nonsense and just want to go by with their lives , our politicians and some vocal nationalists are clearly suffering from inferiority complex .
