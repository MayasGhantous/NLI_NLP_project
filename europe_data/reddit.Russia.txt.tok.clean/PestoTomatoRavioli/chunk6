  same with cargo trains filled with cheap ukrainian stuff that people buy when they have no other choice . 
  it 's too bad that ukraine decided against introducing visas for russians , meaning that our government wo n't introduce visas for them either . 
  `` donbass war veterans '' . 
  i thought it 's a counter-terrorist operation , not a war !, 
  considering this entire clusterfuck started with eu disregarding russia utterly and completely , moving further down the same path can only end well . 
  you do realize that what 's going on is that eu tried to snatch a huge market of 40 million people under russias nose knowing well that russian trade standards and rules are fundamentally incompatible with those of eaa , right ? 
  wait wait wait ... 
  i though all of the russian tv is fake . 
  why do you suddenly believe it ? 
  also , still no answer whose tanks ? 
  so [ this is ] ( https://ria.ru/world/20170307/1489430679.html ) outraged ? 
  exaggeration much ? 
  what did you expect them to say ? 
  `` thank you '' ? 
   use google - there are a lot of photos . 
  if there are so many of them . 
  post a few here . 
  because `` use google '' is n't an argument . 
  you make an accusation , it 's your job to support it . 
  also `` i only posted a link '' is not an excuse either as you 're clearly engaging the opposing view in the comments . 
   dnr lnr has 700 tanks - it is more than germany . 
  source ? 
  also whos tanks ? 
  [ ukraine had 6500 tanks at it 's disposal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armed_forces_of_ukraine ) after the fall of ussr . 
  exactly what my post says . 
  avdyivka is almost 100km deep in the ukrainian territory . 
  i see a destroyed city filled with ukrainian military personnel . 
  where are the pictures of the russian units marching through the country pillaging all on their path . 
  it 's not about the crimea annexation it 's about `` oppression and genocide of tatars and ukrainians '' . 
  therefore , comparison to kosovo is actually very relevant . 
  some russian actors will be found guilty on all accounts while those on the ukrainian side will be whitewashed or ignored . 
  because shelling a civilian city is only bad when russia does it , even when there is no evidence to support the claim russian troops did it in the first place . 
  can we finally see those advancing russian troops ? 
  i mean there are so many of them they leveled a city . 
  would be nice to see the actual troops marching towards it as well !, 
  moar fearmongering , need moar fearmongering !, 
  fun stuff , i have n't heard a thing about `` russia being outraged '' about this in the local media . 
  in fact this ukrainian , totally legitimate news source , is the first place from where i heard about this development . 
  go on ... how is it oppression ? 
  edit : heh . 
  ok , i guess downvotes tell me that prime-time tv ass humping ban is anti-gay . 
  alrighty then . 
  edit 2 : i mean , have you even read the link provided yourself ? 
   article 1 of the bill amended on protecting children from information harmful to their health and development with a provision classifying `` propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships '' as a class of materials that must not be distributed among minors . 
  the term is defined as materials that are '' [ aimed ] at causing minors to form non-traditional sexual predispositions , notions of attractiveness of non-traditional sexual relationships , distorted ideas about the equal social value of traditional and non-traditional sexual relationships , or imposing information about non-traditional sexual relationships which raises interest in such relationships insofar as these acts do not amount to a criminal offence . '', 
  article 2 makes similar amendments to `` on basic guarantees for the rights of the child in the russian federation '' , commanding the government to protect children from such material . 
   article 3 of the bill amended the code of the russian federation on administrative offenses with article 6.21 , which prescribes penalties for violations of the propaganda ban : russian citizens found guilty can receive fines of up to 5,000 rubles , and public officials can receive fines of up to 50,000 rubles . 
  organizations or businesses can be fined up to 1 million rubles and be forced to cease operations for up to 90 days . 
  foreigners may be arrested and detained for up to 15 days then deported , or fined up to 5,000 rubles and deported . 
  the fines for individuals are much higher if the offense was committed using mass media or internet . 
  so basically gay propaganda towards minors is a sufficient ground to be ... fined by staggering $ 80 , or $ 800 if done by a public official . 
  except he was arrested not for the flag but because the broke through the fence \\ crowd line and tried to run towards the olympic fire . 
  [ here are more pictures of the event ] ( http://imgur.com/a/pfsfx ) , not cherry picked by euronews . 
  especially [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uw62cqr.jpg ) clearly shows the moment before he was arrested . 
  if you can find a law like this , then yes , cite it . 
  this is the case when the phrase `` citation needed ! '', 
  is more relevant than ever . 
  can you please cite the russian anti-gay laws ? 
   your country has anti gay laws by popular choice . 
  * grabs popcorn * now tell me the relevance between ass humping in prime time tv and a twitter post . 
   bring in thousands of these africans bring in ? 
  really ? 
  cybernetics . 
  or head in a jar !, 
   dude what she did is illegal . 
  do i think that that law is kinda retarded ? 
  sure . 
  you do realize this is a political move . 
  nothing else . 
  right ? 
  i mean it 's fascinating how this sub is all up in arms when our governments does something similar , even when justified but in this case it 's just fine . 
  is it because you do n't like her political views ? 
   on another note , imo you should n't push your political agenda using victims . 
  left or right . 
  you should n't tell that there are victims of a violent death cult encroaching onto your country . 
  shhh ... everything is juuuust fine !, 
  fair ? 
  so , she posted pictures , not redacted , showing reality . 
  she 's prosecuted by telling the truth . 
   ** european union legislators ** have `` overwhelmingly '' voted to lift the eu parliamentary immunity of french presidential candidate marine le pen for tweeting pictures of isis violence . 
  so basically the people who stand to lose the most personally in case of the eu failure . 
  what a surprise !, 
  tell me . 
  what do you think about freedom of speech ? 
  not only you failed to understand the post , it 's frankly amazing how you see the world . 
  everything is good or bad and in opposition to each other . 
  can you spot what 's wrong with this logic : ` putin is bad , hence everyone opposing him is good . 
   campaigning journalist that 's called an activist . 
  if you 're pushing an agenda , you 're not a journalist , as you 're no longer reporting facts . 
   her work has been recognized by both amnesty international the same organization that [ says that trump is literally hitler ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2017/02/22/amnesty-international-compares-trump-hitler/98255936/ ) ? 
   and the russian union of journalists but russia does n't have free journalism !, 
  or does it ?!, 
  because if it does n't then this organization ca n't exist and commend an activist . 
  more so from the article :  open russia , an opposition platform funded by millionaire mikhail khodorkovsky with whom svetova has worked , has said that there are currently two fsb officers and 10 investigators in her home . 
  also worked with the person who [ literally scammed russians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_khodorkovsky#yukos_acquisition ) in 90s and engaged in [ illegal tax evasion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yukos#tax_claims ) later but playing a victim now , campaigning for a violent coup in russia while living abroad . 
  how wonderful . 
   gibraltar seizes russian 's superyacht over german debt claim how is it `` russian '' ? 
  it 's a private yacht owned by a russian oligarch ( read criminal from 1990s ) who keeps all of his assets in cyprus . 
  and the yacht is n't even registered as a russian vessel . 
   valla yachts ltd , a bermuda company , is the yacht 's registered owner right in the article .
