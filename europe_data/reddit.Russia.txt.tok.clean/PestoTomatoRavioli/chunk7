  i see putin and lukashenko are having disagreements again . 
  like in ukraine ? 
  why not !? 
  it 's amazing how much people in this subreddit love revolutions , just as long as they 're not happening in their own countries . 
  do you really want to see more bodies piling up ? 
  clearly lybia , syria , yemen , ukraine are not enough . 
  must throw even more countries into chaos !, 
  where 's the popular outcry about suppressing the democracy ? 
  or is it only undemocratic when it happens in the countries you 're trained to not like ? 
  you asked the question . 
  you got the answer . 
  if you do n't like the answer , it 's your own problem and sarcastic passive aggressive comments are n't going to change the fact that geopolitical relations are n't the same as interpersonal ones . 
  also , 20 years is a very short period of time in terms of history . 
  i mean , you still ca n't forget `` murderous russian barbarians invading proud and peaceful estonia '' . 
   how do you know that ? 
  [ crimean sovereignty referendum , 1991 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_sovereignty_referendum,_1991 ) [ crimean referendum , 1994 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_referendum,_1994 ), 
  meaning never ? 
  the questions is . 
  is the world around ready to alienate russia like this ? 
  it 's slightly different from cuba or nk . 
   have shelled residental areas of avdiivka oh have they ? 
  where is the footage of an obliterated city ? 
  they shelled the road blocked by the ukrainian military . 
  do you even realize what rocket artillery does to a few civilian buildings ? 
  it utterly destroys them with a couple of proximity detonations . 
  i can see that both are against the un law of war . 
  and both parties are using civilians as shields . 
  parking a tank or an artillery unit in a heavily populated area in a war zone is not different . 
  using a residential area as a military staging ground is nothing but using the residents as human shields because they know that the artillery wo n't fire on their parked tanks as long as they 're in this area . 
  the fact that he 's clearly pro-ukraine and such lies can only hurt ukraine itself . 
  by the way , here is the same [ info from osce ] ( http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/297326 )  in violation of the respective withdrawal lines , in government-controlled areas the smm observed : two mlrs ( bm-21 ) moving east on the m04 road in netailove ( 22km north-west of donetsk ) , two mlrs ( bm-21 ) accompanied by a truck with a covered cargo-bay travelling north on the h-20 road 3km south-east of volnovakha ( 53km south of donetsk ) , four tanks ( t-64 ) parked behind a building in avdiivka . 
  edit : word, 
  the entire notion is based on the interview with a ukrainian military officer . 
  it 's as legitimate as asking the rebel commanders about the situation . 
  so far it 's in ukrainian interests to push the offensive while yelling [ `` they 're coming for us ! '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6kkhlx8vu ) . 
  the moment trump hinted a slight possibility of negotiations on sanctions , the conflict started anew , timing does n't make any sense for the rebels or russia as it politically inconvenient for all except kiev that is afraid to be forgotten . 
  i also realize that this entire comment will be disregarded as `` omg , russian troll fake news propaganda lies '' but whatever . 
  are you saying tom burridge is lying in his twitter ? 
   bbc correspondent based in kiev . 
  covered spain 4 years . 
  last year in eastern ukraine a lot . 
  3 months in nairobi covering africa .

  you have n't read the article i linked , have you ? 
  [ human shields in avdiivka : residential area as a staging ground for tank units ] ( https://twitter.com/tomburridgebbc/status/826812407225909249 ) it 's especially interesting as it goes against [ minsk protocol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minsk_protocol#follow-up_memorandum ) funny how there is not story about this , is n't it ? 
   very soon after trump assumed control well . 
  if trump as bad as this sub is trying to portray him , then we the current ukrainian government will see some really hard times soon . 
  probably should 've known their place instead of [ playing in geopolitics with `` big boys '' ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/ukrainian-efforts-to-sabotage-trump-backfire/ ) . 
   uaposition.com tell me more about how this is a legitimate source of information while rt is nothing but lies . 
   editor-in-chief , tsargrad tv i had to google for tsargrad tv , as i 've never heard of it before , and [ was n't disappointed ] ( http://tsargrad.tv/articles ) . 
  have n't seen such nationalistic conspiracy theory insanity mixed with terminal stages of orthodox christianity in years . 
   he did write textbooks for russian military academies no he did n't . 
  that 's some nonsense of unclear origin , probably propagated by dugin himself . 
  his education is laughable and his books were popular among russian nationalists and has nothing to do with military or intelligence . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aleksandr_dugin#early_life_and_education )  he graduated in ** economics and management ** at novocherkass meliorative state academy in the rostov oblast in 1999 , defending his post-graduate ** degree in philosophy at rostov-on-don ** with the dissertation `` the evolution of paradigmatic foundations of science '' in 2000 , and the phd in the ** faculty of sociology ** at the same university in 2004 with the theme `` the transformation of the political structures and institutions in the process of modernization of the civil society '' . 
  in 1998 , dugin , geydar dzhemal , and evgeniy golovin created a study center based on their long time shared interests called the new university project . 
  so many degrees that are applicable and useful in real life . 
   more exposure is he getting any exposure at all in russia ? 
  i have n't heard anything at all about him in ages . 
  russian nationalists are n't as popular as they were 10 years ago . 
   they also issued coins with `` capitals liberated from fascism '' , including bucharest . 
  this is not factually wrong , is it ? 
  what preceded it and followed after is a completely different story . 
  i think checks and metal detectors are taken seriously only in certain places and certain situations , like governmental buildings , national holidays , etc. 
  in most cases it 's just a formality since it 's not possible to check everyone entering moscow subway simply because of the sheer number of people living in the city . 
  except in case of moscow , there are `` lions '' . 
   `` although the creators of the tv series were at pains to stress that the plot is fictitious and allegedly has nothing to do with reality , the film shows quite specific countries , and russia , unfortunately , was given the role of an aggressor , '' read a statement released by the russian embassy in oslo . 
   `` it is certainly regretful that in the year when the 70th anniversary of the victory in the second world war is celebrated , the series 's creators decided to scare norwegian viewers with a non-existing threat from the east in the worst cold war traditions .

  russians are pushing but [ ukrainians are the ones retaking territory ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ny3f4/in_newly_retaken_town_ukrainian_troops_try_to_win/ ) . 
  contradiction much ? 
  point is that pre-election polls are useless and used actively to push agenda of whoever is hosting the poll . 
  russian conscription army is basically a mandatory year long prison sentence for every male between 18 and 27 who 's not smart enough to wiggle out of it , has not enough money for bribes , or do n't have severe health issues . 
  it makes no military sense to have one at this day and age and nothing more than another form of control over people . 
  one year is enough to turn anyone into a brainless , subservient drone behaving and voting in the correct manner . 
  they are not brothers in arms . 
  they are literally inmates as the absolute majority is in there against their will . 
  the last time conscripts were used in an armed conflict was in chechen wars and we all know how well it went . 
  after that only professional branch of the military was deployed in every conflict . 
  conscripts are usually busy digging ditches or guarding football matches by keeping hooligans from trashing the field . 
  ` member how polls showed that trump has no chance of winning the election ? 
  i ` member !, 
   `` the u.s. needs to build better cars . '', 
  bold statement from the people responsible for mercedes . 
  that 's called pr . 
  get to the meat , get to the evidence of hacks and influence . 
  why ? 
  ukrainians are constantly posting news about russia in this subreddit , does it bother you too ? 
  i guess reading is n't a strong suit of yours , try re-reading the comment you 're answering to maybe ? 
  weapons and supplies does n't equate to the actual army . 
  everyone saw russian army in crimea , can you see the same in donetsk ? 
  if so , then why is it still in a state of chaos ? 
  ukraine is good , also a victim . 
  can do no wrong as it fights against russian barbarians for democracy and european values ^ tm . 
  should be loved , supported and protected unconditionally . 
   it 's so western that you have to post a google translate link . 
  it 's polish . 
  are you saying poland is n't `` the west '' ? 
  you do realize that english is n't the only `` western '' language , right ?
