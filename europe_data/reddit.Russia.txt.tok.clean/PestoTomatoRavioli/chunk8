   polish news site posting an article about poles being blameless victims again . 
  against the narrative as fuck . 
  are you accusing them in spreading unjust propaganda ? 
  also . 
  the article about a monument for poles massacred by ukrainians , a monument that was vandalized by nationalistic symbols and blown up . 
  it happened in ukraine . 
  how can you possibly spin as a polish fault ? 
   yeah , when nazis like you come to power around the world , everything suddenly becomes very interesting !, 
  i do n't even know what to say to that . 
  that 's an interesting statement , based on a thoroughly thought through conclusions drawn from indisputable facts . 
  because ukrainians , any of them , can do no wrong !, 
  i absolutely agree !, 
  it 's amazing , is n't it ? 
  it 's a western media outlet , posting something which goes against the general narrative in a very sensitive topic . 
  such topics are always the best here . 
  sometimes / r/europe is very entertaining !, 
  how does it contradict the article i linked ? 
   nice , did you just deny the russian presence in ukraine ? 
  in crimea , no . 
  in donetsk and lugansk , yes . 
  we keep hearing about the awesome russian invasion force and the brave ukrainian army holding the line , while failing to show a single russian soldier . 
  weapons supplies , some old apcs ( painted for a desert environment , seems like leftovers from afghanistan ) , and advisers are surely there , but troops , not likely . 
   you must be getting mad at me , down voting everything i post . 
  you realize it 's not a private chat , right ? 
  oh right . 
  i forgot . 
  those russian subversion cells everywhere . 
  right next to the troops covered by cloaking fields . 
  roughly 900km through the country . 
  through the border or \\ and a warzone line . 
  with explosives in a bag . 
  does it sound realistic ? 
  do you really have such a low opinion on ukrainian military , intelligence and police ? 
  you honestly have no clue what you 're talking about . 
  you 're free to look into my post history to see that this assessment of my political worldview ca n't be further from truth . 
  however , at the same time . 
  in case of russia , more often than not you can see a very clear general consensus branding its political system , culture , people and history as a monolith . 
  and it 's the case with most other countries as well in here . 
  this is why it 's so entertaining to read sometimes . 
  yeah , i 'm entertained . 
  it 's a very interesting contrast in this subreddit . 
  if something like that would happen in russia , the entire subreddit riles up to accuse russian barbarism . 
  however , with ukraine it goes against the narrative and there is a clear dissonance because of that . 
  on one hand , it 's ukraine , the oppressed victim that should be supported no matter what . 
  on the other hand , they 're not without their flaws either . 
  the reaction even in this thread is very interesting to observe . 
   well you seems to like your leader ... that 's reason enough to think that . 
  some do . 
  most indifferent as long as we 're not living in a complete shit anarchy and poverty , like in 90s for example . 
  many do n't support him , however , apathy is strong and these people do n't even bother to vote as `` there is no point '' . 
  a few actively going against him and ready to support anyone who 's not putin , no matter how messed up this other one is . 
  russians are not the single-minded hive-mind nation . 
  i personally believe that in the start of 2000s his influence was positive to achieve at least some semblance of order in this country , but later this iron grip completely choked out any reasonable political movements rendering our political system dysfunctional . 
  russian democracy was very young when it was derailed like that and because of that , it will take years to restore . 
  now we have a system that is bound to go into a complete disarray when there is no more putin . 
  plus again . 
  the reason many gathered `` around '' putin is because he 's promising to `` protect russia from any attempts of foreign forces to undermine it '' . 
  and your politicians are playing right into his hand by supporting and propping up people like hadarkovsky ( an oligarch from the 90s . ), 
  or navalny ( mostly despised russian nationalist , rich corruptioner pretending to be against corruption ) . 
  these are only a couple of the most prominent examples . 
  there are many more people supported by `` the west '' yet despised in russia . 
   so what if they are ? 
  have you ever lived with communists in charge ? 
  my parents did , they hate them all even 2 and a half decades later . 
  it 's insane and while they might be better than isis , it 's not by a huge margin . 
  edit : a word, 
   obvious russian provocation and you know it how ? 
  or is it a simple conclusion , because otherwise it goes against the narrative , against your political worldview ? 
  edit : typo, 
  no , but denying that there are hardliner nazis in ukraine is as foolish as exaggerating their numbers . 
  all it takes , a couple of radicalized kids . 
   then again , you ** do ** ? 
  and , are we ? 
  we never claimed that we know what 's best for everyone . 
  well . 
  you 're claiming it was done by a random russian as some sort of a diversion . 
  because how could [ the peaceful , all loving , totally not nationalistic ukraininas ] ( https://www.yahoo.com/news/thousands-ukraine-nationalists-march-kiev-193807371.html?ref=gs ) do something like that ] . 
  are you even reading what you 're typing ? 
  by the way , it 's extremely cold right now in ukraine so they 're wasting more gas than planned , will have to buy more . 
  is it a russian ploy as well ? 
  that 's my point . 
   controlling huge part of ukraine really makes it really difficult to get into other parts of ukraine . 
  if this happened in eastern ukraine obviously this could n't be linked to ukranian neonazis right ? 
  it 's 900km away from crimea or donetsk . 
   aliens ? 
  by your logic putins dogs did n't poison litvinenko with radioactive shit in uk too , right ? 
  because how could they get there ? 
  yeah ... [ right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_litvinenko#russian_criminal_investigation ), 
  totally . 
  russians went to ** western ** ukraine to blow up a monument . 
  tell me , do you believe in aliens visiting earth ? 
  we 're not the ones proclaiming ourselves to be the enlightened saviors of the world , are we ? 
  bravo . 
  it did n't take long to blame russia . 
  i mean , praising upa and all sort of hardcore ukrainian nationalists is totally not a thing in ukraine . 
  it 's all rt hoax , right ? 
  i saw it before in its entirety . 
  and this is why i 'm asking you to support your statements with solid evidence . 
  it 's not hard , is n't it ... ? 
  again .
