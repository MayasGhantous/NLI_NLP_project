   the report of ** 17 us intelligence agencies ** confirms it . 
  and while you at it , you can also cite evidence . 
   just trying to figure out the logic . 
  tbh i think it 's a question of cultural proximity , geographic proximity , and level-of-democracy proximity . 
  the reason here is plain and simple . 
  it 's 6 million ^ tm . 
   sorry we may have failed you and now you live under a kleptocracy that you seem to like for no reasons for some reason you think russians are unaware of the state of their own country . 
  also , one thing that many foreigners tend to misunderstand is that most russians still remember the oligarchs robbing the country blind under happy approval of many most prominent western politicians . 
  remember yeltsin ? 
  he was insanely popular among the us and eu politicians and extremely unpopular among the general russian population . 
  in addition , there is a fine line between liking the putin government and disliking his opposition even more . 
  we 're de-facto autocracy that made sure that de gaulle scenario wont happen and no one wants another violent revolution , 2 in a time frame of less than 100 years is too much already . 
   the people that wanted a democracy in syria are somewhere between lebanon and canada . 
  you mean people who decided to abandon the cause or leave their own country to be ravaged by islamists ? 
   we diplomatically failed , big time . 
  we 're only fighting isis now because it is an immediate threat to us and tbh i 'm not even sure that we ( france ) are giving weapons anymore to the rebels ( except the kurds ) . 
  no one was fighting isis in syria . 
  what was taking place before the russian-iranian intervention is called funneling . 
  basically attacking isis in a such a way drive them in the direction you want . 
  also kurds , your fascination with them is surprising . 
  you do realize that they 're zealous communists , right ? 
  interesting measurement of a human life value , the place of origin . 
  how uneuropean of you . 
  and in this case , why are you ( eu ) is complaining your head off while talking about syrian civilians allegedly killed by russian strikes ? 
  here 's one more way to look at this . 
  there were [ 33 terrorist attacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_terrorist_incidents_in_january_2017 ) in this year alone , yet all except this one went unnoticed . 
  it 's a nice gesture basically saying `` we value some people and disregard others '' . 
  the sentiment that is in direct conflict with the proclaimed `` european values '' . 
  by the same measure , russia is `` culturally close '' to germany . 
  australia is an ex-british colony . 
  same language , same religion , same people . 
  israel , different language , different religion , different ethnicity . 
   not geographically close , but definitely culturally ( western influence ) . 
  in what way are they close ? 
  western influence is not an answer . 
  too broad and not specific . 
  can you name similarities uniquely linking germany and israel ? 
  alrighty then . 
   the report of ** 17 us intelligence agencies ** confirms it . 
  can you link the said report and name these ** 17 ** agencies . 
  `` google it yourself '' is not a valid answer . 
  is it geographically close to germany ? 
  or is it culturally close , and if so , in what way ? 
  yep . 
  tell it to yemen . 
  i wonder if you lost '' / s '' somewhere along the way . 
  are you going to proceed with sad stories about poor benevolent `` white helmets '' , are n't you ? 
  as well as brave rebels fighting for democracy . 
   if you were truly a `` conservative realist '' ( seems to be the position you want to take ) , you would recognize the immense strategic benefits to the west if his regime collapsed . 
  nice to hear such war cries from the person bitching about russia and its atrocities all day long . 
  now , now . 
  everyone knows that the flood of refugees is caused by russian barbaric military campaign . 
   it 's more devastating for the countries they 're all flooding to because now we have to support them . 
  not really . 
  the word you 're looking for is `` deportation '' . 
  i wonder , why have n't they done the same for [ bahrain , algeria , burkina faso , central african republic , pakistan , nigeria , iraq , syria , afghanistan , philippines ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_terrorist_incidents_in_january_2017 ) ? 
   so the fallout from this should be good . 
  like what ? 
  those who think about pepe as a `` green frog of white supremacy '' are already smearing shit all over russia all the time . 
  nothing is going to change . 
  how is it not racism again ? 
  evidently , you . 
  you do realize that by `` russia military '' they mean some rear echelon pr `` general '' , right ? 
  i doubt that actual military gives a damn about some french magazine . 
  interesting way to present counterpropaganda . 
  if the government says it 's going to filter information it sees fit , that 's terrible censorship . 
  i the government says it 's going to fight fake news by deciding what 's fake and what 's not , no problem !, 
  condemn your political opposition by employing the very same means you 're condemning them for . 
  in russia it 's `` public knowledge '' that nato wants to bomb russia by libyan scenario . 
  public knowledge without empirical evidence is nothing but hearsay and speculation , often exploited by politicians . 
  good job , you managed to reduce yourself to the level of russian propaganda . 
  trolls , elves ... someone need to grow up . 
  which sources ? 
  unnamed sources as usual ? 
  it 's useless in terms that no one really takes it in consideration but it 's definitely not as retarded as change org because in case of change org one person could post as many votes as needed . 
  plus [ tools like this ] ( http://thebot.net/threads/release-change-org-bot.124796/ ) make it truly useless . 
  my point is that the site suggested above has as much value as a google forms survey , meaning zero . 
  have you tried voting during the last election ? 
  you know , the one with the lowest turnout ever . 
  have you bothered protesting or otherwise voicing your disapproval of the situation in the country somewhere outside of the internet ? 
   also the pursued goal of most petitions is not to influence the state directly ( as it 's deemed practically impossible ) but to spread the message , and roi that requires days of time and some legwork to register a gosuslugi account is a terrible tool for that . 
  takes [ literally a few minutes ] ( https://esia.gosuslugi.ru/public/ra ) if you live in a big city . 
   you could n't pay me enough to even visit your soviet reunion yet you 're here talking about something which is happening in the soviet reunion . 
  also , if you hate it so much , then why are you [ so concerned about crimea ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/5hczyu/russia_threatens_retaliation_over_latest_round_of/dazmd4o/ ) . 
  why not reject it and strip away all of the leftovers of the monstrous soviet past ? 
   lots of isis members have russian passports are you equating ukrainians studying in russia to isis ? 
  that a very interesting comparison . 
   so now you have me wondering why your bunch keep beheading people you do n't like . 
  [ probably ukrainians ] ( http://mirrorspectrum.com/info/anton-gerashchenko-supports-isis-in-their-fight-against-russian-military ) who got russian passports for the sweet sweet russian pensions . 
  it 's even better . 
  you 're the one who has no idea about the russian education system or institutions , yet making baseless assumptions while smearing nonsense all over the place . 
  yes . 
  essentially assisting our corrupt politicians in laundering money they steal from the country . 
  basically , accomplices in the crime . 
   let human nature do its job so basically lawless anarchy . 
  because that 's the humans ' nature . 
  i wonder , when will people realize that these `` tax heavens '' are basically stealing money from other countries ? 
  not really . 
  he 's a ukrainian complaining about russian education , while tens of thousands of his kin are studying in russia . 
  why ?
