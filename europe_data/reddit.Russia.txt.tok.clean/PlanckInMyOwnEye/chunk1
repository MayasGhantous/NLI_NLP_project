when you 're telling about hate for sweden you 're making distinction between ` russia hates ' and ` the russians hate ' , right ? 
  because maybe what you say may be near truth for russia 's attitude as a state , and maybe those in politics really feel something like that ( i do n't have any evidence supporting that , it 's just that i wo n't be surprised if that is the case ) . 
  but the ordinary russians do n't feel any hate towards the swedes as far as my experience goes . 
  i believe , you are wrong . 
  according to mavise database by european audiovisual observatory ( http://mavise.obs.coe.int/company?id=8973 ) sole owner of ano tv-novosti ( legal entity for rt ) is the government of the rf . 
  it 's not a new line , however . 
  sapsan utilises the same old line of railroad that ordinary moscow-st . petersburg trains use . 
  that 's one of the reasons why the speed is not really high for sapsan . 
  there were plans ( www.eng.hsrail.ru/vsm-1/hsrail-1/ ) for new high-speed railroad line , but the project had last updates many years ago with no real progress made . 
  basically , it 's scrapped until better times along with all the other high-speed railroad projects . 
  i find this article and the title somewhat misleading . 
  first comes the title about making friends , and the author mentions the `` finding friends '' subindex , then he leaps to ` friendliness ' subindex , lists the rating for it and produces the map for it . 
  note that there are two different ratings for these subindexes , the one for ` finding friends ' being entirely different from the one used in article ( ` friendliness ' ) . 
  i did find the original survey ( esp . 
  pages 32-36 , `` ease of settling in '' section ) , posted by u/autoclismo here in the comments much more informative and relevant . 
  i 'd say it was a bit disturbing to see what looked like a bunch of kids on the [ 20th photo ] ( http://www.delfi.lt/veidai/zmones/skandalingieji-keule-ruke-reze-aikteleti-priversianti-rozini-protesta.d?id=71591726#!dgs=dgslt-221430:6802720 ) in that kind of setting . 
  the adults can do all the want , but do n't drag kids into this . 
  however , that is not the case for the orthodox priests ( like in greece and orthodox balkans ) . 
   orthodox priests consist of both married clergymen and celibate clergymen . 
  in the orthodox church a married man may be ordained to the priesthood . 
  his marriage , however , must be the first for both him and his wife . 
  he may not remarry and continue in his ministry even if his wife should die . 
   if a single , or unmarried , or celibate , man is ordained , he must remain celibate to retain his service . 
  a celibate priest is not necessarily the same as that of clergymen who are monastics , as celibacy does not automatically entail monasticism , though orthodox monasticism does denote a call to celibacy . 
  a priest-monk is called a hieromonk . 
  approved by lavrentiy beria, 
  `` such suspension will be lifted if incidents of a similar nature ( crowd disturbances ) happen inside the stadium at any of the remaining matches of the russian team during the tournament . '', 
  that happened outside , so i do n't think so . 
  yeah , he definitely is , also , he is a son of [ vladimir zhirinovsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_zhirinovsky ) , one of the most odious mps in the parliament and leader of the [ ldpr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal_democratic_party_of_russia ) . 
  needless to say , they are both in the same party . 
  neither of them are to be taken seriously , really . 
  just another ugly face of irresponsible populism . 
  why ? 
  we wo n't have to worry about hosting this show , wo n't have to hear about how we did n't deserve to win , wo n't have to see yet another event where taxpayers ' money would go down the drain . 
  i 'd say i 'm perfectly fine with that . 
  actually , i 'd be even happier if we stopped worrying about the contest altogether , and would just send some funny performers like buranovskiye babushki all the time . 
  thanks for the reply , even though i 'd still be grateful if u/zetzet answered me as well . 
  but speaking of the data linked by yourself , how do you think , is a minority comprising 1.3 % of total population enough to push someone to the third place in voting ? 
  you 're implying there are so many russian emigrants in georgia or finland ? 
  did i understand you correctly ? 
  or are they that much more active in voting ? 
   russia has far less internet exchanges than the netherlands . 
  i 'm not saying you 're wrong and would probably agree that russia needs more internet exchanges , but could you please support the cited claim with actual info ? 
  because i tried to look for it , and found this [ list of ixps in wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_internet_exchange_points ) based on peeringdb 's info that seems to contradict what you 're saying . 
  heh , and i meant pastries from denmark in general . 
  now do n't you dare say there 's nothing special about them !, 
  yeah , better feed them to death with easter cakes and junk food like those [ good-hearted supersmart people of rostov ] ( http://www.rostov.kp.ru/daily/26528.4/3544834/ ) did , right ? 
  but i really do love danish pastries , how come it 's a bullshit ? 
  that 's the reason most of the educated/well-mannered russians prefer to travel outside of the large groups of russian tourists , and try not to give their russian identity away . 
  not sure it helps , though . 
  your family , relatives , friends still would ( i hope ), 
  it is , but i have to note that the huge illuminated spot you see is not just moscow but rather its metropolitan area with all the satellite cities , while the city herself is the brighter area inside . 
  oh , i 'd be happy if there was a better solution to this problem and it had been taken in due time . 
  sadly , by some moment the only choices were between different types of , as you call them , `` bloody warlords '' . 
  if you believe in possibility of stable democracy ( or you had some better ideas of how we could have escaped the aforementioned dichotomy ? ), 
  in chechnya , i fear you do n't take into consideration a lot of substantial factors . 
  also , my initial statement was not of `` but at least he 's not islamist '' type . 
  i merely pointed to the fact that he has nothing to do with salafism , that 's all . 
  it goes both ways ( if not the other way around ) , as salafists are saudites ' puppets , who were all too happy to get their hands on chechnya in '90s and promote their version of faith ( complete with their political influence ) in exchange for military support . 
  actually , i think most of the gods including egyptian , sumerian , greek or norse are more or less like that . 
  as much as i * am not really fond of * kadyrov , he is n't a salafist , and follows a branch of sufi islam . 
  in fact , he actually proclaimed war on salafism/wahhabism . 
  nevertheless , sympathy towards russians through years was ( ' 12-34 % , ' 13-31 % , ' 14-25 % , ' 15-22 % , ' 16-20 % , ' 17-31 % ) . 
  similarly , antipathy peaked in ' 15 - '16 at 50 % level then came back to '13 level of 38-39 % . 
  that 's kinda strange , why ? 
  i mean , drop in attitude after ukrainian events was understandable , the perceived warming however is a bit weird . 
  interesting , i 've looked at the report , and from fig. 1 `` zmiany nastawienia wobec naszych s\u0105siad\u00f3w -- \u015brednie ocen * '' it 's part of more general trend in which attitudes towards many neighboring nations surged this year . 
  no worries , i actually do like the polish people and i 've met that kind of opinion ( russians ok , russia ( state/rulers ) awful ) from them often enough to believe it 's genuine . 
  i 'm not sure i can find that stance consistent , but it 's still nice . 
  also , i think if you want moscow/mordor pics , the ones from space at night are pretty close . 
  most of what is filmed in this video was dagestan , already a very problematic region as it is . 
  nearly all of the main slavers that you could see here were ethnically non-russian , judging by their grammar and accent ( dagestani are a bunch of different north caucasian , muslim nations ) . 
  full scale operation might a ) raise independence movements in north caucasus b ) raise ethnic and religious tension throughout russia c ) give rise to neofascist/nationalist movements ( if you 're going full war on those scumbags , you 'll have to show something like this video on tv , guess how the ordinary folks might react when you open their eyes on such problems ) . 
  i 'm not saying it all ends on dagestan , and that none of the russian people are to blame . 
  probably every russian ( even ultrapatriotic and ultraconservative ) knows our cops are freaking incompetent ( while that in the said circles is usually blamed on liberal legacy of the 90s ) . 
  but i 'm like 99 % percent sure , that if you show that video to a 1000 russians , in most cases the culprit will be identified as 1 ) caucasians as the whole , dags specifically ; 2 ) too much liberalism in national policies . 
  that 's kind of pandora box to open . 
  i think on that photo moscow looks more like [ isengard ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=lord+of+the+rings+isengard&amp;tbm=isch ) . 
  really , mordor is n't that snowy , has a giant flaming volcano and ominous mountains on all sides , also does n't share that circular-radial planning layout . 
  but yeah , in terms of stereotypes i guess moscow will always be mordor for the poles . 
  we need more responsible owners of course , but even in moscow pet waste removal infrastructure is practically nonexistent . 
  also , [ reprimands and punitive measures alone are n't really working , education is very important as well . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/12/why-cant-french-cities-clean-up-after-their-dogs-montpellier ) it 's a complex problem and must be solved strategically . 
  also , you ca n't really expect dog owners to be fully responsible about their shit , when the same place has lots of garbage lying around . 
  at least that swan was n't gay ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ badumts, 
  to be fair we can be . 
  most of the time we are n't , but if you 've hit a nerve with someone , sure why not , it can be hell unleashed . 
  might be because of politics , football , history , business , etc. 
  especially possible in informal setting . 
  but usually , yeah , we will be pretty calm, 
  trying to play the devil 's advocate here : if st pete was called `` the window to europe '' was it not regarded as not a part of it ? 
  but yeah , doubt that the person above had any idea . 
   nemtsov ( the younger ) erm , there was no nemtsov the older , only one . 
  maybe you thought that the comment above was about him ? 
  if yes , then it was not , it was about kara-murza junior and senior . 
  it was already covered immediately after the incident ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5skhzh/putin_critic_who_said_he_was_poisoned_in_2015/ ) , so it is against subreddit rules as well . 
  as for the age of the news , r/europe 's limit is three months , so if it was n't a duplicate , it 'd be a fair game . 
  i also do n't see any rule that would require to reflect the change of the time frame in the title . 
  that does n't mean you 're not right to point to the fact , of course . 
  no offence .
