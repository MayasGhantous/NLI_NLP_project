  another category are the ones who are regarded pretty neutrally here , but are known as butchers to some regions they were assigned to , like some of the generals or marshals of imperial or soviet times . 
   french-speaking swiss ( especially in the army , but also elsewhere ) are sometimes called `` russians '' why 's that ? 
  at that point it was so obvious what a most popular answer would be , i 'm wondering if that can be considered a loaded question . 
  what 's the point of even asking ? 
  ca n't think of one , sorry , there 's a wide variety of pet peeves of all sorts , but hardly one that is valid throughout the country . 
  can add my personal pet peeve about russia ( at least , it 's in the spirit of some of the answers here ) . 
  i 'm pretty irked when i find russia in the asia section of a list/map/website selector section/whatever . 
  yeah , i get it that we 're not a true european nation for many people , but we 're even less asian . 
  last example , [ this thread ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/books/comments/6o7wn0/the_most_iconic_book_set_in_every_country ) . 
  seeing tolstoy listed in the * asia * section ... ugh ... btw , why the question is about the pet peeves , but in examples you talk about passion/craze for stuff ? 
  i thought * pet peeve * is something that is especially annoying , not liked ? 
  speaking of something like `` german craze for asparagus '' , i think many of those europeans who visit russia are sometimes confused by the amounts of dill we use in our cooking ( esp . 
  in simple local restaurants ) , whenever it 's needed or not . 
  oh , and the outrageous russian mayo ( now that 's more about home cooking ) . 
  and yet , a missed opportunity for a triple trigger spelling it czechnia, 
  and there i was , preparing to answer why russia/ussr lost status as a super power , only to find your text inside . 
  to be fair , i think we are a major global power , but not a superpower now . 
  [ wiki article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superpower ) seems to show that my words agree with the academic consensus that usa is the only true superpower in the world , while china and russia are in the list of `` potential superpowers '' . 
  it also seems that there is a point of view that superpower as a concept is outdated in increasingly multipolar world . 
  if that 's so , i 'd say good riddance , as the term is as toxic as `` an empire '' of the past . 
  also , usa really seems to lose its grip as a superpower , in a number of ways . 
   higgs-boson boson is not a surname , it 's a type of particles , not need for a hyphen . 
  i believe when the online video game markets ( mostly speaking about steam , but the other ones too like gog.com , ea market , etc. ), 
  became comfortable enough to use , in comparison to pirating the stuff , a large portion of russians ( if not the most of them ) switched to buying games online , iirc . 
  i believe netflix just had a very bad timing to enter the russian market , plus had insufficient promotional campaign . 
  had they started expanding earlier , before the ruble sunk in 2014 , and had they used a smart campaign to get people on hook , they could have pulled it off to some extent ( young wealthier city-dwellers , mostly ) . 
  now , people are in the economy mode mostly , and with that pricing , at that library quality that they 're offering in europe in general ( as i see from many answers here ) , and russia specifically ( [ here ] ( https://www.finder.com/netflix-usa-vs-world-content ) they state that russia has ~ 10 % of us library ) , their chances are low . 
  especially , given there are local competitors either with major series titles in the library or are just cheaper , or those services that have ad-based monetization . 
  in case someone does n't know , to call someone `` chmo '' in russian means to insult him very gravely . 
  god forbid you say something like that to a lower-class ( in sociological kind of meaning ) person or even worse , to a person with a criminal record ( or that kind of attitude ) . 
  but even for a someone who knows better than to start a fight immediately , that 's very serious . 
  it 's reserved for people of extremely low morals , contemptible or despicable . 
  other than that , i can add that in moscow region/oblast ' ( not moscow itself ) people were mostly common workers , it 's hard to imagine them to be epitome of smugness . 
  actually , for even a more or less common person from moscow to go for a vacation to lithuania or latvia was a kind of marvel , as the standard of life and the available food were better than in moscow . 
  that 's what i heard . 
  i guess , for those of foreigners who know about varg , his criminal record and his role in black metal ( and his stance on religion as well ) are closely linked . 
  heh , it seems i 'm not alone to have fond memories of that game . 
  i believe fate of atlantis was one of the best games in my childhood !, 
  nah , it 's more cultural . 
  like 6 or 7 colors ? 
  if 7 , is blue considered the lighter one ( sky blue/light blue/azure ) or the darker one ( dark blue/indigo ) ? 
  google translate is quite bad at that . 
  what i find particularly strange , the state does n't seem to have any problem with this . 
  there are all kinds of talks about increasing birth rate , limiting abortions , limiting contraception , and at the same time , introducing new reasons to deny parental rights , deny adoption rights to certain categories of people , that it seems like lawmakers do n't even want this number to decrease ps . 
   state foster care provides the kids with an apartment when they graduate from what i 've read , they put them ( at least a significant part of them ) in queue for this apartments , which can take years to actually happen . 
  maybe what i 've read is outdated , but it seems likely . 
  there 's airforce and rvsn too now . 
  look at how many allies we got !, 
  once you get your ass fined once in the middle of a travel , you become more inclined to get that damn ticket right . 
  got caught in prague once ( forgot to validate the thing ) , decided to play by the rules afterwards . 
   k\u00f6nigsberg ( now known as kaliningrad ) would probably love to come back . 
  well , if cities ( not people ) can think , it might be possible , as soviets/russians have n't been treating him ( ? her?it ? ), 
  that nice . 
  otherwise , russians make up strong majority of city 's population , while there 's less than a percent of germans . 
  what 's more , many of these russians have military background and , from what i 've heard , are pretty patriotic . 
  so , it 's a very big question , if people of kaliningrad would want the city `` to come back '' . 
  i understand your initial question was more about the branded food , while the folks here speak mostly about food types . 
  ca n't think of brand differences , so i 'll just stick to the recipes . 
  * kotleta in russian is usually fried minced meat croquettes/patties , while cutlet in european sense is usually a kind of a meat slice . 
  * kompot in many countries closer to the eastern europe and slavic influence is a kind of a soft drink made by boiling the fruits , dried fruits and/or berries ; compote in countries closer to western europe influence is a kind of dessert . 
  * marmalade in europe is usually understood as a kind of fruit preserve ; marmelad in russia is usually a kind of fruit jellies ( more or less , p\u00e2te de fruit ) . 
  * [ pierogi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierogi ) in polish is a kind of filled dumplings ; while in russian [ pirogi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pirog ) are different kinds of baked yeast-raised dough pies/pastry . 
  well , from that neighbor 's point of view , vergina sun * is * the [ flag of macedonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_macedonia_ ( greece \\ ) ) . 
  idk , russia was always considered a very drinking country , but i 'm coming from moscow , where it 's much less noticeable . 
  also , as our economy got a heavy blow since 2014 , i feared that i 'd start seeing drunkies everywhere , but it feels like it 's either on the same level or even less ( alcohol of the same quality got more expensive , while the wages in roubles have been stagnating , so it became less affordable ) . 
  but in the regions , i fear , the situation might be worse . 
  illegal everywhere in russia except 4 special designated areas since a law came in effect in 2007-2009 ( see [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gambling_in_russia ) for more info ) , which was a weird one . 
  however , lots of poorer folks got into troubles before that , if they had some gambling addiction . 
  i 'm not sure if they 're better off without their slot machines , or they 've found another way to waste their money for nothing , but i have n't heard of gambling victims ever since . 
  before that a lot of gambling venues ( from slot machine halls and poker clubs to posh casinos ) were around . 
  the gambling areas i mentioned mostly never took off , really , part of it because travelling to the middle of nowhere just to relax gambling is n't in our national character , part of it , because with all the regulations in place , to try investing in it seriously was a super high risk venture , nobody wanted to start a business there . 
  however , just today stumbled upon a [ ny times article ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/world/europe/russia-vladivostok-gambling-casinos.html ) that something started to take off in the primorye area ( far east russia ) , because of the chinese investors and chinese tourists . 
  but even then , i 'm pretty skeptical about it . 
  bookmaking was not considered gambling under the said law , so the betting shops are still around ( pretty regulated still ) . 
  unfortunately that feels like he was equating all the people not exactly fond of 90s in russia to tiblas . 
  does believing that it was a very hard period for many russians and that criminal situation was pretty horrific make me soviet-minded lowlife ? 
   you very rarely , if ever , see it used for any random russian just today saw it from your fellow estonian redditor on r/europe , trying to convince us that 90s in russia were n't all that bad ( you know who i 'm speaking about ) . 
  how would you translate `` tiblade vigisemise '' , btw ? 
  well , as they say `` you do n't get to choose your family . '', 
  that kinda sucks , that your family oversteps the line after which you do n't feel comfortable , and it might be better if you explained how you feel to them . 
  maybe they do it out of their vision of care , because they feel like you 're missing out on the possibilities that come from networking with people with the same heritage ? 
  or it 's not about your heritage language , but general language learning ? 
  also , if my vision of your problems is correct , it 's probably seen as an act of defiance to their culture , which is why it 's met with that kind of aggression . 
  anyway , there are different ways how you can handle it , either you tell to yourself that you do n't want to learn languages , because you do n't want to . 
  or you can learn it , but in your pace , in the ways that are comfortable for you , and only because ** you ** want to ( because you yourself understand how you 'd gain from it , not because other think so ) . 
  setting goals that are fulfilling someone else 's vision rarely does any good , imo . 
  idk , if i sound like a clueless armchair philosopher/psychotherapist , but that 's how i feel about it . 
  have you tried learning languages from different language families , from what you were expected to learn by your family ? 
  do n't take it for prying , please , but could you tell , what languages have you tried learning ? 
  so , you live in the uk ( or us ? 
  ) , speak english but have some asian blood , right ? 
  it 's that what you mean by `` look like i should ... '' , did i understand correctly ? 
  and who exactly is laughing ? 
  why do you care ? 
  people have different talents , some are talented with learning languages , others are better at different stuff . 
  if you feel like you 'd better concentrate on what 's important to you - why should you distract by learning a language you do n't need ? 
  are people expecting you to speak some language because your ancestors were speaking it ? 
  i 'd think she 's not exactly right in the head , tbh . 
  interesting , never encountered that one in russian before . 
  probably it 's more known in the regions closer to ukraine/belarus .
