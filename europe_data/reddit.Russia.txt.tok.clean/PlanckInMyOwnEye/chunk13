   the sound of polish \u27e8 y \u27e9 is often represented as / \u0268 / , but actually it is a close-mid advanced central unrounded vowel , more narrowly transcribed [ \u0258\u031f ] [ [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/close_central_unrounded_vowel ) ] listening to examples of polish y in wiki or on forvo , sometimes it sounds just like \u044b , sometimes sounds a bit off . 
  overall , it sounds milder . 
  i believe in moscow/st . pete 's percentage must be higher , so unless you want to explore the regions , it should n't be that bad . 
  oh , please , everybody already hates salade russe, 
  heh , if i were a hawaiian , i 'd probably think of inventing some sort of outrageous pizza with maple syrup and poutine and call it * pizza canada * in retaliation . 
  a tropical paradise in the middle of the ocean . 
  weird language of the native population . 
  * lilo & stitch . 
  other than that , i guess , i do n't know much about hawaii . 
  therefore not much to think about . 
  other than maybe `` it might be interesting to visit some other day . 
  but judging by my finances , it 'll more probably be * some other life * '', 
  it 's hard to say , as somehow hollywood is n't that keen on importing russian actors ( maybe they are n't keen to go to hollywood too , but that 's another question ) . 
  there was [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3dqvji/why_are_there_no_russian_actorsactresses_in/ ) in r/movies some time ago , about why there are no hollywood actors from russia and i did n't see many good answers , tbh . 
  so , probably because there are no good parts for them , or because they 're not good enough for it . 
  if you can remind me of something i forgot , i 'd be happy to hear it . 
  ps : i do n't count yelchin as his family emigrated when he was a small kid , also i did n't get much of a feeling from one of his earlier interviews that he wants to be associated with russia . 
  idk , you might want to try sort by controversial , then sort by top . 
  i believe it shows some kind of a pattern . 
  askanamerican is not only for americans too , officially , however it 's pretty much dominated by the americans . 
  also , ask europe is whatever its community wants it to be , as a pretty much self-regulated group . 
  therefore the way the votes are made shapes what kind of `` ask europe '' it is . 
  i first thought it was about russians in estonia ( or at least latvians , given the guy 's name was valdis ) . 
  but otherwise it 's implied here they are estonians , right ? 
  ( `` we 're estonians in estonia '' , other guys ' names , their proficiency in estonian , etc. ), 
  so , you have your own estonian gopniks or my initial thought was correct ? 
  also , the story was nice , reminded me of idiot by dostoevsky somehow ( not all of it , but in some regards ) . 
  to each their own . 
  what would you rate above it from the recent animated shows ? 
  some say , gravity falls only start to develop really in the second season . 
  but they are quite different in many regards to rick & morty . 
  gf is produced by disney , so it 's a family show ( just that a good plot and references make it interesting for some adults too ) . 
  r&m is adultswim iirc , so it 's pretty obscene , absurd and sarcastic . 
  zis iven saundz layk rashn inglish tu mi ( yes , ay nou , rasha not yurop for sam of yu , bat ay stil apruv ) !, 
  `` lets mi spik from may hart , in inglish ! '',

  this is i guess the second time i 've seen references to medzhuslovjanski jezyk on r/askeurope , and this time it 's even easier to read . 
  however , i feel like it 's easy to read because this text was meant to be an easy introduction . 
  also , i 'm not sure if some knowledge of other slavic languages / some words from them helps me . 
  i wonder what would a russian without any functional foreign language knowledge say about this text ( for example , some of the elderly people ) . 
  as for practicality , question was already raised about its spoken form . 
  i also suspect that to read it would be much easier for me than to write/compose/speak it myself . 
  i 'd still have to learn it as a foreign language . 
  plus , i dislike the usage of diacritics in latin form ( i can understand them , but i 'd need to do something about my keyboard in order to use them , and even then i 'm not used to them ) . 
  and the cyrillic form has its natural disadvantage - the latin users would never bother to learn it in mass . 
  one more problem ( not really serious , but still bothering ) - inherent `` false friends '' that already are present in slavic languages . 
  for example , ovoce as fruits in czech , and ovoschchi , vegetables in russian ; cherstvy [ variations of it ] as fresh in czech and stale in russian and polish ; and so on . 
  as i checked the dictionary , it looks like in most false friends i checked , medzhuslovjanski is closer to czech . 
  lol . 
  you forgot / s. 
  for non-russian speakers ( so , the most of you ) , title of the page says : `` the capital of the fugly architecture '', 
  btw , u/nuffnuffnuff , as people here are making contributions in their home languages too , could you post the original verse , how it sounds in lithuanian ? 
  but it 's nothing like a limerick , more like a chant, 
  seriously ? 
  in like 90s-early 2000s it was kinda ubiquitous , now slowly fading away i believe , but still happening from time to time . 
  ah , ok , good , there 's something in the wording that led me to the wrong idea ( or i 'm too tired , and shall go sleep now immediately , lol ) . 
  handshake to a man , bisou to a woman sounds perfectly ok for me, 
  your folks do that too ? 
  i thought that 's mostly the russians ' old habit . 
  do they do the bise to men ? 
  quarreling in the public space , rush ~ ~ b ~ ~ into the bus/metro train , not replying to a greeting , not holding a heavy swinging door for someone passing right after you so the door will probably smack them at full speed , not thanking after you helped with a door ... errm , ok , there 's more , but i 'd rather stop . 
  yeah , i 'm pretty irritable . 
  on the bright side , for me it seems people 's manners in moscow improved a bit in the last decade or so , or it 's me that got calmer . 
  well , but they started to integrate after all . 
  just have some patience and give them some time , i guess . 
  you yourself said earlier about the proportion of integrated russians :  plenty of young people , very few middle aged or old people . 
  many young people are so integrated you may find out years later that they are russians ( mind the name , a good number of estonians have a russian surname due to some russian ancestry ) . 
  but it political differences are very strongly in correlation with accent strength . 
  no accent usually means no political difference from estonians , slight accents can go both ways and strong accents and especially no language knowledge at all make up politically very pro-kremlin people . 
  and youth is the future . 
  i guess i 've heard it on the radio / in random venues quite a lot of times , so it must be pretty popular . 
  just now i checked some of the main pop radio stations , and it tops the charts , apparently . 
  lol , that 's awful . 
  \u266a \u266b * triggering , triggering * \u266a \u266b someone even made an [ analysis ] ( http://blogs.transparent.com/russian/swedishrussian-eurovision-skit-tingaling/ ) of it , from the philology point of view . 
  depends on what question we 're speaking here . 
  sometimes i do , sometimes not . 
  i usually try to find a balanced view on things , so that might count as yes for some , and no for others . 
  also , i have reasons to question the point of view that is presented as prevalent opinion in my country , at least the degree of prevalence . 
  but reaching out to thousands ( that would at least allow for some statistics ) or , all the more so , millions of fellow russians , sadly is too difficult . 
  ah , a perfectly logical explanation it is !, 
  i should look more into estonian humor , it seems . 
  i hope it 's as absurd as this one . 
  my interest in history reawakened only recently . 
  in school , we got a decent history teacher only in our last two years , and before that the lessons were quite dull . 
  then i got into the university , and had my hands ( and head ) were full with other stuff to think about . 
  of course , i was still gathering some random facts here and there , but was n't really serious about it . 
  last years i found pleasure in reading more of the history books , so it 's getting better i guess . 
  interested in rus ' history , russian history and roman republic for now . 
  yeah , i get it . 
  but what 's the story about it , the origin of this joke ? 
  western are so cheerful , though , just wanted to dance when heard them . 
  they might be simpler , but they 've got soul . 
  anyway , i loved both styles . 
  never cared enough to check his bio , though . 
  til . 
  where does that one come from ? 
  lol , learn to read . 
  not 99 % of us , but 99 % of our time for some of us ( and that number is obviously \u0432\u0437\u044f\u0442 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0430 ) . 
  reading media is obviously not a first-hand experience , just as listening to relatives/acquaintances . 
  i 've heard people praising far east russia , and people basically saying it 's a shithole , and that goes for media coverage as well .
