  that goes for chechnya reports too , btw . 
  i 'm just saying that having a different vision on that is pretty normal . 
  that coming from 4-day old account already flooding r/russia ? 
  interesting . 
  but i know another r/russia poster once noticed rezajafari mentioned his emigration , and in next post on r/askeurope that user already shouted that reza should not be believed because he 's not living in russia even . 
  you guys are awesome , like hivemind or something . 
  but your point is quite weak , as an ordinary russian might not travel in russia much . 
  hell , many of us wo n't step out of our home region for like 99 % of our lives . 
  a guy is wrong in his statements - ok , correct him , and present your version . 
  but please , stop with that ` no real russian ' , ` shills everywhere ' campaign . 
  no idea , you tell me ( i have problems removing spanish from portuguese ) . 
  probably strange sibilants , distinct hard ( and sometimes trilled ) ` r ' sound plus weird soft versions of consonants with lots of vowel variants ? 
  i 'm especially curious about the answer from others , as so many answers are like ( probably something something mixed with russian ), 
  and in that interpretation it feels very much like how the majority/mob/collective / the state is speaking to an individual person in russia . 
  i guess , it has to do with what in geert hofstede 's cultural dimensions is ( do n't really like the term , but whatever , his research - his terms ) called [ feminine culture ] ( https://geert-hofstede.com/national-culture.html ) . 
  difference here is that nordic countries are typically individualistic at core , while russia is collectivist . 
   masculinity versus femininity ( mas )  the masculinity side of this dimension represents a preference in society for achievement , heroism , assertiveness and material rewards for success . 
  society at large is more competitive . 
  its opposite , femininity , stands for a preference for cooperation , modesty , caring for the weak and quality of life . 
  society at large is more consensus-oriented . 
  in the business context masculinity versus femininity is sometimes also related to as `` tough versus tender '' cultures . 
  i meant [ warhammer 40k ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warhammer_40,000 ) : a series of tabletop games , and all related stuff . 
  a key figure there is a certain god-emperor of the mankind . 
  ok , last try for me to guess , if i may ask : if not warhammer , has is something to do with god emperor of dune ? 
  is your username a reference to wh40k 's god-emperor ? 
  it has to do with a certain pledge to myself i 've given when i decided to make an account here . 
  can you figure out which one ( yes , i like riddles ) ? 
  well that , and a tryhardish pun that was supposed to twist the meaning a bit . 
  [ ` the black knight always triumphs !!!, 
  have at you !!!, 
  ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr4wf6aacqc ), 
  you should n't be , what you added was important , it 's my wording that was ambiguous . 
  sure , i did n't mean they were * independent * as in * unrelated * , just that they were politically and culturally independent in the time frame i mentioned . 
  also , around the ix-xii centuries there was also volga bulgaria , completely independent from the actual one . 
  modern tatars ( at least some of them ) believe themselves to be descendants of volga bulgars . 
  yep , and it was , by some accounts , the third most severe conflict in the xx century ( ~ 9-10 millions victims , including battle casualties , terror victims and hunger/epidemic casualties ) , right after the two world wars . 
  it reminds me of strugatsky 's [ snail on the slope ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snail_on_the_slope ) and a [ certain haiku ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kobayashi_issa ) that inspired its name . 
  not necessarily muslims , i 'd say , but people closer to the caucasian region and to a lesser extent central asia ( so , the closer to the southern border , the more ) . 
  i mean , armenians are not muslims , but are pretty avid players , while i 'm pretty sure the game is n't that popular for the muslim tatars , for example . 
  also , \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0434\u044b ( nardy ) is a name borrowed from persian . 
  also , we have two main variants of nardy , short and long . 
  short nardy game is a bit more dynamic , and is closer to the game of backgammon , with initial setup of pieces in different cells , and with ability to hit enemy 's pieces . 
  long nardy are played from a single first cell on one 's side and does not allow for hitting another player 's pieces ( so , closer to tapa or gul bara that op mentioned ) . 
  is trapping allowed or not differs from party to party , but it does n't change the name of the variant . 
  i know a variant where trapping is allowed only after a player has moved a single piece to his home , for example . 
   malaka  malakas ( greek : \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 ; greek pronunciation : [ ma . 
  ` la.kas ] ) is a greek slang word , with a variety of different meanings . 
  the meaning varies depending on the tone and context used . 
  it can be an exclamation of pleasure , an expression of dark horror , a cry of anger , a paean of affection , and other different things besides its literal equivalent , which in british english is `` wanker '' . 
  [ 1 ] common alternative meanings include `` asshole '' or `` jerk '' , and the contrasting `` dude '' , or `` mate '' , depending on the context . 
  [ 2 ] it derives from the greek word malakos ( \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ) , which means `` soft '' or `` spoilt , well-used to luxuries of life '' . 
  [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] it is one of the most frequent words picked up by tourists ( often in its vocative case form , i.e. 
  ` la.ka / ) and travellers to greece and is not unusual amongst the younger greek diaspora , even when the level of greek is low . 
  a female form of the word exists , malako ( \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9 ) , but is a recent coinage , whereas malakismeni ( \u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 ) seems to be rather more vintage . 
  well , dude meaning confirmed , but i still have my doubts about parents of so ... 
  however , this one is quite obscure , it 's not really popular ( i ca n't recall anyone using it , really ), 
  idk , but sometimes i feel like extending apehood to some persons ... ( just in case , this feeling is race-independent ), 
  how many people should protest to be qualified as russian civilian public ? 
  i 'm pretty used to call it czech republic in english , czechia however is shorter and more practical . 
  i 'd say , it 's better to have both variants around , with cr as a formal name , and czechia for everyday use, 
  and takes notes ... , 
  if russia somehow balkanized , it 's definitely not an optimistic scenario . 
  you 'd have a bunch of hell-angry rumps warring with each other ( ps : and probably not just with each other ) . 
  in the optimistic scenario ( let 's assume it is optimistic not only for you , but for us as well , and we 're not in catastrophic state ) , i still think it 's not a good idea ( in eu 's current form ) . 
  maximal possible association/cooperation , might be a good idea , but full membership would break everything for both sides , in my opinion . 
  one tip : just remember that lithuania and poland were together in the commonwealth ( they 'd probably need to be neighbors for that , right ? ), 
  nay , not garbage , it really helps out in case of more popular , better covered languages . 
  at least to the degree when you can understand what 's going on in the text . 
  but it does choke on many other languages , that 's for sure . 
  it 's something in lithuanian , i believe . 
  probably something about adding ( as friend or something like that ), 
  well , they do n't get russian accent right 90 % of the time either . 
  that 's not just americans though , it 's now a global ( or at least english-speaking world ) meme . 
  and for that we can thank our dearest dota kids . 
  tbh , i have n't seen balalaika jokes from americans in ages , so it 's more like our stereotypes of their stereotypes . 
  ca n't remember losing electricity in moscow for many many years . 
  [ dachas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dacha ) on the other hand , lose it pretty often , for the same reason you mention ( occasional fallen trees cutting off the lines ) . 
  as they mostly serve recreational purposes and people are n't living there constantly , they are quite reluctant to switch to underground power lines . 
  ah , that 's tad better . 
  just do n't let them play with fire , lol, 
  if your neighbor would constantly threaten to kill you one day with a big-ass knife he 's carrying around , you 'd probably see his behavior as aggressive , would n't you ? 
  are you sure your kid wo n't hate you after hearing `` wake up , neo ... '' and other stuff like that for a hundredth time in school ? 
   ... but i really do n't like the `` fanclub '' of that country ... you mean , norwegians that like finland ? 
  or european `` fans '' too ? 
  what 's wrong with them ? 
  https://www.afisha.ru/msk/theatre/15882216/# yep, 
  cinema ? 
  you mean former pushkinskiy cinema , former rossiya cinema ? 
  it 's not cinema anymore , it 's a musical theatre . 
  problem is that a language is a complex structure , and some of the features that differ automatically imply other grammatical structures to be chosen . 
  namely , is the language analytic or synthetic , and to which degree ; is the word order fixed or not , etc. ? 
  as different languages evolved differently , their structures have different natural necessities . 
  well , those examples are quite rare and i 'm pretty sure could be solved by choosing a different wording/structure for the phrase , in case the context does n't solve the ambiguity already . 
  i mean , in russian , your example with spears and merkel would be totally possible and as ambiguous as you said , but that does n't stop us . 
  maybe it 's because while the word order is not fixed in russian , but the `` direct '' word order would be assumed by default as most likely ( is it the same in czech too ? ), 
  also , in russian in some cases even the male foreign surnames would not be declined ( mostly ending with vowels , but depending on is it stressed or not and some other rules ), 
  idk about estonia , but pretty sure modern russian system is the same as the soviet system . 
  so , 1 was never really given but 2 was a very real perspective for a bad work . 
  but 2 was really shameful to get , there 's even [ this well known soviet painting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/low_marks_again ) , which in russian is called '' \u041e\u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0430 '' ( grade 2 again ), 
  really , it 's reserved for very special moments ( like , obviously copying another 's work , and failing even at that ) .
