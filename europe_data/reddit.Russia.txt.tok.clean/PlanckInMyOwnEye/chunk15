  usually , even assignment not done was `` 2 '' , iirc . 
   someone could confuse me for a russian and put a bullet in me [ who knows that might save you from a bullet instead ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orisc764nn4 ), 
  heh , i 'm usually excited enough to learn that a foreign ( european ) person speaks russian ( i mean , really speaks , not tries to read something for the first time ) , so i guess they 're all nice for me . 
  so , it 's actually that rare that comparison is n't really possible . 
  however , i 've heard a few baltic people speaking russian , and their accent can be quite nice ( disclaimer : these were some very nice girls , therefore i might be biased a bit ) . 
  american website with international community . 
  it 's around 60 % of young people of 16-24 year bracket , the rest are older , according to u/tonygaze 's link , so * a bit * more than just `` sprinkled in '', 
  my bad , i 'm blind , apparently . 
  moscow has moscow river together with a system of reservoirs and canals ( moscow canal , connecting moscow to volga river provides about a half of the city 's consumption ) . 
  history of that system is pretty grim , as it was one of the main gulag projects , so we in a sort owe it to the victims of the great terror . 
  before the hydrotechnical improvements were built , moscow had problems with water supply sometimes , iirc . 
  now , it 's more than adequate . 
  pretty close , but something 's not quite right ( like if he was a russian from some remote region or one of the soviet republics ) . 
  but i 'm not 100 % sure either . 
  plus i had a great difficulty deciphering the `` pickle '' word, 
   1565 did you mean 1569 ? 
  could n't find anything relevant about 1565, 
  definitely !, 
  however , after some further googling , it comes out that the relationship is false , as at least modern etymology traces slavic sladky to the same origins as salt : [ wiktionary ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sladk%c3%bd ) :(, 
   sadhbh  sadhbh ( also spelled sadb , saibh , sadbh , sadhb ; anglicised sive or saeve ) is an irish feminine personal name . 
  derived from proto-celtic * s\u016d\u0101d\u016d\u0101 ' ( the ) sweet and lovely ( lady ) ' interesting : s\u016d\u0101d\u016d\u0101 looks quite similar to our ` sladkiy/sladkaya ' ( sweet ), 
  hey , dublin is okay as it is . 
  just look at lublin . 
  ah , right you are , i thought about it later as well , thanks, 
  thermal expansion would still be proportional to the amount of substance or volume . 
  so , mediterranean , cut off from the atlantic ocean should have lower steric rise than being connected to it , do n't you think ? 
  just a first result from googling : apparently , [ it 's a thing , it 's called steric rise ] ( https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/411.htm ), 
  moscow , love-hate relationship . 
  btw , there was a discussion about the american exceptionalism on askeurope about two months ago , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5z8ilg/what_do_you_believe_the_term_american/ ) . 
  i believe the answer to your question was quite evident there as well . 
   empty land in the east ahem ... 
  there 's a * subtle * difference between weak and empty ... 
  thanks for the recommendation . 
  i 'll give it a try . 
  he looks like a guy , who 's really in love with polish culture . 
  i hope it does n't take a toll on the impartiality of the narrative , though . 
  period/aspect ? 
  i believe , the formation of the medieval political system of poland is the process i 'd like to understand better . 
  do you mean , the period after grand duchy of moscow became political center of russia and the golden horde was shaken off , but before the russian empire was proclaimed ? 
  or in more broad sense , monarchic autocracy in russia , including all the russian emperors as well ? 
  i really want to read more about history of poland . 
  i feel like there might be some keys to our history as well , given centuries of antagonizing each other and fighting for dominance in the region . 
  next come probably the histories of the byzantine empire and lithuania ( pre-commonwealth mainly ) . 
  and roman history is fascinating as well . 
  ps : it would be great if someone could recommend some main works on polish history : either entry-level overview works , or main chronicles . 
  come on , maybe it 's time to stop killing poland ? 
  we 've done it few times already . 
  well , jokes about killing each other might be funnier for the american states than for the european countries . 
  cause , you know , you can never be sure when they are n't really joking . 
  yeah , moscow is quite hard to appreciate as a tourism destination . 
  it 's a world on its own , with its hidden gems and overrated attractions at the same time , with ugly monsters built in beautiful neighborhoods sometimes , or unexpectedly nice places hidden amidst some dull surroundings . 
  so , you either love moscow ( then , you * might * find it beautiful in a way , and still , not guaranteed ) , or not ( then , you 're guaranteed to find it quite unattractive ) . 
  not sure if that 's a * dumbest * nimby issue , but people protesting against new mosques nearby are quite close . 
  thing is nobody gives about the locals unless it goes along with interests of someone of power , then the opinion of the locals will be supported and presented as the major factor . 
  if i got u/schwertritter right , he does n't say babuszka is a proper polish word , just that it would sound so , * if * it were a polish word ( correct me if i 'm wrong , please ) . 
  anyway , compared to the examples in this post , misplaced stress is such a mild offence that it should n't even bother , i guess . 
  yep . 
  russian cheeses ( not all , but the most of them ) are horrendous . 
  and they got a lot worse after the * countersanctions * ( less need to worry about the competition anymore ) . 
  however , by some definitions of cheese , tvorog could be called a cheese itself . 
  if so , it would be the most eaten , i guess . 
  idk , i 've met a number of europeans for whom that exact word was one of the few words they knew in russian . 
  yes , in that exact pronunciation . 
  and yes , i guess it means for them that stereotypical russian elderly woman/granny in headscarf, 
  you could write every russian word with even the basic latin , of course ( with apostrophe at least ) . 
  thing is , czech alphabet is tailored for czech , and our languages , even while both slavic , are still quite distant . 
  serious discussion within russia ? 
  no , i do n't think so . 
  cyrillic script is an integral part of our language and culture . 
  i ca n't imagine dropping it , as it would mean cutting ties with more than a thousand years of our history ( the way i see it ) . 
  and even while there are many things in it that ought to stay in the past , that would be simply too much to ask . 
  unesco [ atlas of the world 's languages in danger ] ( http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php ) currently names ** 131 languages ** in russia as different levels of vulnerable/endangered/extinct , including : * 20 vulnerable * 49 definitely endangered * 29 severely endangered * 22 critically endangered * 15 extinct that of course includes different varieties of the same language in some cases , and 20 of the vulnerable i would n't call dying at all ( i.e. 
  chechen , ingush , some other major north caucasian languages plus major siberian languages like yakut ) . 
  but even as the higher estimate it shows the scale of the problem . 
  we use cyrillic alphabet , but i believe we have no problems with latin alphabet ( except maybe some old people ) . 
  but we are n't going to drop cyrillic for latin under no circumstances , that 's for sure . 
  however , that 's the english name of it , its russian name can be translated as * tale of the bygone years * . 
  i ca n't say i come across just * \u0411\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f * ( britain ) often . 
  for me , it 's either * \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f * ( velikobritaniya , great britain ) - it 's also used as the official name of the uk in russian ( for example , it 's what the embassy of the uk in russia uses ) , or , colloquially , just * \u0410\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u044f * ( england ) . 
  however , if you read primary chronicle a bit more carefully , you could argue that it would rather be oleg . 
  as when it was spoken about rurik 's period , rus ' there was always mentioned in context of the varangians only . 
  also , under his reign first documents of diplomacy of newly formed state appeared , while rurik never made it to documented contacts with other nations ( ps : diplomatic contacts , as there were documented raids of rus/ros people before oleg 's times ) . 
  need to add that many sources only include two brothers : lech and czech . 
  also , our main chronicle , [ the primary chronicle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/primary_chronicle ) makes no account of that story . 
  i do n't know about ukraine and belarus , but in russia probably nobody would count some legendary rus to be a founder of the old rus ' . 
  that 's a truth nobody really denies . 
  the devil is in the details , as always . 
  there 's a never-ending discussion about molotov-ribbentrop pact , and many of us have thought many times about it and went through multiple discussions regarding it , also not that it is omitted from our history lessons , but a ) it is again a decision of soviet leadership , not the people b ) can be interpreted in many ways , and is quite a difficult historical question as it is , given all the context - demanding an easy answer for it quickly degrades the discussion to shouting and mutual blaming . 
  you can find a [ plenty of related discussions ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/search?q=molotov-ribbentrop&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) on r/askhistorians ( for example , you might find [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/4vm87q/why_didnt_france_and_britain_declare_war_on_the/ ) interesting ) . 
  i hope i did n't sound like stalin apologist in this reply , i understand the grievances and accusations of the nations that were victims of our domination in the region , and can say that i personally feel sorry about the way they were mistreated , but i humbly hope that people could understand our point of view too . 
  but to be fair , most of our muslims do n't wear turbans , so sikhs would probably be recognized as tourists , i guess . 
  or at least , as indians . 
  also , there was an article about sikhs cultural centre in moscow i 've read few years ago . 
  welp , i thought rivalry is something that is supposed to be mutual , also distinct from enmity , more about competition than of being an enemy ? 
  btw , no i do n't think of the finns neither as rivals nor as enemies . 
  i mean , i know we have bad blood but i certainly wo n't count relationship with finland as one of the worst . 
  i think all or almost all of them are capable of speaking russian to some extent . 
  and not enough contacts with byzantium , i guess . 
   the area that is now belarus and ukraine were a country called the `` kievan rus ' '' . 
  plus western part of modern russia , naturally .
