  novgorod was the second most important settlement in rus ' , the axis of rus ' was basically route from baltic sea to the black sea ( `` from varangians to the greeks ) through novgorod and kiev . 
  also , continuing to answer the question by u/thisisverytemporary , it 's worth noting why by the times described above rus ' was orthodox already . 
  originally a slavic paganism country , rus ' of course had many contacts with neighboring nations , among which were other pagans , catholics , muslims ( volga bulgars , for example ) , judaist khazars and , of course , orthodox byzantium ( also , bulgarian empire ) . 
  constantinople was the main trade destination , it had formal diplomatic relations with rus , was seeking military alliance against some of the common rivals , not to mention that it was rich and culturally superior . 
  so , while the legend goes that knyaz vladimir was choosing from catholicism , islam , judaism and orthodoxy and had chosen the latter because of the beauty of culture and the reasonable rites , the political importance of byzantine empire was the main factor , i believe . 
   give him his finger and he will grab your whole arm yep , checks out for russia as well . 
  the only difference is ( a bit weird ) , in our variant it is `` he 'll chomp/bite off your whole arm '' \u0414\u0430\u0439 \u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0446 , \u0430 \u043e\u043d \u0432\u0441\u044e \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0443 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0438\u0442 . 
  another similar is * \u0414\u0430\u0439 \u0441 \u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043a , \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u0441 \u043b\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043a * -- give him by nail 's measure , he 'll ask up to the elbow ( something like that ) . 
  japan and china from the top of my head are the most interesting for me . 
  maybe the usa too , if there 's a good opportunity for it . 
  preserve our nation / whole human civilisation for as long as possible . 
  just not perish because of our own stupidity ( both as nation and humanity ) . 
  ensure that our successors wo n't live in a post-apocalyptic world . 
  be prepared for any global cataclysm in the way that ensures the above-mentioned points . 
  pretty boring , i know . 
  galaxy colonisation comes as a consequence . 
   people love to be called lions usually they love to call their children , though, 
  do you have a higher education , btw ? 
  wow , that 's a sad story , if true - stay strong , man !, 
  world is full with racists , but screw them . 
  however , i have a question for the finns here - given the op 's comment history and everything said in this post - does anything strike you as weird/implausible/not finnish ? 
  you 're probably speaking about tanning in booths/tanning beds/solariums ? 
  cause i do n't think that there 's anything that stops men from tanning on a beach or even on a deckchair at their dacha . 
  well , i guess i 'll link to [ that little exchange of opinions ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6786sc/russian_pov_of_russia/dgoxo3k/ ) here on reddit , to elaborate a bit on moscow-regions relations . 
  also , please , make note of the request that you can find in reply to reply ( about the use of word province ) - i think the word * provincials * is even worse in that regard . 
  i wonder which iranians among the caucasians do you mean ? 
  you know nothing , jon snow !, 
  depends on what you mean by it . 
  first , siberia/far east russia is perceived as a domain of immense untouched nature . 
  we might think it 's hard to live there ( the climate is a bit of a problem ) . 
  population density is very low . 
  so , it 's viewed more like an outpost of civilization in the overall hostile environment . 
  as for people , i believe we perceive them as the exact same russians as anywhere else . 
  from my personal experience , i 've met a few people from siberia and from far east . 
  if i was n't told about where they came from , i 'd never guess . 
  just ak-47 or all ak 's ? 
  we call them * kalash * here , btw, 
  interesting , if that was in the original or that was how translation ( was it in polish ? ), 
  was handled , as i ca n't find any quote supporting that . 
  while it looks quite similar and is probably the most widespread hair colour for us , the word itself does not stem from rus ' / russia . 
  however , what if the person in question told you that religion for him is not about the legendary/mythic story , but the lifestyle and the ethical system itself , preferring the not-literal reading of the bible , for example ? 
  actually , russian is full of so many languages , we really like borrowing terms , just adjusting them to our language structure and phonetics . 
  we have loanwords / word stems from latin , greek , turkic , english , french , german , dutch and many more . 
  of course , there is some resistance when something new is introduced ( which can get pretty comical where instead of some english-based term the valiant defenders of the language remind us of some older word , omitting that it is a loanword itself but from another language ) . 
  however , * kolache * is a form of a word common to many ( if not all ) slavic languages , descending from proto-slavic . 
  for example , in russian we have [ kalach ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalach_\\ ( food \\ ) ) , which is quite different from the czech kolache , but the word is pretty much the same, 
  babushka , matryoshka , balalaika , tsar , pogrom , soviet , intelligentsiya , troika , beluga some of them have non-russian roots but reintroduced from russian version because of cultural context , like caesar \u279c tsar or intelligentsia . 
  one can take advantage of someone without direct usage of force : manipulating , lying , or giving an offer that is too hard to turn down . 
  main attributes are coloured eggs and [ kulich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kulich ) , a type of easter bread . 
  eggs are coloured either with food colourings , or more traditional way : boiled with dry onion skins . 
  in southern russia , instead of kulich [ paska ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paska_ ( bread ) ) is used , it seems , so that 's closer to rites of ukraine , romania , etc. 
  in central/northern russia there 's another [ paskha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paskha ) instead , made of tvorog ( approximately quark , curd cheese , but a bit different ) . 
  i 'm from moscow , we here generally settle for coloured eggs and kulich and just a table of ordinary good food . 
  first ones , the incorrigible bastards , second could be ok if they were n't so russian in their minds , do i get it right ? 
  i thought about uk too , yeah , i agree from few time spent there , it feels like `` peach culture '' too . 
  very polite and generally friendly in common interactions , but hard to really get to know . 
  yeah , i already get that there are problems with locals ( btw , from your experience , what is approximately the proportions of well integrated russians ( willing to learn the language , follow the local political discourse rather than russian language media , maybe other criteria that are important in your opinion ; or just generally tolerable at least ) to those that give bad reputation ? 
  as for tourist , i believe because estonia was n't considered a tourist location of such scale as lithuania/latvia since soviet times , the ones that go to estonia are generally more open-minded maybe . 
  less artifacts of the old times in their heads , more conscious interest in the actual culture ? 
  it 's like their might be a number of filters that apply to estonia that keep you out of the bad tourists ' sight . 
  sorry , guys , our tourists can be utter cunts , especially those that do n't understand how to behave in civil society . 
  we hate them too , really . 
  i just do n't know how that situation can be improved , because there 's too many of us . 
  also , being quite an atomized society does n't help too . 
  danish people can be pretty much of peach culture , imo ( no offence danish folks , that 's just my impression ) . 
  can be really friendly and nice , but superficially . 
  it 's hard to understand what 's really going on inside their head/heart . 
  also , maybe italians too . 
  how do you think ? 
  yeah , sadly , we have a lot of stupid kids/guys who ruin it for everybody , for normal people as well ( things like normal people getting autokicked from bf servers just because of ru flag ) . 
  are they the majority or minority ? 
  who knows , it 's hard to tell . 
  from my point of view the smarter mature guys just wo n't play dota/lol . 
  i 'm not a moba player myself , so , i 'm not too reliable as a source of info , however . 
  what i 'm sure is that if the problem is indeed with the kids , their parents most likely do n't even know what they 're playing or how they behave . 
  other people , just ca n't even do something with that problem . 
  for example , i do n't know any cykablyad players , how can i improve their online etiquette in that case ? 
  lol , i remember friends in school smuggling floppies with adom to it classes, 
  damn , it 's hard to choose ... really , they 're so different , and each has something unique to them . 
  seriously , if i had some awesome brain enhancer that would let me learn all of them quickly , i 'd totally go for it !, 
  i 'd separate major languages because their image is much stronger in most of the cases , so they 're more familiar . 
  without english i simply ca n't live , french is a language of glamour to me , german is calmingly regular , italian can be quite melodic , etc. 
  then there are slavic languages , which will always have a special place in my heart . 
  i do n't really believe in slavic brotherhood as a political and cultural idea , we are really different in many ways ( and i 'm not even speaking of historical implications ) , but our languages is something that brings us together still . 
  as for appeal ( subconscious and aesthetic ) , there 's something about swedish that makes it sound beautiful to me . 
  also , finnish can sound really great ( when i think of it , beautiful [ ievan polkka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4om1rqkpiji ) comes to mind , also names from kalevala like lemmink\u00e4inen or v\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen are epic ) . 
  from non-european languages i 'd easily choose japanese . 
  both for how it sounds and all the culture/mass-culture associated . 
  i 'd say south slavic . 
  i believe i 'd easily tell it from polish , ukrainian , belarusian , czech , slovak ( not sure about the last two , though ) but not from other balkan slavic languages . 
  probably , first thought would be bulgarian . 
  definitely not russian . 
  meh , it 's fine as `` not horrible '' , but not as something that would get much votes . 
  pretty bland , to be frank . 
  and the idea of using a disabled person in a political move is pretty disgusting . 
  [ mikhail lermontov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_lermontov ) , one of our most prominent and beloved poets of xix century , was of scottish ancestry tracing to george learmonth , a scottish officer in the polish-lithuanian service who settled in russia in the middle of the 17th century . 
  there was a number of scotsmen who served in russian armies and then settled and joined the russian nobility . 
  fun fact : some of the worst of our movies ever were called [ `` the best movie '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_best_movie ) ( 1 , 2 and 3 ), 
  ` stalker ' is pretty good too ( no , it has nothing to do with the game , except both were inspired by strugatsky 's roadside picnic ), 
  oh yeah , the story of the reply to the sultan itself is great as well .
