  you asked who gives a shit , i told you how it looks from my side and why i give a shit . 
  as i said , the fact that no one was convicted ( as well as the fact that the prosecutors office do n't want to open the case at all because they do n't see enough evidence of intentional poisoning ) is different news than what this article tells about . 
  also , it was already posted on r/europe two months ago , here : https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5skhzh/putin_critic_who_said_he_was_poisoned_in_2015/ it may be big news ( it was , at least , for me ) . 
  but if you want to cover that nobody is punished , find an article covering that , or at least make an appropriate submission statement telling how the story unfolded . 
  as it is now , the article is outdated , the title and missing submission statement fail to convey the fact that it happened a while ago and that the person is not in coma anymore . 
  and yes , i find it misleading , because without looking at the article , i feared it was a new incident already . 
  seriously , i find it in violation of the subreddit rules ( disallowed submissions , point 7 : duplicates : this includes different sources covering the same story without expanding on it or providing any new information . ), 
  who gives a shit ? 
  those who care about the wellbeing of russian opposition do . 
  if anyone instead of reporting the new cases keeps reposting the same stuff , it only desensitizes people about that kind of news . 
  even among those that know ( really , i 've seen regular mentions of reddit on lenta , meduza , rbc ; pikabu , dirty and lepra users also quite often `` are inspired '' by reddit content ) . 
  thing is many of them do n't even want to participate . 
  even among those who had english lessons like all their life , there are those who 'd prefer russian-language dominated space/content , it 's uncomfortable for them otherwise . 
  judging by what i 've read on pikabu ( i 'd say it 's quite a strong community now ) , still quite a number of our guys participated , but still not enough and effort was n't coordinated ( probably because a lot of us ignore russia subreddit , also their behavior did n't help the cause , actually ) . 
  in the end , i 'd rather state that there 's nobody to help us instead . 
  russia gets obliterated almost everywhere . 
  so , you do n't really care about norn irn after all ? 
  yeah , after what turks did to slavs with their last `` first april joke '' , i 'd rather see finno-ugric , celtic and hellenic nations left on the map . 
  yeah , he clearly missed kazakhstan !, 
  op , shame on you !, 
  as it was stated before it was the term coined by the soviet internal propaganda , probably wasp just caught someone 's eye , and after that was deemed a suitable device to brand us and uk together as a single geopolitical/historical entity . 
  also , negative terms are n't always accurate and sometimes they do n't even need to be . 
  for example , take the term `` commies '' used for russia after ' 90-es as well . 
  not really factual , but it stuck around . 
  it was referring to the elites mostly ( `` common folks are good but misled , while the true villains are the rich and powerful '' , see [ wasp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_anglo-saxon_protestant ) ), 
  yep , like the country we had the most intensive rivalry ( and the least successful trade relations ) in xix-early xx was the uk ( also , see [ the great game ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_great_game ) ) . 
  after the ww2 , when the us became the undisputed leader of the western powers , it took the place of the uk . 
  so , basically it was a way to lump together the british and the american elites as the most malicious geopolitical force . 
  also , that cunt calling himself a teacher is clearly mental . 
  he should be checked and found not fit for the job . 
  seriously mate , it 's ok to apologize for your compatriots but maybe you should be a bit nicer to your girls ? 
  i mean calling most of them arrogant while not even beautiful , is not too pleasant , you know, 
  hey , do n't worry , what they say does n't matter at all . 
  also , people from each and every country can face disrespect from others ( just look at the amount of shit talking usa gets lately , also other major european countries ) . 
  none of that really matters . 
  yes , sometimes it gets old ( especially , when there is no words of support to balance it out , which is totally not the case for poland , i believe europe loves you guys ) . 
  so , do n't take it personally , and do your best not to reinforce stereotypes about your nation , would be my general advice for any country . 
  also , you seem quite focused on that sort of problems . 
  first you ask a question about norway 's hate for poland ( you there mention british hating on poles as well ) , then ask about what dangers await a polish girl in istanbul ( also in quite a controversial tone ) , mention turkish friend who is a great guy ( was he one of the turkish folks you speak of in current post ? ), 
  forgive me for being too skeptic , but something 's not quite right with your attitude as well . 
  that being said , i still say that the described behavior is really not cool . 
  please , believe in yourself and in your country , it 's ok to listen to constructive criticism , but plain negativity is better off be ignored . 
  do n't forget the cold , must be returned too !, 
  it 's not like it was built in the historical part of lutsk , however . 
  just find it on google streetview . 
  surely it 's not the worst thing that happened to that neighborhood . 
  thanks , that 's a good catch . 
  here 's the [ survey of wciom ] ( https://wciom.ru/index.php?id=236&amp;uid=116126 ) in russian . 
  that 's an awful job even for ` pure journalism ' . 
  mix of bad translation , monarchy bias , and straight out misrepresentation of information . 
  royal center is a joke . 
  god , who are those people ? 
  what the hell are they thinking ? 
  i mean , i can understand the thought that between russian empire , ussr and russian federation they might think that the first one was the best ( even despite all the facts against it ) . 
  but why do they think today 's russia needs it is beyond me ... 
  however , i have to say , i lost faith in the numbers brought by the polls long ago , even from relatively independent and trustworthy agencies . 
  which is certainly not even the case here , as the source , izvestia : a ) is not a qualified polling organization b ) lost all the last scraps of reputation and credibility a while ago , under national media group management . 
  i understand reddit 's and r/europe 's love for the jokes about russia , but well do n't forget to check your sources if you 're taking those seriously . 
  edit : a ) izvestia [ cited ] ( http://izvestia.ru/news/672922 ) wciom ( still , quite pro-gov and dependent but at least a solid polling organization ) as source , [ here ] ( https://wciom.ru/index.php?id=236&amp;uid=116126 ) 's the report . 
  b ) as u/adinadin mentioned the royalcenter 's report failed to give the more important results of the survey , showing that russians were found to be generally against the idea . 
  c ) 37 % percent of young russians for the restoration of monarchy is a straight-out lie , nowhere in the original survey you would find those numbers in that exact form . 
  there are people ( around that number ) that are tolerant to the idea of monarchy , though most of them do not see opportunities for its restoration practically . 
  so , please , be careful . 
  royal center is apparently not a trustworthy source of information , esp . 
  about russia or monarchy . 
  ay , that cheerful lad is most definitely from north caucasus ( for the unknown reason , they seem to really like that kind of hairstyle ), 
  of course , i never wanted to imply that moscow is unique in that regard . 
  it is the most natural thing to do with outdated fortifications , in the end . 
  however , moscow 's never ending obsession with concentric rings is still quite evident . 
  both russia and ukraine already declined that offer ( of course ) . 
  russia basically told that no new rules should be invented , ukraine dept pm told `` broadcasts containing individuals who are banned from ukraine are not legal within ukraine and as a result the ebu 's proposal would violate ukrainian law '' . 
  [ [ translation source ] ( https://eurovoix.com/2017/03/23/esc17-deputy-prime-minister-rejects-proposed-satellite-feed-russia/ ) ] . 
  interesting law to enforce , if i may say , but i 'm not the one to dispute them , naturally . 
  heh , moscow followed the walls within walls fortification scheme in medieval times . 
  for example , [ polish map of moscow from 1610 ] ( http://mapsof.net/moscow/moscow-1610 ) . 
  walls of those city rings ( [ kitay-gorod ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kitay-gorod ) , [ bely gorod ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bely_gorod ) and zemlyanoy gorod ) were later demolished ( outer ones in xix century , kitay-gorod was eventually destroyed in stalin 's times ) . 
  outer city walls were replaced by circular roads , boulevard ring and garden ring . 
  that is the origin of concentric road network of moscow ( later additions include mkad and third ring road from late xx - early xxi ) . 
  so , basically , we replaced `` walls within walls '' pattern with `` ring roads within ring roads '' pattern ( also applies to metro rings and city rail ring ) . 
  actually , not latin but starting from byzantine greek . 
  medieval latin ( not true latin ) just borrowed the idea . 
  actual latin word for slave was servus . 
  nah , dude , no one is going to install freight elevators to 4-5 story buildings , esp . 
  in far suburbs, 
  it 's not , duma is `` thought/heavy consideration '' ( quite archaic ) , there is no meaning of `` lie '' ( unless you 're meaning our state duma , then it fits perfectly ) . 
  obviously , i 'm not telling what that guy in bryansk was doing was legal ( i was referring to [ that story ] ( https://globalvoices.org/2017/03/21/this-is-how-a-russian-school-principal-talked-to-her-students-about-patriotism/ ) ) , nor do i say so about that university teacher ( i 'm sure he must have understood the risks ) . 
  however , i 'd have nothing against that school principal was her commentary akin to yours : `` things a and b are not legal , thus i strictly advise our students against them '' . 
  but , alas , her speech was clearly politically charged . 
  no repercussions against her . 
  therefore , i 'm calling out that the mentioned ban works only in one direction . 
  except when it 's a school principal explaining why some political activity outside school is not allowed as well . 
  ah , that one . 
  yeah , it definitely is the first thing that comes to mind , but i utterly failed to recognize the connection . 
  i always suspected that germans trying to take europe and fucking with russia had some freudian meaning to it , but i guess i underestimated the scale of this complex ... 
  so , maybe it needs a specific flair for that ? 
  you know , like , `` humor '' for the fyrom great empire map ? 
  also , why 1984 ? 
  what was connected with that year ? 
  well , i 'm always quite sceptical of that kind of polls and would advise everyone to be vary of them . 
  but i have to disagree that it 's stupid or shows nothing .
