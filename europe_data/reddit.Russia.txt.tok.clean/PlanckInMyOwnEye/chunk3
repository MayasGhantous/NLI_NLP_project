  people were given three choices ( + idk ) . 
  it just so happens that this middle position appeals to estonian respondents the most . 
  do n't see any harm in stating that observation . 
  i also think it is related to the fact that atheism has quite a wide range of manifestations and interpretations ( explicit/implicit , hard/soft , etc. ), 
  in the [ original source ( pdf , p. 204 ) ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf ) it shows 50 % for estonia for belief in some sort of spirit or life force ( the highest result in europe for that question ) . 
  there 's a table in [ wiki : religion in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_europe#eurobarometer_poll_2010 ) . 
  original data is in [ this pdf ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf ) , page 204 . 
  you thought people bring glass bottles for recycling just for the sake of ecology ? 
  you just do n't understand the scale of taara cult !, 
  [ here you go ] ( http://worldmap.harvard.edu/maps/cities ) , linked by u/sp33d3h in the comments above . 
  you 're making a point in right direction , but a little correction : it 'd be around 12,000 dots ... that 'd be more than twice the amount of dots in denmark . 
  or more than the amount of dots of greece , or hungary , or belgium , etc. 
  hah , maybe it 's because that one dot surrounded with white space holds more population than that of all greece ? 
  haha , good , i hope you get along well !, 
  on a more serious note , yeah , it 's easier for me to understand written polish than spoken . 
  maybe they did n't have enough ~ ~ vodka ~ ~ w\u00f3dka back then ? 
   why the huge drop in russia ? 
  russian jews were protected by the holocaust , right ? 
  did they immigrate after ww2 ? 
  while there were many good answers here about russia , i wanted to point out that it 's not really good to compare ussr numbers to the ones of russia only . 
  pre-war numbers of the jewish population of rsfsr ( the part of the ussr that is now russia ) were somewhere around 600k-900k . 
  after war , for example , in 1959 that number was 875.3 thousands , 1970 - 807.9 , 1979 - 700.7 and in 1989 - 551.0 thousands . 
  you can find more information [ here ] ( http://www.eleven.co.il/article/15423 ) with some help from google translate . 
  while what you said about russian jewish was predominantly correct , i 'd like to note few more points . 
  first , one should not forget that it 's not entirely correct to compare numbers for ussr and russia , not only because of the size but also because of the geography of mentioned pale of settlement ( half of those pre-war ussr jewish lived in ukraine and another few hundreds of them lived in belarus ) . 
  therefore it is more reasonable to compare numbers of rsfsr against russia . 
  for example , in 1989 jewish population of rsfsr amounted to 551,000 . 
  so , while the drop after the fall of the iron curtain was quite dramatic , it 's still far from 90 % . 
  i found quite an extensive work on jewish demographics of the ussr [ here ] ( http://www.eleven.co.il/article/15423 ) , with lots of numbers . 
  do n't know if you can read in russian , but still mostly intelligible with google translate . 
  so , i hope our efforts combined could give a more profound answer to u / - lautrec - 's question . 
  quite probably so , however , without bolshevik coup , russia would be among the winning european powers in ww1 and would demand more reparations ( and would demand all the lost ee territories back , even despite not being able to control and govern it properly ) . 
  that would leave the losing sides even more impoverished and oppressed probably ( think of the worse versailles for the central powers ) . 
  probably germany would still be very prone to radical movements , while having less resources for the military build up , or it would be split to zones of influence and occupied ( also a recipe for disaster ) . 
  russia would be probably still be very unstable in the political sense , as a lot of conservatives and reactionaries in the political class would prevent rapid modernization . 
  in the nutshell - we 'd avoid the shit that happened but would face a different one , not neccesarily less bloody . 
  its not only the ee , but the whole world would be dramatically different if ~ ~ ww2 had n't happen ~ ~ nazis would n't have come to power in germany ( no way ww2 would n't happen with their ideology ), 
  [ source : holocaust museum ] ( https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/media_nm.php?moduleid=10005143&amp;mediaid=358 ), 
  that 's an interesting hypothesis , and it definitely might be true for some of the major west/east differences , but i feel it is rather far-stretched to declare it the difference itself . 
  if i understood your idea correctly , you state that the west is more open for risk-taking , while the eastern europe is not . 
  i find that distinction is quite close to the concept of uncertainty avoidance in geert hofstede 's cultural dimensions [ [ for example , here ] ( https://geert-hofstede.com/national-culture.html ) ] . 
  i know that there 's a lot of valid critique of their studies , but i 'm convinced that at least a grain of truth is there . 
  so , while correlation for ee is quite remarkable , it 's not so much for the western european countries . 
  in fact , germany and france were found to be generally risk-avoiding societies . 
  that seems partially wrong to me , i do n't understand why this is a top comment in the thread atm . 
  civil/common law distinction has nothing to do with constitution , except that whatever the legal system is used , it would be reflected in constitution of course . 
  the us has a written constitution , but is undeniably a common law prime example . 
  all people can act like idiots sometimes . 
  it 's never a bad time to remind people not to act like jerks to each other . 
  problem is that first impression is still governed by the title and the original post . 
  so , even if the top comment is calling out author 's lies , there is still a number of those who wo n't be attentive enough to make it to comment section or to read it carefully . 
  there is always a number of those who would disregard the good comments and jump on the hate/tasteless joking bandwagon . 
  i agree that it is a bit of overreaction from op , but i can relate with that still . 
  also , that kind of reaction ( check the facts before accusing ) is still a good general advice whether top comments are sceptical or not . 
  yeah , but using that logic and not including a bunch of other countries , like finland , ukraine and russia ( another example of damned if you include damned if you do n't ) , still leaves a number of people annoyed . 
  well that sub is good only for a very specific type of russian ( or sympathetic , i 'm sure some of them are n't even russians ) person , they do n't represent all of us . 
  anyway , just wanted to say , happy anniversary to you guys !, 
  i really hope there 'd be a time again when we can be good neighbors . 
  cheers !, 
  i might agree with you that there 's a lot of points where russia and germany could successfully cooperate . 
  but the question is , is all of it combined enough to become germany 's top priority ( and that 's how i understood what the poll was about , correct me if i 'm wrong ) . 
  i have serious doubts about it . 
  problem is raw materials economy is not really scalable in terms of population . 
  russia is roughly 30 times larger than norway by population , while crude petroleum exports of russia are only three times the size of norway 's . 
  i believe there 's no way russia 's oil exports can be increased 10-fold within current world oil market . 
  ha , i 'm from russia and could n't help seeing the numbers for that option as a sick joke . 
  even leaving aside all the political and moral rhetoric , how do they think it 's going to happen ? 
   ( i 'm danish , for the record . ), 
   they are coming to eat us . 
  bad idea , one who eats a danish in fact eats a wiener instead [ . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danish_pastry ), 
  as xakaz correctly mentioned , idea of moscow being the 3rd rome was stated long after vladimir 's christianization of the rus ' in 988 . 
  however , legends aside it 's pretty much a given that the eastern orthodox church was the most obvious choice for rus ' , considering that constantinople was the most important destination of trade and diplomacy at the time for them . 
  are you kidding ? 
  it 's pretty easy to understand without translation , we have same root , same script ( for which we can thank bulgarians as well , along with st. cyril and methodius ) but to say it 's the same is nonsense . 
  i mean , just visit / r/bulgaria at least . 
  hey , be careful with that flair of yours , someone might think of [ another galicia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galicia_ ( eastern_europe \\ ) ), 
  also , it 's interesting that `` novogrot '' is used for both nizhny novgorod and novgorod-severskiy , while veliky novgorod is labeled `` novogardia '', 
  note that the rock band in russian is called '' \u041c\u0443\u043c\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043b\u044c '' ( while the moomin troll is usually rendered as '' \u043c\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0438 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043b\u044c '' ) . 
  so the band 's name is more like a pun `` mummy troll '' . 
  also , as a russian , can say that i absolutely loved moomin troll books as a kid . 
  and i think it still is fairly popular here . 
  so , cheers from russia and happy belated independence day !, 
  i 'm sure you 're much more informed on that matter than me , and i believe what you say is mostly true but is n't `` it 's all the old people '' a kind of a blanket statement ? 
  i believe it 's generally correct to assume older generations were the most pro-brexit , but is n't there a lot of younger brexiters as well ? 
  [ here ] ( http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/06/how-did-different-demographic-groups-vote-eu-referendum ) for example , i see 25 % of 18-24 age group voting to leave and 44 % of 25-49 group . 
  i 'm not saying younger generation is to blame , but is n't it harmful to neglect that part of the problem ? 
  i also have to say , that in my opinion people generally turn to conservatism as they grow older . 
  so i would n't be so sure on how would `` your lot '' turn out to be when they 'll finally get to be in charge . 
  however , i still have my faith in british people and wish you guys all the best . 
  note , that i linked leave voters and xenophobia , which is not absolutely correct . 
  however , i believe correlation between two groups is pretty strong , so the rest of the questions still stand . 
  for example , for russia drunk-related accidents amounted to ~ 10-15 % of the traffic fatalities in the given time frame ( 2014 ) . 
  yes , i believe it was to differentiate a more specific time period of the country . 
  just as it was said , that `` kievan rus ' '' was coined by the russians , as the term rus ' has more than one meaning for us . 
  so , it is more like a subset of a wider idea . 
  whether novgorod was an outpost at some point or not , it was an official domain of rus ' where rurik ( if he was a real person ) and later oleg were seating as knyazes . 
  so , in this sense it was a capital of rus before kiev . 
  as for your point about plc , yes their part was large . 
  note that i 've said that there were different contenders for legacy of rus ' , plc included .
