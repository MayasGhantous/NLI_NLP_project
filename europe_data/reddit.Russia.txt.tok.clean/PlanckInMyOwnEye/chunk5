  when they 're in state of disrepair and `` crumbling '' as you say , it sucks too , of course , but at least its authentic . 
  still much better architecture , and also , given how much of it was destroyed/neglected , it 's relatively rare . 
  two posts as of now [ [ 1 ] ( http://pikabu.ru/story/miting_v_moskve_5213311 ) , [ 2 ] ( http://pikabu.ru/story/okolo_800_vyistupayushchikh_za_svobodnyiy_internet_vyishli_na_shestvie_v_moskve_5212307#comments ) ] . 
  both were n't really popular , probably why they are n't among the hot news . 
  but pikabu crowd is pretty sceptical about opposition , generally . 
  to be fair , `` last places '' is a bit of overstatement . 
  capital cities are quite often being `` a country within a country '' , they offer quite a different perspective from the ordinary locations in the country , but the one they do can be quite intensive on their own . 
  and i would n't say that experience is any less `` true '' than that of the minor cities . 
  it 's just very different , and that should be kept in mind . 
  not only that , look at russia , ukraine and belarus ( and moldavia too , it seems ) . 
  nice borders you have there in the rightmost part of the map ... 
  god , that looks bad !, 
  my deepest sympathies to the affected balkans and hope that the fires will stop soon !, 
  i might agree to some extent on what you said , but i believe it 's part of human nature to associate oneself with a larger group and to seek the extension of it in the long past years . 
  concept of nationality was n't born out of nowhere , there were all kinds of predecessors to it ( tribal , feudal , etc. ), 
  for example , read the chronicles of those ancient times ( even earlier than xv centuries ) , i 'm pretty sure you can find some `` collective identity '' concepts that are vaguely similar to the modern nationality concept . 
  and those collective identities from time to time became the cores of newer ones . 
  and they indeed pass on some traits to those new generations , as achievements of those predecessors can still find reflection in the position of the successors , military achievements among them . 
  but that 's a debatable position as well of course . 
  thing is , this is a banner promoting history education website ( at least formally ) . 
  from this point of view it would be somewhat relevant for a billboard , were it factually correct at least , and not of `` bad history '' category . 
  i doubt that discussion here would be as heated , and as many people would find the billboard as inappropriate , if it was a billboard on the battle of kulikovo , for example . 
  the amount of stupid things he said is so impressive , i fail to remember each one that made me facepalm . 
  i do n't think he 's a mastermind of all this mess , more like a useful `` funny '' puppet . 
  but if you look at the `` honorary members '' and board of trustees , those are the ones that are worrying me the most . 
  i believe , main problem is that they were misreading ( probably , deliberately ) the rus lands of poland and lithuania ( the ones that are commonly translated as ruthenia ) as russia . 
  anyway , their expanded article on the battle cites some soviet history book that claims that out of 91 allied banners ( 51 polish and 40 lithuanian ) , there were 7 polish rus ' banners , and 36 lithuanian rus ' banners . 
  afterwards that author goes on to praise the rus ' regiments as the most effective . 
  the last step to make is to interpret the said 43 banners as russian , plus emphasize that smolensk regiments took the heaviest blow and voila , great russian military victory . 
  minor correction/question : both on rvio and in english wiki i see the mention of 3 smolensk regiments ( not that much of a difference but still ) . 
  also , numbers for regiment size and total army size differ in different accounts . 
  can you tell which one you 're following ? 
  those billboards are advertising a history website by rvio - russian military historical society , a group that aims at patriotism cultivation , popularizing russian history education and `` countering attempts at its distortion '' ( oh , the irony ) . 
  it is led by the current culture minister , vladimir medinskiy , which before his appointment as a minister was known as an author of controversial history books , and is a subject in many scandals concerning his doctorate thesis ( accused of plagiarism and non-scientific approach ) . 
  for me , rvio seems like a hub of revisionism , imperialism and militarism propaganda . 
  i really do n't like these guys . 
    ... on how beautiful young women you 've become with your sisters . 
   and since it 's finland , we know it 's a personal true story . 
  and therefore we know u/helmia is probably very gorgeous indeed . ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry, 
  in other news , montenegro is now part of the adriatic sea . 
  that 's what you get for having such a racist name !, 
  to be frank , it 's rare to hear nowadays in russia . 
  that concept has a nasty habit of backfiring . 
  that sucks . 
  they did n't even bother to mask it by some pretty words this time , it seems . 
  however , is there more to read on subject ( any protocols , or project of said resolution , at least who was the one to block the resolution ) ? 
  i mean , i do n't have anything against euractiv as a media platiform ( it 's the first time i hear about it ) , but more info would be nice . 
  tried to pronounce * baile \u00c1tha cliath * , got * blya , clear * instead . 
  how 's that even supposed to be pronounced ? 
  but that 's comparing prices in different countries . 
  they can always say , it 'd be even more expensive if they were selling the original quality ones , do n't you think , because of , idk , different market properties , different legislation , different taxes , or ca n't they ? 
  besides igloo , are there different brands of fish fingers available , of competing/better quality ? 
   haidari probably because ~ ~ kebab ~ ~ not actually a greek name . 
  haidar is an arabic ( and therefore islamic , in general ) name ( means * lion * in arabic ) . 
  greek wiki states that neighborhood had a different name before , and was renamed by an ottoman haidar pasha ( if i got it right ) . 
  \u0421\u043d\u0435\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439 was what i meant , in serbian that ( an adjective version of snow ) would be \u0421\u043d\u0435\u0436\u043d\u0438 ? 
  i first thought to call him \u0421\u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432 , but it feels unnatural , after all he 's not a snowson . 
  also , it would n't be that fun in the end , as it 's only the poor bastards who get to be called by meaningful surnames and normal names . 
  oh , come on , is yanko tsvetkov the only one that is allowed to make bullshit maps of stereotypes ? 
   a russian is self-assured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know anything -- you know nothing , ivan snezhny !, 
  -- yep !, 
  ` looks proud and undaunted `, 
  it 's like `` game of thrones '' , with a bunch of hated characters , and a bunch of `` good guys '' , whom r/europe is cheering for ( who 's jon snow of this season ? 
  the guy who 's very gorgeous ? ), 
  one problem is , seasons change , characters leave and enter the scene , but the way the scripts are written are more or less the same , while the show as a whole seems to lack any sense at all . 
  wow , someone gave gold for this ? 
  o_0 do n't get me wrong , i have nothing against the contents , but it 's the most unremarkable comment to receive gold i 've seen on reddit . 
  congrats , though , i guess . 
  loudest ?!!, 
  he 's just one decebal , just above hearing threshold !, 
  now , if there were 130 of them , that 'd be painful . 
  hence what i said . 
  if it is n't a thing , there is probably a reason for it , and crying out to public is n't going to change much . 
  also , news posts are relatively frequent , still . 
  but if i understood op 's division into text posts and link posts , news are kind of the latter . 
  and yes , i 'm all for removing reposts that go against the sub 's rules . 
  if it 's not on the front page , but you can still find it through search - i 'd vote for removing the duplicate . 
  it 's causing fragmentation of discussion , lower quality of comments , and is just plain waste of space . 
  u/ccv21 , if you want to change it -- you have to lead by example . 
  think about what kind of text content this sub lacks , what kind of discussions , then check with sub 's rules ( probably the main problem with your wish ) , and think about what will gain enough traction to get visible on hot for enough time for a meaningful discussion . 
  it 's relatively easy to post * x of europe * pic posts , or politically charged photos , or all kinds of comparison maps , knowing that this sub loves that kind of thing . 
  if you 're going to change the trend , it 's going to take some time and some effort . 
  except for when it is , sadly . 
  that 's all a very good talk , but it ai n't selling much , when you 're justifying some costly fundamental research that only god knows when is going to benefit the humanity ( if not making it worse for everyone ) . 
  nuclear race , space race , you name it . 
  even particle physics and fusion energy has been very dependent on competition , especially during the cold war . 
  competition is a great fuel for science . 
  then she looks sideways , blinks , gives a blank stare and tightens corners of her lips a bit . 
  that 's not only an eye roll , it 's definitely a show of being slightly annoyed . 
  it might be that you 're right as well ( as she really looked interested at the beginning of the whole conversation ) . 
  probably she thought about it for a sec , then just got tired of the argument ( `` ok , maybe he 's got a point ... -- ugh , whatever , he 'll be talking about it for hours at this rate . 
  i 'll just agree and we 'll switch to another topic . '' ) . 
  other footage shows she actively nodded afterwards while charging forward a bit . 
  maybe . 
  but when a poster floods r/europe with lots of russia photos a day , it gets old . 
  welp , it was may ' 91 , after all . 
  su was on its death bed itself . 
  but [ kuryokhin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sergey_kuryokhin ) was a pretty wild guy , that 's true . 
  too bad that wildness and love for independence carried him into some * very * fishy company afterwards . 
  maybe he was ?
