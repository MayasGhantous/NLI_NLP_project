  many russians know that [ lenin was a mushroom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lenin_was_a_mushroom ) , so who knows how many of * questionable personalities * in history were secretly mushrooms ? 
  give me cause , profligate !, 
  true to caesar !, 
  be careful not to make a sound !, 
  in addition to what reineblanche suggested you could try ( depending on your tastes/interests/weather at the time you 'll be here ) : * kolomenskoye museum/reserve/park * tretyakov gallery * pushkin museum + art gallery of the european and american countries of the xix-xx centuries ( if you like impressionists ), 
  caucasus maybe ? 
  * mountains ? 
  check !, 
  * beards ? 
  check !, 
  * not very tall but pretty broad ? 
  check ( more or less ) * love to fight and to trade ? 
  check as well , i guess, 
  no , it just divides your flag into * four * red ones, 
   thunderous applause do you want prequel memes ? 
  cause that 's how you get prequelmemes, 
  and therefore very gorgeous !, 
  i 'm not arguing that we have n't or that we did get something from it ( that 's a different discussion , and i 'm pretty sure how would it end up ) . 
  plus , i do n't really like the comment above you . 
  but two questions : 1 ) as a person , do you only admit mistakes and apologize , when you get something from it ? 
  2 ) nazi germany existed from 1933 to 1945 , the germans are feeling the echo of the past even now , why do you feel that if we as a nation wanted to take the same path , it would n't be even harder to gain trust , considering that soviet union lasted much longer than a single decade ? 
  a ) i 'm not sure i can make a valid estimate on all ( at least the main ) state mass-media in russia , as they 're a toxic cesspool i 've been trying to avoid at all costs for a long time . 
  however , from my point of view they never even tried to carefully represent '' * why * you feel this way '' . 
  b ) i wonder actually if there was a way they could have handled it , even be they the most benevolent mass media russia had . 
  c ) i think part of it comes from a failure to find a new identity and a new way of looking at it positively . 
  a random thought `` okay , maybe we were assholes and they hate us for reason '' would stop in a deadend of a question `` ok , now what ? 
  what should i do with that knowledge '' then come questions `` was that really that bad ? 
  what choice did we have ? 
  [ insert some generic whataboutist questions too ] etc etc '' . 
  i believe lack of moral authorities left people alone with this questions , and made them somewhat deaf to arguments about `` why they feel that way '' . 
  d ) in some cases this indeed might turn to `` abusive ex-husband '' ideology . 
  however , i believe it 's more the case of russia-ukraine relations and i 'm not sure how many people would relate to it ( trying to get an honest answer even from a close person on this might be like walking on a minefield ) , but i 've got some hope left that this might be quite a marginal point of view , still . 
  as for baltics , i do n't think we ever regarded our relations with you as a `` proper marriage '' . 
  thanks again !, 
  ha , so i guess that 's what you get when you send poor pioneers by land , instead of rich naval trade expeditions . 
   \u9102 was the other one attested , meaning `` startled '' ha , * suddenly * \u4fc4 does n't look that bad after all !, 
  better be unexpected pita ( after all , that 's not so far from truth ) , than startled weaklings . 
  unfortunately , i ca n't read much of chinese ( recognize a few characters , is the most one can expect from me ) , or at least , i need a webpage to feed to chrome translator . 
  also , wiki mentions that before those conflicts there was an expedition by [ ivan petlin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivan_petlin ) in 1618-1619 , who reached ming dynasty china , but unfortunately failed to establish proper diplomacy ( as he was not prepared , and by the time he reached the capital , he did n't have a good tribute to be allowed to meet the emperor ) . 
  it 's stated though , that they managed to make contact with some officials and even brought back a document from the court , which could n't be translated for years to come , until russia became serious about china . 
  from [ this discussion ] ( https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/53932/how-does-found-in-a-cabbage-patch-look-look ) , variations of it can be found in english ( `` found in a cabbage patch '' ) and french ( `` les filles sont n\u00e9es dans les roses et les gar\u00e7ons dans les choux '' ( `` girls are born in the roses , and and boys in the cabbages '' ) ) . 
  in russian , we have it the same way as in polish : either brought by a stork , or found in a cabbage / among the cabbages ( * v kapuste * ) . 
  no gender differences . 
  thank you for your clarification , that makes sense . 
  so , if the old form is used for modern russia , it means that either a person does n't know/care about all this stuff , or is using it out of courtesy/flattery , right ? 
  and no , i could n't care less about this `` true \u56fd '' stuff myself ( i mean greatness and all that ) , i prefer normal name anyway . 
  also , think about it , \u4fc4 is a remnant of a junk sound that mongols added to make it pronounceable for them , it 's not even part of our real name . 
  now that 's humiliating , a bit . 
  however , come to think of it , we still have n't changed russian name of china from kitay , so that makes us somewhat even . 
  well , tidder-wave explained the chinese variant , but there 's a story about old japanese name for russia , which was rather offensive ( now only kana name is used , roshia , \u30ed\u30b7\u30a2 ) . 
  iirc , they basically followed the same scheme as the chinese ( taking first syllable and adding \u56fd character , koku ) . 
  so , ro character in rokoku was written as [ \u9732 ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%e9%9c%b2#japanese ) bare/naked , so basically it was smth like `` barren land '' ... no wonder our relations never were too nice . 
  thank you !, 
  i was wondering where on earth did that e come from , and why are we not just luosi instead of eluosi . 
  btw , if i understand correctly there were many variants how initial `` e '' could be rendered in chinese characters . 
  i also see that the \u4fc4 character means `` suddenly , ( very ) soon , presently '' according to wiktionary . 
  is there any story for why this character was used ? 
  may i ask , are you a native speaker or do you have anything to back your claim ? 
  because if that statement is based merely on google suggestions for \u4fc4\u56fd , then i believe you might have misunderstood the reason for it . 
  anyway , there are few reasons why i doubt your version . 
  first one , if you type \u4fc4\u56fd ( eguo ) in baidu , which is an actual chinese search engine , you 'd see the results refer to modern russia , not russian empire ( plus , baidu has its own wiki , baike , which [ happens to clearly refer ] ( http://baike.baidu.com/item/%e4%bf%84%e5%9b%bd ) to modern russia/russia in general for \u4fc4\u56fd / eguo term ) . 
  second , even linguistically \u4fc4\u56fd refers merely to russian country ( \u4fc4 / e = first syllable of eluosi and therefore shorthand for everything russian ( `` e '' nation ) , \u56fd / guo = country/state ) , as u/beaglers already explained . 
  therefore , even if \u4fc4\u56fd is a more archaic form , and was more in use in the imperial time , it 's just because that was more customary back then , especially for major trade destinations . 
  finally , why google gives you russian empire articles for \u4fc4\u56fd is because it finds them related to \u6c99\u7687\u4fc4\u56fd / shahuang eguo/tsar [ ist ] russia and \u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5e1d\u56fd / eluosi diguo/russian empire which are the actual terms for the russian empire . 
  this was what i 've found on subject , by googleing , baiduing , wikiing and trying to understand the information . 
  if an actual chinese person would correct me , i 'd be happy to admit any mistakes . 
  however , i 'm pretty confident , that i 'm right on this one . 
  plus , my arguments still stand . 
  i 've lurked a bit through your post history . 
  so , i understand that you 're living in beijing now , so you must know chinese pretty well . 
  so , i might be wrong in the end . 
  it 's just that i 'd still trust a native speaker from mainland china more , however . 
  32.5 kk for e luo si vs 21.8 kk e guo ( simplified characters ) on baidu, 
  i 've heard that variant , e luo si , too before ( even though i 'm not a chinese speaker ) . 
  at least , google fetches 214kk results for \u4fc4\u7f57\u65af ( e luo si , simplified spelling ) , plus 30kk for \u4fc4\u7f85\u65af ( e luo si , as well , traditional chinese ) , while only 15.3 kk for \u4fc4\u56fd / 5.3 kk \u4fc4\u570b ( e guo ) . 
  maybe , this variant is used to appease gullible russian statesmen/businessmen , that they are respected ? 
  at least , no one calls higgs boson `` god particle '' these days . 
  that triggered me much more back in the days . 
  also , i 'm pretty sure lots of guys at cern liked steyns gate , so why not ? 
  actually , that applies to flags mostly . 
  many of those on the map are not flags but coats of arms , really . 
  different genre , different standards . 
  i 'd say , concept of skyline ( in its american sense ) is pretty foreign for moscow architecture in general , with a few exceptions maybe . 
  i believe , they pretty much make a noticeable skyline landmark for a lot of places in the western direction ( szao , zao , yuzao and western part of tsao ; here 's [ panorama from vorobjovy gory ] ( http://mosprogulka.ru/pictures/one/smotrovaya_ploshadka_vorobievih_gor_2.jpg ) , here 's [ cathedral of christ the savior ] ( https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/25407/84525178.c3/0_b45c9_44011fba_xl ) [ [ original post here ] ( http://anothercity.livejournal.com/1369800.html ) , with some more nice photos from moscow roofs ] with city in the background , for example ) . 
  just the whole city-planning of moscow is not so skyline-centric , so a lot of views are obstructed . 
  yeah , just the concept : dark above and beyond , light in the middle . 
  speak for yourself !, 
  and please , mind '' [ no true scotsman ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_true_scotsman ) '' fallacy . 
  it 's not like a dozen of muscovites have the same opinion on each subject . 
  and i 'm definitely not even sure we can speak of a majority opinion here . 
  as for the other arguments , it is moscow now , i do n't think they 're going anywhere . 
  plus , with how many times moscow was ruined and rebuilt without any regard for stylistic/architectural coherence , it 's safe to say that `` moscowness '' of architecture is a very vague concept . 
  it reminds me of the latvian flag this way . 
  you need to squat better to see them !, 
  that 's why username benjamin-cat should always put you on guard on reddit , heh, 
  some say it 's even more reliable than words of a nigerian prince !, 
  on a more serious side , here 's [ reuters article ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-france-iduskbn19c2e7?il=0 ) on topic , if you 're interested, 
  just from r/europe , searching by term * slavery * : * https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5z08mz/raped_beaten_exploited_the_21stcentury_slavery/ * https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2stu28/i_was_sold_into_sexual_slavery_guardian_article/ * https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/64c227/saving_russias_brick_slaves_were_taking_them_home/ and many many more examples . 
  now ** that ** is modern day slavery . 
  not really far from its millenia-old meaning : complete loss of personal freedom and liberty while being physically , cruelly exploited .
