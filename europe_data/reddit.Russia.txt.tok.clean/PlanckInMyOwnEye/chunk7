  you can battle underpaid jobs using illegal working force all you want , but please do n't devalue term slavery in process . 
  nah , there should be an automatic ~ ~ groping ~ ~ sorting machine on the entry , i guess . 
  you do n't have to answer for an individual , right ? 
   probably , he did n't fit in well in swedish society , if he came to rule here , do n't you think ? 
  in this case , wiki cites it as a crimean tatar loanword , btw, 
  there is [ kompot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kompot ) , and there is [ compote ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compote ) . 
  different stuff . 
  first one is a beverage , other one is the dessert you 're thinking of . 
  heresy !, 
  you stuff vareniki with cherries !, 
  meat pelmeni only true pelmeni !, 
  probably , the one who designed it utterly hated the eiffel tower . 
  i ca n't think of other justification . 
  now i 'm waiting for some russian news outlet to report it , so that someone would post on reddit that ` the `` omoh in the mirror '' picture from yesterday made the russian news ', 
  living up to your username , are you ? 
  it 's a pretty stupid law , actually , about countermeasures to extremist activities . 
  there 's a point about ` propaganda and public demonstration of nazi symbolics ' ( if i understand correctly , aimed primarily against neonazis ) , and a regulator even [ specified it explicitly ] ( https://lenta.ru/news/2015/04/15/swastika/ ) , that usage of swastika without propaganda purposes is acceptable and legal , but the wording is still too ambiguous . 
  so , it 's easier to blur it out just in case . 
  i believe their editorial task might be something like ` report information in the way that even a grandma would understand , and leave your geeky technobabble out of it ' , lol . 
  thus , mention of moderators is deemed too technical maybe ? 
  totally that . 
  it 's like reading soviet articles a la ' \u041a\u0443\u0440\u044c\u0451\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0436\u043e\u043c ' or ' \u0418\u0445 \u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u044b ' , with a bit of the vibes of soviet reviews of western mass-culture . 
  not in terms of ideology/propaganda mostly , but that condescending tone of theirs . 
  just a reminder for everyone : brutalist architecture is not about being brutal ( so , being grim is completely irrelevant ) , it 's about * b\u00e9ton brut * , smooth concrete with no finishing on top being left as the surface of the facade . 
  do n't worry , in [ another one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n2z224ti30 ) they made up for it . 
  i 'm not op , but i 'd say podgorica did n't strike me as a touristic destination . 
   darn russia hey , it 's not like we do n't want visa free travel ourselves , ok ? 
  bloody bureaucrats !, 
  and lazy at that , too . 
  but maybe it has something to do with the russia-eu visa facilitation agreement , that uk did n't sign ( along with ireland , denmark , iceland and norway ) . 
  anyway , i hope you 'll visit moscow and st. petersburg ( make sure to include both ) one day !, 
  on a bright side , you wo n't need to hurry to next destination in that case , so you 'll have a bit of time to look around ), 
  yep , it 's sad that it got you downvoted ... 
  there is no tomato only sadness, 
  [ i award you no points , and may god have mercy on your soul . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkjxfjfcrca ), 
  top quality shitpost . 
  upvoted, 
  that 's a pity , this post raised a genuine discussion on a serious and important topic for modern european politics , which many here found relatable . 
  while i understand that this post here formally breaks the rules , and therefore was rightfully taken down , i wonder if an exemption from the rule could have been made ... 
  yep , many things check out for russia as well . 
  problem with that kind of behavior is that it 's self-replicating and self-propagating . 
  if one side uses it , the other will pretty much be driven to answer in the same way . 
  nah , he 's just not bothered by assuming a fair stance , it looks like sole raison d'\u00eatre of this particular person is hating russia . 
  i mean , i can understand people ( like ukrainians , estonians , romanians etc. ), 
  shit-talking russia when they have an opportunity but not like when someone 's whole comment history consists of it . 
  sounds like an order ... 
  but that 's a russian way of saying that we like your hometown !, 
  how can we stop it ? 
   balkanization , or balkanisation , is a pejorative geopolitical term , originally used to describe the process of fragmentation or division of a region or state into smaller regions or states that are often hostile or uncooperative with one another . 
  [ [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkanization ) ] . 
  it 's interesting that here 's the second thread this week ( another one on askeurope ) , where you use this term as a somewhat favorable or acceptable outcome ... 
  you mean russians as a nation , or some exact russians ? 
  how long will it last ? 
  now that 's the question ... we do n't have as much spare money as we used to , and that 's not going to change in the near foreseeable future . 
  also , russian investments might make chunky part comparing to other individual countries , but i believe it 's around 10-15 % of the total ( if you have better stats , please post ) . 
  russian tourists , according to montenegro stats ( [ original pdf ] ( http://monstat.org/userfiles/file/turizam/dolasci%20i%20nocenja%202014/godisnja/tourism%20in%20montenegro%20-%202014.pdf ) ) in 2014 amounted to 24 % of total , that 's also large but not irreplaceable if western involvement increases . 
  great job , by the way !, 
  keep it up and next time post here too , please !, 
  u/noxadei , please , never ever use jpg for the text-containing graphics , it kills them . 
  not to mention you could have made an x-post from mapporn where the original author posted it . 
  truth to be told , montenegro proclaimed it would join nato years ago , and it was silly to assume this would not happen . 
  it 's also an understandable decision , as montenegro needs foreign investments , which are easier with better ties with the west . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , google translate is using neural networks for system learning to translate sentences rather than series of words . 
  that might be the reason for such a strange fluke ( if you isolate the russian words in question , it would show you correct meaning , but somehow in this exact sentence it 's messed up ) . 
  also , they are by and large assuming that in case the translation is wrong and the phrase is important enough , people would vote for the better result . 
  it allows user-submitted edits without serious validation ( see the `` suggest an edit '' button in the bottom-right angle on translate.google.com ? 
  ) , which makes it possible to submit any kind of gibberish or plain wrong information instead of useful translation . 
  i do n't know what 's the threshold after which a random edit becomes the main translation , but technically it 's possible . 
  i call it vandalism as it 's a pretty similar concept to [ wiki vandalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vandalism_on_wikipedia ), 
  cause anyone can vandalize google translate, 
  down in the comments i see that they call handball ` rukomet ' too . 
  so , not only do they have footlaunchers but handlaunchers as well . 
  violent people they are , apparently . 
  just imagine all those human extremities flying around the stadium !, 
  i do n't like pebbles !, 
  it 's coarse and rough and irritating and ... ok , at least it does n't get everywhere ... 
  hey , you forgot plitvi\u010dka jezera and dubrovnik !, 
  hello ? 
  you 're implying i 'm not in touch with reality ? 
  ( from the speed i got a downvote , i presume i got it from you ? 
  what 's so wrong with what i said ? 
  you really think i 'm a kremlinbot trying to spread lies and propaganda ? ), 
  if you 're serious , no , this is not how russia operates . 
  or you 'd say when kadyrov invited merkel and macron to chechnya , he threatened them as well ? 
  i 'm pretty sure zaharova with kadyrov can ensure safe trip to chechnya ( there have been precedents , iirc ) , but of course that would not help investigating the matter . 
  i do n't think so . 
  threat of what , exactly ? 
  not being accredited to further briefings ? 
  i 'm not sure how i feel about the question in this context , and how a hypothetical ideal mfa spokesperson should have handled it , but goddamn , i 'm so tired of feeling shame for zakharova , her vulgar tone and her attempts at trolling . 
  you want to say that it 's outside of mfa 's sphere of competence ? 
  fine , state it . 
  want to state it 's internal problem of chechen nation ? 
  go ahead , find a diplomatic and concise way to make this answer . 
  many , many options to diplomatically refuse to answer . 
  but why make a circus out of it , try to humiliate a journalist , behave like a drama queen ? 
  or eenti, 
  so , estonians are ents confirmed ? 
  this project ( the authors of the original video in russian ) was few days late to present [ their own english-language version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc2tybtrg4y ) before the ripoff . 
  some of your points still apply to their video , however ( would you maintain it 's a badhistory category ? ),
