  for you he very well could be a national hero , for the football club 's fans his supporters could be nazi sympathizers . 
  even in the tolerant eu some things are still not tolerated , nazism is one of such things . 
  became a governor 's advisor on regional timber industry . 
  register a commercial firm . 
  as governor 's advisor , `` ask '' state-owned timber producers to sell timber to his firm from which it would be sold to former direct customers of the producer . 
  his only mistake was to choose wrong patron ( said former governor is rotting in jail now after he was caught on a bribe himself ) . 
  and yeah , the court was right , it 's `` indistinguishable from regular commercial activities '' since it 's a pretty widespread scheme . 
   he cooperated with nazis that 's enough . 
  i know , some of ukrainians praise him as a national hero , it does n't make him less nazi collaborationist in opinion of peoples of other cultures . 
  [ his photo with stepan bandera on a scarf ] ( http://ua-reporter.com/sites/default/files/01.02.2017_2106/c3iowddwmaazgfm.jpg ) .

   the article on forbes is biased , but still extremely far from the kind of russian fake news we 've seen . 
  we have seen a lot of fakes from all the sides . 
  this fact does n't indulge forbes editors . 
  i think it would be better for everyone if people would try to be more neutral on this sub . 
  how do you know it ? 
  from news ? 
  most news from a place of conflict are biased towards one of the sides . 
  degree of guilt of all involved sides must be investigated in cases of war crimes in independent and unbiased manner . 
  i think it wo n't happen since eu has it 's own interests in ukrainian conflict and the icc is funded by the eu . 
  who `` you '' ? 
  no , i 'm not . 
  i like the report . 
  some direct citations from it : p. 36 , paragraph 164 : `` in mid-july , the russian federation accused ukraine 's armed forces of shelling the russian border town of donetsk . '', 
  - the prosecutor had some problems with geography or it 's a freudian slip of the tongue ? 
  p. 37 , paragraph 169 : `` additional information , such as reported shelling by both states of military positions of the other , and the detention of russian military personnel by ukraine , and vice-versa , points to direct military engagement between russian armed forces and ukrainian government forces that would suggest the existence of an international armed conflict in the context of armed hostilities in eastern ukraine from 14 july 2014 at the latest , in parallel to the non-international armed conflict . '', 
  as far as i could understand english , it is said that non-international conflict ( civil war ) exists for sure and maybe an international conflict also . 
  p. 38 , paragraph 170 : `` for the purpose of determining whether the otherwise non-international armed conflict could be actually international in character , the office is also examining allegations that the russian federation has exercised overall control over armed groups in eastern ukraine . 
  the existence of a single international armed conflict in eastern ukraine would entail the application of articles of the rome statute relevant to armed conflict of an international character for the relevant period ... '' in other words , the office is examining , they have n't made any direct accusations . 
  an article on forbes is a good example of so-popular now `` fake news '' . 
  it contains some truth ( correct citations of a report ) and some lies . 
  such as : `` donbas is an international conflict between russian and ukraine , not a civil war '' - exactly the opposite is said in the report , it is surely a civil war and maybe an international conflict also . 
  or : `` icc finding : east ukraine is an international armed conflict between russia and ukraine '' - it was n't found at all . 
  they are examining it as a possibility , nothing more yet . 
  i believe that we all are tired of propaganda , be it russian or european product . 
  the title is misleading . 
  it 's a preliminary opinion of one of the prosecutors , from a [ report ] ( https://www.icc-cpi.int/pages/item.aspx?name=pr1252 ) on her activities . 
  not a decision of a court , not a final official position . 
  this sub is not for eu only , it is about europeans in general . 
  by trying to make it even more pro-eu you just join the ranks of a `` professional troll army '' . 
  m-m , a ukrainian model !, 
  do they have russian majority on some nice peninsula ? 
  he won the [ great stand on the ugra river ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_stand_on_the_ugra_river ) which ended mongolian yoke . 
  i like historical films a lot !, 
  if novgorod survived that time , it would 've been conquered by peter the great to access baltic sea . 
  as you know , he was a bit obsessed with an idea of building fleet . 
  doubtful . 
  in 1905-1917 it was too late for the democracy to became a working institute because of rigidity of tsarist government , it resulted in two revolutions . 
  in 1990-1993 democratic process was an effective illusion made to hide nomenklatura privatization movement , democracy was perceived as `` power of democrats '' . 
  after tanks shelled the white house in 1993 , even this play was ended . 
  ivan iii was very ambitious leader , who pretended to take roles both of the roman caesar ( hence the title tsar , in russian '' \u0446\u0430\u0440\u044c '' from '' \u0446-\u0435\u0437-\u0430\u0440\u044c '' ) and the golden horde khan . 
  an idea of moscow as a `` third rome '' was a creation of his ideologists . 
  in novgorod and pskov they had [ veche ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/veche ) systems of direct democracy . 
  every free family had a right to vote , a head of a family acted as their representative . 
  in late period noble families dominated it , but still not in every vote . 
  the river was wider in old times . 
  curiously , the fortress was finally sieged during winter , when ice was thick enough to deploy siege engines and artillery . 
  edit : [ view from above at summer ] ( http://www.tourprom.ru/site_media/images/poiphoto/novgorodskii-kremlj_1.jpg ), 
  in 1477 moscovites sieged the city and conquered the republic of novgorod . 
  it was the end of democracy in russia .

   could n't find statistics of death indirectly caused by alcohol this value strongly correlates with deaths indirectly caused by consuming cucumbers . 
  wins or losses in russian elections at this level is just a public legitimation of an already established fact . 
  who would have the best deal with elites would be the new president . 
  the telegraph is just a competing propagandist mechanism , they need to keep their share on this market . 
  there is no link to an actual research or report in the article . 
  oecd [ does not have ] ( http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?queryid=30115# ) actual data for year 2012 for russia . 
  the real rate of deaths from alcohol poisoning in 2012 [ was 11.4 per 100 000 ] ( http://www.gks.ru/dbscripts/cbsd/dbinet.cgi?pl=2415011 ) . 
  it was a rhetorical question . 
  where are their remains ? 
  russian comments there which are not written by ukrainians are more or less adequate , people mostly are discussing how fun is this joke and talk about their local realities . 
  you are taking it too seriously . 
  we have a lot of propaganda here , but we are far more critical to it than an average european , thanks to our soviet past . 
   how , in general , the russian authorities want to portray europe to ordinary russians it 's not about russian russians , it 's about lithuanian russians some of whom received fun non-official letters by post . 
  exactly !, 
  we think about our country in literally global scale . 
   moscow is not anywhere near lithuania . 
  from a perspective of small countries - yes , you are right . 
  from russian perspective it 's just 12 hours on a train . 
  magadan is not near lithuania , from our perspective . 
   moscow is sort of an aberration in russia when it comes to salaries have i said something about the whole russia ? 
  i think it 's ok to compare capital cities in this case , vilnius and moscow . 
  we are talking about a possibility that life in some parts of russia is better than in some parts of lithuania , especially for ethnical russians . 
  maybe not exactly as in propaganda letters from the post , but yes , people could find that it would be better for them to move to the motherland than to stay in lithuania . 
  why not ? 
  in moscow living standards are higher . 
  a big city , with population five times bigger than whole lithuania . 
  what 's the problem ? 
  ok , some figures of cost of living , from neutral site . 
  [ vilnius ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/vilnius ) vs [ moscow ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/moscow?displaycurrency=eur ) average salary after taxes : 652 $ vs 857 $ , utilities : 163 $ vs 108 $ and so on . 
  yep , moscow has higher living standard than vilnius now . 
  it happens with rockets . 
  they are very complex machines without 100 % guarantee of success .
