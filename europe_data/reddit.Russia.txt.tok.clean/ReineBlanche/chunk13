  but i could understand why some other artists disagree with defenders of people like sentsov . 
  so , do you think it is permissible for `` artists '' to commit crimes claiming that it was their new art projects ? 
  i mean real crimes , from position of common sense , like destroying property or causing physical harm to other people . 
  could someone explain to me , please , why some modern `` artists '' in russia burn things , beat people and then , after they are captured , claim that investigations are politically motivated ? 
  just yesterday another clown pavlenskiy fled to france . 
  after video camera recorded how he and his fellows severely beat a man . 
  he even admitted that he did it , from abroad . 
  of course , in france he would be treated as a freedom fighter , not as a thug . 
  exaggeration of elevation to a factor of 40 or so is normal to this kind of maps . 
  earlier examples are made by heinrich c. berann , [ including this one ] ( http://www.dandys-deep-impacts.homepage.t-online.de/pictures/eu_3d_75dpix1024_ver_cut.jpg ) . 
  spiky appearance of mountains on the rendered image is due to a lack of proper cartographic generalization , which is a hard task for modern algorithms at small scales . 
  at least i 've met here an estonian with a sense of humor !, 
   that there is some shithole in the desert where we bomb some terrorists is not the same thing as a war inside of europe . 
  if we would relax our grip , europe would treat us like , as you said , `` some shithole '' , killing our people and our future . 
   wow , fellow estonians , let 's start preparing you already have foreign forces on your soil , too late to prepare . 
   clashes between two sides are not the same as systematic attempts to exterminate populations . 
  we know very well what their nationalists did with ethnical russians in the recent past , during and after wwii . 
  it should n't happen anymore . 
  it is very important to choose friends wisely . 
   except forces have been withdrawn from both nations since this is not true . 
  there are about 10 000 american soldiers in afghanistan right now and they are bombing iraq right now . 
   also what was wrong with invading afghanistan ? 
  it is a violation of sovereignty of independent country . 
   when is russia planning to give back our national treasury sent over in wwi for `` safekeeping '' ? 
  after your politicians allied with germany during wwii - never . 
   and i was not aware of massacres and genocide in the crimea sure , i could show you what ukrainian nationalists [ did in odessa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_odessa_clashes ) with local supporters of being closer with russia . 
  odessa is located in 170 km from crimea . 
  search google images with phrase '' \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0441\u043e\u044e\u0437\u043e\u0432 \u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e '' if you wish to see photos from there , most of them are really nsfw . 
  they burned people alive . 
  people see the failings of others but are blind to their own . 
  that 's what i am talking about . 
  i like your comment , seriously . 
  because it was exactly our motivation when we protected abkhazia , southern ossetia and crimea , word-in-word . 
   just because there 's an alliance that frowns upon russia 's expansionist policy does not mean we 're hostile if so , if your country is truly independent , why do you allow other nations to command what your people should do and how they should live ? 
  why do your country receive money from them ? 
   now there is nothing to gain and everything to lose . 
  we do n't think so . 
  that 's one of the reasons why i 'm saying that foreigners do n't understand us . 
   did you know the spanish once had control of the southern parts of the netherlands and then we fought them ? 
  yes , i do . 
   or how germany tried to conquer europe twice ? 
  we lost 1 300 000 people in wwi and 24\u00a0000\u00a0000 in wwii . 
  my great-grandfather was killed by germans at wwii . 
   or how france tried to conquer europe ? 
  yes , i know . 
  my ancestors liberated europe from napoleon . 
   yet we all live in peace now . 
  how did that happen ? 
  i have n't noticed . 
  right now your and my countries are involved in ongoing wars . 
   and nothing was annexed in yugoslavia . 
  i doubt so . 
   you do n't want to understand yourselves , that 's the problem maybe . 
   that we 're a target for nuclear bombs ? 
  not as an independent country , of course , only as a member of hostile alliance that plans to destroy us . 
  for example , switzerland is not a target for a nuclear strike because their politicians are wise enough to be neutral . 
   no one wants to invade russia whole our history consists of attempts of other nations to conquer us . 
  swedes , mongols , lithuanians , poles , frenchmen , germans with their friends ... we have a long historical memory which helped us survive trough ages . 
   help me remember when the usa/an eu country annexed land close to russia [ sure , please ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_yugoslavia ) . 
  like we invaded afghanistan in 2001 , or iraq in 2003 ? 
  oh , no , it was n't us this time . 
  i 'm ok , thank you for your care . 
  [ wiki has some interesting links to read about this plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_dropshot ) . 
   if we forget nukes that 's why we have enough to melt half of the world into radioactive glass . 
   however there is one guy ( russia ) trying to intimidate the others by fooling around with the button . 
  everything started when us prepared a plan of total annihilation of ussr with nuclear weapons . 
  it 's declassified now , they were really planning to kill most of us . 
  since then , any of their friends are under a constant treat of being eliminated too . 
   the guy ignores the rules like all major players with nukes . 
  even israel with its tiny nuclear stockpile violates the rules . 
   most people understand what russia wants . 
  it 's really not that difficult . 
   how about you stop invading countries like bombing yugoslavia and making kosovo an independent country or killing a leader of libya and escalating civil war there ? 
  just recent examples . 
   how much effort does russia make to understand others ? 
  the west is far more transparent for us than russia to the west . 
  now we are talking in english , for example , but average american or british person do n't understand russian . 
  for me it 's no surprise at all that there are very few real experts on russia in western countries , most others are only pretending to know something . 
  we are not the only one country that has disputes about borders with neighbors . 
  [ most countries are involved ] ( http://metrocosm.com/disputed-territories-map.html ) . 
  i agree . 
  if some people are not willing to understand us , it would be better if they would fear . 
  farewell !, 
  cpr could n't ressurect fully dead person . 
  after `` pang '' they are still alive . 
  any corrections are welcomed !, 
  i do n't know , i 'm from russia , not from france . 
  so , they would be governmental officials ? 
  - mr. miller , 2nd class civil pervert . 
  [ like this one ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/matrix/images/f/f3/architect_%26_neo.png/revision/latest?cb=20110216143803 ) ? 
  my question is not about laws or norms , i am curious who would stare at this 8 hours a day , in 1000 screens . 
  who would watch all the videos , some sort of special perverts ? 
  so , only formal correctness at a time of action matters , right ? 
  for over two years . 
   people do n't do this shit anymore though i have n't noticed . 
  whole my life i 'm witnessing how wars are still going all around the world . 
  including europe , when nato attacked an independent country . 
  rhetorics changed , not the essence of war . 
  i doubt that they are number one targets now . 
  we do n't care much about them .
