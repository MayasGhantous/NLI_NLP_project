  of course they can . 
  but without them thy have far better chances of survival in case of war . 
  in fact , if they would deploy nukes on their soil , it would made them number one targets . 
  if you think that it 's smart to call someone a bot , you are wrong . 
  because they are not complete idiots . 
  deploying nuclear weapons on our borders means annihilation of those targets after a few minutes in case of nuclear war . 
  for them it would mean ceasing of existence of their tiny nations . 
  for what , for interests of us or uk politicians ? 
  oh , our specialist in international law is here !, 
  remind me please , have they occupied moscow according to the international law ? 
  why do people try to convince me that the short historical memory is very good and a truly european way ? 
  these people did the same thing with us , they are no better . 
  does it cancel the fact that they did the same with us ? 
  they occupied us too . 
  how so ? 
   well , finland does have a huge artillery , the biggest one in europe . 
  we are a part of europe too . 
  we have a very similar page in our history with them in the role of villains . 
  we commemorate liberation of russia from occupation by lithuania and poland on november 4 . 
  do you have some kind of icebreakers ? 
  not only moscow is protected , other major cities too , especially in vicinity of northern korea . 
  and we have multiple levels of this system , including ground-to-space missiles with nuclear warheads . 
  s-400 is only a part of echeloned defense system . 
  s-400 is not just an anti-aircraft system , it protects primarily against winged and ballistic missiles . 
  we had similar systems around moscow since 1950-s , this is a new generation of them . 
  this bill equalizes punishment between family members and all the rest people . 
  you could pinch your neighbor and it will be an administrative misdemeanor ( no harm to health is made , only suffering from pain ) , but in case of family members it turns automatically as criminal offense , which is illogical . 
  of course , criminal law is rarely enforced in such cases , because policemen are people too . 
  that 's the intent . 
  if someone beats somebody causing minor physical harm , it 's still a criminal offense . 
  a few thoughts : '' \u043f\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0438 '' in russian law is an action which does n't lead to any health harm , otherwise it 's classified by penal code , article 115 . 
  no changes here . 
  it 's not a criminal offence in all cases except for family members now . 
  proposed norm equalize punishment , making system more logical . 
  in my opinion , it 's better to decriminalize it and fine people more often than to preserve it in the criminal code and close eyes on most minor cases , as now . 
  there is a small-scale kerch-taman ' fracture zone there , even with [ some volcanoes ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdfj0sdaze ) . 
  they erupt mud instead of lava , but still it 's an engineering problem . 
  situation with opioids is indeed their responsibility . 
  as a lot of other atrocities . 
  we are not ideal , of course , we have our own problems , but we are not blind to deny their involvement . 
  and who is the main sponsors of heroin in russia ? 
  usa , which maintains ` close ties ' with afghani producers . 
  maybe in the progressive european ukraine , 
  for such crime bribes are really huge . 
  for true connoisseurs only . 
  right . 
  if tobacco would cost as much as cocaine per weight , in russia problem would be practically solved . 
  have you read the article ? 
  selling would be banned for the generation which just starts their lives , it would be enforced for them in 2033 . 
  to sell it , they need either to grow it themselves , or smuggle tons of it trough border . 
  do you know what happens with drug dealers in russia ? 
  * 4 to 8 years in camp or prison for producer or seller if they were alone and sold/produced a small quantity . 
  * committed by multiple people in collusion - 8 to 15 years . 
  * by organized crime group , or if drugs were sold to minors , or if it was a large quantity - 10 to 20 years . 
  * for very large quantity - 15 to 20 years . 
  when those kids would be adult enough to face this ban , tobacco would be expensive . 
  it already costs much more than few years ago , and prices would grow steadily . 
  i 'm not an expert . 
  in my opinion people here mostly start to use drugs because they are affordable . 
  raising prices and pressure on tobacco producers would gently push them out of market . 
  take the famous russian drugs `` crocodile '' or `` screw '' - both were made from cheap legal substances bought at the nearest drugstore . 
  `` boyarishnik '' tincture is way cheaper than vodka . 
  we even had a drug named '' [ armenian pie ] ( http://russian_argo.academic.ru/259/\u0430\u0440\u043c\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439_\u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043e\u043a ) '' - a piece of stale bread was smeared with shoe polish . 
  bread soaked in psychoactive substances , then polish was scraped off and bread was consumed . 
  it was n't because shoe polish was illegal , it was because in army soldiers had free bread and shoe polish . 
  why ? 
  we have a very low life expectancy , partly because of oncological , pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases caused by widespread heavy smoking . 
  tobacco is very addictive , in fact , more than most popular illegal drugs . 
  gradually banning it is a good strategy . 
  they could grow their own tobacco if they wish . 
  it 's called `` machorka '' here . 
  like people who grow weed in a special growing box . 
  they would be free to smoke , selling tobacco to them would be restricted . 
  that 's a big difference . 
  goose grease is a good solution .

  soldiers died in combat and from tropical diseases . 
  10 000 russian troops died to help your country became independent from ottoman empire . 
  that 's what i 'm talking about : us deploys nuclear tanks at our borders . 
  no , we do n't discuss french occupation here because french taxpayers currently give money to your country to make it part of eu , and russia currently do not give you money . 
  for your interest , french army is still occupying so-called `` overseas territories '' like french polynesia and other remaining colonies here and there . 
  who talks about it here ? 
  i do n't know about american tanks , [ ours are capable of shooting nuclear charges ] ( http://wsyakayawsyachina.narod.ru/history/nuclear_museum/p12_a.jpg ) . 
  people with negative historical experience are fascists and others are not , according to your theory . 
  like `` 24 millions were killed during wwii , including fathers of currently living people , then former allies planned to kill people who survived with nuclear weapons . 
  but let 's forget it all ! '', 
  widespread amnesia is a recipe for not being fascists in our situation ? 
   for putin it is his great ancestors from soviet union he was born in soviet union like most of us . 
  i doubt that , to say , mussolini was born in ancient rome . 
  it seems to me that you are confusing mythology with history of one current generation . 
  thank you !, 
  in your opinion , admiration of `` great ancestors '' is an essential part of the phenomenon we are talking about ? 
  fascists admire , others do not , or what ? 
  on this sub we have a lot flairs for regions of countries , if you have noticed . 
  but not for regions of russia , of course , because of political bias . 
  from your definition it seems that most powerful countries in the world history were fascist , no ? 
  roman empire , qin china , chengiz-khan horde , charlemagne empire ...
