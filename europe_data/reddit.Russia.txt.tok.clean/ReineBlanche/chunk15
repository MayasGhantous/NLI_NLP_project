  yep , we did , in 1783 . 
  since then our forces was there . 
   dude , putin 's russia looks more and more like a fascist country by definition . 
  by what definition exactly ? 
  post it here please , it would be interesting . 
  of course , from quebec it is way more obvious what 's happening on streets in russia . 
  the reality is that movements of russian nationalists are under almost total state control . 
  they are allowed to march once a year with approved slogans . 
  from [ their official site ] ( http://rmarsh.info/novosti/russkij-marsh-doloj-okkupatsiyu-moskva-2016-fotoobzor-kolonn.html ) , main slogans : `` we are against prohibition of being russian . 
  down with occupation ! '', 
  `` for freedom of speech and meetings ! '', 
  `` russians have rights too ! '', 
  `` nationalism is a struggle to renew the state '' `` for the europe of homelands '' `` against drugs and corruption . 
  for justice , healthy lifestyle and right to have weapons . '', 
  `` down with dictatorship !, 
  we need de-sovietization ! '', 
  `` slavic people , unite ! '', 
  as you can see , nothing like `` x-nationality out '' . 
  they are * for * russians and slavic people in general , not against particular nationalities . 
  do you feel the difference ? 
  this sub deserves it . 
  for most people of this sub the whole story with crimea is in the field of propaganda war . 
  for me it 's an absolutely real place , i 've been there a lot of times on vacations , i have friends from crimea , i have pictures drawn by crimean tatar painter hanging on my walls . 
  and most western media hysteria about crimea sounds ridiculous for me . 
  i totally agree with you . 
  in crimea we should allow to vote only the true local population - neanderthals . 
  otherwise it 's just silly . 
  the fact that they are allowed to say such things in public characterize if not the whole ukraine , but at least their impotent government . 
   it 's not like people earning proper wages will suddenly drop their jobs in droves just to stay at home . 
  the real perspective for them is to became jobless or precarious workers in the next 20 years . 
  for the youth it means that their chances of being full-time employed with long-term guarantees as it was , to say , in 1960-s are minuscule . 
  they face a very important decision : should they waste time for future career when there are no more guarantees that they would have it at all . 
  take my job as an example . 
  i am a geodetic engineer , a guy who stays in a white hard hat behind a big yellow tripod and watches in sophisticated apparatus to measure things . 
  50 years ago a lot of people were needed to do the job : geodesist for measurements , technician to aid him , office workers to make calculations , drawers to make plans and so on . 
  now one man does it all with computers and modern robotized equipment . 
  next step is even more automation , when one man would do the same amount of work as 20 people now . 
  voila , where 100 people was needed 50 years ago , one would do it in next 10-20 years . 
  what would do the rest of them ? 
  became web-designers , 3d-printmakers or professional bloggers ? 
  they would became precarious and then jobless , despite their high skills and investments in education . 
  that 's why guaranteed basic income is introduced - to divide wealth from highly-automated enterprises between people who are not needed anymore at all . 
  it is not about helping people who are currently jobless , it 's about joblessness as a global phenomena that is a life-long reality for the most people . 
  it fits pretty well in a flow of hysteria towards our country . 
  it is a good example of bad social science study . 
  the big question of guaranteed basic income is : we do n't know how society would live if everyone would get it . 
  not a specific group of people who are currently in trouble , not a specific age group , but * everyone * . 
  otherwise results would be totally inconclusive . 
  no one knows what would happen with already working people and , much more important , how young people would plan their lives . 
  they have a perspective of automation of most jobs . 
  would they take the same paths of personal development as their fathers ? 
  it is an opened question . 
  now it is more an attempt to substitute payments for different reasons with one unified procedure than a real guaranteed basic income . 
  it 's a wrong approach . 
  guaranteed basic income should be either for everyone , or for no one . 
  giving it only to unemployed will yield biased experiment outcomes . 
  in russian , punctuation is far more complex than in english . 
  since we think in russian , comma should be there in our language , 
  there are about 750 trains , only few of them are special : `` watercolor '' - from the video above .

  in moscow metro we have also a few museum trains . 
  they have left rows of seats removed and installed reproductions of paintings in frames instead of them .

  in russian and ukrainian languages every word has gender . 
  in papua new guinea . 
  in a beautiful box , from dedushka moroz himself !, 
  license was suspended for about ten days until they solved issues . 
  now it is fully restored .

  their kids are invited in kremlin to celebrate new year !, 
  i thought that schwarzwald looks like [ this ] ( http://cdn01.ru/files/users/images/65/7b/657b755584a9e1d137cf8aa058823b82.jpg ) . 
  it is much more comfortable for people to think that they do something by their own will than to admit that they were manipulated for profit of completely other people , like foreign politicians . 
  of course there were n't , our forces were in crimea just in time for preventing this . 
  why do you think that a democracy is the only way ? 
  have you considered a possibility that some societies are ok with another forms of power , like russia or china ? 
  are you threating me personally ? 
  no , it 's not a proper way to have a discussion . 
  `` 28 panfilovtsev '' is a crowdfunded film , not a hollywood blockbuster . 
   well firstly your mission was to not let the violence get out of hand in the first place georgian tanks and artillery was effectively stopped - as you said . 
   you surely had the right to react defensively to protect yourself , not to launch an all-out invasion to georgia do you understand that we are a country with 14 000 nuclear bombs , 22 000 tanks and 40 millions of potential conscripts ? 
  all-out invasion of a georgia-sized country would take 2 days at most in case of real intention to invade . 
  any of my arguments would be attacked by ukrainians and called lies . 
  there is no source that could convince you . 
  his photos with firearms would be called photoshopped , screenshots of his extremist comments - post-edited , journalist investigation - biased , and so on . 
  nothing could convince ukrainians . 
   you had a mandate for a peacekeeping mission , not to take part on either of the side what should troops do when they are attacked ? 
  [ here is a footage made by soldiers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htynhmkwgrs ) in 2008 . 
  does it count that they are taking sides when georgian tank shoots at light-armed peacekeepers ?
