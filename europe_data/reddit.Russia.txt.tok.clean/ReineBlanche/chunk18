  also she is a [ general ] ( http://cdn-st2.rtr-vesti.ru/p/o_1199627.jpg ) now . 
  i 've encountered estonians who speak russian better than me . 
  however , some estonians speak russian with `` elongated '' vowels , `` doubled '' '' \u0422 '' . 
  finnish people often speak russian with `` deep '' , non-palatalised '' \u0422 '' and non-palatalised '' \u041b '' , sometimes with `` doubled '' '' \u041c '' . 
   is russian her native language ? 
  in dagestan most people are bi-lingual , they know their local language to speak at their community and russian to speak with other people , including other dagestanian ethnicities . 
  in the second video , do you hear their `` round '' , well-pronounced '' \u041e '' ? 
  they barely pronounce '' \u042f '' at the end of words ( \u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0430 , \u0434\u043b\u0438\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0430 ... ) , '' \u0414 '' and '' \u0422 '' sounds similar in some positions ... 
  differences are minor , but still noticeable . 
  do you hear something distinctive in [ this video ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qaw8pirkgtk ) ? 
  ( dagestanian accent ) in [ second one ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tkihoeukphg ) ? 
  st. petersburg probably has almost `` no accent '' . 
  i like accents of arkhangel ` sk and nizhniy novgorod - they are `` soft '' and sound traditionally for my ears . 
  accents of north-eastern peoples like mansi or chuckhi are hard to understand . 
  the most diverse are accents of caucasus , since their own languages have very complex phonology . 
  m-m , whataboutism !, 
  good , good , release your anger !, 
  in the west you are far less critical to your own propaganda than we in russia . 
  if things are called `` good '' or `` democratic '' , it does n't mean they really are . 
  if someone is called a `` respected expert '' , it does n't mean that he is not a payed scum . 
  the key is in inability of media to be neutral in a globalist world . 
  if you live in a small town with a few thousands of inhabitants and have a local newspaper , it could be more or less neutral . 
  for example it could post list of all people deceased in a week with causes of their deaths . 
  mr. smith , died at 82 of heart attack . 
  ms. collins , died at 24 from head injury . 
  things got changed when the local newspaper adds : ... from head injury caused by axe of ms. blackwidow . 
  no more neutrality already at this point - murder became more important than heart attack . 
  journalism ends and propaganda begins . 
  in global world media is picking events and make news from a biased perspective . 
  voila , they are making propaganda . 
  if they call themselves `` journalists '' it is a propagandist trick to make you believe in their biased worldview . 
  yep , but in court it would be an aggravating circumstance . 
  self-defence law is complicated here . 
  in cases of attack of a visibly pregnant woman or a single minor it is easy to be convicted for over-than-necessary action . 
  too long to ride sitting . 
  not every country in europe , i 'd say . 
  people of some new countries do n't know what is it . 
  we live under a treat of nuclear destruction since 1950s , so , nothing new for us . 
  of course . 
  it is the only way for people of countries like baltics to feel themselves used by they friends as a shield which would be destroyed first in case of conflict with completely other countries . 
  total coincidence !, 
   can you show any hard facts that western agencies have been involved ? 
  if you do n't know russian , you can use google translate . 
   because the ukraine government was not the corrupt russian style one anymore new ones are [ as corrupt as former ] ( http://ti-ukraine.org/en/news/media-about-us/6547.html ) . 
   russia too ceased to exist during the chechenya war chechnya declared independency in 1991 , but now its people consider themselves as citizens of russia . 
  yes , our former country , ussr , ceased to exist in 1991 . 
   a couple of drunk hooligans do not represent the country nor the government . 
  you could read more about it on [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_odessa_clashes ) . 
  please , be careful if you would search corresponding photos , they are truly nsfw . 
  ukrainians burned other ukrainians . 
  this event started their civil war . 
  before it everything could be settled with peace . 
   after being for all intents and purposes invaded by russian soldiers russian soldiers was there since crimea became part of russia in 1783 . 
   in addition , anyone with a russian passport was allowed to vote in the referendum even now it is not easy to get in crimea using sea route since ground routes on ukrainian territory are closed . 
  how do you think , how much additional people was there at the moment of referendum ? 
  like 100 persons ? 
  troops were not voting . 
   because 99,9 % of the maidan was composed of either foreign spies or paid for collaborators nothing like that . 
  it composed mostly of local activists and ordinary citizens . 
  what really matter is who were instigators . 
  `` arab spring '' revolutions happened also like movements for freedom . 
  do you think it is coincidence that they all started in a couple of years by like scenarios ? 
  it is not a conspiracy theory , it is fact - foreign `` advisors '' played major roles . 
   just like in ossetia in what ossetia , northern or southern ? 
  northern is a part of russia . 
  in southern there were our peacekeepers to stop civil war between them and georgia , with international mandate to do it . 
  it was not czech guys who were killed because saakashvili desired a blitzkrieg to conquer that small nation . 
  it was our peacekeepers who was killed and civilians of nation most of which live in russia . 
  but everybody in the west seems to forgot it . 
  only propaganda remained . 
  [ read about it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-georgian_war#large-scale_conflict ) . 
  western politicians inspired and supported their `` maidan '' coup , ukraine ceased to exist in its former borders and collapsed in a few regions . 
  especially after pro-maidan protesters burned alive other ukrainians in odessa . 
  people of crimea declared themselves independent and voted for inclusion into russian federation on a referendum . 
  for us western involvement in the coup at independent and sovereign country is as unacceptable , as crimean referendum to the west . 
  of course they used the cat 's paw to do it . 
  continuing your analogy : fortunately i do n't own your car given to me just by accident . 
  imagine if we are one family with you . 
  far relatives . 
  we live under one roof and you accidentally give rights to your car to me , just as a symbolic gesture . 
  then we have a disaster , our common home is destroyed . 
  we are seeking for new homes and our relationships worsen . 
  my new friends persuade me that you are a bad person , and i should let them drive your car , which is formally mine . 
  and then you claim it back . 
  who is right from moral point of view , me and my new friends or you , the true owner of the car ? 
  crimea is not a car , it 's a nice place inhabited by nice people . 
  they made their choice to be with us , not with ukraine . 
  we have common language , common culture and they are far closer with us than with western ukrainians . 
  dividing of ussr by its administrative borders into new countries was a mistake that disregarded opinions of local populations . 
  i am tired to explain this . 
  much simpler : it does n't belong to ukraine anymore . 
   neither the us nor the uk invaded ukraine should i mention their plot and support for second `` maidan '' revolution ? 
  of course they are not involved , of course . 
  there were no ngo 's funded from us and europe , there were no commands from the us embassy in kiev , no foreign advisors , nothing like that . 
  it would me much harder to do with a country weaponed with nukes . 
  ukrainian people were fooled by false promises . 
  their country were so sweet target for giving them expensive loans , to get their rich agricultural lands , their manpower to work in rich countries of europe , their seacoasts to deploy new nato bases . 
  now they have civil war and europe are failing to help them . 
  europe is betraying ukraine . 
  that 's the story .
