  if no , they are doomed . 
  nothing special . 
  it was a metaphor . 
  i am pretty sure european university would get license back after dealing with some minor issues . 
  license suspension in such cases is used as a measure to warn an organization that it really should make all the documents and meet standards right . 
  since 2015 , licenses of 151 educational organizations in russia [ were suspended ] ( http://obrnadzor.gov.ru/common/upload/doc_list/perechen_oo_iskluchenie_iz_reestra_litsenziy_s_01_01_2015.pdf ) . 
  when sanitary inspection comes to the cafe and founds some spoiled food at the kitchen , it 's a similar situation . 
  spoiled food should be thrown out , everything should be washed before their next visit . 
  there is no hope that they would n't notice it next time . 
  with * drastic measures * agains russian population latvians has a chance to die-out much quicker , i hope you understand it . 
  freedom of speech is very important , but people have no obligations to pay money to another people who wish only to speak bad things about them . 
  on the photograph you can see how russian family in a typical traditional house takes tea break . 
  in the corner you can see christian orthodox icon . 
  father wears massive beard , mother wears apron and headscarf . 
  two of the kids are in russian naval underwear . 
  adults are billionaires from russian forbes list . 
   however i think that in the winter the wood must not be much for an insulation . 
  in past times there were much more old trees , hence logs with [ larger diameter ] ( https://pp.vk.me/c629529/v629529917/26cc0/os17m3si1me.jpg ) were used for construction . 
  one of the key components of izba is [ russian oven ] ( http://1drevo.ru/uploads/foto5/russkaya-pechj2.jpg ) , it brings a lot of heat compensating for heat losses . 
  at nighttime it was [ used as a place for sleeping ] ( http://www.estherlederberg.com/eimages/extracurricular/dickens%20universe/international/russian%20oven-bed%203.jpg ) . 
  that 's why russian fairy-tale heroes are often depicted on the oven . 
  for example , bogatyr ilya muromets was a quadriplegic who spent on it 33 years and then became one of the most powerful warriors as a result of a miracle . 
  emelya the fool used russian oven as a magical vehicle for transport , and so on . 
  it is a home of russian billionaire [ german sterligov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_sterligov ) . 
  he likes traditional values and lifestyle . 
  a lot of people here still live in houses like this , they are called `` russian izba '' - our traditional architecture . 
  in google image search there are plenty of examples , try it . 
  i used to live in such house during summer vacations when i was a kid . 
  at winter my grandparents lived in modern city apartments , in warmer seasons they lived in their village house , izba , just like you see on the photo . 
  this particular family owns about 200 million us dollars , so she knows what she is doing . 
  oh , poor lady , she is dressed improperly for the season . 
  it should be something like [ this ] ( https://i04.fotocdn.net/s12/218/pin_m/459/2343160537.jpg ) . 
  i like it . 
  in my childhood it was a bird flying from camera , not cheese . 
  as fake , as foreigner or as a mentally retarded to be precise . 
  when i think of finland , i think of soviet-finnish film `` tulitikkuja lainaamassa ( 1980 ) '' . 
  do you like it ? 
  we smile when we are happy or see something fun , but we do n't smile on purpose . 
  [ again ] ( http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/latest_news/vladimir_bukovsky_to_be_prosecuted_over_indecent_images_of_children/index.html ) ?!, 
   27/04/2015  the crown prosecution service ( cps ) has authorised the prosecution of vladimir bukovsky , 72 , for five charges of making indecent images of children , five charges of possession of indecent images of children and one charge of possession of a prohibited image . 
   jenny hopkins , chief crown prosecutor for the cps in the east of england , said : `` following an investigation by cambridgeshire police , we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to prosecute vladimir bukovsky in relation to the alleged making and possessing of indecent images of children . 
  it is alleged that , collectively , the images meet the definition of categories a , b and c , as defined by sentencing council guidelines . 
  maybe [ this ] ( http://politikus.ru/uploads/posts/2014-06/1401926479_sterligov_text6.jpg ) one . 
  we have the [ federal state statistics service ] ( http://www.gks.ru/wps/wcm/connect/rosstat_main/rosstat/en/main/ ) which publish a lot of up-to-date information . 
  they give data for the central government , 
  at least gfk recognizes crimea as russian territory . 
  [ at the regional level ] ( http://www.gks.ru/wps/wcm/connect/rosstat_main/rosstat/ru/statistics/tariffs/# ) . 
  postcode system is not widely used here for purposes other than sending post . 
  why russia is grey ? 
  we are a part of europe too . 
   thing is , we ca n't get the status of a returning compatriot easily , since the reasons . 
  what reasons ? 
   what we are trying to do is , going to the homeland and stay there as foreign nationals and even with that , people face stupid stuff . 
  it is called `` bureaucracy '' . 
  procedures demand time and resources , that 's true . 
  i already posted some statistical data - we are talking not about something impossible . 
   in two republics circassians are the minority and i doubt if the russian majority in adygea or the mountain turk majority in karachay-cherkessia are favouring circassians , or actually made-up sub-circassian identities being recognised as the indigenous people but russia just gave the status . 
  why do you think so ? 
  people there talk their national languages , local culture is promoted in school education . 
  they have local laws , local budget and so on . 
  what else should be done , speaking realistically ? 
   russia was the one who has taken in the north caucasian mountainous republic and not just divided it into pieces , but also divided circassians into more made-up pieces . 
  should i remember why does it happened ? 
  it happened because of violent raids of some caucasian peoples on russian and tatar territories . 
  raids was a strategy of living for those people . 
  not accidental military accidents , no , a system , raids repeated almost every year from at least xv century . 
  our army put an end to this practice . 
  many people died or were relocated as a result , yes , but let 's not pretend that they all were peaceful and harmless . 
   there are only some ridiculous tiny quotas allowing some dozens to return to kabardino-balkaria and adygea yes there are quotas because those republics are rather small and not so rich . 
  we are a united country , it is not necessary to wait for citizenship right where you plan to live in the future - most other regions have quotas too and they are not fulfilled . 
  they are planning to be citizens of russian federation , not some particular region of it since there is only one type of citizenship and one country . 
  in short : * aquire status of returning compatriot . 
  * be a temporarily or permanently residing foreign person on russian soil . 
  * have a local registration in desired region . 
  again , if quota in one region ended , you could wait in another . 
  * refuse previous non-russian citizenship . 
  main conditions to be eligible for this program are : * be at least 18 years old and sane . 
  minors enter country with their parents . 
  * know spoken and written russian language , at least to some extent . 
  * have no criminal past , no terrorist or extremist plots . 
   being indigenous or not has nothing do with who is going to vote for what , but has to do with only the fact that a nation and an ethnicity is indigenous to some place or not . 
  all of us are indigenous to africa in some sense . 
  this is just a fact - modern people originate from africa , with no legal consequences at all . 
  if someone wants to change established federal and regional laws in russia , for example to change inner administrative borders or local constitutions , referendum is a proper way for doing it , until it happens , plain facts have no force of law . 
   we are also asking right to return to circassia , and right to become citizens and maybe the things other repatriates are getting from russian federation for the sake of equality . 
  you have this right , i 've checked , circassians used it many times since 1991 , it is not something impossible . 
  in turn , russia have a right to manage its immigration politics . 
  now there are regions with priority quotas for migrants and refugees . 
  since 2014 , [ 4.3 millions ] ( http://www.migration-patent.ru/index/razdel3/chislo-bezhencev-iz-ukrainy-v-rossiyu ) of refugees entered russia . 
  if quotas ended for entering circassian republics it means that people should either wait , or move first to another region of russia , get citizenship there and then migrate to their homeland republics , already as citizens . 
   being recognised as the indigenous people in the all historical circassia for the starters . 
  to make it happen your people should became russian citizens first , then to initiate referendum , then to get approval of other local inhabitants as a result , including all other ethnicities . 
  things work that way - we are one country now , there are no independent circassia anymore and people are free to settle where they want . 
  there is also another point - a lot of syrian circassians are professional warriors who joined anti-assad opposition . 
  obviously , if they would try to enter russia , a deep checks would be necessary . 
  so , what do you want exactly ? 
  there are national republic [ karachay-cherkessia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karachay-cherkessia ) , it has its own [ constitution ] ( http://constitution.garant.ru/region/cons_karach/ ) , cirkassian language has an official status there . 
  circassians are recognized as indigenous people . 
  maybe the question is in moving borders of the region into krasnodar kray or what ? 
  it could be discussed , regional borders changed a lot of times since 1991 .
