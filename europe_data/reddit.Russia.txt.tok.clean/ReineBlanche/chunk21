  but i do n't think they would be moved , since in sochi there are almost no circassians right now , locals would be against it . 
  there is a special [ federal program of returning compatriots to russia ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0430_\u0432\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f_\u0441\u043e\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432_\u0432_\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044e ) . 
  183 146 persons returned in 2015 . 
  they got money , medical insurance , free education , and so on . 
  they obtain citizenship by accelerated procedure ( as fast as after 6 months of residence ) . 
  why do n't those people use it ? 
  demanding compensations for genocide is not realistic since russian federation is a legal successor of ussr , and ussr were not a legal successor or russian empire . 
   cause after 1990 it sure did not happen . 
  really ? 
  and [ who are those people ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w95kxg2us8 ) i 've already said what is a realistic possibility for an integration . 
  your states are not mono-ethical , it is not wise to pretend to be so . 
  in case of domestic aggression against local russians war is a real possibility to protect them . 
  and i am trying to say to you what the reason why do your countries fear an invasion is a collective fail in integrating those people . 
  in making them organic parts of your societies . 
  many wrong moves were made against them . 
   well like our collaborators were not executed when soviets rolled in again there were no military parades with former ss veterans during the period of independence of baltic states ? 
   would be inefficient way to do just because of small populations size it would be efficient to proclaim russian as the only language in russia , yet we have chosen to support and respect a lot of local cultures despite its inefficiency in administrative sense . 
   and you would integrate minorities in 36 hours by `` hopping it would never happen '' ? 
  i am sorry but how that works ? 
  i hope that your countries would be wise enough to integrate russian minorities and not pose them in a situation when they would need our support to protect them . 
  in crimea or donbass it was exactly one of the reasons why locals supported russia - they were sacred by armed nationalists from western ukraine , like regiment `` azov '' or `` trains of friendship '' . 
  ukraine already made this mistake and will pay a huge price for the decision of their not-so-clever politicians . 
  36 hours is a time needed to fully capture baltic states by force in case of war . 
   cause you have to learn official languages . 
  i 've studied in a region with one official language . 
  in tatarstan people learn two languages , tatarian and russian . 
  in tuva - tuvinian and russian . 
  and so on . 
  in all those regions all the laws and official documents , signs in shops and other things exist in two languages simultaneously . 
  everyone who participated was either executed immediately , or died in labour camps . 
   cause to my knowledge it did happen and i would bet it happened with local populace participation guess what happened with collaboratinists ? 
  their fate was grim . 
   share how you would do that . 
  i hope it would never happen . 
   as soon as latvian is one of official russian federation languages . 
  do we have now latvian minority which live compactly on some small territory ? 
   to encourage those people to emigrate back to russia . 
  in other words , to push them out , or even to purge them ? 
   if you occupy a country , you are called an `` occupant '' . 
  if you make a revolt , you are called traitors and separatists . 
  see , this game has two ends and it could be played forever . 
   ~ 5 % of population is russians here . 
  why should we even consider forcing 95 % learning russian ? 
  as you may know , russia has a lot of official languages . 
  proportion of tuvins to russians is even smaller , yet their language has official status . 
   is that our involvement . 
  later on being occupied by them is also involvement ? 
  so , no participation in holocaust , no local ss legions , m-m ? 
   because part of them just do n't want that . 
  it 's a big question for your societies how to integrate them and your fail , since more than generation have passed since your independence . 
  we could integrate them in 36 hours , you know it , and they know too . 
  i 've meant we do n't have specific knowledge of integrating those people . 
  specify in laws that russian is one of the official state languages . 
  issue citizenship to all of them , irregardless of their knowledge of local languages , culture or anything like that . 
  it should be a rule - if a person with soviet citizenship was at your territory at a moment of proclaiming independency , citizenship should automatically be granted . 
  for those people and their first-generation descendants . 
  admit involvement in wwii at the side of germany , collective loss , and close this page of history . 
  no need to provoke each other with neo-nazism or neo-stalinism . 
  the problem is in discrimination , especially in estonia and latvia . 
  if they call people `` occupants '' and humiliate them for 25 years , no surprise that some part of them wish some form of revenge . 
  we do n't have quarter of middle eastern population . 
  their only hope is to fully integrate russian minorities into their social system . 
  european leaders do n't seek for closer ties with ukraine , they would like to use them . 
  it 's not called cooperation , it 's exploitation . 
  visa-free travel regime is discussed for tourism only , not for workng visas . 
  no need for your politicians to invite them in mutually-profitable relationships , just give them credits and demand riches in exchange . 
  all those story is revolving around european or russian loans , not about cooperation with eu . 
  i 've just realized that my career choice could be wrong . 
  maybe i could be a nice ambassador ? 
  try to think of it as about starbucks or mcdonalds . 
  they have their own brand and corporate style , they talk in specific patterns , they have a lot of local dealers . 
  they are a big transnational business . 
  those are not the saddest at all . 
  i like this elephant !, 
  who knows what happened . 
  try again later ? 
  have you discussed the situation with moderators ? 
  chechnya now is a peaceful region , war is in the past . 
  bribe is a wrong word in this context , they got resources to restore local economy , it 's closer to reparations or tribute . 
  local rulers got informal wages . 
  kadyrov is very effective in fighting local terrorists and radicals . 
  bribes in russia is either when you pay for something legal to be done ( \u043c\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0438\u043c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e ) , or for something illegal ( \u043b\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0438\u043c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e ) . 
  control over the citizens . 
  it 's our analogue of facebook , but authorities has full access to all the information . 
  it is complicated since we have a lot of immigrants from former soviet republics . 
  does it count ? 
  no , this is reincarnated jacques lacan with beard . 
  i am a totally russian commenter and i think that the article is a cheap propaganda . 
   banning of porn and piracy sites [ they are just owned by the state . 
  m-m , a happy muslim with lionet !, 
  we have the largest muslim population and we know how to live with them . 
   then they deported large parts of the local population and caused many of them to die . 
  let 's [ ask wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_priboi ) about those parts of local population ? 
   ... the soviets specifically targeted anti-soviet nationalists , supporters and kin of the forest brothers , veterans who served in the german military and relatives of those already held in the soviet gulag for alleged anti-soviet activities . 
  in other words , local nazis , collaborationists and their supporters . 
  german nation even today have solid understanding of their role in disaster happened in wwii , but not many other countries which participated in war on their side . 
  let 's not forget about this . 
  they supported nazis and participated in the holocaust , so they payed price for it . 
   the situation in ukraine is far from easy , but it is unrealistic to blame the scale of the protests on the west .
