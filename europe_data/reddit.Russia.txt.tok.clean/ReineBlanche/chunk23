  thank you . 
  and how will you rename your country if scotland and northern ireland will leave ? 
  very interesting . 
  tell me please , in case of independence , could scotland restore its own monarchy ? 
  he talked about disruptive technologies which are , according to his opinion , a treat to more conservative business models . 
  it 's by no way a conclusion of the council . 
  what will happen with nobility if they will decide to leave ? 
  the duke of edinburgh will became a foreigner ? 
  what is the possibility for wales to claim independency ? 
  any details on the deal itself ? 
   no information is given of verbal or non verbal consent from that point to the sexual act . 
  are they quadriplegic mutes ? 
   so you really think the russian military gives equippet worth millions to people who have 12 months of basic military training or outdated training ? 
  it became one year only recently , in past times it was 2-3 years . 
  a lot of universities have special obligatory military courses for training officers . 
  for example , geodesist in time of peace is also a military topographer in time of war . 
   the ukraine fools who use these signs that look like germanic runes are just nationalists with guns . 
  they are for sure not the majority of the people in the ukraine . 
  right you are , they are not the majority . 
   the russian neo nazis , motorcycle gangs , ultranationalists etc. 
  recently they had an allowed `` russian march '' in moscow which is a rare event . 
  part of them was pro-donbass and part strictly against the war . 
  i do n't know what do they really think . 
  ordinary people were stunned . 
  three years ago i watched translations from kiev and hoped they will not kill each other . 
  and then someone started to kill civilians on the streets of kiev , their president yanukovich fled as coward and all turned into chaos . 
  thank you . 
  i should consider paying more time to reading historical and economical literature . 
  i agree with you , it was a huge mistake to perform a referendum without international observers . 
  local administration was in hurry , and they are not very smart politicians to foresee implications of their actions . 
  as far as i know , they could n't easily became fully independent because of a peace treaty between turkey and russia signed in 1783 which states that crimea could not became independent or be passed to another country . 
  i am not a shill , i am a common man from moscow , geodetic engineer if it matters . 
  we have a snow-cover now which prevents precise measurements and i have some spare time to read reddit . 
  i was chocked when i opened it . 
  every day there are posts blaming us in all sins , like ` planning of invasion ' in baltic states or attempts to support one of candidates in the usa . 
  from the insider point of view it looks differently . 
  my great-aunt is living in a small town near luhansk , our family sends her medications . 
  for us they are not people from somewhere far away , they are our relatives . 
  of course we have some emotional involvement into the situation . 
  about khiva and bukhara , they were used as neutral countries during the times of empire and remained mostly self-governed . 
  no russian invaders in cork helmets carried by local slaves , nothing like that . 
  in depth , at conceptual level there are some common points with european colonial states , but i still do n't think its totally equal things . 
  uprising in donbass started after revolution in ukraine , especially after 42 opponents of the new regime were [ burned alive in odessa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_odessa_clashes#trade_unions_house_fire ) . 
  at the very beginning rebels in donbass had very few weapons , mostly from local military bases and police stations . 
  i think it 's evident that afterwards they were supported with more resources , including volunteers from russia , through not regular forces . 
  we still have a conscription and almost every man in russia served , so people know how to operate weapons including such sophisticated things as buk ground-to-air complex . 
  possibly we still have post-traumatic nightmares about nazis . 
  maybe their nationalists are just cute fighters for democracy who used bandera 's and ss flags to get us scared . 
  in crimea there were : * referendum on saving the soviet union in 1991 and remaining in a single state . 
  results were ignored . 
  * referendum on independence from ukraine in 1994 . 
  ignored both by ukraine . 
  * referendum on independence from ukraine in 2014 , ignored by international community . 
  no surprise , about 90 % of current local population are ethnically russians . 
  as you know , crimea was `` presented '' by nikita chruschev from rsfsr to ukrainian ssr . 
  again , at that time it was just a movement of administrative borders , nobody thought ussr will be broken in shards across them . 
  crimean tatars were not happy with ukraine also , but they dream to unite with turkey , not with russia . 
  i think by `` burkhand '' you assume bukhara and khiva ? 
  their people became nationals of soviet republics , by the way , most funded per capita from the central government in late soviet era . 
  i could find numbers , if you like . 
  not the entry ukrainian military are neo-nazis , of course , but at the beginning of conflict they established special forces of chasteners like regiment `` azov '' . 
  i am attaching a link to ukrainian wiki which include their [ emblem ] ( https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043a_\u00ab\u0410\u0437\u043e\u0432\u00bb ) ( contains nazi symbolics ) . 
  and this is a page on [ 2nd ss panzer division das reich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_ss_panzer_division_das_reich ) . 
  during their `` maidan '' revolution organization `` right sector '' played a major role . 
  again , [ page ] ( https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0439_\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 ) in ukrainian wiki on them , and a [ page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organization_of_ukrainian_nationalists#symbols ) on bandera 's movement , compare their flags . 
  tell me please , do you see any resemblance ? 
  of course its stupid , of course . 
  counting of potential `` what if '' losses is not a very good idea , especially for the countries which has not an `` arian '' population . 
  i am not talking about `` what if '' , romanian people or baltic states were allies of germany , not hypothetical but absolutely real ones . 
  how do you think , what should be done in such cases ? 
  it 's totally relevant , since nation which participated in killing 24 millions of soviet people must pay some kind of tribute to reconstruct what they had destroyed , at least a part of it . 
  it barely could be called `` leeching '' . 
  i could argue in details , but i doubt you like to listen to the facts . 
  take southern ossetia . 
  do you know what region do they border ? 
  northern ossetia , part of russia for a pretty long time . 
  they are a divided nation and they are not georgians . 
  most of them live in russia . 
  during soviet times borders between republics were not so important , but when it collapsed , administrative borders became state borders . 
  under current international law they can not unite anymore . 
  guess what followed ? 
  southern ossetia proclaimed independence in 1992 , when georgians started a civil war with them . 
  georgia at that time was independent for about a year or even less . 
  yes , our forces were sent there to stop the massacre , totally after international approval of this move . 
  after long years , new georgian president saakashvili performed a war crime by ordering his forces to attack ossetian civilians and russian peacekeepers . 
  a lot of our military and ossetian civilians were killed . 
  and only then we interrupted with force . 
  but you guys do n't need any details , as usual . 
  blame us , come on . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovrom on what side did romania participated in wwii ? 
  how successful they were ? 
  look on the current situation from a wider historical perspective . 
  there are a lot of now independent or semi-independent countries which were under our rule in the past . 
  but we never were a colonial empire , our approach is different . 
  donbass * is not * under our control since 1991 , and look what ukrainians made there , a civil war . 
  yes , we support local freedom fighters , without our help they had no chance against regiments of ukrainian neo-nazis . 
  it 's not a shit , it 's an opinion , point of view . 
  do you want to shut my mouth just because you do n't like it ? 
  by saying `` we '' i mean `` soviet people '' , a lot of ethnicities including ukrainians . 
  we rebuit eastern ukraine from ashes after wwii .
