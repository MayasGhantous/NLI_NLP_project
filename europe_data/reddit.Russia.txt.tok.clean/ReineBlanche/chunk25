  western analytics do n't understand it well because they are a product of capitalist society . 
  they tend to analyze russia and other countries in terms of their socio-economical realities . 
  sometimes it is successful , but not in our case . 
  in early 1990-s western analytics thought that we were building western-style democracy and capitalist state . 
  in reality , things were completely different and everything happened in estate framework , which persisted and evolved from times of great duchy of moscow . 
   his country interest ? 
  by creating a rulling , ubtouchable oligarchic class of several hundred people who literally owns large majority of country wealth ? 
  you do n't understand how is it working . 
  it was not putin who brought them to power and they are not a class . 
  russia is classless society , we have estates , like in ancient china or medieval europe . 
  `` oligarchs '' are top members of their respective estates . 
  they have all their riches because they have power , not vice versa . 
  in russia power means wealth , wealth without power means nothing . 
  estates need ways to balance their interests , the last resort to make a deal between them is the supreme leader . 
  he is not an autocrat at all , he can not act on his own . 
  what do you see as `` putin '' is just a result of consensus achieved by the estates . 
  if we have russian flairs near our usernames , it does n't mean we are trolls . 
  what is `` usual fake '' ? 
  over 1000 personal letters excavated from mud in novgorod and other cities ? 
  no , they are not fakes . 
  russian historical chronicles are faked ? 
  yes , the very first years of russian state are obscure . 
  but only for about 50-70 first years . 
  no , it is not , and the fact is well-proven with findings of birch bark manuscripts in novgorod . 
  they were unavailable to any medieval scribe , so it was impossible for them to fake linguistic details . 
  it 's not a secret at all . 
  we are participating in syrian campaign , we need to produce a lot of new recently developed weapons . 
  it costs a lot of money . 
  kievan rus ' started not in kiev , but in ladoga or novgorod . 
  capital were moved a lot of times due to the nature of succession to the throne . 
  maybe it looks idiotic , but ** it happened ** not so long ago , right in your country . 
  such processes evolve fast . 
  what do i see now ? 
  everyday in my feed there is an article about latvia or other baltic country preparing to war . 
  every single day . 
  hysteria is overwhelming . 
   it 's like implying that russians will begin a genocide against gays last time we had genocide of russians by chechen separatists , we still pay them tribute . 
  and it took a long time and a lot of lives of our soldiers to stop them . 
  not necessary a genocide , pogroms would be sufficient , like your country already did with jews during wwii . 
  afterwards most of them were killed , and not only by germans , but by local collaborationists also , you know . 
  passive majority of latvians would be , of course , against it , but they will be unable to stop a bunch of hot-headed nationalists . 
  i think it 's the only possible scenario of war and i hope it will never happen . 
  their nationalists could start repressions against local russians without direct invasion . 
  we have common ancestors !, 
  \u041f\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c - vulgarity , absence of personal culture , banality , but it 's more complex yet russians easily understand it . 
  \u0422\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430 - russian melancholy , but it 's much wider . 
  \u0413\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0439 - often incorrectly translated as `` terrible '' , but it has another nature . 
  \u0425\u0430\u043c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e - rudeness , insolence , cheekiness combined and multiplied by impunity . 
  scary !, 
  they are still cannibals ? 
   mururoa uninhabited atoll poisoned after two hundreds of nuclear explosions ? 
  in the past there were peace treaties , and from time to time mighty countries proclaimed they want peace in europe . 
  it 's no more than diplomacy in periods between wars . 
  now we have such a period when europe participate in wars abroad , trough they are not called wars , but `` counter-terrorist operations with un mandate '' . 
  do they have pirates in french polynesia ? 
  900 well-armed and trained professionals with warships and aviation against possible revolt of 30 local inhabitants ? 
  i do n't know . 
  so they want us to invest the money of our taxpayers to plant trees in ... sahara desert ?!, 
  and what will be the outcome ? 
  900 people in french polynesia . 
  to fight what , a canoe from cook islands ? 
  it can not climb that high . 
  forced to pick 4 kg of apples ... aw-aw !, 
  but estonian [ antonov an-2 ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:antonov_an-2..jpg?uselang=ru ) can not intercept commercial jet . 
  thank you for your response . 
  you may doubt my words , i have an official statistics . 
  how much time were you independent ? 
  from 1918 to 1940 , 22 years ? 
  something was built during this period , but not that much . 
  in times of russian empire you again were taught as one of special regions with special economical and political status . 
  if you know russian , [ read about it ] ( https://ru.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u041f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u043b\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f_\u043e\u043a\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f_\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u044b ) please . 
  my friend , i just know our history . 
  europe invaded us oftenly and captured moscow a lot of times . 
  to say : in 1610-1612 by poland and lithuania ( sic ! ) . 
  in 1812 by france . 
  city was pillaged and burned to ashes . 
  in 1941 almost sieged by germany , enemy forces were stopped with tremendous losses in 8 kilometers from the city . 
  russia have n't started neither of said wars . 
  english is not my mother tongue , maybe i was n't correct in my words . 
  i meant * relatively good * standards of living in baltic states during the soviet era were due to increased investments from other republics . 
  after the collapse of ussr you 've became independent , and again high european standards of living are due to investments , now from wealthier european countries . 
  i hope you are right . 
  the only free cheese is in the mouse trap . 
  are your people free to act on their own ? 
  to work on their land without moving to germany in search of better conditions , for example . 
  or to run their local businesses without being worried of competitors from abroad ? 
  i am living in moscow and i know that in case of nuclear war first and massive strike will definitely be right on the place where i live . 
  maybe in romania you are not worried about such things , i do n't know . 
   except that there are no nato missiles here yet . 
  warheads could be deployed anytime . 
  you asked me and i replied . 
  debunk my arguments one by one . 
  of course we do , because we must be able to make a counterstrike on enemy positions . 
  they are planning to attack us from close range , we are planning counterstrikes and your country are totally fucked because they use your land as a buffer to deploy their missiles . 
  sad but true . 
  are you free in your migrational politics ? 
  in your macro-economical decisions ? 
  maybe you still have your own monetary system ? 
  are you free in protecting domestic markets from global corporations ? 
  maybe you can participate in military treaties with anybody except for nato members and the usa ?
