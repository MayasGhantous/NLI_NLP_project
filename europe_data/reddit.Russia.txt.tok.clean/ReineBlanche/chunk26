  in other words , you already lack some features of a sovereign state . 
  i am not saying anything like that . 
  but the fact is : you consumed more than you produced . 
  it was a part of soviet strategy to prevent further revolutions in it 's western regions . 
  i am not agitating pro ussr or for lithuania to became part of russia in any way . 
  but have you asked yourself : by what cost all this economical growth happened ? 
  do you think that in case of nuclear war someone will respect international law or `` defensive '' nature of an alliance ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  it 's not russia 's business you say ? 
  no it is , because nuclear warheads could be placed on their territories anytime and they are damn close to our major cities . 
  we are surrounded by hostile forces as cou could 've noticed . 
  i am not talking about russia now , neither i am trying to say that we are better in some sense . 
  i am just saying what do i see . 
  i see that baltic countries after a short period of independence fell into new obligations , somewhat profitable for them since they produced less than they consumed at the end days of ussr . 
  but since they made their choices situation became irreversible for them , they can not became truly independent political and economical actors once again without very hard stress . 
  and their new friends are just using them as a source of cheap manpower and as a buffer in case of new pan-european war . 
  are you completely sure it 's not about loss of sovereignty ? 
  and if your people will change their minds and it will be too late to leave ? 
  do you think they will warmly support a new revolution and proclaiming of independence ? 
  i doubt it . 
   and people here have virtually no desire to leave them - because doing so would be insane yes , totally insane , i agree . 
  and it is equal to impossible . 
  maybe eu in short term is a very good thing . 
  but the cost of membership is a gradual loss of sovereignty . 
  on this particular subreddit a lot of posts is dedicated to new political decisions of eu bureaucrats . 
  not only about migrants , but about a lot of other things . 
  i am not a propagandist , just an ordinary man from russia . 
  i am sharing my opinion here . 
  baltic standard of living were supported by transactions from other soviet republics in the past and now they are supported by transactions from eu members . 
  it is not a well-known fact , but ussr spent [ way more money per person ] ( http://s13.stc.all.kpcdn.net/share/i/4/1054489/wx1080.jpg ) in baltic states than in rsfsr and local inhabitants in baltic states produced less than consumed . 
   whatever foreign forces are present on our territory are here with our consent do n't you think it 's strange that nato forces were withdrawn from some country only once in history , in case of france more than half a century ago ? 
   uk is leaving it if you have n't heard and how much financial losses would they suffer ? 
  but they are still a mighty country , not even comparable to , say , estonia . 
   at least we have the eu to blame they could n't left it . 
  it 's one way ticket - what was started as a trade union is turning into federalized state . 
  really ? 
  after crisis in greece they have n't possibility to leave eurozone . 
  great britain and northern ireland now have huge problems because they voted to leave eu and it is still not clear will they be able to complete the whole process or not . 
  and only france were able to * temporarily * left nato . 
  how this is a propaganda ? 
  it just means people do not want to stand for their own rights . 
  wish poklonskaya to be kicked out from her office ? 
  no problem , demand it . 
  go to court and claim that she has violated the law . 
  if it will be revealed that the judge is her accomplice , demand his/her withdrawal also . 
  do not vote for pro-government parties , vote for your local candidates and support them . 
  this is the main way of establishing a civil society . 
  we have five spaceports on russian territory : * [ plesetsk cosmodrome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plesetsk_cosmodrome ) * [ vostochny cosmodrome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vostochny_cosmodrome ) * [ kapustin yar cosmodrome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kapustin_yar ) * [ svobodny cosmodrome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/svobodny_cosmodrome ) * [ dombarovsky cosmodrome ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dombarovsky_ ( air_base ) ) and one maritime launch complex : * [ sea launch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sea_launch ), 
  and it 's totally ok if we are talking about one third of the population . 
  automatically , like in russia ? 
  maybe i 've missed something ? 
  you 've got independence and there were no serious attempts to stop your people from doing this . 
  but when it happened we all were equal soviet citizens and nobody expected that you will discriminate part of them by ethnicity . 
  if someone wish to re-view historical decisions , we could re-show them . 
  you know it . 
  not again , but from the very beginning of your independence . 
  and that is the reason why you are so scared now - you are awaiting revenge . 
  maybe it would be wise to stop discrimination , give ethnical russians in your countries citizenship irregardless of their knowledge of your language , all the political rights and admit that they are a legal and equal part of your new nation ? 
  wait-wait , if russia is a sole legal successor of the ussr , why must we have only our ethnical citizens but not all the wealth generated in your territory since 1945 ? 
  you claimed all the property rights but wish people to be withdrawn ? 
  ah , i see , you 've decided to treat those ordinary citizens as occupants ? 
  to openly discriminate them just because generations ago their ancestors moved to your territories ? 
  you ca n't point to the next door , people was at your territory when ussr collapsed and you could n't just say to them : `` you will not became citizens just because you live here , go away to your russia '' . 
  from [ russian constitution ] ( http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-01.htm ) :  article 68  1 . 
  the russian language shall be a state language on the whole territory of the russian federation . 
  the republics shall have the right to establish their own state languages . 
  in the bodies of state authority and local self-government , state institutions of the republics they shall be used together with the state language of the russian federation . 
  the russian federation shall guarantee to all of its peoples the right to preserve their native language and to create conditions for its study and development . 
   article 19  1 . 
  all people shall be equal before the law and court . 
  the state shall guarantee the equality of rights and freedoms of man and citizen , regardless of sex , race , nationality , language , origin , property and official status , place of residence , religion , convictions , membership of public associations , and also of other circumstances . 
  all forms of limitations of human rights on social , racial , national , linguistic or religious grounds shall be banned . 
  from law [ on languages of people of russian federation ] ( http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_law_15524/ ) , my translation :  article 5 . 
  guaranties of rights of citizens of russian federation irregardless their knowledge of language  1 . 
  the state guarantees of the russian federation citizens to the exercise of fundamental political , economic , social and cultural rights , regardless of their knowledge of a language . 
  knowing or not knowing the language can not be a reason to restrict the language rights of russian citizens . 
  violation of the linguistic rights of peoples and individuals shall entail liability under the law . 
  so yes , you can get citizenship if you do n't know russian . 
  and you could run public office at regional or municipal level . 
  as a federal level politician you must know russian . 
  they may speak it or not , it 's not obligatory in many regions . 
  and why do they have * the only * official language if they have 30 % of ethnical russians ? 
   name me a country where minority residents who do n't know native language ( the only official language ) can vote/can run for office/can work in public sector . 
  since we have a great national diversity , in some regions there are people who speak not the main official language . 
  overall there are [ 35 recognized official languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_russia ) here . 
  they of course can vote if they are citizens , and they can work in public sector on regional level . 
  ramzan kadyrov is a well-known example . 
  [ i have some bad news for swedes ... ] ( https://www.n2yo.com/whatsup.php ), 
  [ tom lehrer - who 's next ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fgmtaj4f_o ), 
  it 's literally poisonous for people not familiar with it from childhood . 
  very good plan . 
  you have already occupied small european countries with foreign military forces and they are begging to invade them with even more . 
  now it 's time to take remains of their independence and pass it to non-elected bureaucrats in bruxelles . 
  and then they will eliminate local enterprises to dissolve their people across richer countries . 
  it will be the effective end to their national cultures . 
  but where are traditional fur pants ? 
  because we have a proverb : `` woman off a cart - easier for mare '' . 
  only one person dressed more or less adequately . 
  yet with thin hat and cold boots . 
  and would you eat your fish and chips while drinking 5 o'clock tea ?
