  it is a stereotype and it is not fun . 
  since anniversary will take place on 30th december 2022 , it will be friday and an ordinary working day , so no , we wo n't be drunk . 
  what most people do not understand is that major russian cities are in 100 km from north korea and bombing nk would cause inevitable fallout on russian soil with possibility of full-blown nuclear retaliation . 
  when there were no computers , maps were done by hand and recalculation of coordinates into some exotic projection demanded hundreds of hours . 
  harrison made his maps by literally photographing a globe model and painting over the photograph . 
  it was made in 1943 by american cartographers . 
  borders and names are outdated of course , but point of view remains the same . 
  here is how europe as a geographical object is seen from russia . 
  projections are easy , generalization is very hard and can not be done properly with software . 
  i mean , when you see separate mountains on the map from post , they are not real in fact . 
  there are much more mountains in the very same place instead of any single one . 
  cartographer generalize them into single peaks , but software still can not do it properly . 
  for example , [ this guy works a lot on software generalization ] ( http://blog.imagico.de/introducing-geodata-section-on-services-imagico-de/ ) , but his maps are still far worse than handmade ones . 
  what about seamass ? 
  or even by seavolume ? 
  it 's an arbitrary criterion .

  why do you think about me so badly ? 
  i 've just presented a perspective . 
  no , perspective only matters . 
  do n't look at borders and outdated names . 
  this map was drawn by hand many years ago and nowadays we still do n't have software to make such things easily . 
  there are modern perspective maps , but they lack proper generalization . 
  i 'm not that cruel and just like maps . 
  most of france is n't in europe too considering your colonies , but it does n't matter . 
  op is from ukraine . 
  as i 've said elsewhere in this post , russia is not only its ruling elite , russia is its people . 
  in this sense he is surely a pro-russia protester . 
  just admit you lost . 
   the geneva convention is simply not applicable here if it does not apply , then this can not be called an `` occupation '' , crimea is just an our region now . 
   there are no legal grounds upon which russia can enforce any of its laws in crimea . 
  even if you consider it to be an occupied territory , geneva convention applies in such cases , read it . 
  like it or not , recognize it or not , our administrative law has full force in crimea . 
   exposing any corruption in russia  so , in other words , you have absolutely no mechanism for making collective decisions . 
  if you do n't understand how russia works from inside , well , it 's not my problem , it 's your problem . 
  if you know russian , read books by kordonsky , bessonova or shkaratan - maybe you 'll understand something . 
   name a single billionaire who opposes putin [ mikhail prohorov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_prokhorov#russian_politics ) for example . 
   name a single instance when a pro-russian protester faced similar repercussions [ sure , please ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg8kixsfgqo ) . 
  he stayed with sign `` we are the power here '' near court 's building , but was wise enough not to fight with police . 
  if he would do it near a court ? 
  totally the same . 
  courts are heavily guarded objects , police would react in seconds . 
   in the civilized world like in germany for example ? 
  in germany he would face up to three years in prison for planning and performing an action without permission . 
  or like in france ? 
  six months . 
  not 10 days and a small fine . 
  i thought icons are not popular amongst catholics ? 
  speaking not so bureaucratically as they do in russian laws , the state wish to establish standards on data exchange with private companies for cases of criminal investigations . 
  they specify software and hardware requirements in this law - minimal channel speeds , storage capacities and so on . 
   that 's not what i 'm reading though if you 'll open an article , there is a link to an official law project 's page , there is an option to read the original , current version of it . 
  it 's a law about providing data for purposes of criminal investigations . 
  ` mordva ' is n't a proper term , there are erzya and moksha , two different ethnicities . 
   we do not have any tanks [ you do ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@59.4169261,28.1401686,3a,75y,58.73h,86.87t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sqaojo8n1y4hx5rvugg4qqq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=ru ) . 
   i 'm disgusted that my country has to share the same past with yours there are no ifs in history , it 's just the fact . 
   there are no common traits between estonia and russia we have a lot in common and you know it . 
  maybe you hate it , it 's another story . 
   we for one do not seek war with anyone i 've heard that you have a tank !, 
  pretty old one , but still . 
   the whole world is against russia because of your actions in ukraine not the whole and not because of actions in ukraine , but because politicians from very specific countries do n't like such actions . 
  but since your country receives money from them , i do n't blame your people . 
   if you 're going to argue about something then you have to have the source to back your words up in case i 'll ask again , what kind of proofs would you you like to see ? 
  that amnesty international receives governmental money ? 
  please , [ their own report ] ( https://www.amnesty.org/download/documents/32000/fin400062011en.pdf ) , look for `` europeaid '' . 
  who cares ? 
   you love putin no , not at all . 
  in my opinion he is too soft and he generally failed to establish a truly effective power structure . 
   you probably consider him the second christ of holy russia or something we have a band '' \u0410\u043d\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u044c \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f \u0438 \u041c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0421\u044b\u0440\u0430 \u0417\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044f '' - they are satirical freaks and like to say exactly what are you saying . 
  but they are joking and you seems to be serious . 
   he does n't care about the people he has to care about next level of power hierarchy below him , not about everyone at once . 
  that 's how power systems like our work - each level has its part of responsibility . 
   you know exactly what i meant when i said that russia is putin for me it sounds like a stereotype about us , pretty popular in western countries . 
  i think the main reason behind such a belief is weakness of western expert society . 
   not enough to continue this debate that 's a pity because civilized discussions are rare on this sub and i really enjoy our exchange of opinions . 
   if this is n't sect lunatism it 's russia and we have a common past with your own country . 
  when darth vader said that he is luke 's father , luke was scared because he recognized traits of his own soul in vader . 
   you sound exactly like the propaganda that spins on kremlin channels . 
  honestly , i do n't look tv or read pro-kremlin sites , they do n't entertain me . 
   those pesky amerikansky trying to sabotage us and destroy our holy land like they are n't ? 
  they openly state that they are hostile , it is n't a secret . 
   what you 've got to say about kremlin paid people who provoke people on meetings against putin like navalny ? 
  i do n't like him . 
   also , source and proof about us funded organization ? 
  what kind of proofs would you like to read ? 
  usaid annual reports ? 
  they are available on their official site , along with lists of funded organizations . 
   russia is putin well , no . 
  i 'm not putin despite the fact that i am russian . 
   he is n't a president anymore all those titles does not matter . 
  in ussr it was called `` general secretary '' , in russian empire `` emperor '' , during tsardom it was called `` tsar '' and even earlier they were called `` grand dukes '' . 
  choice of title is an aesthetical thing . 
   why not just crown him tsar putin it would look very anachronistic , do n't you think so ? 
   putin does seem like a god in russia no , he is just the person who is currently in the top position in our society . 
  we have a pyramidal-like structure or power and pyramids have tops . 
   people are always pleading him to take action and help because complaints is an our main mechanism of self-regulation , not elections or things like that . 
  if you are unhappy in russia - complain . 
  if you know to who you should complain - then to him , if you do n't know - to the very top of the power pyramid and hope that it will react with its lower nodes . 
  we have different mechanism of making collective decisions - if there are too many complains about something on a particular level of power , reaction from upper level of powers follows . 
   so now he was used of course he was , it is n't just his private initiative . 
  there were special people around with cameras , police known that they are planning to perform , journalists were ready - it 's a show .
