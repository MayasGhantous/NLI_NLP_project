  same word is used for feathers on birds heads , like [ this one ] ( https://i04.fotocdn.net/s10/66/pin_m/72/2452506433.jpg ) have . 
  however , roosters have '' \u0433\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d\u044c '' , it 's seldom called '' \u0445\u043e\u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a '' . 
  you are not allies , you are vassals . 
  on [ echo ] ( http://echo.msk.ru/blog/movchan_a/1893220-echo/comments.html#comments ) moderation is light , switch to ` all comments ' . 
  there are by-invitation-only message boards with more open discussion attempts like [ this one ] ( https://divan.leprosorium.ru ) , but you 'll need to get an invitation somehow to read them . 
  for me work of r\u016bta vanagait\u0117 was very revealing . 
  [ i enjoyed this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myp2oxzcsvw ) , in russian . 
  it 's moderated , 
  [ another piece of recent bullying by his supporters ] ( https://www.znak.com/2017-07-13/ekonomist_andrey_movchan_ob_opasnosti_avtoritarizma_v_postputinskoy_rossii ) . 
  dive into comments , especially in movchan 's facebook . 
  this is exactly what happens . 
  if you really like to dive into this , here is a recent example : [ andrey movchan tries to talk with navalny 's supporters ] ( https://snob.ru/selected/entry/127020 ) about navalny 's political program . 
  movchan is a well-known russian economist . 
  do you really want to read those conversations ? 
  brains !, 
  his followers are quite aggressive and often are incapable to make dialogue . 
  since his political programs are basically `` for all good against all bad '' without much specifics , talking about specifics with them usually ends in an instantaneous outrage . 
  like : `` what will you do with arctic sea routes ? '', 
  - `` you are a putin 's shill , vatnick !, 
  '' , then foam emerges from their mouth . 
  you are in delusion about sources of his support . 
  new punishment laws never should act backwards in time . 
  if someone already voted and it was legal , making it illegal afterwards is not acceptable . 
  he ate real opposition and hide them within . 
  your citations describe measures to ban some person from using some messenger app by court 's decision . 
  i 'm not a fan of such measures , they already do it with `` extremist '' bank accounts , but it is still not censorship system like in prison or army mail . 
  properly naming things matter a lot . 
  which ones ? 
  as of opposition , i think that only prosvirnin is banned right now . 
  he was just too fat to not ban him . 
  censorship is when information is reviewed * before * it is delivered . 
  our phenomenon must have another name . 
  if you will look at [ the black list ] ( https://reestr.rublacklist.net/ ) , most of blocked resources are online gambling sites and pirated proprietary content . 
  also some isis propaganda and illegal drugstores . 
  to the contrary , almost all opposition resources are not in the black list . 
  the title is misleading . 
  they are not going to ban vpn and tor , they wish to fine companies for providing access to sites from a black list , which is not the same thing . 
  my great-grandfather was killed in action at wwii protecting those people . 
  in russia most families have somebody who died at wwii , it 's a very sensitive topic for us . 
   we do n't build memorials to fallen nazis and we do , together with germans . 
  as russian proverb says , `` dead people have no disgrace '' . 
   because memorials will not be demolished exactly that will happen . 
   their purpose - back under the former regime and now - is to be a political symbol . 
  most of them are symbols of `` here died over 600 000 men , their bones remain in this soil , remember them '' . 
  note that there was no decision to build kind of neutral memorials instead of them or to rework existing ones . 
  only to pillage . 
   we should at least be allowed to remove those symbols you are a sovereign nation and do n't need any allowance . 
  your people decided that demolishing them is the best choice for your nation . 
  not reworking them artistically , not relocating them , but destroying . 
   this kind of thinkig and understanding the world is just evil if you can not tolerate the fact that your nation failed to protect itself and other people died on your soil to save your ancestors from [ enslaving and extermination ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost ) , i can understand it . 
  you can call it evil , of course , you can ban things that remind you about the past of your country , but what 's done is done - you are alive and without them and their deaths you would n't even born . 
  and now your elected senate decides to pillage graves of those people . 
  if you elected them collectively , then it 's your collective responsibility as a nation . 
  and your decisions would be remembered . 
   what we should do your people already made a decision , now it 's your collective responsibility . 
   what you expect from us i can not say for all russians . 
  in my opinion graves should be respected . 
  we relocated a lot of soviet monuments to special places where people could enjoy them as art , like [ muzeon park in moscow ] ( https://www.google.ru/maps/@55.7362107,37.6090053,17.77z ) , but none of them are cenotaphs or gravestones - those are left where they stood . 
  i am serious - solid part of those memorials are [ cenotaphs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cenotaph ) , graves without bodies made because bodies can not be properly recovered . 
  you know very well that all warrior 's remains could not be found and buried properly , hence some of those memorials were installed as collective cenotaphs . 
  what your government is doing is exactly pillaging graves . 
  as a russian engineer , i could say that the main reason is in citizenship laws . 
  without citizenship nothing is really guaranteed , working visa could be terminated by a random reason . 
  european migration system is good for arabs and africans , who enter without documents and have low standards of life . 
  but it 's not that good for skilled people from more dveloped countries . 
  [ of course with a lot of explosives ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbgthvb_idq ) !, 
  well , now they will have everything they wanted : free food , housing and job . 
  we are a part of europe . 
  if you think that only citizens of eu members are europeans , you are wrong . 
  thank you for your work for us . 
   it has way too many 1st level regional divisions unsurprisingly since we are the largest country of europe . 
   but it may have to wait for phase ii of the reorg project so , a city ( and an administrative region ) with 12\u00a0400\u00a0000 inhabitants will not have its flair , i see . 
  please add flair for moscow . 
  according to [ iso 3166 ] ( https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:ru ) it is `` moskva ( russian federation ) '' , the flag is [ here ] ( http://dic.academic.ru/pictures/wiki/files/70/flag_of_moscow_%281994%29.svg ) . 
  without considering ppp it 's not useful . 
  [ to fight avatar , the last airbender ] ( http://explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/b/b7/elements.png ) !, 
  this is n't balaklava , it 's kapchick cape near noviy svet , in vicinity of sudak . 
  i 'm curious , are there mongoloid leopards ? 
  i do n't know why your compatriots do it and why all the rest eu is silent about it . 
  local nazi collaborationists [ committed genocide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/einsatzgruppen#killings_in_the_baltic_states ) with great enthusiasm . 
  why so ? 
  baltic states praise their nazis and the rest of eu is totally ok with that . 
  the problem is not in current migrants or human traffickers , the problem is in absence of solutions on how to solve problems inside eu relying on available resources . 
  as of egistration , rules depend on your visa type and other circumstances , often it 's a `` migration card '' , a [ little piece of paper with some info about you ] ( http://migrantmedia.ru/upload/medialibrary/fcd/skachat-obrazec-zapolneniya-migracionnoy-karty-2016-kartochka-migranta.jpg ) . 
  as of currency exchange , check rates [ here ] ( http://www.banki.ru/products/currency/cash/sankt-peterburg/#bank-rates ) . 
  of places to visit in moscow : 1 . 
  tsaritsyno palace and park 2 . 
  boulevard ring, 
  for questions about their future trips ? 
  i doubt so . 
   do you know if it 's easy to get a temporary/burner sim card for a foreigner in russia that 's easy , you 'll need to have your passport and registration document with you at mobile operator 's office . 
  also there are plenty of places with free wifi . 
  there is no such thing as anonymous prepaid sim cards in russia . 
   is the public transport and/or taxis expensive ? 
  bus , trolleybus , tram tickets - 40 roubles per trip ( 0.6 euros ) , metro - 45 roubles ( 0.7 euros ) per trip . 
  old-style taxi - from 30 roubles ( 0.45 euros ) per kilometer . 
  i do n't know is it expensive for you or not . 
  as of particular places of interest better ask on / r/russia , i 'm from moscow , locals from st. petersburg will provide you with better advice . 
  it depends on what would you like to see there . 
  st. petersburg is a large city , of course not as large as moscow , but still .
