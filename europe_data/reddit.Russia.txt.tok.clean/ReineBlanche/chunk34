  there were three revolutions , one in 1905 and two in 1917 . 
  the last one in 1917 was in fact a feudal counter-revolution which restored status quo . 
  and which was supported by people as you know . 
  the february revolution of 1917 was a tragedy that tried to establish in russia a western-style capitalist state with democratic institutions - it was the real tragedy since this way is incompatible with our culture . 
  the success of bolshevicks could be very well explained by the fact that they sensed the true basis of our culture which was supported by majority - an etatist social formation without true classes , in which there are many estates with their own privileges , services and needs ( instead of citizens , rights and duties ) . 
  if you really like to dive into this line or description of contemporary russia , i could recommend you a few books : \u0421\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u042e . \u0418. : '' [ \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 '' \u0430\u0437\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 '' \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 ] ( https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/6262385/ ) '' , part of it is available [ online ] ( https://scepsis.net/library/id_128.html ) .

  ilyin was an talented philosopher , but he was pretty far from understanding what is going on and died more then half a century ago in exile . 
  russia is neither a dictatorship , nor an oligarchy . 
  we are a very different state formation , close to what karl marx called '' [ asiatic mode of production ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asiatic_mode_of_production ) '' . 
  a classless society divided in estates . 
  i think it would n't be right to force those villagers to change their street names with some kind of federal law . 
  of course it could be done , but for them it would mean that they would need to change all their legal documents with their former address . 
  it 's your people 's problem , not mine . 
  currently , nothing new is named officially in honor of soviet leaders . 
  however , old things are often not renamed since it 's a part of our history . 
  your people 's choice of national heroes is somewhat symptomatic . 
  when it was abandoned , all their medals and honorable titles were abandoned also . 
  there is a difference between `` independent operational purpose division '' and `` independent orders of zhukov , lenin and october revolution red banner operational purpose division of the internal troops of the ministry of internal affairs of russia ` f. 
  they were upset with this fact and demanded to restore their title fully , despite the fact that all those titles do not have modern equivalents . 
  there is nothing new to name , they were militia regiment , then police regiment , now they are national guardsmen . 
  they were named in his honor long , long time ago and they were n't renamed since then . 
  i never heard that something was named in russia in his honor during my life . 
  national guard is new , dzerzhinsky 's name of this regiment is old . 
  it 's not the first street in ukraine which bears his name . 
  some ukrainians really think that such nazis are their national heroes . 
  buildings inside kremlin are under control of fso - federal guard service of the russian federation . 
  they do n't publish photographs . 
  a drone above kremlin ? 
  it 's nearly impossible , kremlin is protected with its own system of anti-air and radio-electronic defense . 
  for example , gps receivers near it will show false coordinates . 
  it means that drone must have some kind of inertial navigation system and to be able to work autonomously to do it . 
  kremlin is a fortress , you know , walls and towers . 
  for me `` from inside '' means inside the walls . 
  this palace on photo is not kremlin per se , it 's a building inside it . 
  [ photo from the inside ] ( http://www.verstov.info/uploads/posts/2017-05/1496079566_pikabu.jpg ) . 
  in all media there were warnings well before it happened , most people with mobile phones got sms with warnings from ministry of emergency situations . 
  civil defense sirens were off . 
  i 've witnessed a pigeon who struggled to fly in this wind and was smashed into a building . 
  so , he is a recidivist and we have an evidence captured on this video . 
  if minors are left alone and are asking for money , it is called `` begging '' . 
  especially if their parents told them to do so , and boy 's father already commented that he did it . 
  it is antisocial behavior . 
  little white pills . 
  daily . 
   how can nato best address the russian threat ? 
  the best way for them is not to forget to take their anti-paranoia pills regularly . 
  [ he is n't detained , it was n't fsb - it was sk , he is a witness in a case of major embezzlement of public funds ] ( https://meduza.io/news/2017/05/23/kirill-serebrennikov-vyshel-iz-sk-posle-doprosa ) . 
  potentially invaded . 
  because esperanto speakers do not plan to have a war with us and english speakers want it very much . 
  it 's a simple idea , no ? 
  i use russian as most russians and prefer to do so in the future . 
  surely english is much more imperialistic , but it is a necessary evil to know a language of potential aggressors . 
  it 's a bad idea because esperanto is mostly based on roman , german and latin roots and in this sense it is an imperialistic attempt to impose western-european speech to other nations . 
  no , thanks . 
  let people speak their national languages . 
  no , we do n't believe that russia is putin . 
  it 's an image created by propaganda , but it is n't true in real life . 
  we should really make salo a symbol of something . 
  hahahaha, 
  i imagine latvians with canes caning fish ... 
  in the era of cloud computing and regular updates 1c and parus wo n't work as intended as soon as isps will start to block them , if not earlier . 
  most of them were designed and built as temporary buildings . 
  it was much better than wooden barracks but they were not intended to be easily renovated . 
  renovation is possible , there are some nice successful examples , but it is too expensive and can not be properly done without relocation of inhabitants to a new place . 
  cheaper to demolish and to build something better . 
  property owners vote for or against demolition and relocation . 
  in many of those houses main owner is the state , inhabitants pay a symbolic `` social rent '' to live in their apartments . 
  if majority of owners voted for demolition , new house will be built in their district , when it will be ready , they will have one month for relocation . 
  according to the proposed law , they will got an apartment with the same room count , of same or bigger area , in their district . 
  it is a very good proposal for inhabitants of `` khruschevka '' houses and not that good for inhabitants of some brick houses from stalin 's era . 
  also the law initiative has some major flaws like lack of variants for relocation or an organization of voting procedure.most people are not totally against the initiative but want nuances to be elucidated before it will be approved . 
  since the exploiter class in your society is globalist capitalists , like your new president , tell me , how large is the portion of globalist capitalists in , to say , population of wallis and futuna ? 
  again , [ from wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wallis_and_futuna#economy ) :  the gdp of wallis and futuna in 2005 was 188 million us dollars at market exchange rates . 
  [ 3 ] the territory 's economy is limited to traditional subsistence agriculture , with about 80 % of the labor force earning its livelihood from agriculture ( coconuts and vegetables ) , livestock ( mostly pigs ) , and fishing . 
  about 4 % of the population is employed in government . 
  revenues come from french government subsidies , licensing of fishing rights to japan and south korea , import taxes , and remittances from expatriate workers in new caledonia , french polynesia and france . 
  industries include copra , handicrafts , fishing , and lumber . 
  in 1991 , bnp nouvelle-cal\u00e9donie , a subsidiary of bnp paribas , established a subsidiary , banque de wallis-et-futuna , which currently is the only bank in the territory . 
  two years earlier banque indosuez had closed the branch at mata-utu that it had opened in 1977 , leaving the territory without any bank . 
  obviously , by this definition they are a colony . 
  rough translation : colonialism ( ideology ) political , economical , ideological and cultural subjection of one countries , which are usually less developed economically , by exlploiter classes of another countries . 
  in some form it is peculiar to all exploiter formations : slavery , feudalism and capitalism . 
  it is a transference of class antagonism into international relations . 
  when talking about colonialism , it 's meaningless to rely on definitions completed by colonialists themselves . 
  colonialsm indeed has a clear definition and france is still a colonialist and imperialist country . 
  my view on contemporary chechnya ? 
  a nice region , totally happy being a part of my country , almost without federal forces - they are capable to care about themselves . 
  their local government is very effective with fighting local islamic terrorists . 
  what is truly ridiculous is that you judge people by their citizenship . 
  so european . 
  much tolerant . 
  very wise . 
  is it a proposal ? 
  m-m , whataboutism . 
  of course they are . 
  proper referendum can take place if french military and police forces would be withdrawn before an agitation period . 
  those people know very well what france [ could do with them in case if something will go wrong ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gambier_islands#effects_of_french_nuclear_testing_on_the_gambiers ) . 
  i 'll cite :  the gambiers served as a logistical staging base for french nuclear testing activity in mururoa , approximately 400 kilometers away . 
  during this time , the french military dragged a chain through some of the coral reef beds to cut a wider and deeper channel for deep draft vessels .
