  that 's why it 's sad that young generations of eu citizens think that nato would solve all their problems with foreign relations . 
  no , it 's a delusion , nato membership is their potential undoing . 
  it 's the reality , like it or not . 
  attacking russia is not the same thing as attacking another arab country , it will end with nuclear retaliation and possibly strikes would be directed not on military but on civil population . 
  this should be clear . 
  in some sense yes - because our model of administration is a mix of approaches from the golden horde , byzantine empire and xviii century europe . 
  i know it 's hard to understand , think of it in comparison with china - their model of administration is 2400 years old in its essence . 
  their mix of confucianism and legalism worked then and work now . 
  of course details are changing but i am speaking of general approaches . 
  not much are translated in english . 
  try reading those two books : michael voslensky ( 1984 ) . 
  [ nomenklatura : the soviet ruling class ] ( http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=d96f7ce0782e230a67155255d4f01f17 ) john f. haldon ( 1994 ) . 
  [ the state and the tributary mode of production ] ( http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=cde780d8b5d0146f6df93d66f92041a5 ) in russian i could recommend : works by \u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u043c\u0451\u043d\u043e\u0432 , particularly his '' \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 ( '' \u0430\u0437\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 '' ) \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 . 
  works by \u041e\u0432\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u0428\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043d are interesting too , those two articles could be a nice introduction into his thought : [ 1 ] ( http://jour.isras.ru/index.php/socjour/article/view/2379 ) , [ 2 ] ( http://jour.isras.ru/index.php/socjour/article/view/3032 ) - there are links to pdfs in bottoms of the pages . 
  weapons of mass destruction and means of their delivery are the only guarantee of independence and sovereignty of a state in the modern world . 
  examples of libya and iraq which cancelled their nuclear programs in exchange for diplomatic lies shows that they have made a huge mistake and payed for it a very expensive price . 
  is it an insane idea or just a couple of facts from recent years ? 
   to control the baltic sea like estonian aircraft carriers or latvian nuclear submarines ? 
   the current regime is mainly interested in stashing as much money as they can you do n't understand how russia works , confusing money stashing and two local phenomena : gaining of tributes and providing resources . 
  what looks as `` kleptocracy '' from outside is in fact our somewhat [ medieval form of administration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asiatic_mode_of_production ) . 
  to understand it , better think in terms of feudal and ancient asiatic states , not in terms of capitalistic states . 
  if you worry who will be the leader of russia after putin , i have an answer to you : without external intervention it will be another politician of his kind . 
  the one who will be able to fulfill the role of supreme moderator of interests of social groups / estates . 
  putin is not an autocrat , despite he might be looking so for external observers . 
  he makes final decisions , yes , but he is limited in his freedom of actions . 
  like russia started ukrainian coup d'etat , overthrown their legal government and invested in armed radical nationalists with neo-nazi ideology ? 
  no , it was n't russia . 
  it was someone else . 
  but we are the ones to blame . 
  range of '' [ kalibr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3m-54_klub ) '' missiles is 2600 kilometers , [ they could reach iceland ] ( http://www.freemaptools.com/radius-around-point.htm?clat=55.185141&amp;clng=21.209106&amp;r=2600&amp;lc=ffffff&amp;lw=1&amp;fc=00ff00&amp;mt=r&amp;fs=true ) and any aim in the baltic sea . 
  if you are watching news , terrorists in syria were attacked with them from caspian sea about a year ago , flying curved paths . 
  i think that present military escalation in sweden is mostly an interior business , not a response for a real threat . 
  to make an adequate response , your country should invest in its own nuclear program and developing modern means of delivery , not in conscription . 
  insurance plan for what , for a possible war with a nuclear state ? 
  i hope it never happens , but in hypothetical case of such war there will be no trenches , cannons and tanks , we have over 14 000 nukes - it 's way more than enough to burn most of the civil population in nuclear flames . 
  no one wins in such case . 
  let 's live peacefully and be friends despite our differences . 
  what do you worry about ? 
  i think that it does n't make sense to conquer sweden for our country . 
  for what ? 
  for your land ? 
  we have plenty of land . 
  for your people ? 
  they speak language that are far from ours , it would take decades to integrate them . 
  for natural resources ? 
  you do n't have much . 
  no , it does n't have sense . 
  they should 've care in 1709 when they 've lost the battle of poltava . 
  now it 's too late to get worried . 
  being good neighbors and searching compromises is far better than being paranoid and mobilize to fight . 
   what are they `` learning '' at these russian state universities they are learning how to be reptiloids under cover . 
  russia already prepared a new law that will allow to give russian citizenship by right of soil ( for all former russian empire and ussr territories ) , with a condition of being able to speak russian . 
  for us it is very good that they will force their people to choose . 
  more citizens , more territories . 
  well , their problem is that only about 60 % of citizens are ethnical ukrainians yet their officials are trying to establish mono-ethnical state . 
  why they have n't invited merkel to the celebration ? 
  as far as i understand their officials make this move after failing to protect private property : local radicals commited multiple attacks on russian banks in recent days . 
  ukrainians were n't allowing multiple citizenship in the past also . 
  although it may be not a wise move now to enforce this law since they 'll lost even more population because in times of civil war people could very well decide not to be citizens of their state . 
  he is a head of an independent state after all . 
  good or bad , who are your politicians to decide to displace him ? 
  and if you think that your country has such right , what stops other countries from displacing your leaders ? 
  in fact , there are two disputes - one for [ navassa island ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/navassa_island ) , with haiti , one for [ guantanamo bay ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guantanamo_bay_naval_base ) , with cuba . 
  others were just occupied without asking local population , as with samoa . 
  us itself has plenty of such areas as '' [ unincorporated territories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unincorporated_territories_of_the_united_states#list_of_unincorporated_territories ) '' . 
  ... add some anxilolytic drugs . 
  it must be detectable with modern scientific equipment . 
  with sturgeons , piglets on dishes , barrels of kvass and meter-high stacks of blini ... 
  haha . 
  oh yes , sometimes it 's a [ scary phenomenon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oezwf8nogc0 ) . 
   in what strange parallel reality were the nazis respectful of human rights in the reality where germans and other `` arian '' ethnicities were taught as humans and russians were claimed to be `` untermenschen '' . 
  urals are a tectonic boundary . 
  look at the [ tectonic map ] ( http://neotec.ginras.ru/neomaps/m075_union_1966_tectonics.jpg ) please . 
  in reality `` liberal world '' killed 24 millions of our people in the last war . 
  their leader was democratically elected , and they were very respectful for human rights , it just turned out that russians and other ethnicities are not humans in their point of view . 
  rhetorics change , people do n't . 
  look at yourself , you tell that a new world war is `` likely '' . 
  it 's not likely , it will be an end of european civilization if it happens . 
  instead of respecting that we are different from you and our right to live peacefully , you prefer to see an enemy in us . 
  this post is about a new investment fund opened after a period of tensions between russia and turkey , not about a plot of nuking your hometown . 
  do n't be hostile . 
  the border between europe and asia is drawn along tectonic plate boundaries after all . 
  by any geographical definition russia is a [ part of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boundaries_between_continents#europe_and_asia ) . 
  details vary , but not much . 
  we are on the same continent . 
  you can take a ticket on berlin-moscow train and just after 20 hours all the doubts would end . 
  i do n't know what `` liberal world '' is aside from it 's own propagandist constructs . 
  really . 
  you confuse europeans with supporters of eu . 
  russians and turks are europeans also , it 's a geographical category , not political or cultural . 
  put them into fmri machine , show some porn and watch for brain 's response . 
  that 's easy . 
  good news !, 
  i do n't know , do you have a map ? 
  if your politicians would made turkey hostile , the last thing needed for blockade of eu is control over suetz channel , because all other ways are already controlled by countries which are not friends with eu . 
  top russian writer ?!, 
  i even have n't heard about him until this post . 
  top russian writers are vladimir sorokin and victor pelevin . 
  if you do n't know , we are parts of unified state with them . 
  they are not alone ,
