  their civil war is a result of a political conflict between russia , eu and us . 
  the goals were simple : russia wanted a trading agreement and keeping our military bases . 
  us wanted new nato military bases in vicinity of russia , covered with ethnical russians as a live shield , as they like to do in other countries . 
  eu wanted some cheap manpower and to privatize their land and other natural resources . 
  eu and us funded ukrainian ngo 's and had deals with some of the local oligarchs to instigate coup d'etat . 
  russia responded with force , we were ready to use nukes in case of nato intervention into this conflict . 
  ukrainians got split and now kill each other because they are semi-independent country and rely on international aid , be it russian , eu or us money , they ca n't live on their own . 
  situation is simple . 
  probably ukraine 's politicians should think more not about the return of some territories but about saving what they still control . 
  i sometimes wonder about their news about incidents with their own armed `` volunteers '' . 
  their people are still ruled by oligarchs who control private armies . 
  maidan revolution tossed some figures , but have n't changed ruling style in general . 
  in case of new difficulties inside the country those oligarchs will probably choose again . 
  with no guarantees that their choice will be with the rest of the country . 
  cucumbers ?!, 
  pure poison , death happens usually about 70-80 years after first exposure to them . 
  especially cucumbers . 
  they are absolutely deadly , nobody survived after eating them . 
   an outspoken kremlin critic who fell into a coma two years after a suspected poisoning it must be a very special poison which acts only after two years . 
  because russians still can into cartoons . 
  i like the art style of lotte !, 
  we do . 
  and a lot of others . 
  most memorable cartoon from my childhood is `` barefoot gen '' :(, 
   eurozone needs its own finance minister how it would be called ? 
  it depends on what do you mean by the `` original '' . 
  for example , mcdonalds food . 
  in russia it is made using a lot ( 80 % ) of locally produced ingredients . 
  is it `` original '' or not ? 
  he is calling , not me . 
  i think that maori was the most powerful of polynesian people and european occupation is a tragedy , not something positive for you . 
  i thought you 'll link to [ this episode ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udxtvlg2vw0 ) . 
  ha-ha . 
  [ look who we have ] ( http://files.vm.ru/photo/vecherka/2012/11/doc67f3vftk1mwsrbp7k18_800_480.jpg ) !, 
  how so ? 
  violence now is [ understood as ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/violence ) :  `` the intentional use of physical force or power , threatened or actual , against oneself , another person , or against a group or community , which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury , death , psychological harm , maldevelopment , or deprivation '' pretty everything could result in psychological harm since it is a very abstract category . 
  including prohibition to eat sweets because of misbehavior . 
  the term `` violence '' is over-stretched and blurred . 
  hence violence could n't be properly prohibited . 
  in my opinion laws must be concrete and precise , without blurred phrases . 
  if it is prohibited to cause physical harm - ok , write it that way directly . 
  or to cause pain without causing physical harm - ok , include it too . 
  it 's uncomfortable to pretty everyone except for the state bureaucrats . 
  in russia there is a joke about very skinny persons as of '' [ strongmen from buchenwald ] ( http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/proverbs/27387/\u041a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u044b\u0448 ) '' , but it is considered rude . 
  better not use it in conversations since holocaust is a great tragedy . 
  both variants are true . 
  so , yes . 
  they could n't ban violence completely since there is no boundary of it . 
  first , the term was stretched as if prohibiting kids to eat cookies is something alike to hanging , drawing and quartering , which is a true violence and a good example of corporal punishment . 
  second , they banned all the violence . 
  does n't look like a well-planned move . 
  geographically - yes . 
  my dear connoisseur of russian culture and language !, 
  i live in moscow , i am local . 
  no , not even close to it in all the aspects . 
  it was established in [ 1946 ] ( http://www.cchp.ru/about/history/ ) . 
  it is known as the central kremlin 's hospital , '' \u0426\u041a\u0411 '' in russian . 
  it 's not only for the government officials . 
  they are just adding new buildings and equipment . 
  thank you for your answer . 
  i have a question . 
  a lot of news appearing here are a clear agenda pushing . 
  why do n't you ban them ? 
  how much propagandist articles are needed to include some site into a ban-list ? 
  still better than turning this sub into a never-ending flow of news articles . 
  your anthem got its official status in 1889 . 
  yep , the melody is older than both of the songs . 
  our own anthem is based on [ pachelbel 's canon ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/pachelbel%27s_canon ) for example . 
  `` europe '' is a geographical category . 
  kalmykia is located in europe . 
  it happens with anthems . 
  americans are often freaked out when they hear our [ folk song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smmbe0ilcig ) which is older than their anthem . 
  exactly , because wraps could be rewrapped with dry side to foot if necessary , it 's better than walking in cold wet socks till the end of a day . 
  i do n't know . 
  i see , they even marched near esthonian tank forces !, 
  i still use them , it 's more comfortable than wearing socks in some situations . 
  especially about dog 's fur ? 
  because they are made of dogs . 
  as of leather boots , [ mongolian boots ] ( http://3agon.ru/image/cache/catalog/obuv/sapogi-mongol-skie-muzhskie-dvustoronnyaya-sobaka-2-3agon-350x350_0.jpg ) with double fur and felt sole are ok for conquering siberia . 
  more like that they were going to frostbite their ears on the first day . 
   there is probably a very good explanation for everything that happened of course !, 
  swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and reflected the light from venus . 
  leather boots ? 
  thin hats ? 
   you will not grasp her with your mind  or cover with a common label ,  for russia is one of a kind --  believe in her , if you are able ... by fyodor tyutchev . 
  if an average iq is lower or higher than 100 it means only that test is maladapted , nothing more . 
  they already have experience with glass pyramids built in historical places . 
  why not . 
  \u041d\u0430\u0448\u0438 \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u044f\u0442 `` two years ago world 's leading toxicology laboratories failed to find any [ poisonous ] substances or their traces . 
  our specialists are n't seeing nothing like poison this time too '' - said chief physician of moscow hospital \u2116 79 denis protsenko . 
  however , two years ago an antidepressant was found in his blood which could cause the same effects as observed when mixed with other incompatible drug . 
  yet his doctors again have n't found any traces of an alleged poison . 
  after the fall of it 's sister-tower and conservation it got a status of cultural and historical heritage . 
  three railroad cisterns with sauerkraut are waiting nearby ? 
  this design demands less steel for the same size . 
  i know an engineer who constructed and built a [ small cellular transmitter tower ] ( http://static.ngs.ru/news/preview/42009439cc04938a673d303fe7ee107103e7388f_667.jpg ) - it is way more economical than more typical constructions . 
  edit . 
  another advantage : [ such constructions are self-lifting ] ( http://i.archi.ru/i/650/157627.jpg ) , no building crane needed to install them . 
  if the court thinks that nothing should be added then nothing should be added . 
  they could disagree with european court 's decision and they have a right to think so .
