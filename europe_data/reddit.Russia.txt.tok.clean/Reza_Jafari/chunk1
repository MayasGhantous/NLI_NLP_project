but they came for the hdp . 
  but they will come for the kurds, 
  is the hdp majority kurdish ? 
  poland 's horror -- gay communism . 
  but since it can not into space , it will not see this / s, 
  number 4 is gon na go on lurk, 
  yes , but the stuff stalin built ( although later ) looks kind of like this, 
  thanks !, 
  reminds me of stalinist architecture in moscow edit : there is actually a square in moscow ( gagarin square , more specifically ) , which looks similar to this, 
  ah , / u/c01dy ... he 's not a german . 
  he claims to be a russian residing in china . 
  idk why he is flaired as germany . 
  my condolences to sweden, 
  ... i think it is time to , as they say on the russian internet , steal a f #cking tractor and f #ck away from the f #cking russia, 
  in 2016 they explained it , they answered questions . 
  now ... well , now they basically give proof that they are literally shills, 
  propiska was abolished, 
  it was not removed tho . 
  it is still up [ here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/63zs1j/previously_secret_archive_documents_refute_the/ ), 
  it 's eerie how non-russians assume russians have some kind of collective hivemind , and that all of us are imperialistic vatniks . 
  could you please show me where i say you should be grateful for investments ? 
  yes , most russians will justify the occupation ( although they will probably dismiss the video as propaganda ) . 
  but not all russians think the same way . 
  please rant somewhere else . 
  what i am saying is that it was not really realistic that the soviets invested in the baltics a lot , it went against soviet philosophy . 
  this is it . 
  thanks , captain obvious, 
  at least before they said * why * they ban you, 
  i always wanted to go to lviv , but the only place in ukraine i went to so far was kiev . 
  and ukraine is kind of unstable now , so the situation in the east might soon change to a full civil war , so now i try to avoid ukraine, 
   a domestic one it 's basically a fancy word for an id , though . 
  you do not have to , like , get a visa to move around your country as many might believe . 
  true . 
  when i was in minsk i saw very few signs in belarussian . 
   you 're still in line in front of turkey . 
  at times i feel that russia has a better chance of joining the eu by 2050 than turkey, 
  then is it possible for russia to invade itself to travel to the eu ? 
   honey pepper vodka fyi : ukrainians do not call it vodka , they call it horilka . 
  and it tastes differently from vodka, 
  russia 's motto ( unofficial ) ( also the national ideology ) -- \u0410 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u0443\u0439 !, 
  * ) , meaning something between `` fuck that ! '', 
  and `` we do n't give a fuck ! '', 
  ( sorry ladies ), 
  i think it is one of the two factors , the other one being a poorly managed transition to a market economy, 
  well , i 've been criticising the government at all levels ever since yeltsin came to power , and the only unpleasant contact i had with authorities was a parking fine i paid outside of russia, 
  well , nigeria also has a large shadow economy too, 
  believe me , there is enough vata in russia to insulate all the houses in the world, 
  but if you earn less than a certain amount of money you are considered poor . 
  innit ? 
  including the government 's puppets ? 
  i talk sh $ t about russia in public in russia and say many of russia 's problems are putin 's fault . 
  am i an opposition leader ? 
  ah , the good old reddit [ putin-a-roo ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/6367fp/whats_the_weirdestmost_incredible_thing_youve/dfsabvz/?context=10000 ), 
  well , ukraine 's gni per capita is much lower than that of namibia or angola , and slightly lower that that of nigeria , so ... 
  not specifically genocide , but it was done to weaken the russian people and make stalinist rule over russia easier, 
  are n't man-made famines genocide ? 
  you underestimate the amount of vata in russia . 
   kievan rus was the huge eastern slavic empire . 
  actually idk if it was identifiable as ukrainian, 
  used to have both strong industry and strong agriculture , and was considered the most likely post-soviet state to succeed . 
  not sure about the economy now , but the war is dragging them down, 
   huge it sector , rapidly growing . 
  can you recommend some good ukrainian websites or apps ? 
  my condolences to st. petersburg and all those killed and injured and their families !, 
  imo russia better stay out of nato . 
  i would not like my countrymen fighting in some war in the back of beyond for another country 's elite, 
  i love europe !, 
  i wish russia sorted its internal crap out and joined the eu , together we will be invincible !, 
  most russians have no idea reddit exists, 
  actually whiskey is relatively popular in russia -- although more of an intelligentsia drink it is, 
  wtf did i just read, 
  actually / r/russia 's posters are mostly the russian equivalent of people from / r/the _ donald ( forgive me for mentioning this blasphemous sub ) . 
  we just have been cursed with a higher percentage of these people, 
  the saddest part is that this opinion is very common , especially outside of moscow, 
  it 's just one aspect of the country 's new course ( to shit ), 
  eastasia , not eurasia !, 
  thoughtcriminal !, 
  imo jankovic , jeremic and radulovic must unite . 
  i see vucic as a kind of less advanced version of putin . 
  so , my slavic brothers , since we have fallen to populism , i hope at least you will fare better, 
  so doublethink ? 
  live in russia , and it will . 
  people can say anything just to remain in power, 
  i was joking . 
  but for a russian to go off work in winter to protest is too much, 
  too cold, 
  many russians go there to learn english, 
  i see what you might mean . 
  however , one of my friends told me he considered going , but caught a cold and changed his mind, 
  right now is my second ban . 
  first one does not count though -- i called a guy on there a vatnik . 
  second time was without even justification . 
  but where exactly did you see it ? 
  have you by chance been or / r/russia ? 
  i have reasons to suspect that most of them are shills -- there are not enough russians who are so putinophile as they are , but still both know about reddit and speak english to a reasonable level . 
   one interesting detail that comes to mind is that we are n't allowed to `` distribute homosexual propaganda '' to minors and as well to adults is it so in other regions ? 
  if you lived in russia , you would ask rather `` why are they not protesting ? '', 
  in russia incest is actually legal ( not cousin marriage ) . 
  however , we still have almost no incest, 
  still , such a regime is bound to instil pathological fear of the word `` socialism '',
