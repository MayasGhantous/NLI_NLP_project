  true patriotism is not yelling patriotic songs or jerking off to the flag , but seeing your country 's good and bad sides , and helping increase the good things in it and remove the bad things . 
  in which case i have patriotic beliefs , but my procrastination and me being located on the other end of the world prevent me from bringing about real change . 
  country -- i often say that although the fact that russians in k\u00f6nigsberg ( aka kaliningrad ) are not very different from russians in vladivostok might produce the impression that russians are all the same , it is not like that . 
  if in italy the divide is between north and south , and in ukraine between east and west , in russia such a divide lies along apartment walls . 
  russians can be very different depending on social background . 
  therefore , i 'd like to divide russians into three classes , depending on patriotism : 1 . 
  intelligentsia -- including me . 
  most of them have my definition of patriotism , however their commitment to patriotism varies -- from being limited to political discussions among friends on the kitchen to actually going to unsanctioned rallies ( which i do n't have the guts for ) . 
  in russia this term is used for those who are very patriotic ( like the folks at / r/russia ) . 
  originally it was derogatory , but many vatniks have grown to become proud of this name . 
  these guys are fiercely nationalistic , support putin , hate the west , lgbt people , and liberals , and believe all those who think differently to be traitors . 
  usually are religious to the point of rescinding the basic tenet of all religions ( do n't be an asshole ) , although some who are particularly stalinophile can be atheists . 
  ordinary russians do n't care , apart from special occasions like victory day ( russia 's * de facto * national day ) when they become super patriotic . 
  then they get drunk to the sound of the national anthem , and several hours later patriotism is replaced by hangover , and they stop caring until next victory day ( more specifically , until next middle of april , when preparations for victory day start ), 
  nah , i do n't like pop music russia is not broadcasting it though . 
  not that it concerns me , it 's just an indicator of how much the country has gone to shit . 
  also i am not in russia now , so it does not apply to me ( although china probably does not broadcast it either ), 
  full equality for everything , but step by step and according to a secret programme scheduling full equality for , say , 2050 , with anti-discrimination laws at some point between now and 2020 and marriage in 2030 . 
  if this gets leaked , the leader proposing this might well get raped by his own bodyguards ( unlikely , but still possible ), 
  moscow -- very few people know who sikhs are, 
  probably yes . 
  but not for everything, 
  most of them probably speak russian , unless they live in some very remote area where they do not even know what russia is, 
  also in what universe is hong kong liberal ? 
  those in power in hk are neocon puppets of the beijing government, 
  how about no ? 
  good question . 
  on one hand , the russian language is almost entirely the same from kaliningrad to vladivostok , except for not very strong accents and locally used words . 
  however , there are lots of ethnic minority languages , most of which have slightly less than nothing in common with russian grammatically . 
  still , they are languages in their own right , and not dialects , and they are only 19 % of the total population of the country, 
   dicky in russian , \u0445\u0443\u0451\u0432\u043e ( khuyovo ) , literally meaning `` dicky '' , means `` shitty '', 
  literally means `` steep '' ( as of a hill ), 
  did not read the text box , just the title, 
   also bagged milk i do n't think it 's a thing anymore even in russia, 
  it was common in the soviet era . 
  it 's not a thing even in russia anymore, 
  the guy giving the girl flowers on a date, 
  what would happen if someone violated this law ? 
   it 's not much , about 4.5 million euros if you say it 's not much , you got ta be really rich, 
  chechnya -- it 's basically its own country . 
  kadyrov even has a personal army . 
  i actually was using `` czechia '' before finding out it 's called the czech republic , and naturally the switch to czechia seems good however , i wonder why `` czechia '' and not `` chesko '', 
  standard russian is spoken by russians in the whole country , although some regions have accents and there are some `` local '' words here and there : for example , shawarma -- a kind of doner kebab/gyro which is a popular street food in russia -- is called * shaurma * in most of the country , * shaverma * is st. petersburg and some other places , * shavarma * in tver , which is roughly halfway between moscow at spb , * dyoner * in some places in siberia , and * giro * in the north caucasus . 
  itt : the russians are the most sober, 
  i first tried alcohol at my 18th birthday -- 18 is the drinking age , and we celebrated by a bottle of wine made in the year i was born in kept specially for the occasion . 
  in fact , i hardly even drink, 
  iphones are usually for hipsters ( like me ) . 
  everyone else uses android, 
  i guss it 's probably ireland, 
  south . 
  there are lots or rednecks all over the country , but those living near the ukrainian border ( in kuban ) , also called kubaniods , are the more hardcore . 
   its turnout dropped below 60 % . 
  in russia 's last election , turnout was 48 % . 
  not all is that bad !, 
  problem is , not that many people in russia can even tell the difference between the nordic model and the social market economic model , so i am not sure, 
  same for my family -- although my parents were not businessmen , both of them were lawyers hired by a big american company which set up in russia at that time, 
  what country ? 
  in russia we use the term `` jewish masonic reptiloids '', 
  in russia they were bad -- the government attempted a transition from a planned economy to hardcore free market , and it did not go that well , and we only got back to 1980s levels of quality of life in 2010 . 
  in my personal opinion , russia should instead have adopted the nordic model as a target . 
   provincials hate muscovites , but muscovites do n't care . 
  they only consider petersburgers to be worthy of derision . 
  i had the impression that many muscovites sometimes do not see * zamkadysh * people ( people from outside moscow/spb ) as people, 
   also their beer looks like piss . 
  you have not seen chinese beer -- in addition to looking like piss , it smells like piss, 
  you can get them in china , although they are not as good as portuguese ones, 
  you can buy baguettes in shanghai of a quality close to the french ones , but it 's from one of those super-expensive hipster places . 
  also , nothing is quite like the feel of a small french neighbourhood bakery, 
  when i am in china , i definitely miss accessing google . 
  or going on foreign websites at a speed which is not absurdly low, 
  not very different from america . 
  sometimes the two work/study together ( although office relationships are usually frowned upon ) , sometimes the two are friends and then realise they have feelings for each other . 
  not sure if introductions by friends are common , but talking to strangers with the ultimate objective being flirting is not usually ok outside parties or bars . 
  night clubs can be a way of getting a girlfriend , but so far i have had the impression that a girl/guy at a bar and nightclub would be more often than not a one-night stand ( especially the second one ), 
  not sure about this 2 . 
  university in russia is really cheap , and it 's very easy to get a scholarship, 
   fleur apparently the harry potter wave is not quite over yet in the netherlands ... 
  what about yushchenko ? 
  ( this was a reference to the orange revolution ), 
  for most russians , food trucks would be mostly about shawarma prepared without respecting any sanitary conditions, 
  it 's usually just an excuse to get drunk . 
  communists ( mostly old people ) demonstrate , no one cares, 
  deutsche welle is the first thing that comes to mind, 
   ramen only the real ramen , not instant ramen . 
  i mean , real and instant ramen are totally different, 
  vietnamese cold noodles or japanese curry pork cutlets . 
  not sure which exactly but the best cuisine is hands down korean cuisine edit : now that i think of it , jeyuk bokkeum ( \uc81c\uc721\ubcf6\uc74c ) -- a korean dish made of stir-fried pork in a spicy sauce -- is the best . 
  the . 
  whole . 
  world !, 
  the eternal dilemma of russian intelliegentsia -- either you steal a fucking tractor , emigrate and work as a taxi driver in paris , or you stay in the fucking russia and continue working on your relatively high-paid job seems that i was lucky to get such a job ( although i had to settle for china ) note : in paragraph 1 , i referenced the russian internet meme '' \u041f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0451\u043d\u043e\u043a \u041f\u0451\u0442\u0440 \u0441\u044a\u0451\u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u0437 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0420\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0438 , \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0438\u0432 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 '' ( closest translation -- pyotr the pig gets the fuck out of the fucking russia by stealing a shitty tractor ) . 
  thanks to it , pyotr the pig became a symbol of russian expatriates , while the phrase '' \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 '' ( time to steal a fucking tractor ) basically means `` time to emigrate '', 
  only from an economical point of view -- northern siberia is wealthier than european russia ( outside moscow and st. petersburg ) because of oil , while southern siberia is poorer than european russia . 
  the culture , however , is the same pretty much everywhere apart from ethnic minority areas, 
  depends on the part of the culture . 
  note : people from the north caucasus , whose culture is hugely different from the rest of russia and closer to that of saudi arabia , are also considered immigrants if they live in areas outside the caucasus if they practice honor killings i would probably call the police . 
  if they refuse point blank to learn russian i would be quite annoyed if they decide to move to russia permanently . 
  if they refuse to celebrate new year , i could n't care less, 
  `` party of scoundrels and thieves '' -- the nickname opposition members use for the united russa, 
   and when it comes to russia , most people do n't really care .
