  apart from enver hoxha and the kosovo/greater albania business , albania means something special for the russian internet ( aka the runet ) . 
  in olbanian ( a warped form or `` albanian '' ) , people deliberately make spelling mistakes so that words are written exactly as they are pronounced it got the name like this : a russian livejournal user made a post about how he got really drunk . 
  an american came by and said he id not understand this , and asked for a translation . 
  this was the answer : `` this is albanian , i am only guessing what the fuck they are talking about . 
  something about how they were using new drugs or smthin '' . 
  the exchange after this was / r/shitamericanssay-worthy stuff :  mypointofview ( some lj user ) : why do you think this text was written for you ? 
   scottisht928 ( the american ) : because ? 
  it 's livejournal . 
  an american website . 
  not an albanian ; ( # * ! @ ( ) !, 
  site . 
  plus , being an american means that the rest of the world should have to cater to me . 
  but that 's just mypointofview . 
  after that , he got lj private messages , emails , and even texts from russians telling him to `` learn albanian '' . 
  he was told to stop it by saying `` fuck off , bitches , i learned albanian '' , which he did , then deleted his lj . 
  it is their right to move towards europe , but it does not seem like they are willing to go further along the european path . 
  russian is a slavic language . 
  the vast majority of slavic-language speakers ( if we do not count russian , since it flaws the results ) live in europe . 
  turkish , however , is turkic , and most turkic-language speakers ( apart from turkish speakers ) live in asia . 
  you made europe what it is . 
  russia was one of those who were made 2 . 
  geography : 80 % of our population lives in the european part of russia 3 . 
  culture : hong kong is not really a good comparison , i 'd say israel would be closer 4 . 
  our way of life and the priorities of the people are not too far from those of , say , poland ( on most issues ) . 
  and in our case , western european influences are much stronger than in turkey . 
  do you still want to go on ? 
  i can go on for real long , while you are bound to run out of arguments soon, 
  well , they did the croatian idiom . 
  this one is close, 
  literally means `` i 'm not me , and the cow is not mine '', 
  not much trickles down, 
  history ? 
  russia was part of european history ever since it appeared as a country geography ? 
  europe is a geographical region culture ? 
  our culture is mostly western-influenced with a lot of native stuff mixed in . 
  your culture combines european and middle eastern influences , therefore culturally you are not more european than hong kong . 
  also , how exactly is your way of life similar to that of most europeans ? 
  the very idea that turkey is european only appeared thanks to atat\u00fcrk . 
  before that , turkey was undoubtedly middle eastern in all but geography . 
  and judging by erdogan , turkish europeanness lasted for a relatively short time only . 
  akp is taking turkey on the road to becoming a regular middle eastern country like iran or lebanon . 
  edit : language ? 
  slavic languages are european , and russian is also quite heavily influenced by european languages like french or german , while you have a rather high amount of arabic loanwords for a european language, 
  based on history , geography , culture and language . 
   we wo n't break more than a 2000 years old definition/tradition , will we ? 
  yes we will, 
  russia is way more european than turkey, 
  in saudi arabia it will be 100 % . 
  even 146 % maybe, 
  more like : __ | | -- -- = = = = = = = = = = = = =d | | __, 
  in this case , maybe a petrozavodsk-helsinki pipeline ? 
  alcohol is cheaper in karelia . 
  although russia might send poisoned alkoholi to weaken and annex finland / s, 
  wait ... so syria has a war and hundreds of people leaving the country daily and still manages to have population growth ? 
  what is that sorcery ? 
  not really -- states are not countries . 
  i wo n't get mad if you mix up tuva and yakutia, 
  jaak-kristjan j\u00f5eorg is probably the most handsome passport specimen guy i have ever seen, 
  it belongs in / r/askeurope but i would say it 's ivan ivanovich ivanov, 
  and russians too, 
  rather the opposite , actually, 
  did they count serbian , croatian and bosnian as separate languages for croatia ? 
  that 's also not true . 
  russia 's heading towards mobutu 's zaire, 
  they looked awesome when they were new, 
  is it novi beograd ? 
  can france simply revoke the visa ? 
  a couple of them actually . 
  / r/politota and / r/liberta , namely, 
   i found out i could n't get a visa for russia except in the uk why not ? 
  why did you not visit moscow or minsk , but visited kiev and ankara ? 
  problem is , they are two different nations . 
  they are * de facto * separate countries , let it be so * de jure * !, 
  they must also be given up, 
  the world should pressure china to give up its claims over taiwan, 
  imo the international community should try establishing relations with both , forcing china to dumb the stupid one-china policy, 
  it 's / r/russia . 
  trying to be post such things there is like posting an article about human rights in north korea in / r/pyongyang ( only there submissions are restricted ) . 
  or saying an opinion different from that of the admins in / r/the _ donald, 
  it 's not about the country though , it 's about the language, 
  welcome to the club !, 
  seriously , there should be some kind of / r/bannedfromrrussia , where normal people who got banned from ~ ~ / r/olgino ~ ~ / r/russia can talk about the real russia, 
   which ivan the terrible burned to the ground i think it was ivan iii who did that, 
  / r/latvianjokes-style joke about the situation : wars happened with kapitalist lithuania that steal all pot\u0101ts . 
  politb\u016bros say every latvjia mans must go to wars for die for latvija in battle , but all die before reashing battlefields from maln\u016brish , and lithuania konquer latvija , look for pot\u0101ts everyvhere but kan not find bekause there is no pot\u0101ts in latvija , bulldoze all y\u016brts and rape all dottirs . 
  sush iz laif in latvija ( sorry , just in case ), 
  i love this song !, 
  to be fair , the usta\u0161e used to be quite popular in croatia in the 1990s , so ten years ago it would not have been such an insult slovenia should have been with the slovak flag though, 
  tagil rulit !, 
  if only ... * sigh *, 
  actually russia now is much less oppressive than in the soviet era . 
  you can listen to whatever music you want , say what you want ( not in the press , but it 's at least something ) , and although the lgbt rights situation in russia is dismal you wo n't go to prison for just having gay sex as you would in the soviet union . 
  ( all this only counts for russia outside of chechnya ), 
  i am concerned that serbs will get mistreated, 
  if i were in moscow , i would be among them . 
  these buildings should be replaced by something residential and these people should get apartments in there of a size comparable to the flats where they lived before, 
  they are actually more like the muslim brotherhood, 
  if only we could be like that, 
  i am talking about navalny , though . 
  but no journalist in russia would do that,
