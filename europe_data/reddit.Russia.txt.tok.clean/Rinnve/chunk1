sorry , but i did n't say `` lying all the time '' , those are your words . 
  `` falsifying information all the time '' . 
  that 's a really big , game-changing difference . 
   are you saying is that there is no proboganda by russian media first , what is so freaking hard in the word `` examples '' to understand ? 
  second , you stated that `` russian television here is just falsifying information all the time '' . 
  please provide examples that prove ** your ** point . 
  and no , the article you 've linked does n't have any examples that prove it . 
  nor does that youtube video . 
  what exactly was * falsified * in it ? 
  as for exaggeration to some point and bias , well , if you ca n't find just the same in the western media , i have bad news for you . 
  it would be very nice to see some ** examples ** backing the statement about russian tv `` lying all the time '' . 
   exclusive economic zone [ an exclusive economic zone ( eez ) is a sea zone prescribed by the united nations convention on the law of the sea ** over which a state has special rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources , ** including energy production from water and wind.the difference between the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone is that the first confers full sovereignty over the waters , whereas the second is merely a `` sovereign right '' which refers to the coastal state 's rights below the surface of the sea . 
  ** the surface waters , as can be seen in the map , are international waters . 
  ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exclusive_economic_zone ), 
  parts of the region where infrastructure is still functioning , to be more precise . 
   when i read russian news compared to `` western '' or see a russian politics or news show i feel like i am living on a different planet . 
  care to provide an example or two ? 
  `` just '' ? 
  crimean referendum of 2014 was * third * after dissolution of ussr . 
  ukraine ( and the west ) just ignored two others . 
  well , not exactly ignored , ~ ~ neo-nazis ~ ~ ultranazionalists did this `` train of friendship '' thing , sending hundreds of thugs to remind crimeans who they belong to . 
  they warned to do the same , only there were polite green men this time . 
  ` aid ' ? 
  let me guess , all those electric generators brought in previous convoys should make electricity out of thin air ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/racism `` racism and racial discrimination are often used to describe discrimination on an ethnic or cultural basis , independent of whether these differences are described as racial . 
  according to the united nations convention , there is no distinction between the terms racial discrimination and ethnic discrimination [ ... ] '', 
   obviously everyone should abide by the laws of the country and be held responsible if he breaches them . 
  it can be kind of hard to keep a criminal held responsible for crime when he has like a hundred of buddies living by medieval clan laws which are very happy to punish anybody , cops included . 
  the fact that many cops in russia are still quite corrupt does n't helps at all . 
  and the saddest thing is that caucasians guys who become victims of hate crimes have nothing to do with their criminal ... fellows . 
  ( not sure this is the proper word ; what i meant is '' \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044f\u043a\u0438 '' , people who were born in same region ) . 
   this was a signed legal treaty that was also ratified by parliaments of both countries in 2010 and , of course , nothing could be done about derailing this ` legal treaty ' , whatever political leverage applied , right ? 
   in reality ukraineans are people not much different from russians . 
  * russians * are not much different from russians . 
  did n't stop us from fighting each other back then . 
  whites , reds , all those things . 
  it is not about who is different from or similar to , it 's about the ideas . 
  and it seems to me that many ukrainians got all the right ideas to put them straight against the russians . 
  may be i 'm mistaken and may be i 'm just seeing things , but this is what i see . 
  i 'm sorry , but that 's very far from idolizing a country leader . 
  no you 're not . 
  but some works that could seem as a tongue-in-cheek for you are n't that . 
  some of the authors here are for real , that 's the scary part . 
   `` not actually hungry '' i lolled irl and spilled a bottle of beer . 
  please , please forgive me . 
  eh , current russia is still quite far from being a dictatorship . 
  i 've lived in ussr , so believe me , i can distinguish one . 
   bulgakov very well , you 're completely forgiven . 
  many did . 
  you do n't know about them , though , because subtle things/events/performances are not news-worthy . 
  if you 're interested , you can google , for example , '' \u041e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442\u044b \u0432 \u0437\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430 '' by oleg divov . 
  even the cover picture is loaded with layers of meanings . 
  it is labeled as '' \u0412\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b '' or something like that ( `` political caricature exhibition '' ) . 
  caricature is n't usually considered as something serious in russian culture , so i think most people went there for a healthy dose of giggles . 
  i do n't think anybody in their right mind consider * that * as a serious art . 
  i very much hope so . 
  except ( 1 ) russia does n't ( except for some freaks ) , and ( 2 ) most monarchies do n't really idolize their monarchs . 
  eh , people buy all kinds of shit , it means nothing , really . 
  actually , i can totally imagine some pieces of this `` art '' to became quite expensive in the future , after current events become history . 
  it is . 
  comic sans has cyrillic letters too , but in this font some letters ( for example , \u041b ) are drawn a bit differently . 
  eh , there are different forms of art , some are more cringeworthy than others . 
  it is actually good that those ... things are exposed . 
  this shows that there is still potential for another cult of personality in russia , that not everybody learned their history lessons good enough . 
  edit : i accidentally a letter . 
   the other point to keep in mind is that the iraq war was a big slap in the face of russia . 
  it was the first time in many years that america practiced widespread disregard for the un and invaded a country i 'm sorry , but u wat m8 ? 
  america ` practiced widespread disregard for the un and invaded a country ' , and it 's a big slap in the face of * russia * , of all things ? 
  what about your precious ` international laws ' ? 
   `` russia in sevastopol '' was nothing more than a lease for black sea fleet of russia up to 2045 and noone ever mentioned anything about breaking a deal . 
  http://censor.net.ua/news/14176/yatsenyuk_poobeschal_chto_flot_rf_ ostanetsya_v_krymu_do_2017_goda http://focus.ua/country/61126/ http://www.unian.net/politics/260754-yatsenyuka-menshe-vsego-bespokoit-buduschee-chf-rf.html there was later an agreement between yanukovich and medvedev about prolongation of the lease for another 25 years after 2017 , called the kharkiv pact , but suddenly yanukovich is ousted and look who 's back to power !, 
   in the end , the military interference by russia meant that noone can internationally recognize those elections there was no military interference by russia in the nineties . 
  look how good it went , how internationally recognized became those referendums and how punished ukraine was for acting unlawfully . 
   any cooperation between culturally close neighbours will be impossible it was quite clear well before crimea , thanks to thousands of ukrainians chanting ` hang the moskals ' and ` knife the moskals ' . 
   the only people i see benefit from the mess are those who long for soviet glory to return . 
  you must be blind then . 
  rape . 
   schools white-wash lenin 's and stalin 's crimes i do n't know about lithuanian schools , but they do n't white-wash `` stalin 's '' ( soviet , actually ) crimes in russian schools . 
  nope , this answer is incorrect . 
  they were in the international airspace . 
  doing what , exactly ? 
  by answering my question correctly , you 'll answer your own question too . 
   russian military doctrine legitimatises nuclear strikes to decrease tension , to scare countries into appeasement . 
  it 's their basic strategy . 
  this is complete and utter bullshit . 
  nuclear de-escalation in russian military doctrine is clearly defined for circumstances when russian army is * attacked * by overwhelming conventional military force . 
   in free world , you do not vote surrounded by foreign tanks and armed military personel who expect you to select for their favor . 
  i have yet to see any photos or videos that show both voting crimeans and armed men . 
  that 's because ` polite green men ' where there not to , ah , suggest correct voting ( both options were acceptable for russia , with second crimea would keep enough autonomy to prevent ukraine and its new ` friends ' from pushing russia out of sevastopol ) . 
  they were there to prevent mainland ukraine from interfering . 
  they aimed outside , not inside . 
  at the gunpoint ? 
  what does that mean ? 
  nobody forced crimeans to choose the first option ( join russia ) . 
  anyways , the west did n't cared when mainland ukraine ignored crimean referendums in the nineties and landgrabbed sevastopol which never belonged to ukraine and , being a city of state importance in the ussr , answered directly to moscow . 
  i do n't see why the west should care today . 
  full autonomy ( crimea as a separate state ) is unrealistic . 
  `` status quo '' was enforced by mainland ukraine after they thought back then in the nineties that crimea has too much autonomy . 
  without russian help , mainland ukraine would never have allowed any referendum . 
  look like mongols ?
