  except they do . 
  there are * dozens * of reports on bombed city blocks when there were no any separatists nearby . 
  lisichansk oil refinery [ was attacked recently ] ( http://itar-tass.com/ekonomika/1328434 ) for completely unknown reason , that 's one place were separatists have absolutely no reason to be . 
   terrorists commanders are chechen wars veterans . 
  please share the source . 
   and who said something else ? 
  [ in supporting putin now they are guilty of each and every murder . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2b5rj2/there_is_no_sign_of_shock_or_shame_in_russia_anne/cj2818r ) in this very thread . 
   usa so how those drone strikes are going , mate ? 
  there are some countries in the world that could lecture russia about having good values . 
  usa is not one of them . 
  brace yourself for downvotes , mate . 
  that 's whataboutism and you know it . 
  let me give you an example . 
  imagine civilian building . 
  typical soviet-build nine-story concrete monster with two hundred apartments and about half a thousand civilians living here . 
  police gets info that may be there is a meth lab in one of those apartments . 
  by your logic , police can just bomb the hell out of this building killing all civilians in the process , and it would be drug makers responsible for that because they did n't move out of this building . 
  let me clarify . 
  there are hundreds of destroyed civilian buildings with several dozens ( if not hundreds ) civilians dead . 
  is there one example that says , basically , ` this building got destroyed and those civilians were killed because armed terrorists hid there ' ? 
   there was an article not long ago posted in here about rebels setting up their artillery in church courtyard . 
  a link would be nice . 
  anyways , that 's not an answer to my question . 
  let me clarify . 
  there are hundreds of destroyed civilian buildings with several dozens ( if not hundreds ) civilians dead . 
  is there one example that says , basically , ` this building got destroyed and those civilians were killed because armed terrorists hid there ' ? 
   the civilian casualties are unfortunately inevitable as the terrorists wo n't stop using the advantage of settlements as human shields on their own . 
  i wonder , is there one example of east ukrainian separatists actually using civilians as a human shield ? 
  i mean , like ` this civilian building was destroyed because there were separatists in there ' . 
   have you even read it ? 
  actually , i did . 
   it contains an extremely vague definition of the actual offense bullshit . 
  that 's quite specific . 
  so no , you ca n't just jail any gay for being gay . 
  but you can be fined even if you are not gay . 
  thing is , this law has nothing to do with * being * gay - quite contrary to lies spread by nyt . 
  so much for checking their sources . 
  this law is not anti-gay , it is aimed at shit like [ this ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/15/russian-children-coloring-book_n_4282899.html ) . 
   furthermore you can get remain in jail pending your verdict no , you ca n't . 
  administrative detainment can be applied , but it ca n't last past 3 hours . 
   thirdly the the fines are n't $ 50 , usually $ 200 and can go up to $ 12,000 . 
  yes , my wrong , it 's not $ 50 , but up to $ 150 ( at a current exchange rate ) . 
  not much a difference , anyway . 
  higher fines are reserved for officials ( up to $ 1500 ) and organizations ( up to $ 30000 ) . 
  except [ they did n't ] ( https://twitter.com/osce_smm/status/490187980305616896 ) . 
  did you even read that law ? 
  first , it has nothing to do with you being gay . 
  it is about what you say and to whom you say it . 
  second , and most important , the jail is out of question . 
  it is * administrative * law , not criminal . 
  you can be fined for about $ 50 , that 's all . 
   it 's the new york fucking times . 
  i think they 've been around long enough to check their sources . 
  you mean like that time when they released an article on new russian ` anti-gay ' law in which they tell us that you can be now put to jail in russia just for being gay ? 
  well , wwii turned out to be a pretty good business for usa . 
  also , ukraine being a battleground would n't actually hurt poroshenko or other ukrainian oligarchs . 
   but that 's very unlikely . 
  why not ? 
  kiev government had no problem whatsoever with attacking civilian targets . 
  this tragedy is very , very convenient for kiev . 
   brought to justice and jailed you mean like it was done in [ 2001 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siberia_airlines_flight_1812#alleged_missile_accident ) by ukraine or in [ 1988 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran_air_flight_655#medals_awarded ) by usa ? 
  oh wait , it was n't . 
  wrong . 
  it would ruin russian industry which still ca n't compete with eu 's without government help . 
  it was actually 300 millions . 
   it also is governed by south ossetians , who might ethnically be russians just to be precise , south ossetians are ethnically ossetian , a small iranian-related ethnicity . 
  ossetia is divided by mountains to north ossetia ( which is part of russian federation , so citizens of north ossetia are also citizens of r.f. ), 
  and south ossetia , which is considered by georgia as georgian ( ossetians themselves have a different opinion on that , and tried to get their independence since ussr went apart ) . 
   i did n't say it is . 
  i said it might as well be what 's your point , exactly ? 
   yeah some very nice peacekeepers are those . 
  constant shellings from right near them . 
  source ? 
   it 's such a weird thing when your country ca n't stop shellings from the territory they 're guarding but they can go a few miles further with its army a and kick the georgian army around do n't you think . 
  nothing weird about it : peacekeeping mission is one thing , full-fledged military operation is completely another . 
   does it suggest that it 's part of russia ? 
  did i missed something , and russia already annexed south ossetia ? 
  anyways , no sane country wants a hot spot on its borders , especially when people of the same ethnicity live in said country just across a mountain . 
  hence russian peacekeepers , and russian reactions after those peacekeepers where shelled by georgia . 
   what was so troubling about letting chechnya go back in the day ? 
  chechnya was independent , for some time ( de-facto independent , at least ) . 
  then they started to make business out of kidnapping and slave trade . 
  even that was tolerated for some time , but then they decided to attack russia . 
   ethnic cleansing of georgians ** from russia ** vityok is most probably talking about thousands of illegal georgian immigrands who were forced to go home shortly after the events of 2008 . 
  this was labeled as ` ethnical cleansing ' by some . 
  also , south ossetia is n't exactly georgian soil . 
  the name kind of suggests it . 
   ethnic cleansing of georgians from russia so sending out illegal immigrants is now ` ethnic cleansing ' . 
  careful there , propaganda of this intensity is very unhealthy . 
  it would be very nice of you to provide some proof to your words . 
  last time i checked , russian reporters were using armor with fucking big ` press ' on it . 
  oh really ? 
  i assume you have some proof to that ? 
  south ossetia is south ossetia , so it is quite possible for georgia to assault it . 
  transfer of russian army was justified by said assault . 
  georgia assaulted south ossetia , not russia . 
  are you high or what ? 
  you 're not very good at evading questions , you know ? 
  so shelling cities with grad is n't starting the war ?
