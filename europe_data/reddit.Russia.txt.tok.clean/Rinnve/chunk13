  and they say that there are no nazis in ukraine . 
  so less like hitler , more like stalin ? 
   why romania and moldova do n't just wipe them out ? 
  are you suggesting outright ethnical cleansing ? 
   or do a referendum , but do n't put armed thugs near the voting places . 
  if you 're talking about crimean referendum , then ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxbpagtbgj4 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mci7albmgn0 i failed to find any armed soldiers at the polling stations . 
   the first vector was a struggle with the horde in alliance with europe ; the second , a struggle with europe in alliance with the horde . 
  [ ... ] daniil galitsky chose the former course , `` a natural and logical one at the cultural-historical level , '' and aleksandr nevsky chose the latter , `` a most profound perversion with far-reaching consequences . '' wat, 
   but he was a oligarch before . 
  was ? 
   because its not a study funded by the russian government so you refuse to accept it . 
  i refuse to accept it not because it is not ` funded by the russian government ' but because there 's nothing in this article besides hearsay . 
  ` some activists say that ... ' and similar bullshit . 
  the only evidence that can be accepted in any discussion is hard facts . 
   ** there is evidence ** that the new `` anti-propaganda '' laws have ** seriously increased violence ** against the lgbt community ( including killings ) . 
  are those your words ? 
  yes , they are . 
  where 's that evidence ? 
  do provide , or stfu already . 
  no data then . 
  too bad . 
   i hate your country for what it has done to the romanian nation in particular you should hate yourself for helping nazis in ww2 . 
   i said nothing about whether or not russia considered us an antagonist . 
  i would not have known . 
  but you can expect something when you do something . 
  building a missile shield around russia does n't translate to a message that nato/usa are ` too busy making money to worry about russia ' . 
  quite the contrary . 
  y so butthurt ? 
   we have to rely on outside news agencies . 
  and we 're seeing data collected by those agencies any second now ... 
   the sepratists started shooting first no they did n't . 
  not on military operation scale , at least . 
  what is certainly not debatable that there were no attempts from kiev government to defuse the situation . 
  they chose military escalation instead , and it 's them who are guilty in all those deaths . 
  not russia , not putin . 
   with russian guns and russian military leadership there is no proof to that . 
   and just because we refused russia 's offer on the missiles did not mean that we thought of them as an antagonist so you build a missile shield around the country , say that it has nothing to do with said country but refuse offer of joint work , and still expect that this would not be considered as an antagonistic move ? 
  yes , if you 're building a freaking missile shield around a country and are saying that it has nothing to do with said country , some friendly action would be really helpful to , you know , support those words . 
  i 'm talking about kosovo 's independence . 
  it was readily accepted despite the lack of , ah , proper procedure . 
  yet somehow crimean referendum was not acceptable . 
   started a civil war in eastern ukraine wait what ? 
  kiev government refused to talk with eastern federalists and started military operation instead , but it 's putin who 's guilty ? 
   the west no longer sees russia as a neutral power the west never did . 
  it was crystal clear from the moment nato refused russia 's offer to work on the missile defense together . 
  oh , please enlighten me how crimean events of nineties were ` debunked ' . 
   what is so very special in the way crimea ended up in ukraine ? 
  history and strategical importance of crimea . 
   but that does n't justify the bigger mistake to forcefully return the territory back harming all the people living there directly first , there was almost no harm done besides iirc two or three casualties . 
  second , it 's either this , or nato base in crimea in several years that completely controls russia 's access to black sea . 
   go home , comrade . 
   as far as i 'm concerned your country is not a part of europe anymore  romania huh ? 
  you said something ? 
  it 's interesting that nobody cared about self-determination of crimean people when ukraine land-grabbed crimea and sevastopol in nineties . 
  also , kosovo . 
   we have a good chunk of our territory occupied by russians it 's actually other way around : crimea is finally free from ukrainian occupation . 
  oversimplifying history does n't help to understand things . 
  ukraine , and especially crimea , is not just ` another sovereign country ' . 
  read about how crimea ended up in ukraine , and may be you 'll understand something . 
  i must repeat my question . 
  do you have any ** data ** that confirm this , or you 're just talking out of your ass ? 
  so no evidence besides hearsay . 
   killings motivated by homophobia are not uncommon in russia what . 
  this is a whole new level of bullshit . 
  i can remember probably one or two such cases in last , say , five years . 
  how that 's ` not uncommon ' ? 
   there is evidence that the new `` anti-propaganda '' laws have seriously increased violence against the lgbt community ( including killings ) . 
  do you have any data that confirm this , or you 're just talking out of your ass ? 
  edit : nothing 's better than morning derp, 
  yes it is . 
  first , the article is not about russia , it 's about russian government . 
  second , and more important , `` internet spreads extremism '' and `` internet can be used for spreading extremism '' are two very different ideas . 
  are you aware that there was no pre-ussr ukraine ? 
  \u0418\u043e\u0444\u0444\u0435 \u0410\u041d \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 . '' board of directors consists mostly of economists , managers , engineers and such , i failed to find * one * `` ex-military or security without relevant expertise '' there . 
   disagree . 
  moscow i do n't know anything about moscow , nor do i care . 
  i know though about local situation . 
   were you around at the time ? 
  all that i 'm talking about is either my personal experience or experience of those of my friends/acquaintances whom i can trust in that . 
   now , it is the siloviki who are the mafia . 
  well , where are those ` siloviki ' now ? 
  how come that in nineties everybody in the city knew who 's a boss and to whom you must talk if you want to start business and if you do n't want it to be burnt down to ashes next day , but nowadays all that you need for business is some money for start ? 
   friends of ours were asked for a bribe as their daughter needed urgent admission into a normal public hospital to have a baby . 
  well , that 's an anecdotal evidence against other anecdotal evidence . 
  both of my parents have serious health issues , and for at least ten years they where never asked for bribes . 
   ah , that is why friends keep moving their businesses where possible out of the country . 
  oh , and my friends feel pretty comfortable right there . 
  no , they are not ex-military or s/s . 
  nineties : corruption is everywhere from top to bottom , you hardly can do anything without bribes and/or * connections * . 
  business is synonymous with corruption , tax evading and organized crime . 
  no honest businessman can feel safe from mafia thugs : you 're at least expected to pay for * protection * , and if mafia boss decides that your business should * change ownership * , well ... tough luck . 
  second decade of xxi century : corruption on lower levels is hardly visible ; doctors , policemen and other state-paid workers are actually doing their jobs without bribes at every corner . 
  small to medium business is mostly safe . 
  you can actually plan for several years and more . 
  there are thousands of anti-corruption court cases every year , sometimes targeting very high-level officials . 
  those are very interesting results for policy of ` compromising ownership ' and ` promoting cronyism and corruption ' . 
  actually , [ you can .
