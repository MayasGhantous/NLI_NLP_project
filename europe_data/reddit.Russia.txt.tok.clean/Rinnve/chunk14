  why is aljazeera quiet ? 
  even biased western news channels make no such claims . 
  there was only one report of 3 tanks crossing the border . 
  it is amusing how you wrote a wall of text that does n't answer any of my questions . 
   there are reports every fucking day . 
  links , please ? 
  you 're so wrong i do n't even know where to start . 
  what middle class worth mentioning by the end of the nineties ? 
  what was the way putin suppressed said middle class ? 
  and apparently the best way to ` restore the ascendance of the new oligarchy ' is to control oligarchs and to push them out of politics . 
  thank you for reminding me that / r/europe is not a place for discussions . 
  you can , for example , report about orders that you think were wrong . 
  why so ? 
  the difference is that you can do something about it . 
  questioning orders and following them are two different things , you know . 
   russia 's current jingoistic policy the what  people have more of a problem with the russian leadership than russian culture yeah , there sure is a problem when the west did n't see a problem at all with perma-drunk eltsyn and with disastrous ` free market ' economical reforms that put most russians to the brink of poverty , but suddenly when russia gains some strength , there are tons of troubles here and there . 
  it is rather simple on the surface `` russia weak west happy , russia stronk west unhappy '' logic ; although i really do n't like to dive down this shit , i bet it 's quite deep , deeper than you 'd think . 
  an army that does n't question stupid and suicidal orders is a very , very bad army . 
  also , it would be really nice to see any actual examples of ` turning whole nation into an army ' . 
  what, 
  russia ranked 4/5 for political terror , 3/5 for * internal * organized conflicts , 3/5 for deaths in * internal * organized conflicts . 
  what . 
  are those guys aware that chechnya war is over for more than ten years ? 
  and 4/5 for political terror , like china ? 
  who 're ` they ' ? 
  `` genocide is the systematic destruction of all or part of a racial , ethnic , religious or national group '' according to wikipedia . 
  holodomor killed people of different ethnicities , and it was not `` systematic destruction '' , you do n't send hundreds of thousands tons of food to people you want to starve to death . 
  hence , it was not a genocide . 
  and no , it 's not my compatriots who are responsible for it . 
  stalin was georgian , his top officers were of different ethnicities , local party officers in ukraine were mostly ukrainian . 
  it is soviet system and soviet government who is responsible for it , and in no small part bad weather conditions . 
   this is what blows my mind about ** holodomor deniers ** so discussing holodomor is denying it . 
   since ukraine chooses to commemorate and honor the memory of those who died ; we 're the ones in the wrong ? 
  it 's not about ukrainians who commemorate and honor holodomor . 
  it 's about ukrainians ( and many other people , often living literally half a world away ) who twist the history to spread anti-russian propaganda ( `` russians starved ukrainians , russians bad and evil '' ) . 
   and it 's not called `` ukrainian holodomor '' just holodomor it is , by some . 
  that 's the myth i 'm talking about . 
   russia treat it like not that big of a deal what ? 
  nobody treats it like it 's not that big of a deal . 
  it was a terrible disaster , and in no small part human-made disaster . 
  it was not an attempt at ethnical cleansing , though . 
  the myth i 'm talking about is , to put it simply , `` stalin intentionally starved million ukrainians to death '' or , even better , '' * russians * intentionally starved million ukrainians to death '' . 
  conspiracy much ? 
   or is it a myth because since it happened russia tries to present it as one oh really ? 
   it 's not normal you know , for people to starve to death because government took away their food . 
  on that i agree ...  it may not have been planned as an ethnic cleansing but that 's what it turned into . 
  ... and on that - i do not . 
  the name '' ** ukrainian ** holodomor '' is an insult to the memory of million russians and kazakhs who shared this horrible fate . 
  not only ukraine suffered in that famine , you know . 
  oh , and it was much more complicated than just `` government taking away food '' . 
  oversimplification of history to the point of black and white serves only one need : propaganda , brainwashing . 
   especially calling holodomor a myth is a nice coverage of current events but it is a myth , at least the way ukrainian nationalists try to present it . 
  numbers are grossly exaggerated , inconvenient facts are not mentioned . 
  all in all it is presented as an coordinated attempt at a genocide , which it was n't . 
  writing and publishing the book does n't take long , actually , if done by professionals . 
  6 months is more than enough for that . 
  this is actually not correct . 
  for example , some eu countries have strict laws against holocaust revisionism ( and i 'm not talking about arguing about the event itself , but mere questioning the numbers is prohibited too ) . 
  it was never third world in the sense that uganda or somali are third world . 
   undeveloped , uncivilized and poor which ussr was n't . 
   and you must be kidding with advanced science and technology ... second in the world ( and sometimes first ) space program ? 
  check . 
  second in nuclear technology and weaponry ? 
  check . 
  word `` tokamak '' ( name for a most promising type of fusion reactors ) is russian acronym . 
  there were pretty interesting developments in computing ( for example , computers based on ternary logic ) , but sadly it was scrapped and ussr started to copy usa machines . 
   did you know that it was nokia that build the first digital phone network to ussr ? 
  source ? 
  the only ussr digital phone network i can recall is iskra-2 which used tesla equipment ( basically licensed ericsson equipment made in yugoslavia ) . 
   you do n't need the ussr or communism to have all of those . 
  most of europe has all of those . 
  i do n't think that they had that in 1950s or 1960s . 
   why do you think little estonia has better life standards for its people than big russia mostly because it 's small . 
   i loathe people who tend to view the soviet union as something good it might surprise you , but real world is n't black and white . 
  let 's see ... free medicine , free education , social guarantees , fairly advanced science and technology that was able to compete with the only country in the world that actually won wwii . 
  thank you for providing an example of what i 've been speaking about . 
   the current russian trend of whitewashing the history of the ussr is very troubling . 
  the current western trend of smearing the history of the ussr is very troubling too . 
  i 'm not even speaking about ~ ~ poles ~ ~ eastern europeans , they 've always hated russia with passion . 
  soviet union was much more than stalin 's atrocities . 
   news, 
   putin calls the breakup of the soviet union the greatest tragedy of the 20th century and does n't even mind renaming one of their cities back to ` stalingrad ' . 
  first , not a tragedy , but a `` geopolitical catastrophe '' ( and it was ) . 
  second , about stalingrad what he said is that according to russian laws , it must be decided by the people living in the city . 
  in other words , he is neutral about that . 
  and last , putin also said once : `` whoever does not miss the soviet union has no heart . 
  whoever wants it back has no brain . '', 
   why on earth does russia suddenly have the right to dictate alliances other sovereign nations enter ? 
   usa shut the fuck up . 
  mad is what keeps the world from using nuclear weapons . 
  if this balance is undermined , and if there are mad enough politicians in power , bad things could happen . 
   you grossly overestimate the capacity of this missile shield . 
  it is being developed . 
  10 interceptors now , but how many in , say , ten years - if russia lets this slip unnoticed ? 
   if russia would want to nuke the west it is not about russia nuking the west . 
  it is about the west nuking russia without danger of nuclear answer ; or at least the west using that possibility as a leverage . 
  i know , all this sounds like a wild guess , but what can be another possible purpose of missile shield around russia ? 
  without missile shield , first strike from either side leads to retaliatory strike and mutual destruction . 
  with nato missile shield , first strike from russian side leads to mad , but first strike from nato side does n't as retaliatory strike is managed by missile shield . 
  this missile shield is undermining mutually assured destruction ( mad ) .
