  thing is , it ca n't stop first nuclear strike from russian side , there are too many icbms , but if some of russian launch sites are destroyed by first strike from nato , then missile shield can protect from retaliatory response . 
  it is a strategic advantage , and it can be used as a leverage to threaten russia . 
  ( i sincerely hope that even hardcore usa neocons are n't mad enough to really consider nuclear assault , but who knows . ), 
   and it 's definitely not one of the ukranian t-64bm bulat tanks . 
  it 's not like there are * only * t-64bm in ukraine . 
   hell , there are actual russians among the rebels . 
  there are actual russians * living * in that region , and not in a small amount . 
  now this nato report you 've linked is more like it , although it still lives many questions . 
  there is something missing in this article ... what was that word ? . . 
  evidence . 
  i do n't watch russian media . 
  like , at all . 
  careful there , do n't choke on that russophobia of yours . 
  invaded disputed territory , not georgia proper . 
   georgia did nothing bad to russia , only being the unfortunate country to fail at land grab and succeed at stirring up ethnical conflicts near russian borders . 
  ftfy . 
  in those messages i was obviously talking about the events of 2008 when georgia launched ` large-scale military offencive ' but it was turned by western propaganda like it was russia who started it . 
   but you did - just read your messages , where you tried to bend over and not call it an invasion . 
  so quote my message then . 
   vladibot so you 're out of arguments and descent to ad hominem . 
   so why did you try to say otherwise ? 
  : ddd but i did n't . 
   and when everything fails we go the other russian way - blame west . 
  and that i did n't too ( except for mentioning nato brutality : those bombings were hardly necessary imo ) . 
  well , duh !, 
  so did nato in serbia , and they did it for basically the same reason ( although it was much more brutal ) . 
   it was an invasion . 
  invasion , by definition , is when sothing * invades * something . 
  how those troops could invade crimea if they were * already there * ? 
  what 's more important , most crimeans seem to be happy about it . 
   how is nato on the offensive ? 
  by undermining mad . 
  nato missile shield that is closing up on russia ca n't prevent first strike from russian side , but it can protect from retaliatory strike if some russian icbm launch sites are destroyed by first strike from nato . 
   attacking other countries it 's not like russia is attacking random countries or does it without serious reason . 
  oh , and technically it was not an annexation : first crimea became autonomous , and only then they voted to join russia . 
  do you even read ? 
  i repeat , it is either georgia continues to `` calm '' this region for years and years ( caucasian people are generally very stubborn , some abkhazians being muslims does not help that at all ) , or russia invades and stops that madness with superior force . 
  i see no third alternative . 
  * edit : it appears that not all abkhazians are muslims , and their religious beliefs are actually quite interesting and unique . 
   do you remember when vladimir admitted that russian forces were in crimea ? 
  they were * already * there , there were no need to invade some more . 
   you said what happened , like georgia tried to force abkhazia to stay ( just like now ukraine is trying to keep east parts of the country ) no , not just like that . 
  abkhazians are completely different nation with their own language and culture , they are not georgian . 
  they were pretty autonomous in ussr , but when it crumbled , georgia decided to do a land grab . 
  russia does not want ` hot ' region near its borders , hence peace keepers . 
  and yes , it basically requires that abkhazia remains autonomous , because the only alternative would be yet another violent war led by georgia with very possible ethnical cleansing in revenge . 
  what this regions needs is some peace and quiet , not ` antiseparatist ' operations . 
   you 're saying that russia is the one defending itself from aggression from nato ? 
  it is pretty obvious . 
   russia literally invaded and annexed territory early this year . 
  crimea was not invaded , and crimean people themselves decided that they had enough of ukrainian madness . 
  also poland already had annexed parts of russia for quite some time , so who knows what those poles are thinking . 
  there are plenty other methods of aggression besides outright invasion . 
  the fate of ussr showed that quite clearly , as did the fate of middle east , eternally burning not without external ` help ' . 
  on their own , yes . 
  they are not on their own though . 
  yep , georgia tried to force abkhazia to stay , abkhazians responded violently ( and btw it was cleansing of * non-abkhazians * , not just georgians , although they suffered most of it ) . 
  somehow it is russia who is responsible for that . 
  oh , that figures . 
  they should 've made it clear . 
  btw , that editorial is hilarious on itself . 
  maps and opinions of unnamed ` experts ' published in small tabloid of questionable quality suddenly became political will of moscow . 
  one russian tabloid . 
  single , not plural . 
  also , it is amusing attempt at not-very-subtle propaganda for those who ca n't read original and ca n't use google translate . 
  the article `` quotes '' original : `` but poor poland . 
  once a firm slavic friend , then a staunch communist ally , now a wannabe westie , poland is punished for its disloyalty to mother russia by dismemberment . 
  [ ... ] it seems strange that russia would willingly part with its westernmost territory , but the point being made takes precedence over the sacredness of russia 's borders : to drive home to warsaw the foolishness of stepping out from under russia 's protective umbrella . '' in the actual original ( and in the blog repost of it ) : `` '' in other words , this `` quote '' appears out of author 's hat . 
  * edit : that quote is actually from foreign policy 's frank jacobs ' editorial [ linked in the article ] ( http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/06/04/what_russia_could_look_like_in_2035_if_putin_gets_his_wish_ukraine_irredentism ) . 
  i assume it reads more ... sensational when the quote is not sourced properly so it appears like it was in the russian article when it is actually words of some dumbass from fp . 
  says who . 
  you mean georgian invasion to south ossetia ? 
   this idiotic `` historical rights '' i 'm not talking about `` historical rights '' , i 'm talking about the will of the people . 
  people of south ossetia do not want to be a part of georgia , and they fought for it . 
   and your justification is worthless since russia was just as brutal to chechnya as the chechnyans were to the russians . 
  may be , as a retaliation , but it was not russians who started ethnical cleansing and acts of terrorism . 
   you didnt see georgia firing missiles at ossetia . 
  oh really ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tskhinvali#2008_south_ossetian_war `` tskhinvali was shelled by the georgian government on 8 august 2008 with bm-21 `` grad '' mobile artillery rocket systems in an attempt to regain control over the breakaway republic of south ossetia . ''  i would like to see some sources on the 100k dead russian civilians , as that is quite extreme . 
  about that i 'm not sure at all , i 'm bad with numbers . 
  there are some sources in [ wikipedia ] ( http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%ad%d1%82%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%87%d0%b5%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%b5_%d1%87%d0%b8%d1%81%d1%82%d0%ba%d0%b8_%d0%b2_%d0%a7%d0%b5%d1%87%d0%bd%d0%b5 ) , no exact numbers though . 
  i 'm pretty sure though that most of russians were forced to leave chechnya in nineties ( according to [ that source ] ( http://www.stav.aif.ru/society/law/157434 ) , about 200k people ) . 
  i 'm also very , very sure about multiple brutal acts of terrorism . 
   russia is continually using its military to aggressively expand its national borders care to mention where exactly russia `` continually and aggressively expanded its borders '' ? 
   russian media is blaring nonstop lies about how the evil , homosexual europe is basically preparing to invade wat . 
  well , some latvians fought on the nazi side ( there was entire ss brigade ) , so who knows . 
  peace . 
  without quotes . 
  like , nobody shooting anything or blowing things up . 
  it worked , for a time . 
   but the things that the article mentioned as being `` russophobe '' were exactly just being skeptical . 
  may be . 
  but my initial comment was not strictly on topic , i disagreed with russophobia being something `` invented '' and apparently non-existent at all . 
   if you attack the politics by claiming people are personally russophobic , you 'll get nowhere . 
  on that i can completely agree . 
  attacks on personal traits ( good or bad , existing or not ) generally lead nowhere . 
   speakadi english ? 
  [ you ca n't into english slang . 
  ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=can't%20into ), 
   georgian soil is georgian soil because they inherited it from the georgian ssr yep , and to hell with ossetins who were part of russian empire since xvii century and do not what to be part of georgia .
