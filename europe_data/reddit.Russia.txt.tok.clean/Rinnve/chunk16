   tell me what makes putins slaughter of chechnyans and the crackdown against ossetian seperatism different let me guess , the fact that chechen separatists made chechens dominating ethnicity in chechnya by killing about 100 000 russians and forcing about 200 000 out by death threats ? 
  or the fact that they made business out of kidnapping and slave labor ? 
  or the fact that they actually committed many acts of terrorism ? 
   other than the fact that chechnyans are muslims , while ossetians are white , ethnic russians ossetians , as well as chechens , belong to caucasian race ( = are white ) , and both ethnicities are * not * russian ( although they both share a plenty of history with russia , being historically parts of russian empire ) . 
  srsly , you know almost nothing about the topic yet are trying to discuss it . 
  this is n't even funny . 
  yep . 
  russia historically invaded all of its european neighbors , so they are wary of russia . 
  lets not bring up that inconvenient history about all of russia 's neighbors invading it historically and even annexing some parts of it for a time , yes ? 
  there is no reason at all for russia to be wary of those neighbors , no , no reason at all . 
  mostly because russia helped to keep peace in that region after mutual attempts at ethnical cleansing between georgians and ossetins . 
  the fact that there is also north ossetia which is actually a part of russia but is populated by the same ossetins only complicates it all . 
  it is not similar , and i 'm not stating that it is similar . 
  what i 'm trying to say that it is apparently ok to not ask people they opinion or even ignore their opinion if it weakens russia , but it is suddenly very , very important to ask it all properly and without haste if that opinion can be pro-russian . 
  georgians think that this is their soil , ossetins think that it is their . 
  they both are ready to kill each other for that , and they did . 
  ** joint ** ( as in ` not only russian ' ) peacekeeping forces were there for a reason , you know . 
  what 's hard to understand about that ? 
  georgians attacked after nato hinted that they will support them , it would be just another round of ethnical cleansing fun . 
  nato fucking * bombed * yugoslavia for that . 
   you 're deliberately and knowingly twisting the facts in some grand scheme of propaganda for the benefit of mother russia i 'm quoting english wikipedia , you moron . 
  according to the laws of ussr ( that still existed during that time ) an ssr can exit ussr if people decide so , ** but ** if there are autonomous republics or regions in that ssr then separate referendum must be done for those republics or regions . 
  that was not done . 
  finally , sevastopol . 
   right , russia 's actions are totally not ok . not by international law , and not by treaties russia has signed . 
  please quote any treaties or articles of international law russia did break . 
   well if the people in crimea would have wanted they could have voiced their opinion then . 
  thing is , they did . 
  twice at least , first one back in nineties . 
  why do you think ukrainian government forcibly changed their ( crimeans ) constitution ? 
  some more info here : http://iisr.ru/news49.html ( google translate is your friend if you do n't know russian ) . 
   trying to blame this whole conflict on anyone but russia is plain stupid . 
  european union tried to push yanukovich to that economical agreement that would have those consequences : ( a ) opening ukrainian market for superior eu-made goods , thus indirectly economically attacking russian market ( ukraine and russia had essentially free trade agreements , so russia would be forced to either put severe restrictions on trade with ukraine or to suck it up and suffer economically ) ; ( b ) ditching eastern ukrainian industry which is still important for russia ( especially russian military ) but have no use for eu ; ( c ) refusing to prolong sevastopol agreement by 2017 , forcing russian navy out to strategically and logistically inferior novorossiysk and finishing this apparently unnoticed ukrainian land grab . 
  ( sevastopol was not a part of ukraine even after crimea was given to ukraine ; sevastopol was city of state importance and answered directly to moscow ; in 1994 sevastopol made last attempt to remain in russia but failed . ), 
  i 'm not even talking about events that followed . 
   you truly are brainwashed . 
  no u edit : sevastopol was n't russian from the start , i ca n't into ancient history . 
  it is amusing how the west was totally ok with russia of 1990s breaking apart , how it was ok when nobody asked crimeans do they want to * leave * russia and also ok for ukrainian army to force crimeans to stay in ukraine and for ukrainian government to force changes in the constitution of autonomous republic of crimea , but it is totally not ok for , you know , current events and all . 
  getting a grip on what ? 
  i do n't quite understand you there . 
  oh , and putin is not a problem , at least no more than most of other major politicians ( especially of that one country across the world ) . 
  things like those i 've quoted are not just `` being skeptical '' . 
  it is irrational hate and fear ( or fear and hate ) . 
  `` during the night of 7 august 2008 , after months of escalated tensions and clashes between georgian and south ossetian forces , ** georgia launched a large-scale military offensive against south ossetia ** '' `` an independent international fact-finding mission headed by swiss diplomat heidi tagliavini was established by the eu to determine the causes of the war . 
  [ ... ] ** the report claimed that conflict started '' ... with a large-scale georgian military operation against the town of tskhinvali and the surrounding areas , launched in the night of 7 to 8 august 2008 '' ** '' yep , ignorant you are . 
   invasion of georgia you 're pretty ignorant , are n't you ? 
  `` their still just a damn tribe that got lost from some mountains in siberia . 
  screw russia on all levels possible . '' `` a big cancer of europe . '' yep , very rational . 
  i 'm not a country , you know . 
   someone invented notion of `` russophobe '' some quotes from this very thread : `` i reject the whole concept of them being in europe . 
  same way as turkey . 
  they might have some land here , and in the case of russia most of their people live in what is classified as europe but their still just a damn tribe that got lost from some mountains in siberia . 
  screw russia on all levels possible . '' `` russia is like barking dog . 
  a big cancer of europe . '' invented my ass . 
   there is such a thing as political responsibility . 
  precisely . 
  there is difference between being responsible for evil doing as a political leader , and being actual evil doer ( and i 'm * not * saying that former is somehow better * or * worse ) . 
  from historical point of view , simplifications like `` stalin murdered millions of people '' are very bad because : 1 ) they overshadow role of other people , thus skewing our understanding of events ; 2 ) they overshadow other things that stalin or hitler or whoever did , thus skewing our understanding even further . 
  so stalin was not mass murderer , he was political leader who was responsible for taking a major part in building political system that , amongst other things , fast-tracked russia from backwards mostly agricultural country to industrial powerhouse capable of winning worst war in the history of mankind - and yes , this political system also killed a whole lot people in the process . 
  as i 've said , history is not black and white . 
  source ? 
  because i 'm pretty sure that he did n't . 
  it 's not the argument that is wrong , it 's its use . 
  it does not matters that there was no signed order to exterminate ` untermench ' ( not just jews ) , because this is what actually happened . 
  death camps happened , industrial level killings happened . 
  what is also wrong is oversimplifying it to mere `` hitler the murderer hurr durr '' . 
  it was not hitler himself who exterminated millions of people for their nationality . 
  that 's what is important to remember , that is main historical lesson of wwii . 
  same with stalin . 
  it is extremely important to see history as it is , without painting it black and white . 
  ( `` we endlessly criticize stalin , and , of course , for the cause . 
  and yet i want to ask - who has written four million denunciation reports ? '' ), 
  thing is , stalin did much more , and not all of what he did was evil ; and much of evil usually contributed personally to stalin was , actually , done by somebody else . 
  he killed nobody , as far as i know . 
  oh forgive me please . 
  i completely forgot you ca n't argue about russia with eternally butthurt poles . 
  what 's wrong with the referendum about that name change ? 
   if he wanted to make this statement more political he would say that it 's up to citizens of volgograd blah blah . 
  but putin went and suggested something like that . 
  in the article : `` responding to a veteran 's suggestion to restore the name of stalingrad , putin said it could be decided by a public vote . '' it is good to actually read the article before discussing it . 
   floods covered the altai region of russia for four days . 
  very little was done by the russian authorities , in fact , russian media downplayed and ignored the whole disaster . 
  what ? 
  it was in russian news on daily basis . 
  i assume that your lies are aimed at non-russian speaking redditors . 
  quite stupid . 
  well , i 'm quite influential too . 
  for some people . 
  for other , not so much . 
  it is all about sphere of influence . 
   loooot of articles that state he is influential ideologue yep . 
  `` state '' . 
  like in `` dugin is influential [ because we say so ] '' . 
  well , there is a whole abyss of difference between being somewhat influential professor and being personal adviser to the president . 
  well , running around in circles can be one example of being pretty active . 
  not that it could help anybody . 
  so the key role of poland was being biggest russia-hater ? 
  do i understand you correctly ? 
  what positions and titles ? 
  wikipedia reveals nothing spectacular .
