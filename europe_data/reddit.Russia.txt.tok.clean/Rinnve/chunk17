  as for ideas ... well , could you be more specific ? 
  what makes you think that dugin has * any * influence on putin 's ` vision ' ( whatever it may mean ) ? 
  actually that does n't have anything with basis of a particular economy . 
  for example , wealth inequality in resource-based norway is considerably less than in usa . 
  what exactly were those `` efforts '' in which poland was a key actor ? 
  no it does not . 
  it may correlate to some extent , but that 's it . 
  since when dugin is `` putin adviser '' ? 
  `` poland has been a key actor in efforts to defuse the ukraine crisis '' wat . 
  i am sorry , but gdp has nothing to do with standard of living . 
  bulgaria and romania joined eu in 2007 . 
  poland , estonia and czech republic joined eu in 2004 . 
  i do n't think that being in eu for three years longer can explain the difference . 
  more like it 's poland being poland and romania being romania . 
   rest of eastern europe has shown like bulgaria or romania ? 
   btw poland 's pi\u0142sudski asked france and uk to preventively attack nazi germany together with poland in early thirties btw ussr offered essentially the same to france and uk . 
  they failed to achieve any agreement . 
  say thank you to france and uk for ribbentrop-molotov pact . 
   they still think ww2 started in 1941 . 
  that 's a lie . 
  gpw started in 1941 , ww2 started in 1939 , that 's what is written in our history books . 
  and it 's relevant in this context because ... ? 
  oh really ? 
  and why not german-polish non-aggression pact ? 
  why not entire europe doing nothing while in 1935 germany finally violated treaty of versailles ? 
  oh wait , i know . 
  because russia . 
  so you do n't know european history . 
  that 's sad . 
   the first one they 've kidnapped was hanged . 
  it 's `` hanged himself '' . 
  `` after sunday 's elections in ukraine , vladimir putin may turn his attention westward toward moldova , where russia is sending spies , beaming in propaganda -- and threatening economic strangulation . 
  it 's all part of an effort to help the communists there defeat the liberal democratic government . '' pure gold . 
  so , snyder dumped another load of bullshit about russia . 
  in other news : summer is upon us . 
   the `` interim administration '' announced they 'd be petitioning to join russia whichever way the vote goes . 
  source ? 
   the choice was between joining russia right away , or a few days later . 
  the choice was stated quite clearly in the ballots . 
  join russia or remain in ukraine . 
   they didnt include the option to stay with ukraine in the vote except they did . 
  the two choices were to became russian or became an autonomous republic in ukraine on the terms of the crimean constitution of 1992 year ( which basically means that crimea remains ukrainian but can decide for itself with which countries do business ) . 
  is eu saying basically `` fuck off russia '' a smokescreen too ? 
  you were under wrong impression then . 
  putin offered trilateral talks ( eu-ukraine-russia ) back then in november 2013 . 
  for example : http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/news/putin_russia_ready_for_trilateral_talks_with_eu_and_ukraine_on_association_313313, 
  that 's rich , coming from an ukrainian . 
  not just `` moldovans '' . 
  we 're talking illegal immigrants here . 
  that 's a quote from this article . 
  it apparently misses a comma before `` stops '' . 
  `` why should russia maintain the existing status quo if moldova , which feeds itself and replenishes its budget with [ remittances from ] migrant workers , stops being close , friendly or even neutral towards the russian state . '', 
   we look at neighbors like slovakia , poland , hungary , romania , and we see that they are doing better . 
  maybe not significantly better , but still better than ukraine . 
  with russia , things would just remain the same , and we 've seen that for the past few years . 
  [ suuuure ... ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=ro&amp;c=rs&amp;c=lo&amp;c=up&amp;v=69 ), 
  `` why should russia maintain the existing status quo if moldova , which feeds itself and replenishes its budget with [ remittances from ] migrant workers stops being close , friendly or even neutral towards the russian state . '' seriously , why ?

  ** extreme ** like , you know , actual fascists did ( one example : [ `` claiming that italians were a superior race to african races and thereby had the right to colonize the `` inferior '' africans , it sought to settle 10 to 15 million italians in libya . '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fascism_and_ideology ) ), 
  could you provide some links to that ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm open to any new data and ideas . 
  that 's called `` patriotism '' . 
  seriously ? 
  oh , really ? 
  do you have some examples of that ? 
   socialism in one country is an example . 
  because you say so ? 
  current russia is n't nationalistic either . 
  not extreme nationalistic , at least . 
  it would be nice to actually see some examples of `` extreme soviet nationalism '' . 
  and this is related to extreme nationalism how , exactly ? 
  are you aware that stalin was n't even russian , as well as many of ussr government of that time ? 
   [ x ] and extreme nationalism huh ? 
  `` the option of asking people if they wish to stick with the status quo - in which ** crimea enjoys autonomy but remains part of ukraine ** - is not on offer . '' second option was * exactly * this . 
  according to article 9 of the old constitution , crimea republic is a part of ukraine . 
  under no article of the old crimean constitution crimea has rights to secede . 
  it had rights to deal with other states independently , but that 's the meaning of autonomy . 
  crimea had no autonomy whatsoever after ukraine ditched it 's constitution , so `` status quo in which crimea enjoys autonomy '' is really `` status quo in which crimea enjoys the word ` autonomous ' '' . 
  on the side note , it is very funny how the west is completely ok with ukraine slowly consuming historically and culturally russian territory for the last twenty years , but not ok with it returning under russian control . 
   the second lead to russian puppet regime . 
  no , the second option was restoring autonomy which was stripped in nineties by ukraine . 
   i 'm sure the people of crimea were not pressured in any way with tanks at every corner . 
  judging by their reaction , i 'd say they were relieved that this time ukraine did n't dare to send another neonazi `` train of friendship '' like it was done in 1992 . 
   there were two options and both lead to annexation . 
  this is not true . 
  not all , only those who praise bandera . 
  when exactly it became simplistic ? 
   then who is he ? 
  a clown , basically speaking . 
   another thing is that , after such an outrage , any descent politician would leave public life just out of simple shame . 
  i seriously doubt that this man is familiar with the concept of decency . 
   perforemed by senior officials zhirinovsky is not a senior official . 
   i hope that what we 've learned out of all this is that history is not some simple black and white scenario . 
  i hope so because , duh , that 's what i 've stated from the start . 
  let 's just not get absolute relative here because , well , some things are just evil . 
  moral relativity goes only so far . 
  deliberate killing of women and children of some nationality ca n't be justified no matter what . 
  it was scientifically proved that ukrainians were not deliberately killed in the awful famine called holodomor . 
  yes , unlike other famines of that time , that famine was in significant part due to human factor , a `` mismanagement '' if you want . 
  no , it was not deliberately targeted at ukrainians ; actually , soviet government tried to contain it and sent many tons of grain and food as a help to starving region .
