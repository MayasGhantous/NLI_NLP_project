  it is `` man-made famine '' because , well , men made it happen while dragging a backward country to an idealistic industrial future . 
  was it a horrible mistake ? 
  yes . 
  was it `` russian empire '' doing it ? 
  no , ussr was not russian , it was nation-neutral ; actually , it was ukrainian communist party who did much of the thing . 
  was it `` starving ukrainians '' ? 
  no , russian farmers suffered dearly too , and other smaller nations ( sorry , kazakhstan , you got it only half-bad that time , let 's focus on ukraine , yeah , right ? 
  yeah ? ), 
  it actually pains me that this particular famine is overused politically but other famine that happened just ten years before that is almost forgotten . 
  about seven million russian people died there , it is even rooted deeply in our language as `` starving povolzhie '' , soviets practically begged for help , but no , it is not significant . 
  all famines that happened before or after are insignificant but lo and behold , 1931 , ukraine !, 
  horrible !, 
  i hate this world . 
  entire europe collaborated with the nazis in that period , as it is confirmed by the fragment i 've cited . 
  ussr ( not russians as people ! ), 
  was no different from france or uk in that matter . 
  it would be strange for ussr to sit tight while others play that dirty game . 
  it is though not considered a good thing . 
  there is a world of difference between accepting history and condemning committed wrongs , and making a fucking * hero * from well-known nazi ideologist , `` freedom fighter '' whose `` freedom fighting '' apparently involves massive ethnical cleansings , complete with women and children . 
   hitler 's fierce anti-soviet rhetoric was one of the reasons why the uk and france decided that soviet participation in the 1938 munich conference regarding czechoslovakia would be both dangerous and useless . 
  [ 22 ] the munich agreement that followed [ 23 ] marked a partial german annexation of czechoslovakia in late 1938 followed by its complete dissolution in march 1939 , [ 24 ] which as part of the appeasement of germany conducted by chamberlain 's and daladier 's cabinets . 
  as for katyn , well ...  the soviet union claimed the victims had been murdered by the nazis , and continued to deny responsibility for the massacres ** until 1990 , when it officially acknowledged and condemned the perpetration of the killings by the nkvd , as well as the subsequent cover-up by the soviet government . 
   hence ukrainian nationalists are easily labelled as ` fascists ' that 's what you get for trying to make a hero from [ nazi collaborator ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stepan_bandera ) , leader of [ the party ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organization_of_ukrainian_nationalists ) that [ committed horrible atrocities ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) . 
   still , you have to admit russia is far , far , far closer to a petro-state than it should be , considering the rather high level of education the ussr did indeed manage to bestow on the population yeah , that 's right . 
  hi-tech stuff is especially lacking ( although our military managed to move to home-made hard - and software ; stuff 's expensive as hell though ) . 
  things start to change , or so it seems . 
  hell , even infamous lada cars are at least half-decent now !, 
  nasa rockets use russian engines . 
  rosatom has 20 contracts on building nuclear power stations , worldwide , and another 40 are being discussed . 
  if that 's not 1st world things then i do n't even know what is . 
  do n't get fooled by massive gas and oil exports , russian economy is hardly a `` petro-state '' . 
   when it comes to actual contribution and sophistication , the russian nation is pretty close to 3rd world status . 
  says finland . 
  oh the irony . 
  nokia makes pretty good phones though . 
  hypocrisy here is reaching levels dangerous for human health . 
  careful there . 
  do you even read ? 
  i read it , there is nothing new to me . 
  article manages to completely avoid questions of economy and logistics , making the transfer look like completely political decision ( thus , not really justified ) . 
  there are indeed some sources , but none that confirm that `` research '' ( which is not really a research , but just another opinion ) . 
   i present to you a fragment of graffiti from saint sophia in kyiv . 
  it says `` maty ne hotyachy dytycha bizha het '' . 
  in ukrainian language it looks like this : `` \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f\u0447\u0438 \u0434\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0447\u0430 \u0431\u0456\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0433\u0435\u0442\u044c '' ( maty ne hotyachy dytyncha bizhyt het -- the mother who does n't want her baby runs away ) . 
  not a big difference , is n't it ? 
  russian language changed a lot since xvii century ( peter the great times ) , english language changed a lot too , but ukrainian language hardly changed for nearly a millennia ? 
  smells fishy . 
   there are a lot of linguistic features in these graffiti that we still use in the ukrainian language and in general , * in slavic languages except russian . 
  * good old `` russia is n't even slavic '' . 
  yeah , smells really fishy . 
  it was not exactly a give away , more like in-state transfer ( both ukrainian ssr and rsfsr were parts of ussr at the time ) . 
  as for reasons , it is not completely clear . 
  one of more sane and sound explanation is from sergei khruschev : [ reasons where economical/logistical ] ( http://www.golos-ameriki.ru/content/crimea-krushev-history/1866005.html ) . 
   just because you never used it does n't mean it 's not there . 
  says who ? 
  some guy from outside ? 
  i think it 's easier to see what 's inside when you 're , well , inside . 
  of course i don 's see everything . 
  of course i mostly see only two cities . 
  but i have no reasons at all to think that those two rather provincial , backwater cities are special in some way . 
   pretty much all public projects are plagued with cuts and kickbacks schemes well , name one country , just one country that does n't have this problem . 
  hint : the word `` kickback '' is not of russian origin . 
  also , it does n't affect regular people , not visibly enough , and it 's visibility that matters for regular people . 
   corrupt police force and education system means it really loses effectiveness . 
  yeah , so there were many court trials in this area , thousands of people went into jails , lost their positions , paid heavy fines . 
  there is , of course , still some corruption , even pretty high for european standards . 
  those things do n't go out on one 's wish . 
  but compared to yeltsin 's era ? 
  it 's night and day . 
   there have been a lot of scandals about dissertation plagiarism recently . 
  exactly . 
  what was considered normal just fifteen or even ten years ago is dragged into the light now . 
   pretty much all russian universities dropped out global university rankings ( the top 200 ) . 
  why ? 
  why ? 
  do n't really know . 
  may be it 's somehow connected to the fact that people do n't get younger over time , and to the other fact that it 's easier to earn money running some business or , say , writing code . 
  was infested during yeltsin 's rule . 
  and i ca n't even blame those teachers , doctors and professors : it 's quite hard not to be at least somewhat corrupt if you simply ca n't make it without , uh , some * `` side profits '' * . 
  well , guess what ? 
  things change . 
  to put it simply , for last ten years i do n't remember a single account of bribing someone for what must be done legally , not by me nor by people i know well enough to be informed of such deals . 
   corruption is massive . 
  everybody knows about this . 
  from old to young . 
  yet , how does the regime still survive ? 
  regular people do n't really care about corruption or lack of it , as long as it does not messes with their lives . 
  same goes for freedom of speech , by the way . 
  regular people do care about their paychecks , availability of public services , about education and other such things . 
  putin and his government managed to do just fine in that department , much better than yeltsin . 
  careful there , do n't choke on that russophobia . 
  there was no `` program '' , as far as i know . 
  there was an experiment . 
   but russia does have special forces geared towards terror ops and infiltration into enemy countries . 
  and you know that from ... ? 
  hint : how many `` enemy countries '' did russian forces invade in last , oh , ten years or so ? 
  that 's not important , like , at all . 
  who in their right mind cares about unemployment or poverty ? 
  [ will hire ukrainians ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp3imjyucio ) or , one could say , [ ukrainian household robots ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ru&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fru.tsn.ua%2fukrayina%2fv-polshe-televeduschiy-v-pryamom-efire-oskorbil-ukrainok.html&amp;act=url ) . 
   the russian government exacted impobssible requisiton levels on ukraine , sent forcese in to take food from homes and directly caused the death of at least 4 million ukrainians ?
