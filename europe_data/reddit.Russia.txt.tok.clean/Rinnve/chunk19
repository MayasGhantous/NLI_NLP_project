  that 's not what had happened . 
  well , not exactly . 
  and it most certainly was not aimed at ukrainians : 7.5 mil deaths you 've mentioned is * total * number of deaths : ukrainians , russians and kazakhs . 
  so yeah , soviets and stalin did n't really cared people when they forced industrialization and collectivization . 
  however , it relates to modern russia no more than hitler relates to modern germany . 
  may be that too . 
  you start with sorting people by their nationality , and then it all goes downhill . 
  and that 's because ... ? 
  i wonder if somebody thought the same about bolsheviks or nsdap ... 
  may be . 
  but it turned out so that all poles were unwanted , women and children included . 
   it is so clear that ex president was putins puppet it is actually not so clear . 
  yanukovich was all promises and little real action , as far as i know , puppets do n't behave like that . 
  ( not to say that he was not a criminal thung ... * real * criminal thug ) . 
   he has to act as gorilla again , as far as i know , all this crimean thing is being done quite carefully . 
   do you really think that west would support new ukrainian regime if it would be going around and killing russians ? 
  as if that can not be done without west support . 
   putin is the one who was supporting totally corrupt president putin is supporing him ? 
  how exactly ? 
  and all that is not really important . 
  bandera has no place at all in kiev 's city hall . 
  it 's like placing hitler 's image in reichstag because , well , he was very pro-german !, 
  joining nazis against soviets is one thing . 
  that i can at least understand . 
  inhumane torture and mass killings of non-combatants including women and children is completely another thing . 
  that one can not be forgiven under any circumstances . 
  the point is that any party or movement that praises bandera as a hero is fishy at best . 
  add to that known nazi symbolics and slogans , and picture becomes pretty clear . 
  mentioning holodomor or any other soviet failure is merely a evading maneuver . 
  of course not all maidan protesters are neo-nazi who even may be a minority . 
  but lets not forget that there are historical examples of minor parties suddenly taking a whole lot of power . 
  genociding non-combatants ( not even soviets the case of poles ) is fighting soviets now ? 
  blame soviet industrialization and collectivisation policy , not russians . 
  millions of russians died in that famine too . 
  ) ] ( http://histans.com/liberua/book/upa/2.pdf ) ) i 'm not very good with ukrainian , but it is close enough to russian to understand that this is about `` liquidation '' jews , poles and russians ( `` hostile nationalities '' ), 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia controversial indeed . 
   can you even compare percentage wise what damage was done ? 
  actually , i can . 
  more than 60 % of gulag prisoners were russians . 
  anti-kulak policy was applied to russians peasants just as well as to non-russian , and since there were more russian peasants , good half of `` kulaks '' where russian too . 
   the proportion of non-russian population declined while russian increased ( 1926-1959 78.1 % -83.3 % ) wait , where is your data coming from again ? 
  percentage of russian population in ussr declined from 58 % in 1939 to 54 % in 1959 to 50 % in 1989 . 
  it ca n't decline in ussr and in the same time increase * both * in rsfsr * and * other ssrs . 
   but is n't it suspicious that absolute majority of casualties were ethnic minorities according to data at hand , caualties were about 3-4 mln ukraininans , 1.5-2 mln russians and ~ 1 mln kazakhs . 
  that 's not `` absolute majority '' . 
  that 's not `` did not suffer a lot from it '' . 
  what * is * suspicious is that nobody notices now other famines of that time that affected russians . 
  how about povolzhye that lost about 5mln russians only decade before `` holodomor '' * and * suffered during 193x famine too ? 
  how about numerous famines during russian empire times ? 
  how comes that 5 mln dead ukrainians is certainly a genocide , but 5 mln dead russians is not ? 
  and it is not about who suffered more . 
  it is about altering history , rewriting it . 
  trasforming soviets that destroyed agriculture with premature policies to russians genociding national minorities . 
   yes , blame the peasants , because they were so stupid that caused their own starvation to death destroing crops and killing cattle is a historical fact . 
   as there are tons of documents proving otherwise well , show me something . 
   actually , there are documents and even living memories that proves hostile activities of soviets . 
  there were `` hostile activities of soviets '' all amongts ussr . 
  all peasants suffered collectivisation , all somewhat wealthy ( `` kulaks '' ) suffered even more . 
  are there any documents that prove targeting ukraininans because of their nationality , not because ukraine has good agricultural conditions and there were more wealthy peasants ? 
   7 mln . 
  is the most common quoted number . 
  according to [ s.g. wheatcroft ] ( http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/academic/harrison/reviews/davies-wheatcroft2004.pdf ) , `` number of famine deaths in 1932-1933 is 5.5 to 6.5 millions [ ... ] the main cause of the famine was that under the first five-year plan the state placed excessive pressure on agricultural resources and the rural population . 
  [ ... ] conquest and others have claimed that in 1932 stalin intended to punish their resistance to his rule by starving millions of ukrainians to death . 
  were this true , it would justify classification of the famine as an act of genocide . 
  the evidence provided by davies and wheatcroft does not support this story , however . '', 
   oh well , you could provide me with 1944 paper or some not clear article that covers specific part 1/4 of soviet era . 
  i do n't think that date alone can discredit data . 
  for wider coverage i 've provided you with obvious source : a wikipedia article with loads of links to other resourses . 
  if you think that there is one neat paper that covers almost a century of history of largest state in the world , well , that 's just not possible . 
   i listed you quite a few nations that were repressed , you totally ignored that . 
  you forgot to list one nation that was repressed too - * russians * . 
  if you add that to your list , you can easily see that * all * nations in ussr were repressed . 
   i noted that russian population suspiciously increased by 10 or 20 percent in couple decades `` ukraine ( 1929-1989 from 9.2 % to 22.1 % ) , estonia ( 1934-1989 8.2-30 .4 ) , latvia ( 1935-1989 10.6-34 .0 ) , '' better half of a century is couple decades now ? 
  not to mention that you did not noted how non-russian population changed in rsfsr during that time . 
   i mention holodomor were ~ 7 mln people died , you could argue that either it was unintentional or something , but you say it is a myth like it would be so easy to fake a death of so many people . 
  `` ukraininan holodomor '' is a myth . 
  it was not ukrainian because that terrible famine affected almost all ussr areas to some extent , and some other areas ( namely kazakhstan and povolzhye ) suffered just as bad . 
  it was not `` holodomor '' ( `` hunger-killing '' ) because it was not intended to kill off ukrainians ; it was not intended at all , actually . 
  it was a consequence of several factors : drought , bad planning , collectivisation efforts and peasants resisting it ( often by burning crops and slaughtering cattle just to prevent communists from making it public property ) . 
  soviet government actually helped ukraine ( amongst other regions ) to overcome it , there are tons of archive documents proving it . 
  so , `` ukraininan holodomor '' as a planned genocide is a myth . 
  oh , and 7mln people is a gross exaggeration . 
  it was bad enough , there is no need to double or triple death count . 
  good luck living on in black-white fantasy world . 
  go educate yourself already . 
  `` ukriainian holodomor '' is a myth . 
  real history is much more complex . 
   also , could you explain please how relatively fast in so many soviet republics russian population increased massively if there were no active russification ? 
  promoting russian language as a basis for international cooperation inside ussr and forsing russian language/culture while oppresing and eventually erasing national ones are two completely different things . 
  `` during the great patriotic war in the 1940s '', 
   at the expense of local culture proof ? 
  why not cite completely ? 
  `` ( mostly towards those with cross-border ethnic ties to foreign nation-states in the 1930s or compromised in the view of stalin during the great patriotic war in the 1940s ) , although nation-building often continued simultaneously for others . '' this changes it a little bit , do n't it ? 
  that 's not a nationalism , that 's glue language . 
  is it too hard for you ? 
  educate yourself with wikipedia then : http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_delimitation_in_the_soviet_union, 
  from what i know , saudi arabians live quite a luxurious life . 
  that does not make their government effective or ethical . 
  well , effective , may be . 
  certainly not ethical by western standards .
