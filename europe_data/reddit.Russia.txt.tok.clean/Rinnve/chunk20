  the law does not mention russian language specifically , only ` regional languages ' that are used by more than 10 % of population . 
  italy . 
  are you a victim of englification or something ? 
  you use english quite well , were you forced to learn it ? 
  it would be nice to see an example of said ` russian nationalism ' in ussr . 
  not moscow 's , not russian . 
  soviet . 
  it was intended as international ideology from the start . 
  there was this state where people wanted to kill all jews , if you know what i mean . 
  you kinda killed the whole message with the last sentence . 
  overgeneralizing much ? 
  dissidents and censorship are not related to development of local languages and cultures . 
  it was russocentric from the start in the sense that russian culture and people served as a `` glue '' of sorts . 
  but then there were efforts to preserve and develop local culture awareness ; it was sometimes even a food for jokes when the government promoted writers who were `` good '' only because they used their local language . 
   was n't the russian language forced upon the ukrainians during soviet times ? 
  during imperial times , actually . 
  law that limited use of malorossian ( `` small-russian '' ) dialect was lifted in 1905 . 
  there was no russian language enforcement during soviet times , quite the contrary : soviets promoted development of local culture ( in all ssrs , not only in ukraine ) . 
  sad thing is that extremist skinheads can and will touch pro-gay tourists , very violently so . 
  russia and russian government is not exactly `` against homosexuals '' . 
  most common point of view here is that a ) it is completely ok to do whatever you want to do with your personal life unless you `` wave it around '' , so to speak ; but b ) it is not ok to consider homosexual pairs as equal to traditional heterosexual ones ( think `` marriage '' and `` child adoption '' ) . 
  and that 's all . 
  also , nobody is diverting public attention with that problem ; it is rather bloated by western media ( well , at least english-speaking one ) . 
   someone who speaks russian , is this being presented as something already true or as `` whatever next ? '', 
  speculation ? 
  neither , apparently . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/2xqnus/russia_1_shows_hitler_on_1000_hryvna_note_%d0%bb%d0%be%d0%bb/cp2j8tm ) , it 's about people how mock new proposal about putting bandera on new banknotes ( and if you do n't know who 's that , stepan bandera was the leader of [ those nice guys ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) ) . 
   russia has threatened to review the declaration of independence of the baltic countries stop read the media source that told you this . 
  * one russian deputy * requested russian prosecutors to do this . 
  they responded to the press in the sense that they are obliged to process all requests , however strange , and the outcome in this particular case is very obvious . 
  it 's not like having mentally challenged politicians is an unique privilege of russia . 
  those regions were ethnically ukrainian/belorussian . 
  if you mean that they belonged to poland , well ... poland itself belonged to russia , so i 'd be careful with that kind of argument . 
  so why you 're so butthurt about soviets retaking ukrainian and belorussian territories `` stolen '' by poland in 1921 ? 
  do n't argue with / u/maltybeverage , arguing with a brick wall is more pleasant . 
  just look up his posting history . 
   besides , the thing you quoted does n't even convert consistently between rubles and dollars ? 
  wtf ? 
  that 's the moscow times for you . 
  careful , correct journalism is n't their strong side . 
   even at 12 % it 's double what is comfortable . 
  yes , of course , it 's not particularly comfortable , but it 's also not like russia going to crumble if oil goes down even more or keeps at the current level for some prolonged period . 
   where do you get this figure ? 
  [ oil ] ( http://www.cbr.ru/statistics/print.aspx?file=credit_statistics/crude_oil.htm ) and [ gas ] ( http://www.cbr.ru/statistics/credit_statistics/print.aspx?file=gas.htm ) exports ( ~ ~ second ~ ~ third column is millions of usd ) . 
  gdp you can look up , just divide one by other , it 's simple . 
  sudetenland medal is just a little bit less neutral . 
  just a little bit . 
  by the way , do n't you find interesting the fact that nobody told that yeltsin was `` reinstating the memory of the soviet union '' when he established hero of the russian federation ( which is the same to hero of the soviet union as hero of labour of the russian federation is to hero of socialist labour ) ? 
  that 's because it has nothing to do with actually `` reinstating bla bla bla '' and everything to do with the current position of the majority of western media which basically interprets each putin 's fart as an attempt at something stalin - or hitler-related . 
  this is not `` political establishment '' . 
  this is political freaks . 
  ( last image is [ shopped ] ( http://blog.fontanka.ru/posts/138424/ ) btw . ), 
  yeah . 
  and if i ask about some , you know , * evidence * , we have nice dank memes for that , am i right ? 
  who needs the facts anyway . 
  lots of things disappeared after the fall of the soviet union , and not all of them were bad . 
  this award is quite neutral , there is nothing `` stalinist '' about it . 
  what . 
  `` it was invented during stalin 's rule , hence it must be bad . '', 
  perfect logic . 
   because there is a narrative of the establishment that is simultaniusly `` ultra orthodox '' and reinstating the memmory of the soviet union . 
  this narrative exists mostly in the western ~ ~ propaganda ~ ~ media . 
  also , how exactly celebrating the may day is `` reinstating the memory of the soviet union '' ? 
  why is it so diffucult to comprehend that there are different people in russia doing different things ? 
  in 2013 , about 9 % for oil and about 3 % for gas . 
  not one item . 
  ~ 20 % is all mineral exports combined , not only oil and gas . 
  i do n't follow your logic . 
   your economy is still massively dependant on oil and gas . 
  wrong , oil/gas/other minerals are like 20 % of russian gdp . 
  it 's important part , but it 's not like one american politician said , that `` russia is a gas station in disguise '' . 
   you randomly start wars and make enemies when you should be using your current wealth to improve your economy . 
  there is absolutely nothing random about crimea . 
  donbass events were started by ukrainian government ( who did exactly what the previous president was asked not to do , that is to use the army against his own population ) . 
  just open those two maps and compare the scale . 
  it 's that simple . 
  you mean [ this canada ] ( http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/as-sa/97-550/vignettes/img/map-2006-pop-density-canada-sz01-en.gif ) ? 
  [ russia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/russia's_population_density_by_region.jpg/1280px-russia's_population_density_by_region.jpg ) has distant populated regions that have to be connected somehow . 
  why ? 
  russia might be big , but there are tons of downsides to this , starting with the need to maintain enormous infrastructure in a rather extreme climate . 
   they could have used all the oil revenue to finance innovation , research , entrepreneurship , massive infrastructure . 
  done . 
   they could design , manufacture and export cars , phones , computers , software , etc. . . russia 's exports in 2013 * without any minerals * is bigger than russia 's * total * exports in 1999 . 
  wtf video of the week , definitely . 
  yes , obviously . 
  careful , do n't cut yourself with that edge of yours . 
  [ eh ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/powell-anthrax-vial.jpg ), 
  we 're talking about an article in russian . 
  they have n't used the english word `` probably '' , that 's my translation . 
  however , [ apparently ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2015/09/21/tefft/ ) that 's not the original version of the article , and in the original version they actually did what / u/mogerroor said they did . 
  that 's much better . 
  you should 've started with this . 
   classic russian propaganda backpedalling and then trying to catch others on details . 
  as if it 's exclusive to russian media . 
  the title , may be . 
  the rest of the article , hell no . 
  too many `` allegedly '' and `` probably '' , and the quotes around tefft `` appearance '' . 
   following pagraph is designed to lead the reader to the conclusion that the photo is most likely real no , it 's not designed that way . 
  they do n't quote tefft at all , they say what he allegedly answered ( yes , with the word `` allegedly '' ) .
