  as can be seen from the comments under the article , no reader believed that the photo and tefft 's `` answer '' are true . 
   they said `` it is unknown '' if photo is real . 
  that equivalent to `` it 's probably fake '' , only without manipulating the reader . 
   `` there is info on the web by somebody who is claiming to have asked ambassador as to why did he come to the rally and tefft ** allegedly ** answered that he came to observe progress of democracy in russia and to evaluate its scale '' here , you missed a word . 
  yes , it is an important word . 
  no , i 'm `` trying to imply '' that shopping an image and then reporting it as true ( in other words , lying ) is different from reporting about image and telling that it 's probably fake . 
  the former is what / u/mogerroor said had happened , the latter is what actually happened . 
   to people who posted it on ren tv it should have been fucking obvious that this is photoshoped . 
  why ? 
  for me , it is n't obvious ; there is something `` off '' about this photo , but i 've seen many photos with that `` off '' feeling that were n't in fact shopped . 
  but my main point is that you `` forgot '' to mention that rentv mentioned that the photo is probably fake . 
  you formulated it like they just lied , which they did n't . 
  well , i do n't know about the current situation , but soviet army definitely did this to their own soldiers in afghanistan ( not always of course ; it depended on the commander ) . 
  in chechen wars , soldiers sometimes also had major troubles with getting extra money for participating in combat situations . 
  you obviously have trouble with comprehending the difference between shopping an image and reporting about shopped image that appeared in social networks . 
  your reading comprehension is unbelievably bad . 
  no , no , it 's not that . 
  it 's the soldiers are told to get their things and go to afghanistan/ukraine/siria , and when they return , they discover that no , there were no any orders , they have n't been sent anywhere , they were n't in combat , and the army would n't pay extra for their work because there was n't any work done . 
  and , of course , the relatives of the killed ones can forget about compensations because those soldiers were killed in their free time , not in service . 
   i 'm sick of russian twisting of truth that 's rich , coming from one who just did exactly this . 
  `` one of the largest tv stations '' stated that image is from social networks and could probably be photoshopped ; the word `` appeared '' in the phrase '' ... ambassador `` appeared '' at the event ... '' is in quotes . 
  why do you lie ? 
  edit : apparently , rentv [ first published a lie ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2015/09/21/tefft/ ) and then changed it to a report about `` social media rumor '' . 
  if [ the original article ] ( http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2015/09/16_a_7760297.shtml ) is correct , soldiers are objecting because there * was n't * any official order . 
  russian ( soviet back then ) army pulled same shit in afghanistan , when soldiers were told to do this or that , and later they discovered that officially there were no orders and they `` just happened to do this '' on their own . 
   then again putin put a 100 year ban on any gay pride parade in moscow . 
  not putin . 
  it may surprise somebody , but putin does n't have 100 % mind control over russians . 
  unless you stop this `` putin did this , putin did that '' attitude , you have exactly zero chance of understanding what 's happening in russia . 
  ( there are quite unpleasant trends here , but it 's just maddening how outside people ca n't get it and just buy western * and * russian propaganda . 
  yes , both of them . ), 
  those soldiers do n't want to go to syria because the paperwork was n't done properly and in the case some of them is killed or captured , they legally `` do n't exist '' and could be just written off ( of course , if the story is true ) . 
   if you do n't want to participate in real war then why you sign contract ? 
  you forgot to mention that those soldiers do n't want to go to syria not because they are afraid or something like that , but because the paperwork was n't done properly and in the case some of them is killed or captured , they legally `` do n't exist '' and glorious russian army can just write them off . 
  eh , it 's related to occupation . 
  same in russian , '' \u041a\u0443\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0446\u043e\u0432 '' originally meant '' \u041a\u0443\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0446\u043e\u0432 [ \u0441\u044b\u043d ] '' ( smith 's son ) ; most other `` occupational '' surnames in russian are also like this . 
  some orthodox priests can marry ( do n't know the rules though ) . 
  the what ? 
  yes , it 's hard to implement . 
  it is also very popular and [ widely supported . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_software_that_supports_office_open_xml ), 
  if you want to remember this , you should also remember that those territories were `` a part of poland '' since about 1922 when poland annexed parts of ukraine and belarus . 
  microsoft format is [ an open specification ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/office_open_xml ) as well since office 2007 . 
  self-evident ? 
  `` according to unnamed sources '' , `` one reason might be '' ... 
  evidence and this article could n't be any further from each other . 
   not only has this sort of thing happened before ( just about a year ago with lenta ) , and not only did kommersant later censor parts of the navalny interview , but the fact that it was pushed by the legal department clearly indicates that he was forced out . 
  logic . 
  ever heard of such thing ? 
  how exactly the fact that censoring parts of the navalny interview ( in which parts he insulted president of russia which is illegal ) was pushed by the legal department is related to this `` reshuffling '' or whatever it was in reality ? 
   and one would think that if kommersant had planned this since august , they would have changed konyakhin 's job title by now , would n't they ? 
  no , one should n't think like this . 
  something could be planned for * years * , it means exactly nothing about execution of the plan . 
   `` a lie is not an alternative point of view . '', 
  you should n't call something a lie if you 're not ready to prove it a lie . 
  so let me get this straight : according to you , it is okay to use heavy imprecise weapons in the middle of the city against a non-military target and just write off dead civilians as a collateral damage ? 
  something must be very , very wrong with you . 
   your link also mentions three unnamed sources unnamed sources are n't trustworthy by definition , so it just as well could be three billion unnamed source : the numbers do not increase credibility in this case . 
   by that logic , all of the media ( be it western , russian , american , asain , african , or otherwise ) is engaging in classic propaganda moves almost constantly . 
  yep . 
  that 's why it 's important to check different sources , and that 's why it seems ... fishy when people on social networks post one-sided information ( like this time when / u/cwanik did n't mention russian articles with another possible explanation of the situation ) . 
   according to this and russian-language articles , his dismissal came upon the recommendation of the legal department for fears of running afoul of russian censorship laws . 
  and according to other [ russian-language articles ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/17/09/2015/55faa2fd9a79472e59ce2c48 ) , this has nothing to do with the interview and was planned since august . 
  also , according to this article he was n't fired , he was moved to another position . 
  providing one-sided information is a classic propaganda move . 
  [ you must be blind then . 
  ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/03/world/europe/ukraine-luhansk-building-attack/ ), 
  this is something called `` freedom of speech '' . 
   that 's a ridiculous excuse , you have more people to pay for that infrastructure as well and most of your population is concentrated in the west part of russia . 
  wrong . 
  significant part of russian population lives beyond ural mountains ; not the majority , but that does n't mean that we should n't maintain infrastructure that connects russia . 
  oil , gas and other products also do n't just jump magically to the western border . 
   how do regions with harsh climate cost money ? 
  it 's not like almost anyone lives there anyway . 
  under 1 % percent of total population may seem insignificant for tiny countries , but for russia it 's still millions of people . 
  should we just abandon infrastructure there and allow them to freeze to death ? 
   i would bet our infrastructure costs are higher per capita . 
  personally , i prefer fact checking to betting . 
  i do n't have the numbers though , but i very much doubt that this is true , considering estonia 's size , terrain relief and relatively mild climate . 
   the entirety of ussr debt has been paid as of 2006 . 
  so what ? 
  it 's not like it was n't a burden before that point . 
   110 people holding 35 % of the wealth in russia is normal ? 
  where did i say that ? 
  my point is that there is no scientific basis under this `` billionaire counting '' methodology . 
  gini indices calculated by different entities ( link in previous message ) all show that while inequality in russia is present , it 's far from being number 1 in the world . 
   in russia they got there by being buddies with putin and using resources that should belong to the russian people to line their own pockets . 
  i very much doubt that [ all those people ] ( http://www.forbes.ru/rating/200-bogateishikh-biznesmenov-rossii-2015/2015 ) got their billions just by being buddies with putin . 
  most of them started off much earlier than putin became president , and many of them are n't even in the minerals business . 
   yet we have no oil or any resources to sell , still wealthier per capita than russia . 
  you also do n't have some other things like , for instance , absolutely massive infrastructure that needs maintenance , several regions with harsh climate , islamist terrorists sponsored by saudis and all the foreign debt of the ussr . 
   the biggest wealth inequality in the world there are [ scientific methods of measuring inequality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality ) , and then there is ... this . 
  counting billionaires , seriously ? 
   but putin has nothing to do with it , it 's just oil and gas money . 
  in 2013 , russian exports without oil/gas were larger than total russian exports pre-2000 . 
   if anything they 'd be much better off without putin and co putting a lot of that gas money into their pockets . 
  actually , regular people see much more of the oil/gas money ( in form of the taxes ) than they did before putin . 
   it 's not putin that grew russian economy , it 's oil and gas prices . 
  wrong . 
  [ russian export volume * without minerals ( oil/gas/etc ) * in 2013 is larger than russian * total * export volume in 1999 .
