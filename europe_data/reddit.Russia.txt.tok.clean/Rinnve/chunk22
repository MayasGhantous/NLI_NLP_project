   will probably shoot you if you start a riot russian police is n't particularly trigger-happy ( mostly because each shot means major paperwork ) . 
  certain amount of rubber baton treatment in the case of a riot is pretty much guaranteed , though . 
  well , there is that `` pshe pshe '' thing and the whole polish-russian history clusterfuck , but there is also [ this . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whevbws-md4 ) puts me to sleep super gently every single time . 
  for the record , i do n't have a slightest idea what 's she talking about except some basic words and phrases , but it 's super cute . 
  polish seems to be a perfect cute hit between full incomprehension and full understanding , and i would n't mind to shift this to the right . 
  also , you have very badass metal scene . 
  what the fuck ? 
  this ca n't be true . 
  40 euro for a one person pizza is beyond anything reasonable . 
  [ the language , though . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk ), 
  eh , original poll was about `` what countries would n't you mind living in ? '', 
  poland culture and polish language actually seem pretty cool for me , so yeah , i for one certainly would n't mind living there . 
  they use dictionary approach : stress mark on the first encounter of the word . 
   why does russia have the unique honor among nations of never being responsible for its own actions ? 
   us flair `` unique '' . 
   \u041f\u0438\u0301\u0432\u043e stress mark is only used in books for kids and in dictionaries , if that 's what you mean . 
   would n't recommend worstonia reminded me of [ this gem . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1m-7_ghfd4 ), 
   the `` ukrainian threat '' created and propagated by russia the what ? 
  russians , ukrainians , crimean tatars , in descending order . 
  you can dream all day long , but that would n't change the facts . 
   crimeans no such thing . 
  well , [dictionary.com says it is , ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/russki ) thefreedictionary [ agrees . 
  ] ( http://www.thefreedictionary.com/russkies ) english sometimes can be strange . 
  i was quite surprised when i found out that it is considered offencive word . 
  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/russki edit : i have no idea how it became derogatory in english , but it apparently is . 
   ah , the beauty of central planning . 
  regulated market economy , actually . 
  that 's a couple of difficult to answer questions because the only correct answer is `` it depends '' . 
  russia is very big . 
  in st.petersburg or moscow , probably nobody would care enough about are you gay or not . 
  in some backwater town in the middle of nowhere , coming out probably would be not a very good idea . 
  government does n't have any coherent policy aboud gays ; that does n't mean that one ca n't be punished in some form for just being gay . 
  for instance , there were cases of teachers being fired after coming out , but that 's not because of some `` central policy '' or `` putin oppressing gays '' , that 's because some bureaucrat did it `` just in case '' , fearing for possible wrath of his superiors . 
  it is sad that just seeing russian flair strips you of the ability to communicate like a decent human being . 
  or you 're always this retarded ? 
   you also need a source on how gravity exists yes i do , and you should too . 
  thing is , there are credible sources on basically everything that exists under the sun , gravity included . 
  angry silent downvotes suggest that the statement `` russian government does n't cares about anti-gay violence '' is hard to back properly . 
   whereas the russian government has embarked on a policy of constantly stepping down on the rights of gays constantly ? 
   in addition to not giving two fucks about anti-gay violence some credible source is required . 
   allegedly rockets from an attack heli why not tactical nuke while you 're at it ? 
  it 's much calmer now , but [ not completely calm . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:islamic_terrorism_in_russia ), 
  also , almost forgot ( not my specialty by far ) saratov medical university . 
  it is considered amongst the best in the field , and is very much respected . 
  novosibirsk university town is very well known and respected in hi-tech context . 
  kazan also is quite respectable . 
  it 's not about being a default party . 
  it 's about ultra nationalists having access to the military-grade weapons and intimidating people . 
  recent events in kiev show that it 's not something kremlin-invented propaganda . 
  actually , the whole message from kremlin was that using neo-nazis ( which was blown out of proportion to `` nazi junta '' meme ) is going to backfire . 
  i hope that current ukrainian government will be able to contain the situation , that it 's not too serious to turn ukraine to another iraq . 
  [ you 'd be surprised . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dark_world_\\ ( 2010_film \\ ) ) ), 
  perhaps [ msu ] ( http://www.msu.ru/en/ ) . 
   oh , they are n't even in parliament ? 
   they are some nsdap-style far-reaching party that de-facto rules in many regions of ukraine are you aware that one thing does n't contradict another ? 
   countries where is democracy , human rights  us us is actually [ oligarchy ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746 ) , not democracy . 
   for them wwii started in june 1941 . 
  wrong . 
  great patriotic war started in 1941 , wwii started in 1939 . 
  wrong too . 
  wwii is wwii , gpw is gpw . 
   stalin deliberately and knowingly exterminated nearly 10 million ukrainians you 've been reading too much propaganda . 
  try some [ science ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-years-hunger-agriculture-industrialization/dp/0333311078 ) for a change . 
  [ motorola v100 ] ( http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_v_box\\ ( v100 \\ ) -224 . php ) . 
  it even had internet access !, 
  edit : by the way , voice recognition in older motorola phones is unbelievably good . 
  i do n't think i 've used it with this v100 , but my dad still uses his [ razr v3 ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/motorola_razr_v3 ) because its voice recognition works flawlessly even on a loudest street , and no modern smartphones can do it this good . 
  okay . 
  any major western media , media that have influence . 
  bbc , cnn , something on that level . 
   including rt western . 
  as in , owned by western owners . 
   we have freedom of press . 
  it 's in our laws , in our constitutions . 
  you guys just do n't , and most do n't seem to care . 
  it 's in our laws and in our constitution too . 
  too bad freedom of press does n't prevent pushing propaganda , and now you think that there is no freedom in russia , that putin is a dictator with absolute power , that russia attacked georgia in 2008 , things like that . 
  i can find a ton of similar examples of western media lying about russia . 
  like , you know , recent forbes article about `` 2000 dead russian soldiers '' . 
  should i expect forbes , bbc , rferl and others to be censored too ? 
  something tells me that i should not . 
   eh i dont have time to deal with you right now yeah , of course you do n't . 
  it would take an eternity to provide examples of something that does n't really exist . 
  nothing from your list could qualify as `` undermining the very essence of this country 's creation '' . 
  could you please provide some examples of `` propaganda that constantly is undermining the very essence of this country 's creation '' ? 
  so the latvian government decided not to let rt in because it 's propaganda , but why it allows other kinds of propaganda ? 
  is n't it double standards ? 
   like try to find something good about baltic states in russiatoday channel , go on , i dare you ... you wont . 
  try to find something good about russia in * any * western media . 
  eh , that depends . 
  at a some big-ass celebration like wedding , yeah , all that . 
  in a small company of friends '' \u0422\u0432\u043e\u0451 \u0437\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435 ! '', 
  ( cheers basically ) is enough . 
   it 's the only private gulag museum , so do n't discredit the man .
