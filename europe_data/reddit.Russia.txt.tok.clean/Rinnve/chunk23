  really ? 
  now you 're down to technicalities ? 
  nowere he told about `` only * private * museum '' , and thanks to him , western media painted the picture of the only gulag museum in russia . 
   so tell me again , how are these dissidents remembered there ? 
  as far as i know , the museum is n't reopened yet , so we ca n't know that . 
   because it seems like the state-led museum only speaks of criminals and enemies of the su . 
  what made you think so ? 
  no , it 's for the groom only , as far as i know . 
  thankfully , i never were at * those * kind of weddings . 
  my eyes are bleeding now . 
  well , it probably un-tastes . 
  cognac or rum mask it , but vodka is clear alcohol . 
  ( some say there are good expensive vodkas with a nice subtle taste , but i 'm not willing to experiment when for a lesser price you can get nice rum . 
  or even better , nice wine . 
  i guess i 'm just not the strong beverages guy . ), 
  at least university students are the same all across the europe it seems . 
  i ca n't stand the taste of vodka because of that . 
  cognac , rum , whiskey , that 's fine . 
  vodka ? 
  the memories start to kick in , and what memories are those !, 
  i still ca n't believe i could be this stupid . 
  are you sure they were n't russians ? 
  because that sounds very much like typical russian behavior . 
  actually , i thought that this retarded ritual of drinking from the shoe was exclusively russian . 
  edit : missed `` his '' in `` his shoe '' . 
  that 's new one . 
  it should be the bride 's shoe . 
  wow . 
  what a strange mix of really funny and really depressing . 
   this classic comedy sketch that 's a pretty grim ending for a `` comedy '' . 
  what makes you think that ? 
  the words of the former director ? 
  well , do n't know about you , but i do n't trust a single word if the guy lies about very basic things , like perm-36 being the only gulag museum in russia . 
   all i can see is never ending circlejerk about how stalin was cool , how we survived because of stalin , etc , etc. 
  may be try to look in different places ? 
  because , you know , you kind of can get this impression that most europeans hate russian guts just by lurking in / r/europe long enough , but that does n't mean that all europeans are like that . 
  well , at least i hope so . 
   you will find all kinds of people in a prison , not just heroes . 
  and that was the problem with perm-36 : they were portraying * all * inmates as a heroes , just because they were inmates . 
   russia wants its people to think that these were all criminals , and this is despicable . 
  i 've already linked [ this document . 
  ] ( http://government.ru/media/files/ar59e5d7yb9lddoph2rslhqpscqderdp.pdf ) it does n't gets any more official than that . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_insurgent_army#ethnic_cleansing_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_galicia ), 
   okay , the only ( ! ), 
  gulag museum in russia it 's not the only gulag museum in russia , nor it 's [ the biggest one . 
  ] ( http://www.gmig.ru/ )  now it is no longer about the fate of political prisoners , but now they are called `` enemies of the soviet union '' . 
  or , from the other point of view , ukrainian and baltic nazi collaborators ( who were held in perm-36 ) are no longer portrayed as `` fighters for the freedom of enslaved people '' . 
   yes , there is absolutely no increase in totalitarian tendencies in russia . 
  yeah , that 's why russian government recently approved [ `` the concept for perpetuating the memory of victims of political repressions '' ] ( http://government.ru/media/files/ar59e5d7yb9lddoph2rslhqpscqderdp.pdf ) which states that `` russia can not fully become a law-governed state and take a leading role in the international community without perpetuating the memory of millions of its citizens who were victims of political repression '' and that `` unacceptable are continuing attempts to justify the repressions as features of the [ historical ] time or even deny them as a fact of history '' . 
  contrary to stereotypes , drinking on ( almost ) daily basis is looked down upon to in russia . 
  if you drink * vodka * daily , you 're fucking alcoholic , scum and lowlife . 
  ( no , most people do n't think alcoholism is a disorder to be cured , it 's considered something like a bad habit : if you 're alcoholic , you 're weak ~ ~ , your bloodline is weak and you will not survive the winter ~ ~ . ), 
  officially , all kinds of alcohol are 18 + , but it 's quite often for parents to introduce their kids to alcohol since about 16 . 
  nobody will sell you alcohol in a bar or in a store without checking id if you 're looking young ( well , at least it 's so where i live ) . 
  for celebrations , vodka it is , but also cognac ( a bottle of good cognac is very common `` manly '' gift ) and wine ( mostly for women ) . 
  for casual occasions , beer . 
  lots of beer . 
  but you got ta have an occasion for drinking , because if you do n't , you 're an alcoholic . 
   gulag museums have to close , but stalin posters are paraded again . 
  nope and nope . 
  no gulag museums had to close , and stalin posters are n't `` paraded '' , at least en masse ( some communists can do that , but that 's it ) . 
  about ukraine , there is no single predominant opinion . 
  crimea , that people mostly support : many russians thought that ukraine `` stole '' crimea after the dissolution of the ussr . 
  eastern ukraine , here you can find all kinds of opinions , from `` putin should send the army there '' to `` this is a mess and we should stay out of it '' . 
  almost nobody thinks though that current ukrainian course will do them any good . 
   just walk around russian gift shops , check the daily media . 
  anti-eu/usa/nato / west stuff is everywhere already preparing the mentality of the local population for a war . 
  could you please show us a couple of examples ? 
  and no , some fringe publications do not qualify . 
  well , i suppose you can find a couple believers in the `` evil west '' if you try hard enough . 
  you can also find believers in the reptilian overlords or something , it does n't mean anything really . 
  the fact is , most people in the world think what their media tells them to think , and russian media does * not * tell that current economic situation is because of `` west attacking russia '' . 
  actually no , i live in a small city in mostly agrarian region . 
  people around me do n't speak english ( much ) , and get their information from tv and russian-speaking internet sites . 
  contrary to what western media tries to portray , people here do not think that the west `` attacks '' russia , or something like that ( although they do think that us should mind their own business ) . 
  russian ~ ~ propaganda ~ ~ media also portray western sanctions as something pathetic and not working . 
  that is , if they even bother to mention sanctions at all . 
  oil situation , on the other hand ... 
  it 's everywhere , together with falling ruble . 
  as of late , also china , our new best friend . 
   most russians still blame the west because ... because ... some poll says so , i guess ? 
  what is the source , and how credible it is ? 
   experts say the kremlin has been largely successful in convincing russians that much of their economic pain is a result of western `` enemy action '' rather than bad domestic policies . 
  some anonymous `` experts '' say so , it must be true !, 
  seriously , though , i do n't know * anybody * who does `` blame west '' . 
  and in every single article in english it 's mighty western sanctions ^ and ^ also ^ oil ^ prices - when actually it 's ... you know ... kind of other way around . 
   anything that putin supporter says sounds absurd for most europeans . 
  if you 're calling me `` putin supporter '' , you ca n't be more wrong . 
  that does n't mean though that i will tolerate anti-russian bullshit . 
  ( or any bullshit for that matter . ), 
   russians are brainwashed ( not all ) to believe that ukraine stuff has no russian involvement and russia is unfairly attacked by eu , usa and even by chechens . 
  that 's what western media told you ? 
  actually , i do n't think there is one russian who thinks that russia is n't involved in ukrainian conflict . 
  sending troops in tens of thousands , though ? 
  that 's ridiculous on so many levels i do n't even know where to start . 
  or better yet , visit [ the source site . 
  ] ( http://bs-life.ru/ ) name one reason to trust * anything * that is published on some anonymous site which main purpose seems to be showing big-ass ads in the center of the screen . 
  more like `` filthy ukrainian lies '' . 
  there may or may not be some russian soldiers in ukraine ( i mean actual soldiers , not ex-something ) , but the source of information for this particular article is laughable . 
  it 's some anonymous advertisement machine / `` news site '' that probably could publish anything for like $ 100 .
