  can you even think logically ? 
  putin makes it serious criminal offence to publish troop losses , and then some unknown news site / advertisement machine just goes ahead and commits said criminal offence . 
  by mistake . 
  can you honestly imagine the chain of events that could lead to that ? 
  because i ca n't . 
   the artical was cut , because of putin 's regime i wonder if you actually believe your own words . 
  `` putin 's regime '' . 
  most probably it 's fake . 
  there is nothing about `` casualties in ukraine '' , and time mark of the content is `` 24 \u0430\u0432\u0433 2015 03:16:53 gmt '' , 24 august 2015 03:16:53 gmt ; that 's before [ original ukrainian article ] ( http://nr2.com.ua/news/world_and_russia/smi-v-rossii-priznali-chto-poteryali-ubitymi-v-ukraine-2000-voennyh-foto-104529.html ) was published . 
  * edit : a word * * edit2 : * probably it 's not common knowledge , but faking `` internet page screenshot '' is * extremely * simple with little html knowledge and a modern browser 's developer tools . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k1y7wjj.png ) is like 30 seconds of work . 
  * edit3 : * it is actually more interesting than that , and in the same time less interesting . 
  web archive shows the page with the part about `` casualties '' , but the source is anonymous site which main purpose seems to be showing big-ass advertisements . 
  i wonder how much it costs to publish fake stories on that site . 
  probably like $ 100 . 
  they can list any specifications they like . 
  it is clearly stated in the proposal too ( that the restriction is in effect only if there are at least two local offers that meet stated requirements ) . 
  ... provided that there are at least two bids from different russian , belorussian , armenian or kazakh suppliers . 
  somehow `` missed '' this small detail . 
  state regulated market = / = planned economy . 
  actually , most markets in the world are state regulated to some extent . 
   it is what russia is doing . 
  except , as i 've shown , article does n't really report what russia is doing . 
  oh look , / u/maltybeverage at work , posting another anti-russian propaganda piece . 
  the artice : `` under the proposal , state-funded facilities would no longer be allowed to import items such as ventilators , mri scanners , x-ray and ultrasound machines , defibrillators , and incubators for newborns . '' the article as it should be , based on the text of the proposal : `` under the proposal , state-funded facilities would no longer be allowed to import items such as ventilators , mri scanners , x-ray and ultrasound machines , defibrillators , and incubators for newborns , ** provided that there are at least two bids from different russian , belorussian , armenian or kazakh suppliers . 
   why does everyone think that local companies can just produce everything ? 
  nobody thinks . 
  except , obviously , those who trust substandard reporting of bi and the likes . 
  you see , it 's not a ban , it 's a limit , and it applies only if there are at least 2 `` local '' ( russian/belorussian/armenian / kazakh ) offers for some request for equipment . 
  i 'm not sure how to translate it ; basically , a hospital says that it needs this and this , companies publish their offers , and hospital chooses . 
  call for tenders ? 
  anyways . 
  say , hospital requests some equipment and there are less than at least two `` local '' offers , then it is free to accept foreign offers . 
   solzhenitsyn straight up denied it he did n't . 
  he denied that it was a genocide , and that 's legitimate position since , as i 've already said , it is an open discussion among historians too ( and i do n't mean russian historians , of course ) . 
   jelcyn apologized for katy\u0144 , but later putin canceled that wait what ? 
  cancelled that by saying that it is [ `` this crime can not be excused '' ? 
  ] ( http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=351755&amp;cid=549 )  now the official version again seems to be `` germans did this '' nope . 
  the official version was `` it was the crime of stalin 's regime '' , and it never changed since . 
  there was n't any idea of `` starving the ukrainians '' . 
  the whole thing was a massive clusterfuck of mismanagement , miscommunication , bad weather and some other factors . 
  i 'd recommend [ this book ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-years-hunger-agriculture-industrialization/dp/0333311078 ) as a most neutral and comprehensive scientific publication on the subject , if you 're insterested . 
  that 's true for other ussr republics too . 
  however , if you drop the `` most '' , there were significant deportations ( [ one example ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dekulakization ) ) . 
  another example : russian peasants from my home region [ got exclusive soviet treatment in the form of chemical weapons . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tambov_rebellion#timeline ) . 
  as far as i know , that was the only case of such brutality . 
  with that , i hope you could understand why any attempt to shift the blame for soviet crimes on russians as a nation ( as the `` slavers '' vs other `` slave '' nations , as it too often is portrayed ) wo n't be accepted among russians . 
  it is a little bit more complicated than that . 
   sure they did suffer a hell of a lot , but just because a person did something you ordered him to do , but he was of a different nationality , does n't mean that you are not responsible for it . 
  thing is , kremlin never ordered to starve ukrainians or something like that . 
  moreover , when the central government understood what was happening , requirements for grain harvest were lowered significantly , and there were massive help sent in form of food and grain . 
  i 'm not saying that only local authorities are to blame , but to portrait it like `` the reds going from house to house robbing innocent ukrainians '' is as far from the truth as it gets . 
  but this , of course , is too complicated for public consumption . 
  it is far easier to shift all the blame to one certain ethnicity ( `` bad russians starved good ukrainians '' ) than to understand that nobody in particular - and in the same time all the participants - were the source of the disaster . 
  yes , including many ukrainian farmers who 'd rather burn the harvest and kill the cattle than surrender it to `` red thieves '' . 
  it must be nice to live in your black and white world . 
  this guilt trick would n't work with russians , though : whatever soviets did to ukrainians or other nationalities , they did to russians in much larger scale . 
  ukrainian : funny , somewhat childish , archaic . 
  i do n't really understand how one can discuss something serious in ukrainian with a straight face . 
  great for lyrical songs . 
  polish : lots of `` pshe pshe '' with occasional semi-recognizable word or two . 
  would n't call it unpleasant , though , just surprisingly alien for a slavic language . 
  bulgarian , serbian : surprisingly similar to russian , but almost all words , while being comprehensible on their own , are `` wrong '' to some extent and do n't form a coherent meaning . 
  kind of like . 
  german : rough , structured , logical . 
  ca n't really understand how it is possible to discuss something not serious in german . 
  otherwise , sounds okayish . 
  french : ugh . 
  french speakers sound like they have some kind of throat illness that makes them produce all those unpleasant sounds . 
  ca n't stand it ( although i know many russians who like it very much ) . 
  last , but not least : finnish . 
  very beautiful , melodical . 
  i absolutely adore finnish songs . 
  also , creates that strange feeling that i should understand it , but for some reason i do n't . 
  maybe i will fix that some day . 
  `` the reds '' ? 
  you mean , ukrainian communists ? 
  because that 's who collected the grain in ukraine . 
  ( and of course all that `` literal '' part is a little bit exaggerated . 
  juuust a little bit . 
  like , 10x or so . ), 
   i once got interested and decided to read about holodomor . 
  my parents said it probably did n't exist . 
  nearly everybody in russia denies it . 
  but i was shocked to learn it killed an estimated 2.5 -- 7.5 million ukrainians , and was recognized by most countries in the world . 
  found the shill . 
  first , nearly nobody in russia denies it , the only possible discussion is `` was it a genocide ? '', 
  ( and it is an open discussion among serious historians too ) . 
  second , and more important , is that most ( educated ) russians know that not only ukrainians suffered and died in that famine . 
  no way in hell will an honest russian mention `` 2.5 -- 7.5 million ukrainians '' without mentioning other 2-3 million russians who were killed by it . 
  actually , that may be not far from truth . 
  [ russia has long tradition of making things appear better than they really are .

  ... what ? 
  most * marshrutka * ( minibus ) drivers in my city sell tickets too , but full-size bus can get a bit [ overloaded ] ( http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6100/145844502.5/0_83609_a237ad36_xxl ) , i can understand the need for a second person in that case . 
  yep . 
  suv one is somewhat modernized , it 's called `` uaz hunter '' now . 
  that one you 've linked is also produced , marketed under `` classic truck '' label . 
  cheapest truck on the market . 
  it 's called `` free market '' .
