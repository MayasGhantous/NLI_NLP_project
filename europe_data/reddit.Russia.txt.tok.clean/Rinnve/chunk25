  big cities like moscow use automated systems , but for smaller cities its too expensive . 
   they refuse to put the dacia logo on them because they are too proud . 
  that 's not the reason . 
  it 's marketing . 
  lada is owned by renault-nissan ( as is dacia ) , so they make decisions . 
  it 's like dacia logan is marketed in some countries ( including russia ) with renault logo . 
  that must be some badly treated niva , or maybe you confuse it with uaz . 
   treason is illegal in all countries . 
  you 've already explained yourself by equating inconvenient free speech with treason . 
  that 's straight out of stalin 's book . 
  or hitler , or other murderous dictator of your choice . 
  yes , i tend to became hostile to people who support double standards . 
   it does n't matter if the us was behind it 100 % . 
  it was never the intention of the maidan activists to violate ukrainian territorial sovereignty . 
  oh , so foreign-sponsored violence against the state is okay if it does n't involve violating territorial sovereignty ? 
  that 's new . 
   no , but he is expressing support for those that do . 
  that is treason . 
  so free speech is treason now . 
  how interesting . 
  you know , treason is a crime that is clearly defined in a criminal codex of a given country . 
  how about you start to use words properly , without expanding their meaning ? 
   because he was responsible for +100 protestors being killed . 
  how so ? 
  he did not ordered that , it is not even clear who shot them . 
  oh wait , sorry , western media stopped to follow the investigation after the needed dose of propaganda was delivered , so you do n't know that . 
   none of the maidan activists worked with a foreign power to violate the territorial sovereignty of ukraine . 
  i do not know the extent of us involvement , but at least they did show their moral support . 
  on the other hand , did that professor in op 's article worked with foreign power ? 
   he had lost his legitimacy by then anyhow . 
  how so ? 
  because a crowd in kiev told so ? 
  that 's like 0.01 % percent of ukrainian population . 
  are you saying that yanukovich was doing right thing ? 
  sad thing he failed : violent traitors stormed government buildings and forced democratically elected president to flee the country in fear of being gaddafied . 
  considering that danish has ridiculously complicated pronunciation , i would n't be surprised . 
  i mean , 27 vowels , seriously ? 
  itt : repressions are good when people we like do it . 
  how exactly events in ukraine are related to low oil price ? 
  ruble/usd ratio is pretty much tied to it . 
  so `` i think it was fsb '' is proof now ? 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.dw.com/ru/%d1%84%d0%b0%d0%b1%d1%80%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b5-%d1%82%d1%80%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%b9-%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b5%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%bd-%d1%83%d0%b4%d0%b0%d1%80-%d0%bd%d0%b5-%d1%82%d0%be%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%ba%d0%be-%d1%80%d1%83%d0%b1%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%bc/a-18654285 ) , it was savchuk 's own initiative after `` propaganda factory '' repaid her salary : `` \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0443\u0449\u0435\u0440\u0431 \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0443\u043a \u0438 \u0435\u0435 \u0430\u0434\u0432\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 10 \u0442\u044b\u0441\u044f\u0447 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0439 . 
  but after the company also known as the `` factory of the trolls '' repaid her salary and issued appropriate documentation for hiring and dismissal , the plaintiff changed the demand to emphasize that she has no selfish motives . '' ), 
  i 'm * not * saying that it is not `` a big deal '' , but still it is not what was stated by / u/growlingtaco . 
  `` constant harassment/disappearances/deaths '' would mean that since it was 19 people missing as of october 2014 , there should be much more missing as of today . 
  as far as i know , this is not the case . 
  next , it is not clear at all that there was fsb or any other russian involvement , there was enough ... disagreement between crimean tatars and other locals ( mostly considering squatting , as i understand it ; you can search ukrainian media for '' \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u044b\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438 '' / '' \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0437\u0430\u0445\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0456 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438 '' if you speak russian or ukrainian ) . 
  first , `` constant '' ? 
  second , `` fsb '' ? 
  ah , sorry , missed that . 
   your constant harassment/disappearances/deaths at the hands the hands of the fsb it would be nice to see some credible sources on that .

   russia 's most pressing problem - the currency reserve running empty what ? 
  the currency reserve is n't running empty , it even grew a little since winter . 
  apparently most people in tambov region ca n't into beautiful ( well , at least not ugly ) architecture . 
  there are nice houses , but they are quite rare and not for sale . 
  according to local ( tambov region ) ads on avito.ru , something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nnnkfpa.jpg ) : 2 - or 3-storey around 300-350m ^ 2 . 
   `` freedom \u00a9 and democracy \u2122 '' would be an improvement for all countries in the russian sphere of influence . 
  yeah , because iraq and afghanistan are doing so well , right ? 
  because nuclear weapons are the only guarantee that somebody does n't try to bring some freedom \u00a9 and democracy \u2122 . 
  thing is , russia proposed that , and was declined . 
  add to this the fact that current state of art antiballistic systems ca n't possibly block russian nukes ( too many targets ) unless they were previously had been dealt with by some ... other means , and you could come to some pretty uncomfortable logical conclusions . 
  now , i 'm not saying that the us are planning to nuke us . 
  but at least it seems like they want to get some strategic advantage in that , maybe just in case , maybe to have an option to blackmail us in the future . 
  either way , antiballistic shield nearby russia that openly declines russia 's proposition to participate can only be seen as an very unfriendly act . 
   the nuclear fallout would eventually , without fail , destroy the attacking country as well . 
  you overestimate the dangers of nuclear fallout . 
  it 's not some poison that kills instantly , it 's danger depends on the amount of nukes blown up , and it surely will be far smaller if russians nukes are partly destroyed by the first strike and then intercepted by the anti-ballistic shield . 
  other solution is to do it together with russia . 
  the shield , i mean . 
  it 's against iran and other `` rogue states '' , right ? 
   we got stabbed in the back and by stabbing in the back you mean ... what ? 
  the only alternative is escalating the situation further . 
  allowing usa to undermine mad and render russian nuclear weapons meaningless would be serious strategical mistake . 
  sadly , russia ca n't step off earth . 
  i do n't think that 's how analogies work . 
  in this case , we have two guys with big-ass guns pointed at each other , but one guy also started to raise bullet-proof shield . 
  fully functional anti-ballistic shield is an offensive weapon , it enables first strike without fearing mutually-assured destruction . 
  plan of war , may be . 
  i 'm talking about the reason for the war . 
  * after * it started , may be the desired end game result for the soviets was to conquer entire finland , yes . 
  i 'm talking about * why * it started . 
  actually the winter war was n't about reconquering finland , it was about moving the border that was too close to the second largest city in the ussr . 
  technically , that was accomplished , finland lost that war . 
  they were russian , but they moved out of russia , at least on paper . 
  their website says that the main development office is still in the st. petersburg , though . 
  it is an interjection with quite broad meaning , something about surprise ( both types ) , sometimes success . 
  [ also apparently it 's inter-slavic .

  not gon na happen . 
  vpns are used extremely widely by commercial banking applications and by russian attempts at e-government . 
  that 's a joke about some poll on some internet site about how often people use internet , and some 40 % answered that they do n't use internet at all ( to reiterate , they answered that they do n't use internet in the internet-based poll on the internet site ) . 
  i do n't think it was vciom poll or other credible organization . 
  sorry i ca n't remember the details . 
  russians are brainwashed by constant propaganda . 
  russia produces nothing , it 's glorified gas station . 
  russia is the country with the largest wealth disparity in the world , where a few people own everything and all other russians live in poverty - and they enjoy it ( because remember , they are brainwashed by constant propaganda ) . 
  it has nothing to do with russian media , actually . 
  it 's just that outsiders have a ridiculous amount of all sorts of misconceptions and outright delusions about russia and russians . 
  i do n't even know where to start .
