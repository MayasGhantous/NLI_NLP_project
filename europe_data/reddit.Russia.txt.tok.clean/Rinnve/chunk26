  you grossly overestimate the importance of reddit in russia . 
  most people do n't even know about it , and even if they do , they do n't care because they do n't speak ( well , read/write ) english good enough to make it useful . 
  moreover , the article is factually wrong . 
  access to the entire reddit is * not * blocked , only one page is ( www.reddit.com/r/rudrugs/comments/1derq9/ ) . 
  internet providers in russia , however , can block entire reddit if they technically ca n't block a single page . 
  some ips are lazy or do n't want to buy expensive equipment required for it , some are not , but the intent was n't to block entire reddit . 
  the only thing reddit ( and particularly / r/europe ) can teach russians is how delusional are other people about russia . 
  most internet users in russia could n't care less about some english-speaking social media site . 
  came here to say exactly this . 
   but tutsi were a social class , not an ethnicity . 
  it is a bit more complicated than that , and ( more important ) it is still considered a genocide . 
   according to your theory , if germany would kill all turks on its soil , it would n't be a genocide , because there would be more than 50 % turks left alive . 
  in turkey . 
  that depends on how many turks live in germany , compared to the total population of turks . 
  you see , there must be a line somewhere , or * any * ethnic-based crime can be called genocide . 
  is it so hard to link a source ? 
  that 's the total death toll of stalin 's regime ( in direct documented executions , not counting mass starvations or , say forcibly relocated people who later died because of poor living conditions ) . 
  those national nkvd operations are only part of it . 
   who knows how much truth is there in `` nu pogodi ! '', 
  being a propoganda piece everybody who understands enough russian can go and check that , and see for himself that there is zero propaganda in `` nu pogodi !, 
  i do too , but there are murders and then there are genocides when entire ethnicities are ( almost ) wiped off the face of earth . 
  just imagine a mental serial murderer in , say , ukraine or latvia , who kills russians . 
  ( or the other way around . ), 
  would that be genocide ? 
   it 's estimated that 1.5 million people were affected and almost half of them ( 700 000 ) were executed by shooting . 
  those numbers seem to be off by a significant margin . 
  your source ? 
  as far as i know , polish operation was by far the biggest of those , and total death toll was about 300 thousand people . 
  also , ukrainian operation of the nkvd ? 
  there are about 1,4 billion chinese on earth now , so that would be a genocide . 
  100 thousand people out of ~ 30 million is 0,3 % . 
  compare this with actual genocides . 
  for instance , in rwanda about 70 % of tutsi were murdered . 
   it was aimed at an ethnic group of `` poles living in ussr '' . 
  `` ethnic group '' is basically a synonym for the word `` ethnicity '' , so unless you want to say `` ussr poles '' was different ethnicity from `` poland poles '' , you 're wrong . 
   may constitute genocide as defined by the un convention `` may '' is the key word . 
  un convention 's definition is pretty broad , but i do n't think that it is correct to equate this crime with holocaust or rwandan genocide . 
  please read again what i wrote in the parentheses . 
  genocide is the systematic elimination of all or a significant part of a racial , ethnic , religious , cultural or national group . 
  100 thousand poles is n't a significant part of that ethnic group ( in the sense that their murder was n't threatening to the existence of the group itself ) . 
  no , we call it `` yet another crime of the stalin 's regime '' . 
  no it 's not . 
  not every mass murder is genocide , and there is clear definition what is . 
   political change with economic growth in countries like ukraine , georgia or moldova is seen as a threat to the russian regime , since success in these countries may motivate the russian population to question their own governance model . 
  [ not sure if serious . 
  ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=67&amp;c=md&amp;c=rs&amp;c=up&amp;l=en ), 
   russians have always tried ( and often succeeded ) in destroying any non-russian cultures within russia . 
  yeah , that 's why there are 26 official languages in different regions of russia besides russian . 
  not sure , but that 's the only reasonable explanation i could come with . 
  it 's the definition of wtf moment . 
  there is no point comparing clock frequency of cpus with very different architecture . 
  for one tick , elbrus is doing much more work with its vliw commands . 
  it was the only way to achieve reasonable performance with technological process available to russia . 
  there is no way in hell pentium 2 can run [ rbdoom-3-bfg ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzodidzxsrs ) . 
  and no , it is not meant to win market competition with consumer processors . 
  it is for government and military , for work with sensitive data . 
  it may have something to do with you insisting that russia has processors equivalent in power to pentium ii which was industry standard not one , but * two * decades ago . 
  considering that computing power growths exponentially , that 's a major difference . 
  pentium ii had something seriously under 1 gflops , elbrus-4c can push 50 gflops , on par with 1st generation i7 and just about 2 times slower than current i7 . 
  this is actually great . 
  hmm , i thought it 's the same . 
  well , til . 
  it 's `` moonshine '' . 
  note how i said `` name some country authoritarian dictatorship '' , not `` prove that some country * is * authoritarian dictatorship '' . 
  just stretching your argument a little bit , we ca n't possibly know the opinion of mainland ukrainians on that matter ( or any other ) , just because ukraine is run by neo-nazis ( i just say so , no proof is required ) . 
  totally missed my point . 
  according to [ the manufacturer 's site ] ( http://www.baikalelectronics.ru/products/35/ ) , it 's mips , not arm . 
  i do n't think that there are desktops or servers based on it ( yet ) . 
   reduce dependency on western technology  isolating themselves from the rest of the world please . 
  what 's your point ? 
  so , the ussr being undemocratic somehow justifies any other state being undemocratic too ? 
  define `` necessary parties '' in the case of the ussr , and in the case of crimean referendums . 
  wait what ? 
  if it had n't a support of at least a significant part of the people , by what black magic the ussr was created ? 
  of the nation state , or the government of that state , [ that acted not how people wanted it to act ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_union_referendum,_1991 ), 
  it is whataboutism because in this context russia is irrelevant . 
  the original idea i commented was about ukraine organizing a referendum for independence . 
  what russia supports or not supports does not relates to that . 
  most , if not all `` non-crimean '' tatars in russia are volga ( kazan ) tatars ; yes , they share common culture and language . 
  i would n't say that they are spread over russia , they mostly live in tatarstan and nearby regions . 
  crimean tatars , on the other hand , are a very different group ( although they do have a connection to other tatars via common ancient history of the golden horde , and they are also muslims ) . 
  actually , i 'd say they are closer to turks , their languages , at least some dialects , are even partially mutually intelligible ( this is n't the case with the volga tatar language ) . 
  `` beevor portrays the fighting in stalingrad as not only a clash between germans and russians , but also a battle that soviet leaders waget against their own population . 
  from his perspective , one number in particular illustrates the inhuman character of the regime : general chuikov 's decision to execute around 13,500 red army soldiers unwilling to fight . 
  [ ... ] but he does not provide convincing proof . 
  [ ... ] recently declassified materials , however , show that in the period from august 1 to october 15 , 1942 - one of the most critical phases of battle for the red army - 278 soviet soldiers were executed by the soviet security police ( nkvd ) on the stalingrad front . 
  [ . . ] in addition to presenting the battle predominantly from a german perspective , beevor 's book transports a number of cliches that originated in nazi-era propaganda . 
  for instance , he describes the will of soldiers to defend the soviet union to the point of self-sacrifice as `` almost atavistic , '' , an expression that recalls the `` primitive '' eastern enemy described by goebbels and others . 
  beevor is also convinced , without providing solid evidence , that soviet troops in stalingrad lived in permanent fear of political officers , the so-called commissars . 
  by contrast , he praises wehrmacht officers for their cultivation and gallantry , and revels in the image of `` german gunners in shorts , with their bronzed torsos muscled from the lifting of shells '' who `` looked like athletes from a nazi propaganda film . 
  whatabout russia whatabout russia . 
  yes , we have our share of ultra-nationalists and neo-nazis . 
  you know what 's the difference ? 
  they are persecuted , not armed and used as a paramilitary force . 
   what happened in ukraine is the same thing that happened in the baltics or poland 25 years ago - ousting the kremlin lackeys . 
  so , you know jack shit about ukraine , but still somehow consider it possible to discuss it . 
  i do n't think it 's wise . 
   in all those countries it was led by nationalists waving flags and portaits of national hearoes are you saying that in all those countries `` national heroes '' were by strange coincidence nazi collaborators who participated in holocaust and brutal ethnic cleansing ? 
   nothing would ' v happened in donbas or crimea had the kremlin not organized it .
