  so all those antimaidans and pro-russian rallies did n't happen ? 
   this statement in itself is laughable - nobody asked them [ well , that 's simply incorrect . 
  ] ( http://www.bbg.gov/wp-content/media/2014/06/ukraine-slide-deck.pdf )  notoriously unreliable in under authoritarian dictatorships so if you name some country `` authoritarian dictatorship '' , then by your logic there is no way to ask people reliably in this country . 
  how convenient . 
  we 're conversing on an english-speaking site in the internet . 
  do you really think that i 'm getting news from the `` kremlin-controlled '' media ? 
  i 've read this interview . 
  there is nothing about `` green men '' . 
  wait wait , but the `` rebels '' are russian secret service fsb agents , no ? 
  world is big . 
  very big . 
  there ca n't be one single `` general impression '' unless you overgeneralise things to the point it ceases to make sense . 
  about the invented `` general impression '' which is pushed through western media , i could n't care less . 
  in this case ussr dissolution was illegal and all former ussr republics must rejoin with russia . 
  now * that 's * a perfect example of whataboutism . 
  `` mr putin has reversed federalism , and turned russia into a centralised state . 
  he cancelled regional elections '' except regional elections are back since 2012 . 
  this article reeks of ignorance and bias . 
  ( just one small bit : crimean tatars and kazan tatars have very little in common besides ancient history and a word `` tatar '' , so the idea of them having any `` special relation '' is ridiculous . ), 
  [ in march 2015 ? 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31779869 ), 
   even girkin admitted that there were `` green men '' in donbass . 
  except he did n't . 
  except that 's incorrect . 
  debalceve does n't matters now . 
  constitutional reform does , and it 's not happening . 
  i 'm not talking about referendum of 2014 . 
  i 'm talking of the nineties . 
  somehow the west cared little about democracy when mainland ukraine forced their will on crimea . 
  you 're confusing events in crimea and donbass . 
  there were no `` green men '' in donbass taking over ukrainian army bases . 
  and no , by the start i mean ukrainian neo-nazis taking over government buildings in kiev just a day after agreement between the president and the opposition . 
  events in donbass started as a mirror to events in kiev . 
   how is one pushing for any kind of resolution at the same time he is creating the problem for that resolution ? 
  nobody but poroshenko is creating a problem for political resolution , as for now . 
  minks ii is practically stalled , and not because of separatists . 
  i dunno , maybe finally start implementing minsk ii ? 
  oh wait , that would make poroshenko look weak . 
   russia wants the war to last . 
  that 's why putin pushed for political , not military resolution of the conflict from the start , right ? 
   ukrainian army completely in control of the region and then ... organizing a referendum for independence or joining russia considering that ukraine already ignored two crimean referendums and simply wiped its figurative ass with crimean constitution when they thought that crimeans want too much autonomy , i 'd say the hell will freeze before that could happen . 
   the guy who brings presents on christmas not on christmas . 
  on new year ( or new year 's eve ) . 
  christmas is religious holiday in russia , it 's not celebrated nearly as widely as new year . 
   never tried em but i 'm guessing so otherwise why would they not be more popular if they are indeed cheaper . 
  the default russian attitude is `` foreign is better '' ( even if it 's actually not ) . 
   i 'm unsure if cold turkey is the best way . 
  it 's not `` cold turkey '' . 
  the restriction applies only if two or more of `` local '' manufacturers can fulfull a particular request for equipment ( `` local '' meaning russian/belorussian/kazakh / armenian ) . 
   and the difference is ? 
  the difference is that it is applied if and only if at least two local manufacturers have offers on some equipment . 
  say , a hospital want to buy mri scanner . 
  they place a request , and if 2 + local manufacturers offer devices that fit the request , then the hospital ca n't buy devices offered by foreign manufacturers . 
  ( also , by `` local '' this restriction actually means not only russian , but also belorussian , kazakh and armenian equipment . ), 
   big multinational oh , russia is still quite corrupt , especially where the big money are involved . 
  but compared to the nineties , it 's night and day . 
  bad or not , it 's still not related to education or science . 
  believe me , russia in the nineties ( late nineties too , maybe even early zeroes ) and contemporary russia are very different countries . 
  there are no bribes required for that , you can do things by the book just fine . 
  at least where i live ( tambov region ) . 
  of course it 's just an anedoctal evidence , but i do n't remember any of my friends or acquaintances paying bribes at least for five years or so . 
  ( although i do n't know anybody who 'd run some big-time business , may be you 'd be extorted for money by bureaucrats if you 're worth tens of millions of rubles . ), 
  apparently you 're not able to distinguish facts from subjective opinions . 
  i see no point in communicating with mentally challenged people , it 's not worth the time . 
  have fun !, 
   for the less fortunate it will become increasingly impossible to get anything done . 
  get done like in ... ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
   let me give you an example , russia targeted an ngo called dynasty , whose purpose was the funding of educational scholarships and other scientific ventures . 
  you forgot to mention that dynasty also funded liberal mission which objective was [ `` to develop and distribute liberal values and ideas throughout russia . 
  '' ] ( http://www.dynastyfdn.com/english/programs/society/liberal ) science , eh ? 
   you start measuring your inflation  usatoday also , regarding `` fixing something '' : in the nineties , one had literally bribe his way through life in russia . 
  one would n't expect anybody in the state service to do his work without some , uh , extra stimulation . 
  doctors , teachers , professors , policemen , you name it . 
  today ( and for the last may be ten years ) things are way more sane . 
  $ 1 was worth about 33 rubles in 2014 , so $ 3050 would be 100k-something rubles . 
  now though $ 1 is over 60 rubles , do your math . 
  \u0421\u043d\u0435\u0433 , meaning `` snow '' . 
  look up in some dictionary the meaning of the word `` fact '' . 
  hint : a bunch of heavily opinionated articles often distorting reality in the pursue of their propagandist goals are as far from a factual proof as it gets . 
   the ideology as having three core components : '' ( i ) the rebirth myth , ( ii ) populist ultra-nationalism and ( iii ) the myth of decadence '' aaaand you 're providing some factual proof of russia having all three of those core components any second now , am i right ? 
   every country could be tested whether how they score on the indicators . 
  however , as said . 
  russia scores high on all the indicators it would be nice to see some links . 
  preferably , to something at least remotely similar to an academic research . 
  notice how this claim is not backed up by anything except his own words . 
  i do n't follow russian media , but i wo n't be surprised if this claim is in fact at least a stretch . 
   indicators that resemble dictatorialism , more specifically fascism , proposed by l.w.britt ( 2003 ) show that russia matches every indicator with a very high score . 
  yeah , maybe if you squint * really * hard . 
  you can also do it with half of other `` developed '' countries ( although nobody will pay you for that ) . 
  it is almost like he 's paid for it . 
  or may be it 's `` it '' , not `` he '' ? . . 
   putin ordered spy 's london murder is this even english ? 
  the amount of bullshit in this article is staggering . 
  `` they transformed in an instant : their eyes looked mad , their movements became agitated and they began uttering incoherent blather about `` the junta , '' `` fascists '' and `` the killing of russians . 
  '' '' , seriously ? 
  does anyone really believe this ? 
  that 's probably because of their specific russian accent ( theey haave toooo maany vooweels soo it seeeems thaat theey speeak tooo slooow ) . 
  sorry , you are not making any sense . 
   did n't you know that because 1 country did something ** and was n't punished for that , ** everyone can do it ?
