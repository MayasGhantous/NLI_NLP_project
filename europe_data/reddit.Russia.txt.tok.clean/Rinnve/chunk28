  here , you missed something . 
   vladimir zhirinovsky please . 
  do n't believe that it happened , or do n't believe that it was really a genocide ? 
  considering that about 60 % of adult males and about 30 % of adult females in russia are smokers , that 's actually seems pretty accurate , that 's about 12 cigarettes / day . 
  smoking a pack ( 20 cigs ) / day is n't uncommon at all here . 
   wait , you really are arguing that there actually can be a 99 % approval rating for something ? 
  [ educate yourself . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falkland_islands_sovereignty_referendum,_2013 ), 
  scandinavian languages : strange consonant clusters , strange vowels . 
  i would n't call them most pleasant , although they sound better to me than , say french ( which i just ca n't stand , sorry ) . 
  finnish , on the other hand , can sound extremely beautiful . 
  jenni vartiainen almost inspired me to actually learn finnish , just to understand those songs . 
  it would be totally impractical , of course ... 
  but maybe one day i will do that . 
   and elvish is like way cooler than your human languages . 
  fun fact : [ quenya ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quenya ) ( elvish language from the lord of the rings and the silmarillion ) was inspired by finnish . 
  that 's the moscow times for you . 
  precise reporting is n't their thing , russia bashing is . 
  [ here are the original poll 's results . 
  i do n't understand ukrainian completely , but that '' \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u044c\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e-\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438 '' ( `` answer like banderovsty '' ) ... 
  i mean , those `` heroes '' did things [ like this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) . 
  \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d \u0428\u0443\u0445\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 ( roman shukhevich ) whose spirit the author 's praising [ was their military leader . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_shukhevych#massacres_of_poles ), 
  nope , they did n't . 
  exactly , hence the results of the poll . 
  one thing is to earn a million or two in some not very long period ; say , a year . 
  but that 's not what was asked . 
  original question was [ '' \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043e\u043d\u044b \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0439 '' ] ( http://www.levada.ru/14-07-2015/neravenstvo-i-dokhody ) ( `` is it possible now in russia to earn millions of rubles honestly '' ) . 
  traditionally , when a russian is asked about how much money he earns , he thinks about monthly salary/income , so i do n't think that most respondents thought about making about $ 17k per year . 
   it 's one thing to have 17,700 in hand and another for that to be your annual income ~ not annual . 
  monthly . 
  traditionally , when a russian is asked about how much money he earns , he thinks about monthly salary/income . 
   according to them i would n't trust asylum-goers . 
  there is nothing stopping them to paint the picture a couple of shades darker than it really is just to get to yurop . 
   can you name a couple of russian consumer products yeah , because airliners and nuclear reactors are way less important than your electronic toy of choice . 
  probably . 
  it 's good then that average joe does n't get to decide , is n't it ? 
   russia hates gays that 's gross overstatement . 
  if you 're looking for a country which in fact hates gays , you should look for a country where being gay could lead to prison or death . 
  `` acceptance of the tragic events at srebrenica as genocide is a prerequisite for reconciliation '' it is n't just an acknowledgement . 
  not every war crime or mass murder is genocide . 
  how , exactly ? 
  that does n't change the fact that `` historically x '' bullshit is hardly russia-exclusive . 
  no , not all . 
  i mean , there is a uniformization and then there is a uniformization . 
  soviet union , for instance , started with [ * korenization * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korenizatsiya ) , which is pretty much the opposite of what poles did . 
  [ wrong . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cf9a4/poland_integrates_thousands_of_people_from/csv5f8u ), 
  yeah , sure . 
  nevermind [ the policy of polonisation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polonization#polonization_in_eastern_borderlands_.28kresy.29 ) , who wants this backwards ukrainian culture anyways . 
  non-polish , that 's my point . 
  western ukraine was once occupied by poland for quite a long time , but that does n't make it `` historically polish '' , not more than bulgaria is n't `` historically turkish '' . 
  that 's actually not my way of thinking , but [ scowy 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cf9a4/poland_integrates_thousands_of_people_from/csv5f8u ), 
  nope , i mean that former ruthenian ( iirc ) territory that was annexed by poland in 1330-something . 
  they were part of poland , but somehow [ they managed to remain mostly non-polish . 
  `` while they remained very attached to their religion , over time however , they lost their original tatar language , from the kipchak group of the turkic languages , and for the most part adopted polish . '' wow , so they integrated even deeper than kazan tatars , who are still bilingual . 
  which tatars ? 
  that 's a catch-all name for several different nations that do n't even have common language and history ( except maybe really ancient times ) . 
  for instance , crimean tatars are much closer to turks ( to the point of partial intelligibility of languages ) than to volga ( kazan ) tatars . 
  you mean that former russian territory that was annexed by poland in 1921 ? 
  russia should be yellow on this map : according to the current edition of the civil codex , it is explicitly allowed to create and distribute images of architecture if it 's in public place or can be seen from public place ( [ article 1276 , part 2 ] ( http://base.garant.ru/10164072/71/ ) . ), 
  and what about people who were the majority in crimea before crimean tatars conquered them ? 
  more like 600 , but that 's not really important . 
  what 's important is that crimea was a homeland to many other people , including russians ( or rather , people who were ancestors for the russian nation ) , for comparable or even longer time . 
  and that relates to south ossetia and abkhazia how , exactly ? 
  homeland ? 
  crimean tatars conquered crimea , it never was their `` homeland '' . 
  i like how all those cases are about territory , not people . 
  south ossetia ? 
  7 % of georgian territory . 
  crimea ? 
  [ `` this is our yalta , this is our sea , this is our territory !, 
  '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hugy2wublw ) i do n't ever remember those guys talking about their * people * . 
   i beg your pardon , but if a prison culture is toxic enough to twist the cultural perception of a whole nation , then you do have far more pressing problems than fighting against `` homosexual propaganda '' . 
  whatever . 
  that does n't changes the fact that the idea of lgbt equality not gon na fly in russia any time soon , and any attempts to force the process can do only bad . 
   and as `` real scientist '' i do n't pretend to be what you are very obviously not . 
   can tell you that in the absence of specific information , we often use similar findings from other contexts . 
  liiiiike ? . . 
   also , there is the small matter of in dubio pro reo . 
  one should not apply juristical practices of criminal process to things that has nothing to do with criminal process . 
   give lgbt people the benefit of the doubt . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  lgbt people are not persecuted in russia , it is enough for now . 
  societies do n't change on a whim . 
  you 've got some bits wrong . 
  here , let me help you : * we do n't know if there is any problem at all with gay marriage , ** and we do n't know that there are n't any long-term problems because even the earliest researches are not even generation-old ** . 
  * nonetheless , we should not even ~ ~ discuss ~ ~ promote ~ ~ the topic ~ ~ the idea of lgbt equality in mainstream media , ** because there are certain groups that are clearly pushing questionable or false ideas ( like that homosexuality is a norm , which it actually is n't ; it is seemingly harmless deviation ) , and do so with very questionable means ( notably , with black-and-white propaganda aimed at children : `` kissing dudes ? 
  good !, 
  russian police ? 
  bad ! '' ) . 
  ** * we should also ignore all the research from ~ ~ other countries ~ ~ the us and western europe because ~ ~ there might be the chance that some are not applicable to russia . ~ ~ ** that research do not take into account the very obvious differences between ex-soviet and us societies , like this huge stigma on homosexuality stemming from particular prison culture of the ussr and russia . 
  ** ( this may come as a surprise to you , but scientists - real scientists , i mean - do not generalise research without proving the correctness of said generalisation . ), 
   after all , how could we be certain that there are no negative effects ? 
  your analogy is wrong . 
  all those things you 've listed have very obvious positive sides . 
  what is positive side of promoting lgbt equality in russia , the way it is usually promoted , which is rubbing it in russia 's figurative face ? 
  positive side not for about 2-5 % of russians , but for society in general ? 
   i 'm curious : you can not provide reliable empirical data and you can not provide consistent logical arguments . 
  if very simple argument that research in one society does n't automatically apply to another society without any proofs of correctness of the generalisation is not enough for you , i do n't know what is .
