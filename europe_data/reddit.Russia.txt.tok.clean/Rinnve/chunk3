  dehumanizing the opponent is very easy , very convenient , it 's one of main tools of any propaganda . 
  think about it next time you want to call somebody a bot . 
  first , read your own link and try to find one article were the word ` junta ' is not cited by rt ( that is , were rt itself calls kiev government ` junta ' , not somebody they cite ) second , if rt reported something about  `` ukrainian gay nazi jew fascists '' that would be a whole new level of propaganda . 
  but in / r/europe the correct answer to an inconvenient question is a silent downvote . 
  oh , spewing out baseless accusations and shit is now ` satirizing ' ? 
  i 'm sorry , i must be out of the loop . 
  i realize that when a guy asks something basic like source on something stated , and for that he is welcomed with instant massive downvotes and toxic comments , there is something very wrong with the community . 
  thank you for reminding me about a true nature of / r/europe . 
  have fun wasting your time !, 
  how about `` some of the most disturbing pieces on the `` ukrainian gay nazi jew fascists '' '' first ? 
  how can one play a fool by asking for a link ? 
  so there were no  most disturbing pieces on the `` ukrainian gay nazi jew fascists '' and you 're just talking out of your ass . 
   i 'm not going to even bother you bothered to accuse , so do bother about backing up your accusations . 
  edit : oh , it was n't even you . 
  or is it one of your downvoting alts ? 
   rt started running some of the most disturbing pieces on the `` ukrainian gay nazi jew fascists '' links , please ? 
   ukrainian gay nazi jew fascists care to provide a link or two ? 
   first of all , nato = / = usa , it is , in the context of missile defense . 
   which your post would imply the link in my post implies the reader to follow it and read the full article . 
   second , that article is from march of this year . 
  it 's not like it was any better before . 
  year 2012 : [ `` the united states and nato , however , are only prepared to give political guarantees that the future system is not aimed at countering russian capabilities . 
  anything further than that has been ruled out by domestic politics and in particular blocked by republicans in u.s. congress '' ] ( http://cns.miis.edu/stories/120514_nato_russia_missile_defense.htm ) even better ( from the same article ) : `` reportedly , the administration had also entertained the possibility of sharing classified data on the existing and future interceptors to demonstrate that they will not be able to intercept russian strategic missiles . 
  however such sharing has not gone forward after congress insisted on 60 days notice before any such communication , and leading lawmakers , including rep. mike turner ( r-ohio ) , chairman of a key house armed services subcommittee , indicated they will oppose such sharing . '' there are no reasons for russia to treat nato other than possible adversary , and this is because of nato itself . 
  `` despite our efforts since the collapse of communism , russia clearly views nato not as a partner , but as an adversary . '' in other , completely unrelated article : [ `` we have repeatedly made clear that the united states can not and will not accept any obligations that limit our ability to defend ourselves , our allies , and our partners , including where we deploy our \\ [ ballistic missile defense \\ ] capable aegis ships , '' ] ( http://freebeacon.com/national-security/u-s-rejects-latest-russian-proposal-to-restrict-u-s-missile-defenses/ ) `` efforts '' . 
  this kind of thinking is exactly what mr. klaus was talking about . 
  giving a voice only to convenient , ` politically correct ' opinions may be a milder form of censure , but a censure nevertheless . 
  instead of directly oppressing opposition , you just make sure that it 's voice is not loud enough , that correct ` agenda ' is ` furthered ' strong enough . 
  it is exactly the same thing that was practiced in the mid/late ussr ( before perestroika ) . 
  in a society with true free speech , conferences do not have agenda to push . 
  they have topics to present and discuss , and anyone is welcome as long as he stays on topic . 
  thank you for demonstrating how all comments with the word ` russia ' that are not about bashing russia are treated in / r/europe . 
  it is rather amusing , actually , kind of a knee-jerk reaction that requires no thinking . 
  no , because almost all comments that are not bashing russia are downvoted here . 
   he claims he was not invited as a keynote speaker to `` a conference '' and he feels repressed ? 
  `` * ( 1 ) * having been invited to be a keynote speaker at a conference [ ... ] * ( 2 ) * the organisers find out i have reservations about the eu [ ... ] * ( 3 ) * and they say , `` we are very sorry , we have already found a different keynote speaker '' dunno about you , but inviting a speaker and then rejecting him because of his views counts as a repression of the free speech in my books . 
  [ `` when it 's a question of action against the slavs , you can always count on romania '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romania_in_world_war_ii ) especially when it 's about russians . 
  romania stronk . 
  i was not talking to you , dumbass . 
   they literally preferred mongol hordes to europeans . 
  you should remove yourself from the internet . 
  you make it a great deal dumber . 
   so long story short , both cant win because russia wont let a mutually beneficial situation to arise . 
  for that to arise , there must be trilateral discussions and trilateral agreement . 
  eu refuses that . 
   yeah , just like it was difficult for the non-existant observers to get past the armed russians outside the crimean polling stations . 
  there were observers , just not the kind the west wanted ; still , on all videos and photos there were no armed ` polite men ' in the vicinity of crimean polling stations . 
  osce outright refused to send the observers . 
   their languages will die and it is exactly the goal of current russia , to get a mass of easily manipulated ` homo soveticuses ' . 
  so basically you state that any non-russian-speaking human is superior to russian , being less easily manipulated . 
  i see no reason communicating with retards . 
  good bye . 
  finno-ugric minorities of russia ` face extinction ' for about a century , that is , their population was almost constant all this time . 
  population of swede minority in finland [ is almost constant too ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish-speaking_population_of_finland#mediaviewer/file:finlandssvenskar_1880-2009.jpg ) . 
  so how about nope ? 
  it is working very well in tatarstan , for example . 
  may be the problem is not with russians ? 
   it just shows that it 's not a `` multinational country '' they portray themselves to be , but actually very chauvinistic and heavily russian-oriented . 
  minorities in russia have their rights , they keep their culture and use their language as official in the regions they live in . 
  what fucking else do you need ? 
  western press reporting bullshit about russia ? 
  yep , sounds about right . 
  ( he was given with a souvenir , a small model of that jet . 
  reuters and the guardian did n't mention that unimportant detail for some reason . ), 
   do you think such country has any rights to say anything about minorities , especially to other finno-ugric nations ? 
  are the rights of those minorities infringed now in some way ? 
  is there a policy of forcible russification for those minorities , are they prohibited from any use of their language , official business included ? 
  no , no and no . 
  did those minorities became minorities because their population decreased , or because population of russians increased ? 
  most probably the latter . 
  what do you want russia to do , prohibit russians from settling there , working there and paying taxes there - just to preserve ` ethnic purity ' of the regions ? 
  this is bollocks . 
   all those ethnic minorities , including all the finno-ugric nations of russia are disappearing or being russificated very fast could you provide a source on that ? 
  i do n't know about finno-ugric minorities in russia , but for example tatars or north caucasian minorities are n't any close to ` disappearing ' or ` being russificated ' . 
  and what exactly russians do in ukraine what was n't already done here and there by other major countries in the world without any consequences ? 
   what the fuck were russians doing there in the first place ? 
  because when chechens are not controlled , they create all sorts of problems for their neighbors . 
  why the second chechen war started ? 
  because chechens not only made business out of abductions and slavery , but they became the regional training center for terrorists and finally they attacked dagestan . 
  is [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falkland_islands_sovereignty_referendum,_2013 ) a stalinist score too ? 
  wow . 
  you 're crazier than entire / r/conspirology put together . 
   i do n't blame them for not liking russians nobody blames them for ` not liking russians ' . 
  they are blamed because of attempt of ethnic cleansing of all non-chechens and because of their medieval brutality ; and after they gained de facto independence after the first chechen war , they are blamed for terrorism , mass abductions and slave trade . 
  this is a little bit worse than just ` not liking russians ' . 
  you should look up what they did to russian pows , it takes the concept of war crime to a whole new level . 
  and be careful about history , we can dig up [ a bunch of skeletons ] ( http://www.pulse-project.org/node/83 ) in your closet too , mr. * romanian american * . 
  [ in both of your closets . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internment_of_japanese_americans ), 
   if you are n't russian you are fucked and at best do n't matter . 
  that must be the reason for hundreds of different ethnicities in russia now , with their official languages and culture and all . 
   kazakhstan moved their capital just because russia is ruled by a bunch of kgb kazakhstan moved their capital * closer * to russia , you fucktard , because almaty was too close to china . 
   where do you guys take all that super-dense wheat . 
  google for ` bulk density of the buckwheat ' . 
   here 's what 22,000 kg of wheat looks like according to russia nope , that 's according to your half-assed anti-russian propaganda . 
  there are [ plenty of videos ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2g9y91/second_russian_convoy_rolls_into_eastern_ukraine/ckhr1jr ) that show reasonably-loaded trucks . 
  those , of course , are very inconvenient for you , are n't they ? 
  every picture you chose to remember . 
  here are some videos of that convoy : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkxzkpj35p0#t=84 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqj8pv1h2ga#t=22 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqj8pv1h2ga#t=59 http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x23il7z_russian-aid-convoy-heads-for-eastern-ukraine_news this does n't look like ` almost empty ' to me . 
   chechen were by and large moderates before their country was turned upside-down .
