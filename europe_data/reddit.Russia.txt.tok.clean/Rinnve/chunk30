   `` kvas flavoured soft drink '' coca cola is worse than hitler . 
  even if its not tundra , there is almost no infrastructure there . 
  imagine the costs of building infrastructure on the area larger than entire europe . 
  actually , if chinese would want to invest some money there , i think they will be very welcome do to so . 
  russia lower that freaking libya and egypt ? 
  that 's not a fishy rating at all !, 
   now there is park where russian parents can take their kids to play with tanks and grenade launchers eh , small ( and not so small ) military monuments ( mostly honoring great patriotic war ) in form of real heavy weapons like tanks and artillery are quite common in russia ( like [ this ] ( https://www.google.ru/maps/@52.751116,41.414983,3a,75y,209.33h,82.69t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssjo9xh1ilk0abgiajqg39g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=ru ) or [ this ] ( https://www.google.ru/maps/@52.894343,40.497205,3a,75y,129.46h,78.64t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s-4yj7svwubxevgmnpqgeeq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=ru ) ) ; and yes , kids do play there . 
  the hardware there is all outdated though . 
   after 1939-1945 , 1945-1989 , afghanistan , chechenia , georgia and now ukraine . 
  they matched it quite well . 
  [ i would n't be so sure about it . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_united_states_military_operations#1945.e2.80.931949 ), 
  actually , [ the chinese themselves have plenty of nigh uninhabitable land ] ( http://www.china-mike.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/china_population_density-map2.jpg ) , i very much doubt that they will also want russian frozen tundra . 
  [ here is a map of permafrost in russia . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pgy92o0.jpg ) green = no permafrost ; yellow and orange = transitional permafrost ( whatever that means ) ; red = pervasive permafrost . 
  as you can see , half of the russian territory is n't very habitable . 
  edit : uploaded it to imgur since reddit apparently ca n't into cyrillic urls . 
  oh , thanks for the info , it 's actually interesting to know that there is definite article in one of slavic languages !, 
  for me it 's tenses . 
  i 'm okay with my accent not going anywhere , but english has a metric ton of different accents anyways . 
  tenses , on the other hand , are about structure of thought . 
  you ca n't get far without solid grasp of those . 
   for some reason in russia you dont learn english . 
  this is not exactly the case . 
  without long daily practice it is nigh impossible to learn foreign language from different language family to the point it would be practical to use in real-time videogame . 
  by the time russians ( that is , those who * do * learn english ) can communicate more or less adequately , they are probably out of university already and in a business of some sort . 
  wait wait . 
  are you telling that bulgarian has actually something analogous to english articles ( a/the ) ? 
  because russian has n't . 
  there is literally no way to translate `` a red suitcase '' and `` the red suitcase '' without losing the difference between `` a '' and `` the '' . 
  it 's `` lithuania 's ambassador told that lithuania wanted to supply arms '' , not `` lithuania to became ... '' . 
  in other words , wishful thinking on the side of ukrainian media . 
   why does n't ukraine move to take back crimea ? 
  because they know that most of crimean citizens would be * very * against that . 
  please link * one * article in the western press mentioning violations of minsk agreements by ukrainian forces ( except the osce site itself ) . 
  you do n't understand . 
  minsk agreement violations only matter when separatists do it . 
  ah , okay , then russia has all reasons to fear * some individual states that just happen to be in nato * . 
  any random combination of them . 
   it was united nation that authorized help to anti-gaddafi rebels and that makes nato defensive how , exactly ? 
  defensive alliance , by definition , does n't act unless attacked ( or , at least , in the immediate vicinity of attack ) . 
  name * one * nato military operation that committed to defend a nato member . 
  `` defensive organization '' my ass . 
  nato was created `` to keep the russians out , the americans in , and the germans down . '', 
  factually wrong message : +13 . 
  link proving it false : -4 . 
  facts apparently are not considered contributing to the discussion here . 
  i am done wasting time with this rotten , twisted , circlejerking joke of a community . 
  have fun living in your delusional imaginary world . 
   the fact is that he has been harassed by russian authorities and that there is no proper opposition in russia . 
  this is not fact , this is delusion . 
  opposition in russia right now is preparing for elections in several big cities . 
  if that 's not `` proper opposition '' i do n't know what is . 
   if you deny that then maybe you should pay attention to what happens in your country . 
  i ca n't even . 
  minutes ago i showed you that i follow russian events while you do not , and still that condescending `` you 're blind with putin propaganda '' oh so usual for / r/europe . 
   the last major news about navalny you mean `` last major news about navalny as reported by western media '' . 
  somehow western media forgets to report when russian opposition is working as intended in proper democracy , thus creating distorted picture of undemocratic , completely authoritarian state . 
   how much do you know about finland ? 
  i know little , that 's true . 
  the key difference is i do n't run around spewing nonsense about finland while knowing jack shit about real events . 
   oh yeah he 's sitting in house arrest unable to communicate with anyone other than his family members , convenient since he is an opposition politician . 
  [ except you 're completely wrong . 
  ] ( https://navalny.com/p/4299/ ) this clearly demonstrates how much you know about what 's happening in russia . 
  is there one reason to trust this site ? 
   and english has no chance to beat russian in russia . 
  while that 's true , english sure creeps quite a bit into russian , sometimes completely unnecessarily so . 
   not really hard to master no ... 
  i dunno , may be go read some serious fiction . 
  ten years ago , when i finally became able to read technical books without a dictionary ( except for some obscure words , of course ) , i thought : `` ah , finally i can read my favourite books without interference of the translation ! '', 
  i started with the lotr . 
  the disillusionment was as epic as the book itself . 
  your usual conversational internet english is like 10 % of the real thing . 
   the word `` kulak '' was invented eh , it was n't invented . 
  it is listed in dahl 's dictionary , that 's mid-19 century . 
   hanging mass murderer 's portraits everywhere first , stalin was n't mass murderer , not more than churchill or roosevelt . 
  second , everywhere ? 
  not / r/europe imaginary russia , no . 
  outsiders often confuse glorifying stalin with not painting that period of history pure black . 
  some reason ? 
  some videos on teh internets are irrelevant . 
  soviet apologism and pseudohistory in school program , that 's big . 
  too bad you care only about unimportant things . 
  yeah . 
  do n't think so . 
  some old farts , that is all . 
  you can start with the names of the reviewed books . 
   even the school program in russia is very heavy in soviet apologism and pseudohistory let 's start with what 's really important , not some videos on youtube or arguably `` pseudo '' history which was , according to your link , ignored both by teachers and kids . 
  some [ citations ] are clearly required . 
  why campaigning for more babies is n't a viable solution ? 
   as i understand , younger generation are even not familiar with real stalin 's ` achievements ' . 
  it is taught in schools , actually . 
  you wo n't get good marks on history classes if you do n't know about the crimes of ussr regime . 
  it just is n't taught in black and white , you wo n't get good marks on history if you do n't know about the achievements of ussr regime too . 
   `` they 're campaigning for women to have not just one but two or three babies . 
  this is a stupid solution to the demographic problem . '' like there are any other solutions . 
   it never stops to amaze me how come on this earth there 's still plenty of people , glorifying frickn ' ussr . 
  eh , ussr before , during and after stalin 's rule are three quite different states . 
  ( not that there is no people glorifying * stalin 's * ussr ; when it comes to stupidity , humanity has plenty to offer . ),
