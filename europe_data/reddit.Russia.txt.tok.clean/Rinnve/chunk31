   ukraine is not a country . 
   they did n't even bother to change their anthem . 
  [ actually , it was changed . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_anthem_of_russia#.22patrioticheskaya_pesnya.22 ) it was changed back ( with different words ) in 2000 because `` patriotic song '' was n't really a song , and national anthem without words is kinda awkward . 
   not in crimea tatars ( or kazan tatars , but they are simply `` tatars '' in russian , compared to all other members of this ethnic family ) and crimean tatars are two different nations , with different history , langauge and culture . 
  they share ancient history , and they do have some similarities , but that 's it . 
  kazan tatars were deeply integrated into the russian state for centuries ; crimean tatars were conquered to end their slave raids . 
  chechnya now , or chechnya twenty years ago ? 
  because , you know , contemporary chechnya is quite pro-russian ( though it may have something to do with billions of rubles poured into the region ) . 
  are you talking about page 23 of the [ report ] ( https://www.bellingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/forensic_analysis_of_satellite_images_en.pdf ) ? 
   imo the smoking gun was the rectangles around the vehicles which were not addressed at all in the criticism . 
  they were . 
  `` similar textures should have similar coloring under ela '' . 
  bellingcat incorrectly compared those vehicles with other vehicles on other photo which does n't show similar coloring under ela ; the catch is you ca n't compare ela of different pictures ( different pictures = different source and processing = different error levels ) . 
  the photo itself has other similar textures with similar error levels . 
   this expert distancing himself from the report doesnt make the report fake confirming debunking analysis makes it so ( first tweet ) . 
  ah , it seems i misunderstood you . 
  those tweets are about previous bellingcat report . 
  millions of muslim tatars are coexisting with russians quite peacefully for centuries , so yes , it is certainly possible . 
  last time i checked dr. neal krawetz was n't russian .

  damn . 
  the translation of this line is surprisingly imprecise ( i have n't checked out other parts ) . 
  ( `` it seems that god built [ or ` arranged ' ] my life in such a way i has nothing to regret . '' ), 
  actually , you are n't entirely correct either . 
  ( `` it seems that god built my life in such a way i has nothing to regret . '' ), 
  nothing wrong , man just doing his work . 
   sbu has pretty good track record publishing real ones . 
  how do you know that they are real ? 
  are you forensic expert , by chance ? 
  i do n't remember any of those records to be analyzed and verified by independent third party , so i see no reason whatsoever to trust them . 
  as for themselves , i do n't really care what they do . 
  though there is a bit of difference between shooting to freak out , and shooting to kill . 
   it 's a vicious circle exactly . 
  people who leave en masse can forget about their former countries improving . 
  i know , i know . 
  that does n't change anything : if smart people leave , country has no chance to improve . 
  this chance is taken away with those people . 
  you 're trying to change the subject . 
  who will change latvia , or estonia , or russia or ukraine if all good and intelligent people just leave ? 
  thanks to draft , and also to prolonged military conflicts in caucasus , this argument about `` volunteers not having any military experience '' is invalid : many men both in russia and ukraine do have military experience . 
  from http://marina-yudenich.livejournal.com/1356999.html , about [ this interview that konstanin gave to some german tv channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zwblgfogns ) : `` from what the journalist said , answering a question from another journalist , we can conclude that : - the president of russia bitterly regrets that russia excluded from the g8 . 
  - president of russia meets with leaders of italy and china only to spite g7 . 
  - president of russia is cynical . 
  - political regime in russia is an authoritarian regime similar to `` late brezhnev '' . 
  - russia is interested in escalating the conflict in ukraine . 
  i [ this blogger ] have only three questions . 
  to the ntv journalist konstantin goldenzweig : - how he knows what he said about the feelings of the president ? 
  - who authorized him - employee of the federal channel , of the state-owned company , - to make such statements ? 
  to the management of ntv : - guys , are you ... out of your mind , by chance ? 
  '' apparently konstantin fucked up and was given the chance to retire `` by his own accord '' ( this is quite often used practice in russia if you fucked up , but have good relations with the management and do n't want to ruin your career ) . 
  * disclaimer : right now i do n't have the time to read the translation of the interview , so i do n't know if this blogger is correct . 
   the attempts to paint nato as a direct military threat that intend to invade russia the what ? 
  may be i 'm missing something , but i do n't remember even one such attempt in our mainstream media . 
   seems kind of pertinent to recognise that both sides are shelling civilian areas with the aim of killing the opposing armed forces . 
  except this article states that separatists shelled civilian areas * that are under their control * . 
   our own countries have to improve socially if anyone wants to stay here . 
  there is a catch here . 
  the country is the people who live there . 
  if the mentality of `` i 'd better get out until things will get better '' is widespread enough , things will nether better . 
  so , the usual `` separatists are shelling themselves '' . 
  this is fucking disgusting . 
  it 's not about actual country opinion , it 's about what russians think about it . 
  according to levada center , in 2009 more russians considered ukraine unfriendly than in 2015 . 
  `` friends and enemies '' is n't entirely correct translation . 
  `` friendly and unfriendly countries '' is better , as in `` how do you think those countries consider russia ? '', 
  it was a right thing to do . 
  using social media for targeting individuals has nothing to do with free speech . 
  russia : illegal for teachers ( not criminal , though ; it is in the law on education , not in criminal codex , so teacher can be only fired for that ) , border-line legal for parents . 
   europe 's a continent nope . 
  eurasia is . 
   here are some non american ngo 's for you which your government is banning/heavily restricting in russia source on them being `` banned/heavily restricted '' ? 
  fes , for one , have n't complained yet . 
   so because they are funded by other countries they are inherently evil and bad for russia ? 
  notice how i wrote exactly nothing about ngos being evil ( or good for that matter ) . 
  you 've completely missed the point : kicking out ngos has nothing to do with `` isolating from the world '' . 
  the article is sensationalist as shit . 
  on the side note , i find it interesting that there are no chinese or , say , indian funded ngos in russia ( if i 'm not mistaken ) . 
  yeah , and by `` isolating from the world '' we mean `` kicking out ngos funded by usa and their friends '' . 
  elaborate , please , i do n't quite understand your question . 
  well , some people here think otherwise . 
  their concerts generated quite a bit of controversy , orthodox activists even forced them to cancel performances in some cities . 
   but would n't it have been cheaper and less diplomatically damaging to just build a new port in sochi or something which would be in turn completely neutralized by nato base in crimea . 
  ( i 'm pretty sure that if not for crimea and east ukrainian events , the plan for the new ukrainian government and their friends was to denounce sevastopol lease as `` criminal '' , fast-forward ukraine to nato and eventually block russia from the black sea completely , at least in military/strategical sense . ), 
  ever heard about [ behemoth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/behemoth_ ( band \\ ) ) or [ darzamat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/darzamat ) ? 
  we ( as in , we humans ) need more people with that kind of mindset . 
  sadly , not gon na happen overnight . 
  yeah , what 's wrong about using imprecise weapons against civilian target . 
  thanks for the reply !, 
  another question , if i may : how atheists or people of fringe religion views ( satanists , thelema followers etc. ), 
  are viewed upon in poland ? 
  yeah , that bulgarian thing is mind-boggling . 
  i mean , they are proper slavs , they use correct alphabet , i almost understand them without translation ( basic things at least ) , but this headshaking thing ? 
  it almost makes them proper slavs from another planet . 
  same here , after 22:00 it 's blinking yellow `` free ride '' in most places . 
  makes some roads freaking dangerous to cross in the dark , though . 
  belarus has some point here in requiring pedestrians to wear light-reflecting decals . 
  same here , people just do n't care about safety it seems .
