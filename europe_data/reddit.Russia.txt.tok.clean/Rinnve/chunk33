  [ you 're confusing russia with another country . 
  ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:usa&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=us+gdp#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_kd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:est:rus:ukr&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ), 
  evading question with another question is a bad habit . 
  if you get accustomed to it and use it in face-to-face conversation , your face can get hurt . 
   open your eyes then . 
  i wonder what else will you invent if i actually take a walk with a camera . 
  probably `` the camera was pointed the wrong way for all the time '' , or something , am i right ? 
   constant do you even read ? 
   so , we 're looking at year 1990 - a `` top '' year of soviet union . 
  are you paid to spread bullshit , or it 's your hobby ? 
  first , this is 1990 or even later ( video quality is surprisingly high for that time ) , so last days of ussr at best . 
  1970s were much better , as i understand it from people who experienced it . 
  second , this position is hardly a majority , and at least part of it is counter-reaction to the attempts to blacksmear ussr history ( like it was pure evil and such ) . 
   definitely russia . 
  i can take a walk throughout my city and not see any flag or other patriotic symbols . 
  am i living in wrong russia ? 
  also , `` constant use of patriotic mottos , slogans , symbols , songs , and other paraphernalia '' ? 
  seriously ? 
  compared to the original criterion : `` fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos , slogans , symbols , songs , and other paraphernalia . 
  flags are seen everywhere , as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays . '', 
  opposition politicians * regularly * thrown in jail or shot in russia ? 
  regularly as in `` there were two cases '' ? 
  leaving aside that navalny 's case is very fishy indeed . 
  you 're either paid troll or simply delusional . 
  putin is a nationalist . 
  that would be a political suicide . 
  that tells more about that `` democracy index '' . 
  first prime minister , lee kuan yew , was in power for 31 years . 
  current one , his son , for 10 years already . 
  democracy my ass . 
  standard of living has nothing to do with political system . 
  for instance , singapore is basically a dictatorship , and it 's an economical miracle . 
  it only fits 3 for certain and another 4 only for some extent . 
  rampant sexism , disdain for intellectuals and the arts ? 
  intertwined religion and government ? 
  please . 
   rise of ultra-nationalism are , likewise , obvious features of russia in 2015 ultra-nationalism not gon na fly in multinational country such as russia . 
  let 's see ... 1 . 
  `` powerful and continuing nationalism . '' nope . 
  not nearly on the described level . 
  `` disdain for the recognition of human rights '' . 
  nope . 
  again , not nearly on the described level . 
  especially with that part about * people * tending to look the other way or even approve violations of the human rights . 
  `` unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe '' ? 
  nope . 
  no supremacy of the military , but they are somewhat disproportionally funded . 
  count that as a half point . 
  `` rampant sexism . 
  the governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated . '' nope . 
  lgbt problems are more cultural-related ( and are n't unique to russia , basically all of eastern europe is homophobic to some extent ) . 
  `` controlled mass media '' . 
  definitely yes . 
  `` obsession with national security '' . 
  not quite obsession , but yes , there is certainly something here . 
  `` religion and government are intertwined '' . 
  nope . 
  religious rhetoric is sure as hell not common for government officials . 
  `` corporate power is protected '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure that power dynamics up there at the top are a lot more complicated than `` mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite '' , but yeah , there is something here . 
  `` labor power is suppressed '' . 
  i do n't remember last time i heard about labor unions doing something worth mentioning , so add this one too . 
  `` disdain for intellectuals and the arts . 
  fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education , and academia . '' sure as hell no . 
  `` obsession with crime and punishment - under fascist regimes , the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws . '' nope . 
  may be it 's just the observer bias or something , but usa looks a lot more like a police state from here . 
  `` rampant cronyism and corruption '' . 
  not nearly as rampant as it was during yeltsin 's rule , but yes , contemporary russia is definitely still quite corrupt . 
  `` fraudulent elections '' . 
  although infamous 146 % was a tv channel fuckup , yes , elections are manipulated at least to some extent . 
  so ... 3 certainly yes and another 4 yes to some extent . 
  i suppose that 's good for lithuania . 
  your jokes are even worse than rogozin 's . 
   this sub desperately needs different posts this sub desperately needs different subscribers . 
  just look at the top comment here . 
  he specifically noted that this is a joke , though . 
  whatever floats your boat . 
   surely the pro russians could also be seen as `` radical nationalists '' google what is `` right sector '' and `` svoboda '' party . 
   well , 54 % is a majority . 
  there is a big difference between marginal majority and `` most citizens '' . 
   if the separatist regions cared so much about who was in charge , why did n't they take part in the vote they already did , when they voted for yanukovich . 
   even 51 % is enough to say most . 
  it seems you need to read the definition of the word [ `` most '' . 
  ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/most?s=t )  kind of hard to have a vote for the president of ukraine we are n't talking about that , though . 
  there are many ukrainian citizens still living in that region , and many ukrainians who were forced to run to russia thanks to glorious ukrainian army ; without accounting for the opinion of those people , one ca n't say `` most ukrainians support a pro eu government '' . 
   pro-russian ukrainians saw this as an illegal overthrow it was an illegal overthrow , by radical nationalists . 
  there was [ an agreement ] ( http://www.unian.net/politics/887869-obnarodovan-tekst-soglasheniya-ob-uregulirovanii-krizisa-v-ukraine.html ) between yanukovich and the opposition on how to rule things out , then `` right sector '' leader yarosh said that they wants yanukovich to resign on next day , or else they will storm presidential and government buildings ( and they did ) . 
  there were also [ rumors about plans to kill yanukovich ] ( http://tass.ru/en/world/775435 ) . 
   54 % supported the election of poroshenko which indicates to me that most ukrainians support a pro eu government . 
  why so ? 
  first , 54 % is not that much to say `` most '' . 
  second , separatist regions did n't voted ( if i 'm not mistaken ) . 
   ~ ~ some ~ ~ i think ftfy, 
  the media has little to do with putin 's popularity . 
  life in russia improved massively during his rule , especially for lower middle class ( pretty much non-existing before ) and working class , so people attribute those positive changes to putin . 
  no u, 
   yes , but quite limited . 
  nope , read the convention . 
  article 4 lists different kinds of pows , including even `` inhabitants of a non-occupied territory , who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces , without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units , provided they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war . '' this obviously does n't apply , but `` members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps , including those of organized resistance movements , belonging to a party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory '' might , since lnr at least pretends that those guys were their volunteers . 
   if he is a serving member of the russian army , he is officially protected as a prisoner of war [ geneva conventions ] ( https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/1595a804df7efd6bc125641400640d89/6fef854a3517b75ac125641e004a9e68?opendocument ) protect not only serving members of an army , but also all other combatants , even independent militias and guerilla fighters .
