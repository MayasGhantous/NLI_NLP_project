  there are other rules , though , as do n't pretend to be civilian , for instance . 
  also , it depends on the conflict being international . 
  voted for prokhorov that time . 
  there were no doubt 's that putin would win , though , and not because of voting fraud ( although i 'm pretty sure it took place in some places ) : literally anybody i personally know voted for putin and they were very surprised when discovered my choice . 
  people * do * support him . 
  immensely . 
  look , another meme-powered automaton . 
   by their own admission , the russian terrorists `` locked the crimean mps and held them hostage until they voted the right way '' please provide a quote when girkin says that . 
  with `` held them hostage '' and `` until they voted the right way '' . 
  also , i was talking about the crimean referendum . 
  of course . 
   altho i 'm sure that was the case in crimea actually , every time somebody 's talks about `` voting booths surrounded by soldiers '' in crimea or something like that , i ask to link some photos or videos . 
  usually i only get silence and downvotes , because while there are plenty of photos or videos of that referendum , there are no armed men on those . 
  international law is precedential . 
  if it 's legal for us to fly their drones over sovereign countries , it 's legal for everyone else . 
   i agree . 
  you should n't . 
  [ here is a quote direct from the convention itself  ( https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/article.xsp?action=opendocument&amp;documentid=28f3d027685b77d2c12563cd0051aa51 ) `` the present convention shall apply to all cases of declared war ** or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the high contracting parties , even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them . 
  since you seem to be unable to comprehend simple and very specific questions , the only other question i have is this : in what programming language are you programmed ? 
   you are making a creationist type argument . 
  i 'm not making an argument , i 'm asking you specific and simple to understand question . 
  why do you refuse to answer them ? 
   the world as a whole is saying gc doesnt apply bullshit . 
  the world as a whole does n't have united opinion on that . 
   even that judge you quoted he said it doesnt apply he did not said that . 
  if you disagree , please provide a quote when he says that . 
   you are the one who can not accept the law . 
  actually , that 's you . 
  why * exactly * article 3 does n't apply to them in the case of internal conflict ? 
  why * exactly * article 4 does n't apply to them in the case of international conflict ( and ukraine keeps telling the world this is the case ) ? 
  it proved me wrong ? 
  how , exactly ? 
  lol . 
  i recited the parts of the convention that clearly state that pows are under protection even if one party is n't admitting that there 's an armed conflict , even if it 's an internal conflict , a civil war , and you just keep repeating your line like a broken bot . 
   your opinion is irrelevant again . 
  it is not my opinion , it is geneva convention on pows simplified for you . 
  okay , if you 're not willing to follow the link and read it , read the relevant parts of geneva convention on the treatment of pows here . 
  first , since ukraine cries all day about russian invasion , by article 2 said convention do apply , even if russia do n't recognize any involvement : `` art 2 . 
  in addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peace time , the present convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the high contracting parties , even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them . '' second , even for internal conflicts , there is article 3 of this convention : `` art 3 . 
  in the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the high contracting parties , each party to the conflict shall be bound to apply , as a minimum , the following provisions : ( 1 ) persons taking no active part in the hostilities , including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness , wounds , detention , or any other cause , shall in all circumstances be treated humanely , without any adverse distinction founded on race , colour , religion or faith , sex , birth or wealth , or any other similar criteria . 
  to this end the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons : ( a ) violence to life and person , in particular murder of all kinds , mutilation , cruel treatment and torture ; ( b ) taking of hostages ; ( c ) outrages upon personal dignity , in particular , humiliating and degrading treatment ; ( d ) the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples . 
  ( 2 ) the wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for . 
  '' in the case of international conflict , even if it is n't recognized by russia ( as states article 2 ) , article 4 and all remaining articles of this convention should apply : `` art 4 . 
  prisoners of war , in the sense of the present convention , are persons belonging to one of the following categories , who have fallen into the power of the enemy : ( 1 ) members of the armed forces of a party to the conflict , as well as members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces . 
  ( 2 ) members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps , including those of organized resistance movements , belonging to a party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory , even if this territory is occupied , provided that such militias or volunteer corps , including such organized resistance movements , fulfil the following conditions : ( a ) that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates ; ( b ) that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance ; ( c ) that of carrying arms openly ; ( d ) that of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war . '', 
   like i said the geneva does n't offer them protection . 
  if those soldiers are volunteers for novorossia , then rules for `` armed conflict not of an international character '' are in power ( article 3 of convention on the treatment of pows ) . 
  if those soldiers are russian soldiers ordered to act by their chain of command , then it is clearly an international armed conflict , and article 4 is in power . 
  the only cases when those guys are not protected by geneva conventions are those : a ) they are russian soldiers but they were not ordered by their chain of command ; in other words , they took weapons and act on their own . 
  in that case , they are defectors and armed criminals . 
  b ) they are russian soldiers or volunteers for novorossia , and they committed an act of perfidy ( like acting as unarmed harmless civilians and then attacking with concealed weapons ) . 
   he is saying geneva does n't apply he is not saying that . 
  francois heisbourg clearly stated that it is a violation of geneva conventions ( hence , they do apply ) , and gary solis never says that `` geneva conventions do n't protect those guys '' or something like that . 
  the only thing he says that `` red cross has not classified the ukraine conflict as a war between states '' . 
  article 2 of aforementioned convention clearly says that it `` shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the high contracting parties , even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them . '', 
   i noticed you didnt link to the geneva but some guys opinion . 
  go and find there something that contradicts with `` some guys opinion '' . 
  btw , this `` some guy '' is `` a former u.s. military judge who teaches the law of armed conflict '' , so i 'm pretty sure he knows a thing or two about when geneva conventions apply and when they do n't . 
   you can not cite anything in the document that protects them . 
  ukraine states that those soldiers are russian . 
  hence , if ukraine 's right , geneva conventions do apply to them ( [ art . 
  4 part 1 ] ( https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/1595a804df7efd6bc125641400640d89/6fef854a3517b75ac125641e004a9e68?opendocument ) ) . 
  if ukraine 's lying and those are former russian soldiers who volunteered to fight for novorossia , art . 
  3 ( same link ) still applies ( although then this video does not cross the line yet ) . 
  i think that 's a bit different , this is about trial and punishment for espinage . 
  at least some experts seem to agree that there may be a violation of geneva conventions here : `` `` there are still rules and there 's still customary international law that applies , '' solis says . 
  he adds that under the geneva conventions ' criteria for international conflicts , the video `` absolutely '' violates the statute barring `` insults and public curiosity . '', 
  `` you do n't show someone in any circumstance , whether they 're in a hospital bed or standing upright , for purposes of satisfying public curiosity , '' solis says . '' ( [ source ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-russian-pow-issue-war-crime-concerns/27025069.html ) ), 
  http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-russian-pow-issue-war-crime-concerns/27025069.html `` gary solis , a former u.s. military judge who teaches the law of armed conflict at georgetown university in washington , says that even if the red cross has not classified the ukraine conflict as a war between states , `` that does n't mean that you can do anything you want . '', 
  `` there are still rules and there 's still customary international law that applies , '' solis says . 
  he adds that under the geneva conventions ' criteria for international conflicts , the video `` absolutely '' violates the statute barring `` insults and public curiosity . '', 
  `` you do n't show someone in any circumstance , whether they 're in a hospital bed or standing upright , for purposes of satisfying public curiosity , '' solis says . '' seems i was right after all . 
  there are tons of minority ethnicities in russia , and then there are tons of tons of mixed bloods ( which are not looked down upon or even a thing worth mentioning in most cases btw ), 
  apparently the modern view on geneva conventions is that it 's all ok except when militants try and disguise themselves as harmless unarmed civilians while conducting military ops . 
  ca n't link on mobile right now , but you can find pretty credible analysis article considering guerrilla forces in my other messages in this thread . 
  try and read geneva conventions already . 
  it 's not that difficult . 
  dont judge others by yourself . 
  that 's interesting . 
  could you provide a source on that espionage thing , please ? 
  nowhere in geneva conventions wearing the uniform of some country is required . 
  as explained [ here ] ( http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1622&amp;context=iclr ) , `` articles 43 and 44 of protocol i provide liberalized criteria for combatancy and prisoner-of-war status . 
  essentially requiring that the combatant distinguish himself by carrying arms openly during military deployments and engagements , the new criteria are designed to balance the military needs of guerrilla fighters with humanitarian concerns for the civilian populace . '' so , say , a military car drives by , and is jumped by guys in civilian openly carrying arms - ok . military car drives by seemingly unarmed , harmless civilians , and is suddenly attacked with concealed arms - act of perfidy , not ok . 
   what you ca n't do is pretend to be a civilian . 
  yes , but that does n't mean `` do n't wear civilian clothes '' ( although wearing civilian clothes is indeed pretty close ) . 
  what is prohibited is perfidy , and one example of perfidy given in geneva conventions is '' the feigning of civilian , non-combatant status '' . 
  so it 's not only looking like civilian , but also acting like civilian , non-combatant , not `` fair game '' . 
  it is explained further [ here ] ( http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1622&amp;context=iclr ) : `` articles 43 and 44 of protocol i provide liberalized criteria for combatancy and prisoner-of-war status . 
  essentially requiring that the combatant distinguish himself by carrying arms openly during military deployments and engagements , the new criteria are designed to balance the military needs of guerrilla fighters with humanitarian concerns for the civilian populace . 
   it is very illegal to be a soldier masquerading as a civilian . 
  source ? 
  because there 's [ that  ( https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/irrc_853_pfanner.pdf ) `` third geneva convention shows , furthermore , that members of regular armed forces -- as opposed to irregular armed forces -- are combatants owing to their affiliation with a party to an international armed conflict and do not have to fulfil specific constitutive criteria -- including a distinctive sign and in particular the wearing of a military uniform -- to qualify as prisoners of war in case of capture . '', 
  they are , if they are in the chain of command of separatist forces * or * if they are n't ( say some independent volunteer group ) but wear some visible distinct signs ( that may or may not be military uniform - this is n't defined by geneva conventions ) . 
   geneva convention also states that in order to be a lawful combatant , you have to wear a uniform that can be identified as certain country 's uniform . 
  [ except it does n't  ( https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/1595a804df7efd6bc125641400640d89/6fef854a3517b75ac125641e004a9e68?opendocument ) `` art 4 . 
  prisoners of war , in the sense of the present convention , are persons belonging to one of the following categories , who have fallen into the power of the enemy : ( 1 ) members of the armed forces of a party to the conflict , as well as members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces . '' ** here members of the armed forces of involved parties are n't required to had * any * uniform on them . 
  ** ( ~ ~ although i think that it is implied that `` official '' armed forces always have some kind of uniform ~ ~ nope , it 's apparently by affiliation , uniform is n't required ) . 
  `` ( 2 ) members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps , including those of organized resistance movements , belonging to a party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory , even if this territory is occupied , provided that such militias or volunteer corps , including such organized resistance movements , fulfil the following conditions : ( a ) that of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates ; ( b ) that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance ; ( c ) that of carrying arms openly ; ( d ) that of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war . '' ** here members of other militias , resistance groups etc. 
  are only required to have `` a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance '' . 
  ** also there 's this : `` should any doubt arise as to whether persons , having committed a belligerent act and having fallen into the hands of the enemy , belong to any of the categories enumerated in article 4 , such persons shall enjoy the protection of the present convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal . '' ** so even if there are no any signs , only `` competent tribunal '' can decide that they are not pows but just armed civilian criminals .
