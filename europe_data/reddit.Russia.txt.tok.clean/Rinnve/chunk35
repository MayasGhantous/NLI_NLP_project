  ** edit : [ this article ] ( https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/irrc_853_pfanner.pdf ) confirms it : `` third geneva convention shows , furthermore , that members of regular armed forces -- as opposed to irregular armed forces -- are combatants owing to their affiliation with a party to an international armed conflict and do not have to fulfil specific constitutive criteria -- including a distinctive sign and in particular the wearing of a military uniform -- to qualify as prisoners of war in case of capture . 
  at the same time , it is a misinterpretation of the geneva conventions to deny prisoner-of-war status to all captured combatants belonging to the regular armed forces of a state on the sole basis that they failed to wear a uniform . 
  however , individual members of regular armed forces can possibly violate the requirement of distinction from the civilian population when not wearing a uniform -- and especially in case of perfidy -- and can forfeit their status as prisoners of war . '', 
   then again i 've only got experience with 8.1 , the original version was probably a lot worse . 
  it was n't . 
  just start button went missing ( it appeared only when mouse cursor is near bottom left corner ) . 
  i really did n't understood all the fuss about win8 being unusable or too different , upgraded as soon as it was available . 
  after all , 100 iq is average by definition , and that 's already pretty dumb . 
  even microsoft office does n't fully support microsoft office documents ( between different versions ) . 
  i feel for their sysadmin . 
  something tells me that they did n't pay for ubuntu advantage which includes central management tools and costs $ 500 per year per 5 machines . 
  yeah . 
  or aidar just invents hardly-believable story to cover medical torture . 
  local anesthesia would be enough for fixing one 's shoulder . 
  `` do n't come to estonia , go to finland or somewhere . '' my sides just left earth . 
  after it does n't mean because of it . 
  there are other factors in work , like , i dunno , breaking economic ties with the country that accounts for largest part of imports and exports . 
  [ do you really think that ukrainian rebels or the annexation of crimea are the main cause of ukraine 's economic problems ? 
  ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:irq:ukr:rus:pol:kaz:lva:hun:tha:bwa:nam:ago&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ), 
  well , first i must tell that for me it 's intuitive : i never was good with the rules of russian language , it just feels * right * or * wrong * for me ( perhaps because i was reading a lot since i learned how to read ) . 
  this sentence about invasion and/or occupation just parses in my head as , uh , listing of things without uniting them . 
  actually , replacing comma with `` or '' feels wrong too , albeit less so than `` and '' . 
  i think the most correct way to replace it would be `` military invasion with or without occupation '' . 
  no , almost not controlled , vast majority of blocked sites are legitimate targets like cp , illicit drugs trade and promotion of real terrorism . 
  actually , internet is the main medium for the opposition in russia . 
  for example , any materials controversial to official position on ukraine are freely available . 
  the possibility of this is comparable to possibility of us invasion to russia . 
  both extremely unlikely . 
  ( hint : the russian territories bordering with china are n't terribly habitable . ), 
  the question in the poll was `` military invasion , occupation '' , and in russian language a comma in such sentence means `` or '' , not `` and '' . 
  so it accounts for anything from limited military invasion to total occupation . 
  [ so usa is n't west ? 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10769041/the-us-is-an-oligarchy-study-concludes.html ), 
   for the ones who had benefits from the privatizations , yes . 
  you 're confusing putin with yeltsin . 
  do you know anybody who actually watches zvezda ? 
   the u.s. had what , a 5 year period as the sole nuclear superpower after wwii ? 
  did they had enough nukes to make that much difference in possible war ? 
  mostly just the usa and its nato buddies . 
  not china , certainly . 
  http://www.levada.ru/12-05-2015/ugroza-dlya-rossii-so-storony-ssha this is the list of questions for those who view the us as a threat ( so multiply those numbers by 59 % ) : creating obstacles to the development of russia : 48 % establishing control over the russian economy : 40 % the imposition of alien ideas and values : 36 % the possibility of a military invasion , occupation : 31 % establishing control over the country 's political course : 24 % other : 1 % ca n't elaborate : 3 %, 
  the only invasion russians remember was during ww2 . 
  i find this very hard to believe , so please provide the source . 
  poland and especially baltics are n't considered here important enough to be an enemy or an adversary , at least on their own . 
  it 's 31 % out of those 59 % who view the us as a threat , so about 18 % of all participants of the survey . 
   to a russian , military force is a natural , even inevitable tool for the state to use . 
   l. todd wood , a graduate of the u.s. air force academy hypocrisy is strong in this one . 
   red army had highest number of personnel and actively participated in multiple military conflicts at the time . 
  claiming it was not ready for war is silly . 
  look at great successes of soviet army in 1941 !, 
  do you claim that in 1939 it was in a better state ? 
  judging by results of the winter war , i very much doubt it . 
   the worrying trend is a steadily growing acceptance of stalin by the russian state and the society at large . 
  other worrying trend is a steadily growing blacksmearing of soviet history . 
  `` at the expense of tens of millions of lives '' , seriously ? 
  if you 're going to exaggerate the numbers , at least do n't do it by orders of magnitude . 
  it 's too obvious . 
   ok so soviets were not ready to fight germans in 1939 but were ready to invade poland , baltics and finland . 
  great logic . 
  poland was nothing compared to german 's military . 
  finland appeared to be nothing , but it was a mistake for which soviets paid dearly . 
  baltics were intimidated , there were no military assault if i remember history correct . 
   in 1939 germany was most vulnerable . 
  with potential war on two fronts it would be easiest to defeat . 
  soviets fought japan in 1939 , it would be two fronts for them too . 
   nevertheless you can be almost certain that if su would join the war on polish side uk and france would intervene . 
  intervene ? 
  why ? 
  after all , in the real life the second front opened only after it was clear that ussr is going to win , with or without the help of the allies . 
  if su started the war in 1939 , it would be surely defeated . 
   i found at least three yeah , two of them in the middle of nowhere . 
  no wonder i have n't heard about it . 
   if it 's not permitted , it should have been dismantled , or there should have been some consequences for those who erected it ? 
  yes and yes . 
   you usually do n't erect monuments to those you consider guilty of crimes . 
  [ why not ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oliver_cromwell#monuments_and_posthumous_honours ) history is n't something black and white , after all . 
   the same can be said about hitler , yet they do n't build new monuments to him , on the account of having great autobahns in germany . 
  may be that 's because hitler led germans to disaster ? 
  because on the scales of good and evil hitler firmly shifts to the evil side , whereas stalin 's good deeds marginally outweight his evil , for some people , at least ? 
  those people obviously equate su and russia . 
  there are also people ( not those ) who adore stalin and/or su yet do n't equate su and russia . 
  when it comes to stupidity , there always are many options and choices . 
  and that 's relates to `` su = russia '' how , exactly ? 
   if russians themselves treat su as russia some russians . 
  some do n't . 
   russians were majority in su . 
  majority as in `` more than 50 % '' , not as in `` vast majority '' . 
   is it really that hard to understand that some people see su = russia ? 
  no , it is n't really hard at all to understand that some people are dumb and/or ignorant . 
   how many new monuments of stalin have been erected in russia just this year ? 
  eh , one , not officially permitted , as far as i know . 
  what it has to do with recognizing soviet crimes ? 
  stalin is highly controversial . 
  if not his fast-forwarding ussr to the industrial age ( which was indeed brutal and bloody ) , i doubt that ussr had a chance against germany . 
  because soviet army was n't ready in 1941 , and it was even more * not ready * in 1939 ? 
  because there were no guarantees that britain and france will help , and not just sit idly and wait while nazis and soviets exterminate each other ? 
  because poland was rabidly anti-soviet ? 
  because before katyn there were tens of thousands soviet pows who died in 1919-1922 because of inhumane conditions , and stalin hated poland 's guts for that ? 
  see , there are many reasons .
