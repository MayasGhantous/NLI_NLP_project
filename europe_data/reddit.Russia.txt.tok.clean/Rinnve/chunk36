   i think russians have same problem . 
  whataboutism much ? 
  some russians do , sure . 
  this does n't excuse ukrainians or other ex-ussr people , though . 
  ( yeah , * some * ukrainians , that would be more correct , perhaps , but i observe such attitude far too often . ), 
   at least modern ukraine recognizes soviet crimes as such yeah , and distances from it at the same time . 
  when was last time somebody 's big on ukrainian political landscape admitted that ukraine did took part in soviet wrongdoings ? 
  that ukraine * was * soviet , part of the system , and not just innocent oppressed nation ? 
  and russia recognizes soviet crimes just as well . 
  putin never mentions stalin without noting that his regime was criminal and oppressive . 
   ww2 remembrance into the aggressive cockfest please let * us * decide how we want to celebrate victory over nazism . 
   how on earth there was possibility of direct confrontation when countries did not share a boarder ? 
  i dunno , by crushing poland and moving german border all way east ? 
  may be in your imaginary russia . 
  and this pact was signed . 
  and in that sense i agree with the opinion of our minister of culture that there was sense in that pact for ensuring the security of the ussr . '' ( translation mine ), 
  ah , the usual logic of former soviets . 
  when it 's about bad side of the ussr , it always `` russia = soviet '' , but when it 's about something good , only then you remember that ussr was not only russian , but also ukrainian , kazakh etc. 
  how many ukrainian soviets were tried for soviet crimes , huh ? 
   at least some of them were involved in street clashes with pro-ukrainians that was different group , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  also , street clashes and deliberate burning people alive are on completely different levels of wrong . 
  and being * glad * that people died that horrible death is again whole new level of moral deformity . 
  this sad excuse for a human being is glad that 40 innocent people in odessa were burned alive , and something says me that you are n't any better . 
   just glad we burned our fucktards in odessa a year ago i 'm an atheist , but i hope you 'll burn in hell . 
   armed forces only bomb the locations of separatists forces you mean like that air strike in the middle of lugansk in 02.06.2014 , or countless indiscriminate grad attacks in the general direction of separatist forces that hit nothing but civilians ? 
   the ussr was responsible for tens of millions of deaths . 
  tens of milliards , actually . 
  why do n't crank it up to eleven why you 're at it , anyways ? 
   without led-lease they would n't have any transport either , rail or road that 's a myth . 
  as of 1945 , only 1/3 of cars in russian army were imported , and it was way less in say 1942 or 1943 . 
  more or less the same for trains : about 2000 locomotives were delivered , but ussr already had about 20000 locomotives before the war . 
  i mean yes , it is important , significant part , but it 's not like `` without led-lease they would n't have any transport either , rail or road '' . 
  do n't forget that majority of lend-leased goods was delivered in the second part of gpw ( sorry for russian bias ) , when the worst was already behind ( again , sorry for russian bias ) . 
  arguably the greatest help was n't technology , but raw materials , food and fuel . 
  for instance , according to different sources , from 2/5 to 2/3 of aviation fuel used by russian air forces was imported . 
  and there are many very positive reports on lend-leased food ( '' \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0448\u0451\u043d\u043a\u0430 '' , american canned stew , is in like every second russian book on gpw - as are studebaker cars , though ) . 
  it was very useful , though . 
  anastas mikoyan ( basically trade minister of stalin 's ussr ) [ estimates ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%cb%e5%ed%e4-%eb%e8%e7#.d0.9e.d0.b1.d1.8a.d1.91.d0.bc.d1.8b_.d0.bf.d0.be.d1.81.d1.82.d0.b0.d0.b2.d0.be.d0.ba_.d0.b8_.d0.b7.d0.bd.d0.b0.d1.87.d0.b5.d0.bd.d0.b8.d0.b5_.d0.bb.d0.b5.d0.bd.d0.b4-.d0.bb.d0.b8.d0.b7.d0.b0 ) that without usa 's aid it would 've took an year or year and a half longer to defeat nazis than it took in reality . 
  ( source in russian only , sorry . ), 
  you broke my bullshit ` o'meter . 
  yeah , it 's not like stalin wanted military alliance with uk and france against nazi germany 's threat ... oh wait . 
   it would make sense if it said kiev or something but rome ? 
  because it rhymes . 
  do n't read too deep into this , i doubt that whoever did this even heard about the `` third rome '' idea . 
  it 's too deep for this kind of retardation . 
  there are no historical documents proving that holodomor was intentional , or that it was aimed at ukrainians . 
  there are also historical documents proving attempts of soviet government to contain the situation , which again contradicts the idea of holodomor being genocide . 
  `` `` the stalin regime never aimed to exterminate entire ethnic groups , '' the russian president said during his televised phone-in last month . '' what a nice example of creative citation . 
  full line : [ '' ** even taking into account the ugliness of the stalinist regime , all repressions , exiles of entire nations , ** the regime never set the goal of exterminating entire peoples . 
  '' ] ( http://tass.ru/en/russia/789871 ) ( it was about `` attempts to equalize '' nazis and soviets . ), 
  those `` inside communists '' were in hundreds of thousands , and more for some ethnicites : [ as of 01.01.1989 , there were more than 3 million ukrainian communists , about 700 thousand belarussian , 490 thousand uzbek , 400 thousand khazakh communists etc. 
  ] ( http://www.polisportal.ru/files/file/puvlication/starie_publikacii_polisa/t/1991-2-3-tishkov_nacionalnost-kommunist.pdf ) so were all those people `` technically and physically russians '' or not ? 
   they ruled , their languagge was used in the whole nation , their history people learned . 
  this is incorrect on all accounts . 
  communist party ruled , as a system , and there were all kinds of ethnicities in there . 
  every ssr learned their own national language besides russian , and it was official on the regional level . 
  same with the history . 
  `` time is the simplest thing '' . 
   soviets was technically and physically russians . 
  except they were not . 
  soviets were russians , ukrainians , georgians , belarussians , jews and others . 
  this has nothing to do with any `` stigma '' , it 's about historical facts . 
   really , if russians build so much of industry , why there is not even a shadow of it now ? 
  soviets ( not russians , please ) built much of industry , but it was n't autonomous . 
  remember , soviet economy was planned on the largest levels , they did n't even thought about what happens to factories in lithuania or latvia if they ca n't get critical components from other factories in other parts of the ussr . 
  another important part is that the quality of consumer products in ussr was n't really competitive with what was produced in the west ( and even in some countries of the eastern bloc ) . 
  ussr focused on what was important for the country in general , more or less ignoring individual people . 
  `` there would be , by morning , guts strung along the fence and men with their throats slashed ragged and girl children carried off . 
  not here , not where it was being told , but always somewhere else . 
  and the people would believe . 
  they 'd believe everything they heard . '' c. simak was a wise , wise man . 
   i . . just do n't literally even . . that 's because you did n't live in russia before putin , in the nineties . 
  if you think that contemporary russia is corrupt and criminal , and it 's economy is in trouble ... well . 
  i 'd say it 's about 5/10 on a general trouble scale . 
  the nineties - crank it up to eleven . 
  are you sure you 're talking with me and not with voices in your head ? 
  source : totally not biased book named `` forms of delirium '' . 
  is there one reason to trust it ? 
  yes , intermarriage is quite common . 
  i dont have exact statistics , but anything except going way out of one 's race ( like in slav-negro or slav-chinese ) is n't something to write home about ; and even those marriages are more of curiosity thing , not something looked down upon . 
  of course , bigots and backwards people can be found everywhere , but generally ethnicity of a pair is n't even discussed ( in the sense like in `` how my buddy ivan could marry that armenian slut '' , not like `` damn , ivan got lucky with that armenian hottie '' ) central asian immigrants are n't liked not because they are central asian . 
  they are n't liked because they 're generally poor educated , dirty ( i mean literally dirty , like in not paying enough attention to personal hygiene ) and , most importantly , tend to bring their own customs here and ignore local customs and culture . 
  in other words , they do n't integrate and they do n't even want to integrate . 
  i ca n't even . 
  are you aware that this is not my comment ? 
  i said what ? 
  what exactly is untrue ? 
  that it was n't authorised demonstration ? 
  or that `` proper democratic '' countries like germany , france or usa also restrict unauthorised demonstrations ? 
  for unauthorised demonstration . 
  those laws are not unique to russia . 
   because all i can see in your comment is schadenfreude exactly . 
  i can be rather unpleasant and dumb after sixth bottle of beer . 
   that is n't bias . 
  it is bias when it 's always `` not the main subject of the article '' ( read : swept under the carpet ) . 
  that 's not an argument . 
   i thought tatars were darker and looked more asian than russians . 
  yeah , but not enough to consider them a different race . 
  no , like in '' \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 '' , ethnically russian . 
  i guess being russian is more of cultural thing than of genes .
