   is there a lot of ethnic discrimination in russia ? 
  russia is big , and i can talk only about what i observed . 
  no , where i live , there is n't a lot of ethnic discrimination ; seldom you can hear some ethic slurs like '' \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0431\u0430\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0447\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0438 '' ( `` freaking chocks '' , `` chock '' being ethnic slur for people from caucasian region ) , especially from lower educated people ( and some higher educated people tend to be rather anti-semitic for some reason ) , but i do n't remember when it got further than just words . 
  there are reports of ethnic-based crimes in bigger cities , though . 
  poor romanians . 
  siding with genocidal maniac and taking a happy part in the holocaust was n't a great idea after all , was it ? 
   ukrainians hating russians eh , more like ukrainians hating poles and jews . 
  [ upa did some fucked up things back then . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_insurgent_army#ethnic_cleansing_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_galicia ), 
   do you guys have like a different name for people of mixed origins nope , not really . 
  there is '' \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0441 '' ( metis ) and '' \u043c\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0442 '' ( mulatto ) , but it 's for people of mixed races ( usually black + white ) , at least i never heard or read it about mixed ethnicities . 
   or everyone is russian ? 
  ethnical identity is more like personal preference here . 
  i mean , yeah , if somebody 's purely tatar or buryat , he ( she ) will most probably self-identify as such . 
  somebody of mixed blood ( say 1/4 tatar 1/4 buryat 1/4 russian 1/4 jew ) usually ends up being russian , its simpler that way . 
  they all are russian citizens though , it often gets mixed up in translation ( '' \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 '' usually means `` russian '' as in ethnicity , '' \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0438\u043d '' means `` russian '' as in citizenship ) . 
   you 'd be hard pressed to believe any of them support putin . 
  why ? 
  yeah , you 're about correct . 
  first one is perfect . 
  healthy dose of lulz and readable symbolics combined . 
  i think calling it genocide is wrong because it equals it with holocaust or other historical examples of massive ethnic cleansing , where people were deliberately murdered just because of their ethnicity . 
  this is bad because it distorts our view of the history . 
  holodomor had several factors in play , some natural , some human . 
  the lesson to be learned here is that human negligence and , frankly speaking , stupidity on so many levels can sometimes play all in tune and compose a song of death and destruction . 
  the worst part is that ill intent , like in `` real '' genocide , is not needed at all . 
  implying that countries have feelings . 
  they do n't . 
  people do . 
  crimea 's people generally are happy with what happened , and this is the only thing that matters . 
  ( before `` but but millions of monies ukraine invested in crimea '' - no , they did n't invest jack shit after the dissolution of the ussr ; crimean infrastructure is in shambles . ), 
  `` when it 's a question of action against the slavs , you can always count on romania '' ( \u0441 ) i. antonescu, 
  do you even read shit you post ? 
  [ `` but how many people is he responsible for killing ? 
  in february 1989 , two years before the fall of the soviet union , a research paper by georgian historian roy aleksandrovich medvedev published in the weekly tabloid argumenti i fakti '' ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/how-many-people-did-joseph-stalin-kill-1111789 ) those impossible numbers mentioned in this article contradict with * everything * . 
  they contradict with unclassified party archives . 
  they contradict with census data . 
  they contradict with people 's memory . 
  they contradict with actual history being researched by actual historians . 
  this medvedev is n't historian , by the way , and he says so himself : [ `` \u042f \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a . 
  it is a cliche created by mass media . 
  [ ... ] i never had the skills of professional historian , i did n't work in archives '', 
  academics do n't publish `` research papers '' in the weekly fucking * tabloid * ( which is also pretty shitty even for a tabloid ) . 
  so pointing at grossly exaggerated historical facts ( and * invented * numbers ) is now `` defending stalin '' , right ? 
  well , sorry for not eating up western `` history '' tales about insane blood-thirsty stalin . 
  sorry for having critical mind and being reasonably educated . 
   though you might want to listen to this video of red army veteran what 's the name of this `` veteran '' and why while the banner on the video says '' \u0422\u0412 \u0425\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a - \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442 \u041f\u043e\u0434\u0448\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430 '' ( tv artist - podshivalov 's project ) , there is no such video on the site of said project ? 
  in other words , is there * one * reason to believe this video ? 
  your reading comprehension is really bad . 
  i 'm not manipulating anything . 
  i 'm not even discussing ukraine entering eu . 
  i 'm talking about people [ who talk like this event is in the foreseeable future ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/32kvlk/russia_seeks_to_break_eu_unity_on_ukraine_slovak/cqcbzyd ) . 
  ( hell , we do n't even know * if * ukraine will be able to transform itself the right way ! ), 
   stalin killed between 20m and 60m people between 20 and 60 trillion people , actually . 
  get your facts damn straight already . 
  people here talk about ukraine entering eu in the foreseeable future , and it is * i * who makes shit up ? 
  this is nuts . 
   when 's the last time putin publicly reached out to muslims in russia , or publicly referred to them favourably ? 
   want me to do a quick search for the word `` towel-head '' in / r/russia ? 
  or much worse words talking about muslims in a negative way ? 
  please do . 
  it would be very entertaining . 
   i thought many lithuanian jews also lost their lives during ww2 , so that maybe you would understand how we feel . 
  [ with the help of lithuanian collaborators ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_holocaust_in_lithuania#participation_of_local_collaborators ) , so i doubt it . 
  that 's rich . 
  open your market , get rid of your rich neighbour that pretty much sponsors the half of your economy , and may be you will enter eu . 
  * may be . 
  * may be that will even happen in xxi century . 
  just like turkey ... oh wait . 
  name any serious politician that proposes to allow ukraine enter eu . 
  not some accession agreement with possibility of entering in some not so short future ( say , half a century or so ) , but ... say , before 2020 . 
  entering eu has nothing to do with being `` ex-socialist '' and everything to do with things like democracy , corruption level , economic stability etc. 
  nobody sane was talking about ukraine entering eu , it was about opening ukraine 's markets and such ( and indirectly harming russia 's economy : either russia 's closes free trade agreements with ukraine or get rekt by massive income of cheap europeans goods via ukraine - which can seem good in short term , but destroys local production in long term ) . 
   if ukraine entered eu not sure if serious . 
  not sure if sane . 
  second is quite easy to debunk : after just about every terrorist act committed by radical islamists , state tv pushes the idea that `` normal '' muslims condemn those acts ( usually by interviewing muslim religious authorities ) . 
  islam was * never * displayed as a `` religion of terrorists '' or something like that . 
  about first , what exactly means that orthodoxy is `` unfairly represented '' ? 
  after all , the majority of russian citizens * are * orthodox , at least on paper . 
  bullshit on both accounts . 
  state religion ? 
  muslim tatars and buddhist buryats would like to have a word with you . 
  witnessed reverse racism once , a year ago or so . 
  a student from nigeria hanged out in local bar with his local ( obviously white ) buddies , and told some joke in line with `` wild negro '' and `` white masters '' . 
  thanks , i wo n't , not for much longer anyway , 
   if you dismiss part of the history except those parts are * not * dismissed . 
  they are in history books , everyone learns that . 
  what else do you want ? 
   soviets help start the war that lead to 27 millions dead on their side that again ? 
  you forgot appeasement by uk and fr , you forgot usa banks financing hitler , you forgot a ton of other things besides ussr actions . 
  if you think that without m.-r . pact germany would n't attack poland , think again . 
   both countries allow hitler to whatever he pleases to avoid war at any price and you believe those countries would go to war with su ? 
  it matters not what i believe . 
  stalin and soviet government did n't rule out this possibility . 
   can you tell me exactly where is a german/su border ? 
  you mean , before or after germany takes poland ? 
  stalin was pretty sure that poland is doomed if germany attacks it . 
  both available from [ here ] ( http://www.alleng.ru/edu/hist4.htm ) ( obviously pirated ) . 
   on the shy part you just say few words and do not come back to this . 
  so what ?
