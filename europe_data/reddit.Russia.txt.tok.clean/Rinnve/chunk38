  pretty much every country had their `` shy parts '' of wwii business . 
   ah that 's the reason . 
  well poles/jews/estonians / others also were to be eradicated . 
  wonder how they name each part of war . 
  are you jelly that we have a special name for a part of war that killed 27 million ussr citizens ? 
  i think we kind of have the right to name it how we see fit . 
   stalin was not forced to ally with anybody . 
  that is a myth . 
  no it 's not . 
   you seem to believe that europe was war hungry at that time and war was inevitable . 
  not i. soviet government . 
   uk/france were not willing to go to war against anybody . 
  so what ? 
  there was n't any guarantee that they would n't join germany in attacking ussr , or at least help hitler somehow ? 
  after all , pretty much all governments disliked or outright hated ussr . 
   hitler did n't even have a boarder with su so how could he attack you guys ? 
  are you even serious ? 
   russians i met on reddit clearly use wii and gpw interchangeably that 's because gpw was the part that affected russia . 
   in my opinion soviets came up with this terminology to cover the first part where they were allied with hitler . 
  to cover ? 
  it was and is in history books . 
  it is presented as a necessary measure , and the secret part of the pact was n't discussed until after ussr , but it was n't `` covered up '' . 
   i 've never heard from americans to have special name for wwii after pearl harbour . 
  or italians for the part when they switched . 
  that 's because nobody fought them in order to * eradicate them * . 
  there is n't a single family in russia that did n't lost somebody in that war . 
   i do n't get why people look for excuses when their country ( in your case it is not even your country ) do sth wrong . 
  excuses ? 
  i 'm sorry , but i read how ussr `` started the wwii with hitler '' on daily basis . 
  how often you read about usa banks financing hitler or half-assed uk and france attempts at dimplomacy with ussr that eventually forced stalin to kind of ally with * somebody * ? 
  how often you read that before poland fell victim , they `` allied '' with germany and partitioned czechoslovakia ? 
   first and foremost you seem to believe that soviet union had to be in any alliance . 
  not with uk/fr than with germany . 
  why ? 
  because either that or there is a chance that germany allies with uk/fr against ussr while ussr fights with japan on the east . 
   second that deal was impossible to achieve because su suggested placing red army in poland . 
  and poland could not agree the deal was n't with poland , though , nobody asked poland if i 'm not mistaken . 
   and poland could not agree on that because we know from 1945 what happens if soviet union comes to a country . 
  speaking of ridiculous arguments , this is a winner . 
  last time i checked , diplomats do n't use crystal ball or other devices to see the future . 
   is there a special name for the period before 1941 and after the partitioning of poland with nazi german ? 
   how much do people generally know about the annexation of the baltics and attack on finland about the baltics , not much . 
  in basic schoolbooks it is kind of glossed over . 
  in advanced , well ... here is a question from the unified state exam on history : `` read the controversial point of view : `` signing a non-aggression pact with nazi germany and the additional secret protocol was diplomatic success for the ussr . '', 
  give two arguments for and two arguments against it . '' and the expected answers are : `` for : 1 . 
  it provided additional time for re-equipment of the army and strengthening the country . 
  it allowed to annex new territories that remained in the ussr after wwii . 
  against : 1 . 
  it allowed germany to conquer half of europe , leading to increased potential for the german troops . 
  the ussr , by signing this pact , acted as an aggressor against the baltic states , finland , romania , poland . '' so yes , official point of view is that it was an act of aggression against the baltics . 
  common people ( not historians or , say , diplomats ) know little about it , but then again common people tend to not know the history at all , except may be most significant events . 
  as for attack on finland , well , yeah , most people know about it , it 's called `` the winter war '' , people know that it was the ussr who was an aggressor , but that 's it . 
  ** edit : ** it turned out that in modern history books ( even basic level ) there * is * info about baltics , and it is presented as ussr forced them to sign `` treaties of mutual assistance '' and installed `` people 's governments '' ( written like that , in quotes , implying that they were n't in fact democratic ) . 
  there was n't anything when i was in school twenty years ago . 
   the fact that they do not call it wwii but great patriotic war and date it start in 1941 this is n't `` the fact '' . 
  this is bullshit . 
  we distinguish between wwii in general , which started in 1939 , and the part of it starting after germany attacked ussr . 
   su contributed greatly to hitler success at the early stage of the war so did pretty much all of europe , and [ usa pretty much financed his rise to power . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar ) molotov-ribbentrop pact was signed only after gb and france refused to work with ussr against germany . 
  yes , he was being racist : the text implies that people on the video are inferior . 
  you 've missed the point of valentina 's tweet , though . 
  it is not about racism . 
  it is not about comparing white people with black people . 
  it is about forcing people to dress like their ancestors dressed long time ago in order to entertain other people , and how this contradicts with ukraine 's movement `` towards european values '' . 
   she used it as an insult . 
  why do you think so ? 
  it is pretty clear to * me * that it is not an insult , at least not to those people . 
  she compares teachers * forced * to wear medieval clothes to tribal men , dancing in traditional garbs , entertaining tourists . 
  what she says is that noble and complex profession - teacher - is being reduced to entertaining their `` patriotic '' bosses . 
   it was meant as an insult because she likely views blacks as primitive and tribal . 
  those black men on the picture are * performers * . 
  yes , they * perform * as if they are primitive and tribal , even if all of them are phds . 
  thing is , i do n't think they were forced to perform , may be it 's their job , may be they are just having some fun , whatever , either way is completely ok with me . 
  but on the other picture we see people who are * forced * to perform as if they are medieval farmers . 
  this is where i see the insult , and not by her , but by bosses of those teachers . 
  misinformation ? 
  why do you think so ? 
  `` new school year begins in odessa ** with teachers forced to wear ukrainian tribal dress ** , a truly european custom  '' bold font shows the only insult i managed to find here , and it is not made by her . 
  well , unless you 're racist and being compared with black people is insulting for you . 
   she basically claimed ukrainians are literally savages/subhumans considering that she is ukrainian too , i think you 've misunderstood her message . 
  ( another thing is that it 's kind of hard to understood what she meant to say : judging by those tweets she is n't very bright . ), 
  debunked : http://masterok.livejournal.com/2023250.html tl ; dr : russian blogger anton vuima repeated the experiment in st.petersburg , in less than 20 seconds 8 people asked if help is needed . 
  received a very specific answer that they were not aiming to show the truth , and they just wanted to prove that in russia nobody will offer help . '' ), 
  this is brilliant . 
  i 'm not trying to justify anything . 
  but saying that s.u. 
  was `` incredibly nationalistic '' is immensely ignorant . 
  you ca n't be further from truth . 
   soviet union was an incredibly nationalistic state [ i do n't even . 
  ] ( http://cdn.head-fi.org/4/43/4334ce96_impliedfacepalmcensored.jpg ), 
  in our country clear political , legal and moral assessment was done to the atrocities of the totalitarian regime . 
  and this assessment is not to be changed . '' ( translation mine . ), 
  upvoted for the greater good . 
  seriously , we need more stuff like this . 
   claiming that russia should not inherit the historical crimes of the ussr is extremely dubious . 
  i do n't argue with that . 
  the question is , why ukraine , georgia and other former parts of ussr do n't get at least part of the blame ? 
  why it is all loaded on russians ? 
  because they were the majority in ussr ? 
  guess what nation suffered most during ussr regime .
