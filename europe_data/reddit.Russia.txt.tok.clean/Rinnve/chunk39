  significantly more than half of people who were imprisoned , forcibly relocated or simply executed during ussr years were russians . 
   part of being a russian means taking responsibility for the crimes of your countrymen whether or not your ancestors were directly involved . 
  ussr was n't only russian , you know . 
  many high ranked party officials were ukrainians and jews , stalin himself was georgian . 
  yet i do n't remember ukraine or georgia being blamed for katyn or other crimes of ussr regime . 
   so , your point is we ca n't judge a person who started a war if you 're talking about ukraine , `` ato '' there was initiated by ukrainian government , and it 's ukrainian army who started to use heavy weapons . 
  i kind of agree with `` other russians '' , but parents or grandparents ? 
  do n't think so . 
  i do n't know of anybody whose family was sucked in the meatgrinder of gulag and who did n't hate stalin 's * guts * , and entire soviet system for that matter . 
   it is easy to find sacrifices justified , if it 's other people who have to make the sacrifices . 
  my point is that this sentence is false . 
  that 's it . 
  what in the previous sentence is unclear to you ? 
   it is easy to find sacrifices justified , if it 's other people who have to make the sacrifices . 
  [ more than 50 % of victums of the gulag system were russians .

   can any group of people declare that they do not want to live in given country and secede only to be annex by the other state . 
  they can , of course : georgia did just that when they seceded from the ussr . 
  will the state be annexed by the other state , it 's for people to decide . 
  yes , it conflicts with the principle of integrity of the state , and there is no simple universal solution for that problem . 
   because abkhazia or ossetia were never independent . 
  they were n't completely independent , but they were n't always a part of georgia either . 
  abkhazia , for example , was once under ottoman rule , then it was absorbed by russian empire , and then ussr leaders joined it to georgia . 
  under ussr , abkhaz people were oppressed and `` georgified '' , so it 's no surprise that after collapse of ussr abkazhia wanted to split . 
  i like how you evade inconvenient questions . 
   nevertheless lack of international recognition makes those states absolutely dependant on russia . 
   accuses russia nonetheless . 
  perfect logic . 
   can we at least agree that russia does all the things on that list as well ? 
  can we at least agree about nonexistent things ? 
  name one foreign channel that was banned in russia . 
  name one neonazi march that was n't prosecuted later . 
  name one private company that was seized on pretext of `` pro-ukrainian '' or `` pro-west '' activities without due process ? 
  etc etc. 
  putin may be quite an authorian , but brutal dictatorship , really ? 
  you 're high on western propaganda . 
  do n't know about transnstria , but i would n't recommend saying to any abkhaz or ossetin that his state is an artificial creation made by russia . 
  or rather , say it , if you want a new face . 
   what you 're listing is putins handbook , not that of the ukraine administration name one thing from this list that did not happen in ukraine recently . 
   should be, 
  you do n't understand . 
  putin is dictator , everything and everybody is state-controlled in russia . 
  everyone who disagrees is an obvious kremlin shill . 
   the very quote from meduza not from meduza , but from former director of this museum . 
  i do n't know your level of russian , but for me his sarcasm is very obvious : '' \u0434\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0413\u0423\u041b\u0410\u0413\u0430 '' ( intentional controversy is obvious for everyone who read `` gulag archipelago '' which is mandatory read in russian schools ) , '' \u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434 '' ( pathos copying official ussr propaganda lines ) , '' \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0441 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u044b '' ( many inmates of perm-36 were banderovtsy , one can argue about how nazi there were , but they in fact did some really bad things ) . 
  of course he 's pissed that he 's no longer in control . 
  will the museum really be used for `` celebrating the gulag '' is yet to be seen . 
  considering that the main gulag museum in moscow is alive and well , i doubt it . 
  well , there is a difference between `` showcase the technical means used to keep prisoners detained '' and `` celebrating the gulag '' . 
  yes , you are correct . 
  perm-36 is the last remaining camp of original gulag system . 
  i failed to find any original news about `` glorifying the guards '' , though . 
  no , perm-36 is n't the only gulag museum , not even [ the main . 
  ] ( http://www.gmig.ru/ ), 
   most countries in the world ( including the united states ) do n't recognize it as a genocide http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/bills-108hres356eh/pdf/bills-108hres356eh.pdf `` in the house of representatives , u.s. , october 20 , 2003 . 
  [ ... ] whereas the final report of the united states government 's commission on the ukraine famine , established on december 13 , 1985 , concluded that the victims were `` starved to death in a man-made famine '' and that `` joseph stalin and those around him committed genocide against ukrainians in 1932 -- 1933 '' '' here you are . 
  all the usual things : some historical facts are ignored , some twisted , a lie or two here and there . 
  i especially like how they totally ignored millions of non-ukrainians who died too . 
  `` blockade of food shipment '' also looks very interesting , given that unclassified ussr documents tell that central government did sent food and grain to affected areas . 
  but if you 're willing to live in the imaginary world , as you say , whatever floats your boat . 
  if you 're honest , then i seriously recommend you to read solid history books on the topic , like i 've already linked ( prof. s.g. wheatcroft dedicated all his life to study that period of soviet history , his research is unmatched ) . 
  the famine of 1932-1933 was painted as genocide , first by nazis , then by the west during cold war ( and after it ) , always for propaganda reasons , but historical facts paint a picture way more complex than that . 
  or you can prefer more common black-and-white kind of `` history '' . 
   as for sources we are learning about the famine in history class in canada and it is portrayed as a genocide . 
   in canada we learn about the holocaust every year since we are very young but never about any other genocide such as the holodomor are you a paid troll , or just not very bright ? 
  what else , then ? 
  i do n't remember any sane russian being proud of genocide . 
   the other is proud of genociding poles and has nukes vladimir putin on katyn : [ `` these crimes can not be justified . 
  in our country , we have a clear political , legal , moral evaluation of the crimes of the totalitarian regime . 
  and this evaluation is not subject to any revisions . '' ] ( http://www.hro.org/node/7908 ) proud , eh ? 
  it is always sad to observe how easy people can be brainwashed . 
  i hope you will get better . 
   as for sources we are learning about the famine in history class in canada and it is portrayed as a genocide . 
  and we learnt specifically that it was targeted against ukrainians and ukrainian nationalism . 
  `` portrayed '' . 
  exactly . 
  read some serious book on the topic already , and stop spreading propaganda . 
  i 'd recommend [ `` the years of hunger '' ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-years-hunger-agriculture-industrialisation/dp/0333311078 ) , it is massive , but it is the most comprehensive and unbiased work on this topic . 
   but the famine was orected at ukraine to get rid of the kulaks and get rid of ukrainian nationalism . 
  there are * no * sources that prove that . 
  zero . 
  nil . 
  if you say that famine was `` directed '' at ukraine , why then huge russian regions to the east and to the south of ukraine suffered greatly from the same famine , while some ukrainian regions did n't ? 
   and yes stalin was oh so antinationalistic . 
  he just accidentally applied russification . 
  accidentally ? 
  no , of course , russian culture is bigger and hence more useful as a cultural glue in a multinational state . 
  i must remind you that stalin himself was n't russian . 
  i hope you know how to read maps . 
  look here : http://img2.tfd.com/wiki/1/17/holodomor_famine_map.jpg each time you want to tell stories about how ukraine was targeted in holodomor , look again at that map . 
  as for nationalism , stalin 's policy was generally antinationalistic , be it ukrainian or kazakh or any other type of nationalism . 
  so what ? 
  it 's not like stalin assumed direct control over them . 
  just the opposite , i very much doubt that stalin wanted holodomor to happen . 
  but local party officers were too afraid to report smaller than usual harvests , or may be they wanted promotion , or whatever . 
  but no , stalin was the monster , while actual little monsters who made holodomor reality are forgotten . 
  that does n't change the fact that it was carried out not by somebody `` external '' , but by their own compatriots who often lived in the same villages all the time . 
   `` the rebelious counter-revolutionary people ~ ~ on ukraine ~ ~ are harming our plans of development , they need to be punished with sanctions and death penalties , ~ ~ and if they do n't comply , they 'll have to starve . ~ ~ '' this way it sounds closer to reality . 
  there are no documents that prove there were intention to starve people . 
  and guess what ?
