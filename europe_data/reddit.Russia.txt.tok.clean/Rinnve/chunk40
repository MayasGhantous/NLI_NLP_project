  application of punishments , sanctions etc. 
  was carried out not by stalin , but by local ukrainian ( in ukraine ) , russian ( in russia ) or kazakh ( in kazakhstan ) party officers . 
  in a sense , ukrainians were starved to death by another ukrainians . 
   idea of the famine being intentionally aimed towards ethnic ukrainians . 
  that idea is a disgrace to the memory of millions of russians and kazakhs who starved to death during that famine . 
   the holodomor was also targeted at ukrainians . 
  except it was n't . 
  many russians and kazakhs died in that famine as well as ukrainians ; and it was n't `` targeted '' like in `` let 's starve some people '' , it was n't intentional ( there are many historical documents about food help sent by central government when it realised the extent of its agricultural fuckup ) . 
  yeah , according to one very fishy report which also managed to find about 30 ( iirc ) slaves in iceland . 
  exactly . 
  nope : http://ria.ru/society/20150316/1052740079.html tl ; dr : she tweeted that `` her friends exaggerated a bit ; it was a good dinner with good wine '' ( translation not word-to-word ) . 
  you should ask that ikea , not me . 
  the same ikea , i might add , [ that removed women from their catalogue in saudi arabia ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/ikea-deleted-women-saudi-version-catalogue-121409342--finance.html ) . 
   the idea that merely acknowledging that homosexual couples exist is somehow ` propaganda ' is absurd beyond reason . 
  yes , it is . 
  that 's why russian law about `` gay propaganda '' does not defines said `` propaganda '' as `` merely acknowledging existence of homosexual couples '' . 
  not the first time russia-24 fucked up . 
  remember infamous 146 % of votes ? 
  yep , that 's them too . 
  i was thinking about another comment . 
  ca n't find it right now , but it was something about sitting in australia and enjoying the view while russia and usa mutually destroy themselves . 
   some upvoted guy said that a war between russia was n't a problem because australia will be left eh , that was obvious / s and a nod to `` on the beach '' ( beautiful and very depressing novel ) . 
  i 'd rather trust world bank and cia data and well-trusted methods of estimating inequality over previously unheard method of counting billionaires . 
  are you having trouble understanding basic inequality indicators ? 
   35 % of all the wealth in russia is owned by 110 oligarchs , making it one of the most unequal countries in the world 1 ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality 2 ) sort by world bank gini estimate 1 . 
  south africa ... 14 . 
  brazil ... 27 . 
  mexico ... 60 . 
  usa ... 66 . 
  russia not even in top 25 . 
  over estimates give similar results . 
  so pls , stop spreading false information and propaganda . 
  probably because many european languages have more straightforward pronunciation rules ( compared to english ) , when , say , the `` k '' sound is always represented with the letter `` k '' ? 
   from the start , euromaidan was a political movement , not an ethnic movement . 
  no , it 's like saying that hitler is innocent because he did n't kill all those jews and slavs himself . 
  do i need to quote bandera 's letters when he openly discuss which people of which ethnicities are `` unwanted '' and should be killed ? 
  may be he did n't ordered this massacre . 
  but his ideas were * directly * behind it , very much unlike nietzsche ( who did say exactly * nothing * about ethnic cleansing ) . 
  [ `` the peak of the massacres took place in july and august 1943 . 
  most of the victims were women and children . 
  [ 4 ] the actions of the upa resulted in 35,000-60 ,000 polish deaths in volhynia and 25,000-40 ,000 in eastern galicia . 
  [ ... ] the killings were directly linked with the policies of the bandera faction of the organization of ukrainian nationalists and its military arm , the ukrainian insurgent army , whose goal specified at the second conference of the stepan bandera faction of the organization of ukrainian nationalists ( oun-b ) during 17 -- 23 february 1943 ( or march 1943 ) was to purge all non-ukrainians from the future ukrainian state . '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) is wikipedia brainwashed too ? 
  yes , you are right . 
  it goes directly after that part about mocking yatsenyuk in social networks , though , so i 'd rather think about it as a sloppy reporting ( as in , forgot to say that this `` proposed banknote '' is a mockery ) . 
  after all , bandera on a banknote is hardly better than hitler . 
  first one is just that : `` german forces were defeated on baltic front in 1944 '' . 
  huh , it 's the other way around here : russki as in russki narod ( russian people , often meaning ethnically russian ) , but rosijski as in rosijskoe pravitelstvo ( russian government ) . 
  the part about defeating german forces , or the part about potsdam conference and paris peace treaties ? 
  yep , just checked a couple of schoolbooks . 
  granted , it 's just a couple of paragraphs , but the general sense is `` ussr forced baltic states '' , not `` liberated '' . 
  http://imgur.com/a/pa02n from top to bottom : `` why finland was n't in the ussr '' , `` why finland is rich '' , `` why finland is n't in nato '' , `` why finland is called suomi '' . 
   yet if they knew any truth then they 'd know that this was no liberation at all and only an illegal occupation and annexation . 
  actually , it 's in the schoolbooks . 
  at least in modern ones . 
  the education system in the nineties and early zeroes was a complete mess , though . 
  or maybe , not all ex-ussr countries consider that `` ussr fucked them over '' ? 
  it would probably turn your world upside down , but clicking images on imgur enlarges them to their original size . 
  that 's not `` an unknown journalist '' , that 's the source of this story which was all over ukrainian media . 
   just out of curiosity , how could russia drive a tank over the border and not be photographed by us satellites ? 
  careful there . 
  you 'd be called putin 's shill for this kind of questions . 
  less than a day , as far as i remember . 
  apparently , he was `` misunderstood '' . 
  at least , that was the official position of ukrainian ministry of defense . 
  it 's [ strong atheism ] ( http://atheism.about.com/od/atheismquestions/a/strong_weak.htm ) . 
   original quote that 's not the original quote . 
   russian press it was ukrainian press which first reported that . 
  [ specifically , ukrainian journalist roman bochkalah . 
  ] ( http://nbnews.com.ua/ru/news/132338/ ), 
  maybe if it 's belief that god ( s ) do n't exist ? 
   short of a tactical nuke [ they did tell about tactical nuke . 
  i do n't think it 's possible to translate unless there is original video somewhere without voice-over which makes impossible to hear what this scientist says except several words . 
  i 'm 100 % sure though that in the end ( when the voice-over talks about `` second explosion '' ) the scientist actually says `` something something critical mass , so there would be a nuclear explosion '' ( as a result of uncontrolled chain reaction , that is ) . 
  i do n't think that he is correct , though . 
  an actual nuclear explosion is very hard to do even intentionally without fission material just melting and chain reaction dying out . 
  probably that 's why the authors of the documentary decided to mistranslate his words . 
  except he 's talking about something different . 
  the translation is incorrect . 
  it 's hard to understand what he 's talking about because of voice-over , but the final words are clear : `` critical mass '' and `` it would be a nuclear explosion '' . 
  it would be very nice to see a link to those `` some soviet researches '' . 
  the whole `` vaporizing nuclear fuel by steam '' business seems almost improbable . 
  how exactly it is `` extremist propaganda '' ? 
   it was russian responsibility to control air space over it and by `` air space over it '' you obviously mean `` in the 250 km radius '' , right ? 
  yes , you 're right , and many people here ( especially mid-class + ) do not trust our pension system at all and are saving for their future . 
  however , pension system is probably one of the few remnants of the ussr 's social guarantees ... * generally * people expect to get at least some basic income out of it , proportional to their income during the years of work . 
  if it fails big time , i 'd expect shit to hit the fan really hard . 
  `` removing the people in power '' kind of hard . 
  my point was that people usually do n't save for pension themselves , the employer and the state pension fund are doing that for them . 
   you can have a more self-sustainable service based economy rather than a natural resources exports controlled by oligarchs based economy let 's start with this . 
  do you even know that natural resources exports constitute less than 20 % of russian gdp , industry about 36 % and services just under 60 % of it ? 
   i bet you ca n't even open a proper business in most small towns without giving a `` commission '' to the mayor or the local council was 100 % true during yeltsin 's `` rule '' . 
  not quite so now ( though obviously it depends on many things ) . 
  it would probably surprise you , but low/mid-level corruption became less widespread during putin 's terms , not more . 
   because of this infrastructure does n't get built or gets built poorly do you know that more infrastructure was built the last year than probably during all the nineties and half the zeroes ? 
   small towns can thrive if the system is built in such a way in which they can thrive blah blah blah . 
  how the hell small towns would thrive when nobody sane would want to do business in the middle of nowhere , especially considering russia 's distances ? 
  capable people just migrate to the places where their capabilities could be used much more efficiently . 
  that 's why moscow is bursting with overpopulation while small towns are slowly dying out . 
  top-level corruption is a burden on our economy , sure , but it is hardly the source of the problems with small towns , especially factory-centered . 
   if they are old if they ca n't save for pension ca n't happen .
