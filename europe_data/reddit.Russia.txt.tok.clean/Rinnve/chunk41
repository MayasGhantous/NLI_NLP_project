  pension ... contributions ( do n't know if correct translation ) are mandatory in russia . 
  basically , when an employer pays you your monthly salary , he also pays about 20 % of that sum ( there is a quite complex set of rules for different cases ) to the state pension fund which redirects the money to private pension fund of your choosing if you desire so . 
  there is such thing as `` gray salary '' though , when an employer `` pays '' you ( officially ) much less than in fact . 
  it 's everywhere during the nineties , but became less common in the recent years , though . 
  [ some people just ca n't into numbers . 
  ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/04/19/russias-poor-yes-but-its-not-that-dang-poor ), 
   poverty and economic problems did seem to do the trick in the 80s , when the soviet union was breaking up . 
  1991 : `` do you consider necessary the preservation of the union of soviet socialist republics [ ... ] ? '' [ 77.85 % answered `` yes '' to this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_union_referendum,_1991 ) soviet union broke up because local elites ( and * sometimes * the local people too , e.g. 
  baltics ) wanted their own state , not because the majority of the population was fed up with it . 
   because the way the state is organized no , because the ussr did n't particularly cared if some factories would be profitable or even needed during capitalism . 
  i must repeat my question : what kind of economic reforms could bring life to small towns built around single factory , long since outdated and out of function ? 
   putin 's administration has built a lot of their propaganda on claims that if not for putin 's cracking down on freedom then russia would be as poor as they were in the 90s . 
  what the ... 
  please give one single example of this . 
  `` authoritarianism and corruption '' have nothing to do with problems of small ( ish ) cities/towns . 
   putin has n't done any economic reforms actually , things became quite a bit better during his terms ; in part thanks to high oil prices , but do n't forget that all `` natural wealth '' ( oil + gas + products of oil refinement ) are about 20 % of russia 's gdp . 
  and what kind of economic reforms could bring life to small towns built around single factory , long since outdated and out of function ? 
  you forgot to mention the answer that 44 % out of those 58 % gave : '' \u0414\u0430 , \u043d\u043e \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e '' ( yes , but it is unrealistic now . ), 
   that 's because russia ca n't move past authoritarianism and corruption that 's because capitalism . 
  if the only factory in a small town becomes unprofitable , it just closes , and fuck the people . 
   honestly , why the fuck does russia feel the need to constantly expand ? 
  how exactly is this related to the topic ? 
  most do n't . 
  there was a proposal to make learning third language mandatory , but as far as i know , it is not yet implemented ( surely not in the school i work in ) . 
  people able to teach foreign languages usually can find much better paid jobs than a school teacher , though , so i do n't think there is much sense in that proposal . 
  making second language mandatory in the state exams , on the other hand , could be very good ( this comes in power after the next year ) . 
  perhaps russians will be able to speak some english in online games after all , 
  it 's not common at all to study a third language in russia . 
  sadly , people here put too little effort in learning foreign languages , even english . 
  it 's kind of understandable considering that one could travel half of europe in distance ( but the other way ) and still not meet anybody who does n't speak russian . 
  you are right . 
  they also note at the bottom that the article is edited and the first version of the article was incorrect ( it stated that people are spending 50 % of their income on food ) . 
  oh , a scandinavian catfight , how cute ! ^ i ^ am ^ sorry, 
  that one sentence clearly shows what they mean by `` russian '' , or at least that they ca n't make the distinction . 
  in other words , they mix up russians and ex-ussr people at least once , why should we think that that 's singular mistake ? 
   staff from the former soviet union russian , sure . 
   maybe it will crush your illusions . 
  or maybe it will not . 
  did police arrested them for being homosexuals , or for violating the law about public protests ? 
  it 's the latter , obviously . 
  oh , and i do n't see police * beating * them . 
  your second link contains outright lies : said vigilante group lured not gay teenagers , but people who wanted sex with gay teenagers ( in other words , pedophiles ) . 
  russian authorities `` not responded '' to that by putting the leader of that group in prison ( do n't know about other members , though ) . 
  and this is pure gold : `` it appears these social consequences that have been imposed by russian authorities have silenced people , because it 's hard to imagine that in a population of 143 million , only 7 % of people actually have a gay acquaintance . '' well , probably their average reader is too dumb to notice that comparing absolute and relative values is just wrong . 
  ~ ~ second ~ ~ third link is n't much better . 
  too many words , too few numbers . 
  they speak about growing violence , yet fail to provide some hard , verifiable facts , just vague words . 
  why not just `` there were reported x attacks in 2005 but y attacks in 2010 , increasing by z % '' ? 
  something tells me that 's because they just do n't have any such facts . 
   it is not culturally acceptable to beat up homosexuals it is not culturally acceptable in russia either . 
   the point is , kiev revolution was an internal business of ukraine , and none of your russian concern . 
  sure . 
  if only there were n't several quite heavy-weight figures from western europe and usa openly meddling in that `` internal business '' . 
  if only . 
   im pretty sure that people here are very passive , like most of the ex-ussr nation , and would have calmed after a few days of unrest yeah , of course , only glorious pro-western maidan protesters would keep at it for months . 
  pro-russian people are all passive and submissive . 
  there could be no chance at all that they could revolt as well . 
  as for `` gun shop '' that was totally not run by russian government ... well , allowing for this conflict to be resolved militarily would be very stupid and would set a very bad precedent . 
   revolt in the donbas region was n't even on the radar in 2013 . 
  revolt in kiev was n't either , what 's your point ? 
  thing is , i 'm not interested in information of `` everyone knows that '' quality . 
  people assume too much all the time . 
   there is lots of proof . 
  the question is which proof would suit you . 
  the verifiable kind . 
  something that would hold in court , for example . 
   you 're trying to prove you 're mistaken , i 'm not trying to prove anything at all . 
   assuming the suspect actively avoids associating his name to any assets or maybe `` the suspect '' is n't guilty after all . 
  that 's not my problem , really . 
  if you want to prove something , the burden of proof is on you . 
   what sort of verifyable information are you looking for ? 
  any sort . 
  the key word is `` verifiable '' . 
   how is it manipulative ? 
  it presents hearsay as facts , for starters . 
   you seem to care too much about putin to not have an opinion . 
  apples , oranges . 
  it matters not how much i do care about putin , it matters how much information do i have . 
  verifiable information , mind me , not some hearsay . 
  i do not have enough information to have an opinion on that and , frankly , i do n't care . 
  what i do care about is manipulative media . 
  that could or could not be fair sentence ( i do not possess enough information to discuss that ) , but my point is that he got those three years in a colony * not * for just holding some sign . 
  do you really think the excessive amount of handwaving used in `` putin 's secret riches '' instead of , you know , actual facts is that better ? 
  a penal colony is a penal colony , why invent some `` hard labor '' ? 
  much more important , though , is that he got this not for holding some sign , but for multiple violations of the law , including blocking a street . 
  why do you lie ? 
  actually , you 're right in one point : bbc is n't much better . 
  their recent movie about alleged putin 's riches is quite cringe-worthy . 
   just got sentenced to 3 years of hard labor in december i 'm pretty sure there 's something wrong here . 
  there is no such punishment in russia as `` hard labor '' . 
  fair point , but many people in russian do n't care about how other countries are presented in the western media , so it surely looks like anti-russian bias . 
  i do n't think it 's fair to compare cuba with north korea . 
  their health care and education system are top notch , [ cuba must be doing something right . 
   there 's no general anti-russia bias . 
  winter olympics in sochi demonstrated that bias quite clearly . 
  i do n't think that it 's intentional ( as in `` some grand plan '' ) , just blowing shit out of proportions generates more views . 
  but bias is bias . 
  how exactly my personal experience and experience of my acquaintances vs statements of unnamed guys is a no true scotsman fallacy ? 
  this is literally he said she said , except for some reason you chose to believe one side over another despite the evidence is equally weak .
