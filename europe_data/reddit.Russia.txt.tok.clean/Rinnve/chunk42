  you still have n't answered my question . 
  there is corruption and corruption . 
  there is a world of difference between `` persuading '' a traffic cop to close his eyes on an unfastened seat belt , and special police forces abusing the law in a major way to bust people 's homes and shooting them on a whim . 
  as for those `` russian posters '' , there are many russians who left russia in the nineties but still think that nothing has changed since then , and still tell stories about bribing police on a daily basis , non-functioning health care system ( without a bribe , that is ) , and other such things . 
  the reality is that neither i nor any of my acquaintances where extorted for a bribe by police ( or anybody else for that matter ) in last ten years or so . 
  so i find it quite hard to believe those stories of `` people forced to bribe cops every day '' . 
  you seem to be very well informed about the life in russia and specifically about how corrupt russian police is and how it abuses the law . 
  so tell me please , how often russian police abused the right to enter a home without warrant under certain circumstances ? 
  because , you know , there is nothing new about this right in this national guard story . 
  there is a difference between `` a right to enter a home '' and `` a right to enter a home under strictly defined circumstances '' . 
   yeah , when i hear russians talking about bribing cops as a simple fact of daily life words like these start to ring hollow . 
  one could wonder where those russians live . 
   ** in order to detain suspects ** do you even read ? 
  care to provide a real case or two ? 
  in russia it is not , at least if the weapon was legally owned and there really was an imminent threat to human life . 
  it could be hard to prove to the court that there really was a need to use a weapon , though , but not impossible . 
  i think you 're confusing russian national guard with ukrainian `` volunteer battalions '' or whatever they were called . 
  did you ever read the article ? 
  nobody gives national guard the right `` to burst into ones home '' etc. 
  what 's a bad idea ? 
  special police force that can use violence in the case of imminent threat to human lives ? 
  it 's not like they can do whatever they want . 
  it 's all over the state news , so in one form or other , i 'd say it 's going to happen . 
  not `` pro-atheist sentiments '' . 
  insulting religious people . 
  however ridiculous this case is , i as an atheist find it extremely disgusting when shit-talking at religion and using people 's beliefs as an instrument to insult them is presented as `` pro-atheist sentiments '' . 
  in case of the gulag system , not `` some '' of the people imprisoned were russians , but the majority . 
  about 60 % iirc . 
  `` no official statements from the russian-controlled local enforcement agencies regarding the incident have been published . 
  '' well , [ that 's a lie . 
  ] ( http://www.interfax.ru/russia/501631 ), 
   he as done nothing to solve the main issue of russia - the deep-rooted elitism and corruption do you really believe that one man could cure a centuries old disease ? 
  actually , i 'm not quite sure it is possible at all , at least without some major ~ ~ nuclear war ~ ~ changes . 
  it actually does n't matter if he meant `` news '' or not . 
  the key word in `` suppressing the press is a bad thing '' is `` suppressing '' . 
  take your example . 
  the onion is n't news even though they present themselves like that . 
  according to / u/ermili , it 's totally fine to ban the onion because `` it 's not [ real ] press '' . 
  yeah , and the sputnik article never says you have . 
  sensationalist headline , yes , the article itself - no . 
  press = / = news . 
  whoa , easy there . 
  before claiming that the whole article is a lie , answer this : is the first paragraph a lie ? 
  because , you know , cecilia schelin-seidegard did said to radio sweden that `` the island of gotland could be used as a key place to shoot from at invading russian troops '' ( for some reason there currently is no article in swedish , at least i failed to find it , but there still is [ something ] ( http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2108&amp;artikel=6213266 ) that looks like a translation of it to german ) . 
  okay . 
  for now , we have one article that claims that urbanovi\u010d\u0161 said something to them and ... another article that claims pretty much the same thing . 
  do we have something more substantional , like , you know , links to urbanovi\u010d\u0161 's personal blog/site/whatever where he states that * himself * ? 
  re-read my question . 
  can you quote the lies from the article ? 
  how about also translating key points form the original `` lie '' article , for instance , pointing at the `` forget conversation '' ? 
  i have n't managed to find * any * conversation ( interview-like ) in this article , but then again , i am only able to use google translate . 
  what exactly is a lie in this article , except maybe sensationalist headline ? 
   russia do that all the time . 
  and that makes it acceptable how , exactly ? 
   ussr did a lot to save small languages . 
  oh boy , those are fighting words . 
  who gets to decide what 's press and what 's not ? 
  hint : in a country with free speech nobody does that . 
  they even have [ search ] ( http://sputniknewslv.com/search/?query=urbanovi%c4%8ds ) . 
  as you can see , there are no articles published on wednesday that mention urbanovi\u010ds . 
  apparently , [ this ] ( http://sputniknewslv.com/opinion/20160215/629998.html ) is the article in question . 
  this `` picture of tanks '' is a link to another unrelated article , though , and i do n't see any `` conversation with j\u0101nis urbanovi\u010ds '' ( at least through google translate ) . 
  edit : oh look , silent downvotes as a response to a constructive comment !, 
  too bad sputniknews.lv is inaccessible and it is impossible to check this . 
  do you have any links ? 
  yes , yes , you 're quite correct , `` the source claimed '' is about as old as time itself , and there hardly is any news agency which avoided using this trick at least once . 
  your point being ? . . 
  it is completely relevant to tass reporting about government ditching russian version of their sites . 
  also , if you forgot the russian , '' \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043c \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 '' means `` as the source claimed '' . 
  universal journalist lingo for `` unchecked information '' . 
  try harder . 
  `` ministry of finance -- we 'll just leave the link to the russian version for itar-tass here . '' [ 404 ] ( http://www.minfin.gov.ua/control/ru/index ) lies , you say , huh ? 
  those men are claimed to be russian citizens . 
  it 's not only about ukraine . 
  how exactly it is relevant to the fact reported in the article ? 
  does the ( unproven yet ) claim that the lawyer 's defendants were russian servicemen makes his murder any better ? 
  no , it is not `` lying by omission '' , since the omission of some questionable claims changes exactly nothing about what this article reports . 
  from the article : `` today we found out the tragic news . 
  lawyer yuri grabovsky has been found dead . 
  ** the suspect in this crime has been detained , ** and we hope that all those involved in the murder of our colleague will be punished , '' the association said in a statement . 
   lying article from tass.ru could you please provide us with 1 ( one ) example of tass intentionally providing incorrect information in their reports ? 
  because that 's what `` lying '' means . 
  you 're mixing up tsarist russia ( which policy indeed was forceful russification ) and the ussr . 
  while there was state-wide censorship , literature in the native languages was * not * banned ( and sometimes quite opposite , that is , supported ) , and people were * not * forced to become russian , especially after stalin died ( although being able to speak widely used international language was certainly a serious advantage ) . 
  how exactly ussr `` broke down other cultures '' when it was during ussr time when , for instance , quite a few minority languages were uplifted and given a writing system , and there were programs supporting minority cultures ? 
  ussr language and cultural policy was much more complex and diverse thing than just `` forceful russification and assimilation '' . 
   but as for a non-russian part of russia that 's been russified except i have not asked about `` russification '' , i have asked about assimilation . 
  how exactly all those minorities are assimilated when they still have their national identities , their distinct cultures and languages ? 
  usa immigrants are an example what assimilation means : they could have italian , russian or , say , chinese heritage , but they speak american , they think american and they * are * american . 
  not so in russia . 
   and the tatar language in the republic of tatarstan was only recently declassified as endangered . 
  are you sure you 're not confusing tatar and crimean tatar languages ? 
   it 's likely that no one thing prevented russification policies under the russian empire and soviet union from completely succeeding , however to deny their existence and insinuate that the baltic states were jolly and practicing their cultures without obstacle is simply insulting it is also insulting when integration policies are described like they were aimed at the destruction of local culture and national identity . 
  okay . 
  please explain , if this statement is correct and russia indeed `` was used to assimilate other non-russian parts '' ( and , presumably , had the intent to assimilate baltic states ) , how comes then that after 1.5-2 centuries of russian rule baltic states still exist ? 
  in fact , scratch that . 
  provide examples of `` non-russian parts '' that russia `` assimilated '' . 
  you are pulling my statement out of the context . 
  this is bad , and you should feel bad . 
  my question about existence of baltic states was aimed at the [ statement ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4bgee2/russia_bans_polands_communist_monopoly_board_game/d1909o3 ) that `` russia was used to assimilate other non-russian parts '' .
