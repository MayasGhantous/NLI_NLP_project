  a bit later [ it became clear ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4bgee2/russia_bans_polands_communist_monopoly_board_game/d1aaa08 ) that by `` assimilation '' author of the comment actually meant introduction of second official language and increase of the russian minority . 
  ( actually , i do n't think there was one case of real assimilation in the russian history , at least intentional one . ), 
  still , nowhere in the ussr local languages were replaced by russian as / u/h2ppyme claims . 
   then you suggested a russification policy did n't exist because the `` baltic states still exist '' why do you lie ? 
   only yesterday someone was telling me the ussr celebrated every member state culture and never committed crimes against the non-russian states , nor did it have a russofucation policy . 
  oh really . 
  could you cite that ? 
  yeah , whatever . 
  russians were the majority among the oppressed by the ussr , but it was n't quite horrible enough because , you know , there are so much russians , nobody would miss a million or two . 
  who `` he '' ? 
  stalin ? 
  the history of the ussr is a little longer than stalin 's rule , you know . 
  so they taught in russian in primary school , but switched to local language in higher levels ? 
  that goes against all sources that are there about ussr language policies . 
  you know , you ca n't really compare nazi germany killing it 's opposition or gays and soviets deporting millions of russian peasants just because they were a bit richer than their neighbors . 
  i just do n't understand how you can call ussr `` pro-russian '' after this . 
  soviets used russian language and culture , that 's right , but they were anything but pro-russian . 
  the difference between us is that i can back my words with some credible sources . 
  http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/540/handouts/ussr/soviet2.html `` in some but not all republics , the highest use option was available , e.g. 
  in georgia , the baltics , uzbekistan , azerbaijan , armenia , their languages are the main language of higher education ; ergo , some non-locals may also be studying through these languages . '', 
   what sort of statistic do you claim ? 
  i do n't know , something that clearly shows that ussr was `` pure russian chauvinism , nothing more '' . 
  something that explains how `` russian-chauvinistic '' ussr could forcibly relocate and/or kill millions of russians . 
  it is your statement , the burden of proof is on you . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  what i need is statistic , not singular examples . 
  statistic showing that russians were treated significantly better than other ethnicities . 
  also , what i * do n't * need is you giving a couple of examples and adding `` etc '' like it could be continued . 
  it could not . 
  the former tried to russify them and outright banned the language , while the latter kept two official languages and allowed education in the national language . 
  i did , that 's the thing . 
  there is no need to flaunt your ignorance all over the internet , you know . 
   official language replaced with russian ( baltic states ) all ( non-russian ) soviet republics kept two official languages , nowhere russian replaced it . 
  but that 's just a minor detail . 
  more importantly , there where some 150 + ethnic minorities in the ussr . 
  if you 're right , if said minorities were all treated unjustly , you must have many more different examples . 
  do you ? 
  since late xviii century if i remember correct , so about a century under russian empire and more than a half under ussr . 
  so in the same time russia `` used to assimilate other non-russian parts '' * and * was quite unsuccessful at that . 
  you know , you got to choose . 
  not only central asia . 
  how exactly tatars , mordvins , ossetians are `` assimilated '' if they maintain their national identity to this day ? 
  they are integrated into russian society , sure , but assimilated ? 
  hardly . 
  and how exactly were they treated ? 
  enlighten me . 
  i am , actually . 
  you , on the other hand , seem to be not particularly acquainted with the soviet history . 
  what those would be , i wonder ? 
  do you really wish to question well-know historical facts ? 
  baltic states were under russian rule for about two centuries . 
  not even what ? 
  2 + centuries not long enough ? 
  well , okay , what non-russian parts russia managed to assimilate then ? 
  nope . 
  also , all articles in russian i 've managed to find refer to ipn 's statement . 
  how comes then that baltic states still exist ? 
  international glue . 
  national languages and cultures of each republic were supported too . 
  enlighten us . 
  in the domestic media , of course . 
  this is an established pattern already : 1 ) fringe mp makes a crazy proposal , it 's being reported all over major western news ; 2 ) some time later , the proposal gets rejected ... * crickets *, 
  yeah , the general idea of his message is that it is `` a heresy '' that there is a trend for protecting right for making any choice , even if said choice is against the bible . 
  i do not possess enough verifiable information to believe either way . 
   and if you 're complaining about the story not being posted , post it . 
  not being reported . 
  it 's kinda difficult to post that which does n't exist . 
  i 'm not discussing that , though . 
  my point is that the article in question purposefully mixes two very different things : insults and criticism . 
  this is propaganda , plain and simple . 
  oh , and do n't hold your breath about reports of this proposal not being accepted : since it would n't put russia in bad light , it will go silent , i 'm quite sure of that . 
  no , they were not . 
  source : actual lack of verifiable facts . 
  slander , actually , at least without the facts . 
  criticism is based on facts , that 's your line . 
  since when insults became criticism ? 
  i 'm not saying that it is good proposal ( or bad , for that matter ) , but this article purposefully mixes those two quite different things . 
  partly . 
  as far as i know , stalin had his own predictions about when germans will attack , and he was surprised when they did it too early . 
  most probably https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%90%d1%80 equals to 100 m ^ 2 . 
  samogon ( literally `` self-made alcohol '' ) can be very different , some people make low-quality booze to get wasted , some elevate it to a completely different level where taste matters most . 
  it 's not quite `` sought-after '' , though , more like a hobby ( like in `` guys , put away your vodka for a while and try this stuff my granddad brewed '' ) . 
  from my personal experience , decent whiskey  good samogon ( especially flavoured with some herbs )  decent vodka . 
  canada , us and russia are very big countries . 
  regions with continental climate have the same problems with ruined asphalt after winter , only they have significantly more money to deal with it . 
  by referring to relative position to open water i was answering to `` volgograd and paris on the same latitude '' . 
  continental climate happens . 
  [ this ] ( http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/as-sa/97-550/vignettes/img/map-2006-pop-density-canada-sz01-en.gif ) canada ? 
  russian roads experience much heavier traffic and worse climate . 
  no , latitude is n't everything , relative position to open water ( seas/oceans ) is also very important . 
  interesting thing , i 've yet to meet those mythical game-breaking russians , after years playing eu wow and dota 2 . 
  game-breaking kids tho , those are real . 
  i absolutely love the finnish language in songs . 
  add some kantele , and it 's just magic . 
  regularly spoken finnish could be kind of annoying , though . 
  ( i 've never been to finland , so i can only judge by videos on the internet . ), 
  oh my , you 're so delusional . 
  farewell . 
  40 million russians would be about 1/3 of the entire population of the ussr . 
  this number is so ridiculously inflated it 's not even funny .
