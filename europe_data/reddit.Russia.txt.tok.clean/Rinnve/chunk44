  belgian colonial atrocities , most probably . 
  the man on the picture looks just like [ king leopold ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopold_ii_of_belgium ) . 
  wait , are you suggesting that stalin `` killed '' 40 million russians * besides * war losses ? 
   why * some * russians love him please . 
  in fact , this is a correct use of the word [ `` meme '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meme ) . 
   makes sense that it involves russia . 
  how so ? 
  this is incorrect , tatars were a minority long before stalin 's deportations . 
  actually , little green men is a meme originated in crimea , not donbass . 
  there were these people , clearly military , well equipped and organized , but without any insignias , during crimean events ( i even thought for some time that it was some kind of russia-backed `` security '' company , kind of blackwater ) . 
  no officially russian soldiers , not before referendum . 
  in donbass , at least at the start , there were no any `` green men '' , just a ragtag militants . 
  they were even using ww2 time weaponry from museums , and only after ukraine started to push , those militants `` somehow '' obtained some serious gear . 
  vote results have been confirmed by several independent polls afterwards . 
  allowing people of crimea to make their choice , however , is exactly how democracy works . 
  nobody forced them to vote , you know . 
   polls prior to the occupation of crimea you mean prior to the whole maidan thing when ultranationalists basically threw out the president supported by the majority of crimeans ? 
  `` he took his final decision about crimea after secret , undated opinion polls showed 80 % of crimeans favoured joining russia . '' in other words , putin took his decision because he was sure about vote outcome . 
   past three years the same three years when there was a president in ukraine [ voted in by the majority of crimeans ?

  ... and countless media myths . 
  actually , many cities that hosted winter olympics have similar climate , or even warmer . 
  the key is nearby mountains . 
  the link to the papers is in the article . 
  no , they are not . 
   because on any important article i have seen ( news , of course ) they write `` according to '' and '' [ ] says/thinks '' so just like rt ? 
  falling ruble did n't change much considering daily necessities . 
  imported stuff like hi-tech gadgets , that 's another story . 
  if op likes his social worker job , well , tough luck : in free market economy , jobs are paid more or less according to demand . 
  teacher work actually would be a good example to this : in the 90s and early 00s they were paid like shit , and many teachers left their jobs in search of more adequately paid positions ( be it private tutoring , working in some elite private school instead of public state-owned one , or changing the occupation completely ) . 
  result ? 
  well , you still wo n't get rich as a teacher now , but you would live , not survive ; and the situation improves year to year . 
  i myself ( computer science teacher in a rather small city far from moscow ) make about 25k/month , depending on how good my students perform in various competitions and exams . 
  it actually works , just not for everybody . 
  only for people willing to take their fate in their own hands . 
  even if it 's true , i do n't see how exactly it 's relevant to the op 's situation . 
  he is working for abysmally small wage even by provincial russian standards ( but , judging by what he pays for the apartment , he lives in a quite big city ) ; he has all that is needed to make a change in his life , but apparently he is just a hopeless whiner . 
  ( this is assuming op is real ; there is something fishy about his story . ), 
  so the second option . 
  playing with currency exchange is a very bad idea unless you know _ exactly _ what are you doing . 
  why not try and change something in your life ? 
  8k rubles/month is very low even for small russian cities . 
  you have a computer with internet access , you know english , the world of self-education and freelance work is open to you . 
  or , you can whine all day long and blame that state does n't provide you with everything . 
  obvious troll just became a little more obvious . 
  in your wet dreams . 
  let me ask again : where are those documents ? 
  not references to them , not article about how `` putin is 127 % guilty , believe me '' or `` zykov feels putin did personally benefit from the scheme '' ( feels , ffs !, 
  seriously , wtf ) , but the documents themselves ? 
  so you have nothing to say , am i right ? 
   black holes exist because astronomers said so ? 
  because astronomers said so * and because they presented substantial proofs * : observations , formulas , etc. 
  anybody could follow their path , do some calculations , point the telescope to the certain part of the sky and see for themselves . 
  oh , and black holes do n't quite exist ; the scientific community thinks that they could exist , they most probably exist , we observed something that certainly looks like a predicted black hole , but science is n't about 100 % certainty . 
  there is always a place for doubt , unlike the popular media . 
   credentials of the above comment are very credible no , they are not . 
  where can we see those documents ? 
  no , not articles where people say things like `` oh i certainly saw this and this '' , but actual facts ? 
  where are those documents , and why exactly we should believe in their existence ? 
  it happened because someone said so ? 
  is there some hard evidence , not just `` i know this , believe me '' ? 
  oh , seemingly legit `` documentary '' . 
  he must surely be guilty then . 
  in reality , yes , there were food shortages after the fall of the ussr ( [ `` may be not after a war '' , though ] ( http://img.memecdn.com/epic-facepalm_o_289302.jpg ) ) , and yes , putin was connected to some business of selling materials in order to supply the people with food . 
  the fact is , all `` investigations '' can be summed up like `` he said she said '' . 
  nothing substantial . 
  that does n't mean he is n't guilty , of course , it only means presumption of innocence . 
  it 's in the criminal code ffs . 
  or does it work only for the people we like ? 
   nobody said the empire was for the benefit of ethnic russians what makes it russian empire , then ? 
   are russians better off in today 's russia , compared to other people -- and does it make today 's russia not russia if it was n't the case ? 
  contemporary russia is a federation by law and by fact , a country for many different people , all equal . 
  this was not the case during the times of the russian empire , non-russians were second class people ( not like in most other empires , r.e. 
  was quite tolerant to minorities , but still ) . 
   the point is that russia and the soviet union are the same thing , the latter just had an ideological fig leaf . 
  uh , yeah , geographically russia and the soviet union are largely the same . 
  `` fig leaf '' , however ? 
  nazis and contemporary germany must be the same , then , save for the similar `` fig leaf '' . 
  i do n't think any german would agree with that , and for a good reason . 
  actually , he also eats babies for breakfast . 
  what . 
  the . 
  what `` food for the citizens of st.peter '' ? 
  what `` post war food shortage '' ? 
  seriously , wtf ? 
  georgian problems ( south ossetia and abkhazia ) started during the dissolution of the ussr , largely thanks to georgia itself . 
  `` resurgent cult of lenin/stalin '' is half a media myth , half some nostalgic old dudes ; it 's not supported by or even related to the government . 
  `` absorbing '' belarus ? 
  this statement is as crazy as something like `` eu is absorbing ukraine '' . 
   i told her that he embezzled food money during the post war food shortage . 
  er , what ? 
   rf can not unilaterally tear off a part of other nation even if population agrees to it . 
  how exactly is this worse than ukraine not giving two shits about the right to self-determination , supported by the complete silence of the `` international community '' ? 
  there are also things like the right to self-determination , you know . 
  but , of course , people tend to recall those things only when it suits them . 
  the idea of ussr being `` a russian empire with an ideological sauce '' would imply that russians were better off in it , compared to other people . 
  this was not the case . 
  the population is mostly russian , they do n't consider themselves as a part of ukraine , it was formally `` ukrainian land '' like 10 % of the time it was russian land . 
  crimea is anything but `` a land of ukrainian nation '' .
