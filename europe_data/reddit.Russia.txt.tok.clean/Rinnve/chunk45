  could you be more specific about that `` land of other nations '' ? 
  yes . 
  learn some history . 
  at least half of the things you listed either started long before putin came to power , or are not related to him . 
   soviet union was in essence a russian empire with a bit of ideological sauce . 
  oh , that must be the reason behind most ussr leaders and high-ranked party officers * not * being russian , and russians being the majority of the inmates of gulags . 
   he can always arrange generous repatriation program except repatriation program for russians is in effect since 1999 , tens of thousands move home every year . 
  none of your links contradict my statement about putin being anti-soviet . 
  pretty much every time putin mentions ussr government , he wo n't forget to add that it was brutal and criminal . 
  the ussr dissolution being a tragedy is n't related to this at all ; it 's not unlike collapse of a great prison house : many people were hurt , that 's why it 's a tragedy . 
  does n't mean the prison house was great . 
  oranges still closely associate with the new year 's eve in my mind because that was the only time i saw them in my childhood ( 80s-90s ) . 
  bananas ? 
  imaginary stuff from the pictures in the books . 
   he keeps cultivating soviet golden age narrative [ citation needed ] last time i checked , putin was pretty anti-soviet , ideology wise at least . 
  they did n't * target * civilians , probably . 
  it just so happens when you fire heavy weaponry in the general direction of the target , there are lots of casualties . 
  for instance , one of the first airstrikes ( when it was still relatively quiet ) resulted in [ this ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/03/world/europe/ukraine-luhansk-building-attack/ ) . 
   they do n't care about their own hom\u0435less  page that lists organizations created specifically to help homeless i ca n't even . 
  in moscow alone , there are about 30000 homeless people . 
  `` hundreds '' of that number is about 0.6 % . 
   because i know that they do n't care about their own hom\u0435less . 
  [ it seems you do n't know shit .

   subsistence lifestyle `` our friends who live across the road and raise sled dogs chose a subsistence way of life . 
  while jerry and i have indoor plumbing , they have none . 
  they have an outhouse and a well . 
  pam , a tiny , attractive woman in her 60 's , carries about 30 gallons of water from the well to clean and water their 40 dogs every day . 
  in addition she carries water for washing dishes , household cleaning and personal use . 
  every year , in season , joee shoots and butchers a moose . 
  one moose lasts the year for meat . 
  most of the rest of their dietary protein is salmon . 
  joee fishes for salmon for humans and dogs . 
  they freeze it , can it and smoke it . '' ( [ source ] ( http://20thcenturywoman.com/?p=534 ) ) either you have no idea what is subsistence living , or you have no idea about the life in russia . 
  there is no need to go down to this level . 
   in 1997 , russia passed a law stating that buddhism , islam , russian orthodoxy , and judaism are the `` traditional religions '' of the country . 
  source ? 
  there were several projects of laws about `` traditional '' religions , but as far as i know , none were approved . 
  it 's oversaturated in photoshop . 
   fifth pillar hate to be this guy , but it 's [ fifth column ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fifth_column ) , as in `` military formation '' . 
  `` propaganda of non-traditional relationships to minors '' . 
  well , if there were minors who saw `` displays of affection '' , it is not impossible to imagine , ah , `` stretching '' the law . 
  never happened yet , though . 
  `` yanukovich proposed starting three-way talks between russia , ukraine , and the eu and urged brussels to help ukraine soften the terms of a possible loan from the imf . 
  but the eu rejected trilateral talks and said yanukovich must give a commitment to sign the agreement that he refused to give . '' [ source .

   poland , russia eh , not gon na happen . 
  not much , since it was quite low . 
  well , compared to the rollercoaster which was russian economy in the '90s . 
   for reference go back to 1998 and see the govt default destroying people 's savings accounts . 
  a lot of pensioners got fucked over big time as a result , as their soviet era pensions became worth virtually nothing as a result . 
  i think you 're confusing the events of the early '90s with 1998 . 
  i 'm pretty sure the soviet-era saving accounts turned to dust long before that , around 1991-1993 thanks to hyperinflation . 
  1998 was painful mostly because dollar raised sky high , from about 6 rub/1 $ to about 25 rub / 1 $ basically overnight . 
   umm you sound like a victim of propaganda . 
  it is always highly amusing when people start to make assumptions based on the flair . 
  the only propaganda i can be a victim of is western one since that 's the origin of media i consume . 
   if oil is only few percents of their gdp the there 's no way that it would as important as in russia . 
  [ tough shit  ( http://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/oil-plunge-to-dim-sparkle-of-canadas-first-balanced-budget-in-7-years ) `` the conservatives , seeking a rare fourth consecutive election win , had initially forecast a $ 6.4 billion budget surplus for the 2015-16 fiscal year and made no secret that they would put forward some hefty tax cuts . 
  but oil is a major canadian export and with oil prices roughly halving between june 2014 and january 2015 , government revenues were cut so heavily that oliver is now promising merely to balance the budget after seven years of deficits . ''  oil companies are of course privately owned . 
  that does n't mean much if we do n't know how much of government 's budget depends on taxing privately owned oil companies . 
   sorry honey but i really do n't care if you ca n't google by yourself . 
  thing is , you ca n't google it too . 
  this information is n't easily available out there . 
  there is no publicly available data about how much canadian budget is dependent on energy exports . 
  so yeah , you 're were blabbering about what you do n't have any idea . 
  still no info on canada 's budget structure . 
  you should never go full retard . 
  no , it 's just you speaking about what you do n't have the slightest idea . 
  [ as you can see ] ( http://www.gmig.ru/ ) , the state museum of gulag history is alive and well . 
  * edit : fixed name *, 
   just recently it was in the news that russia 's only gulag museum was closing due to political pressure . 
  `` news '' . 
  not the `` only '' , not even the largest . 
  to the source of your knowledge of the structure of canada 's budget . 
  link , please . 
   yes it does . 
  just admit you do n't know anything about the structure of canada 's budget . 
  there is nothing to be ashamed of . 
  no , it does not . 
   putin signed a law which stops adjusting pensions according to inflation : for working pensioners only . 
   strikes russia is big . 
  a couple of examples of bad management does n't mean it 's something systematic . 
  actually , it was about government 's budget , not gdp . 
  i asked about canada 's budget , not gdp . 
  those are two completely different things , you know . 
  as compared to how much of canada 's budget coming from oil ? 
   starting to cut pensions and hold out payouts for government workers source ? 
   the kind that would brag about it on twitter except that never happened . 
  this story about `` ukrainian rebels bragging on twitter about the plane they shot down '' is a media myth . 
  there was ( may be still is ) a group in vkontakte ( not twitter ) named `` news from strelkov '' that indeed bragged about it ; but at least once ( about two weeks before mh17 tragedy ) that group was used to spread disinformation . 
  the official separatist site is down for some reason , but [ this article about it is available through the archive ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20150111175824/http://icorpus.ru/zayavlenie-strelkova-bespoletnuyu-zonu/ ) . 
   or is it actually a valid legal defense in russia , to state that the amount of harm you intended to cause was not supposed to result in death ? 
  kind of like that , yes . 
  to be more precise , there are two different articles in the russian criminal code about `` unintentional homicide '' , one that involves an intent to do serious harm ( it is also defined what exactly is considered a serious harm ) without an intent to actually kill a person ; and another article for any other unintentional homicide with rather light punishment , considering the consequences : up to 3 years of prison , compared to up to 15 years in the first case . 
  so if there was no intentional serious harm done , but prosecutor requests punishment by the first article ( `` serious harm '' one ) , there can be built a defence around this . 
  there is such a distinction in the form of the article on `` intentional serious harm to health that caused death '' . 
  i do n't think there was intent to cause some obviously serious harm to health . 
  punches in the face ( unless you 're have been trained in some kind of martial arts ) rarely kill . 
  russian criminal codex does n't have `` unintentional murder '' .
