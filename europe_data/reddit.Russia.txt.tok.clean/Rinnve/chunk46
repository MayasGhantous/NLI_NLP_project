   the netherlands `` on 15 may 1940 , one day after the bombing of rotterdam , the dutch forces surrendered . 
  the dutch government and the royal family escaped and went into exile in britain . 
  following the defeat , the netherlands was placed under german occupation , which endured in some areas until the german surrender in may 1945 . 
  active resistance was carried out by a small minority , which grew in the course of the occupation . 
  the occupiers deported the majority of the country 's jews to nazi concentration camps , with the cooperation of the dutch police and civil service . 
  in fact , the netherlands saw one of the highest levels of collaboration during the holocaust of any occupied country . 
  as a result of that , with also the good population registers comparing to other countries , about 75 % of the country 's jewish population were killed during the conflict ; a much higher percentage than comparable countries , like belgium and france . '' mmmkay .

  not exactly state healthcare , more like mandatory health insurance ( most people do n't even think about it , since there are little options usually , so its like a tax really ; additional paid options are present though ) . 
  as for quality and care , it is still very patchy if we 're talking state owned institutions . 
  there are good doctors who care , there are good hospitals with nice equipment , those two sometimes coincide even . 
  as for prescriptions , there are options often ( generics made who knows where , or sometimes , state-sponsored drugs ) . 
  anyways , basic illnesses are usually cared for no money at all ( except for some $ 10 for drugs ) , rarer diseases are case by case situation . 
  there could be a queue , though , but this new internet-based queuing system kind of takes care of it ( ymmv ), 
  as a nope guy said , do n't do this . 
  i almost lost my father because he ignored his stomach problems ( `` painkillers for the win '' ) until this one time when he finally got ulcer proliferation ( or whatever \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u044f\u0437\u0432\u044b \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0443\u0434\u043a\u0430 is called in english , nasty stuff anyways ) . 
  thankfully there was an experienced surgeon on duty in the emergency care , he figured it out and saved a life . 
  too bad this is not a single case of how pretty basic illness was allowed to progress to a deadly state , all thanks to that stupid `` no hospitals until you 're dying '' rule . 
  even bad healthcare is better than no healthcare at all , unless maybe the doctors are really really corrupt . 
  eh , you cant really have any idea about what ideas i have or have not . 
  on a more serious note , of course post processing matters a lot . 
  but 20 to 80 , that 's like taking any photo which is n't one hundred percent unrecoverable shit , and pushing it up to the work of art . 
  not gon na happen , not most of the time . 
  you 've got to have some substantial material to work with . 
  probably those photos were enhanced in the ps or the lr or whatever , that 's fine : post always was a part of the art of the photography . 
  but without the initial work ... to put in another words , there is no way you can get a random guy , ask him to do some shots and produce what we 've seen here . 
  no amount of photoshop would compensate for a lack of actual photography skill . 
  may be the thing is that you just underestimate the need of it , being a pro photographer ( i 'm just assuming it ) many things can seem very basic and not worth a mention . 
  they are actually not , even if they are more technical than , ah , artsy . 
   inch of snow drops  a state of emergency is declared you ca n't be serious . 
   20 % of most images is the shot , and 80 % is the photoshop applied to said images . 
  no , you ai n't a photographer . 
  volga tatars are doing just fine last time i checked . 
  / u/mkvgtired : `` but they were accused of working with the nazis so it was convenient ti mass deport them to siberia . 
  slavs were imported , and now you have the situation we see today . 
  the peninsula is populated by mostly ethnic russians who moved into the homes of the tartars and took over the peninsula . '' in other words , stalin removed crimean tatars and `` imported '' russians instead , and that 's apparently how ( according to / u/mkvgtired ) crimea become russian . 
  ethnic cleansing has a pretty clear definition , and `` assimilation of native people '' is not it . 
   kind of a cornerstone of the soviet union . 
  more like kind of a cornerstone of the stalin 's rule . 
  i do n't think there were any more deportations after he died . 
   that is why the `` historically russian '' argument is a little ridiculous . 
  [ crimea 's census ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_crimea#ethnicities_.26_languages ) : 1926 ( long before any deportations ) russians 42.2 % , crimean tatars 25.1 % . 
  no , crimea is russian because russians conquered it and lived there for centuries , not because stalin `` imported '' russians there after deportation of crimean tatars . 
  that 's why he was n't arrested . 
  actually , it would n't . 
   it 's pretty clear what was going on there . 
  yep , as i 've said , it was n't `` famine in ukraine '' .

   you 're calling 700,000 a reasonable figure regarding stalin 's death count , while the majority of all estimates can be casually waved off as `` populist ? '', 
  700 thousand is the documented number of people who were executed ( intent proved ) by the soviets . 
  not by stalin personally , but this is the closest you can get to `` stalin killed them '' . 
  if you start counting people who died in gulag because of horrible conditions ... well , why single out stalin ? 
  let also judge all modern leaders , add people who died in prisons during their rule to their `` body count '' . 
  modern prisons are n't on the gulag level , but they are n't resorts either . 
  i 'm pretty sure only small quiet countries like sweden or finland could get away with that . 
  thing is , all those millions were victims of the soviet system , not stalin personally . 
  it 's not like he mind-controlled the soviets . 
   even in a school course of history there are no much information about that period . 
  no facts about collectivization , repressions against kulaks , red terror presented as equal to white terror , etc etc etc. 
  there is enough information there in the modern school courses .

   yet you never see people saying `` yeah he was the greatest murderer in world history , he was a monster . . let us never let that happen again . '', 
  maybe that 's because most of us have relatives who actually lived during his rule , and know that this bullshit about tens of millions of deaths is exactly this : bullshit ? 
  maybe we know that there were no `` famine in ukraine '' , but rather famine in several bordering regions in russia , ukraine and kazakhstan , and this `` famine in ukraine '' myth is an attempt at creating myth of bad russia opressing poor ukraine ? 
  we see such attempts at manipulating history , and we react . 
  maybe overreact , but still . 
   i 've seen stalin accused of many things , but it 's seldom having the mental capacity of a toddler . 
  even a child knows , that deprived of food , peope die . 
  colectivisation caused a fall in efficiency , but it did n't cause holodomor . 
  that 'd be the party members in guard towers , ready to shoot whoever was stealing grain . 
  that does n't happen unintentionaly , and neither does turning famished people back from trains to moscow . 
  i 'm sorry , but you 've just demonstrated that your knowledge of what happened during holodomor and what exactly caused it is a bit ... imperfect . 
  but then again you approve of snyder , maybe you also approve of his methods , namely ignoring inconvenient facts . 
  like , you know , documented help in the form of food and grain sent to starving regions . 
  kinda contradicts the idea of intentional starvation , do n't you think ? 
   i never claimed they were imprisoned en-masse upon arrival . 
  you claimed that pretty much everybody who went to europe was prosecuted so they wo n't spread `` imperialist propaganda '' or something like that . 
  it actually does n't matter that much if it was done immediately upon arrival or after some time , either way it would be a massive event , even if it was spread through some time . 
   the article is making shit up about its points and attributes claims to it that just are n't there okay , let 's take a couple of fragments of this article . 
  first , this : `` hitler and stalin , in his hands , come across as colossi who never panic or stumble but always know precisely what they are doing . 
  thus , hitler `` intended to use the soviet union to solve his british problem , '' he `` knew '' of ukraine 's economic value , etc. , while stalin `` deliberately '' starved ukraine , `` chose to kill millions of people , '' and engaged in `` clearly premeditated mass murder . '' [ ... ] puffing up the two super-tyrants , snyder downplays the social forces behind them and exculpates the political actors in between . 
  since hitler and stalin are alone responsible , others are not ; violence is not something that arises from within the borderlands , but is visited on them from outside . '' is the article wrong on that ? 
  is the article wrong on how snyder ignores , for instance , polish and ukrainian anti-semitism ? 
  second fragment : `` sexual abuse among the partisans was rife , he [ snyder ] says : `` the standard form of address to girls and women was ` whore , ' and women usually had no choice but to seek a protector . '''' is it not actually in `` bloodlands '' , is it a lie of the article 's author ? 
  third fragment : `` he [ snyder ] seeks to exculpate local pogromists by portraying them as operating at german behest : `` as a result of trained collaboration and local assistance , german killers had all the help that they needed in lithuania . 
  in the weeks and months to come , germans drove lithuanians to killing sites around the city of kaunas . 
  by july 4 , 1941 , lithuanian units were killing jews under german supervision and orders . '' but instead of functioning in a subordinate capacity , lithuanian rightists began slaughtering jews before the wehrmacht arrived , with a savagery that even german officers found shocking . '' is this fragment wrong ? 
   you [ collectively you , i do n't know what you individually do ] stop right there . 
  you are writing to me , personally , so please , answer to what i personally do , not what your imaginary collective russian image does . 
  i , personally , never lie intentionally , and i try to cite or to mention credible sources .
