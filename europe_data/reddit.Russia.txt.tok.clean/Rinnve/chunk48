  the [ source ] ( http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/11/29/ukraine-eu-deal-ditchedunderpressurefromrussia.html ) on eu was already provided above : `` yanukovych is now seeking a larger deal that would also include russia , a notion the e.u. 
  immediately dismissed . 
  `` when we make a bilateral deal , we do n't need a trilateral agreement , '' said barroso . '' here 's [ another one ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/11/ukraine-still-wants-sign-eu-deal-20131129111345619208.html ) : `` yanukovych 's government says ukraine can not afford to sacrifice trade with russia for closer ties to the eu . 
  [ ... ] yanukovich proposed starting three-way talks between russia , ukraine , and the eu and urged brussels to help ukraine soften the terms of a possible loan from the imf . 
  but the eu rejected trilateral talks and said yanukovich must give a commitment to sign the agreement that he refused to give . '', 
  your arguments against protectionism are quite convinc ... oh wait . 
  sources for russia making ukraine choose between russia and eu , and not eu insisting that any kind of trilateral agreement should n't happen . 
   bad for people . 
  so you think that ukraine abusing ukraine-russia free trade agreement with eu trade agreement would n't be bad for russian people , am i right ? 
   no , it was russia that made ukraine chose . 
  sources , please . 
   i do n't see why it would been bad . 
  you must be blind then , because i 've addressed that in the first message . 
  you 're trying to derail the discussion . 
  this is bad . 
  no , it is not a crime . 
  it also does n't `` completely mean nothing for the russian side '' , as russia was ukraine 's biggest trade partner . 
   they were just going to open to europe . 
   which completely mean nothing for the russian side . 
  come again ? 
  how exactly tax-free european goods which could be easily repackaged and relabeled as `` ukrainian '' would mean nothing for the russian side , considering free-trade deals between ukraine and russia ? 
  i may be wrong , but that 's how i get the gist of what 's happening around there . 
  sorry , but [ you 're full of shit ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/20/one-year-after-russia-annexed-crimea-locals-prefer-moscow-to-kiev/ ) . 
  that 's not police though , that 's cossacks . 
  i 'm not sure about their legal status , but i do n't think that our laws allow them to attack people . 
  do n't know why pussy riot have n't sued them . 
  the last offense was the participation in an inconsistent with the city authorities actions in support of ukraine , when several activists of december 5 , 2014 for a few minutes blocked myasnitskaya street in central moscow , prevented the passage of transport and lit fireworks , according to the verdict .

  afaik it has quite problematic wind conditions due to nearby mountains . 
  well , according to [ the russian wiki ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%98%d0%bc%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%b3%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%86%d0%b8%d1%8f_%d0%b2_%d0%a0%d0%be%d1%81%d1%81%d0%b8%d1%8e#.d0.9e.d1.81.d0.bd.d0.be.d0.b2.d0.bd.d1.8b.d0.b5_.d1.81.d1.82.d1.80.d0.b0.d0.bd.d1.8b_.d0.b8.d1.81.d1.85.d0.be.d0.b4.d0.b0_.d0.b8.d0.bc.d0.bc.d0.b8.d0.b3.d1.80.d0.b0.d0.bd.d1.82.d0.be.d0.b2_.d0.b2_.d0.a0.d0.be.d1.81.d1.81.d0.b8.d1.8e ) , about 95 % of all immigrants are from the cis , baltic states and georgia . 
  too bad you have n't even provided something to ignore . 
  if you call something fact it wo n't become one , that 's wishful thinking . 
  you should educate yourself on what the word `` fact '' means . 
  hint : there were no facts in your message up there . 
   my argument , however , is that both logic and political usage in ukraine point in one direction , that of the terror-famine being genocidal . 
  this is not how scientific argument looks like . 
  no hard verifiable facts , just a lot of hand-waving . 
  if stalin wanted to `` teach the ukrainians a bloody lesson '' , why there are [ lots of documents ] ( http://www.rusarchives.ru/publication/hunger-ussr/1932.shtml ) confirming food help sent to ukraine ? 
   [ ... ] they made no efforts to provide relief [ ... ] and this is just plain wrong . 
  see above . 
  just no . 
  please . 
   russia purposely killed millions of ukrainians , often so russians could eat . 
  provide credible sources . 
  oh wait , you ca n't because there are n't any . 
   vladimir lenin ( real surname blank ) was of jewish/swedish/kalmyk origin . 
  lenin 's real surname was ulyanov . 
  blank was maiden name of his mother . 
  eliminating a * class * is not equal to eliminating people . 
  considering that there were plenty of people in the communist party who were originally of the `` wrong '' class , i 'm pretty sure physical elimination is n't what lenin meant . 
  what ? 
  are you sure you are n't confusing yuschenko with yanukovich ? 
  all factors that resulted in holodomor ( natural conditions , actions of the soviet government , etc. ), 
  affected ukrainian and russian and other people similarly . 
  this is not the case with the armenian genocide . 
   your , and other russians arguments are similar to the turkish position in regards to the armenian genocide . 
  how exactly are they similar ? 
  [ have at it . 
  ] ( http://www.rusarchives.ru/publication/hunger-ussr/1932.shtml ), 
  the holodomor is n't a simple and oh so common case of `` one ethnicity killing another '' , it was a complex event where several different factors combined with a disastrous outcome . 
  however , it is often portrayed as a simple case of `` russians [ or soviets ] killing [ freedom-loving ] ukrainians '' , first by nazi propaganda , then by the west during the cold war . 
  hence the controversy . 
  personally , as a russian i feel insulted every time it is portrayed as a `` genocide of ukrainians '' : this way millions of russians ( and other people , of course ) who died during holodomor go unnoticed . 
  holodomor was n't the first not war-related famine in r.e. / ussr/russia . 
  it was the last , though . 
   you 're right , except there were n't errors , that was the plan . 
  source ? 
  too bad science does not work like that , and a popular opinion is n't necessarily correct . 
   scholars disagree on the relative importance of natural factors and bad economic policies as causes of the famine but believe it was a long term plan of joseph stalin , an attempt to eliminate the ukrainian independence movement . 
  this is false , there is no single agreement between historians that there was such a plan . 
  moreso , there are no direct historical evidence of that , although some fact could be , ah , creatively interpreted . 
   michael ellman of the university of amsterdam argues that , in addition to deportations , internment in the gulag camps and shootings , there is evidence that stalin used starvation as a weapon in his war against the peasantry . 
  he analyses the actions of the soviet authorities , two of commission and one of omission [ ... ] too bad he forgot to analyze unclassified communist party documents confirming that massive amounts of food and grain were sent to starving regions . 
  this fact completely contradicts the idea of `` starvation as a weapon '' . 
   genocide scholar adam jones stresses that many of the actions of the soviet leadership during 1931 -- 32 should be considered genocidal . 
  not only did the famine kill millions , it took place against `` a backdrop of persecution , mass execution , and incarceration clearly aimed at undermining ukrainians as a national group '' honestly , this speaks more of this `` scholar '' than about anything else . 
  soviet repressions were n't targeted at ukrainians as a national group , peasants of all ethnicities suffered more or less equally . 
  if you 're interested , you can start studying holodomor with [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.com/the-years-hunger-agriculture-industrialization/dp/0333311078 ) . 
  wikipedia is n't a good source . 
  unclassified party documents , on the other hand , i do find quite trustworthy . 
  and , of course , you have credible historical sources to back your words ... oh wait , you do n't . 
  holodomor deniers who simplify it to a `` wide-spread drought '' are wrong , but what you wrote there is also a giant load of bull . 
  there are tons of documents confirming food help sent to ukraine , for starters , and the famine affected other areas as well , it was n't limited to ukraine . 
  because it was not a genocide . 
  the famine was indeed partly man-made , but there are no historical sources confirming the intent . 
  yeah , i 've just misunderstood the map . 
  yeah , i 've just misunderstood the map . 
  it seems that i completely misunderstood the map . 
  except it does n't . 
  international airspace is international airspace . 
  tu-160 's [ flew ] ( https://i.imgur.com/iardjtm.jpg ) pretty much the optimal route as far as i can see . 
  it already quite long as it is , do you want it perhaps 1.5 times longer so nobody 's feelings are hurt ? 
   the tu-160 's have been taking a strange flight path around europe as a similar show of force . 
  ~ ~ a show of force ? 
  they took that flight path exactly because the turkish airspace is closed for russian military aircraft . ~ ~ disregard this , i 've completely misunderstood the map . 
   also in crimea most people were flown in , when the russian army invaded it , just to make them settle there and participate in the questionable `` referendum '' . 
  are you suggesting that most of 2-something million people currently living crimea were ... flown in just before the referendum ? 
  or i just horribly misunderstood you ? 
   some people from the demonstration are dead , some of them are hostages .
