  santa claus , obviously . 
  if by `` investigate '' you mean `` watch some videos on youtube where crimean tatar activists and right sector guys fight policemen and do n't allow technicians to the site '' , then yes . 
   the preparators probably just thought that if the population wo n't get any electricity there , they will start to question the authorities , why they are n't able to provide electricity . 
  welcome to xxi century , where everybody and their grandma owns pocket-size computers connected to the world-wide information network . 
  do you seriously think that the population of crimea does n't yet know what happened , and thanks to whom there is no electricity ? 
  there is no need in propaganda , ukrainian far-right manage to demonise themselves just fine . 
  i do n't think that this act of terrorism affects mainland russia in any way , including `` st. petersburg kgb junta '' . 
  it shows very well what some ukrainians think of crimeans , though . 
  so , the point is to make lives of all crimeans as difficult as possible , including maybe 0.01 % of that population who `` invaded '' crimea in 2014 ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  occupants meaning people who lived in crimea for generations ? 
   the first article is about putin hiding his daughters from media . 
  the second one tells that russia cant afford a war considering her economy state . 
  the choice of words , though . 
   russian state controlled media are plain retarded lying with each second word . 
  i do n't think i can remember one occurence of tass or other credible news agency lying . 
   i read economists saying between 40 and 60 % that 's the exports , not gdp . 
  large part of the russian economy is oriented on the domestic market . 
  that 's also the reason why the fall of the ruble does n't equals the fall of the russian economy . 
   what is wrong with kasparov.ru ? 
  give me an example . 
  it 's pants-on-head retarded . 
  of course , it made the difference of survival for many soviet people . 
  according to anastas mikoyan ( stalin 's foreign trade minister ) , without it , the wwii would 've last for another year or year and a half , and that would 've meant millions of deaths . 
   kasparov.ru you ca n't be serious . 
   ussr had a very weak manufacturing capacity all the us aid amounted for about 15 % ( iirc ) of the `` tools '' of the victory . 
  not bad , sure , but not exactly decisive either . 
  it 's in europe because it 's got to be close to launch sites . 
  there is no way to intercept a ballistic missile when it 's going down with all that speed , so ballistic shield in on the us soil makes no sense . 
  one young man did it for them .

  not all satire is based on dark humour , not all dark humour is satire . 
  and do n't get me wrong , i am not saying that calling for censorship is ok . ch shoud n't be banned , satire or no satire , offensive or not . 
  i just ca n't stand when people use the wrong words , when they talk about something they do n't fully understand . 
  all those events happened before ch shooting which gave them widespread publicity . 
  by the way , about sensitive ... why the hell [ it 's apparently against the law to poke some fun at ch ? 
  [ satire is n't about being funny . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/satire ) ch is an offensive dark humour , but it 's hardly satire . 
   no one has claim it , it defeats the purpose of a terrorist attack . 
  huh ? 
  is [ claimed ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/islamic-state-claims-it-downed-russian-airliner-but-cause-remains-unclear ) they did it . 
  nope , it 's not legal for several years state-wise and for longer in some regions . 
  and no , it is not the main or even important reason behind the tragedies like this one in romania and earlier in the `` lame horse '' club in russia . 
  too many people in the building and not enough exits , that 's the recipe for a disaster . 
  i 'm quite sure there are some regulations about that which , sadly , were not followed . 
  i could n't care less about the country of origin of / u/zetzet . 
  we 're talking about them because apparently he thinks that unarmed approach ( lithuania-like ) would work against the government brought to power by the armed ultranationalist mob in kiev . 
   but if you create a armed conflict ( and for that you need gru guys taking over police stations ) , then you polarise the public that leads to grassroot violence . 
  eventually lots of people start dying and civil war erupts . 
  no , taking over police stations does n't create an armed conflict . 
  using the army against civilian targets does . 
  it also leads to `` lots of people start dying '' : one would need heavy weapons for that . 
  taking over police stations also does n't polarise the public . 
  making sure that the russian language will never be regional official language in the russian-speaking region does this . 
  praising banderovtsy as national heroes also does n't help . 
  ( oh , and by the way , kiev crowd dealt with the police just fine without cia guys or something like that , so no , you do n't * need * gru for that . 
  it would help a little , though . ), 
   oh , and driving tanks over people is caring ? 
  i did not say that . 
  there are different levels of , uh , not caring . 
  just compare civilian casualties in both cases , it 's kinda obvious . 
   whataboutism you obviously do n't know [ the meaning of this word . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ), 
  no , it was n't crucial . 
  ( arguing without providing actual arguments is a game for two . 
  pointless one , but fun . ), 
  and the leaders alone could not do shit if they got no support , even assuming they all were indeed `` gru officers '' , so this argument does n't mean much . 
   in the first months since the war , they routinely tortured and often murdered pro-ukrainian activists , local council members , etc. 
  they were terrorists . 
  if this is your criterion of terrorism , then both sides of the conflict are terrorists . 
  how many people were tortured and murdered by maidan crowd , huh ? 
  oh wait , it 's all okay if it 's for the right cause , am i right ? 
   besides , the russian soldiers who took part in the sloviansk takeover were not `` armed protesters '' . 
  there were no russian soldiers there . 
  let 's also dial down on `` it was all russian gru undercover work '' while we 're at it , k ? 
   armed protesters are n't a threat in your opinion ? 
  they are , of course . 
  just like the armed protesters in kiev were . 
  the only difference is that `` the international community '' asked yanukovich not to use the army against citizens of ukraine , and looked the other way when the new government did exactly this . 
   no people because like i said we never brought any guns so launching air strikes against people who are n't armed did n't seem right even to the ussr probably . 
  the victims of the first air strike in donbass were unarmed too . 
  and even if they were , using heavy weaponry against a bunch of lightly armed militants in the middle of the city is as wrong as it gets . 
   timeline of events  soviet military units seize  soviet paratroopers seize  soviet military units seize  soviet military units unsuccessfully try to seize etc. 
  that 's not comparable to what happened in donbass . 
  no , of course , but by using heavy and imprecise weaponry ukrainian army demonstrated exactly how much they care about civilians in this area . 
  actually , the entire donbass population are russian gru officers . 
   pro-russian separatists immediately started as terrorists not protesters . 
  i do n't think you use the word [ `` terrorist '' ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/terrorist?s=t ) correctly . 
  armed protesters are armed protesters , not terrorists . 
   the only things we did were protests and ussr still attacked the protesters , they actually managed to bring tanks in . 
  how many people were killed with heavy weaponry ( like grads or attack aircraft ) ? 
  wait , so your cities were attacked by ussr army or what ? 
  ussr government did n't used heavy weaponry against you , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  donbass events were escalated by ukrainian government . 
  well , according to [ this ] ( http://www.gazeta.ru/social/news/2015/10/31/n_7833635.shtml ) , the crew of the plane complained about some problems with the engines during past week . 
  yep , both area and population are about 1.5 times larger . 
  please stop your whataboutism . 
  okay , your arguments are quite convincing ... oh wait .
