  he very obviously meant that `` there was no option to stay in ukraine '' , not that `` there was no option to retain status quo '' . 
  i agree that the second complaint would be completely legitimate . 
  autonomy , not independence . 
  it is an option to stay in ukraine . 
  [ shadow economy . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3qoemv/un_80_of_ukrainians_live_below_the_poverty_line/cwh00iu ) i 'm quite sure that the real average wage is significantly higher . 
   aight , so not article selection , or selecting facts or tone , but specifically making false factual claims ? 
  yes , or at least making nonexisting things appear without outright lying , like in that example about `` anti-gay crackdown '' . 
  my mistake , it was n't wp , it was [ nyt ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/opinion/russias-anti-gay-crackdown.html?_r=0 ) : `` the law could mean that any olympic athlete , trainer , reporter , family member or fan who is gay -- or suspected of being gay , or just accused of being gay -- can go to jail '' . 
  the law * could * mean , or it could not , so technically not a lie . 
  ( the actual law does n't mean anything near that , of course . ), 
   well , what do you mean by `` inventive reporting '' ? 
  `` reporting '' something that is n't there . 
  inventing things . 
  like that one time when washington post told that under the new russian law a person suspected of being gay can be jailed . 
  of course it does n't . 
  i mean yes , there are things that would n't be published in the fear of broadcast license being withdrawn or other similar consequences , but that 's far from `` financing , directing and vetting all the media outlets '' . 
   i 'm not quite sure what you are saying here . 
  are you saying that being critical of the government is inventive reporting ? 
  i 'm saying that being owned by the government or being independent is unrelated to the quality of reporting and the standards of journalism ( or lack thereof ) . 
  tass is an example of 100 % state-owned media that will never ever publish a conspiration theory or something like that . 
  daily mail , on the other hand , is independent , yet if they report about the sun not being out at night , i 'd better go double check . 
   the same is true of russian media outlets , that does n't mean we should stoop to their level . 
  quite a bit of english-speaking media sources are already there . 
   russian media is directed , financed and vetted by the kremlin , who has exclusive and pervading influence over what is broadcast . 
  actually , each article in the russian media is written by putin himself . 
  this is not a discussion about the availability of critical and/or independent media . 
  it is not related to the quality of reporting . 
  for instance , tass is fully and directly state-owned , yet i 'd be very , very surprised if they will stoop down to , ah , inventive reporting . 
   also , i do not like using this term `` western '' ; it does not really mean anything apart from countries that share a similar ideology . 
  yet the general trends in english-speaking media ( at least regarding russia ) are quite palpable . 
  no , i 'm saying that overgeneralizing is bad . 
  there are respectful russian media who did n't publish any conspiracy theories about mh17 , and who have decent standards of journalism . 
  who actually * report * things , not invent them . 
  thing is , rferl is n't western equivalent of `` russian media '' . 
  that would be the entire western ( english-speaking ) media , including fox , daily fail and other respected sources of bullshit . 
  maidan mob , of course . 
  without anti-air rockets , but with molotov cocktails . 
  they brought destruction , you say ? . . 
  remind me please , who first used heavy weaponry against civilians in this conflict ? 
  please clarify how it was taken out of context . 
   remember how they held `` democratic '' elections ? 
  well putin in a tv interview months later ( a few months ago from today ) said that the decission to take crimea happened weeks in advance . 
  except that 's not what he said . 
  what he said is ( basically ) that they ( putin & co ) figured out weeks in advance ( through secret polls iirc ) that the local population will support that move , and then they supported local separatists . 
  considering that later polls show that the local population of crimea agrees with the referendum , yeah , it was more or less democratic , as in `` will of the people '' . 
  there is no logical link between * you * not having much information about something you pretend to care , and that something not doing fine . 
  oh , and about knowing the state language ... you should learn from your neighbours who took the language of a tiny minority and made it second official . 
  sorry , but you 're doing it wrong . 
   we have very little information  i 'm afraid every one of them will disappear quite soon , have you ever heard about such a thing called `` logic '' ? 
  some people think it 's rather useful . 
  speak russian ? 
  of course , you wo n't achieve much in a multinational country if you do n't speak * lingua franca * of that country . 
  just like you wo n't achieve much in the eu if you do n't speak one of the mainstream languages . 
  behave like a russian though , what does that mean ? 
   modern russia does n't have that ? 
  university education is free if you pass the tests ( passing levels depend on the university ) ; that 's one-time offer though . 
  healthcare is free ( technically , it 's guaranteed by mandatory healthcare insurance ) . 
  of course , there are also private doctors and clinics ; some are better than state-owned , some are not ( but still want your money ) . 
  that 's why learning each republic 's national language was mandatory , am i right ? 
   look at destruction of catholic churches in eastern ukraine by orthodox russians . 
  what ? 
  by astolphe de custine , actually . 
  gays , of course . 
  there is a massive anti-gay hysteria in the russian media blaming them for all kinds of problems , did n't you knew that ? 
   but i am arguing with somebody with an agenda do n't measure others by yourself . 
  so any government should step down if somebody gathers a mob in the capital , instead of cracking down on said mob ? 
  those `` unarmed civilians '' [ managed to kill at least 18 police officers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_people_killed_during_euromaidan#police_officers.27_deaths ) . 
   implementing democratic reform i 'm pretty sure replacing one corrupt oligarch by another corrupt oligarch is n't related to democracy . 
  yeah . 
  putin also eats babies daily . 
  scary stuff . 
  it 's kinda hard to delete what never existed . 
  i know , it is n't easy for youngsters to imagine how to live without social media , but yes , older people sometimes do this . 
  he had n't any social media accounts ( except one on a pretty obscure hist-rec forum ) months before the incident . 
  he also specifically said ( about a month before mh17 ) that the only legit source of info is their official site . 
  what 's the most amusing thing is that people who spread this `` separatist twitter '' bullshit ca n't even get their facts straight : twitter or facebook are n't pretty popular or widespread in russia . 
  vkontakte is . 
  there is vk group called `` strelkov news '' , and yes , they hurried to publish info and even bragged about `` military transport '' that turned out to be mh17 . 
  they also specifically said ( long before mh17 and repeated immediately after ) that they are sympathisers and not some official info source , but somehow this was `` missed '' . 
  edit : [ here ] ( http://icorpus.ru/zayavlenie-strelkova-bespoletnuyu-zonu/ ) the official site of the separatists says ( two weeks before mh17 ) that vk group `` strelkov news '' is fake and is used to publish false information . 
  ... who does n't even have twitter account , or any social media accounts for that matter . 
   oppression of opposition liiiike ? 
  like putting `` opposition '' to jail for throwing stones at and injuring policemen ? 
   control of media freedom of the press does n't mean that press is obliged to publish everything . 
  most people in russia support putin and could n't care less about the so-called `` liberal opposition '' ( and there are reasons for that ) , so why is it so surprising that said opposition is underrepresented in the russian media ? 
   repression of political opponents without abiding by rule of law procedures ; these include single-party state , and cult of personality . 
  how exactly this is related to russia and putin ? 
   if they ca n't learn basic estonian and latvian as their second language to obtain citizenship why would they deserve full rights of named countries ? 
  because they live there for quite a long time , since the times knowing native language was n't a requirement . 
  it 's that simple . 
   the only culture you value is occupation . 
  and you wonder why russians ca n't learn basic estonian/latvian/whatever . 
  why bother learning that useless dying language and get citizenship when those butthurt balts will always look down on you as an occupant ? 
  there are many minorities in russia who do are all right , like tatars or buryats . 
  maybe the problem is with finno-ugrics ? 
  not being able to use mother tongue in any sort of official situation in a place one have been living for the entire life counts as being forced to change ethnic identity in my books . 
  but i 'm sure you 're okay with it , and fuck all russians who value their culture and do n't want to become estonians/latvians/whatever . 
  ethnic cleansing is wrong no matter how you try to justify it . 
  you had the chance to be better than us , instead you chose to be worse .
