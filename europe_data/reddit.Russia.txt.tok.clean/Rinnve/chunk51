  even in russia no minority is given the choice of either stripping their identity or getting the fuck out . 
  whataboutism . 
  soviets did many bad things , most of them to us russians ( for instance guess who were the majority in gulag , or who were the victim in the first case of a government killing their own people with wmds ) . 
  this is irrelevant to the situation . 
  baltics left ussr with a significant russian minority , what matters is how those countries chose to deal with it . 
  i do n't think that seeing borderline ethnic cleansing as a good thing is a good thing . 
   self-imposed ban to import food is funny . 
  i do n't think eu farmers would agree with you . 
   now russia can say economy is bad because the sanctions which is bullshit i do n't think this line about russian economy being bad because of sanctions was ever used by the russian media . 
  china , probably . 
  it 's not related to gay harassment . 
  tesak 's followers , though , [ are under investigation for it . 
  the irony here is so thick you can cut it with a knife and put on bread instead of butter . 
   what did bbc leave out that 's so crucial , specifically speaking ? 
  gays who live normal lives in russia . 
  sorry , i ca n't give examples , for some unknown reason bbc does n't do documentaries about them . 
  also , please do n't forget about that `` many have killed themselves over it '' . 
  where did you got that ? 
   if you want to believe bbc lied i quite clearly said that they did n't lie in this video . 
  they told the truth . 
  just not all of it . 
  they take rare cases and portray them as if it 's the norm in russia . 
   i assume you 'd also accuse the new york times and the guardian of lying . 
  the guardian do n't know , but nyt lied at least once , and i mean actually lied . 
  in [ the article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/opinion/russias-anti-gay-crackdown.html ) about `` anti-gay crackdown '' : `` the law could mean that any olympic athlete , trainer , reporter , family member or fan who is gay -- or suspected of being gay , or just accused of being gay -- can go to jail . '' anybody could read the law and see for themselves that this is a blatant lie , and no person who is gay , or suspected of being gay , or accused of being gay can go to jail under that law . 
   there 's a reason why putin has an 83 % approval rating , state ran media is strong . 
  it is always amusing when i get directly or indirectly accused of being brainwashed , considering that i do n't watch or read russian media at all ( except when i need to re-check something ) . 
  also , what 's with `` many have killed themselves over it '' , huh ? 
   there 's actually a ton of statistics in the documentaries . 
  well , it could be that i 've missed it ( i have n't watched it through , just skimmed to get the gist of it . ), 
  care to point to it ? 
  extremism is n't exclusive for russia , and this anti-gay group [ is under investigation ] ( http://queerussia.info/2014/08/16/6080/#sthash.6csszrtr.dpbs ) while their leader is already in prison , so that kinda ruins your message that it is somehow supported by russian laws/government . 
  but mainly my question was about this :  many have killed themselves over it the fuck are you talking about ? 
   you clearly do n't know the law then at all . 
  that 's exactly what it does . 
  [ this is the text of the law . 
  ] ( http://www.zakonrf.info/koap/6.21/ ) please find where it outlaws showing `` gay '' affection ( assuming that it is not intentionally aimed at children ) . 
   so you 're telling me bbc is lying , that what they filmed was fabricated ? 
  lying is for noobs . 
  professional ~ ~ propagandists ~ ~ journalists use truth , just carefully `` prepared '' . 
  notice the complete lack of numbers and statistics in that material , and how they press on emotions . 
   youtube had trouble for a while when there was a surge of videos showing kidnapped gays ( mainly teenagers ) being humiliated on camera . 
  the goal was for everyone in their school to know they 're gay , especially their parents . 
  many have killed themselves over it the fuck are you talking about ? 
   gay propaganda law dictates that you are not to show any sort of affection that may be seen as `` gay '' where children may be . 
  no it does n't . 
   but none of that changes the fact that russia 's economy is terribly weak it 's not enough to call something `` fact '' for that to become fact . 
  it 's actually pretty easy . 
  67 % of exports are minerals , another 10 % are metals , so about 25 % of russian exports are not minerals or metals . 
  so that `` nothing else '' that russia exports ( besides minerals and metals ) is worth about $ 100 billion a year . 
  you should educate yourself on what default means . 
  hint : it 's not `` economic collapse '' . 
  whatever . 
  between us two , it 's quite clear for me who 's brainwashed . 
  i hope you 'll get better . 
   they got better , but they are still nowhere close to western cars . 
  eh , they are on par with cheap renaults/dacias ( which they basically are to some extent ) . 
  about export , there is little point for renault-nissan to move russian-made ladas to eu when they could sell dacias which are manufactured way closer to their customers . 
   but lada ? 
  seriously ? 
  have you ever driven one ? 
  have you ever driven one produced after mid-2000 ? 
  they got better , you know . 
  ( they also got less russian , though , considering that avtovas is now owned by renault-nissan . ), 
  daily mail is pretty close in quality ( or rather lack thereof ) to moskovski komsomolets , which published that fake about poroshenko , so no , it 's not false equivalence . 
   but you seem brainwashed enough already . 
  it seems that you 're talking with my flair , not me . 
  hint : i do n't read/watch russian media except for when i need to re-check something that was published elsewhere . 
  russian exports without any minerals in 2013 were bigger than total russian exports in 1999 . 
  but feel free to repeat that nonsense about russia being `` gas station in disguise '' . 
   to 45 dollars today . 
  except the article is n't about today , it 's about what happened between 2004 and 2014 . 
   russian mass media that again . 
  one russian yellow tabloid publishes some shit , and it is suddenly just `` russian media '' . 
  it 's just as retarded as pretending daily fail is `` british media '' or something like that . 
  considering that the article is itself a propaganda , your comment is quite funny . 
  no sources ( assuming google translate is correct and `` l\u00e4hteet '' means `` sources '' ) they listed mentions lgbt or this `` low birth rate '' bullshit , and two sources are completely unrelated ( finnish `` black lumberjacks '' , seriously ? ), 
  why two years ? 
  this article compares 2004 and 2014 . 
  that 's a jump from about $ 40 in early 2004 to $ 140 in 2008 to $ 100 in early 2014 . 
  `` fast-forward a dozen years : taxes on russian energy exports remain low and have recently been further reduced to combat the fall in global demand . '' did you even read the article ? 
  bad science is so bad . 
  no accounting for the massive growth of oil prices ( kinda hard to compete with that ) , and info about `` low taxes on energy exports '' is just plain incorrect : according to [ lukoil 's management ] ( http://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2013/03/06/ceraweek_rossijskie_neftyaniki_pozhalovalis_na_nalogi ) , about $ 71 of each $ 100 of sold oil are taxes . 
   \u0142orks i hate polish alphabet . 
  that rz cz sz thing is already quite confusing ( why do n't just use more diacritics ? 
  ) , but you also have l which is not l but actually ... w. vowel !, 
  what the hell is wrong with you guys ? 
  this is for history to decide , not you . 
  just snyder being good old hating russia 's guts snyder . 
   what must not be mentioned is that russia has not achieved its goals in ukraine . 
  russia 's goals in ukraine were to not allow a military resolution of the conflict . 
  putin stated that the start in 2014 , and it was repeated countless times . 
  the only thing that surprises me ( just a little , though ) that this is time . 
  it 's supposed to be high-quality journalism , not this load of nonsense . 
  it 's in the chain of command of the army , i 'm pretty sure we 're safe , 
  as the saying goes , russia has two allies : russian army and russian fleet . 
  generally speaking , i think this is true . 
  i mean , we have some friends , but if shit hits the fan big time , we 're on our own . 
  exactly . 
  so why should one be surprised that not everybody in baltics manage to learn not one but two very different but equally difficult languages ?
