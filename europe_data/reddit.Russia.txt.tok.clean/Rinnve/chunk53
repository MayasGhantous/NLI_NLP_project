  also , it 's not a putin 's idea originally , he just showed his approval . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.novayagazeta.ru/articles/2016/11/01/70381-ponyatie-rossiyskaya-natsiya-dolzhno-byt-zakrepleno-v-konstitutsii ) is the article about the idea which cites the author : vyacheslav mikhailov . 
  he specifically says there that it 's not about ethnicity . 
  geneva conventions do not require any insignia . 
  the only requirement is for uniforms to be distinct from civilian clothes . 
   russians savagely and brutally raped german civilians , no one was spared [ citation needed ], 
  more important difference is that the shock therapy in poland [ was done with international help and mostly succeeded . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balcerowicz_plan ), 
  you 're moving goalposts . 
  this is a pretty bad thing in a discussion , do n't do it . 
  in your initial comment , you draw a picture of peaceful lithuania being raided by evil russia for no reason . 
  as we can see here , lithuania did their share of raiding too . 
  `` after crossing the lithuania -- russia border , lithuanians began pillaging and burning various villages while russians hastily assembled a defensive force , commanded by dmitry minin ( boyar of dmitry donskoy ) and akinfiev shuba ( boyar of vladimir the bold ) . 
  [ 4 ] lithuanians killed semion , son of prince dmitry of starodub-on-the-klyazma . 
  they then captured obolensk killing prince konstantin obolensky . 
  [ 4 ] on november 21 , 1368 , the lithuanians defeated the russian defense forces on the trosna river and killed its commanders and other boyars . 
  dmitry donskoy retreated to moscow kremlin , behind the walls that were completed just few months before , and ordered to burn the posad so that the russian defense would have a better position . 
  the lithuanians surrounded the kremlin , burned and looted , but retreated three days later without a serious attempt at taking the stronghold . '' 2 seconds of googling . 
  you can indulge in demagoguery all you want , that would n't change the history . 
  you make it look like it was one-sided from the start . 
  it was n't . 
  in the middle ages , pretty much everybody raided neighbors . 
  do you mean '' \u042c '' ? 
  it 's a soft sign , does n't even correspond to any sound , just softens the letter before it . 
  it ca n't be the first letter in a word for that reason . 
  '' \u0411 '' ( '' \u0431 '' in lowercase ) is basically the same as latin `` b '' ( lowercase `` b '' ) . 
  no , it 's a loanword ( latin `` biographia '' ) , so no general rules are applied here . 
  the one who said that line about gas chamgers is a blogger sergei leleka . 
  is your question about having a significant role/standing related to nosik or parkhomenko ( both journalists and bloggers ) ? 
  there must be a misunderstanding here . 
  i was initially talking about blogger [ who wrote about navalny and gas chamber . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/59b0cu/russias_flotilla_flop_moscow_wanted_to_impress/d96zqqv/ ), 
  should they ? 
  they are well known and respected journalists , that 's enough . 
  all things you 've listed are either gross exaggerations or simply did n't happen ( nobody shoot anybody , for instance ) ; and there were other things that you did n't mention ( like weather conditions ) . 
  how about you read a good book instead of spreading misinformation ? 
  well , according to [ this explanation ] ( http://www.pravda-tv.ru/2016/10/22/261689/admiral-kuznecov-ili-nemnogo-slov-o-dyme ) ( i 'm not an expert at all , but at least it sounds logical ) , the engine is ( a ) old , ( b ) was n't quite properly maintained for several reasons and ( c ) is forced to go on max speed to not fall back behind other ships . 
   deliberately no . 
  [ modern historical research does n't support this view . 
  ] ( https://www.amazon.com/years-hunger-agriculture-1931-1933-industrialization/dp/0333311078 ), 
  do n't overgeneralize . 
  this asshat [ is already being criticized ] ( http://echo.msk.ru/news/1861570-echo.html ) . 
  a copy ? 
  it 's a completely different reading of the same book . 
  some sort of technical report that could be checked by independent experts . 
  why do you change words ? 
  `` reporting '' = / = `` source '' . 
  credible source is something that could be cross-checked by independent parties . 
  pure facts , basically . 
  reporting is something entirely different . 
  so the answer to the initial question ( is there any credible , politically-unbiased sourcing for russia being behind the leaks ? ), 
  is actually `` no '' . 
  it 's not . 
  it 's the message of some not very bright person behind this twitter account . 
  wrong questions . 
  how is that going to prove that russia is indeed behinds those hacks ? 
  i 'm not talking about that intervention , i 'm talking about [ bombing yugoslavia in 1999 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legitimacy_of_the_nato_bombing_of_yugoslavia#russian_attempt_to_end_the_bombing ), 
  it is very surprising that a native english speaker has troubles with understanding the meaning of a pretty basic english word . 
  `` show '' means exactly this - show . 
  not tell that it exists somewhere but you ca n't actually see it so you should just believe . 
  fact 1 : nato was created as an anti-russian ( among other things ) alliance . 
  `` to keep the russians out '' and all that . 
  fact 2 : nato , while `` defensive '' on paper , is known for committing offensive operations of questionable legality at best ( including deliberately bombing civilian targets ) . 
  why should we think that we 're completely safe , and nato would n't attack us for some reason or other ? 
  blah blah blah . 
  the fact is , nearly all military actions committed by this `` defensive '' alliance were in fact offensive . 
  nato had no business in yugoslavia . 
   yes . 
  please , show us . 
   trump himself has major russian investors ( we ca n't say who exactly , because he refuses to release his tax documents ) how then can you say that he has major russian investors at all ? 
   his campaign manager was viktor yanukovych 's chief political advisor for seven years pr firm that worked for russian government until 2015 also worked for us government before . 
  does it mean that one of those governments is behind another ? 
   putin 's told russians that nato is at risk of suddenly attacking them . 
  he did it because it worked . 
  or maybe because it 's true ? 
  we all remember what this `` defensive '' alliance did to yugoslavia . 
  it is already useless . 
  have fun trolling people somewhere else . 
  make me . 
  show some historical research that proves your words . 
   then the soviets used torture and imprisonment to force captured germans to build a rocket for them that they used to send a man into space . 
  uhm . 
  nice alternative history right there . 
  itt : people who ca n't read past the title . 
  no , it was n't . 
   stalin actively requested to become a full member of the trie-party agreement otl . 
  he also actively requested an alliance against germany with france and britain . 
  guess how that turned out . 
   because the vast majority of the territory of denmark consists of greenland , which is north america  * greenland , which is north america * holy shit . 
  it 's kinda obvious when you look for it , but it never occurred to me to look at the globe at [ that angle . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/greenland_\\ ( orthographic_projection \\ ) . svg/2000px-greenland _ \\ ( orthographic_projection \\ ) . svg.png ), 
  russian language was n't around 1000 years ago . 
  old east slavic is its predecessor , but it 's still different language . 
  yes , maybe not exactly * battle * badassery ( more like putting-nobility-in-place badassery ) , but absolutely no `` evil savage '' connotations . 
   as far as i know `` the terrible '' title initially came from his fearsome behaviour in battle . 
  nope , the source of this title is unclear . 
  it was n't used in any historical records written during his life , though . 
  also , `` terrible '' is a terrible translation . 
   that did your propaganda already and putin himself i 'm not russian propaganda , nor am i putin .
