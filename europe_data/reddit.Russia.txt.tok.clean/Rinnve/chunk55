  i know at least one person from there who worked here in russia more or less officially ( as of late she upgraded herself to freelance work via the internet , though , so location is not important anymore ) . 
  sigh . 
   ~ ~ russian ~ ~ media likes to overblown everything out of proportion . 
  here , you 're welcome . 
  not that it makes russian media any better , but let 's not pretend that the habit of making mountains out of molehills is somehow unique to it . 
  territory does n't matter . 
  majority of population of russia lives in the european part , and russia 's history and culture are inseparable from european ones . 
  no , you could n't . 
  my theory is / u/cpt _ ballsack was talking about something he knows little . 
  first , i 'm not your comrade . 
  second , it were your words about this retarded theory being popular . 
  you can squirm all you want , it would n't change it . 
  so not really `` popular theory '' , eh ? 
  do you even read your own links ? 
  so i 'm now a `` russian nationalist '' . 
  how cute . 
   huge  state sponsored citation needed . 
   every protest or opposition development are called us puppets or even spies , heard anything of `` agent freedom '' ? 
  and by `` every protest or opposition '' you mean navalny , of course . 
  using plural case when singular is needed is just wrong . 
   the su-25 cant reach an airliner cruise level it can , technically . 
  the cockpit insulation ( or lack thereof ) would allow to stay there only for a short time , but it can climb up there . 
  there are other facts that make this version unlikely , though . 
   popular theory floated by disinformation campaign surrounding this event is that the plane was shut down by us stealth plane what that 's the first time i ever heard of that `` theory '' . 
  if it indeed exists , it is n't popular at all . 
  [ astroturfing is n't invented in russia , you know . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_earnest_voice ), 
  if it 's not a rare occurrence , please show a couple or so of other examples of blaming the americans for something wrong in russia . 
  this merkushkin , judging by his other sayings , is obviously unwell in the head . 
  anyways , isolated example means nothing . 
  i do n't remember such rhetoric from other `` serious '' sources . 
  the point here is n't the agenda , really . 
  the point is the western media , which is allegedly `` better '' than rt , jumping to every fake and lie they can find . 
  nice straw man you have here . 
  built it yourself ? 
   but most of them at least consider the story credibility before publishing it oh really ? 
  i clearly remember the shitstorm in the western media before and during sochi olympics , where even obvious fakes and outright lies were published just to push the agenda a little more . 
   in russia , it 's common to blame the us for everything . 
  we must be living in two different russias then . 
  why are they incomparable , exactly ? 
  except that was n't him . 
  strelkov repeatedly stated * months * before accident that he does n't own any social media accounts , and named the site that publishes `` official '' information . 
  he also stated ( again , before the accident ) that the vk account '' \u0421\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0418\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044f \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430 '' not only is n't related to him , but also used to publish wrong information . 
  ( [ source ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20140815043132/http://icorpus.ru/zayavlenie-strelkova-bespoletnuyu-zonu/ ) ), 
   they accidentally shot a plane full of families going on a holiday . 
  babies , toddlers , kids , teenagers , mom 's and dads . 
  it would be a nice gesture to say : ` sorry , it was us , can you forgive us ? ', 
  i do n't think this ever happened in any similar accidents . 
  the military apparently do n't do apologizing , be it russian , ukrainian , american or otherwise . 
   notice the theme here : constantly switching narratives and stories that may have something to do with the fact that the russian media is n't some singular , central-controlled entity , but a bunch of different actors with different owners , policies , etc. 
  you 're also call `` reporting '' some things that are n't reporting , such as opinion pieces , talk shows etc. 
   their coverage got so absurd that their own journalists quitting . 
  yeah , and the majority of western media were running headlines like `` putin 's missile '' the same day the event happened . 
  because , duh , it 's * obvious * , who needs facts . 
  i fail to see how that 's any better than rt. 
  also notice the spin in this supposedly respectable newspaper : `` russian government , suggested ukraine was to blame for the crash , while most media organisations have said it was shot down by a suspected russian-made missile '' . 
  i do n't think many readers know about ukraine and russia enough to notice that those statements are n't even contradictory : ukrainian buks are russian-made . 
   here 's the crucifying civilians part by the way : https://www.yahoo.com/news/russian-tv-sparks-outrage-ukraine-child-crucifixion-claim-114839196.html?ref=gs except it is n't report about crucifying civilians , it 's report showing some woman who tells about that . 
  i do not know of * any * russian media that reported that `` crucifying '' as a fact . 
   their reporting of ukrainian luftwaffe pilots shooting down mh17 and armies of polish nato nazi mercenaries marching through villages , crucifying russian-speaking civilians in ukraine i do n't think such reporting exists outside of your sick imagination . 
  actually it was ukraine who started serious armed conflict in donbass , the so-called `` ato '' . 
  they first used heavy weaponry . 
  iirc putin quite early ( summer 2014 ) stated that he wo n't allow this conflict to be resolved by force , ukrainian side to this day stalls political resolution . 
  as for protesters in maidan , shit they 've pulled would 've guarantee lethal reaction from any police force in any first world country . 
  burning policemen alive , for example . 
  why ? 
   by the time of soviet collapse latvians were becoming a minority in their own country . 
  they became nonexistent , actually . 
   and what for ? 
  for 100 000km2 of land ? 
  for strategic reasons . 
  without that crimea business ( however you prefer to call it ) , the obvious course for the next few years would be some agreement between nato and ukraine ( if not fast-forward membership ) , booting the russian fleet from crimea and ultimately closing black sea for russia . 
  cars and home tech sit at more or less same price for about a year already , so that does n't contradicts low inflation claims ( btw it 's not 4 % , not yet ) . 
  the entire business with booting yanukovich from office day after the agreement was signed between him and more sensible opposition figures was conducted by far-right . 
  ask any pole how they feel about those bandera lovers . 
  this may have something to do with most russians not buying european-made food or drugs in the first place . 
  `` eastern poland '' is another name for western belarus and western ukraine . 
  those territories were ethnically not polish , and were subject to [ polonization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_belarus#polonization ) in the inter-war period . 
  this is how the un defines racism ( `` racial discrimination '' ) :  the term `` racial discrimination '' shall mean any distinction , exclusion , restriction , or preference based on * race , colour , descent , or national or ethnic origin * that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition , enjoyment or exercise , on an equal footing , of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political , economic , social , cultural or any other field of public life . 
   they have more resources than all of europe combined . 
  they 're the largest country on the planet . 
  shitty arguments you have there . 
  resources are located in very hard to reach areas , and largest country basically means `` have fun maintaining all this infrastructure '' ( especially considering climate conditions ) . 
  nevertheless , russia is n't going to bankrupt any time soon . 
  article like this are telling doom and gloom for about 4 years already . 
  not that many crimean tatars lived there before the ussr was even a thing , they were a minority ( albeit a significant one , about 30 % ) in the end of xix century . 
   these thugs occupied the trade unions house and started shooting on people . 
  that 's ... as far as it could be from what actually happened there . 
  all the information is out there too , yet you still spread lies . 
  why do you do this ? 
  nobody `` put a gun '' to czechia 's leaders ( that is , before other warsaw pact countries invaded ) , i very much doubt it was different with poland or bulgaria . 
   okay so if going against the ussr lands tanks in your capital oh , but that was * after * those `` puppet '' leaders of warsaw pact countries decided to land their tanks in rebellious capital , not before . 
   soldiers do you even read ? 
  `` entirely with their command '' , all the way up to the communist party . 
  nobody prevented bulgaria or poland to do exactly what czechia did ; but their leaders chose to obey ussr . 
  it seems you have some troubles with reading :  entirely with their command yes , up all the way to the communist party itself . 
  warsaw pact countries ( their communist leaders ) would 've supported czech uprising and unite against the ussr . 
  this did not happen . 
  so all those bulgarian , polish etc troops were mind controlled entirely with their command , or what ? 
  seriously , if all warsaw pact countries supported that uprising , thing would 've turned very differently .
