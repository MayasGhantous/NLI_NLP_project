  but they did n't , and not because they were forced by ussr . 
  sadly , your knowledge of xx century history is severely lacking . 
   russian tanks so the entirety of ussr , gdr , hungary , bulgaria and poland are russia now . 
  how cute . 
  there are other reasons of russia 's , ah , performance . 
  however , i 'm talking strictly about those arguments about `` natural riches '' and `` good geographic location '' . 
  why do you people constantly forget that those `` natural riches '' are located in areas extremely remote and uninhabitable , and this `` good geographic location '' means travel between different regions of russia is often longer and costlier than from one corner of eu to another ? 
   you should be way richer than you currently are due to your size , geographic location so , how exactly like 60 % of the country being in permafrost region with nonexistent infrastructure should converse to riches ? 
  yes . 
  exactly . 
  however , it was `` putin invaded georgia '' all over the western media . 
   a powerful russian weapon : the spread of false stories  president vladimir v. putin , who invaded georgia in 2008 on the scale from 1 to even , i simply ca n't . 
  post  times, 
   sources ? 
  [ `` years of hunger '' ] ( https://www.amazon.com/years-hunger-agriculture-1931-1933-industrialization/dp/0333311078 ) , of course , the most recent serious work on the subject . 
   that shows more that it has . 
  it shows that only a handful of countries consider holodomor a genocide ; and zero international organizations . 
   movement restriction + hunger = death . 
  that 's just , you know , your opinion . 
  unsupported by actual historians who researched the subject . 
   and pretty specifically this has included holodomor . 
  [ no , it does not . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor_genocide_question#other_countries_and_international_organizations ), 
   in ukraine i 'm sorry , do you have troubles with reading comprehension ? 
  two comments earlier i stated that movement restrictions were implemented not only in ukraine , but basically in all regions affected by hunger . 
  and * again * , there are no historical research that would point at movement restriction as main or even significant cause of deaths . 
  genocide has pretty specific definition , you know . 
  attack the peoples they occupied ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  superheroes , no . 
  but i do n't think you understand what price people of the ussr paid to destroy nazis . 
  not in `` famine areas '' , in famine-struck villages . 
  so that hungry villagers could n't get to famine-struck cities and make the situation there even worse . 
  anyway , the amount of people intercepted and returned/arrested is in the vicinity of ten thousands ; compared to millions affected by the famine , it 's hardly more than a side-note . 
  soviet soldiers represent soviet soldiers , and i do n't get how their sacrifice in the countries freed of nazis is related to the things nkvd did in the ussr . 
  except , of course , if somebody wants that people view soviets as a whole only , painted pitch black . 
  monuments in question are specifically for soviet soldiers , though . 
  for estonians , maybe . 
  other ethnicities were ... more affected by nazis . 
  yes ( see `` years of hunger '' , p. 426 and on , also wikipedia page on the topic ) . 
  restrictions on movement did n't have significant effect on the outcome of the famine , to worse or better . 
  it 's not like poor villagers were locked in by army or whatever while everybody else enjoyed plenty of food . 
  when soviet army did kill `` million of innocents '' ? 
  did you just compared deaths of soviet soldiers to ... `` baking delicious cakes '' ? 
  and no , people used to remember who paid the blood price for winning that war . 
  now people are seriously arguing that soviets were no better that nazis . 
  it was , just like in every other national republic of the ussr . 
  not sure about stalin 's time , but later it was second official language , and it was taught in schools . 
   ukrainians , who had to survive the genocide have a downvote for historical ignorance . 
  holodomor affected not only ukraine , great amount of russians and kazakhs suffered too , and anybody that forgets that is pushing propaganda about `` genocide '' , willingly or unwillingly . 
  those monuments are/were there in the memory of millions soviet soldiers , russian in large part , who gave their lives in fight against nazis . 
  yet people often seem to remember only bad things about ussr , completely forgetting this sacrifice . 
  criticism ? 
  more like black-washing . 
  trying to stick soviet crimes to russians is terribly insulting to millions of russian victims of stalinizm and their relatives . 
  and i 'm not ivan . 
  i suggest you to drop this attitude and remain civil . 
   russians are praised for being victorious over nazis what ? 
  i do n't know about your media , but here nobody forgets that it was joint effort across the entire ussr . 
  well , nobody except few narrow-minded nationalists . 
  that 's pretty convenient position . 
  too bad it does n't translate too well to millions of russian victims of stalinizm and their relatives . 
  russian ? 
  soviet . 
  soviets were n't russians only , starting from the very top . 
  local party officers who implemented policies that led to holodomor were ukrainians themselves . 
  i suspect it was similar in the baltics . 
  according to generalplan ost , 50 % of latvians were to be eliminated . 
  under the ussr , a large percentage of the population was deported , many were executed . 
  in 1989 latvians only comprised 52 % of latvia 's population . 
  so german occupation would have most likely been much worse , but soviet occupation was pretty horrific . 
  your attempt to compare results of soviet occupation to generalplan ost is painfully obvious . 
  under the ussr , a large percentage of the population was deported , many were executed . 
  too bad you do n't mention actual numbers , because this `` large '' percentage is about 10 % tops , and more likely even less . 
  not that it 's good or anything , but then you mention that `` in 1989 latvians only comprised 52 % of latvia 's population '' , implying that this was mainly result of deportations and executions , which it is actually not . 
  you should feel bad for that attempt at manipulation . 
  bokeh is certainly shopped , details on the left and right sides of the photo ( grass on the left and grass between the tracks on the right ) are blurred differently at the same distance to the camera . 
  it says nothing about the original photo , though , only about sloppy post-processing work . 
  if you mean crimean tatars , they [ came there after ( proto - ) russians . 
   ussr caused famine in ukraine which killed millions , replaced dead people with russians / r/badhistory material right there . 
  i 'm pretty sure they are separate genetic entity * within * european gene pool . 
  get off your high horse . 
  ukrainians , who were `` not so lucky '' according to you , were historically oppressed by poles , not russia , to the point of several violent counter-reactions . 
  it was poles , not russia , who tried to erase ukrainian identity when they got `` eastern poland '' after 1918 . 
  and no , russia never really tried to `` wipe off the face of the earth '' any nation : somehow after centuries of such `` trying '' all nations in the butthurt belt are alive and quite well . 
  compare that to the fate of us natives , who got decimated in about the same period of time . 
  about hitler , do n't even try to mention him . 
  [ nobody in europe is clear of that . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93polish_non-aggression_pact ), 
  [ educate yourself . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/khmelnytsky_uprising#background ), 
  too bad that you do n't know your own history . 
  does the name `` bohdan khmelnytsky '' ring any bells ? 
  or , for something more recent , polonisation of `` eastern poland '' ( inhabited , surprisingly , * not * by poles ) ? 
  thanks , bot . 
   in one of the vaino 's ( or whoever really wrote it ) presentations are you sure that this presentation is related to vaino or that `` nooscope '' ? 
  because the only way to accurately describe my reaction to it is [ this ] ( http://giphy.com/embed/nbgejftsero5q ) . 
   and the ultimate goal for them would be to eliminate the polish language , culture , and even religion  other countries like ukraine for example were not so lucky oh , that 's fucking rich coming from a pole . 
  is n't it also because some time ago \u0141 was hard l sound ? 
   writing polish in cyrillic requires adding some silly inventions like \u046b , \u0467 , \u046d or \u0469 , and some weird hybrids like \u0452 , \u0459 , \u0461 or \u045f .
