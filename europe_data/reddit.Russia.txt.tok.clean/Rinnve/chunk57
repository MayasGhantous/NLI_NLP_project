  so , just like with latin alphabet ? 
  except with cyrillic there are less clusters ( sz -  \u0448 , cz -  \u0447 etc. ), 
  oh , and those `` silly inventions '' are actually old cyrillic letters , from the times when other slavic languages also had nasal vowels . 
  acquired taste , i suppose . 
  i can read and partially understand examples in that article , but deciphering polish consonant clusters is hell for me , each word takes 10 + seconds . 
  [ actually , it would .

  maybe , but `` really worse '' ? 
   life for the average russian has gotten really worse during the last year did it ? 
  i must be living in parallel reality then . 
   we do not even know what crimeans want except there were several public polls after the referendum , all committed by respected western agencies , all showing the same result . 
  sarcasm or not , those angry memories have very little to do with that liberation campaign . 
   remember stakhanovism ? 
  it was a propaganda move aimed to counter exactly that sentiment . 
  it was n't only a propaganda move . 
  [ productive workers were well compensated .

   international observers were not permitted . 
  and by `` not permittted '' you mean `` decided not to observe '' . 
  you can write another wall of text , it wo n't change facts . 
   observers from the osce earlier tried to gain access into crimea but were denied . 
  `` after being repeatedly refused entry to crimea , unarmed osce military observers have been visiting other parts of ukraine including the country 's east . '' `` russia and crimea 's pro-russian parliament have both backed election monitors but the osce does not plan to send any , judging sunday 's referendum illegal . '' dude , do you even read what you link ? 
  osce military observers have nothing to do with observing referendums . 
  as for election monitoring , osce itself refused do to it despise being actually * welcome * , all according to the article you 've linked . 
  so it is completely incorrect to state that international election observers were not permitted to do what they do . 
  as for some international bodies deciding that this referendum was illegal , that 's completely different business .

   i somehow do n't remember `` us '' deliberately starving to death millions of people `` if food is so scarce , why has n't gandhi died yet ? '', 
  there is a world of difference between osce * refusing * to monitor the referendum by their own decision , and ( as you said ) osce * not being permitted * to do it , allegedly by russian or crimean authorities . 
   the un human rights council also did not monitor the referendum because they were not allowed to you 're at it again . 
  not independent . 
  the constitution of 1992 gave crimea a great deal of autonomy , but calling that `` independence '' would be an overstatement . 
   where no osce or international observers were permitted to monitor the referendum this is a lie . 
  why do you lie so much , huh ? 
   there was no option to remain part of ukraine . 
  the second option literally meant `` remain a part of ukraine '' . 
  why do you lie ? 
   only became anti-ukraine after russian citizens with guns how about you stop lying ? 
  there were pro-russian protests long before the violence . 
  `` in march -- july 1944 a senior leader of oun ( b ) in galicia conducted negotiations with sd and ss officials , resulting in a german decision to supply the upa with arms and ammunition . 
  in may of that year , the oun issued instructions to `` switch the struggle , which had been conducted against the germans , completely into a struggle against the soviets . '' . 
  [ 23 ] in a top secret memorandum , general-major brigadef\u00fchrer brenner wrote in mid-1944 to ss-obergruppenf\u00fchrer general hans prutzmann , the highest ranking german ss officer in ukraine , that `` the upa has halted all attacks on units of the german army . 
  the upa systematically sends agents , mainly young women , into enemy-occupied territory , and the results of the intelligence are communicated to department 1c of the [ german ] army group '' on the southern front . 
  [ 57 ] by the autumn of 1944 , the german press was full of praise for upa for their anti-bolshevik successes , referring to the upa fighters as `` ukrainian fighters for freedom '' [ 58 ] after the front had passed , by the end of 1944 the germans supplied oun/upa by air with arms and equipment . 
  there even existed , in the region of ivano-frankivsk , a small landing strip for german transport planes . 
  some german personnel trained to conduct terrorist and intelligence activities behind soviet lines , as well as some oun-b leaders , were also transported through this channel . '' [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_insurgent_army#germany ) wikipedia , man . 
  right there . 
   one of the most naturally wealthy countries on earth  with a population exceeding 100 million  does not even have real opposition to putin . 
  i do n't think that those statements are connected in any way . 
  besides , the last one is n't true , we do have opposition . 
   he has thrown his own country in a recession . 
  eh , i really really doubt that putin controls oil prices . 
  so , any state - * sponsored * tv channel is a `` blatant pro-government propaganda '' ? 
  ( oh , and ntv is n't state-run or state-sponsored . ), 
  yeah , and the fact that those journalists were also critical of other very powerful and far more dangerous people ( like , you know , oligarchs or chechen warlords ) is a simple coincidence . 
   in russia unfortunately people only really get blatant pro-government propaganda and you know that how , exactly ? 
   that 's because corruption is rampant to the point of it being silly in russia . 
  you 're trusting tv way too much . 
   cars have nothing to do with mass shootings . 
  cars , however , have everything to do with car accidents , often deadly . 
  actually , if you count how many people died in car accidents ( accounted for percentage of car owners ) and how many people were killed by legally owned guns ( also accounted for percentage of gun owners ) , it turns out that cars and not guns were created for injuring people . 
  legally owned guns are mainly used for injuring targets , bottles and other inanimate objects . 
   people say they can be used to `` protect you '' , but really how true is that . 
  very true . 
  there are tons of statistics that show clear correlation between legal gun ownership and concealed carry , and declining crime rate . 
  there are also zero statistics contradicting this correlation . 
  so yes , it seems that legally owned gun protect people much more often than kill innocents . 
  first , public transportation is both safer and more effective than private-owned cars . 
  clearly , if one 's truly worried about casualties and not just afraid of guns , the target is clear . 
  about comparing guns and cars , both has many important things in common . 
  both are dangerous and require a great deal of responsibility ( much more often lacking in car owners , considering the amount of car accidents , even after accounting for percentage of car owners vs gun owners ) . 
  both can cause death , both can do good in right hands in right time . 
  limiting or banning the use of either does limits human rights : the right of free movement and the right of self-defence . 
  yes , i can compare guns and cars . 
  but i can . 
  cars and guns both can and do cause death , both require a great deal of responsibility , both can do good , save lives even - when used correctly , in right hands and in right time . 
  your initial argument could be applied to both . 
  if you disagree , please specify why * exactly * it does n't . 
  `` those are different things '' does n't applies , because guns and cars do have important things in common , see above . 
  kids should n't touch guns unless under direct control of their parents . 
  adults though , that would be a good idea . 
  with reasonable amount of control , of course ( like not selling guns like hot-dogs , without registration or background check ) . 
  analogy . 
  google it . 
  it 's not that hard . 
   not sure what the car has to do with it `` good people can also have bad moments '' based on this argument , we should ban cars immediately . 
  a car is nearly as dangerous as a gun , you can easily kill quite a lot of people with it during your `` bad moment '' . 
  many people do , actually , not always intentionally , but also out of irresponsibility or just , you know , because it was a really bad day . 
  so what do you thing about banning cars ? 
  not outright banning , of course , only for regular people . 
  cars should only be used by carefully chosen and specially trained people . 
  just like with police and guns . 
  okay . 
  let me ask you a couple of questions . 
  1 ) do you consider yourself a good person ? 
  2 ) do you own a car ? 
   tell me , how many mass shootings does russia have compared to the us ?
