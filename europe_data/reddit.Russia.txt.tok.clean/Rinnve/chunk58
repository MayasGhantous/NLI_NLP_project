  a lot less , so ? 
  there are many european countries with much less restrictive gun policies than russia , and even * less * amounts of mass shootings . 
   when you have every citizen armed , you are n't going to magically reduce gun related deaths but rather increase it . 
  if you 're so worried about accidents , you should n't go after guns . 
  you should go after cars . 
  more people die in car accidents every day than were killed in mass shootings during last ten years or so . 
   shooting her teacher with a semi-automatic it was [ a fucking submachine gun ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/08/26/us/arizona-girl-fatal-shooting-accident/ ) , for starters , not a semi-automatic . 
  teaching a kid to shoot with * that * is like teaching a kid to drive a muscle car . 
  this tragic accident has nothing to do with guns , and everything to do with being irresponsible . 
  what 's more important , though , that isolated accidents do not matter . 
  for every ( legal ) gun-related death i can easily find an example of saving lives with a gun . 
  what does matter is [ statistics . 
  ] ( http://wp.gunfacts.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/20-years-of-change.jpg ), 
  bad guys will get their guns , one way or another . 
   `` you see in europe , a mass shooting . . that would have never happened if every citizen was armed , they 'd simply shoot down suspect . '', 
  [ well , about that ... ] ( https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oy_rlxtdzo8/v2ozhngbi6i/aaaaaaaahj8/vcv_b3gb-suqztqzdalnyg6wpf0h8n3wqclcb/s1600/courtesy-lgbt-for-gun-rights-facebook-page-675x900.jpg ), 
  of course it was a conquest . 
  those thousands of baltic people happily welcoming soviets were all targeted by conveniently invisible red army snipers . 
  / s man , you really should stop living in the white/black world . 
  real history is a little bit more complicated . 
  i 'm sorry , but not one bit in the thread you 've linked says that the accession of the baltics was * totally * voluntary and legit . 
  all it shows that there was a pretty significant demonstration of approval . 
  i 'm no expert in the baltics history , but as far as i know , it was n't indeed some kind of `` conquer '' , there were people there who supported ussr . 
  at least initially . 
  no , it 's just you being lazy and/or realizing that there are no concrete facts that could prove your words . 
  what, 
  please show me one , just one example of russian propaganda that could drive the public opinion about the baltic countries joining the ussr , or the m.-r . pact in general . 
  you 're referring to the results of public polls . 
  they are imprecise , and difference between 34 % and 27 % is not significant enough to indicate any trend . 
  the fact is , russian school program is historically correct . 
  they teach the kids all the facts , m.-r . secret protocols included . 
   so it is hard to believe that this is taught in schools . 
  [ here 's a page from a guide on preparing to the state exam ] ( http://down.ctege.info/ege/obshee/history/%d0%a11-%d0%a12-%d0%a13/history-11-c1-c2-c3-pakt_molotova-ribbentropa.pdf ) , discussing secret part of the molotov-ribbentrop pact . 
   they are using the same propaganda as in soviet times when soviet union only admitted to the public part and denied the existence of secret protocols . 
  except that 's wrong . 
  for instance , [ here 's a page from a guide on preparing to the state exam ] ( http://down.ctege.info/ege/obshee/history/%d0%a11-%d0%a12-%d0%a13/history-11-c1-c2-c3-pakt_molotova-ribbentropa.pdf ) . 
  all two of them ? 
  is it only one word with double meaning , or the whole letter could be interpreted either way ? 
  i 'm not debating that contemporary russia is very far from perfect . 
  what i 'm debating that statements like `` putin jails journalists '' or , in general , blaming putin for every crime that happens in russia is very wrong and counterproductive . 
  and not because i 'm some kind of putin 's fan , far from it . 
  you know what 's wrong with that `` putin does something bad '' position ? 
  it makes people think that after removing putin ( and his circle ) from power things automagically will become better . 
  this is as far from the truth as it gets . 
  the main problem is not putin , it 's the government system and the society in general . 
  late years of the ussr and the nineties corrupted many russian citizens , made them think that laws are not some guidelines to follow , but just annoying obstacles to overcome . 
  case in point : ukraine . 
  classic example of `` meet the new boss , same as the old boss '' , countrywide . 
   nikolai yarst as i understand from [ this ] ( http://www.kuban.kp.ru/daily/26087/2988769/ ) , it 's completely unrelated to sochi olympics , that 's why i failed to find him . 
  some shady business with corrupt policemen and missing kid . 
  ( kp is n't very reliable source , though . ), 
  more importantly , he never was jailed . 
  he was put under house arrest during investigation , and later [ found not guilty ] ( http://www.svoboda.org/content/article/25298527.html ) . 
  it 's kind of obvious , actually . 
  putin is far away , local authorities are right there ; and many wo n't hesitate much when dealing with some minor annoyance . 
  not that it would stop a serious journalist . 
   it 's not just in the nineties , it 's from 2000 and onwards . 
  methods did n't change much since the nineties , especially near caucasus . 
  notice that majority of journalists killed for their work were involved in that region , including politkovskaya . 
  chechnya was very problematic region , and still is . 
   journalist jailed for investigating on olympic games . 
  source ? 
  i have n't managed to find anything on it . 
   journalist jailed for having an anti-governement blog . 
  there are plenty of anti-government blogs , some authors are quite public too ( [ max kats ] ( http://maxkatz.livejournal.com/ ) , for instance ) . 
  it obviously is n't enough just to have an anti-govenment blog . 
  yes , being a journalist in russia is often a dangerous career . 
  it may have something to do with nineties being criminal chaos , and many armed conflicts in caucasus . 
  i do n't understand though how it 's related to `` putin jailing journalists '' . 
  yes , probably for pissing off local authorities . 
  not that it 's not bad , of course , but i do n't think it counts as  putin jailing journalists, 
   putin jailing journalists eh , what ? 
  when was last time journalist went to jail in russia ( for being journalist ) ? 
  but it is . 
  those taxes that go to moscow 's budget are for what moscow provides . 
  transportation tax , or tax on business property . 
  vat ( \u041d\u0414\u0421 ) goes straight to federal budget , it has nothing to do with the location of an hq . 
  profit tax also has nothing to do with it , each regional branch of a business pays it to the region in question , not to where hq is . 
  you 're mixing up two different things . 
  moscow hosting hqs of regional companies and thus collecting their taxes does not in any way prevents moscow from being one of the regions whose money are used to sustain other regions . 
  it 's that simple . 
  as for said hqs , it 's not like moscow somehow forced those companies to have their hqs there . 
  it 's not moscow 's fault that business is better to conduct in one of the largest european economic hubs . 
  this map is n't about that , it 's about what regions ' money are used to sustain other regions . 
  moscow is n't a `` parasite '' , it 's an economic hub ; and it does n't `` drain '' other regions , it sustains them . 
  sure , it would be nice to have a couple of big hqs in , say , tambov so my home region would get more taxes . 
  but it 's simply unreasonable . 
  technically , it 's just one enormously big [ tyumen oblast ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tyumen_oblast ) ( red stripes on the map designate two autonomous regions that are part of the oblast ) . 
  that too , but the main reasons are oil , gas and coal . 
  they are being mined there . 
  they have some material in arabic , spanish , russian , couple of other languages probably . 
  english is main though . 
  wrong . 
  [ look at this map .

  ( if you ca n't read russian , red regions are donating regions , blue regions are receiving . ), 
  no , rt is primarily aimed at the foreign audience . 
  eh , his viewpoint can be rationalized . 
  to some extent , with some amounts of mental gymnastics . 
  so pretty much as any other conspirology theory out here .
