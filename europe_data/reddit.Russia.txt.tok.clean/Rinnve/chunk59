  to answer your question , no , those people live in their own version of reality . 
  eh , bittorrent ? 
  your point being ? . . 
  the sources are everywhere . 
  estonian white book , for instance . 
  yet death rate amongst the deported was about 7 % . 
  that 's bad , but that 's not `` extermination level '' bad , nowhere near . 
  and why should russian army `` defend '' gagauz or bulgarians ? 
   every person who want 's to live in russia  journalists have organized the movement `` people 's rada of bessarabia . '', 
  it had as its objective the protection of interests of national minorities in odessa region bro , do you even read ? 
   gulag was certainly a death sentence . 
  first , no , it was n't ( it was quite close to it , but many people survived ) . 
  second , deported people were not sent to gulag . 
  third , nowhere near the 50 % of the baltics ' population was deported . 
  er , what now ? 
  we ( or rather , the soviets ) never exterminated that much . 
  ussr was formed by russian , belorussian and ukrainian soviet republics , if i remember it correctly . 
  those three nations agreed to dissolve it in the ninetees , too . 
  ( \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0436\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f , ca n't translate it right now on the mobile ) . 
   no i 'd rather we escalate our sanctions against russia , thanks very much . 
  too bad you do n't have any say in that matter . 
  you need more bold . 
  caps too . 
  on a more serious note , a britain guy accusing a russian of some crimes against humanity ? 
  that 's rich . 
  we did wrong upon chechnya . 
  we also amended that , to the extent it was possible . 
  move along , that 's none of your business . 
  worry about millions of indians who died because of your rule . 
  did you also watch how we poured billions of rubles there and rebuilt it completely , even better that it was ? 
  nobody 's perfect , you know . 
  no , i 'm dismissing it because it is simply not a source . 
  the claim is pulled out of thin air : `` in a country that lost more people defeating the nazis than any other country , there are now an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 neo-nazis , half of the world 's total . '' estimated by whom , and how exactly ? 
  there is no information on that , there is no link to the actual research , there is nothing . 
   they are also in russia , which is home to more than half the world 's neo-nazis . 
  ... as one lonely newspaper tells us , citing an unnamed `` research '' . 
  sure . 
   there was a vote of 96.77 % to join the russian federation . 
  dude , in a democratic system like voting , use common sense either falklands islands referendum was fixed too , or your argument about impossibility of such high percentage in `` a democratic system like voting '' is invalid . 
  you choose . 
   the referedum was illegal in the first place under what law , exactly ? 
  please cite . 
   the mayor of the crimean capital even said there were gangs going around stealing passports from people who voted for ukraine . 
  too bad no factual proof was provided . 
  literally `` he said , she said '' . 
  that 's not a very strong argument . 
  well , at least you 're not lying anymore about `` intimidation '' and `` international observers '' that `` were not allowed to enter '' , that 's a progress . 
  eh , google it up , dude . 
  as far as i can remember , there were some ( far ) right mps from some european countries , nothing major . 
  nobody wanted to ruin their reputation , something like that . 
  anyhow , the referendum was open to anybody who desired to observe it . 
  as for its recognition and related problems , it really says volumes about how western world treats democracy . 
  it 's not about what people want , it 's about what they are allowed to want . 
  point in case : earlier crimean referendums , where the mainland ukraine basically said `` u want more autonomy ? 
  fcuk you then '' . 
  somehow nobody cried about how ukraine forced its will onto crimea in the ninetees . 
  except we do n't . 
  current decline is nowhere near the crisis of 2008 , let alone the nineties . 
  here are some examples : * [ inflation rate ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=rucpiyoy&amp;v=201606141716n&amp;d1=19160101&amp;d2=20161231&amp;h=300&amp;w=600 ) * [ gdp per capita ppp ] ( http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=rusnygdppcapppcd&amp;v=201606141716n&amp;d1=19160101&amp;d2=20161231&amp;h=300&amp;w=600 ), 
   i 'm still in awe , how putin and his gangsters have so much support among russians . 
  that 's because you know jack shit about life in russia . 
  during putin 's rule , russians experienced massive economic growth , especially visible because it came right after the catastrophe which were the 90s . 
   what international observers were there ? 
  there was an absence of un and osce observers . 
  because they refused to go there , not because they were n't allowed to . 
   no serious country even recognizes the referedum . 
  so what ? 
  that 's their political stance , nothing more . 
   where there was widespread intimidation false . 
  contrary to what people say about `` russian soldiers observing the vote process '' or something like that , nobody managed to produce actual evidence of that . 
   no international observors were allowed in crimea during the voting false . 
  there were international observers ; probably not the kind you 'd like to see , but that 's your problem : no international observers were prohibited from , ah , observing . 
   do you really think russia would of let crimea rejoin ukraine after they put military troops there and already dissolved parliament ? 
  actually , i do . 
  both options were acceptable for russian government : old crimean constitution gave it enough autonomy to keep business with russia ( like , you know , allowing that military base ) even if mainland ukraine was against it . 
  on a side note :  would of how about not hiding behind other country 's flair ? 
  this kind of error is very typical for ( not very well educated ) native english speakers who first learn to talk and only then learn to write . 
   russia not russia . 
  that 's modern russia , ukraine , belarus and about ten other less influential countries combined . 
  a day after parts of russian empire are returned , i 'd guess . 
   some of us have n't forgotten the videos of armed russian soldiers watching on as the crimeans cast their easily visible giant-checkbox votes , depositing them in transparant boxes . 
  please provide * one * such video . 
   independent dagestan dagestan never wanted independence . 
   chechnya happened in 2003 . 
  you were probably too young to notice , though . 
   and in 1917 tsar russia actually signed finnish independence too bad you do n't even know your own history ( assuming the flair is true ) . 
   96.77 % , really ? 
  are you saying that [ falkland islands referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falkland_islands_sovereignty_referendum,_2013 ) was fixed too ? 
   restore crimea to the 1992 consitution powers , which both de facto mean crimea is an ` independent state ' wrong . 
  the second option explicitly stated that crimea remains `` a part of ukraine '' . 
  too bad your joke is 20 years old . 
  congrats on the successful thawing , though . 
  you first . 
  said who ? 
  eh no , you 're not . 
  you 're so close culturally that people from the states , for instance , see no difference at all . 
  the problem with your argument is that while / r/europe goes ape-shit crazy about relatively minor violations of the free speech in russia , people get actually killed for their sexual identification in some other countries , and it goes almost completely under the radar . 
  those `` some other countries '' , by the way , are kind of allies of your own country , directly or not ( hey , usa ! ) . 
  do n't you think that criticism should be pointed at what requires most immediate attention ? 
   it 's like saying that there exist a distinct way for russia ( i.e.
