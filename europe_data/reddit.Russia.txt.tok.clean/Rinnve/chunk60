  not be liberal democracy way ) . 
  did you just said that `` liberal democracy '' is the only true way ? 
   russian historiography and school textbooks continue to maintain that the baltic states voluntarily joined the soviet union i 'm sorry , but that 's simply a lie . 
  go get any modern state-approved russian history textbook : every one of them tells that the ussr presented an ultimatum to the baltic states and installed a puppet government . 
  that explains so much !, 
   privately they still held these macho ideas did they had those * ideas * , or did they act accordingly ? 
  the distinction is that some people who tell that they 'll `` kick the shit '' out of somebody who looked at their ~ ~ problem ~ ~ girlfriend mean just that , but some do n't really mean that they will immediately attack ; in reality , most people would just approach and ask what 's the matter . 
  of course , that 's also just anecdotal evidence  edit : freudian slip, 
  til that i 'm totally not russian , and neither are most of my friends . 
  seriously , this `` automatic beating '' reaction is a hallmark of the lower ( lowest ? ), 
  stooping to violence is n't classy , it 's that simple . 
  thanks !, 
  you 're not wrong , it is a low key holiday ; nevertheless , the event was important , historically : the ussr had no chance after it . 
  except it was [ a pretty important event ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/declaration_of_state_sovereignty_of_the_russian_soviet_federative_socialist_republic ) on this date . 
  from the video : `` since february 1940 to june 1941 , the soviet union conducted four mass deportation of about 1.5 million poles to siberia , shipping them mostly in winter time on the cattle trains with the frost outside down to -50 deg . 
  c. most of people got frozen to death on the way . '' from the wikipedia : `` in 1940 and the first half of 1941 , the soviets deported a total of more than 1,200,000 poles in four waves of mass deportations from the soviet-occupied polish territories . 
  the first major operation took place on february 10 , 1940 , with more than 220,000 people ** sent to northern european russia ** . 
  the second wave of 13 ** april ** 1940 , consisted of 320,000 people ** sent primarily to kazakhstan ** . 
  the third wave of ** june -- july ** 1940 totaled more than 240,000 . 
  the fourth and final wave occurred in ** june ** 1941 , deporting 300,000 . '' why people always feel the need to paint it worse than it was in reality ? 
  well , there is [ unity day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unity_day_ ( russia \\ ) ) , but hardly anybody knows about it . 
  yandex mail 's usability is way better than google mail 's . 
  also , support actually answers you and solves your problems asap ; google mail support just silently ignores you ( oh , they do solve problems , but they keep silent and do n't answer any questions ) . 
  mail is n't exactly better , but it 's comprehensive all in one solution , far broader than anything google can offer . 
   russians are way more patriotic than europeans , if there 's a russian alternative to western stuff , they typically use it , look at yandex , vk , mail.ru . 
  eh , it has nothing to do with patriotism , those services are just better ( well , at least for russian-speaking people ) . 
  how many of captured separatists turned out to be russian soldiers , probably `` on vacation '' or finished the service just before going to ukraine ? 
  two , three ? 
  yes . 
  do you ? 
   because they make you a danger to rest of the population . 
  start with banning cars then , they are much more common . 
   estonia . 
  lithuania . 
  finland 3 times in one week in 2014 . 
  were those too token `` violations '' for a few seconds in a hard to maneuver zone , as was the case with turkey ? 
  when and where was the last time they did it ? 
   forgive me for distrusting a news agency that tried to pass a poorly photoshopped ukranian fighter shooting down a completely different kind of jet , as proof of ukraine shooting down the malaysian airlines flight . 
  was it interfax , though ? 
   they are somewhat biased that 's pretty much [ the definition of propaganda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/propaganda ) . 
  how exactly putin caused the oil crisis ? 
  what amount did he `` stole '' , with some sources better than baseless accusations and quite ridiculous hearsay ? 
  western powers involve themselves in questionable ( at the best ) armed conflicts all the time ; actually , russia seems much more peaceful than the us . 
  the real critique could be that he 's pretty authoritarian and seem to become more so as the time passes . 
  authoritarian rule has its pluses , but it also has very serious vulnerabilities . 
  but alas , you 've missed that . 
  lack of international monetary assistance [ was listed by jeffrey sachs as one of main reasons of failure of `` shock therapy '' in russia compared to poland . 
  ] ( http://jeffsachs.org/2012/03/what-i-did-in-russia/ ), 
  explain yourself , please . 
  judging by what matters for ordinary man , putin is good enough . 
  why ? 
  archive documents that put the blame strictly on the nkvd , beria , merkulov and their cronies were unclassified and published in the early nineties . 
  official tass statement ( 14 april 1990 ) : `` at meetings between representatives of the soviet and polish leadership in the wider circles of the public for a long period of time raises the question of clarifying the circumstances of the death of polish officers , interned in september 1939 . 
  historians of the two countries had conducted a careful study of the katyn tragedy , including the search of documents . 
  most recently , the soviet archivists and historians discovered some documents on polish soldiers who had been held in kozelsk , starobelsk , and ostashkov camps , the nkvd of the ussr . 
  from them follows that in april -- may 1940 , of the approximately 15 thousand of polish officers interned in these three camps , 394 were transferred in the gryazovets camp . 
  the main part of `` placed at the disposal '' of the nkvd , respectively , at smolensk , voroshilovgrad , and kalinin regions and nowhere else in the statistical reports of the nkvd is not mentioned . 
  identified archival materials in their entirety lead to the conclusion that the direct responsibility for atrocities in the katyn forest beria , merkulov and their henchmen . 
  the soviet side , expressing its deep regret in connection with the katyn tragedy , declares that it is one of the serious crimes of stalinism . 
  copies of the documents handed over to the polish side . 
  the search of archival materials continues . '' ( yandex-translated ; [ source ] ( https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%d0%97%d0%b0%d1%8f%d0%b2%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b5_%d0%a2%d0%90%d0%a1%d0%a1_%d0%be%d1%82_14_%d0%b0%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%bb%d1%8f_1990_%d0%b3%d0%be%d0%b4%d0%b0 ) ), 
   russia has so much resources ... mostly in places extremely hard to reach , or at least very remote . 
  people forget this small detail all the time . 
   it 's just sad to see how russians do n't care who runs the government . 
  actually , from the ordinary man 's point of view ( quality of life , wealth , etc. 
  ) , putin 's rule ( at least from mid-zeroes to the start of the oil crisis ) was one of the best periods in russian history . 
   russia could have had the growth rate of poland are n't you forgetting something ? 
  `` the imf granted poland with a stabilization fund of us$ 1 billion and an additional stand-by credit of us$ 720 million . 
  following this the world bank granted poland additional credits for modernization of exports of polish goods and food products . 
  many governments followed and paid off some of the former communist debt ( about 50 % of the sum of debt capital and all cumulated interest rates to 2001 ) . '' ( [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balcerowicz_plan ) )  yet had the growth rates of ukraine under putin [ you 're wrong . 
  ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=67&amp;c=pl&amp;c=rs&amp;c=up&amp;l=en ), 
  it is n't ? 
  from the wikipedia : `` early calculations range from about 4.2 to 4.5 million in the final solution ( 1953 ) by gerald reitlinger ( arguing against higher russian estimates ) , [ 341 ] and 5.1 million from raul hilberg , to 5.95 million from jacob lestschinsky . 
  yisrael gutman and robert rozett in the encyclopedia of the holocaust estimate 5.59 -- 5.86 million . 
  [ 342 ] a study led by wolfgang benz of the technical university of berlin suggests 5.29 to 6.20 million . '' as we can see here , several other researchers give similar estimations . 
   well russians made up a ton of stuff about the nazis since the 1940 's and a lot of it 's considered the truth these days source ? 
  chinese cars are cheaper . 
  seriously speaking , it 's kind of both most probably . 
  local oil/gas guys here drive land cruisers and uaz patriots almost 50/50 , so it ca n't be * that * bad . 
  ( it 's not exactly russian though , the engine is some japanese diesel if i 'm not mistaken . ), 
   if the crimeans wanted to secede and there was a popular majority , why the war ? 
  crimea tried democratic process in the nineties . 
  turns out it 's kind of hard to secede ( or at least get proper autonomy ) without external support if the mainland is against that . 
  hardly anybody did it by choice . 
  [ stalin 's ussr was fun this way . 
  ] ( http://russianhistoryblog.org/2011/03/the-sharashka-phenomenon/ ), 
  pretty sure there is a little bit of difference between celebrating a war and a victory in said war . 
   well i have n't seen any say latvians saying how they sent the first man into space . 
  maybe that 's because that would be admitting they take part in something ussr did . 
   it does seem to be something just attributed to russia . 
  well , not the first misconception , surely not the last . 
   your officials still refer to the soviet occupation here as ` liberation ' eh , ` liberation ' they refer to was removing german forces from there . 
   do you really think many russians and the current government would agree to share the glory ? 
  share the glory ? 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  it is a common knowledge that ussr was n't russia alone and its achievments were n't russia 's alone . 
  some ex-ussr countries chose to distance themselves from ussr , they were `` occupied by russians '' , nothing good was created there and ussr was some evil empire . 
  well , that 's their choice . 
   there is not a single person person alive from those who carried out the murders even if somebody 's still alive , he would be about 100 years old now . 
  of course .
