  well , people somehow do it just fine , 20k is an average salary here . 
  that 's what i mean , basically , not that it 's a lot of money , but it 's no longer less than other occupations , as it used to be . 
  ( oh , and a decent 1 room apartment here can be had for about 10k / month . 
  it 's not moscow , you know . ), 
  [ definition of numerous ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/numerous ) : consisting of great numbers of units or individuals the correct word here would be `` four '' . 
  i do * what * again ? 
  that 's pretty hilarious . 
  are you aware that this page you 've linked tells the same thing ? 
  as a teacher , i have to make a couple of corrections : 1 ) it 's no longer low-paying . 
  well , comparatively at least ; of course it guys in big cities will make a lot more . 
  in my city ( and it 's a small city in tambov region , not exactly the wealthiest one ) teachers make about 22k rubles on average , and it 's on par with other jobs in the city . 
  there is also a serious shortage of teachers ; nobody in their right mind would fire a physics or a math teacher unless they want to have a school without one . 
  ( though i do n't think that life safety teachers do n't fall under that category . 
  pretty much anybody could teach that . ), 
  2 ) what 's more important , nobody tells teachers what to say . 
  nobody gathers them and tell : `` well , from this day you should tell kids that the west is bad , liberalism is bad '' , etc. 
  so this kind of mental problem demonstrated by the moscow times is most certainly self-inflicted . 
  ehm , i do n't think you make too much sense ... 
  good example on how to tell good journalism from bad . 
  `` it 's a trend in russian schools that keeps growing . '' what a good journalist should do right after such a claim ? 
  show the data that supports it . 
  not an anecdote . 
   are you aware that visa-free regime does n't give you right to work ? 
  considering the size of their shadow economy , i do n't think that respecting laws is a very common trait in ukraine . 
   it only takes a quick google to find numerous cases of teachers being fired for criticising the government please demonstrate those `` numerous '' cases . 
  after all , it 's just a quick google , certainly it would take only some seconds of your time to post here a search request . 
  could you please stop using vague words and get to the point already ? 
  it seems to me that you 're moving the goalposts . 
  do n't do that . 
  just to be the devil 's advocate , making protests happen is vastly easier than meddling ( or hacking ) an election in the most technologically and otherwise advanced state in the world .

  cut grass we do n't have , i give you that . 
  ( we kinda do , actually , on the main streets at least ; but somehow people who cut it make it only worse . ), 
  i do n't think i understand you . 
  are you sure we 're still talking about things like [ this ] ( https://www.yaplakal.com/forum2/topic1569707.html ) ? 
  in other words , houses crumbling away , non-existing roads , etc. , and not merely uncut trees and grass ? 
  of course there were zero distance between german and ussr * borders * , but who cares about that ? 
  the distance between the german forces and the heart of the ussr was increased , and that 's the only thing that matters . 
   there was no actual instance of cavalry attacking tanks , that 's a myth . 
  if you know that , then you also know that while this is a myth , polish army was indeed far weaker than german and did n't stood a chance . 
   there was no such thing as an ` inevitable war ' by august 1939 , what made it possible is the de facto alliance between germany and ussr . 
  what made it possible , actually , was the constant appeasement policy . 
  you 're building an army ? 
  here , take some money , and resources too !, 
  you want a piece of czechoslovakia ? 
  sure , why not !, 
  etc. , etc. , etc. 
  m.-r . pact was an icing on the cake . 
  it did n't come out of the blue . 
   also , if someone on the other side of a barrier state like poland acts aggressively and you 're afraid , you do n't remove the barrier between yourself and agression . 
  huh ? 
  two alternatives : a ) barrier state is competely occupied by the enemy , b ) barrier state is partly occupied by the enemy , and partly by you . 
  the choice is obvious . 
  occupation of poland increased the distance between the germans and the soviets . 
  dude , you 're telling stories about conditions in smalls russian towns to a person who himself is living in a small town . 
  and i do n't quite get your point about ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za . 
  how 's [ this ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za,+hungary/@47.9607637,21.7125381,3a,75y,112.81h,85.38t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1swps4apghozkehh2qesgmlw!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo2.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dwps4apghozkehh2qesgmlw%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d175.5%26pitch%3d-7%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x47389fe7b75757df:0x400c4290c1e11a0!8m2!3d47.9495324!4d21.7244053 ) is better than [ this ] ( https://www.google.ru/maps/@52.8963681,40.5047616,3a,75y,146.88h,86.67t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s-wb4fnkfk7l-lourzzo62w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=en ) ? 
  this conversation is a great example how somebody could twist and bend the facts to push their agenda . 
  no one knows , really ? 
  with the fucking cavalry against the tanks , and virtually non-existing airforce ? 
  without the anti-german alliance that uk and france failed to form , the ussr had only two choice : temporal agreement with germany and some additional territory to prepare against the inevitable war , or no agreement with germany and the german army on the ussr 's doorstep . 
  eh , at least in small business and at least in the region i live in ( tambov ) you do n't need any bribes anymore . 
  nobody cares for your little shop or cafe . 
  let 's not pretend that polish army had any chance agains the germans , ussr or no ussr . 
  plans to invade poland were in place long before the m.-r . pact was signed , and nothing would 've changed that . 
  except , you know , that possible anti-german alliance that uk and france failed to create . 
  russians are not real slavs , amirite ? 
  molotov-ribbentrop pact has * everything * to do with previous events . 
  and no , you can repeat it thousand times , but it does not change the historical facts : germany invaded poland and defeated its army without any help from the ussr . 
  do you think such conditions are normal in russia ? 
  they are not . 
  and i 'm fairly sure that with enough effort one could find similar desolate corners in every country . 
  why are you conviently forgetting all the stuff that other countries ( including poland ) did together with the nazis ? 
  not unless people stop pretending that crimean tatars were `` innocent natives '' of crimea and russia had conquered them for the sake of conquering . 
  dude , you 're preaching to the choir . 
  i come from the * oblast * were , long before the occupation of the baltic states , [ the soviets saturated forests with chemical weapons ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tambov_rebellion ) in order to kill thousands of peasants who rebelled against them . 
  i 'm not praising the ussr , far from it . 
  what i 'm standing against is the rewriting of the history . 
  no , the ussr was n't `` primarily responsible for starting the wwii '' . 
  either it was the nazis , or all the countries who appeased them and/or were dealing business with them . 
  anybody who tries to single out the ussr for dealing with the nazis is either ignorant or purposefully tries to rewrite history . 
  do n't know about you , but my brain works fast enough to require seconds to remember historical facts , not hours . 
  well , if one really wants to find shit , he will certainly succeed . 
  just do n't pretend that russia is somehow different in that matter to other countries . 
  not together . 
  soviets entered poland when polish army was defeated already or somewhere near that point ; iirc that was about two or three weeks after nazis attacked poland . 
  also , how is that related to the fact that uk and france preferred to bet on the ussr and nazis destroying each other rather than do that alliance thing with the soviets to contain nazis ? 
  i think you lost this : ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ), 
  honestly , after what their khanate did to russia , i could n't care less . 
  2 seconds of googling say that it might be [ slightly ] ( https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;q=\u0441\u0443\u0445\u0443\u043c+\u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e&amp;oq=\u0441\u0443\u0445\u0443\u043c+\u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e ) biased . 
  just a teeny little [ bit . 
  may i ask why would be the ussr `` one of the countries primarily responsible for bla bla bla '' , and not uk and france who refused to sign an anti-german alliance with the ussr when it was offered to them ? 
   it is not about russians who were moved to crimea to live in houses of crimean tatars . 
  found the ukraninan shill . 
  you can take the man out of the ussr , but you ca n't take the ussr out of the man . 
  if even half of this is true , it 's pretty terrifying . 
  the law not being broken by the law enforcers ? 
  k , if u say so, 
   this is russia 's top intelligence and cultural elite . 
  says who ?
