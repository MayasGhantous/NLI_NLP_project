  cost of healthcare * for a french citizen in a foreign country * . 
   who where in the same shithole in the 90s that russia was in they were n't . 
  for starters , all the external debt of the ussr fell on russia . 
  he is n't unknown today . 
  does n't mean that he has serious chance at winning presidency . 
  he does n't have any management experience worth mentioning , only crazies would vote for him ( at least i hope ) . 
   candidates with a serious shot like navalny you ca n't be serious . 
   going over the definition of fascism , every aspect matches the modern russia so close that it leaves no room for doubt well , that must be pretty hand-tailored definition of fascism , 'cause definitions i know about do n't match very well at all . 
  of course . 
  some people claim though that there is no relation at all besides the name that `` the duchy of moscovia '' just `` took '' . 
  like [ this ] ( http://euromaidanpress.com/2014/05/14/how-moscow-hijacked-the-history-of-kyivan-rus/ ) . 
  well , i agree that it 's incorrect to call that region `` russia '' ; it 's kievan rus . 
  what i do not agree is this common theme among some people that modern russia or it 's predecessor the duchy of moscovia is n't related to kievan rus . 
   there was a loose association of rus states , with largest center in kiev , but it 's not related to russia really except that rurik dinasty thing . 
  and the language . 
  and the history . 
  totally not related at all . 
  ukrainians were n't special here too . 
  russification policies were the same all across the ussr . 
  again , the ukrainian bias . 
  soviet union was oppressing all kinds of people of all kinds of ethnicities . 
  about 5 million russians died of hunger in the povolzhye famine in the 1920s , does that prove that s.u. 
  was systematically oppressing the russians too ? 
  oh , and just like with holodomor , s.u. 
  did n't `` single out '' ukrainians in the 1946 famine ; people died of hunger in moldova and central russia too . 
  so much for `` systematically oppressing the ukrainians '' . 
  look up `` the years of hunger '' by davies and wheatcroft . 
  it 's the most recent research on the subject , done after russian government opened access to classified soviet archives . 
  aaand we should use this definition of holodomor because ... ? 
  maybe because almost every resource on holodomor does n't even mention what happened in other parts of the ussr , thus focusing all attention on ukraine and introducing a massive bias ? 
  well , i refuse to talk about * ukrainian * holodomor . 
  it 's simply unfair to all other victims of that crime . 
  also , i like how you completely ignored the wrong timeline of yours . 
  what makes you think that i 'm talking about soviet research ? 
  because i do n't . 
  [ you can start here . 
  ] ( http://www.refworld.org/docid/469f38ec2.html ), 
  riiiight . 
  and to hell with all those history research that tell otherwise . 
  it was a crime against humanity , why assign inappropriate names to it ? 
  holodomor did n't happen in ukraine alone . 
  in fact , large regions of russia and khazakhstan were affected just as much , if not more . 
  so no , it is incorrect to say that * ukrainian * farmers were targeted , because they were not . 
  oh , and there 's no need to wave your ignorance around , it looks really bad . 
   kulaks , who were ukrainian independent farmers  the hardest year was 1946 uhm , i do n't think you have a slightest idea what the holodomor was . 
  or who kulaks were , for that matter . 
  hint : it 's 30s , not 40s ; and `` kulak '' was a * russian * word for rich farmer . 
   300  gorillu that feeling when you do n't understand a word , yet do understand the whole text . 
  i was talking about time _ after _ that . 
  there were no revolution that brought changes from yeltsin 's nineties to putin 's zeroes/tens , but the changes are here . 
  first , russia makes decent enough meat , dairy , and other products . 
  second , not all imports are banned , and third , there are countries outside eu . 
  dude , are you sure you read me correctly ? 
  i mean after that , from yeltsin to putin . 
  last time i checked , there was no any revolution during the nineties or the zeroes . 
  yet the changes are immense . 
  some for good , some for bad , but still . 
  [ is it , though ?

  huh , did n't even notice this . 
  til , thanks . 
  over 60 % if you do n't account for the frequency of the words . 
  as far as i know , many everyday english words are germanic . 
  lexical distance has nothing to do with pronunciation , it 's about how similar are words and written texts . 
  this is anecdotal evidence , of course , but i really find bulgarian text somewhat easier to understand than belorussian or ukrainian . 
  i 've used google translate , since real wiki pages are somewhat different ; still , from what i gather , at least the words are more or less correct . 
  all bulgarian words are at least somewhat similar to russian ones , but what '' \u0432\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u045e\u0446\u0430 '' or '' \u0432\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0446\u044f '' could mean ? 
  as far as pronunciation and grammar go , ukrainian and belorussian are of course much closer to russian than bulgarian is . 
  ( disclamer : i do n't really know bulgarian , ukrainian or belorussian ; i only use google translate and some basic logic . ), 
  this is great news . 
  i expect this to be the only comment here . 
  i 'm sorry , but you 're doing it wrong . 
  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/crime 1 : an illegal act for which someone can be punished by the government ; especially : a gross violation of law domestic violence is still illegal in russia and is still punished by the government . 
  the fact that in english legalese `` crime '' usually means `` criminal crime '' does n't change anything about the basic meaning of the word . 
  it must be hard to be you , so drunk on propaganda . 
  the reality is that it 's still illegal , just the first occurance ( without any harm to health beyond bruises ) falls under the administrative codex and not criminal one . 
  in your wet dreams . 
  wrong . 
  i thiiiink not exactly that . 
  more likely reason is that ussr-made consumer goods were mostly shit , and everyone knew that if you want a good radio/tv/shoes / whatever , you got ta go for anything but ussr-made . 
  at least something east european , better yet west european , us or japanese . 
  many modern russian-made goods are actually much better than they used to be , if not on par with foreign stuff , but people still often consider them as shit . 
   russia imported their own people into a relatively recent land grab say what again ? 
  if you 're talking about imperial times , that was n't a land grab ; russia had had enough of [ tatar slave raids ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean\u2013nogai_raids_into_east_slavic_lands ) . 
  hundreds of thousands of people were lost to these . 
  the whole point of mad is that no country can obliterate other country without being obliterated itself . 
  this is the only reason the cold war did n't end with nuclear war , and the only alternative to mad is complete worldwide disposal of nuclear weapons , which is n't going to happen any time soon . 
  from what i know , current state of anti-missile shields does not yet undermine the `` a '' in mad , at least when we 're speaking about us or russia ( thousands of missiles ) . 
  `` yet '' being the key word . 
  no shit our mod is nervous . 
  mad , ever heard of it ? 
  russia is n't limited to moscow . 
  since when it increases capability of others to threaten russia . 
  dude , do you even know what mad is ? 
  your sarcasm is poorly placed , since anti-missile shield could undermine mad balance . 
   usually you can tell who is the owner of the media company . 
  in russia they all are controlled by the goverment . 
  faulty logic right there . 
  bbc is 100 % owned by british government , yet nobody speaks of it as if it were `` controlled by the govenment '' . 
  rbc is owned by prokhorov , how exactly is it controlled by the government ?
