  how exactly ? 
   join the eu and because of it get richer and less corrupt . 
  it 's other way around , though . 
  there is no way eu allows to join a country so poor and corrupt , so they 've got to fix it first . 
  [ definition of majority ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/majority ) 3 a : a number or percentage equaling more than half of a total < a majority of voters  < a two-thirds majority  c : the greater quantity or share < the majority of the time  disregarding that , though , what makes you think that only ethnic russians would want to make crimea a part of russia , as opposed to continue to be a part of failing state running on immense corruption and unhealthy nationalism ? 
  1897 : russians 33 % , tatars 35 % . 
  not a majority , agree , i remembered it wrong . 
  1926 : russians 42 % , tatars 25 % . 
  majority by quite a bit . 
  obviously it happened before that point , so well , not since late 19 century . 
  since early 20 century . 
  the hell i know . 
  how it feels to be a shill though , that one i 'm pretty sure you can answer yourself . 
  where you 've got this idea ? 
  the only people deported by stalin ( not russians , thank you so much ) were crimean tatars , and they were a minority at least since late 19 century . 
  russians have been a majority in crimea at least since late 19 century . 
  that 's a bit more than `` some decades only '' . 
   also the immediate celebrations from separatists in social networks should not be forgotten . 
  from separatist * groupies * , or people imitating them . 
  none of actual separatist leaders had any presense in the social networks , if memory serves me ( certainly not strelkov , he specifically said it several times long before the mh17 ) . 
   misinformation i do n't think you understand the meaning of this word . 
  i ca n't believe i 'm upvoting you , but that 's what i 'm doing right now . 
  / r/ukraina in a nutshell , well done . 
  it must be very nice to be you , never making any mistake . 
  sending people to prison because of an accidential bruise is very far from being tough on crime . 
  violent husband waiting for a year for the reprisal , * and * planning it so carefully that there would n't be even light harm to the health ... that 's a bit unrealistic , is n't it ? 
  would you also be delighted to go to prison for a couple of years ( and also to ruin your career because , you know , criminal record ) if you somehow manage to hit your kid accidentially and leave a bruise ? 
  it 's almost impossible to prove that it 's accidential in such cases . 
   i wonder why they do n't contact police ? 
  probably because law changes like this one tell them that a once a year beating is perfectly fine and acceptable . 
  so , they did not contact police in the past because of this recent law . 
  you know , current events could n't affect past . 
   which is likely to piss them off and take it out on the victim ... which knows that for the 2nd offence it 's 2 years of ~ ~ jail ~ ~ prison . 
  i 'm not sure i follow your logic . 
  edit : a word . 
  have you ever spent two weeks in jail ? 
  [ ** offence ** ] ( https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/offence?q=offence ) noun [ countable ] offence ( against somebody/something ) an illegal act, 
   its about whether physical assault in a family unit once a year is ok or not . 
  do you even read ? 
  something being administrative offence and not criminal does not makes it ok , at all . 
  it 's still an offence , and it 's still punished . 
   is a bloody nose a medical consequence ? 
  is a bruise a medical consequence ? 
  is psychological harm caused by abuse a medical consequence ? 
  that depends ( probably no ) ; no ; and no . 
  ( it 's defined [ here . 
  russian legal system is split in two parts : administrative and criminal . 
  domestic violence ( without medical consequences , and only 1 time per 365 days ) is now an administrative offence . 
  subtle . 
  read or watch some documentaries about moon missions . 
  it 's actually a mind-blowing achievment . 
  moon is much farther away that it could seem . 
  sending people there , returning them in good health , and repeating that for several times was indeed a tremendous deed . 
  science is n't always about what 's useful , it 's about what we can do . 
  that 's a reference to the recent putin speech in which he used the phrase `` women with lowered social responsibility '' as an euphemism for `` prostitutes '' . 
  it would be third year in a row i ask people to actually show this `` voting under guns '' . 
  namely , an armed soldier in the vicinity of the voting stations . 
  to this day , nobody managed to find any such photos . 
  there are reasons to call this referendum illegitimate , but `` voting under guns '' is n't one of them . 
  and you sound like either a paid shill or a complete nutjob . 
  pick your poison . 
   any more questions ? 
  yes , one . 
  how much are you paid for spreading this bullshit ? 
  they did n't attack us , though . 
  at least at first . 
  continuation war went ... not good ( for finland ) . 
   muscovy was political successor of golden horde  russian ethnos is incredibly complex and slavs are really small part of it come again ? 
  in this example it 's a last name . 
  anastasia is a very common female name in russia ( probably in other eastern european countries too ) . 
  it sounds like ... uhm ... `` mister john maria '' , something like that . 
  awkward and funny . 
  this makes it even worse , if anything . 
   they deserved it , it was legal !, 
  since when deliberate bombing civilian structures is legal ? 
   russophobe is a term created by the kremlin . 
  i thought so too . 
  then i discovered reddit and / r/europe . 
  just so there is n't a misunderstanding here , it was said in this thread , but i will repeat : it * is * still illegal to give a black eye to your wife . 
  only now you wo n't go to jail asap , but ( if it happens no more than once in a year ) you would pay a fine , or do some community service , something like that . 
  in russia , there is a very big difference between administrative and criminal code ; if you were convicted under the latter ( even for something minor ) , you 're in trouble . 
  you have a criminal record , many employers wo n't even talk to you , many regular people wo n't differentiate between a murderer , a professional thief , and a man who gave his wife a black eye and went to jail for that . 
  `` he was in jail , he 's a bad criminal , stay away from him '' , that would be a pretty common reaction . 
  two main camps , basically . 
  people who ca n't read ( `` now it 's legal to beat up your wife , yay ! '' ), 
  and those who can ( `` now you wo n't go to jail for a black eye '' ) . 
   russians have been imported know what ? 
  fuck you . 
  russians are not some goods to be imported . 
   really ? 
  ` zcz ' ? 
  it 's not ` zcz ' , though . 
  polish was super-intimidating for me too until i learned that `` z '' in `` sz '' / `` cz '' actually has nothing to do with pronunciation . 
  `` sz '' means enslish `` sh '' , `` cz '' means english `` ch '' ( approximately ) . 
   there are many `` if `` s which let to treat the same injure in various ways there are no any `` ifs '' which could make it possible to treat the * same * injure in significantly various ways . 
   the guy in russia was sentenced to 2.5 years for throwing a lemon in fully equipped policeman - was it a severe injure ? 
  irrelevant . 
  criminal article 318 ( attacking representatives of the public authorities ) is rather harsh even there were no injuries to the health . 
  this is not related to the fact that stalin 's deportations are not the reason `` why there are ethic russians living there in the first place '' . 
   such a controversial topic it is n't a controversial topic , though .
