  i read those rules . 
  you , on the other hand , only `` read '' them , finding there what you expected to find and only that . 
  * [ here are those medical criteria . 
  ] ( https://rg.ru/2008/09/05/medicina-dok.html ) extensive enough ? 
   it is also a question what to consider as a severe impact on the health ... no , it is n't . 
  oh , and even light harm to the health makes battery criminal . 
   that 's why there are ethic russians living there in the first place . 
  crimean tatars were a minority there since before xx century . 
  yep , modern lsf program is more practical than it used to be . 
  there is not only sex ed , but also basics of first aid , fire and electricity safety - you know , stuff one 's actually could encounter in real life . 
  that said , more that half of the program is still pre-army training . 
  https://yadi.sk/i/pscf-x7xtf65d , part 4 . 
   doing some form of sex ed in schools there is some form of sex ed in schools in russia , though . 
  it 's a part of the `` life safety basics '' course ( \u041e\u0411\u0416 ) . 
  judging by the color of the sky , it 's close to sunset . 
  in this case , there could be too little light to properly illuminate the forest . 
  clear snow , on the other hand , is highly reflective , so it keeps being relatively bright . 
  oh , and automatic cameras ca n't handle large masses of white , so some manual correction was certainly done , as it should be in any situation where there are large masses of white or black . 
  without correction , it would turn into a grey mess ( this is the main reason why winter photos often look much bleaker than the real thing ) . 
  well , if you 're somewhat interested in that part of the history , you should start studying it from scratch since you obviously do n't know even the basics . 
  if you 're not interested ... well , it 's okay i think , it 's impossible to learn everything ; just mark for yourself that you do n't know history of russia at all . 
  more like missing the entire history of that region . 
  geographically , asia starts after the ural mountains , which divide russia roughly in half . 
  culturally , even asian parts of russia are largerly european . 
  i have much more important things to keep in my head than some silly social advertising pictures . 
  yeah ... think so . 
  i quit three months ago , so i do n't quite remember . 
  have never seen it in russia . 
  the warning about impotence is common , but it uses a more subtle picture ( at least were i live , tambov oblast ) . 
  no , it does not . 
  do you know how to tell if it 's propaganda you 're reading ? 
  too much words , too few links to actual facts . 
  this article makes many claims , it 's really descriptive , believable . 
  yet if you try critical approach , if you take every claim and ask `` name one reason to believe that '' , well ... it just does n't hold up . 
  there is explaining , and then there is explaining . 
  it certainly could be a propaganda . 
  yeah , it 's much more efficient . 
  even older generations in poland can barely speak russian . 
  do n't know about other eastern bloc countries , but i think it 's about the same there . 
  the only logical fallacy here is in your comment . 
  namely , a false analogy . 
  a vaccine to propaganda would be proper education and critical thinking . 
  counter propaganda is still propaganda , which is a way to make people think what you want them to think . 
  manipulating is manipulating . 
  no , there were not any offices in russia devoted to spreading anything in english , related to the us election or not . 
  source : the same as yours , thin air . 
  on a more serious note , anybody claiming something about `` russian troll farms '' operating in english ( as opposed to russian ) should get themselves accustomed with the sorry state of teaching english in russia . 
  not so subtle hint : any russian that knows english on b2 + can make * tons * more as a couch or a translator rather than a sorry drone on a troll farm . 
  it 's actually ukraine which is n't following minsk ii . 
   you are not retarded you pass some psychotests i think you wo n't be allowed to own a gun in czechia . 
  wait wait wait . 
  was n't it `` a farce under the barrel of a gun '' ? 
  says who , a brigade of trolls ? 
  bugger off . 
  whataboutism at its finest . 
   where is the `` false '' part of the story ? 
  making mountains out of the molehills . 
  fear-mongering . 
  ever heard of this ? 
  one laptop was infected by some malware with unspecified capabilities and with unknown owners ( but allegedly `` russian-made '' ) , and out of this they make accusations like `` vladimir putin has been attempting to hack our electric grid '' or `` this is now about trying to access utilities to potentially manipulate the grid and shut it down in the middle of winter '' . 
  let me offer this analogy . 
  how would you react if some major new source repoted that `` the entire computer network of the ministry of defence of the us was compromised by the russians '' , when in reality some script kiddie defaced mod 's web site and put some smug putin photo on it ( hence `` by the russians '' ) ? 
  oh , and about this :  nor does the post article say the grid itself was attacked they changed the headline after it was made obvious that they are inventing fake news . 
  let me cite op 's article since you obviously have n't read it completely : `` as the actual truth emerged once the utility company issued its statement , the post rushed to fix its embarrassment , beginning by dramatically changing its headline '' . 
  yeah , that must be the reason why most pows in that conflict are ukrainians . 
  well , they should be . 
  imo half truths are actually more dangerous , since 100 % fake news are easier to debunk . 
   there are proper newspapers left in europe and the us name one . 
  no , seriously . 
  i want to know who to trust . 
  wow . 
  just ... wow . 
  i never expected the guardian to fall this low . 
  how 's that related to modern russia ? 
  still , a very badass trick . 
  if the performer was n't tied to the cars , he could slip and fall badly , in a dangerous proximity of the enormous wheels . 
  if he was tied , well ... 
  i do n't even want to imagine what could possibly go wrong . 
  heavy trucks are harder to control , i guess . 
  the original ad by van damme was done with advanced volvo trucks which are basically ai-controlled , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  i 've see several problems in your work . 
  first one , consider this passage : `` decree was passed on from stalin and molotov to ogpu on the 22nd of january 1933 , to stop ukrainian peasants from fleeing ukraine and ethnic ukrainians in kuban in search of food '' . 
  i have n't managed to find the original text of this decree . 
  note the lack of the word `` ukrainian '' . 
  russian peasants that lived in those regions were affected by the movement control just the same . 
  `` the years of hunger '' ( davies , wheatcroft ) also does n't have a word on any kind of movement control implemented for specific ethnicities . 
  second one , considering the `` blackboards '' . 
  you failed to mention several things about them . 
  1 ) this method of oppression was n't in fact introduced during holodomor ; 2 ) it was an initiative of ukrainian government , not some directive from stalin . 
  ( ( source ) [ http://www.istpravda.com.ua/research/2010/11/27/6591/#sdendnote12sym] ) finally , this typical obsession with ukraine , to the extent of calling kuban `` an ukrainian region of russia '' . 
  yes , about half of the population there was ukrainian . 
  other half was russian , though , and they suffered just the same . 
  no mention of what happened in kazakhstan . 
  why ? 
  probably because the idea of `` ukrainian genocide '' was promoted , but the idea of `` kazakh genocide '' was not ( actually , it was , but it is far less known ) . 
   if you are interested in reading on the subject , this is great book https://www.amazon.com/holodomor-reader-sourcebook-1932-1933-ukraine/dp/1894865286  by bohdan klid ( editor ) , alexander j. motyl ( editor ) oh yeah , there is no reason to think that book on holodomor written by ukrainians could possibly be biased . 
  no reason at all . 
  in turn , i can only recommend [ this book ] ( https://www.amazon.com/years-hunger-agriculture-1931-1933-industrialisation/dp/0230238556/ ) , already mentioned earlier . 
  it is an extensive analysis of the event that does n't try to push any agenda . 
  well , try me .
