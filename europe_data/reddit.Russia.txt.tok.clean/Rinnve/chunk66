  though , even without reading it i can say that `` policies applied to kuban '' is very different from `` policies following ethnic ukrainians '' . 
  kuban was n't primarily ukrainian-populated region , and any policies that could target that region would also target all russians living there . 
   russians were n't deliberately targeted and starved to death . 
  ukrainians on the other hand were . 
  ukrainians were n't `` targeted '' and `` starved to death '' any more than russians or kazakhs . 
  there were no `` unique policies '' that would target ethnic ukrainians and set them apart from their neighbours of other ethnicities . 
  sure . 
  it means `` here lives half of russia 's population . '', 
  no , they were not . 
  the second option would 've kept crimea in ukraine . 
  it 's kinda explained in the title : `` russia split in half by population '' . 
  two colors , two areas with equal population . 
   people wouldve been on south ossetia 's side people would n't care at all . 
  just like they did in the '90s . 
  did you even read this article ? 
  it 's has exactly nothing on `` intentional starvation '' . 
  it is not about `` intent '' , it is not about what caused the famine , it merely analyzes the demographics of the deceased . 
  by the way , `` the years of hunger '' was reviewed in [ the english historical review ] ( http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org/content/120/487/798.extract ) . 
  you first . 
   have a look at bloodlands by timothy snyder that 's not `` historical research '' , that 's entertainment . 
  too few facts and analysis , too much manipulation . 
  for instance , you 're obviously unaware that communists tried to handle the situation . 
  yes , you read that right , there was food and grain sent to starving regions after the central government realized what is happening . 
  holodomor was more complex event than `` soviets took the food '' . 
   better yet do your own research and find some real academics . 
  thing is , i did . 
  do yourself a favor , read [ real historians ] ( https://www.amazon.com/years-hunger-agriculture-1931-1933-industrialization/dp/0333311078 ) too , not that clown snyder . 
   they were targeting a group of one specific nation . 
  if you 're speaking about holodomor , that 's simply not true . 
  do you have troubles with comprehending written text ? 
  there was no `` having to do the dying when the state decided to make it so '' . 
  there is no modern historical research confirms that there was any kind of `` intentional starvation '' . 
   there a region was intentionally starved for no other reason than that the political system thought it desirable . 
  they knew this would happen , they did it anyway . 
  this is wrong for several reasons . 
  first , ukraine was n't the only region affected by this famine . 
  second , there is no modern historical research confirms that there was any kind of `` intentional starvation '' . 
  ( modern , as in done after soviet archives were made public . 
  research done before that point is based on speculations and hearsay . ), 
  the word `` genocide '' literally means `` killing a nation '' . 
  it does n't mean `` killing a whole lot of people '' , it means killing people because of their ethnicity . 
  that 's why even `` small '' mass murders ( `` just '' thousands of people ) could be genocides , and why some `` large '' mass murders are not genocides . 
  to reiterate , it 's not about scale , it 's about intent to eradicate an ethnicity . 
   russians value speak for yourself , mate . 
   holodomor targeted `` kulaks '' holodomor targeted nobody . 
  there are zero facts that would point that holodomor was `` targeted '' in any way . 
   could have been done multilateraly with 3rd party observers . 
  no , it could not . 
  it 's against the laws of ukraine , and nobody would interfere since it 's `` internal business '' . 
  just like in 1994 . 
  [ educate yourself . 
  i do n't need to look up something i experienced firsthand . 
   in which case it should be handed back to the ... crimean tartars ? 
  crimean tatars have nothing to do with the scythians , which were gone long before tatars conquered crimea ( like , half a millenium before ) . 
   the quality of life in 1989 was comparable to south korea you misspelled `` north '' . 
  russian government resettling program existed long before those leaflets appeared ( if that really happened ) . 
  what makes you think that there are no ethnic lithuanians capable of googling it up and making up fake `` propaganda '' leaflet ? 
  [ yes . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/soutikbiswas/2010/10/how_churchill_starved_india.html ), 
   osce military observers  * military * dude , do you even read ? 
   democracy is rule by the people . 
  who is `` the people '' , if not the majority of the population ? 
   our civilization is based on some common grounds , like : do not kill you ca n't be serious . 
  in the foundation of the european civilisation lie millions upon millions . 
   nobody is quite sure of the numbers to be honest . 
   russians do pay an enormous number of people pick one . 
  how enormous , exactly ? 
  since you know it 's an `` enormous number '' , please clarify it . 
  is it thousands , hundreds of thousands , millions ? 
  donbass and crimea are n't some tiny regions , and as far as i can remember , they did n't supported the maidan . 
  so no , not `` most of ukraine '' either . 
  how is that related to the fact that mob in kiev removing democratically elected president is not ukraine deciding anything ? 
  except in the case of nato bases on the country 's own territory are also nato bases , and in the case of nato-russia conflict they will be used too . 
   ukraine decided eh , mob in kiev = / = all of ukraine . 
  why , exactly ? 
   russians occupied and annexed crimea  so called dnr proclaimed itself . 
   girkin already started his operation in slavyansk none of this is `` war '' . 
  bombing cities with aviation and mrlses is war . 
  girkin 's operation was basically a mirror of what happened in kiev . 
  if you 're willing to call this a war , then war started way earlier , when extremists stormed government buildings just a day after the agreement was signed between yanuk and `` sensible '' opposition . 
  oh , and what about `` russian citizens on the buses '' , huh ? 
  do you deny people of donbass the right to disagree with what happened on maidan ? 
  do you follow the infamous maidanite logic that anybody who disagrees with them is paid putin shill ? 
   brought russian citizens on the buses lolwat . 
   not local ukrainians who started the war on the east yes , the so-called `` ato '' was started by the new government . 
  first usage of the heavy weaponry was also by the ukrainian army . 
  this `` no local russians '' bullshit does n't hold against the facts : the absolute majority of pows in this conflict were ukrainian citizens . 
  welcome to the adult life . 
  time goes faster and faster with every day , month and year spent living . 
  shitty feeling , to be honest , but such is life . 
  no , he was n't . 
  as far as i remember , there was a great deal of intimidation work and outright violence that , ah , prepped the society to `` elect '' hitler . 
   they can not attack anyone [ you ca n't be serious . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_yugoslavia ), 
  by 1943 soviets stopped germans and started to push back . 
  germans were n't seriously engaged `` elsewhere '' before the second front , not to the point it would significantly change the situation on the eastern front . 
  losses were far worse in the beginning of the gpw when the red army was poorly equipped and yes , many experienced officers were purged . 
  the situation improved because of reequipment ( yes , partly thanks to lend-lease , but only partly ) and experience gained by soviets , not because germans were significantly involved `` elsewhere '' . 
  i 'm sorry , but your knowledge about wwii is severely lacking . 
  for starters , germany was n't really engaged `` everywhere at once '' until the second front opened in 1943 .
