  russia/germany military losses are about 1.5 to 1 . 
  civilian deaths , that 's another matter , but i do n't think stalin is to blame here . 
  germans were extremely brutal on the eastern front . 
  those sayings tend to gloss over a lot of things . 
  and i mean a * lot * . 
  that 's because it 's a bunch of lies . 
  yes , it 's that simple . 
  since when keeping comfortable silence is `` anti-social '' ? 
  lemkin died in 1959 , he could not possibly have the information modern historians do . 
  so , [ back at you ] ( https://www.amazon.com/years-hunger-agriculture-1931-1933-industrialization/dp/0333311078 ) . 
  you could possibly say that if nazis killed a significant part of germans for being `` jewish spies '' * and * if the majority of jews were left alone . 
  about 16 % of poles in the ussr were affected ( killed or imprisoned ) , that leaves us with 84 % of poles in the ussr who were left alone . 
  maybe `` a paranoia '' is a wrong word here , but `` a genocide '' is a wrong word too . 
  no , they were not killing for being poles , they were killed under a tiniest suspicion for being `` polish spies '' . 
  thousands of other people ( russians , belorussians etc. ), 
  were killed during that operation for the same reason . 
  it was a paranoia of epic proportions , not a genocide ( not that it makes it better somehow , but i dislike misuse of words ) . 
   they wanted to kill all poles living in the soviet union yeah , that 's why it affected only 16 % of the polish population of the ussr , * and * that 's why not only poles , but almost all other people got affected too ( among them about 5000 russians ) . 
  hell , if they really wanted to kill all poles , i 'd probably woud n't exist , since my grand-granddad was one . 
  he was n't affected at all , not even arrested . 
  ( his brother , though , was arrested and convicted of being a polish spy . 
  probably shot or perished in gulag , but we do n't know , there is no mention of him in any archives we had access to . ), 
  getting to the point , ever heard of it ? 
  holodomor was n't targeted - at ukrainians or anybody else . 
  most modern historians do n't consider it a genocide . 
  calling it `` a ukrainian genocide '' is a disgrace to millions of russians and kazakhs who starved to death too . 
  talking in riddles does n't make you sound smart , believe me . 
  i do n't think i understand you . 
  yeah , because if you ask the actual population , [ the answers could be a little bit inconvenient ] ( https://www.bbg.gov/wp-content/media/2014/06/ukraine-slide-deck.pdf ) . 
   subterfuge like `` it 's an independent minority asking for independence '' how would you know that it is a subterfuge and not an actual minority asking for independence ? 
   finland has dairy companies that could easily set up and run factories in russia if that were possible . 
  valio did exactly this , and is doing just fine as far as i know . 
  so a report by the group assembled by the council of european union vs a wikipedia page ? 
  because the report clearly states that there was violence between south ossetians , georgian and abkhazians all way through 2008 ( and does n't state who started that ) , so clearly the attacks on august 1st could n't be `` the first act of violence '' . 
  oh , and the downvote button is n't the `` i disagree '' button . 
  anecdotes are much better for propaganda . 
  if you must choose just one city , then definitely st. petersburg . 
  otherwise st. petersburg , moscow , [ the golden ring ] ( http://rusmania.com/golden-ring.php ) . 
  let me quote you yet again . 
    no , russia has not officially annexed abkhazia . 
  abkhazia is not officially part of the russian federation . 
   you 're debating semantics . 
   russia invaded a foreign country , after russian separatists started a conflict there abkhazia . 
  abkhazia , not south ossetia . 
   pro-moscow separatist forces violated a 1992 cease-fire agreement and began shelling georgian villages . 
  that 's how the russo-georgian war of 2008 started . 
  false . 
  russo-georgian war was started with georgians shelling russian peacekeepers . 
  provocations both by ossetian separatists * and * by georgians were numerous earlier in 2008 . 
  according to the report of the fact-finding mission : `` president saakashvili 's order on 7 august 2008 at 23.35 and the ensuing military attack on tskhinvali turned a low-intensity military conflict into a full-scale armed conflict . 
  therefore this action justifiably serves as the starting point for the legal analysis of this conflict . '', 
  you said that russian separatists started the conflict in abkhazia . 
  i 'm arguing against that . 
  not against how abkhazians or ossetins work together with russians decades later . 
  chernobyl is often presented as a one of the most devastating technological disasters , as a scare tactic against nuclear technology . 
  there is no point in isolating nuclear tech when in fact many other technologies had disasters far more devastating , yet nobody is using them as an argument against the usage of those technologies . 
  how is this related to the fact that you confuse ossetians and russians ? 
  there were far worse technological catastrophies . 
  chernobyl was the biggest one only considering nuclear tech . 
  balts gon na be balts . 
  some of them blame russia for pretty much everything . 
   russian separatists started a conflict there russian separatists started a conflict in abkhazia ? 
  are you feeling well , mate ? 
   why do you doubt that i used a hyperbole ? 
  because i know a hyperbole when i see one . 
  it 's an obvious exaggeration beyond reason . 
  `` i have a ton of work '' is a hyperbole . 
  `` the rest of the country is completely abandoned '' is not , because the rest of the country * could * be completely abandoned , it just is n't . 
  by the way , i really liked how `` moscow and petersburg '' quetly turned to `` the main cities '' . 
   the distribution is quite uneven well , the distribution of the population is not even too , as well as the current state of the infrastructure and the stress it goes through . 
  it is quite unreasonable to assume that all the infrastructure in all the regions would require exactly the same investments . 
  `` moscow and petersburg are neat - but the rest of the country was completle abandoned - expect for some regions where local nobleman did some investments '' , this was your original message . 
  now with the help of your own data we can see that the rest of the country was not , in fact , `` completely abandoned '' ; it shows that * every single one of the regions * has some infrastructure projects planned or realized , and there are regions besides moscow and petersburg that are doing this on a scale comparable to those two cities . 
  even if we assume that you really tried to express something through a hyperbole ( and i really doubt that ) , i think we can agree that the hyperbole was way too hyperbolic . 
  reconstruction of r22 `` kaspiy '' or , for instance , new equipment in the hospitals of the tambov oblast , or the brand new ice arena in michurinsk is not `` subjective view '' , it 's a fact . 
  only one of us has no data , and it 's not me . 
  because you have brought nothing into the discussion besides your opinion . 
  it 's that simple . 
  if your opinion is not baseless , you are free to show the sources of it . 
  i do not have any statistical data on infrastructural spendings , but i see roads being renovated on a large scale , hospitals and schools receiveing new equipment and funding , so clearly , your original statement that `` the rest of the country is completely abandoned '' could n't be further from truth , hyperbole or not . 
  and if you think that what happens `` in the regions '' is miniscule compared to investements in moscow and st.petersburg , well ... as i have said , you are free to show your data . 
  i brought an anecdotal evidence , which while not much , is light years ahead of your opinion , based apparently on nothing . 
  decades of `` communism '' where on the left on this graph . 
   i had a fantastic childhood  i do n't have this kind of apocalyptic outlook on it well , that 's not surprising at all . 
  imagine yourself an adult , though , whose whole life just crumbled away . 
  this is not `` communism '' , this is what happened * after * `` communism '' ( or rather whatever system was in the ussr ) was destroyed . 
  you can see on the graph [ here ] ( https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/rgdpchrua625nupn ) the starting point . 
  why ? 
  because otherwise your `` opinions '' are worth nothing , and you bring nothing into the discussion . 
   but if you like - we should bring some actual numbers from citable sources you should 've done this from the start . 
  except it 's not opinions we 're talking about , it 's facts . 
  one can not agree or disagree with facts . 
  and `` the rest of the country was completely abandoned '' is not true at all . 
   the rest of the country was completle abandoned - expect for some regions where local nobleman did some investments you have absolutely no idea what are you talking about . 
  i live in a quite poor , mostly agrarian oblast ( tambov ) , and infrastructure is renewed or being renewed almost everywhere . 
   russians had been shamed in the first war and were very happy about the more successful second . 
  nobody sane was happy about the second chechen war . 
  for the majority of russians , no , they absolutely were n't . 
  considering that just a few weeks before an ultranazionalistic mob stormed government buildings and ousted a legitimately elected president ? 
  considering that the right sector already promised to send `` a train of friendship '' to crimea to `` prevent '' separatism ?
