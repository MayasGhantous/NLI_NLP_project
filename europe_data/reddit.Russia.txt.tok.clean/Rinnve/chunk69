  infrastructure , not people . 
  that 's how our government rolls , from what i 've observed . 
  `` these people have been replaced through an influx of russians -- mostly civil servants , military personnel , or retirees -- who have been given significant economic perks by the russian government for resettling there . '' retirees getting `` economic perks '' from the russian government for something , that 's a new one . 
  somehow i find it very , very hard to believe . 
  other countries do ? 
  nobody in russia would cheer horrible things like that . 
  defending the russian-speaking people of donbass from ukrainian ultranazionalists , however , that 's completely different . 
  edit : for downvoters , it 's not how i think about it , it 's about how it is presented in the russian media . 
   after that law was passed , gay theme was all over the media your words . 
  tsargrad tv is a fringe ultra-conservative channel , it does n't represent `` all the media '' . 
  your list , as shameful as it is , does n't contain anything that relates to the gay theme in the media ( except already mentioned tsargrad ) . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not saying that you were lying a couple comments earlier . 
  but it would be nice to see something concrete . 
  could you give a couple of examples of what i missed , please ? 
  media campaign ? 
  i must 've missed something . 
  quite a few people here who identify as christians did n't even read the bible and go to church once a year or so . 
  ( disclaimer : this is personal experience , not some social poll . 
  so , anecdotal evidence . ), 
   we were talking about them being puppets of the ussr . 
   of course they were persons with a brain , available to think , available to suggest . 
  except all your previous argument is built on an assumption that they basically had no will and no influence on their own , that the ussr completely controlled them . 
   justifying or whitewashing crimes against international law is also not allowed . 
  i 'm doing neither . 
  probably you 've lost the sight of the initial argument . 
  suggesting that polish and german leaders affected brezhnev 's decisions looks like soviet propaganda ? 
  you 're funny . 
  about twisting facts , reducing real persons acting in a very complex political web to mindless puppets , now that 's some real twisting . 
  regardless , the rules here do n't allow insults , so do behave . 
  it has nothing to do with my education , i 'm quite able to form opinions based on the freely available information . 
  if you do n't like that opinion , it is still is n't an excuse for insults . 
  the same argument could be used to justify actions of pretty much anybody , from soldiers to high command , in the ussr and in other wp countries . 
  ok , i get you . 
  czechs and slovaks were special , while all others were mind-controlled from the kremlin . 
   a very real threat of violence is `` nothing '' ? 
  plus why do you think soviet-installed puppets wanted to be against the ussr ? 
  czechoslovakia had the same threat , and the same `` soviet-installed puppets '' . 
  maybe it 's you who live in a parallel reality created by simplistic school history lessons , huh ? 
  czechoslovakia was the same `` puppet state '' until it was n't . 
  there was exactly nothing that stopped other `` puppets '' from doing so . 
  brezhnev was very indecisive , and among other things , [ he was pressured by polish and german `` puppets '' .

  https://ia600506.us.archive.org/17/items/intelligencememorandum--militaryinterventioninczechoslovakia1968-08-20/intelligence%20memorandum--military%20intervention%20in%20czechoslovakia%201968-08-20.pdf propaganda ? 
   we saw in 1968 how on their own checoslovakia was . 
  and what exactly `` we '' saw ? 
  that the other warsaw pact countries did n't like the way czechoslovakia went ? 
  it 's not like the ussr was on it 's own there . 
  anyway , you can not consider warsaw pact countries in the same way as the former su republics , even if your argument crumbles away without it . 
  and most of those live even worse than they were under the su . 
  stans , for instance . 
  pretty much all of them are totalitarian dictatorships . 
  also ,  poland , hungary , slovakia , east germany seriously ? 
  while the former su republics could be considered parts of `` the russian empire v 2.0 '' ( russification and all that jazz ) , warsaw pact countries were more or less on their own . 
  i posted `` china '' as a counter-argument to the statement that `` communists regimes were unreformable '' . 
  i thought it was obvious . 
  it is not much of a discussion if participant is arguing with the voices in his head , instead of the actual opponent . 
  i 'm pretty sure estonia is a molehill to russia . 
  tibet is just an example . 
  china is n't monolithic at all . 
  except i have never said that su could 've followed the same path as china . 
  your incorrect assumptions started there . 
  this is / u/xeno87 for you . 
  he 's big with anti-russian hate , not so much with knowledge . 
  downvote and move on , arguing with him is an exercise in frustration . 
  eh , ideology in the ussr was pretty much dead since mid 80s , beyond dead in late 80s . 
  in china there were n't many local governments desiring to get their own little dictatorships , i guess . 
  no , you do n't understand . 
  however , considering you have already started to put thoughts in my head and words in my mouth , i see no point in arguing with you . 
   it also was n't an empire enslaving many other countries . 
  tibet would like to have a word with you . 
  is irrelevant . 
  china is n't . 
   communists regimes were unreformable china . 
  there were a few cases , and from what i gather , possible ambiguity in the law is n't the problem . 
  the problem is that pretty much * any * information about gays which is not negative is considered propaganda . 
  for instance , [ this case . 
  ] ( https://rospravosudie.com/court-sudebnyj-uchastok-25-centralnogo-rajona-g-xabarovska-s/act-213787391/ ), 
  what do you expect from an ultraconservative religious tv channell ? 
  for example , in some other materials , they tell that russians do n't have the right to be atheists . 
   label whole group as quilty , and take their property to ease economical difficulties except this is as far as it gets from what 's really happening . 
  i think you misunderstood me . 
  if the chechen police is prosecuting gays , they ( chechen police , not gays ) are breaking the law , because there is no law in russia under which gays could be prosecuted for being gay . 
  that is , a quarter of the russian population have this channel in their tv programming packages . 
  even if they do ( though all evidence is on the `` he says she says '' level ) , they ( police , not gays ) are breaking the law . 
  edit : ambiguous wording . 
   so stop prosecuting people based on their sexual orientation nobody in russia is prosecuted based on their sexual orientation . 
  eh , they are all biased , of course , but at least some could be useful , if you know what you 're doing . 
  political talk shows , though . 
  those are pure cancer . 
  [ too bad you were n't out there in the 90s when they wanted to be heard . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/31/world/separatist-winning-crimea-presidency.html?mcubz=2 ), 
  not in russia . 
  eh , somehow drunk shooting was never much of a problem in russia , despite [ our hunting traditions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peculiarities_of_the_national_hunt ) . 
  so i suppose any source you do n't like would be either `` state propaganda '' , `` not neutral '' or whatever . 
  convenient . 
  anyway , war crimes are not genocide ( and , of course , they were not `` approved by russia '' ) . 
  oh , almost forgot , serbs committing war crimes does not excuse usa , by your own logic . 
  deliberate targeting civilians , you know . 
  this is a war crime . 
   are european countries never called fascist or do they deserve it ?
