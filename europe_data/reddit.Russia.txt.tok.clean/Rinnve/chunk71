  what the hell are you talking about ? 
   many independent trustworthy and impartial organization parties have verified it they * interviewed * . 
  this is very different from verification of what actually happened . 
  it 's sad you ca n't understand the difference . 
   also a blog is your counter ? 
  so , if the questions are merely in a blog , they do n't qualify ? 
   so unless russian federal government recognizes them as victim are they victim to you . 
  and now you 're putting words in my mouth . 
  not good , not good at all . 
   because they are untrustworthy : convenient . 
  no , because what i have already said : not enough facts . 
   here testimonies those are not testimonies . 
  how do i or anybody else could verify those ? 
  they are anonymous . 
  should i just simply trust journalists ? 
  no , i should not , because there are numerous cases of them mis-presenting information or simply lying . 
  you should n't too . 
  for instance : `` small details that anzor did n't want to make public led the police to believe that he and one of his friends were gay , he said . '' what `` small details '' could possibly lead to this , huh ? 
   credible seems i think i have already defined what credible * is * , there is no need to guess what it may * seem * . 
  credible means having enough hard facts that could be verified by independent parties . 
  and no , by the way , if authorities ( russian or otherwise ) just say something without any facts , there is no reason to believe them too . 
  standards are the same . 
   only criminal convictions are good enough for you an actual investigation would be good enough . 
  no , what fbk did is not enough , [ there are too many questions ] ( http://oleglurie-new.livejournal.com/316667.html ) and not nearly enough answers . 
   so to convince you i need to go to russia myself , run an investigation myself and present all that to you personally . 
  no , just link some credible news report which reports * facts * . 
  like [ this . 
  ] ( http://v1.ru/text/newsline/652465.html ) ( there are no names here due to the obvious legal implications , but there is enough information to believe it actually happened . 
  address , date , time , name of the police officer , etc. ), 
   the testimonies of the victims are not facts ? 
  no , unless there is enough information to believe they are indeed victims . 
  hint : simply saying `` i 'm a victim '' is not enough . 
   so people saying the armenian holocaust did n't happen are true when people ca n't say names , dates personally that is . 
  there is actually a ton of information about this event ( including names and dates ) , and nobody sane is arguing about if it happened . 
  the argument is about it being an intentional genocide . 
   funny from a man who is himself widely seen as corrupt yet again , exactly zero facts presented , just empty accusations . 
  this is getting tiresome . 
   murders can be a hate crime . 
  they can be , but a hate crime is a much wider definition . 
  sweeping a black eye under the rug is very , very different from sweeping an entire body there . 
   anyway chechnya is russia right ? 
  still no concrete facts . 
  names , dates and such . 
  also , hrw is * not * related to un in any way , why are you repeatedly trying to present it as such ? 
  why do you call a letter * to * un as `` un responding to russia '' ? 
   corruption is done on a massive scale and condoned by the authorities . 
  [ fighting corruption is an interesting way to condone it . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_anti-corruption_campaign ), 
  hate crimes = / = murder . 
  please show me one case when murder was `` swept under the rug '' . 
  oh , and please do n't use `` sources '' without any factual material . 
   further i do n't think i need to explain to a russian the level of corruption in their country ... what you do need is to understand what corruption is , apparently . 
  nobody would break the law just for the sake of it . 
  or for some ideas . 
  basically , a ton of money should be involved somehow . 
   it is condoned . 
  many things are illegal , but condoned in russia . 
  it would be nice to have some source behind both statements . 
  i 'm not your comrade , mate . 
  because pretty much every family in russia has lost someone in this war . 
  tatars are rather nice people , actually . 
  they are quite secular , though , and well-integrated in our society . 
   there are much better russian culture subs . 
  do tell . 
   the overthrow of yanik was a neo-nazi led western supported coup funniest thing is that this is correct , if only technically . 
  well , there is quite a lot of new vestas and xrays around here ( tambov region ) , so there 's that . 
  i 'm not sure how showing up * at work * on sunday is related to voting * at the voting station * . 
  this one though is something completely different to what you 've described : `` all of them will be loaded onto buses and we should all vote for the united russia party '' . 
  namely , an attempt at voting fraud ( an attempt since nobody could catch them voting for a different party ) . 
   in russia , voting often happens during lunch time in factories - and if you vote wrong there is a chance you get fired . 
  hey from the parallel world . 
  in our russia , voting happens during weekends , and nobody is watching you . 
  ( that does n't mean that there is n't an election fraud at least in some places , of course . ), 
  i see you do n't get the difference between backing your own words with credible sources , and providing a wall of text that could or could n't be related to them . 
  this is sad . 
  next , you 're evading the question , which is what exactly norwegian soldiers forgot in afghanistan ? 
  next , fascism is far more specific than just a `` form of authoritarian corporatism under one strongman leader '' . 
  and if you get in the details , it would be obvious that possible similarities between contemporary russia and fascist italia are rather superficial . 
  next , there is no `` demonization '' of sexual minorities and/or liberals in russia . 
  finally , i 'm still waiting for the specific data about russia 's `` irrelevance '' . 
  cyclists in our city used this day as an excuse to have some [ fun ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pb8chdp.jpg ) !, 
  not a very good photo , this is probably a 1/20 of people who were participating . 
  sadly , i was n't there myself , so that 's the only photo i have , thanks to a fellow photographer . 
   abysmal human rights record towards lgbt , drug addicts , hiv positive , journalists , political dissenters etc. 
  it is good to back one 's words with sources . 
  please do . 
   us is the only country that is comparably aggressive and even it has stopped from outright annexing territory yeah , annexing territory is so much worse than bombing countries on the other side of the world and killing thousands of innocent people in the process . 
  oh , and us is not the only country doing this . 
  one word : nato . 
  what [ those guys ] ( https://ivarfjeld.com/2010/10/06/norwgian-soldiers-in-afganistan-told-to-be-wild-animals-for-viking-gods/ ) forgot outside of their country ? 
   putins ideology is pretty much classical fascism in the vein of mussolini because you say so ? 
  classical fascism is n't compatible with a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural coutry which is russia . 
   compared to pretty much any other developed and industrialized state russia is the largest european state by population and is nearly twice the size of germany yeah , because the size of the territory is what matters the most . 
  disregard that 3/4 of it is barely habitable , disregard that the size itself is a great strain on the infrastructure , disregard all those pesky little details . 
   but look how irrelevant you are in comparison . 
  ok , let 's look . 
  i 'm waiting for data about our `` irrelevance '' . 
  please do show where exactly we are on the scales . 
   even the small and comparatively irrelevant nordic countries have brought many more good things to the table . 
  like those vikings from the link above ?
