  i 'm having a hard time recalling anything else besides that and norvegian oil , sorry . 
   it was said that was impossible also on chernobyl it was n't , actually . 
  chernobyl happened not because of a technological failure , but because of the absolutely reckless experiment conducted there . 
  if you try hard enough , you can break anything . 
   government that is actively malicious to its weakest members and promotes hatred towards these groups wha . . ? 
   extremely aggressive foreign policy extremely , compared to who ? 
  usa ? 
   state sponsorship of the islamist chechen republic yeah , because the alternative is even worse . 
  been there , tried that . 
   the military industrial complex is pretty much the only competitive industry russia has left [ 60 % of russia 's gdp is services . 
  ] ( http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/120615/emerging-markets-analyzing-russias-gdp.asp ) i do n't think you know what you 're talking about . 
   russia is in a slow descent into a fascist society . 
  source : the same as yours . 
   it is actually much harder to find something that russia actually contributes to the world compared to ... nordics ? 
  i would not go this way . 
  no country in the world is obliged to `` contribute '' to anybody except its own citizens . 
  the fact that you do n't like the `` excuses '' does n't makes them stupid . 
  ah , sorry , i did n't actually watch the video and just jumped to the ( wrong ) conclusion . 
  ( it 's a pretty common mistake . 
  `` primer '' instead of `` example '' , i mean . 
  jumping to conclusions too , though . ), 
  side note : [ primer in english ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/primer ) means something completely different than in russian . 
  you 'd want `` example '' . 
   compared to most other modern european cultures russia is deeply sociopathic . 
  how , exactly ? 
  as we all know here in / r/europe , putin is a dictator , there is no free press in russia , opposition is quelled , election fraud is wide-spread . 
  it 's common knowledge , is n't it ? 
   why estonian parliament ratified it ages ago while russia did not ? 
  the article you 've linked explains why . 
  exactly . 
  assuption that `` everything suits people just fine '' because of election results is correct only in the case of a democratic country . 
  this is what absolutely infuriates me . 
  when it 's convenient , russia is a totalitarian dictatorship . 
  but then - `` look at putin 's approval '' , `` look at the election results '' , `` russians deserve it , they support putin '' , et cetera , et cetera . 
  that , and the fact that living conditions did improve immensely during putin terms . 
  of course , there 's a significant part of post hoc fallacy right here , but that 's just how average people think . 
  you 're free to open those sites yourself and check other professions . 
   they had parliamentary elections recent . 
  so russia is really a democratic country , and not a dictatorship ? 
   i wonder how you would dig up it `` the other way '' . 
  i was n't talking about this specific thing , of course . 
  let me repeat my words : there is no country that did n't tried to conquer its neighbours with different degrees of success in one point of history or another . 
   it is russia today who does not want to recognize borders [ signing an agreement about borders is an interesting way to do this . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/russian/international/2014/02/140218_russia_estonia_boarder_treaty ), 
   russian empire look , if we go * that * way , i doubt there is any country that did n't tried to conquer its neighbours with different degrees of success in one point of history or another . 
  russian federation is not russian empire , it 's not ussr either . 
  do n't dig up history , it 's a game that could be played both ways . 
  first , annexing and enslaving two very different things . 
  i doubt that crimeans consider themselves `` enslaved '' . 
  the same about abhkazians and ossetians , who have been denied freedom from georgia in the nineties . 
  second , every neighboring country , really ? 
  the question is that from i know about ukraine , it just could n't be there . 
  rabota.ua tells me that a teacher in odessa ( 3rd largest city ) could earn about 5000 hrivnas/month ( $ 200 ) . 
  for a programmer , its up to ten times more . 
  in uk ( gini index of about 32 ) , indeed.co.uk tells me that the difference is about 2-3 times , and a teacher gets about $ 2000/month minimum . 
  k , whatever . 
  you 're obviously a shill with an agenda to push , considering how you repeat the same thing over and over without any facts or logical arguments . 
  have a nice day . 
   52 places from the worst my point exactly . 
  russia is not in a good shape considering inequality , but it is in no way somehow exceptional . 
  israel , turkey , georgia , argentina are all here , and even some eu countries are not that far away . 
  what a magical place / r/europe is !, 
  here russia at the same time could be a dictatorship without freedom of speech , total press control etc. 
  * and * a free country where legitimate polls could be conducted , where people form their opinions with the help of correct and unbiased reporting , and tell what they really think instead of what is expected to be heard . 
   commies held core of empire by 1918 ( less then in year ) as they had massive population support there . 
  1920-1921 - tambov rebellion , hundreds of thousands of people involved , tens of thousands dead . 
  massive support , eh ? 
  ( by the way , it kind of disproves your idea of stalin `` genociding '' volga/don/ukraine . ), 
   losses were enormous not because fighting was hard reds lost about million of soldiers , whites about 650 thousands , greens about milllion . 
  do n't know about you , but for me it is hard fighing . 
   `` expand and enslave '' . 
  this is the nature of russian state , and the self-recurring mindset of majority there . 
  it simply is not , no matter how much do you repeat it . 
   so their win in civil war was quite easy . 
  5 years of fighting , tens of millions dead . 
  `` quite easy '' my ass . 
  my point is that you 're trying to spin it as if most russians supported communists back then , and most russians support putin right now . 
  this is not true on both accounts . 
   political discourse of the soviet union and/or russian empire has always been determined by one single question `` how to enslave others ? '', 
  this is an oversimplification to the point of losing the touch with reality . 
   people who did not follow this agenda has always been marginalized by the population itself . 
  again , this is an outright lie that does n't have any root in reality . 
  well , [ according to the cia ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2172rank.html ) , russia is n't the country with the highest income inequality , pretty far from it . 
  ukraine being in the very low part of this list raises some questions , though . 
  with the help of * a part * of the russian population , against the other part of the russian population . 
   literally had soldiers block the doors so that the tatar representatives could n't get in . 
  could you give a source on that ? 
  i followed the news pretty closely , but i do n't remember this . 
  you do n't understand , there could be only russian shills . 
  this is how it works . 
   they believe that europe is fascist actually , i do n't know * anybody * in their 40s or 50s who believes that . 
  of course , this is an anecdotal evidence , but still . 
  many people , though , believe that baltics ( and not entire europe ) are kind of neo-nazi because of their `` ss parades '' , because they do n't know history behind latvian or estonian legions . 
   do n't lie about facts they do , actually . 
  ca n't find the link right now , but one of the big ones published an article about the infamous anti-gay law , where it stated that sochi olympics guests and athletes could be arrested under a suspicion of being gay . 
  yes , not for propaganda , but for simply being gay . 
  of course , now i 'm pretty sure there were many other lies before and after , but this one was the eye-opening moment for me , before it i trusted western media without any second-guessing ( `` serious '' , of course , not the likes of daily fail ) . 
  not that it proves or disproves anything , but there is [ a precedent with even higher numbers . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falkland_islands_sovereignty_referendum,_2013 ), 
   just a statistics bomb , or is it explored with nuance neither .
