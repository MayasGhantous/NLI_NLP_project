  more like `` oppression of the russian minority '' . 
  ( for instance , it was never mentioned that one possible reason some non-citizens keep their status is visa-free travel in both shengen and russia . ), 
  that said , lately it 's not often brought up , i believe ( although i do n't follow russian media very much , mostly the parts that proliferate into the english-speaking world ) . 
   nato `` occupation '' of the baltics uhm , it 's not presented like that here . 
  the logical chain is usually `` nato is bad =  baltics like nato =  baltics are bad '' . 
  the recent story with the estonian farmer is the only one i could remember that at least partially fits the `` occupation '' spin . 
  reason ? 
  no , more like a pretext . 
   was born and lived in ussr and what followed until when ? 
  let me guess , some point in the nineties ? 
  4th from the bottom in the list of `` friends '' ( 2 % ) , 13th from the top in the list of `` enemies '' ( 4 % ) . 
  toward russia as a country , and not latvians too but latvia as a country . 
  mostly because of nato i 'd guess , also that non-citizenship thing ( especially how it is usually presented in the russian media ) . 
  unless my english suddenly deteriorated , the graph is named completely wrong . 
  ( roughly `` which five countries would you call the most unfriendly , hostile in their relations towards russia ? 
  '' , thanks / u / _ marcoos ) . 
  the graph label talks about hostility * from * russians towards other countries : `` the countries russians were most hostile towards , according to a levada center poll . '', 
  uhm , i do n't think it 's really about terrorists . 
  wrong . 
  you can easily ban or regulate making another implementation . 
  of course , it would n't prevent it completely , but it would make it an illegal activity . 
  absurd ? 
  what 's absurd is expecting someone to respect the rules when you do n't . 
   other examples of nato invading countries simply because `` it doesnt like '' them ? 
  serbia is enough for me . 
  [ genocidal killing was never confirmed there . 
  ] ( http://www.b92.net/english/news/b92_focus.php?yyyy=2004&amp;mm=05&amp;nav_id=28447 ) deliberate targeting civilian objects , though ? 
  [ now that 's what was done for sure . 
  ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/19/opinion/charlie-hebdo-noam-chomsky/ )  not to be impolite , but hearing this from a russian is ... absurd . 
  it 's not if you consider that russia started to disregard the international law long after usa and their friends clearly demonstrated several times that they also disregard it when it 's convenient for them . 
  way to put the citation out of the context . 
  he was n't talking about how good was the s.u. , he was talking about something else completely . 
  `` i really said that i consider the disintegration of the soviet union a huge tragedy of the 20th century . 
  do you know why ? 
  first of all , because overnight 25 million russian people found themselves outside the russian federation . 
  they lived in a single country - they suddenly found themselves abroad . 
  can you imagine how many problems arose ? 
  household issues , family separation , economic problems , social problems [ ... ] '', 
  great , not to worry then !, 
  great , so a `` defensive alliance '' really means `` an offensive alliance if we do n't like you , and by the way fuck the international laws '' . 
  nato operation in yugoslavia * maybe * could be justified from the moral point of view . 
  big , big maybe . 
  but it clearly shows that nato is not a defensive alliance . 
  yesterday it was `` do n't plan on killing thousands of citizens '' , tomorrow it could be ~ ~ we do n't like your oil prices ~ ~ you 're ruining world economy , or whatever . 
  unless russia is in nato , it 's a threat . 
  huh . 
  care to provide a couple of examples ? 
   it 's a defensive alliance after all . 
  tell that serbia . 
   you 're making a whole lot of assumptions based on nothing you must be new here in / r/europe . 
  do you even understand how ridiculous this is ? 
  on one hand , russian tv news is filled with propaganda and hate towards baltics ; on the other , general russian population is ignorant of that . 
  just admit that you imagine things . 
  yeah , how convinient for you to claim some bullshit and then play `` russian deniers '' card . 
  we both know that you lied 4 hours ago . 
  not a single word in that segment could be qualified as hate towards estonia . 
   as usual hate we can argue about how biased this segment about * nato * ( not estonia ) was , but hate ? 
  i failed to find hate there . 
  also , this `` debunking '' did n't debunk anything , unless google translate really garbled the meaning . 
  when was the last time baltics were mentioned in the news here ? 
   other tv is barred huh ? 
  sans the language barrier , of course . 
   invade and annex bits of georgia [ that 's not what happened . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/responsibility_for_the_russo-georgian_war#eu_independent_fact_finding_mission_report )  worked to death in labor camps actually , [ average survival rate in gulag camps was about 95 % ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:gulag_mortality_rate_1934_1953.png ) . 
  why do you people feel the need to exaggerate the facts ? 
  what ? 
  people were crazy about the us in the nineties . 
  at first . 
  then shit went down real hard , `` democrat '' pretty much became a swear word ... oh , and that thing with serbia bombing did n't help too . 
   you would n't even know that there are problems because of censorship to begin with . 
  everyone would be a lot happier living equally poor and in ignorance , so maybe living in the ussr was better after all . 
  i do n't think you have a slightest idea about the life in the ussr . 
  i mean , pretty much everybody knew that the press lies to them . 
   language of peasants actually , modern russian language was defined by writers and poets like pushkin , who mostly were nobility . 
   but it does n't make their actions illegal or bad . 
  except it does , because [ they ignored the law . 
  ] ( http://mvd.tatarstan.ru/file/pamjatka_police.pdf )  how should a police officer understand that a person demanding his name is a citizen ? 
  this is beyond ridiculous . 
  we also see on the video that policemen refused to identify themselves and to explain what 's happening . 
  this is far more severe than some swearing in the state of stress . 
  what you could possibly know about education quality in russia ? 
   for example , remember the '' humanitarian convoys '' that were actually smuggling weapons and troops from russia to eastern ukraine ? 
  is there any source for this ? 
   600 km from baltic states is okay here 's where your thinking is wrong . 
  having baltic states in nato is totally * not * okay for the current russian government , but they already are in nato , and putin can not do anything to change that . 
  if you 're going to judge information by its source and not by its content , you wo n't get anywhere . 
  snyder 's work is heavily opinionated and the article i 've linked shows it in great detail . 
  you should read [ this .

   is n't he still revered by a significant part of the population ? 
  no , he is n't `` revered '' . 
  significant part of the population does n't consider him an absolute monster , that 's a bit different . 
   were n't there stalin buses a few years ago ? 
  have n't there been recent monuments to stalin in russia ? 
  is n't it acceptable to drive around with your motorcycle gang with a stalin flag ? 
  russia is a big country , why is it surprising that there are a few nutjobs here ? 
  yes , stalin imagery is n't banned , because however brutal he was , he did good things too . 
  no , government did n't install any monuments to stalin . 
   it seems reasonable to blame the government that allows this continued reverence and the people that buy into it . 
  here 's the thing , it 's not the government that is blamed , it 's the entire country .
