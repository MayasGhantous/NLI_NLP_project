  and no , again , there is no reverence ( except maybe for some commies ) . 
   loved by russians we 're talking about a freaking * dictator * here , are n't we ? 
  so people oppressed by brutal dictatorship ( and you guys never forget to remind that stalin 's regime was worse than nazis ) get the blame for what was done by said dictatorship ? 
  educate us . 
  moving the goalposts . 
  do n't do it . 
  yeah , because kgb archives in russia were all lies , but in ukraine they tell the truth . 
  sure . 
  whatever floats your boat . 
  meanwhile , i still would trust renown historians instead of random guys on teh internets . 
  they were n't classified in russia . 
  well , if you do n't trust r.conquest , who you are going to trust ? 
  politicians who declare holodomor a genocide for some bonus points and recognition ? 
   for others many independent sources must be the basis of conclusion . 
  oh the irony of this . 
  it 's palpable . 
   everyone else should get away with their crimes except it 's not about this , it 's about `` soviets were just as bad as nazis '' . 
  they simply were n't . 
  since when fiction books became a credible source ? 
  eh , i do n't care much about netflix in russia , the selection is even shittier than it is for the eu . 
  i just hope they wo n't block vpns . 
  [ ... which was n't a genocide . 
  ] ( https://www.amazon.com/years-hunger-agriculture-1931-1933-industrialization/dp/0333311078 ) ( it definitely was a man-made famine , though , because human factors like gross incompetence and wishful thinking did play a major role in it . 
  as for genocidal intent , it was n't confirmed by factual materials . ), 
  is it available on netflix in your country ? 
  it 's not there yet both in russia and ( through the vpn ) in lithuania . 
  eh , jessica jones was pretty good . 
  under stalin , yeah of course it was n't better . 
  but let 's also not forget that s.u. 
  existed for almost half a century after stalin , and it was very different . 
  russians who remember positive things about s.u. 
  most probably have in mind 1970s or 1980s , not 1930s or 1950s . 
  many people here who go in the `` but but russians like the ussr '' mode conviently forget that the ussr did n't start with stalin and did n't end with him . 
   take a look at the wiki page you linked - latvians were 75 % of the population in 1935 , while in 1989 ethnic latvians composed 52 % of the population . 
  percentage says exactly nothing about increases or decreases of ethnic population , it is about relative composition . 
  the graph i 've linked before makes it perfectly clear that percentage of ethnic latvians decreased not because they were `` ethnically cleansed '' ( killed or deported ) , but because of massive influx of non-latvians . 
  there is also a question of self-identification , specifically how many of those russians were n't migrants , but born to mixed parents , and named russian for some reason or other . 
  i 'm talking specifically about latvians ( green ) . 
   killing people because of their class . 
  deporting people . 
  however brutal those deportations were , the majority survived . 
  there is a pretty thick line between tens ( or even hundreds ) of thousands and millions upon millions . 
  i know all this and more , of course . 
  still do n't get how it could be compared to nazis who outright * slaughtered * millions of people just for their ethnicity . 
   ethnic cleansing in the baltic and around the black sea [ here 's ethnic composition of lativa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_latvia#/media/file:population-of-latvia.png ) . 
  latvian population decrease since the eu membership is almost the same as during ww 2 * and * soviet occupation under stalin 's rule . 
  are you seriously comparing this `` ethnic cleansing '' to what nazis did ? 
  way to cherry pick the reviews !, 
  ' a truly remarkable contribution to research into this important field . ', 
  - robert conquest if you do n't know , that 's one of the most renown researchers of holodomor who himself originally supported the idea of holodomor as genocide . 
   more russians were killed by soviets than any other soviet nationality . 
  way more than nazi did . 
  now try to back this ridiculous statement with some sources . 
   soviets artificially made a famine that killed millions of ukrainians [ modern historical research ] ( https://www.amazon.com/years-hunger-agriculture-1931-1933-industrialization/dp/0333311078 ) does not agree with this position , though . 
  according to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_latvia#/media/file:population-of-latvia.png ) , `` extermination of natives '' depopulated latvia about as much as eu membership . 
  4th reich confirmed . 
   are the stories told in it false ??? 
  are they fabrications ??? 
  lies ??? 
  i did n't watch all of it , but it starts right away with [ lies and manipulations ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bnatu/soviet_liberation_of_europe/dho2t25/ ) . 
   the soviet union is one of the darkest chapters of human history . 
  i ca n't believe how some people can defend that regime and its ideology . 
  soviet union was repressive , but i would n't say it was much worse than colonial regimes ( with the obvious difference of the repression vector ) . 
  what i ca n't believe is how people could equate nazis and soviets . 
  after ww 2 , significant part of europe * was * under a totalitarian regime . 
  we all can see that those countries managed to survive . 
  i very much doubt that would be possible if nazis were successfull . 
   the people i talk about , the russian speaking latvians , explicitly state their love for the soviet union , or wish to return to it . 
  the same people love the soviet union and/or wish to return to it , * and * tell you to get over the soviet occupation ( thus admitting it was an occupation ) ? 
  strange . 
  it would be also very nice to not equate russians and the russian government . 
   people like you end up advocating what happens shut the fuck up , i never did something like that . 
  it must be nice and easy living in your black-and-white little world . 
  try to answer my initial question with facts . 
  0:51 - `` only a fraction of soviet citizens were killed by nazis , the rest murdered by the soviets themselves '' 1:06 - again this [ myth about barrier troops ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3igu17/on_the_concept_of_soviet_barrier_troops_as/ ) 1:17 - cites a viktor baturin , `` chairman of the russian military history association '' ; google knows exactly nothing about both the man and the organization . 
  i 'm afraid i do n't have enough time to watch the rest of it , is it all a / r/badhistory material , or only the first two minutes ? 
   how do you get over the collective trauma of dragging your dead child out of a cold cattle car ? 
  how do you get over your grandparents being executed in a cold , damn cell ? 
  how do you get over your compatriots killing your grandfather for being a `` polish spy '' because he was born in krakow ? 
  how do you get over your compatriots using chemical weapons against peasants angry over * prodrazverstka * ? 
  huh ? 
  you do n't equate russians and soviets , that 's how . 
  also nice to know that you have a habit of talking to people 's flairs instead of people themselves . 
  it never ceases to amuse when guys like you call me `` brainwashed by putin '' when my main source of news are forbes and theintercept . 
  thanks , 
  so , you know jack shit about the topic you 're discussing . 
  good to know . 
   yandex news and search were quite noticeably biased in what they displayed during various events , both in russia ( e.g. 
  no mention of a protest ) and abroad . 
  good enough ? 
  nope , not good enough , since protests * were * mentioned . 
  [ yandex actually provided a logical explanation why exactly protests were n't high enough in the top , and they are working on improving their algorithms . 
  ] ( http://varlamov.ru/2300354.html )  both vk and yandex are being blocked due to data privacy concerns i agree with that , my question was about alleged propaganda . 
  instead of providing a concrete example of vk being used as a propaganda tool in a way which would be impossible for fb , you 're repeating the same thing over and over again . 
  i was n't insulting you , calling you mentally challenged is just an observation . 
  sorry , truth hurts . 
  who first used army , heavy weapons and air strikes ? 
  hint : not separatists . 
  dude , you just used bold font as an argument , instead of providing an actual example . 
  i have bad news for you .
