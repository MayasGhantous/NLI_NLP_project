   how a putin fan overseas pushed pro-trump propaganda to americans name one thing in the article that was made possible by alleged kremlin connections to vk , and would 've been impossible to do with fb . 
  show us the difference between vk the propaganda machine and fb the social network . 
   russian search engine yandex announces that unregistered media will disappear from search results so , following the law is propaganda now ? 
  what about yandex ? 
  so , to reiterate : * how exactly it makes vk a `` propaganda machine '' ? 
  * show us some examples of how kremlin uses vk for propaganda . 
  the question about yandex remains open also . 
   those sites are nothing but propaganda machines . 
  please explain how exactly vk or yandex is a `` propaganda machine '' . 
   he killed millions of his own people . 
  his own people remind me please , when did he kill millions of georgians ? 
   linguistically closest to ukrainian is n't russian . 
  it 's polish . 
  lexically , not linguistically . 
  this means that ukrainian has more common words with polish than it has with russian . 
  it says nothing though about grammar ( and from what i know from learning a bit of both polish and ukrainian , ukrainian grammar rules are much more similar to russian ones ) . 
  another example : russian is lexically closer to bulgarian than to ukrainian , but bulgarian grammar rules are very different . 
   to be exact , the stalin regime 's purges and deportations affected mostly non-russians you 're wrong . 
  during [ dekulakization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dekulakization ) almost 2 million peasants were deported , most of those were russian ; and this is only one event among many . 
  of course not . 
  but at least in the region i live and work in ( tambov oblast ) , it is for a teacher to decide which textbook to use . 
  the only requirement is that it is in the list of approved textbooks for the current year , and preferably that it is already present in the school 's library . 
  the simple answer would be `` we do n't know yet for sure '' . 
  what we know certainly is that stalin did prepared for a war , and that he did n't expect it to be that soon . 
  i 'm not much of a history buff , but if you 're insterested , you can read some interesting ( and controversial ) ideas [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v20/v20n6p59_michaels.html ), 
  it is hard to argue with professional historians , is n't it ? 
  there is no need to imagine anything , because this is exactly what happened . 
  within two weeks ( the time between german and soviet invasions ) , polish army was nearly defeated . 
  even without soviet `` help '' , germans would 've crushed them in another week or two - and in reality , [ phoney war took * months * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phoney_war ) . 
  russia on the other hand offered to team up with france and uk against the imminent threat , and only then `` teamed up '' with germany . 
  do you understand the reason behind the annexation ? 
  the war was inevitable , and without anti-german alliance stalin had only two choices : watch poland being eaten , or participate in that and have the german army further to the west . 
  the same letter poles did n't . 
  this data is questionable to say the least . 
  i do n't want to say that it is wrong or that the author lies , but prosvechenie was always strong player in the textbook market , market share of 0.23 % in 2013 is absurd . 
  this `` shortly after '' was enough for germans to almost defeat polish army . 
  appeasement , other non-agression pacts , uk 's and france 's reluctance to make an anti-german alliance with the s.u. 
  enabled the following events . 
  molotov-ribbentrop pact was not signed in the vacuum , you know . 
  yeah , polish territory where the poles were a minority . 
  sure . 
   20 million + russians dead and 7 million ukrainians under stalin [ those numbers are * grossly * exaggerated . 
  ] ( http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2011/03/10/hitler-vs-stalin-who-killed-more/ ), 
  the nazis invaded poland , defeated its army , and then s.u. 
  invaded to took what belonged to it under the pact ( and what was taken by poland only twenty years ago ) . 
  why it is important , but not the german-poland non-agression pact , which allowed the nazis to prepare to the war ? 
  more like for a russian who does n't like the s.u. 
  being presented as the only other party behind the wwii besides the nazis themselves , while poland , uk , france and others dindu nuffin . 
  still , a source would be nice . 
   by trading with nazis even after they attacked poland ? 
  and ensuring they wo n't attack them ? 
  so , by doing about the same thing poland itself did a few years ago ? 
  if you agree that what the s.u. 
  did is `` helping the nazis '' , then half of europe and the usa helped them too in one point of the 1930s or another , including poland , france and the uk . 
   which started in mid-1941 by the way . 
  of course i know about land-lease , and that 's exactly what i 'm talking about : most historians agree that while land-lease helped , it most probably was n't a deciding factor ( in other words , it could n't be said that without land-lease the s.u. 
  surely was doomed ) . 
  this is actually not that important . 
  what 's important is that m.-r . pact was n't the only enabler of the wwii , far from it . 
   however , it 's likely that prosveschenie 's textbook will be pushed on schools no such thing . 
  schools themselves ( teachers , actually ) decide which textbooks to use . 
  source : am a teacher ( informatics ) . 
   the uk [ oh that 's rich coming from you . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appeasement#the_conduct_of_appeasement.2c_1937.e2.80.9339 ) and no , the soviets did not `` jointly invade poland '' with the nazis . 
   russia call nato fascist citation , please , or shut the fuck up . 
  soviets * helped * the nazis ? 
  how , exactly ? 
  the s.u. 
  army entered poland about two weeks after the nazis attacked , at that point the fate of the poland army was already sealed . 
  allies stepped in in 1943 ( iirc ) , when the s.u. 
  was already pushing the nazis out . 
  their help was welcome and allowed to shorten the war , but no historian i know of would agree that without the allies s.u would 've been doomed . 
   the soviet union was allied with the nazis from 39-41 non-agression pact is not an alliance . 
  what people in here like to forget is that the s.u. 
  was not the only one to have one , and the main reason behind the molotov-ribbentrop pact was unwillingness of france and the uk to ally with the su against the nazis . 
  it is hard to say because there is a lot of bias and disinformation in both russian and ukrainian media . 
  we can trust only hard facts like this video which shows that there are people in ukraine who called for ethnic cleansing , that those people are not `` fictional '' . 
  as far as i know , in russia people who threat other people even verbally ( let alone carrying out actual ethnic murders ) are being dealt with rather swiftly . 
  again , as far as i know , ukrainian government failed to find anybody to hold accountable for the massacre in odessa . 
  i think those kids who merely wished death upon russians are safe from any form of punishment . 
   fictional ukrainian fascists looking to ethnically cleanse them [ fictional , you say ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/ofef5l72sjq?t=15 ) ( for those who do n't know ukrainian , they were chanting `` muscovite to the gallows '' . ), 
  though technically those are n't fascists , they 're just high school students . 
  i 'm not sure which is more scary . 
  nice attempt at evading the question , but no . 
  * heavily armed * # * heavily armed * separatists did n't had any tanks and other armor at that time . 
  why did the ukrainian army commited an air strike , and started to use mlrses later ? 
  who was `` hiding behind civilians '' at that time ? 
  the answer is obvious , you just do n't like it very much . 
  according to [ cnn ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/03/world/europe/ukraine-luhansk-building-attack/ ) , for example . 
  and i 'm talking not about entire lugansk , of course ( it 's not a small city after all ) , but this precise place . 
  where were those `` heavily armed russian militants '' who `` forced '' ukrainian army to use an aircraft and to murder civilians , huh ? 
  in that stage of conflict separatists did n't use heavy weapons at all , if memory serves me right . 
  i think it 's rather clear who were terrorists here . 
  there were exactly zero heavily armed russian militants at that time in lugansk . 
  actually , all people killed and wounded in the attack i 'm talking about were civilians ( even though [ ukrainian wikipedia page call them `` terrorists '' ] ( https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0412\u0438\u0431\u0443\u0445_\u0431\u0456\u043b\u044f_\u041b\u0443\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0457_\u041e\u0414\u0410_2_\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043d\u044f_2014_\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0443 ) ) . 
  i do n't think you understand my message . 
  while i generally agree with you , even one teensy mob chanting `` hang the russian ! '', 
  is one mob too much for me .
