   russia uses nazi completely without irony . 
  because guys who walk around with ss insignias , praise known nazi collaborator as the national hero and shout things like `` russians to knives '' and `` hang russians '' are totally not neo-nazis , amirite ? 
   again , ukrainian claims are verified by journalists all over world . 
  i 've linked cnn article in which ukrainian claims on one particular event were classified as ` blatant lie ' . 
  have cnn suddenly became russian propaganda ? 
   i have no reason to believe ukraine lies about the column that violated ukraine border as yet another act of war . 
  ukraine lied about different events , it is proven fact . 
  this is one reason to question every ukrainian statement and to check it thoroughly . 
   it was verified by outside sources with journalists on the scene . 
  it was not . 
  the even of russian military machines crossing the border with ukraine was not documented . 
   russia telling the truth is news by itself . 
  they operate thinking the world is full of trapped soviet citizens . 
  lazy and pathetic . 
  the world knows . 
  opinion of some random buddy on the internets is surely very important for every russian citizen . 
  usa stronk !, 
  this is not the same statement as ` the ukrainian government knows the importance of being as credible \u00e4 source as possible ' . 
   i do n't know if they have lied . 
  why then do you involve in discussion on topic about which you have no knowledge ? 
  if you think your opinion on russia is of any relevance , think again . 
   now prove to me that they did n't hit civilian buildings . 
  how exactly it is related to ukrainian government caught lying about different events ? 
  actually it 's you who tries to change topic from ` ukraine being as honest and credible source as possible ' . 
  inconvenient truth hurts , does n't it ? 
  baltika is utter shit compared to most russian beers too ( even to some sorts that are made on baltika factories , do n't know how it 's possible , but somehow they manage to do just that ) . 
   the people on this sub almost never use ukraine sources . 
   the ukrainian government knows the importance of being as credible \u00e4 source as possible ok ? 
  glorious cnn , actually . 
  your opinion does not matters at all . 
  facts are what matters . 
  ukrainian government lied more than once in that conflict , this is fact . 
  it has all the links . 
  ` ac unit ' : http://uapress.info/ru/news/show/26567 http://inforesist.org/vzryv-v-luganskoj-oga-vyzvala-raketa-vypushhennaya-iz-zdaniya-usbu-miliciya/ and what it actually was : http://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/03/world/europe/ukraine-luhansk-building-attack/ `` the authorities in kiev denied its planes had been involved . 
  initially , the anti-terrorist operation said the explosion originated from inside the building , then that an anti-aircraft missile operated by the separatists had misfired , reacting to heat from an air-conditioning system on the outside of the building . 
  but a cnn investigation in luhansk has found clear evidence that whatever detonations hit the building and the adjoining park came from the air . 
  the tops of trees were splintered , and a series of small craters -- about a dozen -- had been blasted in a straight line , starting in the park and reaching the walls of the building , blowing out many of its windows and spraying the area with jagged shrapnel . 
  that 's what appears to have killed most of the victims and injured 20 more . '' one example of premature success report : http://www.president.gov.ua/ru/news/30871.html https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%91%d0%be%d0%b8_%d0%b7%d0%b0_%d0%a1%d0%b0%d1%83%d1%80-%d0%9c%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%b8%d0%bb%d1%83_ ( 2014 ) edit : downvotes for providing a source . 
  / r/europe at its finest . 
   additionally , the ukrainian government knows the importance of being as credible \u00e4 source as possible actually , the ukrainian government was caught on blatant lies several times already . 
  infamous ` ac unit incident ' , reports on military success when in fact the operation in question did n't even started , separatists killed in hundreds a day , etc. 
  olympic games in sochi were just a half year ago , yet people already forget the shitstorm of tweets about `` horrible conditions '' yadda yadda , when minor fails got blown way out of proportion and even fake pics got reposted and reposted and reposted . 
   laptops are never called buks in russian . 
  except they are . 
  your google proof is incorrect because ' \u0431\u0443\u043a ' also means beech . 
  you can search for '' \u0431\u0443\u043a \u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0433 '' which will get you a ton of different slang dictionaries [ like this ] ( http://www.slovonovo.ru/term/%d0%91%d1%83%d0%ba ) . 
   you watch this video and then you tell me , who do you want to be the cultural leaders of modern rus ' except they are not leaders . 
  maidan was used to install the new boss , same as the old boss . 
  all people who are in power now in ukraine were in power for years , just on different positions . 
   we also welcomed the germans !, 
  why not ? 
  i 'm not justifying the deportation . 
  i just pointed out that it was not done for teh lulz . 
   and let 's not forget the crimean tatars , who got deported en masse to siberia by stalin because hey let 's fuck with them nope . 
  because crimean tatars welcomed nazis and more than 10000 of them joined nazi army while others tried to betray and expose local resistance on any opportunity . 
  you need more caps . 
  also , since when kamaz heavy trucks and gazelle ambulances became military ? 
  `` in response to large-scale aggression utilizing conventional weapons in situations critical to the national security of the russian federation . '', 
  it is quite clear that it is about military aggression against russia . 
  and in 2010 doctrine : 2010 edition limited them to situations in which `` the very existence of the state is under threat . '' ( from your link ) . 
  which makes the whole article completely meaningless . 
  read the [ original military doctrine ] ( http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2000_05/dc3ma00 ) . 
  it mentions limited nuclear strike as a response to a large-scale aggression . 
  piontkovsky takes ` limited nuclear strike ' and conveniently forgets about the ` response to an aggression ' part . 
  it is sensationalist trash at best , quite crude propaganda at worst . 
  pressure over the debt reported in oct 2013 , not the first report either : http://www.gazeta.ru/business/2013/10/29/5728457.shtml gazprom removed the discount after crimea chose to join russia , not after yanukovich was ousted . 
  after ukraine refused to pay , gazprom offered to lower the price ( for example , [ this article ] ( http://izvestia.ru/news/572325 ) mentions return of the discount ) . 
  as for now , this came nowhere . 
  there is a plenty of food produced in russia , actually . 
  i honestly do n't know where people get this idea that those bans are going to cause food shortages . 
  so you 're comparing two senior officers of major intelligence service with somebody who even theoretically do n't have access to any inside information besides hearsay ? 
  `` piontkovsky does not provide direct evidence for this '' this is the only line worth reading in that article . 
   but gazprom only increased prices after an authoritarian leader defected and after russia annexed crimea . 
  this is factually wrong . 
   instead they never pressured ukraine over the debt this is wrong too . 
   ** executed people for breaking curfew ** do you have trouble with comprehending a text ? 
  protectionism is always a boost when used correctly . 
  that is , when additional profits are not consumed but invested in production . 
  may be i 'm mistaken , but i see it as a protectionism policy in disguise . 
  our agriculture could use a little boost . 
   executed people for breaking curfew source on that , please ? 
   from what i have heard , russian food prices are already inflated , i have heard the price of a small cup of coffee can cost you 8 usd that 's in moscow cafe . 
  they are known for inflated prices . 
  once i bough there a coupe of beers without asking the price and regretted that immediately , having to pay insane $ 30 for that . 
  i do n't have statistics , but i can give you one example . 
  my brother lives alone , he spends about 3000 rubles/month on food ( about $ 85 at current exchange rate ) . 
  food in big cities tend to be more expensive than that , but salaries are higher too . 
   the eu may not need ukraine , but that does n't mean they wo n't accept them . 
  association agreement was not about ` eu accepting ukraine ' . 
  it was about ukraine opening their markets for eu goods and about ukrainian citizens to travel to eu as a cheap labor force . 
  it is bad for ukraine in short term ( though it * may * be beneficial in long term ) * and * it 's good for eu in short term . 
  in other words ...  the eu needs nothing to do with ukraine ... association agreement lists plenty of things to do with ukraine that are certainly beneficial to eu . 
   i 'm more hesitant to dismiss allegations of fraud and lack of independent monitoring . 
  i do n't know about fraud ( though knowing typical late-soviet-made small local authorities , certain amounts of fraud are inevitable even if unasked by central government ) but there were independent ( not russian and not crimean ) monitors . 
  osce monitors simply refused to , ah , monitor . 
  just because . 
   what nation in the eu is n't western-aligned ? 
  i 'm not talking about alignment , i 'm talking about country-specific interests ( france 's mistrals , for example ) . 
   the eu does n't need ukraine . 
  i do n't think so .
