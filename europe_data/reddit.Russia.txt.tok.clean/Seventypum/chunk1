  175 , 52 , easy bellygrab sitting . 
  welp , i have seen the highlighted parties on previous elections , and have n't seen the ones not highlighted . 
  most likely it has something with party age/popularity . 
  or if they are registered somewhere . 
  not sure , actually .

  yup , roskomnadzor is an incredibly shitty thing , noone likes it . 
  most people do n't need to visit the restricted sites , tho , as it usually gets to banning foreign sites , which are not quite popular in russia , or russian sites with content about drugs or terrorism , or suicide ; and people who visit them had to learn how to proxy . 
  of course , there are cases like lurkmore or wikipedia bans , where serious shit happens , but popular resourses are usually unbanned quite fast . 
  would n't trade my lovely fake pasta for anything . 
  well , on the bright side , putin also looks like humans from [ van eyck pictures ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/68/ec/84/68ec84a1d140cc4e5d4f715f0ffa2b89.jpg ) !, 
  you see , ivan , when you shoot enemy hair with water pistols , you can hurt them without wasting bullets !, 
  with those mods you have no freedom !, 
  with soviet ~ ~ bear ~ ~ paravin freedom has you !, 
  vote soviet paravin !, 
  `` easy '' , `` shadenfreude '' ( although we have equivalent word - '' \u0437\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e ( zloradstvo ) '' , i like the sound of it '' ) , '' \u0434\u044f\u043a\u0443\u044e \u0442\u043e\u0431i '' ( `` thank you '' , because i spent a lot of time in crimea while it was ukrainian ) . 
  lasagna is the thing . 
  goddamn it , udija !, 
  thanks for the answer , the more you know, 
  so , basically , anyone can make a highdef photo of their genitals , print a lot of huge posters and make those logos for their art/business ? 
  ^ 10/10 ^ would ^ move ^ to ^ denmark ^ to ^ do ^ that, 
  but is this even legal ? 
  they have , like , visible parts of genitals . 
  i was always interested : are those posters , like , glued everywhere , or are they only listed on sites/magazines about this comedy ? 
  more chocolate , less income . 
  i believe , poland was n't very happy with all them apples previous year . 
  do n't worry , amsterdam is beautiful too !, 
  gorgeous one . 
  mmm clay, 
  nope , russia actually supports separatists with humanitarian aid and polytical approval . 
  the military support , however , while not being 100 % proved , is possible , yet you ca n't just say `` just look at them !, 
  look they have soldiers and weapons !, 
  it is obvious that those are russian !, 
  '' , as donetsk and lugansk were the industrial center of ukraine during the peaceful times , and before that , during the soviet union they were regions of interest too , so , they were armed well and had nice local military infrastructure . 
  you should n't consider them just some random guys who somehow manage to fight versus the rest of ukraine . 
  also , ukraine is n't having it 's best times currently too , as lots of soldiers are not professional militarists , but the same people as donetsk ones , who voluntered or joined involuntarily the armed forces , so , it 's mostly a stalemate with some actions from both sides . 
  the military warehouses near lugansk and donetsk could easily contain buk-class weapon , as they are primary anti-air weapons . 
  while ammo and weapons are not infinite , they were n't used that much either : the group of ukrainian military forces , for example , was holding in surrounded donetsk airport for almost half a year , first two month in complete blokade under lots of siege operations , and did n't have any problems with ammo or machines . 
  the amount of ammo wasted on those conflicts is not that great , as neither side is going all-in offence or trying to advance deep into enemy territory . 
  dpr is holding grounds to save people in donetsk and lugansk , ukraine military forces does same to save people behind their backs too . 
  money means a lot , yet donetsk oblast ' was really reach industrial center , and has it 's resources . 
  so much this . 
  i have some ukrainian friends , and they say , that all this russian-ukraine conflict was blown really fast . 
  like , everything went great , and then in 3 month there are already `` the ones who do n't jump are moscovites '' and `` damn ukrops '' . 
  the media is doing shitty work too , showing the opposite sides as heartless bloodlasting monsters . 
  screw war . 
   soviet heavy weapon like buk and other soviet weapon ? 
  because literally everyone are using soviet weapons on post-soviet territories . 
  even ukraine does . 
  i believe i would kindly refuse your proposal , my apologies . 
  first : that 's what i 've got browsing european reddit . 
  also photoshopped clouds and `` passports of russian soldiers '' , but i saw the latter on local tv . 
  i did n't take / r/ukraine , / r/ukraina or / r/russia in there , because all those are heavily biased , while the europe ones are mostly showed from the more european news agencys points of view ; you can also visit subreddits yourself any time . 
  i believe , if there were huge proofs about that , there would be no need to locate the guy who is in russian army because he said that on his vk page , and made photos on ukrainian territory . 
  second : what ? 
  not unbiased , more likely different-sided . 
  ukrainian side : the rebels are obviously supported by russian soldiers and machines , there are proofs showing this , like those 2 soldiers telling that they are russian or selfie warrior , those are not super reliable , but still proofs . 
  ukraine is now closest to europe than it could ever been with yanukovich . 
  full format russian-donetsk agression is coming from the east , most likely backed with kadyrov troops from checnya , yet ukrainian army is able to counteract those attacks . 
  both sides are using heavy artillery . 
  also crimea is occupied by russian forces which are making civilians look like they are happy and ok with annexation . 
  russian side : the rebels are using humanitarian aid from russia , which consists of food and medicines , and was approved by international judges on the border ( not sure about recent ones , the first ones for sure ) . 
  rebels did n't like the violent riots which lead to government changing to forces , backed by ultra-nationalists , and made a referendum to become mostly autonomous from new governmented ukraine . 
  ukraine did n't like this and sent troops to punish the separatists , but faced the armed response and started using the heavy artillery , which heavily damaged donetsk , killing and mutilating a lot of civilians , yet now rebels manage to hold the front line away from big cities . 
  both sides are currently using artillery . 
  current situation on the ukraine is pretty shitty about economics , inflation strikes . 
  also crimea is happy with annexation , because it was rotting into shithole during past 20 years . 
  osce side : both sides are doing retarded shit , not listening to minsk agreement , and using artillery . 
  they do n't observe the political situation , however . 
  better read their site for the newest information . 
  reddit side : it 's obvious that russia is invading ukraine , goddamn putin , do n't give him attention , now give him all attention we have , lol look at this bomb with reddit name , that 's great . 
  also do n't let world cup happen in russia because politics . 
  my side : goddamn it we all are so fucking retarded i ca n't even fucking stand it now . 
  the only thing i can tell for sure is that crimea became more interesting when i visited it previous summer than it was before , it 's currently being reborn . 
  prices dropped slightly , pensions rose a lot ( my gran was a citizen of ukraine and was getting like 75 $ per month as pension , now she gets 300 as russian citizen ) . 
  also the healthcare is now mostly free for everyone .

  like , being a dank meme and so . 
  god i love this and serbia strong . 
  til something , thanks a lot for the answer !, 
  gold - material , yellow - color . 
  golden color is a type of yellow color . 
  technically , goebbels was not wrong . 
  can you clarify , please , is this an insult for a color to be called yellow instead of gold ? 
  did gold stand for something ? 
  i 'm just really interested . 
  too much mother material , i believe , so if you wo n't participate in your kid 's life being late from work or such , she will most likely overmother the child like there is no tomorrow . 
  probably this usually happens due to the fact that a lot of men died during wwii and single mothers raised their sons overprotecting them since that time . 
  also , we have some girls , who are full `` get as much kids as possible '' , and that 's more of a bad thing , because such girls sometimes do n't tell you about that until you find out that the condom had a hole in it , and she says `` omg it 's so good i will be mother ! '' . 
  and by good i probably meant good overall , like , being nice soulmates , beautiful and loving . 
  of course , it differs , and i would n't , like , compare them with girls from other countries , but for me they are still awesome . 
  but sanctions, 
  dude , check your canada level , you start apologising for no reason . 
  i guess that 's great !, 
  russian girls are mostly good , i believe , so you are a lucky guy !,
