  ^ but ^ seriously , ^ check ^ the ^ toddler 's ^ bed ^ for ^ aks ^ or ^ matryoshkas , ^ our ^ strong ^ russian ^ blood ^ can ^ show ^ itself ^ any ^ moment . 
  good job , comrade , good job !, 
  grats to both of you . 
  uhh , now i feel like sanctions against russia are the thing connecting europe altogether . 
  damn , i 'm proud . 
  well , the event happened right outside of tallinn , in which german , estonian , french , american and sweden citizens died . 
  i guess the forces who shot down the plane is what matters . 
  i usually consider the '' ) ) ) ) '' as lots of chins + one mouth on the top , so , the eyes are probably are under layers of fat . 
  ^ / r/fatpeoplehate ^ never ^ forget, 
  but jorji , udija is not a real country !, 
  actually nice vid , lithuanians , you 're great . 
  ^ absolutely ^ * smile *, 
  good night , sweet prince . 
  so is sir terry pratchett , if you did n't hear about that . 
  those were two strikes in a row . 
  i completely agree with you , props to you , mate . 
  thanks , for explaining , man . 
  initially thought something wrong was with pope , but as i know he is a pretty cool guy not being greedy and stuff . 
  and top of the line cars , well , are a common problem . 
  can you explain what was about that pic with cars , that was submitted yesterday , please ? 
  too much diversity . 
  there is that superfast train , and there are other types of trains , which are slower than that one . 
  yet i believe , you can travel more than 1000 kilometers in almost any distance in european part of russia every day , for example , i 're used a lot of old trains , which covered the 3300 km distance ( south ural - crimea ) in less than 70 hours , including all stops and borders . 
  welp , the article is not wrong . 
  the thing is , many people were always leaving russia/soviet union , it 's not a modern tendency . 
  there were waves of emigration in su , and now almost everyone are free to leave the country . 
  the life in russia is not bad , tho , it 's just pretty much different , and if you do n't like it , it 's your right to try to change it or to try another country ; that 's what globalization is for ? 
  that 's impressing , actually . 
  that sounds like a nice plan , creating minorities and then defending them . 
  i like it . 
  it 's another day in civil war * after minsk agreement and right before g7 summit * , so , it will be more recent , and thus more important confrontation . 
  noone is going to remember the actions which happened year ago , but the recent ones will be discussed and have a greater impact on the european countries ' decisions . 
  the siege/defence of marinka , a village on the border between the forces of government and rebel armies . 
  it was a full-sized conflict , where both sides ( most likely , no confirmation about dpr side , ukrainian side for sure ) used heavy artillery . 
  the results are not well known for now , yet according to osce marinka is still under control of the government . 
  thanks , man , read it , nice article , yet quite predictable after yesterday 's events . 
  can someone post a link for a full article , or it 's text ? 
  hate to subscribe on those things even on 10minutemails . 
  good job , comrade , i will tell dmitrii that you worked good today , he will give you an additional bottle of vodka . 
  by the way , i have some ukrainian friends , and they tell , that ever since all that stuff started to happen , the economics went straight down , and inflation rose a lot . 
  while yanukovich was on his post , grivna : rouble exchange rate was like 1:4 , and did n't change much during that time , while in those two years it changed to 1:2,3 ; and we should n't forget about the dollar : rouble course from 1:30 year ago to 1:50 right now . 
  not talking anything about `` evil russian invaders '' , as the fall started right after the leadership of ukraine changed , and before the civil war started ( btw crimea referendum is not considered a war , if something ) . 
  why having some nazi mods ? 
  soviet bear will purge all nazis . 
  vote soviet bear !, 
  thanks , would really like to visit in future !, 
  estonia : * always wanted to visit tallinn , being fan of sergey dovlatov , who described that city as compact , friendly and beautiful . 
  * recommended : was not dissapointed : the elder part of tallinn is just gorgeous , and the newer part of the city is really amazing . 
  the cathedral was astonishing , and that town hall , and buildings around , mhm . . also estonian accent is really wonderful , and most of elder estonians know russian language , which made communication much easier . 
  * avoided : although our guide highly recommended the `` peppersack '' inn , prices looked a bit higher than in other nearby restraunts , and also most of guide 's enjoyments were about local beer , and i do n't really drink alcohol . 
  otherwise perfect trip , enjoyed every second . 
  sweden : * freakin ' vassa ( not sure if it 's correct typing ) ship is all i will be telling you , i 'm just astonished how much work was put into all the operation to lift it from the bottom of the sea . 
  also nice museum of astrid lindgren ( love karlsson ) . 
  * avoiding : met nothing about it , yet my travel was mostly through the capitals ( using the huge ferry from st. petersbourgh ) . 
  did n't like the things told by guide about strict juvenile justice , tho , but it has nothing about the travel itself . 
  finland : mostly ridden through on the bus , and the forests i saw were beautiful . 
  helsinki is a great city , yet i do n't remember anything aside from the main picture , except the rail station , which was great . 
  also loved the guide 's stories about finnish lifestyle doing sports and sitting in sauna and all the other things . 
  * avoid : returning from helsinki to st. petersburgh on ferry . 
  there were lots of finns , who , according to guide , use the ferry to get cheaper alcoholic beverages on russian territory . 
  when we came to st. petersbourgh at the morning , the ferry looked like it survived zombie apocalypse : dead bodies everyhwere , legs sticking from every second room etc. 
  they were n't disturbing anyone , tho , so i do n't know if you should avoid some great party , like i did , because im a bundle of sticks in parties things . 
  otherwise liked the finns really much . 
  i 'd get spaghetti strainer and go full pastafarian, 
  well , he is obviously happy about that , and obviously wants to congratulate him as sign of good relationship . 
  it 's more like him either abstaining from any reactions just to not piss some europeans , or losing an opportunity of strengthening the bonds with fifa ? 
  obvious choice , i believe . 
  was n't that posted , like , yesterday , with the exact same title ? 
  we need of no homogay nazi inside us , that 's why we of consuming boars . 
  michail prochorov was a president candidate in 2012 , and had much more support and love from people , than navalny or nemtsov , for example . 
  he , participating in the presidental elections for the first time , instantly got third place with almost 8 % of votes ( pretty many , as most russians support putin ) . 
  was a liberal , made some great ideas , was not a douchebag and actually achieved some good impressions from public . 
  yes , rospil was some great service . 
  if only it worked . .

  because we do n't have good liberal forces in russia . 
  back in 2012 or when was that ( the time there were marches on swamp - bolotnaya square ) i was fully anti-putin , and tried to participate in the local event . 
  it was n't really well organised , it was mostly like `` fuck putin in particular '' movement , and then i asked my friends from moscow about the one on bolotnaya square , and they said , that it was a pile of bullshit from both sides of a conflict . 
  the thing is , that time there were hella lot of statements like `` we are liberals , we 're perfect , put russia up from the kneels '' , while our government were acting as usual , without playing the white knight role , so , it was bigger strike on liberals , than on the government . 
  ok im freakin done with polytics . 
  do you love kittens ? 
  ** tldr ** both sides fucked up , thanks obama, 
  paraphrasing pratchett : ` and do n't write about dank memes . ', 
  ` fine . ', 
  ` and do n't write down that i said do n't write about dank memes . ', 
  ` okay . 
  can i write down that you said that i should n't write down that you said ? ', 
  still a meme overload there tho ' centralised homo jew nazi islamist pagan meme ** liberal ** user who do n't support fifa junta , ftfy . 
  well , in my region there are also plenty of tataris and bashkiris , who are awesome guys , being islamic . 
  and the times i saw chechens and dagestanians ( in moscow ) , they were pretty good . 
  centralised homo jew cia nazi islamist ** internetmemes ** junta , ftfy, 
  we do , and that 's why there are almost no left , extincting and staff ^ * m-m-m , ^ boars *, 
  well , to clarify , russia has done bretty good with islamism , as west-southern parts are mostly islamic , and we are ok with that . 
  centralised homo jew ** american ** nazi corrupt junta would be a better ftfy, 
  ooh , a subject i recently fucked up with in another thread . 
  love it too tho ' . 
  checked wiki , on russian and english ones both cyril and methodius are stated as greeks on birth and living , yet they were actually in bulgarian empire later on , and after that they got an idea to rework the alphabet ; it was also finished by bulgarians kliment and naum , so , apparently , there is grain of truth in your statement  did n't understand the statement about friends , as , the thing that bulgarians made the ancestor of our language , is actually pretty awesome ! ^ and ^ i ^ did n't ^ know ^ it ^ before ^ and ^ that 's ^ sad, 
  i belive cyrillic is mostly reworked greek , so no surprise about this one . 
  in my local shoppe there are 2 types of baguettes : classic ( vanilla , lol , dunno , how it 's called , just bread ) and the onionish one . 
  both cost ~ 80 cents for ~ 250-300 gramms of baguette .
