  serious lack of omelette du fromage btw ^ hon-hon-hon, 
  but we can afford bread, 
  i wish we could ban modern russian films in russia, 
  wait , is this `` half of income spent on food '' , or `` half of total russian money spent were spent on food '', 
  well , you are right !, 
  you probably had so little luck with american crops , that you could think they grow on top of thousands of indian graveyards !, 
  third, 
   avatar project more like greenscreen, 
  well , that 's a great idea ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ show, 
  i guess it would be , like , really interesting . 
  basically , you have to remember the sex of the noun and whether it 's singular or plural . 
  also affixes . 
  however , you can feel free to use infinitives if you will do this with that lovely finnish accent !, 
  gogol 's `` evenings on a farm near dikanka '' fragment called `` christmas eve '' , where local blacksmith vakula comes for an advice about his love to puzaty patsuk ( huge belly patsuk ? 
  ) , who is believed to have connections with the devil , and sees him eating vareniky like that , with his mind alone . 
  damn our classics are good . 
  ah , the ol' reddit [ commie-a-roo ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/43tfjc/whats_the_dumbest_thing_youve_ever_spent_money_on/czlxyvt?context=2 ) !, 
  not sure about ukraine , but in russia it depends on pre-epidemic researches and prediciton of flu type . 
  if ( ministry of health ? ), 
  agency in charge of it predicts wrong strain and makes a vac for it , it wo n't help at all . 
  something something cain killed abel humanity explain please, 
  welcome to the club , folks, 
  come on , if they do n't see us being bots , we are probably doing some really good work , comrade, 
  `` how to earn clay in 3 simple steps by our specialist !, 
  finns hate him ! '', 
  but it 's not even orthodox christmas, 
  so that 's who is responsible for that 8 degrees above zero temperature like 2 weeks before the new year . 
  thanks , vladimir !, 
  new year  old new year  christmas but it depends on how religious your family is . 
  sometimes christmas is more important than old new year , but the new year is always top celebration . 
  i think , victory day is just as popular as new year , yet we have longer holidays on the latter , so it 's longer . 
  also much happier , victory day is more of `` happiness with eyes full of tears '' - translating the `` victory day '' song . 
  keep me informed , please . 
  i would be grateful if you bumped this comment with link to your aar after you finished it . 
  wow , thanks a lot , man . 
  really showed those austrians who is the boss . 
  players , please , bring us glorious tales about the round from your point of view . 
  like in [ boatmurdered of dwarf fortress ] ( http://lparchive.org/dwarf-fortress-boatmurdered/ ) . 
  i like the way sergei dovlatov told about that in `` the suitcase '' novel . 
  `` here , i 'd like to digress . 
  i am convinced that almost all spies behave incorrectly . 
  for some reason they hide , lie , pretend to be ordinary soviet citizens . 
  the very mysteriousness of their activities is suspicious . 
  they should behave much more simply . 
  first of all , they should dress as flashily as possible . 
  that instils respect . 
  secondly , they should n't hide thier foreign accent . 
  that instils sympathy . 
  and morst importantly , they should act as unceremoniously as possible . 
  say a spy is interested in a new ballistic missile . 
  he meets a famous rocketry man at the theatre . 
  he invites him for dinner . 
  it 's stupid to offer the man money . 
  he would n't have enough . 
  it 's stupid to try to work the man over ideologically . 
  he knows all that without anyone 's help . 
  he has to use a completely different tactic . 
  they should drink . 
  then he puts his arm around the man 's shoulders . 
  pats him on the knee and says , `` so , how 's it going , old man ? 
  i hear you 've invented something new . 
  why do n't you scribble down a couple of formulas for me on this napkin , just for fun ? ... '', 
  that 's it . 
  the missile 's as good as in his pocket . '', 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-cjfsr95rm ) is already pretty good , actually . 
  thanks , now that 's what i call a nice response . 
  but are n't almost every choosings , from local things to presidental election , usually use ready-made arguments and emotional appeals ? 
  the topic is quite hard and complex , yes , but i think it 's nearly impossible to force someone use logic instead of feelings . 
  that 's still part of democracy - to let everyone , from the professional sociologists to some local rednecks , vote . 
  there are n't many sociologists , tho . 
  ^ ^ ^ well ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ care ^ ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ downvotes ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ much hello , guys , i 've got a russian flair and i strongly disagree with aforementioned topic . 
  the referendum initiative is not cool if you have to collect signs to hold it . 
  whoever will be participating in it , it will be either non-definitive to eu ( only ukraine participating in referendum ) , not realistic ( non-eu countries voting as well as eu ones ) or even not legible ( eu referendum about ukraine without ukraine participating ) . 
  if it will be only holland-wide referendum , then , i fear , it wo n't achieve much , as holland can not into eu control . 
  if it will be eu countries + ukraine , then ukraine votes will be incredibly minor among all votes . 
  if it will be eu countries percentages and ukraine percentages , then it 's gon na be pretty bad ( opinions difference ) in all cases , except both units vote on nearly same level `` for '' , which i ca n't quite predict . 
  the idea looks adventurous , yet not quite helpful . 
  ^ ^ ^ there , ^ ^ ^ now ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ gon na ^ ^ ^ upvote ^ ^ ^ your ^ ^ ^ comment . 
  now we need less strict laws to oppose the use of not encripted communications / s, 
  i 'm actually sad there is no irish rockall on the map . 
  damn that krampus is metal . 
  if there are , i have n't heard about them , so , it either does n't exist or is n't popular enough for wide range of people to know . 
  you find word `` homo '' offensive ? 
  you are literally oppressing and raping the multi-gender quazi-personal dragonkin society . 
  got ta write about that on my tumblr , probably . 
  i might be mistaking , but i guess , the reasons about that could be both poverty spreading in 90s , which has ended as a financial default in 1998 , leading to criminal growth spreading drugs , as well as inability to buy sterile needles or drugs more expensive than `` krokodile '' by common junkies . 
  also sexual revolution hit russia in 80s-90s , and , as i already stated , we never had good contraception popularisation projects . 
  i guess , people really * fucked up * with it . 
  ^ ^ yeah ^ ^ sure ^ ^ getting ^ ^ out ^ ^ already, 
  yup . 
  also lack of contraception or mother 's treatment during pregnancy . 
  while we have resources and solutions for both of those problems ( not for the heroine , tho , iv used drugs are still huge ) , they are not popularised enough , and hiv-infected people prefer to `` lay down '' and tell noone that they are ill , possibly infecting others . 
  nah , not really . 
  and we have far more hiv-infected people , than homos . 
  also , while there are multiple points of view on gays in russia , we all consider hiv a danger for society , and agree that we should better stop it . 
  so , i guess , hiv problem in russia  gay problem in russia . 
  ^ ^ ^ shhhh , ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ here ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ drama, 
  so much this . 
  it should be , i believe , do whatever you want , just do it without shoving it into the people 's throats . 
  and then there is some shit like `` you do n't want to see me acting for public doing some weird shit ?
