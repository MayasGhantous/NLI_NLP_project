  was fascinated in childhood by his fate . 
  and as whole i am glad that russia still support space industry even though many complains on its high cost . 
  could you share some of polish music , please ? 
  would love to listen, 
  i like your selection, 
  by looking on street fashion in russia i would say we are all patriots of britain :p because of popularity of british flags on clothing , bags , even shoes and furniture . 
  ** i am ashamed of : ** 1 ) government and its actions . 
  dumb politicans . 
  2 ) nationalists , homophobes and racists 3 ) vatnics . 
  here goes all very close-minded people - soviet lovers , putin 's fans , justifiers of everything bad , haters of west etc. 
  4 ) fake liberals/oppositioners that only hate the country instead of to make it better as it supposed them to do . 
  5 ) lack of efforts to develop regions 6 ) though my family also was victim of it , i am ashamed of all atrocities made in time of ussr - katyn massacre , occupation of poland and baltic countries , crimes and rape by soviet soldiers , deportations of people in gulag etc. 
  ** i am proud of : ** 1 ) its great power in the past ( from rus to russian empire ) and maybe partially now . 
  i just wish our country just would take the right course to stay on geopolitical arena . 
  2 ) people . 
  they are kind hearted despite sometimes looking otherwise . 
  3 ) culture . 
  writers , compositors , artists , scientists , dancers , sportsmen etc. 
  4 ) freedom . 
  yes , i know it sounds strange , but really . 
  not because country stands for it but rather the lack of desire to follow laws by people and ability to control everything precisely by control organs . 
  what an inappropriate gesture . 
  this group is redneck-like people from small town pretty nearby ukrainian border . 
  total lack of adequacy, 
   their homes and their villages are being razed into ashes i do n't think that it is relevant to what is happening in ukraine . 
  i am sorry , but your comment looks like you feel some kind of happy revenge feeling and schadenfreude toward ordinary people 's tragedy that has nothing to do with politics . 
  musical taste it is so individually , ca n't even decide what would be appropriate to recommend . 
  so i just post few examples , i like myself .

  if you consider russian european cities such as moscow , saint petesburg , kaliningrad , ekaterinburg etc then : 1 . 
  weather are pretty similar with europe , despite myths there is no too much cold winters . 
  in the capital cities ( or oblast centers ) it is okay . 
  if you do n't walk at night in criminal neighborhoods you will be just fine . 
  due to international political crisis situation in russia is getting pretty harsh about cost of living . 
  but to a person with decent salary it is not much noticeable . 
  depends on your skills . 
  usually big cities offer a lot of various jobs . 
  i am sorry but your questions seems a bit is too vague , if you are interested in something more specifical feel free to ask more . 
   compared to western countries where did you see in comment any kind of comparison or statement that russia is on top or something ? 
  there were no word about us or eu but you still come with your `` whataboutism '' . 
  what do you mean ? 
  my condolences . 
  i believe we should pay reparation for this crime and learn it in more detailed way in our schools . 
  we ca n't fix what was done but we can accept responsibility and try ask for forgiveness . 
   not normally known for philanthropy did this . 
  i am sorry i do n't want to say that russia is white and fluffy but some things maybe should be noted . 
  when the flood happened in serbia and bosnia in 2014 russian rescuers worked in serbia from 16 to 26 may . 
  russia evacuated about 3,000 people , including over 600 children . 
  three aircraft russian emergencies ministry il-76 delivered more than 105 tons of humanitarian aid to residents of serbia , and 40 tons were delivered to banja luka ( bosnia and herzegovina ) . 
  in addition , to participate in rescue work in the areas of flood came two multi-purpose helicopter ka-32 russian emergencies ministry . 
  as for the epidemic of ebola , russia has financed the purchase of medical modules with drugs in guinea , benin and sierra leone , which allow to help about 60 thousand people . 
  from the very beginning of the epidemic in africa has a team of russian doctors with russian mobile virology laboratory . 
  russia also allocated $ 19 million to fight the outbreak in west africa . 
  when south korean fishing trawler `` orion-501 '' sank in the bering sea , russia organised the search and rescue of survivors with naval aircraft tu-142 and ships . 
  after the 2004 tsunami in indonesia , russia has deployed a field hospital with a team of doctors . 
  2,400 residents received medical assistance , in 2171 the child was vaccinated . 
  later , the hospital was donated to indonesia . 
  russian rescue team has also worked in the affected province of aceh . 
  for many years , russia is an active participant in reconstruction in gaza . 
  it pays for training of palestinian civilians , sends doctors and humanitarian aid . 
  also contribute business and individuals . 
  thus , the russian muslims all over the country gather to residents of gaza . 
  russian foundation `` solidarity '' regularly organizes humanitarian missions . 
  in the philippines affected by supertyphoon `` haiyang '' in 2013 , russia sent two planes with doctors , rescuers and psychologists . 
  also mobile hospital , which in a short time in the field turns into a multi-hospital , where it is possible to carry out even the most complex surgeries . 
  in addition , russia provided loans to iceland , cyprus , tajikistan , kyrgyzstan , armenia , belarus , ethiopia , zambia , mozambique , laos . 
  since 2000 , russia has forgiven and written off more than $ 140 billion debt to cuba , iran , vietnam , african countries , algeria and ethiopia . 
  i brought up only part of the examples , in the past year russia provided humanitarian assistance more than 22 countries , basically russia always react reacts when there is disaster or catastrophe in another countries . 
  yes of course , i agree with you , the whole system was build on it . 
  i just mean that maybe that we as a people also should carry responsibility of this . 
  i have serious doubt of the poll , because yes i see sometimes people in social networks justify stalin and even put his picture as a profile but in real life i know nobody who would think good of him , i rather have impression that only in small group his personality would be popular . 
  anyway it is sad outcome . 
  one of my great-grandfather [ was sent to gulag ] ( http://nekropole.info/ru/grigorij-ivaneko ) for `` anti-soviet propaganda '' while i know they just were wealthy family that do n't even tried to get involved in politics . 
  it was common in those times - people wrote denunciations on their neighbors just for jealousy or revenge . 
  but someone wrote those denunciations and you know i think it is people 's nature because i see today the same - in ukraine people write denunciations and call police ( sbu ) on any who could show any sympathy toward russia , in russia `` vatnics '' write denunciations on liberals and pro-ukrainian people . 
  hell even here in this subreddit people claim anyone who have different point of view as a putinbots and shills and i am sure if they could they would send them in the custody . 
  unfortunately the level of hatred makes people to lose their sanity and they do not hesitate to pursue their opponents just because they think they are on right side . 
  true, 
  sure , especially some nazi elements . 
  but you know here is popular saying `` yes , they jews but they are ours jews '', 
  my husband is 5 generation american of german ethnicity from both of his parental lines ( because of mass immigration in past centuries created big german communities ) . 
  we learnt records of their departures , tracked the routes his ancestors made and discovered so many beautiful places . 
  so we dream when getting old to move there maybe , to buy small cute house somewhere in bavaria , to grow garden with flowers and some veggies . 
  despite polls many people do n't like him , they might support some of his politics but it does n't mean they support him . 
  depends on social group - it could be kgb ( fsb ) , putin , obama , usa , muslims , immigrants . 
  and yet it get quite radical side : if they hate something - they hate it with passion reaching absurd level , if they love it - it grows to worship and admiration advocating everything . 
  that creates a huge abyss between people of country . 
  there is no balance, 
  it is edgy, 
  geopolitically eu would be better to have its own military branch to less its dependency on usa . 
  but for now seems nato it is only option, 
  so if about to liberate concentration camps , to fight with nazi - it all along were ukrainians , armenians , azerbaijanians , tajics , moldovanians etc. 
  ( because of argument `` soviet army was multinational '' ) , but as about robbing and rape it were only russians ? 
  how convenient, 
  and fascinating at the same time, 
  that is embarrassing . 
  you have read too much political news . 
  try to live your own life , raise kids , go to work , travel , enjoy tasty food , spend time with friends . 
  the internet creates an illusion of real life but it is not , it only makes you paranoid .
