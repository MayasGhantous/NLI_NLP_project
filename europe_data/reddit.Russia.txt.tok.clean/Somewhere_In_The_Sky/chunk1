  * russia bans the internet archive 's ` wayback machine ' [ global voices ] ( http://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/06/25/russia-bans-the-internet-archives-wayback-machine/# ) * the clarification is below * [ post written by mr.prayer ] ( https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/06/wayback-machines-485-billion-web-pages-blocked-by-russian-government-order/?comments=1&amp;post=29279695 )  if i may , i 'll just repost my comment on hardforum verbatim . 
   just to clarify some things :  1 ) archive.org was cooperating with russia before . 
  meaning , it either deleted `` offensive '' pages or restricted access to them from russian ips . 
  https://antizapret.info/index.php?search=archive.org  2 ) i 'm not seeing any `` solitary jihad in russia '' references in the blacklist , but the latest entry available ( from yesterday , july 25th , [ http://web.archive.org/web/201506181109 ... erritoriy / ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20150618110931/http:/ozpp.ru/pamyatka-potrebitelyam-pri-poseschenii-okkupirovannyh-territoriy/ ) is already restricted ( this url has been excluded from the wayback machine ) . 
   3 ) * archive itself is working just fine for me now . 
  * [ emphasis added ] although it could change , but seeing their cooperation , i do n't think so . 
   4 ) this blacklist is not a lifetime ban . 
  if you missed the deadline to restrict access to content and got banned , you will be removed from the list as soon as you 'll do it . 
   all in all , i think internet archive will be fine in russia . 
  at least for some time . 
   ps : i 'm not trying to convince you that this blacklist idea is good . 
  i 'm not an idiot to think that .

  here is the [ putin 's secret ] ( http://www.vox.com/2015/6/17/8796659/vladimir-putin-shirtless-video ), 
  honestly i do n't know the answer . 
  some say it helps to make flats more soundproof . 
  others think rugs help to keep the rooms warm as russian winters are cold . 
  also i heard rugs make flats cozy . 
  a rug is certainly better than a cold wall . 
  this topic is discussed from time to time and there are different theories . 
  i do n't think this custom is common . 
  personally i 've never encountered it . 
  the article is quite accurate . 
  but this part is debatable . 
  do n't worry too much about it . 
  the symbols of power play an important role in modern russia . 
  some people do n't have enough money to buy gas , yet they drive expensive german cars just to show that they are not poor in russia . 
  it 's a cultural thing . 
  edit : typo, 
  a wealthy parents ? 
  of course russia is not the safest country in the world but i would n't say it 's that dangerous . 
  for instance the centre of moscow has a very high number of cctv cameras . 
  i usually come home late ( 11pm-12am ) and i 've never been robbed . 
  just do n't forget about general safety precautions like in any other big city . 
  pushkin  `` of course i despise my fatherland from head to toe - but i 'm annoyed when a foreigner shares this feeling with me '' .

  [ ten things never to say or do in russia ] ( http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/ten-things-never-to-say-or-do-in-russia.html ), 
   could you maybe recommend me like the best most neutral russian newspaper ? 
  unfortunately such newspaper is n't easy to find . 
  some countries like canada , finland , norway , sweden have a good world press freedom index but they do n't write much about the current events in russia . 
   or just your favorite one ? 
  besides mentioned newspapers i might say it 's [ meduza ] ( https://meduza.io/en ) - riga - based online newspaper . 
  the problem is russian news media is either pro-kremlin like [ rt ] ( http://rt.com/ ) / [ sputnik ] ( http://sputniknews.com/ ) or anti-kremlin like [ meduza ] ( https://meduza.io/en ) . 
  last but not least , back in 2008 a journalist kunher wrote an article in the washington times . 
  [ kuhner : will russia-ukraine be europe 's next war ? 
  ] ( http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/oct/12/europes-next-war/print/ ) i ca n't say i read the washington times but he accurately predicted how the ukrainian conflict will unfold . 
  that 's impressive . 
  edit : and as it was mentioned kommersant and vedomosti ( in russian ) . 
   do you consider the sources you cited legit unbiased sources in regards to russia ? 
  no , of course they are not . 
   i would have thought the moscow times , the new york times , the guardian etc were n't too popular with russians yes , that 's correct . 
  english is not widespread in russia . 
  that 's why most russians prefer to stick to runet ( russian-language community on the internet ) . 
   would get dismissed if i were to quote them in a debate . 
  or will russians accept these as legit information ? 
  it depends . 
  some educated russians do not like how the things are going in modern russia . 
  i do n't think these russians would dismiss these newspapers . 
  on the other hand there are a lot of people who would say it 's all western propaganda against russia .

  i 'd say yes .
