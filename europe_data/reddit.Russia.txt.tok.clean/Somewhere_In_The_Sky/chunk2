  as far as i can tell , yes . 
   u.s. 
  ambassador samantha power cited twitter announcements by separatist fighters boasting of a successful attack on marinka , ukraine . 
  she said russia continues to deny the `` open secret '' that it arms the rebels and sends russian soldiers to die anonymously in neighboring ukraine . 
  [ reuters ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/05/us-ukraine-crisis-un-iduskbn0ol1nw20150605 ), 
  it should be mentioned there was a consumer panic back in december ( people rushed to buy tvs , computers , cars etc. ) . 
  they thought it was too late to exchange rubles to dollars so they simply spent all the money they could . 
  correct if i 'm mistaken but i think things will get really bad when russia depletes its reserve fund ( it does n't seem like oil prices will change or the western sanctions will be lifted in foreseeable future ) . 
   they would n't 've done it if the attitude had n't been positive . 
  as i said `` i may be wrong on this one . '', 
  certainly i was wrong . 
  my bad . 
  for some reason i did n't even know that there were joint us-russia military drills just three-four years ago . 
  not mentioning the economic cooperation and visas changes . 
  all i remember is russo-georgian war 2008 and talks about new cold war . 
  thank you for the correction too  i guess it 's just my perception bias . 
   so putin wins ? 
  it looks like he was supporting the war in the east , making noise and threats just to force the west into accepting crimea 's annexation yes . 
  there is a good comment by davidt08 in [ ft article ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/de393bf0-f7ec-11e4-8bd5-00144feab7de.html#axzz3bhx6hfp9 )  the fact is that in the last six months putin has n't gone anywhere ( apart from minsk or yerevan ... ) yet hollande went to see him at least twice , merkel at least twice , americans at least once ... they are all going to see him and not vice versa ... what is this telling us ? 
  thanks for the correction  [ abby lingvo ] ( http://www.lingvo-online.ru/en/translate/ru-en/%d0%be%d0%b1%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%86%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b5 ) gives both translations . 
  i should keep in mind those words have different meanings . 
   what is the economic situation like in russia at the moment ? 
  comparing to the end of the last year the economic situation is stable now . 
  the ruble devaluation stopped ( 1 us dollar = 52.34 russian rubles ) . 
  i remember some experts predicted that the us dollar will cost 200/300 rubles by the spring . 
  those predictions turned out to be not true . 
  the prices for imported goods are still high . 
  and because of russian import ban even some local food became more expensive . 
  overall i would n't say people are starving or dying without the latest iphone . 
  though i 'd like to note that in some places the situation is quite difficult . 
  there is a production facility tsskb-progress in the city of samara ( it 's the place where those progress rockets are assembled . ), 
  they cut down the expenses and as a result some workers were fired . 
  one worker apparently had a nervous breakdown and killed a woman who worked in hr department [ source ] ( http://progorodsamara.ru/news/view/175008 ) ( in russian ) . 
  it 's not easy to find a work if you are in your mid 50s - 60s in russia . 
  and it does n't help that pensions are low . 
  in other words the situation is definitely not good as used to be a year ago . 
   any news on unemployment or gdp or the small climb in oil prices ? 
  state development bank [ veb reports ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/worst-not-over-for-russia-as-economy-shrinks-43-in-april/522476.html ) decline in gross domestic product accelerated to 4.3 percent year-on-year . 
  for now russia relies on its reserve fund . 
  it 's estimated that [ reserve fund will be depleted in 2017 ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/russia-budget-crunch-shows-no-quick-end-to-economic-pain/521929.html ) . 
   do people blame the sanctions for any problems ? 
  as i mentioned the prices remain high and a lot of people are irritated . 
  judging by my observation people do not blame sanctions but the usa/west ( if that makes sense ) . 
  there has never been a positive attitude towards the united states in russia . 
  although i communicate with very few people here in russia so i may be wrong on this one .

  the wages are low . 
  a lot of young , educated specialist have no desire to work there . 
  older soviet engineers ca n't work forever either . 
  plus russia is still using soviet-made space rockets . 
  it 's 2015 . 
  we should develop new space-launch vehicles but we have nothing except angara which has been in development since 1992 and the first launch took place only in 2014 . 
  personally , i think things will get only worse .

  well yes . 
  first of all , the channel zvezda quite often broadcasts old soviet movies . 
  for instance , the wife of my father likes to watch them . 
  second , there are a lot of historical programmes ( wwii ) and programmes about military tanks , ships , planes etc. 
  i myself sometimes watch them . 
  it 's something like discovery channel . 
  of course i know zvezda is not as popular as channel one or ntv . 
  still i 'm sure there are people who watch this channel . 
  anyway , i do n't have any statistics maybe i 'm wrong and only very few people watch zvezda . 
  edit : grammar, 
  last month zvezda ( russian nationwide tv network run by the russian ministry of defence ) reported :  the us military has raped two children in kyiv  network edition `` russian power '' tells of the monstrous incident in kyiv : four american soldiers raped two girls . 
   `` one of them had already turned thirteen , the second - not yet . 
  two of the criminals , pedophiles - employees of private military companies , the other two - of the us army . 
  the latter belong to the personal staff of lieutenant general hodges in wiesbaden , '' - said the publication .

   this chip is notoriously known for its never-ending way to production . 
  no-no . 
  i posted the article because it gave me an impression that there will be no more elbrus cpus . 
  i thought since they started working for intel , who is going to continue the development of elbrus ? 
  i was pleasantly surprised that there are still people who are working on elbrus . 
  agree . 
  the release of elbrus reminds me of the [ igromania article ] ( http://www.igromania.ru/articles/48158/pokorenie_vysot_po-russki_istoriya_processora_yelbrus-2000.htm ) which i read back in 2006 .
