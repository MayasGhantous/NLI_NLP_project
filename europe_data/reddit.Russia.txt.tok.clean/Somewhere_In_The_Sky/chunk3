  that 's according to reports on may 9 in russian publication ` novaya gazeta ' . 
  the author quotes the chechen strongman as saying the girl 's parents did not object to the marriage ; that being , despite bigamy being prohibited under russian law and kadyrov 's own prohibition on marriage under 18 . 
  on april 30 , newspaper ` novaya gazeta ' claimed that 57-year-old police chief nazhud guchigov would force schoolgirl kheda goylabiyeva into marriage . 
  the official supposedly threatened the family and promised she would become his wife on may 2 . 
  he also allegedly established checkpoints on the borders of the girl 's town to prevent any escape . 
  in response , guchigov denied the accusations , claiming that he was already happily married . 
  according to ` novaya gazeta ' the marriage will take place on may 10 and kadyrov will be one of the guests . 
  he has previously spoken in favour of allowing bigamy in chechen republic .

  a few years ago a russian designer and blogger tema lebedev made several trips to siberian regions .

  it should be noted that we had direct elections for governors but putin abolished them in 2004 . 
   the current constitution of russia does not regulate the procedure for election of heads of regions and mayors . 
  direct elections of governors were held in the regions of russia from 1996 until 2004 , when they were abolished . 
  a federal law restoring direct elections in a curtailed form ( with the municipal filters ) was passed only in 2012 . 
  [ the `` filter '' is the requirement to gather a requisite number of signatures of existing deputies in order to get on the ballot - ed . ] . 
  in many russian cities , there exists the post of appointed city manager , which was introduced in 2006 . 
  in some cases , the introduction of this post was accompanied by abolishing of the post of mayor . 
   [ the intepreter ] ( http://www.interpretermag.com/russia-to-abolish-mayoral-and-city-duma-elections/ ) and as far as i know two years ago putin signed into law a measure that allows governors to be appointed in the country 's 83 regions .

   2 ) people made sad jokes `` maybe it 's cheaper to buy petrol on ebay and ship it from the united states or china '' . 
  excuse me but can you elaborate please ? 
   petrol in norway is three times as expensive as it is in russia , for example . 
  25.000 - 35.000 rubles per month is a good salary for many people in russia especially if you are not talking about moscow or st. petersburg . 
  what about norway ? 
  everything is getting more expensive .
