  yeah , let 's find people without swastika tattoos to do that . 
  from the standpoint of most people i think . 
  they jump through mental hoops to somehow justify it . 
  idiots . 
  800 nazis showed up this year ? 
  went down a lot huh . 
  but some think half of the world 's nazis live in russia . 
  reduction of animosity and increased cooperation between russia and usa can only be good for this world . 
  i am cautiously optimistic . 
  i hope he works to reestablish cooperation with russia . 
  our bad guys are normally russians too lol . 
  like russian criminal masterminds are the bad guys and the police/young people fighting injustice/ex soldiers using their skills to defend innocents are the good guys . 
  yea , i found that weird . 
  all official releases in russia are dubbed today . 
  the voice over with one guy doing the voices is a 90s thing , member terminator 2 ? 
  in saying that , there is a large pirate scene who do their own translations of tv shows before they are officially released . 
  kiselev is a meme in russia , which is literally used when conspiracy theories are being discussed . 
  putin says the remark was stupid = evil putin . 
  putin says the remark was awesome = evil putin . 
  putin does n't say anything = evil putin . 
  putin just ca n't catch a break . 
  i 'm not sure , make an appeal using the `` message the moderators '' option . 
  inside of course !, 
  why would an under 18 buy it if they can just buy beer , 
  i 'm still alive , only i 'm very badly burnt . 
  what if they support some things and not others ? 
  big country , lots of opinions . 
  some you may not agree with , but the people wo n't be disrespectful about it . 
  i do n't know if he was or was n't , but all we have is his word . 
  a number of his accomplices were there , beliy for example . 
  relax bro , i was just asking a question , not making a statement . 
  i do n't know much about these guys . 
  are you trying to be edgy ? 
  comes off as childish imho . 
  i ban maybe 1 person a month if that . 
  was he a member of una-unso in chechnya with yarosh or has that been fabricated ? 
  whole of russia , or just russian government ? 
  well , because the fake document seems to be assisting ukrainian government , so you would think they would use it to their advantage . 
  unless this is a solo mission by gerashenko which they consider too idiotic . 
  to be fair , the article concentrates on some fringe individuals . 
  the young russian guys questioned seem reasonable too . 
  actually , a lot of russians go on holidays to montenegro : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montenegro%e2%80%93russia_relations#tourism, 
  yes , it seems that way . 
  but it has worked , the two combined created `` hacked : putin aide 's emails detail alleged plot to destabilize ukraine '' . 
  i 'm not surprised that so many ukrainian people have seen through the farce , but i 'm surprised that even some ukrainian politicians and analysts have voiced their disbelief . 
  believe me , no one has more animosity towards russia than central asia . 
  i like how you think , \u041f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0430 . 
  they are donating ambulances , not artillery . 
  here 's sharij 's video with english subs debunking the scans about `` destabilising ukraine '' : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxhqpbtbd_4, 
  do you think they are mixing a little bit of incriminating fakes into a largely uninteresting reality ? 
  well , before the war , i 'd probably agree , but you would struggle to find someone in donetsk today who still likes ukraine . 
  you said referendum in disputed areas , not the whole country which disputes their independence . 
  results would be pro russian . 
  thing is , russia does not want those areas for reasons we can only guess at , those areas have appealed to be joined to russia in the past , but nothing was done . 
  certain people ca n't afford to hold referendums like that . 
  despite what they put out on the news , they know exactly what results those referendums will yield , 
  south ossetia and georgia conflict predates putin : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991%e2%80%9392_south_ossetia_war, 
  yeah , whoever picked the movies has a very good taste . 
   long it 's actually 2 trailers back to back in one video . 
  first one just has action cuts , second reveals some story . 
  check this out , they have an amazing collection , everything they have is worth watching : http://sovietmoviesonline.com/en/ and it has some post soviet , even modern movies too there . 
  i love that film so much . 
  i think balabanov was inspired by guy ritchie . 
  yup , exactly . 
  yeah , that could be a factor too . 
  but the word viking is more commonly used in russian too , some people who have no interest in history could not even know what varyag means . 
  yeah , that was unnecessary long and tedious , but i enjoyed parts of it . 
  old slavonic is pretty different . 
  you can catch some words , but it 's almost like a foreign language . 
  hard to read too . 
  church workers still use it . 
  agreed , subs are the way to go . 
  i like hearing the actor 's voice , the emotion , and the original language . 
  much more immersive that way , even if you have to read . 
  it 's not a bad movie , but it 's also not a very good movie . 
  cinematography was great , that really impressed me . 
  it 's funny , so often with russian movies , the most hyped up ones turn out pretty average , and the gems fly under the radar . 
  for example , a movie called [ `` fool '' ] ( https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/808639/ ) also came out in 2014 , with a similar subject matter , corrupt officials , struggle of the little guy etc. 
  and it was a great movie , but it had little exposure , although it did develop a cult fandom , largely through word of mouth and internet . 
  only about those which have promise hehe . 
  also , because i love historical movies , it 's really sad when they turn out bad . 
  we are saying `` please do n't be shit , please do n't be shit , please do n't be shit '' . 
  kozlovsky is a great actor , hopefully the whole film will be great too . 
  yeah , a lot of people questioned that . 
  i guess the word viking is more modern and more commonly used , so they went with viking for pr reasons . 
  foreign agents do not get banned . 
  they just have to disclose that they are a foreign agent . 
  omg , really , i pointed out a historical myth and suddenly i hate democracy ? 
  how about we just put biases aside and remain objective , that would do a world of good for this planet . 
  come on , do n't repeat the `` polish death camp '' propaganda : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22polish_death_camp%22_controversy#operations_to_whitewash_german_responsibility_for_wwii, 
  she is well known in russia , her name is like a synonym for oracle . 
  you can say '' \u0432\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0443\u044e '' ( vanguyu ) which would mean `` i 'm predicting '' , kinda a slang word . 
  there was a recent russian tv series about her : https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/698579/, 
  you may find this interesting : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third_rome#russian_claims, 
  why are you suggesting syria 's use of barrel bombs amounts to a russian war crime ? 
  how can you exclude war deaths , hitler started the war against us , if he did n't attack , we would not have lost the people ? 
  these are definitely in hitler 's tally . 
  ussr attacking other countries does not really magically excuse hitler 's attack on us . 
  we 're not counting soviet soldiers who died fighting finland/poland/others as hitler 's killings , obviously . 
  but you can 's just say , hey , disregard 27 million deaths caused by hitler because ussr attacked poland .
