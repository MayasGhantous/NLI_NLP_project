such is the russian mentality are you judging the whole nation just by one girl 's opinion ? 
  really ? 
  not just near border but i was in kiev , ukraine and saw no diffrence at all with my city located far from the border . 
  the same people , surroundings , culture . 
  you really could not distinguish ukrainian from russian . 
  i went with 2 my american friends they have similar opinion . 
  they are n't conscripts , they signed contract by their own will . 
  did anyone actually read the link ? 
  would not eat it raw but cured salmon is totally my weakness . 
  in russia we have a lot of ukrainian , latvian , armenian and moldovanian celebrities - singers , actors , comedians etc. 
  i would even say half of showbusiness are from there . 
  most of them acquire russian citizenship in the process . 
  you guys went totally crazy with your hatred . 
  i guess soon there will no left any russian on this subreddit despite how much it would be liberal and pro-european person . 
  why you attack me with that ? 
  where in my initial comment you saw any approval of such behaviour ? 
  i love germans , though i could also say they have killed half of my family , but i do n't generalize them unlike you do with us . 
   zombifying 90 % russian population that statement could come only from itself zombified person that believes all russians some crazy rednecks, 
  so silly , hope germans do n't take it too seriously, 
  i am still here , it works fine for me, 
  true , it needs repair . 
  well at least it is my own , and hope one day it will contribute to pruchase for my new good apartament, 
  haha , hi drive me crazy so far though when he sleeps he is an angel so i forgive him everything, 
  he waved his paw and said : `` hi , love you too , estie ! '', 
  i believe it is up to individuals decide which and what kitty they want and are willing to adopt and care many years . 
  i am not sure total complete disappearance of purebreed is an option, 
  sorry i dont live in luxury house, 
  do they feel connection with france ? 
  done  is there possibility to create own categories like here with subreddits ? 
  oy you are right , bunny . 
  yeah they look scary , just an example , it is common here to use animals nouns with added diminutive suffixes as endearment words . 
  what are yours ? 
  looks interesting , will try it, 
  lol :d will try to translate to what these words are more similar by meaning : \u041c\u0438\u043b\u044b\u0439 - nice , \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u043c\u044b\u0439 - beloved , \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0439 - darling , \u043c\u043e\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c - my joy , \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0430 - rabbit in diminutive form , \u043a\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043a - kitten , \u043c\u0430\u043b\u044b\u0448 - baby , \u0437\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0446\u0435 - little gold , \u0441\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044b\u0448\u043a\u043e - sun in diminituve form , \u0431\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043a - hippo in diminutive form . 
  it is very board in russian language , there are a lot of endearment words , basically can be any noun in diminutive form or nice meaning adjective . 
  well russian offensive insults go even further, 
  there is a full detalization of cities with exact timing , just scroll down a bit, 
  well that is what i talked about , there is tendency to exaggerate everything related with russia . 
   ones russia likes to cry about the most then from where did you get that ? 
  i would say that is how some media is trying to portray our attituide toward you , i did n't hear that estonia was much circulated in russian news . 
  main russian antagonist is usa . 
  and even latvia - only in context of `` what are russophobic '' in collective term pribaltica . 
  but there are bunch of jokes based on stereothype of estonian slowness % ), 
  serbia is adorable here , 
  as from nation that constantly gets a lot of bashing i feel exactly opposite , because of empathy . 
  hope greeks will find a way from this situation, 
  so are slavs ( poles , czechs , slovaks , serbs etc ) europeans or not ? 
  because majority of russia are slavic people that live mostly in european part of russia , while other land is cold and uninhabited, 
  i saw many times phrase here - something kind of `` if we all are under one umbrella we should bear all together '' in the sense if one country of eu would get trouble ( with aggression , sanctions etc ) so all should back it . 
  so why in greece case it is different ? 
  need to be together in sorrow and in joy , 
  oh those sweet neighborhood feuds . 
  got it , thanks, 
  how so ? 
  i thought we are neighbours with usa via alaska . 
  i would not say that mexica gets tons of benefits from usa still being such poor state with such rich neighbor, 
  in russian : yes = \u0414\u0430 , no = \u041d\u0435\u0442 , and as bonus do n't know = \u041d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e, 
  ukrainian and chechen , how ironic, 
  first what came in my mind it is kid 's song [ the forest raised a christmas tree ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfeiwc81fqu ) . 
  it was very popular on every new year in my childhood . 
   by ethnic russians . 
  it looks like it is [ not true ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yjmruka.jpg ) and in general all caucasus republics are very homogeneous , just simply because of its culture and way of life that very contradicts to windy russian lifestyle , ordinary russian would find those places too conservative and religous/islamist to move there . 
  actually dagestan is one of most `` pro-russian '' republic in russia among others muslim regions . 
  judging by their vk groups they all speak russian as a main language , it is something that make possible communication between various etnicites of caucasus . 
  15 seconds guys , 15 seconds , a moment . . 
  airspace is not a road with straight pathes , roadbeds and signs , it happens when one can just touch other 's space accidently , you knew there was war zone , so jets are flying for a reason . 
  you just killed both of pilots and you hail it . 
  i am not angry or anything i am just deeply frustrated by your reaction . 
  mostly true . 
  there are of course some differencies but they are very distinct and probably unheard of to foreigner 's ear . 
   `` eu national '' i think it is a bit different than european national . 
  eu = / = europe, 
  it is not russia decided first communism could be fun but germany, 
  they are actual . 
  i picked them up from various albums , time and cities . 
  well as a woman i would tend to disagree , in reality i believe problems in our men rather are more in their backward personality than in their appereance . 
  it is just selective perception plus more pics of girls than men on the internet, 
  would be so kind to elaborate ? 
  bad with english :(, 
  here are more : [ instagram of russian police ] ( https://instagram.com/russianpolice/ ) and [ vk ] ( http://vk.com/album-24732375_176961555 ) group, 
  probably need to mention that trend to hire young people and especially give places to women came not so long ago , after police reorganization in 2011 when a lot of old and incompetent employees were fired . 
  i know what are you taliing about , my greatmother was polish ( wierchowski last name ) , and my grandfather was a [ victim of stalin regime ] ( http://nekropole.info/en/person/view?id=1112422 ) . 
  so yes , i do believe russia should find ways try to compensate what it had done . 
  oh i am so sorry i mistook your flair for britain, 
  well you are one of the first in list who should pay reparations to others not recieve them  it is fate of any former empire, 
  i thought there is world practice of it how these reparation things work ? 
  i am not saying that it will cover all bad what was done but if we can find some solution i would be glad . 
  i know but for the katyn massacre, 
  i am actually all for it . 
  but the problem is if russia will agree to pay it the next day all ex-ussr counties will demand the same . 
  and while i would do support decision with reparations to countries such as estonia , latvia , poland and lithuania , but uzbekistan , tajikistan , kyrgyzstan and others in my opinion have no this right . 
  i would say unofficially it is anti-soviet celebration . 
  this holiday was introduced in order to replace the commemoration of the october revolution , known as the day of great october socialist revolution during soviet period , which formerly took place on november 7 . 
  this decision angered some sections of the public , particularly the communist party , who continued with celebrations on november 7 . 
  i love sleep naked, 
  if anyone wonder what [ russian army choir is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bybtazjb8qm ), 
  kind of weird to see these news after bunch of jokes `` russians tourists on vacation '' . 
  if i was some of haters of russia i could say that it is karma , but ca n't accept that innocents should die for their government . 
  my mom wanted travel to egypt in recent days but fortunately we delayed it . 
  why so rude ?
