very brave . 
  but what do you mean by `` had enough of their peasants here '' ? 
  in russian politics everything may happens . 
  but i doubt it is likely any time soon - too much is tied on putin in russia : army , police , regional chiefs . 
  it is rooted pretty deep . 
  i 'm sure , more opportunities for russian orphans to be adopted is always better . 
  no , this have nothing to do with laws of those countries . 
  just russian law prohibits adoption of russian children by any country that allows same sex marriages - because russian government thinks that those children may get into gay families somehow . 
  i just wonder , why do you think so ? 
  any examples of russian butthurtinism since the foundation of the russian empire ? 
  before that ? 
  every country that allows same sex marriages is banned from adoption russian children . 
  even opposite sex couples from this countries are not allowed to adopt russian children . 
  i do n't know whether russian gays use similar slang or not . 
  so , i assume that the association may not exist for those who is not familiar with gay slang . 
  it is old russian meme - [ piglet petr ] ( http://i.absurdopedia.net/thumb/f/f5/%d0%9f%d0%be%d1%80%d0%be%d1%81%d1%91%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%ba_%d0%9f%d1%91%d1%82%d1%80.jpg/250px-%d0%9f%d0%be%d1%80%d0%be%d1%81%d1%91%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%ba_%d0%9f%d1%91%d1%82%d1%80.jpg ) this picture usually posted with text : `` piglet petr is leaving fucking russia on fucking tractor '' . 
   it should be clear that there is no break between these rulers and viking rule i think , you ca n't say there was no break in ** viking ** rule - not everyone of scandinavian lineage is `` viking '' . 
  sure , there was no break of rulers of scandinavian lineage , but i 'm sure , eventually they lost their cultural ties to scandinavia , lost their cultural identity as scandinavian and became `` slavenized '' . 
  at what point of history they became `` slavenized '' is disputable , though . 
  yeah , a lot of disputes among those , for whom it really matters . 
  kievan rus covered a lot of territories of modern russia . 
  and i 'm sure , russia and ukraine is not only countries to share history this way . 
  hmmm , you know , there were mostly swamps in place of saint-petersburg before xvii century ? 
  how it can be of viking origin ? 
  oh , so it will be about [ vladimir the great ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_the_great ) . 
  so far , it looks promising . 
  strange , that they use word '' \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0433 '' ( viking ) and not '' \u0412\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0433 '' ( varangian ) in this movie - former is not used in rus chronicles , as far , as i know . 
   propagandists can try to score points by observing this oh , they will . 
  and they are . 
  i do n't think it is actually necessary . 
  how is it of any importance ? 
  i know , all europe ( and not only europe ) is with st. petersburg this days . 
  i feel solidarity . 
  we all are on a common ground . 
  why landmarks should be lit ? 
  what will it change ? 
  no need to show-off in your mourn and condolences . 
  i see what you did there ... 
  huh , i wish it will be so . 
  yeah , sure . 
  i heard a joke here : `` why ` jagged alliance ' video-game series was so popular in russia ? 
  because even then we liked to send mercenaries with funny nicknames to troubling countries . '', 
  my bet on that . 
  i guess , he means that swiss should n't be afraid to mess with russians , because :  switzerland has probably the most trained and the most armed population and  in russia , on the other side , alcohol is linked to some 35 % of cases where a man dies before age 55 so , swiss , likely , will handle any mess with russians with ease . 
  some day ... 
  it is one of dominant [ theories ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavs#ethnonym ) on word `` slav '' . 
  actually , attacker is seriously injured . 
  donetsk is held by ukrainian pro-russia separatists . 
  it is not really clear right now if russian militants is involved in this case . 
  after `` nudes of europe '' there should be `` nukes of europe '' . 
  i remember people on this subreddit talking about the west needs stable and successful russia ... 
  i get why this opinion changed , by the way, 
  completely agree . 
  i do n't want someone labeling what i read `` fake '' or `` truth '' for me . 
  i find it is very dangerous approach . 
  if you want me to belive your information - prove it to me !, 
  as comment above says - [ embrace downvotes !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5q8yhc/russia_is_targeting_french_dutch_and_german/dcxdca9/ ) i 'm sure your sense of humor is to subtle - even '' / s '' did n't help . 
  size that matters . 
  i never was abroad , but my sister was . 
  when she was in california , she met a lot of people and a lot told her : `` putin is a tough guy , we want our president to be something like him '' . 
  surprising , but true . 
  what do you mean by * `` that cold '' * ? 
  it 's -37 degrees celsius outside right now - it 's cold as hell . 
  the idea of moscow being the 3rd rome ( not the 4th , what were the first 3 you think about ? ), 
  was born long after the baptism of rus , allegedly somewhere in xvi century ( ~ 550 years after the baptism ) . 
  thanks , now that makes sense , my bad . 
  chekhov 's name is anton . 
  pavlovich is a patronymic . 
  i heard it is hard to find tuvan man without knife . 
  also , two of my colleagues are from tuvan republic . 
  they told me that there a lot of prisons and prison camps , so there a lot of prison influence on local society . 
  i do understand it . 
  but , i think , she chose probably only available way to save those children . 
  yeah , i meant , she helped where she was allowed to by kremlin . 
  you know , how i see it ? 
  dr. liza found children which in dire need for help in war-torn donbass , and only way to help them was transfer them either to russia or kiev . 
  armed separatists , which in charge in this area , only allowed her to transfer them to russia , so , to help them , she accepted it to save children lives . 
  so she saved lives of ukrainian children by breaking ukrainian ( and international ) law . 
  why do i think so ? 
  her reputation is rock solid in russia . 
  even those , who openly oppose kremlin regime praise her as almost saint . 
  i 'm sure , those people are very keen on debunk any crimes of kremlin or anyone affiliated to them . 
  and they never said anything bad about dr. liza , they praise her !, 
  thanks . 
  but it does n't give any info on how dr. liza was involved in this abductions . 
  i assume she was sincere . 
  she helped where she was allowed to help , but that does n't mean ( for me ) she should not provide this aid . 
  can you provide any reasonable source on this `` children trafficking '' accuse ? 
  did she really attend there to show how ukraine is all to blame ? 
  was it a clear message ? 
  because , personally , i did n't notice this message . 
  i think , she attended just to show how children suffer on this war . 
  she did n't show that russia is all to blame , also . 
  maybe this is your resentment ? 
   if you get an investment adviser and because of his terrible advise you lost all your money , would n't you at least partially blame him ? 
  good point , i will blame `` the west '' a little bit . 
   there is this new thing called `` government '' ... 
  right , i was a bit overemotional with my post . 
  but , certainly , we russians have to grow some `` civilian consciousness '' and not wait until some good guy solve our problems or tell us how to behave .
