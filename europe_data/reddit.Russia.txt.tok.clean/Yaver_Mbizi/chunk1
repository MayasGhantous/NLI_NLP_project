bad history . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_history_in_russia#lgbt_rights_following_the_revolution:_1917.e2.80.931933 tl ; dr - it was not the provisional government but the bolsheviks who legalised homosexuality ; it was not a cause for them to reverse that until stalin 's strengthening of the central power over the society . 
  also , the provisional government was pretty sane , if by `` sane '' you mean `` incompetent as fuck '' . 
  continuing the war with germany with virtually no army is sane to you ? 
  hahaha . 
  yeah man , all of those milliards of secular , democratic freedom-fighters . 
  they definitely were numerous , important , and would lead their country into a golden age ( as has been observed successfully in iraq , lybia etc ) . 
  in case people do n't get that you 're joking without the '' / s '' tag ( and you 're sorta subtle ) : iraq is currently in much the same state as syria ( the islamic state ) , and libya is in its own civil war with 4 + participants , one of them being isis . 
  talk about beneficial western intervention , right ? 
  haha , good one . 
  might want to mention yemen . 
  or afghanistan with their recent taliban prison break ... any intervention 's spot , really . 
   this plus maidan where the first real attempts at change in the ukraine in 24 years . 
  if this ( poroshenko 's rule ) is `` real change '' , why not file yushchenko as `` real change '' ? 
  he also was plenty pro-western . 
  actually , a better man , never shelled his country 's civilians on my memory . 
  either way , either it 's `` another '' in the long line of `` real changes '' or , being more honest , neither of them are anywhere close to any change , other than a change of the ruling clan of oligarchs . 
   and what happened when ukraine wanted to head more west than east ? 
  [ a relatively-small section of the ukrainian public , you mean ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euromaidan#public_opinion_about_joining_the_eu ), 
  it was pro-russian until the pro-russian president was overthrown ; hardly after ( attempting to repel minority language rights with the first new law is n't exactly pro-russian , is it ? 
  and that 's even without going into the whole `` bidding war '' thing . ), 
  for some reason russia only annexed crimea * after * yanukovich was chased out of the country , not before - so you ca n't blame him for that at all . 
  * look up ukraine 's trade and currency stats under him , and compare them with today 's government . 
  * also , notice how yanukovich at most used riot police , but the new gov shells [ or kills ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/32qpxy/ousted_ukraine_presidents_ally_found_shot_dead_in/cqe5hvx ) its dissidents , and is engaged in full-out civil war . 
  * also , notice how today far-right militias wander the country , execute vigilate justice and shoot the police in regions opposite of russian-bordering ones with weapons given to them by the government . 
  * also , what 's with the collapsed social payments and living standards ? 
  where are the promised reforms ? 
  what 's up with foreigners getting all the cushy jobs ? 
  why is an oligarch a president again ? . . 
  etc, 
  indeed , some more , some less . 
  for you it 's more , sadly . 
  i 'm pretty sure soviet latvia had way better social security and employment rates as well ... well , at least all of you are in your free paradise now . ), 
  edit : confusing wording . 
  it worked out better for the russia-friendly president ( yanukovich ) than the west-friendly one ( poroshenko et al ) . 
  more questions ? 
  [ much freedom , such prosperity , wow . 
  ] ( http://www.rebaltica.lv/en/investigations/the_other_side_of_latvias_success_story_/a/826/the_invisible_side_of_latvia%e2%80%99s_%e2%80%98success%e2%80%99_story_life_with_%e2%80%98god%e2%80%99s_mercy_and_the_goodness_of_others%e2%80%99.html ), 
  that 's rich from a guy whose state has already fallen apart and only goes further down the shithole ... 
  i do feel bad for you guys , though . 
  well , they are similar , except they have different scales and levels of escalation . 
  crimea was separated before the bloodshed , kosovo was n't . 
  the ukrainians are n't necessarily cleansing the population in donbass , and the deathtolls are smaller , but they still use violence to suppress people 's self-determination like it happened in serbia . 
  these situations have similarities in the same way an ied and a hydrogen bomb do . 
  does people 's self-determination only have validity when it 's backed by a lot of corpses and blood ? 
  if anything , bloodless separation is better , as long as the population is happy ( and it is ) . 
  ukraine was deciding for itself , until a non-representative mob overthrew a president , and then sent tanks and began shelling more people who wanted to decide for themselves . 
  a decision can either be pro-western or involuntary , it seems . 
  even ignoring that such comparisons make you an asshole 99 % of the time ... 
  such eagles are a symbol of nazi germany . 
  `` two random dudes standing '' is not a symbol of the ussr . 
  it 's apparently a symbol of learning . 
  they represent learning and farming , though . 
  you do n't destroy the soviet blocks of flats as `` relicts of occupation '' , why is it more permittable to destroy - well done - works of art ? 
  the only thing i can think of is that they 're `` unlithuanian in spirit '' or such silliness . 
  do tell me what they are , then . 
  they 're titled `` agriculture '' and `` youth of education '' . 
  do the names lie ? 
  what do they represent , then ? 
  the coldness of siberia and starvation respectively ? 
  did that guy hate learning , farming etc so much he had to be forced at gunpoint to glorify them in statue form ? 
  `` cursed soviets , they force me to make statues of , like , university-going pussies !, 
  my lithuanian pride is hurt !, 
  if i could construct statues of whatever i wanted i 'd do ... like ... 
  soldiers ? 
  except lithuanian ones , of course , not the blasted soviet ones ( the statues of which look exactly the same , i must unpatriotically admit ) ... maybe ... like ... pagan gods or some shit ? 
  yeah , that 'd be * soooo * lithuanian ! '', 
  [ also like that ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/r%c3%a9alisme_socialiste_%28vilnius%29_%287622118328%29.jpg ) [ and that ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/r%c3%a9alisme_socialiste_%28vilnius%29_%287622118888%29.jpg ) all made by lithuanian sculptors , mind you . 
  yeah , putin is a known telepath and it 's pretty routine for him to make a bunch of people oppose a government they 're in fact are absolutely happy with , and which has n't done anything at all to warrant any hostility from a half of its citizens . 
   thank you , but we dont nead more people like him . 
  i agree - who does ? 
  people who resort to violence in such a manner are very unlikable indeed . 
  i 'm not being sarcastic here . 
  yet when the same type of violent ukrainian idiots  brainwashed by your propaganda to the point of using violence were actually killing people , the western world was giving them all sorts of cheering on . 
  if you throw a molotov at a state representative in kiev - you 're a ~ ~ oligarchic ~ ~ democratic hero ; in prague - you 're a barbaric aggressor russian , who is also apparently reprersentative of all russians in general and also all the other ills in the world . 
  i ca n't help but notice a double standard here . 
   if this is a typical russian behaviour ? 
  causing physical harm on people who have different political view ? 
  what ? 
  that 's a pretty offensive thing to say . 
  what was the last time russians were causing each other physical harm because of their views ? 
  depending on how you look at it , either 1993 or the chechen wars . 
  if anything , it 's the ukrainian way , because they have a revolution every ten years , coupled with several obligatory political crises in between . 
  what was the last time russians were exchanging molotovs ? 
  and the ukrainians ? 
  i 'm very glad that this dangerous molotov-thrower has been caught before he did any damage . 
  imagine if he started riots of maidan 's scale , burning the police ( and/or innocent civilians ) alive , building catapults etc ? 
  that would be very unfortunate . 
   we are a very peaceful country with low crime , terrorism is unheard of , and i hope it stays like it for a long time . 
  same here . 
  well , the new deus ex * is * going to be set in prague and have terrorism as one of the main subplots , but it 's set in a parallel reality anyway , so it 's fine . 
  good work czech police , i guess . 
  where did think he was , ukraine 's maidan ? 
   they were offensive weapons as much as defensive ... and as i told you at the very beginning , * so are freaking military alliances * . 
  nato has demonstrated clear willingness and ability to conduct aggressive operations as well as `` provide security guarantees '' in the past . 
   this was in 1962 . 
  it was more than fifty years ago . 
  still relevant , though . 
   i assume you 're referring to iraq ... and a myriad other things , including kosovo , afghanistan , libya , current situations in syria and yemen etc.
