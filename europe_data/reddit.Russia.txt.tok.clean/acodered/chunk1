  but that walk through the possessions make me straight in my opinion . 
  there will be russia . 
  sure it 's wonderful . 
  i 'd surely support this economics with both hands , if silesia has exit to the sea . 
  i 've been in kaunas only once , at 12 , and ca n't pretend i know everything . 
  but i feel very depressed , when every one blaming russia for what we doing . 
  back to the question , you know , there is a market , and surely , i 'd prefer three super 's in my square . 
  but it 's not only request , there 's answers , that drive business . 
  okay , you have your own sources to read , and to complain it , if you need to . 
  do n't blame russian 's , bro . 
  ( i deleted my previous comment what am i personally exports to lithuania ), 
  it 's just right time to ask : who you are -- the parasites of our economy ? 
  you have to read economy of lng : http://crustgroup.livejournal.com/24200.html i 'm no doubt you can speak in russian -- i export pretty much to litva , to guarantee , you can read it . 
  so much deliverers , oh wait ... they all in the another hemisphere , nooo !, 
  but there is norge !!!, 
  3.3 % lng of 106 bln m3 = 3,5 m m3 , yes !, 
  business is business . 
  we has to be friends , we have to be partners . 
  who else , than quatar ? 
  ahh , baltic sea . 
  what do they expect there , new lng appeared ? 
  all quatar fleet ( 12 q-max plus 16 lng q-flex ) can deliver only 40 bln m3 gas to baltics annually . 
  if \u015awinouj\u015bcie can accept only q-flex ( 50 % ) , it means that all quatar fleet is only to deliver 20 bln m3 , which is exactly gazprom deliver through it 's minor north stream . 
  oh , russians love snow . 
  in fact , nearly all russians to prefer to spend holidays on the beach under violent sun , than to knead snow at 6-h daytime . 
  it 's easy to manage with frozen snow when it constantly under -10 c -- just move it somewhere else and made 10m snow slide ( exactly under my window ) . 
  but in most populous cities , it is always a headache for municipal services . 
  snow falls , snow melts , icicles fall . 
  it takes enormous efforts to make city available for transports , roofs cleaned , and snow to be taken out the city . 
  that 's why nobody love the snow . 
  i 'd support sanctions both hands , but only to my profit . 
  it 's hard to work when imported cnc routers costs only twice of domestic products . 
  i 'd prefer to block import . 
  and industrial lasers ( 70 % world production in russia ) is seems too overpriced . 
  back to the question , tatar tatars ( as well as bashkirs , mordva and many others ) also flirting with turkey , but there is more cultural interactions than political . 
  what is your personal opinion on nuclear proliferation ? 
  i mean , if nearly every developed country having research reactor , can build plutonium bomb and almost everyone can build uranium bomb , should n't we just accept it as fact ? 
  this is against the interests of great powers , but there is advantages too . 
  there is a unpublicized `` deal '' between crimean tatars and tatar ( russian ) tatars . 
  minikhannov just left crimea . 
  as far as i can suggest tatars will be given more than ukrainians can offer -- tatar as third official language . 
  [ images ] ( http://www.blackseanews.net/read/77469 ), 
  a little remark ( not to blame media ) last days many ukrainian media ( even major tv channels ) translate rumors from the internet , does not bothering simple fact checking . 
  may be due to keep rapid news coverage , not in order to deceive the viewer . 
  i do n't think it specially aligned to olympics . 
  there was clear and concise statement of russian officials in january , that there will be `` economic chaos and multiple territorial disputes immediately if yanukovich off the power '' . 
  this statement was widely spread in news , but for the moment it 's very hard to find it , so i quote it from my memory . 
  mid made tons of statements last days . 
  tl ; dr. saturday : berezovsky made head of navy by kiev sunday : defected to the crimea side sunday : charged with treason, 
  first of all , thanks for doing great job . 
  second , i did not support war , and i do n't think there will be real war . 
  as mentioned there many times , russia will use crimea as leverage in ukrainian dispute . 
  sure , common mood of crowd in russia is cheering and hooray , let 's ~ ~ kick those asses ~ ~ help ukraine . 
  i bet $ 50 that real war , e.g. 
  with tanks and artillery , killing people with army , will not happens . 
  if this happens , public opinion immediately stop the war . 
  as you mentioned , we are brother people . 
  half of my office ( at ural ) have ukrainian decent or relatives in ukraine . 
  this is just unimaginable . 
  now , for the moment , they support government , but if there is any chance of people dying , they take to the streets . 
  third , about nazi 's . 
  there is no problem with nazi 's in government . 
  it is another state , they are free to do what they do , and have any government . 
  the problem is , that this government seems to be anti-russian . 
  you see , that language law repel is clearly show their intentions . 
  one nation , one language . 
  it is not against russia as country , but against russians in ukraine . 
  this is a painful point . 
  back to `` invasion '' . 
  if any region , take crimea for example , did n't satisfied with `` one nation one language '' politics , and wants to obtain sovereignty , why not help them hold their position ? 
  it 's hard to excuse new government , the first law was to repel language law . 
  not led . 
  but it 's hard to deny , the success of euromaidan was provided by right sector . 
  they are responsible for most successful and violent operations . 
  there was no re-elections in parliament , hence it 's not an example to excuse protesters . 
  it 's hard to say , who in reality new government is . 
  if you see list by party affiliations , 2/3 is `` miraculously non-party '' . 
  but 3 chairs got by svoboda , another neonazis . 
  is this you calling `` moderate '' ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkispmptp_i then look again other side . 
  bbc told you same story -- maidan is full of neonazis . 
  this is not correct . 
  ukrainian journalist was proposed to ask two questions of 5 . 
  he choose what he choose . 
  and after this problem to be solved , there is another huge one . 
  next winter is coming . 
  every summer/autumn ukraine have to buy transit gas , and store it in underground facilities to guarantee smooth supply of europe at winter . 
  that gas can not be dispatched through winter , there is a bottleneck near russian-ukraine border , it need to be stored at autumn , or not . 
  if we look back , about half time ukraine failed with payments to fill stores at summer , and gazprom borrow them gas . 
  so there is the next act of the play we see this summer . 
  iceland ? 
  but top of 83 russian regions pretty close by gdp to denmark .
