  so apparently a tv channel of the largest russian private media-holding , owned by putin 's long term friends , managed among others by his ( alleged ) girlfriend is independent . 
  yes , any oligarch is widely hated in russia as it 's ( believed ) impossible without employing corruption to became a billioner in totally corrupt state like russia or ukraine . 
  btw among other oligarchs khodorkovsky was afaik the only who publicly admitted that privatization ( some schemes ) as it was done was unfair and lobbied to legislate obligations for all participants of privatization to compensate losses to the state ( and putin blocked that legislation ) . 
  there are a lot of reasons to suspect him in corruption and a lot of reasons to think he 'd get rid of that if he had a chance . 
  also as a manager he only earned a huge respect among my acquitances who worked at companies formerly owned by him . 
  now given your opinion about khodorkovsky i 'm very interested , what do you think about poroshenko ? 
  that probably also has something to do with perfect english language proficiency , better visa agreements with other countries , better economy that allows to save more money that are needed for emigration . 
  verifying your e-mail will probably solve the posting frequency limitation . 
  is n't it better to speak out and disappear than to disappear silently ? 
   anyone have any info on `` russian sociological service of the anti-corruption fund '' they conduct polls of different types but mostly over phone , are funded by donations ( only from russian citizens and non-anonymous ) and all work now is done by volunteers ( about 400 people as of april ) mostly from moscow where they have a small call centre but apparently from many other russian cities too . 
  first polls were conducted by professional sociologists who then trained volunteers . 
  some of polls are conducted for internal use of anti-corruption fund and others are published by navalny . 
  apparently they are more trustworthy than all major russian pollsters : during last elections of mayor of moscow this sociological service was the only one whos poll results were close to actual election results . 
  while others including public opinion fund , wciom and levada underestimated number of votes for navalny by 7 -- 12 percentage points or 26 -- 43 percents , `` russian sociological service of the anti-corruption fund '' underestimated that by 2 percentage points or 8 % .

  here 's [ translation of an interview with valentina sovkina ] ( http://www.iwgia.org/news/search-news?news_id=1078 ) , one of intercepted members of russian delegation to the conference . 
  demonstration was possible in moscow * this time * , but the same day in other cities , [ for example in novosibirsk where the rally was too allowed by local officials and nobody violated law , people were beaten by pro-putin thugs and arrested by police . 
  ] ( https://www.facebook.com/sasha.sotnik/posts/633957190050483 ), 
  nobody had reasons to expect not to be beaten , arrested and accused in whatever the state wants . 
  that did n't happen in moscow * this time * , but that happened the same day in other cities , [ for example in novosibirsk where the rally was too allowed by local officials and nobody violated law but pro-putin thugs and police . 
  ] ( https://www.facebook.com/sasha.sotnik/posts/633957190050483 ), 
  he not only was one of oligarchs who admitted that privatization was not fair , he also lobbied the windfall tax with ex post facto action against privatization . 
  the intention of the law was to make the oligarchs to pay the difference between the factual and fair prices of privatization , and to put an end to questions about legality of their assets . 
  it were [ putin and kasyanov who did n't give the law a go .

  unless there is more phisical memory then virtual one to ensure the better worst case lifetime , though i 'm not sure if i 've read about such product or it 's my imagination . 
  wiping ssds is n't very simple as well as good ssd controllers randomly remap virtual sectors to phisical ones instead of immediate rewrite to make them wear off evenly , you ca n't reliably overwrite data on ssd without accounting for that . 
  kremlin calls them foreign agents , fifth column and traitors of the nation already . 
  ` it goes like this : a guy borrows money on credit . 
  he uses the credit to rent an office and buy a jeep cherokee and eight crates of smimoff . 
  when the smimoff runs out , it turns out the jeep 's wrecked , the office is awash with puke and the loan is due for repayment . 
  so he borrows money again - three times more than before . 
  he uses it to pay back the first loan , buys a jeep grand cherokee and sixteen crates of absolut vodka . 
  when the absolut ... ' actually i have no idea how this business works . 
  that and also it 's a basis for all kinds of propaganda like anything against putin 's policies is automatically called against russia and oppositionists are called fifth column and traitors of the nation on federal tv . 
  this is actually a very possible scenario in some cases , but still the demand plummeted harder/earlier than other possible causes but the travel ban . 
  this is a very correct article about what hapenned in my city , few days ago i commented on the elections so i 'll copy it here as almost a tldr :  today was the elections day , elections of governers were in 30 regions , 19 of which ahead of time which is the usual kremlin strategy to break opposition candidaes ' agitation campaigns . 
  as usual a huge number of violations by kremlin 's candidates is observed even before the official election day , and police/investors/prosecutors do nothing about it . 
  some opposition candidates were blocked by ` regional filter ' designed specifically for that . 
  many of others are denied by tv stations to broadcast their promotions for made up reasons . 
  state workers and students in state universities were forced to vote earlier than today and often were guided to make them choose a ` right ' candidate . 
  in major cities all the voters received personal letters ( sms in moscow ? ), 
  from kremlin 's candidates which violated a number of personal information laws . 
  markets ' owners were forced to display ` right ' promotions by intimidation . 
  children in state schools got gifts with political promotions for their parents . 
  many promotions were illegally organized using regional/city budget or property . 
  majority of voters saw promotions of only one candidate in their region . 
  so nothing special and just as usual . 
  as a result nobody believes in fairness of these elections , i intentionally went to vote 10 minutes before the closing to ensure nobody voted instead of me and on my dual page in a list of voters i was 6 's who voted out of 20 ( not sure about number , probably more than 20 ) who had to . 
   according to preliminary information [ ** in every single region the kremlin 's candidate won . 
  ** ] ( http://www.newsru.com/russia/15sep2014/vybory.html ) old source but i 'm sure nothing changed . 
  there is more information in the article specifically about samara , worth reading . 
  i also want to tell a short story about this new/old samara governor merkushkin . 
  he was previously a head of mordovia republic , a somewhat poor region . 
  during his rule he set up things in local administration apparatus to guarantee fabrication of any needed results in any election , and in 2011 -- 12 he provided 87 % for putin with 90 % turnout and 93 % for united russia with turnout of 94 % . 
  that was basically the only thing he did in mordovia besides taking over local busineses and giving them to his numerous relatives and friends . 
  though putin was so happy with him he raised him to a richer region of samara as an appointed governor . 
  now the same happens here . 
  couple [ brief ] ( http://www.interpretermag.com/moscow-to-block-five-million-russian-citizens-from-traveling-abroad/ ) [ sources ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/controlling-russians-through-travel-bans/500914.html ) on the ban . 
  military , police , security , intelligence officers and some other state workers were banned from travelling abroad ( with few exceptions ) few months ago to support crimean economy . 
  the first major travel agency bankrupted just few days later , and tens of them bankrupted since then . 
  you should understand the difference between these communities . 
  / r/russia translates the official russian position which can be found in thousands of media sources in russia and can be discussed freely on countless popular websites in russian , they cherry pick every piece of information that can make russia look good , no matter if true , and they are translating their position to english speaking audience . 
  / r/politota emerged from one of few popular russian [ communities ] ( http://politota.d3.ru ) where people discussed hot topics and problems of russia , including thoroughly cherry picked , as they are totally ignored by most of popular russian media , not an alternative news source but one complementing the popular ones to build somewhat objective image . 
  they do n't try to push their position to western audience , they honestly discuss things they are interested in with each other , in their native language . 
  reddit is not exactly the first website an ordinary russian learn about . 
  those people who argue in english mostly about politics , economy and all that things in detail , how do you imagine them not knowing about some very basic things which they do n't need a foreign language or an obscure source to learn about ? 
  i do n't believe they are honest . 
  the main patterns are : * almost 100 % votes for putin/united russia with almost 100 % turnout in manually controlled republics like [ chechnya and dagestan ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0upxcml.png ) . 
  * anomalous distribution of [ voter turnout with high local maximum at 100 % ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8khtf4m.png ) . 
  * [ anomalously high number of invalid ballots on voting stations with 100 % turnout ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zikgfgw.png ) . 
  * [ anomalously high number of voting stations with round number percentage of votes for united russia/putin and less for other parties/candidates ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q0fvlqt.png ) . 
  and many more [ signs of pro-putin manipulations ] ( http://samarcandanalytics.com/?page_id=39 ) of voting results all over the country . 
  today was the elections day , elections of governers were in 30 regions , 19 of which ahead of time which is the usual kremlin strategy to break opposition candidaes ' agitation campaigns . 
  as usual a huge number of violations by kremlin 's candidates is observed even before the official election day , and police/investors/prosecutors do nothing about it .
