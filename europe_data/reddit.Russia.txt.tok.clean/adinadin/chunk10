  anyway there are tens of millions workers paid by state ( 30 to 50 mln from first results in google ) , and they would n't want to loose their job and benefits . 
  some enormous amount of people in russia just depend on the state and will not let their unfavorable opinions to be heared , people still remember the time when being imprisoned for words was not something rare and reasonably expect benevolent informers to be alive as well . 
  edit : to clarify for foreigners , it 's of course not enough that they depend on the state , but it 's also that for the last few years amount of hate directed from state media at opposition of any kind became enormous , they were called enemies and traitors of the nation enough to reanimate reflexes learned in soviet era . 
  it 's true that russian domestic propaganda often uses foreign sources for extra authority points but rt is not the case , too many people know it 's russian . 
  kremlin uses fake-ish foreign sources instead , and produce news with opinions of ` international experts ' nobody ever heard before or even with a history of backing kremlin , or translate stories from some tiny irrelevant foreign media presenting it as a popular majority opinions . 
  a few examples of foreign sources used by russian major media : * some british lawyer that was [ found to be a huge liar and lost his license for it ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9146307/barrister-struck-off-over-claim-that-senior-law-lord-had-him-kidnapped.html ) is one of the favorite [ british experts in russian media ] ( http://ria.ru/search/?query=%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%ba%d1%83%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%81 ) including [ rt ] ( https://www.rt.com/search/?q=mercouris ) . 
  * [ some racist journalist ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=nl&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2frevu.nl%2fnu-in-revu%2fzwarten-hebben-lager-iq-verkrachten-vaker%2f ) is [ the chosen expert from netherlands , especially on mh17 . 
  ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fpolitota.dirty.ru%2fzhurnalist-pisatel-i-ekspert-iz-bezrabotnogo-rasista-706351%2f ) * [ a german expert frequent on russian media is just a fake . 
  ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.svoboda.org%2fcontent%2farticle%2f26632066.html ), 
  like systematically refusing to register opposition candidates on local elections with bs excuses and like removing the last senate member who allowed himself to critisize some of recently adopted ultra-conservative laws . 
  like beating up local mps for investigating illegal anonymous burials linked to ongoing conflict . 
  like banning even non-political tv show hosts from mainstream tv once they express their liberal political views , not even on tv . 
  there are actually countless glaring examples of all levels of importance . 
  most people in russia choose putin on a political scene wiped by putin from any competition , after consuming a massive media campaign with limitless budget including negative pr of any potential opponents . 
  what a surprise . 
  you consider the nobel prise jury to be biased russophobes but how would you explain that the same book won the popular readers award in moscow a year ago ? 
  unknown writer ... have you never heard of her '' \u0423 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043b\u0438\u0446\u043e '' ? 
  because it was on the recommended reading list in my school . 
  the same thing with russia , ukraine , belarus . 
  i never saw it designed that way . 
  usually towel radiators are connected to the reverse part of hot water circuit , and are always hot . 
  hot water flows in the house circuit even when no one uses hot water and is pumped non stop through the heat exchanger powered by heat provider 's isolated hot water circuit . 
  if the system was designed without constant pumping and reheating it would take ages to get actual hot water in a typical 9 story house early in the morning ( which happens when the system fails or is abused by connecting large radiators or floor heaters to the hot water reverse ) . 
  after 2011 duma elections that official cctv futage was routinely thrown out of court . 
  now they only cancel results in a few most outrageous cases that brought the most public attention . 
  it 's a drop in the sea revealed by statistical analysis . 
  if putin/ur won his elections with real results it would hurt his image of indispensable and lower his support over time . 
  you ca n't ignore how putin and other top officials promote ` just putin-lovers who want him to win ' , and that 's as effective as direct orders just more cunning and safe . 
  international observation is extremely limited , but general statistics shows you it all . 
  osce did n't catch saratov copy pasted voting results either even though those are so apparent that officials decided to cancel results on some polling stations . 
  and osce did have observers in saratov . 
   did n't even try to win this voters the only party that did was illegaly terminated by the state without a court . 
  every time russian government manages to run this trick , they put a lot of effort to spread the message of how much people support them and that they 're going to run the following elections in the fairest fashion with no fraud because they 're going to win anyway , that discourages indifferent voters ( the majority ) from voting , and lets the state to stuff their ballots . 
  vote rigging is way easier to set up in small regions with big population , you have to cover less voting stations and can stuff more ballots where you have more registered voters per station . 
  it 's actual for many state agencies and state owned companies , not just in chechnya . 
  here graphics say a lot but there is no need really , because [ raw results are just a bunch of copy pasted numbers ] ( http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/kireev/2901613/473729/473729_original.png ) with little variance . 
  there used to be 20-25 % cut offs for different kinds of elections , but those were removed a few years ago . 
  niels bohr used to have a personal beer pipeline and then my hometown samara used to have the first commercial beer pipeline built by alfred von vakano before bolsheviks ruined it all for us . 
  welcome to internet . 
  if something seems outrageous it 's probably not true . 
  user stalin1941 impersonates a university history teacher , in other post says lives with sister and casually runs downstares , posts stupid jokes , account 1 month old , with random teacher selfie taken from internet that was posted years ago everywhere . 
  assumption in my comment is stated fact in the article you linked . 
  also it ( or apparently ministry of ` justice ' ) quite irrelevantly mentions a number of personal interviews , it 's hardly levada 's busines that its members give interviews . 
  and you know they openly commented on politics like forever but still last time they were accused in braking the same law in 2013 nobody even considered their personal opinion pieces levada 's business , but now apparently it 's the time to tighten the screws once again . 
   there is a massive difference between an operation making money doing business deals with foreigners and one that is funded by them . 
  being funded is not more than legal lingo trick , any money received counts . 
  levada did some polls on a commercial basis for foreign clients . 
  apparently they got busted for running polls as a part of [ study on `` homeownership and societal stability : assessing causal effects in central eurasia '' funded by us govt . 
  ] ( https://www.usaspending.gov/transparency/pages/awardsummary.aspx?awardid=22639353 ), 
  alone by the timing of being named a foreign agent levada now has no legal way of polling about elections and other political topics , they are now stuck in the gray zone for months because of the way the law was designed , and there are major elections just in couple weeks . 
  a lot of polls are parts of continuous studies that will lost in scientific value if interrupted , and a lot of polls are obligations by commercial contracts that will get the company bankrupted if interrupted , but if they continue all their regular polls on politics they now will be fined by the state and get bankrupted as well . 
  not sure how to interpret it in comparison with general support , this was an open question , not how much you support or do n't support the president , but who 're you going to vote for if elections were next weekend , and participants do n't give a number or choose a name from the list but have to give a name that they remember , so i guess these results vary more than general support . 
  also the trend is the same , little variation in 2013 and wild growth since 2014 . 
  did n't find the complete table , probably it 's not a regularly asked question compared with general support , but [ in june 2013 it was 29 % ] ( http://www.levada.ru/2013/07/17/moskva-nakanune-vyborov-mera-polnoe-issledovanie/ ) down from 36 % -31 % earlier in 2013 in your link , in [ 2014 ] ( http://www.levada.ru/2014/08/13/vozmozhnye-rezultaty-prezidentskih-i-parlamentskih-vyborov-10/ ) it grew from 29 % to 52 % , [ in feb 2015 55 % , in jan 2016 53 % . 
  still proper registration even if initiated by the state then requires application from ngo , so to complete the registration they still need to apply and wait until it 's processed . 
  the same happened with golos ngo , they were named a foreign agent then fined for political activity . 
   there are no such limitations . 
  in some magic fairy land . 
  there are just a couple weeks left before elections , and running electoral polls is considered political activity and for a foreign agent to be allowed participating in political activity they should apply and go through a thorough examination , and it will take ages not a couple weeks ( by the law such application are processed on quarterly schedule ) , or they will be punished with a disrupting fine at best . 
  [ here 's the law text in russian . 
  where are you taking it from ? 
  in 2013 putin had lowest rating since 2000 because of escalating financial crisis in russia , see the [ original source ] ( http://www.levada.ru/old/indeksy ) . 
  i followed it and remember well that it happened this way . 
   their polls regarding putin 's popularity changed dramatically once they were attacked by government agencies in 2013 . 
  it happened once russian tv became full with extremely intensive coverage of maidan contraposing `` putin 's stability '' with `` us funded homo-nazi-jew militants ruining the country while on drugs '' and extending that image to russian opposition as well . 
   nothing will change the levada centre can not now conduct any work linked to the election campaign . 
  you think less chechens died fighting against ukraine as mercenaries ? 
  no doubt they have good reasons to leave chechnya , but they could settle in belarus and not try to cross the borders further , or return to russia but in some different region . 
  idk if they are under threat of retaliation from kadyrovites in other regions but chechnya or moscow , but i 'm almost sure they are safe in belarus . 
  [ this specialization popularity rating ] ( http://moeobrazovanie.ru/specialities_rating_vuz/ ) does n't look very trustworthy but must reveal general trends . 
  apparently way too much people want to be state officials and the only kinds of engineering fields in top 20 are different specializations in software engineering , with architecture , construction and oil being in top 30 . 
  i did n't experience any disdain for engineering in my surrounding . 
  looking at my classmates from high school about a half of them continued to study some kind of engineering but many of them work do n't work with their specialization . 
  people who studied electronic engineering or industrial automation mostly work in regular software development , sqa , management . 
  a few acquaintances who studied oil or construction work in their field but the latter had harder time to find a decent work . 
  and a bunch of people studied something obscure like jet engines or space satellites just because those were offered by a good university nearby , did n't even had an intention to work in the field and did n't expect there to be decent jobs ( there are listings but they do n't offer any good money ) , because they felt a degree and particularly an engineering degree will be still valued by employers even if they work in another field in a way ` if managed to study that , i will be successful at anything ' . 
  it 's [ 76 % for russia ] ( http://graduate.edu.ru/#/?year=2014 ) , i also looked into [ elaboration by university ] ( http://graduate.edu.ru/registry#/?slice=1&amp;year=2014 ) and was surprised how top regional universities often have 90 % employment but top federal ones have 85 % , probably their graduates get hired abroad more and ca n't get tracked . 
  thanks for correction . 
  [ here 's the list . 
  preparing for the upcoming duma elections russian central electoral commission accredited 117 international observers . 
  out of 36 observers so far scrutinized by golos ngo they found 14 russian citizens ( who by international law of elections and referendums in cis countries do n't qualify as international observers ) , and 33 direct subordinates of a high ranked member of united russia party ( who is also head of russian parliament upper house and head of cis interparliamental assembly ) . 
  [ pace observers were not invited ] ( http://kommersant.ru/doc/3066414 ) for depriving russia from right of vote in the organization over grabbing crimea , osce is the only organization providing long term observation , while ~ ~ most ~ ~ observers are invited from ex-ussr countries organizations and even some orthodox christian organization . 
  central electoral commission [ officials so far commented ] ( http://kommersant.ru/doc/3069812 ) that it 's not a big deal and that `` presence of russians in the commission will make no difference . 
  you can put pressure on anyone . 
  when before ` expert ' you read ` independent ' that rises even more questions '', 
  what a bullshit . 
  true that no opposition leader in russia is a threat to current russian leadership , putin built strong enough system to control media , and all officials of all branches of power , to nip opposition in the bud . 
  but that folks who are threat to kremlin already sit in duma ? 
  there is just no opposition there in duma . 
  there is a one single person who systematically showed signs of opposition ( gudkov ) and he was expelled from duma by other parliamentaties ( ) , now his son was promoted by the same party duma list and too remains the single systematic opposition voter in duma , was threatened to be expelled as well . 
  look at the most outrageous laws passed recently , and show me opposition , [ law banning adoption of russian children from abroad and broadly banning russian non-profits from interaction with foreign non-profits ] ( http://vote.duma.gov.ru/vote/80026 ) , [ gay propaganda law ] ( http://vote.duma.gov.ru/vote/81454 ) . 
  in many other cases they do n't even bother to press buttons because united russia has majority , or they only participate in the final hearing to [ vote against something disgusting ] ( http://vote.duma.gov.ru/vote/95965 ) when it 's clear that the law is [ going pass anyway ] ( http://vote.duma.gov.ru/vote/95964 ) ( notice how it 's only a few minutes between two hearings of the same law because there is duma vacation soon and they want to pass shit quick ) . 
  idk about romania but my russian grandparents were amazed by variety and quality of products when on a year long business trip to bulgaria in 70s . 
  you 're so wrong . 
  maybe this is what a regular moscow store looked like , but for example in samara which is also one of biggest russian cities this variety of food in the store , or honestly just meat available would result in kilometer long line . 
  every time my parents got a chance to visit moscow they brought back as much sausages ( no way to transport fresh meat ) , and fucking toilet paper as they reasonably could carry , then anything edible was distributed among close relatives to not let it spoil . 
  moscow locals looked at them like at crazy , but that ' t planned economy for you . 
  there are even tons of famous jokes about it like : what is long green and smells like a sausage ? 
  a train from moscow !, 
  meat in samara stores was at sale not every day , it was not real meat but ` soup kits ' - bones with some residue of meat and there still were lines to buy that .
