  according to the [ original source ] ( http://www.eiu.com/handlers/whitepaperhandler.ashx?fi=liveability+ranking+summary+report+-+august+2016.pdf&amp;mode=wp&amp;campaignid=liveability2016 ) kiev lost 25 % of its score in recent years , likely because of maidan . 
  there is traditionally a ton of electoral fraud in russian elections , even elected officials themselves talk openly before every upcoming election that they 're going to run those in the most open and just way because everyone knows it 's a huge problem here . 
  we even had massive rallies after last parliament elections caused by blatant vote rigging in favor of the ruling party . 
  but the problem here is not even election day fraud but ` the vertical of power ' that putin built to control every official , control and heavy abuse of media that pretty much invalidates the results far before the elections . 
  you can visit and buy some highest quality putin t-shirts , iphone cases with russian coat of arms , some people say you can even find liquefied patriotism at a liquor store . 
  yeah great , they sanctioned a few russian politicians and some most affiliated businesses , and putin ` in response ' sanctioned me and every regular russian consumer . 
  i believe he only did that to let most russians share his pain and blame it on the west via controlled media to even further strengthen his point that the west is evil . 
  it 's # 50 for single entry visa if you 're willing to wait 4-30 days for processing . 
  actually that 's not rare in russia either . 
  mayor urlashov 's case was trumped up from the very beginning in the best traditions of putin 's democracy . 
  a ton of procedural violations made by investigation officers and by court , harassment of his attorneys , conviction based of testimony of interested parties and extremely sketchy people . 
  in the first count there is no hard evidence and only testimony of interested parties , which also suspiciously changed multiple times and contradict each other . 
  the key witness in the second count avdalyan is himself under investigation in multiple counts of corruption , one case even initiated by this same sentenced mayor urlashov much earlier , but the investigation is stalled because accused is united russia member . 
  and of course the court in the lack of hard evidence declared that `` there is no reasons not to trust avdalyan 's testimony '' . 
  and finally the case against urlashov started two weeks after he supported a big opposition rally where he declared that russia is totally controlled using united russia party as a tool with a massive help of illegal administrative measures , and declared his willingness to struggle against that and for real democracy . 
  previously urlashov himself was a member of united russia but before this whole thing he left and declared that he does n't support ur policies and only became a member to promote his political career , because other parties and independents are heavily discriminated against by the state in illegal ways . 
   compared to the changes that were brought about as the result of the dissolution of the ussr sure as hell , did n't even compare with that . 
  but he does n't seem to be obedient after going into office , and change in general policy is apparent . 
  everything used to be controlled by money in a shitty but competition based manner , now by putin 's favor . 
   such as ? 
  i mean media control in the first place , it 's kind of the enabling change that lets him get away with the rest . 
  sure yeltsin 's russia was already a presidential democracy formally and a mafia state practically but i would n't call the changes minor by any measure , particularly regional governance or parliaments were real working institutes during yeltsin time , now those are under total control of president , you can say the same about many other bodies of government and institutes that are not supposed to be influenced by the state at all . 
   kind of unlike others kadyrov did n't resign but publicly announced that he will not run for the next elections , that 's enough of a shock for chechnya . 
  but sure that was bad wording on my part . 
  i 'm also not shure if in chechnya there will be early or properly scheduled election and honestly do n't care to check . 
  being appointed in the past did n't make any of those governors provisional . 
  there are a lot of governors in the table who were not provisional in that period of time , they were just fully appointed and did n't had to change anything before the scheduled elections which was in years for most of them . 
  some ( 20 % maybe ) governors that were active when elections were legislated just decided to ` legitimize ' themselves by resigning voluntarily , just to be immidiately reappointed as acting governors and run elections rescheduled earlier . 
  it was not a unique moment in 2012 , they still do that ever since that year , kind of like kadyrov did recently ( [ resign ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/489g6n/chechnya_leader_kadyrov_says_he_will_quit_at_end/ ) , and be provisionally [ reappointed by putin ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4bx4nz/putin_nominates_ramzan_kadyrov_to_remain_chechen/ ) ) . 
  and the goal of the trick was always the same , to demonstrate all the local bureaucrats putins favour to you , and break opposition campaigns if there is still any opposition alive . 
  all these governors elections are just democracy theatre , even more apparent then other kinds of elections in russia . 
  for all those not familiar with the vertical of power built by putin , do n't let fool yourself with temporary or provisional appointments . 
  the governor appointed by putin is coincidentally always the one who wins the next elections , like in 146 % of cases . 
  look at the [ list of all russian region governors ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%94%d0%b5%d0%b9%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d1%83%d1%8e%d1%89%d0%b8%d0%b5_%d0%b3%d0%bb%d0%b0%d0%b2%d1%8b_%d1%81%d1%83%d0%b1%d1%8a%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b2_%d0%a0%d0%be%d1%81%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%b9%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b9_%d0%a4%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%b8 ) , search for '' \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0438 . 
  ( provisional ) and highlight all , you 'll see all of them were provisional at first . 
  after putin appoints governors this way they run early elections to disrupt the schedule and not let opposition a chance to organize their campaign ( overly strict funding and political promotion laws that only enforced on opposition help a lot too ) . 
  just look at this [ list of regional elections in russia ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%92%d1%8b%d0%b1%d0%be%d1%80%d1%8b_%d0%b3%d0%bb%d0%b0%d0%b2_%d1%81%d1%83%d0%b1%d1%8a%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b2_%d0%a0%d0%be%d1%81%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%b9%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b9_%d0%a4%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%b8 ) , most of them are rescheduled earlier for this reason . 
  search for '' \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0440\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0431\u043e\u0440\u044b '' ( early rescheduled elections ) in page and highlight all . 
  the post title is not misleading , russia calling itself a democracy is misleading . 
  there was a number of oil and gas field fires extinguished by nukes in ussr . 
  but afaik those were underground explosions to seal the leak in the ground with melted rock . 
  there is no law that allows the city to deny the rally after a week of application , they could deny the rally in the requested place and offer another place in three days of application but they did n't , also they often just refuse to take application which is illegal too . 
   average there was always choice of imported products , and local cheese was never good . 
  i mean who cares what it 's made from if it does n't taste good anyway and you have competing products to buy ? 
  no , the average quality and price of cheese on shelves was acceptable until imports were banned even though local cheese was not much better than now . 
  i hope you see the key here . 
  even though quality control was loosened before the bans , anything stricter now would kill the lower price segment so i only expect for standards to keep going lower to support the market . 
  is n't it obvious that the whole situation comes from state imposed ban on foreign products ? 
  is n't it obvious that terrible quality and ridiculous prices of cheese come from demand remaining high enough while local producers being unable to meet it without sacrificing quality ? 
  is n't it obvious that for the state loosening quality control is a way to keep the market alive and able to pay taxes , again sacrificing health and quality of life of citizens ? 
  it started long before 90 's , ussr television used to air ballet every time a general secretary died until it was n't clear who is taking over and what the new party line is going to be . 
  she wears [ valenki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valenki ) which are often oversized . 
  the problem is no one but russians care enough to try and cover most of russian domestic issues , and russian media that try to keep getting ousted . 
  by your logic anyone who got fired in russia for political reasons ( meduza editor in chief , fired from lenta.ru and other journalists followed her to continue write without influence of russian state pressure ) ca n't be trusted in their criticism of russia . 
  i see it the other way , pressure on media is apparent and you hardly can expect full picture on internal issues or russian foreign policy from media companies registered in russian jurisdiction . 
  the old draft was current when the article was published , and now the article mentions that some proposals were removed a few hours later . 
   late on wednesday , june 22 , the `` second-reading '' text of yarovaya 's legislation disappeared from the state duma 's online database . 
  on june 23 , it reappeared , with all proposals about revoking russians ' citizenship [ removed completely ] ( https://meduza.io/news/2016/06/23/iz-paketa-yarovoy-ubrali-normu-o-lishenii-grazhdanstva ) . 
  current [ deputy prime minister of russia , 9 years ago . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/fuitoukq-zc?t=2m25s ), 
  i mostly mean channel 1 , rossiya 1 , ntv , rentv , these all are channels mostly owned by the state and putin 's friends in different proportions , all these channels you can watch anywhere and for free and these are usually the only federal channels offering news reports . 
  rbc is significantly better in that regard but is targeted on people interested in finance , is usually not free , is not so popular and not so widely available , and their top editor was fired recently under state pressure . 
  though there is a lot of fox news influence in russian media , there was even a new propaganda channel tsargrad created recently targeting orthodox believers , and an ex fox news executive was hired to head it . 
  what / u/rds2596 described sounds like a regular rentv documentary . 
  also i did n't watch fox news much but by my impression russian tv is shit compared even to fox news , quality of debates , selection of participants , hosts ' behaviour , or amount of live brodcasts are so much lower . 
  there was a governor tkachev who is now promoted to minister by putin , who ows a huge agricultural business and used to regularly announce that his competitors ' livestock is sick and order its total extermination . 
  people like that would do anything for extra profit . 
  keep your bullshit straight , you said you 're not russian in another comment . 
  for many in russia university education is a way to avoid military draft . 
  in most universities , even respectable ones it 's very easy and cheap to buy your grades all the way to graduation , and a lot of universities just have so low standards that you can pass most exams without actually studying anything because retention of paying customers ( even if the state pays for them ) is more important than anything else . 
  is joking about the anthem going to be considered an insult ? 
  [ one of my favorite jokes ] ( http://ivand.livejournal.com/1161143.html ) appeared when the man died who wrote the original soviet anthem and then over half a century later slightly modified lyrics into modern russian anthem . 
  i 'm not able to make any good translation saving the rhyme and style , but in the joke he writes an anthem for paradise and presents it to saint peter but gets thrown to the hell and writes a new anthem for the hell while he 's falling there , all anthems also only with slight differences from the original but spot on . 
   [ un human rights official marzuki darusman said ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/29/north-korea-workers-forced-labour-abroad-un-report ) more than 50,000 north korean workers are employed in foreign countries , mainly in the mining , logging , textile and construction industries , according to various studies . 
    the vast majority are working in china and russia , he said , but others are reportedly employed in countries including algeria , angola , cambodia , equatorial guinea , ethiopia , kuwait , libya , malaysia , mongolia , myanmar , nigeria , oman , poland , qatar and the united arab emirates . 
  the difference is that in some countries it 's illegal to deny internationally recognized crimes against humanity , and in others it 's illegal to recognize your country 's crimes . 
  just because we 're not alone returning back to company of china and erdogan 's turkey is not making it any better . 
  and insulting laws are not the same even if controversial . 
  you said the law is against terrorists , but peaceful people talking about politics formally qualify for it . 
  it 's likely not going to be used against random reddit commenters , but it could be used against political activists . 
  in fact this law is not even needed as there were already cases when political activists were denied freedom of travel with no formal reason or had their travel passports illegally damaged by customs at the airport . 
   there is nothing `` draconian ''  it is no `` anti-protest law '' , it is anti-terrorism proposal technically correct outside of context , but if you know the rest of russian laws it is n't correct anymore . 
  for example for writing online that crimea is not lawfully russian and it should be returned to ukraine you can be sentenced under article 280.1 or russian criminal code , this comment alone is technically considered extremism in russia and the law proposal in original post if passed could be applied to me without court decision . 
  am i a terrorist now ? 
  it would take a lot of efforts to push this incident to court , and in court the case is doomed for the reasons mentioned above . 
  it also does n't help that navalny 's team is practically ddosed with court cases against him and running another one in a remote region is a bit complicated . 
  there are witness claims that one of victims of attack under pressure was the first one to use force , so likely police and court will use it to create as much problems to him as possible ignoring the context . 
  cossack organizations typically play a role of police volunteers and private security companies , often acting in the gray zone and sometimes just racketeering . 
  for example at some point in late 90 a lot of these cossacks appeared out of nowhere in my home region samara , and they offered to guard [ dacha cooperatives ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dacha ) in winter , and everyone soon learned that only ones not paying them get burgled even if they were n't before . 
  police ignores them . 
  they also attempt to play some cultural role in other regions where more cossacks lived historically . 
  meaning festivals , militaristic-patriotic clubs , even their own schools . 
  tldr : the local cossacks organization that attacked navalny , activists and tv rain journalist yesterday in anapa is well known for previous crimes . 
  previously they appeared in media after assault of bloodhound gang band for offencing russian flag , and assaults of foreign workers at the city market . 
  the leader of these cossacks nikolai nesterenko never was a cossack until the ussr collapsed , he used to be an ethnographer at a local museum and supposedly a kgb agent helping to identify black archeologists . 
  in the 90s and since nesterenko was reported to police at least 40 times for varyious crimes like extortion , vigilantism , hooliganism , fraud , forgery of documents , arson , robbery and non compliance to court orders . 
  but nesterenko never got in trouble for that thanks to his connections in kgb/fsb . 
  his rivals in business however found themselves beaten or imprisoned . 
  important fact from [ another article ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.gazeta.ru%2fpolitics%2f2016%2f05%2f17_a_8249609.shtml&amp;edit-text= ) : nikolai nesterenko 's cossack organization receives generous donations from local budget , and won a number of grants from state funds which in 2014 amounted to over 43mln rubles in total ( $ 1.2 mn in 2014 usd ) , it 's unclear how much it receives now but at least 18mn rubles yearly from one funding program . 
   last time i heard about them beating someone was ` pussy riot ' incident , and it was proved to be a staged beating , staged by ` pussy riot ' themselves .
