  many of others are denied by tv stations to broadcast their promotions for made up reasons . 
  state workers and students in state universities were forced to vote earlier than today and often were guided to make them choose a ` right ' candidate . 
  in major cities all the voters received personal letters from kremlin 's candidates which violated a number of personal information laws . 
  markets ' owners were forced to display ` right ' promotions by intimidation . 
  children in state schools got gifts with political promotions for their parents . 
  many promotions were illegally organized using regional/city budget or property . 
  majority of voters saw promotions of only one candidate in their region . 
  so nothing special and just as usual . 
  as a result nobody believes in fairness of these elections , i intentionally went to vote 10 minutes before the closing and on my dual page in a list of voters i was 6 's who voted out of 20 who had to . 
  add : sorry for lack of sources , none of them are good and tens of them are needed to cover all relevant data .

  in english : [ short overview ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-elections-/26582715.html ) , and specifically about [ crimean elections ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2014/09/14/crimea-votes-in-a-russian-election-as-opposition-fears-failure/ ) . 
  add : according to preliminary information [ ** in every single region the kremlin 's candidate won . 
  ** ] ( http://www.newsru.com/russia/15sep2014/vybory.html ), 
  actually there are refugees in almost every region of russia . 
  in samara region which is on west and south here were [ 3400 ferugees a month ago with quota of up to 5000 in 2014 ] ( http://www.vninform.ru/article/310210.html ) . 
  the problem with siberia as i got it is refugees ca n't choose what region to go to , they only get free transportation and allowance in a random region , including siberia and many others , though many regions are already out of quota and ca n't take more refugees . 
  you should probably check [ this poll ] ( http://www.levada.ru/18-08-2014/oprosy-obshchestvennogo-mneniya-interes-doverie-i-strakhi ) : * in russia more than a quarter of people fear of possible political prosecution in case if they answer polls with a criticism of the state ( 6 % are sure they will be prosecuted , 22 % fear it 's likely , 44 % unlikely , and 17 % are sure they ca n't be prosecuted for that ) . 
  * 32 % of all russians ca n't talk freely or at all about politics . 
  and out of people who admitted they do n't support putin that 's already 40 % . 
  now go meta and imagine how much of people who fear political prosecution and ca n't freely speak about politics because they do n't support current state policies managed to overcome their fears to answer political polls honestly or agreed to participate in a poll at all . 
  i imagine not much of them . 
  even this poll above should be normalized by this fear coefficient . 
  you should also take into account that a lot of polls are conducted over the phone , which means 100 % ability to identify the respondent . 
  now finally compare russia where all the violence people see is on tv and crimea which was recently annexed and armed people are on streets . 
  crimeans have much more reasons to fear answering the polls `` in the wrong way '' . 
  i 'm amazed how people talk about opinion polls where there is propaganda instead of media and fear instead of freedom . 
  polls like that indicate only how effective state 's intimidational policies are , not what they were intended to indicate . 
  here are [ 120 best selling ** e - ** books of 2013 -- 14 ] ( http://www.litres.ru/luchshie-knigi/za-god/?limit=120 ) in russia . 
  the only political book i see there is mikhail khodorkovsky 's book . 
  the only historical book ` part of europe . 
  history of russian state . 
  from the roots to the mongol invasion . ', 
  by boris akunin , did n't read it but i do n't expect it to be anti-ukraine as the author is a huge oppositionist to putin . 
  and the only ukraine-related ( not really ) book is `` crimea island '' by vasily aksyonov , an alternative histoy fiction , satyre of russian and communist mores and values , and western ones as well , written in 1979 and banned in ussr . 
  none of the books in the photo are somewhat popular . 
  some of the authors of them are also hosts on kremlintv , so i suspect they write those books not because anybody buy them but because they are paid to write that crap , not as writers but as propagandists . 
  upd : / u/3dom replied that it 's e-books rating and it 's irrelevant for the less tech-savvy population aka putin 's electorate but for some reason the comment was later removed . 
  so i checked also ratings of printed books , still it 's online shops as the easiest source of ratings for 2014 : in [ ozon ] ( http://www.ozon.ru/context/best_books/?bests=1&amp;store=1,0&amp;sort=bests ) , the largest russian online book shop , there is one of anti-ukraine books in top-100 . 
  in [ books.ru ] ( http://www.kniga.ru/books/ ) there are two of such books in top-100 . 
  apparently some of authors from the photo have their audience thanks to 24 * 7 tv propaganda but still , the good books are more popular and much more numerous . 
  how any of mentioned by you characteristics of her are relevant to the quality of her articles ? 
  total fertility rate is the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if she were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates through her lifetime , and she were to survive from birth through the end of her reproductive life ( mortality rate and changes in age structure are ignored ) . 
  [ i did it for you . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/p2woju1.png ) sorry for region names in russian , top 10 are : tuva , chechen , altai , nenets , ingushetia , buryatia , sakha , kurgan last of which with the fertility rate of 2.115 . 
  i do n't know about saint petersburg itself but somehow its region is the last/worst with the fertility rate of 1.227 , while moscow is only the next to the worst with the rate of 1.328 . 
  what do you think about [ this comment ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2014/09/03/8-things-masha-gessen-got-wrong-about-russian-demography/?commentid=comment_blogandpostid/blog/comment/1575-3236-6894 ) ? 
  everybody ignored it in / r/russia discussion . 
  i 'll copy it here :  `` masha gessen may well have made some errors in her article , and mr adomanis may well be right . 
  but that 's difficult to know , as he disappointingly resorts to distortion , obfuscation , and sleight of hand to make his points . 
  let 's unpack ( not `` unpackage '' ) them one at a time :  -- when gessen wrote that russia 's fertility rate `` still has not recovered '' , she is referring to the gorbachev-era peak of 2.2 , from which it has . 
  indeed still not recovered . 
   -- gessen did not write that the us fertility rate for 2013 was 2.01 ; she stated that this is the estimated rate for 2014 . 
   -- whether russia 's birth rate is `` not that strange '' is an interpretation ; the fact is that it 's in the bottom quintile . 
   -- regarding the crude death rate , adomanis ' chart `` inexcusably '' omits data for the vast majority of the time period under discussion -- unless he thinks that khrushchev was in office in 1990 . 
  to counter the assertion of an `` inexorable rise '' in death rates , he would need to provide a chart with data going back to at least 1960 . 
  the cherry-picking is unhelpful at best , dishonest at worst . 
   -- regarding deaths from external causes , adomanis is complaining that his oranges do n't look like gessen 's apples . 
  gessen 's supporting quote is clear : eberstadt is saying that deaths from external causes in russia are getting worse * in comparison to cvd mortality levels in western europe * . 
  in other words , while russian cvd mortality is currently declining gently , europe 's has plummeted . 
  so russia may be slightly worse off in absolute terms but is much , much worse off in relative terms . 
   -- recent life expectancy data is always speculative , so in the end the dramatic rise in life expectancy in the past five years may not hold . 
  that part of the graph is far from an `` objective '' fact . 
  in any case , gessen is referring to two historical periods ( khrushchev and gorbachev ) . 
  indeed , she does n't take anything after 2000 into account -- but that has no bearing on her * historical * point . 
   whether these errors and distortions on adomanis ' part are intentional or simply a lack of time or reading comprehension , they do not inspire confidence . 
  gessen 's article deserves a thorough and thoughtful analysis and perhaps refutation ; this , sadly , is not that . '', 
  mark adomanis replied on it but did n't really answerred any point . 
  also if you 're talking about bias you should also mention that makr adomanis is a huge putin 's fan . 
  add : just found [ gessen 's article in reply to adomanis ] ( http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/sep/08/russias-dying-postscript/ ) which [ he replied too ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2014/09/09/russian-demography-and-useful-idiocy/ ) . 
  kgb agent speaking his mind openly ? 
  he just loves to hold people in constant and unnecessary stress , from routinely being late to meetings to frightening merkel with his dogs , or smilingly saying `` it drowned '' and nothing more about circumstances of kursk tragedy in a major interview , or publicly violateing traffic ( or whatever ) laws , or using obviously provocative vocabulary borrowed from hitler . 
  even his choise not to participate in any debates is more of a way of saying `` i do n't need your votes , that 's not how i 'm going to win these elections '' . 
  he revels in his power , the ways he abuses it , and the fact nobody 's able or going to stop him . 
  thanks !, 
  thank you , when you 're learning a new language it 's actually very helpful when people do n't hesitate to make some language corrections , and especially minor ones as those are the hardest to make by yourself . 
  i 've read those stories in russian and i imagine people wrote them themselves so language must not be a problem for those people . 
  i remember some stories written by ethnic russians from various regions but mostly central asia i believe , i do n't have statistics anyway . 
  i believe the general reason is just a bureaucracy and bribe extortion , it 's just in some regions it 's not so widespread and people from some regions of interest ( crimea , south ossetia ) are processed as a priority . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ english ^ ^ ^ ^ corrected ^ ^ ^ ^ , 
  i do n't know a lot about that but i often see people on internet complaining how they struggle for years to acquire russian citizenship ( having all conditions for that ) and instead get sabotaged by officials on all levels while people in south ossetia or crimea are almost forced to take russian passports . 
  i 'm sure in most cases it 's somewhere in between of theese extremes and depend a lot on where these people were born and in what region are they trying to process their naturalization . 
  i 'm sure mickey rourke is paid for this show and most of people in line just want a photo with him . 
  products on back shelves look like mayonnaise to me , why someone would buy up mayonnaise ? 
  apparently there is already shortage of products for people with lactose or glutene intolerance , also there wo n't be someone 's favorite products , many products will became much expensive and a lot of products of questionable quality from third world will appear . 
  no humanitarian disaster but nothing good either . 
  he is generally perceived as some sort of a court jester , but he have a very important role -- he 's the leader of one of a few parties which are allowed to exist ( real opposition parties are denied to register for years and are sabotaged on all levels by state officials ) and it is a spoiler party ( like all parties in duma but united russia ) which supports putin in every single relevant issue but makes very different media image to attract marginal voters ( generally uneducated , nationalistic ) . 
  he also claims to be opposition and tries to secure the belief in people that opposition in general is terrible . 
  formally he is , he always was in reserve since senior leutenant rank and was promoted twice , no one knows why . 
  there is at least euronews in russian . 
  but for whatever reason it does n't says exactly what is says in english , the difference is small though . 
  after [ victor orban ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2bsqdq/hungarys_prime_minister_viktor_orb%c3%a1n_has/ ) he 's already third . 
  video is genuine , even kremlintv [ reported ] ( http://www.1tv.ru/news/social/154657 ) about the incident . 
  there were no damage and after installing additional absorbers it 's now in use again . 
  btw i was wrong about the kerch strait width , i remembered it to be over 10km so the volgograd bridge is actually only 3 times shorter . 
  i heard only speculations that the kerch strait is too wavy to build a pontoon bridge , or maybe that 's because of flow . 
  it was originally announced that russia will biuld a bridge to crimea , but appatently we have no technology and resources to do that in short time . 
  [ this dancing bridge in volgograd ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwp5d2t2jve ) was built in 2009 , it took ** 13 years ** and the bridge is ~ ~ 10 ~ ~ 3 times shorter than kerch strait in the narrowest place . 
  it 's necessary to organise a massive supply , doing so using tiny ferries is insane but well all recent events are . 
  now they are seizing all ferries they can all over the country , my region too [ ` presented ' a ferry to crimea ] ( http://63.ru/text/newsline/780821.html?full=3#comments/c780821/page/3 ) .
