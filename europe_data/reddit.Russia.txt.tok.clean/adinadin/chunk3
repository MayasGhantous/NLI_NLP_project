  i only heared about some activists from united russia who tried to report stores for selling sanctioned products , but generally everything is still on shelves , kind of . 
  in my city most of finnish butter or lithuanian cheese is sold out already as people bought those in bulk . 
  * a vice-minister of economy development wrote on his facebook how stupid russian economic policy is and apologized to the citizens for ruined economy , and was immediately fired . 
  also illegally , the law forbidding criticism of government for officials was found unconstitutional by constitutional court .

  * activists investigating state officials ' illegal property were assaulted by pro-government thugs who were protected by police , and then arrested .

  ] ( http://www.mintrans.ru/news/detail.php?element_id=22538 ), 
  soviets ' goal was to simplify and all the written languages to optimise mass-production of books , i 'm sure they had problems with arabic script . 
  they simplified russian also significantly , some characters were liquidated even to save on paper and ink literally . 
  looking from the inside i do n't see any person who considers stalin or chernobil as something foreign at a time , this all and many other soviet problems are taught in schools as ours problems and it ca n't be different as we all are affected . 
  though i can imagine you 're talking about people making counter-agruments when they see someone accusing russians as ethnicity in all the troubles in ussr related history , in this kind of arguments both sides are typically backwards nationalists . 
  and `` obama started maidan '' type of thing like the most of recent propaganda inventions are not a representation of what russians think , it 's made to influence what we think and at this scale of media control it works very effectively . 
  actually most of post-soviet nuclear projects are largely dependent on western technology like french turbines or german automation . 
  any event related to russian military is covered everywhere now and that 's reasonable . 
  though even your link says this event is usual and is planned in advance . 
  i would expect a larger than planned scale of the training if it 's related to current events but i do n't know what was planned and there 's nothing about that in the article . 
   mobilization of reservists i thought it 's a mistake in your translation , but you 're probably serious . 
  it 's not a mobilization but a [ military training ] ( http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%92%d0%be%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b5_%d1%81%d0%b1%d0%be%d1%80%d1%8b#.d0.a1.d0.be.d0.b1.d1.80.d0.b0.d0.bd.d0.b8.d0.b5 ) which are ran yearly no matter of current conflicts . 
  you make a very good news coverage , and you see what a terrible things are going on in russia , you do n't really need to exaggerate the neutral ones . 
   i do n't connect how this list of events and sources leads to russia 's willingness for a big war see / u/3dom 's previous news compilations , he loves to add tabloid style summary before the news , in sarcastic way . 
  i do n't watch russian tv news for a very long time , i did n't know about alternatives when i first became interested in news somwtime in 2000s and already all that was available on tv then is putin in multiple reports in every single news block , during the duma and president elections in 2011-2012 it was already impossible for any sane person to watch tv news because propaganda went crazy to the point of news host calling an opposition candidate hitler and putin calling people who do n't support him monkeys ( banderlogi ) in prime time news show on the most popular tv channel . 
  so i ca n't objectively tell you what 's going on in tv recently , that shit can give nausea and make you concerned about your mental health . 
  unfortunately it 's hard to avoid tv completely since my relatives watch it so i can tell you that any prime time show now is interrupted several times to tell urgent news in special voice which is typically used to dub classified experts to not reveal their real voice , and they tell mostly about ukrainian events , numbers of deaths and what bombs ukraine shot where . 
  all the other news in russian i get on internet in reddit-like community of people who share my views so most of new kremlin propaganda inventions discussed there are already discussed here as well . 
  by the way some of those truly propaganda-free shows were maximovskaya 's work back on old ntv until it was closed , then on tvs until it was closed , and even though her rentv show was clearly ( self ) censured it still was the best news show on mainstream tv . 
  i hope my impression of her did n't turn wrong since recent events , did n't watch the show for long time . 
  how turning the basket away can help when playing football if it 's higher than the goal and the pole is still in place ? 
  anyway i 'm more concerned about windows right behind the goals . 
  because terrorism threat you know ? 
  also you 're not allowed to take any photo on train stations or inside of a train , terrorists can use them to learn the location . 
  seriously , that 's the official motivation . 
  well i 'm ethnic russian and i was stopped , sure anecdotes do n't make statistics though . 
   russians are extremely racist against other russians from different regions it 's only a thing in moscow , less in st.petersburg , the reason is the state supported inequality . 
  if simplified all the state giant enterprises pay taxes in moscow , all of investments and social support goes to moscow , it 's the only city with decent wages ( average 2-5 times higher than average in other big cities ) and all of needed infrastructure , so people from all over the country relocate to moscow because they have no opportunities in their local cities and muscovites hate them for overcrowding the city . 
  also apartments in moscow are insanely expensive so locals who privatized apartments given by ussr are practically millioners and that does n't add sympathy of people whose property in other cities worth nothing in comparison , they think all of locals are rich , lazy and exploit all the other country , and muscovites think newcomers are poor because they are lazy and dumb . 
  it 's not required but police may harass you illegally if they think you 're suspicious and detain you for made up reason ( `` you look like a reported facial composite '' ) until you prove your identity . 
  never happened to me in other cities until i visited moskow and was questioned for papers on the 2nd day , officer not only wanted to see my passport but also a train ticket . 
   ukrainians are mongols never heard that , on the contrary `` russians are mongols '' is quite a popular narrative . 
  original referendum was scheduled too quick either . 
  troops on streets seriously frightened people and cutoff of ukrainian tv channels along with propaganda on russian ones was the most important violation . 
  most of people do n't care about politics and ca n't make an informed decision in such environment . 
  the same is true for elections in russia by the way . 
  i think the result could have been different . 
  russia had permission to have troops on the navy base , not to deploy troops on the streets or to capture administrations . 
  i beleive that many of crimeans liked the idea of joining russia but there were no referendum . 
  you ca n't just place troops on the streets , capture local government , make a million blanks on office printers , announce a vote in a week , run it without a proper observation and call that a referendum . 
  apparently it 's not default in russia and uk . 
  i 'm from samara and we did n't have any arthodox ` activists ' messing in our city , it 's just the artists were discouraged from visiting us by their previous experience in russia . 
  i mostly talk about random people on internet so i 've no idea if they learned this lesson , fortunately it was already obvious for my friends . 
  the sad part is no matter of our political beliefs we have ho say in the current policies , no matter if you talk about a concert or a war . 
  russia is in desperate need of lustrations , even late would be better than none . 
  though the author in some points tries too much to manipulate the facts under his theory :  the only one that has as such support is navalny - but that 's only because it sometimes happens to him snarl on `` black '' , mention something about a great russia and throw meat . 
  one would think a person with author 's ideas wo n't cite the kremlin propaganda inventions ... 
  behemoth concert got cancelled in my city , now i 'm looking forward the cradle of filth concert in autumn . 
  hell i know some fellow metalheads who made fun of madonna or elton john fans for their problems with orthodox activists , i hope now they understand how important it is to stand for civil rights even when it 's not your personal rights were violated . 
  * few months ago two cars of an opposition activist were burned , recently police reported that [ they refuse to initiate a criminal case because they do n't see any crime in that ] ( http://domozhiroff.livejournal.com/332552.html ) . 
  * [ 140 people were poisoned , 34 hospitalized ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/food-poisoning-at-seliger/503845.html ) in a youth putin 's supporters summer camp seliger because of serious violations of sanitary norms . 
  i share your attitude to modern usage of swastika like this but it seems you did n't read or understand the article you linked , your quote does not state that swastika is not a part of slavic culture , it states that the word `` kolovrat '' as a name for slavic swastika is n't authentic . 
  typical marshrutka is not only a transport but also a dark humour stickers exhibition . 
  here are some classical ones : [ the place for hitting your head ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h3etmth.jpg ) above the exit door , [ ` somewhere here ' stop will be somewhere there ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lqi4ulk.jpg ) , [ ten minutes of terror and you 're home , ` come in , sit down , buckle up and shut up !, 
  ' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/upq0oy8.jpg ) , ' [ land - to the peasants , factories - to the workers , money - to the driver !, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ygr3glk.jpg?1 ) ' , ' [ slam the door , become a cripple ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wdjul2h.jpg ) ' , ` do n't drink and eat in marshrutka , the driver envies ' , [ customer is always right as long he 's alive ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uuzhlgg.jpg ) , ' [ want out ? 
  scream !, 
  unlike buses marshrutkas belong not to municipality or to a company but personally to the driver and he can do whatever he wants with it . 
  your numbers are way too low , number of all state workers is [ about 33mln people ] ( http://www.kp.ru/daily/26032.4/2948855/ ) ( link in russian ) if you count all state owned enterprises . 
  allegedly there were not enough time in dmitry kiselev 's 134 minutes long weekly news summary on a state owned tv channel with the biggest audience to tell anything about that moscow subway train accident . 
  political suicide only makes sense in democracies and not when you rig elections like putin used to . 
  also political suicide does n't happen by itself , it only happens via the media and since putin effectively controls all the media with significant audience in the country that 's not gon na happen . 
  having his resources you can convince majority of citizens in anything and without risking political suicide kill your opponents politically or phisically . 
  kremlin is trying to erase memories of gulag , political repressions and other outcomes of personality cult as [ the biggest museum of political repressions in russia is facing closure ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/russian-activists-rally-around-embattled-museum-sovietv-repression/25438139.html ) . 
  ~ ~ post is deleted now , anybody downloaded the attached videos ? ~ ~ videos were not deleted [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48yldsvfvmi ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhukqs9cq0w ) . 
  for me it 's clear that the point of this video is not `` no to war '' but `` usa is enemy '' , `` putin do n't want war '' , `` war is necessary '' , `` russia is not currently involved in lugansk and donetsk actions '' , `` crimea actions are ok to the point of not being worth mentioning '' , `` simple people have a say in russia 's foreign policy '' , `` all of patriots want putin to go war on ukraine '' , none of which are true . 
  also it 's not a `` single guy from vk '' but a youtube account with no videos but high quality anti-ukrainian propaganda , with a link to vk group devoted to pro-putin , anti-western , anti-ukrainian and anti-opposition content which was created right after maidan . 
  i imagine game devs pay not nearly as good as our ministry of truth . 
   better than those mutilations-propaganda it 's not better it 's just targeted on youth internet users while tv propaganda is for conservative adults and hence made differently . 
  that 's too little to say about russia . 
  if you have a business with windows on the first floor you 'll be fined by police for staying unsafe until you install bars on the windows . 
  then you 'll be fined by firefighters for staying unsafe until you remove bars from the windows . 
  and all that fun will repeat endlessly until you give bribes all of them . 
  sure it would be too naive to say all of them are kremlin bots , but given that there are so much evidence of pro-putin astroturfing a lot of them must be . 
  that 's true for the most of eu countries anyway . 
  maybe it 's one of better ones in russia . 
  we have a great place of [ the volga embarkment ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfe4l5navz8 ) , some nice parks , some beautiful historical and modern buildings little of wich you see on wikipedia , monuments , theaters , museums , churches and a great nature ( with tons of garbage ) . 
  you can come here and really enjoy visiting all of these for a week . 
  but if live here your samara have [ terrible roads ] ( https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1556&amp;bih=1037&amp;q=%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%8b+%d0%b2+%d1%81%d0%b0%d0%bc%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b5&amp;oq=%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%8b+%d0%b2+%d1%81%d0%b0%d0%bc%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b5&amp;gs_l=img.3...2196.9137.0.9257.32.13.0.19.9.0.134.1123.9j4.13.0....0...1ac.1.48.img..17.15.1055.2sm67adernc&amp;gws_rd=ssl ) , tons of garbage , dirt and dust , pollute air , lack and a shitty state of public transportation and traffic jams . 
  also the corrupt government , commie blocks , poor people , and insanity on all the media , but that 's russia overall . 
  late autumn in a gloomy weather adds a lot to depressiveness of that video and of course you can find a right place to enjoy a shiny summer , like [ the volga embarkment ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfe4l5navz8 ) , but it 's not like any weather can help those views of dirty streets which are 99 % of the city .

  surely it is .
