  in russia most people pay for district heating according to a size of a heating area , some install water meters on radiators . 
  in most cases the heat is technologically exessive and should be wasted so munitipalities which consume less heat th ** a ** n necessary are fined . 
  the joke is stupid but the pic is real , i saw it in live translation . 
  ogniem i mie ** c ** zem is great movie . 
  / r/ru is for bots . 
  actuall russian subs are / r/politota , / r/depra and linked ones . 
  these communities did n't start on reddit though but migrated here from russian sites . 
  there 's another solution , [ live aboard a boat ] ( http://www.reddit.com/search?q=london+live+boat&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ) , 
  iirc there should be 20 leaders , so probably 8 of them are somewhere nearby but out of shot . 
  $ 1k is good in most regions of russia except of big cities but these trolls are based in moscow which is one of most expensive cities in europe . 
  on these money in moscow you can only rent a shitty apartment far from city center or metro stations with little money left for food and other necessities . 
  probably most of these commenters are students living in dorms or lazy bastards inherided an apartment who do n't care to get a real job . 
  i 'm glad someone translated it to english . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/politota/comments/26v8qg/%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%b3%d0%be%d0%b4%d0%bd%d1%8f_%d0%bf%d0%be%d1%8f%d0%b2%d0%b8%d0%bb%d0%be%d1%81%d1%8c_%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%b4%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b6%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b5_%d1%82%d0%be%d0%bc%d1%83_%d1%87%d1%82%d0%be_%d0%b2_%d1%81%d0%b5%d1%82%d0%b8/ ) a list of some russian media who already wrote about these revealings ( some of them are blocked in russia though ) , but i ca n't find any serious articles in english . 
  have you seen any ? 
  btw it 's important that manager of this particular propaganda group [ confirmed ] ( http://burchik-ru.livejournal.com/838.html ) their activities . 
  a few years ago i 've participated in a contest in moscow and i noticed the team from kazan did n't compare their city to moscow but with russia and so i thought they do n't even consider themselves living in russia . 
  i do n't know much about their public sentiments though . 
   you know that i 'm talking about things like i would n't ever take opinion of any of [ these people ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y0xxio9.jpg ) seriously as representation of all people 's sentiments , and orchestrated audience 's reaction does n't add legitimacy to their words . 
  what kind of outrage you are talking about but that on media ? 
  also idk the statistics but i only see religious people among women over 60 , others may identify themselves with christianity but typically do n't visit church , do n't know rituals and if you ask them if they pray many would laugh and say no . 
  it 's not religion , it 's pop culture . 
  right , it 's like if you do n't socialize with anybody but young educated people you may do n't know in person any putin supporter . 
  i know the joke is stupid . 
  though nobody respect medvedev anyway , since his `` presidency '' he was popular target to [ all kinds of mocking ] ( http://i.imgur.com/e1hfs00.png ) and now looks like nobody remember him . 
  it 's not like iphone spoiled medvedev 's image , it 's more of on the contrary . 
  for a long time there is a joke in russia that only gays use apple , so itunes chart is no surprise , 
  [ not a time for smiling ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u9w0qlc.jpg ), 
  my favourite is ` rainbow in poland ', 
  and if there are more people than government allowed then organizers will be prosecuted on criminal offence . 
  anybody who invited their friends on social networks counts as organizers . 
  it 's not surprising that masses believe him since the only source of information available in convenient way is propaganda . 
  also russians ' quality of life now is higher than ever before , even is it 's ridiculously low by western standards . 
  media tells them that the west is the enemy , liberals are usa shills and blaming every problem of russia on them . 
  it seems nonsense that people believe that , but we have generations of people affected by this propaganda and oppression and we 've never ran lustrations . 
  last time lustrations was proposed in duma most vocal supporter was killed ( politkovskaya ) . 
  any real opposition have huge problems from home arrests to prison . 
  any independent media which do n't employ self-censorship is being closed ( there are few exceptions like echo moskvy but government keep it to brag about the freedom of speech ) . 
  there are no reason to expect something better from the masses while putin is in power . 
  i 'm glad that there are really a lot of people who do n't believe putin , want to do something with it , and their number grows , but sadly it 's not enough yet . 
  most of them can be perfectly described by your [ comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20gx0n/russian_ruble_falls_to_lowest_level_since_more/cg375ty ) . 
  that 's true , you only miss the part that the same was done to russians . 
  is it serious ? 
  i just thought it 's wait half a year or pay for yourself . 
  wow it should looks impressive , like terracotta army of communism . 
  what is name of that place , to find some images ? 
  propaganda machine is always on , since putin 's first term most of important tv channels and other media was seized by government and controlled companies , and propaganda goes crazier and crazier . 
  lately it 's just scary to live here and see what govt is trying to stuff in your head . 
  how is it reasonable to be angry against the entire ethnicity when the offender is the state ? 
  ussr was and russia is close to a totalitarian state , which offends all its citizens no matter of etnicity , including russians . 
  half of soviet leaders was not ethnical russians . 
  would it be reasonable in any way for russians to blame soviet atrocities on that entire nations because of it ? 
  that all does n't make sense . 
  people are personally responsible for their actions , not nations . 
  that is real and even routine , [ anyone who oppose putin is literally hitler on russian tv . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/8ey5zpruhae?t=40s ), 
  nothing can stop him from changing the constitution again to make his next term even longer . 
  nothing surprising , propaganda works . 
  they are heavily promoted on state tv during elections periods , and every now and then they still are allowed to say couple words on prime time tv news . 
  prohorov was dropped from the system but at least kremlin did n't run campaigns against him like against nemtsov or other real opposition . 
   in russia 45 % knew about him that only tells that 55 % of russians know nothing about russian politics . 
  it 's not about / r/europe alone , they are everywhere . 
  recently i made a comment criticizing putin in / r/worldnews , not even very important one , not even about recent events , just funny one . 
  but still someone bothered to register some new accounts to tell that my comment is irrelevant , is a lie or to ask for proof like if i did n't already link some . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/erkscyenrs ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/gg69 ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/kkmanrs ) and few others were deleted . 
  dobrynin as well critisized a bunch of other crazy policies of the state like inciting homophobia , idolisation of the great patriotic war , the ban on adoption of russian children by foreigners , the ban on media mentioning the reasons behind a rising number of suicides among cancer patients ( namely the war on drugs ) , etc. 
  with no result obviously . 
  it was also announced a month ago that he 's going to be removed from the senate soon , he said it 's by his own initiative though . 
  also i did n't find any info on him making bold moves like voting against the most resonant laws , probably he did n't register for such votes . 
  sure pictures above do n't depict the average quality of life but they are not that far from it . 
  i 'd say it 's a typical communal apartment ( one with private rooms but kitchens and bathrooms shared among a few families ) but a typical private apartment is significantly better but still would look hideous for some . 
  i tried to find an affordable rental in moscow recently and saw a lot of apartments that looked worse . 
  well there also was a period of democracy with overly liberal but not so much functional government that allowed bolshevicks to gain strength and start another revolution . 
  it was over just a couple years ago . 
  i do n't feel like going deep into this debate again . 
  i know part of my father 's business was unfriendly taken over by their client , a state company , only because most of other clients were state companies too and they played along as a team in the key moment , so i 'd find it hard to believe in lack of threat of this sort for other businesses even if there were no publicly known examples . 
  all the founders of the company are russians and i used to think of their st petersburg , russia office as the headquarters because they hire mostly there , i have no idea where they founded it formally though . 
  most of successful it businesses originated in russia are registered in foreign jurisdictions and sometimes even relocate completely to protect themselves from the state . 
  even foreign jurisdiction does n't help companies that rely on russian customers so companies like yandex are forced to issue golden shares to the state or sell the company to the state friendly business like vk . 
  basically the author demonstrated evidence that dozens of pro-putin websites are associated with only a few interlinked web analytics accounts hence are managed by the same people , and also many of their domains are associated with the person listed as the head of seo department in the leaked staff list of ` troll factory ' saintpetersburg office . 
  also that seo head wrote on a social network that he worked together with another person from the list . 
  so there are no new huge revelations in the article , it just adds more legitimacy to documents leaked from ` troll factory ' by hackers and infiltrated journalists . 
  mainstream russian web is as full of propaganda as the state tv if not worse . 
  social networks are owned by pro-putin oligarchs ( typically previous owners were bullied into selling ) and biggest news agregators are clearly tampered with by bots to form the top news list . 
  the best opposition websites are inacsessible without proxies/vpn as well as many others that can be blocked any time without a court . 
  big websites are just businesses so they try to not be blocked and instantly lose all profits , they adopt self-censure . 
  comment sections and forums are full of paid putin-lovers and local bloggers are often openly supported by local governments to praise them . 
  crazy money apparantly is put into seo of propaganda websites so a casual internet user will not find anything better on political topict not knowing exactly what they are looking for . 
  so there is little chance for casual internet users to run into any political read but propaganda , all sources worth reading are more or less obscure . 
  and even if they do an indoctrinated person would reject those sources as western propaganda they are told about constantly on tv . 
  lately there are much more qualified work visa seekers with job offers from american companies than actual visas so dos runs a lottery to to issue visas to the lucky ones . 
  why would anyone peel a kiwifruit ? 
  it 's like eating salo with no skin on a bread without top crust !, 
  i think he does n't , he tried to explain his [ original question ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3a68nr/sweden_announces_first_centre_for_raped_men/cs9ovh4 ) . 
  it does n't necessary happen when waking up so it 's possible to never notice . 
  some men ? 
  do n't most men get boners for no reason and for non-sexual reasons like morning wood , strong urge to pee or just rubbed against underwear ? 
  it 's not a problem to force a man to have a boner , well if he has no problems getting a boner otherwise . 
  exactly . 
  it 's a legit question and crying sexism over something that could as well be properly answered is highly unprofessional , it 's a part of her job to give press conferences but she gives bad publicity to everyone involved -- the journalist , the space agency , and all women in men dominated work -- no one wants to work with a person easily offended by a mere nothing .
