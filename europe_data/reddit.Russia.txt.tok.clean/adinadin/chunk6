  ] ( https://youtu.be/koij7agonhm?t=15s ), 
  i 'd love the [ comments section to be alligned on the left with other elements . 
  why would n't they shell ~ ~ themselves ~ ~ civilians for powerful propaganda picture if [ they do shell themselves just for shits and giggles anyway ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgib0c1ffao ) ? 
  for putin driving russia into isolation is a sure way to keep his power , i do n't believe it was his plan only because his money is abroad . 
  much more likely he did n't expect to meet any substantial response from the west . 
  apparently destabilising ukraine is still more important to him than prosperity of russia . 
  and the whole argument of ` less than desirable ' success of new ukrainian government does n't make any sense when all the resources has to be wasted on defence from foreign aggression . 
   russia was in a better shape than ever it could be at the highest point but a massive chrisis was expected , in 2011 putin promised huge growth of social spendings , the budget was prepared with unreasonable expectations of oil prices and the finance minister was forced out of office for criticism of these policies . 
  then after the protests the budget was fixed to spend even more on law enforcement and propaganda with no regards to financial risks . 
  when it came to cutting spending on humanitarian articles and pension funds being seized to cover budget deficit with no perspectives to improve the financial situation putin had reasons to expect social unrest unless patriotism was boosted in another way , especially with a potentially inspiring example in ukraine . 
  in fact that 's true , [ russia nationalised over 250 private companies in crimea ] ( http://ria.ru/economy/20150227/1050081202.html ) as of february as well as all of those owned by ukrainian state . 
  then there are messages about companies being raid seized by not exactly clear who . 
  it does not in any way contradict to the fact that russia invests a lot of money into crimea . 
  in fact we had to [ lend an equal territory to china ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4blw98j.jpg ) to afford that . 
  did n't fbi admit no actual terrorism activity was revealed with help of that massive surveillance program ? 
  it looks just like another security theatre with swating random people who just happened to need a pressure cooker at a wrong time . 
  anyone in us can make explosives at home without coordination or with using actual secure communications , or buy a gun if they are going to commit an act of terror . 
  no surveilance can stop all of terrorism acts . 
  to prevent major attacs it would be more effective to work against sources of wahhabi indoctrination and funding instead of partnering with them . 
  it 's not the problem what they do in their private life , only what they do professionally -- ruin their own and neighboring countries and lie all the time . 
  according to that girl who infiltrated the troll factory and now is suing them the workers do n't actually believe in things they write . 
  just like our top level trolls from the state tv hosts up to the president who all have their families and vacations in europe and us only visiting sochi for a good tv picture . 
  for the same reason some people would n't eat cat or dog meat , it 's not in their culture . 
  people are just not rational about what they eat . 
  kudrin resigned exactly because the federal budget was prepared with unreasonable risks coming from putin 's populism in social spending , growing military spendings , increasing dependance on oil and was to inevitably drive russia into economic crisis . 
  according to him he had no authority to change the budget and publicly criticized its project long before and apparently it was not the first budget prepared in conflict with his opinion especially remembering he was in the best traditions of russian politics called both unpatriotic and fascist by mainstream politicians for trying to resist the party policy . 
  i do n't know if he had enough influence to make major changes in russian economy at any time of his carreer but i 'm sceptical about it knowing about total submission of other state institutions here to the single person . 
  they thought it 's murica . 
  you 're right , i was mistaken by my grandparents ' stories as they managed to get their passports and get into a technicum in 1949 , now grandmother explained it to me . 
  she said they were incredibly lucky of that and even though in late 40s many people from her village were allowed to go to a factory or to continue education a little later it became almost impossible for a long time . 
  apparently they were just in a right time in a right place in a region with many factories evacuated from moscow and total lack of workers right after the war . 
  ~ ~ you could leave for a college and then to whatever new place your college appoints you . ~ ~, 
  or 99 % of russia btw, 
  yeah , i should have given more context , samara is a megalopolis , one of the biggest and most developed russian cities and not some forgotten town . 
  it 's just only moscow , saint petersburg and few other places were somewhat reliably supplied even with necessities , especially in harder times . 
  it 's a local chain , mediamarkt uses magenta-white color scheme here because their usual colors were already taken before their expansion to russia . 
  this is not even close to the worst . 
  in this video you can spot multiple different meat products and virtually no lines !, 
  in the end of the video a grandma tries to figure whether she have enough cash to also take meat croquettes already having a full grocery basket . 
  when my parents visited moscow ( not just in worst times but in different years ) they used to buy as much meat and sausages as they could realistically eat or bring back to samara . 
  muscovites looked at them like on crazy for buying so much , and back home people could n't believe they were able to buy so much or any at all even though it was n't as bad all the time . 
  that is nothing new , a legitimate opposition in russia is heavily discriminated against by all kinds of businesses . 
  it 's not easy to find a company that would print something unwanted by officials , set up billboards , publish ads on social networks or even on radio , rent a place for a meeting with supporters . 
  even transport companies refused to work with navalny during his compaign for moscow 's mayor elections . 
  rare business here would risk being persecuted by officials for simply providing services to opposition . 
  there are even incidents when top ad companies refused to set up billboards with quotes from constitution , because it 's too liberal for russian reality lately . 
  things like polygyny or forced marriage are not legal in chechnya , it 's just governed by kadyrov 's criminal clan and not actual law . 
  i took the graphs from [ this article ] ( http://trv-science.ru/2011/12/20/matematika-vyborov-2011/ ) , and there are a lot more great stuff in the magazine . 
  also [ comparison of statistics between elections in russia and other countries ] ( http://esquire.ru/elections ) from the same author with commentaries from other experts . 
  here are graphs for 2011 duma elections in moscow only : [ districts by turnout ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mfkpvli.jpg ) , [ votes for each party in 1 % of votes by district turnout ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tiocyoq.jpg ) . 
  it 's also interesting that results from districts with automatic ballot boxes look much less anomalous : [ automatic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6xoumwq.jpg ) , [ manually counted ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ak8a709.jpg ) . 
  problem with this comparison is that in 2011 automatic boxes were evenly distributed around country , but there is also comparison from previous elections when automatic boxes were only in one or two regions ( moscow , saint petersburg ) , here is turnout with automatic - blue and manual - orange boxes : [ 2007 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mv6trl6.jpg ) , [ 2008 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i2chmvw.jpg ) , [ 2009 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mjrb7ki.jpg ) , in all these elections automatic boxes gave about 10 percentage points worse results for putin/united russia until 2009 when manual and automatic results were identical ( they probably learned how to fix them by that time ) . 
  ok , i 've never touched a gun but i assumed that poor training plus a lot of shooting over the long time can result in bruises at first and callous later , googled recoil bruise and not only found that it is a thing but that also they make special pads and other shoulder protection to prevent it . 
  militants could have signs of recoil and other easily identifiable suspicious traumas . 
  it 's also in the report , the parents who were willing to stay silent were offered about 55000 euro for signing non-disclosure agreements , the others were threatened with criminal prosecution . 
  the car does n't look particularly heavy , [ a group of fairly drunk people could easily pick it up and put it somewhere fun like this . 
  most probably , but i do n't know details . 
  moscow for sure had a lot of infrastructure that could n't have been evacuated , i just added another reason why taking moscow would n't have been immidiately fatal for ussr . 
  especially considering that key parts of the government and moscow industry were evacuated to kuybyshev ( samara ) about a thousand kilometers east back in october 1941 and the nazis came closest to moscow in december . 
  sure , those are the fastest growing for the last several years , with twice of usual increase in 2015 ( [ top row in the table ] ( https://v1.std3.ru/ea/fa/1411076593-eafa8c94c5a78d75dd8a93c2abb67986.png ) ) . 
  you 're right but most of these reallocations of federal spending from humanitarian articles to propaganda , police , security and defence were actually planned around 2011-2012 when voters showed some residual self respect in response to massive electoral fraud during last duma ( parliament ) and president 's elections . 
  [ * article about these budget reallocations from 2012 . 
  ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.gazeta.ru%2ffinancial%2f2012%2f07%2f18%2f4684733.shtml&amp;edit-text= ), 
  apart from speculations there is a glaring objective factor -- putin largely cut healthcare budgets , moved many healthcare spendings to the local budgets ( that are very slim in most regions and are controlled by putin again -- most of governors are appointed by him personally while others were ` recommended ' to be elected and locally collected taxes also go first to moscow and then distributed ) to increase ` defence ' and police budgets . 
  there is planned [ reduction of 35 % in healthcare budget in 2013 -- 2017 period ] ( http://www.rosmedlib.ru/pages/p_release-1.html ) while there is already growing deficit and the population is aging fast increasing the number of expected patients . 
  also some western medicaments and equipment were affected by ` counter sanctions ' imposed on russia by putin . 
  there even were healthcare worker rallies in many places because of massive lay offs and salary reductions . 
  it was confusing and kind of fun to watch as state healthcare workers are putin 's huge supporters and even on rallies they tried to avoid criticizing the government not seeing the root of all problems . 
   stalinskaya i bet they wanted to capitalize on stolichnaya brand , the name is very similar and the lable is in the same color scheme . 
  many progressive people from regions relocate to moscow , and that influences the voting pattern a lot . 
  also electoral fraud is far more prevalent outside of moscow . 
  there are protests in regions ( you would n't hear about those in media , try google ) , they are small because the situation with media in regions is uncomparably worse than in moscow -- your local events are covered and sometimes promoted on echo , dozhd , by top bloggers , we have none of that , and local activists are much more vulnerable without media coverage . 
  \\* [ according to polls only 36 % of people living in moscow were born there . 
  ] ( http://fom.ru/obshchestvo/11200 ) moscow is comparatively progrossive because it is the only location in the country with decent economic situation ( on the expense of the rest of the country ) so the most mobile professionals from all regions relocate there and they naturally tend to be progressive . 
  i always wondered why if it 's cold enough to cover your shin with wool would n't people want to also cover their knees ? 
  i mean for me knees are the first parts of my legs to get cold , and also cold knees are easier to injure . 
  at least some people whose correspondence with prokopenko was leaked confirmed the messages are genuine . 
  [ here is confirmation from rbc media group ceo nikolay molibog ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20150403092849/https://www.facebook.com/nmolibog/posts/10205633964041327 ) ( in russian ) . 
  goose step is called stamp step / \u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0448\u0430\u0433 in russian . 
  euromaidan is presented as nazi revolution backed by us . 
  east of ukraine and crimea are saved from inevitable extermination of all russian population . 
  with constant flow of top level crazy stories that are easy to disprove but there is a new story every day ( about children crucified by fascists , about ukrainian state granting their soliders the land and two russian slaves , about use of non-conventional weapons , etc. ), 
  and also there is no media to spread unbiased information , that is treated as extremism and media are banned , closed , pressured administratively . 
  putin is just portrayed as the only world leader condemning the fascists and defending russian people . 
  also it 's important that putin cleansed russian political arena and all potential politicians who could challenge him are killed , put in prison , forced out of the country or just out of politics . 
  it was propaganda attack . 
  all the mainstream media in russia is owned or controlled by the state , and it pictured ( and still does so ) recent events like attack by fascists on russian people . 
  the same message is pushed on internet using astrotorfing of impressive intensity . 
  even mainstream social networks and interwebs are owned ( often just taken ) by the state-friendly business . 
  people have alternative sources of information on the internet but are convinced it 's just propaganda from the other side . 
  it just does n't matter if something happened or not , if anyone has monopoly on information , they dictate what happens and control their audience . 
  most of those ' 85 % support putin ' polls have sample size of 1600 though . 
  probably increasing that number will give you more precise data , but not significantly so . 
  what these maps do n't show is what percentage of gays come out , but i doubt it 's possible to reliably gather data like that . 
  i guess this problem with finding gays is the explanation of sample size lower than for other countries normalized by population . 
  also i 'm sure there is significant percentage of people who do n't support putin but would n't ` come out ' to a pollster making an unexpected phone call . 
  when every mainstream media calls you a traitor of a nation you 're not less unlikely to reveal yourself as if you 're called sexually deviant . 
  it 's not their content that makes them opposition , it 's the state policy that treats unbiased media as extremism . 
  if you try you can remember that russia recognized impossibility of visa-free agreement with eu but refused to fix our internal problems to make that possible .
