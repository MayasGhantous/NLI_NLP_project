  here was an [ epic post recently about a flood of newly registered pro-putin trolls ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2xk1kr/brigade_attack_on_reurope_today/ ) ( [ it was removed but confirmed by mods ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2xk1kr/brigade_attack_on_reurope_today/cp0vlqj ) ) . 
  i 've also seen that in other subs like worldnews . 
  of course there is no proof of it being organized by kremlin but some organized pro-putin trolling certainly exists on reddit . 
  corrections are upvoted when the corrected user replies writing that it was helpful . 
  and sometimes i receive some helpful language advice because of my flair , more often in pms though . 
  maybe we should popularize the flairs like mine or add a special ` language learner ' flag . 
  [ the original article ] ( http://www.mr7.ru/articles/112478/ ) lists few hundreds of accounts , i checked some random usernames but did n't find any match on reddit . 
  either this particular office ( saint petersburg , savushkina str . ), 
  only targets the most popular in russia platforms like livejournal , or just nobody working on tasks targeted on westerners leaked anything yet . 
  * there is actually a leaked document about targeting facebook in english in [ the older article ] ( http://www.mr7.ru/articles/102680/ ) . 
  it seems not less realistic to me that hair by increasing the speed of water evaporating will slow down bacterial activity which needs water . 
  someone should probably research which of these hypotheses is true . 
  anyway if your armpits smell , hair is not going to make it significantly worse . 
  why not solve the real problem -- bacterial activity producing the odor , instead of trying to prevent the odor from presumably spreading a little bit faster ? 
  there is a variety of deodorants that eliminate odor completely . 
  the one i use should only be applied once a week and for the whole week my underarms do n't smell at all , even the deodorant 's own smell is hard to notice . 
  there were multiple attempts to install the [ billboards with quotes from the constitution ] ( https://translate.google.ru/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.znak.com%2furfo%2farticles%2f04-02-11-16%2f100270.html&amp;edit-text= ) in yeatekrinburg , in moscow , some of them successful but every time the quotes about the rights for peaceful rallies and about the secularity of the state were banned by local authorities or not accepted by the ad companies self-censuring out of fear of possible punishment by the authorities . 
  [ these people decided to radically save on banners ] ( http://i.imgur.com/617rz7t.jpg ) to afford inevitable fines . 
  that 's because every single day he takes a significant amount of air time in the news coverage on multiple tv channels , and when they have no recent footage they cover some week old meetings without mentioning the date or invent something more elaborate but still show a ton of putin . 
  that 's true about domestic media but i doubt any significant number of russian speakers watch russia today . 
  you 're talking like industrialization , improvement of healthcare , working conditions , and education started only because of bolsheviks ' will and not before them . 
  like serfdom was n't dismantled half a century before the revolution . 
  like if not bolsheviks there would be a czar and not the democratic government established after the february revolution which was so liberal that freed bolsheviks and other opposition out of prisons or allowed them back into the country from abroad , and as liberal in other policies , too liberal as that killed them by those terrorists ' hands . 
  on your edit : i ask for help with my english because i want to improve and not necessary know it very badly , i would n't ask someone but a paid teacher to find my mistakes if i knew that i make really a lot of them . 
  i comment this much on russian politics because it 's a topic that is hot both personally for me and here on reddit . 
  i first started commenting in order to get some extra english practice but even before the olympics and ukrainian events not often i encountered other discussions that i 'm both interested in and can contribute to . 
  and now i 'm somewhat used to it , reddit is one of two online communities i 'm frequent to and the only one in english . 
  as i understand english `` rather than '' would make it choosing between the two , but i see there comparison in the slogan , so i feel like `` better '' is more correct . 
  they show some random phrase of navalny out of context ( `` if i 'd want you to crash cars , set fires or something , i will tell you so '' omitted `` but i do n't want that , we are law abiding citizens and want a peacefull protest so please ignore all provocateurs and do n't look for implications . 
  '' ) , then show the blogpost of some sketchy somewhat kremlin friendly nationalist ( who now goes full novorossia ) prising navalny , then the host says something like * you know who also was praised with similar words ? 
  literally hitler !, 
  * * by literally goebbels !, 
  they imply * not much better actually * , that they are comparable . 
  nothing wrong in comparing , it 's just when they control all mainstream media they practically have the power to put strong assiciations in minds of over 100 million people , to define who is the nazi and who is the good guy . 
  they show dirt poor wwii veterans struggling with paying utilities and putin all the time personally helping them . 
  they film shitton of movies about wwii to remind that nazis are bad and we are the good guys . 
  they scratch this wound from the birth to play on taught emotions , to boost our emotions to the extent that any reasoning is suppressed , so that if they call someone nazi it becomes atrocious to argue , or else you becomes enemy and nazi yourself . 
  that 's not just in the west of course , for example when he imprisoned khodorkovsky people protested with this slogan : [ putin is better than hitler ] ( https://std3.ru/40/85/1369453072-40850d030a29d07e0d73b99edf39e016.jpeg ) . 
  around 2011-12 duma and presidents elections there was a period when omon members were demonstratively gifted apartments in moscow by the state as a compensation for any injury caused by a protester , so there was a huge number of cases where omon claimed being assaulted in ridiculous ways with no evidence .

  dot in urls is often dropped in speech and dots above \u0451 are often dropped in writing . 
  but it 's not accumulated wealth that is taxed but income , expensive real estate , so people that saved a million for retirement over decades are not affected by taxes as much as a stereotypical millionaire . 
  putin gave and lent a number of territories to china over years . 
  the anthem was actually changed and there was [ another anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrol0fuutyu ) with no lyrics during the 90s , but as putin became the president he returned the soviet one with little changes . 
  i 'm not able to make any good translation , but as he died [ there was a joke ] ( http://ivand.livejournal.com/1161143.html ) as he presents the anthem for paradise to saint peter but got thrown to the hell obviously and writes a new anthem for the hell as he falls there , all anthems made in the same style of course . 
  is it only a controversy because it happens on an independent tv channel ? 
  because living in samara i used to see anchorwomen in hijabs on tv quite often , there are 15-20 % muslims in the region . 
  [ they air news targeted at muslim population on rossia 1 ] ( http://russia.tv/video/show/brand_id/3959/episode_id/1154696/video_id/1111431/ ) , state owned and second most popular channel , in regional sections . 
  i used to think it also happens in many other regions , i mean not only in chechnya . 
  [ so they do their usual trick . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/489g6n/z/d0i0m0x ),

  did you read the dialog ? 
  the offended believer started it , and exactly by applying ` parts unacceptable in modern world ' ( god  man  woman ) to the present as a universal wisdom . 
  this guy is n't known for any political activity and his business ( blacksmith ) is unlikely related , just two religious law students were offended or bored enough to fuck with him , maybe they hope to promote their careers this way . 
  no much need for that . 
  even though someone can always find something offensive or extremist with those broad definitions our laws use and report me , i doubt reddit will share data with russian police . 
  i do n't write on russian forums . 
  well , it 's quite depressive . 
  obviously reading about russia on reddit ca n't give you an actual image of what happens here and mostly exceptional stories are posted . 
  to see roughly how it is on average better look at some statistics , indexes , like [ oecd better life index ] ( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/#/33333335553 ) where you can choose what is more important to you . 
  have a look at [ corruption perception index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_perceptions_index ) , [ press freedom index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/press_freedom_index ) and [ democracy index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democracy_index ) , [ government restrictions on religious freedom ] ( https://www.ksl.com/?sid=22280815 ) or whatever else you care about . 
  anyway i do n't feel like western media or reddit posters have a goal to portray russia worse than it is , or if so they are not successful at it . 
  for one i do n't remember seeing any article in english about judge novikov . 
  it 's a russian federal judge who started fighting corruption in judical system ( in russian court , so obviously with no much success ) , [ and told in details how it works ] ( http://theins.ru/korrupciya/2810 ) in multiple interviews and his blog . 
  but there are a lot of articles lacking many important details or simply low effort . 
  also his opponents deleted a bunch of their messages before reporting him to police , and judge denied his lawyer 's request to restore and present those messages . 
  who 's going to discharge them , [ bastrykin ] ( http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/08/the-rise-and-probable-fall-of-putins-enforcer/278577/ ) ? 
  the guy was forced in a psych ward for a month for evaluation , ironically that was a possible punishment for believers in the ussr . 
  also police called his mother 's job to recommend firing her because her son is an extremist . 
  his voice spectrum and genetic meterial were taken for some anti-extremism data base , before the court decision . 
  police also threatened to charge him with hooliganism and other administrative charges , planted gun ammunitions on him and did n't act on it - just for intimidation . 
  [ link in russian .

  russia : * [ russian lawmakers make it harder for journalists to report from polling stations during elections ] ( https://meduza.io/en/news/2016/03/01/sick-of-breaking-up-illegal-rallies-police-say-russia-s-authorities-have-made-it-too-hard-to-get-a-permit ) * [ a musician ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lqe86eqf9u ) performing on the street was [ fined as an ` organizer of illegal rally ' ] ( https://ovdinfo.org/express-news/2016/02/25/ispolnitel-na-pile-oshtrafovan-na-desyat-tysyach-za-igru-na-ulice ) because too much people stopped by . 
  * [ sick of breaking up illegal rallies , even police say russia 's authorities have made it too hard to get a permit ] ( https://meduza.io/en/news/2016/03/01/sick-of-breaking-up-illegal-rallies-police-say-russia-s-authorities-have-made-it-too-hard-to-get-a-permit ), 
  most of the past key figures in chechnya were killed , some of them abroad , allegedly some of them by kadyrov 's clan too . 
  i doubt it would be safe for him to lose control in chechnya and try to enjoy life somewhere else . 
  my guess is you have no idea what are you talking about . 
  we had to hire a nurse for my grandma and we went through several of them , real ` qualified ' nurses and not migrants but mostly from out of city , with ` references ' , and found through agencies , payed 30k in samara ( significantly more valuable than 50k in moscow ) and still failed to find someone who did more good than harm and did n't steal . 
  so if they managed to find a decent one even if a migrant without formal qualification , good for them . 
  i bet a majority though , and often for a reason . 
  actually i 've looked up the polls and the first time more russians got positive attitudes about our police was [ since 2012 which is generally attributed \\ ( even by state officials \\ ) to pro-state propaganda ] ( http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2604039 ) that raged on central tv all the way since 2011 with unprecedented elections preparations . 
  it 's almost unrealistic that he would leave the office voluntary or peacefully , most probably he hopes for putin to say that he ca n't just leave chechnya without such a great governor . 
  the rest are minor details of implementation , but resemblance with the trick used in other regions is obvious . 
  in kadyrov 's case the media campaign seems huge compared to election preparations in other regions and probably it 's the grand repetition of upcoming putin 's elections of 2018 .
