  but otherwise it 's a very typical ritual for russian politics , most of russian governors ( heads of regions , presidents of republics , etc. ), 
  resign a little bit before elections to let putin appoint them as acting official and demonstrate every local official ( from mayors through school teachers who until recently used to play the key role in electoral fraud as most electoral stations are based at schools and most electoral staff is formed from administratively subdued school teachers , but now it seemingly moves to higher electoral commissions ) who putin wants in his power vertical . 
  also sometimes this trick breaks the election schedule and they are rescheduled earlier making it much harder for any opposition to participate . 
  just look at this list of regional elections in russia , most of them are rescheduled earlier for this reason : https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0412\u044b\u0431\u043e\u0440\u044b_\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432_\u0441\u0443\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432_\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439_\u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 search for '' \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0440\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0431\u043e\u0440\u044b '' in page and highlight all for clarity . 
  i 'm sure there still are some , as a huge business and an obvious source of bribes , they 'd rather milk those than close . 
  if you 're paid in rubles and not even get indexation against official 13 % inflation , it 's already a solid reason co consider moving even to eastern europe to get a better wage in eur equivalent with comparable cost of living . 
  getting a work visa in some eu countries is trivial for russians , for example in poland russians , ukrainians and belarussians only need an invitation letter from employer to work there up to 3 months , and the proper visa will be processed while you are already on the job . 
  i know a guy working two full time jobs and studying on weekends ( even if informally ) to get out of his situation . 
  you also do n't really need a higher education to improve your quality of life , many big cities lack it/software workforce and do n't require degrees or much skills actually for entry level , and any of those positions will improve your situation tremendously , you can also learn that from home instead of wasting your time on reddit . 
   to get a card , one needs to demonstrate documented proof of ancestors living in poland in 1921-1939 . 
  poland at that time included the current western belarusian territories . 
  alternatively , one must make a considerable contribution to polish culture to receive the card . 
  is learning the language and history enough ? 
  i do n't know what exactly are you talking about , but there are a lot of objects named both \u041c\u0438\u0440 ( either world or peace ) and \u041c\u0438\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 ( peaceul ) . 
  in context of russian empire \u043c\u0438\u0440 also meant ` society ' in the narrow and broad meaning . 
  many employers only cover the cheapest tickets available for business trips which most often are 3rd class train tickets . 
  i saw something like this on tv , other times they just announce that some icon or relic was flown around the disaster . 
  probably not the same company . 
  among newer models there 's [ orion for example ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zimwx6baue ) but it 's [ not very safe yet ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuesr8dfjhi ) . 
  there 're also [ a few ] ( https://youtu.be/5h2gmaroszc ) smaller [ models ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hopgfvmdfya ) . 
  and every time there is a massive forest or peatery fire [ they show similar freakshow on tv ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8cnl3t5.jpg ) . 
  muesli is not only a real cereal . 
  semolina is also popular , especially as a school and kindergarten food . 
  most of these jokes i heard first from my parents , none of them from internet , similar humour was massively popular in all parts of ussr . 
  one prisoner asks another : - what were you convicted for ? 
  - i was a plumber and got called to the politburo to fix a faucet , but when i saw it i said : `` it 's all rotten , we should change the whole system here ! '', 
  ___ a man sees a small bronze cat statue at the bazaar , and asks : - how much ? 
  - it 's 1 ruble for the cat , and 10 rubles for the story . 
  - just the cat please . 
  - ok , but you will return to hear the story anyway !, 
  so the man goes away and notices that all stray cats are following him , he starts running but ca n't escape and he throws the statue into a river and all the cats jump in water and drown . 
  he runs back and is greeted by the seller : - i knew you was going to return for the story !, 
  - fuck your story !, 
  do you have a small bronze communist ? 
   for falsifying signatures . 
  practice shows you 're refused to register even when you have double checked signatures , [ the signers present as a witnesses and video evidence of them making a sing ] ( http://www.bbc.com/russian/rolling_news/2015/09/150903_rn_parnas_magadan_appeal ) , for falsifying signatures of course , [ or they discard the signs just because ] ( http://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/1695442.html ) . 
  none of parties allowed to duma are opposition , they routinely support whatever bullshit putin comes up with , giving almost 100 % votes for the most controversial laws . 
   it costs you nothing this single act of destruction costed about [ 30 billion rubles ] ( http://www.vedomosti.ru/newsline/top/realty/news/2016/02/04/626826-snos-samostroev-oboitis-byudzhetu-30-mlrd-rublei ) of budget money plus 22 billion in anticipated court settlements . 
  it would surprise me a lot if contractors are not affiliated with officials as usual . 
  also a lot of new good looking objects were destroyed as well . 
  probably the beneficiary of the demolishing assaulted the organizer and probably it 's not the city but some business that wants this plot of land , but huge bribes were likely involved and police will do nothing . 
  when some small businesses are hurt protests are extremely rare . 
  protests happen when some new plot of land that is important for the neighborhood ( like a park or a public road ) is allocated for construction for bribes , or their personal property gets destroyed . 
  couple examples from last week headlines . 
  there is an apartment complex in moscow that is going to be built on an illegally inflated plot of land that will block a public road and reduce public square territory , there was a protest last friday , and all participants were put in jail for terms from a week to two weeks because the rally was not allowed by officials . 
  there was also a rally against illegal demolishing of private garages , and the organizer was just beaten in front of their home before he could come to the allowed rally . 
  most if not all of these shops were located in front of metro entries , the most expensive and lucrative parts of the city . 
  nobody asked the public , not many people knew this is going to happen . 
  probably something similar will be constructed in the same place after some bribes . 
  corruption probably . 
  in my home city each new mayor starting their term used to demolish significant number of small shops and markets on grounds of their permits given illegally in protected location , then sold permits for new shops in the same locations . 
  in this case the city claims that these shops were in illegal location without permit , even though some of them did have permit . 
  nothing out of usual for russia actually , for example putin 's press secretary said that omoh should `` smudge protesters ' liver on the asphalt '' when people rallied against the rigged elections in 2011 , 2012 . 
  kadyrov does n't exactly has a popular public support , he rather has putin 's support that let him to maintain the personal army to rob and [ control chechnya by fear ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krxltnnenzs ) . 
  but true , at this point appointing anyone else would definitely cause massive instability because his clan displaced all the proper institutions in the region . 
  kadyrov puts more effort lately to be in center of attention not because he 's growing more powerful but because his term will end this year and putin will decide whom to appoint next ( he can appoint the same person ) . 
  i do n't see any people irl who love putin . 
  there are quite some nationalists who 're cheering ` returning ' of crimea or confrontation with the west , but even they call putin and the government thieves , yet somehow some of them are shure it 's not much better elsewhere and it will get worse if someone else gets elected in russia . 
  it seems the large majority is apolitical and does n't care about anything but their private things , and propaganda targets them primarily as they would n't care to fact check whatever information that is most accessible . 
  even [ russian pollsters admit ] ( http://www.svoboda.org/content/article/24979269.html ) that it 's propaganda that influence the results the most and that it does n't make any sense to compare political poll results from russia or other autocratic countries with results from open societies where major media are open to criticism of the state . 
  westerners who believe that russians love putin are just as gullible as russians supporting him , or rather we all are humans and often fail to critically perceive prevalent information here and there . 
  my home city samara has three great and a few good big universities that teach computer science software and it professionals among others . 
  it practically has a massive overproduction of highly qualified engineers , and they get offered 300eur ( at current rate ) at best after graduation which is good money for locals . 
  a lot of outsorce and offshore companies are based there but most of them pay in rubles and amounts that are only good for locals ( there are a few exceptions , local outsourcers that pay wages more typical for moscow but they only hire best of the best obviously , like world programming contest finalists ) . 
  it happens just because for most people it takes quite some time to save up for comfortable relocation to moscow ( took me 2 years and only after that i figured how easy it actually is and that i should 've done that right away ) let alone abroad , and enough people are bound to home city for whatever reason . 
  i do that occasionally , my primary technology stack ( . net , winforms , oracle or mssql ) is not really popular on freelance so i 'm also learning python and web frontend . 
  anyway i 'm much more productive in a traditional office for some reason . 
  i know i have a good chance of getting a visa as i 'm fairly good at job interviews , but i 'm also not really good at actual work and i 'm afraid of losing a visa . 
  so i 'm saving so that i could afford that risk and also trying to improve my professional skills of course and preparing for ielts . 
  i considered baltics and poland ( to my huge surprise poland has eased immigration rules for russian citizens ) but actually one of my goals is to get into english speaking environment , at least at work . 
  not the same user but anyway , this morning i was happy as i got a nice bonus , then i looked at the exchange rate and i 'm not happy anymore . 
  actually i decided to move somewhere safer and closer to my political views around 2008 but was never good or brave enough to enroll in foreign university or apply for work in foreign countries . 
  i still think i would leave the moment i 'm confident in my professional skills enough not to perceive the risk of losing professional visa as something significant . 
  i also asked 5 people in my office room , 2 other programmers criticize russian policies but are in general ok , both consider moving in any developed english speaking place for more money but they do n't look actively for such opportunity , my boss is happy enough and skeptical of other places as is our sqa guy and they both also have families and mortgages so that must influence them somehow , and our db guy says it 's scary over here but he was abroad twice and did n't like it ( paris and turkey ) . 
  we are in moscow but none of us is originally from moscow . 
  ok , you have internet access , time to waste and some minimal command of english . 
  so you could get some ideas at / r/beermoney ( i did that shit for a few days out of boredom and it works ) and make a few times more than you do now . 
  but seriously better teach yourself software testing as i wrote to you under previous post and relocate to any place with decent software companies . 
  not even necessary moscow - spb , novosibirsk , kazan , nn , samara , rostov , saratov and many other will be ok . 
  anyway stop whining and pull yourself together , now you 're only harming yourself . 
  not to say i 'm fond of russia but you definitely can do better even in current situation . 
  the state considers it successfull and prolonged this temporary program from original 2013 to 2018 . 
  in polls about 6 % admitted this was a significant point in decision to have a second ( or subsequent ) child . 
  in 2007 , the first year of the program most of this support naturally was distributed in regions with traditionally high birth rate ( mostly muslim regions ) , but no longer because each family can claim this support only once , also some regions implemented similar programs to provide this support the second time for subsequent child . 
  i did n't find actual detailed data , just [ some article ] ( http://www.rg.ru/2014/10/15/reg-cfo/timakov.html ) . 
  $ 6700 already with this exchange rate . 
  there is example in front of my eyes of relatively small industry-automation business being slowly taken over by officials piece by piece , business of people who never lived a lavish lifestyle even by local standards . 
  the only reason for this is that most of treir clients are state owned industrial objects in a field that is pretty much under the state monopoly , someone has to service them anyway . 
  but it was a huge mistake making business with the state so i advise anyone not to . 
  they pretty much had to give up control of a subsidiary to some company affiliated with officials under a very real threat of bankrupcy by a bunch of state companies and private companies dependent on the state ( and probablly threatened as well ) sabotaging their contracts all at once ( which actually happened until they were satisfied ) plus informal threat of being punished otherwise . 
  of course if you count all enterpreneurs or investors and all companies intentionally fucked over by the state , it would probably look like you have a decent chance to succeed . 
  but still you have to be lucky and willing to take risk . 
  the original topic is privatisation of state companies , with controlling stake remaining state owned . 
  participating in this sort of deal in russia only can attract loyal olygarchs , naive and crazy . 
  look into brauder/magnitsky 's story or navalny 's criminal prosecusion and it 's clear that anyone can be made a white collar criminal in russia if the state wants so . 
  population density is not a problem by itself in the permafrost regions , for example take canada 's territories withing the same latitude and the population density is less there : 0.07 in yukon or 0.04 in northwest against 0.3 in sakha , even though there is more permafrost in sakha . 
  you ca n't compare russian far east even with finland because [ it 's much colder ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xe9vrj3.jpg ) , so comparing it with india is pure nonsense . 
  the actual problem is weak local governance and funding being in total control of moscow . 
  quite a few , [ in european ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_separatist_movements_in_europe#russian_federation ) and [ asian part . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_separatist_movements_in_asia#russian_federation ) , none of those are actually strong so far .
