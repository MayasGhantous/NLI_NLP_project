  also traktor.dirty.ru and specifically for it or software professionals google site : geektimes.ru \u044d\u043c\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f or \u0438\u043c\u043c\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f, 
  current exchange rate of course , otherwise would not be worth relocating to moscow . 
  11-12 semester remote university programms are common in russia , they award a specialist degree that is considered less than masters , but there are shorter programs and there are no good reasons for op not to chose them . 
  if you earn 140usd a month that 's probably the problem you should fix first . 
  it 's not a problem right now in russia to find a somewhat good paying job in it and software fields even with minimal skills because a lot of professionals not bound by mortgage or family problems emigrated in the last couple years . 
  your best bet is to teach yourself software testing , you can totally do that in a few months instead of wasting your time on reddit , i recommended this to another person and now half a year later he works in sqa for about 1000usd in moscow without higher education or prior relevant job experience . 
  also sqa is in demand in other countries so this career move will tremendously help you with emigration . 
  you can start from completing one or a few free video courses ( maybe it 's not the best but the easiest way to discover basics of sqa ) like these http://universarium.org/course/445 , http://www.luxoft-training.ru/personal_test/learning/course/?course_id=15 google everything you did n't completely understand . 
  getting some experience at utest.com will help a lot to get a full time job . 
  to maximise your chances to get hired fast also learn sql ( i recommend sql-tutorial . ru and sql-ex . ru ) . 
  google interview questions and once you feel comfortable with those , prepare a resume and send it to every single software company in prefered location , no matter if they advertise sqa positions or not , ask for a skype interview if you do n't have local software scene and have a good luck . 
  then getting a degree is optional but highly recommended and will open for you a door of professional emigration , but better get a decent job first anyway . 
  you can also complete a 4 year evening program working the same time and not 6 years remote one . 
  the state generally disapproves levada for being independent ( state media criticize it when it shows putin 's ratings go down ) , and [ treats it as a ` foreign agent ' ] ( http://www.novayagazeta.ru/politics/58217.html ) for polling on political topics and having having won some foreign grants to continue their regular polls and not go bankrupt during crisis . 
  state controlled media cites it often because they can omit the inconvenient results and twist the interpretation anyway , as polls shows what people answer and not why they do . 
  opposition also often criticize levada , for example for almost as hard failure as for state pollsters to predict impressive results of navalny 's mayoral election campaign , but otherwise mostly for no reason but frustration with popular opinions as levada results are very close to state pollsters . 
  levada analysts in multiple interviews expressed that [ russia is an authoritarian state and that poll results are heavily influenced by state propaganda ] ( http://www.svoboda.org/content/article/24979269.html ) which effectively determines opinion of otherwise apolitical majority , and that blindly comparing for example approval ratings in russia with ratings in democratic societies makes no sense . 
  but there are no evidence suggesting that these views interfere with results of their polls , again its results do n't even differ that much from the state pollsters . 
  i was told by several university teachers , all 60 and older and very fit , that the best decision in their life was some variation of running half naked and swimming in the river year round ( it 's over -40 sometimes in the winter here , sometimes over +40 in summer ) . 
  they were also from different universities so i guess they are not from the same club or something , it apparently was quite popular among soviet academics . 
  documents of original investigation are supposed to be in president administration archive that evaded official requests by media for years before responding that the documents were [ lost or disposed of without stating the reason ] ( http://www.svoboda.org/content/article/24552575.html ) . 
  seems fair . 
  now that i think of it there were also a lot of similar land distributed among workers , but with no permit to build a summer house so technically not a dacha . 
  originally in russian empire dacha was just a plot of land given to someone by emperor ( word dacha derives from ` given ' ) . 
  most of dachas though were given by ussr , first mostly to higher party members , and since 50s also to state enterprises and worker unions . 
  most dachas were by legislation limited in size as 400 to 600sqm plot of land with a permit to build a small summer house with 12 to 25sqm living space . 
  you could n't live at dacha officially but needed an official place of living ( otherwise was a criminal offense ) and your apartment could be taken if you do n't use it , so almost no one lived on dachas in winter . 
  also most dachas are somewhat out of cities and as most people did n't have cars it was complicated to visit your dacha in winter even if somewhat close to train stations . 
  also for most people in ussr dacha was more of a garden that provided significant amount of food , and it seems in late 80 's -- early 90 's most of our food was potatoes grown on our dacha + unclaimed land around it . 
  [ about 6,6 mn households of 20mn people ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9f%d0%be%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b1%d0%b8%d1%82%d0%b5%d0%bb%d1%8c%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%b9_%d0%b8%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%b0%d0%bb_%d0%b2_%d0%a1%d0%a1%d0%a1%d0%a0#cite_note-32 ) out of 280mn people in ussr overall in 1986 . 
  because it was not any decent road even by russian standards . 
  [ quick googling ] ( http://style.rbc.ru/news/luxury/2014/08/10/19049/ ) suggests that average price of 1km of road in russia was about 17.6 mn usd in 2014 , about 51.7 mn usd in moscow . 
  some solzhenitsyn 's and shalamov 's works were on mandatory reading list , others were recommended . 
  wrong picture , [ they meant this yacht ] ( http://www.compromat.ru/page_30930.htm ) . 
  also iirc the new years did n't prevent the same city administration to move a much bigger rally planned on middle of december of previous year to the 31st of december to make it harder to attend and to claim it 's just people celebrating / shame them for disturbing the holiday !, 
  you do n't have to get permission to hold a sign 50 meters from another guy with a sign , police does n't care though . 
  and then there are governors like merkushkin whose numerous relatives are all in big business and hugely profit from dubious regional state contracts , but instead of jail time merkushkin got appointed by putin to another richer samara region ( after serving 17 years as a governor of mordovia already ) for rigging the elections giving almost ( [ and in some districts over ] ( http://www.newsru.com/russia/05dec2007/maxinatiry.html ) ) 100 % votes for putin/united russia with completely unrealistic turnout . 
  it 's just governor of my region , other putin 's favorites are not any better . 
  it 's true as much as the soviet union failed due to dependence on oil exports when price dropped . 
  for some recent years we had budget so unrealistic it was prepared with expectations of increase in oil price , so obviously oil price triggered the economic failure but it was not the primary reason . 
  back in 2011 russian finance minister resigned exactly because the federal budget was prepared with unreasonable risks coming from putin 's populism in social spending , growing military spending , ever increasing dependence on oil and was to inevitably drive russia into economic crisis . 
  according to him he had no authority to change the budget and publicly criticized its project long before and apparently it was not the first budget prepared in conflict with his opinion especially remembering he was in the best traditions of russian politics called both unpatriotic and fascist by mainstream politicians for trying to resist the party policy . 
  i do n't know if he had enough influence to make major changes in russian economy at any time of his career but i 'm skeptical about it knowing about total submission of other state institutions here to the single person . 
  ^ * sorry ^ for ^ copypasting ^ my ^ old ^ comment, 
  also that current truck drivers protest as well as recent medical workers , teachers are seemingly as zombified by tv as it can get . 
  putin tanked economy by his recent foreign policy and previous irresponsible actions , and now all state sectors compensate by reducing costs and increasing fees . 
  yet teachers and medics are begging him for help like he 's not the reason of their budget cuts , and truck drivers are angry at putin 's childhood friend who happened to be beneficiary of this company which truck drivers are forced to pay to , ignoring the reason why rotenberg receives insane amount of huge state contracts of all sorts since 2001 . 
  head of truck driver 's union [ said ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/politics/19/11/2015/564dd7a09a79471bb0b58dcd ) regarding all this : `` we are not the fifth column . 
  i love my country and hate the us . 
  many of us participated in anti-maidan , but now we fight for our and all russians ' rights - trucking fees will hit each consumer '' so he does n't want to pay and that 's it , no politics . 
  i did n't follow this closely , but did any of their leaders question state policies boyound primitive approach like `` i want crimea but let some one else pay for that '' ? 
  if putin manage to find someone else to rob this time instead of truckers , they will be satisfied . 
  yeah , their criteria are strange but [ this graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zkevles.png ) from the [ original report ] ( http://globesearch.dk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/global-workforce-happiness-index-2015.pdf ) is much more illustrative and puts everything in its place . 
  there is a huge portion of russian workers who are not that much satisfied with their job but wo n't consider changing it . 
  those are state workers , their pay is on average 30 % higher so changing jobs will likely reduce it , also they have special benefits some of which are only enabled if they stay on their state job until retirement . 
  but they are not really satisfied because management sucks and work is often senseless . 
  they also have a huge impact as they make about a third of all russian workers . 
  it did n't matter how pro-soviet or not those people were . 
  local authorities were given orders and quite arbitrary quotas to identify kulaks and they did even when there were none or they were loyal . 
  in my grandmother 's village every man with a big house or more than one cow was branded kulak , even in families with many children ( and having 5-7 children was common ) where that was absolute necessety . 
  that was not about rationality and logic , it was dictatorship with every bureaucrat and executor ready to implement senseless orders rather then question them and risk to be shot by others who did n't . 
  yeah , those having a doubt whether it 's sarcasm or craziness can read his actual opinion expressed in more than 140 letters and linked on the same twitter ( [ 1 ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fnavalny.com%2fp%2f4560%2f&amp;edit-text= ) , [ 2 ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fnavalny.com%2fp%2f4561%2f&amp;edit-text= ) ) . 
  if you like arguing tactics that much you could stop abusing reduction to absurdity all over this thread , or at least apply it to my arguments and not something you probably saw other russians wrote before . 
  i was just pointing out that things are much more complicated than you portray it . 
  because `` russia was taken over by russians '' makes as little sense as `` eu citizens murdered over hundred people in paris '' if you refuse to acknowledge other details . 
  both statements are technically true but both groups were obviously guided by their radical ideology and not their citizenship . 
  i used to think there is something more important in people than their national identity . 
  those people were clearly more defined by their radical ideology than anything else , by no means they represented any significant number of people before liberal provisional government quite mindlesly allowed all kinds of political activists including lenin to enter russia , let other activists from prison . 
  it does n't make them more russian that they had massive foreign funding from states russia was at war with as addition to their usual funding by robberies . 
  they still did n't represent a majority of russians before well into six years long civil war even though lenin and others were master propagandists . 
  nothing makes somebody to represent a nation better than striking at a time of weakness and killing any dissent , right ? 
  they killed even most of each other at the top of new ` elite ' , it 's not like they cared for russia or russians or even common ideology after a while , it was just a tool to gain and hold on power . 
  you could the same way argue that russia was taken over by bolsheviks in november 1917 because the country was weakened by ongoing war , recent revolution in february of the same year , and too liberal policies of new government that rushed to build democracy before other problems were fixed . 
  i 've read some blog post written by russian doctor explaining why some of his colleagues prescribe homeopathy or other drugs not proved to be effective . 
  he wrote they often do so for patients that do n't need any medication at all , just because some of them heavily demand any prescription believing they really need it , so some medics prescribe placebo to satisfy an average patient . 
  there are some known harmless/useless drugs that can be given to a patient in hospital as a placebo ( some vitamin or micro element preparations ) , but patients also know those are not drugs specifically designed against their condition and reasonably do n't believe it would help and are not satisfied with such prescription . 
  so medic wants to prescribe something harmless and legit looking . 
  but there is also no interest for drug producers to make a variety of placebo marketed for different conditions and sell it for cheap , they market it as a homeopathy or not , spend a ton of money to promote their placebo over some other producer 's placebo for specific condition and and sell it for high prices just because enough people are willing to pay for whatever is recommended by their doctor and it 's easy enough to motivate underpaid russian doctors to recommend some specific brand of placebo . 
  i guess it would still work in a similar way with well paid doctors . 
  i 've read somewhere about some study that found expensive placebo to be more effective than the same thing for cheap . 
  that ending means belonging to something or to someone so cape flissingsky means cape of flissingen , or anything in moscow or named after it is moskovsky . 
  [ you just do this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htg21ekaqqm ), 
  there are a few buses and trolley buses in the picture , with orange running lines . 
  [ allegedly ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fstarshinazapasa.livejournal.com%2f881063.html&amp;edit-text= ) this director was appointed a few years ago specifically to `` clean up the library of ukrainian nationalism '' and is extremely loyal to putin . 
  so probably it 's a result of some internal intrigues or kremlin is so desperate for a good propaganda story it 's ready to kick its friends already . 
  edit : also interesting that the author of those banned books [ used to give lectures ] ( http://korrespondent.net/world/worldabus/148416-gazeta-ru-korchinskij-boevik-tesno-svyazannyj-s-kremlem ) at pro-putin youth summer camp seliger . 
  it 's just an undergraduate thesis in vehicle exterior design , i 'd be proud of this project . 
  there is nothing wrong with the concept itself , only with rt 's propaganda and bad journalist at your link . 
  i hope it 's not relevant to sevastyanov but seriously , it 's not a secret that there are a lot of corruption in russian education , including bought degrees and plagiarized dissertations . 
  some examples are [ putin ] ( https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/bill-bowring/putins-dissertation-and-revenge-of-runet ) , a [ bunch of ministers ] ( http://www.dissernet.org/expertise/tag/minister/ivanovvp2006.htm ) and lots of other officials . 
  to shift agenda in social media to safe topics that does n't involve for example new military budget that was increased once again or that gazprom buried another project funded by taxpayers . 
  good work , you accused me of lying even though i shared only widely known information . 
  do you think dependent people can risk being known as traitors as easily as free people ? 
  or that there are less people dependent on the state ? 
  anyway here are only a few of latest examples where recently passed `` anti-extremism '' law was used : * man got 2 years of probation for reposting a pro-maidan message http://grani.ru/people/2310/ * student jailed for reposting info about a rally http://www.fontanka.ru/2015/01/31/113/ . 
  * right now a woman is criminally prosecuted for up to 4 years in prison for liking and reposting pro-ukrainian posts http://www.fontanka.ru/2015/01/31/113/ . 
  if you saw any russian news shows since 2010 and did n't notice hate you probably tried very hard not to . 
  it 's a strange question , what is the nature of the approval , when he was first elected via bought media and first he did as a president is taking media under control . 
  most probably you wo n't go to prison for that , even though there were people who did - for liking a wrong picture on facebook for example .
