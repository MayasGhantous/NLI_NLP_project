legatum prosperity index is basically a ranking of what makes white sjws happy . 
  by that metric russia will indeed be pretty low . 
  because it does n't participate in pisa . 
  it does however participate in [ timss ] ( https://nces.ed.gov/timss/table11_3.asp ) . 
  clearing up lies/misconceptions = supporting someone = must be downvoted . 
  svidomite fanaticism on display as always . 
  meanwhile , [ 47 % of crimes in moscow are committed by immigrants ] ( http://www.gazeta.ru/social/news/2013/05/20/n_2921709.shtml ) . 
  but hey , ethnic russians are the only population that it is politically correct to hate in the west , so let 's all focus on those `` 177 acts of violence against blacks '' in the past four years . 
  it 's now probably on the maidan . 
  1 ) apologize and pay reparations for defeating hitler . 
  2 ) independence to the caucasus emirate . 
  3 ) have putin lead a gay pride parade in moscow , before sodomizing him to death by an enraged mob . 
  4 ) hand over russia 's oil and mineral resources to their rightful owners - exxon , bp , total , halliburton , soros . 
  5 ) compensate khodorkovsky $ 100 billion in damages . 
  only then would i deem russia sufficiently progressive to be allowed into the european family of nations .

  he did n't . 
  it was done by an independent artist from her own imagination , and yanukovych himself had nothing to do with it . 
  [ well actually ... ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/gay-activists-in-germany-silent-on-alliance-with-pedophiles-in-1980s-a-919119.html ), 
  ( 1 ) muslims are concentrated in urban areas , where people - pedestrians , and in crowds - tend to be more visible . 
  ( 2 ) they are on average younger , and as such probably go out more . 
  ( 3 ) they stand out more , especially the women in niqabs . 
  ( 4 ) this is hard to prove and must remain speculative , but it 's quite possible that official statistical agencies underestimate immigration , including muslim immigration . 
  death by fire is the purest death . 
  how dare you occupy the rightful territory of the mammoths . 
  vacate `` ukraine '' immediately , svidomite . 
  eurofags and svidomites - you 're late to the party , [ your wahhabi friends have been writing about putin 's cancer since 2012 ] ( http://www.kavkazcenter.com/eng/content/2012/11/23/17016.shtml ) :  - today i learned from a source in the presidential administration , that our alpha dog is not simply sick but he is sick with spine sarcoma ( spinal cancer , ) and 3 months are left for the life of this guy . 
  the cancer can not be treated , and there is already a struggle inside the kgb for powerful positions . 
   a probable successor will actually be the shaman shoigu ( russia 's new defense minister ) , and soon there will be a lot of interesting events , in particular , before the next special operation to transfer the throne from one thief to another ; half of the of weapons are planned to be confiscated from the population . 
  so , in 2013 there will be fun . 
  we must prevent a new thief from the putin 's gang to move to the kremlin . 
  too bad putin does n't give a fuck about your wetdreams . 
  i had fun winding you up , but you really are quite stupid , and it 's getting rather boring . 
  have a great day . 
  i am happy for you that you like [ muscular russian far-right tattooed dudes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju_66nbpbkk&amp; ) pumping iron more than a cute-looking young chick in a thong .

  oh but wait , kiev does n't allow gay parades either .

  [ 81 million ukrainians in 1931 ] ( https://twitter.com/sotnik_ua/status/485142948750061568 ) . 
  more than there were russians !, 
  that 's the product of the past 20 years of ukrainian textbooks for you : ancient mammoth riding proto-ukrainians , the mongoloid golden horde as founder of the russian empire while ukraine is the direct successor of kievan rus , 80 million ukrainians ( not only in ukraine but throughout southern russia and siberia ) before the holodomor , etc. 
  you 'd be surprised , but no , not really . 
  it 's the nuclear command and control system that is expensive . 
  but even it pales in comparison to the costs of a well-oiled conventional military force . 
  okay , thanks for the explanation . 
  this has puzzlied me for some time . 
  why do the irish , in general , dislike england more than scotland ? 
  were n't most of the settlers in northern ireland - protestant scots ? 
  or is it some kind of celtic solidarity thing ? 
  something like this : http://imgur.com/9zujlf7 try as i might , i ca n't really think of any country that i hate or , for that matter , is worth hating . 
  by calling our president khuilo , i believe that svidomites ( ukie nazis ) are merely acknowledging putin 's obvious vigor , vivacity , virility . 
  as a corollary , it is also a cry of frustration over their own country 's flaccid impotence . 
  compliment is accepted , but i advise counseling be sought regardless . 
  nicholas ii if purely in terms of being a bad politician as a politician - no real competition there , i think . 
  tie between lenin and yeltsin in terms of who did the most damage to russia . 
  the informed consensus in mid-1941 * was * that the ussr would fold pretty quickly . 
  hindsight is 20/20 , and in the context of what he knew at the time he was not acting particularly `` irrationally . '', 
  if anything , invading poland , annexing the sudetenland , or even remilitarizing the rhineland were all viewed as being riskier at the time they happened , but these actions are not regarded as mistakes because they were successful . 
   outside of a few biggest cities , people in russia live even worse than in africa . 
  you forgot about bears , vodka , and gulag . 
  back to your political science class !, 
  bulgaria knows all there is to know about vassalage - to the germans in both world wars , and to nato today . 
  anyway , is n't it an economic basketcase anyway ? 
  american military toys are n't cheap for anyone who is n't israel . 
  as such , he 'll either destroy his air force , or his economy - either way , win-win for russia . 
  around 1,000 regime troops have been killed . 
  due to underestimates , this may be as high as 2,000 , but surely no more . 
  numbers are approximately similar for the novorossiya resistance . 
  so , either the novorossiya resistance is made up more or less entirely of russian troops - specifically troops , not volunteers - or the estimate/news source is complete bs . 
  in reality , we know even from pro-regime media sources like the nyt that the resistance was mostly composed of donbass natives , and that the russians amongst them were veterans and volunteers . 
  the only time at which the russian army appears to have gotten * directly * involved saw massive regime setbacks and poroshenko agreeing to the ceasefire . 
  as such , it would be surprising if russian military dead in ukraine was to be over 100 , and impossible for the figure to even approach 500 . 
  it crushes diverse nations and cultures under the same bland , neoliberal , and anomic anglo-oligarchy that dominates most of the rest of the world . 
  as a committed multiculturalist ( tm ) , i am against that . 
  i am russian , have n't watched tv in years , and despise the eu .

  not that it 's a problem , though . 
  it 's good for russians to be reminded of europe 's real face every now and again . 
  i believe russia should retaliate by banning the baltic flags - the flags of fascism . 
  freedom of speech is a two-way street . 
  i would like to extend my apologies to the long-suffering folk of donbass and novorossiya for the #traitorsmarch that befouled the streets of moscow today .

  even if you think the crimean referendum was rigged , the vast majority of crimeans disagree , [ with 88 % of the opinion that ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/08/despite-concerns-about-governance-ukrainians-want-to-remain-one-country/ ) kiev should recognize the results . 
  this indicator is statistically indistinguishable from the 89 % sentiment in russia .
