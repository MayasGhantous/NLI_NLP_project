  [ so basically russia was right ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/30/russia-boycott-eurovision-gay-parade ) . 
  eurovision really is a europe-wide gay parade . 
  portugal was one of the countries that blocked morales plane . 
  better to be a bully than a whore . 
  you do realize that this is a sure way to make rogozin 's joke into reality , or are you one of those westerners so convinced of your own own impunity and omnipotence that you believe there will be no more consequences for this than for bombing brown people from drones ? 
  of course , right sector masquerading as an army shoots up unarmed civilians , putin is responsible . 
  how logical . 
  when did you say you 're emigrating again ? 
  ca n't wait for you to change your flair . 
  and you callously equivalize the ussr with nazi germany , a state that planned to extermine 3/4 of european slavs and enslave the rest . 
  if you ( plural ) insist on denigrating russia with mocking and trivializing comments , do n't act all smug and affronted when russians respond in kind . 
  on the positive side , you 'd have gotten to experience the joys of eurointegration . 
  he 's not . 
  even if you hate russia and wish to see it fall apart and retreat back into its muscovite nucleus , it 's the wrong way to go about things . 
  what good , exactly , is loudly supporting japan on the kurils when over close to 100 % of russians support russia keeping them ( according to opinion polls ) ? 
  referring to chechnya and dagestan as `` disputed '' - disputed between whom , exactly ? 
  turkey ? 
  was erdogan consulted about this ? 
  objectively , the best way to break apart russia would be to economically isolate it , isolate it really hardcore ( i.e. 
  entirely cut off trade ) . 
  then - and this is critical - bring the brics ( well , china ) on board . 
  i 'm not sure how that can be accomplished even theoretically - acquiescing to chinese expansion into the south china seat , though , instead of `` pivoting '' to east asia , would be a good start . 
  if the west and japan let 's china build its east asian emporium in peace , without resistance , then china will not have any great need for a strategically secure north , as it does now . 
  blocked off on all sides and from the three major global economic centers ( europe , north america , and east asia ) , the russian economy will collapse and , i suppose , separatism will become a real issue again ( assuming russia does n't emulate north korea and totally clamp down ) . 
  anything much less than the above , and they will just be empty but insulting gestures . 
  at best russia will ignore them . 
  realistically , it would start to undermine western countries more . 
  loud individuals . 
  look , there was some separatism in the 1990s , when pretty much the entire system of inter-regional budgetary transfers broke down and some republics and even oblasts hoarded the taxes they collected , but even then it did not translate into serious movements towards full sovereignty outside chechnya . 
  not even in ingushetia , which is a region closely related to chechnya . 
  for obvious reasons , the situation today is cardinally different . 
  ( 1 ) a majority of russians would be just fine with chechnya and ingushetia leaving . 
  ( 2 ) no other minority wishes to ( actually i 'm far from sure even most chechens let alone ingushetians do , but let 's assume otherwise for now ) . 
  dagestan certainly does n't ( i 'm one quarter dagestani myself ) , and for that matter , many of them dislike chechens ( recall that ~ ~ terrorist ~ ~ pro-democratic freedom fighter basayev invaded dagestan , which is what triggered the second war ) . 
  though i suppose as far as the author is concerned , all muslims in russia are the same . 
  as for tatar separatism , it is nothing but a neocon/islamist wet dream . 
  so sorry for wishing to keep the new german-soviet border as far back as possible . 
  what a terrible idea it was in retrospect . 
  oh , and it 's not as if poland was n't [ an opportunistic carnivore ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93czechoslovak_border_conflicts#annexations_by_poland_in_1938 ) when the occassion presented itself either . 
  next time we 'll be more considerate and let the first totalitarian dictatorship kill three quarters of you and enslave the rest . 
  you mean like the ukraine made crimea prosper , turning it from the premier sand and sun tourism spot of the ussr into a dilapidated wasteland with a fourth of the gdp per capita and half the wages of neighboring krasnodar , frequented by country bumpkins from galicia who bring their own salo and vodka because they are too cheap to pay the local cafes and restaurants ? 
  i sure hope not . 
  even abkhazia would be preferable to that . 
  in particular , i would draw attention to what crimeans themselves say about their referendum : http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/08/despite-concerns-about-governance-ukrainians-want-to-remain-one-country/pg-2014-05-08-ukraine-russia-0-05/ makes all these claims bandied about that only 50 % wanted to join russia rather ridiculous , no ? 
  from 1992 to around 1999-2003 , before putin finally either converted all the compradors , or kicked them out of power . 
  so you 're saying it 's alright for pro-western politicians who do n't call themselves communists to steal , while condemning pro-russian politicians who do call themselves communists for the same thing ? 
  thanks for clearing that up . 
  yes , very good . 
  now look up [ tymoshenko 's ] ( http://02varvara.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/00-ukrainian-junta-mansions-03-02-03-14.jpg ) and [ poroshenko 's ] ( http://02varvara.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/00-ukrainian-junta-mansions-08-02-03-14.jpg ) mansions . 
  i 'm a human rights activist who hates putin and wants russia to go back under the west 's thumb . 
  let me call up some of my closest buddies to query them on whether or not their support crimea joining russia . 
  the results will be entirely accurate and representative of popular opinion , just like a serious opinion poll . 
  like ordinary russians ( i.e. 
  not you ) care about the possibly hurt feelings of some eurofags . 
  because their poor performance was entirely down to the rooskies , and had nothing whatsoever to do with central planning/suppression of free markets . 
  i know its / r/europe and one ca n't expect too much , but how about trying to read the question before downvoting ? 
   how did quality of life in countries of eastern europe compare to countries in western europe in the decades ** before world war 2 ** ? 
  they were substantially poorer than north/western europe , and broadly equivalent to southern europe . 
  this difference sprouted up during the 19th century industrial revolution , which came late to the east and south . 
  but the antecedents of that lie even further back , namely , the much earlier development of mass literacy in western europe - which in turn has its roots in protestantism - as well as ( probably ) considerably more favorable climatic and geographical conditions . 
  * oh , not to mention the russian imperial jackboot keeping ~ ~ eastern ~ ~ central europeans down . 
  * - obligatory / r/europe addition . 
  what force ? 
  the ukrainian army is [ soliciting donations ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/ukraine-short-on-military-budget-starts-fundraising-drive/2014/04/19/0eba04d0-c7f6-11e3-8b9a-8e0977a24aeb_story.html ) by sms messages . 
  i understand the attempt to avoid running afoul of [ rule 2 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) by using a non-english term of abuse , but what i 'm really curious about is why you capitalized it . 
  and ? 
  what relevance does this have ? 
  ukraine is n't exactly liked in europe either , although it 's not liked in a much hazier ( because most europeans could n't find it on a map ) way . 
  rather telling that the most accurate answer to this question is also the second most downvoted one . 
  honestly , i do wonder if / r/europe members actually , like , talk to people ( europeans ) in real life , as opposed to just circlejerking about it on reddit . 
  / r/europe \u2260 average europeans, 
  is it somewhere in russia ? 
  it 's a very liberal ( ideologically , not in the sense of tolerating other viewpoints ) , culturally marxist , pro-eu , anti-national , anti-traditional values , pro-islamist , russophobic community . 
  the abode of a certain class of 20-something , relatively well educated rootless cosmopolitans based in urban europe who believe their vision is the one and true historical process , and this overweening sense of their own righteous virture leads them to label all those who challenge it as either deluded or intentionally malevolent heretics . 
  in this sense , they strongly resemble the old marxists , their descendents the neocons , and radical islamists . 
  this does n't mean that comprehensive and well-sourced comments that go against the ideology described above are always downvoted , but why bother overmuch when some snarky one-liner that hews to the above ideological preferences will inevitably get far more upvotes . 
  i read it . 
  it 's the retarded ramblings of a liberal that descends into incessant scatalogy towards the end . 
  though liberals like that kind of thing if pussy riot are anything to go by so i can see why some might enjoy it . 
  you really signed up to reddit just to leave this one comment ? 
  [ that flyer about jews needing to ` register ' in ukraine is fake ] ( http://www.dailydot.com/politics/ukraine-jewish-registry-fake/ ) as would have been obvious to anyone but a clinical imbecile or pathological russophobe . 
  which [ i pointed out yesterday ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/23972a/separatists_in_donetsk_are_ordering_jews_to/cguqwg3 ) , linking to an explanation , yesterday . 
  only to be voted down into oblivion , which i fully expect this will be as well . 
  / r/europe does n't care about facts that undermine the crusade against russia . 
  accusing people of being anti-semitic is the new blood libel , indeed i was compared compared to hitler by one of this subreddit 's most respected posters . 
  so it 's not inaccurate to say that russians are the jews of the 21st century , so far as european fascists/supremacists are concerned . 
  thank god we have nukes and putin !, 
  russia should have no business with those flea-infested western rats . 
  dear rebellious boa , i see i 've stumbled on a reliable prospect . 
  you see , i 'm a russian oligarch who 's on a sanctions list , and i need help moving out us9 .5 million from an american bank . 
  send me your bank details and you can have 10 % of the total . 
  yes , they were . 
  since the 1780 's . 
  with a brief interruption in 1942-44 , thanks to our european friends . 
   separatists in donetsk are ordering jews to register ... after which they throw some maidan activists into a bear pit while tucking into a delicious dinner of ukrainian babies . 
  / r/europe is such a fucking cesspool . 
  one could explain at length why this is [ an obvious scam ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/23773u/donetsk_prorussians_order_jews_to_register_or_be/cgugs1b ) , but what 's the point of throwing pearls before swine . 
  abortion rights came to the eastern bloc in the 1950s , before the pill , whereas for western europe and the us the pill ( 1960s ) came before widespread abortion rights ( 1970s-80s ) . 
  this cultural/historical legacy leads to the clear east/west divide on this map , which is however rapidly narrowing . 
  why is it so shocking and surprising that abortion rates would be higher in a more urbanized and less religious society ?
