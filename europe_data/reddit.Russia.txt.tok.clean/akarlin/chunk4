  abortion rights came to the eastern bloc in the 1950s , before the pill , whereas for western europe and the us the pill ( 1960s ) came before widespread abortion rights ( 1970s-80s ) . 
  this cultural/historical legacy leads to the clear east/west divide on this map , which is however rapidly narrowing . 
  it does n't since 2008 , also births outnumber deaths since 2013 , and abortion rates continue to plummet . 
  glory to putin !, 
  the security agreement that ensures nagorno-karabakh is n't reincorporated within its legal bounders by the azeris and ethnically cleansed ? 
  if your types were the majority in armenia , i 'm sure russians would have no problems in letting that happen . 
  i certainly would n't . 
  fortunately , ordinary armenians are somewhat more intelligent than you . 
  revolutions is the only thing a failed non-state like ukraine can do . 
  all countries get the governments they deserve . 
  if you hate putin and the russian government , you should drop the politically correct bs and hate russians too . 
  in this respect , i admire / u/jackblack2323 for his brutal honesty ( `` russians are assholes and i would gladly go to war against them if we started one '' ) . 
  it is an issue that i have [ extensively explored ] ( http://akarlin.com/2012/02/education-elixir-of-growth-3/ ) myself , not to even mention the work of more famous men like charles murray , richard lynn , and thilo sarrazin . 
  i have a number of disagreements with him ( which non-ideologue does n't with any politician ? 
  ) , - the continued prevalence of red tape and corruption prominent among them - but these are not cardinal ones . 
  also , i have come to the conclusion that those issues might not even be all that malleable to radical change within the timescales of political cycles . 
  these things are cultural , [ maybe even genetic to an extent ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hajnal_line ) ; southern europe , for instance , is today more corrupt and dysfunctional than the north , just as it was for centuries beforehand , but that has n't stopped them from converging to almost-german/british development levels . 
  so i 'm sure that russia will continue steadily getting better . 
  the example of ukraine , which has massively underperformed even belarus , shows that worshipping western ways and plaintatively clutching at their lapels is no panacea . 
  so , in short , i 'm happy to give putin a lot of slack even on these issues . 
  here = where ? 
  there might well be one or two eu countries where this has happened , though i do n't really see how it could possible - almost invariably , muslim fertility rates are higher , their populations are younger ( so fewer deaths and more births ) , and they continue to immigrate in large numbers . 
  you can well try to argue that the cultural diversity they bring is `` good , '' or that europe `` needs '' the young workers , but you ca n't reasonably deny that the muslim minority in western europe as a whole is steadily growing from an already substantial one into a major one . 
  see the british censuses between 2001 and 2011 for an example where the rate of muslim growth surprised to the * upside * . 
  i 'm a russian who votes for putin , identifies with reactionary political philosophy , and reads steve sailer . 
  do you now see why i agree with most of it ? 
  i 'm aware the eurabia projections are crackpot , though as an unapologetic russian nationalist i can always dream ... :p that said , the share of the muslim population will still go up drastically , burdening the european welfare states even further ( since immigrants ' iq , and hence capacity for economic improvement , [ is far lower ] ( http://akarlin.com/2012/05/berlin-gets-bad-news-from-pisa/ ) than that of the native population ) . 
  some european states like france or the netherlands might also become to a certain extent balkanized , with political parties and preferences becoming demarcated by ethnic lines . 
  the moderate `` far right '' parties merely represent what would have been considered `` normal '' on matters such as multiculturalism and `` tolerance '' a couple of decades ago . 
  it is today 's pc climate that is absolutely lunatic . 
  i am almost certain you will be silently apologizing to le pen , and wishing you could rewind the clock , in a few more decades . 
  [ you 're a bit late to the comparison ] ( http://darussophile.com/2008/11/a-gem-or-rather-a-ring-from-lucas/ ) . 
  anyhow , i 'm having fun envisioning / u/mrs _ thinktank_fairy enjoying her retirement in a niqab c. 2050 , staring longingly at the russian empire just east of the dnieper - the last remaining outpost of civilization in europe . 
  this is a fake quote . 
  putin never said that , though i do agree with it to a large extent . 
  oh no , someone on the internet has a different opinion from me , he must be a bot or a paid-up shill !, 
  as a west ukrainian ( not a banderist , but pro-maidan ) acquaitance told me , the west ukrainians are a bit like germans in this respect - fairly non-violent , but when they do become violent , all hell breaks loose ( see ww2 ) . 
  in east slavic states , crime rates ( especially violent crime ) is heavily correlated with rates of alcohol consumption , and on average russians tend to binge more . 
  you can easily see it in russia itself , where homicide rates are higher in siberia than in european russia ; super-high amongst the siberian indigenous people ; but below average in dagestan and chechnya , even though banditry/organized crime is much more rife there . 
  only 3/5 of them do , while in the coe it 's more like [ one versus a hundred ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exlpgdbqsgm ) . 
  do n't worry for us , we can handle those odds !, 
   he lamented the fact that turkey has put up with europe 's condescending attitude for years , allowing itself to be used and burdened . 
  `` today we no longer need this , '' he said . 
  bulut also described the us as the sole representative of all western values . 
  the puppets are beginning to chafe and nibble at their strings !, 
  excellent news . 
  i hope we leave it - not only pace , but the coe , echr , and osce - altogether and stop wasting russian taxpayer money on those russophobic eurocratic sleazebags . 
  i support this . 
  let russians know , loud and clear , what european values are all about . 
  give us a great justification for banning the shit out of all your propaganda outlets and presstitutes . 
  so what ? 
  right sector types do have a presence , if a pretty minimal one , in the south and east . 
  but one viper can kill just as easily as a snakepit . 
  thank you , once again , for clearly stating what this joke called `` european values '' is all about . 
  you are always most helpful in this regard . 
  sergey larenkov has already done this , and much better . 
  http://sergey-larenkov.livejournal.com/ http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2219584/ghosts-war-artist-superimposes-world-war-ii-photographs-modern-pictures-street-scenes.html, 
   the thing is that most of russians think like that . 
  even educated , high-income , middle class , young , etc. 
  part . 
  sadly . 
  and it gives you endless amounts of butthurt , amusing us no end . 
   sigh not a single documented case of banderivtsy attacking civilian russian-speakers or ethnic russians . . not a single documented case of course not . 
  they call it applying `` modern makeup '' for free . 
  [ here is a personal account of how dastardly russians manipulate public opinion on the web ] ( http://darussophile.com/2009/03/translation-confessions-of-russian-liberal/ ) . 
  here is another trollish piece of news : [ as was recently discovered ] ( http://112.ua/obshchestvo/glava-mvd-harkovskoy-oblasti-zayavil-ob-otsutstvii-rossiyan-sredi-zaderzhannyh-iz-za-zahvata-oga-46077.html ) , not one of the 64 arrested separatists in kharkov turned out to be russian citizens . 
  wo n't be surprised if before long , someone discovers the kharkov theater/mayoral office snafu was also fake . 
  ukrainian nationalists have convinced themselves that all ukrainians hate russia and want to canonize bandera ergo the protesters in the east must all be putin 's agents who ought to be exterminated . 
  i have been arguing and polemicizing in favor of this for years . 
  so great and glorious to see historical enlightenment seeping into official russia , after 25 years of pathetically tugging at the west 's coattails . 
  there should have been [ a 612 meter tower ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia_tower ) to top it all off , but it was not to be .

  [ haters gon na hate ... ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bi-id61caaeyoed.jpg ), 
  i doubt your right sector buddies follow putin 's orders on killing patriots or anything else for that matter , i 'm sorry to say . 
  let 's face it , the only reason orban is hated by liberals , internationalists , and the internationalist faux-left is that he rescued hungary from the clutches of the imf , paid off debts and revived the economy , and reasserted his sovereignty from brussels and frankfurt . 
  the only people to oppose him in hungary itself are discredited ex-commies with a penchant for lying and various marginal academics and journalists with links to the euro-atlantic political elites . 
  otherwise , he appears to be a true distillation of the will of the hungarian people . 
  how else to explain his sky-high approval ratings , and his electoral performance ? 
  personally , i do n't much care for it , as hungary like the rest of the eu has a russophobic orientation . 
  but that does n't stop me from seeing that many of the same character smears used against putin are now being applied to orban . 
  the turks will be well-advised to keep well away from the european cesspool . 
  for 50 years they have strived to be admitted to the club , only to be humiliated over and over again . 
  just for the privilege of being ruled by rootless neoliberal elites from brussels and frankfurt . 
  time to end this sick charade , which only feeds the smug arrogance of the western masters , and revive the ottoman empire instead . 
  also love your double standards . 
  insult and practically defecate ( see above ) all over christians , especially orthodox christians , but god forbid any harm comes to the delicate sensitivities of muslims . 
  i see you have assimilated well the lessons imparted to you by your cultural marxist gurus in europe . 
  no , it had nothing to do with 282 . 
  the relevant article is [ 213 ] ( http://www.zakonrf.info/uk/213/ ) ( `` gross violation of the social order '' that expresses `` patent contempt towards society '' on `` motives of political , ideological , racial , national , * or religious hatred or enmity * '' , and that is `` committed by a group of people by prior agreement or by an organised group '' ) . 
  [ extracts from their lyrics ] ( http://freepussyriot.org/content/lyrics-songs-pussy-riot ) : `` black robe , golden epaulettes all parishioners crawl to bow '' `` the head of the kgb , their chief saint '' `` shit , shit , the lord 's shit ! '', 
  `` virgin mary , mother of god , become a feminist '' so yes , that qualifies . 
  ftr , i opposed the sentence , which i found to be very excessive , but i 'm not going to let bs about the legal basis for it stand either . 
  it 's not this that infuriates me but the double standards . 
  this happens in an eu country , nobody cares . 
  same happens in russia , cpj and other hr organizations kick up a fuss . 
  guy puts bacon on a mosque [ gets ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-24130079 ) prison in the uk and is imprisoned after admitting his guilt , pussy riot sings anti-christian songs in a russian church and is imprisoned after mocking the court dominates western headlines for months on end . 
  [ boris stomakhin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boris_stomakhin ) , who called on chechens to commit terrorism against russians and was imprisoned , was presented as a human rights hero and an imprisoned journalist by the west and its russian lickspittles .

  free speech in the west lol .
