  have a fun winter !, 
  i support china , and have long done so . 
  the russian elites should purge themselves of their idiotic zapadnophilia once and for all . 
  russia today has two choices , and i suppose its better if these were to be made clear ( i.e. 
  via sanctions ) sooner rather than later : ( 1 ) join china , the future global superpower , and serve it from a relatively privileged position ; ( 2 ) piteously beg the west for the honor of being a slave to it and fighting china to the last russian . 
  idiot russian liberals seriously prefer the latter , but any reasonable person will pick the former . 
  if there are sanctions from europe and the us , i do hope russia retaliates in a like manner . 
  remember that agreement to not sell s-300 's to iran ? 
  invalidated . 
  nasa is reliant on russia for human spaceflight capabilities . 
  that 's just too bad . 
  supply routes to afghanistan depend on russian support to a considerable extent . 
  close them . 
  if the us/europe go so far as to sanction russian companies , well , there are opportunities here as well . 
  seizing foreign assets will hurt russia much more than the west , so that is a bad idea . 
  there are better methods . 
  i would recommend blocking google and facebook , for the purely humanitarian reason of protecting russians from nsa spying . 
  let yandex and vkontakte take their market share . 
  mikhail dobkin had resigned as head of the kharkov oblast state administration to run for the coming presidential elections . 
  he is now in a pre-trial detainment center of the sbu ( the ukrainian version of fsb/kgb ) . 
  `` i will hurt you for this . 
  i do n't know how yet , but give me time . 
  a day will come when you think yourself safe and happy , and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth , and you 'll know the debt is paid . '', 
  there are more fascists per capita amongst the banderites . 
   they are allowed to study in moscow universities without any entering exams for free and so on . 
  while most of / u/bargerofhate 's points are true , this is a russian nationalist myth . 
  in theory , i would support a referendum in chechnya , for the reasons given by most of the other russians here . 
  in practice , the two times that chechnya assumed de facto independence ended catastrophically ( no pensions , criminalization , wahhabi camps , return of slavery , mass ethnic cleansing of russians that western human rightists could n't care less about ) . 
  will this time be different ? 
  i doubt it . 
  so realistically i think the status quo , imperfect is it might be , is much safer than renewed political experimentation . 
  here 's what a dagestani thinks about chechens : http://darussophile.com/2013/07/why-pugachev-residents-are-angry/#comment-19061 the cultural differences probably stem from the lowlander/highlander thing . 
  so i take it all the afghani and iraqi elections after 2001 and 2003 , respectively , were illegitimate ? 
  truly a heroic stand that is rightfully being applauded throughout the western media . 
  just like the [ resignations of al jazeera journalists ] ( http://rt.com/news/al-jazeera-rebels-phones-lebanon-281/ ) in 2012 over its syria and bahrain coverage . 
  truly marvelous to behold the consistency and high universal principles at play here . 
  they do n't arrest anybody when protests are sanction , and do n't beat anyone when they are peaceful - as in the rest of the civilized world ( aka not ukraine ) . 
  [ all 1.5 % of them ] ( http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/news/2014/03/02/n_5986737.shtml ) . 
  and that 's excluding the south/east oblasts . 
  it appears you 're right . 
  the rt article i read did n't make that explicitly clear . 
  for the most part , i do not understand the reasons for making this ... so overt . 
  with a referendum scheduled for may 25 - one that the russian crimeans were sure to `` win '' - things were coming along swimmingly as they were . 
  any overly visible military involvement would diminish the credibility of russia 's narrative ( of aggressive banderists ) , and besides provide a point around which ukrainians could rally around as opposed to being distracted by factional infighting and economic collapse . 
  government porn headquarters, 
  i try . 
  it 's a sure thing as / r/europe is dominated by liberal fanatics . 
  apparently , the russian flag has also just been raised . 
  unless recent events have drastically changed calculations , it would take decades for ukraine to join up - and that 's comitant on there being steady support for euro-integration across multiple future administrations . 
  you are not incorrect , of course , but as i said above , i just do n't think this issue is * critical * . 
  who constitute 12 % of the population . 
  short of them having chechen-like demographics , and i doubt that , they are just not going to be make a big difference . 
  ukraine has less than a third of russia 's population ( of which many are abroad anyway ) , about a tenth of its gdp , is a financial basketcase , and the western areas would be a net liability rather than an asset anyway in any integration scenario . 
  so in terms of international power , ukraine is a `` nice to have , '' but very far from `` must have '' so far as russia is concerned . 
  actually crimea has pretty good demographics by ukrainian standards - the fifth best birth rate by oblast , and the 8th best death rate . 
  `` over those 11 minutes or more he was fighting for breath , and i could see both of his fists were clenched the entire time , '' wrote father lawrence hummer , the catholic priest who gave mcguire his last rites and witnessed the execution . 
  `` there is no question in my mind that dennis mcguire suffered greatly over many minutes . '' - and his victims did n't ? 
  * let the downvote frenzy begin *, 
  in fairness , total medals is more rational . 
  are they also going to be sending yarosh and the other militant opposition leaders to the hague ? 
  or did the dozen or so policemen who died in the riots shoot themselves ? 
  [ no ] ( http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/nationality/crimea ) . 
  `` quite a large percentage '' = 12 % . 
  i support this , the more the west spits on russia 's face , the greater will be the stimulus for russia to consolidate itself and ally itself with china , the wave of the future . 
  fuck europe . 
  russia 's future is eurasia . 
  probably not . 
  yeltsin had balls , even if he was a stupid alcoholic . 
  yet another reason to support belarus . 
  if europe wishes to give its breiviks free five-star accomodations for 20 years , more power to them . 
  normal countries do n't understand this and do n't need it . 
  here is [ a graph ] ( http://akarlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/industrialized-transition.png ) showing the resounding failures of belorussian dictatorship against the unparalleled successes of ukrainian democracy . 
  how could ordinary normal people possibly support lukashenko ? 
  so the russian liberal 's criterion for truth is for three `` serious '' people to claim it as such ? 
  thanks for the info !, 
  think of all the conspiracy theories that are now qed ` ed !, 
  iraqi wmd 's really are real , who could have imagined ? 
  russia attacked georgia first !, 
  global warming is a fraud , and the kyoto protocols are a conspiracy to undermine russia !, 
  ( because illarianov says so ) . 
  also , please stop putting words into my mouth . 
  i am not asking you to stop speaking , but to stop speaking in the names of `` russians '' ( of which you and your ilk are a vanishingly small subgroup ) . 
  russia 's productivity lag is all because of putin and has absolutely nothing to do with the legacy of soviet central planning . 
  just look at latvia or georgia , countries that opted for the euro-atlantic choice , and how much more productive than russia they are ... oh wait . 
  seconded . 
  / u/3dom , please stop speaking for `` russians . '', 
  the only ones who think its fascist are you and your gaggle of shenderoviches and illarianovs . 
  they are . 
  [ mighty and majestic ones ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/goldeneagle-nova.jpg ) . 
   democracy and the rule of law would already be well-rooted in ukraine if it were n't for constant , significant russian interference . 
   it would be more like the liberation of france from the nazis in wwii than of the liberation of aghanistan from the taliban in 2003 . 
  there would probably be victory parades and ukrainian women throwing themselves at us soldiers . 
  you have an apt name . 
  only a `` thinktank fairy '' could possibly believe that . 
  [ and the americans are n't ] ( http://www.ukrainebusiness.com.ua/news/11217.html ) ? 
   however , this sort of thing may set a dangerous precedent . 
  let 's imagine these dolphins reproduce like mad , and become essentially `` pests '' by destroying their environment , eating all the other sea-life and ressources . 
  if they have `` human rights '' , we ca n't use pest control against them , although pest control is also a way to protect their species as well , ensuring that they do n't eat all of their own food . 
  was pest control used against human populations when they destroyed their environment ? 
  no , famine took care of that , every few centuries or so .
