  is n't it funny and oh so convenient how every foreigner who does n't submit to the western agenda in heart and soul inevitably becomes a rapist , \\ a chest-thumping xenophobe , a raving anti-semite , or some other sundry scumbag ? 
  what is it like being a satrapy of a foreign country ? 
  this just goes to further show that the conservative/social democratic split in european politics is mostly artificial , as both ultimately answer to the same elites and subscribe to the same neoliberal , western-universalist ideology . 
  the only political forces who advocate sovereignty over serfdom are nationalists , anarchists ( pirates ) , greens , and the remnants of the old left . 
  according to nikolay alexeyev , one of russia 's most prominent gay rights activists , a large percentage of these asylum seekers are n't genuine gays but simply people looking for a permanent residency in europe . 
  kasparov and some other extremely marginal russian political figures have been in the business of skullfucking godwin in their campaign against their own country for more than a decade now . 
  meanwhile , their influence remains limited to the doors of a few east coast american neocon thinktanks . 
  idiotic conspiracy theory invented by a russian traitor craving for attention . 
  sure , why not ... but only if romania gives back all its lands to the getae first . 
  then you 'll migrate , and `` fight for '' other lands , or whatever . 
  anyway , you 're comparing apples and oranges on multiple levels here , but your seething russophobia blinds you to it . 
  in any case my scenario does n't benefit russia but jews . 
  not the palestinians , at any rate . 
  who were not at all responsible for the holocaust and did not deserve to answer for evils born in europe . 
  are you a troll ? 
  ( this is a rhetorical question ) . 
  i mean neutral , quite obviously . 
  it has been my long-held opinion that it would have been better to give kaliningrad and part of east germany to the jews , post-war . 
  they surely deserved it if anyone did . 
  furthermore , it would have avoided the current clusterfuck in israel/palestine , and a finlandized `` israel '' in the middle of europe would have made the situation there a lot less tense during the cold war .

  * it may not be absolutely black and white but it surely looks like the countries that sided with russia after 1990 are doing poorly and countries that sided with the eu are doing well . 
  * which explains why belarus was [ the single best performer ] ( http://akarlin.com/2010/03/transition-reckoning/ ) relative to a 1989 benchmark out of all the former socialist industrialized countries . 
  do you want to see a graph that will * really * blow your mind ? 
  look at belarus . 
  this is completely and utterly unsurprising , but still worth noting [ russians do n't support euromaidan ] ( http://www.levada.ru/29-01-2014/sobytiya-v-ukraine-maidan ) at all . 
  4 % see it as peaceful protest , 84 % as an attempt at a violent coup . 
  that said , blame is divided about equally between the opposition , yanukovych , and the west . 
  ( only 3 % blame the russian government ) . 
  a quarter support yanukovych , 10 % support the protesters , and most do n't support anyone there . 
  there is a very diverse set of outlooks on ukraine 's future prospects . 
  i wish ukraine could come up with some opinion polls of its own on the matter . 
  in particular , it would be interesting to see whether yanukovych 's ham-fisted idiocy has cost him support , or whether this was outweighed by formerly apathetic eastern ukrainians coming back to him because of the growing visibility of the banderites . 
  russian journalists [ are barred from ] ( http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/news/2014/01/29/n_5910993.shtml ) catherine ashton 's briefing in kiev . 
  nice way to show their concern for free speech/media in russia . 
  furthermore , it 's curious to note that the invited journalists were all handpicked ( according to a member of the eu delegation ) , and that it was in a `` closed format '' in which the invitees were forbidden from disclosing the location of the meeting . 
  this is speculation , but to me this indicates that ashton was giving out instructions to `` loyal '' journalists on how to cover euromaidan . 
  bandera was arrested by the nazis in july 1941 , but the oun 's policy for the coming war [ was formulated in may 1941 ] ( http://rid.org.ua/?p=101 ) . 
  you 're right . 
  the gap is unusually big - usually its just a few percentage points - and the roundness of the figures ( either 0 's or .33 's ! ), 
  hints at a very small sample . 
  here is some relevant data from a more legitimate source : http://www.razumkov.org.ua/eng/poll.php?poll_id=305, 
   even putin 's daughter lives in eu !, 
  your other points are valid enough , but this particular one is just speculation . 
  there is no confirmed information about the whereabouts of either of putin 's two daughters . 
  he wanted to be in europe from 2000-2012 , before he switched to a more `` eurasian '' platform . 
  i think what `` clicked '' was that he finally realized europe was no longer the europe of his generation 's imagination , but something entirely different - postmodern , ultra-liberal , de-nationalized , culturally universalist . 
  alien . 
  he 'd have fit in well with the europe of de gaulle and adenauer . 
  not so much with the europe of stephen fry and pussy riot .

  in an obviously tit-for-tat move , the crimean parliament bans svoboda on its territory .

  plus poltava now . 
  it 's the slavic temperament , which yo-yo 's between extremes .

  in the spirit of their selfless commitment to democracy and european values , ternopil and ivano-frankivsk oblast radas ban the party of regions and the communist party from engaging in political activities on their territory ; threaten their members with prosecution if they do n't resign immediately .

  they pretended to be europeans from 1700-1917 , and again from 1991-until fairly recently ( i think putin has finally come to his senses on this matter ) . 
  nothing good came of such pretenses , because as de custine acutely observed and trubetzkoy confirmed , , the results of aping an alien civilization are an abomination , rootless and artificial , that will sooner or later be swept away . 
  if you think turkey is any more gay-friendly than russia then you are rather deluded i 'm sorry to say . 
  in any case , using homophilia as a proxy for europeaness is quite absurd considering that by that standard no country at all could have qualified as being `` european '' before the 1970s or so . 
  i 'm a eurasianist , so as far as i 'm concerned europe stops at the visegrad-ukraine/belarus and balt-russia border . 
  the balkans ( including romania and bulgaria ) are semi-european , a real twilight zone of sorts , while turkey is not european at all , despite the tortured attempts by some sectors of their society to pretend otherwise . 
  could you please explain why this is a bs offer ? 
  the pm is much more powerful vis-a-vis the president in ukraine than in russia . 
  a new pm will need a new cabinet , which includes the defense ministry and the interior ministry - both vital positions in any physical power struggle . 
  what 's more , with this offer yanukovych appears to have once again stabbed his own people in the back and contributed to a lowering in regime morale . 
  i am flabbergasted that the opposition would consider this an insignificant concession . 
  to me it looks like yanukovych was going for an own goal and the opposition for whatever reason blocked it . 
  translation from georgian : cross-border anti-terrorism cooperation with a sovereign republic that does n't want to be part of georgia = russia expanding its borders . 
  two can play this independence/oblast rights game . 
  http://www.e-news.in.ua/in-ukraine/747-krym-vyhodit-iz-sostava-ukrainy.html crimean rada declares 78/81 ( 2 abstentions , one against ) it will not accept any edict coming from maidan and would refuse to remain part of a banderite ukraine . 
  the ukrainian army is apolitical , as is typical in the post-soviet space , and answers to the president . 
  the power of the street is overrated , both in general ( even the orange revolution was ultimately the result of a judicial decision ) and specifically ( the protesters have nowhere near the mass that the arab revolts did , and in any case the violence and radicalization now in evidence will just drive a lot of people away ) . 
  so yanukovych will remain in power at least until the next elections . 
  civil war , secession of individual oblasts , and street revolution are all pipedreams . 
  i believe this is far too early to say what happened with any degree of confidence . 
  the situation is chaotic , and claim is followed by counter-claim . 
  arrests : 7,700 + injuries : 400 + deaths : 32 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occupy_movement though on closer examination , that 's the worldwide total .

  said circumstances being protesters throwing molotov cocktails - weapons originally designed to roast crews in armored vehicles - at the police . 
  at this rate , there would have been casualties before too long in any country , no matter how `` democratic , '' and no amount of downvotes to my original comment will change that fact . 
  let 's keep this in perspective . 
  number killed in 2013 turkey riots : 11 number killed during occupy wall street ( total ) ~ ~ in the us ~ ~ worldwide : 32 number killed in bronze soldier estonia riots : 1 number killed in kiev : 3 + so , worse than estonia , but still some ways to catch up with turkey and the us . 
  but the usual suspects are already clamoring for sanctions .
