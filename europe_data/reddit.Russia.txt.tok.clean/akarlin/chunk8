  compare and contrast with yuropean ukraine . 
  the latvian whines about those rashan barbarians and demands apologies but goes into a barely concealed psychotic rage ( antisemitism vey ! ), 
  as soon as a vaguely similar standard is applied to his country . 
  fact : the bolsheviks never represented russians either , getting less than 25 % in the only real elections ever held in what would become the ussr apart from a few at the end . 
  fact : the bolsheviks hated russian culture and nationalism , and the ussr , especially its early version when most of its crimes took place , was heavily staffed by ethnic minorities ( stalin and beria - georgians , dzerzhinsky - a pole , yagoda and nearly 40 % of the nkvd - jews ) - to boot . 
  fact : the latvian riflemen helped crush rebellions against bolshevik rule in moscow and yaroslavl . 
  no they did not singlehandedly win the war for the bolsheviks , but they sure helped more than they hindered , and the contribution was especially impressive when set against latvia 's population size . 
  unlike baltic hypocrites , i am not blaming anyone , but likewise i have no time for or truck for anyone demanding that i apologize . 
  likewise , any russian yurop-licker who does apologize will not be speaking for me or the majority of normal russians .

  i bet the liflyandskaya guberniya 's 72 % vote ( the highest in the russian empire ) for the bolsheviks in the 1917 constituent assembly elections is something they do n't talk about in latvia and estonia ... 
  nor about how the latvian red riflemen put down anti-bolshevik insurrections within russia . 
  when will latvia finally find the courage come to terms with its shared historical responsibility for the soviet regime alongside the [ poles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/felix_dzerzhinsky ) , the [ jews ] ( http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-3342999,00.html ) , and the [ georgians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lavrentiy_beria ) ?? 
  considering that 70 % of latvians [ voted for ] ( https://www.electoralgeography.com/new/ru/wp-content/gallery/russia1917/1917-russia-bolsheviks.png ) the bolsheviks in 1917 and their [ instrumental role ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvian_riflemen ) in imposing the soviet regime on russians , i do n't really see what the big deal is - they merely got what they wanted , just with a big time lag . 
  the latvian ssr was the only soviet republic with a democratic mandate but as usual russians are to blame .

  the stupid will continue receiving the painful lessons they so desperately seek and need . 
  for a much fuller exploration and analysis of the data , check out the recent paper [ immigrant crime in germany 2012-2015 ] ( https://osf.io/q83nu/ ) by / u/deleetdk . 
   number of suspects per capita were estimated for immigrants in germany grouped by citizenship . 
  this was correlated with national iqs ( r = -.53 ) and islam prevalence in the home countries ( r = .49 ) , congruent with other studies . 
  multivariate analyses revealed that there was a confound with the mean age and sex distribution of the groups in germany . 
    the german data lacked age and sex information for the crime data and so it was not possible to adjust for age and sex using subgroup analyses . 
  for this reason , an alternative adjustment method was developed . 
  this method was tested on the detailed danish data which does have the necessary information to carry out subgroup analyses . 
  the new method was found to give highly congruent results with the standard subgrouping method . 
    the german crime data were then adjusted for age and sex using the new method and these were analyzed with respect to the predictors . 
  they were moderately to strongly correlated with national iqs ( .46 ) and islam prevalence in the home country ( .35 ) . 
  combining national iq , islam % and distance to germany resulted in a model with a cross-validated r2 of 20 % , equivalent to a correlation of .45,

  not disputing iceland , it is indeed off the charts . 
  but speaking about [ fide 's elo 2200 + statistics ] ( https://ratings.fide.com/topfed.phtml ) , linked to in my first post , russia has more of them both absolutely and ** relative to its population ** than germany , france , etc. , all of which are given a higher share by the map . 
  2443 / 146 million --  1.7 / 100k ( russia ) 1318 / 82 million --  1.6 / 100k ( germany ) - suspect former gdr accounts for like half of them . 
  405 / 65 million --  0.6 / 100k ( france ) 315 ( 270 england + 40 scots + 5 welsh ) / 65 million --  0.5 / 100k ( uk ) two explanations for the discrepancy : ( 1 ) much larger share of russians and other east europeans perform very well at chess ( 2200 + ) while much fewer , relative to western europeans , perform respectably well at chess ( 1800-2200 ) . 
  ( 2 ) could [ the data ] ( https://ratings.fide.com/topfed.phtml ) i got from fide be wrong while the map-makers data ( which i have been unable to find at fide ) be right ? 
  i suppose that is possible , but it 's also the case that the share of the most elite players correlates far better with the former than the latter . 
  there is also the basic element of observation . 
  it 's not exactly a secret that chess is far more popular in the east than it is in the west . 
  it seems pretty unlikely based on these stats : https://ratings.fide.com/topfed.phtml titled masters are everyone from candidate masters and up , that is , everyone with an elo rating of 2200 + . 
  there are about [ 10,000 titled players ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elo_rating_system#fide_ratings ) in the world , of which 2,443 are russians . 
  this proportion is slightly bigger than in germany ( 1,318 ) , much bigger than in france ( 405 ) or in england ( 270 ) , etc. 
  at a glance , of the top 20 countries only small ones like armenia , hungary , czechia , cuba , and israel have a larger proportion . 
  almost all are , not unexpectedly , from the old soviet sphere ( or in israel 's case have a lot of soviet immigrants ) . 
  map is of players with an elo of  1800 , but i really doubt that the relative weight of different countries will be very different between  1800 and  2200 . 
  i have tried using the database linked from the map ( https://ratings.fide.com/advseek.phtml ) but have n't been able to figure out make it spit out that data . 
  which would automatically result in a large scale purge , leading to massive outflows of wealth ( including people who made their money legitimately ) , probably more western sanctions ( this would be the khodorkovsky affair x 100 ) , and a recession far deeper than the one in the past 2 years . 
  and at the end of it you get a bunch of state-owned industries that will have to be privatized again anyway ( who 's gon na buy lol ) .
