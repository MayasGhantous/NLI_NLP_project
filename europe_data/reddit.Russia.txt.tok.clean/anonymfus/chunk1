because there are still innocent people who live here and they need to be protected . 
  because if ukrainian army leave , front line will be moved and other chunk of ukraine will be absorbed by separatists . 
  ukraine has \u0412\u0435\u0447\u0456\u0440\u043d\u0456\u0439 \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b and \u0412\u0435\u0447\u0456\u0440\u043d\u0456\u0439 \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432 by \u0421\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0456\u044f \u041a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b-95 : https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0412\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0439_\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0421\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0456\u044f_\u041a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b-95 http://kvartal95.com/ru/video http://www.youtube.com/channel/ucfcvlxinb4vuadflgqeqqaa, 
  what are their economical priorities ? 
   we get people from all over the world trying to make their way here , why are there so many africans on the coast of france trying to get into britain , why do n't they go to italy or estonia ? 
  language . 
   the problem is that let 's say 51 % vote for independence and a few months later 2 % change their mind ( very likely as independence often brings years of economical hardships ) and want to go back to the uk again , what then ? 
  go back to the uk just like that ? 
  why not ? 
  it would be more informed decision . 
  evidence based politics :-), 
  actually , more like most people here do n't believe in self-organisation . 
  acting president having full media control probably could change public opinion to any side 20th congress style . 
  if that happens today acting president will be medvedev . 
  like with putin in the year 2000 , nobody really knows who could he be as independent figure . 
  or more direct comparison : in 1996 during president elections in russia state tv channel made tv marathon of brazilian series `` mulheres de areia '' to sway elder women to stay home . 
  i heard that you have many hydroaccumulating ( pumped-storage ) power plants for regulation . 
  because alaska do n't have `` significant ethnic-russian or pro-russian populations '' today . 
  i was disagreeing with / u/martelfirst, 
   any use of nuclear weapons by russia on these areas would make them an instant pariah . 
  no one would deal with them anymore that could be the goal . 
  maidan showed to putin that hybrid regime can be overthrown , so he now wants to replicate `` success '' of north korea , and such thing requires political and economical isolation . 
  who are `` they '' ? 
  radical patriots want to take as much as russia ever had , up to alaska . 
  putin wants to feed public imperial ambitions as justification for degradation of quality of life . 
  more like [ hubert bonisseur de la bath ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oss_117 ) . 
  may be i am a pervert , but i liked opening ceremony of the london olympics , except parts about music history and internationally unknown soap operas with people dancing . 
  to bomb voronezh . 
  what is her opinion about south stream today ? 
  she and her husband are probably corruption beneficiaries . 
  prove this , confiscate their property and arrest them . 
  2 ) mirror of that page as a convincing argument that these screenshots were legitimate : http://www.peeep.us/53d16041, 
   pochemuchka ( person who asks too many questions ) is russian and feeds into all the tales of oppresssive russian governments no . 
  this is literally why + diminutive suffix , it 's about kids who ask their parents `` why ? '', 
  about everything too much . 
  sometimes both sides of the conflict could lose . 
  expected it to be advertising for transport museum :-(, 
  that was joke about ussr . 
  first , you must shoot all your monarchs ... 
  union of social-democratic european republics, 
   i am sad russians do n't have proper representation from the side of a non-biased russian party . 
  one of reasons for this could be their `` non-citizenship '' . 
  the difference between gauges is 1520-1435 = 85 mm . 
  these 8.5 cm are hard to see . 
  trains running out of tallinn use 1520 mm . 
  trams are 1067 mm . 
  that depends on definition of high speed . 
  rest of russia would be a big grey network of '' < 200 km/h '' lines . 
  see [parovoz.com ] ( http://www.parovoz.com/maps/supermap/ ) 's [ big map of all railways in post-soviet countries ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v4nrrue.png ) . 
  putting economical interests above human lives is wrong . 
  war is force majeure . 
  what exactly do you mean when you say `` sensationalist communism-bashing and putin-bashing '' ? 
  we are truly the country with unpredictable past . 
   also is n't the polish parliament called `` sejm '' ? 
  only lower house . 
  same as with russian state duma . 
  so , always recognise them in first turn , but recognise them in second turn only if it gets first or second place in first turn . 
  treat this option as a candidate . 
  he can just say tomorrow that elections were falsified . 
  by bombing voronezh ... 
  according to [ wikipedia article about vk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vk_\\ ( social_network \\ ) #italian _ controversy ) , it was banned only in italy . 
  copyright laws . 
  it 's really udmurt : http://ispol.com/sasha/platypus/  dzhkzhnyr '' is in udmurt, 
  no , urdekborin is a tatar word . 
  by location it 's probably komi or udmurt language . 
  according to first and only [ russian-udmurt dictionary ] ( http://udmurtinfo.ru/russko-udmurtskij-slovar/perevodzik.php?search=%f3%f2%ea%ee%ed%ee%f1 ) from google 's search results , it 's '' \u04f5\u04e7\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0440 '' , where every letter is a single sound , second and fifth sounds are vowels . 
  because dictionary was created before \u04f5 and \u04e7 characters were added to unicode , they used \u045f and \u045c as replacements . 
  so \u04f5\u04e7\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0440 \u2192 \u045f\u045c\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0440 ( one vowel converted to consonant ) \u2192 dzhkzhnyr ( somebody tried to transcript it as macedonian ) . 
  according to [ wikipedia article about udmurt alphabet ] ( http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0423\u0434\u043c\u0443\u0440\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f_\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c#.d0.a1.d0.be.d0.b2.d1.80.d0.b5.d0.bc.d0.b5.d0.bd.d0.bd.d1.8b.d0.b9_.d0.b0.d0.bb.d1.84.d0.b0.d0.b2.d0.b8.d1.82 ) , right pronunciation is more like `` tshozhnyr '' , where `` tsh '' ( \u04f5 ) is a single consonant like russian `` ch '' ( \u0447 ) , only harder ; o ( \u04e7 ) is a unique vowel used only in udmurt language , it 's similar to [ english \u028c ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open-mid_back_unrounded_vowel ) ; rest contains only russian sounds . 
  in reality there were suggestions to rename simferopol to putin : http://www.bbc.co.uk/russian/society/2014/04/140409_crimea_putin_city.shtml, 
  counterargument is that opposition in russia is financed mainly by donations from citizens and private business , so may be better idea would be to find out political views of owners of producers . 
  salary in russian police is much bigger than in ukrainian police . 
  policeman 's salary in ukraine is barely enough to survive . 
  because ukrainian police is very corrupt , they also have a fear of lustration or ever police dismantlement after president elections like in georgia in 2005 , and that without bribes ordinary policemen would not survive and chiefs of police would not be able to support luxury lifestyle . 
  strange thing is that in russia we literally call group marriage `` swedish family '' . 
  [ countries where netflix is available ] ( http://i.imgur.com/olhww3o.png ), 
  corruption on such scale is impossible to hide . 
  ever if he had hired lord voldemort to cast vanishing spell on all his assets and memory charm on all witnesses and accomplices , there would be still satellite images left : http://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/articles/2013/03/4/6984712/, 
  it is not the only possible explanation , many people just repeat things from narrative that they heard on tv or from friends . 
  but he really was at least a corrupt fuck , so he had a real chance to go to jail . 
  no , [ moscow 2042 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_2042 ) . 
  putin will claim that these elections will have been rigged . 
  his style would be to make fake videos of voting fraud , flood social networks with them , and then all russian tv channels will show them as independent evidence . 
  to do himself all the things he usually accuses opposition of . 
  veto right in security council . 
  general assembly where nobody has veto could not directly sent un peacekeeping forces , but it could pass resolution which would legitimate sending forces by individual countries . 
  what are the things that hilary could do but obama can not ? 
  most of the old russians and old ukrainians are old ladies . 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/population_pyramid_of_russia_2009.png http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/2012_ukraine_population_pyramid.jpg also old men usually went through wars . 
  on these pictures ? 
  then use phone with 2 sim cards , one for local calls in belgium via belgium operator , other for cheaper international calls by romanian prices . 
  this is germany , same year : http://i.imgur.com/0mnabad.png ( [ source ] ( https://www.destatis.de/en/publications/specialized/population/statyearbook_chapter2_5011001129004.html ) ) somebody could map these pyramids to the same scale , but you could already see that in russia relative gap between number of people with age of 26 years old and with age of 13 years old is much bigger than in germany . 
  population `` pyramid '' of russia in 2010 : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/population_pyramid_of_russia_2009.png shift it on 4 years in your mind . 
  2014-03-15 14:00 msk antiwar protest in moscow is planned by opposition . 
  i was wrong about unlikeness : http://lenta.ru/news/2014/02/28/passports/ new law introduced in duma which could allow acquisition of new territories by referendums . 
  it would be smart to make a referendum about independence in crimea , but putin is pathologically afraid of fair elections and referendums , so i think that this is unlikely . 
  he could try to falsify one . 
  `` dad , after this new increase in vodka 's price you will drink less ? '', 
  -- `` no , sonnie , you will eat less . '', 
   economic blocade of the rf and and the crimea would do much more damage .
