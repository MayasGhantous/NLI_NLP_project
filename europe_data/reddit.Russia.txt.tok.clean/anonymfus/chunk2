  damage to whom ? 
  it will damage independent businesses and normal citizens , so it will enhance relative power of oil oligarchs and gasprom plutocrats who would still trade with china . 
  half of opposition will fly of russia , second half will die of starvation , rest of the people will completely depend on putin 's friends . 
   or maybe russia will just circumvent that problem by secretly arming pro-russian crimeans and have them do the dirty work , without russia needing to take the risk of an actual military intervention and potential blowback from the west . 
  this is too complicated for putin . 
  his style is to claim that by military intervention he would defend the territorial integrity of ukraine from `` fascists '' who captured western part of ukraine . 
  he is not very afraid of blowbacks from the west because any generic sanctions will harm his enemies in russia more than himself . 
  many plutocrats in russia are afraid of sanctions specific to their families because they have money , properties and children abroad , but it 's unlikely that any important ones will be in such list , see magnitsky act story . 
  unmarked submarine in ukrainian steppe died in uneven air-to-air combat . 
  sorry , can not stand to do n't use this old russian joke . 
  it 's still illegal in many countries : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:pornography_laws.svg, 
  only putin knows . 
  he said enough ignorant things that i can believe that he said this seriously , but it 's unlikely . 
  question was asked by bbc correspondent definitely as joke . 
   asked if an independent scotland could join a customs union with russia , he said : `` i would n't rule that out '' . 
  actually question was `` could it be possible that you will invite scots to the [ customs union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/customs_union_of_belarus,_kazakhstan,_and_russia ) ? '', 
  then all ex-ussr countries will have modern capitals as first . 
  ever in modern russia we still celebrate the day we get independence from ussr : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia_day, 
  are there any plans to do this more often than once per year ?

  there are enough contradictions in the bible about it for priests to twist . 
  for example , this bullshit recently came out from rybinsk eparchy : http://ruskline.ru/news_rl/2015/07/31/krokodilovy_slezy_otca_aleksiya_uminskogo/ author justifies food incineration on the base of taking of jericho story . 
   education index is calculated from the * mean years of schooling index * and the * expected years of schooling index * looks like all kinds of education are equal in this index . 
  i want to provide a context for the photo . 
  the reason why putin became associated with condoms is because he said in in his call-in tv show that white ribbons used by protesters reminded him condoms . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_ribbon#russian_protests_2011-2012 i like this illustrations by the russian cartoonist sergey yolkin ( \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0401\u043b\u043a\u0438\u043d ) : http://i.imgur.com/wtjzm.jpg http://i.imgur.com/a4vpo.jpg, 
  for russian laws second citizenship does n't exist . 
  it is not illegal , but it will not help you in russia . 
  he offered a rule over [ ural federal district ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ural_federal_district ) to the guy only known for saying to putin in a call-in show that he wants to take workers from his factory to go to protests to fight an opposition . 
  and than offering a citizenship to depardieu .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airplane#etymology_and_usage  first attested in english in the late 19th century ( prior to the first sustained powered flight ) , the word airplane , like aeroplane , derives from the french a\u00e9roplane,

   an existing road building project will be divided up into lots , irrespective of considerations of best value , scale or quality , so as to explicitly enable smaller engineering firms to bid for them ( instead of one of larger firms , who are generally more competitive ) . 
  wait , what ? 
  if larger firms are more competitive , why they can not make better bids than smaller firms ? 
  secret de polichinelle, 
  i agree . 
  the question is hypothetical . 
  can prisoners give permissions for such recordings and distributions ? 
   later books and movies like `` the shield and the sword '' have done their work . 
  the thing i was the most impressed was ** how ** a weak force , a literally ** one man can do something that was impossible for the whole armies ** . 
  ** one intelligence officer decided the fate and fortunes of the thousands of people .

  the worst names in russian are that kind of soviet names created by abbreviation and concatenation of words in political slogans .

  cassandra 's story was known many centuries before religion you talk about . 
  cassandra dilemma is a modern generic term for such things .

   because for sure vladimir putin is not suicidal and * he knows the consequences * this would have . 
  according to putin 's words in his official biography , in the kgb institute he was characterised by hindered sense of danger . 
  family is divorcing , they have a house and a car . 
  husband says that he must own the house and wife must own the car , wife says that she must own the house and husband must own the car .

   now countries would have to duke it out a la robot wars . 
  they 'd have to fight it out until one of the economies ca n't support the production of robots . 
  next step would be to make something similar to the geneva convention and have the fights on preset battlefields . 
  like in the [ peace on earth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace_on_earth_\\ ( novel \\ ) ) . 
  here in russia when putin was in stasis medvedev introduced permanent summer time , but after putin waked up he disliked it and made us all live in the permanent winter . 
  i think that start of the work day must be gradually changed during the year .

   merkel does n't have to go through the parliamentary process are there any supporters of this law in the parliament ? 
  as in the one old joke , the west always tries to convince russians that our leader is thief , racketeer , fraudster and murderer ignoring that these professions were always the most respectable in russia . 
  both . 
  yet another reason to ban cars in cities . 
  before latest waves of economic problems big russian cities hosted hundred thousands of illegal migrants working illegal jobs . 
  officially it was about 1 million of illegal migrants in moscow alone . 
  and why putin would want to stop them ? 
   lol eurogroup is an informal meeting of member states finance ministers , so all of them are elected in their respective countries . 
  that is a first-past-the-post system with state sized districts . 
  fridges are very complicated . 
  big volume means more air exchange when you open the door .
