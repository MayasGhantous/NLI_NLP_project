  [ obligatory vasily shulzhenko art ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aa1avpy.jpg ) the worst that i had seen were all on suburban railroad stations . 
  the typical construction was just a booth over a pit with rotten wooden floor with holes for shit in it . 
  old booths were made entirely from wood , but later walls were remade from bricks , and floors and pits were left untouched and they stopped to service them so in many of them wooden floor collapsed and shit reached the ground level . 
  the worst that i personally used were in various hospitals . 
  the typical situation was to have 8 toilets in one room without any walls and bunch of smoking patients and doctors . 
  the best i used was in the store near railroad station [ nara ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u041d\u0430\u0440\u0430%20\\ ( \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f \\ ) ) .

  they are supposed to have english training . 
  the system is corrupt so it 's possible that they passed exams by bribes .

   because religion or the lack thereof constitutes a core part of a person 's belief system so are political views . 
   imagine if alaska had been russian during the cold war . 
  there definitely would have been a real war why ? 
  executing such dictators means the loss of information about other people involved in these crimes . 
  all ruling elite deserves to go to jail in such cases but usually it 's left unpunished . 
   per capita ** public and private ** health expenditures combined in finland are $ 4,231.90 usd while croatia spends $ 908.30 usd  if finland were your home instead of croatia ** you would spend ** 4.7 times more money on health care this looks misleading . 
  for example , german constitution contains some mentions of `` gott '' ( god ) , so arabic translation of german constitution will contain some mentions of allah .

  we were in the `` eternal '' dst after medvedev 's reform , but putin disliked it so we are in the eternal winter now . 
  my rough translation :  we made a decision about gasoline : we pegged it 's price to the dollar . 
  how painful do you think such peg was ? 
  and now for supporting these very poor petroleum processing plants you propose , as i understand , to grab money from the people 's pockets through the gasoline . 
  right ? 
  seek these money in petroleum processing plants !, 
  that 's my answer to you . 
  if you fail to find them but i success both you and they will be poor . 
  leonid vasilievich ( minister of energy ) , please create the group and check petroleum processing plants by these criteria ( passes a4 folder ) . 
  and you will see how they run the show !, 
  and which salaries they have , which cars they drive , where they live , what build and so on . 
  start right now . 
  report me later . 
  there will be no any gasoline price increase . 
  we pegged gasoline to the dollar , it 's already enormous price for belarus , they should not rely on it ( price increase ) . 
  let them seek these money on petroleum processing plants and on sales to the external markets . 
  these are levers that can be used . 
  not simple ones !, 
  increasing prices is the thing that any fool can think up !, 
  there is no need for government for it . 
   that ' why there will not be any artificial price increase on petroleum refinery products in belarus . 
  thank you . 
  that 's because it 's a very direct translation from ukrainian or russian . 
   we are now seemingly as villified as the russians on this sub !, 
  i do n't feel vilified here .

   r/russian already gone full pyongyang you are probably confusing it with / r/russia .

  do irreligious avars practice fgm ? 
  in russian the verb which literally means `` to sit '' also means `` to serve time in prison '' . 
   the only thing that could change is that countries could find themselves financing the benefits in other countries . 
  the most important thing . 
  that makes it better both than the current situation with debt problems in countries with weak economies and than fiscal transfers . 
  no , because eu benefits would be financed by eu . 
  you can have a mixed system : eu can provide some minimal benefits and countries can add more benefits on the top of it .

   i think that paris will very likely be the new location . 
   i think the most likely next place will be amsterdam . 
  for me `` very likely '' means more than 50 % and `` most likely '' means more than any other variant , but in such case p ( paris ) + p ( amsterdam ) would be more than 100 % , so my assumptions are incorrect . 
  so can you just use numbers instead of these words ?

   as long as you 're not pissing on your hands you 're not going to get sick actually urine is almost sterile , you wash your hands to curb the spreading of bacteria living on the skin in your private parts . 
  depends on how it sounds in your head . 
  the article in russian wikipedia claims in the sidebar that there are 7 trains ( see '' \u0421\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043e '' line ) . 
  both : it has the separate alphabet where letters with similar sounds have the same encoding as in latin braille alphabets .

  let 's strangle the last libertarian with guts of the last communist !, 
  i accidentally deleted my comment which you responded for , i am sorry . 
  here it is :  in russia people disregard smoking bans * in trains * . 
  except in new trains possibly because of some broken windows theory magic . 
  estonia is one of the least religious countries in the world . 
  what is there to elaborate ? 
  it 's the same joke . 
  old soviet beds were assembled from metallic tubes . 
  i always heard a version of this joke with a bed and a multiple launch rocket system instead of a tractor and a tank . 
  in moscow metro which is also famous for its artworks i notice tourists only outside of rush hours so there is no problem .

   they will have their referendum , and they probably have something like 6x % in favour with a 6x % turnout . 
  what would happen if they will have an absolute majority ( for example a 71 % in favour with a 71 % turnout ) ? 
  how likely such situation is ? 
   that is was not  is was  is fuck me for this, 
  that is was not a hollywoodish gasoline explosion .
