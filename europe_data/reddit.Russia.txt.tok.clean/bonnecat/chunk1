nice german tanks near russia 's border . 
  ah , so only 50 % of russians are fashists for their support of putin according to western media . 
  got that , thanks for clarifying . 
  if they said that , it would be too openly nazi . 
  instead , they just say like putin is new hitler . 
  and leave it up to you to find out 80 % russians support putin , and do the math 2 +2 . 
  like german tanks near russian border ?

   who are the bad guys in your movies ? 
  russians watch a lot of foreign stuff , so it 's pointless to show something much different from it in russian movies . 
  you only can get a bad critique and lose audience that way . 
  just checked a list of recent russian movies and figured most of bad guys there are ... bad russian guys . 
  some of russian voice actors are just great . 
  pete glanz for example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2bt_ymi6mc his work on deadwood 1 was very impressive , i could n't believe it was a single man who made all those different male voices for a whole season . 
  why ? 
  dubbing and voice overs do n't mean subtitles are excluded . 
  do what , voiceover ? 
  most foreign blu-rays come with dubbed sound , but sometimes studios have no ' -1 ' sources i guess . 
  there are lots of unofficial studios , voiceover is their only option . 
  lots of people prefer to keep original voices in background . 
  some even insist on single voice translation . 
   how concerned russia seems to be over fascism in ukraine since russia backed crimea and donbass , not that much . 
  we do n't need you screwed that much with fear and hate . 
  and ukrainians are fully capable to shit on themselves . 
   ukraine turned into that after you annexed their territory how much time do you need to turn into a fashist ? 
  those above are facts , not my * faulty logic * . 
  have a look at what ukraine turned since then : http://cs-msk-fd-4.ykt2.ru/media/upload/photo/2016/01/24/normal/111115430_ashampoo_snap_20140315_22h19m16s_006_.jpeg http://cs-msk-fd-4.ykt2.ru/media/upload/photo/2016/01/24/normal/urj8j.jpeg http://cs-msk-fd-4.ykt2.ru/media/upload/photo/2016/01/24/normal/flag1.jpeg http://cs-msk-fd-4.ykt2.ru/media/upload/photo/2016/01/24/normal/640475f36eebba88a55753e3d9a1a122_i-19.jpeg http://www.politnavigator.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/12162122_1472339123074085_1486676960_o.jpg, 
  here are analysis , worth to watch ( eng subs ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxhqpbtbd_4, 
  if only they asked you . 
  let 's ask adolf to make his point complete . 
   you read my whole comment seriously , adolf ? 
  to say on what ? 
  you do n't expect me to read your mein kampf speeches ? 
   let 's hope you 're not serious . 
  let 's better hope we wo n't meet on a battlefield . 
   but history shows that russia does n't change not history but nazys like you . 
   most russians do not want anything else but an authoritarian government unfortunately , these days dictatorship is the only way to keep independence . 
  let 's start multipolar world first and then we can talk about freedom and democracy . 
  any regime wants to remain in power . 
  and russians can travel over the world and see everything with their own eyes . 
  you 've been cheated . 
  between the two someone is always better . 
  even if putin wants trump he is not stupid to vote for him , cause clinton would use his vote against trump . 
  just like you did it above . 
   putin makes no secret of the fact that he really wants trump to be president , for obvious reasons . 
  that 's a lie . 
  in fact , putin has made it clear russua ca n't just blindly trust what either trump or clinton say . 
  that 's why snowden just wasting his time in russia . 
   a war . 
  nuclear or not nuclear , it does n't really matter . 
  it does matter . 
  billions of lives are needed for business . 
  millions ... not that much . 
  not nuclear war and without direct us military actions ( both bad for business ) . 
  i remember on one popular russian youtube channel most asked question was ` how come russians have so expensive cars ? 
  i understand why you ( and other loosers like you ) so mad about russia . 
  russians can outperform you in anything , you know that and ca n't stand . 
  we won your napoleon in 1812 , we won hitler who fucked you easily , we do n't let us fuck us as they fuck you , we were first in space there you never will be and so on . 
  the only chance for loosers like you to pretend you 're mean something is to keep russia low . 
  but do n't lie yourself , this time it wo n't work once again . 
  my advice , if you feel sad just go eat some frog and suck arab cock as you used to do . 
  definitely we do n't want a clown driven by us ( speaking of monkeys and stick ) . 
  and sanctions work very well in developing our own industry , thanks . 
  poles spent in russia like 1,4-2 times more . 
  but i did n't use abovementioned as a reference , those are too cheap . 
  i do n't know why you keep repeating the same stupid advice . 
  if you have n't noticed yet , russia does n't share your new `` values '' and moving in totally different direction . 
  we literally wo n't be in same `` century '' for a while , if ever . 
  and please stop telling other people how to reddit . 
  in your `` century '' you 're supposed to be * tolerant * . 
  dunno , never considered those as a reference . 
  let 's see when eu stop feeding them . 
   the fact most people earn more than twice as much as people do in russia somehow escapes their minds lol , how about the fact life in russia 5-10 times cheaper ? 
  everyone knows in whose shit you 're living now . 
  you deserve it , enjoy . 
   they probably all still blame the us for the ukrainian war . 
  not all of them yet . 
  sorry , but i lost interest to discussion . 
  in my opinion your logic is full of double standarts and i ca n't see how i can help it . 
  at least try to understand why it does n't work . 
   i 'm just going to address the first point of nato enlargement which i understand is the first perceived betrayal by the west towards russia but we can get to the others if you still care to carry on the discussion . 
  i absolutely have no interest to drown into rhetoric , but why not clarify main points . 
   you think that nato has been unfair to russia , that the eastward expansion is perceived as a threat in russia and that russia had to act to defend itself . 
  right ? 
  right . 
   but does n't the will of the people in those countries count in the russian grand scheme of things ? 
  sure it does . 
  and that 's how we come to the will of people of crimea and donbass . 
   over 100 million worth of voices that said they want to be part of nato for their security and yet the comfort of russians should somehow take precedence ? 
  why ? 
  why not ? 
  no one ask those voices when it comes to push the button . 
  or there were a referendums in the usa before vietnam , iraq etc ? 
   but nato was voted in in each and every case . 
  it was invited in . 
  i fail to see how this has anything to do with russia 's security . 
  if some strangers allow robbers to stick around your home , you wo n't be fine with it . 
   did nato promise not to enlarge ? 
  thanks , but like i said i 'm not interested to drown into something like that . 
  i fully understand such a rhetoric along with huge portion of propaganda are absolutely necessary in the countries based on western democracy model .
