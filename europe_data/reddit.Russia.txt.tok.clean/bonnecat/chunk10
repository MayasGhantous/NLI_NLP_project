  because someone wanted to only steal from russia , meanwhile developing manufactoring in china . 
  that 's why . 
  sure . 
  i wish you were in his shoes . 
  alright , i think we will see it soon . 
  turks , recognition of armenian genocide , more immigrants , terrorist attacks , new mein kampf edition ... no , you gon na be alright . 
   when the time came for yanukovych to face the music lol , what music ? 
  they tried to kill him , no president = no problem . 
  putin sent helicopters to evacuate him alive . 
   people wanted closer ties to eu hope they enjoy it now . 
   it is based on the theory that the power comes from people and the will of people is above all else , even the constitution , as the constitution is merely a written will of the people . 
  nope . 
  look at the people of crimea and donbass . 
  their will means nothing . 
  i guess he lost a rest of his trust in the west since they started to openly support the coup . 
  this is kind of dark humor , just like ignorant people call russians a ` commies ' . 
  some say but noone means that . 
  i 'd say according to nowadays history germans were fooled with foreign agent hitler the same way as russians were fooled with foreign agent lenin . 
  west started russophobia long before putin https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_will_of_peter_the_great, 
   alternate timeline without putin ? 
  russia - china war ( how else they gon na destroy rising china ? ), 
  russia - europe war ( could be migrants - locals conflicts with decent amount of deaths and destructions though ) 3 . 
  dividing russia to multiple states ( to not ever bother with mighty russia anymore ) 4 . 
  oil/gaz/iron / woods/human traffic    west . 
  do n't bother , you will be too late anyway . 
  please go back to what you 're supposed to do - mein kampf reading . 
  you forgot that syria was better off before russia came there , too . 
  and much much better before west funded terrorists came there . 
  anglo-saxons have been meddling in the me for ages . 
  they certainly carry blame for the current situation as well . 
  edit : russia left afganistan in 1989 . 
  and how does afganistan do since then under us rule ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_in_afghanistan_ ( 2015 % e2 % 80 % 93present ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/illegal_drug_trade  by 2007 , 93 % of the opiates on the world market originated in afghanistan regarding ukraine : you would have hard time to find it on the map [ without territories that russia joined to them ] ( http://geo-politica.info/upload/editor/news/2017.01/5873432949265_1483948841.jpeg ) . 
  there is a difference to be a fools and fooled as many others . 
  take your pick . 
  sorry you feel like that , i 'm just worring about you and i think i 've made it clear why . 
  thanks . 
  i have same winter as you do , i live very close . 
  except i do n't have to deal with immigrants , terrorist attacks and mein kampf . 
  do n't ask me . 
  ask nuland and mccain . 
  unless you 're from eu , because , you know , [ fuck the eu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl_gshygv3o ) . 
  you 're right , i would understand english as good as you do if i had us as my master . 
  if only another job could change your future . 
  except it was n't putin who started all that mess in ukraine and middle east . 
  that 's right . 
  germans supposed to read new mein kampf edition now . 
  do n't let russians to mess up . 
  or maybe some should stop playing dumb . 
   not to use its territory to harm the security of ** each other ** . 
  imagine where the world would be without corruption and oligarchs . 
  putin got country much worse than it 's now . 
   fighting with crimean tatar fascism ( or they are isis radicals ? ), 
  all the `` fighting '' i see is tatars attacking special forces screaming `` allah will complete his mission !!! '' . 
  so i think it 's obvious who 's radical there . 
   watching all this i feel great shame fo my contry believe or not , but i feel the same for your country . 
  and let 's not forget that you not only failed to deliver something ( like pensions to old people in donbass ) , but also blocked energy/water supply to crimeans ( incuding your beloved tatars ) . 
   it left all these people one on one with the most sadistic , brutal , dehumanised regime in europe . 
  i 'll take this as the answer why those people in crimea were smiling . 
  lets look it 's true or not : [ do crimeans want back to ukraine ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ga4ti_uppg ) ukrainian tv ( totally not pro-russian ) have visited crimea and asked people if they are fine to be a part of russia or maybe want to join ukraine . 
  if some do n't understand russian/ukrainian they can just pay attention to people 's emotions , plus here is a hint : those who prefer ukraine have their faces blurred . 
  here is one more : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylduvm0vyps why are all those people smiling ? 
  too scared to get in jail ? 
  lol, 
  but for some reason they would keep his agreements . 
  nope . 
  the plan was a bit different [ how russia ruined american plans in crimea ] ( http://en.reseauinternational.net/how-russia-ruined-american-plans-in-crimea/ ), 
   answer3 : 1 . 
  they can always extend the lease . 
  yeah , sure [ how russia ruined american plans in crimea ] ( http://en.reseauinternational.net/how-russia-ruined-american-plans-in-crimea/ ), 
  i like his honesty . 
  he knows people of crimea and donbass will not forgive them ever , so he wants just the * territories * . 
  poland has a border with russia . 
  here in kaliningrad i had to work with lots of poles ( we were speaking ~ 50/50 english/russian and ~ 10 % polish ) and only with 1 czech and 1 hungarian ( that guy was fluent in hungarian , german , english and did n't know a word in russian ) . 
  yeah , sure , accuse russia and [ meanwhile ] ( https://youtu.be/u49_tncscne?t=59s ), 
   remember back in 2010 , assange publicly announced he had a massive bombshell about putin , medvedev , and russian oligarchs ? 
  all i see is csmonitor statement . 
  how do we know assange realy said that ? 
  not to mention / u/it _ could_happen_here lied . 
  there is nothing about putin , medvedev , and russian oligarchs in the linked article . 
   then he met with russian officials , dropped the story , and refused to mention it again again , empty statement , from / u/it _ could_happen_here this time , without any proof . 
  [ which is not ? 
  ] ( http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/i_m_ho/25019411/3823246/3823246_original.jpg ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimea 2014 : russians - 1,492,078 ** 67.9 % ** ukrainians - 344,515 ** 15.7 % ** crimean tatars - 232,340 ** 10.6 % **, 
  with such a support you should do very well . 
  prisoners do n't trust cops . 
  she can just say it was a set up . 
  r/syriancivilwar/comments / 5e50w0/one _ of_the_most_bizarre_videos_from_syria /, 
   putin instigated himself putin started maidan and attack on assad ? 
   since he is your dear leader how is he improving russian lives in one of the richest by resources country in the world ? 
  did you even read the arcticle ? 
   gross domestic product ( gdp ) per person has grown 70 percent under putin , compared with 17 percent in the european union . 
   russians were shocked by the rampant joblessness under yeltsin , then relieved by the return to prosperity and jobs under putin . 
  suicide rates also constantly decreased , but they somehow missed that in the article .

  and soros and mcfaul did their job . 
  as a russian , i think it started right after wwii , just never reached a military phase . 
  you think us fighting with assad in syria ? 
  us fighting with russia there because from their pov syria is russia 's .
