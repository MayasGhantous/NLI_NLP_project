  here is what random eu sitezen thinks about us invasions :  if memory serves it was america that invaded all those countries and other nato countries basically tagged along . 
  i kinda know that because i was there during the invasions in the past 15 years . 
  i personally would prefer america gives nato the finger . 
  it also means we can kick the american presence in europe out and we can give trump the finger when he sees the bill when he is forced to invade a country . 
  i speak english and totally fine with never visiting us nor uk . 
  `` dude '' had no appreciation for the russian culture . 
  he was just another soros and got his ass banned finally . 
  http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/27751/49/  is europe under us occupation ? 
  and do n't forget about moon . 
  * living standard if `` produce and consume '' is modern religion , then true . 
  i asked a guy once that he probably finds his job boring . 
  not at all , he said , i just think of god all the time and happy with that . 
  american msm is the last source you can trust when it comes to russia . 
  dude , you 're hardly a credible source . 
  just like your beloved bbc : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bbc_controversies, 
  ukraine itself does `` finance a criminal regime '' . 
  most money they pay for the `` eu 's gas '' go to that particular regime . 
  not only turkey but also usa . 
  they invaded syria . 
  the us should sanction themselves . 
  if they buy from eu , it 's eu 's gas . 
  anyway , most money still go to russia . 
  dude , trump loves usa . 
  he sold overpriced gas/carbon to several puppet eu states already and only `` against '' sanctions because congress will pass them anyway , so he is safe to say now : see , it was n't me . 
  only for ~ ~ idio ~ ~ americans . 
  as expected ? 
  american supervisors , $ 206 carbon , 1st place in corruption ... if that was your plan i salute you . 
  unless you 're gay [ gay prank in georgia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjferzhpxtg&amp;index=2205&amp;list=ll4efyzyt3qpvitvvn1ehtgw ), 
  bogumil rainov is my favorite bulgarian book writer . 
  rip . 
  15-20 years ago i had a chat with an brazilian and mentioned brazilian carnival . 
  he said he hates it because `` there are only drugs and bitches '' . 
  perhaps they already knew ? 
  they did check your asshole in the past , ca n't say for now . 
  there could be different checks for officers and privates as well . 
  you can move as well , since you have nothing else to do . 
  no idea on how a lady gon na prove she 's a gay to a doctor though . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kuban  is a geographic region of southern russia surrounding the kuban river , on the black sea between the don steppe , the volga delta and the caucasus , and separated from the crimean peninsula to the west by the kerch strait . 
  krasnodar krai is often referred to as `` kuban '' , both officially and unofficially , although the term is not exclusive to the krai and accommodates the republics of adygea , karachay -- cherkessia , and parts of stavropol krai . 
  if true , what 's gon na happen after his retirement ? 
  i state facts , i do n't care how it looks to you or someone else . 
  yeah , if only they did n't forget gdp in process . 
  easily . 
  so in 41 it should be 168 +6 ( 7 ) = 174 ( 175 ) . 
  explain this : https://www.google.com/search?q=america+financed+nazi+germany, 
  you forgot [ stalin initiated the creation of your state ] ( http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-4737624,00.html ) this is how stalin killed his own people : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_soviet_union#population_2 1920 : 137,727,000 1926 : 148,656,000 1937 : 162,500,000 1939 : 168,524,000 1941 : 196,716,000 1946 : 170,548,000 ( -26 m , thanks to hitler and [ who financed nazi germany ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=who+financed+nazi+germany ) ) 1951 : 182,321,000, 
  easily . 
  came to the russian govt from american jews bank . 
  was fired by putin but magicaly returned back . 
  was `` sanctioned '' but magicaly allowed to visit munich conference . 
  made two ( ? ), 
  unsuccessful attempts to remove putin . 
  just recently russian central bank spent 55b on us federal reserve paper . 
  go tell fr about your great plan . 
  but i was told many russian teenagers support navalny ? 
  cause they are * less brainwashed * ... 
  pretty much now . 
  if you understand russian try to listen to this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8xar_hjbhc and if you ca n't get what he is talking about , it 's okay . 
   and all people who watch tv hate ukrainians . 
  my dad even says he would gladly go kill them on donbas . 
  he would kill people of donbass ? 
  interesting . 
  many sources claim the author is a communist .

  4m ukrainians work in russia . 
  what would happen if 4m russians arrived in ukraine ? 
  words like hohol or ukrnazi are n't related to any random ukrainian . 
  hell , all my friends in soviet army were ukrainians . 
  but for whatever reason all of them were from kyiv only . . 
  seems like that .

  nope , they would n't . 
  they would build a military/naval base in novorossiysk . 
  dumbest thing i 've ever read . 
  russia would n't let to steal crimea from them ever , it has too much of strategic value . 
  never go full retard . 
  navalny was arrested for breaking the law , not for protesting . 
  rights to protest is in the russian constitution , which was written by americans in 90s btw . 
   whether that is his failure to diversify our economy from energy another person from the uk told me putin has fired the economy minister for refusing to diversify russia economy . 
  tell me what have you learned from the brits about [ russia football hooligans ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-38986206/the-secret-world-of-russia-football-hooligans ) ? 
  brits caused most damage to russia . 
  look who 's [ in the middle of the russian 1917 revolutionists crowd ] ( http://image1.thematicnews.com/uploads/images/00/00/41/2013/12/18/6d3c0eb904.jpg ) [ reminds something , yeah ? 
  ] ( http://image.glavred.info/images/608xx/dec2016/424774.jpg ), 
  except they see it different way than you do . 
  way more . 
  do not confuse putin with the govt . 
  you forgot most corrupt ... oh wait , your country is leader here . 
   he 's the best you guys have to offer great idea . 
  take him . 
  unless you want to stay \u2116 1 in corruption . 
   there is no such word as \u0437\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f in ukrainian let 's check this out . 
  googling * \u0437\u043b\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f * ... gotcha http://www.slovnyk.ua/index.php?swrd=%c7%cb%c0%cc%c0%cd%cd%df, 
  serbia is \u2116 14 . 
  and if the poll was conducted among russian redditors serbia would be \u2116 1 . 
  i said nobody tried and not some tried but got censored . 
  the point is how you discuss things and not what you discuss . 
  mods had enough of anti-russia bias there . 
  ghaleon was shadow banned in r/europe for some time . 
  i guess mods decided to unban him for a balance .
