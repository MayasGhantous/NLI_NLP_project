  too much anti-russia shills in this sub , but i do n't need to tell you about . 
  i 'm not really aware of what exactly happend with transnistria . 
  some anti-russia propaganda might have place in moldova since their govt is pro-eu , but in same time moldova president is clearly pro-russia and that is what matters , i mean people of moldova voted for this . 
  from my personal experience i can tell i had to deal with ukrainians and moldovans in same time in 80s . 
  ukrainians were not much friendly and moldovans were quite neutral towards russians . 
  your view is irrelevant . 
  what you do is what matters , otherwise how do russians know about it ? 
  and nobody even tried when r/russia hosted nordic countries for a cultural exchange .

  that 1 % seem just read reddit . 
  [ putin in north korea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fli-jk86fhi ), 
  3 % `` friend '' ( 21th ) , < 1 % `` not a friend '' . 
  moldova is in the list http://www.levada.ru/2017/06/05/druzya-i-vragi-rossii-2/, 
  source ? 
  [ not this one apparently ] ( https://focus.ua/files/medvedeva/2016/12/23-31/mccain.jpg ), 
  nah , he lied , it was n't putin . 
   poland is puppet state of eu nope . 
  poland is always a smart ass . 
  poland is pretty much in bed with a master - us . 
  you only take eu money and show them middle finger in responce . 
  are you living there or just pulled this out of your ass ? 
  well , now ukrainians hate ukrainians . 
  great achievement of collaborating with us . 
  russia 's interests in baltic region are already covered by military base and sea port in kaliningrad . 
  whoring for us/nato will only cost you a bunch of a money and put you in potential risk of wiping out of earth once and forever . 
  mccain 's ambitions happend in georgia . 
   police whatever shooting unarmed civilians https://youtu.be/ptik5jpgl54?t=2m34s, 
  there is a lot of `` opposition '' media , a whole bunch of anti-russian trolls in all media , there are persons like navalny after all . 
  the price of annexation of something like gotland would be too huge to justify all the consequences . 
  and lets not forget nato is already in baltic states , gotland wo n't change much here . 
  and the nato/us would have no choise but to declare war against russia , otherwise china is free to annex taiwan as well . 
   if they annex gotland - what can sweden do ? 
  there is already a russian naval base in kaliningrad . 
  gotland has nothing in common with crimea . 
  there is no infrastucture , there is no local support . 
  not to mention russian people would n't support such annexation either . 
  if you bothered to check your links out , you 'd find a link to newspaper . 
  a decent fate for berezovsky would be a execution in the centre of moscow without a single protest of the russian people . 
  instead , he was warm welcomed in uk till became full bankrupt and `` commited a suicide '' after that . 
  i honestly do n't know why thieves love uk that much . 
  they show a different newspaper in the end of the video . 
  define `` good work '' . 
  if you want russians to get back to russia , good work would be stopping attacks on russia and preventing foreign forces from collaboration with corruptionists inside russia . 
  then russia could finally switch focus on internal issues , rebuild itself and make it attractive to the russians outside of russia to get back to home . 
  and before you started , let me remind you that putin rating was n't that high before 2014 , even despite much higher incomes . 
   refuse to go back to russia though according to russia ministry of foreign affairs a total of 146,585 russian citizens returned to russia in 2016 . 
  of these , around 30,000 came from eu countries . 
  the foreign ministry confirmed that more compatriots are returning as part of a government program to assist voluntary repatriation . 
   tries to portray the revolution in ukraine as a terrible even that has partially destroyed the country thankfully the civilized world portrays it as a great achievement . 
  r/belarus/comments / 5vbmtc/would _ you_join_eu /, 
  the point ? 
  still false accusations/statements . 
  post it in r/ukraina instead , they will be happy regardless of the source . 
  see ? 
  if there was nyt you likely would n't even notice it . 
  let alone its ` credibility ' . 
  go to r/russia and find them out ? 
  there is nothing to discuss there . 
  you ca n't `` bring democracy and freedom '' in places like chechnya . 
  you can only bring a peace there and let them evolve . 
  the reason is that nyt is not a trustworthy source there . 
  and such a source as nyt would n't help it anyway . 
  yep . 
  they just want freedom and democracy in russia . 
  and russia 's natural resources . 
  the nemtsov 's death place became a monument in the centre of moscow , similar to many other suspicious deaths . 
  only idiots believe that was intentional by kremlin . 
  r/russia/search ? q = visa & sort = new & restrict_sr = on you can have a job but not a money , or you can have a money and no job ... 
  i think they consider each particular case in complex . 
  not hard at all . 
  germans want to make sure you 're not some cheap shit - have a job , money , home etc. 
  show them proofs and you 're welcome . 
  how can you afford internet , india ? 
  i visited several families in germany last summer . 
  all of them spend a lot of their income on apartment rent , from 750eur and more . 
  i own a 2-room apartments and pay less than 100eur mo in russia . 
  you mean soros , lol, 
  you participate in fear/warmongering and russophobia . 
  shut up and we 'll be good . 
  but we both know your govt has no own will there . 
  regular people could say fuck that bullshit , i 'm not participating in that , but all i can say from my reddit experience is that most of baltic users are either dumb or shills . 
  you do n't threaten us with a war , lol . 
  us does , you made your bet in the game and scared to death of fail . 
  it 's not like you were given a choice but still . 
  let 's not fool anyone here , you personally could act as an unbiased objective person ( as you want it from russians ) , but you chose attack so do n't complain . 
  you 're from baltic and full of hate and fear to be `` invided '' by russia once again ( lets not forget though you were just sold by sweden ) . 
  that 's why you want russia to be devided/destroyed just to feel safe and that 's why part of you that wants freedom hates your govt that has no other option but to be a us/eu lapdog . 
  that all does n't make you good to russians who want sovereignty and safety for russia instead of * nihilists * . 
  we have a lot of western friends in r/russia . 
  and person you replied to is one of them . 
  be it us , ukraine or baltic - if you 're good to russians , they are good to you . 
  dunno what you 're trying to achieve with your multiple troll accounts and screwed logic in r/russia . 
  getting sexualy aroused every time mods ban your ass there ? 
  i do n't think the syrian network for human rights is any credible on reddit anymore : r/syriancivilwar/comments / 3v6blv/the _ snhr_and_its_methodology / not to mention that gas attack in 2013 was developed by terrorists and turkey , not by assad . 
  it 's a known fact actually ( in deutsch : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk6dfswvmlu ) and that 's why obama decided do not `` cross red line '' as he promised . 
  exactly . 
  isis is no better than al-nusra and alike , even bigger cancer for syria . 
  the only question is who does more harm at the moment . 
  i think assad and russia focus on those who do more harm . 
  i do n't see how isis `` better '' for assad and russia than al-nusra and alike .
