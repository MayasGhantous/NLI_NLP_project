  what 's the point for assad and russia to keep isis in syria ? 
  implying western source is n't lying about russia this time , 265k of 143m is 1,8 % ... dat some real data right here . 
  not surprised i personally do n't know anyone who wants to go us . 
  not to mention big part of those 265k are most likely immigrants . 
  edit : and gays of course . 
  us could make a big favor to russia by accepting all those . 
  us media portray russians as evil all the time and russians want to live there ? 
  you 're mad . 
  yeah , every ukraine critic is a kremlin propaganda . 
  it was in the contract you ca n't use those turbines in crimea . 
  but you did and it 's a thing in media now . 
  russia : oh , fuck off , we did exactly what you do to keep selling your sanctioned food in russia : we modified them . 
  eu : oh well , may we end up with some symbolic gesture to calm down our * partners * ? 
  russia : chicken . . 
  yes if she can prove it with document . 
  you may find it quite cheap after russian ruble drop in 2014 . 
  typical ~ 50m2 2-room apartment is about $ 35k here in kaliningrad . 
  i have one with my pretty average income and can afford to buy another one if needed with my assets . 
  house prices are vary a lot . 
  i consider a house , but only after retirement due to road traffic issues . 
  yeah ... 
  i 'm sure people of crimea , afghanistan and iraq would agree with you . 
  no worthwhile natural resources ? 
  how about [ cia 's drug smuggling operations ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=blowing+the+lid+off+the+cia%e2%80%99s+drug+smuggling+operations+in+afghanistan&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8 ) ? 
  everything is explained perfectly in this oliver stone movie : [ ukraine on fire ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5724358/ ) another great explanation from [ willy wimmer ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/willy_wimmer ) in deutsch : [ kenfm am set : milit\u00e4rhafen sewastopol ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdflesbb9bu ), 
  trump does n't need to . 
  the congress did all the dirty job and trump is like : see , it was n't me . 
  polish officers on the russia - poland border control were not much friendly and spoke polish even to the russians for whatever reason . 
  guess my terrible polish did n't make them more happier , lol that 's it !, 
  pretty girls in polish fastfood served me nicely and i 've been 100 % welcomed in deutschland . 
  a few years ago . 
  i was surprised as well , guess he was from rural area . 
  a pole told me once how much he is surprised to see so many girls on streets in russia . 
  polish girls used to sit at home , he said . 
  vladimir putin . 
  any random non-russian redditor can tell you things about putin that average russian has no idea about . 
   germany has done nothing for the united states wut germany made the us very rich , even more - germany made you a world dominator . 
  all investments in nazi germany in 30s turned back to us with a rain of gold . 
  [ us gdp after ww2 ] ( http://www.futuresmag.com/sites/default/files/resourceinvestor/article/2012/12/12/12-12-12-sp-1-commentary.png ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/post%e2%80%93world_war_ii_economic_expansion#united_states  the period from the end of world war ii to the early 1970s was a golden era of american capitalism, 
  no , in russia we prefer to keep strangers away from our children as well . 
  sometimes i ca n't resist and smile or say smth funny to a random kid ... and immediately feel guilty for that . 
  i would advice to either educate yourself or stop fooling other people . 
  k\u00f6nigsberg was the centre of german imperialism , after your defeat in ww2 international committee decided to take k\u00f6nigsberg from germany ** forever ** . 
  not to mention that nothing `` close to you '' left here ( fyi i live in kaliningrad ) . 
  and what 's the nonsence with an `` independent country 's sovereignty '' ? 
  they follow the orders from the us , just like you do . 
  or you gon na tell me that us bases , millions of arabs and holocaust memorial in the heart of germany is your people will ? 
  seriously , stop fooling yourself and other people . 
  yeah , good luck with that . 
  it 's a whataboutism . 
  if us did n't provoke such a conflicts in order to move ~ ~ us missiles ~ ~ nato closer to the russia borders , russia would n't need to `` invide '' anything . 
  because it 's a `` meddling in internal affairs '' ? 
  or because it may lead to a military conflict with thousands deaths . 
  or because it may escalate existing military conflict . 
  john mccain comes first to mind with his revenge for vietnam . 
  also hillary clinton ( no comment needed ) . 
  also the us officials who participated in the so called ukrainian revolution and ukraine - russia conflict in 2014 and later : nuland , joe baden , barack obama . 
  also more or less ashton baldwin carter , michael anthony mcfaul , samantha power , jen psaki . 
  also us officails who do their best in blaming russia , imposing sanctions etc and appear with all that in the russian media from time to time . 
  russians do n't hate the americans , only certain persons known for anti-russian sentiments . 
  of course , people tend to generalize things , but it 's still more about the us govt than about the nation . 
  in fact , regular americans is our only hope to improve our relations cause obviously we ca n't expect anything good from the us govt in this regard . 
  i adopted a stray cat instead . 
   pro-russia putin supporters who will actually hate me as a person just because i do n't support the same policies they do . 
  i often hear i 'm a fascist from the ukrainians once they realize i 'm pro-russia . 
  it 's pointless to bitch about it . 
   do you really think putin is protecting russian speakers out of the good of his heart ? 
  where is he * protecting russian speakers * ? 
  in mainland ukraine ? 
  in the baltic states ? 
  nonsence . 
  not to mention some russian speakers are actually russia haters , they just ca n't speak anything but russian , lol . 
  both people and geopolitics matter . 
  people = your rating , if you do n't believe in `` goodness of heart '' . 
  nazis = radical . 
  and they do rule in ukraine , blockade of donbass is clear example . 
  us do n't want `` ukraine closer to nato '' . 
  why would they ? 
  even germany owe billions to us and ukraine is absolutely hopeless in this regard . 
  but if you meant that us want nato closer to russia , that 's true . 
  so you think russia should let them do that ? 
  a year ago i visited my relatives in germany for de-ru wedding and they all spoke german . 
  especially young ones who moved 12 yo , their german was even better ( faster ) than russian . 
  why is it so different in germany ? 
  i do n't know , maybe german is easier to learn than estonian , or maybe germans treat russians as human beings . 
  hard to say , i have never been to estonia and i never will . 
  you said it yourself - putin * supporters * . 
  putin supporters are n't necessarily like putin as a person ( i never really did ) , but they surely support most of his policies . 
  especially since 2014 when west gave putin a great opportunity to show his best and become a true legend . 
  the problem is not who you like , the problem is when you 're dumb you 're easy target for a populists like navalny whose only goal is to organize another maidan . 
  btw , ukraine have their own navalny - muraev . 
  promote and elect him , we can deal with him . 
  but ukrainians ca n't elect any reasonable person anymore , all power belongs to oligarchs and nazis . 
  and friends from us wo n't be happy about that , too . 
  i prefer expert to politician . 
  a politician has to be an expert at some field to attract my attention and trust . 
   basically , it can be summed up in 1 words : no matter what happens , putin wins anyways may i suggest you do not waste your time anymore ? 
  cause it looks like you at navalny fans level which is pretty low . 
  absolutely . 
  lots of russians died even for other countries .
