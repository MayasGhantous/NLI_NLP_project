  but in the same time i feel like it somehow connected with those crisises that we have in europe and middle east these days . 
  i guess , that 's how russia is different from west , such a things do n't really work here . 
  you can fool people with one or another theories , but you wo n't achieve good results . 
  ukraine and west should just follow the laws and agreements with russia . 
  and one of those agreements was no further nato expansion toward russia 's borders btw . 
  now nato in poland , coming to finland and would be in donbass and crimea if putin did n't fool them . 
  that 's why west has developed the coup . 
  putin speaks about that development worldwide now , so i guess he has enough to confirm it . 
  here is subbed video of putin 's speech that might explain something to you in this regard : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvrhzuayzgm russian anti-western propaganda is a part of defence from western aggression . 
  no aggression , no need to waste money on defence . 
  west needs to differentiate what is good for people and what is good for economic elites . 
  after that people may want to elect new leaders who care more about people instead of elites . 
  crimea is russian now , they applied for russian citizenship 2 times and putin made them . 
  crimea is very important to russia and can not be trusted to anyone anymore . 
  for the same reason donbass must be neutral zone . 
  russia can make economical agreement with ukraine on this regard , but that 's it . 
  the best west can do is support to that agreement . 
  but i do n't see them much interested . 
  europe is too dependent on usa , that 's the problem . 
  hillary represents the globalists group , if she takes the office things will be even worse . 
  west should n't support maidan in first place , then crimea and donbass just would n't happen . 
  what west doing is constantly shootin itself in the foot . 
  such as isis creating , such as coup in ukraine , such as refugee crisis . 
  how can russia help them to stop ? 
  i do n't know . 
  perhaps , some crisis is necessary to help western people to realize they need another leaders . 
  russians might think of it as well , but only when this mess is over . 
   as long as there is little to no free information in russia not true . 
  there is always internet , russians travel over the world , share their opinions and bitching about goverment all the time . 
  except now it 's different than few years ago . 
  previous time pro-government party united russia won the election there were massive protests , this time ... nothing . 
  why ? 
  western aggression made russians united with their defender . 
  any opposition automatically considered as pro-western agents and enemies . 
  just like they make trump a putin 's agent in the usa . 
   i wish russians would get some open minded leaders so we can prosper together , but putin does n't seem to be it agreed , but see what the problem is : west made putin a ` great defender of russians from western aggression ' and putin has no competitors in * that * role . 
  west should switch focus from cold war to peace and evolution and then putin will be not much successful and obsolete . 
  but here comes another problem : west has no patience . 
  they could n't just let russians to evolute from ... hmmm , their past ; they tried to poison their minds via thousands ngos and when putin kicked those out from russia , started a coup on ukraine . 
  so , as you can see , it is always a war , more or less visible . 
  but at least in the latter people can pretend and play that ` freedom and democracy ' game . 
  deal with it . 
  i guess as a russian i ca n't be trustworthy here , so lets leave it to your countryman to explain . 
   ukrainian students showed upa flags which was met with outrage by poles but at the moment it 's fine , they were deported cool , but are you aware that poland sponsors ukrainian schools in poland where ukrainian kids learn the same upa thing ? 
   i , unlike you , ... where you are more equal than others . 
  i think this says it all . 
  it 's just funny ( and boring in same time ) to watch your endless hysterics about ` russian invasion ' . 
  thanks but no , i seem lost any hope to visit baltics ever . 
  i can visit baltic sea any day , that 's enough for me . 
  peace and quiet . 
   so it 's not about defense only defense . 
   reason there is no war in the baltics , is because . . . . russia gives no damn about you . 
   nato heavy weapons and soldiers are here . . to get more attention ( and money !! ), 
  from eu . 
  they want their gold back from us in the first place . 
  most complicated devices probably those tens of millions of unexploded us bombs in laos . 
  that 's not true . 
  it all started after his words : * stalin won ww2 * ( i guess it supposed to be ukraine who won ww2 from their pov ) : https://youtu.be/fidswlikrlc?t=6m40s, 
  i think it was intentional . 
  it 's just us army does n't agree with us politicians who turned their all life enemies into allies . 
  soldiers are n't politicians , they ca n't change their minds that easily . 
  and even for us politicians it was a tough choice to work with russia and syria , but putin left them no options . 
   and you advocating for the us to bomb countries and here is why he 's doing it :  the `` yanks '' already decided that my country was worth bombing , did it and now i 'm living in one of the most civilized , economically and socially secured country on earth, 
  worth to mention that kaliningrad city has no direct output to the baltic sea . 
  it has output to the lagoon , but the lagoon is part of the sea indeed . 
  the article is quite old . 
  it says :  of course we hope that the schedule will work , but we 're skeptical , '' said anna tufvesson , sida 's water policy specialist , who is handling the swedish contribution to the kaliningrad project . 
  `` the new arrangement carries large risks , and if there are further delays we 'll apply appropriate pressure to make sure a working ** wastewater treatment plant ** is installed . 
  if it fails , we will eventually ask for our money back . 
  simple google search leads us to : http://www.northerndimension.info/news/nd-newsflash/nd-newsflash-no-1-2016-march/461-kaliningrad-wastewater-treatment-plant-finally-in-operation  the long-awaited wastewater treatment plant in kaliningrad started operations on 18 december 2015 at about half of its capacity . 
  by ** april 2016 ** , the plant has reached almost full capacity processing biologically over 100,000 cubic meters of wastewater per day . 
  the construction of the plant 's sand-filter and uv disinfection units will be finalized during the nearest weeks , and the handling and disposal of wastewater sludge will be solved during the next few months . 
   the positive impact to a cleaner baltic sea will soon be noticed and to guarantee these results the international parties will carry on monitoring the wwtp performance in order to meet the set targets in full in close future . 
  '' , commented ** ndep adviser jaakko henttonen **  the construction works in kaliningrad were at a halt for a long time due to problems with the general contractor . 
  in may 2015 , kaliningrad authorities cancelled the contract with the original contractor and hired a local company sk chistograd to finish the works . 
  childish is when you 're asking for things that you 're not able to understand . 
   unless it changed in last few years , it does n't look at all it has been changed . 
  34000ha more in use since 2012 according to local media . 
  not that it always work as good as expected though . .  i 'm not even sure if it 's really a problem of soviet times . 
  agriculture in belarus somehow works quite well . 
  agreed . 
  it highly dependent on support from local govt . 
  i guess they saw no point in that in the times of high oil prices , high taxes and tough competition with foreign prices . 
  but things have changed , these times russia vitally interested in replacement of import with russian production as much as possible . 
  taxes are still high i suppose , but prices are high as well . . 
  i moved to kaliningrad 14 years ago and was surprised to see more foreign food than local . 
  i think it is because of higher taxes here in russia . 
  russian manufacturers just could n't compete and survive . 
  putin sanctioned foreign food and russian manufacturers can breathe now . 
  personally i quite satisfied with russian food , i used to buy it even before sanctions . 
  yes , local agriculture does n't look as good as polish ( i had a chance to compare visually when i traveled through poland to germany ) . 
  but it has to be done , it is nonsense do not have solid agriculture in russia . 
  there is a popular russian youtube channel `` stop a douchebag '' ( stop a bad driver ) , which is subbed version of general movement '' \u0421\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0425\u0430\u043c '' . 
  in sad they show only moscow and spb due to high amount of douchebags in * both * cities unfortunatelly . 
  there was same movement in kaliningrad , but it did n't last long cause bad drivers here are kids compared to mocsow and spb . 
  there were opinions to join europe , but those are minor . 
  most of russians want to stay russian no matter what and wo n't trade national pride for iphones ever . 
  russia is huge and mainland russians themselves are quite different . 
  but yes , people here are more gentle and polite in general , europe definitely leaves its mark . 
  that was one of a reasons why i moved here 14 years ago .
