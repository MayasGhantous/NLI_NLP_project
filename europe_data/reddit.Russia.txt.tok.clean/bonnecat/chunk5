   free trade is harmful and not wanted in russia ? 
  it is . 
  just like north stream 2 is considered harmful and not wanted in eu . 
   why western products are really popular in russia i do n't see them anymore in the supermarkets that i use to visit . 
  i just realized that 90 % of the food i use to buy is russian and 10 % - are fruits from china , east and asia . 
   products that despite being banned are still being smuggled in and bought please check the facts . 
  a year ago they started just destroy forbidden food by handreds of tons . 
  no one in their right mind would continue to lose their money . 
  western food was successfully replaced , mostly by russian . 
  and i can tell you i like russian food even more . 
  edit : you probably mean that westerns ** cheat ** trying to avoid ban ? 
  just have read they started to * modify * their `` perfect quality '' products . 
  yet another reason for me to stay away from those if i ever find them . 
  i heard your country netherlands may exit eu to lift anti-russian sanctions ? 
  you can tell them do not bother . 
  it really seems like russia does n't need you anymore . 
  have a good day . 
  not sure what they 're expecting now . 
  if i had a pork business in russia , i would n't mess with putin anyway . 
   the fact that you actually argue about it , like , `` i do n't understand anything about this i actually work as an engineer in power production industry and do everything : hardware , software - both low and high level . 
   analog switch , is a switch . 
  it 's either on , or off i see . 
  it 's actually called `` diskrete '' . 
   but that 's exactly your goal as a consumer i 'm a human in first place . 
   putin 's sanctions on all the normal russians i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  stores are full of goods from the countries that do n't support usa & co. 
   as opposed to going through lines of text on a monitor there are visial presentations on monitors these days . 
  you ( not you exactly but some engineer ) can draw a picture just like operator wants . 
  google for wincc pictures . 
  let alone descriptions . 
  but i never worked on nuclear power stations , maybe they have good reasond for the different design , i just do n't see why . 
  i did , i only buy necessary stuff now produced by russia and countries that do not support sanctions . 
  ahh right . 
  totally forgot . 
  they sanctioned our industry , military , banking etc and expected us to buy their goods . 
  thats why . 
  there are russian food , clothes , furniture , houses , consumer electronics etc. 
  but hard to fix or upgrade anything . 
  personally i have no idea on why such a design . 
  it 'd be a pain in the ass to work with something like that either for operator or engineers . 
  well there is a network , but it 's a solely technology network not connected to even office network of the power station . 
  i mean , on some random power plant . 
  comprehensive test means : under full load . 
  source : i work in power plant industry . 
  have you even tried to read that ? 
  it is russian ** responce ** to the foreign sanctions . 
  ( just in case ) foreign sanctions were first . 
  i used to buy foreign hi-end consumer electronics stuff and wanted to build a 3rd computer for home . 
  now those are 1,5-2 more at price , i stiil can buy them , but why would i do that ? 
  it 's time to hold on and think - do those toys make me happy ? 
  can consumption make me happy at all ? 
  long story short : i shifted the focus of my life to really important things like personal relations , health , traveling , education and communications with people . 
  i still have a lot of spare money and i invest them in building industry . 
  lol , putin is not that stupid . 
  west is . 
  they are those who are suffering the most . 
  usa does n't care , russia only benefits . 
  it 's really simple . 
  russians were tired of reforms and putin had to feed them first . 
  and the simpliest way to achieve that was oil and gas selling . 
  now oil price has dropped , but we can benefit even from that and i explained how . 
  and the most interesting part is that price drop ( and national currency drop ) in people minds was developed by usa . 
   then 99 % of population would have to starve to death we definitely do n't want that . 
  and here industrialisation comes to rescue . 
  but industrialisation is just a tool and production + consumption should never be our goal . 
  `` they '' - those who sanctioned you . 
  personally i do n't care about your money . 
  feel free to kiss their asses as much as you want . 
   who made the device you wrote this on ? 
  what about the operating system , web browser ? 
  geez . . who told you human race needs those to evolute at first place ? 
  you really need * that much * of industrialisation to make a family , raise kids and be happy ? 
  i can tell you that i 'm smoking . 
  should i be grateful for that too or i am a victim ? 
   calling for an end to sanctions sanctions is a godsend . 
  russian industry started to raise without competitors and wo n't be happy to meet those foreign hungry sharks at the moment . 
  bacause they made it pointless to spend much money on their useless foreign goods ? 
  recently i was in europe and barely spent 1/3 of my cache money . 
  expensive foreign goods got 1,5-2 pricey ? 
  keep them , i better spend my money on something russian now . 
  well , original poster recently got good portion of criticism in / r/russia and now i see why . 
  thanks , but the role of gazprom foreign partners in all of this stll is n't clear for me . 
   the overall numbers of troops in germany has dropped i see . 
  and that obviously had nothing to do with your chances to get german gold back . 
  usa just stepped back like they were told with no question . 
   it is pure idiocy to believe that usa would ever attack russia ... i mean what kind of stupid person regarding your last words - ever heard of proxy wars ? 
   we got rid of the american military that proves nothing . 
  perhaps americans did n't need that base or more likely some kind of trade happend as it use to be . 
   why ca n't gazprom understand oh , so now gazprom is on their own and all their european partners including germany just disappeared ? 
  i see . 
  goog luck with getting german gold back from the usa . 
  i would n't hold my breath though . 
  i do n't . 
  even more : i said sanctions and oil price drop is godsend for the russian economy . 
  but still those considered . 
  not to menton thousands of deaths . 
  is that true ? 
  the coup in ukraine , sanctions , oil price drop , nato expansion to the russian borders , that whining from poland and baltic states , russian athletes ban etc. 
  and no , i 'm not going to prove you anything . 
  apparently , obama would be happy to provide any information about anything , but i 'm just too lazy to ask him , sorry .
