  i 'm fully aware that better fares is modern religion . 
  and i 'm not defending russian economic model , there is not much to defend there , to begin with . 
  i just explained how sanctions and oil price drop are helping to the russian economy at the moment . 
  obviously , russian economy has no other choise but to pray the same `` better fares religion '' , otherwise russia just wo n't be safe . 
  no , i do n't really care about those . 
  i 'd appreciate if they stoped to live in their past and moved on though . 
   the us can dominate discussions but it is not always accepted and other countries would not want to feel they are following orders . 
  how much german gold did you get from ** usa ** already ? 
   countries that do not want bases for external forces have the right to refuse similar question to them . 
   no single company or group is allowed to own the methods of production , distribution or retail in the energy sector sure . 
  i just do n't understand : is it poland that smart or just other gazprom partners , including germany , that stupid ? 
  not sure what we are arguing about . 
  does west portrays russia as an world enemy ? 
  it does . 
  * having russia as an enemy is strangely comforting to americans * - bostonglobe , 2015 . 
  oh wait , west is not just usa ? 
  do you really have no idea on how other countries depend on usa ? 
  yes , ** including nato members ** ( regarding your other question ) . 
  that threat might be mitigated different ways . 
  by a friendly long term way as you described above . 
  or by a brute force when you create crisis and push on people in order to replace their president with your agent like it happened with ukraine . 
  option 1 looks nice , why not go there ? 
  yes , indeed , let 's go friendly way !, 
  that 's what putin is trying to accomplish right now . 
  just let 's not forget that world dominator is still there and let 's not be blind to what happens with `` made friendly '' eu . 
  what happend in ukraine is not that hard to understand for independent mind really . 
   some companies have taken a shorter term view but most want russia for the longer-term . 
  companies - yes . 
  usa pappets - no . 
   one of the key goals of nato is ... to be a toy in usa hands . 
  that 's why it 's so close to the russian borders and `` prepares '' . 
   russia faces the same restrictions as other countries no . 
  other countries are n't portrayed as threats . 
  i have no idea on how did you come to that conclusion . 
  personally i want to live in a world focused on evolution . 
   saying that sanctions help raise the internal industry , it 's just regurgitating the official propaganda no , those are solely my own considerations . 
  i do n't follow `` the official propaganda '' as much as you 're trying to portray it . 
   there 's a reason why russia import apples from poland once again , not true anymore . 
   russia would hardly just let it go not russia , but govt . 
  you asked how would ** i ** feel . 
  and you 're wrong . 
  chechnya is totally different now and their leader is ready to fight with isis for russia as he claimed recently in his twitter . 
  now i 'm sure you 're kidding . 
  fuck the nato , but if chechnya was n't in rf anymore i 'd only appreciate it . 
  oh , it is . 
  just like any other country russia needs peace around its borders to focus on internal issues . 
  is it really that hard to understand ? 
  are you serious ? 
  so far all russia `` invided '' was totally pro-russian territories . 
  if you refuse to take into account what and why russia `` invided '' then our conversation is pointless . 
   i do n't see how respect of rule of laws , human rights and dropping the expansionistic ambitions makes russia more effecient at `` fighting off '' nato wut ? 
   what happened at maidan is an internal ukraininan power struggle . 
  you 're wrong here and as long as you on this point we are n't going anywhere . 
  primary export sector is a problem for russia indeed , but only putin has any ideas on how to change it just because he is a president . 
  although , sanctions and oil price drop already help a lot to raise russian internal industry . 
  like i said , you have no idea on what 's going on . 
  i mean you have no idea on how russian economy works . 
  what is possible to do and what is not atm . 
  this all is a long term process to change people minds at first place and western agression does n't help it at all . 
  and let me remind you it was n't russia who started that mess in ukraine . 
  it started on maidan in kiev , not in crimea . 
  obviously you are n't an expert in russian economy . 
  also , i 'm not sure that club provided by corporations is that good for russia and human race in general . 
  though russia could have a deal with them so far anyway . 
  i see . 
  young folks love extreme indeed . 
  no problem whatsoever . 
  remove nato from russian borders , stop blocking any russian industrial project in europe and let russia do what you said . 
  i assume you 're russian and do n't mind to visit ukraine ? 
  my other colleague just laughed on such a suggestion . 
  and he is ethnical ukrainian btw . 
  you have no idea on what you 're talking about . 
  russians ca n't leave crimea nor donbass , next day there will be full scale genocide there . 
   i want sources not your words . 
  just one example : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/azov_battalion#human_rights_violations_and_war_crimes, 
  usa aggression , obviously . 
  true . 
  the best case scenario for the west is russia 's disintegration in order to make it weak forever and share russian natural resources between world dominators . 
  but first they have to replace putin with pro-western agent like they did in ukraine . 
  that 's why putin keeps any opposition down . 
   if you loudly proclamed your support of putin in the annexation of eastern ukraine i support putin in protecting russia . 
   until russia invaded there was no conflict that 's not true . 
  sorry , but you either lie or have no idea on what you 're talking about . 
  russians say : you ca n't become happy by making unhappy other people . 
  your next question please address to obama and putin . 
   i 'm pretty sure that if a russian went to ukraine , nobody would mind well , my colleague thinks otherwise . 
  he ca n't even talk with his ukrainian relatives normally by the phone anymore . 
  i also would n't put my life at risk going ukraina after maidan event . 
   russia having bad relations with almost all of its western neighbours , most of europe and north america . 
  i was in europe just 2 months ago and ca n't confirm this . 
  in germany all were pretty friendly , i made new friends there . 
  officers on poland border were not much friendly , but that probably because my polish is n't good enough for them . 
  never met any american in person , but as i can see on reddit there are reasonable people in usa as well . 
  i live in russia and i lived a few years in ukraine , so i think i know what i 'm talking about . 
  reasonable people can be friends . 
  but if most people were reasonable there were no wars at all . 
  the problem is that ukrainians in general are quite nationalistic and their nationalistic feelings were hurt deeply . 
  edit : ** let me explain ** : i see no problem that they are nationalistic . 
  the problem is that their nationalistic feelings were hurt deeply . 
  in the soviet times , when i served in the army , all my friends were ... ukrainians .
