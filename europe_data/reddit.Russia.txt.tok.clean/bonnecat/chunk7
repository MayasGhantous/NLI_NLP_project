  but all of them were from one city - kiev , the capital of ukraine . 
  no need for russia to wait for a genocide on russians in crimea and donbass . 
  check the facts : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/azov_battalion#human_rights_violations_and_war_crimes, 
  you need to ask my german friends and polish co-workers if they ever felt any sign of supremacy from me . 
  i hate to say it , but you lost in your past , mate . 
  russia ca n't get out of crimea and donbass . 
  next day there will be full scale genocide . 
  not to mention nato ( usa ) expansion . 
  sanctions should remain . 
  russian industry wo n't be happy to meet competitors at the moment . 
  russians even extended their own sanctions . 
  oil price drop is also a godsend . 
  russia ca n't just sell oil forever . 
  national currency drop looks like a fair price for industry raising . 
  who needs to buy those useless expensive foreign goods anyway ? 
  not david fincher definitely . 
  i remember the times i earned like 5 times less than now . 
  yet had everything to be happy . 
  and now i pay for a living about 5-10 times less than westerns . 
   things can only really go wrong if people fuck up real bad like a sabotage ? 
  like someone kidnaps your kids and tells you to do so ? 
  finally some truth from an american . 
  i even made a screenshot for the reference , thanks . 
  ukraine never was pro-russian , but crimea and donbass now 100 % pro-russian . 
  and you do whatever you please with useless ukraine and their mad radicals . 
  do n't fool yourself like putin could n't do anything to the coup . 
  you westerns love to say like putin has agents everywhere , can kill anybody , so ... 
  but definatelly putin could n't avoid oil prace drop and needed someone else to blame in national currency drop . 
  here comes old buddy obama . 
  russians blame obama & co and putin is just standing for crimea and donbass as they see it now . 
  brits already admitted that sanctions made totally opposite result . 
  yes , national currency got cheaper . 
  putin can now make it higher but does n't want it . 
  money are still arriving , it 's just became easier to pay to the people and save money for the military . 
  russians have less money so they do n't buy expensive ** foreign ** goods anymore . 
  russian money now flow into russian industry . 
  you removed foreign competitors from russian market and made it easier for russian industry to raise finally . 
  your allies lost huge russian market because of you . 
  obama can be proud of himself . 
  have i already mentioned brits ? 
  turkey , china , brits and more to follow . 
  oh , and i 'll let you know when i need toilet paper , thanks . 
  as you obviously have nothing new to say i 'm not going to waste my time here anymore . 
   you can not go around redrawing borders as you please and you ca n't change regime in ukraine as you please . 
  you lost what you were supposed to win . 
  hope you learned your lesson this time . 
  kaliningrad state alone has enough weaponry to calm down any stubborn neighbor at the moment . 
  and the governor of the state was replaced with an fsb officer for a reason btw . 
  not sure what your point was though . 
  we are not going to poland and baltic states anyway . 
  lol , time to wake up . 
  also , world dominator has * allies * you said ? 
  there must be more suitable word . 
   starved or killed en masse by stalin oh right , let 's bash about germans and french now because of hitler and napoleon . 
  did he pay to those as well ? 
  why would russia care about lithuania at first place ? 
  those are not even remotely close to any noticeable player on the geopolitical scene . 
  nothing more than us puppets . 
  when someone in right mind reads about `` invasion '' while both crimea and donbass are totally * pro-russian * territories , anti-russian propaganda + russophobia become obvious things . 
  breaking news are that both crimea and donbass are * pro-russian * territories . 
  so what `` invason '' west is yelling about ? 
   russia is happy with its neighbors as long as they are under their control . 
  if belarus decided to kick out ... 
  some kind of logic is behind that ... 
  wait till the same ** bloody ** story as with ukraine happen instead of solving everything more or less peacefully ... oh wait !, 
  * blood * is what makes russia really happy , right ? 
  and that 's the only reason why russians did n't give up to hitler as many others did !, 
  congrats , you nailed it . 
  cool . 
  so they are almost there . 
  easy ones to increase * russian territory * as you try to portray it . 
  yet nothing like that happens . 
  for whatever reason russians want to be on enemy lands instead . 
  love to be hit in back probably . 
  ever heard of russian troops , missiles in there ? 
  invide a county where everyone wants to hit you in the back ? 
  think again . 
   russia keeps fucking it up by annexing countries any idea on why no one speaks of possible russian invasion in belarus ? 
  putin does n't care about lithuania . 
  what they say ( what they told to say ) does n't matter . 
  this is far more interesting : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/10/its-time-for-a-thaw-in-our-relations-with-russia/, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_kosovo#drug_trafficking i could n't care less how much they kill each other . 
  if you still ca n't get it : there wo n't be anything like that inside russia . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_kosovo https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opium_production_in_afghanistan, 
  not all of them of course . 
  but i just looked into ukrainian subreddit ... 
  i wish i did n't . 
  and pick up a map or better a globe ? 
  ukraine did allow famouse russian show `` comedy women '' gave concert in the main stage if kiev after visiting crimea and singing about putin . 
  `` comedy women '' violated the border as well and were then giving an event in the main theatre in kiev where mop were present . 
  that was discovered by famous ukraine critic sharij in his [ vlog ] ( https://youtu.be/iyd5wfnwkya?t=6m55s ), 
  so all those on [ motorola ] ( https://image.inforesist.org/uploads/2016/10/8e53b4f373efc4c398cf8c32937b758e.jpg ) or [ givi ] ( http://www.dsnews.ua/static/files/gallery_uploads/images/589da42601471-c4tamebwmaabdfx.jpg ) fineral are the russians ? 
  it 's a war of ukrainian nazis and corrupt oligarchy , not of ukrainian people . 
   democracy cant work in many cultures/countries , russia is one of them pseudo-democracy can work at some degree though . 
  us , france are good examples . 
  modern joseph goebbels :  if you have brainwashed people enough with a specific agenda , it becomes a democracy . 
  huh ? 
  why do you want kaliningrad then ? 
  what are you gon na do with it ? 
  no panove , make up your mind and come back later .
