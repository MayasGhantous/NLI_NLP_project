  time is needed , no question here . 
  except for you it will be faster , cause you 're smaller and more homogeneous ... lucky you !, 
  make poland great again ? 
  i bet national pride is a big deal for the poles , even bigger than for the russians . 
  * i kinda known for the pro-polish sentiment *, 
  you mean local border traffic w/o visa . 
  some time ago poland closed it for political reasons , not sure how it is handled now , i never was interested in that . 
  what i meant was traveling to germany through poland by visa . 
  gees , you guys really need more territory . 
  imagine , one day all the poles around the world would have to return to poland . 
  they wo n't fit inside !, 
  i live in kaliningrad and last time i crossed poland border polish officers were n't much friendly . 
  better consider lviv , thats the real deal . 
  which ones people can watch in your country ? 
  oh wait , they all banned there . 
  peaceful protesters already [ killed one policeman ] ( https://twitter.com/soshnikoff/status/845996747994415105 ) edit . 
  it 's not clear he is dead or still alive . 
  invite that photographer in england . 
  england might surprise you . 
  yeah , france has a well known history of not attacking a countries . 
  rabbit hole goes deeper as it seems . 
  there is no such thing as `` my opposition '' . 
  what does that `` opposition '' want ? 
  to make a deal with clintons and mccains ? 
  do you even understand the whole mess is a result of the incoming financial crisis ? 
  they either have to fill trillions of their empty money with something like russia or face it in full scale . 
  but no , lets talk about stalin , our soros funded `` opposition '' and your `` democratic '' government which you hate for whatever reason . 
  see , i could bang jen psaki just fine , that does n't mean i find what 's on her mind any acceptable . 
  same thing with you : you consume what you want from russians and hate the rest . 
  here is why . 
  russian govt ? 
  i believe you meant putin , cause it 's not the same . 
  do i need to tell you how much support putin has among russians ? 
  putin represents ** us ** . 
  you hate him - you hate us . 
  the statement `` government is not the people '' only applies to non/pseudo-democratic countries . 
  most people have no idea on what 's going on and only repeat after media/govt whores . 
  you could just say to yourself do not mess up once again , yet you decided it 's safe to shit on your neighbor this time . 
  hope you understand now why guests like you are n't welcomed here . 
  several years earlier we could just * consume * something from you and be done with it . 
  but different times , different priorities . 
  or that 's just me and other russians here wo n't find any russophoebic shit in your quotes / be fine with it . 
  * let them sing in front of us and shit behind our back , who cares * . 
  good luck with chekhov . 
  i thought you ca n't read cyrillic , guess they made latvian editions of the russia classics . 
  ... oh well , at least it 's not some western edition of russia history . 
  i think you should ask questions to yourself instead . 
  you hate country and nation so much , yet you are fine to come and act on a stage there . 
  i do n't understand it and can assure you my countryman wo n't accept it too . 
  better think twice . 
  i request a permission to quote you in my personal announce for your performance in russia in may-june . 
  russia already has little crimea on baltic sea - kaliningrad . 
  not enough ? 
  then , by your logic , russia also has to invide turkey . 
  foreign shills always know best . 
  no doubts here . 
  oh , do n't worry about anti-russian propaganda [ they are doing fine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uddboud1_eu ) except people do n't really follow them . 
  bbc russian has 10 times less subscriptions than rt russian . 
  i 'm talking about experts that have no russophobic agenda . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perestroika  a staged coup to allow him to do whatever he wanted though add there shooting down a russian plane , a killing russian ambassador , anti-russian protests ( paid by whom ? ) . 
  nope . 
  those are attempts to breake russia - turkey relations . 
  guess what google suggests on the subject ? 
  you have no idea . 
  in fact it 's a total mess , a legacy of `` friendship '' with the west in 90s . 
  i do n't need to remind you that insane clean up that erdogan made for turkey after the failed coup attempt . 
  putin does have support from forces , governors ( appointed by him personally ) and people though . 
  for whom ? 
  most experts consider govt as * liberal * if you know what i mean . 
  do n't tell me a food store is a restaurant , you liar . 
  speak about the things you * know * . 
  oh , bellingcat ... [ bellingcat caught on spreading false information from ukrainian extremist site ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8myby-fhpyc&amp; ), 
  what a liar . 
  have a proof for that `` fact '' ? 
  fact is your beloved ukraine banned '' \u0414\u043e\u0436\u0434\u044c '' which spreads * liberal * bullshit in russia just fine . 
  russians do support * putin * , govt is a different story . 
   country is still corrupted as fuck but not as corrupt as ukraine i hope ? 
  except united russia is not a putin 's party . 
  he blocked several laws from them and did n't visit their last meeting . 
  not only the private sector . 
  central bankers will be called for pricey loans soon . 
  i mean those bitches :  the head of the imf lagarde has described the work of the head of the central bank nabiullina as `` fantastic '' see , you can gain even from bad situiations , depends on the point of view . 
  and putin is best in that . 
  * fak the eu * who 's asking eu ? 
  keep puppets in power and see what happens . 
  oh , we are so sorry for clinton 's plans ruined lol, 
  ukrainians themselves can ( and have to ) achieve freedom and democracy . 
  just give them 1000 years and see . 
  especially russia 's manufacturers . 
  * lol i see some got their feelings hurt *, 
  ca n't you abstain from making ignorant statements and educate yourself a little bit instead ? 
  they already did . 
  google for putin 's approval rating . 
  another good thing is that sanctions finally made russians asking a questions : - why russia 's central bankers keep loans that pricey ? 
  - how come russia 's right to print their own money disappeared after friendship with the west in 90s ? 
   the head of the imf lagarde has described the work of the head of the central bank nabiullina as `` fantastic '', 
  ca n't you just google for putin 's approval rating ? 
   not to use its territory to harm the security of each other exactly . 
  [ how russia ruined american plans in crimea ] ( http://en.reseauinternational.net/how-russia-ruined-american-plans-in-crimea/ ),
