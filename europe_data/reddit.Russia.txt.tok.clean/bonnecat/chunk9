  after all that russophobia from the west russian feelings have changed for sure . 
  i 'm living in kaliningrad btw . 
  as someone living in kaliningrad i can assure you russia 's market big enough for kaliningrad . 
  and if russia was close to a major economic crisis putin would just screw a few economist compradors asses who keep loans pricey :  the head of the imf lagarde has described the work of the head of the central bank nabiullina as `` fantastic '' putin is n't going to fak with western bankers so far , but as soon economy is in crisis anyway , game is over . 
  i 've lost all my trust to english wikipedia after this delutional bullshit : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foundations_of_geopolitics . 
  i do n't care how much brainless western propagandists mainteined that . 
  a reminder : you have right to post on reddit . 
  yet you have to follow reddit rules in your posts . 
  ignore these rules , even * peacefully * , and you get a warning or a ban . 
  ** peacefully = / = legally ** . 
  same thing like you ca n't steal things * peacefully * . 
  hope you got it now , cause i 'm not willing to waste my time on it anymore . 
  english wikipedia as a reference of russia 's law ? 
  you must be kidding . 
  once again . 
  ** right to protests granted by russian constitution ** . 
  that no way means you allowed to realize it improperly . 
  people have right to protest , i have right to not see/hear them . 
  dadin ignored the law and got the consequences . 
  dude got exactly what he wanted . 
  he was opressed by power for political reasons , now he can apply for a asylum . 
  and i guess romania should suit him well , since romanians care more for the sitizens of other countries . 
   laws that prohibit peaceful protests there is no such law . 
  right to protests granted by russian constitution . 
  written by americans in 90s btw . 
  if he was jailed * properly * they would n't let him go . 
  * releasing him for intimidation * ? 
  lol . 
  italian spent ** 20 years in jail for murder by mistake ** . 
  yet no one saw those sorosbots asking * whyyyyyy * . 
  i could advise you to think more , but we both know it 's pointless . 
  not as much as your brigade gets i suppose . 
  say hello to soros . 
  i suppose that should mean something ... but i have no idea . 
  speak like you 're russian please . 
  somebody tell them already how much support putin has among russians . 
  [ `` most prominent politician of the opposition '' visits american embassy for instructions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uhbateqdro ), 
  uk , how about to return : - islas malvinas - gibraltar - annexed part of cyprus - chagos archipelago ? 
  i 'm not an ukrainian , but here is how i see it : lower gas prices for decades is how russia can pay for a mistake that was made in 1954 . 
  by a legend it was decided that monument of the prussian imperialism had no place there . 
  i live in kaliningrad and can tell you there is still a lot of old buildings https://www.google.com/search?q=\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434+\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0435+\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430, 
  well , k\u00f6nigsberg was a center of german nationalism , so after ww2 they decided to take it away from germans * forever * . 
  there is still a lot of old buildings in kaliningrad . 
  russia 's constitution was written by americans in 90s , so you probably right . 
  [ according to the foreign affairs magazine - aleksander dugin is a `` key theorist of the ideological underpinnings of putinism . '', 
  in reality , dugin is simply involved in the workings of the united russia party , holding center-right political views . 
  this does not make him any more `` putinist '' , than it makes putin `` duginist '' . 
  nevertheless , dugin is a well respected political scientist in russia 's academia circles , and appears on many a russian tv show , as well as heading the katehon think-tank ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbywn2j_7ju ), 
   the head of the imf lagarde has described the work of the head of the central bank nabiullina as `` fantastic '' . 
   what do you mean by bringing your country down ? 
      i have to ask , since it seems pretty stupid to destroy your own country . 
  yes , but look at ukraine . 
  more likely this means there will be way less ukrainian pow for exchange next time . 
  https://lv.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimirs_buzajevs in short : he used the commision algos to extrapolate latvia after 1990 like it 's still in ussr , compared with modern latvia and got losses in eur 500b and 1m of population . 
  no way like i 'm willing to argue on this topic , just to let you know you 're likely just fooling yourself with that commision . 
  [ why baltics is not finland ( in russian ) ] ( http://www.rosbalt.ru/world/2017/02/02/1588066.html ), 
  that 's a complicated question . 
  oil takes only about 9 % in gdp atm . 
  fighting with corruption is the real problem . 
  western bankers praise russia 's central bankers for a reason . 
  thanks to the frienship with the west in 90s . 
  remember that insane clean up that erdogan has made for turkey . 
  thanks , i 'll look into this . 
  i guess i used a wrong word , i have n't watched it yet . 
  it seems it does reflect the reality in russia , from the feedbacks i see `` this guy is literally me !, 
  '' , `` must see if you 're above 30 '' and such . 
  from the description i can tell there is similar russian movie https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_asthenic_syndrome  the hero of the second story is a school teacher . 
  as a result of personal predicaments and problems at work he has gotten the asthenic syndrome -- he falls asleep at the most inappropriate times . 
  he is admitted to the hospital for the mentally ill where he gains the understanding that the people around him there are not any crazier than those who live in freedom . 
  after some time he is released and he ends up falling asleep on the subway . 
  the empty wagon takes away the sleeping man into a dark tunnel . 
  i try not to miss anything more or less worth watching . 
  and like i said , speaking of polish cinema i 'm just an addict . 
  lol , i even keep ` polskie g\u00f3wno ' in collection . 
  not sure when i 'll be in a mood to watch it though . 
  ` dzien swira ' is well known movie in russia . 
  it 's in my wishlist , i think i 'm waiting for hdtv quality . 
  i have n't watched them all yet . 
  some have no translations and i 'm not that good in polish . 
  trump 's enemies - clintons and mccains . 
  polish cinema probably is where my addiction in poland comes from . 
  i have about 100 polish movies in collection . 
  polish language sounds funny and i love it . 
  proud nation . 
  beautiful women and intelligent man . 
  rebels do n't need to attack . 
  they already winning because kiev makes less sence every day . 
  yet another ` expert ' in russian . 
  tell me more about russia please . 
  i know nothing , i just live there . 
  from r/anormaldayinrussia : - it 's russia after all . 
  why bother pushing the door when you can break it easily ? 
  - it 's poland - well , eastern countries then, 
  lol . 
  because there is a way more other russians who are n't suffering at all . 
  guess who else suggested that ? 
  frienship with the west in 90s led to a lot of compradors in russian financial and other institutions ( remeber that insane clean up that erdogan has made for his state ) . 
  western bankers praise russian central bankers for a reason . 
  but after recent events on the world political scene this also going to change . 
  why ?
