  [ why would you even consider competiting with this ?

  he is a strong welfare supporter . 
  when i was 20 , i 've been working at oil refinery . 
  i 've had twelve-hour shift , my first task there was to paint a wall . 
  i 've painted almost all of it in my first day , and in the end of the shift a whole working brigade came to me to tell that if i keep working at this rate , i will make them look bad and i 'll have problems . 
  so formally , i 've been working 4 hours longer than normal people do , but in reality i 've spent about half of my working time drinking tea with my brigade . 
  my point is that these working hours mean nothing . 
  i myself have two gay friends , i have no problems with different sexual orientations , but i do n't like being labeled as some evil force when i say that i do n't like these parades . 
  i would be as discontent for having `` straight parades '' if there were any . 
  sexuality and promiscuous sexual relations should n't be advertised . 
  sorry , but that 's how i feel . 
  still , it does n't mean anything . 
  actually , less working hours mean higher productivity . 
  japanese work 1700 hours per year , germans - 1300 hours , would you call them lazy , while greeks work 2000 hours ? 
  there is no pointing in counting working hours , it 's all about effectiveness of each hour that they spend at work [ 3 ], 
  there is no pointing in counting working hours , it 's all about effectiveness of each hour that they spend at work [ 2 ], 
  they still would remain in nato .

  limited free speech is not free . 
   getting stuff like infrastructure , healthcare , safety in return seems to be an alien concept russians believe that their money do n't provide these things , and for a good reason . 
  denying `` free '' infrastructure , healthcare , etc would be a political suicide for ** any ** politician here , but at the same time proper tax control would be catastrophic for russian economy . 
  ** translation ** ---------------------- vast majorty of russians approve or at least acceptive to shadow economy and do n't consider untaxed economic activity harmful . 
  [ according to a survey ] ( https://wciom.ru/index.php?id=236&amp;uid=116082 ) conducted by acspo ( all-russian center for the study of public opinion ) in february , ** only 25 % of the population consider doing business without official registration a crime . 
  ** this applies to the provision of services , opening small shops , workshops , studios , etc. 
  without obtaining permission from the authorities and , as a result , without paying any fees to the treasury . 
  64 % of citizens are supportive to such practices . 
  37 % said that they feel `` sympathetical '' and `` understanding '' to these kinds of business . 
  another 27 % believe that although it 's a bad practive , but it should not be penalize : it can also be considered a form of tacit approval . 
  according to acspo , only 43 % of the russian population has only official income . 
  among those who receive additional income from the provision of services , property renting , selling products grown in private plots and other activities , only 18 % declare their income . 
  three-quarters in the survey admitted that do n't report their earnings and did not pay any taxes for them . 
  public approval of tax evasion is growing from year to year and it is at the maximum level for the time of russia 's recent history , according to experts in ranhigs . 
  their survey , conducted in october , have shown a pattern similar to that found acspo : in 16 years , the proportion of those who are negative to the shadow business , fell three times lower : 42,2 % in 2001 and 16.4 % in 2016 . 
  the share of positive ratings , on the contrary , increased by 1.6 times in all socio-demographic and professional groups . 
  sympathy for the practice of tax evasion is growing as a global trend , `` the poor get poorer and the rich get richer '' trend in russia is not associated with entrepreneurs , says the general director of acspo valery fedorov . 
  `` according to common people , only officials get richer , not entrepreneurs '' , - he explains . 
   i am of the opinion that if you maliciously circumvent a law in order to break it , then you are as guilty of breaking the law as if you did not circumvent it . 
  yay , good ol' soviet-like non-formalistic law that you can twist as you like . 
  we have plenty of this shit , europe definetely should go the same way . 
  that it 's a good country to be living in when you 're old . 
  also low taxes . 
  wwiii would be unexpected , but definitely not sudden . 
  good joke . 
  wooooooo , * secrets * . 
  are they that uncommon in europe ? 
  russia would back up greece if eu does n't intervene in case of major conflict . 
  it will collapse any trust for eu competence . 
  what ? 
  no , nobody cared about him untill he was killed . 
  britain has to build up iron curtain policies to minimize foreign influence . 
  also , it has to create a secret service that will kidnap people who talk about their country outloud . 
  that will be british ultimate liberal democracy . 
  three guys tell each other how they ended up in gulag . 
  - i 'm imprisoned for insulting ivan . 
  - i 'm imprisoned for giving ivan a compliment . 
  - i 'm imprisoned for being an ivan that everybody talks about . 
   attention whore sums up what elections are for . 
  maybe , but not on eu principles . 
  people are not ants or robots to be always rational . 
  shameful . 
  you ca n't lock up people for being nasty . 
  authoritarian is not a synonym of right wing . 
  i wonder if there are ukranians who think about novorossia like this . 
  i would probably desert from 1st chechen war as well , i do n't need this shit-tear piece of land , so as my country . 
  this was a war of politicians , not people 's . 
  fuck corrupt politicians and officers , fuck dudaev , fuck chechen war and fuck chechnya itself as well . 
  there were no leaders in ukranian maidan either . 
  are you serious ? 
  dnr and lnr should n't be recognized as independent states , but i support russian government in this matter . 
  people in these regions ca n't ( and wo n't ) recieve ukranian passports for obvious reasons , but they should have some documents for identificate themselves , and these documents should be recognzied internationally . 
  the conflict began almost 3 years ago , imagine if you 're an average donetsk 17 years old guy and you have no valid passport . 
  you 're almost rightless outside of dnr . 
  you have completely wasted childhood then . 
  this was my favourite cartoon when i was 4-10 years old . 
  i had 3 vhs cassettes with it ** in a row ** , because i 've watched them so many times that they had their tapes just stretched out and stuck in the player . 
  the onliest thing i 've watched more is [ taxi ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0152930/ ) 1 and 2 : i 've had 4 cassetes of first part and 6 of second . 
  ^ p.s. 
  ^ damn , ^ i ^ want ^ my ^ childhood ^ back . 
  you got it wrong . 
  people who are registered at the employment center ( which basically means that they try to find a job ) do n't pay this tax . 
  tax evasion is a huge problem in post-soviet countries . 
  people just do n't work officialy - i 'm personally fine with that , but the government is n't . 
  you ca n't use both of them after the first hit . 
  it 's 100 % related to subject . 
  you said that there will be no private property , i asked you what is going to happen if someone wants to have it anyway . 
  and you already know the answer , you just do n't want to say it outloud , as you would sound as any other socialist who calls for violence against political opponents . 
  i want power over myself in the first place . 
  i want to be responsible only for ** my ** actions , and actions of those who ** i ** want to be responsible of . 
  i do n't want to stop eating bread because some [ random guy in charge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikita_khrushchev ) decides that corn is better than wheat . 
  are you going to answer my question ? 
   ideally they would become fellow workers i wo n't , and i 'm pretty sure that there are some people who wo n't either . 
  so i 'll ask again : what do you suggest to do if a bunch of people give your perfect communist society a middle finger ? 
   there would be no owners in a communist society communists will kill them ? 
  send them to uranium mines ? 
  how do you make property owners disappear without directly violating their freedoms ? 
  what do you suggest to do if a bunch of people give your perfect communist society a middle finger and build a capitalist-based system on the isolated island ? 
  if too many companies do n't pay minimum wage , then maybe it 's too high ?
