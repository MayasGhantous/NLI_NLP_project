  wow , this has never happened before , and here it is again . 
  there is a distinct class divide between communists and non-communists . 
  that 's why `` counter-revolutionary '' activitity is always banned in communist countries , that 's why you ca n't have legal opposition in communist state . 
  the owner of the means of production wo n't be able to live in communist society , as it 's completely intolerant to anybody who does n't fit their ideology . 
  communists do n't tell workers to leave capitalist company behind and create self-sufficient society by themselves , they tell them to seize capitalist 's property and create self-sufficient society on his bones . 
   but it is almost never racist or hateful it 's always hateful to particular social classes . 
  it 's always opressive against property owners . 
   bigger risk equals bigger potential for profit . 
  no , it 's not . 
  investment is not a damn casino . 
  what `` bigger potential '' you talk about ? 
  potential to have your business nationalised ? 
  potential to be jailed for not following 1500 regulation documents ? 
  i do n't see any profit in this , i do n't see any `` potential '' . 
  ** with marx , mao and trotsky on the crisis ** the political system has not sustained depression . 
  in 2015 a new coalition took the parliament : `` syriza '' ( it includes marxist , maoist , trotskyist , feminist and green parties ) . 
  the leader of `` syriza '' , the new greek prime minister and a fan of che guevara , alexis tsipras , announced plans to obtain an additional debt relief and soften austerity measures . 
  `` greece will leave behind five years of a catastrophic economy , the humiliation and suffering '' - he said at the meeting after the election . 
  tsipras rhetoric has spawned rumors about the possibility of default and leaving the eurozone . 
  the head of the eurogroup ( eu finance ministers ) jeroen deysselblum after a meeting with the new greek finance minister yanis varoufakis stated that the country must continue to reform . 
  and the sooner - the better , given that the latest agreement on the financing of greece will end in june . 
  but the left-wing government is trying to give up one third of the previously agreed austerity measures , referring to the promises made to the voters . 
  `` we spent two weeks discussing who and where and in what format will anybody meet , and it 's a complete waste of time '' , - said deysselblum 9th march . 
  and added , that if the greeks do n't fulfill the agreed austerity program , they wo n't recieve any more money . 
  ** blame each other and europe ** strange state of economy `` with a latin american way '' was supported by political system that lasted until the january of 2015 . 
  two approximately equally strong political clans : left panhellenic socialist movement ( pasok ) and the center-right party `` new democracy '' have been changing each other for decades . 
  they were led by the two most influential political dynasties - out of half-century of democratic rule , country was led by either karamanlis or papandreou families for 32 years . 
  both clans did not like each other , and each newly formed government usually started from accusing the previous one in sins of all sorts , including the distortion of economic indicators . 
  same thing happened at the beginning of the european crisis . 
  after winning in june 2009 , giorgos papandreou 's pasok , the 2009 budget deficit was revised from 6 % to 12.7 % . 
  the same was made in 2004 by `` new democracy '' . 
  before joining the eurozone , budget deficit was hidden by swaps in goldman sachs . 
  neither one nor the other party did not seek to change the economy . 
  a large number of inefficient civil servants - much to their credit . 
  to reinforce electoral base , they were generously handing out sinecures and supported friendly trade unions . 
  some major reforms were made by goverment of antonis samaras ( hereditary politician of `` new democracy '' ) - when there was n't a choice . 
  european troika of creditors ( ecb , imf , eu ) demanded deregulation of the economy , privatization and cutting budget expenses in exchange for partial debt relief and aid packages . 
  living within their means and paying off the debts was not easy . 
  cost-saving measures included freezing wages and the elimination of the 13th and 14th salaries , raising retirement age to 65 years , progressive taxation of high (  $ 1,400 per month ) pensions , increased vat ( from 21 % to 23 % ) and other taxes , the elimination of a variety of subsidies and benefits . 
  in 2008 , the country entered into recession , which seven years later turned into a depression : gdp fell by 25 % . 
  a new source of growth was n't found . 
  from 2008 to 2014 , gdp per capita fell from $ 30.7 thousands to $ 22.3 thousands , unemployment rose from 7.6 % to 25.8 % , the population has become poorer . 
  in 2014 , the budget still was unbalanced ( 2.7 % of gdp ) , while public debt increased from 113 % of gdp in 2008 to 169 % in 2014 , despite the debt restructuring ( $ 58 billions , 27 % of gdp was written off ) and seven budget austerity programs .

  ** business hell ** tax disorder is accompanied with horrible business conditions . 
  a recent study by the oecd ( with about 400 pages ) lists dozens of barriers to competition and absurd examples of overregulation . 
  transportation industry is monopolized by small amount of truck owners with 33 thousands licenses . 
  there have n't been any new licenses since 1970 , so a newcomer has to buy a license from its owner or his heirs for $ 50-300 thousands . 
  as a result , the cost of transportation in greece is the highest in the world . 
  greek research team iobe stated that shipping from athens to thebes ( 60 km ) is more expensive than shipping goods from athens to rome ( 900 km ) . 
  until 2011 , the teamsters union had been defending their privileges by blocking major highways and picketing parliament . 
  this example is not unique : before the reforms of 2011 in greece , there were 343 `` closed '' professions ( from the taxi driver to a lawyer ) , protected by expensive licenses . 
  this created a major distortion of the market . 
  for example , the pharmaceutical business regulation has led to the fact that of all the oecd countries in greece turned out to have the biggest amount of pharmacists and and least amount of pharmacies per capita . 
  list of absurd regulation is very long . 
  any business , until recently , was obliged to publish reports in two national and one regional newspapers . 
  supermarkets had to write up to 9 prices on their goods ( a combination of : with/without discount , with/without certain taxes , for 1 kg , etc ) . 
  farmers were told where they can use olive oil and where they could n't . 
  all this ( plus the frequent protests ) made greece a very bad place to do business . 
  in the doing business ranking , even after reforms , the economy occupies 61th place out of 189 - right between russia and tunis . 
  in the rating of of `` execution of court contracts '' the country is somewhere `` in africa '' - 155th place ( in average , it will take 1500 days for court to consider the case ) . 
  competitiveness of the economy is n't in a good shape as well : according to the global competitiveness report made by the wef in 2015 , the country is on the 81th place out of 144 ( predictably difficult situation with the subindex `` business overregulation '' , 136th out of 144 ) . 
  still , it 's a big improvement from 108th place in the pre-crisis 2010 ( between paraguay and bangladesh ) .

  ** tax heaven . 
  ** the greek economy is also very similar to the latin american countries in a habit of not paying any taxes . 
  nordic welfare states are financed by higher taxes on social obligations , while greece have been relying on external borrowing . 
  tax evasion techniques are simple . 
  small entrepreneurs , doctors and lawyers declared only $ 12 thousand every year . 
  `` poor '' households have been living a luxury lifestyle . 
  in 2010 , only 324 residents of wealthy northern suburbs of athens have indicated that they had a pool in the tax declaration . 
  tax authorities , after recieving the satellite images , found at least 16,794 pools . 
  and did n't seem to care before the crisis . 
  greek oligarchs were n't very interested in paying taxes as well . 
  almost all of the country 's billionaires ( forbes counted three in 2015 , bloomberg adds four more ) earned or inherited fortune made on shipping . 
  greece commercial fleet is the largest in the world , its magnates own 16 % of the commercial fleet in the world . 
  however , according to the constitution ( 1967 ) , they did n't have to pay receipts taxes . 
  only in october 2013 , the union of greek shipowners agreed on a voluntary `` crisis '' increase in payments to the budget . 
  however , in the case of increased tax burden , they threaten to switch jurisdiction to british or maltese . 
  german authorities were astonished by greek slackness and sent 170 trained tax collectors to greece for assistance . 
  they had to abandon the idea of sending a special european tax comissar : the greeks rebelled and reminded the germans about their war crimes in 1940s .

  ** greekommunism . 
  ** greek government happily found out that financing budget deficit in a single currency area became much easier . 
  the motivation to reduce the deficit and public debt has disappeared - why would you do anything , while your government bonds fly away like hot cakes ? 
  latin american problem of chronic budget deficits , debt and devaluation had been solved by the euro partners . 
  and it was possible to focus on the enjoyable - economic populism ( in the latin america it is always limited by the lack of finance ) . 
  until 2010 , greece had even more socialism than ussr . 
  the government provided free higher education , scholarships and free meals for students ( some of them were 40 years old ) . 
  until 2010 , civil servants received 14 salaries a year . 
  keep in mind all sorts of bonuses , social allowances and additional payments for a variety of things : coming to work on time ( despite the fact that most state-owned companies closed at 14:00 ) , knowledge a foreign languages , ability to work with pc or even for working outdoors . 
  in the pivate sector , employer could not fire more than 2 % of workers each year , and it was almost impossible to fire a state employee . 
  public sector took 40 % of the economy : railways , air traffic , forestry , numerous state committees ( for example , there was a committee of lake kopais , which dried up in 1930s ) - they all were state-owned . 
  the power of trade unions , including public servants , was monstrous . 
  the discontent of workers always caused massive protests ( the position of anarchists and communists in a country is traditionally strong ) . 
  striking greeks in the 2010s were a reaction to the crisis , but from 1980 to 2008 there was a record number of nationwide strikes ( 38 of 85 cases in all countries of western europe ) . 
  at the same time , all state-owned companies remain unprofitable .
