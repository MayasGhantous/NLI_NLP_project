  greek railways ( ose ) accumulated $ 10 billion debt and bring $ 2,3 million loss daily . 
  annual revenues of the ose is about $ 100 million , and the annual cost of the payment of debts and wages to 7000 employees on two tiny branch lines ( the average salary - $ 60 thousand per year ) - more than $ 950 million . 
  mountain trains in greece usually go empty , but their drivers recieve $ 100 thousands per year . 
  trade union protests do not allow privatisation of ose . 
  another example - the former state airline olympic airlines . 
  trade unions have been blocking the privatisation of loss-making company , but have managed to get themselves and their families free tickets to anywhere in the world . 
  in 2009 , the company was sold for $ 177 million with the proviso that greek government will cover the billion-dollar debt . 
  4500 fired workers recieved about $ 1 billion for compensation , providing new employment , pensions and insurance . 
  pensioners did n't have any troubles as well . 
  in 2009 , 250 thousands people ( ~ 10 % ) recieved more than $ 1,400 per month . 
  in the public sector , 8 % of employees were leaving for retirement in the age of 50 years ( some of them - in 26 years ) , 24 % - in 51-55 years and 44 % - in 56-61 years . 
  some exotic groups of citizen , such as unmarried or divorced daughters of deceased civil cervants , also had a right to recieve pensions - 40 thousands women spent $ 550 million per year . 
  communism in debt pushed greeks to live a beautiful life . 
  in the mid-2000s , according to a greek newspaper kathemerini , the country became the largest purchaser of cars porsche cayenne per capita in the world , athens marina competed in a number of yachts with monaco , more than 50 % of greek babies were born in private hospitals , where the cost of labor is often exceeded $ 10 thousands . 
  $ 9 billion was spent on the summer olympics in 2004 and the accompanying infrastructure megaprojects , which were left to rot after .

  ** translation !, 
  ** ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- so this is an article by russian economics journal written in 2015 , which explains causes of greek crisis in detail . 
  despite it is somewhat outdated , i think it 's still worth reading , as i think many people in [ this comment section ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5u68zp/greece_is_as_sick_as_ever_and_its_agony_goes_on/ ) do n't know much about subject . 
  so here is my translation . 
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- * if greece did not exist , it would be necessary to invent one . 
  as an example of destructive force of populism and living beyond one 's means and of how inflow of money does n't gurantee economic growth and prosperity . 
  * ** latin america in eurozone ** `` since the declaration of independence in 1830s , greece have been in a state of default 50 % of the time . 
  does it tell you something ? 
  if it was somewhere in latin america or asia , you would bet on argentina 's default scenario . 
  but greece is part of europe '' - that 's how us economist carmen reinhart described the greek situation . 
  economic history of greece is an example of years of careless waste and its consequences . 
  `` for decades , greece has n't had a very good financial reputation . 
  since 1940s , it has been a foreign aid recipient . 
  first it was the marshall plan , then the us subsidies for the purchase of arms , and , finally , eu mass cash infusion . 
  all this has created a culture of political and economic dependency in greece . '', 
  - echoes oxford analytica 's report `` greece : austerity package fails to convince '' . 
  leaving aside political correctness , it is rather a culture of parasitism . 
  last time greece had a balanced budget , it was a year of 1972 - still under the regime of the colonels . 
  since then , its budget deficit has averaged around 6 % of gdp . 
  in the 2000s the country was lucky . 
  before the introduction of the euro , greece had everything : high inflation , high interest rates and high public debt . 
  de facto , the economy did not meet maastricht criteria for for joining the eurozone ( public debt < 60 % , budget deficit < 3 % of gdp ) . 
  however , the decision was dictated by political rather than economic considerations . 
  and by manipulation : deficit and debt figures were deliberately understated , but it became clear later . 
  but the deed was done , athens joined the eurozone . 
  previously , greece had to borrow money at high interest rates . 
  european banks had to deal with high currency risks : drachma had been devalued against more stable european currencies ( especially against deutschmark ) regularly . 
  it kept banks from excessive lending . 
  the euro has eliminated the risk . 
  as a result , there was a sharp increase in demand for greek bonds and , accordingly , a same sharp decline in interest rates on them . 
  of course , banks lined up with the money for athens : on 1 january 2001 , immediately after the country 's accession to the euro area , greek 10-year bonds had a yield of 5.36 % per annum , while german 10-year bonds had only 4.85 % . 
  the stability was maintained for eight years . 
  [ next !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5u9ubj/drama_of_greek_carelessness/ddse0mj/ ), 
   given that `` reforms '' , when said by the troika , have proven to be a euphemism for `` cuts in social security '' because that 's what you do when you have a budget deficit . 
  they have it since 70s , for fuck 's sake . 
   it 's prospects are better but they still wo n't be good . 
  same people in the government , same angry mob on the streets when spends are cut , same shit-tear credit rating , and ** also ** a weak debt arbitrator in the face of eu and ecb . 
  it 's simply dangerous to invest there . 
  eventually , greece will have to leave ez and it will be a year of complete clusterfuck - no pensions , no social security , shit-tear salaries , unrest , etc. 
  there will be no miracle that greeks wait for . 
  and the more they wait , the harsher consequences will be . 
  same thing happened in russia in 1998 , it 's inevitable . 
  and greece will never see any investors after that ever again . 
   the candidate suffered another attack tuesday , leaving his website down for 9 minutes , according to agence france-presse . 
  `` hackers '' lmao, 
  why would you sell land next to your military sites to anyone ? 
  it is n't hard to believe for anyone who had n't fallen into `` trump is putin 's puppet '' hysteria . 
  anyone who is n't radical pro-putin or anti-trump expected this to happen at some point . 
  is there anything that trump could say to make this sub content except `` i resign '' ? 
  how british government manages to call for free trade , individualism and anti-regulation and pass these kinds of laws in the same time ? 
  trump is at least consistent in this matter , wtf is brits ' problem ? 
   the tatars and other balkan muslim communities have assimilated pretty well to europe it took hundreds of years . 
  cordoba caliphate was the first one . 
  and it will considered unlawful , even if held properly anyway . 
  so what 's the point ? 
   why not in crimea because there was one already . 
  dugin is a deluded idiot . 
  well , before russia have n't had crimea . 
  who will pay for it ? 
  i support the idea , but i do n't support spending any more money on this piece of land . 
  it 's a fucking black hole already . 
  it could n't . 
  it 's even more so when it comes to flow of documents and business software . 
  oh piss off . 
  among common people , nobody cares about making russia bigger . 
   not norway norway does n't allow dual citizenship anyway . 
  just create conditions where being a military is worth it . 
  i doubt us has any problems with volunteers . 
  i think it should not be called marriage , and should n't be mandatory for churches to accept it . 
  would you write all this if german intelligence confirmed russian envolvement ? 
  not really . 
  people do n't care anymore , they just try to live . 
  good riddance . 
  i did n't say putin is a good guy . 
  i 'm just saying that putin may not be involved in politkovskaya 's death . 
  they might have no connections to putin as well . 
  common delusion here is that people seem to think that putin is almighty , while he is not . 
  he helped to build this corrupt system , but he does n't have full control over it . 
  russia is waaaay too big , so corruption is widespread but not cenralized . 
  * `` moscow '' * just makes sure that nobody takes too big piece of the pie . 
  just to point out : politkovskaya was a ** major ** pain in the ass for caucasian elites , not for putin . 
  why go so far ?
