  i 'm curious if you know any recent studies on the topic ? 
  what i meant is that it 's a stretch to call tatars practising muslims when they generally do n't observe religious practises ( like fasting , prayer ) and have pretty `` secular '' lifestyles . 
  drinking alcohol , women not covering up , etc. 
   although if it 's about that what about the tatars than ? 
  they 're even practicing muslims in a very loose sense . 
  the majority does n't practise in their every day life , just on special occasions ( like weddings and such ) . 
  i also do n't think that it makes sense to fight with such an integrated nation , precisely because they are so integrated . 
  but if we 're discussing a hypothetical scenario where a nationalistic tatar group is trying to gain independence i do n't really see how shit could not go down . 
  things would get very heated within the republic itself in this case . 
  depends on your definition of `` not so hard '' , i do n't see how they 'd get a corridor without a war . 
  but you 're right , a strong wave of nationalism would have to be the drive for independence . 
  i do n't see why tatar nationalists would want to be a part of kazakhstan . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean ? 
  you said that since tatarstan is surrounded by russia it ca n't get independence unless it goes together with bashkortostan . 
  but tatarstan and bashkortostan together are still surrounded by russia , they wo n't have a border with kazakhstan where they can simply join up . 
  unless they go on the offensive and conquer the russian region between them and kazakhstan . 
  that would end up being quite an ugly war i imagine . 
  bashkortostan does not border kazakhstan . 
  they are separated from each other by a region with an ethnic russian majority . 
   including lot 's of russian citizens flooding into turkey again for vacation ? 
  it 's important to many people as a cultural symbol , but not so many are prepared to go to church every sunday and stand there during the hours-long service . 
  71 % of russians go to church , mosque , or synagogue according to a [ poll ] ( http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=9101 ) in 2012 . 
  ** 7 % go to religious buildings at least once a month ** , 30 % go to religious buildings from time to time , and 34 % go to religious buildings rarely . 
   the most frequently observed ritual in church is the placing of candles . 
  81 % percent of russians who go to church reported observing it . 
  the ritual is equally observed by orthodox respondents ( 86 % ) and respondents who do not consider themselves believers ( 81 % ) . 
   a considerable number of people who go to temples ( 38 % ) just speak to god , 31 % read prayers , 27 % kiss holy relics , 33 % give alms , 29 % donate money to temples , and 9 % go to temples to sanctify things . 
  11 % of those who go to temples told sociologists that they normally just watch . 
  from experience i can say that going to church for many people means popping in to light a candle and say a quick prayer . 
  actually attending a whole service is not something many people find necessary , even those that consider themselves believers . 
   which is a real problem with religiocity in russia and poland as far as i know . 
  in those places , priests literally indoctrinate people into specific political sphere , which is an antithesis of secularism . 
  i do n't know about poland , but in russia regular church attendance is very low . 
  religious identity is more of a cultural thing for many people . 
  you ca n't really get indoctrinated by your priest if you only step inside a church a couple of times a year to light a candle . 
   putin is having a hard time finding enough civil engineers to build roads . 
  lol , where are you getting this from ? 
  there is n't enough emigration going to rich developed countries , that it would leave the country a wasteland devoid of educated professionals . 
  most of our increased emigration has been going towards cis-countries ( like central asian guest workers returning home ) and our brainpower is surely not making a run for uzbekistan , tajikistan and the likes . 
  wait , in what way am i being oppressed as a woman in russia ? 
  cause i must have missed that ... 
  russia does n't only have native muslims . 
  there are also millions of muslim central asian guest workers who come here . 
   a similar situation is in georgia , where a province populated by ethnic russians feels discriminated against . 
  abkhazia and south-ossetia are populated by abkhazians and ossetians and they 've been revolting against georgia since before the soviet union broke up ( `` georgia for georgians '' did n't help ) . 
  they 've had their own wars at the beginning of the 90s and have been de facto independent since then . 
   we do n't even want those lands back anymore yeah , idk why you would want more lands populated by ethnic russians ... 
  two different guys . 
  the organiser of this attack was a chechen and one of the perpetrators was from dagestan . 
  is there a breakdown of ethnic identification by age brackets ? 
  well , kaliningrad is already an internationally recognised part of russia . 
  we do n't need anybody to `` grant '' it to us . 
   russia claims a lot of territory in the baltics too ahem , what ? 
  you 're not actually russian , are you ? 
  i mean , it 's technically not an actual independence day . 
  but stupid people will say whatever . 
  i 'm assuming he called it polish because of sikorsky . 
  his father , ivan sikorsky , was partly of polish descent ( sikorsky is a polish family name after all ) , but at the same time a russian nationalist so i think claiming polishness through that connection is a stretch . 
   i am not joking . 
  before the fall of the of the soviet union russians were much richer than polish people . 
  and then russia proceeded to crash and burn after soviet union fell apart . 
  so while poland was growing in the 90s , russia was falling down . 
   most countries , especially spain , italy , the balkans , and ** eastern europe ** , are closer to averaging on 1 child per woman than 2 children . 
  russia had a tfr of 1.78 and belarus had 1.71 ( same as denmark ) in 2015 . 
  they brought back the same holiday that used to be celebrated up to the revolution , till it was replaced with a commemoration of the october revolution . 
  since the revolution could n't be celebrated anymore something was needed to fill that place again . 
  lol , his father was 88 . 
  old people die , that does n't take a conspiracy to happen . 
  well , both his parents passed away before he became president . 
  according to wiki his mother died in 1998 and his father in 1999 . 
   vladimir vladimirovich putin was born on 7 october 1952 in saint petersburg , russia , the youngest of three children of vladimir spiridonovich putin and maria ivanovna putina . 
  do you have some new and exciting information about his father not actually being his father ? 
  the 2008 war has not left a deep mark in the russian psyche ( i 'm guessing it 's different for the georgians ) . 
  like at all . 
  armenia is obviously seen as a more friendly state than georgia . 
  but as far as how people are seen it has n't changed much . 
  maybe armenians are perceived more favourably , but the difference is n't pronounced at all . 
  i 've looked it up and according to a poll by caucasus barometer in 2015 , 48 % of georgians approved of their women marrying russians vs 46 % who disapproved ( http://caucasusbarometer.org/en/cb2015/marwrus/ ) . 
  comparing with poll on marriage of women to americans , who should be their bestest friends after all the conflicts with russia , and it 's at 42 % approval vs 51 % disapproval . 
  well , there are still a lot of cultural differences between us even if armenians and georgians are christians . 
  including the fact that caucasians are , well , more patriarchal and traditional than russians . 
  in this poll armenians , georgians and azerbaijanis were also all put in the same category . 
  they were lumped together in the poll , so there are no separate numbers . 
  but i imagine since armenians and georgians ( probably would n't be much difference between the two ) are christian , they would score higher than azerbaijanis if polled separately . 
  still , there are some noticeable cultural differences between russians and all three south caucasian ethnicities . 
  so i do n't think the difference would be that dramatic . 
  ukrainians and belarusians - 37 % positive , 45 % neutral , 14 % negative and 5 % d/k . 
  latvians/lithuanians/estonians - 14 % positive , 43 % neutral , 35 % negative and 8 % d/k . 
  german/french/english - 17 % positive , 44 % neutral , 33 % negative and 7 % d/k . 
  americans - 14 % positive , 41 % neutral , 37 % negative and 8 d/k . 
  i can understand being neutral about it , but 24 % of white americans * strongly * favour their relatives marrying someone of another race ? 
  the strong preference part is just strange to me . 
  bulgaria is in the 20-29 % comfortable bracket though and they have about 10-15 % muslims . 
  the last russian poll on the topic of mixed marriages i 've seen is from 2010 , so it 's been a while . 
  the question was basically ` what would be your stance towards a close relative marrying someone of the following ethnicity ' ? 
  marriage with a jewish person - 10 % positive , 37 % neutral , 46 % negative and 7 % d/k . 
  only majority positive results were for ethnic russian - 70 % positive , 26 % neutral , 2 % negative and 2 % d/k . 
  majority negative results chechen - 5 % positive , 23 % neutral , 65 % negative and 7 % d/k . 
  arab - 6 % positive , 23 % neutral , 63 % negative and 8 % d/k . 
  central asian - 6 % positive , 27 % neutral , 60 % negative and 7 % d/k .
