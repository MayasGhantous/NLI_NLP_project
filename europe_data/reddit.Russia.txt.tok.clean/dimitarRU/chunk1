[ why the hell not ? 
  this is pathetic . . 
  `` do not expect that once taking advantage of russia 's weakness , you will receive dividends forever . 
  russians have always come for their money . 
  and when they do come - do not rely on the agreement signed by you , that you are supposed to justify . 
  ** they are not worth the paper on which they 're written ** . 
  therefore , ** with the russians you either play fair , or do not play at all ** . '', 
  -- bismark . 
  if you 're going to use bismark , the least you can do is quote him correctly . 
  a beacon of western civilization disapproves ? 
  how 's is your western pr any different ? 
  there is no unbiased media in the world , the faster you get that through your cultural european head , the better . 
  so , i happen to be a patriotic , positive russian [ fuck me ] ( http://images.rapgenius.com/a60d66863a9744ffb883f2cf2cc6eec7.500x321x1.jpg ) right ? 
  i 'm not for violence against women , you twat . 
  those degenerates harm feminist movement , not aid it . 
  i do n't undertsand how a decent person might consider women that stuff frozen chickens in their vaginas as freedom fighters . 
  or consider orgies in a [ biology museum ] ( http://plucer.livejournal.com/55710.html ) full of children , as some form of sick artistic expression . 
  russia has many problems , but agitators like you make it seem 10 times worse . 
  its just blind hate . 
  no constructive criticism , just hate . 
  it 's not putin , or fools , or corruption that messes up russia its the people like you and their endless moping fatalism . 
  i 'd say that the word liberal is a dirty word in a russian lexicon . 
  a lot to do with 1990 's and `` liberal '' yeltsin 's rule . 
  i do n't know what russia you live in . 
  but i feel good , and secure , and productive . 
  so do n't color all of us with the same brush . 
  russian here ... 
  there are several types of russian emigrants . 
  many of white russians ( revolution emigres ) living in france , or usa strike me as very educated , cultured and very patriotic toward russia . 
  they are supportive to the current russian government , and tend to think negatively towards ussr , though they are still proud of soviet scientific and cultural achievements ( space race , victory in ww2 , superpower status ) . 
  2nd type are educated scientist emigres . 
  they left around the breakup of the soviet union , and they mostly live in university towns in us or england , teaching students math , chemistry , and physics . 
  they 're usually very bitter about break-up of the soviet union , and tend to be stuck in 90 's about their perception of russia . 
  nevertheless they tend to be very patriotic and cultured . 
  3rd type are the infamous natashas and svetlanas . 
  at home they do n't gather much respect , as they 're considered gold-diggers , and whores . 
  usually they 're from ukraine or kazakhstan , or some other post-soviet state . 
  relatively few of them are russian . 
  they 're mostly uncultured , uneducated province girls , they mostly hate russia . 
  ( i actually met a couple in my trip to usa , and they refused to speak russian with me , and thought of themselves as my betters , even though their english was terrible ) . 
  4th type are the jews from all over former soviet union . 
  they tend to very critical and spiteful of contemporary russia considering its pro-imperial revival as a return to a [ pogrom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pogrom ) land . 
  i also found striking of how soviet their mindset is , you walk in their house and you 'd think they 're stuck in the soviet union of 70 's . 
  edit : but then again , those are my perceptions and they might not apply to other russians out there . 
  edit # 2 : most of the people in russia are either very critical of the diaspora , or totally indifferent . 
  there are some people who consider recent diasporas as rich oligarchs who robbed the land and now live in london somewhere , others think that people in diasporas were too weak to survive the turbulent 1990 , so they p #ssied out ( kind of like rats leave the sinking ship first , before anyone else ) . 
  i think the most iconic russian painting is '' \u0411\u0443\u0440\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u0435 '' [ volga boatmen ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/ilia_efimovich_repin_%281844-1930%29_-_volga_boatmen_%281870-1873%29.jpg ) by ilya repin . 
  my favorite one is victor vasnetsov 's '' \u0412\u0438\u0442\u044f\u0437\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0442\u044c\u0435 '' [ vityaz at the crossroads ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/19-v_2h_vasnetsov.jpg ), 
  nada , whatever you think of a man he is a political genius . 
  i think for the moment he is perfect for russia . 
  once things get calm and orderly here , we can have someone nicer as a president . 
  you tell russia not to meddle in ukrainian affairs , yet you pull this sh * t off . 
  that decision will probably create even a bigger political sh * tstorm , russia will be forced to do something to further its interests . 
  1 ) encourage young ethnically-indigenous families to have at least 2 children ( money ) . 
  2 ) allow only highly educated skilled workers entry to the country . 
  3 ) if you allow the immigrants , let the people that will have no problem integrating . 
  4 ) not racist at all . 
  why allow uneducated masses enter your countries when they do n't even bother adapting , have a ton of kids that burden your economy , and scream discrimination every time some one makes them do something ? 
  coming from a pole ? 
  i teared up a little ;') . 
  do n't kid yourself . 
  russophobia is ingrained in polish culture . 
  you 'd still despise us whether we 're communist , nationalist , capitalist , or monarchist . 
  lol you 're a moron of you think that russians were n't affected by holodomor . 
  4 of my grandmother 's siblings died because of hunger around volga region . 
  and that hunger was instituted by stalin ( who was ethnic georgian ) . 
  so next time research more and troll less . 
  there is a widespread belief in russia that if you sit on something cold you would become infertile , or worse fuck up your prostate . 
  thus , voila russians came up with slavsquat . 
  people wear crosses here just for fashion , and go to churches just to smell some honey xd . 
  not lawmakers per se , just one [ lawmaker ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vitaly_milonov ) , author of our gay propaganda law . 
  how about russian position regarding syrian conflict and iran ? 
  remember when snowden got asylum ? 
  remember how obama avoided putin , cancelled meetings ? 
  or are you really this naive to think that relations got bad only after ukraine ? 
  we 've got a saying here : `` just because you 're paranoid does n't mean that there is n't someone out to get you '' . 
  we russians are a paranoid bunch . 
  bullshit , this sub is the same if not worse , you 've got a hive mind and anything against it gets downvoted to shit . 
  pro and neutral stances about russia get thrown in the gutters , and people here treat putin as a lovechild of satan , hitler and stalin put together . 
  but hey , do n't take my word for it , i 'm just an average simplistic russo-mongol invader from the east , its way over my head . . 
  please , this circle-jerk started before this ukrainian mess even before the olympics . 
  you 've made even the most self-hating russians either defend their country or leave this sub . 
  am russian can confirm , he personally fries jews on the skillet . 
  they do n't want to secede from russia anymore . 
  its way too beneficial for chechnya to be part of rufed right now , they get tons of dividend money , development projects , no more clan-based warfare , and safety . 
  as for why they fight , kadyrov probably wants his soldiers to get more combat experience , or maybe even improve the image of all chechens in russia . 
  if its the latter , then he is succeeding , because their reputation is at all time high . 
  i would n't be surprised , given the cia 's history with supporting anti-russian `` freedom fighters '' . 
  but they are just rumours , there are no proofs , and even if there are , then fsb does n't disclose them for some reason . 
  after 9/11 us completely changed its tune regarding the chechens , before they were freedom fighters , rebels , after that they became terrorists and americans and russians found themselves cooperating on the war on terrror . 
  sure , the dagi jihadist assholes wanted the chechen jihadist assholes to come and `` liberate them '' . 
  regular folk ... not so much . 
  you 're right , russia is very diverse i cant say that russia as a whole has a negative perception of chechens , but for dagestanis chechens are jackals and thiefs , who have been raiding and stealing for the better part of their history , avars have a special beef with you , considering that you tried to make [ hadji murat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hadji_murad ) a chechen with post 1st chechen war history revisionism . 
  i 'm an ethnic russian that was born in the republic of [ dagestan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dagestan ) , its not chechnya per se but i was brought up as a caucasian i can say that the chechens are probably the most unpopular ethnos in today 's russia . 
  might not be politically correct , but in dagestan and in russia as a whole they have reputation of jackals , lacking honour , and decency . 
  during the 1st war many people used to sympathize with their struggle for independence , many russians believed that they should split away from us , yeltsin completely bankrupted the army , our 18 yr old boys were butchered in that very unpopular war . 
  so chechens were given de juro autonomy , de facto independence , and were kind of forgotten for a couple of years . 
  but in those couple of years , seemingly secular nationalist strive for independence was replaced by a jihadist desire to create the [ caucasian emirate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caucasus_emirate#/media/file:caucasus_emirate.svg ) personally i blame saudis , and their mercenaries ( there are funny stories of chechen village women seeing black jihadists for the first time and thinking they 're the devils ) . 
  so chechens decided to invade dagestan ( i still remember the day i was in school in mahachkala and did n't understand wtf was going on ) . 
  so , yeah , then putin came and bombed the living shit out of chechnya , put clan kadyrov in power , and the army routed the jihadists into the mountains .
