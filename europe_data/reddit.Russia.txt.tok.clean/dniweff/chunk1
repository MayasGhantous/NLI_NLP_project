russian or bust it 's very popular opinion among / r/europe :( about komi : all public services are available in russian . 
  some of them ( for example , [ this website ] ( http://prntscr.com/b0gk0f ) are in komi ( partly , it 's not fully translated yet ) and russian . 
  afaik , if one lives close to urals , then he has more chances to encounter komi-speaking official . 
  * iirc * , the situation is better in republic of tatarstan - you can get almost all services in tatar language . 
  so , it depends, 
  most of them are national languages of republics of russia ( e.g. 
  republic of komi has komi language ) . 
  so pupils learn russian language , national language ( if they live in republics , though it 's not the only case ; also it depends on school ) , and foreign one ( usually english ), 
  depends on location and some other factors i think, 
  it should be `` is suomi '' or `` called suomi '' , but in russian we usually omit these verbs,

  well , the map is of about 2 centuries ago : ^, 
  almost never , tbh . 
  at least quick google/yandex search did n't help me to find anything on it . 
  thanks  i looked for other sources , but there 're no details . 
  it 's only known that certain citizen accused the ad of spreading such propaganda . 
  officials of federal antimonopoly service and roskomnadzor will make a decision in 2-3 weeks . 
  also they ( local officials ) say this is first case in their experience on this subject some links ( in russian ) : http://www.news29.ru/novosti/obschestvo/zhitel_arhangelska_uvidel_propagandu_gomoseksualizma_v_reklame_calvin_klein/52426 http://flashnord.com/news/zhitel-arhangelska-pozhalovalsya-na-propagandu-gomoseksualizma-v-reklame-calvin-klein https://rns.online/advertising/v-arhangelskoe-ufas-pozhalovalis-na-calvin-klein-za-propagandu-gomoseksualizma-2016-03-14/, 
  russia has both government and private media . 
  yes , most of media is governmental . 
  private media can print everything they want , though there 's a chance that they ` ld be prosecuted and sued by some officials . 
  but claim that whole media is totally controlled by state is obviously wrong, 
   according to the rambler news service , officials in the northern coastal city of arkhangelsk , near the white sea , are reviewing the advert for ck2 ** after a resident saw the clip on youtube and complained that it contains ` elements of propaganda of homosexuality and paedophilia ' . 
  ** well , they have to do it because smbd asked for investigation, 
   that russia has government controlled media is enough for me ... and which country has n't ? 
    is he  she, 
  i agree that the law is stupid but i ca n't understand the exagerration on * even *, 
  you are missing the part that these proposals were not passed , the abortions are completely legal now and their amount is giant . 
  so russia is hardly anti-abortic atm . 
  the church is anti-abortic by its canons . 
  the fact of some weeklong campaign in 2011 does n't prove nothing at all, 
   they even investigated a fucking zoo :  is n't that right that everybody may sue any other for some reasons and the officials are to do some investigation ? 
   anti-abortion lol what , at least read wikipedia before posting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abortion_in_russia and please do n't use the argument that if i did n't comment on your another claims i ` ld agree they 're right  anti-intellectualist that sounds so ridiculous , therefore i ask you to give proofs,

   i could n't find a better infographic , please comment if you do [ the same but more useful infographic about russian navy ] ( http://imgur.com/6eysljc ) [ russian navy submarines chart ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russian-navy-submarines-chart-2016-2 ) - [ pic ] ( http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/56c32f162e52651c008b7513-1920-1280/russian-navy-submarines-1920-infographicposter.com.jpg ), 
  i did n't say `` absolutely neutral '' , just `` more neutral '', 
  it 's not his point most likely . 
  euromaidanpress is heavy anti-russian propaganda site , whereas rt has pro-governmental bias . 
  so we are to look for some more neutral source, 
  the video is hilarious and not offensive btw ( but some , especially elder people may say that it is ) . 
  at the moment it is not presented in russia media . 
  well , russia has more democracy than certain asian countries , maybe she was yelling about that, 
  according to this poll 1 - 0.5 - 0.5 * 0.52 = 0,24 so 24 % of population is not from russia . 
  though there are more relevant sources such as official census data, 
  imho , if they were involved they would do it more professionally . 
  also he was n't a threat for them because of his lack of popularity, 
  i think that it would be better if they hold silence at least because he used to be deputy prime minister but most of the people do not care of such cases . 
  thanks you , trolls brigade , for such a enlightenment, 
   the kremlin has repeatedly downplayed nemtsov 's significance and why is he significant ? 
  ( for instance , i have n't heard literally anything about him until his death ), 
  tv channel was [ ots ] ( http://otstv.ru/ ) [ here is the video from the local news ] ( https://youtu.be/b2n91e3pp1k ), 
  well , it 's worth watching . 
  but imho russia ` ld be happy if norway stopped producing oil . 
  also i have few questions : why did the usa leave nato ? 
  why did eu invite rf to invade norway ? 
  why did norway decide to stop producing oil immediately when almost no country is able to use thorium instead of oil ( afair ) ? 
  in my last comment i wrote `` one room '' , not `` apartment '' . 
  depping ? 
  ok , i 'm sorry , maybe i missed smth . 
  i was trying to examine this information because the friend of mine is renting one room for ~ 200 $ / month in spb ( not suburbs ) just now , therefore i thought the costs in peripheral towns should be significantly lower . 
  sorry if i offended you somehow, 
  order by cost and skip promoted ads,

  168 - 40 ( job ) - 10 ( commute , etc. ), 
  - 56 ( sleep ) = 62 . 
  a half or even third ( i 'm not sure though ) of this time will be enough for remote education i guess, 
  well , i 'm sorry for you , but you 've chosen one of the most paid-less jobs . 
  i do n't know about your region , but for example almost everywhere in russia shop assistant ( the job that does n't need special skills ) earns much more than social worker . 
  also , even now you have an opportunity to pass exams and enter some cool university in moscow/spb/kazan / etc. 
  and achieve multiple goals - good education , scholarship , moving from poor region to wealthy . 
  of course , it 's significantly easier to find well-paid job in these cities . 
  : i do not excuse current situation in rf , just saying that you can change your life,
