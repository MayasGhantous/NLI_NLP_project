  nya !, 
  : regardless of putin himself , the map seems to be a map of stereotypes about how he sees that countries, 
  saint pete is fond of you then because russian government claims that moscow is the capital of russia ... ( sorry ), 
  eli5 why do russia publish its geopolitical strategy in any paper ? 
  ( serious question ), 
  russia , norilsk [ first ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/cityporn/comments/20monm/norilsk_russia_arguably_the_most_depressing_city/ ) [ second ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1rnxfg/this_russian_city_looks_like_mordor/ ), 
  tbh , i do n't care about crimea ( \u041a\u0440\u044b\u043c / krym ) and whose it is at all ( it is located far far away from me ) so , i chose some random blank map, 
  yes , but i 've lost the access to image properties, 
  well , the only example i 've found is \u0410\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043d \u041d\u0443\u0442\u0433 ( andormudin nutg ) in kalmyk ( the native language of the republic of kalmykia , subject of russian federation ) [ prooflink ( in kalmyk ) ] ( https://xal.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%90%d0%bd%d0%b4%d0%be%d1%80%d0%bc%d1%83%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%bd_%d0%9d%d1%83%d1%82%d0%b3 ) edit : typo fix, 
  also unofficial names for belarus and moldova are belorussiya and moldaviya, 
  ok , my bad, 
  [ a huge list in russian wiki ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%98%d0%bc%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b0_%d1%81%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b5%d1%82%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%be_%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b8%d1%81%d1%85%d0%be%d0%b6%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f ), 
  house of cards was aired on state \u0441hannel \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 ( `` the 1st '' ) , so i think pretty much nothing, 
  no , that 's some propaganda bs xd . 
  for example , imma watch dr. 
  strange and fantastic beasts in cinema in november, 
  speaking of russia , it 's usually full dub for movies and voiceover for series . 
  tho i prefer original voice with subtitles . 
  wow , why is the `` women in parliament '' a dominant indicator for top countries ( according to the figure ) ? 
  i ` ld say the methodology is pulled out of ass, 
  now it 's your turn :3, 
  sky news shitpost about russia aswell, 
  a bunch of cherrypicked facts ofc , they forgot to mention that : * women got pension 5 years before men ( f 55 / m 60 years ) * they are not conscripted to army * they have to be paid their avg . 
  salary for 2 months before and 2 months after the birth of the child , and 40 % of salary for 1.5 years of maternity care ( if they want ) - tho maybe i mixed some numbers here * perhaps something else, 
  thanks , fixed, 
  i would n't believe sky after their story about romanians selling weapons tho i guess you mean this article ( http://news.sky.com/story/revealed-russias-secret-syria-mercenaries-10529248 ) that claims that according to some guy `` approximately 500 to 600 people have died there '' . 
  sounds fishy , does n't it ? 
  edit : fishily -  fishy, 
  in russia it is forbidden to sell alcohol in retail at nights ( 23:00 - 8:00 ) , but some regions have stricter rules ( e.g. 
  saint petersburg 22:00 -11:00 ), 
  clickbait headline : ^, 
  parties : 1 . 
  rodina - homeland 2 . 
  kommunisty rossii - communists of russia 3 . 
  partiya pensionerov = pensioners ' party 4 . 
  partiya `` zelenye '' - green party 6 . 
  grazhdanskaya platforma - citizens ' platform 7 . 
  ldpr - liberal-democratic party ( # 2 ) 8 . 
  parnas - peoples ' party for justice 9 . 
  yabloko 12 . 
  kprf - communist party of rf ( # 3 ) 13 . 
  patrioty rossii - patriots of russia 14 . 
  spravedlivaya rossiya - just russia ( # 4 ) there 's a website with reports about problems/violations during elections - https://www.kartanarusheniy.org/ also according to the latest data the turnout seems to be low, 
  idk about what 's taught at school now , but few years ago it was completely opposite to what you are saying, 
   it 's just really sad how all the soviet accomplishments are immediately associated with russia . 
  yeah , as well as all soviet fuck-ups / wrongdoings, 
  rkn is known for their bad memeing . 
  btw if somebody interested pornhub.ru mirror works fine, 
  you are mixing two different meanings together , in this context it is safe as in `` sfw '', 
  yes it has shit ton of porn of every category given that there is english interface available , all you need is to register and uncheck `` safe search '' when making queries also there are many videos that can be found only by joining special private groups ( usually one enters easy without being asked anything ), 
  vk.com *, 
  afaik it 's original story ;-(, 
  yeah , i hope they wo n't fuck this up ( the director has bad reputation here ) tho , this movie has a budgete of ~ 5 mln $ - almost nothing compared to marvel/etc, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsqvdrillx - russian trailer + eng subs, 
  i meant russian one , of course, 
  well , it 's just one division , tho you 're right - military budgete in general seems to be too huge, 
   russkij golos , russian `` further defensive orders '' `` the cause of further defensive orders '' `` russian gymnazium in warsaw '' `` french railroads '' `` arrest of a boy ... '' `` english answer given to hitler '' `` young ... '' `` from the publisher of the newspaper '', 
  ok , there 's some additional info ( source - http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3076085 ) * limited edition only in saint petersburg ( btw echo.msk.ru claims that only in one restaurant ) * bk 's press center says that they have chosen pavlensky after analyzing mass media in order to find most well-known citizens of spb * they also say it is being done in order to attract attention to their sixth anniversary in saint petersburg * the author of idea is natalya shwedkova - marketing director for north-west federal district ( szfo ) . 
  `` she lives in piter and knows the auditory '' * everything related to the anniversary ends on the 11th of september so far it seems trustworthy to me because kommersant checks facts ( well at least i have n't encounter vice versa ), 
  `` putin critic '' is op 's commentary , not source 's words ( not covered by the article at all ) well this sounds formal but imo * ordnung muss sein *, 
  yeah i have just googled his words . 
  also for those who are interested in what he exactly was saying there 're his facebook and [ the website he was the editor of ] ( http://nr2.com.ua/ ) btw found one interesting enough [ quote ] ( http://nr2.com.ua/news/politics_and_society/shchetinin-priezzhiy-iz-rossii-protivnik-putina-eto-eshche-ne-storonnik-ukrainy-video-103818.html ) that tens of millions of russian refugees could overflow ukraine in the future, 
  it does n't change this fact but it does break / r/europe 's rule :  editorialised titles - do not add your opinion/commentary to the article 's title . 
  do n't add something that is n't covered by the article , and do n't misrepresent the article . 
  adding a sentence verbatim from within the 1st paragraph or byline that is more representative of the content is generally ok but only where it improves clarity . 
   russian journalists committing `` suicide '' . 
  in this particular case it is what ukrainian source ( unian ) claim, 
  why editorializing the title tho ? 
  there 're no occurences of both `` putin '' and `` critic '' in the article edit : or at least it ` ld be nice to give some context for those who are unaware of his relations w / putin also for those who not gon na read it :  russian journalist alexander shchetinin , who was living in kyiv , has been found dead in his flat  the portal reported that alexander had suffered a gunshot wound to his head , and a gun was found underneath his chair . 
  sources allege that the case is being investigated as a suicide , as the journalist had reportedly sent an email to a relative saying he had planned to commit suicide . 
   alexander shchetinin is the founder of the novy region ( new region ) news agency , which split into the ural and ukrainian editorial offices in 2014 . 
  the journalist gave up his russian citizenship and became a ukrainian citizen , taking up residence in kyiv . 
   what they call the great patriotic war btw literal translation is `` great war for the fatherland '' if somebody interested, 
   are you afraid about growing power of putin ? 
  well , he has already been the most powerful man here for a decade  do you feel like the country could turn into some form of totalitarian regime ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  for me as a regular citizen almost nothing ( except bad economical situation now ) has changed since 2009 or smth ( ca n't recall what was before it ) if i considered emigration , it ` ld be mostly because of economical reasons . 
  i posted it there - https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4z7ogw/russia_results_of_the_poll_about_trust_in_mass/ i do n't know anything about state of these archives . 
  but i was born in komi republic ( there were lots of gulags in stalin times ) and i know that their history is greatly documented . 
  for example `` pokayanie '' fund published a passional on it consisting of like 20 books ( interesting read - personal stories , memories , statistics and lists of prisoners and so on , but unfortunately available only in russian ) with partial support of komi government . 
  i ` ld say that the problem in this case is that general population is not interested in history , etc. 
  edit : thanks for the gold, 
  interesting , til . 
  though i do n't think it happens here ( at least , to such extent ) . 
  we had federal census in 2010 and ~ 20 % said they are not of russian nationality ( and totally about 100 nationalites were mentioned - http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/croc/documents/vol4/pub-04-01.pdf ) i understand that romanian/russian thing is political tho even given that transnistria is supported by russia , situation inside it is much worse than here, 
  can you say something on topic and not just shitpost ? 
   could be interpreted as lack of patriotism or even treason . 
  what edit : i mean , elaborate please, 
  levada center is not a governmental organization tho, 
  / shrugs and what was the point of fabricating these results ( of this certain poll ) ? 
  the source is a pdf ( http://www.levada.ru/cp/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/doverie_tablitsy.pdf ) from this levada poll - http://www.levada.ru/2016/08/12/14111/ unfortunately i had n't found english version so translated it myself the poll was done in this jule among 1600 participants from different places of russia, 
   closing archives about gulags you probably mean the museum in perm . 
  idk , why was it closed but it was a single case afaik . 
  for example , there 's a working state museum of gulag in moscow - http://www.gmig.ru/o-muzee  is this really true ? 
  from my personal experience - yes . 
  there 's a poll pretty much relevant to your question - http://www.levada.ru/cp/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/doverie_tablitsy.pdf . 
  unfortunately it 's not avaliable in english version so i translated it - http://imgur.com/a/hjw76 ( i should probably post it as another post ) for example it has questions like `` what sources of information do you most trust about news in the country and worldwide ? 
  '' , `` do you trust the information about events in the country , that is distributed by main tv channels ? 
  '' , `` in your opinion , on what topic of society life tv presents most objective information ? 
  '' , `` in your opinion , do country leadership , highest officials always say truth speaking of the situation of economics , public healthcare , pensions , fight against crime and other primary spheres of management ? '',
