  and so on  are normal russians aware of that ? 
  imma post results of some [ levada ] ( http://www.levada.ru/en/ ) polls : 37 % think we are going to dead end 51 % think duma elections in september will be rigged also see that poll above i think that lots of people just do n't really care about history , etc. 
  about putin : he has successfully created the system where he has no competitors so ... 
   gained 20 % of the votes in his run for presidency he gained 4 458 103 ( 6,22 % ) votes in 2012 his party got 56 ( 12.44 % ) seats is this shitpost ? 
  edit : fun fact , that 12.44 = 6.22 * 2, 
  maybe they meant that eurovision subreddit 's map : ^, 
  australia is not in the eu tho, 
  well , wholeheartedly is a little bit exagerration i think ( the question is not about crimea/ukraine , but about putin 's activity in general which includes many other things ) for example most of my acquitances and i just do n't give a fuck about crimea ( it 's not an argument , just anecdotal info ) btw interestingly enough that only putin has such ridiculously huge public support . 
  other official structures are like 50/50 - http://www.levada.ru/indikatory/odobrenie-organov-vlasti/, 
  people support putin because there 're no real competitors unfortunately  wholeheartedly source ? 
   i do n't advocate the genocide of the entire russian nation thanks . 
  tho even if you did : who would have been able to do such a genocide and for what purpose ? 
  sane people do n't watch political/news tv channels anyways , it 's well-known here that they 're of low quality, 
  russia : illegal, 
  well , these are total medals ( summed for each year of olympiad ) . 
  this year you won 2 golds , 1 silver and 1 bronze , 
  ioi is a yearly competition among school students . 
  this year it took place in kazan . 
  each country sends team of 4 people . 
  the olympiad consists of 2 rounds of 5 hours when participants solve problems on competitive programming the official website with more information - http://ioi2016.ru/pages/ioi?locale=en tldr list with countries w/o members http://stats.ioinformatics.org/delegations/2016?sort=medals_desc, 
  very clickbait headline  according to decrees published aug. 1 there will be an extra tourist route through the kremlin including access to a new archaeological museum where visitors can see the remains of the chudov monastery and ascension convent , which were destroyed by the communists in 1929 . 
  public access points are also slated to be installed in the spasskaya tower on red square , which houses the famous kremlin clock , and the borovitskaya tower on the complex 's opposite side . 
  adidas is just a meme, 
  i think it 's all of the above, 
  some pics and videos may be found here - http://auto.vesti.ru/news/show/news_id/662364/ ( you need to scroll a little ), 
   and you dont understand , that for people and nations hurt by russians it doesnt matter if you feel guilty or not . 
  heck , we know you dont . 
  yeah , i admit it was irrelevant here , though it was my answer to `` why ruskies feel soooo innocent now '' so you consider russia = su , it 's arguably ( though right from the position of successor state ) btw , why would you be afraid of russia being a member of nato ? 
  when did i say that ? 
  provide exact citation  were not exclusevely russians this means that nationalities of nkvd/other organizations members were not only russians ( though i 'm sure lots of them were russians due to obvious reason )  i ( for instance ) do n't have any historical guilt / whatever this means that i personally do n't feel guilty for anything that soviet union did in the past ( i.e. 
  it does not mean that ussr did nothing wrong ), 
  and even if it is completely true what has it to do with the post ? 
  if you are speaking of the events from the soviet union history then i ( for instance ) do n't have any historical guilt / whatever  sent to siberia by one russian most of ppl were send to syberia during ** stalin ** who was georgian ( and executers were not exclusevely russians )  ffs , why ruskies feel soooo innocent now ? 
  i do n't get you , are you so triggered because of 2 posts ?

  i finished school in 2013 . 
  yep , i 'm wrong . 
  i recalled enormous causalities but forgot peace treaty conditions . 
   everything is clearly mentioned in our history classes , but with no guilt attached i think it 's same here ( though depends on teacher )  could you give your personal view from what you were taught ? 
  things i am able to remember from school now : * hitler comes to power in 1933 * germany grows stronger * both germany and ussr treated not well in european politics * molotov-ribentropp pact with secret part * huge repressions everywhere ( especially in military ) * poland divided , some countries annexed into ussr * league of nations = weak because of vetos * 1939 winter war against finland lost , ussr kicked from lon * war between ussr and germany is inevitable , but su is n't ready , so the war should be postponed as far as possible * stalin had got lots of messages about upcoming german attack , but somehow did n't take it seriously * 22 june 1941 : germany attacks, 
  i 'm too lazy to translate but probably somebody will do it [ standard 9 grade history book ] ( http://11book.ru/9-klass/212-istoriya/1314-istoriya-rossii-9-klass-danilov-kosulina ) , pages 203 -, 
  inb4 : also , please do n't be hypocrite here . 
  not only ussr was into collaboration with hitler before that .

  blocking what solution ? 
  stepik, 
  briefly speaking of russia i would recommend to take a look at : saint petersburg academical university ( spbau ) higher school of economics , moscow - faculty of computer sciences or if you want something too hardcore - moscow institute of physics and technology , faculty of informational and computing technologies ( fivt ) as far as know all of these have support of some of biggest russian software companies ( e.g. 
  yandex for use and fivt , jetbrains for au , etc. ), 
  also if you choose spb , consider attending computer science club and there 's spb itmo , but idk which department/faculty would be better, 
  xiaomi, 
  xiaomi , according to antutu idk if it represents the whole market tho, 
  we had cursive lessons at school ( 1-4 grades ) , then it was mandatory on some classes ( till 7th grade ) .
