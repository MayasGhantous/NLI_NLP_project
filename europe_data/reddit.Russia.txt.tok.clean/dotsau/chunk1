also death metal , 
  post strongly worded comments on reddit . 
  that will show him !, 
  when i was drawing , i also thought it might be [ a bunny ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cnffuwl.png ) . 
  thank you for your comment , it will help us improve our future invas ... 
  i mean intru ... hey , look , there 's potato right behind you !, 
  my bad , it was meant for [ the picture in the neighbor post ] ( http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/77367000/gif/_77367257_nato_member_countries_624mapv6.gif ), 
  dae think that artillery icon looks like a squirrel and tank icon looks like a rubber duck ? 
  what 's interesting is that out of all russian towns only here in rostov-on-don we use british distance between the rails for trams . 
  which begs for a portals installed on a tram lines between london and rostov . 
  if they are as good as [ danish sausages ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28761463 ) , i 'm afraid i 'm not gon na miss them much . 
  so it 's only me who can see the metro employee badge on this guy , which tell us he is taking the cheese out of the cart and putting it onto the shelves ? 
  a sound statement . 
  said no conspiracy theorist ever . 
  could be . 
  it 's also historical . 
  for some reason , h in the beginning of foreign words and names was replaced with \u0433 in russian . 
  now we tend to stick to how they sound in their native language , more or less . 
  hans christian andersen is \u0413\u0430\u043d\u0441 \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d , but hans christian branner is \u0425\u0430\u043d\u0441 \u041a\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d . 
  except for the names of monarchs : prince george is \u0414\u0436\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0436 now , but he will be \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433 when he ascends the throne . 
  somewhere between g as in ` green ' and h as in ` hotel ' . 
   \u0423\u0440\u044e\u043f\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a ( uryupinsk ) - a real town , even i had to look up its location local to rostov oblast it is the village of \u0413\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e ( gukovo ) , pronounced with glorious southern ' \u0413 ' . 
  it 's where we keep uneducated uncultured rednecks . 
  so that 's why 60 % of my right leg is acting so strange lately !, 
  same thing that happened to sticking to diplomatic norms when there was a rumor about snowden being aboard a presidential plane . 
  / u/darkvadek is putin ? 
  dammit , it was supposed to be a surprise . 
   well , what now russia ? 
  now [ this ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27503017 ) . 
  the sheer number of topics you can squeeze putin into is just amazing . 
   are the itunes charts of any importance in russia ? 
  not really , but they get mentioned now and again . 
  conchita [ was acknowledged ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2014/05/12/itunes/ ) in may 12th article . 
   some looney stuff [ yep ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uflwyoabhkw ), 
  being russian and all , i 'm afraid it 's neither big nor fat . 
  the only people who would be bothered by the ban is a bunch of pensioners and i doubt that most of them will ever hear about it . 
  gay rights bill might stir something , but only if it 's covered in the ` proper ' way . 
  so , without an aid from russian media these fuck yous might as well be said at the bathroom mirror . 
  * looks at italy on the map * no , you need something else . 
  ` we believe putin ', 
  there was n't a nuremberg trial for soviet union regime . 
  and as much as i love me some lithuanian sausages and mantinga bread , russian government is unlikely to follow lithuanian government 's decisions . 
  i know it is banned in lithuania , but that does n't mean it 's banned everywhere else . 
  [ quite the contrary ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_usa ) . 
  i believe it has something to do with that ` freedom of speech ' phenomena . 
  it is allowed because it 's not illegal . 
  and putin was a nobody until 2000 . 
  again , they have been doing it every year . 
  cprf is communist party of russian federation . 
  did i mention they have been doing it every year ? 
  this is cprf . 
  they have been doing it on may 1st every years since 1992 . 
  you would not see this post if ` soviets are coming ! ', 
  was n't a thing in this sub . 
  and we do n't care if you do n't read it !, 
  but are those deep-fried cows ? 
  you mean violate the rights of ethnic russians legally living in estonia ? 
  just perfect . 
  estonia , do as this guy says !, 
  nobody suspected crimea thing , so i think moldova and baltiks are safe for a while . 
  it 's some not obvious country you should be worried about . 
  my bet is on vanuatu . 
  wait , we 've got moldova already ? 
  when did it happen ? 
  come to think of it , i could phrase it better . 
  i merely reflected on the fact that even a neutral article about russia will gather negative comments . 
  sorry for being too meta . 
   you 're trying to make him take a stance , so you can attack him on that . 
  i 've got better things to do than attack someone , even less so who 's opinion i happen to share ( in this thread at least ) . 
  other sentences this specimen produced include  i am proud white conservative european . 
  i belive that our western civilisation is the most advanced civilisation in the world . 
  i am not a racist but i think that we the whites are the most capable race . 
   http://www.reddit.com/r/conservative/comments/20h9tg/something_to_think_about_this_saturday_morning/cg3cxy2 and  which race is more capable , more successful then we the whites ? 
  i can say i respect all the nations . 
  however we have the highest living standard in the world . 
  economically speaking we are the most successful . 
   http://www.reddit.com/r/conservative/comments/20h9tg/something_to_think_about_this_saturday_morning/cg3df36, 
  it does n't have to be about politics , but so far you did n't say anything negative about russia . 
  you are walking on a very slippery slope , my friend . 
  edit : shit , i did n't say anything negative either . 
  enter punishment . 
  * help ukraine to hold elections , ensuring russian-speaking population is properly represented , the sooner the better . 
  once putin ca n't pull illegitimacy ( is that a word ? ), 
  of the new government and threat to russians in ukraine cards , he will have to back off . 
  * nato membership * less antagonization and more open borders . 
  exposure to other cultures works wonders . 
  everything that west engaged so far will hurt ordinary people , but in no way affect the ruling elite . 
  you will have to scrap call of duty , sorry . 
  only viggo mortensen should be allowed to portray russians in movies . 
  * my thinking it 's how much you are content with sensationalism and stereotypes and unwilling to check the facts . 
  remember those double toilets in sochi ? 
  when i posted a [ link ] ( http://nikitskij.livejournal.com/334639.html ) to the article that explains the whole thing i have been told by the person i was replying to that they just do n't want to know . 
  unfortunately , no . 
  example off the top of my head : when everybody was losing their shit over pussy riot and ` gay propaganda ' nonsense , the law has been passed that grants prosecutor 's office the right to any kind of restricted information - doctor/patient , attorney/client , etc. 
  privacy - without a court order . 
  they almost always were granted one , but they still needed to make a formal request and provide case details and a good reason . 
  not anymore , the court case does not even need to exist , they can just peer into anyone 's life just because they feel like it . 
  so far i have n't seen a single mention of this law in western media and only a couple of articles in russian . 
  yes , i think so . 
  yes , i do .
