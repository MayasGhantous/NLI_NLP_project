and what does that have to do with bending history ? 
   maskirovka-wielding chekists what does that even suppose to mean ? 
   for russians , to this very day , wwii , aka great patriotic war , starts in june 1941 . 
  for a reason . 
  most educated russians do separate ww2 and gpw into 2 different time frames . 
  although focus is much more on the latter . 
   considering the data should the news not be `` men live shortest lives in the world '' who warn ? 
  no , because that 's not news . 
  as an outsider , one defining trait of this ( at least ) crisis is that nobody does any real talk and does no coordinated actions . 
  there 's no center , no compromise , only political posturing where one side insists on utopically helping everyone and does n't want to bother even with refugee/migrant checks . 
  and the other side just unilaterally denies any possibility of getting involved , and do we even know the number of people or refugee/population ratio required by quotas ? 
  the numbers i 've seen do n't seem high . 
  personally i 'm getting tired of reading all the empty talk from both sides . 
  the situation would be a lot easier if countries would work as a team , share the burden , with proper asylum and filtering mechanisms installed eu-wide , with focus on border countries . 
  these are ` contract soldiers ' meaning they are professional army and not conscripts . 
  conscripts are not sent to combat zones since the second ( i think ? ), 
  chechen war . 
  why do they refuse to go ? 
  well i guess syria is a lot scarier than eastern ukraine , where they thought they 'd go . 
  let 's just say it 's not wise to repeatedly shout the controversial `` call '' of your already questioned religion while standing on a roof and throwing stuff at someone/something . 
  `` banning '' languages , i 'm pretty sure , means making them unofficial , so government organizations do n't do business using them ( police , courts , schools etc ) . 
  banning religions though ... wat . 
  putin wants that sweet fourth presidential term . 
  hence nationalism , common external `` enemy '' etc etc. 
  what media here is doing feels like keeping the bonfire going with a steady flow of gas . 
  i expect this to continue at least until the elections . 
  i know that , but they still are fighting because of the other guy 's place of birth . 
  unless that other guy is somehow connected ( except with his nationality ) to the violence in the other part of the world . 
  i just do n't get it , what is their thought process ? 
  `` i and that other guy ( probably ) have been living in europe for several years now but now i 'm gon na go fuck him up because of his nationality , i.e. 
  because of his place of birth . '', 
  did i get this right ? 
  i mean wtf is wrong with people . 
  flair checks out , 
  you ca n't be serious . 
  you 're gon na fuck up gulf stream with this . 
  that sounds like a felony ... 
   the regime change was what dragged russia into this . 
  some may argue russia entered on its own . 
  nobody forced or dragged us to spend the past 2 years doing ... well , whatever we were doing . 
  no idea , probably not . 
  some must slip through since i have a chunk of lithuanian cheese in the fridge now . 
  i do n't even live close to border , it was sold on open market :d, 
  excuse me ? 
  you said something ? 
  i 'd like a source please . 
  not trying to disprove you , just educating myself more on this . 
  i consider to move but it pains me because i really want this place to be good . 
  unfortunately i choose the path of less resistance . 
  i thought these were obvious concepts/choices . 
  as a pretty opposition-minded russian even for me the attitude itt is ridiculous . 
   these are russian speaking russians with a lithuanian citizenship . 
  that 's about it . 
  like , wtf is this ? 
  conflict resolution ? 
  still  who/how they can spy on ? 
  grandmas ? 
   note : there is common opinion about orthodox church is spying on citizens - some of clerics hint they work in/for fsb . 
  first time i hear that . 
  can you elaborate ? 
  as someone who visits churches purely for the architecture i have no idea who/how they can spy on . 
  it 's less to do with the muslims and more with proximity to finland and city 's history . 
  just come up to anyone on the street and ask them about gay rights . 
  of course the answer will vary on the place but the common `` vodka-balalaika '' type might just straight punch you in the face . 
   you should look for a country where being gay could lead to prison or death . 
  if average joe was to decide it might very well be that way . 
  you do n't usually fire people left and right because of small mistakes . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2eq225/til_when_bono_was_14_his_mother_died_at_her/ck20dzm but please everybody , continue to shit on the guy just because you 're disagree with his opinion and because of a shitty cartoon meme . 
  makes you look real intelligent . 
  what the hell . 
  this is even worse than switzerland and swaziland being next to each other in lists . 
  well , in russian we never do that , and we always call czechia \u0427\u0435\u0445\u0438\u044f ( not \u0427\u0435\u0447\u043d\u044f ) . 
  these look even less confusing than switzerland and sweden which are n't that confusing too . 
  when i visited czechia i used to try and read the names on the maps , menus etc. 
  and sometimes it literally felt like `` tongue.exe has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down '' . 
  like it should not be possible to pronounce what i just did . 
  weird % ), 
  as someone who does n't follow news , what is the voted agreement about anyway ? 
  every thread in here is about the vote and not the actual thing . 
  are you saying eu standards of living are lower than russian ? 
  what ? 
  well we bomb some shit in syria for some reason . 
  i believe that includes isis ' shit since they are aligned against assad and you know ... are pretty bad in general . 
  i give much less crap about nato than north korea making nuclear tests * close to our border * and isis which we fight for some kind of posturing . 
  the only reason the nato is a `` threat '' to us is to maintain a sense of importance in local patriots and boost politicians ' ratings . 
  that 's the point of my somewhat rhetoric questions . 
  i just do n't know why we act as if it 's 50s . 
  i wish we did n't . 
  all this talk of `` enemies '' , `` security '' , `` threats '' sounds so outdated . 
  edit : actually , i disagree that nato is anti-russian . 
  it was anti warsaw-pact , it does n't have to be anti-russian . 
  elaborate ? 
  what interests , how do they conflict , and how are they a threat to security ? 
   there was plenty of talk of ukraine joining nato for years and that is not acceptable to russian national security . 
  why ? 
  if that tractor thing fails petersburg is my next plan . 
  450 eur as a software developer . 
  oiling my [ \u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 ] ( http://weirdrussia.com/2014/09/05/peter-the-piglet-the-tractor-driver-meme/ ) as we speak . 
  could you link to something other that lifenews ? 
  i 'm not clicking that .
