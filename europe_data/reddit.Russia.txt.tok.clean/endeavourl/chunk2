  i did n't see anyone beating the jumpers in those videos . 
  that 's exactly what i thought it actually was and the reaction on this sub is exactly what i expected . 
  yeah , it was pretty much limited to political movements during wwi and revolutions and the great patriotic war ( the ussr part in wwii ) . 
  i wonder why do i learn about this kind of things now on reddit and not 10 years ago at school ... 
  minimum wage is more like a baseline for fines and state services . 
  more relevant living wage is a bit higher at 10436 rub . 
  ( $ 137 , current rate ) set 30th november 2015 . 
  i feel like in 10 years i 'm going to hike in green alps on my new year vacation wearing t-shirt and shorts . 
   as a gay guy , i 'm always amazed at the extreme levels of tension hanging around in `` straight '' ( or should i say not-aimed-at-gays ? ), 
  bars ; it 's really off-putting . 
  as a not-gay-guy , it 's actually one of the reasons i do n't enjoy bars/clubs . 
  hey , who needs that when you 've got iran , assad and north korea among your friends !, 
  i do n't really know what it was like to live in russia ca . 
  1914 of course . 
  but i 'm of the opinion that the revolution ruined it completely . 
  it destroyed our culture , our way of life and put thugs at the top . 
  you may want to read the pictures ' descriptions . 
  the majority of them that have people were taken in caucasus , asian , or far east regions . 
  well i downvoted , because that pilot knew very well in what time he decided to stay a member of russian armed forces . 
  a time , when we participate in all kinds of aggressive dangerous and unnecessary bullshit all for the glory of the great leader . 
  i 'm not sorry for anyone of russia 's active military personnel atm for that reason . 
  they are an aggression tool for political posturing . 
  well , i do n't really approve of escalations like that but i think the actions made sense . 
  i can feel myself sinking through the chair right now . 
  as a russian , i already feel all the good things that business raids have given me . 
  nato members are allies by definition . 
  i know that much and that makes it irrelevant to the downed plane case . 
  other than that i do n't even care about aegean dispute enough to open a wiki article with that name . 
  why does half of this sub try to use a completely irrelevant case of a country violating disputed airspace of an ally , and apply it to an unidentified plane carrying deadly weapons crossing a recognized border in a war zone that has multiple combat parties ? 
  like , how is that at all applicable ? 
  it 's funny , how fast you people are reduced to the same whataboutism you like to talk about . 
   well , qualified people in russia seems to think so . 
  i 'm sure they know what 's best for russia more than the average redditor . 
  please tell me you are n't serious . 
  upper mid class is a bad example since it 's really quite small . 
   i was gon na say - i love that song dragula , it was in the matrix and on the ost too . 
  exactly what i thought . 
  i listened to those osts like a hundred times when i was 18-20 . 
  to mention the song specifically like that is pretty weird . 
  never go full retard . 
  just the right mix of ignorant radicals and government control . 
  that 's an interesting title . 
  does forbidding people to kill each other also count as basing the law * in part * on religion ? 
  i do n't even know any notable ones . 
  in north caucasus there 's strict control via installed heads of local governments . 
  elsewhere there are probably some disorganized guys here and there that will be brought in check if they cross a line . 
  rise of nationalism and all ( questionable ) benefits it brings . 
  shooting down a civilian plane brings no such benefits ( yet , everything is possible here ... ) also back then separatist `` commanders '' gloated over `` yet another downed military plane '' at vk.com until the real nature of the event became obvious . 
  then they tried to remove everything . 
  i remember it quite well because of the feeling of sick disbelief that someone basically shares their rl `` kill log '' in a social network that i use , and they 're not even isis or some shit like that . 
  apparently lukashenko is a `` brainwashed burger '' since he himself said that he 's `` not europe 's last dictator anymore '' . 
  that 's a great statement . 
  slovenia = no data ? 
  what i personally want to know the most is the cost per launch . 
  the article is not about them though . 
  edit : downvoted for stating a fact ? 
  the article is about execution of a criminal code article that is literally translated as `` insulting feelings of religious people '' . 
  that article was created after the riot 's little `` performance '' . 
  that is why they 're in the title . 
   any russians here to give their side of the story * muh ebil muricans *, 
  as someone who went to school in tatarstan , all lessons are in russian except mandatory tatar language lessons ( similar to mandatory english/german lessons ) . 
  except maybe some private schools or [ \u043c\u04d9\u0434\u0440\u04d9\u0441\u04d9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madrasa ) . 
  what you mean is that i have to buy shitty cheese instead of real cheese now . 
  [ oil prices ate shit and then recovered just as putin entered the scene ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:brent_spot_monthly.svg ) . 
  and continued to rise during his 2 presidential terms . 
   i never said all `` freedom '' is anarchy . 
  then why did you talk about syria ? 
  because that 's exactly their state right now - anarchy . 
   you have quite literally made that word into your brand i did n't make anything into a brand dude , i 'm a simple russian programmer  and for me personally us is n't a shining ideal of freedom/democracy . 
  freedom ! = anarchy . 
  why do you people always devolve into talking about `` bad muricans ? '', 
  ca n't you keep it more local and to the point ? 
  idk , head of president 's administration of my country being a pseudo-scientist is pretty newsworthy for me . 
  happens regularly . 
  what 's worse is that often it coincides with a period of dry weather so it constantly stays very hot and air gets dusty , hard to breathe hard to do anything during the day really . 
  i 'm not looking forward to summers since [ 2010 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_northern_hemisphere_summer_heat_waves#russia ) anymore . 
  climate change is quite real for me . 
  meanwhile here in central russia i 'm cursing myself for not installing air conditioning off-season when it was cheap . 
  temps have been at 30-35 c for 2 + weeks . 
  sick reference . 
   the same motivation behind muslim refugees swarming in from 3rd world nations with a medieval culture . 
  [ citation needed ], 
  except irradiated fuel is much more radioactive than ore . 
   why ? 
  many grazing animals have pupils like that . 
  and they all look creepy for some reason . 
  vertical ones are fine , probably because cats . 
   ukraine has a lower gdp per capita than sudan do you even fact check bro ? 
  http://www.tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/indicators http://www.tradingeconomics.com/sudan/indicators, 
  trains to central europe are actually just as expensive as plane tickets . 
  i once wanted to take moscow - basel train , it probably would 've been interesting to see all the transitions going east to west . 
  but after thinking of spending 2 + days of my vacation in a compartment for the price of just 3.5 h flight to zurich i reconsidered . 
  or rather , it replaces the more expensive fat by less expensive . 
  cheese is 25-50 % fat . 
  what exactly is unhealthy about mixing cheese ( milk ) fats with palm oil ? 
   does this guy even do basic research ? 
  of course , look at all the sources he cited !, 
  what exactly is unhealthy about palm oil ? 
  i like how he pointedly says `` artificial sugars , '' as if there 's a difference between `` artificial '' and `` natural '' fructose , glucose , sucrose etc. 
  me too thanks,
