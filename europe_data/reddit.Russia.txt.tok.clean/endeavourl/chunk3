   i disregard navalny because he did n't do anything constructive like all the \u0424\u0411\u041a , \u0420\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u043b , \u0420\u043e\u0441\u044f\u043c\u0430 etc stuff ? 
  good for you m8 . 
  / r/iamverysmart is that way . 
  i too care and think every hour of every day about atrocities committed against russia hundreds of years ago . 
  oh wait , no , i actually have a brain and prefer to focus on current problems . 
  do n't forget gay nazi jews , they 're behind everything . 
  to everyone in this subthread : you know , this shit flinging competition would be at least mildly interesting if there were less shit and more sources cited . 
  yet switzerland keeps rejecting more and more universal basic income proposals . 
  swiss population seems a lot more accustomed and educated with their referendums though . 
  it feels somewhat like a circle : you need politically educated population to give it more power through referendums , but for it to have that education there needs to be more involvement in the first place . 
   almost all 5/9 , a bit more than a half . 
  not in this case i think . 
  my parents needed to renounce their ex-soviet republic 's passport and apply for russian one late in the 90s when they decided to live in russia for family reasons . 
  they were still using their old ussr passports ( that were somehow still valid at that time ) and at the end of simplified but hellishly bureaucratic procedure an official citizenship blank was attached to those passports and the ones issued in their former republic ( now separate country ) were rejected by them . 
  couple years after that soviet passports finally were phased out and my parents got new russian ones . 
  pretty crazy story , i might 've lost some details since i was a kid at the time . 
  so the guy from the article might have a now invalid soviet passport and no citizenship since he did n't apply in russia and did n't accept kazakh citizenship . 
  brb buying a proper suit for that meeting, 
   beeing openly instructed from us embassy did n't help , too . 
  what exactly are you talking about ? 
  anything other than a video of people entering an exiting a building ? 
  also , how much is it for a reddit comment these days ? 
  asking for a friend . 
  yeah , the title sounded really important but just looking at the map there seems to be at least two other large baltic ports in poland . 
  count [ zurich ] ( https://cdn.zuerich.com/sites/default/files/styles/box_teaser/public/web_zurich_tt_hub_keyvisual_1600x900.jpg ) in . 
  is this homeopathic radioactive iodine ? 
  i do n't get why people are always surprised by the trashbags - i mean when buying them you 're basically paying people to collect and utilize/recycle your junk . 
  in russia i pay a similar ( smaller , ofc . ), 
  fee as part of my services ( water , electricity etc ) bill . 
   and i 'm not even counting the very simple basic fact , yes corruption is real , and a lot of salaries , if you 're talking metallurgy , are not '' \u0431\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0440\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 '' . 
  if you take any government worker , or which there are a loooot , genuinely they drive country 's average down hard , than lol , you get people with official salaries of 12-15k rubbles driving around in mercedes ' yeah , we all know about this , but for the record in my comment i was talking about people making 20k ish/month total , whether `` white '' or `` gray '' or whatever . 
  that 's * ridiculous * , even for somebody like a cashier or a janitor . 
   rubbles nice meme , 
  cost of living is quite/very low compared to us and europe but the quality of products and services is also worse , especially after rub crash and embargo ( self-imposed , too !, 
  i 'm so mad about this ) made many imports either unavailable or crazy expensive even for me . 
  medicine may be a good example : it 's supposed to be similar to some european countries , we have mandatory tax-funded insurance but good luck relying on it , you 'll either end up paying bribes in state hospitals or jump straight to paying to private ones . 
  average rent is around 9-12k / month so $ 150ish , add like 4-6k ( $ 80 ) for services like water , electricity etc , then transportation , food ... yeah . 
  it 's pretty bad for people with lower income , they probably live with flatmates or with parents , and have to count every ruble and probably do n't have anything at the end of the month to put into savings or just have some fun . 
  so yeah , even extra 12 euro might be a luxury for some . 
  well , it 's a small-er city with a single major enterprise that employs half or third of the population , and it was n't doing well for the last ... 20 + years ? 
  pretty typical really . 
  so people either get lucky like i did , try to gain connections to climb the hierarchy , or simply * endure * surviving with their shit salary . 
  certainly not a lot in st. petersburg , but it 's a considerable amount for many . 
  like , i live closer to urals and many of my friends still have salaries in the 20k/month area , which is kinda shocking and makes me appreciate my it job which nets me several times that . 
  as a russian with a russia flair , i have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  in fact , both you and the guy you 're replying to are upvoted . 
  `` peaceful transition of power '' hype ? 
  anyone ? 
  oh , you guys are boring !, 
  in my city those metal detectors largely popped up after we started doing shit in syria and rumours and news began about terror acts being prepared as retaliation . 
  it 's a huge and useless security theater . 
  most of them are either turned off or simply ignored . 
  security guys overseeing them just stand around doing nothing all day . 
  i love how often irrelevant history is being brought up in discussions about modern politics . 
  go ahead and mention lzhedmitry and battle of neva too if you want to pile some old-ass events onto this discussion . 
  err ... actual examples where we were ( unjustly ) rejected by west ? 
  wrong ? 
  that comment is just a straight up list of facts . 
  i am actually speechless . 
   so you advocate for sexual assault on new year 's eve ? 
  the world is not black and white , you know , and so are people 's thoughts and words . 
  the a/c hell in background somehow completes the picture . 
  i wish i had something like this in school to dilute endless lists of dates and names that you have to know by heart by next monday , * or else * ... you can see that history was n't my favourite class . 
  you claim this particular video to be propaganda . 
  can you say why ? 
  [ very lookalike ] ( http://cs8.pikabu.ru/post_img/2016/02/25/7/1456400731117419394.jpg ) i agree . 
  2 ] ( https://youtu.be/jpcw94wxxmk?t=10m1s ), 
   for me , schengen visa usually adds about 10 % to the cost . 
  not that big of a deal , but it 's still not a negligible sum of money . 
  the process of applying for a visa also wastes time ( especially for people outside big cities in which you can apply ) and ensures that i ca n't just spontaneously decide to buy airplane tickets for the next weekend . 
  exactly , it does n't cost * that * much but it 's such a pain in the ass to get all the papers right and submit them ( although the last time i got swiss visa i submitted them via dhl which was a huge improvement for me , living in a mid-size city with no visa centers/embassies ) . 
  current * russia has nothing to admire . 
  there , fixed . 
  and the floor is slippery and a 10yo boy can fit through the hole ... 
   and it is really like eating rubber mostly sour acidic rubber too . 
  send ~ ~ help ~ ~ cheese . 
  the law sends the message . 
  the message is that gays are unwelcome and offences against them wo n't be persecuted nearly as strongly as , say , `` offences '' against `` feelings of religious '' and shit like that . 
  can confirm mena migrants peed in my coffee this morning . 
  never mind `` gay hunting '' groups popping up since then . 
  why are you still here ? 
  you 've got parties to imprison !, 
  i suggest starting in france . 
  i 've got a list for your crusade buddy . 
  you can even start somewhere close . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_communist_parties#modern_.28non-ruling.29 how dumb are you , exactly ? 
  fyi ussr was a farce , not communism . 
  failures of ussr do n't have much to do with the utopian idea of communism . 
   you lot and the brits let hitler  you let  you let  you ... sat there and did fuck all  you both guaranteed poland and did fuck all  why are you speaking directly to a person/people like this about an event in which they or any of their peers had absolutely no involvement ? 
  ritual sudoku when ? 
   you lot why are you speaking directly to a person like this about an event in which they or any of their peers had absolutely no involvement ? 
  chill ? 
  i think we need / r/finalsolutionstomigrantcrisis for shit like that at this point / o \\, 
  i wonder what authorities of libyan ports think of a prospect of thousands random people being dumped on their territory ... stop trying to make up simple solutions , they do not exist here .

   their professional opinion is that it 's shit have they broken it ? 
  after all there 's prize money for that and everything is open source .

  no , not really , less hassle for us .
