you would have to live with them in one country anyway . 
  millions of people from caucasian countries came to russia after 1991 . 
   since the conflict the place has been run by the same strongman with ties to putin . 
  it was ruled by ahmad kadyrov in 2000-2004 and then by his son ramzan when ahmad kadyrov was killed . 
  the rest is correct . 
  the article is about partisans in 1944-1953 , there was no resistance in 1940 . 
  formally it was voluntary accession , not an occupation . 
  if it was an occupation , why did n't you fight against ussr like finland did ? 
  brutal occupation by ussr returned your capital , without it lithuania would be much smaller now , do n't forget about it . 
  i could find only links in russian that say that university teachers including kant submitted to russia after the leading burghers . 
  also in 1758 he wrote a [ letter ] ( http://www.runivers.ru/doc/d2.php?center_element_id=147333&amp;portal_id=7455&amp;section_id=6778 ) ( text in russian ) to russian empress elizabeth where he called himself russian subject . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%b6nigsberg#russian_empire ), 
  he was russian citizen in 1758-1762 when east prussia was a part of the russian empire . 
  they are real patriots , they send their children to the west in order to make it decay from within . 
  hard to say , medvedev is considered to be more liberal than putin , but he is also weak , nobody was taking him seriously when he was a president . 
  i edit my previous answer . 
  even [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sergey_mironov ) says that * mironov has several times proposed an amendment to the russian constitution that would allow the president to be elected for 3 consecutive 5 or 7 year terms . 
  * and also * mironov was a candidate in the 2004 presidential election . 
  he was not considered to be a serious candidate and was quoted as saying : `` we all want vladimir putin to be the next president . 
  '' * if putin dies tomorrow , no doubt that the united russia will remain the ruling party . 
  they will choose who will be their candidate on the next elections . 
  it can be medvedev , shoigu , volodin or maybe someone else . 
  then russian tv will do its job and that candidate will win for sure . 
  i remember how putin suddenly appeared in 1999 when yeltsin said `` welcome my successor '' . 
  everyone was laughing : `` this small frightened unknown man will be our next president ? 
  no way '' . 
  but then tv made him look like a superhero and he was elected . 
  progress was not admitted , so we ca n't measure its support . 
  one of the few decent parties , of course , they were not admitted to the elections . 
  you must be kidding , the leader of the `` just russia '' is putin 's lackey . 
  many times he proposed to change constitution by removing presidential terms limit in order to let putin stay in power as long as he wants . 
  there are no decent parties in russian parliament , all parties support putin , even so called `` communists '' . 
  i told putin that you ca n't stop thinking about him . 
  your own link says that it was named for the battle of stalingrad , not for the stalin . 
  my words are full of bitter irony . 
  you are probably confusing him with someone else . 
  orthodox christians would n't paint [ icon with stalin ] ( http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/sikariy/30710952/5909/5909_640.jpg ) if he ever did something like that , would they ? 
  how do you dare to say that . 
  do n't you know that stalin studied to be a priest ? 
  yes , that 's she . 
  everyone knows her in russia . 
  it is not an insult , i just want to know if it is free of charge now or not . 
  it is definitely none of our business , we should respect right of belarus and other countries to practice death penalty . 
  does poland pay for passing through russian waters now ? 
  there putin 's profile in the bottom , it has the following text :  president of russia , after constitutional changes allowed him to run again , 2012-present it is wrong , there were constitutional changes extending presidential term to 6 from 4 years and that 's it . 
  he was n't allowed to run more than 2 terms in a row , that 's why he used medvedev to hold the seat for him . 
   people just had less money and less purchasing power than now not everywhere . 
  in moldova , armenia , georgia , most central asian countries life was much better than now . 
  it is very hard for me to believe that people from poland were sent to exile to siberia after wwii . 
  as far as i know they were exchanged later . 
  for example , their commander shown at 0:45 was released after 4 months of captivity . 
  in [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/w1pp9ldu12y?t=33s ) ( 0:33 ) he is giving an interview to ukrainian tv channel . 
  you are right , he said `` cyka tvari blyat '' . 
  `` tvari '' means `` beasts '' . 
  it was someone 's joke , not a typo . 
  the classic keul\u0117 taste . 
   you think russia would be hurting from the oil price drop so badly if they had unrestricted access to foreign credit markets ? 
  i do . 
  low oil price is the real problem , sanctions are much less important . 
  i guess next soul there will be ussian . 
  annexation is the political transition of land from the control of one entity to another . 
  abkhazia is not part of russia , so `` annexation '' is wrong term in this case . 
  what country did annex abkhazia in your universe ? 
  right , abkhazia is annexed by abkhazia . 
  i can recommend you [ an article ] ( http://www.ecfr.eu/article/essay_abkhazia_russias_tight_embrace ) worth reading about abkhazia . 
  tldr : abkhazia maintains a relatively high degree of independence in its domestic politics . 
   abkhazia on the other hand lies in russia . 
  yes , independence means independence , that 's why independent kosovo and independent albania can unite if they wish . 
  if kosovo is not allowed to do it , then it is not an independent country . 
  it is getting better . 
  the latest number is 15.4 . 
  it used to be 40 in the 1990s . 
  is is very sad that most of news where russia is appears as cruel dumb police state are actually correct . 
  i could n't find what he said exactly . 
  he was arrested on the 27th of may , 2016 and released under recognisance not to leave later that day . 
  he believes he was arrested because of his political views and his comment was just a formal occasion . 
  [ he looks ] ( http://paperpaper.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/fnuq48gfwvo.jpg ) like a neonazi . 
  omg , you are completely insane . 
   the degree of violence is far lower than before serbia was doing exactly the same what russia was doing in chechnya . 
  level of violence in chechnya is very low now . 
  i think that situation would be calm by now if nato would n't invade serbia . 
  nato 's invasion to serbia was illegal . 
  it was west who changed the borders in europe by force after wwii , russia simply repeated it . 
  of course , russian invasion was illegal too . 
  but there were no other ways to organize referendum in crimea . 
  ukraine would n't let it happen , they would arrest all activists , it 's not gb and scotland . 
   provide a quote or paragraph which you were referring to . 
  * this report focuses on the wave of arson and looting of serb and roma homes throughout kosovo that has ensued and on the harassment and intimidation , including severe beatings , to which remaining serbs and roma have been subjected . 
  most seriously , there has been a spate of abductions and murders of serbs since mid-june , including the massacre of fourteen serb farmers on july 23 . 
  *  does it state which languages have to be official languages ? 
  russian was ** regional ** language in ukraine . 
  do you understand the difference between ** regional ** and ** official ** languages ? 
  charter for regional or minority languages in ukraine does not specify languages by name , but rather ratifies on behalf of `` the languages of the following ethnic minorities of ukraine '' . 
  russians are listed as minorities . 
   polls are not really equal to a referendum and legality is not decided by any poll . 
  polls prove that the idea of joining russia existed and was very popular long before 2014 . 
   how comfortable . 
  russia is the extremist organization here , not the mejlis . 
   most local serbs live near the serbian border , not really under any control of the kosovar government .
