   very good , why should it be ? 
  have n't you ever heard of the [ european charter for regional or minority languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_charter_for_regional_or_minority_languages ) ? 
   plus , no wonder it became extremely popular after the russian invasion . 
  [ it was always popular ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014#polling ) . 
   closed their assembly mejlis was banned for a good reason , extremist organizations are not welcome in russia . 
  most of non-albanians were expulsed from kosovo after it became independent . 
  it is pretty clear that idea of nato intervention was not to stop ethnic cleansings but to punish serbia . 
  soon after the revolution ukrainian parliament voted to cancel the law on state language policy which meant that russian wo n't be regional language in crimea anymore . 
  people of crimea were not very happy about it , they realized that soon they will be in position of russians in estonia - people of 2nd sort . 
  no wonder that idea to join russia became extremely popular . 
  as for the crimean tatars , their situation at least did n't got worse : their language was not officially recognized , not it is . 
  even if you think that this is just a formality , in ukraine they were not allowed to have it . 
  albanians in kosovo also had albania next to them , but it turned out that it was fine to declare independence of kosovo instead of moving to albania . 
  the same here . 
  israel also sells to azerbaijan . 
  i would like to add that russia sells weapons to azerbaijan because otherwise they will buy from someone else . 
  armenia gets weapons for free to maintain status quo . 
  and this is my personal attitude to this conflict : i think that nagorno karabakh should be armenian because armenians are and were majority there , plus armenia won the war . 
  the problem is that armenia and karabakh do n't have common border , [ see map ] ( http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/files/2016/04/nkarabakh-map.jpg ) . 
  actually small part of karabakh is controlled by azerbaijan and not shown at this map . 
  armenia currently occupies not only karabakh but also significant part of azerbaijan . 
  i believe armenia should keep lachin corridor and karabakh and return other occupied areas . 
  azerbaijan should keep his part of karabakh as a compensation for lachin corridor . 
  the most native population in crimea are crimean greeks . 
  some of them still live there . 
  but some parts of crimea belonged to kievan rus long before tatars appeared there , see [ tmutarakan principality ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a2%d0%bc%d1%83%d1%82%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%bd%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b5_%d0%ba%d0%bd%d1%8f%d0%b6%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%be ) - there 's no english version , unfortunately . 
  it was choice of crimean people to reunite with russia . 
  after the referendum parliament of crimea declared independence and requested the russian government to admit it into russia . 
  russia did n't annex it , it just let crimea in . 
  a thousand years ago [ russians already lived ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/50cy29/map_of_europe_in_1000ad_1640_x_1244/ ) in current eastern estonia . 
  yuryev ( current tartu ) was founded by the russian yaroslav i the wise . 
  crimean tatars settled in crimea less than 600 years ago . 
  and now they are indigenous people in crimea , but russians are occupants in crimea . 
  good example of double standards . 
  funny to hear it from someone from a country where national minorities are treated as `` occupants '' . 
   it 's just a step closer to destroying yet another culture . 
  it is a step to protect crimean tatars ' culture . 
  one example : republic of crimea has 3 official languages now , crimean tatar is one of them . 
  it was n't official when crimea was ukrainian . 
  it does n't make any sense because according to ukrainian law all ukraine must take part in referendum , not only crimea . 
  it is obvious that even all people of crimea will vote to leave , the final result will be `` remain '' . 
  it was a gift to brothers when 300 years of reunification russia and ukraine was celebrated . 
  republics in ussr had no real power , everything was dictated from moscow . 
  those gpd rises and falls are caused mostly by oil price , sanctions are much less important . 
  this video is about a man who criticized kadyrov , not putin . 
  let 's compare amounts produced in decade : 907,3 mln tons was produced in 1982-1991 , 893,6 mln tons was produced in 2006-2015 . 
  116.7 million tons of grain was produced in russia in 1990 [ proof ] ( http://www.gks.ru/bgd/regl/b11_38/isswww.exe/stg/04-07.htm ) . 
  104.8 million tons of grain was produced in russia in 2015 according to your `` fact checking '' link . 
  116.7 is more than 104.8 , it makes me think that i was correct when i sad that grain production in russia decreased , not increased . 
  also it makes clear that the one spreading lie here is you . 
  i meant [ grain ] ( http://history-russia.livejournal.com/160831.html ), 
  do you mean transnistria and gagauzia ? 
  i do n't think that gagauzia is breakaway . 
  it is not an achievement at all , it is a degradation actually . 
  russia 25 years ago ( not ussr ! ), 
  produced more grain than russia now . 
  it had to import because there was a lot of cattle , and cattle consumes a lot of grain . 
  now russia imports more meat , but exports grain . 
  [ edit reason : replaced `` wheat '' by `` grain '' ] . 
  you are correct , but it happened in 20th century . 
  i think he was n't talking about himself personally . 
  is is sarcasm ? 
  i ca n't believe that you do think that the last 25 years was a great time for ukraine . 
  i do n't think that serbia will join eu before kosovo . 
  i expect that croatia will block it . 
  it does n't matter if kosovo distances from albania or not . 
  if we recognize it as an independent country , then we automatically recognize it 's right to host any troops , join any alliance or even unite with any other country . 
  albanians in kosovo also had albania . 
  does it mean that they had no right to tear up serbia 's land ? 
  belarus suffered even heavier than poland . 
  it lost 25 % of the population . 
  why do you think that you were at the level of ghana ? 
  [ romania was much better than ghana ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:rus:ind:gbr&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_kd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:rom:gha&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=650224800000&amp;tend=1407607200000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) . 
  * god works in mysterious ways *, 
  only russia . 
  do you know how the problem in this video was `` fixed '' in russia in 90s ? 
  market prices were set and you could buy anything you wanted without any queues . 
  but the problem was that too many people could not afford it . 
  for example , it resulted in huge drop of meat consumption per capita . 
  if you compare modern russia with russia in 1991 , you will see that economy is approximately the same as it was 25 years ago . 
  we have the same volumes of housing built every year , the same number of air passengers , etc. 
  there was no progress during last 25 years . 
  the distance between russia and developed world is only growing , although we had ten years of incredibly high oil prices . 
  that explains why many russians have fond memories of the ussr , not because they are `` dumbasses '' as you said . 
  no wonder . 
  the ussr was [ the 26th by hdi in 1990 ] ( http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/219/hdr_1990_en_complete_nostats.pdf ) ( page 121 ) , in 2015 [ former ussr would be only 71st ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/3s5mix/if_ussr_was_reunited_in_2015_oc_1500x844/ ) . 
  russian here . 
  putin was really unknown at that time . 
  finland was forced to fight against hitler , it was n't finland 's goodwill . 
  looks like you do n't understand what does the term `` public holiday '' mean . 
  red army ceased to exist in 1946 . 
  it is wrong . 
  [ proof for macedonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_holidays_in_macedonia ) , [ proof for moldova ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_holidays_in_moldova ), 
  it is n't public holiday - [ proof ] ( https://mk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%94%d1%80%d0%b6%d0%b0%d0%b2%d0%bd%d0%b8_%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b7%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%86%d0%b8_%d0%b2%d0%be_%d0%9c%d0%b0%d0%ba%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%98%d0%b0 ), 
  it is n't public holiday in moldova and macedonia . 
  correct , they wanted the same status as russia or ukraine , but did n't get it . 
  we both know that it would never happen . 
  ukraine would never let crimea go even if russia would pay entire ukraine 's external debt . 
  you are absolutely correct !, 
  they voted to become a ** separate ** republic , but became only ** autonomous ** republic .
