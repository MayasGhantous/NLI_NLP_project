  ukraine does n't supply crimea with electricity since 2015 . 
  that happened because of the oil prices , not because of crimea sanctions . 
  the same in russia . 
  cyprus is in asia too , so i guess that 's not the main reason . 
  are n't [ what ? 
  where ? 
  when ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/what%3f_where%3f_when%3f ) and [ kvn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kvn ) original content as well ? 
  russian black-yellow-white flag was used only in 1858 -- 1883 . 
  for those who downvote it : moldova was never independent before 1991 , so it * gained * its independence , not * regained * . 
  it is simply wrong to talk about separate trajectories for over 750 years . 
  kiev , eastern ukraine and eastern belarus became one state with russia in 1667 under the terms of the [ truce of andrusovo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/truce_of_andrusovo ) after being disintegrated for 400 years . 
  the war in europe ended not on 8th of may but several days later . 
  til moldova * regained * its independence . 
  no comment on the ** baltic state ** from you ? 
  yes , i updated my comment . 
  you wrote that it is to remember the end of nazism and ** the end of ww2 ** , i guess the second part does n't make sense . 
  but ww2 ended in september , not in may . 
  very impressive , the fastest investigation ever . 
  tajiks are not turkic , they are persians . 
  and they are very close to iran . 
   it 's kievan rus its contemporary term , back then its name was just rus . 
  not at all . 
  unlike russia , previous elections in ukraine were within internationally recognized democratic standards . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the new elections would be fair and transparent too . 
  actually new elections were supposed to be held the same year according to the [ agreement on settlement of political crisis in ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agreement_on_settlement_of_political_crisis_in_ukraine ) . 
  but protestants demanded immediate yanukovych 's resignation and refused to fulfill the agreement . 
  they are not gone , they mixed with tatars . 
  in 1952 the ussr proposed to unify germany as a neutral state but the western allied governments refused this initiative , otherwise it would be similar to austria . 
  no wonder the ussr was against unified germany that would become part of nato , although everyone understood that the german separation was not right thing . 
  what mental process in your brain turns * crimea as part of ukraine * into * independence * ? 
  [ ballot ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/2014_crimean_referendum_ballot.png ) . 
  choice 1 : do you support the reunification of crimea with russia with all the rights of the federal subject of the russian federation ? 
  choice 2 : do you support the restoration of the constitution of the republic of crimea in 1992 and the status of the crimea as part of ukraine ? 
   it even managed to break an agreement with ukraine to protect ukrainian soveregnity in exchange for ukraine disposing of nukes . 
  it was not obligatory , that memorandum was never ratified . 
   russia is in deep recession and will stay there for a long time while the world leaps forward . 
  sorry for disappointing you , but according to this [ forecast ] ( http://country.eiu.com/russia ) russia returns to growth this year . 
   russia does n't even hide the fact it supports fascist , nazist , separatist etc movements all over the world . 
  if such movements are really fascist or nazist , why police does n't arrest its members ? 
  if they are legal , then what 's wrong in supporting it ? 
  the west funded numerous ngos in russia in order to influence russian society . 
  i suspect that such movements are not fascist at all . 
  looks like you just use this word to call people whose opinion differs from yours . 
   say honestly : if russia were to just disappear from the globe completely , like it was n't there , would the world become a better or a worse place ? 
  what good does russia bring to the table ? 
  the world would become a better place for our enemies and a worse place for our allies . 
  i ask you the same question about your country . 
   you have n't given me reason to suspect you of racism or antisemitism that 's probably because you had n't tell me where you are from . 
   ... every single bullet point in https://ratical.org/ratville/cah/fasci14chars.html and http://www.openculture.com/2016/11/umberto-eco-makes-a-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html first link , item 5 : * opposition to abortion is high * - does n't apply to russia , abortion is legal and free of charge . 
  second link , item 11 : * everybody is educated to become a hero * - i was n't educated to become a hero . 
  russia is not a fascist state . 
  your move . 
  looks you an expert in fascism . 
  could you please tell me if the ussr was a fascist state ? 
  is israel a fascist state now ? 
  other regions has less share of ukrainians , so yes , it is the most ukrainian . 
  also it is the only region where ukrainian language is official . 
  russia managed to legally and peacefully get crimea back and it will get away with it , sanctions will be lifted sooner or later . 
  your butthurt tells me that you realize your own helpless when all you can do is whine and insult someone on the internet while the country that you hate so much grows bigger and gets stronger . 
  will you call me a fascist again ? 
  or maybe this time you will call me a nazi ? 
  btw , what country are you from ? 
  i need to know that to insult you properly . 
  but not for everyone . 
  existence of non-citizens is a shame for a country . 
  as a conclusion :  but those who lived here after the collapse of soviet union were offered citizenship without any exams . 
  false confirmed . 
  so if you are non-ethnic estonian in 1992 and you missed chance to register in some unofficial committee , you have to pass language test . 
  some really got citizenship without tests , but majority did n't . 
  compare it with other countries , for example , with lithuania , which gave citizenship too all people without any exams . 
  let 's get back to our imaginary situation where russia returns territory to estonia . 
  now i 'm as an expert in estonian law ( thanks to you ) can say that people in that area most likely do n't have ancestors that were citizens on estonia before 1940 . 
  they did n't register in estonian citizens ' committee movement , that 's why they will have to pass language tests . 
  so they will become second-class people in estonia for decades , just like non-estonians that lived there in 1991 . 
   ussr was already dead , and its constitution allowed republics to leave . 
  if ukraine 's constitution does n't allow autonomic republic to leave , then its only ukraine 's problem . 
   kosovo faced what could be called a genocide by a tyrant dictator . 
  ato ( anti-terrorist operation ) would be better name . 
  also `` tyrant dictator '' was overthrown and 8 years later kosovo , while being protected by foreign military units , still felt insecure so that they had to declare independence . 
  i 'm sure even you do n't believe this bullshit . 
   nothing remotely similar to that happened in ukraine really ? 
  i think something pretty similar happened in donbas . 
  no doubt the same would happen in crimea too in case it had n't rejoin russia . 
   so you oppose the nuremberg trials verdicts and justify nazism . 
  these are two questions combined . 
  do you really think that such a chip gimmick can confuse me ? 
  i do n't justify nazism . 
  at the same time i think that the nuremberg trials verdict contains pure hypocrisy . 
   no doubt how they would vote if an actual opportunity appeared . 
  you must be out of your mind . 
  kaliningrad and kuril islands are full of brainwashed vatniks . 
  they would never vote to leave . 
  but i do n't mind if you go ahead and try to organize referendums there . 
   ... justify nazism . 
  is n't that a crime in russia ? 
   russia , being a fascist dictatorship these two contradict each other , choose one please . 
   in 1992 many russians , especially those who have been living here for many generations , did not have to pass a language test . 
  those who were citizens in 1940 and their descendants ? 
  previously you said that virtually anyone living in estonia could get a citizenship without exams if he or she wished .
