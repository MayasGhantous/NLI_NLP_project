   i could give you source for this but i doubt you speak estonian . 
  give it please . 
  russia should pay , but only after latvia pays for damage caused by the [ red latvian riflemen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvian_riflemen#red_latvian_riflemen ) . 
   `` naturalisation '' does not mean that the applicant is required to do exams . 
  well , open estonian law on naturalisation and see that language exams is a must . 
   tens of thousands russian estonians who do n't speak a word in estonian . 
  i do n't know , maybe they do speak but pretend that they do n't ? 
   of course they ca n't decide on which country crimea belongs to . 
  that would n't make sense . 
  ukraine can decide that it is no longer belong to ussr , kosovo can decide , why ca n't crimea ? 
  speaking that ukraine built ukraine is ridiculous . 
  if i follow your logic , i can say that ussr built ukraine . 
   care to explain why you approve of hitler annexing austria ? 
  yes , i do . 
  because majority of people in austria supported this . 
  thanks for the links . 
  i opened second one and it says : * in 1992 , the 1938 citizenship act was re-adopted , which politically ` contained ' the soviet-era settlers by granting automatic citizenship almost exclusively to those who were citizens in 1940 ( before the soviet takeover ) and their descendants . 
  as a result , about one third of estonia 's population ( mostly ethnic russians and other russian-speaking minorities ) became ( de facto ) stateless , or in estonian official terms , ` individuals with undefined citizenship ' . 
  1 to become estonian citizens they had to take the path of naturalisation . 
  * see , there was no option for estonian citienship without exams . 
  i mean letting crimeans decide on their own . 
   they were immidiately given an option to either get an estonian citienship without exams do you have a source for that ? 
  why did 30 % of people became non-citizens in 1992 ? 
  it was you who started to talk about returning stolen lands . 
  i do n't think locals will be very happy to become second-class people even in a wealthier country . 
  in 1990 all people were allowed to elect the supreme council , which restored independence . 
  but then 30 % of estonia population were deprived of suffrage according to that law passed in 1992 . 
  all members of riigikogu elected in 1992 were ethnic estonians . 
  nice job , even hitler himself would be proud of you . 
  false , estonia and latvia were two countries of 15 that did n't gave citizenship for all population in 1991 . 
  can people currently living there receive citizenship of a `` normal country '' without exams ? 
  kosovo showed us that moving to russia , if you do n't want to live in ukraine anymore , is not the only option . 
  everyone blames damn communists but no one wishes to give back their gifts . 
  as non-citizens , right ? 
  there 's no point to spend money on it , ukraine will never accept it . 
   i think that 's what they do at the moment , right ? 
  almost all oblasts in russia are named after their capitals , there are only three exceptions , two of them appeared when leningrad and sverdlovsk got back historical names but their oblasts did not . 
  do you really think that despotic monarchist names are better than communist ones ? 
  i 'm fond of current names . 
  it was kingsepp for more than 90 years , it is already historical name now . 
  til , i knew that kingisepp is somewhere in leningrad oblast , but i thought it was a finnish town that kept its original name . 
  i think that leningrad oblast was not renamed because st. petersburg oblast would be very long in russian : '' \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0436\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c '' , current '' \u041b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c '' is much better . 
  the same applies to yekaterinburg . 
  city was renamed but oblast remained sverdlovskaya . 
  i find it kind of symbolic that in these cases both soviet and original names were kept . 
  i like that , we should n't automatically erase 70 years of our past , because there were good things too . 
  actually i think that no cities , streets , rivers etc. 
  should be ever renamed . 
  and what communists did was wrong . 
  but we should n't make the same errors now , we should stop . 
  if anything was already renamed - keep it , but no more renamings . 
  if new regime desires to have something named after it , no problem - go ahead built something new and name it . 
  sorry , i meant / r/ukraina . 
  i edited my message . 
  / r/europe is actually very decent place compared to / r/ukraina . 
  when something terrible happens in russia , for example , another plane is crashed , i go there to find consolation that at least it made someone so happy . 
  today yes , but in couple decades anti-missile shield may become huge problem for russia . 
  general russian public opinion is that almost everyone in the world would like to see weak and starving russia , preferably in civil war . 
  then the west will attack and crash us , just like it destroyed yugoslavia , iraq , libya , afghanistan , syria . 
  the reason for attack can be `` protecting nuclear weapons '' or something like that . 
  assad may be genocidal indeed , but the problem is that alternatives are even worse . 
  yes , please take away football championship , it 's such a huge waste of money . 
  lithuania got back klaip\u0117da region in 1948 , as far as i know , there were no other border changes . 
  i do n't think that germany would claim klaip\u0117da region in case lithuania restored independence by declaring the soviet rule null . 
  no , vilnius was returned to lithuania in 1939 . 
  it became part of the ussr in 1940 . 
  why did n't they invest in eastern poland ? 
  asia/europe means `` both in asia and europe '' , not `` up to you whether its asia or europe '' . 
  do you have any source that includes entire georgia to europe ? 
  yes , just like georgia . 
  batumi is 15 km from the asian part of turkey , of course . 
  georgia is almost entirely in [ asia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/europe_polar_stereographic_caucasus_urals_boundary.svg ) . 
  most likely this place is batumi , it is only 15 km from turkey . 
  novgorod is one of the oldest towns in russia . 
  funny that its name means `` new town '' . 
  they made up 49,6 % in 1939 , i 'm pretty sure that they became majority before 1944 when tatars were deported . 
  at that time russians were already majority in crimea , see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_crimea, 
  moldovans must be up to something . 
  and all 3 versions ( 1944 , 1977 and 2001 ) were written by the [ same person ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sergey_mikhalkov ) . 
  very good !, 
  there were two catherines , first one was pretty ordinary , second one ( the one mentioned by you ) was the great . 
  i found [ here ] ( http://auto-globe.ru/automobile-news/the-most-popular-car-in-2015 ) , but the most of other links show different picture , so most likely you are right . 
  upd : my link shows autumn sales . 
  because it is partially in europe . 
  kazakhstan is partially in europe too , but it is not presented here . 
  and i 'm going to fix it , toyota camry was the top selling model in 2016 in kazakhstan . 
  no , solaris was # 1 in 2015 too . 
  lada granta was # 1 in 2014 , it is the second top selling model in russia now . 
  but if you count all models , lada is the most popular auto brand in russia followed by hyundai and kia . 
  i checked domestic sources and they confirm that hyundai solaris is the most popular model in recent months in russia . 
  russians go to kazakhstan for cheaper alcohol if they live not far from the border . 
  no visa required , 3 liters per person are allowed . 
  exactly . 
  government does its best to increase gdp per capita . 
  russia gets most of its income from oil and gas export . 
  and less population means higher gdp per capita . 
  does n't look that you were busy fighting off soviets when poland took vilnius . 
  you wrote that poles took vilnius from soviets . 
  i think they took it from lithuania , because its was lithuanian de facto and de jure . 
  no , vilnius was controlled by lithuania since august 28 , 1920 .
