  poles annexed it several months later . 
  in 1940 , are you sure ? 
  western belarus became part of belorussian sssr in 1939 . 
  no one was killed in military activities in crimea in 2014 but almost everyone calls it invasion . 
   soviet invasion of 1940 what country did ussr invade in 1940 ? 
  this is not true . 
  poland captured vilnius on october 9 , 1920 . 
  the soviet -- lithuanian peace treaty was signed on july 12 , 1920 while hostilities ended in 1919 . 
  they were the last who captured russian capital . 
  they day when moscow was recaptured ( november 4 ) is now national holiday in russia . 
  but frankly speaking the whole idea of making it national holiday was to replace the day of great october socialist revolution on november 7 , but that 's a different story . 
  yes , please . 
  i read about russians families that moved to norway and then evil authorities took away their kids . 
  i thought that it was just usual propaganda about rotten west . 
  it means that people at his court actually knew russian . 
  nicholas i spoke russian with his family members , he used it in his court . 
  also his elder brother alexander wrote letters to their grandmother catherine the great in russian when he was a kid . 
  during some time french was more popular , but russian was never considered a dirty language for peasants and servants only as you wrote . 
  after nicholas i came to power , french became less popular among nobility . 
  in second half of the 19th century nobility used only some phrases in french when talking to each other in russian . 
  speaking that they used french and german for their every day life until ww1 is a huge exaggeration . 
  nicholas i [ insisted on russian language and manners at court ] ( http://www.saint-petersburg.com/royal-family/nicholas-i/ ) . 
  so not only for `` for peasants and servants '' . 
  french was more popular among russian nobility for less than a century . 
  some of them did n't know russian , that 's true , but most of them did . 
  also all tsars spoke russian so saying that it was only for peasants is not true . 
  no , because it was georgia who attacked first . 
  my opinion is based on report of an independent mission established by the eu headed by swiss diplomat heidi tagliavini . 
  that report claimed that [ `` open hostilities began with a large-scale georgian military operation against the town of tskhinvali and the surrounding areas , launched in the night of 7 to 8 august 2008 . 
  '' ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20091007030130/http://www.ceiig.ch/pdf/iiffmcg_volume_i.pdf ) ( page 19 ) . 
  it is under sanctions for more than 2 years already . 
  in 1952 ussr proposed to unify germany as a neutral state but the western allied governments refused this initiative , otherwise it would be similar to austria . 
   that 's bullshit , we invaded to clear the remaining bolshevik scum , and that was done in a matter of weeks . 
  revolution in another country is none of your business , it 's up to them if they wish to live in a communist or a capitalist country . 
   declared itself as the official successor state after its dissolution that declaration meant 3 things : 1 . 
  external debts of ussr . 
  overseas property of ussr . 
  ussr 's seat in the un security council . 
  that 's it . 
  if ussr citizens performed massacres of poles in volhynia does n't mean that russia has to apologize or pay compensation now , because official successor of the ukrainian ssr is ukraine . 
  if ussr stole polish city wilno and gave it to lithuanian ssr does n't mean that russia has to give , for example , kaliningrad to poland as a compensation . 
  the same applies to bessarabia . 
  beneficiary of its annexation was moldovan ssr and your claims should be addressed to moldova . 
   we just took back the shit that was ours , unlike you guys , who love to take shit that is n't yours . 
  you agreed to treaty of san stefano , then 40 years later you kind of changed your mind , right ? 
  how convenient . 
  we also took what was ours since 1812 , we paid thousand of lives for it , we were legit owners . 
  i 'm not saying that russian empire or soviet union were holy angels , no . 
  i 'm just trying to say that romania should n't play victim , it was rather aggressive and broke old treaties when it saw an opportune moment , just like most countries do . 
  so please stop your whining about russia that changed your regime and annexed part of your territory , because you did exactly the same - you changed regime in moldova and annexed it . 
  they are too belligerent . 
  so belligerent that we had to make one of them our minister of defense . 
  right , from ottoman empire . 
  how is it related to romanian annexation after russian revolution ? 
  there was no referendum , sfatul \u0162\u0103rii voted for unification when it was surrounded by romanian army . 
  why did romania invade ? 
  because sfatul \u0162\u0103rii previosly proclaimed the moldavian democratic republic as a federal subject of the russian democratic federative republic . 
  the only righteous owner of bessarabia are people of bessarabia . 
  if they wish to unite with romania - fine , but why did n't it happen in the last 25 years ? 
  we helped you to get independence from turks and you stabbed us in the back when we were weak , of course we paid back , what did you expect ? 
  history in this case is much more complicated than just `` evil russia did tons of shit and never apologized '' . 
  also why do you keep saying `` evil russia '' ? 
  it was the ussr who invaded you , which was ruled by georgian , russians made up only half of its population . 
  we invaded bessarabia after you invaded bessarabia in 1917 , it 's not like we got bored one day and just casually decided to invade bessarabia . 
  did you ever apologize for invading us in 1941 ? 
  funny , but it is fake . 
  i do n't understand why do people downvote this comment , it is absolutely correct . 
  because it was counterfeit bath lotion , according to its label it should have contained ethanol , not methanol . 
  those alcoholics drank it on a regular basis . 
  [ whole ussr would be 71st by hdi in 2015 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/3s5mix/if_ussr_was_reunited_in_2015_oc_1500x844/ ), 
  this is not true for many countries . 
  for example , ussr 's hdi rank was 26th in 1990 , russia 's hdi rank is only 50th , ukraine is 81st , moldova is 107th in 2014 . 
  situation with minorities might be not perfect in russia but still much much better than in estonia . 
  crimean tatar language is official in crimea now . 
  it was not official when crimea was in ukraine .

  [ a lot of photos ] ( http://periskop.livejournal.com/1639745.html ) . 
  old maps are very dangerous . 
  i agree , map is not perfect . 
  but moscow absorbed most of other parts of kievan rus , that 's why it is the major successor of kievan rus . 
  are you aware that moscow existed as village in kievan rus ? 
  on [ this map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/kyivan_rus%27_1220-1240.png ) it is located near vladimir . 
  it is not completely different territory . 
  update : fixed a typo . 
  if you do n't know who ruled does n't mean that nobody knows that . 
  what if apply your logic to poland : poland in 1795 and poland in 1918 - some common roots , but no way the same state . 
  i see , you can not prove your statement . 
  does different geography make poland in 1939 and in 1945 different countries too ? 
  give me exact links that prove your statement . 
  origin of the rurik dynasty is a legend , but you can not argue that it was the same dynasty in 1100 and 1300 . 
  where can i read about belorussian language and state before 1300 ? 
  you should read more about it , you can start from [ this link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rurik_dynasty ) . 
  i do n't think that russians , belorussians and ukrainians existed in 1300 . 
  these nations formed later . 
  the same nation , the same religion , the same language , the same ruling dynasty - yep , completely different countries . 
  european presidents are inferior to asian ones , just compare this with the [ president of turkmenistan ] ( https://youtu.be/otlxyyf8k8i?t=13s ) . 
  i 'm starting to understand why estonians are often portrayed as slow people . 
   so estonians stole their ethnic land from russia ? 
  how chauvinistic can you be ??? 
  see https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6o6mch/russia_appears_to_be_taking_georgias_land_inch_by/dkf5t52/: * basically , estonia conquered them during war of independence in 1920 * * note that these lands have not been part of estonia historically , not during pre-conquered times , nor later * what international law allows your to steal land from neighbors while using self determination right ?
