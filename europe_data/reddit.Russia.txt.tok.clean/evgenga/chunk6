  you guys took too much land and justice was restored later . 
   that 's called an ultimatum . 
  that is also illegal in international law , you know ... 
  there 's nothing wrong with the ultimatums , they are absolutely fine . 
  for example , usa periodically declares ultimatums to other countries , milo\u0161evi\u0107 and saddam could confirm it . 
  i do n't remember that estonia ever complained about it . 
   that 's not how things work ... that 's exactly how things work . 
  one more thing : if you are not ready to fight for your land , then you do n't deserve it . 
  this is how things worked , work and will work . 
  and your whining about evil oppressors only makes you look miserable . 
   russia 's economy is smaller than australia according to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( nominal ) this is not true . 
  it is nenets autonomous okrug , oil/gas province . 
   the highest percentage of any european nation bar poland and lithuania belarus lost twice more - 25 % . 
  take that , ukraine !, 
  such low minimum wage actually means that minimum wage is not set , but in russia it is also used a base for several taxes , for example , private entrepreneurs pay so called `` fixed tax '' no matter what their income is . 
  `` fixed tax '' is defined as 31,1 % of yearly minimum wage . 
  it is kind of convenient , when minimum wage is increased , fixed tax is recalculated automatically . 
  like lack of land border with russia . 
   it was never liberated if it was never liberated , then it is still occupied . 
  if poland was occupied by ussr , then it was very strange occupation , because it ended when poland said : `` we do n't want your troops here anymore , please withdraw them '' and ussr did that . 
  but of course it was n't occupation . 
   they did n't . 
  the warsaw uprising ended on [ 2 october 1944 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_uprising ) . 
  the red army captured the city on [ 17 january 1945 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw#19th_and_20th_centuries ) . 
  i repeat my question : on what sources do you base your retarded conclusions ? 
   just shows the russian perspective , which has nothing to do with liberation or anything related . 
  what does russia has to do with it ? 
  fyi , russia appeared on map 47 years later . 
  soviet union was ruled by cruel dictator who was ethnic georgian , but whatever he made is `` russian fault '' , right ? 
  even if you actually meant `` soviet '' perspective , you are still wrong . 
  warsaw finally was liberated by the soviets . 
  of course you westerners keep telling that one occupation was replaced by another equal occupation , but let me remind you there were no death camps in poland under communists . 
   they were prepared enough , they just did n't want to interfere while someone else was doing their ` dirty work ' . 
  what you are sources on that ? 
  if they were prepared enough , why did they wait for several months after uprising failed ? 
  warsaw was liberated only in 1945 and soviet union lost more than 40 thousands soldiers . 
  i understand that you would prefer to see unprepared red army attacking warsaw and loosing 140 000 people instead of 40 000 , but soviet union still lost approx . 
  27 million people or 15 % of it population , you should be very happy . 
  for the comparison , your country lost only 220 thousands or 2,5 % of population . 
  how dare you to blame soviets for slow advances in some periods of war . 
  if you organize an uprising without coordinating it with the soviets , then you should n't count on their help , should you ? 
  the red army simply was n't prepared enough to attack such a big city , it had some logistics problems , it needed time to organize everything . 
  with all my disrespect for yeltsin i doubt that he did that . 
  russia was always european nation , it was never western nation . 
  civil war consequences were even worse . 
  well , you had just wwi while we had both wwi and civil war . 
  russia in 1919-1921 was exhausted by civil war , it was not the case in 1939 . 
  i knew that you would say that , although this is a bs of course . 
  if you steal someone 's land , do n't be surprised when you get punished for that . 
  also please stop spreading lie about `` soviet occupation '' , there was no such thing because the soviet troops initially entered estonia in 1940 following agreement and the consent of the estonian government . 
  the ussr was not in a state of war or engaged in combat activities on the territories of the estonia , therefore , the word `` occupation '' can not be used . 
   plus we never attacked russian soil in over the last 300 years . 
  [ i member ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ) . 
  but it was absolutely legal when estonia `` conquered '' it in 1920 because estonia always cared about international law , right ? 
  and poland with lithuania . 
   basically , estonia conquered them during war of independence in 1920 as buffer zone between russia . 
  looks like russia just `` conquered '' it back . 
   it 's the most subsidized region of russia it 's actualy [ 5th ] ( http://politrussia.com/ekonomika/regiony-vsyakie-nuzhny-796/ ) . 
  even this wiki article proves that `` television '' is '' \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 '' . 
  i thought she learned russian only in school and expected corresponding ( very low ) level of knowledge . 
  but after seeing this video i think that her russian is actually pretty good . 
  `` television '' is '' \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 '' , it is neuter . 
  you probably meant `` tv set '' - '' \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0440 '' . 
  it is a transcontinental state , just like russia which lies mostly in northern asia . 
   same as nk have a half finished skyscraper at the border . 
  do you mean the ryugyong hotel ? 
  if yes , then it is not at the border , it is in the capital . 
  and the building is [ completed ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/0814_-_nordkorea_2015_-_pj%c3%b6ngjang_-_ryugyong_hotel_%2822978394685%29.jpg?uselang=ru ) but not opened yet . 
  i think it looks awesome . 
   will put it in the second place in europe according to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_tallest_buildings_in_europe , it will be 8th in europe . 
  no doubt that turkey and kazakhstan are partially in europe . 
  according to some definitions of border between europe in asia in caucus , georgia and azerbaijan and also partially in europe . 
  armenia is completely in asia by all border definitions . 
  what about pipeline from norway ? 
  i see , evil russians again . 
  well , i 'm glad that you finally got rid of them and their communism , that you can finally flourish now . 
  but why did your hdi rank dropped to [ 70th ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_human_development_index ) position from [ 26th ] ( http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/219/hdr_1990_en_complete_nostats.pdf ) in 1990 ? 
  why does your capital look [ this way ] ( http://varlamov.ru/2357665.html ) ? 
  maybe because 70th position is your actual place in this world when nobody is feeding you like communists did ? 
  conquering ? 
  your kings heraclius ii and his son george xii actually asked for it . 
  and russian empire saved you guys from total extermination . 
  do you really think that civil society existed before the soviets ? 
  says someone from the country that gave us stalin . 
  it would be so much better if you 'd keep him as a priest . 
  i think it could gradually transform like china did , it is capitalist state without revolutions and shock reforms . 
  and chinese billionaires did n't privatize state property , they earned their money . 
  literally everybody hates russia now in caucasus republics . 
  and provinces of russia altogether hate moscow because all money go there , but russia can exist in this situation , the same with the ussr - it could go on . 
  no expert could predict its collapse in 1985 because there were no existential threats to it at that time , all problems were solvable . 
  no , you are wrong . 
  people do n't afraid to talk about politics . 
  majority of people simply do n't care about it at all . 
  others who care with rare exceptions really support putin . 
  for example , when i talk about navalny and his films , they tell me something like `` do you know that he studied in the us how to organize revolution ? '', 
  or `` do n't you see that he will turn russia into another ukraine ? 
  it also depends were you live . 
  several regions live much better now than 30 years ago : moscow , petersburg , hmao , ynao . 
  big cities are so-so , the rest of the country is literally dying : no jobs , collapsing infrastructure , no perspectives . 
  that 's why i used hdi for comparison .
