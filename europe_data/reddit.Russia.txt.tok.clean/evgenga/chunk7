  because government had no balls to take tough decisions . 
  for example , increasing prices would eliminate all those eternal queues . 
  well , the same can be said about relative freedom of speech that we had in 90 's and increased automobilization - it could happen under communist rule too . 
  look at china - they even have billionaires but country is still ruled by the communist party . 
  i 'm not saying that we should go back to communism . 
  true democracy is much better solution . 
  i 'm just saying that there 's no point to celebrate one of the greatest failures in our history as a national holiday . 
  hey , why did you forgot our major achievement ? 
  we have got 96 billionaires now , more than in uk and japan combined !, 
  no , they were all over the country and they were really bigger than the current ones . 
  i bet you think about tchaikovsky and dostoevsky when you write about pre-revolusion culture of russia , but it was available to only couple percent of the population . 
  russia those days was very archaic society separated by classes and ruled by despotic monarch . 
  only orthodox christian could make career as a bureaucrat , for example . 
  jews were not allowed to settle in moscow and saint petersburg . 
  and communists made very good job in increasing literacy . 
  they also switched to the gregorian calendar and metric system , let women vote . 
  let 's not forget about it . 
  old russia culture was nationalistic while soviet culture was internationalist which is more progressive . 
  i 'm afraid that now we are failing back to nationalism . 
  i would like to be a winner just like you , comrade . 
  what is wrong with my `` facts '' ? 
  funny to read it from someone who has never been to the soviet russia . 
  do you know that russia was ranked [ 49th ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index#2016_human_development_index ) by hdi in 2015 and the ussr was ranked [ 26th ] ( http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/219/hdr_1990_en_complete_nostats.pdf ) in 1990 ? 
  how did it happen that we `` freed from communism '' , got 14 years of insanely high oil prices and in general live even worse compared to other countries than we lived under communists ? 
  russia lost much more `` brilliant innovative minds '' in 90 's than under 70 years of communism . 
  communist russia was not perfect in many aspects , but what came after it is even worse , do n't you realize it ? 
  i do n't understand how can anyone celebrate it . 
  at least communists supported atheism and science while modern russia aggressively promotes religion , people go to jail for dancing or even catching pokemons in church . 
  today i visited opposition meeting organized by navalny supporters . 
  there was approx . 
  2 000 people in a city with population more than a million , less than a percent . 
  things will not change when absolute majority is totally ok with this , everything will be even worse , we are doomed . 
  any former citizen of the ussr could get russian citizenship without any exam in 1991-2000 . 
  as i expected , you can not refute my facts . 
  in russian it has only two meanings : 1 . city/town 2 . hail, 
  have you got better metric than hdi ? 
  please tell me what it is otherwise it will look like you are retarded . 
  and belgrade means `` white town '' . 
  you may call mere facts any way you want , it wo n't change the reality : modern russia sucks really hard . 
  look at the hdi : russia in 2015 was ranked [ 49th ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index#2016_human_development_index ) , the ussr was ranked [ 26th ] ( http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/219/hdr_1990_en_complete_nostats.pdf ) in 1990 , if we calculate together all former soviet republics , we will get country ranked [ 71st ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/3s5mix/if_ussr_was_reunited_in_2015_oc_1500x844/ ) by hdi . 
  there were no civil wars in the ussr , modern russia already had two . 
  one more reason why ussr was better . 
  the same in ee : same-sex marriage would be against the law , that 's why people care . 
  would you care if your brother and sister got married ? 
   it puts the hurt on russia . 
  if you will stop pumping russian gas through your pipelines , it will hurt russia even stronger . 
  this is one of the reasons why i think that ussr was better than modern russia . 
   russia should get rid of all missile defense systems too . 
  do we have it ? 
  as far as i know , no . 
   for how many kilometers do you think troops should be moved , both in nato and russia ? 
  i can not give exact numbers , i think military experts should discuss this . 
   sorry but lithuania is a fascist too according to the russian propaganda . 
  i heard about latvia and estonia , never about lithuania . 
   okay , so , according to you , what should russia and the estonia/nato countries do to reduce the hostility ? 
  - get rid of us missile defense elements . 
  - move back troops that came to baltics recently . 
  - it would be very good if you could give citizenship to everyone without exams , like lithuania did in 1991 . 
  then it would be very hard for russian propagandists to call you fascists . 
  - russia should ratify that border agreement , i do n't understand why it is not ratified if it is signed . 
  - russia should also move back troops from the border . 
  - both sides could conduct periodical inspections to make sure that no one accumulates troops secretly . 
   why would nato do that ? 
  nato thinks that russia is a threat , right ? 
  so nato would like to eliminate threat . 
   do you understand that estonia is a full member of nato ? 
  of course i do . 
  that 's why green men in estonia would mean war between nato and russia . 
   what would be the goal of this attack ? 
  punish russia for reunification with crimea , for example . 
  or change regime to gay-friendly . 
  or prevent possible military alliance with china . 
  there can be many goals i can not even think of now . 
  provocation . 
  nato could secretly send green men to narva and then everyone will shout `` it were russians !, 
  who else could it be ? '' . 
  first your propaganda spreads fear of russia , then you become paranoids , after that you can be very easily manipulated . 
  i think you are already at the stage when nobody will conduct detailed investigation in case it happens . 
  russians did it and that 's it . 
  nato can do little trick and people like you with brains brainwashed by propaganda will demand immediate attack on russia even if it does nothing . 
  wan na know how ? 
   and your parliament did not care to ratify that . 
  yes , they do n't care . 
  why do you care about it ? 
  imagine you have that treaty signed , if russia is treacherous , it can brake any treaty , so it means nothing . 
   you can count how many hours it will take for russia to capitulate against the whole nato&eu . 
  jesus , you threaten me right now !, 
  and how dare you to say that nobody is going to attack russia , when you just said that nato and eu will destroy us . 
   it did in 1939 . 
  i thought we both agreed that it was persuasion . 
  if there are no shades of gray for you , if there are only two states : equality and inequality , then you are right of course . 
   estonia ratified agreement to forgive these lands to russia , just somehow russian government is not ratifying it ? 
  parliament ratifies such agreements in russia , not government . 
  if russia violates treaties , why do you even bother with it ? 
   if your dirty russian forces are at least one inch in estonia , your russia is doomed . 
  what if your local citizenshipless population will create people 's republic of narva ? 
  technically it wo n't be dirty ( why dirty btw ? ), 
  russian forces . 
   you will never annex estonia again . 
  your words sound like we ever did .
