rich donations to chechnya this is so overmemed i ca n't even . 
  chechnya indeed receives some monies , but it returns a lot as well . 
  when you [ do the math ] ( http://info.minfin.ru/subj_analitics.php ) , it turns out chechnya is less of a burden than half of russian federal districts . 
  losing chechnya to the wolves does not save any significant sum of money , it creates potential problems to oil pipes from azerbaijan through russia , and you ca n't be sure they will be able to maintain a stable state . 
  russian citizens compose the largest group of foreign isis fighters coming from europe . 
  it 's funny actually , our most famous political commentator consciously imitates bill o'reilly . 
  they know this stuff very well , putin gave his first interview to larry king , and then time and time again picked notable personalities . 
  they love american tv . 
  `` guy sorman has written twenty books that promote modern capitalism . 
  he has held many government positions in france . '', 
  [ check this then ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pskpqleqrc ) . 
  americans did some moves to hint violence is ok as long as you * strongly disagree * with something . 
  poland at the end of the interwar period had lower gdp per capita than the ussr , that may be a reason why eastern european countries did not start full-scale rebellions against the soviet occupation . 
  trotsky 's first and second chapters of `` the revolution betrayed '' describe how the shit goes , planned economy can propel rapid development of a country . 
  i 'm still to look into how this worked out in the warsaw pact countries , was there a theoretically proposed boost or no ? 
  they quote in length an italian professor that explains theories of jacques lacan , a famous french freudian . 
  [ `` macron \u00e8 pericoloso '' by adriano segatori ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4qxmfse5ei ) and then quote an american psychoanalytic nancy mcwilliams . 
  it 's no more offensive than attempts to analyze personalities of adolf hitler , donald trump or vladimir putin . 
   surely the majority of the russian population were against it ? 
  well , that 's the thing . 
  what many refuse to accept is that putin is a moderate politician . 
  there are things to the right of putin and the russian majority will support them by a landslide . 
  any party that proposes `` well , suck it up russia , you suck '' will be toppled in free elections . 
  there is no pro-russian parties in ukraine left , there will be no pro-ukrainian parties in russia . 
  the recent democratic period in russia was n't all that democratic . 
  yeltsin seized power in a coup , did ban the political opposition to him and had to rig elections . 
  it was n't vox populi and has a bad rep. 
  nice flag, 
  not an argument . 
  simpletons believe russians will vote center-left or something . 
  at the times when europeans vote far-right in droves . 
  to put a tinfoil hat , it might be some financial powerhouse wants a war in europe and pushes the idea of democracy in russia . 
  everyone understands russia will end up with strelkov as pm . 
   d e m o c r a c y would you advise it to weimar germany ? 
  not that i 'm against it , just wonder whether one reckons all the consequences . 
  russkies express support for the crimea annexation , but will vote for parties that want to return crimea back !, 
  how so ? 
  might be a joke on 4chan , but / r/europe is liberal like hell and they do support navalny . 
  and liberal media supports him . 
  really makes you think . 
  it is n't a boogeyman calling , `` look nazis ! '' . 
  they are n't nazis to begin with . 
  the foreign policy of russia might change in an interesting direction . 
  russians feel deeply offended how the things with ukraine are going , our domestic politics is far from perfect . 
  there 's something to be done about the oligarchs . 
  i would perfectly expect them to win . 
  it 's just some are delusional about the state of things to come . 
  a bunch of kids and urban freelancers are not representative to what `` the 50 % '' will vote into power . 
  a man with criminal charges can not run for president . 
  wikipedia has something on the issue : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexei_navalny#kirovles_case, 
  welp . 
  the cheerleading from foreigners does not improve the situation . 
  the fact is that the russians will not become liberal and pro-western . 
  the opposite will happen . 
  a group that believes it can win a parliamentary election and is dead serious about annexing parts of kazakhstan , ukraine , belarus - and the baltic countries - endorses navalny . 
  some balts are able to read russian or know someone who can , you might check it out yourself , it 's called `` sputnik & pogrom '' . 
  media wants to see some discord in russia or whatever and seek ways to `` apply pressure '' on `` the enemies '' and little do they care what might come of it . 
  may i remind france was hiding a man that staged the 1979 coup in iran . 
  things got out of hand a bit , are n't they . 
  poles deny they have bad feelings for russians , they insist it 's the government . 
  i did n't interact too much with lefty and pro-eu poles though , these might hate us indeed . 
  [ the official eu plan ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/people_in_the_eu_%e2%80%93_population_projections ) is that germany will shrink by 15 mln and become a 65 mln country by 2080 , while france and uk grow some meat and add 12 and 21 mln respectively . 
  poland 's gon na have a population of 29 mln , with the current being 38 mln . 
  bulgaria , greece , i feel you . 
  he 's a broken english slav with no program and no coherent views . 
  his main redeeming quality in the eyes of his supporters is that he 's not putin . 
  a very trumpy situation . 
  here 's a surprisingly [ not bad article ] ( https://www.salon.com/2017/04/02/dictator-vs-democrat-not-quite-russian-opposition-leader-alexey-navalny-is-no-progressive-hero/ ) in salon . 
  they do not mention undecided voters to have a better mood and feel better about themselves , or is there another reasoning ? 
  seriously , it 's omitted all the time . 
  funny thing that `` european fascists '' want to be friends with russia , while an ideology that considers `` a white male '' a rather sceptical figure screams in terror at the russians . 
  yes , i am a man of color , belarus . 
  what are you anyway , a racist ? 
  no enter to the eu then . 
  i 'm jut parroting what people are saying about the russians and getting upvotes . 
  why are finns getting so nervous ? 
  language is a start , and a quite problematic one . 
  finns have the highest average iq in europe , yet high iq is an asian feature . 
  whites are a bit dumber than finns . 
  there 's some cultural problems with finland as kalevala and the winter war cult do not make up for the lack of artists and writers , and loud rhythmic music is something blacks are more into . 
  south korea may be what finland is , a perfect emulation of a western country . 
  not white . 
  finns are huge weirdos by themselves and are quick to overcompensate . 
  do finns realize they do not speak a european language , to begin with ? 
  these blood and soil arguments would piss off half the europe . 
  one could drive a wedge between latin speaking countries and germanic speaking countries ; slavs would jump in at some point as poland does not exactly share the values of big european cities . 
  there are muslim countries in europe , albania and bosnia . 
  and why do n't you people make the same keen observations about turkey ? 
  they are muslim and speak a turkic language , you know . 
  so much for the multiculturalism and diversity celebrations . 
  it may be a lost cause after all when you have no better arguments . 
  varg vikernes , a far right meme , [ believes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8teqa17db8 ) le pen represents something evil . 
  to be precise , he 's afraid of state crack-downs on non-conformists like himself . 
  it figures le pen is an anti-fascist , in a way ? 
  on their [ website ] ( https://www.onr.com.pl/czym-jest-onr/ ) ( in polish ) they say they are n't interested to become a party and despise parliamentary system . 
  what are they gon na do then ? 
  prowl the streets with no purpose ? 
  stage a coup ? 
  aye , but it seems unpopular . 
  i know about a right-wing startup ( sic ! ),
