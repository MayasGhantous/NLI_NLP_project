  sick mythology reference , bro . 
  i guess you found me out . 
  i guess i 'll go cash that huge putin paycheck now . 
  edit : did you even understand what i said in the prev . 
  post ? 
  how 's your german ? 
  did you pay attention in school ? 
  god , i hate the `` putin-versteher '' term so much . 
  it 's basically an old , dusty and obvious tool where if you try to understand where your adversary is coming from ( i 'm not a putin fan btw ) , you instantly labeled a traitor to the cause . 
  it implies that you are trying to understand something that is inherently irrational and evil , thus labelling you insane for trying to understand `` the devil '' and since you are trying to undestand the incomprehensible , you are somehow sympathetic to its goals . 
  like suggesting that someone is dealing with the devil . 
  so is it wrong to understand putin ? 
  he may be a fucking asshole , but his motives are perfectly understandable if you look into it . 
  edit : i do n't understand the downvotes . 
  a russian flair is apparently all that matters , even if mostly i share your fucking opinion . 
  all i did was write somethig about a figure of polit-speak that is used against many others , not only putin . 
  but keep on circlejerking , if that 's what you do here . 
  you shill, 
  well , lots of people just fled before the soviets came in . 
  then maybe you should have looked at the comment that i was replying to , ** before ** you posted :  white washing the sins of the most deadliest and evil ideology and regime the planet has ever faced, 
  what i mean is that when people say `` the worst regime in history '' , i kinda wonder whether i grew up in the same soviet union that these internet people are talking about . 
  also , the family album was an allegory for my family and their friends having had lots of good times . 
  plenty of difficult ones , too , although generally those were mostly after 1992 . i myself have had more shitty experiences since i moved to the west a couple years ago . 
  and we were all working class , just regular shlubs , no party members , some were even denied komsomol membership due to some remote german ancestry . 
  my grandparents worked in a machine all their lives . 
  and if we 're talking about judging a regime from outside by its foreign policy , then i guess millions of brown and asian people would like a word with you about what the most evil regime ever was . 
  ussr ! = nazi germany, 
  til that even ussr pacifists were just butthurt warmongers in disguise . 
  thank you , ukrainian friend , for your history lesson . 
  maybe because the ussr was not entirely evil ? 
  edit : downvotes ? 
  are you people really unable to acknowledge , that the ussr was not literally mordor 100 % of the time ? 
  i swear to god , i have a bunch of good ( and bad ) memories and a photo album full of pictures of happy family members enjoying theimselves . 
  little did they know , they were living in hell . 
  you talking to yourself is not a conversation . 
  it 's an echochamber monologue . 
  ukraine is fighting the dnr right now . 
  [ good , i can feel your anger . 
  i am defenseless . 
  take your weapon . 
  strike me down with all of your hatred and your journey towards the dark side will be complete !, 
  ] ( http://www.theforce.net/kids/coruscant/probe_droid/palpatine.jpg ), 
  so why are the ukrainians fighting with he russians instead of against them ? 
  remember , dnr has almost 2 million people vs. a couple thousand russians that are there allegedly . 
  also , the rebellion was well underway before the russians even sent their troops . 
  but why do you think people rebelled in the first place ? 
  methinks russian propaganda is not strong enough to send an entire region of peaceful people into civil war . 
  those people have their reasons , life was n't very rosy for them apparently . 
  that ca n't defeat a bunch of former farmers , miners and steel mill workers ? 
  even if there are some russians with their weapons there , dnr still mainly consists of the local population . 
  traumatic ? 
  being an immigrant ai n't that bad , you get adjusted . 
  source : my life . 
  no , but by following a ham-fisted and simplified narrative like straight outta lord of the rings `` evil putler is plotting evil things in mordor '' or star wars ( evil emperor , noble rebels ) is not exactly making me trust the western media . 
  we ** know ** from all of world history that the world is not as black and white as it 's ususally portrayed , and we ** know ** the russia issue to be kinda complex , so whenever we encounter a black and white narrative for retards like that , we assume it 's probably spun in someone 's interests . 
  to russians , obviously other things matter more than the ruble exchange rate , which is not insane , i would argue . 
  meanwhile you keep repeating the same shit over and over , even when the ** actual russian opposition ** disagrees . 
   putin is at least in some way responsible as the current climate in russia was created by his government . 
  you are absolutely right . 
  i guess you solved the murder mystery all by yourself , have n't you ? 
  and all that without even getting out of your armchair , wow !, 
  nah , this is pulled out of context . 
  they were reporting on how some people on the internet are comparing tyagnibok to himmler and photoshopping fake bills with hitler 's face . 
  i think the announcer just accidentally a word so it sounds like a literal accusation , but that does n't make any sense . 
  it was in a segment about internet memes . 
  sounded more like the announcer missed a word ( '' \u0447\u0442\u043e '' ) , because they put it in the internet meme segment . 
  i 'd imagine that if this was something they 'd really wan na accuse the ukrainians with , they would make a bigger bit about it and really beat the shit out of it , not just mention it in 2 seconds ? 
  true enough . 
  the main reason some people vote putin is that all other candidates are either so insane or incapable ( or a communist ) that putin actually seems pretty solid . 
  giant douche or turd sandwich , man . 
  yes , quite, 
  dude we totally need it . 
  just gon na hold onto it for two more weeks max , ok ? 
  we 're doing dope shit with it, 
   regular country tell me more, 
  naww , we just messin with you , dog, 
  i agree about migrants ( sort of ) but the op is about refugees . 
  all this is about refugees and terrorists . 
  there would still be terrosists without any physical migration though due to the conversion of europeans though . 
  white people with white ancestors are converting to islamic ( and other ) extremism through isis propaganda . 
  this whole thread is about how there are `` secret sleeper terrorists '' among the refugees that are now coming to europe with the op as proof . 
  with people circlejerking to the point where they think they are being `` overrun '' . 
  my point is that refugees have little to do with extremists or rather are an independent issue . 
  those guys can board a plane in morocco and be here tomorrow . 
  or they can be recruited from eu citizens . 
  all of the paris guys were eu citizens , not refugees . 
  they were also known to have ties to terrorism . 
  this problem existed well before the refugee crisis . 
  you really think `` bad guys '' will travel for weeks with poor migrants and sleep in miserable conditions when they can just as easily get a tourist visa ( or even cross borders illegally ) , come to any country and blow shit up ? 
  that 's not appropriate here, 
  anyone can get a visa and buy a plane ticket . 
  fucking bin laden ( god rest his soul ) can get a false passport and a visa and go to sweden via plane , ship or car . 
  the orchestrators of charlie hebdo and paris shootings were eu citizens . 
  isis recruits people directly in the eu . 
  how the fuck are the refugees part of any of this ? 
  think logically , people, 
  with 742 million people in the eu vs. a couple million immigrants , i am sure the eu will be literally overrun . 
  an then they will take your job , fuck your wife and murder your kid . 
  do you even hear yourself talk ? 
  sorry bro , it 's in my garage and i sorta lost the keys .
