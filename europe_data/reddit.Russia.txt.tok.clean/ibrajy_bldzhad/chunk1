for putin , yeah , there are alternatives , but right now in syria , it seems , it 's either assad or bloody civil war between different extremist groups , while normal people flee . 
  i do n't . 
  i 'd rather they not do this , because they send people there in secrecy and if something will happen to those soldiers ... well , they were volunteers , who resigned from the army month before they got there . 
  i was writing more in sarcastic way . 
  it 's sad that alternatives for this dictatorship are also bleak . 
  do n't salt my wounds !, 
  [ the situation is not critical . 
  well , someone has to do the dirty work and liberate the shit out of syria . 
  damn migrants !, 
  sounds good , time will tell if it will be helpful . 
  it 's [ \u02c8bab\u028a\u0282k\u0259 ] . 
  take in some migrants , they will make you children and you will have more jobs for teachers . 
  [ all sorts of dresses ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/prokudin-gorskii-08.jpg ) . 
  if you look into it we really have a lot of styles . 
  it 's a shame that people forget about those things and lose touch with their heritage . 
  life is n't so good here , so they try to get away . 
  and without good education or skills the easiest way is to marry somebody . 
  hell , it 's even easier than with skills . 
  everybody talks about their need of skilled workers etc , but amount of bullshit you have to go through to immigrate to work is , well , let 's say it 's a big pile . 
  that a nice train . 
  oh , they drink alcohol ok . seen lots of muslims who are absolutely halal in the streets , but absolutely haram under the sheets so to speak . 
  bears . 
  while eu do n't need our gas , we can export bears .

  well , by russian standards he lives in good apartment . 
  it needs renovation , but hell , it 's only 1 hour and 10 minutes from almost center of moscow by commuter train . 
  some people here can only dream about things like that . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2015/09/16_a_7760297.shtml ) is an initial article . 
  tl ; dr : soldiers did not want to be sent to syria in secret , while military command was threatening them and their relatives ( tipical behavior ) and went to the meeting with reporters . 
  and [ here ] ( http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2015/09/19_a_7765883.shtml ) is an article where it 's told that they are causing a big scandal and may be tried for treason . 
  basically tipical russian military shit : they send some people somewhere without written order and later ( if they are caught , killed , or just found ) tell that they were volunteers or that they were never there . 
  even to mothers and wives of those soldiers . 
  like in afganistan , when soldiers came to one of the generals who sent them there and he told them that they can go fuck themselves , he did n't send them anywhere , that they volunteered . 
  i can somewhat understand other slavic languages ( the closer to russia , the better ) , but i never been able to practice speaking them . 
  oh ... how amusing .

  yeah , every fucking town , setlmen and even some villages have their own statue or a bust . 
  sometimes it 's about 30 minutes of walking between 2 . 
  it 's hard to explain , really . 
  i myself struggle with self-identification . 
  i feel that i 'm russian , not in terms of living in russia , but in terms of connecting to the past generations ( hell , even my surname is believed to originate in times of kievan rus around it 's christianisation ) , but i ca n't really describe what that means . 
  first of all , 100 years ago russia was mostly and agrarian country , urbanisation and industrialisation were very low and folk culture were concentrated mostly in villages and small towns . 
  when bolsheviks came to power , they were making a proletarian ( urban , industrial ) revolution in agrarian state . 
  they sacrifced peasants to support big cities like moscow and saint petersburg . 
  lots of people died during civil war , starved because of [ prodrazvyorstka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prodrazvyorstka ) and [ holodomor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holodomor ) ( yes , it 's not about just ukraine , lot 's and lots of people suffered , but people here see russia as a continuation of ussr , so criticising it is seen as treason and people do n't care in general , but i 'll talk about it further down this post ) , and were killed in rebellions like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tambov_rebellion ) , let 's not forget the war against church and religion in general - a major part of russian identity . 
  later , during stalin 's rule there were further industrialisation and urbanisation , [ collectivisation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collectivization_in_the_soviet_union ) , [ great purge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_purge ) ( lot 's of people were murdered in this one , generals , party officials , even common people like tram drivers ) . 
  it all had a very strong impact on the population . 
  and there was a lot of communist propaganda . 
  `` old ways and traditions are bad , we need to destroy the old world to build a new one , we need to make a worldwide revolutuion , to erase nations and to create a new soviet man , who will be paragon of all vitues '' . 
  so it was a genocide , cultural and physical . 
  and aside frome couple of people , nobody really cares , really . 
  then the great war came . 
  about 3.5 millions surrendered in the beginning of the war due to surprise attacks ( those who survived mostly went straight to gulags after the war as traitors and untrustworthy elements ) and the war itself was a real bloodbath . 
  nazis wanted us dead and sovit command was pretty incompetent so it just threw wave after wave at the enemy as if they also wanted to kill us all . 
  even if you look at [ wikipedia data ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_casualties#ussr ) you can see that 24 millions were killed ( we still find unrecognised remains in former battle fields ) almost 14 were from russia , 7 were from ukraine . 
  and while there are many ethnical groups within russia , most of those who were fighting were ethnically and culturally russian . 
  if you really want to see how the war looked through the eyes of a simple russian soldier you can read some of [ astafyev 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viktor_astafyev ) work , the only problem - i do n't know anything about translations . 
  he went throught hell and he thought that all those generals with their medals , all those party leaders should stand on their knees and pray for forgivness for what the 've done and how . 
  after the war collectivisation and urbanisation plans were continued . 
  people started to flee countryside , because there were no perspectives there . 
  the city life become a desired one . 
  lots of people were left without their fathers and grandfathers . 
  propaganda was going strong . 
  traditional russian culture started to resurface a bit in the 70 's . 
  but it was seen as a marvelous artifact from the past , as something dead , as tourist attraction . 
  not as something that can be influential right now , be part of modern culture . 
  not that all people thought that way , but they were silenced . 
  just look at solzhenitsyn for example . 
  so now we have people who 's link to the past generations was strongly distorted . 
  we do n't even have our own little home in federation . 
  other ethnic and cultural groups have their republics within federation ( tatarstan , yakutia , buryatia , chechnya , dagestan , etc ) , but we do n't have russia ( i know it 's hard to follow , but what you call russian i actually two different things : russkiy - the russian as in nationality , and rossiyanin - citizen of russian federation ) . 
  if , for example , the next president will be from yakutia , he will be considered russian even if he is yakut , because he speaks russian , he lives in russia , he read the same books in school . 
  so we are even more dissolved . 
  in many countries people have some sort of modern version of national dress , like in japan , scandinavian countries , even in national republics within russian federation . 
  almost none of it here . 
  i talked with lots of people . 
  near me and far away via internet . 
  most see traditional russian costumes the same way as they se japanese ones . 
  as somethin that foreign to them , though they understand tha that is part of their past . 
  same with folk music , for example , it 's almost forgotten . 
  only couple of songs are in use and it 's more due to the fact that they were chosen buy some modern singers .
