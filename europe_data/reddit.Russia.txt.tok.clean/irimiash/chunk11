  the fall of the su was a tragedy to russians , no matter how you feel about su itself, 
  [ i am cadet ] ( https://pp.userapi.com/c639920/v639920740/cebc/5h54xaktzbc.jpg ), 
  these fonts tells a lot, 
  of course you are wrong , we 've never planned to war together . 
  your historical education is on zero level, 
  i do n't understand why is it good news here ... are n't they support ni in gb ? 
  so the fall of unioninsts due to the rise of nationalists ? 
  or here is something i do n't understand ? 
  the problem is not with homosexuality , the problem in people who promote it . 
  they are very agressive . 
  if you do n't support gays , you are literally untermensch . 
  of course russians ( and other traditional societies ) , who look at that , ca n't follow it . 
  it associated with fall of independence , at least . 
  to rewrite history in politicial interests , why not . 
  do n't think that it somehow will touch me , but sad to look at this, 
  are people of kongo great ? 
  stop writing footnotes on our territory !, 
  when turks were great ? 
  under the north korea , achievement unlocked, 
  do you hate your own culture ? 
  this parades lost their sense and become a some culture thing . 
  and i do n't like that europe 's culture looks like this now, 
  so what 's the reason of parade if nobody cares, 
   it 's a protest against the statu quo and it is meant to be somewhat shoking but status quo is different nowadays, 
  they are lazy , orthodoxal and do n't hate russians, 
  maybe without your we would be a colony of sweden, 
  \u0410\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0442 - the popular expression denoting mostly implicit actions ( diplomatic , economic , espionage , propaganda ) great britain v russia ( the soviet union , the russian empire , the russian federation ) . 
  '' \u0433\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0442 '' does n't always mean `` shit '' . 
  more often is figurative sense , `` do harm '' ( shit means that too , but more rough ), 
  you have many soviet-era blocks ? 
  do n't touch \u042b !, 
  \u042b is sacred  yeah , words would become a bit longer , but hey , now each letter would produce exactly one sound . 
  sounds cool , eh ? 
  it will look terrible , with these endless \u0439 in every word . 
  how the fuck it is easier ? 
  i do n't understand anything when i listen bulgarian . 
  maybe 5 % . 
  ukrainian is pretty easy to understand, 
  not so secret , if we already know it, 
   it feels like the 1980s all over again . 
  what do you mean ? 
  why putin is n't imprisoned when he goes to germany , to usa , to france ? 
  your security works really bad , if they ca n't catch this criminal and even let him get to the heads of states . 
  maybe his kgb skills , the only explanation, 
  had n't they ? 
  but maybe someone needs to raise the support of left-wing parties, 
  i feel taste of propaganda here, 
  what did he get from europe ? 
  always sympathized to wolf, 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
  well known here . 
  at least films and cartoons, 
  just copied from the massage above, 
  even putin ca n't falcificate it , if 70 % would against him, 
  yeah , much better than to just elect poroshenko 1 year later, 
  ha-ha , white people problems, 
  social status, 
  why is it fortunately ? 
  [ some ] ( http://cs9.pikabu.ru/post_img/2017/02/15/11/148718583711398733.jpg ) of them are [ destroing ] ( http://cs8.pikabu.ru/post_img/2017/02/15/11/1487185803148914038.jpg ) . 
  maybe you should just do n't go in russia, 
  i hate mixing , but small towns who is buildt only with these blocks looks not ugly , for me . 
  every block assoisiated with people , who is living there , it is not bad, 
   and all of that is completely besides the point , as this annexation goes against international law and the budapest memorandum . 
  i do n't feel sorry for these collaborationists  imperialism and military expansionism is not to be justified , regardless of who is doing it . 
  these ideas should be dead with the fall of ussr . 
  but somehow they did n't . 
  230,000 people is still not big enough number . 
  [ old meme ] ( http://img0.liveinternet.ru/images/attach/b/4/104/347/104347880_large_995482_605701212813268_734029885_n.jpg ), 
  i did n't say that crimea should belong to russia . 
  but not by international law-logic , but by historical logic , it makes much more sense that estonia . 
  crimea does n't have a nation that want to live independent . 
  russia shed much blood for crimea , it is very important to our culture and history . 
  the fact that crimea was turned ukrainan is just ridiculous , it makes no sense . 
  but of course it is not normal situation when some country broke an agreement . 
  law is law . 
  he can deal it protecting the same values as the other europeans in dispute . 
  but this `` i 'm so sorry for my countrymates ... '' is pathetic . 
  who the fuck is you to sorry about it . 
  and why you should sorry . 
  i mean , there are different opinions and it is normal to discuss it . 
  why the flair near the nickname should matter and define , who is right to claim smth and who is not right, 
  okay for a lot of years . 
  anyway it is hard to say that we imported some people there, 
  why not ? 
  is n't it incorrect for him to get responsible for all our people ? 
  i do n't really understand whe he get upvoted, 
   your own people into these territories . 
  crimea was always russian territory with russian people . 
  who is interested in `` legitimate '' ? 
  just imagine that west will do it next year , will you recognize the results ? 
  only full retard can think in that way, 
  okay it recognised because of politicial reasons , but by linguistic norms it is n't, 
  yeah but if you will talk about it with linguists , belarusian language is more a russian accent than a independent language . 
  there are criteria about it , and it does n't suits them . 
  it recognised as independent for political reasons  i 'm angry because it upsets me that people still think this way . 
  i think you mixed up something , in opposite , ussr was possessed to find different cultures and nations . 
  `` friendship of peoples '' was based on this . 
  russian empire exist at the same time as other empires , so it is strange to blame us for it, 
   are you fucking kidding me enlighten  i ca n't wait to see this arrogance be the death of your beloved regime you guys are very angry . 
  ca n't write anything without mention my flair .
