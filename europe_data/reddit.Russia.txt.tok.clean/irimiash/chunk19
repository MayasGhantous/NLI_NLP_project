  what 's wrong with unequility in the us ? 
  unequility is not a desease itself, 
  almost no one in russia will tell you that he `` supports oligarchs '' . 
  but people do it indirectly , right, 
  fortunately . 
  under the video typical youtube trash discusion lol, 
  sometimes they invite true opposition , but only separately and mock him by all crowd, 
  okay . 
  i forgot that your use the same alphabet as the others and i can just find original name . 
  maybe tomash maceychuk is more correct ? 
  that we lives in a shit . 
  nothing new, 
  google translate : record tv program `` the right to vote '' on the tvc channel on the situation in ukraine , over a scuffle participants . 
  as a result of the conflict , it was decided not to start a program on the air . 
  the incident occurred due to the fact that we are in the studio polish journalist tomasz matseychuk several times grossly insulted russia and the russian people . 
  statements guest in the studio caused the angry reaction of his opponents who demanded to leave tomas shooting . 
  however , the journalist refused and again naham interlocutors , after which the ex-head of the party `` rodina '' igor markov lost his nerve , and he paid a pole punch to the head , after which the recording stops . 
  note that during a clash matseychuk did not try to apologize and claimed that it is entitled to make such statements . 
  some ukrainian guests had left the studio after filming a fight with him in solidarity . 
  as reported at the television because of the incident on the air transfer will not work . 
  okay maybe i just do n't know your language . 
  in russian we do n't use our analog of this word ( \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0438\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439 ) in that way . 
  \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0438\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439 = friendly to abstract guests , not to some specific group . 
  i do n't really understand why . 
  in that way you can say that russians are not * every positive feature * , because they dislikes gays . 
  it causes a different reaction = it is different . 
  here it matters  and therefore not hospitable it is not tollerance , but hospitality is different . 
  i dunno , maybe only in russian language , but original post was by finn . 
  i suppose he used the same meaning, 
   holding a hand of a person you ** gay ** love is a provocation ? 
  it is a public expression of ** gay ** love , are you saying that ** gay ** love is not adopted as a value in russia ? 
  now all is correct . 
  it is not adopted , true . 
   simply even for me , although i 'm not homophobic , it is not simply . 
  i can say that i 've never seen gay couples , holding hands . 
  it will , at least , catches my attention . 
  though i i live in spb , in a large city . 
  russians are hospitable means that they 'll do for you all that they can , if you are their guest . 
  that is true ( or was true , now i 'm not sure . 
  compare to the armenians , f.e. , we still are ) . 
  it has absolutely nothing with our values and our reaction on a strange attention, 
  it is public expression of somewhat , that is not adopted here . 
  it is your basic value because you do n't find anything strange in it . 
  we are and everybody knows it , so it is just a provocation . 
   how can you call russia a hospitable place , if holding a hand of someone you love is considered `` disrespecting local values '' ? 
  it is sophistry . 
  hospitality does n't apply to the people who disrespect your . 
  btw i ca n't call it now , but for other reasons . 
  maybe before the collapse of the ussr it was so , but now i 'm doubt, 
  why do you care about it . 
  just laugh, 
  i learned german at school . 
  but now i forgot almost everything : /, 
  hospitality is different . 
  i should n't have added that you must at least respect people , if you are a guest . 
  we 've different culture so system of your basic values do n't work here . 
  especially in rural , the most convervative , places . 
  if you are a gay , just do n't tell it , is it hard ? 
  and except if you are thief , rapist or murderer . 
  if you 'll always add all this descriptions , your speech would be ponderous, 
  yeah i know, 
  rammstein ? 
  who said rammstein ? 
  it are their internal affairs, 
  separatists are criminals whoever they are, 
  lol what ? 
  i hope you are just not in the subject, 
  maybe because clinton promised to start the war with us ? 
  rosneft controls putin more than putin controls rosneft, 
  trump is not completely right too, 
  hospitality has nothing to do with this . 
  you should quote other part of his message , about xenophobia, 
  i do n't know how you tied this photo with gulag, 
   defend yourself from polar bears what ? 
  for people who 've already earned enough money it is still ok, 
  http://blog.bnkomi.ru/post-19510/ some else . 
  and at the bottom of the page links to the others, 
  arkhangelsk region ( neighbor ), 
  strange guy with strange statements, 
  http://pikabu.ru/story/russkaya_krasota_4615005 more photos here, 
  what does it mean `` pro-russian '' ? 
  i 've never heard about some kind of coalition with bulgaria or moldova . 
  if you just blame him for being corrupted by russia , write in this way, 
  it is typical dutch thing or what, 
  you saw the picture in the internet and are going to go there already ? 
  there was the only reason to post it here, 
  zero tolerance, 
  the motherland can sleep peacefully, 
  they 're good at bascetball ^ / s, 
  propably you are right , but why do you care ? 
  pr-campaign is n't bad itself, 
  do you think they know all these instructions ? 
  they are normal people , not politicians or lawyers, 
  this list is just bad . 
  you do n't need to explain me . 
  but there are still some social groups that support him, 
  right wing dislikes him from the begining . 
  left wing dislikes him because of right-wing politics . 
  am i right ? 
  not absolutely , there are still things like el ` tsin centre,
