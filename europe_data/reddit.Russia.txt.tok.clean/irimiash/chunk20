   at least in the 90s agreeing with me would not have put you in danger . 
  in the 90s almost everything that you can do put you in danger . 
  expecially for journalists , artists and homosexuals, 
   alexievich won the nobel prize in literature for her work not the glorious time in the history of this prize, 
  everyday opression ? 
  soundproofing, 
  it is difficult . 
  but to present el ` tsin and gorbachev as a saviors of russia was n't a good idea , yeah ( from the west point of view maybe it was though ), 
  you are just bad at design . 
  maybe you have something against the carpet on the wall ? 
  it is not clever to call everybody who do n't support your utilitarian ideas idiots . 
  people are different , grow in different traditions . 
  it is understandable that religious people opposes euthanasia, 
  in germany too, 
  lucky you, 
   i 'm not a fan of his economics but you are a fan of economics of socialists ? 
  it 's ridiculous, 
  is [ it ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050634/ ) forgotten too ? 
  sad , because it is one of the best films ever made, 
  along all things that our government do , these `` sanctions '' are maybe the most stupid, 
  come on , crisis in russia began before the sanctions , even before the fall in oil prices . 
  [ what ] ( https://otvet.imgsmail.ru/download/93622049_218ec9957b5deaf0b4465685da5a3ee0_800.jpg ), 
  should have thought about this before , when they decide to recognize katyn . 
  i do n't like the ussr but its dissolution was a bad thing . 
  just look at it , it was a disaster . 
  there had to be other solutions, 
  personal experience is the worst argument, 
  like anybody can distinguish one from another, 
  flashily, 
  i missed the court, 
  only russians , not ukrainians who speak russian , defenitely not, 
   not the most popular source of news in general . 
  it does n't follow from the previous fact, 
  now you guys will repeat this in every thread ? 
  i ca n't say that russians are special here . 
  on the contrary , our religion on the first steps was much more adapted to the common people than catholicism . 
  first time i see this term, 
  russians really rarely believe in god , but there are different minorities in russia , some of them actually do, 
  do you understnad that average north korean would kill somebody ( if you would suggest it ) for obtaining a place in such `` labour camp '', 
   i 'm just sick of being called a bandera just because i 'm from ukraine . 
  it only matters for poles . 
  russians use it as swearing, 
   do n't read beyond the headline it is pretty hard there , because the article is in deutsch, 
  it looks like \u0441\u0443\u0445\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438 ( i did n't find the english word ), 
  yeah , those dumb russians , do n't know how to talk in the internet . 
  quite another matter are progressive europeans , they would never use stereotypes talking to someone they do n't know personally, 
  sometimes not the worst one !, 
  some of our right-wing oppositionists call for voting for kprf , 
  is it about politcal extremists or about terrorists ? 
  i know a several people ( like my parents ) who read a lot of western media but still more trust to the government owned . 
  sometimes the ca n't distinguish the personal opinion of some journalist/analyst from official news ( and thus they think that the media spread bullshiit ) . 
  sometimes they do n't understand that not all western media have the same level of quality . 
  sometimes west just spread some unconfirmed information as a obvious fact , it makes people really angry ( if you would start to argue with russians , it would always be the first argument against your position ), 
  what else do you * know *, 
  you speak like china is better  they all want the same, 
   i 'm about 99 % sure it was rebels tbh  everyone knows russia did it do define, 
  i did n't ask investigation . 
  here i also do n't see the mention of behaviour of ukrainian planes before the tragedy ( which , for me , is one of the most important fact in assessing this case ) , that makes it biased . 
  yeah , just like the investigation of `` blue whale '', 
  they do their work good , it just not a journalism, 
  everybody who disagrees with me is a liar, 
  like there is someone who knows the truth about mh17, 
  which by european standards have a very low quality, 
  ha-ha , it serves you right , russkies !, 
  you guys are petty, 
  because he wants to do politics in ukraine, 
  i meant `` your '' . 
  we do n't have `` politics '' , we have putin, 
  thanks, 
  with this rhetoric you will only have another big war . 
  glad that your politicians are more reasonable ( but spread this shit more and this will change ), 
  so left-wing , i doubt that in reality it is so simple, 
  strange that the number for ukraine is so low , i know at least drudkh and nokturnal mortum, 
  yeah . 
  there are no problems in european countries - just evil politics try to destroy some countries . 
  who cares about the fact that they were democratically elected ? 
  why are n't germans patriotic ? 
  what can be more stable than usa, 
  i am starting to think that kremlin bots spread the articles like that themselves, 
  arnold meri , for sure , is complicated person , but not putin personally called him a hero . 
  they just used the facts , that he is a soviet hero, 
  kvass is not cola , drink nikola !, 
  you can find anti-american propaganda near the caucasus, 
  the numbers tells that economic situation in georgia for last 10 years is not different from armenian ( actually it became worser than in armenia ) . 
  the significiant part of their gdp is selling the nuts [ thats ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/transcaucasia_gdp_ppp_in_constant_prices_per_capita.png/1024px-transcaucasia_gdp_ppp_in_constant_prices_per_capita.png ) how `` georgian miracle '' looks like, 
   nobody checks it at each elective precinct there are cameras and observers from the opposition . 
  and they always say that from their data united russia and putin win fairly . 
  there are a lot of violations , but on the country level , it is not significant . 
  as long as putin can win elections fairly , he do n't need to falsify , i do n't know what conspiracy in it . 
  some people still believe in his '' [ huge contribution ] ( http://varlamov.ru/2357665.html?utm_source=fbsharing&amp;utm_medium=social ) '' in georgia 's economy, 
   the amount of statistics falsified around of statistical error , really . 
  as long as putin do n't need it, 
  why is it always we who should excuse for everything we ever did . 
  polish nation existed for 30 years before this invasion , 150 years before they were also under russian rule, 
  ussr is not only the ivel politics , but also the people who lived in it . 
  our parents , grandparents , at least, 
  is n't your point a propaganda too ? 
  bad soviets did bad things and now they want to save a monuments !, 
  why is it so hard to believe that for us these people were heroes that gave us chance to born . 
  it is a very important part of our history , change of dynasties ( the only one we had ) .
