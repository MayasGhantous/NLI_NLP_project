  belarus [ suffered the most ] ( http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/53874410eab8ea7e59b36468-800-/wwii-losses.png ) in ww2 . 
  there is [ good belarussian film ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/come_and_see ) about this horrible time . 
  the best way to help those people is to start talk with them , not to bomb them with nato support, 
  do check your anus, 
  he had pretty good rating before this attack , it is hard to imagine that he would n't be reelected without it . 
  who would be intreresting in this , except ukraine , really ? 
  it looks like you are just angry to russia and want to revenge it and you do n't care about people who would involved in it for no reason, 
  we need more posts like this - without a direct link to another boring article .

  i do n't see how this fact can improve relationship with finland and russia . 
  if you do n't care about this relationship , why do you care about what russia and russians think about it . 
  keep in touch, 
  that 's why they are poor ), 
  why do you ask, 
   in contrast to russia the us actually brings some benefits with them in their cultural imperialism . 
  it is just stupid to think that the russian empire did n't bring any benefits to their colonized territories . 
  neither soviet union nor modern russia are not empires . 
  you ca n't based your theory only on the fact of baltics ' accession and the recognition of referendum in crimea  when russian propaganda attacks europe it is always pointed out as a flaw that we are more tolerant and liberal but tolerance is objectively better than intolerance and liberalism is objectively better than authoritarianism . 
  it is better for you but many of your values is completely unappropriate here , i do not see that you are somehow embarrassed about it . 
  russian propaganda is easy detected and very weak compare to your . 
   russia is actively trying to make the world a worse more unstable place i do n't see it . 
  russia is trying to protect yourself, 
  it is a strong accusation . 
  will we wait for the strong , undoubtful proofs ? 
  [ yeah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbu9g6uvlk0 ) , strange story, 
  [ here ] ( https://vk.com/zentrizm ), 
  i know one but he makes videos in russian, 
  simple pro-us chauvinism , to divide world on evil and kind , on right and wrong , using propogandist terms . 
  so all discussion reduced to `` those russians who do n't support putin are ok '' or `` they are just manipulated by their government '' your are pathetic gyus . 
  this thread is an example what russophobia is really represents, 
  propably all `` civilized world '' does n't spread shit about your country 24/7 ? 
  propably, 
   russian people are our allies , and they need our help . 
  like lybian and syrian ? 
  leave your help yourself, 
  how did they know who exactly killed the journalist ? 
  mods please unite these posts, 
  protests in russia = good , progressive , brave people protests in europe = vandals , idiots , `` do these people not realise the consquences ? 
  '' , `` so fucking sad to see . '', 
  / r/europe in a nutshell, 
  how many europeans consider euler as russian scientist ? 
  i doubt that many even know about the fact that he worked in russia, 
  but the problem that it is not like critisining hitler, 
  do you have any proofs ( \u0441ompetent opinions ) about your climate part ? 
  how can you imagine that any party can impose these policies in germany ? 
  sad story, 
  important news, 
  check op 's posts, 
  without it altai would n't be in russia ) ) ), 
  how many germans at least know who is bernie sanders, 
  i do n't find it negative , people are different , it is good . 
  lol, 
  did i say something about russia ? 
  and nice arguments , bro , csgo and youtube, 
   also wtf russia ? 
  [ direct line with putin ] ( http://trinixy.ru/uploads/posts/comm_images/2016-04/1460638062_lapsha_17295857_orig_.jpeg ), 
  this is stupid , look at the gdp growth in the worst eu countries and compare it to ukrainian, 
  another attempt to ignore the reasons of this war, 
   that fought against nazis and soviets it 's kinda a myth for me that these people were exist anywhere . 
  it was n't that time when you could allow yourself to be neutral, 
  holocaust is n't genocide now ? 
  i would prefer different words . 
  words mean a lot , because the word `` atheist '' does n't mean `` i do n't believe in god '' anymore . 
  it almost always has a subtext , like you are also against religion as an institution . 
  i do n't believe in god , bud i do n't identify myself as `` atheist '' . 
  this term is injured and \u0441auses unpleasant associations, 
  but the question in this article is not historical question, 
  albanians are agressive , wild people . 
  do n't know why , but they are n't similar to other europeans . 
   volobovich i suppose volobuev . 
  and he is just an `` expert '' for the local news , who cares about his opinion here ( or in poland ) . 
  to use `` expert opinion '' for the propaganda goals is common here , the value of such opinions is zero we have a resourse that translates different foreign articles , so i know that poland also have such `` experts '' , you should understand, 
  oh you know nothing about georgia . 
  latvia and lithuania has vague prospects , outflow of population can be catastrophic . 
  captain of the germany team [ said ] ( http://tass.com/sport/954237 ) that the tournament was well organised, 
  so random, 
  why, 
  how the hell it can be upvoted ... 
  they had very talented disigners, 
  i do n't think that we should explain that majority of us are not polish nationalists, 
  almost nobody here considers stalin the same evil as hitler . 
  and we have a lot of reasons for it , both rational and irrational . 
  what else should be explained ? 
  looks more like a church, 
  parliament than never mistakes ? 
  good perspective, 
  nah , ideology does n't mean everything here . 
  mountains are at least unique . 
  but why people post here post-soviet towns that do n't differ from each other . 
  i belong to another russian risk group - i am a scientist, 
  so the gays should firstly somehow provoke our government ? 
  we do n't have direct law which would forbid being gay . 
  just a town . 
  what 's the reason to post this photo here . 
  did n't know it . 
  how do they test it ? 
  it would create a precedent , many people would pretend to be gay for asylum . 
  and the law of gay propaganda is neither hate not violence , for sure, 
  but they are not political refugees , where will they money and work,
