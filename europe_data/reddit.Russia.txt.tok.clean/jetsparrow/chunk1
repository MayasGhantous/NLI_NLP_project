  you do know that strelkov only gives updates throuth icorpus.ru ? 
  shows up as a private video for me . . 
  they pulled the video . 
  does anyone have a mirror ? 
  if you are honestly using these images not as a circlejerking aid , well , `` prove me wrong '' is a good position to have . 
  i was misled to ~ ~ think ~ ~ believe that op did n't want to discuss art , but to explain why renaming a town back to stalingrad is a bad idea . 
   nobody in this thread claims that stalin killed 1.5 bln people well thank god people are n't trying to defy physics !, 
  faith in humanity = restored ; the thread uses caricatures drawn from folklore 40 years after the fact to show how stalin was very bad . 
  all descriptions of the actual book mention that little detail , but details are too boring for reddit , and the link source never explicitly claims that these are first-hand accounts , so whoever here was misled to think otherwise has only themselves to blame . 
  calling out ** bullshit ** is a normal human reaction to ** lies ** . 
  it does n't make anyone evil , just as the fact that stalin did n't kill 1.5 bln people does n't make him a nice guy . 
  the truth is as grim as it is well-documented , yet still it 's not enough for some . 
  i wonder why . 
  you are using pornographic drawings based on folklore , made 40 years after the fact as proof of how stalin was very bad . 
  i do n't know what else am i supposed to say to you . 
   you are saying that these drawings are made up ? 
  is that why you reacted so strongly ? 
  they are supposed to be a first hand account of events they 're not ( a first hand account of events - edit ) . 
  danzig was n't working as a prison guard until well after the stalin 's purges , and could n't witness many of the things he drew . 
  besides , he was n't a labor camp guard . 
  at least that is what the catalogue of the 1995 art of the gulag exhibition by memorial-nic . org says : http://old.memorial-nic.org/iofe/42.html . 
  the drawings are said to be based on folklore and were made in the 80s . 
  it 's nothing out of the ordinary . 
  we even have fake wwii heroes . 
  edit :  corroborated many of his representations with parallel accounts from the canon of russian gulag literature . 
  well , considering the fact that he is n't a witness , of course his account is the same as the others ... 
   is there any doubt to the atrocities of stalin no , there are n't ; they are pretty well-documented . 
  but why let such petty obstacles as truth and even physics come in the way of doing the right thing and exposing more crimes of the evilestest man in history of man ? 
  as time goes on , witnesses age and die , and evidence gets lost , the number of his victim rises without bound , as is the brutality of his methods . 
  this trend of making more shit up until it 's unbelievable , and then pushing to absolutely impossible is quite a common one in russia , i 'm sick of it , and it hurts to see it go to export . 
  you have n't heard about the 5mln of homeless children in russia yet . 
  someone should put a stop to this . 
  stalin is literally worse than hitler though , he personally shot billions of innocents to death . 
  if hitler did n't attack this monster , the world would be littered with the corpses of innocents , crushed by the evil communist regime . 
  stalin is evil , while the tzars were not . 
  not enough high-ranking officials to explain the huge difference . 
  woman !, 
  go back to the kitchen !, 
  help the economy !, 
  show them russians !, 
  oppressive russia propogands poor women to work !, 
  the liberal world should not follow this oppressive practice !, 
  take women back to the kitchens !, 
  there are n't enough men dying to explain such a large difference . 
  truly uneducable . 
  i 'm done trying to see this `` issue '' from the other side . 
  obviously then the ` bad guys ' went into a buildingh and surrounded themselves with lots of flammable materials so that putler could have a chance to invade . 
  psst , man !, 
  what about some donbass ? 
  they are all vatniki anyway !, 
  that 's the same thing ukrainians said to russians that lived in crimea . 
  so they moved . 
  this is as much as fifteen tens !, 
  and then back the chain . 
  giving crimea back and forth ... 
  the same crimea ... 
  forever . 
  i mean , russia took it from the crimean khanate , a tributary of the ottoman empire . 
  so we should first give it to turkey , and then greece can do its thing . 
  you 've got to maximize the chaos . 
  * turkey, 
  ukraine should n't be complaining that it has to pay the market price for gas then , as it 's no longer a part of russia . 
  your ukrainian flag fell off . 
  simferopol is a ukrainian city !, 
  except when we decide whether or not the polite men are locals . 
   his profile lists him as being a simferopol native  and he appears to be from makiivka . 
   his hometown is listed as simferopol and photos show him in sevastopol ,  pitersky lists himself as residing in kharkiv  current city is listed as sloviansk . 
  he appears to be a local  ignat `` topaz '' kromskoy  anastasov is from simferopol . 
  i thought green men are supposed to be sent by russia ? 
  why are these people - excluding the 4 russians from irkutsk and belorechensk - even listed there ? 
  the list did n't look that impressive ? 
   general shkuro 's wolf company insignia `` wolf company '' is the cossack equivalent of berserks . 
  shkuro 's wolf company was not the only wolf company . 
  it also used different insignia . 
  a + + journalism , would read again, 
  better dead than red !!, 
  [ aaand another poll , available only to ukrainian ips ] ( http://modsite.by/allresult/#.u1qzcvl_t8e ), 
   edit : i posted my comment before the edit , does n't make sense anymore . 
  you 're right , sorry , it was only paid for by the ukrainian media . 
   ukraine is spreading * fascist * propaganda lies . 
  i would n't go so far . 
  ukraine is supposedly at war , so the media ca n't be blamed for spreading misinformation, 
  typical poll by the ukrainian media . 
  not long ago [ only 43 % of the population of crimea were in favor of joining russia . 
  ] ( http://censor.net.ua/news/275026/v_ukraine_net_ni_odnogo_regiona_jiteli_kotorogo_vystupali_by_za_obedinenie_s_rossieyi_opros ) the referendum clearly showed this to be not true , with 96 % voting in favor of joining , and only [ 3 thousand people rejecting russian citizenship ] ( http://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/1681097.html ) . 
  of course , any sane person understands that the polite people simply murdered any and all local residents that were against the reunion of crimea and russi . 
  last i heard this was usually the mo of the opposition to accuse putin & co edit : i posted my comment before the edit , does n't make sense anymore . 
  sorry , i did n't realize you used the word `` bot '' in the literal sense , and not as '' `` kremlebot '', 
  you did n't even understand what he said . . 
  russian troops were in crimea since 1776 . 
  how is this news ? 
  absolutely . 
  couldn \\ t find the comments section on cracked.gov, 
  lol, 
  some seem to forget that the source of their news are actual living people . 
   ~ ~ local journalist said ~ ~ 1 post on somebody 's wall on facebook . 
  cheap . 
  in other news , local journalist ( me on my vkontakte page lol jk ) said something else .
