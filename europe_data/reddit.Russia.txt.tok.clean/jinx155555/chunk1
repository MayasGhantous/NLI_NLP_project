i am against the war . 
  i am against yanukovich . 
  i am against the nazgvardia . 
  i am against the young fools going from rostov to donbas to fight for money . 
  i am against the death of young ukrainian soldiers whos mothers buy them bulletproof vests in hopes that they survive . 
  i am against poroshenko and all the other oligarchs with their little private armies . 
  i am against freaking klitschko as mayor of kiev . 
  i am against those sorry sons of bitches who went from russia to ukraine and put up russian flags . 
  i am against the tank standing in the ogorod of my friend 's dacha with a swastika and `` deutschland uber alles '' spray painted on it ( funny situation , they are scared that the pro-russians will find out and will bomb the tank to shit along with the dacha ) . 
  those things i am undoubtedly against . 
  but putin is way too complicated . 
  his foreign policies apply to much more than just ukraine . 
  and call me brainwashed , but imho , the current state of affairs in ukraine is definitely not part of his plan . 
  he is a politician , an occupation which requires for one to be dirty from the start to have some success . 
  see that 's the problem . 
  my political affiliation should n't matter but still . 
  i have a complicated view on putin . 
  sometimes , i simply love what he does on the international arena ( plz read on ) , the speeches he makes are those which the west has to hear . 
  he does n't say them for the russians ( because its usually the popular opinion anyways ) , but he says it to those that do n't hear anything else but their own everyday propaganda . 
  but then there is things he does internally . 
  i mean , holy shit . 
  the most recent fuck-you-average-citizen thing would be the [ rotenberg 's law ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%97%d0%b0%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%bd_%d0%a0%d0%be%d1%82%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b1%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b3%d0%b0 ) they are trying to pass ( sorry only found the russian wiki ) . 
  it pretty much says that all the rich oligarchs that lost money due to sanctions and frozen bank accounts will get compenstation from the gosbudget ( taxpayers ) . 
  i am also very much against the laws he signed regarding adoption cause that really destroys the opportunity for orphans to live a better life ( even if its outside of rf ) . 
  comedians would joke for months when his puppet medvedev called a meeting to ensure the `` prevention of corruption '' . 
  reports of him finding treasure while scuba diving or catching a 20kg fish when in the video its definitely less , and other cases of macho bullshit are always a topic for sarcastic remarks . 
  and this is all on state controlled television . 
  he has created a retarted situation where if you are not for edinaya rossiaya ( his party ) , then you are fucked . 
  you wont get any money , your budgets will be cut and all of a sudden all of your criminal activities reach the surface . 
  was in yaroslavl ' a short while back and the newly elected mayor was already in jail for `` suspicion of bribery '' , coincidentally the guy was for spravedlivaya rossiya ( a rival party ) . 
  i could go on and on and on , but the truth remains , there is no one better than him atm . 
  if he were to die , russia ( and other reliant states ) would collapse into chaos that was the 90 's . 
  if i was told `` go vote for a new president , the candidates are the same as last time , '' i would vote for putin . 
  there is no ` good ' alternative . 
  the others are either puppets or simply not fit to run our country which needs someone like an ex-kgb or whatnot to run it . 
  sorry for the long answer but i was actually trying to keep this as short as possible at the same time . 
  ya but when everyone has that one distant relative from ukraine ( which is surprisingly common ) , this stuff becomes our worry too . 
  i do not believe that a person 's nationality can disallow someone to be friends with each other . 
  having grown up in an international environment i 've had a myriad of best friends from countries that hate us . 
  finnish , afghan , german ( who 's grandpa served against russians in ww2 ) , american , etc. 
  met a guy a month back from lviv and we get along just fine . 
   western ukraine , even though it 's orthodox and uses cyrillic , feels kind of like poland sometimes too . 
  no kidding haha, 
  only if you let politics dictate your social life . 
  i personally do not know any belorussians so i would n't know . 
  on the other hand i know loads of ukrainians and finding out our nationalities has always been a reason for undisputed friendship . 
  hell , my flatmate is ukrainian . 
  that guys is n't important enough to be killed for disliking putin . 
  for moscow i would have to say it 's saint basil 's cathedral http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint_basil's_cathedral for europe outside of russia , it 's a tie between the colosseum ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/colosseum ) and the eiffel tower ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/eiffel_tower ) for me . 
  there were international observers : http://finance.yahoo.com/news/international-observers-crimean-referendum-strongly-183400247.html also , if there had been any sort of violent or hostile behaviour from the soldiers it would be all over the internet by now , instead we have this : http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=4c1_1394012341&amp;comments=1 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2571799/shocking-pictures-people-crimea-taking-selfies-russian-masked-gunmen-ukraine-teeters-brink-war.html, 
  * can incorrect . 
  my argument stems from the fact that we never invaded in the first place . 
  with the referendum the people decided for themselves . 
  crimeans were quick to act because they already went through hell with this back in '91 when neither russia nor ukraine wanted them and they became sovereign for a short while . 
  had novorossia done the same thing , there would n't be an armed conflict happening in the east . 
  see , you see him saying `` we invaded '' , i see `` we had troops in crimea ensuring peace '' . 
  i do not live in russia . 
  i am not what you might call `` isolated '' . 
  i go on reddit for gods sake . 
  i live in the uk , my tv does n't have rt. 
  edit : hahaha even this comment got downvoted, 
  there is equipment which , as you say , has raison d'\u00eatre to find these submarines . 
  and they been successful in the past : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_submarine_incidents http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_submarine_s-363, 
   defend the sovereign rights of our brave troops stationed there the troops were the `` concerned citizens '', 
  i 'm confused , that video literally speaks nothing of crimea, 
  i was about ask whether it happened before but googled it first and holy crap . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_submarine_incidents http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_submarine_s-363 til why this may seem possible to you guys without much proof for it . 
   that is not a good source . 
  globalresearch.ca is a conspiracy theorist site : its editor is an anti-semite and a 9/11 truther . 
  not surprising that this is a conspiracy to him as well . 
  wow . 
  did n't know that . 
  sorry but cant be assed cause i have an essay to finished for tomorrow . 
  but thanks for informing me on that one . 
  it 's not uncommon that young men would sneak off for better pay ( as in you serve for free in russia cause it 's compulsory ) . 
  they got paid 1k euro per month which is huge . 
  no , and we find it funny that you trust yours without any proof . 
  the `` polite soldiers '' ( as we call them ) came from the military base and were there not to take over governmental buildings or shoot at ukrainian natsgvardia , but to ensure the peace . 
  i would n't call that `` invading ukraine '' especially since the land has belonged to russia until it was illegally handed over to ukraine back in the 50s . 
   you seem to have answered to the wrong comment . 
  this one was about how putin said fascism is on the rise in latvia . 
  no , in that comment i was replying to a person who had linked the same article as you . 
  i 'm pretty sure the nato satellite images have been debunked ( a quick google search gave me [ this ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/big-lies-risk-confrontation-with-russia/5398285 ) but i 'm sure there are better ) 10 soldiers is a bloody joke , you ca n't seriously claim that they are part of the `` invasion '' force that russia sent into ukraine . 
  this is as much of sensationalism as when canada expelled all of the russian soldiers from the country ( which was like 8 people ) . 
   russian officials are n't denying direct military involvement in ukraine links please !, 
  the fact that there are a lot of contractors working for 1k euros a month is well known here but that is not `` direct military involvement '' . 
  i literally googled what you said and even the bullshit resources are saying that there are russians in ukraine `` while repeatedly denying direct involvement in the warfare . '', 
  link ? 
  that 's paradoxical . 
  we had a military base there in the first place . 
  there was literally nothing ? 
  it 's kind of hard to hide a trespassing submarine , especially a `` damaged '' one . 
  it 's in quotations because i do not believe an * invasion * happened ( as you may have noticed since you replied to another one of my other comments ) . 
  in response to putin 's `` accusations '' : http://forward.com/articles/194652/latvian-nazi-ss-veterans-march-in-annual-riga-para/ `` a destroyed t-72 tank , which ** presumably ** came from russia '' - ah , so a tank made in russia ( just like most of ukraine 's military equipment ), 
  and yet the submarine was never found and the `` radio signals '' never revealed to the public . 
  a red herring , nothing more . 
  article date of publishing : 13:56 17/08/2005 might as well use something from back in the soviet times . 
   putin admitted he had lied and actually had invaded ukraine . 
  please provide sources for this, 
  so invasion is more appropriate ?
