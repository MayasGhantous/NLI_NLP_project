  there would be a lot more than sanctions placed on us in that case . 
  and it would n't be the ukrainian army bombing the shit out of civilian structures in eastern ukraine if we were actually invading . 
  as far as anyone in russia is aware , we are not about to `` invade '' the baltic states . 
  `` putin saying how fascism is on the rise in estonia and latvia . '', 
  i was not aware of this , please provide with a quote so that i may doubt his mental stability . 
  and `` invasion of ukraine '' without proof of an actual invasion , well , it 's a paradox . 
  why would people be [ so upset ] ( http://theweek.com/speedreads/index/258069/speedreads-russias-troop-buildup-near-the-ukraine-border-is-making-everyone-nervous ) with us having troops near the ukrainian border when we apparently invaded the country already anyways . 
  show me a photo/video/article showing ** concrete ** evidence of us invading a country . 
  as far as i 'm aware , we did n't sabotage the ship . 
  mental stability would be better . 
  for people who seem to be so against our `` attack on ukraine '' , warmongering seems part of your daily routine towards us . 
  best part is , we did n't even say anything , but y' all are ready to attack . 
  yes i know of such people . 
  my best friend 's father took the entire family to latvia to get out of russia . 
  but this is because the man did a lot of illegal things in the 90s and it was catching up to him . 
  they 're living much worse now than they did back in moscow but they plan on leaving as soon as they get citizenship . 
  ya but we are n't foreigners there , 
  yep, 
  oh god thank you !, 
  now i have an actual example , which i 've never thought of before , when trying to explain to my russian friends that i 'm not being serious when `` insulting '' them . 
  that 's a really weird one too . 
  i never realized what yob tvayu mat ' means until you said it in english . 
  weird , the decoder i just used gave me ( seemingly correct with a few letters missing ) : \u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438 , \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430 , 119415 \u043f.\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043e , 37 , \u043a .1817 -1 . 
  \u041f\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0435\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0435 did you actually just type all of that code yourself ? 
  the red pen is the `` de-coding '' . 
  sometimes cyrillic letters come out as a bunch of those letters with umlauts . 
  i 'm impressed someone went through the trouble of actually typing each letter into the decoder to get the real text . 
  a great example of the would be any `` yo mama '' jokes . 
  you cant insult a relative here and get away with it cause you were n't being serious . 
  depends on what `` good '' is . 
  it 's good because it 's next to a forest ( serebryaniy bor ) , there is n't that much crime ( only had my car radio stolen back in 2002 ) , there are malls not too far away . 
  my biggest complaint is the fact that it is far away from the metro . 
  ya my friend is in the money haha , tourist are some of the most gullible folk , 
  glad you think so , it 's definitely worth the visit imho . 
  [ north-west moscow ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fcfzmo4.jpg ) [ also my friend 's place near the center ] ( http://i.imgur.com/chkavic.jpg ), 
  well as a person who has travelled quite a bit i can say that homophobia and racism exist everywhere . 
  we have more openly homosexual celebrities than i can think of elsewhere ( and they are popular with certain people ) . 
  i do not see oppression . 
  putin 's foreign policy is fine by me , it is the internal stuff that i am unsatisfied with . 
  the elections are going to be in 2016 so i think it 's a bit too soon to assume anything but personally , if a decent replacement does not show up , then he will probably win . 
  he keeps a strong monopoly over the possible candidates and i believe that will be his downfall when he becomes too old . 
  these are obviously not the opinions of every single person in russia but just mine personally . 
  i got into a huge argument the other week with a couple of '' the opposition '' supporters . 
  i could have a huge discussion and elaborate on things but it would be much easier if i spoke it out rather than wrote it . 
  also as another comment says , an ask russians on / r/russia will give a very wide range of answers . 
  we usually do n't down vote `` unpopular '' opinions unless it 's blatant trolling . 
  not the same guy but i personally am in awe at how western redditors are brainwashed to believe that `` russians are brainwashed '' . 
  even reading the comments here saying `` ya , russians would like this poster , they totally love war and putin makes them jizz '' . 
  it is definitely spice, 
  speaking from the point of view of a muscovite : the metro and other public transport is very cheap and fairly accessible . 
  the amount of traffic in the city and the desparate lack of parking spaces ( until recently ) scares some people away from getting a car of their own . 
  also cars are really expensive here , not just to buy but to keep the winter tires and servicing . 
  would have that as my cover photo if i was ukrainian . 
  that is beautiful . 
  our ips are banned ? 
  where ? 
  i personally believe recovering crimea was more than enough . 
  in moscow we have quite a few similar ones [ mgu university ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:moscow_state_university_crop.jpg ) [ ministery of foreign affairs ] ( http://transsibirskamagistrala.cz/stalinovy_veze/7_sedm_stalinovych_sester_ministerstvo_zahranicnich_veci_moskva_stalinovy_veze_mrakodrapy.jpg ) and [ the seven sisters ] ( http://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ihhdb7uch-8/up9c0fjijfi/aaaaaaacdgk/wpgl1zt4wjm/s900/aa30.jpg ), 
  i believe that 's sochi, 
  + / u/dogetipbot 74 doge verify, 
  fearmongery through selective images . 
  our media is constantly accused of spreading false propaganda but this is just wow . 
  [ that communist comrade babushka certainly looks fierce . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hjg1q3k.jpg ) 9 out of 11 pictures here are of the cprf which only represents one political party . 
  you sound like a cool guy, 
  and maybe some people from the muslim parts . 
  i wonder how they got these survey results . 
  these parallels you guys keep making comparing putin to hitler and russia to nazi germany are not very fair or even slightly reasonable . 
  or you know ... try work shit out and move forwards ** together ** towards a brighter future . 
  but that 's just my opinion . 
  the difference is whether it 's your country or not, 
  omg our state owned channels are pro-government !!!, 
  the air forces stuff is just some banter as you say . 
  by georgia i 'm assuming the events of august 2008 when georgian troops entered and shelled south ossetia and then got their asses handed to them . 
  gas embargo you 'll have to be more specific . 
  if it is the recent hints putin was throwing in response to possible sanctions against our country 's economy then i believe that is very much justifiable , you screw us - we screw you back . 
  the armless ukrainians you talk of pelted police with molotov cocktails for weeks and tortured captured berkut on tape . 
  also the ukrainian corruption is with their government and their people 's fault for voting them in ( or corruptly buying their way in ) , saying that it is somehow our responsibility should grant us full rights to take care of it ourselves then without the rest getting pissed off at russia for interfering with a sovereign country 's politics . 
  not a single display of ` meddling ' has been reported on any news on the crimean vote . 
  funny how people on maidan with guns are `` unarmed protestors '' whilst people with guns in crimea are obviously bloodthirsty thugs . 
  if you compare the number of deaths on maidan to that of the whole crimea , you will be pleasantly surprised . 
  had any unlawful vote manipulation gone down , the west would have been broadcasting it 24/7 . 
  ( godfuckingdammit i didnt want to discuss crimea ) . 
  iskander missiles stationed on russian soil are apparently illegal with sources saying thta they [ have been there for 18 months now ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/16/us-russia-missiles-idusbre9bf0w020131216 ) . 
  having checked on wikipedia , crimea became predominantly russian not too long after 1897 by which time russians were at 33.11 % whilst the tatars were 35.55 % . 
  i guess you could be angry at the russians for grabbing control of a region in 1783 that belonged to the ottomans ... which in turn previously belonged to [ scytho-sarmatians , goths , hunnics , turkics , mongols , its southern fringe under successive roman , byzantine , italian and ottoman turkish control . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_crimea#ethnic_groups ) the last part with ukraine 's willingness to join the soviet union i do not know even after checking on wikipedia , but they seemed to have profited greatly from it being the second most powerful ( economically and politically ) in the union with it 's territory almost getting doubled . 
  you can check their history in [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_soviet_socialist_republic#before-after ) actually . 
  upvoted, 
  the worst ( to europe ) we will do is move our economy 's focus east . 
  everyone knows that if we start a war it 'll be the last one on this planet . 
  and if anyone 's getting invaded , it might be the country that is surrounded on all sides by nato ` peacekeeping ' bases which only escalate tensions . 
   putin and/or soviet sceptic , society  rebuilding cccp, 
  politically i am more pro-putin than against him ( on different issues ) , does that mean i 'm lying about not wanting to invade europe ? 
  cause all putin supporters are evil ? 
  does cooperation with neighboring countries ( which used to be part of the union ) = the return of the soviet union ? 
  putin is not even communist . 
  there are western countries that have more socialist politicians in power than us ( looking at germany ) . 
  stop playing cod to get your facts on russia 's goals . 
  if your neighboring country had a government overthrown with a significant part of the population going hostile against your country , having troops at the border might not seem like such a bad idea .
