  meanwhile , the ukrainian army is more than happy to use the fury over the death of eu civilians as political cover as it intensifies its artillery attacks on civilian populations . 
  the man is a neo-nazi involved in ongoing violence against civilian populations . 
  if anything you should be terrified that the nazis of europe are fighting their own little personal war in the east , and should want to expose them all !, 
  name me a single government that has n't done the same , these are regular acts of war . 
  terrorism is the targeting of civilian populations to incite terror . 
  how many cities have the separatists used artillery and blockades against ? 
  the maidan 's ukraine certainly is n't innocent . 
  the government of ukraine is infact the one targeting civilian populations indiscriminately , which is the definition of terrorism . 
  the separatists fight a military and mercenaries , ukraine 's army bombards schools , hospitals , and apartment blocks . 
  no matter how many times ukrainian state propaganda calls the rebellion terrorist , it simply will not be . 
  sure , you can take a page out of the playbook of the us state department and use the word so many times it loses any meaning , but anybody with a mind of their own will see the propaganda for what it is . 
  how does it support these sophisticated manufacturing industries ? 
  and where does all of its raw resources come from ? 
  germany does n't have the resources or the labor reserves to provide the products it does whilst also providing the standard of living it does all on its own . 
  how much of its consumption is sourced from developing nations who are coerced into selling at huge losses ? 
  on its own germany would be a poor house like any other developing nation , but thanks to the past five hundred years of european imperialism , it has places like se asia to provide for its basics at artificially low prices , made possible only off of the exploited labor of hundreds of millions , and consequently , * all the emissions associated with that production * . 
  the developed world extracts trillions of dollars of wealth from the developing world every year . 
  angela merkel is nothing but the continuation of that heritage . 
  she may have an endearing smile but she is no true humanitarian nor is she an environmentalist . 
  she is a capitalist , through and through . 
  she knows where her bread comes from and at what cost . 
  so when will she get behind the cessation of exporting the european emissions load to southeast asia in the form of production ? 
  the only end to climate change is an end to capitalism . 
  she just wants to secure european hegemony over cheap labor for another 100 years . 
   just admit you pulled a list of lies made by fanatical idiots and screwed up . 
  it 'll be more painless that way . 
  please , do tell me , how it is so much of a lie that the us killed 1 million people in the phillipines in the interest of capitalism ? 
  how 250,000 people have committed suicide in india because of hostile actions taken by business firms ? 
  how 2 million people died in vietnam due to a famine created by the french ? 
  how tens of millions have n't been killed in india at the hands of british colonialism ? 
  how a million communists were not brutally massacred in indonesia by a capitalist puppet ? 
  how the 6 million dead in a war over mining interests in the congo simply did n't die ? 
  how * every day * 30,000 people die of starvation in this capitalist wonderland you defend so blindly ? 
  the list is long , and it 's not going away . 
  i 'm sorry , i do n't engage with the ideologically revolting . 
  it 's a waste of time to try and change the mind of someone so attached to something , that they 'll place the blame of the deaths of millions on the assassination of one insignificant duke instead of the competing colonial and economic interests of massive empires with shared borders and strained resources , instead of admitting that people die because of it . 
  if you think the war was as simple as the assassination of the archduke then i should n't bother with you much further . 
  if you think wwii was not undertaken as a war to increase the economic power of german capitalism , then you are naive . 
   i do n't deny the events occurred , im saying they have fuck-all to do with capitalism . 
  capitalism is global , and we live in a political economy . 
  there is n't much that goes on which is n't directly tied to capitalism . 
  it 's like blaming wars of succession on something other than a monarchy , what you 're doing !, 
  communism is still active today , but your rules only serve to obfuscate and * apologize * for outright murder . 
  i adhered to them ( ridiculous and arbitrary as they were ) loosely as a courtesy . 
  but it 's shown that you 're no better than a holocaust denier . 
  in the same breath you outright deny crimes against humanity in defense of a system that would murder you and your family if you got in the way of a serious profit , and then claim to have humanity 's best interests at heart !, 
  you could n't even give a proper definition of capitalism or communism if asked , i would guess !, 
   world war 1 ? 
  are you kidding ? 
  because clearly capitalism was the cause of serbs assassinating the duke and europe 's alliances ? 
  that world was run by capitalists , and that war was fought in their interests . 
  if you think the war was as simple as the assassination of the archduke then i should n't bother much further . 
  30,000 people died yesterday of starvation . 
  10 million a year . 
  100 million a decade . 
  that 's just * preventable * deaths by starvation ; production is up to par and despite what people say , if resources were appropriately managed distribution is also possible . 
  never mind preventable deaths due to disease and other forms of capital mismanagement .

  ) : 1 million trade unionists assassinated in colombia ( c.1990-present ) : 4,000 that 's a short list , hastily compiled . 
  limiting me to the 1900 's is n't much help for your cause , but rest assured , going back into the 1700s the list grows by hundreds of millions . 
  and capitalists have killed more by far than communists . 
  yet one is called an unspeakable crime against humanity and the other the best we can possibly do for ourselves !, 
  it 's interesting that you posted this in a two month old thread and already have two downvotes in ten hours . 
  i suspect the involvement of bots to censor anyone that is n't explicitly pro-maidan . 
  who else would be reading this thread two months later ? 
  and now they 're bombing hospitals and residential blocks . 
  who was supposed to be labelled terrorist , again ? 
  woohoo hoo , look who 's so smart , you even have a snazzy graph to tell you how to play pretend !, 
  you 're just so beyond self-awareness that it 's no longer amusing . 
  i simply said that the ussr was more complex than the reagan-fed propaganda land of gulags and bread lines you seem to think it was . 
  then you brought in comparisons to nazi sympathizing and hysterical tirades against vague ideals and lauding the supposedly superior human rights of `` other nations '' . 
  if i ca n't talk about any of the good things the ussr did because * gulags and bread lines hurr durr * , then you can not by any rights compare the ussr poorly to any other nation , particularly those imperial nations of the first world . 
   so save me the fallacies . 
  i 'm sorry , i ca n't save you from something you seem to inhale of your own free will . 
   and the ussr never managed to match the rights and respect given to humans , something that 's called human rights . 
  whenever those humans are n't european , the eu does n't give two shits about them . 
  the eu enjoys its wages , consumption , and standards of living off of the broken , exploited , starving backs of billions of third world workers . 
  do n't turn this into that kind of game , europe is just as bloodied . 
  you just happen to live in it . 
   i 've personally spoken to people who have suffered under that system . 
  i know that i 've spoken to more people who continue to suffer under capitalism . 
  it 's quite obvious that your mind is drowning in propaganda and hyperbole . 
  you jump to the defensive , likening me to a nazi sympathizer and immediately deny any and all possibilities that life in the ussr was n't all that bad . 
  you 're right glorious capitalist freedom fighter , the ussr was a wretched shit-hole full of worse than nazis . 
  after all , solzhenitsyn and the evening news told you so !, 
  the west * still has n't managed * to match the rights and respect given to women by the ussr , and the ussr does n't even exist anymore . 
  what must really rustle your jimmies is the fact that those rights had to be pried from the cold dead hands of capitalists and western sympathizers that you sent 18 armies in to prop up . 
  and i suppose you think it was gulags on every corner with a breadline in between each ? 
  let them secede . 
  sweden had its own rebellious provinces once , and now your nation is much smaller . 
  no matter how much media ignores it , there is a legitimate case to be made against the legitimacy of the ukranian government , especially from the point of view of the separatist provinces , and especially as time goes further along . 
  here 's the footage of the ukranian government controlled su-25 firing the rockets that killed those in the video and several others , all civilians . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3wbxkr0rj0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hluinnxfxfk&amp;feature=youtu.be they call the separatists terrorists , and then turn around to sanction attacks on the civilian populace . 
  most media is blaming the deaths on the incompetent handling of a manpad by separatists , but there are several locations that were hit and footage of the su-25 firing into the city . 
  i 'd call the one in the ussr a coup . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_union_referendum,_1991 its fall most certainly was n't a victory for democracy , it was a mockery of it . 
  joe biden 's son has been appointed to the board of ukraine 's top gas producer , burisma holdings . 
  nato now has a shadow of an excuse to keep existing as poland and the baltic states are going into paranoia overdrive . 
  the eu is looking to the usa as a possible alternative for energy supplies .
