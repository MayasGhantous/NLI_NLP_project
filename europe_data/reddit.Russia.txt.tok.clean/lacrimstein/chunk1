communism, 
  putin . 
   you basically kicked out one evil corrupt piece of shit so you can vote another one in and you are willing to die for them also which is the saddest part repeat five times , and you have a summary of ukraine 's history for the past 20 years . 
  i do n't know , i can read and understand what is written here ( http://isv.wikinet.org/wiki/glavna_stranica ) almost as easily as russian . 
  ukrainian , bulgarian , serbian , etc. 
  are fairly easy for me as well . 
  i can even understand a good amount of written polish , given enough time ( 10-15 minutes per paragraph ) . 
  russian vocabulary is huge though , so while it encompasses most of common slavic vocab , it also has a lot of its own that 's not common for other slavs maybe ? 
  they were a joke . 
  it 's a parody of us officials ' statements about russia ( the first sentence , for example , is a reference to john kerry : `` you just do n't in the 21st century behave in 19th century fashion by invading another country '' ), 
  sorry , no it 's not . 
  as someone who hates hip-hop , i really liked `` my slowianie '' . 
  i think the english part they added for eurovision ruined the song a bit . 
  a song about slavs should be sung only in slavic  i do n't like this song though ... 
  why is this downvoted ? 
  and you guys complain about `` russian shills '' ...

  just believe me - not everything is so straightforward . 
  nobody wants to separate [ from ukraine ] '' comment on the post : `` hohol [ slang for ukrainian ] forgot to re-login ) '', 
  you 're sick . 
  i mentioned this in the comments already , but yatsenyuk , one of the current leaders installed by maidan , was participating in this as well . 
  i 'm sure many people were at maidan with good intentions , but i believe yatsenyuk , tyagnibok , etc. 
  were all in us 's pockets . 
  i feel bad for ukraine , which is currently being torn apart by what i think are minorities from both pro-western and pro-russian sides , but in a way its their own fault . 
  imo the great tragedy of eastern european `` democracies '' , like ukraine and russia , is that the majority of the population just does n't give a fuck about who 's in power , as long as they are n't directly affected, 
  this was a while back , but everyone 's current favorite ukrainian freedom fighter , arseniy petrovych yatsenyuk , [ was present there as well ] ( http://uainside.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/yatsen-.png ) . 
  question : why is the audio so clean , with almost no background noises , especially since some conversations are supposedly taking place outdoors ? 
  however , when one of the persons on the phone asks someone who 's with him a question ( `` what street is this ? '' ), 
  he 's conveniently heard very clear as well . 
  and why are voices split between left and right channels ? 
  ( listen to it in headphones , very easy to notice : one person is on the left , other on the right ) . 
  i think this is a fake . 
  there 's been a lot of shit like this both from ukrainian and russian net-warriors lately . 
  hard to take this seriously . 
  this article is yet another `` ukraine is the real russia , while ` russia ' ( who really is a race of aliens from outer space ) is trying to steal ukraine 's glorious culture and history and pass them off as its own to look european '' bullshit . 
  i 've been silent about this conflict so far , since i do n't want to participate in the information war . 
  i know i 'll get a lot of downvotes , and a lot more angry responses , many of which will be directed at my flair , and not even touch the contents of my post . 
  please do n't call me a `` russian shill '' , i am not . 
  i travel between russia and the us pretty often ( i 'm in the us right now , actually ) , and i like to think of myself having a somewhat more independent point of view than a lot of russians and americans . 
  i am aware of what my country has done in the past , and that it is not an innocent bystander in this conflict , no need to lecture me on that . 
  many countries , and especially in europe , have plenty of dark pages in their history books , not just russia . 
  everyone needs to get out of that `` russia = ultimate evil '' mindset and stop the hivemind groupthink . 
  please , think for yourself , do your own research , and form your own opinion . 
  here follows my own personal opinion , which i present to you as a rhetorical question : why is it so difficult to believe that some people do n't want to be part of not only one of the poorest ( only kosovo and moldova are poorer ) , but also one of the most ( if not the most ) politically unstable countries in europe ? 
  maybe they do n't want to be part of a country that left the ussr as an agricultural and industrial powerhouse , and instead of prospering , pissed it all away ? 
  maybe they do n't want to live in a country where the government is overthrown by a mob every time the government makes a decision that one part of the country does n't like ? 
  do people actually think ukraine is heaven compared to russia ? 
  is the idea that `` russia = ultimate evil '' that has been drilled into everyone 's head for the past 100 years really that strong ? 
  i 've been frequenting russian-speaking websites ( read : shared by russians , belarussians , ukrainians , and other nationalities of the former ussr ) , and the amount of shit ( lies , propaganda , speculations , conspiracy theories ) from both the ukrainian and russian sides are astronomical . 
  frequently i find this shit finding ways into english-speaking media , and most of the time , pro-ukrainian content is believed word-for-word , while pro-russian content is publicly shown as examples of `` russian shills '' and `` russian propaganda '' , and that strikes me as quite unfair . 
  there were 2 options : 1 ) become part of russia 2 ) remain part of ukraine , but as an autonomy while it 's questionable that a third option was n't included ( that maintains status quo ) , it 's quite far from `` no option to not be part of russia '' that ukrainian internet warriors are so hysterical about . 
  precisely this . 
  a lot of russians support putin because of his hard stance against the west . 
  so , russia 's government heavily relies on nationalism for support , and in a way , the west 's actions over the past 20 years are responsible for the presence of such nationalism . 
  after the fall of ussr , russia should have been immediately offered a path into the eu , or some close eu-russia structure . 
  russia should have been embraced and welcomed as a friend , like other former ussr republics . 
  the treatment of russia after the fall of ussr in some ways reminds me of post-wwi germany , and we all know how that ended up . 
  geopolitics, 
  that self-proclaimed nazi 's post that you linked is just as representative of all russians as `` banderovtsi '' are of all ukrainians . 
  the exchange that you linked ( i do n't agree with either of you two ) , the fact that you used a statement by someone who is obviously an extremist to prove your point , and completely ignored the fact that there are also pockets of nationalistic hatred similar to your example , except towards russia , in ukraine , poland , latvia , lithuania , estonia lead me to believe that you 're not exactly `` neutral '' yourself . 
  the second cartoon is just a creepy web animation ( similar to salad fingers - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oykmawhkwhc if you 're curious ) , definitely not for kids . 
  '' \u0401\u0436\u0438\u043a \u0432 \u0422\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0435 '' is a classic , but i would n't really call it a kids cartoon either - i thought it was boring when i was a kid . 
  even we russians do n't know . 
  it 's a fairly old philosophical debate : '' \u0423\u043c\u043e\u043c \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c , \u0410\u0440\u0448\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c : \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c -- \u0412 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c '' translation : `` russia can not be understood by mind , can not be fathomed by a common measure , it has a unique trait - russia can only be believed in '' - f. tyutchev , 1866, 
  same thing happened during the russo-georgian war in 2008 . 
  there were reports of russian troops occupying entire georgia , of planes carpet bombing tbilisi , etc. 
  once the war was over , it turned out those reports were a load of shit . 
  good question . 
  there already was a war in the region in 1992 ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991%e2%80%931992_south_ossetia_war ) , after which a peacekeeping mission was created , so russia did have diplomatic grounds to participate in the war . 
  also , 10 soldiers from the russian peacekeeping force ( at the time neutral ) were killed in the initial attack by georgians on tshinval in 2008 . 
  in my personal opinion , an attack on a nation 's soldiers can be read as a declaration of war . 
  the real controversy is that russia took the fight outside south ossetia into main georgia , and set up a buffer zone around the border . 
  by doing so , it overstepped its peacekeeping mandate . 
  however , russian command claimed that georgian forces retreated into georgia , but continued bombardment of south ossetia from there , so russia was in the right to neutralize them . 
  so there 's that . 
  as someone who lived both in russia and the us , and having exposure to both points of view i find this article offensively biased . 
  just reading the last paragraph makes my jaw drop :  there is a kind of rough justice in the timing of ukraine 's turmoil . 
  in 2008 russia invaded georgia , its tiny southern neighbour , just as the olympic games began in beijing , prompting formulaic western protests but no meaningful retribution . 
  the events in kiev interrupted the winter olympics in sochi , intended to be a two-week carnival of putinism . 
  this time the west must make mr putin see that , with this havoc at the heart of europe , he has gone too far . 
  georgia started that war by bombarding a city . 
  western media , however , did n't cover this story ( since georgia is a us ally ) , and instead tried to pass it off as a russian invasion of georgia ( some even tried to claim that it was the russians who were bombing tshinval , like the infamous fox news interview ) . 
  as the story became clearer , western media agreed that yes , georgia started the war , but it 's still russia 's fault because they `` tricked '' georgia into attacking . 
  `` two-week carnival of putinism '' - wtf is that ? 
  it makes just as much sense as calling the 2012 london olympics a `` two-week carnival of cameronism '' . 
  i have n't seen any putinism in the olympics besides nbc announcers shoving the idea of it down everyone 's throats instead of actually , you know , covering the games . 
  yes , of course every country hosting the olympics wants to make itself look good . 
  the leader of the country has nothing to do with it . 
  `` putinism '' has become such a buzz-word over the past month , with everyone and their grandmother regurgitating it ad-nauseum . 
  shows just how much power media has over people by carefully placed catch-phrases . 
  anyway , what 's currently happening in ukraine is entirely yanukovich 's fault for trying to sit in two chairs . 
  do n't blame russia . 
  classic ukrainian excuse : `` our country [ ukraine ] and people are perfect , the reason x is fucked up is because it 's external factor y 's fault '' . 
  however , i wish ukrainians the best , and that ukraine does become part of eu . 
  who knows , maybe in the distant future my country will follow as well . 
  i 'd much rather have a russia that 's not really relevant , but part of europe , instead of a russia that 's king of central asia . 
  to be fair , [ shit like this ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/15/russian-children-coloring-book_n_4282899.html ) is n't helping . 
  a couple of thoughts : 1 ) when and where were these photos taken ?
