  an explanation of each would have been nice . 
  2 ) were all photos originally black and white ? 
  if you look carefully , some of these photographs are actually fairly neutral , and a couple are pretty happy . 
  you can change the mood of an image very easily just by messing around with colors and contrast . 
  just look at the beach photo ( # 18 ) - there is absolutely nothing negative about it , but at first glance it looks like a group of lost souls haunting a marsh or something . 
  to me , this album looks a lot more `` carefully selected '' than englishrussia - in fact , i think i 've seen a couple of these photos on englishrussia before . 
  i 'm not defending the ussr ( i was 1 year old when it collapsed , so i do n't remember anything ) , but given some time , anyone can put together a similar collection for any country in the world . 
  german music is quite popular in the russia , it 's just a bit `` underground '' . 
  i myself used to love rammstein , lacrimosa , oomph ! , kmfdm when i was younger ( btw , lacrimosa + rammstein = lacrimstein ! ) . 
  nowadays a decent amount of metal i listen to is german : blind guardian , die apokalyptischen reiter , helloween to name a few . 
  and of course , there 's scorpions . 
   i think all russians are one vkontakte instead ? 
  you are correct !, 
  hide yo kids , hide yo wife, 
  russian for a french person is `` frantsuz '' . 
  sounds pretty similar to `` prantsus '' , maybe one language borrowed it from another and the pronunciation changed a bit ? 
  `` venemaa '' / `` boat land '' makes some sense , since `` rus '' apparently means `` rowers '' . 
  ironically , the russian navy has historically always been terrible . 
  most of us are n't bad , 
  i 'm ashamed to see ukraine a victim of economic terrorism conducted by my country , but i 'd be more worried about the us getting involved in this . 
  i hope ukraine does n't follow the `` internal conflict -  us declaring the least american-friendly side as illegitimate -  liberate ^ tm '' model that almost happened in syria . 
  ukraine is a sovereign nation , and others ( including russia and us ) should respect that . 
  sweden helps us spy on russia and no one bats an eye . 
  sweden helps us spy on another country and everyone loses their minds . 
  i do n't think you guys have anything to worry about . 
  you 're in nato+eu , so our government ca n't fuck with you too much . 
  and while we do like making fun of you , most russians like poles too . 
  yes , even during russia-poland football matches , 
  yep , nothing is more political than a weather forecast !, 
  i 'm talking about maps of europe in general - a lot of them leave russia off completely , and to put more salt on the wound , include turkey, 
  now you know how we russians feel =p, 
  do n't we all ... 
  i think he means scandinavian-germanic `` jag/jeg '' sounds like a combination of slavic `` ja '' and mainland-germanic `` ich/ik '', 
  the usage of j is a bit inconsistent , assuming the map lists pronunciation , not just spelling of the word in that country . 
  as far as i know , polish/czech `` ja '' is pronounced exactly the same as russian/ukrainian `` ya '' , but french `` je '' sounds more like `` zhe '' . 
  pretty damn good at metal , too ... 
  we love you too !, 
  and yes , our government is the worst in europe i 'd say . 
  sooo ... netherlands or russia ? 
  germany . 
  czech republic is a close second though . 
  literal : '' \u0411\u0430\u0431\u0430 \u0441 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0443 - \u043a\u043e\u0431\u044b\u043b\u0435 \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0447\u0435 '' transliteration : `` baba s vozu - kobyle legche '' translation : `` woman off the cart - lighter for the horse '' meaning : easier to do work when the slacker is gone, 
  government . 
  honestly , the olympic flame going out is not an uncommon occurrence . 
  it happened in athens , it happened in beijing . 
  only difference this time is that people love to spit and laugh at the country in question . 
  eu membership ( and all the prerequisites ), 
  i love rotting christ and septicflesh \\ m /, 
  stalin was a monster . 
  i 'm glad he was n't russian ... 
  we have the same exact joke in russia , except about an american , german , and a russian . 
  also my polish reading skills have been improving lately =d, 
  nah , we 're just making an offer they ca n't refuse =p seriously though , i hope the eurasian union fails . 
  we 're just pushing ourselves further away from europe by attempting this power grab , which i think will lead the country into a dead end . 
  i 'd rather have an eu russia that is n't a superpower , rather than a russia that is king of the - stans . 
  oh absolutely !, 
  lem is in my opinion one of the genre 's fathers . 
  his books are very popular here in russia , and he has been a tremendous influence on soviet fiction ( including the strugatskys ) =d, 
  ** russia ** * dmitry glukhovsky - metro 2033 , later adapted into a computer game with the same name . 
  * sergey lukyanenko - world of watches ( night watch , day watch , etc. ), 
  * nick perunov - started out by writing lord of the rings fanfiction . 
  it was later published as `` ring of darkness '' and became very popular . 
  his other books ( not lotr related ) such as godsdoom , were received very well as well . 
  * not really contemporary ( 60 's / 70 's ) , but strugatsky brothers are in my opinion are among the best science fiction writers in the world . 
  old blood needs to be purged from russian politics , before they do even more damage to our country 's image . 
  not a bulgarian speaker , but from what i understand it says something like `` in step with the times '' , or `` in accordance with time '', 
  lukashenko looks like a chubby little hitler ... 
  yes , the black-yellow-white flag was used in the mid-19th century , until it was replaced by the white-blue-red one . 
  i believe that originally it was just a coincidence , since the russian tri-color appeared at least 100 years before the pan-slavism movement . 
  however , pan-slavism is probably the reason why it was promoted to the national flag , especially after the russo-turkish wars , when the idea of liberating fellow slavs in the balkans was used to motivate the troops . 
  not sure about that particular word , but a lot of russian naval vocabulary does indeed come from dutch . 
  peter the great copied the dutch flag and used it as the naval flag . 
  it later ( 1860 's , i think ? ), 
  was adopted as russian empire 's main flag . 
  i do n't think so !, 
   izba wytrze\u017awie\u0144 in russian , that literally means `` sobering-up hut '', 
  yea , strange , it 's almost like they are mutes ... 
  did n't know you poles called germans `` niemcy '' too . 
  i guess it 's just a common slavic thing . 
  early 20th century . 
  russo-japanese war , world war i , bolsheviks , stalin , molotov-ribbentrop pact ... 
  i need some vodka after remembering all that =(, 
  not even grandpa 's t-34 ? 
  it 's the only vehicle i have . 
  i was going to drive it to poland together with my pet bear misha ... 
  nah , i have to work the next day xd, 
  oops , that 's actually what i meant . 
  i edited my original post to clarify . 
  i 'm glad to hear that !, 
  most people i know like poles too !, 
  i hope that in a couple of decades , when the old soviet guard is finally out of russia 's government , our countries can be good friends , 
   we like every single russians very much - come here - we can drink a lot , talk a lot , sing a lot hey , that sounds like fun !, 
  i 'd love to do that someday , 
  * the witcher * behemoth * they do n't like ~ ~ us russians ~ ~ russian government much ( and for good reasons ), 
  there is a joke in my country : world war ii . 
  in germany , a train arrives exactly at scheduled time . 
  passengers at the station are amazed . 
  conductor : `` what did you expect ? 
  it 's war ! '', 
  in russia , a train arrives eight hours late .
