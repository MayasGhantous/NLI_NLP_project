  moreover , if you want to punish somebody first prove it . 
  it won ` t end because nobody else has the numbers you need . 
  in reality you gon na get some portion of it for higher price , is it really in your interests ? 
  guilty of what exactly ? 
  new sanctions seem more like subsides to us energy sector . 
  the problem with automation is that it already happened . 
  number of jobs in production is halved in 50 years or so but unemployment remained stable in healthy economies . 
  new wave of automation will not change it . 
  in reality with the population decline trend like this you gon na have average pension like 25-30 % of average wage . 
  nah , it is for federal budget , in consolidated it is less than 30 % now . 
  ha , if russia was on the map , moscow would be third and sakhalin first . 
  which is sad really . 
  yeah but the [ crimes ] ( http://www.assembly.coe.int/committeedocs/2010/ajdoc462010prov.pdf ) were mostly commited against serb prisoners when nato forces were in kosovo and not yet prosecuted . 
  whataboutism is not childish imho , childish to think that there were good guys in this conflict . 
  i do not care about serbia or anybody in particular , i just don ` t like selective prosecution , which is exactly what happened . 
  nah in kosovo it was mostly against serbs and again under un/nato supervision ... 
  it is the old one , they talk about it from the very beginning . 
  these are different sanctions . 
  you do not understand japan did not support financial sanctions officially , they could lend these money and it was authorized by the government . 
  us did not like it . 
  crimea sanctions are light and not include [ credits ] ( http://asia.nikkei.com/politics-economy/economy/japan-to-launch-new-loan-scheme-for-russia ) . 
  they want the islands back , the are to be friendly . 
  us usually threatens with full compliance , there was a story recently with japanese bank to lend some insignificant amount of money to russian bank . 
  us intervened and threatened full compliance to japanese i.e. 
  the same sanctions . 
  so usually if us implements sanctions to other countries , others will have to follow maybe except russia and china . 
  russia loses 0.5-1 % gdp growth because of sanctions , iran will lose more . 
  it is not `` living fine '', 
  it is more about economy to slow down by higher carbon taxes and power costs i guess . 
  russia is rus ' in greek , it was fashionable to show connection to byzantia at the time . 
  actually the were number of kingdoms at the same time . 
  kiev was one of the centers of rus tribes . 
  my bad , there are indeed only bombs . 
  ok now it is even closer to the border , what difference does it make ? 
  [ yea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pgm-19_jupiter#deployment_sites ), 
  they are also not that easy to intercept so it is still a bargain . 
  they are mostly cruise missiles nowadays , not bombs . 
  the place is the same , they removed icbms and left planes with bombs and missiles . 
  why used to ? 
  they are still in place in germany , netherlands and turkey . 
  sorry i meant kosovo liberation army . 
  in slovenia probably . 
  in russia gdp per capita is the same as in 1990 . 
  10 % of population now is even worse than in 1990 , for 40 % it is more or less the same , some 40 % did improve their life and other 10 % now own everything . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35327494 http://www.assembly.coe.int/committeedocs/2010/ajdoc462010prov.pdf, 
  actually there was real [ genocide ] ( http://www.deltax.net/bissett/a-monster.htm ) of serbian population by kosovo security force , not like some risk . 
  nothing new under the moon , even russians . 
  eu is not a bad idea in general , implementation and empty expectations are a problem . 
  same as post ussr , they were promised to have living standards of us , in reality it did not play out so well . 
  when they say radar cross section of f-35 is 0.0001 m2 , it means front projection - when planes fly nose in front of nose . 
  if you conventional plane flies lower , higher or from the side of the stealth plane it will detect it beyond visual range ( from 60 to 120nm depending on radar ) . 
  it was used together with f-22 , it is not clear whether it capable or not . 
  it is useful from the front only , if you know enemy has these planes you can adapt your tactics . 
  as what you say is true , it is also quite possible that these people were used to engineer a coup . 
  there were two turning points when these protests could end but instead were fuelled first with police violence and than after yanukovich resignation , by blood . 
  from lexicological point of view it may be true , from grammatical point of view it is not . 
  russian evolved independently and later with strong french/general european influence , a lot of words common for ukrainian , serbo-croatian or polish are either archaic or spoken only in the deep country-side in russia . 
  i did not say it was west fault , i said they did nothing to avoid it . 
  and they could avoid it . 
   it 's like saying `` if you did n't wear an expensive watch , you would n't have been robbed , so it 's your fault for wearing that watch , '' rather than saying that the person who robbed the guy was at wrong . 
  more like you now for sure that the guy will be killed or beaten if he goes that path , but you still advise him to do so . 
  the point is if your gdp per capita is low , your goal is to have high gdp growth . 
  you can implement progressive taxation ( which lowers growth and make wealth distribution better ) later , when gdp per capita will be comparable with developed countries . 
  if you do it while still poor , you will never be rich in the first place . 
  i don ` t think it is feasible . 
  putin or not . 
  every guy will become putin like if he stays in power for too long in russia . 
  problem is not him personally . 
  yes and putin sais if you will not welcome them in nato there would no need to agression . 
  my point is why do everything to ignite this agression ? 
  without west supporting nato enlargement , these wars may never happened . 
  they can ` t now according to nato rules . 
  yeah it is not fair , but if you know the consequences why not avoid them ? 
  without west supporting nato enlargement , these wars may never happened . 
  it was a threat , the question is why encouraging them to nato if you know it will lead to a war ? 
  ok in ten , not in 5 . 
  it always a bit of both , in russia it comes from massive oil sector and liberal tax policy . 
  i said growth like in china , not gdp per capita like in china . 
  yeah but i would prefer growth like in china and this level of inequality , than growth like in czechia . 
  in 5 years even poorest will earn more than middle class in czechia . 
  that should be the goal , not to build another ussr with everybody equal . 
  no it is well known fact and i am dead serious . 
  income inequality in theory shall drive growth . 
  if your gdp growth is higher than let ` s say in czechia , who cares about inequalities ? 
  a [ graph ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_socialist_federal_republic_of_yugoslavia#/media/file:eastern_bloc_economies_gdp_1990.jpg ) for gdp per capita growth , it increased 3 times average over 40 years , the same growth as us had . 
  also bear in mind , that it is not ppp figures . 
  czech actually closer to austria than it was after ww2 and was more closer in 1990 . 
  poland indeed did not do well in 1970-s , it may have been better or much better or worse who knows ? 
  as for estonia/latvia i ` ve never seen historical gdp figures for these countries , if you can share it would be nice . 
  i guess estonia/latvia would not be better off economically because ussr gdp growth was generally higher than western europe until the 80-s . 
  which ones , exactly ? 
  west was not growing faster initially , it was one economy . 
  the point is east was poor from the begining , it grew faster but did not close the gap during soviet times . 
  because people have decided they will be better off without it . 
  it is a [ fact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_german_democratic_republic#comparison_with_the_west_german_economy ) not like i am making this up . 
  actually gdp growth of east germany was higher than of west germany . 
  ussr had average gdp growth 6-7 % after ww2 till late 70-s , than there was a slowdown in 80-s . that is higher than western europe on average within the same timeframe . 
  strangely enough gdp growth of east and west germany was practicaly the same 1945 - 1990 . 
  and yes it was lagging before ww2 .
