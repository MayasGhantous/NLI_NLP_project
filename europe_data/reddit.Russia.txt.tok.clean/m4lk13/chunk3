  add the credit card debt to that , the upcoming mortgage ... hell . 
  at least i do n't have the student debt part . 
  here it was n't like that i guess , you just had to wait in the line until the government issues you a dwelling , haha . 
  my pops was supposed to get a flat right after i was born , but the ussr kinda ... dissolved and well i 'm shit out of luck too ( no more freebies from the government ) - at least i 'll inherit real estate from my grandmas one day . 
  somehow my ancestors managed to move out fine before they were 22 , and here look at me , a glorious man of the 21st century , playing video games in his momma 's apartment , talking to foreign people via fiber optics at the ripe old age of 24 . 
  no wife , no kids as well , naturally . 
  i would 've married i think if i had the living accommodations part nailed down . 
  it 's like we 're stuck in our man-child larvae state for a bit longer than our forefathers were . 
  hell , alexander the great conquered the world by his 20th birthday . 
  when i was 20 my greatest achievement was not passing out during parties . 
  edit : grammar . 
  i ka n't into inglish from ze first go , da . 
  i remember reading in some book about how italians live with their folks till they turn 30 and i was like , `` daaamn guys , i thought you have it good '' because no communism thing for a century in italy , and you know , you being a developed economy and all that . 
  i ca n't afford to move out because i have to pay for the mortgage loan . 
  it finally got approved , but the apartment complex is n't finished yet . 
  i ca n't afford to rent a place and do monthly payments at the same time so i 'm back in my tiny room at my parents ' place . 
  this is kinda humiliating , but i hated renting out a place even more than paying crazy % for the loan since renting means basically flushing money down the drain . 
  we have a similar saying , '' \u0421\u043c\u0435\u0445 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u044b - \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a \u0434\u0443\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u044b '' ( `` laughter without a reason is a sign of foolishness '' ) . 
  not smiling in public is the cultural norm in russia , you smile when you see a friend or whatever . 
  why go around grinning like a maniac ? 
  i hate it actually when people give that big-ass , fake smile that looks like it was painted there . 
  what are you , my long lost brother ? 
  or maybe high a little bit ? 
  and about the salespeople not smiling - some actually do , especially people working in electronics stores , clothes stores , car sales , etc. 
  and it actually annoys me a bit . 
  goddamit , i came here to buy stuff , not see you smile like it 's 3 am in a bar and you got me a vodka with cranberry juice . 
  what are you , hitting on me or trying to sell me a fridge ? 
  yes !, 
  we have a tier-5 kebab problem . 
  advice from a well-experienced kebab-removal professional will be very , very welcome . 
  bring \u0448\u0459\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0446\u0430 and flamethrowers . 
  woah , woah , no chest pounding , guys . 
  it 's just putin 's new thermos . 
  nothing to see here . 
  move along . 
  i 'm russian , but not a pensioner anytime soon . 
  i was referring to the whole commercial pension fund thing ( that you probably know about judging by your comment history ) ; basically a portion of your future pension got appropriated by the government if you opted out for a non-government controlled pension fund in 2013/2014 . 
  dude , what kind of pensioner would care for a ps4 ? 
  justification is irrelevant . 
  it 's a violent act , and violent acts do not go unnoticed . 
  if the tables will turn again , retribution is granted . 
  thus goes on the cycle . 
  yes , but right now we have the option to move freely around , so if things go south , i 'm moving south . 
  haha . 
  on an unrelated note , i met a bulgarian guy this summer on cyprus , and we immediately greeted each other by shouting '' \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438 ! '' . 
  well , i did that , and he just calmly said , `` yes , \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438 '' . 
  he was working as a club promoter in ayia-napa . 
  good times . 
  i do n't care much for sports either , but cheers to a good game . 
  play hard , play fair , and play to win . 
  and i wonder where did my pension go . 
  them big boys downtown in kremlin , throwing bags of money here and there , draining the previously untouchable `` national well-being fund '' . 
  15 billion to ukraine , 2 billion to belarus . 
  i guess it 's time to ask vladdy-boy for a ps4 since he 's being all generous , or else i 'll join the eu and nato and deploy a missile shield on my dacha . 
  all glory to the republic of me . 
  yay !, 
  come see the sights . 
  enlighten me then , oh great internet sage . 
  i seek thy knowledge . 
  i do n't mean to sound like that ( * most of the time * ) , english is n't my first language . 
  we 're all friends here , i 'm not trying to rub anyone in a wrong way ^ except ^ kebabs, 
  i was wrong in my assumption then . 
  not everyone is as enlightened as you are and ready to forgive and move on . 
  historically serbs sustained grievances from albanians as well , why do you think the war was so violent ? 
  it 's not like one side was full of innocent victims and the other was comprised out of bad guys . 
  albania has a certain reputation for a reason . 
  on a larger scale , muslims in the balkans are a shard of the old ottoman empire , imagine living with a legacy left from your former enslavers and oppressors side-to-side for centuries . 
  everyone had a score to settle . 
  no one ever rushed forward to forgive thy enemy . 
  especially when your enemy tries to disassemble you for black market organ trafficking , then gets backing from a certain global geopolitical player and is allowed to create enclaves in your own country . 
  i like it that you 're trying to relate to albanians who are , to put it mildly , quite unpopular , but do n't paint serbs in all black . 
  are you shqiptar ? 
  i wonder why would a canadian take such a strong pro-albanian stance if he did n't have his views skewed by being from the region , originally . 
  the argument of who settled the land first and who 's claim is more valid is very old , but if we 're taking sides here , i guess i 'll stick with the right one . 
  oooh , canada , the russia of north america . 
  i think that vaeldr was trying to hint at the possible outcome in other parts of europe where muslims can become a majority and then create a breakaway enclave that at some point in the future becomes a whole new country . 
  or something like that . 
  you can go to youtube to see some fun times happening in kosovo , how the new masters of the realm treat historically significant buildings and just generally enjoy the glorious world of tolerant and multicultural tomorrow , where everyone lives in peace and respects each other . 
  edit : the `` oooh canada '' part was in friendly jest . 
  probably my sense of humor does n't translate all that well . 
  [ merry christmas and happy new year , ho ho ho ] ( http://kzndnb.ru/uploads/images/2/a/2/c/6/56339b5d19.jpg ) . 
  season beati ... uh , greetings . 
  we have a similar saying , '' \u041a\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442 , \u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 '' - `` the one who pays is the one who orders what music is to be played '' . 
  well his comment has a lot of upvotes , so i take it he 's not alone in his discomfort . 
  although sometimes people here upvote the weirdest things . 
  pffft , guys , get a load of a [ glorious nuclear-powered pike ] ( http://www.shchukino-tyt.ru/shchukino/img/gerb.gif ) and a cute , but mentally challenged [ beaver ] ( http://mnevniki.info/_ph/1/2/347507776.png ) . 
  his face gets me all the time . 
  here 's a [ link ] ( http://www.mk.ru/social/article/2013/04/21/844795-camyie-strannyie-gerbyi-gorodov-rossii-ot-tigranegroida-do-opiuma-i-zhertvoprinosheniy.html ) to an article with the weirdest russian coat of arms . 
  it 's not in english , but you can check out the pictures for some extra street cred . 
  i was referring to [ this guy 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/kukul ) comment , he said that locals were upset with his slavic accent and noticeably changed their behavior around him . 
  definition of normality varies from country to country . 
  what amount of personal space is considered normal , how to address people properly , amount of eye contact , etc. 
  dude , you made me sad right now . 
  i 'm going to spend my winter holidays in berlin , does it really bother people that much ? 
  i really hate trying to hide where i 'm from , but i 'm also tired of people giving me the good old dumb stereotypes routine . 
  you do n't wan na know what `` yokarniy babaj '' means . 
  no thanks dude , we 're comfy here . 
  not really , pal . 
  well , still niko is my favorite character in the gta series . 
  have you played gta iv ?
