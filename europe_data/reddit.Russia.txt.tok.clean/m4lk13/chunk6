  yeah , we rarely complain . 
  it 's part of the culture . 
  only little bitches and snitches complain , others must endure and carry on , haha . 
  every day is a struggle of epic proportions . 
  you raise your mighty battle-scarred body from the rugs on the cold floor , you eat live bunnies for breakfast and chew on some turnips . 
  then you go to the uranium mines , dig for 12 hours with your bare hands . 
  after that you go to mcdonalds for a capitalist fatburger , with no onions , but they give you onions anyway , and you 're like , `` well , screw it , i 'm gon na take it and eat it like a man who does n't care about nothing '' . 
  all the time you have to wear a neutral , solemn expression on your face . 
  life is what it was meant to be . 
  ooh , i see . 
  although it 's not like we 're the only ones who drink and have , uh , a messianic complex , so there are many peoples in the world to dislike as a whole and to love as a collection of individuals . 
  the vibrant cultures , the music , the literature , the movies and the food . 
  the glorious determination , the cyclopian buildings , the shattered dreams of nations , the bloody wars and revolutions - you got ta take the good with the bad . 
  let 's drink together and tread over the weak , for the world is meant to be ruled by empires and by autocrats with an iron fist . 
  or let 's waste away typing at our tiny keyboards , watching the world move without us . 
  haha . 
  damn , i got excel spreadsheets to do , let 's play again sometime later . 
  nah , i know my people can be rowdy and annoying , especially the ones coming from smaller towns or from a certain background . 
  i mean , as tourists we 're pretty awful in general , right up there in the hall of fame with the british and the chinese . 
  i 'd say younger urbanites are pretty decent and you would n't even notice them . 
  but hey , we just party hard , not afraid to love , not afraid to hate , not afraid to call names and get into fights - get to know us , get to love us , because deep inside we 're all soft balls of fur and the greatest friends you 'll ever get . 
  come , embrace my bearhug , for it is not time for war , but for peace . 
  oh sorry , that 's the flair that confused me . 
  then let 's continue spreading the message of hate !, 
  blood for the blood god !, 
  skulls for the skull throne !, 
  and i like you bulgarian guys . 
  at my previous job i was friends with an older dude , a legal department head . 
  he was bulgarian and an awesome person . 
  also i had some random encounters with you guys during my vacation in greece , it was fun , too . 
  you stole my face , guy . 
  i had `` garderobiers '' at the uni too . 
  pensions are low , so some seniors resort to menial jobs . 
  yay to techno-communism . 
  well fuck you , roskomnadzor , you ai n't taking dank memes from me . 
  see you around , space cowboys . 
  it 's us both using modified greek  anyhow , thanks for the \u0410\u0411\u0412 , based slavic bros. 
  it 's very pretty . 
  i especially like [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/coat_of_arms_of_the_socialist_republic_of_slovenia.svg/180px-coat_of_arms_of_the_socialist_republic_of_slovenia.svg.png ) , it has the heineken logo and stuff , like crazy leafs and wheat or something . 
  / r/russia is not leaking , friend . 
  it is expanding . 
  every time i see your flair i 'm like , hey there fellow comrade , how are beets growing today , how 's the kids , did they learn how to assemble assault rifles already ? 
  and then i 'm like , [ oh ] ( http://replygif.net/thumbnail/215.gif ) . 
  dude , i 've watched so much star trek i practically shit out little captain picards every time i go number 2 . 
  klingons are a model society we should aspire to become . 
  they 're metal as fuck . 
  #myjimmies yeah , as a poc i demand to be pampered . 
  everyone who does n't think i 'm fabulous is faggy and pompous . 
  that 's a zinger right here , buddy . 
  a fresh invasion joke . 
  :( well , fuck disneyland then , time to angrily wreck some shit . 
  it sure is n't , it 's an orcish horde and a klingon warship . 
  to disneyland ? 
  well the article 's title totally does n't have racist undertones  durr hurr , barbaric nomads , evil . 
  no shit . 
  yeah , and abortion rate will go up . 
  you do n't need grenade launchers when [ your moves ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_ivdnw07ly ) set the house on fire . 
  it 's the normal kind . 
  besides , you would n't hit a guy with glasses on , would you ? 
  [ :d ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuljzbxppfa ), 
  not really , but i have n't been to bulgaria yet . 
  i 'm not thinking about immigrating anywhere though , i 'm all set here , but i 'd gladly take a vacation to lots of places . 
  let me pack up my stuff , 
  i think that 's nicolas cage from `` lord of war '' . 
  we have won the competition !, 
  yay estonia !, 
  ireland . 
  i bet the irish think that they 've lulled everyone into a sense of false security , and then bam !, 
  false-flag operations , funding the terrorists , staged coups and revolutions . 
  who knows , maybe vlad the invader is a mere puppet to the shadowy leaders of the irish nation and russia is but a crypto-colony , doing its masters ' bidding . 
  or maybe iceland . 
  they 've been too quiet . 
  i do n't like that . 
  oh isis , please do n't . 
  i was a child when the chechen wars were waged . 
  i remember the terrorist acts committed in the moscow metro . 
  i have no desire for my life to be snuffed out by some barbarian 's suicidal act of terrorism . 
  going through the whole radicalization of the caucasus region again will be a burden on our pockets , already thinned out by the you-know-what that happened last year . 
  why do they even do that ? 
  the khalifate the fanatics want to build will not be allowed to exist . 
  there is no point in their struggle . 
  it 's futile . 
  why do n't they see ? 
  my paranoid guess is that isis is funded externally in order to pursue some big geopolitical player 's goals . 
  i 'm no geopolitics expert , but i 'd say russia invaded georgia in 2008 in order to draw a line in the sand . 
  to stop georgia from joining nato . 
  the crimean question is complicated , i 'm not sure whether it was wise to aggravate the global community in such a bold manner , but crimea was virtually russian anyways . 
  on a personal level , i 'm annoyed at the currency depreciation and a haze of patriotic fervor that some of my compatriots display with glee and reckless abandon . 
  ultimately , all actions undertaken on a large scale by politicians are bound to conform to rationality . 
  why would russia annex georgia ? 
  to what end ? 
  what will be accomplished ? 
  why would russia annex georgia as a whole ? 
  euromaidan as a source ? 
  are you fucking kidding me ?

  there 's a 50 % chance of meeting a tyrannosaurus next time you go outside : either you do or do n't . 
  maybe there 's a nuclear submarine hiding in the ukrainian steppes . 
  well i only pray that tensions wo n't get so high so that they 'll have to close kfc . 
  i will riot without chicken tendies .
