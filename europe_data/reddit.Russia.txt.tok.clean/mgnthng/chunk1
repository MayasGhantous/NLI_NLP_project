my fav : ukraina is not alina !, 
  tl ; dr russian economy : summer is now over , it 's cold and sun not shine , dollar - thirty eight , and euro - forty nine . 
  beside food and falling value of ruble , since the conflict and sanctions we have less customers ( construction supply ) . 
  usually summer is the best time to make money , but this year the season is totally failed . 
  similar situation in other companies in the city and in big russia-wide companies . 
  among other things i blame sanctions . 
   denmark had its sunniest summer in 55 years i 'm gon na diiiieee !, 
  ( c ) my dane mate this summer, 
  i see that the czech republic opposes new sanctions against russia , could you please explain why ? 
  i can understand why hungary and cyprus oppose it , but wonder about slovakia and cr . 
   belarus - perepecha perepechi is udmurtian dish , never heard about it as a belarusian one . 
  lavash is just a bread . 
  [ sure ] ( http://s00.yaplakal.com/pics/pics_original/7/0/8/2188807.jpg ), 
  yet another joke : once in united kingdom , france and russia was signed an order about anal rape of all citizens in every saturday . 
  because of this the citizens of the uk elected new parliament , in france mass protests led to a revolution . 
  in russia people started to queue for anal rape in friday to get home in saturday earlier . 
  disclaimer : this is a popular russian joke about russia 's responses to sanctions . 
  have an upvote . 
  i 've been looking to move to scandinavia/finland and i was told that it 's really hard to find a job in finland if you do n't speak finnish . 
  and finnish language is pretty hard , much harder than , for example , swedish ( because swedish is a germanic language and has similar roots as english etc ) . 
  start with bans on foreign goods . 
  i read once a guy was in italy and ordered a cappuccino in the afternoon , people around started to giggle . 
  i like red dry wine ( or gl\u00f6gg in winter ) and kvass . 
  last month i 've made [ medovukha ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medovukha ) and that was pretty good too . 
  usually i drink pure water . 
  the melody itself is okay , but i do n't want the remix of the soviet anthem to be russian anthem . 
  anyway , it 's the best anthem for putin 's regime . 
  as an anti-communist i do n't like our anthem . 
  i prefer the [ anthem ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fsrpwg6y_0 ) of 1991-2000 . 
   valeria novodvorskaia has died . 
  she was liberal version of vladimir zhirinovsky zhirik is a fucking clown , [ novodvorskaia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valeriya_novodvorskaya ) was wise , strong and believed in what she was doing . 
  she has a blog with tons of video with her opinion about politics and i agree with every word she said . 
  her death is a big loss for all liberals in russia . 
  people like valeria novodvorskaia should be honored . 
  please , do not compare her with fucktards like zhirik . 
  and they call it `` dobrovidenie '' = `` goodvision '' . 
  it 's absolutely normal and very common if you 're a student . 
  of course not . 
   it 's an idiom . 
  this is how most of cities look like . 
  rip lenta , old friend . 
  12 ( * maybe more * ) lenin statues toppled in ukraine .

  epic . 
  lol, 
  actually akarlin is right . 
  our countrymen do n't want changes and most of the people feel good , secure , and productive , because of different views on `` good '' , `` secure '' and `` productive '' . 
  try your own business here . 
  our company compared with 2006 : warehouse space 1300 m ^ 2 -  200 m ^ 2 , 3 trucks -  0 trucks , 24 employees -  4 employees , own production -  no own production , repairs & maintenance services -  no repairs & maintenance services . 
  money owed to the company : up to 2 million , tens won courts , nobody pays ( okay , one company pays like 100-200 rub in 3 months ) . 
  there 's no reason at all to go to the court if someone owe you money , those companies were closed then the same people opened new companies and continue to work . 
  and i 'm not mention that nothing work without corruption/bribe . 
  or take a look at teachers or medics . 
  school teacher lives few floors below me in 30 m ^ 2 one-room flat with husband and 20 + y/o daughter . 
  how many young couples able to rent , especially if they have kids ? 
  why there are many old tourists from foreign countries and no one from russia ? 
  have you ever seen russian granny in paris taking picture of the eiffel tower ? 
  shit , rear-admiral with cancer committed suicide because he was not discharged painkillers . 
  and this is what happening with every one who has cancer . 
  ` nuff said . 
   \u043d\u0430\u0448 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 ignorance , rudeness , adoration of the police lawlessness and repressions . 
  farewell , farewell , unwashed russia , the land of slaves , the land of lords , and you , blue uniforms of gendarmes , and you , obedient to them folks . 
  i 'm sorry , but i 'm under the impression that sochi is ( was before olympics ) dirty cheap middle of nowhere for old sovoks and with caucasians yells '' '' eey garl yo mamma need husband for daughtah ? '',

  `` all the city in ruins ''  this is not true . 
  all pictures you see were taken inside small area near the dynamo stadium . 
  this is the government quarter , no disturbing for peaceful life . 
  `` this is not a revolution . 
  nothing special . '', 
   this is the revolution . 
  the downtown is under control of opposition for two months . 
  some government buildings are captured . 
  there are strong barricades . 
  it 's cold but thousands people still there . 
  `` kiev paralyzed , ( protesters ) do n't let people to live in peace ''  kiev lives its own life . 
  all stores and cafes work , citizens work , studying in a universities , getting married , getting divorced and dying in one 's bed . 
  most of kiev citizens are not disturbed expect those who live in the downtown .
