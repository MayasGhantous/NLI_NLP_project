   the truth is , ukraine needs russia . 
  estonia , latvia , lithuania , georgia were in the same situation , same words were saying : they . 
  need . 
  right answer is no . 
   we just offered over $ 12 billion worth deposit to ukraine exactly . 
  this is your greatest talent - throwing money . 
  fortunately ukrainians are not russians and want freedom not russian stability . 
   please bring something to the table and stop acting like a pissed off younger brother , and act like an adult . 
  too bad onischenko was fired , he acted like an adult . 
   svoboda is the kkk 's ukrainized version - its a neonazi party and has very much hate for pretty much everything . 
  kiselev said you so ? 
  this is bullshit . 
  they want an independence for their country and their countrymen and do n't want to be a ` little brother ' or ` ukrainian oblast '' . 
  they 're okay with black people , jews and even russians if you 're not typical vatnik . 
   why so ? 
  high unemployment - no productivity - lesser revenue - more ukrainian speaking people . 
  these unemployed people just want a free ticket to the eu . 
  and they 're reptoids . 
  american agents . 
  wants a syrian scenario . 
   we do not support the illegal law passed by the ukrainian government recently . 
  its totalitarian , and a complete no-no . 
  this is what you passed in russia ...
