  this reminds me [ the putorana plateau ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d0wdsmr.jpg ), 
  i 'd say tatars and bashkirs are rather well integrated . 
  they are just regular people and nobody pays attention to them . 
  also tatarstan is rather rich region compared to others , and kazan is an important city for many industries . 
  as for native caucasians , many of them are much less integrated , and there 's much more hate towards them from ethnic russians . 
  chechens , for example , still have kind of clans , and they are not allowed to marry non-chechens . 
  also their republics are very poor and corrupt and need a lot of funding from federal budget , causing a lot of butthurt from ethnic russians . 
  actually it 's around 5 %, 
  his side in `` soviet vs anti-soviet '' does n't matter . 
  what matter is that he is the product of the same society and era as putin , and he is unable to move over and to adjust his views to the new reality . 
  that 's why he will never be supported by any significant amount of people . 
  russians need new ideas and new leaders , but kasparov will never be that new leader . 
  therefore he is irrelevant for russian opposition . 
  he did n't, 
  he did . 
  does n't change anything about kasparov, 
   garry kasparov old soviet fart , irrelevant, 
   it 's the soviet mentality that carries on strongly are bloody soviets source of all problems in your country ? 
  probably i formulated it in wrong way . 
  pussy riot are n't just 2 jailed woman , there are ( or were ? ), 
  much more members . 
  but only maria alyokhina and nadezhda tolokonnikova now has rights on the brand in usa and eu . 
   they were sentenced for `` hooliganism against religion '' . 
  false . 
  they were sentenced for hooliganism , there 's no `` hooliganism against religion '' article in russian criminal code . 
  [ here 's the link to relevant part of english translation of russian criminal code  ( https://web.archive.org/web/20150221093634/http://www.russian-criminal-code.com:80/partii/sectionix/chapter24.html )  article 213 . 
  hooliganism , that is , a gross violation of the public order which expresses patent contempt for society , attended by violence against private persons or by the threat of its use , and likewise by the destruction or damage of other people 's property , shall be punishable by compulsory works for a term of 120 to 180 hours , or by corrective labour for a term of six to twelve months , or by arrest for a term of four to six months , or by deprivation of liberty for a term of up to two years . 
  the same act , if it is : a ) committed by a group of persons , a group of persons in a preliminary conspiracy , or an organized group ; b ) connected with resistance to a representative of authority or to any other person who fulfills the duty of protecting the public order or who prevents violation of the public order ; c ) committed by a person who was earlier convicted of hooliganism - shall be punishable by compulsory works for a term of 180 to 240 hours , or by corrective labour for a term of one to two years , or by deprivation of liberty for a term of up to five years . 
  hooliganism committed with the use of arms or objects used as arms shall be punishable by deprivation of liberty for a term of four to eight years . 
  pussy riot were sentenced by the second part of this article . 
   i 'm sure they knew that they could end up in prison i 'm sure they did not , because they made many more same stupid actions before going to the main russian church, 
  lol . 
  maria alyokhina is dating russian orthodox activist dmitiry enteo , who literally pulled people out of protest actions and took them to police . 
  why is it not mentioned in this article ? 
  why do pussy riot members goes to theaters with russian establishment ? 
  why do they support accused rapist , if they are feminists ? 
  why did they officially registered pussy riot brand in usa and eu , if they are punks ? 
  if this is not at least betrayal , then i do n't know what . 
  there 's an [ interesting interview ] ( https://youtu.be/lqzk1xxhzda ) with maria alyokhina on youtube , unfortunately only in russian , there she fails to respond on such questions . 
  it 's called '' \u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f-\u0441\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a '' here , literally `` soldier bug '', 
  many of `` moderate rebels '' are not syrian , they came their brcause they are members of international terrorist organisations, 
  yeap , thousands of terrorists comming from all over islamic world are `` nobody '', 
   dns_probe_finished_nxdomain this is not how block message looks like, 
  this webpage is not available, 
  [ russian kids meet finnish liberators !, 
   russian  agglutinative lmao what, 
  this is bs . 
   there 's is nothing left because the soviets intentionally destroyed everything that `` looks even just remotely german and thus might raise questions among the new citizens '' . 
  this is so bs . 
  there 's `` nothing '' left because is was destoyed during ww2 , like in almost every city affected by that war . 
  and `` nothing '' is really bad word , there 're still some ruins left there . 
  did n't you know that portuguese are [ amphibian people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amphibian_man ) ? 
   still the us would n't have shot a plane down there if it was n't targeting the sdf or saw it as a threat . 
  `` saw as a threat '' is not a good justification . 
  right now we have russian words against us words . 
  through i think russian reaction wo n't be so severe if the us admitted the possible mistake or had really good reason to attack the plane . 
  so my bet is that syaf did n't attack sdf . 
  i think it was an open secret that russia and the us have some agreements about influence zones in syria . 
  pkk and assadist apologists there well , of course you should filter out obvious propaganda . 
  but it 's still nice place there many info accumulated . 
  this is not confirmed by anyone but the us coalition . 
  even sdf itself did n't confirm it yet . 
  looks more like the us is trying to justify the plane shot down . 
  i 'd advise to lurk / r/syriancivilwar for more info and opinions,
