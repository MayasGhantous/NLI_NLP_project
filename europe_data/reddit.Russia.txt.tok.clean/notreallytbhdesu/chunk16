  you 're conspirologist if you think that every tv program is written by kremlin, 
   we 'll have to blow up russia 's gas pipe on our territory you absolutely should . 
  it does n't matter . 
  russia illegaly annexed part of your country , invaded another part , but you still has some ties with russia . 
  ukraine should be shamed by that . 
  yeah some clowns say something , but it 's not official russian position, 
   they 'll lose transit fees . 
  that money will go to german companies profit . 
  on an objective view , i 'd say ukraine needs that more . 
  so now you say it 's a commercial dispute . 
  if so , then ukraine has no word in russian-german relations . 
  shit happens , ukraine . 
  ukraine was a shitty trade partner , they stole transit gas and denied it , thankfully stockholm court judged right and made ukraine to return stolen gas . 
  anyway , just read [ this article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia%e2%80%93ukraine_gas_disputes ) preamble . 
   russia will gain leverage over ukraine by setting whatever gas price they want . 
  ukraine do not buy russian gas since 2015 or 2016 for political reasons .
