  so lithuania is supporting russia ? 
  damn , i had better opinion on you ... how dare you country to have any relations with russia ? 
  you 're betraying your own history by doing it . 
   the argument is that ukraine will be fucked , why ? 
  why ukraine will be fucked by ns2 ? 
  there 're no logic behind this . 
  why does ukraine supply money to russia by allowing russian owned companies to operate in ukraine ? 
   i do not blame ukraine for taking gas from the supplies meant for germany after being cut off by russia . 
  but they have been doing it before `` cut off from russia '' . 
  they just plain simple stole russian gas , that was the main reason why russia cut it off in 2009, 
   taking into consideration russia 's aggressive actions and rhetoric towords the entire western world , which words exactly ? 
  why does religion organisation take part in official visit ? 
  is n't georgia a secular country with no state religion ? 
  did georgia pay for they arrive from budget ? 
  not your stranger , tovarishch, 
   until ns was a thing , russia had to find deal with them to transfer to we markets . 
  yeah because ukraine and poland are shitty trade partners who brings history and ideology into business, 
  germany is n't even in un sc, 
   usa did n't get involved in syria lol , us troops are literally fighting in syria, 
   excuse me , what ? 
  have you ever heard of words \u043c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438 ( moskali ) or \u043a\u0430\u0446\u0430\u043f\u044b ( katsapy ) ? 
  the ukrainians love to hate on the russians , your news are filled with how terrible russia is and how everyone here is literally anti-ukrainian and dugin supporter . 
  do n't delude yourself . 
  draw any conclusions you want, 
   nobody hates the ukrainian people , only their democratically elected government is a nazi fascist junta . 
  i 'm pretty sure many ukrainian hate their government too  nobody hates the ukrainian people , but those cretin inhabitants of ukraine - who are not actually ukrainians , because those are beautiful people - must be freaking killed off linking to freaks like dugin does n't help, 
  oh , i have google maps for this . 
  / r/russian, 
   do you even watch tv ? 
  no and i do n't recommend you . 
   have you seen video from samara where alcoholic charges on old lady ? 
  he yells `` bandera '' because it 's first negative thing that takes form in his vodka-flooded mind . 
  no , but i 've seen this video from ukraine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prlgwpe2o_i  or did you visit any russian youtube video ( non-politicla non-ukraine related ) where in comment sections people start throwing shit on ukraine ? 
  or just randomly open youtube and see videos with '' \u0445\u043e\u0445\u043b\u044b '' in title in suggestions ? 
  i did n't . 
  all i see is \u041d\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 20 ! 8 comment getting upvoted, 
  what 's `` the western world '' ? 
  usa , germany or poland ? 
  4chan is indeed part of modern western culture . 
  so you say it 's obvious but can not prove it . 
  nice . 
   that 's quite a shift from `` factually incorrect '' to `` irrelevant , even if correct '' :d you 're making shit up . 
  both my map and cia map show that article statement is incorrect . 
   ask yourself , why were you bothered that irrelevant details might be factually incorrect ? 
  `` irrelevant details '' in this article are used as facts to criticize russia , therefore `` irrelevant details '' are n't irrelevant , they are essential part of this article . 
  by debunking them , i debunk whole article . 
  you 're whataboutist about whataboutism, 
  i tried to listen to them , hell , i myself was one of them , but then i discovered english speaking internet , 4chan and reddit , and this changed my perception of the west forever . 
  i do n't believe in the holy free west anymore , where everyone is rich and everything is working right , it 's literally the same shit as russia when it comes to approaches and government-people relationships . 
  it 's the same propaganda in media and us vs them mentality . 
  call them whatever you want , but i think most of them are just edgy teens and teen-like adults, 
   the article is from 2015 . 
  thanks for paying attention for it . 
  it 's explains a lot . 
  but still , unemployment rise was n't comparable to 2008 crisis . 
   ahah , i see that all the time on reddit alone and there are plenty of russian articles hating on ukraine and even calling them nazis . 
  hating ukraine is not the same as hating ukrainian people , and calling some ukrainian people nazis is not the same as calling all ukrainian nazis . 
  can you please link some russian articles there all ukrainians are called nazis ? 
  even if it 's true , what does it tell to us ? 
  does it mean what russian authorities are the worst authorities in the world ? 
  does it mean that russians has the lowest quality of life ? 
  no and no . 
  crude death rates do n't tell us a lot , while this article present it like some serious problem . 
  i 've already made 3 comment in this thread after just looking in the middle of article . 
  should i continue ? 
  it 's not my job to disprove any anti-russian shit written in the internet, 
  no because it 's factually incorrect in many nuances and overall of bad quality . 
  there 's a good share of russians who always shit on russia , no matter what, 
  hypocrisy is one of the most used propaganda method by everyone, 
   the country 's mortality rate is the highest in europe , with only afghanistan and sixteen african countries ahead of us worldwide . 
  this is factually incorrect , [ see map of death rate in the world ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/death_rate_world_map.png ) . 
   when , because of our incompetent authorities , prices for consumer goods skyrocket and unemployment grows , [ consumer prices skyrocketed ? 
  realy ? 
  ] ( https://tradingeconomics.com/russia/consumer-price-index-cpi ) [ unemployment ? 
  ] ( https://tradingeconomics.com/russia/unemployment-rate )  and people can not change the government or hold it to account , they direct their frustration at the us president , or the ukrainian people . 
  ukrainian people ? 
  really ? 
  i did n't see any anger on ukrainian people , maybe authors will provide some examples ? 
  ^ ( but they will not , because there 's no anger on ukrainian people in russia ), 
   russian foreign policy is renowned for its focus on the binaries of ` friend against foe ' : our people against the foreigners , patriots against traitors , russia against europe . 
  this formula is the basis for our national ideology , and gives our political elite carte blanche to do away with independent thought . 
  wow , how unice !, 
  clearly russian invention !, 
  these damn russkies always were good at inventing new propaganda methods !, 
  what does `` the real great white north '' mean ? 
  yeah maybe ukraine should stop being shitty trade partner, 
  we do n't know how widespread this practice were, 
  what do you mean by `` really oppressed '' ? 
   you and notreallytbhdesu are claiming that the national languages in the russian empire were not oppressed at all . 
  i 've never claimed such thing , stop making shit up, 
   our language was banned under their rule , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuanian_press_ban  the lithuanian press ban ( lithuanian : spaudos draudimas ) was a ban on all lithuanian language publications printed in the latin alphabet in force from 1865 to 1904 within the russian empire , which controlled lithuania at the time . 
  lithuanian-language publications that used cyrillic were allowed and even encouraged . 
  you also claim that  just writing or owning a book written in the latin alphabet could get you either killed or banished to siberia . 
  which is total bs , of course ( as usual ) :  during the years of the ban , 3,047 people ( 829 smugglers , 859 distributors , and 1,359 persons possessing banned books ) were arrested in connection with the ban . 
  so , only 160 people were expelled , and only some of them to siberia , and about 40 people were sentenced to prison terms . 
  does n't sound like '' just writing or owning a book written in the latin alphabet could get you either killed or banished to siberia . '', 
  if you do n't believe russian wiki because reasons , here 's a quote from lithuanian wiki :  per draudimo laikotarp\u012f caro vald\u017eia sulaik\u0117 vir\u0161 3000 \u017emoni\u0173 , i\u0161 j\u0173 nubaud\u0117 apie 2000 . 
  which means 3000 were arrested , 2000 out of them were fined , right ? 
  [ eastern germany was poor than western since their formation , however , eastern germany had slightly higher grow rates ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_german_democratic_republic#comparison_with_the_west_german_economy ), 
  radislav , that 's how we call them in slavik lands !,
