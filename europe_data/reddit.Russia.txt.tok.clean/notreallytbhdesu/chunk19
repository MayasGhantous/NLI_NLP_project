  yes , russian . 
  that 's how people of kievan rus ' called themselves in chronicles . 
   in the year 6390 ... and oleg sat down to reign in kiev , and oleg said : `` let it be mother of rus ' ^ * cities '' . 
  * since english does n't have adjective for rus ' , the revisionist author translated '' \u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 '' ( `` ruskimi '' , russian ) as rus ' and not as russian i however have to note that this wiki-article was written by some ukrainian revisionist , as he called the language of this phrase `` old ukrainian '' , while it 's well known fact that [ laurentian codex ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laurentian_codex ) was written in old church slavonic . 
  i 'm too lazy to write myself so i 'll just copy-paste [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_moscow ) :  the first reference to moscow dates from 1147 as a meeting place of yuri dolgorukiy and sviatoslav olgovich . 
  at the time it was a minor town on the western border of vladimir-suzdal principality . 
   the earliest east slavic tribes recorded as having expanded to the upper volga in the 9th to 10th centuries are the vyatichi and krivichi . 
  the moskva river was incorporated as part of rostov-suzdal into the kievan rus in the 11th century . 
  by ad 1100 , a minor settlement had appeared on the mouth of the neglinnaya river . 
  so moscow certainly existed before 1147 , and probably even in 1051, 
   if you need to give her a nationality then the best fit for her is ukrainian , just because she was born in today 's ukrainian lands but she called herself russian, 
   the term `` moscow gold '' has its origin in anti-soviet propaganda which used the term to discredit the supposed financial support of western trade unions and political parties of communist ideologies . 
   since the 1970s this episode of spanish history has been the focus of many essays and works of literature , many relying on information from official documents and records of the time . 
  it has also been the source of strong controversy and historical debate , especially in spain . 
  disagreements are centred on the political interpretation of its motivations , on its supposed usage , its effects on the development of the conflict , its subsequent influence on the exiled government of the republic and on the diplomatic relations between the francoist government and the soviet union . 
  well at least people of 11th century kiev called themselves ruskie, 
  yeah and in russia she is associated with ancient rus ' and therefore russia . 
  so we have just russia 's word against ukrainian, 
   moscow did n't exist in 1051 more like moscow was irrelevant village , and became significant enough to be mentioned in a chronicle only in 1147, 
  * kiev, 
   russia and the soviet union before/after them have denied the existence of a seperate belarussian or ukrainian identity for over a century . 
  this is pure bs . 
  moscow may be new , but it 's hilarious to deny that russia has somewhat less inheritance from medieval rus ' than ukraine . 
  novgorod , pskov , vladimir , suzdal , rostov , kursk - they all are in russia now, 
   she is mostly associated with ukraine , bs . 
  she is not associated with ukraine because ukraine did n't exist in 11th century, 
  why do you crop citation out of context ? 
  these 43.1 % were about tire covers , not about food . 
  i , however , must admit i gave a wrong link : i meant you to read the whole thread in / askhistorians , not only the comment i linked . 
  i referred to [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3pa76y/i_often_hear_people_say_that_the_united_states/cw53nyh/ ) when i said `` while lend lease played critical role in some production , food was n't one of them . '' . 
  to be more precise , this part of said comment :  as for food , the ussr lost 42 percent of cultivated land to the german offensive , including 2/3 of its grain production . 
  us food aid amounted to roughly 10 percent of soviet production , and while whether or not that was the difference between famine level scarcity or not gets debated , but regardless of the exact effect , it was enough food to `` to feed a 12,000,000-man army half pound of food per day for the duration of the war . '', 
  and of course , as with manufacturing , food imports freed up hands for other duties that otherwise would be needed to till the land . 
  10 % is hardly `` majority of its food '' . 
  it would be absolutely insane to assume that us had means to provide `` majority of food '' to more than 100 millions of soviet people . 
  that 's why any of `` his sources seem credible '' do not state that `` keep in mind the soviet union was getting massive amounts of aid from the us to keep it going , including the majority of its food '' . 
  moreover , none of his sources name a percent of food provided by the us to ussr . 
  the only cite he gives is cite of nikita khrushchev , but his memoirs are not historical research and can not be considered credible . 
   i recommend to read this comment if you wan na inform yourself `` this comment '' is bs , and a user who wrote it certainly not a historian . 
   keep in mind the soviet union was getting massive amounts of aid from the us to keep it going , including the majority of its food , this is bs . 
  while lend lease played critical role in some production , food was n't one of them . 
  here 's detailed answer by true historians : https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3pa76y/i_often_hear_people_say_that_the_united_states/cw4yywc/?context=3, 
  no sarcasm , just wondering how can these ruskis be so hypocritical when it comes to ukraine . 
  their country invaded ukraine , broke all international agreements it could , killed 10000 ukrainians , and yet they dare to say anything bad about ukraine . 
  moreover , there 're thousands of sites banned in russia , why do even care about ukraine ? 
  they should think more about russia , and maybe someday , after 2-3 centuries , russia will became close to ukrainian level of freedom and human rights . 
  what ??? 
  ukraine has all rights to defend itself from russian agression !, 
  your country invaded and annexed part of ukraine , how dare you to even think about critisizing them ? 
  better watch for youself , ruski, 
  i never said anything close to that !, 
  quait opposit , everything bad in ussr was done by russians , because ussr was basically russian empire 2.0 . 
  russians opressed ukrainians and all other nations of ussr , they forced everyone to learn russian , they literally deported chechens and crimean tatars from their lands . 
  how dare you to even imply there was anything positive in ussr ? 
  russians/commies only able to bring death and suffering !, 
  you accuse me in trolling ??? 
  no no no , i 'm not putinot !, 
  i just want to see ukraine free from any russian influences , such as this horrible concrete `` motherland '' . 
  that 's bad solution . 
  this `` motherland '' is still soviet one , therefore inherently anti-ukrainian . 
  just changing the coat of arms wo n't change it . 
  it should be demolished , just like all other communist/russian monuments . 
  leaving this huge soviet bitch would be an insult for any true ukrainian . 
  it also stands for `` victory '' , victory of russian `` liberators '' over brave upa soldiers . 
  i hope it will be exploded and then giant bandera monument will be erected on its place . 
  slava ukraini !, 
  should be demolished as communist symbol and symbol of oppression of ukrainian people by russia . 
  is n't usa constantly dicking around with russia ? 
  funding their favored candidates and the like - i 'm referring to this one particular incident because it became largely popular https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_mcfaul#russian_opposition_visit, 
   i mean , that 's just not true . 
  yes , it does increase the power of the us , but it 's main purpose is to defend smaller countries . 
  why would countries willingly join if they were to become us vassals ? 
  because their previous vassal just collapsed ? 
  i refer to eastern expansion of nato , do you believe that baltic states are all that independent ? 
  they joined nato exactly because they were unable to maintain their security themselves , essentially becoming us vassals . 
  they also rely on imf and eu economically . 
  without western support , they simply would n't survive . 
   you think britain and france with over 100 nukes each is powerless to stop their ` american overlords ' . 
  of course britain and france have higher degree of autonomy , but it does n't make them fully independent . 
   more importantly , why does it actually matter ? 
  let 's suppose it 's true , nato is just the greater american empire . 
  so what ? 
  countries joined it voluntarily . 
  russia has no business here . 
  well we stated it from discoursing nato threat towards russia . 
  first i proved that nato is an aggressive military alliance . 
  second i proved that nato is us instrument . 
  therefore russia has all legit concerns about aggressive military alliance expanding right to the russian border , and therefore russia has all rights to use preventive measures to prevent this alliance from expanding toward russia . 
  russia is weaker economically and military , so we have to keep nato away from us before it 's too late . 
   i do n't support the attacking of libya , but this is just more whataboutism . 
  `` whataboutism '' is us propaganda term used to close the eyes of their population on us crimes . 
   nato is a defensive military alliance and has nothing to do with the wars in the middle-east , which were single states ( us and uk ) doing their own thing . 
  oh , come on . 
  everyone knows that nato is just an instrument of us geopolitical domination over the europe . 
  no need to play idiot and try to convince me that `` nato is a defensive military alliance '' . 
   russia , in annexing crimea has shown itself to be aggressive not more aggressive than the us & client states . 
   if russia wants to make a nato-style defensive alliance with syria and iran or whatever , go ahead , i honestly do n't care . 
  why did the us & client states invade libya than ? 
  why do they think they have a right to bomb a country they do n't like ? 
  when will their leaders get to the hague court as war criminals ?
