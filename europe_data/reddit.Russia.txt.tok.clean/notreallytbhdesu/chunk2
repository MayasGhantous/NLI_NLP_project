   but before piotr i self-naming of russians was muscovite . 
  that 's fact . ), 
  that 's a bs and you know it . 
  self-naming of russians always was russians and never muscovite . 
   referring to ` kyivan rus ' as ` old-russia ' is a sign of olgyno shill who really needs a bit of integrity . 
  no , it 's a sign of choosing self-names of countries instead of historiographical names . 
  the term ` kievan rus ' was introduced only in xix century by historians . 
  i 'm sure you know it too but it makes you so butthurt that you dismiss this fact and prefer lies . 
  they do n't even write the name of this law . 
  i smell bs . 
   word ` russia ' was coined in early xviii by piotr i. rus ' is much early construct so referring to kyivan rus ' as ` old russia ' is misleading . 
  stop spreading this non-sense and fake history . 
  the word ` russia ' was used by greeks as early as x century . 
  the first documented use of ` russia ' in old-russian is dated back to 1387 . 
  the official name tsardom of russia was adopted by ivan iv in 1547 . 
  the only thing officially bringer by peter the great was the second 's ' , though the usage of double 's ' is dated to the middle of xvii century . 
  it 's obvious for anyone that ` russia ' is just greek version of ` rus ' . 
  so referring to so-called ` kievan rus ' as ` old-russia ' is historically correct . 
  people of ` kievan rus ' called themselves russians . 
  not to mention kiev was only one of the centers of this state , with more ceremonial value than actual importance . 
   again , there were no russian before xviii , not in the meaning you are implying anyway . 
  if you are looking for the moment when ukrainians ( ruthenians ) started to discriminate themself from russians ( muscovytes ) then xii would be best guess . 
  no dude . 
  moscow was irrelevant in xii century . 
  it was a tiny outpost in the border of vladimir-suzdal principality . 
   it is much closer to polish , it may look very similar to russian only because it uses cyrillic alfabet . 
  ukraine in denial .

  israel has population less than moscow alone, 
   like a nation seen a third of their population being wiped iut stop repeating this bs, 
   there was n't any terror attacks or islamists before russia get down with a brutal war and numerous and largely spread war crimes . 
  ahahaha and of course chechens did n't robe something like 500 trains passing through chechnya as early as 1991 , did n't kill legal authorities of chechen-ingush assr , did n't expelled thousands of ethnic russians , ukrainians and armenians from chechnya . 
  there were , but they had no power , and ukraine suppressed them . 
  after the march 16 2014 , ukrane started to actively support them . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hizb_ut-tahrir#crimea - read the links to sources , you will find out how western propaganda ( rfe/rl , for example ) ties to present islamist as poor victims of bad russia, 
  `` tatar parliament '' never had any legal authority even in ukraine before 2014 2 . 
  cutting off electricity is an extremist activity , so russia had all rights to declare `` tatar parliament '' an extremist organisation and ban it . 
   russia is the force behind kadyrov mate . 
  indeed . 
  because kadyrov was the only person able to hold a power in such clusterfuck the chechnya was . 
   russia is the body who also literally genocided chechens , and created a somewhat devout muslim population with a tiny bit vocal extremist salafi community running right and left via terrorising the nation and whining out 20-30 % of the chechen nation . 
  nobody genocided chechens after 1940s . 
  nobody forced chechens to became thugs in the beginning of 90s . 
  nobody forced them to discriminate local ethnic russian population . 
  nobody forced them to rob abandoned military facilities and form illegal armed formations on territory of russia . 
  nobody forced them to assault trains going through their territory . 
  nobody forced them to storm supreme soviet and kill its head . 
  i 'm not even talking about islamism - because chechen nationalism is no better than islamism , it 's the same wild and violent ideology . 
  thus chechen nationalists had to be destroyed . 
   if it was n't for the bloody kremlin and bloody russian expansionism , there would n't be such problems right now . 
  if it was n't the bloody russian expansionism , chechens would still be `` peaceful '' mountain herdsmen robbing nearby towns . 
  because muh human rights , muh genocide , muh deportations and bad ussr . 
  you can pretty much see it in crimea : russia is arresting radicals from terrorist group , but the west is crying about ebil russians literally genocide peaceful crimean tatars . 
  too hard for the local audience :0, 
  i do n't know , is economical education in european schools that bad ? 
  because it seems like many people has no idea what the capitalism is, 
  why do you accuse people in whataboutism ? 
  are you the one too ? 
  well i just wanted to say that it 's not some secret service controlling russia , but the whole system is built around loyalty to regime . 
  glory to russia !, 
  and ussr !, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gftpyjim3ps edit :  shitty actually the quality of the video and animation is quite high . 
  great post , nice thoughts . 
  i bet you would like this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t65swzhabes, 
  was it your plan to trigger russians ? 
  why do you think it 's kremlin ? 
  do you believe there 's something like sauron 's eye in the kremlin that observe everything in russia ? 
  there 're just enough pro-regime people in administration of every school . 
   who are stupid enough to work there during war why do you think there 's only one side in ukrainian civil war ? 
   rf was 35-40 % of ukrainian trade in 2014 , now it 's 7-12 % . 
  and during the same period your gdp plunged for about 20 % . 
  great achievement , absolutely fantastic . 
   as for our citizens , well , they 'll have much more profitable destinations in europe just in a few month . 
  oh great . 
  so you do n't even try to pretend that millions of ukrainians will illegally work in eu . 
  sure the europeans will love it . 
  we both know that russia has a symmetric approach in visa policy . 
  really , why should you care about employment of your fellow citizens ? 
  why should you care about their families living on money they send from russia ? 
  why should you care about economy of your country ? 
  maybe your government should also ban all trade with russia ? 
  fuck all those people , right ? 
  yeah i 'm sure several millions of ukrainians working in russia would like visa regime with russia !, 
  they will thank you for bringing them back from terrible fascist mongoloid-communist horde to progressive democratic european ukraine !, 
  depends on phase of the spring . 
  before the show melts , it looks like [ this ] ( http://www.tema.ru/jjj/drist/4f2c7656.jpg ) . 
  after the melting , it looks like [ this ] ( http://www.tema.ru/jjj/drist/4f2c0421.jpg ), 
  but kara-murza is nobody, 
  b-but how about muh democracy ? 
  why do they want undemocratic country in such a good organisation ? 
  is n't it against nato principles ? 
  ukraine did n't even recognize crimean tatar language as an official in crimea , so no , there were no crimean tatar schools in crimea before the `` annexation '' . 
  at least now there 's a legal basis for such schools . 
  mejlis is not an official organization and therefore has no authority over anyone . 
  nobody hates ( crimean ) tatars . 
  just some of them are very anti-russian , and russian authorities do n't like it . 
   the point is there should n't be visa free travel for ukraine . 
  do n't hurt him that much !, 
  richer than georgia e : spelling, 
  i know your pain,
