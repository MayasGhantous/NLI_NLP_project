  how is formal annexation relevant ? 
  why do you try to present it like annexation is worse than invasion ? 
   but they are irrelevant to the question of nato in eastern europe . 
  no they do n't . 
  they show that nato is an aggressive military power that should be deterred . 
  also yugoslavia was in eastern europe, 
  rojava/sdf are not a country , they are n't recognized un member, 
  from what year should i start ? 
  let 's start from 1990 . 
  1990 - gulf war 1992 - bosnian war 1998 - kosovo war 2001 - afghanistan 2003 - iraq 2011 - libya 2014 - syria, 
   can you stop hating on ukraine for no reason ? 
  but i do n't . 
   have you ever even been to ukraine ? 
  if not , i really wish you would go to ukraine , it 's not the fascist junta that russian state media makes it look . 
  yes i was in ukraine before maidan . 
   in the same amount as united states have to do to britain . 
  no , it 's more like france and frankish kingdom, 
  no no no , you do n't understand . 
  people of `` kievan '' rus ' called themselves russians . 
  the language they spoke was russian because that 's how they called it . 
  therefore their ethnicity was russian . 
  kiev was called `` mother of all russian cities '' by russian chronicle . 
   just the word `` russkih '' in it has nothing to do with russian federation , but with kievian rus ' . 
  ahaha , not this shit again . 
  kievan rus ' is purely historiographical term and was n't used by people of rus ' . 
  and yes russian federation , as a cultural ( not political due to formal annihilation of russian empire during the revolution ) successor of russian empire , and therefore of tsardom of russia and therefore grand duchy of moscow , has everything to do with rus ' . 
  moscow dynasty was direct descendant of rurik , moscow people spoke medieval russian language , were orthodox , shared culture ( such as architecture , for example ) with rus ' and were ethnically russian . 
  meanwhile , `` ukraina '' is much more modern word and did n't exist in any rus ' chronicle . 
  you simply can not deny that all territories marked on [ this map ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a0%d1%83%d1%81%d1%8c#/media/file:kievan_rus_in_1237_ ( ru / ) . svg ) as russian were n't russian . 
  i 'm glad you at least admit that `` actually this phraise is from 882 ad book '' . 
   there are two different words - `` russkij '' and `` rossijskij '' true , and correct translation would be `` russkij '' = `` ethnic russian '' , `` rossijskij '' = `` belonging to russian state '' . 
  that 's why kiev is called `` mother of all ethnic russian cities '' - because kiev was first capital of ethnic russian state . 
  i do not say anything on reddit , i * write * it, 
  weak bait . 
  try more . 
  estonia will bark loud as long as they have uncle sam behind the back, 
  no need to argue with a clown, 
   video of his hamlet performance https://twitter.com/russian_market/status/868334242098548737 do n't fool people : this video was filmed on 7 may and not `` before he was arrested by moscow police . '', 
   we have videos here showing it . 
  they show , how he did n't do anything wrong no , there 's no video of the kid before detention . 
   they also show how a 10 year old gets forcibly removed by adults missing any kind of empathy , or professional skills needed to handle the situation ( funnily enough they call themselves `` child protection '' ) . 
  what would you consider as professional in this situation ? 
  they first talked to the kid , and the kid confirmed that he is on the street alone asking for money . 
  he also failed to say where his parents are . 
  then they started taking him to police , because with is what you do with kids begging for money not knowing where their parents are . 
   as far as i can see it , they simply failed the standard police aplication test or something what is `` the standard police aplication test '' ? 
   by dragging 10 year olds along the ground . 
  they did n't drag him along the ground . 
   by dragging 10 year olds along the ground . 
  you can not understand videos without knowing russian . 
   i seriously would n't want to live in your world , where you call adults dragging kids along the ground `` protection '' . 
  again , they did n't drag the kid along the ground . 
  stop writing fake shit . 
  and yeah sometimes protecting a child is against will of a child . 
  if a child was prostituting himself or driving a car , would you be against police stopping him by force ? 
  i would n't . 
  as i already wrote below , you can pretty much get the situation from the video , if you speak russian , in which i doubt . 
  activists were lying , that 's the fact . 
  indeed . 
  police was n't very professional . 
  but it does n't make their actions illegal or bad . 
  also this law is kinda strange :  \u0421\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043a \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0443 ** \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430 ** how should a police officer understand that a person demanding his name is a citizen ? 
  also does '' \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f '' implies verbal demand or a written one ? 
   is that your opinion you can pretty much understand it from this video https://twitter.com/russian_market/status/868334242098548737 the women filming it was `` mother '' in original facebook post of the activist . 
  the activist claimed that police took the kid from his mother , while swearing on the mother . 
  however , on this video the `` mother '' says she is not his mother , and swears at police officers . 
  she also tried to get into police car , which is pretty much interrupting their job . 
  they had all rights to use force against her . 
  what i do n't understand why did n't they arrest her for doing it . 
  my bet is that they were from child protection department , and did n't had handcuffs with them . 
   what 's wrong with anyone reading sheakspeare ? 
  stop repeating `` sheakspeare , sheakspeare , hamlet !!! '', 
  in every post . 
  it has nothing to do with case . 
  this kid was alone at the street . 
  reading something with his bag open staying in front of him . 
  this is the definition of begging . 
  police should react on such kids . 
  this is their job . 
   this kid did n't disrupt public life , he did n't do anything annoying as fuck and i doubt , that he actively asked for money or anything so it 's just your assumptions . 
  anyway , alone 10yo kid begging for money on a street should attract police attention . 
  especially if these police are from child protection department . 
  father was n't on the street . 
  the kid was alone without mother or father . 
  activists lied that his mother was with him to make it look like police took the kid from his mother . 
  do you understand that hamlet has nothing to do with the case ? 
  police absolutely should react if they see alone kid begging on a street . 
  such kids can be used by abusive parents . 
  they already can be members of gangs . 
   he did n't perform for profit . 
  he did . 
   cops were brutal to boy 's mother who was present and tried to stop them . 
  this is fake news . 
  activists were lying about it . 
  this woman was n't his mother and that 's the reason why police did n't just leave a kid with her . 
  activists also lied about police swearing at her . 
  the video shows that it 's `` mother '' who sweared at police . 
  she also tried to stop them . 
   eu gdp map ftfy, 
   and yet no country in nato annexed the territory of another european country why do you care only about annexations and european countries ?
