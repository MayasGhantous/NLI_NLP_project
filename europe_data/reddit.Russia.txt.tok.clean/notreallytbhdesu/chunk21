  nato invaded iraq , afghanistan , libya and syria . 
  nato supported coups in various countries . 
  nato supported warmonger georgian president . 
  there 're many reasons not to trust and be afraid of nato . 
  but this will not change anything . 
  it 's just internet forum , after all . 
  99.8 % like in the uk https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falkland_islands_sovereignty_referendum,_2013, 
   that is n't an excuse for censorship . 
  indeed  whose journalists have to flee russia for their own safety . 
  sad . 
  what can i do with it , galochka ? 
  nobody reads newspapers in 2k17 also , there 's novaya gazeta, 
  okay . 
  talk . 
  all great evils in history had same excuses . 
  `` they started it first !, 
  '' , `` we just protect ourselves !, 
  '' , `` this censorship only for wartime ! '', 
  etc etc etc, 
  russia will be happy to conduct such referendum because everyone know the result, 
  the bad west with its hypocrisy, 
   why cause i can, 
   a report by credit suisse oh , please . 
  this report was debunked so many times on this sub . 
   after expelling all the ukrainian and importing a lot of russian can you please educate me on how russia expelled any ukrainians from crimea and imported a lot of russians ? 
   some people have suggested a fair and free referendum , with international observers , but i do n't think either side wants that , because politically unpopular . 
  ukraine and the west will never admit any crimean referendums , it 's against their goals . 
  i think ukraine is the best illustration of this phenomenon , 
  just like communism, 
  just the city , because moscow and moscow region are different federal subjects , while most of other major cities are just capitals of their regions . 
  the left one is a legend : it says that 1 square ~ 15000 people , shows a name of the region and its population in thousands the right one is a map showing population of federal districts of russia in millions . 
  well on the image it written that crimea and sevastopol are disputed territories , which is common practice in cartography , as i understand . 
  anyway , this map is intended to show how unevenly russia is populated , and is not serving any political purpose . 
  1 square ~ 15000 people source of data : russian federal state statistics service , estimation of population by january 1 2016 . 
  source of image : http://mikhed.ru/russia-population/, 
  but they do n't . 
  why are you so insecure about proper names ? 
  like they change anything . 
  well maybe that 's true . 
  i 'd say many people in developed countries east much more than they should , hence so high obesity rates, 
   because it 's not healthy proofs ? 
   220.000 officers , 200.000 contract soldiers ... that 's 420.000 non-conscripted soldiers in total . 
  that means the rest of 580.000 presumably active 1 million soldiers at peace time in russian military are conscripts . 
  you got some wrong data . 
  there were around 300k conspirts in 2016 . 
  combined in spring and autumn seasons . 
  so you literally disproved your own previous claim . 
  nice . 
   80 % of russian military is made up of forcibly conscripted soldiers who receive minimal training where did you get this bs ? 
   only reason why we wont hear russians complaining and news reporting of this is putins dictatorship ahahaha ahahaha ahahahahahaha you do n't hear it because you 're on fucking reddit , go to any russian comment section, 
  i would n't trust a user with * trolls_brigade * username, 
  how could i forget that russians are inbred mongoloid subhumans, 
  can it also mean that part of russian economy gone to shadow sector ? 
   i 'd suggest a few subreddits like r/liberta for more objective talk about russia without putin shills . 
  i think it 's reserved for ukrainians, 
   i guess a part of kazakhstan lies west of the ural mountains which means technically in europe . 
  i 'm surprised an ukrainian is so bad in russian/kazakh geography . 
  as you can see on [ this map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/flrxu6t.jpg ) , ural mountains do not divide europe and asia in it 's south-eastern border , in the north of caspian sea . 
  actually , there 's no natural border between europe and asia in this area , despite few rivers . 
  one of the them , [ the ural river ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ural_river ) , is considered to be europe-asia boundary . 
   the ryn desert or ryn-peski desert ( kazakh : \u041d\u0430\u0440\u044b\u043d-\u049a\u04b1\u043c naryn-qum ) , is a desert in western kazakhstan ** and south-western russia **, 
  because belorussian is minority language in belarus . 
   those who remained in russia are people ** with some kind of feeling of responsibility for their country ** this is exactly the same as ** they wanted to stay ** . 
  because any of them can leave country any moment they want . 
   every time they report on an event that can affect putin and his posse . 
  can you prove me every journalists get threatened `` every time they report on an event that can affect putin and his posse '' ? 
  or it 's just another `` speech figure '' ? 
   yeah , and they have so much reach , right ?!, 
  this report fails to even get proper data for internet penetration in russia . 
  they claim it 's 59 % in 2014 , meanwhile [ world bank provides 73 % in 2014 ] ( https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=it_net_user_p2&amp;idim=country:rus:usa:tur&amp;hl=ru&amp;dl=ru ) . 
  therefore there 's no reason to check the rest of it , because they base their conclusions on false data . 
   still pretty tame . 
  because you say it ? 
  okay  also define opposition journalist . 
  any journalist who has any disagreements with official putin 's statements , like his own words or words of his press secretary . 
  any journalist who criticize putin . 
   i guess you implicitly admit , that you also have government journalists then . 
  could you name them please ? 
  [ dmitry kiselyov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dmitry_kiselyov ) , [ vladimir solovyov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_solovyov_ ( journalist \\ ) )  i did n't imply , that there is a problem with getting an alternative view . 
  the problem is in providing that view . 
  oh please next time write what you imply before posting . 
   it 's quite interesting that the editors of meduza decided to leave the country in order to be able to provide an alternative view . 
  it 's also quite interesting that other editors decided not to . 
   the connection between thugs , the russian government and oligarchs is nothing new . 
  yeah local thugs were in power in regions during 90s and late 00s because eltsing did n't give a fuck about the country . 
  fortunately putin came to power and gave some order and law to russia . 
   you wo n't be convincing anybody by pretending that those journalists were killed by local thugs for some minor reason . 
  that 's exactly how it 's happened : some journalist write an article about crimes of local thugs , then he gets killed . 
  no kremlin in this equation . 
   there are n't many left . 
  define many  those who could left the country stop bsing . 
  all of them could left the country by political asylum if they want . 
   the few remaining get threatened quite often . 
  define often . 
   the only outlets with some kind of reach ( actually very limited reach ) are \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0413\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430 and \u0414\u043e\u0436\u0434\u044c . 
  and also millions of blogs and youtube channels . 
  yeah so tame you can hear opposition journalists almost every day . 
   you 're left with meduza and for people who speak german dekoder.org this is false . 
  as i said , there 's no problem in getting alternative view in russia . 
   so that 's it , and here 's a list with killed journalists in russia : yeah most of this list a journalists killed in chechnya or by some local thugs .
