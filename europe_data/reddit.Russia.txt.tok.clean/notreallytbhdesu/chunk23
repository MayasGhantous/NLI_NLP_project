  you drink the alcohol before 21 ? 
  you 're a criminal in the us . 
  i 'm sure every country has some laws nobody cares about . 
  and yes ukraine bans those journalist who go to ldnr `` illegally '' . 
   even according to your `` forbidden journalists '' theory ? 
  it 's not a theory , it 's a fact . 
  go and ask in / r/urkaine if you do n't believe me . 
  i think you know what i am talking about , no need to play stupid . 
  your forgot that both sides shell each other constantly . 
   you are not saying that they are illegally crossing border , right ? 
  that 's exactly what i say . 
  journalists have to cross the border illegally ( from ukrainian pov ) to report about the situation in ldnr . 
  instead of constantly editing your comment , you can respond to mine . 
  saving your current comment so you can not bs anyone in the future :   there 're same stories about torture by ukrainian `` volunteer battalions '' aka neo-nazis with guns . 
    also why did n't they show ukrainians who were raped and tortured by tornado battalion ? 
  it 's an interesting theme , unfortunately rarely discoursed outside of russian-speaking internet . 
   has it ever occured to you that the simple explanation for all of that is that the russian propaganda you hear on all your news outlets is full of lies ? 
  instead of assuming the absurd scenario that the entire world is involved in a global conspiracy to hide ukrainian crimes and rapes in the area of the conflict , perhaps it 's the russian media inventing lies to justify the war russia started there under the lie that the russian minority there is '' opressed by the ukrainian nazis '' ? 
  to vilify the ukrainians and ukraine , so the russian authorities and what they are doing there will get more support from useful idiots ? 
  some of these useful idiots end up being recruited in that war for fake reasons and die there . 
    propaganda ultimately played a key role in russia 's military campaign against ukraine ; it became an effective recruitment tool.within the separatist territories , russian propaganda spurred tens of thousands of ukrainians to take up arms against their countrymen . 
  an enlistment office for the separatist republics was opened in moscow for russian citizens who wanted to join the war . 
  and russia 's false news reports disseminated worldwide via the internet drew foreign fighters to join russia 's proxy army against ukraine -- including from serbia , france , brazil , and the united states . 
  even today on the ukrainian side of the front lines in the donbas , some villages and towns only receive russian broadcast television -- ukrainian tv and news programs are unavailable , except by cable . 
  among the false reports intended to stoke nationalist hysteria were the story of a three-year-old boy who was allegedly tortured and crucified by the ukrainian military in slaviansk , a report on the raising of the levels of the lopan and kharkov rivers so that nato submarines could reach donetsk , a report on the cancellation of the may 9 world war ii commemoration in kiev and its replacement by a gay pride parade , a report that the ukrainians had stopped selling bread to russian speakers , and a report that petro poroshenko , the ukrainian president , was preparing to make hitler 's birthday a national holiday . 
   i saw loads of obvious fake news invented by russian televisions and presented as facts to their audience . 
  no they do n't . 
  it 's forbidden for certified journalists to cross the frontline . 
  that 's why only reports from dnr/lnr are from russian journalists, 
  yeah that 's why ukraine does n't allow journalist to go there ? 
  there were no offenses from any side for like 2 years , so `` invasion '' is a wrong word to describe the situation , nor rebels nor ukraine tries to get more land . 
  unfortunately there 's a part of ukrainian soil that does n't want to be ukrainian, 
  if tornado battalion is lies , then why were they find guilty by ukrainian court ? 
  it seems like you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  unfortunatelly there 're only [ russian ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%94%d0%b5%d0%bb%d0%be_%d0%be_%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%82%d1%83%d0%bf%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f%d1%85_%d0%b1%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b0_%c2%ab%d0%a2%d0%be%d1%80%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%b4%d0%be%c2%bb ) and [ ukrainian ] ( https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a0%d0%be%d1%82%d0%b0_%d0%bc%d1%96%d0%bb%d1%96%d1%86%d1%96%d1%97_%c2%ab%d0%a2%d0%be%d1%80%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%b4%d0%be%c2%bb ) language articles in wikipedia , so i have to resort in google translate :  a criminal case on crimes battalion `` tornado '' was opened in the ukraine in 2016 after the discovery of many facts of crimes against humanity committed on the territory of the luhansk region from december 2014 to june 2015 by members of the battalion `` tornado '' '' [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] . 
  they were found confirmation of different sexual orgies and rapes of minors . 
  the case received wide publicity both in ukraine and abroad [ 4 ] [ 5 ] . 
  court subjected to high pressure from the `` men '' atu [ 6 ] [ also the only english article i found in links ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-battalions-special-rep-iduskcn0q30yt20150729 ) :  andriy filonenko , a founder of the tornado battalion , was equally defiant about accusations against his fighters . 
  eight members of the battalion have been accused of crimes including rape , murder and smuggling . 
  ukrainian officials say one video shows a re-enactment of how members of tornado forced two captives to rape another man ; they also say some 40 members of the battalion have criminal records . 
  why do they try to present it like only ukrainian civilians are suffering ? 
  oh , i know why . 
  because ukrainian government does n't allow journalists to go dnr/lnr . 
  because ukrainian government is very well aware that there 're the same suffering civilians on another side , and these civilians blame ukraine and only ukraine for all what happened . 
  there 're same stories about torture by ukrainian `` volunteer battalions '' aka neo-nazis with guns . 
  also why did n't they show ukrainians who were raped and tortured by tornado battalion ? 
  it 's an interesting theme , unfortunately rarely discoursed outside of russian-speaking internet . 
  stalin did n't kill all crimean tatars 2 . 
  all roa collaborators went to gulag after the war . 
  who was put in prison for supporting navalny ? 
  there were already stories on russian 4chan about people pretending to be gays or political activists and then getting asylum in the eu . 
  so it 's okay to submit conspiracy theories into this sub ? 
  and most of people are okay with just reading the headline and not watching the video ? 
  to more info why this video is conspiracy , read this comment https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bnatu/soviet_liberation_of_europe/dho2t25/, 
  yeah nobody likes false accusations, 
   i 'm afraid i do n't have enough time to watch the rest of it , is it all a / r/badhistory material , or only the first two minutes ? 
  it is all . 
  after this 2 minutes , they also claim that there were medical experiments on people in gulag . 
  they also claim that stalin deported more people than hitler - maybe true , but at least debatable . 
  1:22 - `` special troops were removing medallions from dead soldiers to make them unidentifiable '' - no , you dumb idiots , they collected medallions exactly to identify bodies and send a letter to relatives . 
  i bet you did n't watch a single navalny 's video, 
  a common russian does n't give much fucks about some 70 years old shit, 
  no we ca n't . 
  all soviets were literally genocidal animals . 
  the author probably learned history from company of heroes 2 , 
   russia emerged long after other slavic countries . 
  have much longer history than russia . 
  so your example is wrong . 
  lmao what, 
  russia is russian federation and not russia . 
  yeah surprise . 
  according to russian constitution , everyone can declare himself to have any ethnicity . 
  i 'm sure these woman do n't consider themselves ethnic russian, 
  i still wait for proofs of your words . 
  because haplogroups show that ethnic russians are closer to poles than to serbians . 
  proto-russians , indeed , assimilated a lot of finnic and baltic people during expansion to territory of modern russia . 
  as for assimilation during imperial and soviet times , people did n't really mixed during empire due to differences in religion and low mobility . 
  do n't forget that 90 % of people in the empire were peasants who lived their whole life in one place . 
  as for soviet union , people started to move more and religious barriers were abolished , but again , 80 years is not a lot for complete mixing . 
  you can first go to any generic russian obalst and then go to tatarstan , which was the first imperial conquest of russia . 
  you will note difference in people looks . 
  tatars still look differently from russians . 
  i do n't say all russians are unmixed , many are . 
  expecially in the southern areas and caucasus , areas there cossacks lived before the revolution . 
  but the same people live just across the border in the ukraine . 
  these are not east russians , but buryats/tuvins/yakuts or any other asian people living in russia, 
  what is genetically slav ? 
  i 'm pretty sure genetically russians are closer to poles than to serbians and bulgarians , the grammar of polish and russian languages are also closer than grammar of russian and bulgarian . 
  however , russian and bulgarian are closer by vocabulary than russian and polish . 
  who is the most slavic than ? 
  different in what ? 
  grammar or vocabulary ? 
  also , you said `` russians '' , not `` russian language '' . 
  please explain . 
  how do you measure slaviness ? 
  i disagree . 
  this copypaste has been posted several times on different sites , and it has been proven that most of slavs can understand it very well :  med\u017euslovjanski jest j\u0119zyk , ktory slovjani iz r\u00e5znyh narodov koristaj\u0173t , \u017ee by komunikovali med\u017eu soboj\u0173 .
