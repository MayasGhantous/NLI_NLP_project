  putin is geopolitical paranoid , not genius . 
   common sense and windows updates would have saved you from wannacry . 
  no , common sense wo n't save you because wannacry can infect you even without your doing anything in the internet , you can just turn on your computer and get infected by it . 
   but kaspersky would n't have saved you from wannacry since the virus was n't yet in its database . 
  except kasperrsky is much more than just a database , it also has a tool that dynamically analyses all the processes and can stop mass encryption of your files . 
  and i remember during a war 1000 years ago the conquerors burned the entry city . 
  yeah 1c is propaganda . 
  more news on 6, 
  but they all pay taxes to russia ... 
  your logic is simply flawed, 
  yeah common sense would save you from wannacry  ) ) ), 
  i think the more issue is that modern-day ukrainian was constructed from western ukrainian dialects which included many polish and czech words . 
  emmm ... maybe he just meant something else ? 
  because he was speaking russian , and russian is not his first language . 
  sound on the video is terrible , i can not recognize what he says . 
  anyone has better quality or his original speech ? 
   how much better would numbers look considering that 80 % of russian urban population lives in a badly insulated , miniscule flats in bumfucknowherizavodsk ? 
  leave you stereotypes for you . 
  it does n't matter now bad or good russians actually live - the only matter is the market price of their property . 
   further more , how do you determine the value of a property that has never been sold ? 
  exactly the same way you do it in any other country : by looking at market prices . 
  or do you think there 's something more behind any value in the world ? 
  everything is determined by the market in the market economy . 
  so , let 's look at the property prices : https://www.vedomosti.ru/realty/articles/2016/07/13/648960-vtorichnoe-zhile according to the article , the average price for secondary real estate is around $ 1k per square meter in russia . 
  well , i did n't find statistics of how many square meters the average russian owns , but i really doubt it 's less than 5 square meters . 
  so , the average russian has at least $ 5k wealth . 
  you may argue that it 's an average number and not median , but again , it was price for secondary real estate , meaning 95 % of it is just usual flats in soviet-build commieblocks , something there the median russian live . 
  should i repost my own comment every time someone posts credit suisse `` wealth report '' data ? 
  okay , i 'll do it this time again . 
  https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2013-10-10/just-how-rich-are-russia-s-billionaires -  the bank 's global wealth databook , which containsall the statistics underlying the much-quoted report , says the wealth estimates for russia are based on household financial balance sheets provided by unicredit bank . 
  unicredit has a strong presence in russia , and its numbers are based largely on official data from the russian statistics committee and central bank . 
  but those data cover only financial assets and debt . 
   non-financial assets , particularly real estate , make up a large portion of the wealth of most russian households . 
  credit suisse acknowledges in its report that during russia 's transition from communism , `` most of the housing stock was given away to residents , '' but it grossly underestimates the value of that housing . 
  according to the global wealth databook , there are 767,000 russians with assets of $ 100,000 or more . 
  in fact , there are millions of such people in the russian capital alone . 
   in moscow in 2012 , there was 18.9 square meters of housing per resident , including children . 
  according to independent real estate analysts irn.ru , the average sale price of a square meter of housing this week was $ 5,114 . 
  thanks to the free privatization of apartments , russia 's home ownership rate is a very high 84.7 percent . 
  this suggests that the average real estate wealth of moscow 's 7 million adults should be about $ 140,000 , and that it 's pretty broadly distributed . 
  ** tltr : ** credit suisse do not count real estate in russia , ukraine and belarus . 
  this report is utter shit . 
  they did n't count real estate at all, 
   how many times it ruled in favor of the russian opposition ( e.g. 
  navalny ) and the russian government basically ignored it ? 
  i 'm not sure about all norms about echr rulings in russia , but so far russia ignored at max only one court 's decision . 
  g-translated :  wannacrypt spread of the virus ( also called wcry ) started the day on 12 may . 
  one of the first attack [ undergone spain ] ( https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/telefonica-tells-employees-to-shut-down-computers-amid-massive-ransomware-outbreak/ ) ; where victims were the largest telecommunications company telef\u00f3nica , gas company gas natural , iberdrola , is engaged in electricity supply , santander bank and a branch of kpmg consulting company . 
  in the uk , hackers attacked the computers [ of the health system ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/health-39899646 ) . 
  worldwide were infected tens of thousands of computers . 
   the virus encrypts all files on your computer and demand a ransom . 
  as you can see from the screenshots , in each country appears on the screen in the language of the state : in the uk - in english , in spain - in spanish , in russia - in russian . 
  repurchase the same size everywhere - $ 300 in bitcoins . 
  for the payment is given for three days , then the amount is doubled . 
  `` medusa '' checked few purses , which require attackers to transfer bitcoins ; it turned out that they received 32 transfers for $ 300 by 22:00 on may 12 . 
   in russia attacked `` megaphone '' . 
  this `` medusa '' have told the company 's employees . 
  in social networks , they [ complained ] ( https://vk.com/wall-133310139_14475 ) that the computers do not work , and they can not serve customers . 
   in `` megafon '' , first they said that they have everything in order , but later confirmed the attack . 
  here is what the director of relations peter lidov public :  * the problem is , it is localized . 
  we have all it looks like england . 
  computers encrypt and asked for ransom . 
  making the same . 
  *  * there are failures in access to the data , but the offices are closed now , so no more problems . 
  our connection is working properly , the subscriber is not affected . 
  this has influenced the work of service : that is , if the subscriber calls the operator , he will be able to connect any service using voice commands , but can not log in to your account , because his computer is disabled for security reasons . 
  *  * we have computers infected with the virus . 
  there are many . 
  the number is difficult to estimate , we have a huge company . 
  we disconnected the network that it 's not spreading . 
  *  * i can not say exactly when the attack began on us . 
  around the afternoon . 
  hard to say , in what regions . 
  *  * now it is difficult to assess whether this is a serious threat . 
  this will depend on the development of the situation . 
  we have taken all measures to continue this did not apply . 
  if all quickly repaired , what we very much hope , that everything will be fine . 
  this is an emergency situation , but it is the timing . 
  if delayed for a week , then it is not good . 
  *  besides megafon , russia suffered the attack in the ministry of internal affairs and the uk . 
  according to the sources [ `` mediazona '' ] ( https://zona.media/news/2017/05/12/virusss ) and blog [ ilya varlamov ] ( http://varlamov.ru/2370148.html ) , the interior ministry infected computers in several regions . 
  on `` peekaboo '' also wrote about infecting [ computers in the police ] ( http://pikabu.ru/story/kriptoshifrovalshchik_porazil_set_mvd_5044435 ) . 
  the telegram-channel `` saybersekyuriti & co '' , which is information security specialist aleksandr litreev , [ said ] ( https://t.me/alexlitreev_channel/136 ) that `` the networking department , if not completely paralyzed , is severely limited . '', 
  officially , the interior ministry denied the information about the infection . 
  `` go out planned work in the domestic circuit , '' - [ said ] ( https://www.gazeta.ru/tech/news/2017/05/12/n_10040471.shtml ) the interior ministry . 
  about the problems in the uk [ said `` gazeta.ru '' ] ( https://www.gazeta.ru/tech/news/2017/05/12/n_10040471.shtml ) . 
   in social networks , there have been reports of attacks on `` the messenger '' and `` beeline '' . 
  the `` messenger '' `` medusa , '' said that they knew about the virus , but it did not affect the company . 
  in the `` beeline '' reported that repelled the attack . 
   about an earlier version wannacrypt virus became known in february 2017 . 
  it works only on the windows operating system . 
  [ as he ] ( https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a-massive-ransomware-explosion-is-hitting-targets-all-over-the-world ) writes motherboard , vulnerability used by the virus , similar to the one used by the us national security agency . 
  recently , hackers have published several tools ready nsa for using such vulnerabilities - it seems that other hackers took advantage of them to create a virus-extortionist . 
   microsoft [ has closed a vulnerability ] ( https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx ) , which is used by the virus in march . 
  the site windows producer posted a message calling for renewed . 
  everyone who has been infected , apparently , is not updated . 
   how computers are infected , live you can [ see on this map ] ( https://intel.malwaretech.com/botnet/wcrypt ) . 
  it shows that users were attacked almost all over europe , the usa , china , and latin america . 
  worldwide are infected [ tens of thousands of computers ] ( https://twitter.com/craiu/status/863076786887852032 ) . 
  russians can resort in european hr court too,
