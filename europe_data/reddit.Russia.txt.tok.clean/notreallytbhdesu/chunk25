  it does n't stop amaze me how the '' - sk '' ending in dansk , svenska , norsk , islenska and fryska is similar to the same ending in slavic languages . 
  ahahahaha ahahahaha ahahahaha ahahahaha x 100 ^ 100 ^ 100 ^ 100 ^ 100 ^ 100 ^ 1000 ^ 100 ^ 100 ^ 100 ^ 100 times even turkey was n't allowed into eu , while being long-term nato member and not that poor . 
  it 's obvious that core eu countries ( germany , france and italy ) are not interested in accepting more large countries into the union . 
   france , gb and germany veto 'd their application request out of respect for russian concerns . 
  a year later a war between georgia and russia broke out , and mysteriously , the regions south ossetia and abkhazia claimed independence . 
   mysteriously yeah forget that there was a civil war in georgia in 1990s , it 's totally irrelevant fact here !, 
   you mean this ? 
  yes i mean this . 
  by sighing this pact , poland ruined french and czechoslovak efforts to create anti-german coalition . 
  in fact , poland betrayed france after french help to poland during 1920 war . 
  poland also refused to let soviet army go through its territory to defend czechoslovakia after munich agreement . 
   well , we were taking our territories from plc period ( 1772-1795 remember ? 
  ) , nobody forced you to take it then ( also we were promised during congress poland period that we will get some territories from russian partition , we never got it back ) :p it does n't matter that these territories were `` yours '' 100 years before the revolution . 
  they were n't populated by poles . 
  also some of them were lithuanian even in plc , but poland conquered them anyway . 
  by annexing these territories , poland also broke several agreements with great britain . 
  i do n't say that polish people deserved what happened to them , but the polish state definitely was not good peaceful regime , it played the same geopolitical game everyone played between world wars , so i would n't call it totally innocent to what happened . 
  you know , ussr also had elections , and stalin was n't even formal leader of ussr . 
  however , de-facto , he was . 
  same with finland : mannerheim was de-facto the sole leader of finland . 
   go back to t_d moron thanks for informative answer , 
  yeah for example poles never admit their interwar state was an aggressive military dictatorship that was an aggressor during russian civil war , then pilsudski was best buddy with hitler , then they jointly this nazi germany invaded czechoslovakia , that they had their own pact with germany , that they oppressed jews , belorussians and ukrainians in their state . 
  not alone , but the majority was done by soviet people, 
  you should have visited this sub more , 
  but 2 millions raped by soviets are also estimations, 
  no no no , show me a ** plan ** . 
  those who were deported were collaborators with nazi administration , and these deportations were nothing like ethnic based deportations . 
  nice conspiracy , but there were no such plan in ussr . 
  dude , in 1930s , only 2 countries in europe were democratic : uk and czechoslovakia . 
  the rest were more or dictatorships , including your beloved baltic states , finland , poland and romania . 
  next time you liberate yourself , my little polish friend . 
  userrname checks out, 
  he indeed used ukrainian nationalists to hold poles and belorussians in fear . 
  yeah but they were traitors rather than heroes, 
  but your granddads and grannies were untermenschens , why would they be accepted into wermacht ? 
   measure it in the floating ruble then are you real ? 
  that 's exactly what the op did - mesured gdp in floating ruble instead of ppp, 
  \\  use `` real '' gdp per capita . 
  again . 
   hi i want to seem smart but in really i do n't know anything about economics, 
   current us$ oh , whom do you try to fool ... 
  history does n't know the word `` could '' . 
   you know there are more than that if you claim so , name me them . 
   i mean we 're even seeing belarus pulling further away ( slowly ) . 
  no we do n't . 
   you ca n't really deny that russia has kind of been a shitty state to it 's neighbours . 
  i can not deny that some russian policies were ineffective , but i would n't say russia was a shitty neighbor for , say , ukraine . 
  it was ukraine who was shitty neighbor for russia , [ see another my comment itt . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/69jee7/she_fixed_ukraines_economy_and_was_run_out_of_her/dh7hg2v/ ), 
  that was the price for your county 's debts and bad behavior . 
  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia%e2%80%93ukraine_gas_disputes :  a serious dispute began in march 2005 over the price of natural gas supplied and the cost of transit . 
  during this conflict , russia claimed ukraine was not paying for gas , but diverting that which was intended to be exported to the eu from the pipelines . 
  ukrainian officials at first denied the accusation , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] but later naftogaz admitted that natural gas intended for other european countries was retained and used for domestic needs . 
  the dispute reached a high point on 1 january 2006 , when russia cut off all gas supplies passing through ukrainian territory . 
  [ 4 ] on 4 january 2006 , a preliminary agreement between russia and ukraine was achieved , and the supply was restored . 
  the situation calmed until october 2007 when new disputes began over ukrainian gas debts . 
  this led to reduction of gas supplies in march 2008 . 
  during the last months of 2008 , relations once again became tense when ukraine and russia could not agree on the debts owed by ukraine . 
  [ 5 ]  in january 2009 , this disagreement resulted in supply disruptions in many european nations , with eighteen european countries reporting major drops in or complete cut-offs of their gas supplies transported through ukraine from russia . 
  [ 6 ] [ 7 ] in september 2009 officials from both countries stated they felt the situation was under control and that there would be no more conflicts over the topic , [ 8 ] [ 9 ] at least until the ukrainian 2010 presidential elections . 
  [ 10 ] however , in october 2009 , another disagreement arose about the amount of gas ukraine would import from russia in 2010 . 
  ukraine intended to import less gas in 2010 as a result of reduced industry needs because of its economic recession ; however , gazprom insisted that ukraine fulfill its contractual obligations and purchase the previously agreed upon quantities of gas . 
  [ 11 ]  on june 8 , 2010 , a stockholm court of arbitration ruled naftohaz of ukraine must return 12.1 billion cubic metres ( 430 billion cubic feet ) of gas to rosukrenergo , a swiss-based company in which gazprom controls a 50 % stake . 
  russia accused ukrainian side of diverting gas from pipelines passing through ukraine in 2009 . 
  [ 12 ] [ 13 ] several high-ranking ukrainian officials stated the return `` would not be quick '' . 
   a lot of the former soviet states want to get far away a lot ? 
  i know only 5 out of 14 non-russian ex-ussr states , namely 3 baltic states , ukraine and georgia . 
   pretty sure russia is a big part of the reason why ...  it might be good for russia to reflect on why that is . 
  because russian economy is not able to provide 1st world living standard for citizens of these countries , so they decided to join another alliance . 
  do you understand that `` threatening '' and actually doing are different things ? 
  no matter that russian government said to yours , it was your government decision to buy russian gas from another countries, 
  ukraine itself worked hard to ruin it 's economy . 
  they lost their biggest trade partner for political reasons , but got nothing new from it . 
  ahaha , no , it 's your government decided not to buy gas from russia . 
  nice try to spin the situation, 
  what do you mean by `` poor as fuck '' ? 
  compared to the richest countries on the world ? 
  maybe . 
  compared to the rest of the world ? 
  no , no and no . 
  no matter what article is about - the user with irish flair and `` cpt _ '' start username will shit on russia . 
  edit : ahaha , i like how you linked to non-original video . 
  nice try to get views to your shitty grey channel, 
  but regular people are not being banned for visiting crimea . 
  stop making shit up . 
  you 're not more serious source than that documentary, 
  but what about muh economy half of italy ? 
  one of the moscow grand princes was blind https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasily_ii_of_moscow, 
  why do you think so ? 
  cyprus is not poor at all , bulgaria and croatia are on the level of hungary , latvia and lithuania . 
  but what if i think trump , le pen and navalny are not neo-nazi ? 
  literally hitler !, 
  he has time for : 1 . 
  going to echr again and revoke rulling again ~ ~ 2 . 
  ask russian constitutional court to change law regarding presidential candidates , because according to russian constitution , the candidate should not be in a prison to be elected , and navalny is not in prison . ~ ~ so , technically he is not disqualified , even more , the official presidential campaign has not been started yet . 
  edit : i has wrong , russian constitution does n't say that candidate should not be in prison . 
  instead , it 's the federal law about elections of the president . 
  it says ( [ source ] ( http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_law_40445/5f6de1c0ea61774e2877e7081ea5d058fc27c764/ ) , google translated ) :  5.2 . 
  the citizen of the russian federation has no right to be elected president of the russian federation :  1 ) sentenced to deprivation of liberty for committing a grave and ( or ) especially grave crime and having , on the voting day , an undefined and outstanding conviction for the said crime ;  1.1 ) sentenced to deprivation of liberty for committing a serious crime , the conviction of which was withdrawn or repaid - before the expiration of 10 years from the date of the removal or repayment of the conviction ;  1.2 ) sentenced to deprivation of liberty for committing an especially grave crime , the conviction of which has been withdrawn or repaid - before the expiry of 15 years from the date of the removal or repayment of the conviction ; but navalny is not sentenced to deprivation of liberty , he is sentenced to suspended sentence . 
  the only source of `` navalny has been disqualified '' statement is the central election commission of the russian federation - which has no rights to change federal laws .
