  i do n't like this chart because it does n't say what countries are `` eastern europe '', 
  and against immigrants . 
  if he was in the west , he would be far-right . 
  but in russia , opposition is not left or right , it is more like rule of law against corruption and mafia-state, 
  saudi arabia and usa are friends , who is who then ? 
  i do n't think his relatives , especially young children , deserve their personal data to be leaked and they being bullied by anonymous army, 
  i 'd like to add , personal data ( his address , telephone number , email , names , photos and numbers of his relatives ) of one attacker has been found by users of anonymous board 2ch . hk - basically russian version of 4chan . 
  thanks for showing your talent again ) ) ), 
  it 's just / u/pm _ me_your_ladyboys . 
  i remember him from previous discussions , he is absolutely illogical and unreasonable redditor . 
  do n't get him serious , he does n't even try to be so . 
  russia is as warm as the rest of europe during summers , and in the south it 's even hotter . 
  russian climate , in fact , more * continental * than typical european climate , meaning that russian winters are longer and colder , and summers are shorter and hotter . 
  just to add one more example : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5luthf5hhva, 
  soviet union also abbreviates as `` ss '' in russian . 
  therefore , soviet union = nazis, 
  i do n't get it , is it some kind of national victory for romania ? 
  it looks kinda similar to what pro-putin russians ( aka vatniks ) do when the us or eu has any fail, 
  if anyone still interested : the corpse has been identified . 
  here 's russia wikipage about the general : https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%93%d0%b5%d0%b9%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bd,_%d0%92%d0%b0%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%b9_%d0%90%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%81%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b4%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b8%d1%87, 
  that 's some strange borders . 
  why did you included kaliningrad and western ukraine , but not the rest of russia , ukraine and belarus ? 
   you 're awfully defensive about this . 
  i 'm awfully sceptical to all anti-russian bs op ties to spread . 
   you , as a russian , are probably just about as brainwashed as the typical american , if not more so . 
  point me out on then there 're i 'm brainwashed . 
   to people who still deny that russia is deliberately manipulating public opinion in western countries :  does russia have anything to gain by turning people against pro-eu/pro-nato and anti-russia policies ? 
   the answer should be obvious to anyone who has ever opened a history book so your * proof * that russia is `` deliberately manipulating public opinion in western countries '' is because russia may profit from it ? 
  that a wonderful propaganda method , or maybe you 're just not smart and believe it yourself ? 
   their economy is already being crippled by sanctions false , russian economy is crippled by low oil price more than by sanctions . 
   are not viewed as a partner by the vast majority of countries on the planet vast majority of countries on the planet absolutely view russia as a panther . 
  oh , wait , you 're american , it 's typical for americans to view themselves as a center of the universe and say `` world '' than in reality it 's just usa & client states, 
  but what about syria ? 
  [ california is rightful russian land !, 
  ( no ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fort_ross,_california ), 
  so it 's just nato words about evil ruskies doing evil things because they 're evil . 
   i might not have linked an article which says `` 9 made by russia in 2015 '' , there are many many more articles and sources that says this tough , but i have n't linked them because i did n't do a good search for them . 
  i linked the first four when i searched for violations . 
  this is simply showing that it is occuring quite often by all our neighbours . 
  then can you please provide a link for `` 9 made by russia in 2015 '' ? 
   are you unaware that russia does this ? 
  if so , read other sources then russian ones . 
  i 'm aware that western media like to post clickbait/propaganda with no violation happened . 
  i 'm also aware that western people , swedes in particular , tend to believe it because they hear it all the time . 
   the real resaon for russia being mentioned a lot more than say danish and american violations is that russia never responds to swedish claims that they violated our air space , they never clear things up . 
  nato countries take responsibility and talk to us so it never becomes news that an american plane entered our air space for 20 seconds while yours does because you fail to communicate . 
  i 'm not aware if there 're any international protocols demanding russia to explain such violations . 
  i 'd say $ 450 is the minimal rent for 1 bedroom apartment in moscow, 
  dn article is under paywall  https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/tolv-krankningar-av-svenskt-luftrum-i-ar  denmark and the united states are at the top , with three violations each . 
  in second place comes norway with two violations , while france , germany , russia and estonia account for one each . 
  so russia is n't even the top violator according to the article . 
   http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/aktuellt/2014/09/svenskt-luftrum-krankt/  two russian su 24 violated wednesday swedish airspace south of \u00d6land . 
  the incident occurred at noon swedish time and the russian plan was one kilometer into the swedish territory . 
  the violation lasted for about 30 seconds . 
  okay , this one is legit . 
  but ... only 30 seconds ? 
  does n't seem like a serious trouble . 
  also it 's from 2014 . 
   https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/forsvarsmakten-om-den-ryska-krankningen the article about the same accident . 
  so , no violations since 2014 ? 
  and how many violations before this case in 2014 ? 
  so your `` in 2015 there was nine confirmed violations by russian military aircraft in sweden alone . 
  they even did a `` test bombing '' of stockholm with nuclear capable bombers . '', 
  claim is pure bs . 
   responsible countries do n't send planes capable of delivering nuclear weapons just outside the edge of other countries ' borders-especially in a region where doing so is near a number of countries ' borders . 
  ahaha , plz , nato sends planes to russian borders as often as russia does it . 
   military jets entering other nations sovereign airspace when was the last time russian planes entered * sovereign * airspace ? 
  and california !, 
  and hawaii !, 
  you lost one m, 
  because it 's immoral to kill innocent people ? 
  mmmm ... 
  concentration camps for russians, 
  wow , i think it deserves to be posted in / r/dataisbeautiful, 
  are you underage ? 
  if so , then do n't be gay ^ ( this was anti-gay propaganda so they would think i 'm a proper russian ), 
  you say it like it 's something wrong with being gay, 
  i 'm a butthurt vampire, 
  lol , you do n't even bother to read comments before posting a butthurt reply, 
   stole i doubt it was officially proclaimed so . 
   and your current government did actually acknowledge that . 
  source ? 
   however the full monetary value that was about to be paid back is nowhere to be seen . 
  did czechia ever tried to get it back ? 
  because russia pays bills for all soviet debts . 
   russia is free to join nato if it pulls out of crimea , donetsk , southern ossetia and abkhazia ahahaha , plz stop , you ca n't be that naive . 
   it 'd also be great if they did n't use their natural gas to wage economic war with all of the former cis states . 
  nobody waged `` economic war with all of the former cis states '' , actually , belarus is geting lower price just because it 's belarus , and gas dispute with ukraine was totally justified because ukraine stolen russian gas . 
   oh , also it needs to stop rigging elections and let the osce monitor elections . 
  why did osce refuse to monitor crimea referendum ? 
   what happened in saratov what happened in saratov ? 
  everything bad happening to you is completely deserved . 
  it is . 
  why are you afraid of declaring your nationality via flair ? 
  what properties ? 
  i also do n't know what exactly happened with official soviet-estonian relationships during ww2 , and what happened with official russia-estonian relationships after dissolution of ussr , so i can not say the answer . 
  it 's not my `` saying '' , it 's the historical fact : ussr did n't recognize itself as succeeder of russian empire , therefore any treaties with russian empire were n't recognized by soviet government . 
  golden national treasures were given to russian empire , which does n't exist anymore 2 . 
  ussr was n't successor state of russian empire 3 . 
  therefore ussr and russia has no obligation to return/compensate it .
