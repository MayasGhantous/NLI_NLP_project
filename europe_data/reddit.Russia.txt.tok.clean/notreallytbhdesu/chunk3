  i think most of libyan air defense was either captured by rebels or destroyed by nato missile and air strikes . 
  i just copied the tense from op 's message . 
  combat helicopters will be destroyed by field-tier aa systems , such as [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zsu-23-4 ) , [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9k33_osa ) and [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2k12_kub ), 
  the problem with you is that you use comparison just for the sake of comparison , with no regard to reality . 
  `` putinjugend '' is nowhere as large scale as hitlerjugend was or boy scouts is . 
  thus you 're essentially a propagandist , caring only about your own agenda . 
  you also ignore that boy scouts has political agenda too , in particular , american nationalism , and as any nationalism , it includes * hate * for everything non-american . 
  [ trying to copy the best western experiences !, 
  ] ( http://www.nj.gov/military/publications/guardlife/volume32no3/scouts.jpg ), 
  yeah it 's better to be a coward and sit at home in silence . 
   march 20th haha no , it 's the worst time to start invasion , because snow only start to melt , then rivers start floods , and all land turns to mud . 
  funny how the picture is still from right to the left , like arabic script . 
   but medical research into why painful periods happen in the first place do they teach you about menstruation in biology class in croatia ? 
  because you know , reason of painful periods is well know for many years , and so are methods to stop them : many contraception pills for woman stop menstruation . 
  any ethnic conflict in post-ussr ? 
  even if both nations in conflict fought each other for decades before . 
  funny how most of people here are unaware of conflicts in central asia , i bet they would blame russia too . 
  released by whom ? 
  it 's also strange that ukrainian government does n't publish the name of the killer , but already published another info about him , claiming he was recruited while serving in ukrainian volunteer battalion and was trained in russia by fsb . 
  4 days later : the best reddit humorist / u/blueeyeblonde69 repeat the same joke for over 9k times, 
  or how small putin and medvedev are, 
  do they at least pretend there was some kind of investigation ? 
  it 's still possible to construct a language that all slavs will mostly understand , but some words will seem very archaic . 
  they also reported he was ukrainian citizen with criminal history, 
  i do n't know dude , you 're obviously not russian if you think echo moskvy and novaya gazeta are `` just a mouthpiece for the kremlin '' . 
  and again , your appeals to `` this is well known '' are shit, 
   list of killed / poisoned activists and opposition politicians :  almost all these cases were evidently assassinations . 
  but you 're nice equation them with accidents . 
  yeah sure kremlin made up echo moskvy and novaya gazeta reports . 
  stop spreading nonsense, 
  you 're free to reject the definition of statistics . 
   i linked to you the facts you linked me one case from 2007 . 
  that 's nothing . 
  one case is not statistics . 
   you are n't special you are like millions of americans and russians who refuse to believe what does n't support the agenda they want to believe . 
  no dude , that 's you who do it . 
  you did n't link me anything , but still claim `` there is no credible research to people like you . 
  what the fuck is it ? 
  are you even serious ? 
  you 're the one who reject reality and scientific method and believes your own conspiracy . 
   but the rest of us are n't buying the accident excuse . 
  no , you 're buying your ill imagination and stereotypes , you tried to appeal to statistics - but you failed . 
   basically 99 % of the world are colluege in this conspiracy against poor putin . 
  oh , so now you try to appeal to `` 99 % of the world '' . 
  i know this tactics . 
  the tactics of someone who has no argument beside `` it 's just common sense ! '', 
  or `` everyone knows it 's true ! '' . 
  the same tactics that was used against anything new in this world . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's legal for underage to come to political demonstrations . 
  also i do n't understand how the case with school principal justifies the teacher from the post, 
  it 's right that he is fired . 
  any political activity is banned at russian universities , schools and colleges . 
  you do n't understand what argument mean , do you ? 
  do n't you understand what your `` estimates '' of probabilities are not arguments , do you ? 
  you have n't linked me any creditable research that would prove that `` which tell you that being mugged / killed / dying in an accident is much more likely for an opposition activist in russia compared to pro-government activists '' . 
  but your colleague in conspiracy , / u/x11x2 , even tried to present one link from 2007 as a proof of your common point : that all deaths of all opposition activists in russia are murders of bloody putin regime . 
  http://www.rbc.ru/society/27/11/2014/5476fdc7cbb20fd24dde6cc9 http://www.mk.ru/incident/2016/11/10/vypavshie-iz-okna-mat-i-syn-okazalis-rodnymi-vitaliya-kaloeva.html http://rovego.livejournal.com/4397391.html just a little yandexing '' \u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0430\u043b \u0438\u0437 \u043e\u043a\u043d\u0430 '' disproves your point '' in russia compared to pro-government activists ( to which these things never happen , basically ) '', 
  so you deny that ukraine is an extremely corrupt country ? 
  also , why do n't you set-up your flair ? 
  it would be easier for everyone to understand why you have a bias . 
   it would be easier to compile a list of people putin likes than does n't like . 
  then by your logic putin killed most of people in russia ? 
  what kind of nonsense is it ? 
   nor could i link to every putin critic who accidently fell to death i 'd be posting links all day everyday for months . 
  because putin critics do n't fell to death every day ? 
  it 's the simplest reason why , but of course you want to believe into conspiracy that every putin critics accidentally die . 
   here is just another example  http://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-reporter-dies-in-5-story-fall/ are you real ? 
  it 's from 2007 , literally 10 fucking years ago . 
   when every murder of a dictatorshit is labeled as an accident the accidents pile up fast . 
  when you interpreter every accident as a murder by some mysterious special forces , then you 're conspiracist . 
  yeah wheel chair disabled woman is a threat to national security of ukraine !, 
  how can your country be that insecure ? 
   how everyone putin does n't like either falls off a building or threw a window , always accidently or eats polonium by accident . 
  do you have a list of all people putin do n't like ? 
  do you have a list of people who falls off a building ? 
  if no , then all your arguments are invalid and conspiracy . 
  more like expert on ukrainian reality . 
  iran also have some stupid laws ukraine is new iran . 
  or saudi arabia . 
  chose yourself . 
  maybe they will ban all ukrainians going to crimea too ? 
  because they actually allow people to visit crimea , but only if they cross ukraine-russia border in crimea . 
   what list ? 
  this list http://mincult.kmu.gov.ua/control/uk/publish/article?art_id=244966871&amp;cat_id=244966805  a list of people who pose a threat to national security, 
  `` all those '' is like once a year ? 
   wow , it 's really surprising that anyone who drinks water dies after time !, 
   they get old , fall , get beaten by muggers , incidentally ingest poison , and have heart attacks while jogging . 
  how strange !, 
  here , educate yourself before falling into conspiracies : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/survivorship_bias, 
  funny thing you did n't even read the article before posting it . 
   the russian newspaper novaya gazeta suggested nikolai gorokhov had fallen after a winch snapped as he tried to lift a bath to a fourth-floor apartment , though details of the incident remained murky . 
  i meant new , democratic , free of russian-installed puppet regime ukraine !, 
  new ukraine , the country of liberty and great european civilization !, 
  not `` new '' , but `` new '' . 
  slava ukraine !, 
  i think most of people in crimea are aware of shit going in new ukraine , and honestly , compared to ukraine , russia is not that bad . 
  * thanks opposing to him oligarchs who took power in ukraine, 
  i estimate my wealth from 666 to 100500 trillion , i 'm the richest man on the earth !, 
  do you understand that making things public is one of the few ways to get justice ? 
  the guy should be the first to write about it on his vk or fb page and call all opposition media ?
