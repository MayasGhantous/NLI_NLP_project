  ok wiseguy , got any credentials to back up that smugness ? 
  hippie jargon my ass , people were systematically killed off in these countries for us strategic interests , an entire generation of argentinians ' status is still unresolved because of the dirty war , and the regime initiated the falklands war , was that really the end that the means justified ? 
   however quite often it 's not latin america they are criticized about , it 's the middle east by who , redditors ? 
  you made a blanket statement that everyone that criticizes the us is unintelligent , which is just your baltic kissassing to your security guarantee . 
  just because you have a good time under their wing did n't mean others did as well , and vice-versa for the ussr  vietnam was the same ah so the persecution of buddhists by a catholic dictator was clearly all about kicking out the soviets , sure .

   and most people hating on america just are far too unintelligent . 
  tell that to the people that had to deal with their juntas , i 'm * suure * they 'll see it the same way, 
  yea i should 've known better, 
  not really menacing , who does n't like barrel rolls ? 
  harvard boys were too busy fucking up the country , russia back then was also pretty trusting of america , so they had our undivided attention . 
  us actions and endorsements screwed any potential for any kind of us-russian alliance, 
  yo fuck off , russian food is delicious . 
  who are you to talk about what we do or do n't like , your ass ca n't speak for me or any other russian, 
  grandfather was a cleaner , he gets preferential treatment in all state buildings like museums and concert halls, 
  and what ? 
  chinese people will suddenly be flowing in ? 
  into a region that gives nothing of value to china ? 
  use your head, 
  literally the stupidest parallel to be made , considering how crimea was russian even while it was under ukrainian state control , whereas the russian far east has neither a significant chinese population , but also no historical control by either the prc or the roc that preceded it . 
  what is with this weird fetish you people have for mythical support for the prc in the russian far east ? 
  neither ethnic russians nor the mongols and turkic peoples living there want to have anything to do with the prc, 
  pretty sure yea , ren tv imo was always just a pretty silly channel , they 're one of the few that show softcore porn after midnight , it is n't a news channel , it 's an entertainment channel, 
   ren tv  respectable \u0425\u0410\u0425\u0410\u0425\u0410\u0425\u0410\u0425\u0410\u0425\u0410 that 's a good one, 
  in kalmykia , it 's very much a national symbol , but either way it 's unlikely that he will be imprisoned for long , right now he is in pre-trial detention, 
  but this is n't exactly imposition either , they are n't converting himto buddhism . 
  he is being punished for desecrating a national symbol, 
  yet it was still predominantly roman-catholic, 
  so as an example , would you have preferred poland be completely divided between a german-speaking protestant west and a russian-speaking orthodox east after the partitions ? 
  because buddhism in russia is specifically tied to the cultures of the kalmyk , buryat , and tuvan people , who have started to rehabilitate their culture after long years of religious suppression by the state . 
  the dagestani was in kalmykia and desecrated something very important for kalmyks as a people , and the people responded, 
  allegedly , the survey is still out , but there is a strong case for jewish russian and kalmyk, 
  if you read the history of the conflict , you 'll know that there is more nuance to south ossetia , in that the first conflict ended with multilateral peacekeeping, 
  they attempted to become an assr , which as you know is subnational, 
  well schedule of stay can be basic , my trip there was pretty ad hoc and was n't really planned too much , and i did n't have any issues . 
  and yes you need to tell duration of visit for obvious reasons , my visa lasted for only 2 weeks iirc ( i already had a passport replacement since then ), 
  that 's understandable , but it should n't come to a surprise that these people would want to politically separate what they view as their land , especially at an opportune moment like the dissolution of the ussr, 
   dagestani officials [ it was the head ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apbvw0xye2o ) , he looks so uncomfortable standing next to orlov, 
   why does someone has a right to cleanse a region of georgian population and `` self-determine '' at the expense of georgian state and people , taking away our lands ? 
  because georgians were also involved in ethnic cleansing , or did you somehow forget about the shitshow that was the georgian civil war ? 
  a country can exist without recognition , or is taiwan and somaliland a myth ? 
  that 's only when it 's just a c instead of a ch, 
  i had a japanese visa and i do n't really think they needed the daily routine , just contact info , hotel reservation , proof of ability to support yourself , stuff like that, 
   the reason there are no good opposition parties in russia is because of putin . 
  oh please , and how does putin do it , read their mind and have him arrested ? 
  you 're making this out into north korea , which is absolutely dishonest . 
  i 'm saying sometime in the future there is potential for new faces to bring change , as the economy develops and diversifies further , but in the current political climate i do n't expect anyone , because out of everyone who gained power from the soviet collapse , putin really is better than the oligarchs and their puppets . 
  putin is `` our own '' , he worked for security services and established relationships with the economically-liberal lawyers of st. petersburg , not to mention his policy of focusing on the maintenance of a multicultural society rather than just going `` rossiya for russkikh '' like navalny and his ilk, 
  there was plenty of opportunity for someone to arise in 13 years , but nobody did . 
  nemtsov was already corrupt back then , and the oligarchs were siphoning as much of the country as possible, 
  honestly i think any presidential candidate not already associated with some power would have probably been wacked by an oligarch, 
  i never said he could , but it 's not like putin can do anything either . 
  and just because your limited view thinks that putin forces the opposition look so stupid , does n't mean that is the reality . 
  the reality is that people like kasparov and navalny are the opposition , and they are both pretty unlikeable . 
  either way , putin still has his critics , from all political sides . 
  you have a very skewed view of who putin represents politics-wise in russian society . 
  russia belongs to putin not by much more than the us belongs to obama or china to xi . 
  it 's ridiculous to not expect that the job of leading a large and powerful country having pretty serious perks , the only difference is that the economic classes in russia only arose 20 years ago in a very chaotic state . 
  either way russia still very much belongs to russians , you want to see an example of what you are projecting , look at turkmenistan, 
  i 've been over this already a lot , the increase in oil prices would n't mean shit if he did n't bring the resources back under actual state control , and the prices alone did not help restore law in order in a country where people were being killed off in their driveways daily , not to mention his steadfast foreign policy, 
  not equally , putin * is * the improvement over yeltsin , and general consensus is that as of right now , he is still the better choice inb4 `` brainwashed russian '', 
  yea , people think that if we had the glorious opposition in power we would n't have these levels of high-end corruption , which is pretty silly, 
  i do n't really think i even care , considering the fact that it 's being described as a sanctions-evading measure . 
  this does more damage to western countries by simple virtue that this is more or less their domains of influence running these side-shows, 
  northern ireland speaks the same language as the uk in total , flanders and wallonia do not, 
  [ they 're not denying it ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/lifestyle/the-moscow-times-ukraine-bans-russian-films-for-distorting-historical-facts-358380.html ), 
  this conflict arose before either was independent , so international treaties are a shit reason, 
  a lot of these changes like the downvotes , moving banner , and shitty sidebar formatting was done after i had left , but i 'm interested in seeing what parts i did cause issues . 
  thank you for taking the time to break it down for me ) ), 
   look at the red lines to the left of this box ? 
  the red lines are so you do n't get lost in the file hierarchy , it helps keep track of who replied to who  the inbox icon is hard to see . 
  the div that that 's in seems too thick or somehow strange . 
  yea the icon color choice was a mistake , the width however is weird because i triese to get it to play along with vanilla reddit and res  the constant scrolling images seem to turn the fan on in my computer i agree , it 's a bit of a useless feature  the image on the right is overlapping text . 
  used to be much better , it was just a simple outlined coat of arms , they dun fucked it up :(, 
  this is why places like / r/europe and / r/russia are horrible places to discuss anything to do with russia , because both subs have a bunch of circlejerkers that just spew shit all day , nuance is absolutely dead here and there, 
  thanks , it was necessary when i implemented the css from naut , otherwise there was just no way to differentiate comment levels on some screens . 
  they did the same thing last year but with communism, 
  what 's the problem ? 
  his people too , nato-russian war * will * lead to nukes, 
  you do realize in your scenario , you will be nuked to shit right ? 
  [ oh please ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/vladimirputin ) , outside syria the independent very much makes digs at putin, 
  it 's very much pro the russian position , because the joint russian-syrian-iranian position in syria is making significant progress on the ground . 
  if the independent wishes to be respected as a publication , it needs to accept the reality on the ground , there is n't really much of an angle the editorial can push to take a jab at the kremlin . 
  [ it 's essentially vyshivanka , even if english wikipedia calls it only ukrainian ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a1%d0%bb%d0%b0%d0%b2%d1%8f%d0%bd%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%8f_%d0%b2%d1%8b%d1%88%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%ba%d0%b0 ), 
  yep , that guy 's talking out of his ass, 
  said russian oligarch was exiled ( from political power ) and has used his ownership of the independent to attack putin , so your argument falls flat here, 
  on a serious note : not enough of an effort into reconstruction . 
  i can understand having afghanistan not be too dependent on us support , but they could have taken the time to invest into the society more,

  i 've never really seen a pedestal for them in we , but i would agree that there is probably something wrong with communicating with middle eastern communities, 
  you know damn well that it is n't just muslim that is a defining feature , tatars and bashkirs do n't do this shit in russia , even migrants do n't do this shit, 
  does surrogacy get both genetics or only one ? 
  ( i actually do n't know ) adoption is not the same , neither is infidelity and not only is the science not there , but it would probably cost as a service , not at all the same thing as procreation . 
  ten walls certainly did a number though, 
  and just how exactly are they able to do that without either an egg and a sperm ? 
  you forgot the organ harvesting, 
  the difference in syria is that they did n't bog down , are still keeping a presence , and secured a ceasefire with the local partner staying strong , which is completely different than afghanistan and vietnam,
