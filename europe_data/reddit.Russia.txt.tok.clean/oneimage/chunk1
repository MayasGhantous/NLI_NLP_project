russian history has started in 862 with the capital at novgorod . 
  it was de facto banned by the parlament on [ 23 february 2014 ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%97%d0%b0%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%bd_%d0%a3%d0%ba%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b8%d0%bd%d1%8b_%d0%be%d0%b1_%d0%be%d1%81%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b0%d1%85_%d0%b3%d0%be%d1%81%d1%83%d0%b4%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b9_%d1%8f%d0%b7%d1%8b%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%be%d0%b9_%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b8%d1%82%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b8 ) , then it was vetoed by turchinov . 
  it was before ban of russian language and insane ultra-nationalistic rhetoric . 
  [ gallup ] ( http://www.bbg.gov/wp-content/media/2014/06/ukraine-slide-deck.pdf ) : 82.8 % of crimeans agree that referendum was fair . 
  there are 200 dollar billioners , and a shit load of millioners , i personally know several . 
  salary for average people in biggest cities was also raising during the last 10-15 years quite fast . 
  $ 2000 - $ 4000 with a tax of 13 % or without taxes ( `` grey salary '' ) is not at all that bad . 
  it was before current economy crisis though . 
  `` orthodoxian russian values '' russians are religion indifferent . 
  only 3 % go to churches on sundays . 
  that special orthodox values is more of a label , or a way to feel identity than a real stance . 
  it feels like `` russia versus the west '' is a part of political show and nobody really belives it except tin foil hats minority . 
  your childish profanities are not impressive . 
  independence was proclaimed by crimean parliament which was a legitimate institution at that time in ukraine . 
  crimea was also an autonomous republic . 
  but i 'm sure western media did n't bother to give you such information . 
  ignorance is bliss . 
  russia was paying rent for the base ( about $ 100m/year ) . 
  ukraine was also given a $ 100 discount for gas for the right to rent for 25 years . 
  total amount of investments were estimated at $ 40 billions . 
  at the same time ukraine was threatening not to renew the contract after 25 years and to make a new with americans . 
  it 's no wonder that russian crimean majority decided to proclaim independence . 
  it was their third try in case you do n't know . 
  the last two attempts were suppressed by ukranian government . 
  since when have you become an expert of russian history ? 
  here is a [ photo ] ( http://loveopium.ru/content/2011/12/ussr/909.jpg ) of one of the biggest moscow protest during 1991 . 
  it was against gorbachev and pro-baltic independence . 
  look at flags . 
  i do n't know what you americans are imagining about the dissolution , but every russian would tell you it was an internal decision to change for the better . 
  here is another [ photo ] ( http://www.forbes.ru/sites/default/files/slideshow/2012/02/04_tass_45006.jpg ) from a demontration of 600 000 -800 000 people . 
  it was a rally in support of the updated holistic ussr , for civil peace , consensus and further democratization of society . 
   just a blatant attempt to deny 1991 happened . 
  1991 was an act of goodwill . 
  many republics gained independence breaking soviet law , but no consequenses were applied . 
  but everyone seems to look at it , like only at a major fail and weakness , so it 's obvious now that there is no point of making kind gestures . 
  there is much more sence in producing more atomic warheads . 
  there is [ evidence ] ( http://www.navytimes.com/article/20140425/news08/304250065/eucom-dismisses-reports-secret-u-s-base-crimea ) that us had plans to make military base in crimea . 
  such things can drive anyone mad , considering the amount of russian soldiers [ bloodshed ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_sevastopol_ ( 1941 % e2 % 80 % 9342 ) at the peninsula . 
  did i say i believe it ? 
  the truth is in the middle , as always . 
  diplomacy fail and political issues become military issues . 
  nothing new here . 
  there are undeground ways outside the airport , and constant rotation of ukranian army . 
  separatists say they kill up to 30 soldiers a day . 
  what 's wrong with poland and ukraine ? 
  you are supposed to dislike russia . 
   i do n't understand where you have this idea that things are going to change where somehow russia is going to surpass usa 's economy . 
  that 's not what i was saying . 
  hegemony is not permanent in this world . 
  british empire , france , spain were dominant countries at some points of history , but they all declined and never recovered . 
  the us economy is already surpassed by the eu . 
  i do n't blame the us for benefiting from ww2 and ww1 , but it must be understood that it was due to geography ( luck ) , not due to talent . 
  luck ca n't be permanent or relied on . 
   russia has always been lagging behind in tech and industry compared to the western world . 
  russia spent a lot of resources to defend its borders for almost one thousand two hundred years . 
  you are protected with oceans , so you do n't understand what it 's like to be surrounded by hostile countries . 
  western world is very diverse . 
  there are some countries that are better at something but they are better than 90 % of countries in the world . 
  and russia btw is a part of the western civilization ( white christian ) though it 's nothing special to be proud about . 
   usa can match the entire economy of russia with a single state out of fifty . 
  that 's what happens when you benefit from 2 world wars . 
  but things change . 
  the same reason russia did n't reached it 's potential yet . 
  russia is still recovering from communism and dissolution of the ussr . 
   also what i said about russia threatening countries that try to trade with eu is 100 % absolutely true . 
  serbia is in association with eu and they are amongst our best partners in europe . 
  we 've got no problems with finland also . 
  the problems start to happen when the us is involved . 
   poland is growing and russia most definitely is not . 
  since when ? 
  if you 're talking about the last 23 years it 's a joke . 
   those ukrainians out in the street that had legitimate complaints and were being killed by the government for protesting were all bought off by cia . 
  you mean protesters that started to kill cops ? 
  it was a tiny bit of population . 
  it was tiny even [ comparing to other countries ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bzn_dmtiaaa2ro7.png ) protests . 
   look at the track record of countries that have joined eu . 
  why would ukraine shut down industry in their own country ? 
  because their industry is old and ca n't compete on western markets . 
  the same thing happened with a lot of eastern block countries . 
  take a read about croatia for example . 
  they ended up with closed industry and nothing but hotels and huge loans , and hotels are now owned by international companies . 
   those countries that used to be occupied by russia and now are part of nato and eu are now richer than russia . 
  another nope . 
  russia is at top 10 by gdp . 
  2 positions after germany . 
  and rf is welthier by gdp per capita than poland . 
  while poland has 320\u00a0000\u00a0000\u00a0000 $ ( 320 billions ) of help from eu . 
  it 's somewhat funny because ukranians take poland as an example of success . 
   refuse to trade exclusively with them . 
  it 's not true . 
   conspiracies everywhere . 
  i gave you a link to a history fact . 
  that is how the world is . 
  it 's not like your media or government tells you . 
  be critical not only to your government opponents points of view . 
  there are people that do not want to be a part of pro-western ukraine . 
  it 's their natural right for self-determination . 
  they want to be with russia , because association with eu means that ukraine ( donbass ) industry would be shut down . 
  and russia helps them to gain what they have a right to have . 
   maiden was homegrown .
