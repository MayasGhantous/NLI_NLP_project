  putin had not . 
  he 's a thief and a liar . 
  kant has nothing to do with russia whatsoever . 
  we do n't learn his works in school , i think that most people are not even aware of his existence . 
  i think that we have some famous people that deserve to be exposed at international level . 
  more like annexes the dumpster and then being fined by police . 
  stupid , irresponsible and pointless . 
  putin is pro-soviet , pro-communist and pro-gulag . 
  he went batshit crazy when ukrainians started to demolish lenin monuments . 
  btw a jewish mother makes her children jewish by their standards , speaking of lenin . 
  i 'm not against jews . 
  jews ( like russians ) had a rough history , i have empathy for them . 
  but bolsheviks had disproportianate jewish influence and representation , you ca n't deny it . 
  we are using the name `` gollandia '' . 
  he 's talking about black penises, 
  czechian wars in the 90s were brutal . 
  it does n't change anything in the chart above . 
  the bolshevik party = ussr 1.5 % of population ,  90 % at highest ranks . 
  the first communist government of ussr ( 1918 ) : \u2022 chairman of the cpc - ulyanov ( lenin - mother blank ) - jew \u2022 the people 's commissar for nationalities but - dzhugashvili ( stalin ) - georgian \u2022 the people 's commissar for foreign affairs - chicherin ( meyendorff on mother ) - jew \u2022 the people 's commissar of agriculture - proshyan - jew \u2022 people 's commissar of army and navy - bronstein ( trotsky ) - jew \u2022 chairman of the supreme economic council - lurie-larin - jew \u2022 the people 's commissar for recovery - schlichter - jew \u2022 the people 's commissar goszemel - kaufman - jews \u2022 the people 's commissar of state control - lander - jew \u2022 the people 's commissar of public works - schmidt - jew \u2022 people 's commissar for social care - lilina-knigissen - jew \u2022 the people 's commissar of education - lunacharsky ( mendelshtam-baile ) - jew \u2022 the people 's commissar of religion - svalbard - jew \u2022 the people 's commissar of public health - anvelt - jew \u2022 the people 's commissar of internal affairs - apfelbaum ( zinoviev ) - a jew . 
  \u2022 the people 's commissar of finance o hooke - jew \u2022 the people 's commissar for press - volodarsky ( kogan ) - a jew . 
  \u2022 the people 's commissar for the affairs of the election - uritsky - jew \u2022 the people 's commissar of justice - steinberg - jewish \u2022 the people 's commissar for evacuation - sheginshteyn - jew . 
  [ `` we ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_congress_of_the_russian_communist_party_\\ ( bolsheviks \\ ) ) as a former great-nation < ...  have to put yourself at a disadvantage < ...  only with such a policy , when we artificially put ourselves into a position lower in comparison with others , we can get trust of the formerly oppressed nations '' all ethicities had ethnic republics and representatives except russians . 
  [ that 's ] ( http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/qwax/27518561/13139/13139_600.jpg ) how it looked economically . 
  political correctness is not about shutting mouths , it 's about gilt for wrong thoughts and punishment for words that are against current norms of thinking . 
  just take notice how american liberals invent labels for african-americans . 
  btw , i consider myself as a liberal and a democrat . 
  the problem that american liberals are left and closer to ussr communism than to liberalism and democracy . 
   the nazis hated on jews for no reason . 
  except that jews had a disproportionate representation in communist revolution which led to a totalitarian state , red terror and later gulag . 
   jews taking over the world and trying to exterminate the aryan race . 
  well , my great-grandfather was killed just because he was a ~ ~ fucking white male ~ ~ a person of a wrong social class - [ `` kulak '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kulak ) `` peasants with a couple of cows or five or six acres more than their neighbors '' were being labeled `` kulaks '' . 
  his children were raised without a father . 
  ussr was a state of minorities , ethnic russians were oppressed the whole time just because they were white ( `` former oppressors '' ) . 
  yay marxism and radical left !, 
  hahahahaha :(, 
  we 're fine , everything is [ ok . ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/cardfight/images/e/e3/post-64231-this-is-fine-dog-fire-comic-im-n7mp.png/revision/latest?cb=20151003200010 ), 
  for purposes of propaganda . 
  it 's better to know how common are attacks at other people in the areas mentioned in statistics . 
  that 's too . 
  you must be extra stupid to think that isolationism that led ussr to collapse will bring rf something different . 
  that 's 99 % true . 
  he just know nothing , we must tell him !, 
  elections are extremely rigged . 
  there is new candidate maltsev from parnas party ( party of a killed putin 's critic nemtsov ) . 
  he called for the impeachment of putin on the central tv 's parlamentary debates . 
  he also said that the revolution will be on 05 november 2017 . 
  so there is at least something new . 
  also communists were always loyal to regime . 
  because we lack liveless cold climate soil . 
  another pointless attempt to be seen relevant while economy solidifies as shit . 
  i wonder how many years our stupid nation has till we start building a new open and democratic country again . 
  because ukraine ca n't into country , you silly . 
  lithuania . 
  yeah , two backwards anti-west non-democratic totalitarian regimes ruled by unelected class that uses principles of nepotism and corruption . 
  so fundamentally different . 
  [ there is no need to be upset . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygr5ahufbn4 ), 
  you can pretend that putin is a grand master of political games , but in reality he 's a sociapth , rules cleptocracy and he 's already losing . 
  the more he plays `` games '' the bigger the negative impact will be in the end . 
  ussr 2.0 is going the same way as the initial ussr , to the collapse . 
  it 's not a game , you idiot . 
  putin 's propaganda will turn full mad chimpanzee . 
  stalin was a fascist himself . 
  carry a pepper spray and a knife . 
  one armed person could have stopped that terrorist . 
  it 's videogames . 
  before the current events , i thought , that you guys were more progressive in terms of democracy and liberalism , but now i 'm not sure . 
  and the worst part that your `` dear leader '' gives example to our `` sun king '' . 
  you 're wrong . 
  you can joke whatever you want , but adidas became expensive again . 
  so it 's kind of a luxurious thing now . 
  thanks to putinomics . 
  yes, 
  he was also at the opening of a huge hotel that belongs to the son of a attorney general of rf . 
  long story short he 's a corrupted cynic that does n't believe his own words . 
  i 'm too . 
  we 'll get rid of him soon . 
  he has nothing to offer . 
  at his first terms he was pretty cooperative with the west . 
  he was somewhat adequate comparing to 90s . 
  the economy was growing and his course to stability was appealing to most people . 
  but at some point stability was changed with war with the west and economy growth - with corruption . 
  fuck putin 's corruption and his servants . 
  he 's a local russian minority !, 
  totally fair, 
  the fair, 
  imagine trump amd putin ruling 2 hemispheres of the world . 
  it 's not russia , it 's kgb . 
  to dress them in a putin costume and to do outrageous things to them . 
  february revolution was democratic . 
  it did n't last . 
  the country started to fall apart , and it led to horrible consequences . 
  haha , that 's really sad . 
   culture that simply ca n't produce any viable leaders aside they are terrorized at the minor level . 
  people got their skulls crushed for anti-government activity . 
  like [ this ] ( http://novayagazeta.livejournal.com/258118.html ) editor in chief of a local newspaper . 
  the crime is still unsolved and he 's dead . 
   russia has been doing this to its neighbors for years . 
  so you 're saying it 's justified . 
  which is my point .
