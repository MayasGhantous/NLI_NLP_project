  and which makes totalitarian-oligarchy in russia stronger . 
   and do n't try anything new we tried communism once . 
  it was a new thing . 
  would n't recommend . 
  i 'd like to read a scientific research if it 's even possible to change anything in russia . 
  it looks like the state system in a current historical and political situation is a trap . 
  and also the moment when russia starts to revolt , eu and us will start to promote ethnic separatism as hard as it can be done . 
  and it will end with a big civil war that will spill over neighboring countries . 
  the situation is definitely related to migration . 
  it 's about [ 260 km ] ( http://anapacity.com/images/pages/razmery-chernogo-morya.jpg ) from crimea to the shore of turkey , but i understand your point . 
  the only issue that carrier is sinkable unlike the land base , and the land base is also better protected overall . 
  what 's advantage of a carrier over the land bases at the shore ? 
  the true joy of rus - annoying people . 
  sadly , we ca n't change history . 
  i bet they watch russian tv . 
  you 're right , and it slowly changes , but it 's a touchy subject . 
  nobody wants to provoke ethnic nationalism by changing soviet ethnic policies/borders . 
  because being assimilated by a small nation is wrong , as they probably feel . 
  we have a saying that roughly translates into `` do n't try to improve the thing that functions '' . 
  yes , but with different grades of autonomy . 
  some subjects have only minor cultural autonomy or only nominal , while other have political autonomy , like tatarstan or chechnya . 
  not so long ago these republics had own presidents , that were renamed into headmans recently , to strengthen integration . 
  there is no need to be upset . 
  [ it 's a soviet thing . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autonomous_republic ), 
  the map is not the territory . 
  i would n't rely on car roads . 
  it is [ known . 
  ] ( http://demotivation.me/images/20111004/yzim107xqkk2.jpg ), 
   a whole course on how russia works !, 
  there is no such course . 
  nobody knows how it works . 
  asian israel in the far east without the jews . 
  only in russia . 
  lol, 
  it 's almost a week . 
  6 days 20 hours . 
  the correct division is by [ ethnic republics ] ( http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/russia_auton_92.jpg ) / [ different regions ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/russian_regions-en.svg/2000px-russian_regions-en.svg.png ) . 
  some republics have ethnic russian majority though . 
  like jewish autonomous oblast with 1 % of jewish population . 
  keep in mind that ~ 20 % of russian federation population are asian minorities . 
  ethnic russians and poles are the same genetically . 
  and it 's the same with height . 
  counting all russia as a one cluster is incorrect . 
  p r i v e t, 
   dozens it 's about 500 in moscow and 150 in saint-pete . 
  our term is red-brown . 
  and it 's already happenned . 
  at least for the state propaganda . 
  [ this investigation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrwlk7_gf9g ) on corruption of the prime minister . 
  the film has english subs in case you 'd be interested to watch it . 
  no , we do n't . 
  you mean bars that will be destroyed by the amount of drunk celebrating people ? 
  will you take him in a cage ? 
  the sub looks like a typical putin 's bot place . 
   i dont read russian so you have no idea what he 's talking about , but it 's somehow bad . 
  that 's hilarious . 
   to kill human cockroaches how about you stop using false quotes ? 
  have you noticed that he has a photo of famous terrorists in the video ? 
   `` open a window . 
  do you see that bridge ? '' . 
  `` no , i do n't see any bridge '' says korean minister . 
  `` one hundred percent '' , african minister replies . 
  that 's exactly what happens in modern russia . 
  so you do n't have an actual quote to back your words . 
  that what i wanted to see . 
  do n't lie next time . 
  they did n't mention it . 
  there were much more than official 8k people . 
  putin 's officials always lie . 
  i do n't see any nationalism at his website or in his party programme . 
  can you give an actual quote where he compared people from cacasus to cockroaches ? 
  it 's really bad if you compare rf to a normal country . 
  the level of corruption is african . 
  ukrainian maidan was almost recently , and was very similar to 1917 revolution . 
  navalny is very mild . 
  he 's not far right or radical at all . 
  he 's a lawyer . 
  1917 proves you 're wrong . 
  like regular politicians in western countries that occur when dictators are jailed . 
  da , it undoubtfully very cool . 
   special care or it ca n't even have calves so like a regular bodybuilder, 
  from people with alternative morality . 
  the statistic is invented by the evil west to disgrace glorious motherland , so it 's ok . 
  red terror was a policy of lenin and the first communist government . 
  it was before stalin . 
  he 's a fascist in a modern form . 
  with an illusion of freedom and democracy . 
  i 'm not defending hitler in any way . 
  but germans did n't want the same fate as russians . 
  red terror played a huge role in rising of nazism . 
  it was also one of the reasons why holocost happenned . 
  fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete , and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties . 
  such a state is led by a strong leader -- such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party -- to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society . 
  fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature , and views political violence , war , and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation . 
  fascists advocate a mixed economy , with the principal goal of achieving autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies . 
  its going to work like it worked with the ussr . 
  the economic pressure and positive propaganda about west and democracy in conjunction with methods of resistance to totalitarian oligarchy can make wonders . 
  if you want to get rid of the putin threat you need to help russian opposition . 
  the video is about ordinary life .
