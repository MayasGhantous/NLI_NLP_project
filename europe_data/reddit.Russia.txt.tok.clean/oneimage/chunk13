  did n't you notice how everything is destroyed ? 
  now compare it with ordinary life in the west . 
  my point was that we do n't live in the same world . 
  it 's more like parallel realities . 
   people know what 's wrong and what is right . 
  no , they do n't . 
  moral is submissive to culture . 
  some cultures considered human sacrifices a `` right '' thing . 
  look at people at daesh/isis . 
  do they know what 's right ? 
  you have to teach what 's right . 
  without culture people are animals . 
   do n't love the fact that they are being feared again . 
  fear means respect in russian [ culture .

  it 's also a part of soviet cultural heritage which we carry . 
  ussr before the collapse had 100 % approval rating . 
  these numbers do n't mean much . 
   russians live in the same world as i do haha , you 're optimistic . 
  watch this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvf5bvnud_4 ) . 
  and now imagine that the only source of news is full-blown propaganda . 
  we live in different worlds . 
  russia is a real dystopia . 
  keep that in mind . 
  the more you are prepared the less chances are that we will have to fight . 
  it 's not russia , mate . 
  it 's quasi-kgb regime and putin . 
  how what ? 
  ypu want me to tell you how putin concentrated all power in his hands and has zero responsibilities ? 
  it will be a long speech , but i think you already know it . 
  lebedev gets contracts from the state . 
  he has an interest . 
  he 's also a son of a soviet nomenclature mother . 
  putin is a real fascist here . 
  navalny is the opposite . 
  he 's a democrat and a person from people and respects people . 
  lebedev is a dumbass . 
  the talk is predictable . 
  they need to get more 3rd world refugees . 
  it should counter balance the white males rape culture . 
  my friend 's wife drank wine several times during pregnancy , because she read on the internet that it 's ok to drink a little . 
  and red wine is even good for health . 
  my words that ethanol is poison and that she shared blood with her baby was n't taken into consideration . 
  the girl was born ok , but i 'm shure she was somehow affected . 
  i 've hidden almost all of my `` friends '' news in vk just to save time . 
  i heard somewhere that it 's a good practice to unsubscribe from several sources of info every week . 
  the site is more comfortable for the the older generations . 
  facebook is too foreign and vk is more for the young people who listen to the music . 
  the only rome , and the last rome . 
  except the real rome . . 
  it leads you to much worse things . 
  i would n't recommend to go to russia to drink . 
  except you 're in 100 % trusted environment . 
   making super intelligent and physically superior humans . 
  so . . romanians, 
  you 're right . 
  but i think that it 's easier to underestimate the horrors of totalitarian states . 
  people tend to idealize everything . 
  he participated in the `` russian march '' it was a big meeting of all patriotic and nationalist movements at the time . 
  it was a pretty diverse event . 
  navalny openly speaked against illegal immigration , but nothing extreme . 
  putin 's immigrant policy is a disaster , the system imports workers from central asia gives them budget manual and other blue collar jobs and then expoits the workers by taking a portion of money to themselves . 
  their rights are violated in many ways . 
  we are talking about millions of illegals . 
  the local population suffers too . 
  unemployment is high and security is n't great . 
  but putin 's officials make billions in that system . 
  that 's interesting . 
  chp is saving you from full-blown totalitarianism . 
  it 's somewhat similar to modern russian communist party that has a lot of respect from the old people and the working class . 
  but in our case they do n't defend secularism or modernism , they defend abstract social justice , but never openly critisice corrupted putin 's oligarchy . 
  the initial communist party - kpss was banned after the dissolution of the ussr . 
  the modern communist party - kprf is fake . 
  they play as opposition but they never act against the power . 
  their leader is just getting older and speak the same working people oriented chants . 
  partiya rosta - is a more recent invention . 
  they are economically oriented , but it 's basically a product of politology . 
  yabloko is real , but they have bad reputation , because they were strong in the 90s , during the great stealing by oligarchs when the economy was transitioning from state plan to capitalism . 
  they have anti-popular reputation as liberal snobs . 
  navalny is an interesting guy . 
  he 's liberal , he 's moderate russian nationalist , he has a normal family , educated and has good personal reputation . 
  there are some rumors that he 's bashing corrupted politicians when he 's given inside information from the elites , but that 's just rumors and even if it 's true it does n't make him less favourable as a politician . 
  he recently told that he will be participating in the next president elections , but considering the level of fraud and state propaganda , i would n't be overly positive about that fact . 
  i 'd be voting either him ot maltsev , another interesting guy , more brutal type , and an old politician who proclaimed revolution at 5 november 2017 . 
  so it looks that you have pretty strong parlamentary opposition . 
  that means that your situation is much better than in russia . 
  our parlamentary opposition is fake , they are all openly pro-putin . 
  and our `` non-systemic '' ( real ) opposition is treated like extremists . 
  i wonder if erdogan will start to fraud the elections like putin . 
  do you have opposition ? 
  we should totally have a competition in the most retarded political system . 
  it 's hard to go over the top , when you are describing a country that was based on the policy of red terror . 
  as i remember the main anti cavalry force were lancers in a roman formation . 
  i do n't remember any artillery , though . 
  `` gib constantinople now '' ftfy, 
  machiavelli wrote that infantry is stronger than cavalry in a fight . 
  if you want to understand the ussr read 1984 . 
  the book is very accurately describes the atmosphere of socialist dictatorship . 
  it even has a happy ending .
