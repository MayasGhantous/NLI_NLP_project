  i 'm not mentioning insane anti-russian propaganda that was all over ukraine for 23 years . 
  you can tell about them stoopid zombies all day long , but keep in mind that fighting people usually have serious reasons to fight . 
   is russia in europe ? 
  on a scale from one to high , how 10 are you ? 
  of course russia and even moscow in europe . 
  the european continent ends forming ural mountains . 
   omsk you missed a continent bro . 
   then again we are northern europe pfff , everyone knows you 're western russia . 
  bro , do you even lift ? 
  not dumb , but literally zombies , ruled by literally hitler . 
  3 months of the conflict have only confirmed that they are different . 
  and that my `` radical statements '' were even not as bad as occurred events . 
  * as for `` kremlin bot '' accusations , you can call me whatever , i 'm not hiding under other nation 's flag . 
   homophobia homophobia is often a religious thing . 
  most of the russians are indifferent to gays and to religion . 
  though gays are considered eccentric . 
   intolerance intolerance and hate are perceived as negative phenomena . 
  with such amount of native people of different ethnicities and religions russia would have fallen apart without tolerance . 
   oppression it does n't apply to your average joe . 
  the opposition had a hard time during protests of 2011 , when they tried to overthrown the government and to get similar results to ukranian maidan . 
  btw the us involvment was very noticable too . 
  there are a lot of people and fractions that criticize putin 24/7 in russia . 
  liberals , democrats , new opposition , some communists and anti-capitalists even soviet dissidents . 
  it 's still much better than at ukranian or at russian liberal sites , where everything that does n't fit or question current anti-russian agenda is downvoted to hell or/and leads to a ban . 
  so this sub is getting at least some freedom of speech . 
  the fourth picture is a piece of a russian caricaturist . 
  his [ journal ] ( http://ellustrator.livejournal.com/ ) . 
  yeah , putin 's evilness is giving ukraine a reason to bomb ukranian civillains . 
  that 's brilliant . 
  or what ? 
  ukraine will proceed to shell civillians ? 
  they wo n't stop because a lot of them are thinking that south-east is populated by russian bugs , or whatever they call not-enough-ukranian russian speaking regions . 
  i 'm saying that they did n't plan to shoot a civillian plane . 
  they thought it was ukranian military , that constantly bombs them . 
  real terrorists shoot civillians on purpose . 
  ( [ like this ] ( http://www.infowars.com/ukrainian-air-force-fired-over-150-missiles-at-lugansk-bombed-admin-hq/ ) ), 
  they did n't shot the plain on purpose though . 
   russians are being raised that if there 's a problem , the stronger guy wins the argument . 
  but does it solve a problem ? 
  or russians in your opinion ca n't solve problems , but only argue ? 
   they have no knowledge of discussions , they do n't even think about finding solutions like that . 
  i 'm curious how did you get such profound knowledge of russians ? 
  i 'd also like to see some facts that can prove your point . 
  like from russian cultural artifacts for example . 
  i do n't think it 's hard to get visa for a person from a developed country in any way . 
  if you decide to visit russia try saint-petersburg it 's a very beautiful place since a lot of historical architecture was renovated after the 90 's . 
  by the way we 've got an annual celebration of saint patrick 's day , we are irish friendly . 
  it looks similar to metro carriage design . 
  you 've got a classic case of soviet [ whataboutism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ) , which is an invalid argument . 
  by the way i 'm not interested in arguing . 
  the man asked why latvia is included , i gave a link as an explanation . 
  ps you also keep in mind that the picture in the tread does n't resamble russia in any serious kind . 
  it 's a personal opinion of some painter or/and a joke . 
  [ road police post ] ( https://www.google.ru/search?q=%d0%bf%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82+%d0%b4%d0%bf%d1%81&amp;newwindow=1&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=pti5u-o-pmb14qtpo4gwbg&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq&amp;biw=1639&amp;bih=974 ) is a standard thing in russia . 
  here is a [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dczejnangna ) . 
  it is chechen republic of ichkeria and `` caucasus emirate '' that have lost the war to russian federation . 
  it looks like a typical police post to me . 
  there are posts like this outside of all big cities . 
  they are used to block cars in case of special police operations and to filter the flow to search criminals . 
  on the other hand you must be happy to gain the freedum . 
  there is nothing more permanent than a temporary thing . 
  popular proverb in russia . 
  calling an opinion `` propaganda '' is propaganda in itself . 
  ca n't people fight for the right to be part of a more prosperous country ? 
  talking about crimea , gallup found out that 82.8 % of crimeans agree that referendum was fair . 
  [ page 28 ] ( http://www.bbg.gov/wp-content/media/2014/06/ukraine-slide-deck.pdf ), 
  crimeans are pretty much ok without ukranian burnings and bombings . 
  people voted for the most reliable guy , but it does n't mean they 're less nationalistic , or overthrown president with 80 % of supporters in south-east in a legitimate way . 
  and military `` invasion '' happened in a place where up 20k russian troops could have been stationed according to treaty . 
  so it 's not that black and white . 
  russia is 23 positions higher in human development index than ukraine . 
  rf is also far welthier and is still getting better . 
  and ukraine would fall even lower without russian aid and resource discounts . 
  or it 's time to make another language official , like in a lot of civilized countries . 
  especially that up to 80 % of ukranians speak russian language everyday . 
  of course if they want to lower the tension . 
  says who ? 
  do you have statistics on the topic ? 
  i highly doubt you 'd say the same if your language becomes irrelevant in your own country . 
  i 've got a couple of close ukranian friends and a few acquaintances , my best friend is half ukranian , i 've got relatives in ukraine , i understand ukranian language and read ukranian press though i did n't learn it . 
  do n't say it 's a half world away , it 's not true at all . 
  yeah it means that you ca n't get a higher education in your own language , to communicate with the authorities , to be represented at courts , and etc. 
  it 's not a minor thing . 
  your side does n't look multidementional either . 
  especially when you 're chanting the same thing like a zombie . 
   i 'm not even surprised by that so , it 's ok then ? 
  and these people are trying to convince the world that they 're concerned about equality . 
  lol, 
  everything that i heard on the topic could be summarized to `` learn ukranian or gtfo to russia '' . 
  it 's just your interpretation of the situation . 
  nationalism is very strong in ukraine and the course of derussification is very clear . 
  i do n't understand why ca n't they make russian a second official language . 
  there are a lot of countries with several languages . 
  it 's not a problem in canada or switzerland , but in ukraine where 80 % speaks russian it 's suddenly a hell of a problem . 
  it was n't putin that tried to ban russian language . 
  it was n't putin that taught children to shout [ `` hang the muscovites !, 
  '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyxtoxtndpc ) a year before the second maidan . 
  genetically ukranians are the same as south russians . 
  and the majority of ukraine is still using russian as main language . 
  so there is really almost no difference .
