  sure you can force differences and old grievances but nobody benefits from it . 
  modern day ukraine has nothing to do with kievan rus . 
  these are different countries hundreds of years apart . 
  and by the way ancient rus chronicles are written in ancient rus language , not ukranian . 
  and they are written about russian people not ukranians either . 
  i do n't think they need to test reactions , they know what people want ( stable wealthy life and to minimize damage from dissolution of the ussr , by retrieving russian lands with russian majority ) . 
  rogozin makes what he is said to and tells some patriotic/troll stuff as usual . 
  he tries to get an image of a popular good guy patriot . 
  but he 's a government functionary , not a parliament politician . 
  the educational standard was pretty high in the ussr , especially in exact science . 
  it lowered after the dissolution and in the 90 's , like everything else , but the system was recovering during the past 5-10 years . 
  you are talking like there were two kinds of powers inside russia that have competed . 
  in reality kiev was a centre of russian political power ( not ukranian ) , and at some point the capital and the elites have moved from kiev to moscow . 
  there was no ukraine or kievan rus as a state before the revolution for hundreds of years . 
  peasants were main carriers of the ukrainian dialect . 
  zhirik has always been a troll . 
  nobody takes his words seriously . 
  it 's obviously not a good way to test real opinions . 
   why it is so hard for these russians to admit that there is ukrainian language and culture because ukranian nationalism is anti-russian . 
  and it harms both sides . 
  ukranians were recognized as south russians before the revolution and their language was recognized as a dialect . 
  that 's why it was n't in schools . 
  also , there was not such thing as eastern ukraine . 
  it was a bunch of governorates of russian empire . 
  most of the eastern regions were given to ukraine by the soviets . 
  and by the way most of ukranians are still using russian as main language . 
  except some far western regions . 
  there is still almost no difference between russians and central or eastern ukranians . 
  i do n't think so . 
  he has been recognized as a loud fool for a long time . 
  and in addition he 's not edgy or smart like in the 90 's , he 's just an [ old sad clown ] ( http://grozny-inform.ru/loadedimages/2013/10/30/zhirik.jpg ) . 
  it 's not rare either . 
  [ according ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/education_in_russia ) to a 2008 world bank statistic 54 % of the russian labor force has attained a tertiary ( college ) education , giving russia the highest attainment of college-level education in the world . 
  russia recognises rla as collaborators and criminals . 
  while latvia has [ legion day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvian_legion_day ) , when soldiers of the latvian legion , part of the waffen ss , are commemorated . 
  we were learning german as a third language in school . 
  i wish i had more practice though . 
  you ca n't erode culture having an ethnic republic . 
  it 's the opposite . 
  many people just have a different opinion . 
  everything i said is based on facts , like it or not . 
  how the attack on south ossetia ? 
  these people were annexed to ukraine before . 
  23 years is nothing . 
  not to mention that polls in war times ca n't be not biased . 
  ukraine left russia without discussing borders , taking regions with traditionally pro-russian people and while ussr majority has voted against the dissolution . 
  now the same thing is happening to them . 
  they voted while armed revolutionaries threatened them . 
  some deputies were beaten . 
  and by the way they did n't even get the required amount of votes . 
  all treaties became nullified at the moment of unconstitutuinal takeover . 
  revolutionary government represents no one but a bunch of oligarchs , nobody elected . 
  ukraine has detached itself from ussr on the same conditions as crimea . 
  ussr people even voted against the dissolution . 
  but ukranian bosses of the party decided they new better . 
  so they 've taken land that has never been their and proclaimed independence , while russia stayed to pay soviet debts and to fight for integrity of the country in caucasus . 
  23 years later ukraine from the wealthiest soviet republic became 3 times poorer than russia and now its even worse . 
  i do n't understand why russia should respect this situation . 
  there should have been negotiations on terms of the dissolution . 
  it 's like someone steals your car , rides it couple of days , than gets frightened by your reaction and decides to silently give it back . 
  it 's not `` nothing '' , it 's still a crime that gets you to prison . 
  they were not obliged to be locked up inside bases . 
  plus you need to consider that ukraine was having a bloody revolt at the time . 
  the law `` on the principles of the state language policy '' was aimed at giving russian or any other minority language the status of a `` regional language '' ; approving its use in courts , schools and other government institutions . 
  the law was [ repealed by ukrainian parliament ] ( http://rada.gov.ua/news/novyny/povidomlennya/88068.html ) on 23 february 2014 . 
  then after the burst of protests turchynov decided to veto it . 
  there is a difference between derussification and desovietisation . 
  when a politician tries to change children names claiming that russian names are [ wrong ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckdeaqwaahm ) , it 's a purely chauvinist act . 
  she also said , that 5 millions non-ukranian speaking people are need to be [ locked in prison ] ( http://www.kp.ru/daily/26198/3085869/ ) . 
  and it 's not a marginal , it 's a popular person , a deputy of ukranian parliament . 
  because a lot of locals do n't recognise revolutionary government that banned russian language and aims derussification . 
  standing against russia will also have bad economical consequences for ukraine . 
  russia had a right to have up to 20 000 troops in crimea . 
  there is no evidence , that they are natives of kharkov . 
  there are a lot of ethnic gropus in russia . 
  this pole in not about ethnic russians exclusively . 
  as for ethnic russians , you can see results from [ autosomal dna ] ( http://oi47.tinypic.com/mbqrex.jpg ) research, 
  the north of kazakhstan was called south siberia before . 
  and like in ukraine all major cities and infrastructure were raised by russian empire and ussr . 
  at the same time kazakhs are nationalistic and mildy opress russians . 
  the amount of russians went from 50 % in 1989 to 24 % now . 
  i 'd say there is a big chance of annexation . 
   why are there russians in ukraine in the first place ? 
  when the russian empire annexed the northern coast of the black sea from the ottoman after the russo-turkish war of 1768-1774 , it established the novorossiysk governorate there , administered from kremenchuk . 
  certain regions of the southern ukraine were sparsely populated and were known as the wild fields or loca deserta ( `` desolated places '' ) in latin on medieval maps . 
  i 'd prefer gorbachev over yeltsin . 
  yeltsin was a disaster . 
  so it 's not official but a tv blooper . 
   less than 1,000 units , actually . 
  you seem to be correct about \u0422-90 . 
  but others are - \u0422-72 and \u0422-80 . 
  so none of that 22,800 units are `` pieces of jun from ww2 '' . 
  and btw in may 2015 a new tank t-14 will be presented at the victory parade . 
  [ dapper laughs ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi4fk2yy-me ) it looks like the influence of american culture is devastating . 
  it is not about anyone specifically . 
  just a joke . 
   `` the death of one man is a tragedy . 
  the death of millions is a statistic . '' ( joseph stalin ) [ it 's not stalin 's quote . 
  ] ( http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/joseph_stalin#misattributed ), 
  no man , it 's not true .
