   1997 russia was happy to sign a treaty honouring ukraine 's borders the treaty that was signed by eltsin - a dysfunctional alcoholic and a big friend of the us . 
   and maybe then we can talk nope . 
  international law says that people have a right to self-determination ( even russians ) . 
  but if you refuse international law , the terms will not be defined by you . 
  your unintelligent chant does n't change facts . 
  south-east of ukraine is a land where russians were the first to build cities and industry . 
  google : wild fields . 
  because ukraine used our moment of weakness ( ussr collapse ) to stole our land , people and industry , and later they led anti-russian policy while stealing our gas and money and destroying what they stole earlier . 
  the outcome of the actions of fanatics and politics is different . 
  politics say a lot of things and do little , while for fanatics it 's the opposite . 
   playing that role as long as it improves his approval ratings . 
  a person that plays is a more sane person , than the one who unconditionally believes . 
   it literally just makes strelkov worse that was the point . 
  there are people that are much worse than putin . 
  overthrowing him gives them all opportunities . 
  putin is an ass , but he 's reasonable . 
  but good luck trying to reach agreement with some pol pot or stalin . 
  do n't be naive and think that it 's an impossible scenario . 
   but the opposition party in russia is the communist party . 
  do n't forget about hardcore and ruthless nationalists like strelkov . 
  the state makes a great effort to prevent them organizing into a party . 
  but in case of instability there would be such organization and the outcome is unpredictable . 
  yay , let 's repeat 20th century , it was so great . 
  sure . 
  that 's because they 're comic book villains without brain and will . 
  but captain america will come and help someday . 
   all have their families and vacations in europe and us like all wealthy people worldwide . 
  [ a lot .

   why does london looks streets ahead of moscow then ? 
  because 20th century was pretty unfortunate for russia . 
   dull and inhospitable city it 's a megalopolis for business , not some south european recreational zone . 
  but there are also a lot of beautiful and interesting places in moscow . 
  sure , you can have any opinion , but it 's better to have a fair and balanced one . 
  well , if a person says that `` there is only dirt in russia '' he 's wrong and as it 's a judgement of a foreigner , he must have based the opinion on something , like websites devoted to negative information about russia . 
  servants of reptilian illuminati , obviously . 
  that 's your indoctrinated mind . 
  there are a lot of nice cities in russia besides moscow and saint pete . 
  for example , [ novosibirsk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt1t1wwut4o ) , [ yekaterinburg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js0a69rieqa ) , [ kazan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvucim6aeee ) - tatarstan ( muh opressed tatars ) , [ samara ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa-avpbhtia ) and so on . 
   but what about rossiysky whatabautism ukranian logic, 
   russians , belarusians , ukrainians , moldovans and probably tatars . 
  we do n't consider them foreigners , though . 
  that 's typical ignorant propaganda of people that judge russia based on stupid photos at the web . 
  immigrants are mostly asians or/and muslims . 
  not for long  , 
  gallup : 82.8 % of crimeans agree that referendum of independence from ukraine represents their views . 
  [ page 28 ] ( http://www.bbg.gov/wp-content/media/2014/06/ukraine-slide-deck.pdf ) . 
   `` the gravity , scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world , '' if it 's that bad , why would people support the regime for so long ? 
  they are doing it to themselves . 
  propaganda workds during wars , revolutions and times of instability , but nk is a stable place . 
  it 's hard to understand . 
  something tells me , you are n't scottish . 
  i understand that nk is a shitty distopian place . 
  but i 'm wondering how exactly is it worse than ussr or yugoslavia . 
  maybe the reason of their bad life is not a comic book maniak under power that kills his girlfriends and ministers with artillery , but real sanctions and isolation that cripple their economy and make them starve . 
   more than 1 % of north korea 's citizens live in labour camps so in prisons . 
  ( like g.u.l.a.g. 
  is an acronym for prison system , not some crazy `` gulag '' place ) . 
  you say 1 % . 
  then , first , what is the source of the number ? 
  and second , the us the number of inmates is 0.73 % . 
  the difference is not that big , actually . 
   has 3 ( ! ), 
  parties and many independent so if we put away south korean propaganda , the north might turn out a much more normal place . 
  the mem looks so innocent it 's almost pro-russian . 
  western propagandists , do you even try ? 
  draw a drunk bear covered with mauled body parts or something . 
  like in case of referendum on scottish independence . 
  ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ a ^ ^ joke ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ defensive . 
  i believe it will happen someday . 
  but we have to do a lot of work before it is possible . 
  btw putin is 62 , he 's got 10-15 years at max as a leader . 
   all of russia should be developed though . 
  only 25 years went after devastating collapse , and it 's hard to develop everything equally , especially places like chechnya , dagestan and other ethnic republics or harsh climate regions . 
   it 's mind boggling how much is achieved despite the spectacularly bad governance . 
  well , maybe our governance was n't that bad in the end . 
  and all problems were caused by wars , rebellions and revolutions we were forced to deal with . 
   reduced to a petro state and arms dealer do n't forget nuclear power and space . 
  and there is much more than this . 
  it 's how history works , dumbo , look at the size of us military spending . 
  you gain resources , then you secure it . 
  your country leads even more aggressive and egoistic foreign policy , not talking about how you gained your land in the first place . 
  but nobody sanctions you , because no one cares about justice and rights . 
  we were stupid to believe the west in the 90s and it wo n't happen again , we 'd better arm china to fuck you up for good . 
  whites will be minority relatively soon , so the decline of pax americana is near . 
  `` russia is a dwarf '' was said by swedish charles xii , before he was rekt . 
  our internet is rather free , so i do n't see much of a difference . 
   like from ukraine ? 
  read about the history of novorossiya , it was called wild fields before russians came , built cities and developed the region . 
   like it paid when you bankrupted yourself in the 80s trying to match the us in technology ? 
  communism was a mistake . 
  it pays now , having all resources and potential . 
  ahead in what fields ? 
  your culture , military , art , population , science , land , language , wealth , resources and etc. 
  all small not influential and underdeveloped . 
  our standard of living maybe a bit lower because we have great goals , like taking and securing maximum land , or be the first in space . 
  but it pays with time . 
  according to international law they can act as they want . 
  free media does n't mean it 's unbiased . 
   it could be at least twice as good , if it was n't run by corrupt oligarchs .
