  it 's run by kgb ( fsb ) . 
  oligarchs have less and less power . 
  in fact they had maximum power in the 90s . 
  when eltsin a big friend of the west and the us was in power . 
   in every possible metric sure . 
  in ** every ** , lol . 
   only 8 % ??? 
  oil export in 2013 was $ 173 bln . 
  it 's 8 % of our gdp ( $ 2113 bln )  are you telling me russia is not run by oligarchs and corruption which is robbing the country blind ? 
   such a shit country . 
  you 're intoxicated with hate and propaganda . 
  new streets of my town are cleaned with mercedes trucks , there are new houses , shops and cars everywhere . 
  policemen are nice and free medicine modernises . 
  life in russia is 100 times better then it was in 90s and it still gets better every year . 
  you just have no idea what are you talking about living in a stupid echo chamber constructed by your media . 
  nice typical butthurtics chant . 
   having a similar starting point . 
  lol , you 've started with one of the most developed parts of ussr and international aid . 
  and we started with soviet debt numerous ethnic conflicts and devastated economy with destroyed integration , logistic , scientific and other important cycles and connections . 
   a development level close to norway yeah sure , when you do n't know how much [ oil barrels per capita ] ( http://en.ruxpert.ru/images/thumb/b/bd/%d0%ad%d0%ba%d1%81%d0%bf%d0%be%d1%80%d1%82_%d0%bd%d0%b5%d1%84%d1%82%d0%b8_%d0%bd%d0%b0_%d0%b4%d1%83%d1%88%d1%83_%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f_%d0%bf%d0%be_%d1%81%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%bc_%d0%bc%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%b0.jpg/365px-%d0%ad%d0%ba%d1%81%d0%bf%d0%be%d1%80%d1%82_%d0%bd%d0%b5%d1%84%d1%82%d0%b8_%d0%bd%d0%b0_%d0%b4%d1%83%d1%88%d1%83_%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f_%d0%bf%d0%be_%d1%81%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%bc_%d0%bc%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%b0.jpg ) we have . 
  oil export is only 8 % of our [ gdp ] ( http://voprosik.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/6001.png ) . 
  do you have actual statistics or just speculate ? 
  btw , latvia has the [ lowest fertility ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2n7aq8xacbu/tas0sdz5e4i/aaaaaaaaalw/ezhn9wigtgc/s1600/birtheurope.gif ) rate in europe . 
   indigenous people were supplanted and continue to be marginalized and shit sounds like it 's said about russians in ukraine . 
  btw , crimean tatar language is recognized as official in current crimean constitution . 
  on the contrary russian language in ukraine does n't have any official status , while half of the country uses it at home . 
   ppp , cool . 
  what 's the point comparing russian and american salaries in nominal , when services , housing , education and medicine cost differs an order of magnitude ? 
  ca n't find more recent info . 
   it seems that your data is wrong ( or old ) . 
  it 's according to [ world bank . 
  ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.pp.cd )  and yet can not reach the gdp per capita of latvia . 
  the answer is [ here ] ( http://www.stop.lv/population-of-latvia.png ) somewhere . 
  actually , it 's harder to develop big structures and organisations than small . 
  and north caucasus is like afghanistan . 
  you can ignore it , but it does n't make justice . 
  and btw there are regions of rf with gdp twice and triple of riga 's gdp per capita . 
  no tears . 
  only dreams now . 
  tell me more about glorious and wealthy european latvia . 
  ( exclude from statistics some depressive regions like north caucasus and the numbers for russia will be even better ) . 
   even our ethnic russians understand that russia is an authoritarian ( human rights ) shithole . 
  the only difference , your country is depopulating depressive shithole everywhere and russia has a lot of places with pretty high level of development . 
  so the majority of people there do n't have a right to determine their fate , because they have wrong ethnicity ? 
  that 's a nice interpretation of international and people rights . 
   no , because that 's not ` your own ' territory . 
  same with novorossiya . 
  it 's not ukrainian , it is the land discovered , developed and populated to this day by russians . 
  yeah , poor international terrorists and genocidal maniaks were squashed by evil russians , oy vey !, 
  it is civil war , because a lot of ukrainians fight in dlnr militia . 
  your head of lugansk oblast said that he wo n't let trade and food trucks to donbass , because they voted at referendum . 
  so your government knows how people there feel about ukraine . 
  but you continue to play this stupid game about `` russian invasion and occupation '' . 
  but history is written by the victors , and it 's not hitler and bandera . 
  yeah , sure , i 'm a bad guy , because abkazians and ossetians want to be independent from georgia . 
  there are 15 soviet republics that were given independence . 
  now most of them are poor and very underdeveloped . 
  some of the pooerst are in asia , so there will be no consequenses in annexing them whatsoever , but there is no such point as annexing more land . 
  if you look at facts , abkhazia and ossetia were given independence , because locals wanted it . 
  the same with crimea and donbass . 
  it 's all according to international law and the principle of self-determination . 
  sure , it does n't correspond western ( us ) interests , but who cares . 
  i 'm saying that the nature of these conflicts is very different . 
  the chechen war started with genocide of russian population and ethnic cleansing . 
  chechen rebels were islamic state fanatics . 
  on the other hand eastern ukrainians are just normal people that were against the violent and illegal coup . 
  western ukrainians took administrative buildings , and eastern made the same damn thing . 
  the only difference the new `` government '' used military aviation against them ( also tried to deny it ) . 
  and from that point an easy way out was impossible . 
  ukraine did n't even denounced the treaty of amity and cooperation with russia . 
  so who 's at war with whom ? 
   why ca n't they bomb their own population ? 
  especially , when it 's subhuman russian people , right ? 
   actions like that were fine when bombing chechnya back to stone age . 
  russia bombed actual terrorists that tried to establish islamic state , not some houses of random old women and kids like in donbass right now . 
  russia also [ restored ] ( http://nesiditsa.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/chechnya_groznyj_b42.jpg ) grozny after the war was over . 
  spending a lot of money to pull chechens from the stone age they were heading due to religious fundamentalism and international terrorism . 
  ukraine and russia both originate from ancient rus . 
  so we have same blood , same history and same religion . 
  people that try to separate us just follow the principle of `` divide and rule '' . 
  also the wild fields . 
  * the somewhat ambiguous location has been usually defined as lying between the don river on the east , kiev on the north , and the left tributaries of the dniester on the west . 
  until the 17th and 18th centuries , the region was only sparsely populated with nomadic nogais and consisted mostly of ** unpopulated steppes ** , so the name of `` wilderness '' came to be applied to it . 
  * wild fields ( or later novorossiya ) was populated and developed by russians . 
  and now that region is being shelled by ukrainian government . 
  we are talking about the land where russians are autochthons . 
  but that concept is hard to understand for the us citizen as long as you stealed your land from genocided american aboriginals . 
  eastern europe especially a part populated by ethnic russians is none of your business . 
  your country should better concentrate on destroyed by your hands middle east . 
   against taking back their own territory should russia take back all soviet territory then ? 
  nah , we do n't really care . 
  we make what we think is right . 
  by the way ukraine continues to shell and kill donbass civilians . 
  and there will be punishment for that . 
  kgb controls the church , so there 's nothing to worry about . 
   hungary , slovakia , bulgaria , even romania still have pro-soviet and pro-putin cliques . 
  which are very far from significant part of society . 
   some of which have openly stated that they put russian interests ahead of their nation 's interests . 
  actually , they put their national interests over the `` western '' ( greeks and hungarians in energy for example ) . 
  not only in dollars , but in quantity and qualty of assets .
