  nuclear warheads , aircraft and aircraft carriers and etc. 
  before becoming russian protectorate , which you asked for ( treaty of georgievsk , also `` forever with russia '' ) you were at constant war with turks and iran . 
   they also hate us . 
  actually not . 
  why would we hate you ? 
  for stalin ? 
   this exercise shows that it clearly is not actually , the reaction over the exercise shows that it is . 
  i understand that . 
  but ppp is the only way to take difference of salaries and costs into consideration . 
  $ 1000 can buy you very different amount of work and production in different countries . 
   gdp smaller than italy 's . 
  russian [ gdp ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.pp.cd/countries/1w?display=default ) according to world bank is bigger than german . 
  $ 3,623 bln vs $ 3,539 bln . 
   he 's crazy enough to pull a crimea on any eu countries the main thing it would n't work . 
  none of european countries have loyal ( to russia ) population . 
  why bringing up the past every time ? 
  at the time of molotov-ribbentrop pact poland invaded and occupied part of czekoslovakia . 
  the problem with hitler not that he invaded countries ( it was adequate to the period of history ) , but that he was a genocidal maniac that thought ( and acted ) like it was normal to eradicate whole nations to nonexistence . 
   wanting to purge us by nuclear fire . 
  never heard of that . 
  your media oversensationalize things . 
   there 's never going go be any neutrality . 
  you can be secured , but neutral , like finland . 
  do n't convert your land into military playground of offencive foreign alliences , that threaten the security of your neighbor . 
  it does n't give you more security , but draws a huge target instead . 
  and btw russia did n't occupy any nation after the dissolution . 
  abkhazia and ossetia are occupied with ethnic abkhazians and ossetians that do want to be independent , just research it . 
  the same with crimea . 
  why would we even need to occupy baltic people if they do n't want it ? 
  what we would do with them . 
  what do we gain except huge problems ? 
  it 's nonsence . 
  the real question - why did n't you live your peaceful neutral lifes after 1991 . 
  but what 's done is done . 
  you get confrontation when you seek it . 
   you do not attack nato . 
  and why is that ? 
  nato have n't defeated anyone . 
  poor sand people from underdeveloped countries does n't count . 
  the us is the only strong part of nato , but they wo n't start nuclear apocalypse over some minor issues . 
  reading comments like yours only convinces me that peacefull dissolution was a stupid move . 
  nobody appreciated it . 
  russians gave you independence , not the hilarious `` human chain '' and you continued to shit on us , instead of feeling the slightest gratitude . 
  the same with our `` brothers '' in ukraine . 
  so do n't be surprised we act the same way as you . 
  it reminds me of cromwell and the difference of his perception in england and ireland . 
  how many schoolbooks were written by nazis ? 
  he is percieved as a controversial figure which he really is . 
  [ 69 % ] ( http://www.levada.ru/31-03-2015/stalin-i-ego-rol-v-istorii-strany ) of russians are against renaming volgograd back to stalingrad , while it was a turning point of the war . 
  46 % ( majority ) think that stalin 's death is the end of terror and mass repressions . 
  only 7 % think that the `` great goals '' of stalin 's era definitely justify victims and suffering . 
  30 % respect him , but only 2 % admires , and only 7 % feels sympathy . 
  it also depends on the age and level of education . 
  more educated and young feel way less sympathetic to stalin . 
  germanics are more angular , slavs have rounder features . 
  a lot of actual little boys were killed by bombs . 
  they were busy shelling cities of donbass . 
  [ - \\ ( mr.poroshenko , \\ ) ] ( https://youtu.be/8djt3zu1nqu ) are you an oligarch ? 
  well , they can change it as well , since canadians are not peasants of british empire . 
  i mean what are the real reasons ( benefits ) to keep foreign monarchy ? 
   but with some time we could 've done something . 
  now we just have to be no ones in middle europe you could have done something in an allience with russia as well . 
  instead of making friends with some crazy destabilizing motherfuckers over the ocean . 
  just saying . 
  why ca n't canada have a referendum ? 
  it 's justified by international law . 
  because comparison is whataboutism , do n't you know ? 
  [ foreign operations appropriations law 101-513 ] ( https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/house-bill/5114 ) is a fact , though . 
  you said nato was only reacting to genocide ( ethnic cleansings ) . 
  but the fact is that the us was involved and promoted the dissolution before the actual balkan wars . 
  '' [ a year before the breakup ] ( http://www.iacenter.org/bosnia/origins.htm ) of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia , on nov. 5 , 1990 , the u.s. congress passed the 1991 foreign operations appropriations law 101-513 . 
  this bill was a signed death warrant . 
  one provision in particular was so lethal that even a cia report described three weeks later in the nov. 27 , 1990 , new york times predicted it would lead to a bloody civil war . '', 
   russia 's war on corruption is over [ ex-penitentiary head arrested on fraud ] ( http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/russia-arrests-ex-prison-chief-in-46-million-corruption-probe-751247 ), 
  should romania be russian or serbian ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  ~ ~ doctors ~ ~ dictators hate them . 
  do n't listen to him . 
   they will rule polissya with a iron fist . 
  very tiny iron fist . 
  it looks like only russians have managed to embrace the inner balkania . 
   spiritual goods it 's a way of society organisation . 
  there is no much spirit value in a mechanism . 
   but back in russia you wish the guys car is repossessed and given to you . 
  it 's an impossible scenario . 
  so it does n't make much sence . 
  new ladas - [ vesta ] ( http://wroom.ru/i/news/2557_lada_vesta.jpg ) and [ xray ] ( http://5gorod.ru/images/news/autonews/vazxr002.jpg ) , do n't look that bad . 
  closer to 99 % , actually . 
  their education system is in russian . 
  culturally , in a context of history , poland is closer to western europe , because catholicism is a major connection factor . 
  and speaking of modern world , european countries are pretty unified . 
  the remaining factor is language . 
  what do you think of the czeck ? 
  they seem pretty western to me . 
  that 's an interesting intersection with [ y-dna map ] ( https://nonpundit.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/y-dna_haplogroups_europe_genetic_map.png ) . 
  so basically you consider western only european people with r1b markers . 
  but it 's even more interesting that both r1a and r1b genes came from russia . 
  `` r1a and r1b are the most common haplogroups in many european populations today , and our results suggest that they spread into europe from the east after 3,000 bce . 
  two hunter-gatherers from russia included in our study belonged to r1a ( karelia ) and r1b ( samara ) , the earliest documented ancient samples of either haplogroup discovered to date . '', 
  no , it should be in the united states .
