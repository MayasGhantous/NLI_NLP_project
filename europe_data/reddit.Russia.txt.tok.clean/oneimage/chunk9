  an true winner of wwii . 
  though everyone who is against ukrainian ultranationalism is a part of suppressed minority . 
  we call it natural selection . 
  only the thickest skulls survive . 
  you must be really stressed and frightened to write stuff like this . 
  well , you need to look from [ perspective ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/russian_economy_since_fall_of_soviet_union.png ) . 
  this is how [ growing economy ] ( http://blogs-images.forbes.com/markadomanis/files/2012/07/russia-g71.png ) looks . 
  also , according to imf , russian gdp ( ppp ) is world 's 6th and is $ 3,491 billions while germany 's is $ 3,512 . 
  so our economy is not so small after all . 
  it 's not land , but what 's left of soviet industry . 
  and also russian people . 
  russian [ gdp ( ppp ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) ) is $ 3,491 billions . 
  world 's 6th economy . 
  germany 's is $ 3,512 . 
  more secure ( how much more ? ), 
  border does n't worth total collapse of economy and the country . 
  it 's not a dick measuring contest . 
   the size which is still growing and far from the limit of growth . 
  british monarchs can be considered `` german '' too . 
  all european monarchs were interconnected . 
  it 's normal . 
   let 's wait and see what the sanctions bring us , ok ? 
  which proves nothing . 
  united germany was inevitable , it is a nation state . 
  the real examples would be yugoslavia and ussr . 
  both brutally dissolated with western involvement . 
   is it not telling that russia is lends large amounts of money to euro-sceptic parties like the national front ? 
  it can be a way to fight american influence . 
  and also putin proposed cooperation between eu and russia from [ `` lisbon to vladivostok '' ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/from-lisbon-to-vladivostok-putin-envisions-a-russia-eu-free-trade-zone-a-731109.html ) . 
  he said it 's the only way to survive and to have influence in modern world . 
  serious question , what 's the point for russia to invade the baltics ? 
  would n't invading a nato country destroy russian economy ? 
  the [ museum of gulag ] ( http://www.gmig.ru/ ) is still working , though . 
  there are a lot of other cultural pieces dedicated to repressed people . 
  the real question is the us interested in strong and united europe ? 
  or , is america interested to have a strong political and economical competitor ? 
  i guess the answer is - the smaller your competetors - the better . 
   that is why they had nothing in common with the people they ruled . 
  some did not even speak russian . 
  those tsars of german descent worked in russian interests , so i do n't see a problem there . 
   i am afraid you overestimate your importance both as a buyer and as a seller , and the effect those roles have in relations between nations . 
  or , that 's you who underestimates . 
   you forget that us troops there were to protect germans against you and were not importing and backing totalitarian system . 
  yeah , like other 700-800 american military bases worldwide . 
  well according to [ stratfor ] ( https://www.stratfor.com/forecast/decade-forecast-2015-2025 ) the eu has a big chance to collapse due to economic problems , and the us is more interested in building its [ own alliance ] ( https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/estonia-azerbaijan-american-strategy-after-ukraine?utm_source=paidlist-a&amp;amp%3butm_medium=email&amp;amp%3butm_campaign=%2a%7cdate%3a%7c%2a&amp;amp%3butm_content=decade%20forecast%3a%202015-2025 ) inside europe instead of eu . 
  stratfor also claims that the us was always against any hegemony in europe . 
  * for a century , the united states has been concerned about the emergence of a hegemon in europe , and in particular of either an accommodation between germany and russia or a conquest of one by the other . 
  that combination , more than any other , might be able to muster a force -- between german capital and technology and russian resources and manpower -- capable of threatening american interests . 
   germany is more culturally and economically ( as well as politically ) aligned with our u.s some of our tsars were german , speaking about culture . 
  also germany is export-oriented ( 50 % of gdp ) and needs natural resources , while russia owns resources and a big market . 
  we 've also moved away our military as an act of peace and goodwill , while the us did n't . 
   it reminds me how terrible the yugoslav wars actually were . 
  like there are some nice wars somewhere . 
   according to this [ 1 ] serbian snipers killed `` minnesota public radio '' . 
  that 's a really reliable source . 
  were the actual snipers caught ? 
  or did they remain unidentified ? 
  more like lady brits, 
  the war on drugs 2.0 : the war on piss . 
  [ according ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_language_in_ukraine ) to the survey , russian is used at home by 43 -- 46 % of the population of the country ( in other words a similar proportion to ukrainian ) and russophones make a majority of the population in eastern and southern regions of ukraine : * autonomous republic of ** crimea ** -- 97 % of the population * dnipropetrovsk oblast -- 72 % * ** donetsk ** oblast -- 93 % * zaporizhia oblast -- 81 % * ** luhansk ** oblast -- 89 % * mykolaiv oblast -- 66 % * odessa oblast -- 85 % * kharkiv oblast -- 74 %, 
  i found an explanation : `` they are not claiming it 's the real banknote . 
  in the full show they are clearly stating that `` some people in social networks are comparing yatsenuk to himmler '' , then they are saying that leader of the svoboda party proposed 1000 hryvna with stepan bandera on it and `` social networks are mocking it '' , this is where they show yatsenuk next to himmler and a `` new '' ( hitler ) banknote . '', 
  and it looks correct accrding to [ the episode ] ( http://russia.tv/video/show/brand_id/58500/episode_id/1163181/video_id/1121857/viewtype/picture ) . 
  so much room for activities, 
   only in 2014 did the alienation start . 
  it started in 1991 or even in 1917 . 
  it 's not new currency design according to that channel , but a design proposed by a nationalist party . 
  i do n't know if it makes a difference , though . 
  the [ real story ] ( http://www.dialog.ua/news/35070_1420320156 ) is that a leader of far-right svoboda party proposed to make a new 1000 hryvnia note with a portret of s.bandera . 
  swap horses for people and tractors for [ robots ] ( http://review.ehl.lu.se/assets/replacement_horse_tractors.jpg ), 
  it is though . 
   russians still ca n't forgive poland taking over moscow in 1610 . 
  nah , it 's kinda cool . 
  kosovo for everyone . 
  bring muslims . 
  muslims become a majority . 
  separate ancestral land into a hostile republic . 
  it 's corruption . 
  one has too much and the other has too little , so it 's all good . 
  and also [ this ] ( http://s00.yaplakal.com/pics/pics_original/0/4/9/6459940.png ), 
   chopinowicz sounds ukrainian-jewish . 
  does n't matter , can drink . 
  poland = fieldlands, 
  czechoslovakia has a nice ring to it . . hehehe, 
  \u0447\u0435\u0448\u043a\u0430 / ceska - is also a [ dance footwear ] ( http://www.ru.all.biz/img/ru/catalog/1681495.jpeg ) in russian . 
  it fact . 
  the greeks gave us the first alphabet to transcribe old church slavonic . 
  aaaargggghhh !!!, 
   ukraine can into eu . 
  is it a mem yet ? 
  there is nothing new in poland trying to take over ukraine . 
  historically speaking . 
   just take over completely . 
  if only [ karl xii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivan_mazepa#change_of_sides ) was alive , right ? 
  it did n't work well last time , though . 
  the american version is : `` get out of the kitchen . '', 
  ftfy, 
  he is in siberia camp now , for homogayism . 
   you ca n't go invade crimea yes we can, 
  i had a conversation ( in russian ) about soviet occupation of poland , and i 've got only few dislikes .
