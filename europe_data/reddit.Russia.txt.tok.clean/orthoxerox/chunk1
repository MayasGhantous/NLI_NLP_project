yeah , we had to remind them twice they were n't poland . 
  chuvash people ? 
  that was a lo-o-o-ong time ago , though . 
  are you one of those germans that managed to stay in hungary after wwii ? 
  maybe it was wrong for ukrainians to topple yanukovich then ? 
   oh , no , if you leave your abusive husband who 'll take care of you ? 
  who knows where you 'll end up and who you 'll end up with ? 
  you have terrible taste in men , so you should n't leave that one . 
  nil ushakov is \u043b\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435\u0446 but not \u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0448 according to my understanding of the word , just like sergey shoigu is \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0438\u043d , but he 's not \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 . 
  i am ** for ** an explicit military intervention . 
  our covert participation is bleeding both countries dry . 
  an all-out war will result either in ukraine 's surrender , so putin can negotiate what he wants and finish the conflict , or in a revolution and putin 's demise , so we can blame everything on him and make peace . 
  because belarus has chosen to remain socialist . 
  maybe your houses are not suitable ? 
  they 're good for venting heat , not for storing heat . 
  what do they say of the acropolis , where the parthenon is ? 
  traffic jams . 
  ukraine . 
  the only difference is that we think they 're better homeowners . 
  yep , my first reaction was `` ukraine 's too pale '' . 
  it does n't even mean that we 're from the caucasus . 
  german anthropologist johann friedrich blumenbach thought that the skull of one woman from the caucasus was the most perfectly proportioned skull of a white person , hence the name . 
  no flair . 
  the netherlands ? 
  the best-known russian ( or ex-soviet ) tv show is [ what ? 
  where ? 
  when ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/what%3f_where%3f_when%3f ) a team of six erudites has to answer questions sent by viewers beforehand . 
  each round one of the 13 sectors on the game table is chosen by a spinning top , and in 12 of them there 's a letter with a question and a cash prize . 
  the team has one minute to come up with an answer , once per game they can ask for another minute , or they can skip the discussion and get another extra minute if the answer is right . 
  if the answer is wrong , the viewer gets the cash prize and the `` viewers ' team '' gets a point . 
  if the answer is correct , the erudites ' team gets both . 
  the game ends when one of the teams gets 6 points . 
  back when the author and original host of the show was still alive , sector 13 meant a question from him . 
  now his adopted son hosts the game incognito , and sector 13 means a question submitted on the game 's website . 
  all the questions featured in the game do not generally require trivial knowledge , but can be answered with some logic and lateral thinking , although trivial knowledge also helps . 
  finally , this game is why no one in russia associates * also sprach zaratustra * with cavemen and monoliths . 
  that 's because buildings like yours are much harder to draw in archicad , while that new tallinn station is like ten polytopes , and modern architects are lazy . 
  to me great architecture does n't mean it has to make you go `` woah , take a look at that !, 
  '' , it means the building looks like it has always been there and you can not imagine anything else occupying this place . 
  it looks worse than balti jaam . 
  and 50 years down the road you wo n't be able to blame us for building it . 
  i think it was plato who said that . 
  what 's the deal with protestant eastern hungary ? 
  i like this list . 
  gay marriage might be a problem , might have to wait for the free press to destigmatize the concept . 
  what 's a bakfiets ? 
  rogozin is one of the liberals ? 
  that 's a very ... liberal interpretation of the term . 
  they would need to invade tunisia first . 
  the `` cyborgs '' are veteran soldiers , not simple volunteers powered by patriotism . 
  that 's why they 're still alive . 
  the same applies to those trying to retake the airport . 
  `` motorola '' , for example , is a former marine . 
  one theater here has bean bag chairs for two in the last row for making out . 
  maybe your movie theaters are too small ? 
  yours 's not a big country , is it ? 
   we actually have differentiated pricing in some theaters where the middle of the middle rows is more expensive , like there : http://www.5zvezd.ru/cinemas/paveletskaya/#halls, 
  i 'll restrict my choice to those buildings i have actually seen with my own eyes , so a lot of worthy candidates are out , like alhambra and that brick church in vilnius . 
  inside russia , i was going to say moscow military district hq , but there 's been a glitch in the matrix and it 's a completely different building now . 
  i ca n't find the original building on the map any more . 
  outside russia , it 's probably [ battersea power station ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/battersea_power_station ) , although canterbury cathedral is also great . 
  i 've never ever heard about that castle , thank you for posting this . 
  you 're preaching to the choir ... though i 'll disagree with you regarding social ladders . 
  both my and my wife 's grandparents could n't have achieved now what they have achieved back then . 
  no one with half a conscience says they were ascetics . 
  but compared to modern nomenclature they had more restrained appetites . 
  that 's 35 million dollars in today 's money . 
  not bad . 
  do we know how he obtained that amount ? 
  a sports personality : [ nikolay valuev ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikolai_valuev ) . 
  an actor : [ nikolay valuev ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikolai_valuev ) . 
  a politician : [ nikolay valuev ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikolai_valuev ) . 
  at least he 's not a scientist . 
  yet ? 
  why ? 
  because they do n't agree on the amount of evil things he did ? 
  well , you could n't get multi-million kickbacks back then and even if you could , you could n't really spend them on a miami apartment or a fur coat vault . 
  it 's conspicuous consumption by the elite that is corruption to most russians , not the use of your private connections to obtain furniture , delicatessen or dental care . 
  please also note that unless you 're over 60 , you have never experienced life under stalin , so it 's likely none of us are qualified to discuss the level of corruption under stalin . 
  it sure looked like i was the only one who did . 
  if they emigrated to the us they 're not crazy in my book . 
  is there any semantic difference , like in hungarian with its piros and voros ? 
  the culture . 
  they have invented our alphabet and have greatly influenced our language . 
  it 's also a pity bulgaria had to give that bit of aegean coast back . 
  that guy is hilarious . 
  when some russians started insulting him over the internet , calling him a faggot , he released a homoerotic russian-themed music video to troll them . 
  i 've been to eur . 
  looks like the worst bits of moscow . 
  what 's the difference between * ak * and * beyaz * ? 
  we had to import some italians to have them build the kremlin . 
  oh , right . 
  plastic window frames and an acrylic bathtub insert . 
  unfortunately , our politicians are better known for saying stupid things than saying witty things . 
  the most famous insult is probably putin 's `` you should come visit our caucasus , they 'll circumcise you so hard you 'll have nothing left '' to a journalist . 
  it depends on the weather . 
  pentecostals ~ ~ or old believers ~ ~ ? 
  champagne for the first toasts , then it 's wine for the ladies and vodka for the lads . 
  i guess the first link suggests to buy all three kinds of alcohol , while the other is for a village wedding .
