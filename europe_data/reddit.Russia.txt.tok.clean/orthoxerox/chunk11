  i hope bosnian islam is laid back enough to forgive apostasy . 
  andalucia ( with fields full of grain ) . 
  sevilla with its cathedral , alcazar and archive of the americas , granada with its alhambra , cordoba with its mosque/cathedral are magnificent . 
  there 's also ronda ( a white town on a canyon ) , jeres de la frontera ( the birthplace of jeres , obviously ) and malaga to get drunk , pass out and get a sunburn on the beach . 
  and in russian too !, 
   seven men who stole copper from live electricity lines have been jailed your boffins should study them to determine where their luck comes from . 
  i wonder if they regret not getting their darwin award . 
  part of the blahblah included the plans to prevent companies with offshore beneficiaries from bidding for government contracts . 
  i can already see how totaly russian shell companies win government contracts and then subcontract totally cypriot companies . 
  if this measue is implemented at all . 
  it 's not like vvp did n't tell the parliament to fight offshores back in 2012 . 
   doctor assulted by female patients family , after the family found out that the doctor was male . 
  let me guess the family 's religion ... 
  why not call it mashed paper ? 
  a-ha , i get it now . 
  there 's actually a dog breed that 's called khortaya in russian . 
  probably the same root . 
  chrt is a greyhound ? 
  i 'd have thought it was either something related to drawing or the devil . 
  and ours has been immensely influenced by one poet 200 years ago . 
  reading pushkin 's correspondence i am always amazed by how modern his language feels , unlike shakespeare 's . 
  why would poles destroy the statue of a pole who killed more russians than pilsudski ? 
  just kidding . 
  this one is funny , but hard to translate because of the puns . 
  khruschev is visiting a primary school and a little girl says , `` comrade khruschev , my daddy always says you 've not only sent a man into space , but also our economy into a spin . '', 
  khruschev replies , `` sweetie , go tell your dad that introducing maize into the crop rotation is not the only way for him to spend ten years of his life . '', 
  ( the original joke uses russian puns `` to launch = to neglect '' and `` to plant = to imprison '' ), 
  guess what , so do we . 
  except the russian is always the star/butt of the joke , of course . 
   when the tsar wanted a new palace , he asked his chancellor to choose the best architect . 
  first came the german and said he could build one for 3 million roubles : 1 mil for the blueprints , 1 mil for the materials , 1 mil for the builders . 
  the came the frenchman and said he could build one for six million roubles : two for the design , two for the glamour , two for the \u00e9lan . 
  finally the russian architect came and said he could build one for nine million roubles and his offer was the best out of three . 
  the chancellor asked him to explain how that could be possible . 
  the russian replied : `` three for you , three for me , and three to subcontract the german . '', 
  we have the same jokes in russia as our baltic neighbors about estonia . 
  two estonians wake up after drinking all night and one of them who 's feeling worse says , `` toomas , here 's some money , please go buy me a can of sprite . '', 
  toomas leaves and returns in the afternoon , `` urmas , i could n't find sprite anywhere so i 've bought you some cookies . '', 
  and the most overused joke ever : an estonian is walking down a railroad track and sees another one riding a handcar . 
  he waves to him and asks , `` is it a long way to tallinn ? '', 
  the other estonian says , `` no , not really , '' so the first one jumps onto the handcar and starts helping him pump the lever . 
  after three hours pass he asks again , `` is it a long way to tallinn now ? '', 
  and the other estonian answers , `` yes , now it is quite far away . '', 
  12-erhorn mountain nearby is a great hiking opportunity . 
  it 's a huge pine-covered island that is also a national park . 
  the air there is simply intoxicating . 
  they do n't have to wear them , you know , it 's just to highlight that they 're still schoolgils . 
  not that anyone complains ... , 
  it says `` ingredients : pasteurized cream '' . 
  what else can butter consist of ? 
  it symbolizes salo . 
  why it 's a flag of belarus is a mystery , though . 
  has he come back from a united russia training camp ? 
  what 's next , adding anglicanism to the school curriculum or banning gay propaganda among minors ? 
  everyone will think we are related based on our usernames . 
  free labour market , if you 're talking about me as a person . 
  if you 're talking about me as russia , then a moderating influence and also relevance . 
  does your fyi remark mean that if su settled 10m russians in latvia and estonia they should not have become independent ? 
  i miss svalija milk ... :(, 
  as a russian , i would n't mind that at all . 
  i do n't think they means peas when they said `` peas '' . 
  accents and all that stuff . 
  \u0427\u0443\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0446\u044b ( chukhonets ) or more dismissively \u0447\u0443\u0445\u043d\u0430 , but that 's what you and other finno-ugrics around novgorod were called back in the days of the tsars . 
  after polandball , i can not recognize your flag anymore . 
  all right , let 's see what we can call our brothers slavs ... you are \u043f\u0448\u0435\u043a\u0438 ( pszek ) , reflecting your love of unnecessary fricatives . 
  ukrainians are \u0445\u043e\u0445\u043b\u044b ( khkhol , cowlick ) , because cossacks liked to leave a single lock of hair on their heads . 
  belorussians are \u0431\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0431\u0430\u0448\u0438 ( bulbash , tuber-eaters ) , because they 're russia 's ireland and their national cuisine is said to be 100 % potato . 
  i do n't think there are slurs for other slavs , so let 's see what other peoples are worthy of our attention . 
  i think it 's obvious who frog-eaters , macaroni-eaters and fascists are . 
  jews are \u0436\u0438\u0434\u044b ( zhid , yid ) , but i think it 's not a slur in polish . 
  `` remove kebab from the premises ! '', 
  i think the reason might be their small size . 
  there are what , 1300k latvians left in latvia , and more and more young people are emigrating . 
  let other people in , and they soon will become a minority in their own country . 
  they are basically european israels . 
  for example , americans are called \u043f\u0438\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0441\u044b ( pindos ) for no particular reason . 
  central asians are called \u0447\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0438 or \u0447\u0443\u0440\u0431\u0430\u043d\u044b ( churka , churban ) , which are terms for unsplit firewood pieces and for dumb people . 
  transcaucasians are called \u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0436\u043e\u043f\u044b\u0435 ( chernozhopy , black-assed ) or \u0445\u0430\u0447\u0438 ( khach , from armenian name khachatur ) . 
  ciscaucasians are called \u0437\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044c\u043a\u0438 ( zveryok , small animals ) . 
  chechens specifically are sometimes called czechs . 
  chinese can be called \u043f\u0438\u0437\u0434\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0435 ( pizdoglazy , cunt-eyed ) . 
  well , it 's not like the germans did n't work hard to get roma population to 0.15 % ... 
  in russia we used to do that to children on palm/willow sunday . 
  you are right , the great vowel shift is responsible for most of the changes . 
  but they 're still stuck with words like facade . 
  i do n't think it is stupid . 
  that 's how english ended up with its atrocious spelling rules , by picking up loanwords without modifying either spelling or pronunciation . 
  and german does it with english loanwords as well , like baby or job or punk or jeans . 
  why not baeybi or dschob ? 
  when there 's an alphabet gap , there 's no problem at all , you spell the word according to its pronunciation , but even when there 's no gap , i think you should do the same . 
  i 'm not so sure about using traditional rules that exist specifically for names , like adding '' - ova '' in czech or '' - ene '' in lithuanian , or maybe replacing your name with a local equivalent . 
  no one would call edward snowden \u042d\u0434\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0434 \u041b\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0421\u043d\u043e\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432 if he decides to obtain russian citizenship . 
  he can even avoid making lonnievich his patronymic . 
  but no one will spell his name \u042d\u0434w\u0430\u0440\u0434 just because there 's no w in russian . 
  as some snarkers say , since they 're not humping people to death , but are biting them to death , why would anyone think sterilization is even an option ? 
  crimean war , the great game , helping the whites ... 
  one of them were supposed to be your rebellious colonies across the pond . 
  you know , unlike some people in / r/politota i ca n't bring myself to jeer and laugh at his expense , `` serves you right , putin 's ork '' . 
  for one thing , it shows that we are capable of building a multinational and multifaith nation , where buryats feel themselves at home and are willing to fight for their country , even though the cause was in this case not really worth fighting for . 
  it also shows how badly we fucked up with ukrainians , who are culturally much closer to us .
