  she 's responsible for a huge msu expansion project . 
  the big mike is pointed at her and she 's not looking at the camera , looks like she 's being interviewed , and is not a journalist herself . 
  i doubt an average person knows who she is . 
  only those who actively follow the conflict and go beyond the mainstream sources are likely to learn about her . 
  she 's not even a journalist . 
  he does n't have enough daughters to replace them all . 
  must n't grumble ? 
  especially if they get to destroy the evidence . 
  good luck getting to it , though . 
  are the fires bad enough that the sun looks like an ember ? 
  2010 was a fun year here in moscow . 
  it wo n't increase the number of tourists , but it 's a symbolic gesture meant to equalize our mutual visa requirements . 
  what 's wrong with crocodilo ? 
  \u041a\u043e ** \u043d\u0442\u0440\u0432\u0437\u0431\u0437\u0434\u043d ** \u0443\u0442\u044c , a made up , but absolutely legitimate word with nine consonants in a row . 
  `` to counter someone 's sudden fart with one of your own '' . 
  literally translated as `` yes no , probably '' , it is a common expression actually meaning `` i guess no '' . 
  the closest we can get to the craziness that is po\u0142iszrzcz . 
  a hare with a braid mowed with a crooked scythe beyond the spit . 
  is a small sex story without any consonants . 
  darude ? 
  i love them as well , but they are reportedly hard for wheelchair users to use . 
  i had buckwheat porridge last week , except i had it with chili con carne . 
  shchi two weeks ago . 
  how do they tell that the lobster is a virgin ? 
  21 megaroubles for this abomination ? 
  and they tell us the regions are poor . 
  ... on ice !, 
  is bip a typo ( bih ) or an acronym i do n't know ? 
  how do you make semolina mousse ? 
  electing different people is the first step towards proper government . 
  they usually grow more corrupt and fascist when in power , so it 's a good idea to replace them often . 
  erm , she 's from kiev and is ukrainian/arab . 
  top gear . 
  is n't chuvash the only remaining oghur language ? 
  you forgot about `` lithuania stole our rightful name '' . 
  \u0411\u043b\u044f is only used as an interjection , you ca n't use it as a noun , though . 
  the only exception is '' \u0431\u043b\u044f \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443 '' , which is an oath . 
  or as a generic filler when you are n't the most eloquent person . 
  nope , they 're different . 
  '' \u0421\u0443\u043a\u0430 '' means `` bitch '' , and shows your displeasure with your vis-a-vis . 
  '' \u0411\u043b\u044f '' means `` whore '' , but is used here as a generic intensifier . 
  you can say '' \u0414\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0439 , \u0431\u043b\u044f '' to tell someone to make up their mind or hurry up , but you are not calling them a whore . 
  if used as punctuation , then it 's \u0431\u043b\u044f\u0434\u044c / \u0431\u043b\u044f / blyad/blya ( whore ) , \u043d\u0430 \u0445\u0443\u0439 / na khuy ( [ go ] on a dick ) , and \u0451\u0431 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u044e / yob tvoyu ( [ i ] fucked your [ mother ] ) . 
  yes , it 's not a universal feature , and it 's more common among rural tatars , but their eye shape is a bit different . 
  kvas and ... russian salad ( olivier ) , i guess ? 
  or shchi . 
  or kholodets . 
  or a simple good homemade kotleta , with no stupid breadcrumbs , but lots of bread minced in , eaten hot or cold . 
  damn , now i 'm hungry . 
  the major differences are their names and their slight squint . 
  tatars already numbered less than 50 % back in 1926 , russians have been settling in tatarstan since the times of ivan iv , that is , since it became russia . 
  ah , it 's a single big book in russian , and i recommend all of it . 
  if you mean * virgin soil upturned * , do n't bother . 
  just to make things clear for the others , lem is a big name in russia , but he 's a polish writer . 
  the tree it crashed into had been planted by nkvd back in the 30 's . 
  yes , afair delta makes a `` voiced dental fricative '' sound , nu + tau is used for `` voiced alveolar stop '' . 
  everyone knows about slow estonia . 
  they followed the letter of the law . 
  someone committed a list of ridiculous ways to kill yourself to their repo , so they had to ban it . 
  github serves every page via tls , so it 's impossible to ban a single page . 
  th as in `` this '' . 
  nope , no whoosh , his sarcastic denial of the difference was an example of what i had written about .

  [ the dulles ' plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dulles%27_plan ) - the usa defeated the ussr with a more appealing , subversive mass culture . 
  that the usa are still out to get us , supporting regime changes in xussr countries , dreaming of non-nuclear russia with everything in it owned by multinationals and completely unable to support itself without trade . 
  that this has already happened and putin is an american puppet putting on a good show to ease russians into their new subservient role . 
  it 's kinda complicated . 
  farming regulations are tight , so people are growing livestock `` for private consumption '' instead of registering as farmers . 
  they tried to prevent that by limiting grazing land you can have , but totally-not-farmers then switched to factory farming . 
  of course , the real solution is deregulation combined with the radical reform of the controlling organisation , but this is impossible with our current leadership . 
  yes , that 's exactly what i 'm talking about . 
  our handwriting does look like that , it 's the serbs who had to come up with weirdass handwriting , but i was talking about print .

  the whole society is worse off because we allowed stupidity to proliferate . 
  the soviet union . 
  should 've agreed to build that fertilizer mine , would 've at least had something important . 
  you even have your own style of typefaces , more similar to the latin script : * n vs \u043f * u vs \u0438 * g vs \u0434 * etc. 
  well , we do not honor them , and a marble headstone commemorating some of them not far from my flat was shattered by an unexpectedly strong gust of wind one night . 
  are you sure that was easter and not palm sunday ? 
  we supposedly have this tradition as well , as the quote above shows . 
  the usa have always been light brown on our maps . 
  these sound like cheesy pickup lines when written in english . 
  our flag is relatively new , having appeared either during peter 's or his father alexey 's reign , 300-350 years ago . 
  the most popular theory is that peter had a big hardon for all things dutch and when he decided his ships needed an ensign , he used dutch colours . 
  however , i seem to remember that the dutch flag actually had an orange stripe where the red one now is back in the early 1700 's . 
  another theory is that the original flag was a blue cross with white and red cantons , and our current flag is literally a snippet of the old one . 
  i need to dig for some sources to find out more . 
  back in 1991-1993 the flag was a bit different , the proportions were 2:1 instead of 3:2 and the colors were white , azure and scarlet . 
  you 're lucky the swiss do n't have a capital . 
  bern 's located higher than sofia . 
  i actually have some orthophosphoric acid for removal . 
  ketchup is an abomination , there are much better tomato-based sauces . 
  mayo is the putin of sauces in russia , you ca n't get away from it and most people love it . 
  i prefer something like tartar sauce or that thing you put in the caesar salad on my fast food fries . 
  cola is better for that . 
   they we, 
  they 're talking about the reaction to the coup . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  that junction does n't look that complex . 
  not everywhere , i still see armenians and azeris sending each other * na khuy * on internet forums over eurovison and karabakh .
