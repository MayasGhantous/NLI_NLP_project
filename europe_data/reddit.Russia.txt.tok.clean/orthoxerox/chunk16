  ** russia : ** democratic coalition ( a coalition of several liberal parties not represented in the duma ) was barred from all local parliamentary elections because their collected signatures were found unsatisfactory by the election committees ; the reasons given were ridiculous . 
  parliamentary parties do n't have to collect signatures . 
  [ partial source ( en ) ] ( https://meduza.io/en/news/2015/08/07/yet-another-region-is-poised-to-keep-russia-s-democratic-coalition-off-the-ballot-this-year ), 
  you know , i 've been rewatching monty python 's the meaning of life , and the sex ed sketch there struck me as a pretty reasonable lesson , live demonstration and good old english humiliation of pupils aside . 
  i 've read several sex ed books as a pre-teen/early teen and not a single one of them actually said what sex in its most trivial form is . 
  there were lots of concepts revolving around sexual activity described in great detail there , but not a single `` basically , an erect penis enters a lubricated vagina and moves in an out in a good rhythm until one or preferably both partners experience an orgasm , which coincides with ejaculation in males '' . 
  and now we can start talking about romantic attraction , the consequences of sex , the importance of consent and contraception , other ways to have sex etc. 
  you 're still worst slavs for not using the right word . 
  i know the germans have wicker barriers , because the north and baltic seas are not the most sunniest and warmest places . 
  we do n't have them at our black sea resorts , because space is very scarce there and the weather is somewhat better . 
  and us as well . 
  i wonder if they have a regular typewriter shuffling process set up as well , since each typewriter has unique `` handwriting '' . 
  was there ever an cartoon adaptation of muff , halfboot and mossbeard ? 
  that 's the only estonian book for children i know of . 
  a rug is dywan in polish ? 
  what do you call a sofa , then ? 
  i hope it counts that my firstborn is quarter-ukrainian . 
  ** moscow : ** rich , lazy , rude , arrogant , always in a hurry , out of touch with real life . 
  ** st. pete : ** snobbish intelligentsia , think themselves the most cultured people , still butthurt about not being the capital any more . 
  ** the rest of the country : ** / r/anormaldayinrussia, 
  that 's not because people liked their antirelugious stance . 
  first of all , cprf is pro-orthodox , weirdly enough , and second , their gains can be attributed to the `` fuck united russia , vote for literally anyone else '' general mood and campaign . 
  both them and fair russia took part in the 2011 post-electoral protests at first ( had a reelection happened , they could 've had a parliamentary majority between them ) , but quickly melted away . 
  he may not , but he can and it looks like he does . 
  like bjs ? 
  \u0413 was once written as < , that 's how it could have become c. 
  condom , x-ray machine and other assorted medical equipment protectionism . 
  actually , there 's no condom ban . 
  government procurement offices will have to reject bids from foreign suppliers of medical goods as long as at least two valid bids from russian suppliers have been received . 
   until the current system starts collapsing on its own that 's the worst kind of instability . 
  well , i did n't say ban them outright . 
  but having their products bear a marker `` sponsored by the government of x '' or restricting the list of allowed activities would be quite sensible . 
  despite being a liberal-minded russian , i would still restrict the activities of those organisations that are ultimately funded from other states ' national budgets , like ned and rferl . 
  as if liberal values are something bad . 
  clean air , clean water , reasonable-ish prices , enough job opportunities . 
  berlin and turin are runner-ups . 
  london is great , but insanely expensive . 
  something we share with scandinavians and americans . 
  i 've spent all of my short-term savings on dacha renovation , and getting them back up is harder now with prices getting higher and higher . 
  i am proud of russian writers , artists and composers , proud of russian explorers who have left us with all this land and people who settled there , proud of people who knew they would die , who knew they had no other option and who died fighting bravely , proud of old believers who did n't abandon their faith even when confronted by all the power of the state . 
  i am not proud of what my country has become lately . 
  well , there 's a difference between being proud of lithuania and being proud of being lithuanian . 
  you can be proud of your grandpa the wartime hero , even though you had nothing to do with his achievements . 
  and sauna . 
  [ choose yourself ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dnr ), 
  android jelly bean , i think . 
  i do n't see anything . 
  have my fonts been censored already ? 
  rostov-on-don is unsure about being `` respectable freedom fighters '' . 
  are dnr fighters trying to get some r&r respectable now ? 
  oh , yes , every time i find a chinese city i 've literally never heard of before on wikipedia , it turns out to be a multi-million megapolis . 
   but mu-u-um , she has a moustache !, 
  or the other way around : `` we will destroy you like mh17 '' during a ru-nl game . 
  2 sq m of land , more likely . 
  no one to prosecute - no need to prosecute . 
  they 're always responsible , duh . 
  i wonder who his dentist is . 
  about the same , we have it on the presidential standard , but not on the flag . 
  nice , we 'll finally be able to use our fleets , no longer locked in the black sea and the gulf of finland . 
  the famous retarded lion of finland is also there . 
  it 's so red i want to put golden hammer and sickle in the top left corner ... 
  i bet she hires a tractor to plow the land in spring at the very least . 
  you ca n't till 1ha by hand . 
  it will take me one day to dig up maybe 1 are . 
  a honda costs 1.5 times as much as a comparable ford here . 
  am i really the only one who picked moldova ? 
   banderas oh , yes , the famous spanish-ukrainian who fought on the side of franco in the civil war . 
  because thracia and the better half of istanbul are in europe . 
  now that 's a badass name , sigmar !, 
  has he ever been observed praising hitler , or are you just trolling ? 
  people are afraid of buying pills of inferior quality or even duds if they buy them in russia . 
  if you want to travel across the sea with a sextant , a clock and a compass . 
  i expected him to give no more than three fiddy . 
  these three have the best publicity . 
   curd snack/var \u0161k\u0117s s\u016brelis very common here in russia . 
  there 's no mould in munster , but there 's some * on * it . 
  we call this pork cheese of your `` zelts '' here in russia . 
  i do n't like smear-ripened soft cheeses , unfortunately . 
  i am afraid of mould . 
  is its name related to the noses it offends ? 
  it 's armenian . 
  `` to get away with '' . 
  that 's why i asked you cheese-eating frenchmen to talk about region-specific cheeses . 
  wow , that 's a lot . 
  i do n't know , i see lots of serbian produce on the shelves . 
  frozen berries , white cheese , fruit & veg . 
  where does the milk come from ? 
  the netherlands are about the size of moscow + moscow oblast , is there enough space for pastures ? 
  russia does n't really have any famous cheeses . 
  there are two main cheese-making regions : upper volga and altay mountains . 
  both are geared toward industrial cheese making , so local brands like russian , soviet , altay , kostroma and sheksna do not have remarkable taste or texture . 
  there 's also adyghe/circassian cheese from the caucasus , but it 's mild as well , despite beong a brined cheese . 
  you have to watch kin-dza-dza at least twice to find it funny . 
  the first time everyone i know found it very confusing and sad . 
  ** mikhail sholokhov - quiet flows the don ** . 
  an epic tale of don cossacks set during wwi and rcw . 
  stories of gulag seen from the inside ; he 's a much better writer than the * other guy * . 
  ** sergei dovlatov - the compromise ** . 
  like shalamov , he preferred short stories to novels . 
  i had to pick one of the collections , but you should read all of them .
