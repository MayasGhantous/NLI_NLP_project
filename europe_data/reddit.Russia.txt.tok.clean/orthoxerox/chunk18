  yeah , fat chance , i know . 
  the biggest surprise on the list . 
  we 'd just pick one and start paying them to rule mexico and prevent any spillover of drugs or migrants into russia . 
  i would n't mind that , we would get a country with better climate and just as many mineral resources . 
  and we could invade mexico . 
  if ua say they are at war with ru , ru will say it 's a declaration of war and will force ua to sue for peace . 
  singapore ? 
  yes , it can be sour or rancid . 
  it 's not bad , it 's butter ; there are fewer ways to make bad butter than bad cheese . 
  i have a/c at home and in the office , but the weather has been underwhelming so far , daytime temperatures hovering around 20 . 
  lovely fresh air and moscow are incompatible . 
  no , what is the # 1 cause of death in serbia , \u0107evap\u010di\u0107i ? 
  why were n't you wearing a cap ? 
  yes . 
  i actually got a crick in my neck after riding a bus next to an open window . 
  i am not sure what to believe in now . 
  air movement in a room from an open window . 
  draught in british english . 
  after ... ? 
  there was a story back when obama fought against tax cuts written by an upper middle class american making $ 400k who claimed he lived hand to mouth . 
  edit : found it . 
  and it 's marginally better than vomit , both russian and uruguayan . 
  yes !, 
  no big changes since the last thread . 
  food 's still more expensive , local cheese still sucks . 
  i could n't buy a sofa i wanted because the factory no longer had any upholstering fabric in stock and all their suppliers went out of business . 
  the network 's reaction is not unusual , what 's been completely unexpected was the original u-turn statement :  in april 2012 , kiselyov infamously said on live television that gays should be prohibited from donating `` blood , sperm , and other vital organs . '' in the event that a homosexual person dies in a car accident , he even advocated `` burying or burning '' their heart , `` as it is unfit for extending anyone 's life , '' suggesting that sexually transmitted diseases in the gay community pose too great a risk . 
   on his tv show this week , kiselyov told viewers , `` we can manage to make life easier for adults who want -- both informally and formally -- the responsibility of taking care of each other . 
  in the end , love works wonders , and who 's against that ? '' kiselyov also stated plainly , `` the lgbt community is a fact . '', 
  a strange choice for russia . 
  is * 17 moments of spring * really that well known abroad ? 
  i would 've expected someone like sean connery 's submarine captain or ivan drago . 
  or black widow . 
  and georgia got saddled with a ukrainian , probably a soviet officer 's daughter . 
  well , the movie started out as the snow queen in preproduction before evolving into frozen . 
  you did n't * go * to war the second time , just declared it . 
  those taxi drivers who sold their licenses are n't taxi drivers no more . 
  i doubt current ones preferred to shell out 300k instead of getting one for free . 
  there 's a difference . 
  when state-owned taxi companies went tits up in the early 90 's , the market organized itself around a very uber-like model , though it took it at least 10 years to do so . 
  i agree that the french model is unsustainable , but uber 's `` tough luck , cabmen '' approach is deplorable . 
  you ca n't just fuck the taxi drivers over , since it were n't them who came up with current rules . 
  the authorities should find a compromise despite both parties demanding opposite extreme solutions . 
  maybe all italians look gay to you , like all europeans look good to americans ? 
  if only . 
  you think that 's bad ? 
  russia is a segment within news from ukraine on every fucking channel here . 
   a teacher in primary school made erotic photos and videos of his naked wife ( also teacher ) inside school building ( after the classes , w/o any public ) and published them on some amateur site . 
  he got fired . 
  this was six years ago , now he was named as new director in this school . 
  is his wife still working there ? 
  if yes , how was he allowed to become his wife 's boss ? 
  she 's not so nice , i have n't seen her give anyone a warm smile , ever . 
  awww . 
  they even bent the bars to get him out . 
  here they would 've chopped the little guy in half with a shovel to get him out . 
  we could lease a port from them instead of syria . 
  the poor have no savings , the middle class will be royally fucked . 
  not volga tatars , though . 
  chuvashs are more likely to have descended from bulgars . 
  do n't tell me dutch and germans are n't related . 
  well , not completely , more like dutch and pennsylvania dutch . 
  karst is in stone that is water-soluble , like limestone , so you get holes or whole caves filled with water . 
  porous is porous , sand or similar layers . 
  well , it 's not that simple . 
  in latvian the king of pop is `` maikls d\u017eeksons '' , while in czech he 's `` michael jackson '' . 
  `` majkl d\u017eekson '' in latin serbian , `` michael jackson '' in croatian ( at least according to wikipedia ) . 
  a keyboard will be a huge problem . 
  i do n't know how serbians cope , but when i made a keyboard layout to test my latinisation of russian , i first put the letters in the traditional russian order , jcukeng\u0160\u015czh and so on . 
  when i tried to type something , my brain fucking exploded . 
  i touch type , so when my eyes saw latin letters , my fingers switched to qwerty and gibberish came out . 
  i then made a qwerty-based layout , but there 's the problem of fitting 31 letter where only 26 existed before . 
  i 've come up with a similar latin version of russian , having tried to make it both readable and unambiguous . 
  my only fear is that latinised russian will start to absorb english words without adjusting their spelling . 
  do n't . 
  it turns sticky very quickly and is a pain to wash off . 
  there was one iconic label back in the ussr , so everyone is copying it . 
  same with * syrok * . 
  you would be stopped at a checkpoint and turned back . 
  if you hired a local to take you past the checkpoints , you would be committing a crime . 
  just * where * are you from ? 
  what a sweet young lady . 
  blue like [ these ] ( https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=%d1%81%d0%b3%d1%83%d1%89%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%ba%d0%b0&amp;tbm=isch ) ? 
   home made liqueur oh , yes . 
  vodka/scm/nescafe = baileys irish cream . 
  here in russia sweetened condensed milk is extremely common . 
  it 's used for its original purpose in places like the army where it 's hard to provision so much milk . 
  most people use it as a sweet sauce , pouring it on pancakes or * syrniki * . 
  my wife adds it to her morning coffee . 
  back in soviet times it was common to boil a can of condensed milk to give something sweet to your kids , so now there 's all sorts of confectionery that has a `` boiled condensed milk '' flavour . 
  it probably tastes like childhood to some , but it tastes like poverty to me . 
  the only exception i am willing to tolerate and enjoy is the [ anthill cake ] ( http://natashaskitchen.com/2012/09/14/russian-cake-muraveinik-anthill-cake/ ) . 
  try and get away from vienna itself , light pollution means i ca n't see anything in the sky here in moscow .

  it 's not unique to russia , but it can be cooked in large quantities and can easily be cut into portions . 
  or a really huge pile of blini with different fillings on the side : sourcream , caviar , condensed milk , various jams , plus whatever other countries have brought . 
  and a georgian guy as a feastmaster .
