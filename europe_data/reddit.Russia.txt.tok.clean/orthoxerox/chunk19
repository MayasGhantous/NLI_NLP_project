  why should they ? 
  more taxes , shorter lives after retirement , what 's not to like ? 
  150 euros for food ? 
  sounds like you do n't eat enough . 
  it 's a river in yakutia , so it 's a turkic word . 
  not sure . 
  russian is a phonetic language practically without letter sequences or diacritics that result in unexpected pronunciation , so learning cyrillics is the only hurdle . 
  maybe some ethinic place names like \u042b\u0433\u044b\u0430\u0442\u0442\u0430 , since \u044b is an unusual sound for many europeans . 
  or maybe the english will finally learn that vladimir rhymes with `` redeemer '' ... 
  maybe all these illegal immigrants should be hired to build inexpensive housing ? 
  epic trolling . 
  every channel is showing ~ ~ butthurt ~ ~ indignant government officials of every level condemning the report . 
  it 's usually because the label says ** kvas ** ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ - flavored, 
  i was so upset i did n't even realise i could 've bought an upscale nut spread in the duty free shop to replace it until i fastened my seatbelt . 
  we do have them , but generally do n't celebrate them . 
  the only exception is tatiana , the patron saint of msu . 
  everyone knows the date , so tanyas have to endure annual congratulations . 
  i do n't know why , but i feel at peace there . 
  maybe it 's because it has the best hotel i 've ever stayed at , maybe it 's because i 've been there to visit our training and coaching center , but it 's a really , really pleasant place , despite an airport security officer confiscating my nutella . 
  or vienna/berlin , both are nice and not 100 % uptight like nrw cities . 
  til i might be a german . 
  that 's a very ... subtle reminder about self-evaluated geographical location of cz . 
  i should cook some , your link does n't work , by the way . 
  how different is it from the greek tzatziki ? 
  you do n't bitch enough about schleswig to qualify . 
  [ okroshka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/okroshka ) is the quintessential russian summer soup . 
  boiled meat or bologna/sausage , cucumbers , radish , onion greens , hard-boiled eggs are chopped and mixed with cold kvas and a dollop of sourcream . 
  traditionally eaten with hot boiled potatoes . 
  people who make it with whey instead of kvas are traitors to the nation . 
  yes , all our friends are alike . 
  because my hiking boots wo n't fit into my suitcase and the airline 's baggage allowance . 
  only if i am going swimming ; if i 'm hiking i want to keep my feet clean . 
  or finnish , named after the great racing driver mikka heineken . 
  english vocabulary is huge , it 's just no one learns most of it either . 
  no cases , no t/v distinction , just four verb forms , no verb aspect . 
  i have n't been to russian crimea . 
  well , voiced glottal fricative does n't have a good letter to be represented by . 
  g is usually a velar stop , but h is voiceless . 
  it 's harder than it looks , we tried fornatting first , but poland managed to recover the data . 
  had to try again in 1939 with much better results , you should overwrite the data if you try partitioning your neighbours . 
  montenegro felt totally like crimea , lots of russians and shitty service . 
  it actually * split * open . 
  i expected words that end on a consonant to be the biggest problem for italians . 
  oh , hello our northwestern province . 
  we have all that , but school-level english is atrocious . 
  we had to learn and tell a short monologue for each topic in the book , shit like ` my favourite season ' or `` my best friend '' . 
  some people in my class actually spelled out the sample text phonetically ( in russian ) and memorized the whole thing . 
  college-level english is not much better , since most english teachers there do n't give a fuck . 
  we had one who did n't , but she left after one year for a better paying job . 
  that 's because they 're playing dota instead of doing their homework . 
  dota is free to play , so you 'll get a lot of russian cheapskates/losers/schoolkids playing it . 
  dota , tf2 , wot if you 're older . 
  well , english / r / is much easier to pronounce than french/german / r / , so i think it 's a 50/50 split here . 
  vhat is ze probleme , exactly ? 
  vowels are the hardest aspect of the english language for russian speakers , i think . 
  russian manages fine with six vowel sounds ( aeiou\u0268 ) , with allophones being interchangeable , so it 's kinda hard to distinguish u / \u028a , e / \u00e6 / \u025c / \u025b , a / \u028c / \u0251 , \u0254 / \u0252 ( and there 's no o !, 
  ) , i / \u026a , and that 's without di/triphthongs and vowel length complicating things even further . 
  as much as belorussian/ukrainian are bastardized russian . 
  the split even began at the same time . 
  business papers tend to be the most neutral , like * kommersant * and * vedomosti * . 
   how russia 's most advanced military equipment stacks up against nato 's hardware business insider uk that 's one of the most useless articles i 've read this year . 
  `` they have tanks , nato has tanks . '', 
  what a shock !, 
  if a russian can read * the guardian * it 's very likely your views already have much in common . 
  if he/she can read only * komsomolskaya pravda * , i do n't think establishing a common basis is likely . 
  just how many times have you managed to change someone 's views by quoting a newspaper ? 
  you will be told your source is biased , just like i have in my previous message . 
  there are no unbiased sources of information , bias is inherent in any message created by a human . 
  scots is a separate language as well . 
  someone should build a copylefted house . 
  scots , the belorussian of english . 
  it was n't a terrorist attack , it was a madman 's rampage . 
  so he 's as dangerous during this weekend as all other austrians combined . 
  a t-shirt with bare-chested putin riding a bear . 
  sloboda ukraine and chernozem ? 
  ruthenia and novorossiya !, 
  cool map , though . 
  looks better than the real one . 
  do n't worry , one of my team members is going back to latvia with his wife and two kids , all unapologetically russian . 
  do you think a parting gift of a full bobbin of st. george ribbon will be nice ? 
  why do they want to get to england ? 
  what 's the difference between it and france ? 
  what 's wrong with pimps if prostitution is regulated ? 
  prostitutes must be first and foremost good at sex , not managing sales , finance , compliance , security , etc. 
  let pimps handle that side of their business . 
  if they have a clean and professional relationship there should n't be any exploitation . 
  i think that story was about germany and it turned out to be fake , no jobless germans were forced into prostitution by the state . 
  at first i thought the transcaucasian republics have been deported to vorkuta . 
  other than that i can not see any radical changes . 
  i will not disagree with you , but mixing up a military transport and a civilian jet sounds like ineptitude to me . 
  oh , come on . 
  mh-17 was closer to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siberia_airlines_flight_1812 ) , having been shot down because of the sammers ' ineptitude . 
  oh , yes , i really want to go back to 12erhorn . 
  salzkammergut is simply wonderful . 
  i now think all basques are crows in disguise . 
  do you sound like [ this guy ] ( http://youtube.com/watch?v=akxghtnpk6al ) when huehueing ? 
  what , you can use too . 
  if your font supports it , you will see a nice blue and yellow * prapor * . 
  six wolves , two lions , one tiger , one bear and one hyena have been shot dead by georgian special forces so far , according to various sources . 
  well , it depends .
