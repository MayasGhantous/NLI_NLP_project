  be less of a paranoid maniac , launch a surprise attack on june 21st . 
  eastern europe would n't be jealous of western europe , if you know what i 'm saying . 
  and eat food with less cholesterol . 
  does n't count , de jure drift takes 100 years . 
  i fail at twitter , but i see only a screencap of a fb post , no rifles . 
  however , the title says the pictures are not of the captured rifles , but taken off the net . 
  heavy industry was there , but it served the military , so there was no demand for cutting edge technology . 
  when the ussr collapsed , lack of demand left only primary industries standing , that 's why we export stuff like oil and aluminum , not plastics and machinery . 
  the earth is very smooth , mountains are minor wrinkles in real life . 
   he caught a cleaning lady stealing and offered her to shoot a video as a compensation . 
  what was the plot of the video ? 
  porn producer catches a cleaning lady stealing and offers her to shoot a video as a compensation ? 
  cian.ru and similar websites , plus there should be some ads on the light poles near the campus . 
  or relatives . 
  thank you for confirming that ukraine is russia . 
  [ polyushko-pole ] ( http://youtube.com/watch?v=8lwin-heomy ) is probably the most russian song anyone has ever heard . 
  i 'm on the phone , is zorba that sirtaki tune that starts with strumming like this taram ... taram ... taram ... tararararam ... . taram ... . taram ... . etc and then goes faster ? 
  or ievan polkka ( leekspin ) ? 
  russia is a big country , lots of girls . 
  it 's as big as 40 % of the whole poland , it 's a opulent gift from the president that demonstrates russian-polish friendship . 
  sweet . 
  for humanitarian reasons , polish autonomous oblast will have to be created to preserve polish culture and way of life . 
  around [ there ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/katangsky_district ) . 
  i want a land corridor to kaliningrad : belarus , podlasie and then maybe the rest of prussia , to keep borders neat . 
  not enough rice . 
  \u041f\u0456\u0432\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e-\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0456\u0434\u043d\u0456 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0456\u044f\u043d\u0438 , this way it 'll be much easier for them to hate you . 
  my favourite : a teacher in an estonian ssr school asks the class what the colors on the national flag stand for . 
  teacher : what does the blue stripe stand for ? 
  urmas : for our blue sky , which is now covered in smoke from soviet factories . 
  teacher : good , good . 
  what does the black stripe stand for ? 
  yes , ene ? 
  ene : for our native soil , which is trodden upon by soviet occupants . 
  teacher : good , good . 
  and what does the white stripe stand for ? 
  yes , valdemar ? 
  vovochka : for siberian snow , which is the only thing you all will see for the next ten years , nationalist scum !, 
  now they 'd have to kill four dynasty members . 
  or stop playing ckii so much . 
  how many people would you need to kill to unite the thrones of uk and any other extant kingdom ? 
  well , at least their parents are educated . 
  we 're talking about children , not family here . 
  what has happened to agriculture ? 
  can not compete with giant third world monoculture farms ? 
  what 's up with galicia/asturias ? 
  and karlsbad will become a german problem . 
   it is a gorgeous place in the summer with both open nature , forest , and a bit of beach nearby . 
  and a hill !, 
  * quiet flows the don * by sholokhov . 
  i was lucky to avoid reading it in school , so i properly enjoyed it when i was old enough to do so . 
  absolutely worthy of its nobel prize . 
  i wonder if ukrainians will see the current conflict reflected in it . 
  okay , you 're a bolshevik dictator and a nazi dictator proposes a non-aggression + spheres of influence pact to you . 
  why would you reject it ? 
  `` no , the people of eastern europe deserve freedom ! '', 
  no , they deserve soviet rule . 
  `` no , you 're a monster and i will never deal with you ! '', 
  now they can annex everything and get even closer to your borders . 
  declare war on them if they get too close ? 
  capitalist pigs will be glad to watch this war from the sidelines and then swoop in to finish off the victor . 
  both parties knew the war was inevitable and both wanted to buy some time to prepare . 
  it was a huge gamble that did n't ultimately pay off for either side . 
  well , i am not stalin , but i bet it did n't come as a surprise . 
  both parties were eager to backstab each other , the only question was of timing . 
  however , i would 've backstabbed hitler in 1939 had i a guarantee of france and britain opening a second front . 
  precisely . 
  what was planned as a major offensive operation turned out to be a symbolic gesture . 
  it 's not even a name , it 's a patronymic , the woman she was named after was probably called \u0415\u0444\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043d\u044c\u044f / yefrosinya . 
  it means `` a gigolo '' here in russia . 
  that period was n't called the phony war for nothing . 
  had i been stalin and had france actually attacked the rhineland , i would n't 've stopped at western bug . 
  [ sviyazhsk ] ( http://www.tripadvisor.com/showuserreviews-g298519-d4323899-r166754161-sviyazhsk-republic_of_tatarstan_volga_district.html ) . 
  we do n't have lots of old buildings left for multiple reasons ( primarily wooden construction , soviet disregard for everything old , wwii ) , so sviyazhsk is a rare case . 
  originally a fortress built by ivan iv to facilitate the siege of kazan , it was turned into an island in the kuybyshev reservoir . 
  i actually did n't like hallstatt at all , it 's no better than any other small town , i liked bad ischl more . 
  and yet no one attacked germany when it invaded poland , not just ussr . 
  everyone was happy enough to wait it out . 
  would i have signed the pact molotov did ? 
  hell yeah i would have . 
  would i have backstabbed hitler and attacked him first ? 
  hell yeah i would have , but i would n't do it alone , with everyone else waiting for nazis and bolsheviks to exhaust each other . 
  no , and i actually like that we have no sirs and misters in the army . 
  and it 's the only place in warsaw from which you can not see the palace of culture and science . 
  it has insane fps for a hand-drawn cartoon , under a market economy making it would 've been probititively expensive . 
  komorowski looks like the most reasonable candidate and also like the biggest asshole for refusing to take part in the debates , just like putin . 
  `` poor , but clean , '' as the russian saying goes . 
  you wo n't get customer-friendly service , but you will get what the state deems necessary , since services can have really low costs in a planned economy . 
   we 're starting a worldwide fire ,  we 'll raze churches and prisons to the ground ,  because between the taiga and the british seas  there 's no stronger army than the red . 
  thankfully , * oprichnik 's day * by sorokin does n't , yet , but the government is hard at work changing the reality to conform to the book . 
  pelevin 's books used to capture the spirit of each successive era , but probably not the everyday life itself , but that 's to be expected . 
  vladimir lenin , of course . 
  and one guy keeps laughing really hard . 
  when he notices others looking at him he explains he has n't heard that one . 
  and we would have gotten the straits too , if it were n't for these meddling brits . 
  i 've seen no killdozer in the film . 
  do you have a link ? 
  i have a link to a different story , but it 's geographically proximate . 
  rural russia - leviathan . 
  moscow of the lower class : [ dust ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dust_ ( 2005_film \\ ) ) . 
  depends on your definition of european , of course .
