  are you still in kramatorsk ? 
  everything east of the rhine , judging by their flair . 
  a howitzer and two ifv 's . 
  no , it was adopted in 1919 . 
  you know that nato 's m2 browning machine gun is also nearly 100 years old ? 
  it was designed in 1918 . 
  m1919 is even older and is still in use as well . 
  is n't that how the americans tell black bear and grizzly bear excrement apart ? 
  the latter smells of bear spray . 
  a colleague of mine got a carful of elk once . 
  he was lucky enough to be behind the wheel of a volvo . 
  i do n't know about you , but i would n't want to find out if the bear charging me was bluffing or not . 
  sorry , smokey . 
  they also do n't have elks , and that 's why americans call them moose - the colonists knew that an elk was supposedly some kind of a bigass deer , so they attached that name to the wapiti and used a local name for american elks . 
   let 's hear it for putin 's immediate resignation and cancellation of navalny 's verdict !, 
  the guy is absolutely mental , if i were in charge of a federal tv station , i would invite him to a prime time talk show to ridicule the opposition . 
  kinda small . 
  the one in * sam 'n' max hit the road * was more impressive . 
  take a look at somalia , ukraine 's doing pretty well . 
  a picture is worth a thousand words . 
  for some reason , meduza did n't publish this on their english site . 
  pro-europeans , of course , the others would have carried stalin 's portraits or gay merkel floats . 
  editorialized not to spoil the surprise . 
  neither mean nor median wage tell you much about the country . 
  i wish there was a comprehensive database of salaries where you could get data like : * median and third quartile net salary for a stem graduate with 10 years experience * median and net salary for a blue/pink collar worker with < 2 years experience * average monthly expenses for a middle class family with 2 children , subdivided into rent , food , yoga and other middle class things , etc. 
  mean wage allows you to compare countries , but is completely insufficient when comparing people 's lives . 
  i know about glassdoor , but it does n't have enough details . 
  not that far off , in berezniki . 
  and infamous perm-36 is even closer , just 100km away . 
  you mean domestic violence recognized as violence , not as the man being a pussy , do n't you ? 
  and a finnish-like kind of a squint . 
  those female executives do n't look pretty at all , they are much more likely to look like merkel or [ her ] ( https://www.google.ru/search?q=valentina+matviyenko&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;fir=trnnbprd3cevim%253a%252cslwmv_7dmp3zxm%252c%252fm%252f0g6qr9%253bivinimoiotrljm%253a%252cu7x4pet2gbfh7m%252c_%253bmiv-e2ott_hjam%253a%252cbn_uumq_p3ewlm%252c_%253b7m0ugqohknj7mm%253a%252c43y7mxo19prxhm%252c_&amp;usg=__oaisegrzr5u2iwbbinnkz8wjfpo%3d&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=vxlavcgmgsuqsqhopyhobg&amp;ved=0cdaqir4&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=559&amp;dpr=3 ), 
  if your hair is short and straight there are n't many ways to style it without `` gay stuff '' like gel or mousse or spray : * straight down * parted on the right * parted on the left * parted in the middle, 
  well , at least there 's no rybinsk reservoir like in euiv . 
  i scrolled like twice through the whole album looking for that guy before i got it . 
  russians not real slavs !, 
  ukraine the motherland of slavs !, 
  ancient ukrainians tamed the first horse !, 
  what 's the most common hairstyle in perm ? 
  the city was named after it !, 
  i 'll see myself out and go back to/r/dadjokes, 
  bears are pro-russian by definition , unless we 're talking about large hairy homosexuals . 
  `` i 've told you not to fish with explosives , private raivonen , now you 're screwed ! '', 
  `` but captain , there was totally a russian submarine there !, 
  the fish are simply collateral damage ! '', 
  `` ah , okay then . 
  and give me that fish , pekka . '', 
  yes . 
  ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) seriously , though , it 's nato 's job to sort this out . 
  i think the us quite enjoy their relationship with european nato members , them not being a geopolitical rival , it 's worth the cost . 
  are they pro-russian boars ? 
  voiced vs devoiced . 
  s.russian is voiced x , like greek gamma . 
  not really , there 's still quite a long way to go from there to crimea and the flank will be stretched too thin . 
  i would feign an attack on kharkov after taking mariupol and take energodar instead . 
  people were joking when 15 years ago or so we 'd passed a law that , on the contrary , granted the beekeeper rights on his runaway swarm and allowed him to cross private land in pursuit . 
  i know you have the voiced dorsal stop in some words , it was the most distinctive pronunciation difference i could think of , since you unshift `` i '' back to `` o '' and `` v '' back to `` l '' when talking in russian . 
  different h 's , if i remember my ipa , southern russian is velar , ukrainian is pharyngeal . 
   park chung-hee  chun doo-hwan i know they all look the same to an untrained eye of a european , but ... 
  chun doo-hwan 's dictatorship was not a democracy . 
  the only example i can think of are cleisthenes and ancient athens . 
  only in sweden . 
  the rest are proud stehpinklers . 
  the succession is the problem , not the rule . 
  what happens when he dies ? 
  plant a serbian flag there . 
  in russian : * driver 's license * dollar * football club * citizenship, 
  well , a whorehouse in salzburg had plenty of ukrainian and bulgarian women , but why latvia ? 
  the difference is no one will pull the punches in chechnya . 
  did n't he fuck 9 year old native girls ? 
  well , they got to france and exterminated one village , which is now an open air museum . 
  my great-grandfather was decorated for defending a village i have never heard of , because it no longer exists . 
  there are hundreds of belorussian , ukrainian and russian villages that are little more than overgrown mounds of bricks that had been the stoves . 
  are you willing to star in `` 16 years a slave '' ? 
  you could get an oscar . 
  if they have wi-fi an outdoor toilet is less of a problem . 
  itt : people talking about something they have n't experienced themselves . 
  does n't have to be a [ car ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vespa_150_tap ) . 
  we still have some places near the ru-ua-by border tripoint where you should n't go . 
  not as many as ukraine and belarus themselves have , but still . 
  lots of abortions were recommended by the doctors back in 1986 . 
  i still have my grandfather 's `` liquidator 's '' backpack . 
  he was in the military logistics , so he did n't have to get anywhere close to the site itself . 
  he never told anything about it . 
  too many people knowingly and unknowingly sacrificed themselves to contain the spill . 
  i wish there 'll never be any fuckups like this one , neither from the plant engineers nor from those responsible for minimizing the consequences . 
  we really did fight two [ different ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:bundesarchiv_bild_192-208,_kz_mauthausen,_sowjetische_kriegsgefangene.jpg ) wars in wwii . 
  does n't look like russia or georgia to me . 
  a german . 
  / u/egxplayer lives in germany . 
  russian , ukrainian and belorussian all share this feature . 
  donets basin was very popular last summer . 
  i doubt it was orchestrated specifically to kill ukrainians , but no one in charge worried about those affected by the famine dying of hunger , since they were class enemies in their eyes , having tried to avoid collectivisation and paying the grain tax . 
  and yes , ukraine was disproportionately affected , because its fertile lands were able to support successful independent farmers . 
  i nearly woke my wife and son with my laughter . 
  genetically ( y-dna ) hungarians are closer to poles and russians than serbs are . 
  yes . 
  we 're fringe europeans , like turkey and the uk , more european than the former and less european than the latter . 
  we 're different enough and not different enough at the same time . 
  i 'll start learning it ma\u00f1ana , then .
