  * russian * english * german ( even though my wife cringes every time i `` streamline '' another rule to make it more `` ordentlich '' ) * i can understand some ukrainian if we 're talking about modern concepts i would like to learn spanish , but i 've been getting lazier and lazier . 
  it looks like they forgot about electoral commissions , had they been staffed with the right people as well ... 
  yep , and there are other trains between belgorod and kharkov , for example . 
  or a bus that goes from lugansk to kharkov through russia . 
  in a rural home it keeps the walls warmer and masks their unevenness . 
  in an urban home it 's there for the same purpose , or simply because the residents are accustomed to having one . 
  at least their boots are impossible to polish by design . 
  we 've spent so much time `` fagging up '' ours , i kinda wish we 've made a switch as well . 
  one well-placed mortar strike ... 
  ukrainians might want to distance themselves from russia , but they still love carpets and frilly bedspreads . 
  we have some experience in dealing with royal families , send them to yekaterinburg . 
  say hello to peat fires with their noxious fumes . 
  the ussr should 've intensified the movement of people across the country ( not just workers , uni graduates and officers , but other people as well ) and gotten rid of ethnic republics . 
  if cee countries had been incorporated into the scheme as well , russians would have become a minority ( still a plurality , though ) , too . 
  depends on how hard you twist the forceps when pulling . 
  he ultimately was arrested , put on trial , found guilty and shot . 
  that probably * is * his strategy . 
  you should try and ask merkel . 
  what will be the new names of dnepropetrovsk , dneprodzerzhinsk and kirovograd ? 
  ukraine , no more crimea dispute and no more war in donbass . 
  armenians will be able to build a mile tall wall to protect themselves from your union with all the bricks they 'll shit if that happens . 
  but at least we got some [ awesome pictures ] ( http://www.abcgallery.com/v/vereshchagin/vereshchagin4.html ) out of that . 
  cleisthenes and athens ? 
  hehe , tajik unibrows , novosibirsk scientists and moldovan wine . 
  but it still collapsed after being blown up , did n't it ? 
  no , you can not let go of the car at all . 
  the guy was disqualified for that . 
  well , and for punching her in the face , too . 
  we have also suspended the death penalty , so there should be no difference , except our prisons are colder . 
  if the phone is password-protected , how can they access the data ? 
  do they need a search warrant ? 
  are people is general satisfied with the way valery 's trial has been conducted ? 
  yes , bilingualism was what i had in mind . 
  it 's inevitable that smaller languages will be at a disadvantage in a bilingual state . 
  i live in russia , that 's why i have written `` our regime '' . 
  i 've always said that estonian short-sighted nationalism is also part of a problem . 
  they could 've made estonia a better place for ethnic russians than russia with no strings like language or ideology attached . 
  a better place for russians than russia would 've been a bigger threat to our regime than anything else and would 've either destroyed it or changed it for the better , removing lots of vi-ru tensions . 
  everyone knows what pq-17 stands for , and there 's a popular movie about pilots shuttling american planes through chukotka , but the volumes of aid are n't explicitly discussed . 
  we hold them horizontally , but yes , we do . 
  onion peels , of course . 
  modern capitalism allows you to buy onion peels in a small cardboard box so do n't need to peel anything . 
  ice hockey and boxing . 
  yes , we do . 
  lots of villages in russia were barely better than subsistence farming communities , and now that food can be transported from other regions and even from abroad , there 's no economic purpose for a village somewhere in kirov oblast that has no amenties and is one hour away from the nearest shop . 
  the problem is that some old people can not leave these villages since they have nowhere else to go . 
  the other way around , sovkhoz workers were usually better off , as they did n't work for tally marks . 
  i would disenfranchise people that receive more than 50 % of their income from the government instead . 
  public officials , employees of state-owned companies , soldiers , prisoners , retired , and their dependents . 
  oh my god , it 's fedor !, 
  1654 best year of my life . 
  what should i shout if i want to blend in and offend them in latvian ? 
  depends on the city . 
  here in moscow it 's really hot , not boiling hot , of course , but painfully hot . 
  and its residents were called leopolitans . 
  very nice , and very different from a russian or even eastern/central ukrainian city . 
  any reason why the title is in surzhyk ? 
  yes , and district heating is a thing even in the uk : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/district_heating#united_kingdom here it generally works like that : superheated water is pumped from the power station and there 's a small substation in each city block where it heats the tap water and the heating water in the surrounding blocks of flats . 
  some got to live that dream of yours in yekaterinburg . 
  * that awful sound , bang-bang , my baby shot me down *, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miracle_of_the_house_of_brandenburg we could 've prevented the formation of prussia-led germany and completely changed the course of history . 
  alternatively , we could 've attacked the third reich on the 21st of june 1941 , or even in 1939 . 
  eastern europe would start on the banks of rhein ... 
  something like [ this ] ( http://youtube.com/watch?v=skufs5mj26g ) . 
  `` life-wife '' is not russian , but poles and ukrainians do that . 
  i 'll probably make a separate post about vote manipulation , since last night i was filled with impotent rage thinking about our last parliamentary election . 
  i wo n't mind if they do . 
  a small district of kaliningrad was rebuilt in northern european style , it looks quite nice despite being too gingerbready . 
  it was heavily damaged by both raf bombs and soviet shelling . 
  the `` robot head '' could easily be demolished , since it has never been completed , but rebuilding the castle from scratch is not an easy or cheap task . 
  it has actually been proposed and planned several times , but kaliningrad oblast is n't rich enough to restore the castle by itself . 
  in my personal opinion , we should spend our cultural budget on preserving extant heritage sites , like st. pete , novgorod , yaroslavl , vladimir and suzdal , derbent . 
  when they are safe and secure we can start thinking about other sites . 
  i was going to post that we have already perfected liquid armor ( enough shots and you think you 're invincible ) , but you 've beaten me to it :(, 
  actually , there 's no problem at all . 
  societies willing to implement e-voting with end-to-end cryptoaudit are most likely not corrupt enough to have vote manipulation during the voting and counting process . 
  and a corrupt society will not have its problems solved by e-voting . 
  interesting , we do n't have such precautions in russia . 
  for e-voting , you could have a `` duress '' digital signature that works like a normal one , but secretly invalidates your vote . 
  do n't you have privacy stalls for filling in the ballot ? 
  there 's an anecdote about augustus ii having our peter i over for dinner and rolling his silver platter into a tube because it was n't clean enough . 
  peter thought it was a challenge and crumpled his own . 
  they proceeded to wreck the rest of the dinner set , trying to one up each another . 
  i am not jealous of your income taxes and mineral wealth , almost all other aspects of russia could be improved . 
   take a picture of your ballot with your phone camera and send it to me . 
  if you do n't , or vote for the wrong candidate , i 'll break your legs . 
  how come this is not possible in the netherlands ? 
  there was a certain georgian ... also , the antepenultimate rurikid on the throne of moscow did a lot of crazy shit , like : * running away and promising to take the vows unless he got his way * enthroning a tatar prince and then taking the throne back * splitting the country into feudal and authoritarian parts and fucking up the latter * ironically killing his son when he accused the father of domestic violence, 
  the trips are boring , you have to visit lots of bullshit sights and are accompanied by several dprk guides at all times . 
  capitalist pigs can visit dprk as well . 
  pelmeni are the most common `` ca n't be bothered '' food , but they are commonly eaten by students . 
  other than them , it 's probably two fried eggs and a sausage . 
  pour an egg on top of it too , it 's amazing . 
  no , alexander the great was macedonian , not greek !, 
  ^ ^ ^ i 'll ^ ^ ^ never ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ tired ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ that, 
  ancient greeks would 've thought him a manifestation of ares : cruel , insane , very good at warmaking and fucking indestructible . 
  i am continously amazed at his survival , neither side is able to get rid of him . 
  hell , i chopped some into my soup and ate it !, 
  nope , do n't like it at all .
