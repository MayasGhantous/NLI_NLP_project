  i have n't been to novgorod , but black sea russians have been negatively affected by the tourism industry . 
  i can say that siberian russians are the most practical-minded and independent . 
  mastika is something you glue parquet to the floor with . 
  i ca n't read georgian letters , how is boxtree called in georgian ? 
  in russian it 's called \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0448\u0438\u0442 , which sounds like `` some shit '' . 
  i find this slightly hilarious . 
  and we 're still stuck with intra-russian roaming charges ... 
  well , `` kievan rus '' is an exonym , no one living either in halych , kiev or suzdal called their land `` kievan rus '' . 
  they would say '' \u0420\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u04d5 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0467 '' , and this translates perfectly well into ukrainian , you can call your wikipedia article '' \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 '' , since you use '' \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 '' for everything that relate to the modern russian state/nation . 
  now in russian we use '' \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 '' for things that relate to the modern russian state and '' \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 '' for things that refer to the modern russian nation . 
  this does n't mean we 're trying to privatize our common history . 
  i do n't really see the need . 
  i have full-sized tools at home , a cardboard knife at the office , i do n't need one during my commute . 
  i might consider a hunting knife for hiking trips or spending time at the dacha . 
  many drivers carry a tire iron or a baseball bat with them , and rural russians are more likely to carry a small axe or a simple knife with them . 
   i think i 'll choose slovenia . 
  or was that slovakia i liked ? 
  no , slovenia . 
  oh , screw it , let 's pick norway . 
   \\ - everyone, 
  not that many places where palm branches are available here in russia . 
  can confirm , today 's willow sunday . 
  [ russian ] ( http://englishrussia.com/2014/03/29/russian-official-army-field-ration/ ) one has n't changed much . 
  what the hell are you talking about ?!, 
  are you answering to my posts , or to their bizarre interpretations ? 
  how the fuck am i sugarcoating the murder of 15000 people who were murdered for being likely to support the idea of having their own nation state ? 
  we need to break the fuck up with our current authoritarian traditions . 
  however , i think the government itself should be meritocratic , with federal ministers elected from themselves by the regional ministers . 
  federal-only ministerial positions should be given to candidates chosen by the parliament . 
  and no pm , like in switzerland . 
  it 's like espionage . 
  all countries forbid espionage , but have n't disbanded their own espionage agencies . 
  or like islam . 
  you can convert to islam , but you ca n't convert from islam . 
  yeah , not the most flattering comparisons ... 
  nope . 
  the poles were killed for being educated poles , but the people killing them were n't killing them because that 's what russians do . 
   it thaught me where and what ruthenia is . 
  nope , ruthenia that the article is talking about is c_bereg and c_maramaros in d_ungvar in k_hungary , not k_ruthenia, 
  russia : 28 * calendar * days of paid vacation if you 're a full-time worker . 
  you must take 14 consecutive days off each year , that 's exactly two weeks . 
  the rest you can take however you like . 
  national holidays are also paid days off , and they are shifted if they fall on a weekend , if they fall on your vacation , you get that vacation day back . 
  you are also entitled to three paid days off when your child is born , for your wedding or for a funeral of your close relative . 
  i also get six extra paid days off for unpaid overtime . 
  i think the federal minimum is three days . 
  sick leave is paid from the federal social security fund and is capped very low . 
  my employer , however , covers the difference for the first n days each years depending on the time spent with them . 
  of course , you ca n't just call in sick , you need a sick leave note from a doctor . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3jhtfh7.jpg ) painting by lushpin makes all russian emigrants go hnnnng . 
  nothing russophobic about that . 
  red army was n't russian . 
  most soldiers and officers were russian , and most nkvd personnel were russian as well but they did n't kill the poles because they were poles and they were russians . 
  they killed them because they were given orders to kill them . 
  and the leaders who gave those orders knew that nationalism was the biggest enemy of any empire , including the ussr , and , being cruel as they were , decided that killing the national elite was the best way to combat nationalism . 
  poor latvia ... 
  is there a cap on the elterngeld ? 
  like , if you 're a ceo you wo n't get 2/3 of your income , but less ? 
  the british should n't be allowed to comment on food . 
  i think this one is a spoof . 
  i have n't met a single one , or at least an observant one . 
  i know they had some dispute with indira gandhi , who was stupid enough to order an armed assault on their principal temple while guarded by sikh bodyguards , with predictable results . 
  since when does it count as pasta ? 
  it 's ~ ~ one of the four indian tribes banished to oklahoma by jackson ~ ~ porridge . 
  practically any polish surname that ends with - ska or - cka belongs to a woman . 
  halina is a she . 
  survivorship bias . 
  it 's a tough question . 
  it has to be something that on one hand affects every russian in a positive way directly , so it can not be spun into something different by the media , but affects our regime in a negative way , and obviously so . 
  but what can it be ? 
  navalny proposes to freeze the assets of our politicians in the eu . 
  those of us who listen to different media outlets will get a warm fuzzy feeling , but the crooks in power will simply vote to compensate themselves from the budget while telling everyone eu is stealing russians ' property . 
  visa-free entry ? 
  again , this will affect only those who can afford a trip to europe . 
  airdropping free food on the smaller cities to circumvent `` countersanctions '' ? 
  doubt russian gov will allow that . 
  randomly inviting provincial russian schoolchildren to spend a year in a european school and paying for the trip ? 
  that 's a very long game that can be shut down by our gov at any time . 
  gah , this is so fucking idiotic . 
  it 's not even a pride parade underneath your windows , it 's a fucking theatre play that you have to ** go and pay money ** to see . 
  and now our government panders to those who are offended by something that simply exists . 
  i understand * why * it is doing it , but it makes me so fucking mad . 
  ukraine or austria , if the former wo n't make russian language official even after tens of millions of homeless russians move there . 
  the us are also an option , but they are n't so easy to emigrate to . 
  [ virgin komi forests ] ( http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/719 ) are missing . 
  also , you can clearly see on the map the extent of nazi advance into the rsfsr , only novgorod managed to survive . 
  everyone liked to fuck serbians , it seems . 
  the murky abyss of college cuisine ... 
  i think i just vomited into my mouth a little . 
  plov with mayo ? 
  that 's worse than oatmeal with ketchup . 
  i was trying to make a joke about slooooow eeeeestooooonians . 
  ah , yes , fydzhin . 
  yes , it is ossetian , except i have a suspicion it 's as ossetian as general tso 's chicken is chinese . 
  do you like adjarian khachapuri , with an egg poured onto the still hot cheese ? 
  once or thrice if you 're old . 
  no mm kissing , unless you 're from the caucasus or really old . 
  mf mainly reserved for relatives . 
  ff was very common since middle school . 
  cuisine of the northern caucasus ?
