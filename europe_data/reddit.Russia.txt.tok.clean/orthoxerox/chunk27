  i wish we had more borders that look like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/smz3uk3.jpg ) . 
  a georgian , and several ukrainians . 
  our emperors since cathetine ii were all technically non-russian . 
  nope . 
  some were , but more than enough remain . 
  they usually were repurposed for more profane activities . 
  has anyone else misread this as `` anal view of bulgaria '' ? 
  we say `` fuck your mother '' to express frustration , not to insult . 
  `` now the cunt went off charging across the tussocks '' - something unfavourable has started . 
  `` to shake down pears with your dick '' - to waste time . 
  `` if grandma had a dick she would be a grandpa '' - used to interrupt someone overusing conditional sentences . 
  `` fit neither for the cunt nor the red army '' - useless, 
  that 's because hofstede 's definition of masculinity does n't make lots of sense . 
  it 's more about non-conformity than masculinity . 
  * [ the kremlin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_kremlin ) is nice , very italian . 
  * [ pskov krom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pskov_krom ) , said to be the largest stone fortress in europe . 
  * [ naryn-kala ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9d%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%8b%d0%bd-%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%b0 ) , a persian fortress in derbent . 
  * [ novgorod kremlin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novgorod_kremlin ) * [ nizhny novgorod kremlin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nizhny_novgorod_kremlin ) * [ ivangorod fortress ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivangorod_fortress ) , to guard against those crafty estonians  * [ oreshek ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shlisselburg ) , which has changed hands so many times . 
  we do n't really have small compact castles perched on islands or mountaintops . 
  i also did n't include any monasteries , despite them being fortresses in all but name . 
  lithuania , they have kovno/kowno , and this sounds hilarious to russians and poles . 
  i read those linked to through `` related discussions '' and they were quite sane . 
  does reddit bubble users like google does ? 
  i 'd use water on concrete instead . 
  much more humane . 
  stay put , since guys with ak47 's are obviously not our army , but some kind of poor-ass irregulars . 
  i 'll wait for the real soldiers to arrive . 
  i wonder how high the fees and deposits are in each of the cities . 
  a cursory check showed that most agencies want 2 months worth of rent as their fee and 3 months worth of rent as a damage deposit in vienna , which means 6 months worth of rent up front . 
  idiots . 
  centuries ago germany was a bunch of tiny states , china was going to be fucked in the ass by the british , usa did n't exist and japan would only trade with the dutch . 
  i am more worried about the next 30 years . 
  you know what 's the worst thing ? 
  even if nemtsov was n't killed by someone directly or indirectly motivated by our current paranoia , even if it really was something insanely random like a gambling debt to the ingush mafia , * no one with two neurons to fire together will ever believe that * . 
  our police and our courts have become so discredited by all the sham cases that no verdict will be accepted as true . 
  i actually prefer shalamov to solzhenitsyn . 
  the latter had n't spent that much time in a real gulag , and his writing is sub-par compared to shalamov 's . 
  i meant at the level of regular people , not politicians . 
  i did n't say anything about our economy or freedoms , which i agree are in a sorry state . 
  however , we 're still able to hold russia together , and we 're not resorting to truckloads of money and truckloads of fsb everywhere . 
  that 's why i said `` of his own '' . 
  * snaps his fingers * ey , ey , vun mor glas of zis , eta , nu , koroche , davay blyat . 
  do n't worry , we would never rape that many estonians . 
  ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ enough ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ estonians seriously though , i am not proud of that page in the history of wwii . 
  nothing to hue about . 
  there are many ukrainians in russia , many russians in ukraine , many mixed families . 
  only in 2014 did the alienation start . 
  now many russians think ukrainians are nazis and many ukrainians think russians are mindless zombies . 
  this makes us more imperialistic and them more nationalistic . 
  you know that the old cities here in central russia are often named after even older cities in what is now modern ukraine ? 
  that 's where the settlers came from . 
  we have galich , starodub , zvenigorod , peremyshl , pereyaslavl . 
  edit : clarified the direction for the downvoters . 
  ruthenians = rus , it 's kinda senseless to draw a distinction between them . 
  the poles called the local nobles szlachta ruska , after all . 
  yeah , let 's send the spanish to halstatt and gotland and give it back to the basques . 
  then it 's not a problem if another million finno-ugrians becomes russian as well ? 
  why does italy play in blue , by the way ? 
  well , lend-lease sure helped a whole lot , but i have no idea what this has to do with estonia . 
  yeah , they should 've used biblical methods . 
  you 're lucky bolsheviks were militant atheists . 
  or the other way around . 
  portugal just ca n't get a break . 
  well , your country * did * side against russia in both world wars . 
  i think op 's google profile has been polluted by his/her reddit searches . 
  there was a popular comment about `` france is bacon '' on askreddit . 
  re : sweden swedish stool exists , it 's what you get after eating at the * swedish table * of a third-rate all-inclusive egyptian hotel . 
  but not the perfidious brits . 
  they had the gall to build a monument in london commemorating their participation in that war . 
  i could 've sunbathed today too if i had a garden . 
  you brits with your bloody gulfstream , enjoying clement weather for that latitude . 
  in frigid russia there 's not much you can eat fresh in may . 
  you can gather wild sorrel and nettles to make green shchi or an omelette , maybe you have some spring onions growing on your window sill , but mostly you 're stuck with imported or last year 's vegetables . 
   but there is n't a traditional attire that is representative of 100 % of germany . 
  not all sr images feature paragons or ideals to inspire society . 
  the only difference in nr 's endorsement of harmless cheeky fun . 
  in sr all cheeky fun is ultimately bad . 
  flair checks out . 
  what the fuck is that shit on the left ? 
  28.3 % of them are there because of drug-related offences . 
  i think that 's a good indicator that some decriminalisation of drug use is required . 
  alaska 's in the way . 
  ah , you 're telling us we can annex it , are n't you ? 
  the wife does n't look german at all , with cheekbones like hers she must be a mail-order bride from ru/ua/by . 
  it looks like norman rockwell 's america with a german twist . 
  he technically was a socialist realist , but no one in the us will admit that . 
  dachshunds are used to hunt badgers inside their dens . 
  they are hunting dogs alright . 
  when he speaks i feel like a fucking bandar-log in front of kaa . 
  edit : i was talking about obama . 
  and it was passed * after * fdr 's death . 
  now this will only be shown to hiv-positive people . 
  and their unwitting partners sharing the connection . 
   streckenverbote it 's just `` verbote '' in russian , so it sounds much more romantic . 
  have we run out of money ? 
  is it called `` the end of all limitations '' in german as well ? 
  valenok is a felt boot , not a fur boot . 
  and it 's always nice to see someone named rappoport consider themselves russian . 
  typical french culinary snobism , nothing to look at . 
  ynglism is actually outlawed in russia as religious extremism .
