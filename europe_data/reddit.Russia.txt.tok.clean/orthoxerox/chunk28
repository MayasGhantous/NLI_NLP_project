  that 's because ckii map is a piece of shit . 
  depends on the dialect . 
  yeah , moon hen would 've been better . 
  or maybe mewn hen . 
  balto-slavs with germanic and celtic influence became slavs and spread across the newly vacated lands . 
  a perfect example of a simple cybernetic failure . 
  there 's no feedback mechanism built into the system . 
  no one , neither courts nor prosecutors nor ministries are able to provide feedback to moderate the application of the law because this function has been purged from them over the last years . 
  they can only overimplement it to guarantee 100 % compliance . 
   also , mushroom hunting is a way of making money for many old people . 
  i remember buying some dried porcinis from an old lady in suzdal . 
  we only had a 5k note with us and were worried she did n't have any change . 
  `` do n't worry , '' she told us and pulled out a tiny purse ** fucking stuffed ** with bills . 
  well , yes . 
  not all great recipes have to be complex . 
   [ i do n't know the name in english , they are oily ] mushrooms do they have slimy skin on their cap that peels easily ? 
  might be suillus . 
  what , button mushrooms are expensive in france ? 
  they literally grow on shit !, 
  russia 's big on mushrooms . 
  everyone buys [ button mushrooms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agaricus_bisporus ) , [ chanterelles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chanterelle ) and [ oyster mushrooms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pleurotus_ostreatus ) in shops , dried [ cep ( porcino ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boletus_edulis ) from babushkas , there are flash frozen [ * leccinum aurantiacum * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leccinum_aurantiacum ) , [ * leccinum scabrum * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leccinum_scabrum ) and [ honey fungus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armillaria ) for sale as well . 
  mushroom hunting is still going strong , even in moscow ( well , not * in * moscow , of course ) . 
  there are literally dozens of mushrooms that can be gathered and fried , dried or pickled . 
  i think the most common mushroom dishes in russia are mushroom soup with dried porcini and fried potatoes with common myshrooms like chanterelles , honey fungus or [ russula ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russula ) . 
  i myself enjoy pickled [ * lactarius turpis * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lactarius_turpis ) ( ugly/black milk-cap ) . 
  where 's crimea ? 
  mongolia itself . 
  where are mongolia and russia ? 
  i actually like this design more than the real one . 
  ** `` the bear '' ** everyone takes a shot and the drink master says , `` the bear has come '' . 
  everyone hides under the table . 
  then the drink master says , `` the bear has left '' , and everyone has to return to their seats . 
  repeat until everyone is stuck under the table or the drink master is unable to speak . 
  hu 's first ? 
  do you mean beta israel ? 
  always nice to open the comment thread and see our neighbours stroking their egos . 
  it is n't about being able to violate you in perverted ways , keep your pants on . 
  open the wikipedia page of any provincial russian town and you will see the same : `` local economy : cannery ( closed down in the 90s ) , cement plant ( closed down in the 90s ) , dairy farm ( closed down in the 90s ) '' . 
  small town russia fucking sucks . 
  it sucked in the soviet times as well ( back then your dachas were for growing food and were a must ) , but you had a stable job and free housing , which is what 's remembered from the soviet times . 
  now people see moscow yuppies ( like me ) earning twenty times as much as them , they see no new jobs in their beloved flycrapton , they can not afford to buy a mortgage for a flat in their oblast capital , of fucking course they wish they were back in the ussr . 
  english is the most common third language in the national republics , with russian and the local language being the first two . 
  i now imagine bob ross saying `` there are no terrorist acts , only happy little accidents '' while painting a manhattan skyline . 
  russian civil war ended in a total victory for the reds . 
  the whites had to reconvert or to flee the country . 
  they have no representation in modern russia . 
  i think only yabloko commemorates the deaths of junkers who fought the reds in moscow . 
  the fact that some of the emigres supported hitler in his struggle against `` yido-bolshevism '' certainly did n't help their public image . 
   we have more than 1 type of bread pre-sliced and not pre-sliced ? 
  we 're not that stupid . 
  [ apartment bombings in 1999 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_apartment_bombings ) were done by the fsb to rouse public support for another chechen war . 
  basically , we invented 9/11 truthers before it was cool . 
  `` we 're already fucked , if trump wins he 'll at least fuck up america and the rest of the world . '', 
   pes\u00e4pallo baseball ? 
  can confirm it 's relatively popular in russia . 
  canadian ice hockey is still more popular , though . 
  we do n't have many virgin temperate forests suitable for wisents . 
  we have lots of virgin taiga , and it 's good enough for elk and bears , but not for wisents . 
  in russia : * yes ( usually \u0434\u0430 / da ) is \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e / tak tochno/exactly like that * no ( usually \u043d\u0435\u0442 / net ) is \u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0435\u0442 / nikak bet/in no way no * order acknowledged is \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c / yest ' / ( there ) is , this is actually a mistranslated `` yes , sir '', 
  yep , - k - is a common dismissive suffix in russian . 
  obama-obamka , volodja-volod ` ka , russia-rashka . 
  sounds like someone has discovered rezun 's less coherent notes . 
  why not hochland ? 
  sounds very european . 
  \u0420\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430 is a common russophobic slur . 
  or `` the englishwoman shits again '' , '' \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0442 '' . 
  if it gets away too far its indistinguishable from plastic . 
  oh no , / r/crusaderkings is leaking again . 
  nah , there must be a butthurt neighbour with a similarly named province , so the name should be `` the former czechoslovak republic of silesia '' . 
  russian national cuisine is not very fast and not that shitty , so we have to import stuff like heartburn-inducing sbarro pizza or shifty shawarma . 
  black irish sounds like it 's a cocktail recipe . 
  yep . 
  i would also rename all krais to ukraines . 
  i think ireland is just called ireland , they are simple people . 
  and croatian `` zrakoplov '' , literally `` air-swimmer '' . 
  rus . 
  the adjective/demonym in english would be ruthenian , they like latin adjectives for some reason . 
  at least it 's not steklovata . 
   plazma keks plazma keks ? 
  blood plasma or ionized gas ? 
  is it for herding sheep underground ? 
  emmanuelle cunt , the great russian mathematician !, 
  [ shut up !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/u90dnubzmmm ), 
  ossetian pies are our answer to pizza . 
  same shape , but they have two crusts and the filling is simple , one of the following : - meat - cheese - beet greens - potatoes - mushrooms - cabbage - chicken or a combination of two of them . 
  a link to the first delivery place on google : http://ospirogi.ru/catalog/osetinskie_pirogi/ i 'll let a georgian tell you about khachapuri . 
   smoked reindeer , chanterelle and red onion sounds delicious . 
  or when you get back to the usa from a mexican hospital and a psychopath with a captive bolt gun is after you . 
  yeah , that 's a picture of military uniforms , not traditional dress . 
  even a folk dancing ensemble would 've been better . 
   the party leader holds a deep personal hatred towards russia hatred is hatred , * biznes * is * biznes * . 
   also , russia is in top 10 countries in the world by domestic violence on women . 
  the men were just trying to fight back against the oppression !, 
   any idea who might replace him ? 
   when i look at people i can usually distinguish of theyre ukrainian or russian or polish for example despite all of is being slavs . 
  yeah , that 's easy . 
  if they 're not jumping they 're russian etc. 
  i think robert sheckley has written a story about that scenario already . 
  but who will fight against the robots when they revolt ?
