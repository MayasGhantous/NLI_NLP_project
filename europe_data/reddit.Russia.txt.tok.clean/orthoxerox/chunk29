   you need a separate room to raise kids no you do n't . 
  you need one when they are old enough to wank . 
  the situation 's not that bad yet . 
  old people living right now are the last generation with many children , so even their pensions are enough when their grandkids chip in . 
  you should abolish pensions and increase inflation . 
  this will make people have children again . 
  not a 100 % match , but if i had to choose between them and ur , then yes . 
  i actually am a social democrat , but that 's liberal enough compared to the people in charge .

  korkunov 's good especially if we 're talking about chocolate candy ( pralines ) . 
  chocolate bars by babayevskiy are also good . 
  are these calendar days or working days ? 
  in russia we get 28 vacation days , but they are calendar days , i.e. , four weeks off . 
  you can split them in smaller chucks to get more time off ( 14 mandatory days + 5 + 5 + 4 next to a public holiday for five weeks in total ) , but this reduces your salary . 
   onto the keyboard onto your black and white striped shirt , you mean . 
   previously this `` privilege '' was available only to fsb nope , the police 've had this right as well since the last amendment of the law, 
  he was likely not a soviet partisan , but a polish nationalist partisan , very much a class enemy to the internationalist su . 
  low effort trolling deserves only low effort replies . 
  the nature there , like in kashmir , is breathtaking .

  country balls are banned now . 
  calatrava , it 's your time to go too . 
   should those germans have been left behind the iron curtain , really ?

  he 's a real kant , is n't he ? 
  `` putin has sold his country to the jews ! '',

  yes , and there are huge komi forests in russia as well . 
  they are threatened by mining lobby , though . 
  you forgot about their huge white sneakers . 
  [ sorry ] ( https://youtu.be/wja2mpu_y6w?t=74 ), 
  on the contrary , prussian customs union was a * huge * boon for inter-german trade . 
  every single prince of their own hankie-sized plot of land tried to tax you for crossing his border . 
  we * trabajo * from 9 to 18 . 
  get up at 7 , 1 hour for breakfast , 1 hour to get to work , 1 hour for lunch , home at 19 , 1 hour for dinner , 3 hours of * tv e internet * . 
  conditioning and hearty dinners . 
  they do say it like that oop north . 
  the ride the boos , spread the bootter , etc. 
  oh , so it 's only the irish and northern english that do that . 
  do scots say `` cunt '' as `` koont '' , by the way ? 
  how does a lavrov-steinmeier pact sound to you ? 
  what about those people who died under the bombs ? 
  did they personally rape women and slaughter villages ? 
  well , we have two consonant clusers in `` greetings '' , '' ** zdr ** a ** vstv ** uyte '' , so that name 's not a big deal . 
  why was maslenica relevant during the nineties ? 
  in russian it 's the name for the week before lent , i.e. 
   \u017ddre\u0161ka ( i suppose not many could pronounce that ... ) .

  never again shall we let our rulers do this to us or to other nations . 
  assassinations or even better kidnappings of people directly involved in the genocide would definitely have been a better option . 
  why not ban all foreign funding of religious ngos ? 
  `` lakoma '' is def a slavic loanword , in russian this root means `` to eat with relish , to enjoy something tasty '' . 
  hm , sounds like our root `` alk '' might be related , too , and it means `` greed '' . 
  they are from completely different language families . 
  hungarian has pretty many slavic loanwords , but that 's it . 
  i expected that link to lead to the mettschwanz . 
  it was bigger than usual .
