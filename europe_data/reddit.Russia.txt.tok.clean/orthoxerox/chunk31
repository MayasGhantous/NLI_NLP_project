  stavropol-on-volga , then :p, 
  only if the biggest monocity in russia is called togliatti . 
  transnistria means `` beyond the dniester '' , so it 's a name that positions the speaker in moldova/romania , on the `` right '' side of the dniester . 
  someone wants to be your country 's boris yeltsin , claiming to be dragging it undemocratically towards democracy . 
  damn , the ttolk blog is down , but here 's the [ google cache link ] ( http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:lf3xlvq0bgoj:ttolk.ru/%3fp%3d4051+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ru ) .

  the middle stripe on your flair has the wrong color . 
  surely you have meant it to be blue with an answer like this . 
  it 's weird that antes are named slavs on this map , but venedi are n't . 
  did n't know the reservoirs on the dnieper were so ancient , the soviet government must 've lied to us when it claimed it had built them !, 
   i want lawyer !,

  i think they got past the rhine and had a chain of forts from something like frankfurt to regensburg . 
  there was no word for `` jewish passover '' in the dictionary , so the expert hired by the prosecution incorrectly reinterpreted it as `` jewish sidelocks '' , but the resulting sentence does n't make sense grammatically .

  georgian cuisine is the shit . 
  i love it myself . 
  do n't show this map to putin , it 's obvious from it that aukshtaytia is an ancient russian land occupied bu zhmud . 
  hello . 
  lenin was a german agent sent to topple the provisional government and to sign the peace treaty .

  i can apply for citizenship after four years of permanent residence . 
  has it always contained palm oil ? 
  what was used in the original recipe ? 
  pros : - i am not treated as an immigrant - lowish taxes - moscow never sleeps - still lots of functioning social ladders - labour code that favours the employee cons : - the climate could be better - a bunch of criminally incompetent criminals in charge - all other cons can be fixed when # 2 is fixed, 
  oil,

  a double assault from transnistria and the sea would secure odessa , but getting to dnepr from there would be harder . 
  i do n't mind , honestly .

   i 've already driven past gypsy villages that 's right , if you want to visit a gypsy village even a rolling stop is too risky .

  - you 're muscovy !, 
  - and you 're kozakstan !,
