  if you ask us , we can invade ireland , the netherlands and luxembourg for you to force them to change their tax codes . 
  please force cyprus to do the same for us ... 
  yeah , it was just a war crime . 
   original jokes  / r/europe pick one, 
  i assure you that lots of russians were moved from their indigenous homelands with cattle wagons and dropped off to siberian forests or kazakhstan to live off grass basically . 
  you ca n't really say that russians have suffered significantly less under the soviet regime than , say , estonians , or that their presence in the government was disproportionately high . 
   ethnic population transfers never touched russians and russians were brought in to many regions ( crimea , estonia , latvia ) to colonize them did they or did they not ? 
  there are other debatable points in your list , but this one is self-contradictory . 
  why ? 
  you can call them * soviet * death camps if you insist . 
  they were soviet labour camps with death as a ( very likely ) side-effect . 
  [ yes ] ( https://www.znak.com/2013-01-30/nostalgiya_po_gulagu_v_prikame_otmetili_yubiley_usollaga_eto_vernost_rodine_vzaimovyruchka_eto_tysya ), 
  i think most people try not to think about them too much . 
  i personally think they were an abominable monstrosity and being proud of working for one of them is insane . 
  you can call gulag camps russian death camps to piss us off . 
  should we say `` a nazi german death camp located on the occupied polish lands '' instead ? 
  that 's too inoffensive , how can you piss off poles with a definition like that ? 
  we boil noodle soup for ten minutes !, 
  where is your god now ? 
  i know we make italians cry with our [ pasta scotta ] ( https://www.google.ru/search?q=%d0%ba%d0%be%d1%82%d0%bb%d0%b5%d1%82%d0%b0+%d1%81+%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%bc%d0%b8&amp;tbm=isch ) . 
  all the mongolian khans were called `` tsar '' in the chronicles , before them only ere rulers were called `` tsar '' . 
  a tsar is definitely an emperor . 
  a colleague of mine must be a secret bulgarian . 
  i bet he eats pies with bread . 
  what do you do with barley ? 
  have i told you you 're my favorite novelty account ? 
  russians eat rye and wheat as bread , wheat as overcooked pasta , rice as plain rice , pilaf and as rice porridge . 
  buckwheat is very commonly eaten as porridge . 
  barley and millet are eaten as cheap porridges . 
  oats are eaten for breakfast . 
  maize is relatively uncommon . 
  is bodenseekreis there because of zf ? 
   punishing winters yeah , i got positively drenched yesterday and several streets were flooded . 
  with our homicide rates so high and gun ownership rates so low i wonder what our murder weapon of choice is . 
  i do n't understand why that can be called democracy . 
  no , ukrainian activists started blocking russian trucks in ukraine and were n't being arrested . 
  russia then stopped the transit of ukrainian trucks , since ukraine has de facto done the same . 
  in retaliation , ukraine officially stopped the transit of russian trucks . 
  i do n't expect russia to beat the us in politics , war or economy . 
  turkey is quite similar to poland , but poland is the leader of the anti-russian europe , while we do n't really have that many real reasons to compete with turkey beyond syria . 
  alcopop used to be big among the younger generation . 
  i do n't know if that 's still the case . 
  older generation prefers vodka or other distilled liquor if they feel sophisticated . 
  you do n't get drunk in a cafe without a good reason , you do it at home or in the courtyard under someone 's window . 
  you ca n't drink without a toast and you must take at least a sip after a toast . 
  what else ? 
  do n't ever decrease abv during the drinking session ( i.e. , do n't wash your shot down with beer ) . 
  you do n't gulp your shot in one ... shot and slam your glass down like you 're some kind of hero . 
  getting shitfaced is not the purpose of drinking , pseudointellectual incoherent banter is . 
  what about aperitivi ? 
  that 's drinking culture to me . 
  it was exactly like these jokes . 
  can a snake break its spine ? 
  yes , if it tries to follow the general line of the party . 
  we still have the same joke because nanotech was our leadership 's fad for a while . 
  `` russian nanomachines are the biggest in the world '', 
  serbia 's a little brother looking up at russia , that 's not the same thing . 
  there 's no one who treats us as equals . 
  our closest rival is poland , the only other relevant slavic country . 
  our worst enemy is ourselves . 
  i wonder if hasbro has a monopoly on monopoly ? 
  it 's so lonely at the top :( there 's no nation big enough and similar enough to be a `` brotherly nation '' , `` little brothers '' are n't the same thing . 
  it 's a bit to the north of the main range , being a volcano and all that . 
   my favoutire political site is ran by two ukrainian russians pim ? 
  nope , you can wear a bikini around other women if you want , because even if you 're seduced by a muslim lesbian , that 's actually hot . 
  this is the only mosque where you can pray without a hijab on since the imam is a woman as well . 
  it 's probably the only way a woman can become an imam , male muslims are very unlikely to listen to a woman imam . 
   mischa maisky i did n't know he was from latvia . 
  have n't they killed all the jews back in the 40s ? 
  sviridov 's * time , forward * should be our anthem . 
  his * winter road * is one of my favourite tune ( and i have never played mgs ) .

  chechnya 's the safest place in russia ? 
  i wonder what its totally inconspicuous suicide rate is .

  do people bathe together twice a year in baden-baden ? 
  i sometimes ponder moving to sark because of the skies over moscow looking like that . 
  or whatever the word `` high '' is in romanian . 
  it 's also big enough , but not too big . 
  if `` posh '' means `` old money '' we either shot them or they emigrated to paris and harbin . 
  old moscow accent , spoken on the stage of malyj theatre , is the classiest accent , but no one speaks like that in real life . 
  do they have a town named cetatea alta ? 
  stars ? 
  that 's mean . 
  give them stars and crescents , at least . 
   powder cake powder keg ? 
  big noses and big chins . 
  is there a letter for `` t '' that sounds like uncorking a bottle ? 
  and mohammedans .
