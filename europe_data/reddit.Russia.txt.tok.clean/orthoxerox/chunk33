  kalashnikov is not a russian rifle . 
  it was designed by an ethnic russian for the soviet union . 
  even aks produced in the su were n't assembled exclusively by russians . 
  soviets were n't just russian . 
  most of them were russian , since russia was the biggest country in the su , but stalin was n't , beria was n't , dzerzhinsky was n't , mikoyan was n't , chernyakhovsky likely was n't either . 
  those chechens who came back as decorated veterans to their emptied villages and had to follow their families to flat and dry kazakhstan were soviets as well . 
  step 1 : put a human on mars step 2 : put a living human on mars step 3 : put a living human on mars and return to earth step 4 : put a living human on mars and return to earth with the human step 5 : put a living human on mars and return to earth with the human still alive, 
  * sigh * russia must apologize for the soviet crimes because we 're the legal successor of the ussr , inheriting both its perks and its bloody past , but i strongly object to calling soviet crimes russian crimes .

  some are dead . 
  some have n't been empires for so long they 're no longer butthurt . 
  i do n't know if portugal is still butthurt , maybe just about goa ? 
  now that 's a good candidate . 
  no , this empire is gone . 
  italian state does n't consider itself a legal successor of the roman empire , or does it ? 
  i think ukraine should be renamed \u039b\u03b5\u03bc\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 to match \u039b\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 better .
