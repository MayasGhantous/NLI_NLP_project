   even several czars had a big chunk of german blood in them most of them were ethnically german , since their mothers were german or in one case danish . 
  feels weird to say our legislation regarding surrogate birth is one of if not the most liberal in europe .

  it 's -18 here in moscow , and both me and my son are ill , so we 're wasting our ten-day-long ny holidays .

  putin 's not a very good speaker . 
  he 's mostly known for his rehearsed or spontaneous outbursts of emotion ( stuff like `` if we catch them with their pants down , then we 'll waste'em right there on the crapper '' and `` come to our muslim republics , they 'll circumcise you so well nothing will be left '' ) . 
  his annual press conferences are bland and boring , he likes to answer the questions with lots of tangenitally related figures . 
  the traditional big four are , in no particular order : * hermitage ( st. pete , western art ) * pushkin museum ( moscow , western art ) * tretyakov gallery ( moscow , russian art ) * russian museum ( st. pete , russian art , obviously ) i personaly like the orient museum ( moscow , eastern art and crafts ) and the state historical museum ( that burgundy building next to the kremlin ) .

   disney 's aesthetic is probably what children imagine now for places `` once upon a time '' . 
  is that true even for french fairy tales ? 
  stories that are set in vaguely russian lands look like [ ivan bilibin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivan_bilibin ) imagined them .

  the difference is , circassians were given a choice between resettling on the plains next to their mountains or leaving the empire , while chechens and ingushes were forcibly deported to asia , no questions asked . 
  are belgian policemen all plainclothes or how else did they two manage to work in a police station ? 
   according to an article in la derni\u00e8re heure , a local newspaper , the orgy occurred sometime between nov. 21 -- when the federal government 's crisis center raised the alert level for the brussels region to 4 , the highest -- and nov. 26 , when the alert level was reduced to 3 . 
   about 20 soldiers from a light infantry unit known as the bataillon de chasseurs ardennais were bivouacked at a police station in ganshoren , a neighborhood north of molenbeek . 
  according to the newspaper , after the police station closed for the night at 10 p.m. , two policewomen were invited upstairs to the floor where the soldiers were sleeping and had sex with eight of them .

   it 's when they try and stop you actively through violence that is a problem or when they say that violence is a solution , or when they say they would n't object if someone would try and use violence to resolve the problem .

  at the beginning of the first session of a freshly elected ukrainian parliament the speaker does n't know which fraction should be allowed to make the first speech . 
  `` western ukrainian nationalists will start rambling about getting rid of russians , eastern ukrainian nationalists will start blaming jews , perhaps i 'll let the greens speak first . '', 
  a representative of the green party accepts the invitation and starts his speech : `` my friends , my brother and sisters !, 
  what have we done to our beloved country ? 
  the rivers are drying up , the trees are being destroyed by wildfires !, 
  how will we drown kikes and hang moscals if we let this continue ?! '',

  it 's in the middle of nowhere . 
  there 's like one road that goes there and an airport . 
  what about taking in two million of them ? 
  yes , yes it did . 
  seven millions is a liberal estimate . 
  that was ukraine , we were originally talking about dead russians . 
  7 million is the total death toll for the whole ussr , it 's actually one of the highest estimates . 
  i do not try to deny the incredible suffering inflicted by ussr on russians , ukrainians and other people of the union . 
  i just do not think it 's wise to overestimate the casualties to numbers like tens of millions , since that weakens the original argument . 
  tens of millions ? 
  hitler had camps that were literally designed to kill people round the clock , and he managee to kill eleven million . 
  gulags were built to work people to death , but even with insane turnover rate you ca n't get to twenty million direct deaths and by direct i am not talking about military casualties or reduced fertility rate , just people starved to death , executed or sent to die in work camps . 
  no , it added only baltics , parts of poland and germany .

  moscow . 
  the metro . 
  it might be overcrowded at times and it gets hot in the summer , but the trains run like clockwork . 
  the problem : european capitals are overcrowded . 
  your proposed solution : build even more houses , so they become even more overcrowded . 
  it 's other cities and towns that should be made more attractive to people , not the capitals . 
  business should be incentivised to move not just factories , but their offices to other cities as well . 
  developers 've been building more and more high-rise apartments around moscow , and the roads and railways are chock full of commuters , because there 's no employment opportunities within like 300 km that can compare to moscow .
