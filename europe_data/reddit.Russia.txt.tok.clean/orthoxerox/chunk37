  the greeks are so mad they ca n't even reply . 
  chuck-chuck and what 's the other thing ? 
  i recommended the russian wikipedia since it would be the most biased in the `` tragic mistake , crop failure '' direction . 
  you can go to * russian * wikipedia and read the sources mentioned there . 
  or you can go to / r/askhistorians and search for existing posts on that topic . 
   the person who killed him was obviously a kurd . 
  i think some official has actually said that . 
  i am not trying to deny that , i deny that outright . 
  unlike the polish operation for example , the famine was n't specifically aimed at ukrainians . 
  it was n't a crop failure , it was a punishment for trying to avoid the grain tax by planting less . 
  human errors ? 
  not really . 
  * freeholders use economy to their advantage and sell the grain at high price * soviet government needs cheap grain to sell it abroad and buy machinery * soviet government increases the grain tax on freeholders to get free grain * freeholders plant just enough grain to see them through the year to avoid paying the tax * soviet government does n't like tax evasion and confiscates the grain * freeholders are left without grain and starve * ukraine has a high percentage of freeholders in all its regions and is hit hard the biggest human error was the decision to fuck with soviet inland revenue . 
  ** russia ** any guest must be offered food . 
  if they brought something edible with them , then they * must * be offered food . 
  the biscuits will join the rest of the food on the table and will be freely shared with everyone . 
  story time : my godmother married a dutchman . 
  when she first met her future mother in law she brought her a nice box of russian biscuits as a present . 
  the mil thanked her and put them away . 
  after some time they finally sat down for a cup of tea and my gm was offered literally a cup of tea . 
  she thought her mil forgot they had the biscuits and reminded her about them . 
  the mil asked if my gm wanted a biscuit and fetched her ... one . 
  needless to say , she did n't feel welcome in the house until she learned the dutch had different ideas about what hospitality was . 
  and in russian as well !, 
  among the larger russian cities tolyatti/togliatti is probably the poorest . 
  it was built around the car factory that makes ladas and like 95 % of the locals depend on it directly or indirectly . 
  if you want to sample what russian cities look like , [ this site ] ( http://varlamov.ru/tag/\u041f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0439-\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439 ) has the best parts ( \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439 ) and the worst parts ( \u041f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0439 ) shown for many of them . 
  wow , just like [ kopanki ] ( http://www.tema.ru/travel/ukretnoexp-6/ ) in donbass . 
  yeah , and the man who killed hitler does n't get credit for that either . 
  this is the thread of the day , good job !, 
   constantinople tsargrad, 
  yes , a marine from sevastopol was killed when the helicopter was shot with a tow . 
  one of them is reportedly alive and away from danger . 
  i 'll see if i can find any updates . 
  we do n't . 
  we 'll have to wait for another independent confirmation . 
  does he have any relatives that can fit into the trunk of a car ? 
   the navigator of the downed su-24 is on the russian military base in latakia , said sergey shoigu , the minister of defense . 
  according to him , the navigator is `` alive and well '' . 
   the extraction operation completed at 3:40 am moscow time . 
  `` i would like to thank our guys who have spent the night risking their lives , '' added the minister . 
  any data on how much of it is man-on-man rape ? 
  do you have any data to back this up ? 
   following the loss of a sukhoi su-24 attack aircraft , moscow has ordered a series of additional measures to strengthen its defenses in syria . 
  notably , the `` mosvka '' battle cruiser will begin sentry duty along the coast of latakia , where russia operates an airbase . 
   russia has also announced the suspension of all military contacts with turkey . 
   `` we warn that any targets presenting any potential danger to us will be destroyed , '' a representative of russia 's general staff said . 
  where have i said that men were rapists ? 
  women can be rapists as well , this is admittedly more rare , though . 
  i am in moscow , not in syria . 
  i would worry for my safety if i were a syrian turkmen living in nw syria . 
  shooting an airplane pilot suspended under a parachute and not shooting at you is a war crime . 
  dropping large dumb bombs at combatants and hitting others as well technically is n't . 
  while i did n't like his blog post , the reaction to it from the student body is vile and horrible . 
  i doubt they have read what he had written , they are most likely following the commands of their leaders . 
  `` looking like a rapist '' is a stupid phrase . 
  rapists look like people . 
  lots of guys still think that the girl owes you sex if you spend your time and money on her . 
  or that if a drunk girl you 've just met is literally humping your leg it 's fine to take things further . 
  or that it 's fine to do what deckard did in * blade runner * . 
  our books and movies are full of behavior that violates what we now consider the rules of consent , so it is good to teach the difference or to debate the blurred lines in a ** mutually respectful atmosphere ** . 
  what 's an actual rape ? 
  does the rapist have to wear a mask like hamburglar ? 
  does the victim have to shout and cry for help if the rape is n't happening out in the country ? 
  yeah , i 've checked again and turns out we have n't returned it . 
  we probably should 've , it would be another drain on your budget . 
  we 're cooking chili con carne this week !, 
  however , it will be chili sin chili , since my son will have to eat it well . 
  just bell peppers and tomatoes instead . 
  no potato ? 
  bulgarians use - ov and - ev as well , while various yugoslavs use - ic ( would be - icz in polish ) . 
  have n't we given it back because it was as seaworthy as a bathtub ? 
   still amazed that ussr managed to dissolve relatively peacefully . 
  have n't you heard about sumgait and the rest of the massacres in azerbaijan and armenia ? 
  his wife 's maiden name was zeldaite . 
  canadian ice hockey ( as opposed to russian ice hockey , or bandy ) . 
  i wonder if dagestani truckers will be declared isis supporters in nine o'clock news . 
  the `` truck tax '' was introduced because russian railways have been mismanaged so badly it was more profitable to ship cargo across the country by truck . 
  to help them become more competetive a new charge was levied on the truckers . 
  as a bonus , the son of putin 's friend gets his nice cut . 
  i do n't like rferl , but there was no better source in english . 
  my favourite part :  meanwhile , state duma deputy yevgeny fyodorov , a member of putin 's ruling united russia party , released a november 20 video in which he accused the protesting truck drivers of being manipulated by `` national traitors '' and a `` fifth column '' working for the united states . 
  this idiot [ voted ] ( http://naganoff.livejournal.com/161652.html ) for that bill * himself * . 
  well , the original proposal was to declare the annexation of crimea an act of war . 
  i think we can agree it 's not the best idea . 
  do you expect me to know them ? 
  i do n't know if they were russian officers , russian soldiers , or russian-sponsored insurgents , but i would call it it terrible mistake . 
  i doubt they wanted to shoot down a dutch airliner . 
  of course i do . 
  that 's why poroshenko turns green every time he meets putin in person . 
  it 's still terrorism . 
  when ira planted bombs in railway stations , they notified the police to avoid deaths , but that was still terrorism . 
  blowing up policemen or soldiers with ied is not terrorism , on the other hand . 
  directly attacking lives or livelihood of civilians is . 
  glorious partisans resorted to terrorism as well , torching collaborators alive in their homes . 
  sure , why not declare a war against russia ? 
  yes , we have signed an agreement with ukraine . 
  and non-state actors are now destroying the livelihood of the civil population to influence the state through them . 
  that 's terrorism . 
  and encounter a deadly robot made of blades on a planet colonized by bohemians .
