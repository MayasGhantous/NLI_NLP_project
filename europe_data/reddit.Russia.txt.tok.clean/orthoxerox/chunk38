  can this be called terrorism ? 
  i do n't see why not . 
  berlin is like a black hole that has destroyed brandenburg . 
  a guy from latvia i know says \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e when you should say \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434 meaning `` ago '' . 
  what do * you * call a shop in ukrainian ? 
  it 's * generally * true . 
  russian urbanisation happened during soviet times , and this meant very high horizontal mobility . 
  you did n't end up in a town next to your village , you ended up in a new city halfway across the country . 
  this erased accents very well . 
  you can still find people with strong regional accents , like [ this one from ne central russia ] ( http://youtube.com/watch?v=sigsgj2q2e0 ) , but that 's unusual , you have to look for norms . 
  another exception is the southern fricative g. it 's not quite a ukrainian g , but it 's closer to it than to the normative one . 
  old moscow russian and st. pete russian sound a bit pretentious . 
   sound like pretentious toffs . 
  `` what ho , srinivasam , what ho ! '', 
  people 's democratic republic of free europe, 
  will there be v\u0101cietis in it ? 
  i am getting `` the last airbender '' vibes from it for some reason , despite not having seen either cartoon . 
  i am getting `` the last airbender '' vibes from it for some reason , despite not having seen either cartoon . 
  those g20 leaders are real pussy magnets . 
  yeah , i 'd rather they used suicide ropes or suicide car exhaust . 
   hsh hiljaa sounds like the battle cry of the red angry bird . 
  she would n't look out of place in / r/hardboltons, 
  but why include \u0446 and \u0447 ? 
  would n't they both be pronounced like / ts / by a finn ? 
  i know finnish has words with / ts / in them , like `` sweden '' . 
  so there 's neither [ final-obstruent devoicing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/final-obstruent_devoicing ) nor [ vowel reduction ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vowel_reduction ) in serbian ? 
  interesting . 
  seven ? 
  we have / s / , / s ^ j / , / \u0282 / and / \u0255 / . 
  you have to add all / z / - like sounds if you want to get to seven . 
  although all the jokes that go `` finnish man ko to paar and look mopile phone '' make me think there 's no distinction between voiced and voiceless consonants in finnish . 
  so `` beograd '' does n't sound like `` beograt '' and `` kosovo '' does n't sound like `` kosavo '' at all ? 
  and the * das messer * falls on you , and that 's * das ende * . 
  the rules are fine , it 's the exceptions that kill you . 
   the closest an anglophone can get is with the obscure northern european language called frisian they forgot about scots . 
  they should switch to krokodil , it 's much cheaper . 
  or are cough pills a prescription only medicine in serbia ? 
  the diomedes ? 
  russia 's got you covered there as well . 
  we have n't done any tests there in a long time . 
  and many more . 
  it 's probably the second most irradiated place in europe . 
  package tours to turkey and egypt , or to sochi/crimea if your company has a hotel there ( otherwise the price/quality ratio is too low ) , or maybe renting a room from a local resident . 
  bus tours across europe ( you take a train to brest first ) . 
  or just spend your vacation on your dacha because you ca n't afford anything else . 
  that 's what 90 % of european russians do . 
  replace all foreign countries with china for asian russians . 
  you pay your bank , not visa . 
  visa just handles interbank transactions . 
   `` if he even suggests i should kneel in front of him , i will eviscerate him with the very same sword . '', 
  overcompensating for something . 
  there 's `` fa\u00e7ade '' as well , which is * not * pronounced `` fuck aide '' . 
  such last names are rather uncommon in russia . 
  * polyakov is kinda common , and might mean `` polish '' * kazakov is obviously a `` cossack '' * litvinov means `` belorussian '' * cherkasov means `` ukrainian '', 
  well , at least you literally know it \u043a\u0430\u043a '' \u041e\u0442\u0447\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0448 '' . 
  we have n't invaded any new ones , so you can say we 've stopped * invading * . 
  we 've switched to middle eastern ones , thank you very much . 
  more holdings per province , higher tech and you can holy war them without fabricating claims . 
  nah , you should vote us into nato for the lulz . 
  we 'll even man the military bases all the way to rhein for you . 
  so what reloading actions for shotguns are legal ? 
  break action and lever action ? 
  are kashubians considered ethnic poles or pomeranians ? 
  let 's say you have an idea what at ethnic group is . 
  and then we have a subset of people who belong to these group , but are sufficiently different in one of the aspects and who have managed to preserve their semi-separate identity despite living in the same nation . 
  everyone knows about cossacks , and i decided to skip mixed groups like kamchadals and `` entundred peasants '' . 
  russia 's so big we have many such groups . 
  ** pomors ** pomors are the descendants of the first russians who colonised the shores of white and barents seas . 
  because the land could n't support mass settlement , they were left along for a long time and they could n't assimilate local finnic populace completely . 
  they are much more sea-oriented than average russians and have a more self-sufficient and independent culture . 
  ** chaldons ** no one quite knows who chaldons are . 
  they live in western siberia , look more or less slavic , speak russian , but locals know there are regular russians and there are `` yellowbellies '' , there even used to be separate villages in the past . 
  one theory says they 're russians whose ancestors had arrived in siberia well before ivan the terrible annexed the siberian khanate . 
  ** various groups of the steppe frontier ** the lands that are now on our border with central and eastern ukraine used to be a vast no man 's land between the relatively safe principalities of moscow and friends and the steppes of the golden horde . 
  there are multiple groups that live or lived there . 
  some are probably autochthonous , like * ~ ~ super ~ ~ sayans * , whose ancestors gradually pushed the cumans out , but were stranded there when the mongols came . 
  some , like ** tsukans ** , are the descendants of northern serfs . 
  some like * odnodvortsy * , or `` single householders '' , were yeomen who were sent there to settle the newly reclaimed frontier and protect it from the tatars . 
  most of these groups have all but disappeared in the 20th century after collectivisation and urbanisation . 
  ** old believers ** there are multiple small groups of old believers who have first tried to settle in the swampy lands of upper dnieper or the forests beyond middle volga , but were deported to siberia by the emperors/empresses . 
  they now live in the altay mountains and transbaikalia and comprise such groups as ** kerzhaks ** , ** semeyskie ** ( familials ) and ** kamenshchiki ** ( stony river settlers ) . 
  like all old believers , they shun reformed believers , or `` nikonians '' ( they have separate utensils for infidel visitors ) , avoid vodka and are much more industrious than average russians . 
  for that they have suffered greatly during collectivisation , but villages of old believers survive even now . 
  if you take a look at these cossacks ( i think they are kuban cossacks ) , you 'll see a mix of ukrainian and caucasian moves . 
  because they will have to pay the people back for all the cancelled tours . 
  they ca n't exactly tell people `` go ask putin for your money back '' . 
  even if they 'll pay a percentage of the original price , it will destroy their cash flow . 
  our tourism industry is gon na crash and burn . 
  i checked the handwriting exercise book for primary schools . 
  have you been to the mertvovod canyon ? 
  most of russia is hard to reach . 
  [ pupu ner pillars ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikdjffnr8ga ) are a good example . 
  kamchatka trails are beatiful as well , but getting there is oh so expensive . 
  broad-nibbed pens demand special calligraphy . 
  same here . 
  just checked , and it 's the `` official way '' of writing an 8 in russia . 
  refreshing the tree of liberty . 
  glass is american . 
  your national parks are awesome . 
  it is a small , slippery and overheated tourist trap .
