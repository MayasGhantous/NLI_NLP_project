  if it 's pink , it surely has all kinds of microbes inside . 
  - flip-flops . 
  every single villager is wearing them if it 's not too wet . 
  why anyone would wear them in moscow is beyond my understanding , but i see them every day . 
  - putin . 
  - gadgets they can not really afford . 
  you * must * have the newest iphone . 
  - cars they can not really afford . 
  but with the cheapest trim to save money . 
  - germany . 
  everyone loves how well everything is run there , no one lifts a finger to catch up to them . 
  - package tours to all-inclusive hotels . 
  what do you mean no one drinks whisky in the morning ? 
  - making kebabs en plein air . 
  no women allowed near the grill . 
  they can go chop up some salad or something . 
  - shanson music ( gangsta pop ) . 
  midi music played on sound blaster 16 and lyrics about how you are repressed by the man , how unfaithful your woman is and how you love your old mother . 
  what about those living next to gibraltar ? 
  ukraine , probably . 
  but every time i 've been there they 've tried to fleece me harder than arabs and with none of the finesse . 
  the most relaxing country i 've been to was austria . 
  too hot and too slippery . 
  i just wanted to know if there was a single term for native catalans and all people living in catalonia . 
  but what if i am irish , a spanish citizen and i live in barcelona ? 
  am i catalan ? 
   attention to detail and poop jokes the unofficial motto of germany . 
  bodensee is a very nice place , if you avoid friedrichshafen ( blame raf for that ) . 
  mainau is great if you love roses , konstanz is very old and very nice , lindau is recognisably bavarian ( the only town on the lake where i saw plaques with fart joke ) , you can visit three other countries while you 're there . 
  avoid dresden ( blame raf and helpful soviet builders ) . 
  catalans should ask russia for help . 
  we have some extremely relevant experience . 
  ah , the magnificent schwebebahn . 
  useless knowledge : most russians think it is called neuschweinstein or neunschweinstein . 
  not so many , sadly . 
  native russian , fluent-ish english , intermediate german . 
  i can understand ukrainian , but that depends on how un-russian the specific dialect is . 
  they 're like english and scots , in my opinion . 
  and its leader should be called doctor . 
  a cat is fine too , as they used to say . 
  4k euro is quite enough for a family of three , i think it could support a well-off family of four as well . 
  i guess most russians would call me a decadent muscovite if they read this . 
  novgorod is less popular for some reason . 
  i did n't know croatia had any hinterlands , is n't it too narrow for them ? 
  that 's what a one-room apartment costs , is n't it ? 
  i do n't rent ( thank god ) , but 80m2 costs up to 2k euro per month . 
  because i like vienna . 
  i 've checked karriere.at , and a senior technical position pays around 3-4k euro . 
  this is 150-200k roubles . 
  200k sounds a bit high , but 150k is easy to get if you 're good , and 200k is also achievable if you 're really good and are willing to shop around . 
  back in pre-crimea times that would be equal to 120-160k . 
  i 've met many mixed heritage people from kazakhstan . 
  many americans find [ kholodets ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aspic ) weird . 
  i am not sure if there 's something more russian that many find disgusting . 
  and since we 're taking over ukraine , [ salo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salo ) . 
  i know italians have lardo , and it 's really good , but they 're probably the only ones outside the slavic world who like it . 
  some food has completely disappeared from the shelves ( like venosta cornflakes or jarlsberg cheese ) , some appears sporadically . 
  nothing critical so far , but it 's annoying . 
  my salary is getting less and less attractive compared to the european ones , i now earn as much as i would in a similar position in vienna , except the income tax here is lower and i do n't have to rent . 
  if the rate falls to 60 roubles for 1 euro , it will make sense to emigrate . 
  do n't worry , ~ ~ if ~ ~ when we annex poland the question will be moot . 
  shots refilled . 
  there 's a moratorium on harvesting caspian caviar anyway . 
  shots fired . 
  have you ever worked as an animator in a three-star all inclusive hotel ? 
  transnistria , it 's like a soviet-themed living museum . 
  owned by sherif , the local ~ ~ mafia ~ ~ business conglomerate . 
  lavrov-steinmeier pact . 
  did you correct his german or his english ? 
  we understand your discomfort : /, 
  unless you use client-side encryption . 
  then you get flagged by every single agency who the proceed to hack your machine . 
  even the country is shaped like a bull 's head . 
  yeah . 
  yeah , malusha sound like a perfectly slavic name to me . 
  you could have a guy named mal and a gal named malusha . 
  what about false dmitry ? 
  gorbachev is not a historical figure yet . 
  despite our combined efforts as humanity , there 's still so much beauty left in the world , even in densely populated europe . 
  it makes me happy . 
  latvia and estonia have been under russian control longer than they 've been independent . 
  they were ~ 20 years old when they were forcibly reintegrated . 
  i have seen conflicting reports on the proportion of locals among the insurgents . 
  that 's not a guerilla war yet , since the rebels are holding some territory . 
  when they take off their uniforms , let ukrainian army into donetsk and switch from mlrs to ieds , then it 's a guerilla war . 
  less social security than in austria . 
  mount elbrus is disappointed . 
  poor unloved finns , estonians , hungarians , turks , basques and maltese . 
  utah is nice , but it 's full of mormons . 
  california is nice , but expensive . 
  oregon/washington are nice , but austria is nicer . 
  i guess sarcasm detector should n't be used in a marshrutka , vibration throws it out of alignment . 
  let 's avoid putting well-intentioned extremists in charge . 
  indian summer - women 's summer , \u0431\u0430\u0431\u044c\u0435 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e milky way - milky way , \u043c\u043b\u0435\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u044c ( nb we use the church slavonic word for milk here ) sunshower - mushroom rain , \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0436\u0434\u044c ( warm and wet , good for mushrooms ) heavy rain - it 's pouring as if from a bucket , \u043b\u044c\u0451\u0442 , \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0438\u0437 \u0432\u0435\u0434\u0440\u0430 i do n't think we have anything special for other phenomena and we use roman months names . 
  oh , and we use a weird word for good clear weather , \u0432\u0451\u0434\u0440\u043e , i have no idea where it comes from . 
  upd : apparently it comes from the same pie word as weather/wetter . 
  fascinating . 
  some additional lines could include : * vilnius - minsk - kiev - odessa/chisinau - constanta * warsaw - minsk - smolensk - moscow * krakow - lviv - kiev - dnepropetrovsk - donetsk - rnd - krasnodar * there 's a high-ish speed railway helsinki - st. pete - moscow - nizhny novgorod already . 
  yep , just like spa . 
  i do n't like gruyere , to be honest .
