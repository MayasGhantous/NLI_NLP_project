  if less than two thirds of syrian population are combatants , the mission will be a success . 
  he 's the david hasselhof of china . 
  they * are * museum exhibits , like sorbs are in germany . 
  but back to the topic . 
  the ngo funding law is heavy-handed and fsb is treating all , however miniscule , potential sources of separatism with extreme suspicion . 
  however , the assimilation has been going on for literally hundreds of years , and urbanisation has only accelerated the process . 
  you ca n't solely blame the recent policies for it . 
  i have a cup and a teaspoon at home , and my son destroyed my measuring cup . 
  that 's a lot like my favourite recipe for making pickled garlic : walk to the underpass , find a gold-toothed fat woman selling pickles and buy it from her . 
  my balcony is full of fucking apples because my mil refuses to throw them away ; however , she 's unable to process them all . 
  ** sharlotka , or charlotte russe a la russe ** a quick and easy apple pie . 
  ** ingredients ** * a cup of flour * a cup of sugar * 4 eggs * 4 cooking apples * 1 tsp baking powder * cinnamon * a sachet of vanilla sugar , more if your apples are real tart * some butter ** steps ** * peel , core and dice your apples , mix with vanilla sugar * beat eggs and sugar with an electric mixer , gradually add flour and baking powder * grease up a pie pan large enough to spread your apples all over its surface * spread your apples all over its surface and sprinkle with cinnamon * pour the batter all over the apples * bake at 180 for about 30 minutes , until it 's beige and does n't stick to a toothpick, 
  what do you mean ? 
  that 's not a joke . 
  i 've been there and there 's no bielefeld . 
  euro . 
  option 3 is poroshenko being pressured by merkel , hollande and the creditors to resolve the crisis , trying to push the autonomy bill through the parliament and then either : * 3a locking antlers with the parliament and plunging ukraine into another political crisis ; * 3b declawing the bill to satisfy the parliament , this leads to d/lnr saying that ukraine is not abiding by the terms of minsk-2 and reigniting the conflict . 
   some equipment was stolen and moved to russia your example is an interview with the factory owner who evacuated his factory to russia . 
  either he 's a liar and you need to post a different link , or you are twisting the facts yourself . 
  well , eastern european goods were in high demand ( i had romanian pyjamas and czech milk bottles ) , so they knew people had better things even in the second world . 
  however , most people had no idea what life was like in the first world countries , stuff like 20 brands of salami in stock in a regular supermarket was crazy . 
  my grandpa had to travel to the unified germany ( he took part in the army withdrawal ) and every time he brought back a bag full of food and drinks , stuff like salami and canned ham and fizzy drinks and salty snacks . 
  most people only saw foreign nature and culture in the `` cinematravellers ' club '' on tv . 
  do n't you know how to wipe your ass with a tram ticket ? 
  i was too young when the union collapsed , but i can speak of my parents ' and grandparents ' experience . 
  for those born in the 50s or later the positive aspect was relative safety of your life choices . 
  you would have a roof above your head and food on the table with predictable milestones no matter what career path you picked , as long as you did no stupid stuff . 
  consumer goods were a problem . 
  their production was regulated by central planning , so if you take into account planning errors , cheating with production quotas and distribution inefficiency , they were almost constantly underproduced . 
  perishables were of inferior quality to meet the quotas , while long-term use goods were built to last ( they would often need zero-day maintenance , but when rebuilt , would work like aks ) . 
  people working in retail inflated this scarcity into a full-blown crisis to line their pockets and collect favors , or * blat * . 
  if you were a service provider , like a teacher , a doctor , a hairdresser or a cop , you could get stuff via * blat * by prioritizing the right people . 
  life in the country sucked donkey balls . 
  my grandpa was a kid during the war and grew up in evacuation . 
  when he came back to the collective farm he immediately enlisted , even though it was a special farm . 
  in the army he visited a military academy and when he saw they had oil in their porridge and feathers in their pillows instead of straw , he decided to become an officer . 
  people in collective farms ( it depends on the type of farm , though ) would often get no money for their work . 
  they would earn effort-days and be allocated some calculated amount of produce for them . 
  to get actual money they would work their personal lots after working the shared lots the whole day . 
  personal farming was often restricted in one way or another . 
   yoga master convinced three female concillors from prague 8 municipal district that he knows how to clean up one 's body and mind and how to rejuvenate glands producing hormones was his name tom morley ? 
  french gardens are strictly geometric , with straight paths and fountains or statues at intersections . 
  russian bullets ? 
  are people who designed and built the ddr-brd border still alive ? 
  might be a good time to pay them a visit like to paul redeker in * world war z * . 
  at last some practical math !, 
  that 's weird , it asks you to show how to reach the result , not to find it yourself . 
  but who owns all these houses you rent ? 
  are there special companies that rent out real estate ? 
  or are there germans who privately own like 10 houses and rent out 9 ? 
  there has been no part a in the maths exam for several years . 
  we have a b-part and a c-part in our maths exam . 
  this probably belongs to the harder end of the b-part , with c-part being harder still . 
  they 're too slow to run away from grenades . 
  reminds me of squirrel institute of wounds . 
  thanks for reminding me . 
  there 's no such country . 
  russia may not be the best country in the world or have the best leadership right now , but it 's still my country , so please do not use such disphemisms to refer to it , i 'll use them myself when appropriate . 
  do n't worry about me , i am from moscow , not russia proper . 
  poor vladimir had to let go of his multiple wives and concubines , though ( some european chronicle characterised him as a * fornicator maximus * ) . 
  wine , women and song .

  [ \u0416\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0435 / zharkoye ] ( http://www.russianfood.com/recipes/bytype/?fid=563 ), 
  romanian parliament building is absolutely humongous . 
  annexation of zaporozhets cars has been recognized by every country except russia . 
  we still want to give them back . 
  french ladies are rumoured to let their hair grow instead of shaving it . 
  1989 was three years after chernobyl , there was a spike in birth defects so they were on people 's minds . 
  should n't it be called `` forum open '' , just like all other stickies ? 
  melted cheese is hard to digest . 
  collective responsibility is completely justified , most of our high-ranking officials ( and low-ranking too ) use their close relatives to siphon off government funds . 
  yakunin 's son , for example , has been given land belonging to russian railways to build hotels there . 
  i 'd rather the eu tightened that grip than putin . 
  do n't give even visas to their wifes , children and siblings , residence permits and citizenhip must be out of the question . 
  there 's more than enough trees in europe , it 's just that most of them are in russia . 
  what about those tudor-style ( ? ), 
  half-timbered houses . 
  russian style wooden houses are common here as single-family or semi-detached dwellings . 
  brick is a much more expensive option . 
  aerated concrete is growing in popularity . 
  i 've thought it was `` zakhid '' . 
  edit : oh , you meant `` collapse '', 
  they rode them like major kong and tamed them like wild broncos . 
  svetlana alexievich , the new nobel laureate . 
  unlike lots of them recently , she 's actually a good author , her books are a great , though emotionally heavy , read . 
  elections first , border control only after that . 
  is it ? 
  she writes in russian and her books are great . 
  this is a well-deserved reward . 
  i did n't even know we had so many rather modern ships in caspian sea . 
  they are all less than 5 years old . 
  ambassador : `` oh , come on , it 's not our fault you share a border with syria instead of kurdistan '' . 
  i personally like to add some cilantro/coriander leaves , but it turns out some people are genetically deficient and it tastes like soap to them . 
  garlic and parsley go well with chicken , it becomes a much more lightweight dish . 
  `` do you play basketball * giggle * ? '', 
  ** kotlety . 
  ** a relatively modern traditional russian dish , a staple of all soviet-style catering . 
  i wo n't be able to give you precise relationships between the ingredients since every homemaker has their own recipe . 
  ** what you 'll need : ** * some meat ( usually beef , but you can substitute any other or mix beef with pork ) * some white bread with a crust , not some shitty wonderbread ( half as much as meat ) * enough milk * raw onion ( half as much as bread ) * one or two eggs * salt , pepper , vegetable oil * a mincer * a pot * a frying pan with a lid * a soup dish ** preparation : ** * place the bread in the soup dish and pour milk until it 's completely drenched throughout . 
  * mince the meat , the bread and the onions , combine them in the pot .
