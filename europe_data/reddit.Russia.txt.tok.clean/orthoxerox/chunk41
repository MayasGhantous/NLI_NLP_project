  * add the eggs , season and mix well * use your wet hands to form the mixture into computer mouse sized patties ( maybe a bit smaller ) * fry them in batches on a hot frying pan in vegetable oil . 
  * when you run out of patties , dump them all back into the pan , reduce the heat , close the lid and let them cook for ten more minutes . 
  ** optional varieties : ** * roll the patties in breadcrumbs before frying them . 
  * when preparing the patties put a pickle or some fried mushrooms inside . 
  humans - officially more dangerous than nuclear irradiation . 
  harvest season is practically over here in russia , all our harvest celebrations happen in august . 
  the final one was mary 's birthday , 21st of september , the end of all harvest-related field activities . 
  pokrov will happen on 14th of october , this was traditionally the start of indoor leisure time . 
  even riga ? 
  i 've always found numbers and other thematic names kinda hard to remember unless you know there 's a theme in advance . 
  `` oh , they said their house was on the intersection of some tree street and ... the second or the third , ca n't recall '' `` do n't worry , we 'll find it soon enough '' alder , birch , cedar , dogwood , elm , fir , gumtree , huckleberry , ironwood , juniper ... 
   lime tree was going to correct you , turns out they are actually called lime trees in english . 
  til . 
  and - cz , perhaps even more so . 
   there could be a practical reason for this ? 
  and it 's called syria . 
  who are the finno-ugric minorities in central ukraine ? 
  that 's the palm of a hand . 
  there 's the same situation in russian . 
  '' \u0420\u0443\u043a\u0430 '' means `` arm '' , but contextually means `` hand '' as well , when you shake it or clench it into a fist . 
  '' \u0414\u043b\u0430\u043d\u044c '' is archaic russian , so when you have to talk specifically about a hand as opposed to the whole arm ( `` the car drove over his hand '' ) , you say '' \u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0438 '' , `` armbrush '' . 
  try new guinea too . 
  came here to post this joke , was too slow . 
  perhaps i have some estonian blood ~ ~ on ~ ~ in me ? 
  we can give back lwow in return . 
  i wonder if modern kids know who ellie is , they might 've switched to baum 's originals . 
  i once tried to play , i kid you not , a german mud based on volkov 's series . 
  i lost it as soon as i spawned in the tutorial room . 
  the list of mobs said `` totoschka ist hier . '', 
  and then he started speaking german to me . 
  yep , western armenia was ottoman ( and is still turkish ) , while eastern armenia was persian . 
  on october 1 , 1827 we took yerevan from persia and removed armenia from muslim sphere of influence . 
  you 're probably right , but the most common f1 hybrids are not a secret any more . 
  they do n't allow you to radically transform the way you farm like roundup-ready seeds do either . 
  i would only opt out of proprietary gmos . 
  public domain , mit or gpl-licensed gmos - a-ok . 
  does [ solothurn s-18 / 1000 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solothurn_s-18/1000 ) count as small arms ? 
  or [ ptrs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ptrs-41 ) ? 
  or is [ ksvk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ksvk_12.7 ) the biggest one you can own ? 
  they 're toeing the line because there are russians living everywhere in kazakhstan where there 's more to do than fuck horses . 
  plenty of potenial `` people 's republics '' . 
  of what use are they to russia ? 
  they maneuver between russia and china and will defect to the highest bidder in a heartbeat . 
  last time on * tuesday cooking * i promised to give you a russian salad recipe that involves no mayo . 
  i give you ... ** vinegret ** you 'll need : * a few boiled beets ( start cooking them well in advance , they take a long time to cook through ) * a few boiled carrots * a few boiled potatoes * a few pickled cucumbers ( use brine-pickled cucumbers , not vinegar-pickled ones ) * a medium-sized raw onion * a raw cooking apple , peeled and cored , if you like culinary experiments dice everything into pea-sized cubes and mix . 
  season with sunflower oil and salt . 
  refrigerate and eat . 
  and now for my secret sauce . 
  i 've always wondered why something named vinegret/vinaigrette had no vinegar in it when by jove it should !, 
  i tried adding 1 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar per 4 servings and the salad was greatly improved : the vinegar really tied the tastes of its ingredients together . 
  are you ok with memel , kovno and vilna , then ? 
  so rouge soldier ? 
  i guess it 's india . 
  china is a threat more than it is an ally . 
  serbia considers russia its ally , but i doubt it can help us out much . 
  no one else in europe likes us any more . 
  well , we 're still on good terms with germany , but zey haf to follou ze rules . 
  india , on the other hand , wants lots of military hardware , wants to achieve autarky in key technologies , shares no borders with us , has problems with muslims , resents american domination of world politics . 
  and yuge teeth . 
  these turks look a lot like cossacks with these hairstyles . 
  hey there , google maps . 
  and turkey . 
   lead foreign correspondent i 've read this as least foreign correspondent and started thinking whether you meant white as wonderbrand or certified native american . 
  blue card . 
  how were people dealing with smallpox ? 
  we should have another round of blind wine testing where french experts choose napa valley wines as the best and are then butthurt about it . 
  because some people are too tired to go shopping on saturdays . 
  plus your weekday food will be one day fresher if you buy it on sundays . 
   some restaurants also have different staff working at noon and in the evening on sundays , allowing them half a day off work . 
  same thing as with supermarkets that might be open on sunday morning . 
  why not do the same in the shops ? 
  have one shift work 10-18 and another 14-22 ? 
  the fortress of derbent has been `` restored '' by the local administration and might lose its unesco site status . 
   if swisses leave the alps they lose 50 % attacking power and 75 % of defending power . 
  they do n't if they are hired as mercenaries , as history showed us . 
  really arbitrary balancing , imo . 
  have you though about growing some [ kolomiktas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/actinidia_kolomikta ) as well ? 
  they are close relatives of the kiwifruit . 
  ... but the sales of sugar have gone through the roof ? 
  scientists studying east slavs placed a bench with a sharp nail sticking out of it in moscow , kiev and minsk . 
  a russian sat down on the nail , jumped up , cursed aloud and hammered it flat with a stone . 
  a ukrainian sat down on the nail , jumped up , looked around , took his pliers out of the pocket , pulled the nail out and kept it just in case . 
  a belorussian sat down on the nail , jumped up , looked at it and then carefully sat back down on it , saying `` maybe that 's how it is supposed to be '' . 
  estonians are very reserved , like finns , and wo n't volunteer anything extra in a conversation ( that they 're driving in the opposite direction , for example ) or start one without a pressing need . 
  they also have lots of long and extra long vowels , so we joke thaat theey speeaak sloowly . 
   would you ban the dalai lama 's robes ? 
  patriarch kirill 's folding hat ? 
  when they are `` at work '' they should be allowed to wear religious clothing . 
  not as private individuals . 
  now * that * will create a demand for female matadors . 
  summers were exported to the ussr , says so right in the history book . 
   and ca n't hate it any stronger petro : we have agreed to unilaterally stop the hostilities in ordlo and will join russia in 2017 to reunite ukraine with crimea . 
  our racks have trays that collect dripping water . 
  people that do n't have drying racks are savages contaminating their plates with their filthy towels . 
  under the sink where i live now , next to the sink in a nook in the house where i grew up . 
  yeah , i keep wondering that . 
  well , sicily is not a continent , plus i would n't say they have * little * to do with each other . 
  because it 's on the african continental plate . 
  the strait of messina is the border between two plates . 
  what 's the biggest active volcano in europe ?
