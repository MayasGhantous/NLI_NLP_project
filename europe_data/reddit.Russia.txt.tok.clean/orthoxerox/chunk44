  people have conquered the world as luxembourg , i bet estonia is not much harder to play as . 
  flair checks out . 
  thank you , but i was asking about germany . 
  i think the most common source is gerhard reichling , * die deutschen vertriebenen in zahlen * . 
  if i remember the book well enough , the calculations went like that : * based on the data of two ( ? ), 
  hospitals , about 5 % of the children born in berlin between the end of 1945 and the summer of 1946 were `` russian children '' ( had their father listed as `` russian '' or `` unknown '' ) ( iirc , he did n't have access to the whole time period either ) * every single one of them was a result of rape ( no one whored themselves to the officers for rations or actually had sex willingly , perhaps ) * this is extrapolated to all births across berlin ( plausible ) * about 90 % of these women had an abortion , 10 % gave birth ( arbitrary ) * about 20 % of the raped women became pregnant ( i am not a doctor , so i ca n't say what the average fertilization rate is , but birth control effectiveness rate is listed at 15 % for no birth control if you have regular sex for a * year * , no special timing to avoid or hit ovulation , so let 's agree that 20 % for 6 months is a reasonable fertility rate for a malnourished and stressed woman ) if you fiddle with the percentages , you can get anything from 20k to 100k rapes , for example . 
  20k rapes is still twenty thousand rapes too many , but that 's not something extraordinary atrocious . 
  it 's correct in russian , but i chiefly used it to annoy you . 
  only after you stop spelling \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f venemaa . 
   it would take decades and massive investments to even dream of russia catching up with the rest of the eu even romania 's in the eu . 
  how many out of those 81m are turks ? 
  let me start with a smaller country first . 
  in any case , do you think a phosphorite mine is a good business to start in estonia ? 
  fertilizer prices are growing and i 've heard you have virtually untapped deposits . 
  it 's the same joke . 
  at least my portrayal of estonians is not falsified , then . 
  yeah , that 's what has puzzled me about estonians so much . 
  `` fee too not like your criminaal traammas , so fee feel pan your chaannels . '', 
  no one else has a problem with them !, 
  yeah , but if you make them truthful criminals might learn how the police works . 
   at least western media occasionally carry publications that criticize western powers . 
  as the old joke goes , russian media occasionally carry publications that criticize western powers as well . 
  i think it was . 
  or has the `` statistician '' who based his extrapolation on a single abortion clinic reached a higher number ? 
  and gun turrets linked to cctv that shoot anyone who draws a gun without an iff token . 
   really quickly kills anyone is texas ( i think average is like 3 years waiting for execution ) . 
  that 's really quickly ? 
  really quickly is in a week or so . 
  was n't that an upper limit extrapolation ? 
  divide them by the size of the army and the quality of life discrepancy and they do not look extraordinary . 
  rape and pillage are never justified , but i can not say that soviet war crimes in germany were something extraordinary . 
   why estonians seeminly rather prefer justifying the pro-nazi collaborationists instead of remembering estonians who fought for the red army , that i really do n't know . 
  i wonder if this is is the straw that will break / u/h2ppyme 's back . 
   also noticed berlin is there as `` liberated '' . 
  til enemy is not defeated and conquered , enemy is liberated . 
  the city was liberated since it was supposedly not populated by willing nazis , but civilians oppressed by nazis . 
  some logistician must be immensely proud of themselves for organizing that . 
  are the drain pipes connected to the storm drains now or do they still drain straight onto the pavement ? 
  it 's more of `` if she looks you in the eye while wearing a minidress and smiles , she 's not ` asking for it ' '' . 
   greece ever invaded anyone in its history ? 
  turkey , unsuccessfully . 
  it 's not better , it 's different . 
  a lot of it has been forgotten , like specific soups and pies . 
  i am not one of those people who can subsist on vodka alone . 
  if you mean the quality of foodstuffs , not the cuisine itself , then i would have to agree . 
  it 's not bad . 
  next you tell me i am not a bosnian serb ? 
  i wondered if swamp germans were worse at that humour thing than plains germans . 
  now i know . 
  olympic villages are well-known for their sex parties . 
  everyone there is young , has a great body and has nothing to do after they are finished with the sporting events . 
  worked well enough in spain . 
   ordinary , innocent muslims why not force them to convert ? 
  prisons should not be a punishment . 
  prisons should be there to protect the general public and to rehabilitate criminals . 
  no they should n't . 
  joking about rape , very classy . 
  i think they should rebrand it to `` drug-enforced impotence '' . 
  `` chemical castration '' sounds like they dissolve their genitals in acid . 
  but judging by your username , you do . 
  they shave the ass first . 
  why ? 
  people have fond memories of visiting the baltics or living there . 
  they feel like an extension of their country to them . 
  it does n't matter that most of * you * do n't think this way , it matters that many of * us * think this way . 
  ex-soviet countries steel feel like their own to many russians . 
  that 's what my original tongue in cheek comment was about . 
  if you are serious , then we share quite a lot : ugly architecture , history of repressions by the soviet state , fighting side by side in wwii ( although this one does n't apply to the baltic states ) . 
  [ yes , we do ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_people ) . 
   still feel like my own we know those feels ... 
  not those who can be summoned by a mere mention of the famous macedonian , \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 in his native tongue ? 
  i would watch that . 
  that and some pollaxe duels in plate . 
  it 's special . 
  is n't it an international waterway ? 
  up the danube , then down the main , then up the rhine till you reach basel . 
  turkish textile industry is huge . 
  and 30 governors as well . 
  this will be known as the great purges of 2016 . 
  you do n't have to wear a suit and commute in the sauna . 
  white , for `` ak '' in akp ? 
  erdogan wants to undercut russua 's no. 2 export - dashcam footage . 
  turkey bacon is halal . 
  gulen is turkey 's equivalent of us state dept for russia . 
  he 's behind everything . 
  were mosques automated , or did muezzins actually support erdogan ? 
  it 's public and there 's ~ ~ no way in hell he can afford this jet , his overseas real estate or his rolls royce ~ ~ enough money there to hire this jet , but some of his real estate and cars are missing from his income and assets declaration . 
  he may own or lease this jet , but then he has to explain how on earth is he able to spend that much when his salary is well-known and is much smaller . 
  like [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/temples_of_humankind ) ? 
   germany has joined the eurasian customs union  our russian-ukrainian war has merged with the english-scottish war, 
  yep , he needs a war to pick that national focus that leads to an extra research slot . 
   the cyrillic alphabet is crazy . 
  i am within my rights to report an alleged rape even if i was sober . 
  what i am asking is how to prosecute that . 
  the same people who push for `` ymy '' also insist that intoxicated people can not give informed consent . 
  they , however , refuse to answer the question of prosecuting drunk sex . 
  existing evidence shows that the boy is branded the rapist and the girl is branded the victim even if she pre-gamed ( so he had no idea that she was more inebriated than usual ) and initiated the sexual contact by honking his junk through the pants . 
  that 's why i reframed the situation and made them both girls . 
  now there 's no imbalance in the relationship , but one of the partners is having second thoughts . 
  neither could give informed consent , who should be prosecuted , if at all ?
