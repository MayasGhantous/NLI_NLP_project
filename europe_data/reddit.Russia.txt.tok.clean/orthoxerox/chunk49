  you can '' \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0434\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c '' , but it 's 2am and i ca n't explain the difference . 
  you can say '' \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0446\u0430 '' to justify or explain her behavior or other person 's reaction to her . 
  here 's a better example where all three sentences are equally valid : \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0442\u0430 - \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u044d\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 .

  it should be a shy smile before you look away because your eyes met and that 's not okay . 
  not a proud `` look at how much i had to pay my dentist '' smile .

  what 's the interest rate on an average mortgage in latvia ? 
  this might be the reason why the russians are so price-conscious . 
  yes , old commieblocks were built at density that makes it possible to convert a district into low-rise blocks . 
  modern capitalistblocks are built as dense as legally possible ( and a bit denser than that ) , it 's not possible to built low-rise blocks and get the same density with them . 
  because it 's cheaper not to build them . 
  these ghettoes are in high enough demand without parking or playgrounds or trees or a road wide enough for all these cars that leads to the city center . 
  and then they 'll build [ a concrete jungle of 25-storey housing blocks with everything on the ground level covered in cars ] ( http://varlamov.ru/2210604.html ) . 
  moscow ( and oblast , too ) really needs a ordinance limiting the height of new buildings . 
  incentives and legal changes to build low-rise apartment blocks should follow , but the ban should come first and quickly . 
  pity the property developers ' lobby is too strong for that,

  kansas bumfuck roads look just like central russia . 
  only orange road markings prevented me from clicking somewhere in ryazan oblast . 
   while also prevent starvation in the rest of the ussr .

  hahahano.jpg under navalny you 're much more likely to see russian police , russian fsb , russian civil service displacing corrupt locals , killing them in `` anti-terrorist operations '' and hoping the population can see beyond their clan ties and recognise the benefits of direct rule .

  the decision on the removal of the president of ukraine from office by the procedure of impeachment is adopted by the verkhovna rada of ukraine by no less than three-quarters of its constitutional composition , after the review of the case by the constitutional court of ukraine and the receipt of its opinion on the observance of the constitutional procedure of investigation and consideration of the case of impeachment , and the receipt of the opinion of the supreme court of ukraine to the effect that the acts , of which the president of ukraine is accused , contain elements of state treason or other crime . 
  they did it in one day with 328/450 deputies , less that 75 % and no constitutional court and supreme court case : https://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/euromaidan-rallies-in-ukraine-feb-21-live-updates-337287.html,
