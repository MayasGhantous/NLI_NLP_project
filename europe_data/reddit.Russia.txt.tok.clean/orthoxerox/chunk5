  i nabbed some cheddar and double gloucester yesterday while i still could , though . 
  in russian we say : * \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0441-\u043a\u0432\u043e * \u0434\u0435-\u044e\u0440\u0435 * \u0434\u0435-\u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e * \u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0440\u0438 * \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0442\u0443\u043c * \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e other latin phrases are generally translated into russian , so we do n't say * per capita * , we say * \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430 * . 
  we can still eat blinis with caviar and borodinsky bread . 
  i have also planted a new apple tree in my yard . 
  borscht is much more ukrainian than russian , you should 've picked shchi for russia . 
  i love how the germans have to spell it , * schtschi * , while we need just two letters . 
  they have some of the best wetlands in europe from being so flat . 
  they are so extensive the germans had to split their offensive around them in wwii . 
  russian academia is not independent . 
  most universities that are not blatant diploma mills are federal universities and are controlled by the ministry of education . 
  as far as i remember , the geysers pushed through the mudslide eventually . 
  i am not sure if the vegetation has recovered , though . 
  you must 've never been to russia . 
  carlsson is a culture hero here . 
  it did n't hurt that the translation was top notch , but everyone old enough to read knows who carlsson is . 
  there was a contest to select the seven wonders of russia , and the winners were : 1 [ lake baikal ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/%d0%a8%d0%b0%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%ba%d0%b0.jpg ) , the biggest lake in the world , it contains 20 % of all fresh water . 
  2 [ valley of the geysers ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/valley_of_the_geysers.jpg ) , our own yellowstone . 
  it 's a pity it 's so remote , i 'd love to visit it . 
  3 [ mamayev kurgan ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ru/5/5e/rodina_mat_zovet.jpg ) , a wwii memorial in volgograd , famous for its gigantic statue . 
  4 [ peterhof ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/grand_cascade_in_peterhof_01.jpg ) , the palace of peter the great built to outbling versailles and any other european palace . 
  5 [ saint basil 's cathedral ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/moscow_july_2011-4a.jpg ) , you know where it is . 
  it was built to celebrate the annexation of kazan . 
  6 [ manpupunyor rock formations ] ( http://www.360cities.net/image/trusov-manpupunyor1/?from=map,60.75916,62.05078,3#320.30,0.00,70.0 ) , located in the largest virgin forest in europe ; i have no idea how these stone penises got voted in . 
  7 [ mount elbrus ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/elbrus_north_195.jpg ) , the highest mountain of europe . 
  once again , i am not so sure why it is a wonder . 
  i would add two other wonders to this list : * [ trans-siberian railroad ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/transsibirische_eisenbahn.png ) , it 's so long that you will finally understand how big russia is . 
  somewhere in the middle of it . 
  * [ kizhi ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/kizhi_churches.jpg ) , an island with wonderful wooden churches, 
  greece had 4 out of 7 original wonders and lost all of them , some together with the land they stood on . 
  i guess that 's horeca ensuring they have enough cheese to stick to their existing menu until they can adapt to the lack of parmesan and brie . 
  some context : donbass is kinda flat and the hill of saur-mogila ( i 'll use russian spelling ) is an important commanding height . 
  it was the cornerstone of a german defensive line that was a real bitch to break through . 
  the monument was built there to commemorate the successful storming of the line by soviet forces . 
  so it 's no wonder that the hill ( still full of wwii trenches ) was used by the rebels as a defensive point and it 's no wonder that ukrainian army had to shell it really hard . 
  it 's not like they wanted to destroy the memorial itself , the location is simply too important for both sides from a military standpoint . 
  yep , if you look at historical maps , czech lands are almost always the same . 
  roman crimea was abandoned to goths , phanagoria in less controversial russia managed to survive , check back next week to see what happens to it . 
  people thought napoleon iii was no idiot . 
  fuck no , we are mad . 
  pig farming is a stereotypical ukrainian pastime . 
  i guess the idea is that they will raise pigs for us . 
  computer viruses for elbrus cpus ? 
  it was like america from soviet propaganda . 
  last time it did n't work out so well , did it ? 
  ah , the golden age of paying tribute to novgorod ... 
  are channel islands in the eu ? 
  i do n't think the reactionary rule of nicholas i was a golden age . 
  a golden age in literature ? 
  yes . 
  which of these times were great for russian people ? 
  i did mention the 60 's and the 70 's when we lived * okay * . 
  do you think we should join poland and ukraine and have '' \u0415\u0449\u0451 \u0420\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0433\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0430 '' as our anthem ? 
  catherine ii times were great times for handsome virile young men that were into apple-cheeked grannies . 
  that was in the 18th century , was n't it ? 
  no such thing in russian history , first we had constant wars between rurikid princes , then the mongols came , then the lithuanians , then the poles and the crimean tatars , then the swedes , the french , then more french and the british , then wwi , two revolutions , a civil war , the purges , wwii , the 90 's and now eu is imposing sanctions instead of kidnapping putin 's daughter . 
  i would guess many people would say the 1960 's and 1970 's were the best times to live in . 
  you know that is a criminal offence in russia now , do n't you ? 
  what about derbent ? 
  only if there 's an invasion of crimea . 
  donbass is not worth the mass. 
  you forgot about greek colonies in crimea . 
  these citizens could be turned into shiny discs and arranged in pleasant geometrical patterns . 
  yep , this is a standard russian shitload : http://lurkmore.so/images/2/24/chas_pik.jpg, 
  that 's not a shitload , a shitload is when you ca n't find a spot where you wo n't touch anyone else . 
  fair enough . 
  shame we 're not leading our countries , is n't it ? 
  the same applies to giving crimea back . 
  given the current mood in the country such a deal would be a national disgrace of epic proportions . 
  and we 'd be getting a war sooner rather than later if history is any indication ... that 's besides the fact that signing such a document is effectively signing your own resignation so i do n't see putin doing this . 
  plus ukraine will have to subdue crimean insurgents as well , and they will be a problem even without russian support . 
  \u041e\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0437 , \u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0437 ( oh , the frost , the frost - a song of a rider ) : http://youtube.com/watch?v=u6ipiedymzs \u0427\u0451\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d ( black raven - a song of a dying cossack ) : http://youtube.com/watch?v=mvdmfxomg18, 
  i think kulebyaka ( or coulibiac , if you 're a snooty frenchman ) is the best russian dish . 
  a huge pie with different fillings , like sturgeon , mushrooms , buckwheat and eggs , laid out in such a way that every bite is different . 
  you do n't use kvas ? 
  that 's not bacon , that 's st. george 's cross ' ribbon . 
  you could try combining these : http://politikym.net/dosie/poroshenko_v_vanne_krovi.jpg http://voicesevas.ru/img/1454448160d0c8e672b7542b61054a82.jpg, 
  you mean anti-russian . 
  russian propaganda shows poroshenko wearing waffen-ss uniform and snacking on donbass orphans . 
  what about boys ? 
  and in russia . 
  `` eleven without fifteen '' . 
  when i was young i liked to be a smartass and said things like `` thirty-seven minutes of the nineteenth '' . 
  in russian you say `` 15 of the third '' to say 2:15 . 
  also , 1.5 is `` poltora '' , which comes from `` half two '' . 
  also , you ca n't say `` poltora '' with plural nouns in nominative , which is a big problem since the word for a 24-hour day is `` sutki '' , a plural noun . 
  you could also move the bogies to the very ends of the carriage so the bogie is shared by two carriages . 
  but this makes your tram more complicated . 
  you can simply connect more tatras together , as if in a shunting yard , but making a long tram with jacobs bogies requries a crane and some assembly . 
  all starch and no meat make yakov a fat boy . 
  things with wheels on the bottom side of the carriage . 
  i 've ridden a similar tram in zagreb . 
  the problem is with the ~ ~ bogeys ~ ~ bogies . 
  if you want a low floor , you either have to rebuild the tram with modern ~ ~ bogeys ~ ~ bogies or you rotate the seats . 
  edit : spelling, 
  i personally am not against gm , i am against closed source gm . 
  i am not scared of fish genes in my tomato , i am scared of secret genes in my tomato . 
  what if it these tomato plants will render other tomato plants infertile ? 
  now the farmers will not be able to fall back to other tomato varieties if they ca n't afford brand name tomatos . 
  i also do not like roundup-ready plants . 
  it is a nifty idea , but it gives such a huge cost advantage to those who grow brand-name crops that it again leads to vendor lock-in .
