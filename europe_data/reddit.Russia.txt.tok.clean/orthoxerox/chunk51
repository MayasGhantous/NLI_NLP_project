  practically all ngo activity can be considered political if you squint hard enough . 
  this definitely has a chilling effect on their actions . 
  clinton foundation is funded by the governments that want to influence american politics , so i would consider it a foreign agent in the us . 
  if it did the same in russia , it would be a foreign agent . 
  likewise , there 's no point in creating a law that affects more people that should n't be affected by it than those that should , be it this law or the painkillers regulations . 
  you should start with a precisely targeted law and they * maybe * carefully expand it when it is shown to be ineffective , not start with a blanket law and then adjust it when people are wailing and gnashing their teeth . 
  have you checked what organisations are branded foreign agents in the us ? 
  how is promotion of liberal values and ideas a political activity ? 
  why does being funded by a russian from his account abroad make you an agent of a foreign power ? 
  the law is unnecessarily broad . 
  it should be limited to funding by foreign states ( with a transitive closure ) . 
  and it should be limited to actual politics : support of candidates and bills or executive actions that directly benefit the foreign power in question . 
   you should probably give examples of organisations who chose to close dynasty fund ? 
  many speed !, 
  wow !, 
  like what ? 
  yeah , i thought they were there to indicate the bank should not be bailed out by the government , but bankrupted . 
  if you hair is longer that julius caesar 's , you must be a catamite . 
  we 're the third rome , after all , got ta follow the traditions . 
  yeah , she looks like she has an ok.ru account . 
  not everyone who lived there was a cossack . 
  there were `` wild '' cossacks beyond the rapids , they were militarised like , say , rajputs . 
  peasants to the north of the rapids called their militia units cossacks as well and they were more numerous than the host proper . 
  people in what is now western ukraine lived in relative safety under polish/lithuanian landowners . 
  you forgot about wars with poland/lithuania . 
  you should see / r/liberta . 
  i considered them some of the most reasonable russians on reddit , but after seeing so many gleeful comments i am no longer sure . 
  it 's a crime to say otherwise . 
  yes , her husband and her foundation both confirmed her death . 
  and doctor liza as well . 
   89 % of people got the answer to this simple math question wrong !, 
  and then 1600 comments of ' 36 ' or whatever the answer was . 
   a shitty jpeg with a yawn-inducing quote and then 300 comments of `` i 've had enough of this shit in my feed '', 
  i expected them to be from saint-tropez . 
  it 's higher in feet . 
  not when it 's methanol, 
  like this : http://visual.rzd.ru/photobank/public/ru?structure_id=4&amp;layer_id=5327&amp;make=search&amp;type=&amp;cat=&amp;photogal_id=37&amp;textsearch=&amp;city=&amp;date_begin=&amp;date_end=, 
  are you telling us the candidates drained the players of all energy somehow ? 
  it has sleeper cars . 
  the first two are from october . 
  thanks for the route . 
  i wonder why there 's a large detour in belarus . 
  could n't find an article in english , only spanish or russian . 
  [ google translated op ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.lavanguardia.com%2fvida%2f20161217%2f412691145283%2feconomiaempresas--inaugurada-la-conexion-ferroviaria-directa-moscu-berlin-con-trenes-talgo.html ) i have no idea who will use this train other than aerophobes . 
  a single ticket costs 9000 rub ( 140 eur ) , while a single aeroflot airplane ticket can be bought for 8000 rub ( 123 eur ) . 
  maybe if they improved the whole track to double the speed , then a 10-hour journey would be an attractive proposition : board the train in moscow at 9 pm after dinner , arrive in berlin at 7 am in time for breakfast . 
  or hueber . 
  with almost everyone living in the barbican . 
  computer modern is the standard typeface for academic papers . 
  they have even commissioned special fonts , [ pt astra serif and sans ] ( http://astralinux.com/fonts.html ) that are metric compatible with tnr and support all national languages used in russia , but so many internal regulations literally demand the use of tnr in electronic documents it will be a pain to make the switch . 
  many internal regulations require the documents to be set in tnr , so replacing it with a metric-compatible font like liberation serif is technically not allowed . 
  most of moldova 's industry , including power generation , was built beyond the dniester , plus the border is not that well-defined in places , deviating from the dniester itself . 
  it 's political suicide to discuss it . 
  imagine some ukrainian politician saying they should accept the loss of crimea , or some estonian estonian politician pushing for two official languages . 
  for the lazy : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hygge, 
  what do you do with its millions of tiny bones ? 
  and the annexation of kiev , after which it was made capital . 
  not me personally , but yes , that would 've ensured the stability of the union . 
  because that allowed them to have a natural reason to split off . 
  assimilation , of course . 
  national republics were a mistake . 
  waste of perfectly good acid . 
  killed ? 
  integrated and diluted ? 
  yes . 
  chips , gravy , deep fried mars bars . 
  i did n't expect you to reply before the day after tomorrow . 
  everyone knows why there are so few fatal road accidents in estonia . 
  not even a bacalhau on your coa ? 
  exactly . 
  when everyone saw during euromaidan that you would n't obey the rules of countryball the west agreed to limit their support . 
  is n't that his cousin dankbeard ? 
  when i told my wife about muff , halfboot and mossbeard she said i was tripping balls . 
  yeah , i had a feeling my smartphone would soon become theirs . 
  is that green grass i see ? 
  where is waist-high snow ? 
  i love turin . 
  i should visit the rest of piedmont some day . 
  by the way , do you know a good brand of hazelnut/cocoa spread that still uses hazelnut oil/cocoa butter and not palm oil ? 
  the 1100s * are * the middle ages, 
  kiev is a bad example , since it did n't belong to any branch , but everyone fought wars over it . 
  mstislav vs yaroslav is probably the only example of the land being split between warring kiev and chernigov . 
  well , our ancestors cremated their dead and buried them in pots made by hand , without a potter 's wheel . 
  that 's about it . 
   name me a country where minority residents who do n't know native language ( the only official language ) can vote/can run for office/can work in public sector . 
  the us ? 
  we 're sorry , we thought that was jaroslaw . 
  did you know that all pure-blood georgians are blue-eyed blondes ? 
  that 's what a girl named tamuna told me once . 
  maybe they wanted to say `` western istanbul - europe '' ? 
  some aspects were better , why not restore them ? 
  no one says the new building should n't have centralized ventilation , modern plumbing and communications . 
  i hope the person on the other end of line will be a guy who 'll be all `` sweetheart , that was n't mansplaining at all . 
  now , if you could quiet down for a second and listen to me , i would tell you everything you should know about mansplaining '' . 
  or a tea break . 
  and then gehry , calatrava , hadid , foster , liebeskind and the rest of the gang came and stuck their overpriced low-poly monstrosities in the middle of what remained of the city . 
  to be frank , even entstuckte houses look better than modern rectangles , their shapes themselves are better . 
  but it * is * good for your colon . 
  i 've never shat better than in my grandma 's village , squatting under a bush with a spade . 
  have you ever seen ancient greeks wear cold weather clothing ?
