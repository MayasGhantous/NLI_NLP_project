  it gets rather chilly in the mountains in winter . 
  come to think of it , what did scots wear in winter ? 
  would their bells jingle ? 
  the girl on the left on the second photo has a searing hoo-ha . 
  the 12erhorn !!, 
  loved this place , especially the 12erhorn . 
  he 's not . 
  he 's \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043f\u0435\u0446 , which is like being a martyr , but without being tortured for your faith , only killed . 
  no , their mating calls are different . 
  probably less overblown than the toes . 
  no , it 's a russian language news site . 
  how does one perform a natural beheading ? 
  meduza is headquartered there because it 's easy to live in riga knowing only russian . 
  we used to have vef phones in our home , how has this factory fared ? 
  [ hhhehehe ? 
  that makes as much sense as `` 1 solution - learn russian '' . 
  the axis supported indian independence . 
  yeah , but that 's an international conglomerate . 
  i never expected germany to be the biggest ice cream producer . 
  he 's the double dirk dude . 
  i still wonder how vyshinsky managed to avoid any repercussions . 
   having two guards escort five very violent gangsters with nothing to lose is very much not russian . 
  it 's very much russian . 
  half-assing established procedures is our national pastime . 
  that 's why my post is titled `` latinisation of russian '' . 
   also you do n't seem to have considered modifying consonant , not the vowel for palatization i.e. 
  i did consider that , but there was n't a single mark that was supported by all consonants . 
  shits and giggles , mostly . 
  i was inspired by kazakhstan news . 
  hey , that 's our disaster recovery plan !, 
  looks like no one likes \u015a and \u0106 . 
  however , i really do n't like \u0160\u010d , since it would imply / \u0282t\u0255 / . 
  because i wanted it to look like other slavic languages that use latin alphabet . 
  i agree that the diacritics for the consonants can be revised , but what would you propose for the vowels ? 
  that 's what my wife says . 
  it looks like latinised belarusian . 
  i have no idea . 
  as i 've said , i 'm not ukrainian . 
  the ogonek would confuse the poles , and there are even more of them . 
  the acute would confuse the russians , as it looks like a stress mark . 
  i 'm sorry , i do n't quite follow you . 
  if i write \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0430 instead of \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430 , do i then write \u0433\u044a\u0435\u043d\u0430 instead of \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0430 ? 
  i had no goal to get rid of diacritics . 
  ha\u010deks make it look slavic . 
  i am not 100 % sure \u0107 is the best option , but it 's everywhere in ex-yu names where a \u0447 would be . 
  and without it \u015b would be so alone . 
  yes , i know , but there was no other diacritic . 
  perhaps ` ` e ` could be a way out . 
  that is deliberate . 
  4 . \u0439 is never written after consonants , that 's why it can share a letter with the soft sign . 
  not a big fan of universal human rights , are you ? 
  both russian \u0449 and polish \u015b are / \u0255 / . 
  they do n't ? 
  you ca n't palatalize them with a soft sign , but you can with a vowel . 
  yes , russian \u0447 is palatal , not retroflex or alveolar . 
  1 ) iso 9 is a way to reliably transcribe cyrillic for scientific purposes . 
  it 's ugly . 
  2 ) lots , and i mean * lots * of databases across the world are still using 8-bit encodings . 
  i do , it 's horrible . 
  it 's a scientific notation , not something you can write and read comfortably . 
  i also do the original ideas from the 1920 's , which are quite similar to mine . 
  ** bonus : belarusian and ukrainian ** i could n't have ignored our dearest neighbors . 
  changes for belarusian : \u0406\u0456 - ii \u040e\u045e - ww \u0427\u0447 - \u010c\u010d ' - ' \u0441 ' \u044f - s ` ja notes : - \u0426\u0446 can be palatalized in belarusian , so it can be followed by j or a marked vowel - \u0427\u0447 has a different sound in belarusian , so the diacritic has been changed to reflect that . 
  changes for ukrainian : \u0490\u0491 - \u01e6\u01e7 \u0415\u0435 - ee \u0404\u0454 - je je or \u00cb\u00eb \u0418\u0438 - yy \u0406\u0456 - ii \u0407\u0457 - ji ji \u0427\u0447 - \u010c\u010d \u0429\u0449 - \u0160\u010d \u0161\u010d ' - ' \u0441 ' \u044f - s ` ja notes : - \u0413\u0433 is a fricative in ukrainian and is much more common than \u0490\u0491 ( a plosive ) , so it had to be represented by gg . 
  as behooves a russian , i had to pick a letter that does n't exist in legacy codepages to represent \u0490\u0491 . 
  - \u0404\u0454 and \u0415\u0435 are more regular than \u0415\u0435 and \u042d\u044d in russian , so the translation rule is copied from \u0410\u0430 / \u042f\u044f . 
  - \u0426\u0446 can be palatalized in ukrainian , so it can be followed by j or a marked vowel - \u0427\u0447 has a different sound in ukrainian , so the diacritic has been changed to reflect that . 
  - \u0429\u0449 is pronounced \u0428\u0427 \u0448\u0447 is ukrainian , so it 's represented with a digraph . 
  newer carriages can do this much faster . 
  western ukraine does n't look like russia at all . 
   me with my friends were noticed two times that i should not speak loud in polish ( once in small pub and second time on the street ) is n't it great ? 
  our country is sending troops into ukraine and denying that , but no one gives a fuck if you 're speaking russian in lvov . 
  your country supports ukraine , but people do n't like you speaking polish . 
   anatolia turkestan, 
   anatolia turkestan, 
  i wonder what the turkish equivalent of * vatnik * is called . 
  the bible says nothing about assault rifles , so it 's a-okay . 
  because god wills it , of course . 
  seriously , though , erdogan is an ally of convenience , not a strategic partner of putin . 
  he 'll be backstabbed as soon as it becomes profitable . 
  revising the montreux convention or having to deal with well-funded and well-armed kurds from syria , what will recep choose ? 
  russian missiles falling on his head , i guess . 
  as soon as he leaves nato , putin will finally do what catherine could n't . 
  well , not entirely !, 
  one small village of indomitable gauls still holds out against the invaders . 
  flevoland is the rybinsk reservoir of the netherlands . 
  looks like far cry 5 to me . 
  are there any westerns set in montana ? 
  the teacher 's been a teacher for too long to be bothered by any of this . 
  the boy in the camo shirt looks gypsy to me . 
  same here . 
  i ca n't taste the difference , and uht is so convenient . 
  you do n't have to sniff the milk every time you want to drink it . 
  poland , poland and poland ? 
  we 've also tried to make europe belong to us , but the ungrateful bastards ran away at the first opportunity . 
   camomile aka not tea, 
  june 2018 , according to our climatologists . 
  well , my approach was to stick to districts built after 1978 but before the 90 's ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u041f-44 is the name of this commieblock model ) that had powerlines running across the road from them over an unbuilt and unforested area . 
  i used osm for that since their maps have prominent power lines . 
  that basically narrowed the search down to old maryino and brateevo .
