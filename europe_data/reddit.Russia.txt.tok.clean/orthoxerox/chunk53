  the bus stop on the photo is an older model , so i did n't look for a 100 % match ( as you can see , the road has been widened and the trees have grown quite a lot ) , so i kept looking for a block with blue details standing close to a block with brown details . 
  i think i found it . 
  https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/?ll=37.715302%2c55.642424&amp;z=16&amp;l=stv%2csta%2csat%2cskl&amp;panorama%5bpoint%5d=37.751528%2c55.638867&amp;panorama%5bdirection%5d=121.802267%2c16.094817&amp;panorama%5bspan%5d=120.000000%2c68.681608 it 's in brateevo in se moscow . 
  if you turn the panorama around you 'll see the bus stop , the pylon and the bridge with the railings where the girls stood . 
  definitely moscow . 
  use yandex or google street view to locate the pylon on the right and the tiny shop in the background . 
  cracklings . 
  that looks like authentic russian tasteless food ornaments . 
  well , a few days ago the new editor in chief was introduced . 
  http://www.interfax.ru/business/569660 it was bought in june : http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/16/06/2017/5943ef019a7947edcec84861, 
  it was bought just a few days ago . 
   rbc is as trustworthy as reuters . 
  it 's been taken over , and the new editor in chief is from ren-tv . 
  i 'm not saying it will fix russia . 
  but if you fix the situation first , e-voting will prevent a relapse much more efficiently than paper-based voting . 
  why would you need a chip ? 
  your private key is just a sequence of bits . 
  what do you mean there 's no such thing ? 
  you can start with an honest voting process using paper ballots and corrupt it step by step without attracting too much attention . 
  if you start with an end-to-end verifiable e-voting process you can not corrupt it just a little bit and hope no one will notice . 
  the count the votes electronically , the whole process is not secured cryptographically . 
  this is called eligibility check and is a property of modern e-voting models . 
  the election fingerprints you 've attached are well-known to me , but they can be dismissed by a fraudulent authority in charge of the election ( `` yes , we have stations with 100 % turnout that voted for a single party , so what ? '' ) . 
  an irregularity in a e-voting model with proper checks * proves * the election is fraudulent by definition . 
  with end-to-end auditable electronic voting you have the proof of tampering the very second the results are published . 
  with paper-based voting you have to contest the count in court based on indirect evidence : you saw stuffing going on , vote counting was done improperly , per-station tallies were amended while being tallied up themselves . 
  rigging paper ballot voting is easy as * fuck * , we do it every time . 
   rprised that russia is so low . 
   my so 's body is probably made of 10 % doktorskaya kiolbasa ( which i ca n't spell ) that 's because it 's not meat , it 's pink slime and paper pulp . 
  i wo n't say that 's a good thing . 
  not a the most flattering of comparisons . 
  hey , our nanomachines are the biggest in the world !, 
  the anal plug is a different building aka the gherkin . 
  what the fuck is that lake on the border between free slavs and khazar tributaries ? 
   we ask the same question to people who vote for erdo\u011fan and they usually respond with `` because there are no better alternatives '' . 
  why does this remind me of something ... 
  russian international guard ? 
  this . 
  we do n't get a lot of tropical fruits , unless you 're willing to pay 600 roubles + per kilo in av or globus gourmet . 
  plus the ones served in florida are more likely to be vine-ripened and therefore tastier . 
  it looks like an extermination camp oven . 
  maker and creator of maps and peddler of books . 
  you should just call the ostia line metro \u0421 and rename current metro c metro d. bam , instant completion . 
  it 's a fucking stone oven in summer . 
  sunlit terraces look great , but i would prefer shady terraces . 
  nameless finger , ground ball , iron road and fall place are the same in russian . 
  i find myself agreeing with the germans , this is what spaghetti bolognese looks like . 
  dagestani is not an ethnic group . 
  cheap ? 
  i do n't remember ligurian coast being cheap .

  we can provide assistance . 
  we have verified experience in supporting unilateral declarations of independence . 
  damn , i 've been poed . 
  poles go to sweden , russia and germany to kill in revenge for the deluge and the partitions . 
  you can see lindau , bavaria as well . 
  halstatt is overhyped . 
  of all the villages and towns i 've visited in skg only ebensee was worse . 
  they are literally caucasian , after all . 
  there 's not that chocolate in nutella , either . 
  be careful , there 's a qte sequence right after it . 
  it is , but it could be simplified for international communication . 
  is it better than interslavic ? 
  we will soon have more pan-slavic conlangs than real slavic languages . 
  more profit to the developers , you mean . 
  and love of preserved old stuff in general . 
  i know in china they often rebuild historic buildings from the ground up . 
  putin 's not cthulhu , he 'll die sooner or later . 
  we need to retread existing negotiations , not start from scratch . 
  russians are reasonably close to the visa free travel . 
  we almost got it a few years back , but our officials got too greedy . 
  were hydroelectic dams on dnepr and volga built by sarmatians , slavs or alans ? 
  1030 best year of my life, 
  i wo n't mind that at all . 
  miranda needs some meat on her arms . 
  i like how ukrainian nationalists want to give away some currently ukrainian territories according to this map .

  `` why do n't moldovans eat pickles ? 
  their head does n't fit through the jar opening '',

  i was reading about toledo zoo hippos and thought `` cool , i must visit it when i go to madrid '' . 
  turns out unimaginative american settlers were fucking with me again . 
  will i start a war if i say the tune sounded rather turkish ? 
  same here in moscow . 
   routinely, 
  you connection gets routed through a government pc and is manually monitored by a tired old censor .
