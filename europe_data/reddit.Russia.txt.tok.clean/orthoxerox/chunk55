  or is it washington irving 's one from sleepy hollow , with a pumpkin head at his saddle ? 
  americans generally do n't know the former and russians the latter . 
  upd : do you kids read any books these days ? 
  now that we 've learned about germany and * wetten , das * , it is time to discuss what original programming other european countries have come up with . 
  i 'm sure that despite the prevalence of endemol shows and everything * ... on ice * there 's something interesting in every country . 
  most of us have seen enough american films to have an idea how their soldiers have to stand , but what about the armies of our own neighbors ? 
  `` ye old shoppe '' and stuff like that , but in your native language . 
  hi / r/europe , since we 're now in the middle of the winter , let 's discuss what kind of hearty dishes your countrymen eat when it 's cold outside . 
  something that warms your body and your heart . 
  damn , noticed a typo in the title . 
  greece has macedonian naming dispute , which turns any greek into an incoherent whirlwind of spite and spittle . 
  czech republic does n't want to be in eastern europe equally hard . 
  what about other countries ? 
  is there anything i can say to any of your countrymen to provoke an angry response with 100 % probability ? 
  federal/municipal , general/specialized , etc. 
  experiences of your friends and relatives are also welcome . 
  i 've played around with netto-brutto calculations , and it looks like you have to have a 60000 annual salary in austria to have the same netto monthly income as a german who has a 43000 annual salary . 
  what 's the reason for this difference ? 
  are austrian healthcare , education and pensions so much better ? 
  check the list at http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/columbian_exchange can you imagine the national cuisine of hungary without paprika , romania without maize , italy without tomatoes , belarus without potatoes and belgium and switzerland without chocolate ? 
  i 've heard crazy stories about brits going to great lengths trying to use less water because it 's not that cheap there . 
  here in moscow 1000 liters of cold water cost 0.52 eur and 1000 liters of hot water cost 1.94-2 .43 , depending on the heat provider . 
  edit : i forgot about the sewage , so add 0.40 eur to both rates . 
  for example , french toast , french fries , hamburger in english . 
  is it irregular verbs , phrasal verbs , lack of standard genderless third person pronoun , a specific sound , twelve + tenses ? 
  what 's the hardest thing for a typical german/french/czech / estonian/bulgarian/etc . 
  to celebrate midsummer , let 's talk about local dishes your countrymen eat when it 's too hot outside . 
  beer is not food , despite claims to the contrary . 
  is [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/condensed_milk ) something you commonly have in your pantry ? 
  what do you add it to ? 
  do you eat it with a spoon ? 
  do you boil whole cans of it ? 
  ~ ~ do you use it as a genital lubricant ? ~ ~ is it sweetened or not ? 
  i know brits and americans have no fear of drafts , air conditioning and going out with your hair still wet , while russians and germans consider them dangerous death-bringers . 
  what about other european countries ? 
  if you do n't know , a snipe hunt is the act of sending a newcomer on a futile quest to find some elbow grease , tartan paint , or mike hawk/hunt , common in some blue collar jobs or in the army as a mild form of hazing . 
  do you have them in your country ? 
  any examples ? 
  if they 're not pan-european like john and peter and anna please give some details about them . 
  since love of cheese has become another russian stereotype , i shall embrace it and ask you to tell us about different cheeses from your country . 
  if you 're from italy , france or switzerland , then please tell us about cheeses of your specific region . 
  what do the soldiers shout when they charge the enemy ? 
  something you bet few other people know . 
  can be history , geography , culture , anything . 
  i am not talking about ethnic minorities like sorbs or basques or roma . 
  what i want is a subethnic group which can be used in the following exchange :  - are people from * group * ethnic * titular ethnicity * ? 
   - yes , but ... for example , `` are irish travellers ethnic irish ? 
  yes , but ... '', 
  let 's say a person comes to a house in your country for a visit and brings a box of biscuits/cookies as a gift to the host . 
  they might be a friend , a coworker or a relative . 
  what will happen to the box ? 
  and if your old culture was remarkably not sexist , tell us about that as well . 
  we all know that people in the country just beyond the border are the worst . 
  tell us a joke that proves that . 
  what do most children think places `` once upon a time '' looked like ? 
  to promote pan-european peace and cooperation , let 's recall our favourite sparring partners . 
  do you eat wheat , rye , oats , rice , maize , barley , millet , buckwheat ? 
  anything else beyond this list ? 
  itt : people unironically confusing cereals with breakfast cereals, 
  i am sure every country on the wrong side of the iron curtain had its own share of ponzi schemes in the 90 's . 
  if you do n't remember , [ heffalumps ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clnadkgurvc ) are elephant-looking fictional monsters from * winnie-the-pooh * . 
  edit : turns out , winnie-the-pooh has different names in other countries , too . 
  residents of some cities have it easy : - berlin - berliner - london - londoner - paris - parisien some demonyms are weird : - manchester - mancunian - saint-jean-le-blanc - albijohanicien - oxford - oxonian are there people in your country you ca n't say where they are from without making a mistake ? 
  most militaries use special words for `` yes '' , `` no '' and `` order acknowledged '' to eliminate ambiguity . 
  what are they in your country ? 
  feel free to add radio protocol as well . 
  it 's time to revive our weekly cooking and cuisine threads . 
  do people eat mushrooms in your country/region other than sliced button mushrooms on frozen pizza ? 
  do they gather them themselves or buy them ? 
  what are the most common mushrooms eaten ? 
  what 's the most popular mushroom dish ? 
  the spring is in full bloom and some european countries can already boast of fresh local herbs and vegetables . 
  what 's in season in your country/region and what can you cook with them ? 
  or are you still finishing last year 's potatoes ? 
  so , i 've had some time on my hands and i 've come up with yet another latinisation of russian . 
  being a dirty imperialist that i am , i have also latinised ukrainian and belorussian alphabets without asking them or paying too much attention . 
  ** tl ; dr go check out the examples in the comments , i 'm especially interested in what speakers of western and southern slavic languages think . 
  ** while designing the transformation rules , i strived to follow the following guidelines : 1 . 
  do not reinvent the wheel , reuse existing spelling conventions of western and southern slavic languages 2 . 
  most common cyrillic spellings should have the simplest latin transformations 3 . 
  transformations should be reversible as much as possible ( although we can not hope for serbo-croatian 1:1 correspondence ) 4 . 
  utilized letters should be available on legacy computer systems 5 . 
  the transformation rules should be consistent and unified note that there 's no requirement to fit into iso basic latin alphabet ( a-z ) . 
  now we have reached the hardest part , linked with russian vowel pairs and palatalization . 
  we have several pairs of vowels : group 1 , the second vowel palatalizes preceding consonants and is combined with a voiced palatal approximant otherwise : - \u0410\u0430-\u042f\u044f - \u041e\u043e-\u0401\u0451 - \u0423\u0443-\u042e\u044e group 2 , just like group 1 , but \u0415\u0435 is much more common than \u042d\u044d - \u042d\u044d-\u0415\u0435 group 3 , \u0418\u0438 palatalizes preceding consonants and is much more common than \u042b\u044b - \u042b\u044b-\u0418\u0438 group 3 is the easiest one to solve : ii is obviously the best choice for \u0418\u0438 , while yy is a good choice for \u042b\u044b . 
  the phonemes are different as well , so using different letters is fine . 
  group 2 is not very different from group 1 , the only distinction is that \u0415\u0435 will be represented as ee in one form or another , since it 's one of the most common letters . 
  otherwise these two groups are identical . 
  to proceed further , i have to explain the purposes of hard and soft signs , \u044a and \u044c . 
  hard sign is used to separate a vowel that palatalizes consonants from the preceding consonant : '' \u0441\u0435\u043b '' is pronounced / s\u02b2el / , while '' \u0441\u044a\u0435\u043b '' is pronounced like '' \u0441 \u0435\u043b '' , / sjel / . 
  soft sign always palatalizes the preceding consonant and separates the vowels that palatalize consonants : '' \u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c '' is pronounced / s\u02b2el\u02b2 / , while '' \u0441\u044c\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0430 '' is pronounced like '' \u0441\u044c \u0435\u0440\u0440\u0430 '' , / s\u02b2jerra / . 
  that means we have to cover four spelling cases for our vowels plus take into account trailing soft signs : - \u044f\u0441 - \u0441\u044f - \u0441\u044c\u044f - \u0441\u044a\u044f - \u0441\u044c option 1 is to come up with a single letter and use it everywhere . 
  this means we need separate letters for hard and soft signs . 
  the soft sign could share the symbol with \u0419\u0439 ( jj ) , since their placement in unambiguous . 
  the hard sign could use the apostrophe : - \u044f\u0441 = qs - \u0441\u044f = sq - \u0441\u044c\u044f = sjq - \u0441\u044a\u044f = s ' q - \u0441\u044c = sj option 2 is to combine explicit yods for voiced palatal approximants with new letters . 
  i 'll use q as a placeholder , since i 'll come to the letter choice later . 
  in this case we need a sign to represent either the hard or the soft sign ( depending on whether j is auto-palatalizing or not ) , i propose to use the apostrophe : option 2a , soft sign apostrophe : - \u044f\u0441 = jqs - \u0441\u044f = sq - \u0441\u044c\u044f = s ` jq - \u0441\u044a\u044f = sjq - \u0441\u044c = s ' option 2b , hard sign apostrophe : - \u044f\u0441 = jqs - \u0441\u044f = sq - \u0441\u044c\u044f = sjq - \u0441\u044a\u044f = s ` jq - \u0441\u044c = sj option 3 is option 2 where combinations with ` j' use the simplest letter possible , this reduces the number of diacritics : option 3a , soft sign apostrophe : - \u044f\u0441 = jas - \u0441\u044f = sq - \u0441\u044c\u044f = s ` ja - \u0441\u044a\u044f = sja - \u0441\u044c = s ' option 3b , hard sign apostrophe : - \u044f\u0441 = jas - \u0441\u044f = sq - \u0441\u044c\u044f = sja - \u0441\u044a\u044f = s ` ja - \u0441\u044c = sj option 4 is option 2/3 with explicit palatalization , but \u042d\u044d gets in the way of its implementation . 
  it will only work if hard sign apostrophe is used : - \u044f\u0441 = jas - \u0441\u044f = sja - \u0441\u044c\u044f = sjja - \u0441\u044a\u044f = s ` ja - \u0441\u044c = sj - \u0441\u044d = s ' e out of four options the third one ( b ) is my favourite . 
  option 1 is very straightforward , but i do n't like the looks of the resulting language . 
  option 2 is more complicated than option 3 , but provides no benefits .
