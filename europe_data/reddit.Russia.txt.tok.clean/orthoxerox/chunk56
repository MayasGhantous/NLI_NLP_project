  option 4 works better for the language version that uses no letters outside the basic latin alphabet . 
  soft signs are more common than hard signs , so the longer `` s ` ja '' will be a rare combination . 
  now we reach the question of choosing correct diacritics . 
  we need a , o and u to share one , and e to use another . 
  i originally preferred circumflexes : - \u0422\u044e , \u041b\u0451\u0441\u044f !, 
  but there 's no \u00fb in iso 8859-2 . 
  all three are present in iso 8859-16 , but this codepage does n't have a good option for \u042d\u044d , other than \u00e6 : acute accent is used to mark stress in russian , grave is too similar , circumflex is taken , diaresis is too confusing . 
  therefore i had to resort to diareses : - \u0422\u044e , \u041b\u0451\u0441\u044f !, 
  \u042d\u044d is then naturally represented by \u011a\u011b anywhere where it follows a palatalizable consonant : - \u042d\u0442\u043e \u043c\u044d\u0442\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u041b\u0430\u044d\u0440\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 = eto m\u011btr aleksandr laertskij the only thing left to reform is the edge cases : 1 . 
  consonants that either can not be or are always palatalized ( \u017d , \u0160 , c , j , \u0106 , \u015a ) are always followed by unmarked vowels ( or i ) : - \u0426\u044b = ci - \u0416\u044e = \u017du - \u0428\u0451 = \u0160o - \u0416\u044d = \u017de 2 . 
  consonants that either can not be palatalized or are always palatalized ( \u017d , \u0160 , c , j , \u0106 , \u015a ) are not followed by j unless it 's a yod : - \u0420\u043e\u0436\u044c = ro\u017e - \u0421\u044a\u0435\u0448\u044c = sje\u0161 - \u041c\u043e\u0449\u044c = mo\u015b - \u041d\u043e\u0447\u044c = no\u0107 - \u0447\u044c\u0451 = \u0107jo 3 . 
  mustard : moscow fat combine mayo : i stopped buying mayo , but for salads it 's moscow fat combine again ketchup : i do n't eat ketchup, 
  or as my wife calls them , old man shoes . 
  tough luck , she threw out a pair she did n't like , i went and bought a new identical one . 
  in english - gangster rappers ' rivalry in russian - west bank ( palestine ), 
  foreign architects someone in the street might know : - gaudi - foster `` local '' architects : - rastrelli ( winter palace , peterhof , lots of other palaces in st pete ) - thon ( the original catherdral of christ the saviour , multiple buildings within the kremlin ), 
  well , the neth have the same pop density as moscow + oblast , and there are enough uninhabited places in the oblast . 
  i do n't think that 's too high . 
  germany . 
  good infrastructure , industry , sea and mountains . 
  also , enough space for all of us . 
  france is bigger , though , so maybe france , not germany .

  the best man from fryazino is a timeless meme . 
  : dddddd, 
  just across the misty river . 
  i would go to italy and spain , but i am russian , and our summers are a parody of southern winters . 
  as an aussie you should definitely go to austria . 
  and one of the northern countries with lots of snow . 
  now ? 
  meat-shaped wino . 
  in his prime ? 
  one of the best french actors . 
  not really . 
  if/when we start functioning as an actual federation , some mergers will be inevitable , as some federal subjects are practically bankrupt . 
  to this day i have no clue how to lock the pump . 
  sometimes is stays locked , sometimes not . 
  is there a button i have to press ? 
  west : european climate , high-ish population density , high population , agriculture is common . 
  far east : harsh climate , extremely low population density , low population , economic ties with china and japan , mining , fishing and forestry are common . 
  south : mild climate , lots of agriculture , fricative `` g '' , highland tribes , seaside and skiing resorts . 
  north : polar climate , military bases , oil wells , reindeer herder tribes , unexpected prosperous villages of pomors and baptists , extremely low population density . 
  ha , i do n't know any either . 
  i had a colleague who some people claimed was one ( he had these impudent eyes the chechens are known for ) , but he was a russian so kind and meek he could inherit the earth all by himself . 
  [ it sadly looks like this ] ( http://varlamov.ru/2225584.html ) . 
  if you could n't tell russian and czech apart i would be rather worried . 
   three main highways out of tallinn tartu , st. pete and riga ? 
  wait , did n't they have a song in the hunger games ? 
  germany has ( or used to have ) this tiny cardboard clock you put under a dashboard when parking is time-limited . 
  greece has ( or had ) a passenger narrow-gauge rail network that is not a repurposed peat or lumber railway . 
  uk has really small london tube trains . 
  both london and berlin subways have platforms that are shared by several lines . 
  oh , i had to use that buzzer last weekend for the first time . 
  they should give them as boarding passes . 
   and bathrooms are too small how small are they ? 
  here an average bathroom is 1.70 x1 .70 ( the loo is in a separate closet ) and a washing machine fits there just fine . 
   i 've also been surprised that the pedestrian traffic lights in the us allow one to start crossing the road only for a very short period of time , then all lights are red , and pedestrians are only supposed to finish crossing there 's a light like that in vienna ( someehere on the principal road of josefstadt ) . 
  made me nervous every time i had to cross that road .

  our textbooks contain both theory and exercises , you would need two sets of them to avoid carrying them to school and back home . 
  if they were split , then the textbook could stay in the school locker , and the book with homework assignments would stay at home .

  i do n't know who 's the middle class in russia . 
  upper class is people who do n't have to work for a living . 
  the most lower class thing is probably a vacation or a wedding loan . 
  i would say the most middle class thing is worrying about the savings .

  it 's the yellow sun high up in the blue sky or something . 
  that 's because every other episodic actor playing russians in american or british films is a pole . 
   i mean sure we 're small , but not that small . 
  yes you are , your wife keeps lying to you . 
  not gon na get us ? 
  multiple hits . 
  for russia i would probably nominated pyotr yershov , the author of the `` hunchback horselet '' , an immensely popular fairytale . 
  he has n't written anything else of note , so there 's a conspiracy theory that it was pushkin who wrote it . 
  i was going to say danilov and moiseenko with their [ `` rabbits '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3zzqmlp11m ) sketch , but they are technically ukrainian . 
  they , however , have been milking it for more than 30 years . 
  they are very common here in russia . 
  after a few years the central bank stepped in and tightened the rules , but you still can get a loan for 2 % per * diem * . 
  the biggest player on the market right now is otp finance from hungary , but i think they are not a microfinance company , more of a millifinance . 
   za zdorovie i would say '' ( za ) vashe zdorovye '' . 
   however , she got it mixed up with `` nasrat '' and toasted with that , much to everyone 's great confusion . 
  oh my fucking god , i 'm literally laughing out loud . 
  the latter , since using a vpn probably triggers some red flag in some fsb database . 
  [ this song with yesenin 's poem as lyrics ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9oy3v4odak ) [ the anthem of moscow , of course ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaz4m_j7txk ) these two songs above can be mixed and matched for comedic effect . 
  [ this song by gazmanov ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvuqlh4zazk ) is rather well-known , you can hear it at every public festival in moscow . 
  [ this song by magomayev ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krt_uvhz094 ) or [ sung together with bravo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft6tzmkg3la ) is called * the best city on earth * . 
  [ oh , and a song about moscow-st . pete long distance relationship ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzxfxekwn38 ) , do n't let drunk 30-somethings see it in a karaoke menu . 
  [ oh , and how could i have forgotten this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ugivnryfjc ) , leningrad always has baller music videos . 
  he 's the original trump . 
  not very smart , but very vain and sure of himself .
