  the orange one tasted like orange-flavoured candy or gum . 
  a chinese tourist wanted to take a picture of me and my wife in vladimir .

  they might 've made the switch to the more natural one , i have n't had it for a long time . 
  what country should he attack next , timurids or crimea ? 
  stopping past the stop line ( in front of the zebra crossing ) on intersections . 
  driving in the left lane on rural roads . 
  we could go to war to enforce the spelling of '' \u043d\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0435 '' and '' \u0431\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a '' .

  speaking of money , one foster family here with 8 kids in their care boiled one alive ( they say by mistake ) and was so afraid of losing the rest and the money ( they parented full-time and had no other income ) they came up with an idea of kidnapping a boy that looked like the dead one . 
  what 's the number of the din standard for kitchen dimensions ? 
  i do n't think i can . 
  lack of contraception and sex education would be my best guess . 
  many of them are not really orphans with dead parents , quite a few are abandoned after birth . 
  the number has actually decreased significantly over the past ten years , despite everything you 've mentioned . 
  i have no idea how . 
  in 2014 we had almost half a million orphans , but only about 17 % of them were in state foster homes , the rest were in private foster care of various kinds . 
  only a few thousand get adopted ( as in , you are their parent from every legal point bar biological paternity/maternity ) every year , though .
