  at least in moscow state foster care provides the kids with an apartment when they graduate . 
  many of them have no experience owning property and sell it for peanuts to some crooks . 
  the marginally smarter ones team up , live together in one apartment ( they are used to dorm life ) and rent out the rest . 
  do they meet each other for an * aperitivo * ? 
   the purpose of german language is to put the knowledge of the whole mankind into a single word . 
  to put it between two parts of a splittable verb , you mean ? 
  but are n't the cupboards usually fitted to the dimensions of the specific kitchen ? 
  there 's a picture of mccartney in lennon 's kitchen or vice versa that is often used by pro-soviet trolls in bait-and-switch attacks where they first use it to mock poor soviet living conditions . 
  there 's a set of pictures somewhere on the net showing a polish-soviet war with warmechs and trained animal companions . 
  poles use bears while the soviets use tigers . 
  i am on vacation , so i had some cold cuts and cheese with bread and several crepes with strawberry jam . 
  i 'd rather squat than sit on some dodgy seat . 
  it 's an eagle , but outward memetic pressure has made us adopt the bear . 
  it 's not the most flattering animal , i 'll tell you that . 
  see my answer to sigakoer above , i might 've been wrong about it . 
  hm , i must 've been mislead . 
  the [ official document recognizing the independence ] ( http://www.libussr.ru/doc_ussr/usr_19438.htm ) does n't directly specify whether they consider the new estonian state to be a new state or the continuation of the old one . 
  some more updates . 
  [ here ] ( http://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/2030048 ) the position of russia is detailed as `` estonia 's legal successor was the estonian ssr , therefore the treaty of tartu has been superseded by the administrative borders of the essr . 
  the new estonia is the legal successor of the essr , therefore these agreements are still valid and more relevant than the old treaty '' . 
  treaty of tartu does n't count , since we consider estonia to form in 1991 . 
  marc chagall - russia , belarus , france . 
  just like the sweetest part of the watermenlon is in the center , so are the swiss alps the best alps . 
  it depends on the level of religiosity . 
  converts are usually very religious ( you do n't convert to another religion to ignore it , after all ) , so one would make me wary of them . 
  just like people who spend their vacation in a monastery or sponsor chapels do . 
  being born a muslim is fine for a politician . 
  yes i do . 
  maybe twice a week . 
  cucumbers , tomatoes , peppers , cabbage , watermelons , apples , various berries , various mushrooms , various fish - pickling is big in russia . 
  of the pre-revolution families the mamontovs are the most famous because savva mamontov was a great patron of the arts . 
  post-ussr are rather quiet about their wealth . 
  they * do * flaunt it abroad , but they are primarily known as the owners of businesses , the money is not old enough yet . 
   rich fugger fug : - dddd, 
  for the reference : the project being discussed is a plan to demolish khruschev-era mass-produced blocks of flats . 
  some are really dilapidated , and the residents are happy to get a new flat . 
  some are rather good , despite the flats being cramped compared to modern ones : they have brick walls , the streets outside are covered in old trees , the location is good . 
  their residents do not want a new flat . 
  some houses are divided , and we all know what that means . 
  as usual , the approach taken by the moscow government was boorish and heavy-handed . 
  the initial bill did n't set the criteria for marking the houses for demolition , did n't explain the valuation rules for your flat , did n't adequately specify the process of voting for excluding your house from the programme , absentee votes would be counted for demolition , and the voting itself was initiated before the law was signed . 
  the final version of the law is better , but people are still angry , especially those who own flats in houses where the supermajority is pro-demolition . 
  they pickle watermelons in the south , but here in moscow we eat the raw and ripe and without any additives . 
  i do n't think we have many . 
  \u041c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0440\u044f\u043a\u043e\u0432 ( meschera ) , but that 's stretching it . 
  do n't . 
  smiling and making faces at kids is absolutely fine . 
  you 're not giving a half-melted sticky caramel candy from the abyssal bottoms of your purse to them , are you ? 
  our kids folklore includes a whole bunch of japanese names : - geisha atomuli yadalato ( `` did i put out for the right guy ? '' ), 
  - racer toyama tokanawa ( `` first a pothole then a ditch '' ) - footballer tomimo tokoso ( `` first a miss then off the mark '' ) - doctor komuto herowato ( `` someone feels like shit '' ) - another footballer nakatika yawyebuka ( `` throw it to me , i 'll give a fucking shot '' ) romanians : - sri bestrescu ( `` do n't fart when you shit '' ) - vzad stamescu ( `` a chisel up your arse '' ) czechs : - macal ko\u0161ek ( `` groped cats '' ) - macal kuro\u010dek ( `` groped hens '' ), 
  do you know the proper german term for den fenster ? 
  avocado , tomato , chocolate . 
  most people use \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c for both , since there 's no ambiguity . 
  \u041a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c / \u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c - the first one means `` to place , to put down '' , the second one does n't exist . 
  but since many other location - and position-related verbs use \u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c as the base ( \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c , \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c , \u0432\u044b\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c , \u0443\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c , etc ) , nsver \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c , many people use \u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c . 
  at least 95 % of russians can not decline a cardinal number over 199 . 
  or even maybe over 20 . 
  but i do n't think the public want to reform any of these , they just do n't care . 
  how 's \u0439 hard for you ? 
  is n't it the sound of i griega ? 
  palatalized consonants . 
  everyone tries to stick a yod in there : gromyko was mister \u041d\u0435\u0442 / n ^ j et / , not mister \u041d\u044a\u0435\u0442 / njet / . 
  see this video for an example : https://youtu.be/m7nn7dfpwsy, 
  shaurma . 
  pete and his goons manhandling the swiss train conductor was one of my first erotic experiences . 
  almost no one says \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a other than petersburgers . 
  we have obi , leroy merlin , \u0422\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0414\u043e\u043c , plus small shops where the walls are covered with small , but commonly needed stuff : no dimensional lumber or vesa mounts , but some pots , pans , nails , screws , extension cords , switches , lightbulbs , insulation tape etc. 
  the pronunciation of / \u0433 / . 
  plosive in the north , fricative in the south . 
  least favourite : air quality . 
  favourite : availability of everything . 
  ukrainian accent is very strong and differs a lot from the central russian one . 
  but there 's no sharp border , people in two donetsks speak practically the same . 
  there must be a standard bladder somewhere in the finnish chamber of weights and measures . 
  slartibartfast knew what he was doing . 
  no , it 's very uncommon . 
  we have free russia square in moscow , but that 's probably it . 
  i do n't find it universally russian . 
  getting rather common in moscow . 
  of course , instead of building centralized hvac systems in new blocks of flats developers simply added decorative boxes for the external ac modules to their blueprints . 
  you 're in for a treat : http://www.eca.europa.eu/other%20publications/en_terminology_publication/en_terminology_publication.pdf, 
  [ this painting ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/levitan_nad_vech_pok28.jpg ) is commonly quoted to encapaulate the essence of russia . 
  i 'd also nominate [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/\u0423_\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439_\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u044b.jpg ) as well . 
  and probably something by shishkin ( not the fucking bears , of course ) , but nothing really stands out , he must be ingested as the whole corpus . 
  leavened pancakes . 
  porridges . 
  alabama 3 . 
  this building in moscow is surprisingly not painful to look at , when you ca n't see the blue-tinted windows . 
  red is good . 
  it 's called `` begging to be t-boned '' . 
   his nationality belarusian or lithuanian ? 
  in moscow , no one except the police and the child services . 
  you should give at least a ten-minute warning , but be quick about your visit if it 's unplanned . 
   lost my cool passive aggression is not really losing your cool . 
  i 'd 've expected you to throw the guy out of the queue . 
  germany , i guess . 
  leipzig at 8pm looked like they were expecting a raf bombing , everything shuttered and not a soul in sight . 
  no , deep-fried , frittierte pizza . 
  no , i wish you all the best and stay in good mood and good health . 
  these words should be cast in stone .
