  if gm crops were open sourced and any farmer could produce those infertile f1 hybrids themselves , i would be much less worried about gm crops . 
  invade every non-nato state in europe before they join nato , treat the population old testament style , except turn the boys into janissaries and send them to guard our border with china . 
  relocate the russians into now vacant homes . 
  putin does n't sound so evil now , does he ? 
  i 'll write a serious reply later . 
  how long did it take for przemysl to be considered polish ? 
  do n't forget to paint the fence green and yellow . 
  northern : the ones with nordic crosses on their flags . 
  western : ireland , uk , benelux , france , andorra . 
  central : germany , austria , switzerland , liechtenstein . 
  southern : spain , portugal , italy , san marino , malta , ex-yu , albania , bolgaria , greece , cyprus . 
  eastern : czech rep , poland , slovakia , hungary , romania , moldova , the baltic states , belarus , russia , ukraine , dnr , lnr :p dubious : turkey , georgia , armenia , azerbaijan , israel , kazakhstan . 
  sort of like gamma is pronounced in modern greek . 
  there must be some differences between modern greek , southern russian and ukraininan ` g ' , but i 'm not a linguist and they sound the same to me . 
  since russia is so big , we have many words for backwater places : * \u0423\u0440\u044e\u043f\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a ( uryupinsk ) - a real town , even i had to look up its location . 
  * \u041c\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0441\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a ( mukhosransk ) - `` flycrapton '' , not real , of course , though there 's a place called musokhranovo . 
  * \u041a\u0438\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0440\u0438\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a ( kislodrishchensk ) - `` sourshitston '' * \u0423\u0441\u0442\u044c-\u041f\u0438\u0437\u0434\u044e\u0439\u0441\u043a ( ust-pizdyuysk ) - `` cunt-by-the-estuary '' , ust-something is a common name for a locality at an estuary . 
  * \u0415\u0431\u0435\u043d\u044f , \u0437\u0430\u0436\u043e\u043f\u044c\u0435 ( yebenya , zazhopye ) - these swear words describe a generally remote place , not a stereotypical remote town . 
  * \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e-\u0415\u0431\u0435\u043d\u0451\u0432\u043e ( novo-yebenyovo ) - `` new hinterfucks '' , a perfect name for that new housing project at the outskirts . 
  * \u0425\u0443\u0435\u0432\u043e-\u041a\u0443\u043a\u0443\u0435\u0432\u043e ( khuyevo-kukuyevo ) - `` dicks-in-the-sticks '' , it 's either a remote village or a moscow satellite town , since both often have double names . 
  if there 's some tongue involved , then you 're right , it is a french kiss !, 
  but that 's not sex , 
  i work for a large private company , and b-2 managers are about 50 per cent women . 
  b-1 positions - under 25 . 
  board members ? 
  currently zero . 
  we do n't like ours either . 
  they are also slavic , if they ask us for them , how can we refuse our friends ? 
  i personally would n't mind russia joining the eu . 
  it 's a shame we have so many things to take care of before we can . 
  i am not a linguist , but i have n't encountered any sex slang that references a specific country . 
  things like `` french love '' or `` greek love '' sound very bookish to me in russian . 
  it 's not even the politicians ' thing . 
  they care about oil , not people . 
  most people like serbs and do n't like `` fucking pszeks '' and now `` fucking banderovites '' as well . 
  they also do n't care about the rest . 
  you 've almost made me laugh out loud and wake my son with your wine name . 
  shall i send you some georgian wine , \u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d0\u10e1\u10e1\u10d0\u10da\u10d8 , for example ? 
  the swamps of russia . 
  there 's a * huge * bog east of tver with an island big enough for three villages that you ca n't reach by car . 
  another one is a np straddling the border of pskov and novgorod oblasts , reachable from the baltics . 
  what about bolotov and mozgovoy ? 
  i know they 're locals , but what is their motivation ? 
  as for the conflict itself , i do n't think putin or whoever he 's delegated this to has any plans to help separatists win . 
  he 's going to let them lose , but the process will be long and painful . 
  the more time it will take , the more opportunities for ukrainian army/ng/volunteers to do something stupid that can be turned into a news item for domestic or even ukrainian and worldwide consumption . 
  every single russian volunteer coming back in a coffin means less headache for fsb . 
  i guess every ukrainian volunteer coming back in a coffin means less headache for sbu . 
  the longer the conflict , the more money is spent on it and will have to be spent on rebuilding donbass . 
  poorer ukraine is easier to negotiate with . 
  i think balut is from philippines . 
  but you still have orolan or what 's it called ? 
  it must be very hard not to invent apple pie if you have apples and dough . 
  yes , we know you like pork , not fish . 
  lots and lots of pork . 
  i 've been waiting for this to make an appearance . 
  as a russian , i present to you [ pastila from belev ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sbqdpyr.jpg ) . 
  [ belev ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belev ) is a small town that was once contested between moscow and lithuania ( check out its location ) and that was famous for its fruit puree ( pastila ) confectionery before the revolution . 
  pastila is made of pureed [ antonovka ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antonovka ) apples , beaten egg whites and honey or sugar . 
  they are combined into foam and baked in an oven into pinkie-thick sheets . 
  then these sheets are cut and glued into loaves using more egg whites and baked again until spongy , but firm . 
  the texture of pastila reminds me of dense sourdough bread , but the taste is great , like you 're eating the essense of apples . 
  yep , the official story goes : * liberal and pro-western * members of the elite invited polish king to rule russia after everyone got tired of polish * meddling * in russian * internal * affairs , but a popular uprising of * true patriots * thwarted this attempt and kicked the poles out of kremlin . 
  after that russia went on to liberate western russian lands from poland and kind got carried away . 
  point google translate or what have you towards [ this ] ( http://www.ruslit.net/popadanets.php ) and weep in ecstasy . 
  and ukrainians as well . 
  most canadian ukrainians come from the k.u.k. 
  part of ukraine , as well as the most eager supporters of euromaidan . 
  because they 're hilarious . 
  `` russian paratrooper vasiliy is transported into the 30th century and becomes the only hope of planet earth against the murderous hordes of pan-galactoamerican semitomacaques '' . 
  oh , wow , where do i start ... 
  some skeletons are so well-known they are paraded across eastern europe on carnival floats , but what about our internal skeletons ? 
  tambov uprising , where we used chemical weapons against the peasants . 
  all those anonymous notes that nkvd acted upon ? 
  nkvd did n't write them , our great-grandparents did . 
  the way we 've outsourced the pacification of chechnya to kadyrov . 
  the ossuary is deep . 
  are there any streets named after kuusinen in finland ? 
  i remember reading a d-k travel guide to the baltics that , while quite often describing the lively pre-war jewish culture of latvia and lithuania , declined to mention every time the reason why it practically disappeared . 
  we challenge you to a skeleton-off !, 
  two congos . 
  i know the big one with a micropenis coastline was leopold 's , but i mix up the names and the capitals . 
  what about the 4th of november , the day of liberating russia from poland ? 
  fixed it , thanks , 
  thank god our pop songs are so horrible no one outside russia knows them . 
  ppk and tatu are the only exceptions . 
  time to make things right and rape your ears . 
  i present to you this horrible 2013 megahit : [ natalie - oh god , what a man , i want a son from you , i want a daughter from you , full stop !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syaf3jeb7xc ), 
  then putin comes and tells you to pick 2 out of 3 , 
  not that often . 
  i do n't swear at other drivers when my son or mil are in the car . 
  i do n't drink and do n't have a dashcam . 
  shot a helluva load of ibexes and started wwi . 
  how else am i supposed to keep my feet clean ? 
  before the mongols came it was even better . 
  every single prince in the land was your cousin !, 
  scheming was literally going on non-stop , since every year someone in your extended family died or got married and upset the existing balance . 
  not the worst , but not my favourite . 
  i do n't rank our monarchs by the depth of their penetration into europe .
