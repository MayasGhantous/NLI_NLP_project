  5 - excellent 4 - good 3 - satisfactory 2 - unsatisfactory 1 - you have to really piss the teacher off to get this one, 
  we have a \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f cinema , a chocolate factory and a moscow-vladivostok train . 
  more like , `` it 's a thing in ukraine , not a soviet thing '' . 
  she is and she looks vaguely french . 
  vermont is the most progressive state , but everything is so tiny compared to moscow . 
  nyc and california are nice , but the cost of living is too high . 
  the nature is northern arizona/southern utah gives me a hardon , but there are n't any big cities and many job opportunities there . 
  so i guess it 'll most likely be portland or seattle , if i can tune out sjws and marijuana enthusiasts . 
  tough threatening guys/country . 
  it 's nice to be feared , but it 's nicer to be liked . 
  180cm , that is average height or maybe 1 cm above average . 
  it 's still weird and funny , though . 
  christmas logs that shit presents . 
  i think it 's a catalan thing , not spanish , though . 
  daily . 
  maybe they live next to ramstein afb ? 
  they basically look like [ this ] ( http://varlamov.ru/2389301.html ) . 
  they are modern and tall and stand too close together . 
  hearty schi . 
  moscow is still growing , so the developers are building lots of new commieblocks around it , completely ignoring infrastructure . 
  to quote our vice-pm , the funniest thing is , people actually buy them and live there . 
  our mayor now has an ambitious plan to demolish all khruschov-era commieblocks and build new houses there . 
  the residents of the better ( brick ) ones are not that happy , since he wants to take several shortcuts across existing laws to avoid dealing with holdouts . 
  nukes can be detected en route . 
  stray cats are common , stray dogs are less common now , you can find them only on fenced territories like construction sites or factories or research facilities . 
  detonating thermonuclear mines along american coasts , wiping out most of their population and industry with 100m-tall tsunami waves . 
  because everything here 's done \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u0436\u043e\u043f\u0443 , `` through the ass '' . 
  to austria , canada , germany or the uk . 
  nothing surprising , social liberalism . 
  because they have close to zero accountability and mostly care only about their `` cases closed '' kpi . 
  yes . 
  anglicised as sid , todd and kim ? 
  i 'm mildly disgusted by their spelling rules . 
  i 'm mildly disgusted by their spelling rules . 
  i doubt even police officers themselves trust each other . 
  i like the version where the genie says he will grant any wish , but then will double the reward and grant it to his neighbor . 
  the man thinks for a while and says , `` fine , poke my eye out '' . 
  julian calendar . 
  russia works from the top . 
  it would become the most gay friendly country if xavier was in charge . 
  we are already in a union state . 
  macron leaves a good impression , but he has n't proven himself yet . 
  maybe xavier bettel or the swiss council . 
  i have n't lost hope that we can get a proper government yet . 
  we technically are a secular state , but christmas ( 7th jan ) is a state holiday . 
  it is moved to the next working day . 
  we also have like 10 holidays right after the new year . 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  in russia we get 28 days off , weekends included , national holidays are not included . 
  you must take at least 14 consecutive days off every year . 
  you can take monday to friday off or take friday * and * monday off , but this affects your pay . 
  there 's a complex formula that penalizes you for having weekends adjacent to your vacation . 
  sick days are sick days . 
  you need a special proof of sickness from a clinic , though . 
  marriage , birth or death of a close relative entitle you to three paid days off plus two unpaid ones if you want . 
  you have to use your vacation each year , but if you have unused days , the company has to pay you for them when you leave . 
  i would choose ukraine . 
  it was a civil war , but in the middle of 1919 the situation looked rather dire for the bolsheviks . 
  and put them in a drain closet . 
  should they call her yak-kveline instead ? 
  it looks like a miscarriage . 
  the ugliest is # 7 on [ this list ] ( http://varlamov.ru/1735302.html ) . 
  the rest are also worthy of demolition ( nb : on the moscow city photo he 's talking only about the orange-tinted skyscraper on the right ) . 
  the most beautiful ? 
  now that 's a hard question . 
  i am a huge art deco and gothic fan , so a lot of the architecture here just does n't resonate with me . 
  i like [ the interior of `` aeroport '' metro station ] ( https://www.google.ru/search?q=\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f+\u0430\u044d\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442&amp;tbm=isch ) . 
  well , friday nights in essex are anything but posh ... 
  no , practically everyone has the whole summer off . 
  42 more , please . 
  greeting people by shaking hands sounds 100 % normal to me , both in professional and casual environments . 
  you would n't shake hands with a shop assistant , of course . 
  moscow is big , loud , expensive and dirty , but i do n't know if i could trade it for a small town where everyone is a real individual and not seemingly procedurally generated . 
  london , maybe . 
  one million sized cities , are they closer to gta or harvest moon in ambience ? 
  i find the lyrics too ... passive . 
  `` russia great , russia big , russia valuable , russia big , russia unique , lots of opportunities ahead , russia needs your love '' . 
  i would prefer something along the lines of `` short history lesson to explain why we 're here . 
  this is what we all should do to live in an even better country . '', 
  there 's an autobahn and a railway nearby . 
  no big airports , though . 
  yes !, 
  it 's a part of the seltschach ski resort , is n't it ? 
  i think op meant documentaries . 
  i do n't think we have or had any where the operator rode in the squad car . 
   hippocleides was he the first breakdancer in recorded history ? 
  our constitutional court is in st pete . 
  the move was controversial , since it was senseless and expensive . 
  fascist is a common insult that applies equally well to everyone . 
  liberast ( liberal + pederast ) is an insult for liberals . 
  tolerast ( tolerance + pederast ) is an insult for socially liberal . 
  elf is another insult for liberals , implying their views are magical and not grounded in reality . 
  sovok ( literally dustpan ) is an insult for a soviet union fan . 
  vatnik ( cotton-wool-lined coat ) is an insult for a small-minded pro-putin conservative . 
  you ca n't really offend anyone by calling them a socialist or a communist . 
  as you must 've guessed , yes . 
  maybe twice or thrice a month . 
  \u0160kodovka sounds like a distilled beverage . 
  no , it 's tradition . 
  fuck ukraine , marry germany , kill poland .
