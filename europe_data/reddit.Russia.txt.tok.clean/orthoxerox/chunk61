  i think we might 've started already ... 
  if he had retired in 2008 , i 'm sure we would be erecting statues of him now . 
  first of all , i would go back to white-azure-scarlet instead of white-blue-red . 
  second , i would replace the flag with an azure cross splitting the field into cantons . 
  top left and bottom right ones would be white , the other two would be scarlet . 
  as a finishing touch , i would place four historical emblems in the cantons , clockwise from the top left : vladimir 's tamga for ancient rus and to troll the ukraine , st. george and the dragon for moscow , two-headed eagle for the empire and hammer and sickle for the su . 
  this flag would only by used by the state , civilians would be allowed to display only the flag with empty cantons . 
  boreal coniferous forest covering a huge chunk of russia . 
  we do n't have this problem , because no one gives a fuck what the locals think . 
  but you can move out into the taiga and live as one if you want . 
  dude , they were czech , relax . 
  and talk with each other in czech ? 
  many places will not accept unchipped cards , especially self-service machines . 
  i do n't think most cards in the us are chipped , so bring more cash and do n't carry it all with you . 
  no one knows what traveller 's cheques are . 
  yes , we spend too much . 
  very similar to russian , except we call sunday \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435 / voskresenjje , resurrection . 
  which is what catholic nutjobs should call sunday , not us . 
  - \u0411\u0430\u0431\u043a\u0438 / babki - old women , the most common word . 
  - \u0411\u0430\u0431\u043b\u043e / bablo , \u0431\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0441\u044b / babosy - nonsense derivatives of babki . 
  - \u041b\u0430\u0432\u044d / lav ' e - i think it 's roma for money . 
  - \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u044f\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 / derevjannyje - wooden , when talking about roubles .

  russians are n't named marketa or zuzana . 
  it looks good on bikinis . 
  for the same reason the berlin wall fell . 
  some bureaucrat misspoke and did n't backtrack . 
  are sugus like fruitella , but with a more synthetic taste ? 
  it says on the wrapper they are 3 + only . 
  shchi , a cabbage soup . 
  i especially like it when the cabbage is young and green . 
  mature cabbage can make it too sweet . 
  shaurma . 
  or , since it 's not allowed to sell it in moscow , `` chicken in a flatbread wrap that is totally not shaurma '' . 
  and you ca n't pass between two people talking there or in ingushetia . 
  we used russian customary units . 
  they now survive only in idioms . 
  well , kettlebells are still cast in multiples or fractions of 16kg , which is approx 1 pud . 
  that 's interesting , a centner is 100kg here in russia . 
   some think it 's extremely unfair one can be denied by their dream university because of 1 use point it 's only unfair if some highlander dad bought his child 100 points . 
  otherwise it 's extremely fair . 
  you can try again next year with your points , you can retake the exam next year , or you can admit you 're not the best and pick a less prestigious university . 
   we have an accent that 's identical to the russian one . 
  well , it 's very close . 
  at least that 's what your porn actresses sound like . 
   every woman is gorgeous and classy and does n't shave her pits . 
  \u041a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c ( every day ) , the private brand of auchan . 
  usually private brands of large retail networks are quite decent , but auchan manages to pick the shitties shit for its brand . 
  i guess that was n't russian enough . 
  it 's the lowest price segment supermarket chain of x5 retail group , often known for not paying very close attention to best before dates . 
  i do n't know , granta is basically a logan in quality and features . 
  have n't ridden in a vesta yet . 
  hahaha !, 
  i think it 's because the language share more phonology than usual , so russian portuguese * sounds * natural . 
  my son is . 
  actual russia . 
  quite a few ukrainians who , given they are in * russia * , do not care much about this whole pride and independence business . 
  since i have to work , then vienna , berlin or moscow . 
  maybe bristol or leeds or hamburg . 
  other attractive options : london has high cost of living , lisbon speaks portuguese and does n't have enough jobs , turin speaks italian . 
  multiple reservoirs on rivers around moscow . 
  it 's harder than the water in st. pete , but is n't too hard . 
  pure paper ( 5 years ) - 2000 roubles ( 35 eur ) biometric ( 10 years ) - 3500 roubles ( 50 eur ),

  rusalka , a spirit of a maiden who died ( drowned ) before her time was up , so now she lives the rest of her allotted life as a spirit that appears at night near water as a young , beautiful , often naked , woman that tries to lure you into the water and then drowns you by tickling or entangling you with her hair . 
  thanks to lazy translators the word means `` mermaid '' as well now . 
  yes , but i doubt they want to go to russia . 
  life must suck for norwegian muslims . 
  they must be as big as the south african ones . 
  you should pick a city with a large expat population , like prague . 
  more probability that a regular , not private banking , branch has english-speaking staff that knows what non-residents need . 
  damn , it took me 5-6 hours to get to kostroma from moscow , and that 's not a remote region at all . 
  or relatively warm . 
   russian graves are usually a bit different and you can instantly understand the difference . 
  do they have tiny painted steel fences ? 
   and people either turn into blubbering messes or get merry a guy i know got so drunk at his mil 's wake he started clinking glasses . 
  funeral takes place on the third day after death . 
  the outer circle comes to the morgue and says their last goodbye , then the body is loaded on a bus and is taken to the church for the funeral rites . 
  the inner circle then follows it to the cemetery , where the coffin is bolted closed , is lowered into the grave and people throw handfuls of dirt after it . 
  then the inner circle goes to a wake where they eat , drink and remember the deceased . 
  the wake starts with ritual foods like pancakes and wheat porridge with raisins . 
  the portrait of the deceased seats at the head of the table . 
  i was taught to address waiters and waitresses herr ober and fr\u00e4ulein , respectively . 
  should i relearn that ? 
  plus we have a new year tree with gifts , we bake cakes and boil eggs for easter , some people still gather dew on kupala . 
  czechia is about as racist as russia . 
  and bovril . 
  for russia i can name the jubilee biscuits , created for the romanov tricentennial , now produced by mondelez . 
  baltika beer is owned by carlsberg , but at least it 's not anheuser-busch inbev . 
  wimm-bill-dunn , the largest dairy and soft drinks manufacturer , known for its pioneering fake foreign brands , is owned by pepsico . 
  the other leading dairy manufacturer , unimilk , belongs to danone . 
  yes . 
  we really need to federalize the police and defang the fsb a la german constitution protection service . 
  i used to drink lots , half a litre a day or so . 
  now i only add it to my morning cocoa and drink lemon-flavoured water for dinner .
