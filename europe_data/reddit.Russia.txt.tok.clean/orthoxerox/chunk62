  i think many posters might be confused by the `` no makeup '' makeup .

  yes , i was uncomfortable reading the comments regarding victory day on / r/europe yesterday . 
  decisions of the soviet leadership before , during and after the war and crimes committed by some of the soviet soldiers and especially officers who did n't court martial those involved do not devalue in any way the heavy and terrible price all soviet people paid for the victory over germany or the heroism of the red army .

  officially we never lived under communism , since communism was described the same way post-scarcity economy is described under capitalism . 
  we were a relatively well-off family , able to source foreign goods . 
  soviet consumer goods were ... bland . 
  their supply was limited among other reasons because of the inflated wages , so even they were in high demand . 
  self-service style grocery shops ( pick stuff up , go to the till ) were rare , most of them had a separate counter and a till . 
  first you stood in one queue to order what you wanted , got the final price , then stood in the other to pay for it .

  the class has to choose between orthodoxy , sunni islam , judaism , lamaist buddhism , history of religions or ethics .

  they have been mostly exterminated in moscow .
