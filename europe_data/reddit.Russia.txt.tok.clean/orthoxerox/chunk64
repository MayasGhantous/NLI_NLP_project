  we 're still building huge multilane roads through residential districts , but at the same time the local government is trying to optimize the bus network . 
  they want to get rid of trolleybuses , though , and our tram network needs a lot of attention . 
  with new segregated tracks it they could be much faster than buses . 
  oh yes . 
  russian drivers are paragons of civility and courtesy compared to the romans . 
  why do the numbers matter ? 
  is english a european or american language ? 
  sorry , i meant ugric . 
  why no ? 
  all other surviving speakers of uralic languages are siberian peoples . 
  fuck yeah , art deco !, 
  i prefer american art deco myself . 
  that niagara mohawk building in syracuse is bliss made solid . 
  [ the tale of igor 's campaign ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_tale_of_igor%27s_campaign ) , written in late 12th century , it 's old enough to be studied in russian , ukrainian and belorussian language classes . 
  technically , hungarians . 
  russians have always been tea drinkers . 
  should 've gone with * \u0427\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0443\u0442\u0430 * to piss off our neighbors .

  not as good as it could be , not as bad as it could be . 
   why ca n't you have a national-trained police force commanded by the ministry of interior ( whatever you call that , department of interior ? ), 
  fbi ? 
  germany does n't have a full-featured national police either . 
  that 's why laws should be written with archeologists in mind . 
  i 've never heard of this game before . 
  universal basic income . 
  [ kvn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kvn ) , the snl of russia if you measure their importance as the starting point of so many comedians .

  `` there 's no money left , but you hang in there , '' as medvedev told crimean pensioners . 
  he got a nobel prize for it , but * quiet flows the don * by sholokhov is not as popular as * war and peace * or * crime and punishment * . 
  that quip was already tired and unfunny in the 1800s . 
  then the eastern front it is . 
  well , national-socialists have `` socialists '' right in their name ... 
  i work in it for a large foreign-owned company . 
  our working hours are 9:00 -17:45 mon-thu and 9:00 -16:30 fri , 30 minutes for lunch . 
  i come later ( around 9:30 or 10:00 ) and stay later . 
  i wear dress trousers and a dress shirt , but my underlings dress more casually , a jeans and a t-shirt are fine as long as they 're neat . 
  practically nothing . 
  maybe wwii and the cold war . 
  i guess we 're supposed to learn about the sale of alaska , but i ca n't remember that lesson . 
  that was more than half my life ago , though . 
  fry some meat and vegetables ( carrot , onion , celery ) in a pot . 
  add cream and spices . 
  stew a bit . 
  add buckwheat , salt and water . 
  cook until the buckwheat is done . 
  it gets tastier the next day . 
  not much . 
  they formed plc with poland and then we started fighting . 
  xx century was covered in the final grade , so we did n't learn anything else . 
  only later did i learn that it could 've become russia instead of muscovy . 
  catalonia . 
  scotland . 
  i think crimea will be recognized within the same time frame and will therefore technically succeed . 
  working people ? 
  like tradies and builders ? 
  or do you mean office workers too ? 
  the former are likely to eat something like shawarma from a hole-in-the-wall place . 
  the poorest illegals buy kefir and several loaves of bread and share . 
  factory workers eat in a canteen , office workers go to a canteen or a cafe . 
  a common lunch there consists of a salad , a soup , and a main course with a side dish like macaroni , potatoes , rice or buckwheat . 
  oh , and a glass of fruit-based drink . 
  sometimes a soup and a salad are mutually exclusive . 
  i remember the guy who made fence posts by filling prairie dog holes with water in winter and painting the resulting icicles over . 
  they love discounts and coupons , though . 
  big distances , terrible urban planning , a few megapolises , corrupt politicians , aggressive foreign policy , immigrants from the countries south of the border , pockets of native minorities , automatic transmission , high support for `` family values '' , police brutality , bimodal wealth distribution , deeply troubled healthcare system , etc. 
  the huge difference is what the masses perceive as just economic policy . 
  russians are left-wing , americans are right-wing . 
  that was inevitable . 
  irreligious , cheap , centrally located , czechia was bound to become a european porn hub . 
  of course . 
  it 's an integral part of my address . 
  yes , you write a number , of course . 
  you write a name , too , when your package is big or expensive and has to be signed for . 
   because some girls got pregnant under , uhm , curious circumstances . 
  you mean like mary ? 
  six . 
  celentano was big here in russia , but this particular song has never been popular . 
  on the other hand , you made me check , and it turns hafanana was n't performed by celentano . 
  is n't cor blimey a west country thing ? 
  you should just switch to seseo + yeismo already . 
  would make learning spanish much more easier . 
  too much effort . 
  why would we need watermelon ? 
  i wonder what dutch people think of ust-kut . 
   the exception is some food , water , and toilet paper italian version would have only food and water . 
  nordic and liberal . 
  sweden at least has lots of nature per capita , as we do . 
  i support open source gmo , those that farmers can regrow themselves should need arise . 
  yes , you must be 16 to be emancipated . 
  i do n't know the details of the legal procedure , though .
