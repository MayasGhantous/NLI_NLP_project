  we have egg fights as well . 
  they did . 
  really ? 
  i expected some roman fort to occupy the location earlier . 
  proportional as in voting for parties , not fptp voting for congressmen . 
  14 years ago i had really good rp accent . 
  after ten years of speaking english with russians and indians i lapsed into a weird mixture of british , american and russian . 
  do n't you have to gain independence first ? 
  proportional representation in the lower chamber . 
  two rounds of presidential elections decided by popular vote . 
  overturn * citizens united * . 
  done . 
  the what of what ? 
  we do n't care about national leagues of other countries . 
  nhl might sound like an exception , but that 's because the news report good scoring by russians there .

  are n't they a cdu/csu puppet ? 
  various caucasians are more conservative than us plainsfolk .

  i am glad we got rid of it . 
  it stresses out farm animals as well as people . 
  we call tortillas maize flatbread . 
  first time i heard about such a thing . 
  stereotypical names are : male dogs : - \u0428\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a - \u0411\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043a - \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043d - \u0422\u0440\u0435\u0437\u043e\u0440 - \u0420\u0435\u043a\u0441 - \u0411\u0430\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0441 - \u0422\u0443\u0437\u0438\u043a bitches : - \u0416\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0430 tom cats : - \u0411\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0438\u043a - \u041c\u0443\u0440\u0437\u0438\u043a pussy cats : - \u041c\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0430 but nowadays you 're much more likely to find one having a random english name than one of those . 
  they sound a lot like the children of germans on social assistance . 
  is n't the culling of deer done best by trained professionals rather than hobbyists who can easily wound one and then lose track of it altogether ? 
  thanks for that info about handguns vs large animals . 
  i 've always thought a .44 had enough stopping power . 
  nah , it 's taking it foo far , we 're not transliterating leipzig and dresden as \u041b\u0438\u043f\u0441\u043a and \u0414\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c , after all . 
  yeah , the rules are a bit arbitrary . 
  on one hand we have \u0416\u0435\u0448\u0443\u0432 , but on the other \u041b\u043e\u0434\u0437\u044c instead of \u0412\u0443\u0447 . 
  yes , that 's true , but they are still pronounced the way they are written . 
  do only male names require '' \u043d\u0430 '' ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rainbow_party_ ( sexuality ), 
  how would you say `` peter '' and `` the church of saint peter '' ? 
  \u041b\u0430\u0432\u0440 would be the nominative case ( \u0424\u043b\u043e\u0440 \u0438 \u041b\u0430\u0432\u0440 ) . 
  religious and ethnic parties are forbidden in russia . 
  my opinion is completely opposite . 
  self-defense is moral , hunting is not . 
  to clarify a bit , i am generally against making handguns legal . 
  i can make an exception for * professional * hunters or people living in rural areas with wild boars or bears . 
  a large-calibre handgun is easier for them to carry around as the emergency animal defence weapon than a rifle . 
  for home defence a shotgun is sufficient . 
  is n't it an overblown urban legend , like rainbow blowjob parties ? 
  not sure . 
  i do n't like identity politics , but i also do n't like huge swaths of the republican platform . 
  so democratic by necessity . 
  yeah , russian names are pronounced unambiguously in 95 % of the cases . 
  the remaining ones include weird stress placement ( like poet iv ** a ** nov ) or declension ( family name \u0417\u0430\u044f\u0446 can be declined as the animal ( \u0417\u0430\u0439\u0446\u0430 , \u0417\u0430\u0439\u0446\u0443 etc ) or more rigidly ( \u0417\u0430\u044f\u0446\u0430 , \u0417\u0430\u044f\u0446\u0443 etc ) , but a man who does n't decline his last name \u0417\u0430\u044f\u0446 is a fucking retard on par with le-a ) . 
  the butthurt belt , you mean ? 
  they are butthurt about the whole soviet rule thing ( not that it 's completely unjustified , of course ) . 
  and belarus is a fucking weathervane , turning west and east to get extra benefits . 
  berlin ? 
  now i want to watch more of stealthgamerbr 's badass videos . 
  no we have some lines strung over the bathtub and a foldout rack for extra laundry . 
  not enough poles . 
  i wo n't disagree with that . 
  is there anyone who was not controversial ? 
  chernenko ? 
  let 's do it in the steppes of ukraine , as is tradition . 
  any swedes willing to join us in exploring the rich and prosperous commonwealth ? 
  i consider them the latest incarnation of the spoiler party for the liberal right . 
  there 'll be a new one for the next elections . 
  okay , let me do one for russia : we have just four parties in the parliament , the election rules keep getting adjusted to keep it that way . 
  in 2016 , for example , we went back to the mixed proportional/single seat system . 
  ** united russia ** : a party of bureaucrats , it has putin as its non-partisan leader . 
  works like the cpsu of the redder times : getting a managerial promotion in the civil service or any state-funded non-commercial service is easier if you support them . 
  technically a social conservative party . 
  ** cprf ** : nominally communists , they are more of champagne socialists with a weird love of both stalin and jesus and the only functionally independent party in the parliament . 
  slowly , but steadily losing their support base to natural death . 
  younger left-wingers have been destroyed in 2012 . 
  ** a just russia ** : a party cobbled together to ensure cprf gets fewer votes . 
  technically a social democratic party . 
  got a lot of votes in 2011 when everyone was tired of the ur , took part in the initial protest , but pussied out along with the communists and did n't demand a recount . 
  got much worse results in 2016 . 
  ** ldpr ** : national populists led by their firebrand clown zhirinovsky . 
  will disintegrate when he dies . 
  their purpose is to gather protest votes on the right and then vote with the ur . 
  outside the parliament , we have two parties that are somewhat relevant : ** yabloko ** : social liberals , they are famously ideologically inflexible , refusing to bloc with anyone who does n't share their views . 
  a party of educated pensioners and university professors . 
  ** rpr/parnas ** : the last remains of the largest party of the ruling coalition of the 90s . 
  market liberals , their current ideology is `` putin bad '' . 
  after the death of nemtsov it has no marketable leaders left . 
  ** progress party ** : does n't have an official registration , ideology : clumsy charismatic populism . 
  led by alexey navalny , well-supported by armchair internet warriors . 
  had no chance to tarnish its image by being in charge of anything yet . 
  google gives me several pages worth of shops selling stills for urban moonshiners who have more money than free time . 
  like this : https://youtu.be/yfzmcazwhyy, 
  i opppose it along with infant baptism and religious education of minors . 
  / u/dalnore is correct . 
  it 's againat the rules . 
  if you 're busted you might be put on a schengen-wide blacklist . 
  i 've always wondered where the french get fresh baguette for breakfast . 
  yesterday baguette is already too dry , do you have to go outside before breakfast to buy a fresh one ? 
  i can read ukrainian on shampoo bottles or listen to ukrainian music just fine , i get about 85 % . 
  you should make austrian/boarisch a separate language , like ukrainians did with ukrainian . 
  do estonians not have black hair sometimes ?
