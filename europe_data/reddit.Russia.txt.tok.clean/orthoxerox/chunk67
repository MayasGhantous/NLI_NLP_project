  are you sure you do n't confuse russians with africans ? 
  what does that `` distinctly darker '' even mean ? 
  we use butter in jam , cheese , salmon and caviar sanwiches . 
  too many people use the bus and we exit through the middle and rear doors . 
  maybe if it was a village bua where you see the driver every day and know them personally , but not in moscow . 
  not that outrageous . 
  not really . 
  there 's one thing every family has its own word for : fried carrots , onions and garlic you add to soups during cooking . 
  no one can agree , but i have n't noticed any geographical distribution . 
  yes . 
  they should check their privilege . 
  i 've read an interview with the head of starbucks in russia , and they said the biggest difference is that russians have to * eat * something . 
  they will never sit down just to drink coffee . 
  they want a slice of cake or a pie . 
  compared to europe , we have much fewer outdoor verandas and most are owned by cafe chains like * la belle chocolati\u00e8re * . 
  i am not sure what the situation in russia outside moscow is like . 
  there 's only one abibas version of the brand ? 
  no jim wolfstone or jack wallenstein ? 
  they are now . 
  pretentious brides insist on a * theme * and a * color scheme * now and order identical bridesmaid dresses from aliexpress . 
  john wolfson , you mean ? 
   at least you border russia . 
  we can fix that if you want . 
  i do n't think we keep count . 
  we know it as a pushkin rhyme . 
  who has said/written that in france ? 
  upd : found it , denis diderot, 
  i am referring to not eating any animal products during the whole lent and other fasts . 
  that 's what it 's like in the orthodox church . 
   opens the first link , sees a blobby turd  must be gehry  opens the second link . 
  of course it 's gehry, 
  i have a hard-on for gothic and art deco buildings , so i 'm not exactly spoiled for choice ... out of buildings that do exist in russia i 'll probably choose [ petrine stopover palace ] ( https://www.google.ru/search?q=\u043f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439+\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439+\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446&amp;tbm=isch ) , unless i can think of any other building that impresses me . 
  at least two rus princes have been called `` the eyes of terror '' ( \u0413\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u041e\u0447\u0438 ) for their wrothful character . 
  another was called `` the rampageous aurochs '' ( \u0411\u0443\u0439-\u0422\u0443\u0440 ) for being warlike . 
  roman drivers think that when a car in front of them slows down they should change the lane and accelerate . 
  the tourists crossing the road in front of the first car are usually not that happy about that . 
  moscow drivers have mellowed out * a lot * . 
  there are still assholes in bmw 's and golf gti 's that tailgate you , sluts in merc/audi crossover suvs that ignore everyone else because no one wants to crash into a car like theirs and assholes in all sorts of cars that drive around countryside jams via a hard shoulder and demand you let them merge back in . 
  but generally you can drive around without losing your brain cells to stress and anger or cross the road without risking your life . 
  life is a chemical process . 
  chemicals are always involved . 
  i like to stay around earls court tube station . 
  it 's close enough to both heathrow and the centre . 
  i 'd say we say '' \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u044f\u043d\u0435 '' , not '' \u044f\u043d\u043a\u0438 '' , when talking about their civil war . 
  [ bird 's milk cake ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/bird's_milk_cake_-_tort_ptichye_moloko.jpg ), 
  my take home pay is about 3250 euro per month . 
  that 's about twice the median it salary in moscow and ten times higher than the median salary in a small russian town . 
  i 'd probably earn about the same ( ppp ) if i moved to western europe , since i 'd have to rent . 
   `` ll '' / `` y '' what 's the difference ? 
  i pronounce both as / j / in ipa . 
  oh , yes , sorry . 
  bruce hilter , could he have come from any other place with a name like this ? 
  only when we tell them to go home . 
  18 for purchasing , no hard limit for consumption , though the police and/or cps might give you trouble if your kid is fined for public consumption . 
  a nice bowl of [ shchi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shchi ) . 
  not too hot , based on hearty beef stock , the cabbage must n't be too ripe or it 's too sweet ( sauerkrat is better if your cabvage is white-ripe ) , a generous dollop of sourcream ... 
  they think mexican food is spanish . 
  because we 're not part of the eu and the su happily dp ` ed poland with germany before getting attacked . 
  one guy from austria tried that once . 
  the uk spoiled his attempt . 
  exercising your freedom of assembly outside free speech zones without a permit . 
  jail sentences for repeat unlawful assembly offenses . 
  water is moscow is plainswater , it does n't come from some fancy mountain springs , so it is chemically treated and smells of chlorine , but it 's pretty safe to drink . 
  i still pass it through a filter jug before drinking it . 
  ten days are enough for two large cities ( not in-depth , mind you ) , you could do london + paris or rome + florence/venice . 
  depends on the month . 
   russians even got a name for us connected with that ( i do n't remember what word it was ) pszeki ? 
  maxim syrnikov is the biggest specialist , like this swede nilsson , but he writes about * very * traditional russian cuisine , one untainted by the atlantic exchange . 
  for a more down-to-earth soviet grandma cooking , * \u041a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u043e \u0432\u043a\u0443\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u0437\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0438\u0449\u0435 * / * healthy and tasty food cookbook * should be the most common option . 
  how do you pronounce it ? 
  americans say `` goo-dah '' , russians say `` gow-dah '' ( rhymes with powder ) . 
  trying to generalize for the whole russia : - types of fats for food preparation : sunflower and olive oil for frying , butter for baking - fruits : apples ; bananas are kinda inexpensive , too - vegetables : cabbage , cucumbers , carrots , beets - starchy carbs : potatoes , buckwheat , overcooked pasta , bread with every dish , various porridges for breakfast ( rice , oats , barley , millet , semolina ) - types of bread : wheat , rye-wheat , rye sourdough with molasses - spices : black pepper , laurel leaf - types of meat : chicken , beef , pork - nuts , seeds , etc : sunflower seeds , peanuts if you 're fancy - types of cheese : mechanically processed , with palm oil - pre-made sauces and dips ( soy sauce , bbq sauce , remoulade , ketchup , mayo , etc. ? 
  ketchup and mustard . 
  do they mean anything else ? 
  all around the world ? 
  probably mature cheddar . 
  in russia ? 
  i 've met only one good aged cheese so far , marsental turne from sernursk cheese factory . 
  i could imagine france using their usual `` that 's totally not a colony '' trick , but where do your reefs grow ? 
  i live in a good brick commieblock , and i can hear : - my same-landing neighbour 's grandkids coming and going ( they 're both rowdy ) - the kid from the apartment above running around on her hooves ( ? ), 
  in the morning - someone 's phone vibrating i guess that 's all . 
  i bet they all hear my son much more often . 
  litreball , we call it . 
  ivanovo and other surrounding regions ne of moscow . 
  it was a light industry region and it got completely annihilated by turkish and chinese textiles . 
   '' \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0430 '' do n't try that in russia , 
  \u041c\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 / maslenitsa is the week when you 're not allowed to eat meat , but can eat all other non-fasting food , so it 's seven days of pancakes and crepes . 
  on sunday you 're supposed to ask for forgiveness from everyone you know to enter lent with clean conscience and you burn a giant straw effigy of winter because no church holiday is complete without a pagan tradition . 
  in russian the words are \u0434\u044f\u0434\u044f / \u0442\u0451\u0442\u044f or the diminutive \u0434\u044f\u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0430 / \u0442\u0451\u0442\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0430 when spoken by a child . 
  they literally mean uncle/aunt . 
  if only you 'd carried on fighting with this kind of bravery and selfless sacrifice we would n't have lost the crimean war ... 
  same here . 
  my mom did that , and no one i played with did . 
  yes . 
  it used to be an offensive symbol back in the soviet days , but nowadays it 's very common .
