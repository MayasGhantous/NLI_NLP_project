  the rest are n't even remotely european . 
   first names are for friends only . 
  this is the hardest thing to adapt to as a russian . 
  last names are what teachers and officers use to call you . 
  i can mentally translate `` herr/frau rosenbad '' to the russian equivalent of first name + patronymic , so i feel okay saying that to the boss , but calling my equal nowotny or schwarz instead of andreas or thorsten wo n't stop feeling weird . 
  the teeth are an american thing . 
  they expect them to look like a piano keyboard , especially if you 're a media personality , and they do n't see that many foreign people on tv that are n't british . 
  it 's the same here in russia . 
  the mayor of moscow was an avid beekeeper and introduced german laws . 
  altay mountains . 
  i guess most people find swimming in ice holes on epiphany weird . 
  we have it as well in rural regions . 
  i am an officer in reserve , so yes , 6 shots from an ak-74 . 
  guns are surprisingly loud when you lovingly rest your cheek on them . 
  the rear end of russia , of course . 
   other than them , it 's probably kazakhstan . 
  they 're the only non-slavic country where russian is the prestigious urban language . 
  winter means brown snow/slush and -5 to -15 degrees , with brief cold spells down to -20 . 
  summer means +20 to +25 degrees , with brief or long heat waves up to +30 . 
  spring and autumn are rainy with unpredictable weather . 
  this year winter started in november , last year it did n't snow in december at all . 
  not enough space for two toilet rooms . 
  and when both of them are self-contained units with a sink and a crapper , why bother making one male and one female only ? 
  native accents : probably kuban . 
  foreign accents : all of the central asian ones ( i am sorry , i do n't have enough experience to tell them apart ) . 
  it usually means you will reprise that chicken sandwich scene from the * goobacks * episode of * south park * in the immediate future . 
  i do n't think we have any , i ca n't even think of special new year desserts . 
  i think that 's because christmas eve was the last day of the christmas fast , so you would n't have any desserts on the table . 
  \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c-\u043d\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044b-\u0431\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430 rock-scissors-paper also , i have experienced semantic satiation reading this thread , and `` scissors '' no longer feels like a real word to me . 
  in russia you have to get a national passport from the police when you turn 14 . 
  you replace it when you turn 20 and 45 , iirc . 
  your travel passport or your military card are also a valid form of id , and a driver 's license can also be used for many operations . 
  many banks want to see at least two ids when you apply for a loan to minimize the risk of being given a fake/stolen id . 
  the law says you have to `` identify yourself to the police '' when asked , but it depends on how big of an asshole the cop is ( or you are ) . 
  if everything goes well and you can tell them your name and address , including the postal code , they will let you go even when you do n't have an id on you . 
  if you 're an asshole , they are an asshole or you look like the wrong kind of foreigner , prepare for a bribe or a trip to the station and a few hours with hobos , whores and junkies while waiting for someone to bring your id . 
  in jew skin ? 
  extremely uncommon . 
  tourists either rent a room or live in a tent , and no one uses them as permanent housing . 
  shish kebab , but it 's no longer considered foreign , everyone makes * shashlyk * in their * dacha * 's backyard . 
  muck-duck . 
  you can thank hitler , stalin , churchill and roosevelt for that . 
  more religious people go to church on christmas eve . 
  i 'll wait for someone from the butthurt belt to post the v-creature for russia . 
  he probably had a time machine . 
  huh ? 
  my block of flats was built in the 50s , so it 's about 60 years old . 
  it 's brick , though . 
  how should i know ? 
  i am not a hipster . 
  speaking of nutella , do any other brands still use cocoa butter/hazelnut oil in their cocoa/hazelnut spreads ? 
  you should definitely write to the alpine clubs of the countries you 're planning to hike through . 
  they will be able to provide you with lots of valuable info . 
  yes , we even have ( digital ) media aimed at hipsters , full of craft beer , coworking spaces , basket weaving workshops and vintage falafel . 
   that chick on instagram that 's famous for being famous the one that used to be a really quick dude ? 
  not much . 
  i think less than 1000 rub ( 16 3 eur ) for paying for my lunch . 
  and a debit card . 
  because even though russian-speaking internet is the second-biggest segment , there 's still so much more information that is in english only . 
  plus you get to see what people from other countries think . 
  i doubt there are women that use abortions as birth control , just like i doubt there are men who claim being transwomen to prey on women in wcs . 
  abortion is hard enough for the women psychologically , restricting access to it will only make life worse for them . 
  i can recognize russian , ukrainian , belarusian , polish , german , english , scots , french , italian , romanian , spanish and portuguese . 
  the rest i am less familiar with . 
  not that common . 
  my side of the family has never used one , but my mil actually follows cookbooks and weighs her ingredients . 
  i bake , so i use a scale as well . 
  is there a clear ethnic divide between two sides of istanbul ? 
  same as in the op . 
  because kazakhs do not look european or even middle-eastern . 
  seriously speaking , its european part is a literal desert . 
  kazakh population centers lie deep in asia . 
  i am quite familiar with it . 
  both ec snd fptp house elections . 
  free speech . 
  you ca n't offend religious sensibilities or `` instigate hatred of social groups '' . 
  - \u042f\u0441\u043b\u0438 ( yasli/manger ) - for kids aged a few months old to three years . 
  their number has been cut dramatically , and good private ones are hard to find as well . 
  - \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0434 ( detskiy sad/kindergarten ) - ages 3 to 6/7 . 
  play inside , play outside , arts and crafts , song and dance , basic reading , writing and arithmetics in the final year .

  exams at the end . 
  after this you have two options ( beyond not learning anything else ) : - \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 ( srednyee spetsialnoye/vocational education ) - 3 years in a college learning a trade , including lower tier office jobs - \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435 ( polnoye sredneye/high school ) - 2 more years of school , learning more advanced subjects , final exams at the end . 
  your final high school exams determine which university you can be admitted to .

  - \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 ( vyssheye/higher education ) means 4-6 years in a university , qualification exams and a thesis are necessary to get a degree . 
  you can skip the first year of the higher education if you obtain a relevant college degree first , but i do n't know the details . 
  - \u0430\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 ( aspirantura/grad school ) - 2 years of academic slavery , qualification exams and a real thesis to become a candidate of sciences ( broadly equivalent to a phd ) . 
  only for those who want an academic career or ca n't bribe their way out of the draft . 
  beyond that there 's only doctoranture , but you need some academic cred before you can even apply . 
   you politely say to him that he 's not respecting the queque . 
  well , we have a fortress smack in the center of the city that was rebuilt in the late 15th century , but private dwellings of that age are nonexistent . 
  moscow was torched in 1812 and heavily rebuilt in the 20th century to conform to the new architectural ideals . 
  i was in winchester this thursday , it 's a very nice town . 
  i saw a russian wearing a shirt with the russian coat of arms on it and speaking russian today . 
  florida man ?
