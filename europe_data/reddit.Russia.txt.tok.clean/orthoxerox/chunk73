  it 's viewed as something that led to the revolutions of 1917 . 
  the eastern front was more dynamic , so we do n't get fixated on the senseless carnage like the brits and the french . 
  it 's more about the tsar 's mismanagement of the country and the war effort . 
   well , we 're glad you acctually had noticed there is a war by 1917 well , what did you expect from * estonians * ? 
  28 days ( 4 weeks ) are the legal minimum , plus 18 or so national holidays . 
  i get 6 extra days off for overtime . 
  yeah , most russian drivers spend their mornings like [ this ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=3mcfrgmn8em&amp;t=51 ) . 
  ** russia ** 13k would be automatically deducted from my salary as income tax . 
  social security , medical and pension fund payments are made by my employer * on top of * my salary and would be worth about 36k extra , but are capped and will be much lower for such a high salary . 
  there are no tax brackets for high earners or married couples , 13 % is the universal rate . 
  i can get tax deductions if i buy real estate or pay for my eductation ; the cap is relatively low , but hey , ca n't say no to free money . 
  self-employed have to file their own taxes and contribute to three funds above , but i have no experience doing my own taxes . 
  yes , if they tried to kill you or interfere with your will . 
  otherwise they can not get less than 1/2 of their default share . 
  just to screw with lithuania , belarus , ukraine and poland - yes . 
  a green ( longer distance ) bus on corfu . 
  i have n't ridden a blue ( shorter distance ) one in a while , but they used to have bus conductors as well . 
  unlimited everything is 10 $ / mo. 
  not 100 % unlimited , since torrents are throttled and you get something like 200 minutes per month for inter-network calls , but intra-network calls and texts are 100 % free and you can tether your phone . 
  i saw them in greece in 2009 . 
  talking about [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4nst0q_jfo ) ? 
  number 1 , we 're even the subject of their presidential debates . 
  hm ... - corfu , paxos , antipaxos , santorini and crete in greece - balchug and lower mnevniki in moscow - the principal neva delta islands in st. pete - mainau and museum island in germany - kuramathi and whatever island the airport 's on in maldives - great britain in the uk, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/circum-baikal_railway and maybe belorechensk-tuapse . 
  small regional factories still produce bagged milk here . 
  unimilk and moscow based factories produce tetra-pak uht and pasteurized milk in plastic bottles . 
  yes , we call them \u0436\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 , literally arseholics , but `` arse '' here means shit hitting the fan . 
  most do n't go beyond owning a crossover , reading metro-2033 and having a hunting knife . 
  do still remember it beyond 2b | ! 2b ? 
  i like frost , he 's much better than incomprehensible keats in my opinion . 
  not even dutch poetry ? 
  rather common : - was stalin essential for the eventual victory or is he responsible for nearly losing to the nazis ? 
  - was the molotov-ribbentropp pact a necessary evil to buy more time before the inevitable war ? 
  i 'm mostly playing hearts of iron iv these days and am yet to complete tales of the borderlands . 
  looking forward to tyranny and tides of numenera . 
  not very common . 
  well , in banya it is expected , but nudist beaches are often harrassed by the locals who call them sexual perverts . 
  what 's the most popular kvas in estonia ? 
  it 's not that difficult , you just need a [ mountain river and a big-ass knife ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucvvanxq2ymc_qlc7qfpa2yq?app=desktop ) . 
  why not shawmus , then ? 
  is hamlet a common name ? 
  we just do n't call it a continent . 
  in russia we are taught that there are six continents ( eurasia , africa , australia , antarctica , north america and south america ) and six parts of the world ( europe , asia , africa , australia , antarctica , america ) . 
  moscow, 
  world war z ( the book ) has described our likely tactics pretty well . 
  til . 
  i 've always thought candy corn meant caramelized popcorn . 
  national or religious parties are forbidden in russia . 
  language : russian moon : \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430 continent : \u0415\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f part of the world : \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430, 
  we do n't get enough of them . 
  pls come . 
  maybe st. pete gets enough , but i do n't care about st. pete . 
  never heard of it till today , honestly . 
  have you told them than in heaven , all they talk about is the ocean ? 
  how gorgeously beautiful it is . 
  and all the sunsets that they saw . 
  mountains by the sea are the winning combo . 
  yes . 
  or lithuania/latvia back in the past . 
  the med and the red are for those who can afford a bit more . 
  a woman past her prime and out of shape , with short bleached hair and a scowl . 
  it 's an amusing coincidence , but `` styrit ' '' means `` to steal '' in russian . 
  we have that too . 
  yes , but you have to qualify ( grades only ; athletics and activism do n't count , thankfully ) and free slots are limited and restricted to degrees the state thinks it will need more of in 5 years . 
  if i ignore transit stops , then i 've been to moscow , moscow oblast , st. pete , leningrad oblast , kostroma oblast , tambov oblast , kaliningrad oblast , stavropol krai , krasnodar krai , crimea republic and sevastopol . 
  i doubt someone has visited all of them . 
  maybe [ artemy lebedev ] ( http://www.tema.ru/travel/world/ ) has , but he has visited every single country and dependency in the world as well . 
  do n't forget that he was the one who abolished serfdom . 
  the reform went only halfway , like obamacare , but it made my ancestors free people . 
  you guys and us have been working hard on that task for what , two years now ? 
  quite a lot of russians , especially older ones have never been to the sea . 
  british houses have unheated bedrooms and single glazing windows . 
  i do n't expect them to rebuild them to the [ passivhaus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/passive_house ) standard , but a few more degrees inside would be welcome . 
  horseshoe theory , westernmost europe is closer to eastern europe than to more moderate europe . 
  only cyberdogs , but they are useless in rural regions , not enough charging stations . 
   a purpose-built dog i understand what you wanted to say , but the literal interpretation sounds really weird . 
   still the largest european country \\* cough \\*, 
  it 's relatively uncommon . 
  you can buy cold cuts or pieces of turkey for cooking , but most people stick to pork and chicken . 
  what 's it called in turkey , btw ? 
  not really , no . 
  german and french companies working here prefer bad english to put everyone on an equal footing . 
  why are they attacked ? 
  just for the lulz ? 
  i think it 's a basic human right if the burglar refuses to comply with my commands . 
  my tv or my bag is more important than the life/health of a criminal to me . 
  if the police are quicker than me , then the criminal is lucky . 
  likewise , if someone attacks me or threatens to attack me , and i doubt i can retreat fast enough or self-defend myself using equal force , i should be allowed to use overwhelming force : gut them , shoot them , stab their eye , whatever . 
  i am in doubts about the full scale `` stand your ground '' law , when you are allowed to shoot anyone who looks at you sideways while black . 
  well , lots of people treat those under arrest as automatically guilty . 
  if the police come to your workplace and arrest you , most of your coworkers will think you 've done something , not that the bobbies messed up again . 
  how long has tatort been running ? 
  they must 've solved every crime in germany by now . 
  there 's a small crucifix on the wall over the head of my mil 's bed . 
  even saudi arabia is the west . 
  relations are about the same as between latin americans in europe/us , but with much less mutual intelligibility . 
  as long as the argentinian does n't say he 's the only white guy around or the bolivian does n't start a pissing match with the chilean about sea access , everyone sticks together . 
  but if the russian comes to work wearing a stalin t-shirt or the croat puts marko perkovi\u0107 on repeat , the relationship will turn sour immediately . 
  75 % abv , 99 ml , 20 roubles ( 0.25 eur ) . 
  it 's technically an over the counter medicine ( hawthorne hygienic lotion ) , but ~ ~ one apothecary loaded a vending machine ~ ~ there 's a whole business franchise of vending machines with these bottles , causing a scandal .
