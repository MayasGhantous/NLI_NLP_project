  is your name philippus aureolus theophrastus bombastus von hohenheim ? 
  yep . 
  his personal letters are so unexpectedly modern in style it 's hard to believe they are n't forgeries . 
  are you a nation of chartered accountants ? 
  some mature cheddar or gouda is probably the best go-to cheese i can think of . 
  powerful enough to be eaten alone , but not overpowering in a sandwich . 
  tilsiter is a good sandwich cheese , granas are good as a desert . 
   where they pass these revolting blasphemies as mozzarella . 
  jesus save me !, 
  that 's worse than uruguayan parmesan !, 
  i did n't say that * did n't * vary . 
  but two american states or towns chosen at random are more likely to be much more similar to each other than to a european country that is not a tax/law haven microstate . 
  variety for the sake of variety ( 5.6 % sales tax vs 6.5 % sales tax ) is irrelevant . 
  i know ma has romneycare and walkable boston , but most everything else there is unlike europe . 
  seattle is relatively godless and rather left-wing , but you do n't get free healthcare , 4 weeks off a year and a generous parental leave unless you 're lucky enough to find a socially conscious employer . 
   and to me it 's weird that people lump in places like la , nyc , chicago , seattle , maine denver and texas as if they 're anything alike . 
  healthcare , banking , taxes , public transportation , social security systems like parental leave , vacations and sick days are very similar across the states compared to europe . 
  there are exceptions , of course , but even the most soc-dem place like sf is more liberal than europe . 
  liberal in the european sense . 
  you 're a fan of duterte , are n't you . 
  short distance ( less than 1 day ) - by car or by train anything else - an airplane is better . 
  low on money - a train to brest in belarus and a bus tour across europe from there there are exceptions , of course , like people taking a moscow-nice train or driving to europe . 
  22 is fine . 
  but they do say \u0439\u0448\u043e\u0432 instead of \u0439\u0448\u043e\u043b . 
   \u0161vapanje is n't that what poles and ukrainians do ? 
  rubbernecks ? 
  do they drive slowly on swiss roads ? 
  that 's because it is one . 
   a burglar does n't deserve to live . 
  ftfy, 
  no , a different squint . 
  but that 's probably the actual reason why they used to be considered asian . 
  to a certain degree , yes . 
  english and french women are usually easy to tell apart . 
  germans and the dutch have this slightly melted look about their faces compared to the slavs . 
  finns often have this finnish squint , etc. 
  but i wo n't be able to tell a serb and a croat apart unless i see them cross themselves . 
  for me the west is the countries shaped by abrahamic religions , while the east has two sources of influence : dharmic and taoic . 
  not really , flour can be densely packed or aerated , sugar can be fine-grained or coarse-grained , for many cakes it makes sense to weigh the ingredients instead of measuring them by volume . 
  yeah , i 've been in an austrian bookshop once and picked up a local cookbook . 
  took me a while to get what all these `` dag '' stood for . 
  still better than the cups , sticks and spoons of america . 
  we only use grams and millilitres here . 
  yes . 
  yeah , if someone offered me a shoulder massage i would think they were hitting on me rather overtly . 
  no , born in the early to mid 80 's . 
  early 90 's were a baby bust . 
  we have many engineering words that come from german , just like we have lots of dutch words for rigging and ships in general , but ukrainian had even more loanwords for basic stuff like onion , sugar , roof and paint . 
  we also kinda envy german efficiency and having their shit together in general , while not doing anything ourselves , of course . 
  adidas is not adored because it 's german , it 's simply adidas . 
  however , german cars and german appliances are appreciated because they 're german , just like japanese cars and appliances are . 
  finns are aloof and wo n't tell you more than you have asked . 
  better at nature management than us . 
  really like to get completely shitfaced . 
  back in 2002 i finished my 10th year of school , grade 11 ( we skipped grade 3 for some reason ) . 
  there were no electives , and everyone who wanted to learn a trade left school after grade 9 . 
  we had the following subjects : * russian language ( just an hour every two weeks or so to brush up on the hardest parts , the main course ended in grade 9 ) . 
  * russian literature ( xx century ) * russian history ( xx century , both courses are taught generally chronologically ) * world history * social studies ( what 's an individual , how do they relate to the society , etc ) * civics ( the structure of the state , the main law codes ) * safe living ( civil defence , mostly ) * physics ( particle physics in grade 11 ) * astronomy * chemistry ( organic in grade 11 ) * biology ( genetics in grade 11 ) * ecology ( or did it end in grade 10 ? ), 
  * algebra ( trig and basic calculus ) * geometry ( stereometry ) * informatics ( computer science ) * pe ( two hours a week , some strength and agility training and a mixed gender team game like volleyball , handball or basketball ) * english back then we did n't have standard state examinations , you had to take five graduation exams : maths , lit and three electives . 
  i took cs , astronomy and chemistry . 
  my institute entrance exams were maths , cs , russian and english . 
  geography ended in grade 9 or 10 . 
  drafting and shop class/home ec ended in grade 9 . 
  drawing and music ended in grade 5 or even grade 3 , i ca n't remember . 
  russian schools are not as big as american ones . 
  my year had around 100 graduates , and we were baby boomers . 
  not true . 
  some people do . 
  yoga pants on priests ? 
  igel ? 
  that was a wolf , not a hedgehog !, 
  we 've lost this distinction in russian . 
  are grandparents not family ? 
  mandatory until the end of school . 
  i started changing some letters to suit my writing style when taking notes , but the graduation essay had to be written in standard cursive . 
  i just checked my notes , and i am still writing in modified cursive . 
  you 're thinking of italics . 
  [ major denis yevsyukov went postal in a supermarket , killing 2 and wounding 7 ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/moscow_cop_gets_life_in_prison_for_supermarket_shooting_rampage/1962911.html ) . 
  he 's now in a supermax facility beyond the polar circle . 
  [ policemen in the dalny precinct of kazan routinely tortured detainees and killed one by sodomizing him with a champagne bottle ] ( http://hro.rightsinrussia.info/hro-org/torture-11 ) . 
  [ the head of the anti-corruption police unit had a room literally full of cash ] ( https://rbth.com/politics_and_society/2016/09/13/head-of-russian-anticorruption-unit-caught-with-140-million-in-cash_629607 ), 
  prace and budynok sound ukrainian rather than russian . 
  we thought you were christopher walken . 
  yep , simple conditionals and reported speech are the same as regular speech in russian , and second/third conditionals are constructed by shifting everything into the past and sprinkling the sentence with several \u0431\u044b . 
  why are these considered russicisms ? 
  the words are unfamiliar to me so i ca n't infer the grammar . 
   also the intricacies of german subjunctives go over many people 's head . 
  do you mean konjunktiv i/indirect speech ( `` ich habe gesagt , dass ich kein bauer * sei * '' ) or something even more complicated ? 
  declension of cardinal numbers is likely the hardest part of the russian language . 
  even bloody tv and radio presenters can not handle them . 
  when i heard one correctly say `` the new model will be outfitted with either 128 or 256 gb of ram '' without skipping a beat i was literally amazed . 
  many people ca n't even say ordinal numbers correctly . 
  try reading the signs there . 
  we are protected from the worst monstrosities by our alphabet , so loanwords are either spelled in english and are understood to be foreign ( e.g. , `` sale % sale % sale '' in a shop window ) , or are written as they sound in russian ( with some etymological adaptations , so microsoft and mcdonalds are written/pronounced \u041c ** \u0438 ** \u043a\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0444\u0442 and \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b ** \u044c ** \u0434\u0441 by everyone except their respective copywriters ) . 
  they are declined according to the rules of the russian language by everyone except copywriters . 
  yep , and greek is fun to decipher . 
  `` nope , that 's not ` idiot george ' , that 's ` independent farmer ' '' . 
   by simply using the same alphabet you can read signs , get some idea of what type a shop is etc. 
  you do n't need to speak italian to find your way to milan or locate a bank in italy for example if you 're from another latin alphabet country . 
  have you been to budapest ?
