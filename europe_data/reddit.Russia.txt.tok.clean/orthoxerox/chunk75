  \u0421\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439 means both in russian , you have to say `` the root of celery '' or `` the stalk of celery '' to disambiguate . 
  korobeiniki , the folk song with porn plot lyrics . 
  most russians have played tetris on chinese handheld consoles with monochrome lcd screens and no music . 
  1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 ( apple ) , 9 are used here as well . 
  depends on the occasion . 
  if it 's a celebration , you are expected to toast different people and come up with longish entertaining toasts . 
  like , you toast the newlyweds , both sets of parents , etc. 
  if it 's social drinking , you are still expected to toast different things every time , preferrably something witty that underlines ongoing banter . 
  for example , if someone was talking about a new pc they 'd bought , `` to moore 's law ! '', 
  would be a good toast . 
  any carbonated drink with fruit flavouring is \u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0434 / lemonade . 
  any still drink made of water , sugar , fruit juice/syrup and possible mint is \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0434 / homemade lemonade . 
  any carbonated soft drink is \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430 / carbonated water or simply gazirovka . 
  carbonated water is strangely enough called \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0441 \u0433\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c / water with gas .

  i hiked round the summit of katrin in leather shoes just to spite an old austrian fart we met at the almhuette who said we were n't equipped properly . 
   is there anything interesting about ulm ? 
  a talented , but relatively obscure german composer was from ulm . 
  last name only sounds rude in russian , this is what a teacher or a sergeant or a displeased boss would call you . 
  if you 're speaking english , then `` mr lastname '' or `` ms lastname '' is ok ; it sounds rather formal , but does n't imply vertical distance between you . 
  a proper russian formal name is first name + patronymic + [ v-pronouns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%e2%80%93v_distinction ) . 
  in business context you can get away with first name + v-pronouns , unless you 're talking to a boss . 
  in english , first name + you wo n't offend practically anyone in russia as long as you 're past the first formal introductions and do n't use `` mr katzenjammer '' and `` ivan '' in the same sentence . 
  i 've even come up with yet another latin alphabet for russian , based on cp1250 to support legacy computers , it would contain a\u00c4bc\u0106de\u011afghijklmno\u00d6 prs\u0160\u015atu\u00dcvyz\u017d ' ( no q , w , x , and i wish there was a \u00db to switch from diareses to circumflexes ) . 
  it does n't support 1:1 correspondence between latin and cyrillic letters like vukovica , but can be read rather easily and looks very slavic . 
  however , i can not recommend it for two reasons . 
  one is qwerty , which is a terrible layout compared to \u0419\u0426\u0423\u041a\u0415\u041d . 
  a jcuken layout is theoretically possible , but typing on a jcuken keyboard is impossible if you know qwerty already . 
  the other one is my hatred of direct loanwords like fa\u00e7ade in english ( not spelled fassard ) or job in german ( not spelled dschob ) . 
  cyrillic forces you to adapt the spelling , but latinised russian would be full of shit like `` na primaries demokratov v ohio pobedila hillary clinton '' instead of `` na prajmeriz demokratov v ogajo pobedila hillari klinton '' and companies refusing to adapt their names to fejsbuk and b\u011b-\u011am-v\u011b when writing in russian . 
  too pro-putin for my taste . 
  i lurk to help out foreigners asking questions . 
  ah , yes , that 's him . 
  if test is about test driving an android astronaut when launching a probe to the rings of saturn , then yes . 
  thanks, 
  i liked the other failed contact novels more than solaris for some reason . 
  the stories of pirx the pilot are even better , in my opinion . 
  [ tikhy don ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_quiet_flows_the_don ) by mikhail sholokhov . 
  makes you appreciate the scope of our civil war and the ruination is has brought . 
  every time you think the land has been drained of all manpower and will to fight it has to bleed again . 
  and nabokov is both a russian and an american writer , since he wrote in both languages . 
  we say '' \u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c \u0437\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 '' , which means `` be healthy '' . 
   we call this ` hidrobiciclet\u0103 ' most people call this ` katamaran ' here , which is technically correct . 
  officially they are called water bicycles as well . 
  more than 100 years old , they belong to mondelez now . 
  very common here as well . 
  both my grandmas have been called by scammers , but thankfully one called me first ( and was really confused ) and the other one has heard about this scam enough time from her more unlucky friends to recognise it . 
  maya whore !, 
  oh , the perverse joy of forcing a brit to communicate with a stranger on the tube . 
  what about numa-numa guys ? 
  not if you boil or soak it well . 
  like my father says , mushrooms are european fugu fish . 
  there are probably dozens of species that we gather and eat . 
  lactarius turpis is my favourite pickle , perhaps . 
   it does kill quite a lot of gypsies apparently ( according to my rom friends ) . 
  as the joke goes , the gypsy died because he ate a death cap . 
  why is he covered in bruises and welts , then ? 
  because he refused to eat it at first . 
  they call them that in bregenz . 
  coffee and [ buterbrod ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=f0kcozhg3oe ) . 
  i would even replace the post of the president with a swiss-style council . 
  we have to get rid of the idea that one person can represent the state . 
  you should have a walking cane with you if you 're so anxious about confronting people treating you like a healthy person . 
  in business context patronymics are used less and less . 
  you would use v-pronouns and their first name only : '' \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d , \u0412\u044b \u0441\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b ? 
  novaya zemlya ( the long narrow island on that map ) is the easternmost point of europe . 
  other than russia ? 
  losing crimea , most likely . 
  but not before cramming it full of infantry equipment . 
  how do you write shinz\u014d abe or hu jintao in latvian ? 
   for several foreign cultures that are widespread in latvia , there are explicit rules on adjusting their names . 
  are they available online in a language other than latvian ? 
   a question for others , how accommodating would your countries be to people with multiple given names , which is common in sweden ? 
  i think you might have to hyphenate them , but generally it should be fine . 
   scarlett : rhett , rhett ... should i go to the magistrate to change my name to n\u00ed heaghra ? 
  what should i do ? 
   rhett butler : frankly , my dear , i do n't give a damn . 
   \u010d do you have \u010d in italian ? 
  what if the father is unknown ? 
  in russia you have to have a given name , a last name and an optional patronymic . 
  you can use only russian letters , and you can for your patronymic according to your national customs ( \u0414\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u0433\u043b\u0443 or \u0431\u0438\u043d \u041c\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0443\u0434 are as valid as \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 ) . 
  family name of a child must be the family name of either parent . 
  masculine/feminine slavic forms are considered the same family name . 
  i have n't been able to find out what happens if you 're a lithuanian , for example . 
  not when you 're on a bus squished so hard by the bodies of others you ca n't undo your coat . 
  chwdp/hwdp in polish . 
  well , lots of people are violating the water code by preventing access to the shoreline , from yakunin to solzhenitsin ( when he was alive ) . 
   ja , mein vater hat zeen it from above and zaid es war ein fery pretty zity , all aglow . 
  i think you can gobble up most of the remaining countries without any problems , until you hit ru/by/ua and turkey . 
  ukraine is already large enough and poor enough to drag down the eu considerably , while russian-belorussian union state and turkey are even bigger and not that much richer . 
  even if either country wants to join i think most eu members will refuse . 
  i think a second speed association agreement with ru and tr will be a good idea if putin/erdogan are ever replaced with sensible political systems . 
  nah , because they do n't care what their teeth look like as long as they 're healthy and strong . 
  can you live outside luxembourg and commute ? 
  it looks small enough on the map . 
  having austria between them helps a bit . 
  naming british films feels like chearing , but * hot fuzz * , * lock , stock and two smoking barrels * and * snatch * . 
  * lola rennt * from germany . 
  ca n't really show off by naming something really obscure . 
  yes , fritz .
