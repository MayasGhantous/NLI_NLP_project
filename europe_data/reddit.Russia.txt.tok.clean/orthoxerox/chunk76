  how do you say `` carbon fibre air train '' in serbo-croatian ? 
  but not before they build some death camps . 
  they are immensely popular in our caucasian republics . 
  take a look at any world-class competition and you 'll see surnames ending with - iev , - oev , - atov . 
  if we 're speaking about ethnic russians , then our literature , our alphabet , our language , our traditional religion , our art and our architecture are all european . 
  like the british , the people do not want to commit 100 % to becoming europeans , but europe has mostly positive connotations of quality ( just add `` euro - '' to anything you 're selling ) , while asia is the land of brutality , sloppiness and greed . 
  of course , native peoples of siberia are asian and are free to associate themselves with asia , they probably do . 
  i will not speak for non-russian peoples of european russia , since i do n't know their civilizational posturing this well . 
  not positive . 
  there are probably lots of police officers that protect and serve the people and are upset by the general mood , but most policemen people remember are not that eager to interact with the general populace since they are always busy doing their job . 
  unless of course you have a crime to report that 's already solved , since their kpis are based on the number of solved crimes . 
  to reach their performance indicators they sometimes resort to threats and torture . 
  sometimes these stories make the news and the cops make it to prison , but not that often , especially since one of the stock phrases of our judiciary is `` the court has no reasons to doubt the testament of the police officer '' . 
   do you believe in one or more god ( s ) ? 
  no  are you a member of a religious society ? 
  ( church of england , folkekirken , etc. ), 
   do you ever say a prayer , meditate , etc ? 
  i meditate , but in a secular context . 
   whether or not you go to a church/mosque/temple etc. 
  or not , do you perceive yourself as ... non-believer . 
   what is your general perception of religion ? 
  there are too many of them for a random one to be true and their comparison with our current knowledge betrays their roots as tools of ancient ages . 
  that 's why they are always reactionary . 
  i also know that spiritual experiences that our brain can generate and process are very powerful and can easily turn a person into a believer . 
  he 's got a puppet parliament , the governors are chosen by him , the largest tv channels all belong to the state directly or indirectly , his friends are surprisingly rich and his son-in-law is as well . 
  our passive obedience to authority interpuncted with ultraviolence . 
  if he had retired in 2008 we would be erecting statues of him by now . 
  in my opinion , he 's outlived his usefulness to the country and his only wish now is to die a president . 
  he wo n't be able to enjoy his retirement . 
  he 's still popular since he 's the only politician given a positive spin tv every evening and any promising independent politicians are pruned before they can pose any threat . 
  first you call the ambulance and the police . 
  they confirm natural death and take the body to the morgue . 
  one of them calls a funerary agent , who materializes like a very somber and respectful vulture and helps you on the second day to buy a plot , a coffin and a tombstone/cross , hire a hearse and a bus , and a restaurant for the wake . 
  on the second day everyone goes to the morgue to say their last words and then the body and the closest circle of people are driven to the church for the last rites . 
  it 's considered terrible luck to overtake the hearse . 
  then everybody goes to the graveyard where the coffin is sealed and is lowered into the grave . 
  everyone drops a fistful of dirt onto it and the local gravediggers fill the grave . 
  finally a wake is held , where everyone eats funeral foods like blins and whole wheat porridge , talks about the deceased and gets drunk . 
  the second wake is on the ninth day , but is rarely held these days . 
  the third wake is on the fortieth day and it 's important , since far-away relatives who could n't come to the funeral on short notice can come to the third wake . 
  this is how funerals work for culturally orthodox russians . 
  fucking with ukraine . 
   anarchy in the uk totally expected it to be the photograph of looters queueing in front of a smashed shop window . 
  yeah , these 're our words for godparents/godchildren too . 
  but what about godparents of your own children ? 
  you son 's godfather is his ojciec chrzestny , but who 's he to * you * ? 
  thermostatic controls are getting popular in places with shitty water supply here , since they will prevent freezing/scalding yourself when one of the mains gives out . 
  is half five 4:30 or 5:30 ? 
  in german it 's the former . 
  white bread , butter and mild cheese . 
  white bread and salami . 
  how big 's werner ? 
  swiss devil ? 
  yes , we call them fig peaches or just flat peaches . 
  not bringing anything ( a gift , flowers or a dessert ) as a guest . 
  the most well-known one is probably [ andrey vlasov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrey_vlasov ) , who was a soviet general captured by the germans in wwii after failing to break out of an encirclement . 
  he agreed to lead a collaborationist army made of soviet pows . 
  [ ivan mazepa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivan_mazepa ) was a cossack hetman who switched sides during the great northern war . 
  he 's still anathemaised by the church . 
  akanye * is * standard russian . 
  having grown up in moscow , i speak standard russian . 
  according to some siberians i have a muscovite accent . 
  i do n't know what they 're talking about . 
  the only word i know that differs in muscovite and standard russian is `` rain ( s ) '' , '' \u0434\u043e\u0436\u0434\u044c / \u0434\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0438 '' . 
  standard russian is / ` do\u0282t\u02b2 / and / d\u0250 ' \u0290d\u02b2i / , muscovite is / ` do\u0255 / and / d\u0250 ' \u0291i / . 
  does pub rhyme with boob for you ? 
  do they still use their epees for mensur to get awesome scars ? 
  moscow average software engineer : 2k gross , or 1750 eur net . 
  senior devs can add another 1k to that . 
  yeah , they have a bad rep in your country . 
  beyond schools for gifted or retarded children we do n't have different academic tracks like in the us or germany . 
  you can skip the last two years of school if you want to pursue a vocational education , and you need to take them to get a tertiary education . 
  other than that , everyone has to learn the same things . 
  or separate words , as in : * she 's my son 's godmother , so she 's my x * he 's the father of my godddaughter , so he 's my y * we both are godparents of this boy , so we are z 's in russian the word is * \u043a\u0443\u043c / \u043a\u0443\u043c\u0430 * ( m/f ) for all these cases . 
  our word for nepotism , * \u043a\u0443\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e * , stems from it . 
  if a spanish couple of gomez garcia and jimenez lopez settles down in your country , will they be allowed to give a mixed family name of gomez jimenez to their child , as is spanish custom ? 
  if a russian couple of ivanov and smirnova settles down in your country , will they be allowed to name their child daria ivanov ** a ** ? 
  if a lithuanian couple of grybauskas and kazlauskien\u0117 settles down in your country , will they be allowed to name their child dalia grybauskait\u0117 ? 
  if both their original culture and your country use latin-based writing systems , will they be allowed to use letters that do not exist in your alphabet ? 
  will they have to modify their names to fit your naming customs or grammar rules ? 
  for reference : [ atv ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/all-terrain_vehicle ) , [ pwc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/personal_water_craft ) . 
  in russia the former is called \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b ( quadrocycle ) and the latter \u0433\u0438\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b ( hydrocycle ) . 
  `` why do you cry , willie ? '', 
  does n't count , of course . 
  for some retarded reason we had to learn translations of pushkin 's poems instead of actual british or american poems . 
  americans seem to * love * their cast-iron pans , seasoned black and smooth . 
  here in russia pretty much everyone uses non-stick pans . 
  are cast-iron pans a purely american craze , or is it us who 're the outlier ? 
  that is , johann/jean/john / ivan/giovanni is the same name for the purpose of this question . 
  i 've just returned from rome , and their winter is awesome . 
  i also know that summers in rome are deadly . 
  this made me wonder , what 's the best major city for every season ? 
  are there any major european cities with clement weather all year round ( no snow/sleet , no deadly heat , no endless rain ) ? 
  let 's see what you know about the country across the pond . 
  there 's a [ blank map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/18ad8ff.png ) for you to draw on . 
  i wonder how many american redditors will have an aneurism after seeing themselves lumped together . 
  edit : cultural subregions , not zones of occupation , 
  examples : your child is playing with the front door of a shop and another customer ca n't get it . 
  `` $ name , please let x in ! '', 
  you 're teaching your child what to do when they 're lost : they should approach the nearest shopkeeper/security guard/policeperson and say loudly , `` x , please help me , i 'm lost ! '',
