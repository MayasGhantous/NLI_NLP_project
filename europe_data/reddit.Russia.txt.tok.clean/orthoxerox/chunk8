  yes , since it 's hard to define what europe is . 
  geographically it certainly is , just like moscow or lipetsk are . 
  i wo n't dare define what it means to be culturally european . 
  - protestant ethics ? 
  what about france ? 
  - christianity ? 
  what about bosnia and ethiopia ? 
  - humanism and rule of law ? 
  what about canada ? 
  remember john lennon ? 
  have some shit on easter , then , 
  you forgot [ paskha ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paskha ) and eggs . 
  put swimming goggles on if you have them . 
  your employer does it for you generally . 
  if you 're self-employed or want to get a tax return , you have to file a paper form . 
  you can prefill the form on the tax inspection website , but you still have to file a paper form . 
  p.s.feel free to correct me , i have n't filed any tax forms in the last ten years . 
  it means `` are you trolling me ? '', 
  gyros and schweinshaxe have been mentioned , so i 'll say : - greek tzatziki - austrian rindsuppe mit leberknoedeln - italian caprese salad, 
  why is it a problem ? 
  more likely chinese , indians , brazilians . 
  in 1169 andrey bogolyubsky took kiev , but remained the grand prince of vladimir , giving kiev to his younger brother gleb . 
  this meant that kiev had lost its primacy among the rus lands and vladimir was now the seniormost principality . 
  i hope russia will not end with taking kiev as well . 
  that 's almost like saying the woman in your dmv worked for the government under obama . 
  what government ? 
  his first government post was in st. pete under mayor sobchak . 
  yeah , and mongolia is the empire of genghis khan , just a really small one . 
  does ussr exist ? 
  that 's news to me . 
  roscomnadzor would block their ip in russia until they deleted the offending content . 
  yes , just like georgia or lithuania . 
  the difference is that you have some reasoning behind `` perhaps '' , some probability that you 've estimated as sufficient based on something you know . 
  in avos and nebos , there 's no such reasoning , you simply select the option you want . 
  for example , you can leave your milk cooking on the stove with the words `` avos it wo n't boil '' , even though you do n't know how close it is to the boiling point and if you 'll be gone a sufficiently short amount of time . 
  i 'm going to sound stereotypical , but in russian we have \u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u044c and \u043d\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0441\u044c . 
  the first one expresses your unjustified hope that something will happen . 
  `` let 's go to the mall , avos we will find sergey there '' . 
  the other one expresses your unjustified opinion that something has happened or someone will act in a specific way . 
  `` i ca n't find sergey anywhere . 
  nebos he 's gone to the mall . '', 
  in russia these words are often referenced to describe our lack of proper planning or discipline . 
  upd : and then someone has to use their smekalka and your mom to fix the resulting mess . 
  in russian i would use it only in a sentence like `` after wwii it took ussr ten years to flush the last upa niedobitek/nedobitok out of the ukrainian forests '' . 
  google suggests `` niedobitek '' , which sounds ridiculous to my russian ear . 
  ** russian ** * challenge * : there 's no russian word that describes something hard , something that tests your skills , but something you can overcome and improve yourself through that as well . 
  the nearest word , * \u0432\u044b\u0437\u043e\u0432 * , implies aggression from the challenger , makes them an active party , a malicious force . 
  * survivalist * : a person interested in guns , canned meat , orienteering and building a fort in the woods . 
  you can say * survival specialist * , but that sounds more like a guy who knows how to survive a regional catastrophe like a tsunami or an earthquake , not someone who prepares for the collapse of civilization worldwide . 
  there 's a slang word * \u0436\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a * , but that 's more of an armchair survivalist . 
  where 's donetsk republic ? 
  otoh , there 's a tiny galicia in the western ukraine . 
  of course they 're not , they 're eu citizens . 
  some are not , but their campaigning can frighten estonia enough to grant them all proper estonian citizenship . 
  i think she needs professional medical help . 
  if s/he 's continually changing sexual partners there must be something wrong either with her/his emotions ( s/he 's unable to forge a lasting connection with another person or uses sex to treat emotional distress , like people with bulimia use food ) or her/his sex drive . 
  the blood sausage probably has a hachek over the `` s '' . 
  we should clearly , erm , `` protect '' this obviously russia-influenced culture immediately . 
  not only in russian , but in many other slavic languages . 
  well , they are already showing different maps of kashmir for india , china and pakistan . 
  have you literally elected a pussy ? 
  you can always wait until vienna metro reaches you in 200 years . 
  there 's always a way out : sell every factory to western companies , then have the right wing organize another maidan , oust the president , nationalize the industry and decline to pay the loan . 
  this of course will lead to russia occupying the east and the west crawling back to europe , since they wo n't have anything left . 
  yeah , not a way out if you 're not russia . 
  now putin can say , `` well , if you do n't accept crimea joining russia , why should i care about you not accepting ukraine joining russia '' and send the tanks rolling . 
  english has so many homophones that it naturally uses a lot of puns in its humor . 
  russian has longer words and you can usually easily tell different parts of speech apart , so you either need a convoluted setup for a pun or you replace it with a different type of a joke . 
  nah , it was me who edited the quote and added the word `` both '' to make fun of the relatively small size of their air force . 
   if asked , the czech republic is ready to deploy its military aircraft in protection of countries close to ukraine , defence minister martin stropnick\u00fd said . 
  speaking on czech tv on sunday , mr stropnick\u00fd said no such petition had arrived ; however , if need be , both czech fighter jets could be deployed in romania or other countries in the region . 
  the defence minister also said the czech army was most likely not going to take party in any massive nato exercise in response to russia 's military activities in ukraine . 
  no , it means exactly what you wanted to say . 
  also , macedonia is a wonderful berserk button to press when talking to ** any ** greek . 
  actually , glass boxes were originally introduced to reduce voting fraud , this way everyone can see there 's no ballot stuffing . 
  a : may i have a crumpet , please ? 
  b : * ( hands a a crumpet ) * please , that would be six and six . 
  a : thank you . 
  * ( hands b the money ) * please . 
  b : please . 
  have a nice day !, 
  that does n't sound like proper english to me . 
  strilkove is actually * on * the crimean peninsula but outside the borders of arc . 
  that `` thin peninsula '' , the arabat spit , is not attached to the mainland . 
  i 'm not defending the hostile actions , but trying to add some clarity . 
  you 're right . 
  same word in russian . 
  just like we have one for `` please '' , `` there you go '' and `` my pleasure '' . 
  i guess the british are enjoying their schadenfreude now . 
  you can not just * declare * a protest in russia . 
  you have to submit an application to ( in moscow ) the mayor 's office , they can examine it however long they want and reject your application on the day before the protest , suggesting that you hold it in the middle of nowhere instead , so they do n't have to divert traffic and mobilize additional police . 
  somehow they managed to approve a pro-intervention concert right under the kremlin walls in a single day , though . 
  and of course you can not ask anyone to come until the application is approved , since that would mean you 're inviting them to take part in an * illegal * protest . 
  oh , man , feels like rodina ... 
   it used to be divided so many times that we should get rid of them nah , that 's what i say about poland . 
  just kidding , 
  i wanted to show that ukraine is much more complex than west vs. southeast and that most imperialist or nationalist infographics posted here are wrong . 
  who do you imply i am ? 
  as a russian , i can easily tell russian , belorussian and ukrainian apart . 
  polish is also easy , rzwshrzwshrzwsh .
