you must be unaware that the current russian presence in the middle east is woefully inadequate to do anything . 
  and they wo n't be coming back since russian propaganda already claimed grand victory . 
  i 'm going to be laughing hard at their mental gymnastics when palmira that they fought so hard to liberate is lost again . 
  3rd time 's the charm they say . 
  those are all on friendly terms with each other . 
  the darkest would be if clinton is elected . 
  what if i told you that the same people who voted in in the 1975 are the same ones who voted out ? 
  have the 16 year olds been able to see what it was like before ? 
  how much did it pay ? 
  hooligans are probably fans of peter the great . 
  this sounds like a boy crying for wolf to come . 
  imagine if wolf does show up . 
  with bombs and automatic weapons . 
  edit : remembered a scene from `` nightmare on elm street 3 '' where kincaid literally called freddy kruger pussy . 
  he got killed promptly after . 
  he did n't have to do anything to fuck it up . 
  the feudal lords that he 's appointed ( and did not remove because they are his friends ) did that for him . 
  russia is neofeudalism - top bureaucratic positions are inherited . 
  so the state would post propaganda about it 's abject incompetence ? 
  they get lost . 
  literally : http://tass.ru/proisshestviya/2145760 http://rg.ru/2015/07/28/prokurori.html http://rusrand.ru/analytics/virtualnyy-pobeg-realnyh-podozrevaemyh approximately 270 000 cases got lost . 
  this is not over 1 year , but it is extremely significant since there are only 930 000 new cases per year . 
  the 2nd link is the state 's very own newspaper which publishes new laws . 
  there is no source more official than that . 
  he wanted ** an ** example . 
  not ** recent example ** . 
  what he replied with was exactly this : http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/moving_the_goalposts, 
  you wanted an example of  `` any case where someone is convicted for political speech in the us . '', 
  you received it . 
  case closed . 
  you lost . 
  this account has content that is at least 6 years old and it been constantly updated over the years with posts and photos . 
  occam 's razor suggests that this account being real is far more likelier than it being fake . 
  no one would give a damn about a guy from an obscure movement to update his page with new content over 6 years . 
  the man 's face is clearly visible at 0:21 in this video . 
  here is just one of many photos from the account that exactly matches the man in the video : https://vk.com/id29866724?z=photo29866724_283059710%2falbum29866724_0%2frev you should change your name from commie_infiltrator to commie_retard , because you 're too stupid to check the facts before posting . 
  correct , you stand about 30 % chance of acquittal in a us court . 
  it is about 0.6 % in russia . 
  however it is the rate when the case actually goes to trial . 
  less than 50 % cases in russia for non-violent crimes do . 
  in the us more than 90 percent of defendants plead guilty rather than go to trial . 
  http://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/types-cases/criminal-cases there is no plea bargaining in russia . 
  so simple math suggests that in average case the man 's odds to go free are far superior in russia than in the us if he gets prosecuted . 
  false ? 
  the guy this thread is about has not been convicted either . 
   you will be hard pressed to find any case where someone is convicted for political speech in the us . 
  i tried , and failed . 
  hard pressed ? 
  took me about a minute of googling and another 5 seconds of searching for word `` sentenced '' : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mccarthyism  the alien registration act or smith act of 1940 made it a criminal offense for anyone to `` knowingly or willfully advocate , abet , advise or teach the [ ... ] desirability or propriety of overthrowing the government of the united states or of any state by force or violence , or for anyone to organize any association which teaches , advises or encourages such an overthrow , or for anyone to become a member of or to affiliate with any such association '' . 
  hundreds of communists and others were prosecuted under this law between 1941 and 1957 . 
  eleven leaders of the communist party were convicted under the smith act in 1949 in the foley square trial . 
  ten defendants were given sentences of five years and the eleventh was sentenced to three years . 
  the defense attorneys were cited for contempt of court and given prison sentences . 
  checkmate , mr. russian . 
  grand jury asserted it was n't a terroristic threat . 
  you wan na claim they did n't understand the difference too ? 
  many people questioned me and downvoted me when i asserted this guy 's connection to nazis . 
  well here you go folks , here 's the best proof you can get , straight from the horse 's mouth , i found this guy 's vk page : his vk page : https://vk.com/id29866724 virtually every post is about `` purity of aryan race '' , old norse pagan religions , pagan metal music , etc. 
  and photos of him with a flag of his would-be republic amongst calls for secession . 
  https://vk.com/id29866724?w=wall29866724_5401 you might wan na google translate this , he wants `` eternal glory and eternal memory '' for one of the most famous nazi tankers for fighting against `` moscow-bolshevist plague '' . 
  you wanted proof of the guy 's connection to nazis - i gave you proof . 
  then you posted an irrelevant link . 
  anyway , here 's the best proof you can get , straight from the horse 's mouth , i found this guy 's vk page : his vk page : https://vk.com/id29866724 virtually every post is about `` purity of aryan race '' , old norse pagan religions , pagan metal music , etc. 
  and photos of him with a flag of his would-be republic amongst calls for secession . 
  https://vk.com/id29866724?w=wall29866724_5401 you might wan na google translate this , he wants `` eternal glory and eternal memory '' for one of the most famous nazi tankers for fighting against `` moscow-bolshevist plague '' . 
  are you still going to claim he has nothing to do with nazis ? 
  his vk page : https://vk.com/id29866724 virtually every post is about `` purity of aryan race '' , old norse pagan religions , pagan metal music , etc. 
  and photos of him with a flag of his would-be republic amongst calls for secession . 
  https://vk.com/id29866724?w=wall29866724_5401 you might wan na google translate this , he wants `` eternal glory and eternal memory '' for one of the most famous nazi tankers for fighting against `` moscow-bolshevist plague '' . 
  these are different people you 're talking about . 
  how do you explain this guy :  he was told what he posted was a `` terroristic threat . '', 
  the lyrics read : `` f -- a boston bombinb [ sic ] wait til u see the sh -- i do , i ` ma be famous for rapping , and beat every murder charge that comes across me . '', 
  how does talking about `` beating murder charges '' equate to a `` terroristic threat '' ? 
  i 'm pretty sure i can beat any murder charge that comes my way too , by virtue of not having murdered anyone . 
  it 's in the video itself , they tell the guy he 's arrested on the basis of article 282 , pt .1 of russian criminal code , for posting a comment in the group `` russkoyazichnii banderovets '' which roughly translates to `` russian-speaking bandera follower '' . 
  bandera mentioned here being of course this guy : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stepan_bandera his connection to nazis is detailed right there :  oun leaders andriy melnyk and bandera were recruited before world war ii into the nazi germany military intelligence abwehr for espionage , counter-espionage and sabotage . 
  the guy in the video wanted violent secession posting in a group dedicated to a certain ukrainian nazi collaborator . 
  people in the link want to violently destroy a country ( if we take them at face value , which we should n't ) . 
  you still want to say it 's a stretch to compare them ? 
  do n't like that example ? 
  here 's more from the west : http://www.businessinsider.com/people-arrested-for-facebook-posts-2013-7?op=1 the guy in the video was arrested for posting comments in a group dedicated to ukrainian nazi collaborators . 
  people in the link got arrested for tasteless jokes . 
  who 's the land of the free now , grandma ? 
  you 're wrong . 
  you misunderstand whom she 's going to attack . 
  not poroshenko , she 's on his side . 
  she 's a national hero and her return is a tremendous victory for poroshenko . 
  now he will use her to attack his enemies in parliament and they wo n't risk to clash with national hero - it will not go well for them . 
   iraq turned out pretty fine after the invasion . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iraqi_civil_war_%282014%e2%80%93present%29 what part of this is `` pretty fine '' ? 
  this is another propaganda piece . 
  all russia produces is smoke and mirrors . 
  the olympics , the world cup , these happen because they are excellent opportunities for corruption . 
  the olympics cost 7x the original cost . 
  consider for example `` importozameshenie '' , i.e. 
  replacing imported goods from sanctioning countries with local produced ones . 
  nobody talks about it on state-controlled television because there are no fools to take loans with rate being 20 % + no one is going to invest anything in building any sort of factories or plants or what have you . 
  this despite chinese salaries now being 1.5 x russian ones . 
  the wanton corruption makes it anything but profitable . 
  i know literally nobody who uses my.mail.ru .
