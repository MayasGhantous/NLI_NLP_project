kaliningrad is too small . 
  sibiria is ok . nobody knows what 's going on there . 
  also you will need support from locals . 
   what are the motives here ? 
  most thinking people here asking this . 
  welp , it 's `` tactic '' of soviet and russia army . 
  `` we have nothing to do with this '' , until somehow magically a soviet \\ russia flag appears above capital . 
  i do n't remember such thing . 
  can you provide some quote ? 
  [ i guess this should explain it . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/administrative_resource ) if you are working for government controlled organisations or companies , and has `` low '' social position ( so no manager from gazprom ) , you are fucked . 
   openly criticize it even when there are times america is n't even doing anything wrong or involved in something . 
  we have those too . 
  they are a just getting detained by police . 
  see news about yesterday anti-war rally in moscow . 
   because i get the impression that they are celebrating the things russia is doing media created image . 
  most people have other stuff to do . 
  here is an [ example of forced meeting ] ( http://youtu.be/a8yivalxnfa ) . 
  just people brought to stand and hold banners . 
  they are do n't want to be there . 
  well shit, 
   are you being sarcastic nah , there was too much freedom for everyone to do almost everything . 
  some people ( mostly thugs and politicians ) used it in own favor , and lots of people suffered cause of it . 
  politicians gave promises and never fullfiled them . 
  and at some point a thug would want to become a politician , with all the consequences . 
  so people abstract themself from it . 
  and after yeltsin , putin was a breath of fresh air . 
  yet if you breathe same air for dozen of years , air only getting worse . 
   i just seem to run into so many people online that are willing to make excuses for literally any and every action russia takes . 
  basically it just imperative mindset -- * russia strong * . 
  translation :  i , of course , despise my fatherland from head to toe - but i feel pity , if a foreigner shares with me this feeling . 
  how is that ? 
  after dissapointment ( there was toooo much freedom ) of 90th most people are indifferent to politics . 
  all other are getting payed or forced to participate . 
  any one supporting any mainstream party by himself usually consider not a sane person . 
   the biggest country in the world thinking the ussr was a cool idea and time to bring it back do you realise it is people like [ this ] ( http://www.ipnews.in.ua/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/communists_mosc230210_1.jpg ) and all others are getting payed for `` support '' ? 
  it is idea of one man only . 
  as soon as number of dead russian soldiers on vacation hit certain number a shit storm will begin . 
   calling us `` little russia '' it comes from `` the little engine that could '' , in russian it sounds really nice . 
  i would rather see real international army ( not exactly affiliated to any one ) . 
  so there wo n't be any discrepancies by russian side . 
  how is exactly telling someone you 're gon na hit him before you actually hit makes beating up justified ? 
  better not to send soldiers , but un peacekeepers . 
  peace enforcement and shit . 
  chill man . 
  feels like you think i implying that finland is what it is because of the * great mother russia * . 
  i 'm rather implying what russia could have become if not some disastrous historic events . 
  at least send un forces . 
  un forces can not be regarded as `` enemy '' forces . 
  i watched yesterday 's un meeting and oh god these people are * concerned * . 
   when did american military invade ? 
  2001 afganistan and 2003 iraq . 
  seems / r/polandball to me, 
  what kind of errors ? 
  an intersting fact -- starting today map shows chechnya and dagestan as countries , similar to south ossetia and abkhazia . 
  as if they have been recently occuiped . 
  yesterday it was n't there . 
  it 's funny cause it is true . 
   returned ~ 200m usd well shit, 
  i always thought of suomi as `` the little russia that could '' ( or rather `` what russia could 've become '' ) . 
  you fuckers are all right . 
   anti-european/anti-western sentiments have skyrocketed it goes like this : maidan - no one gives a damn ( disregard social media ) - maidan violence - fuck banderovtsy/yay revolutionaries - revolution - fuck junta/yay freedom for ukraine - crimea - yay putin/wtf - saction inbound - fuck west/oh crap - more saction inbound - fuck west/oh crap it 's mostly reactionary, 
  well , yes , considerable ... but shenanigans first . 
  they were ok previously . 
  jokes aside . 
  for such thing putin needs some shenanigans to happen in baltics or poland . 
  and some support from locals . 
  which is obviously not gon na happen . 
  please do . 
   russian politicians are actively dumping their european properties since autumn but are they really doing it ? 
  yes . 
  million times yes . 
  we should fight fire with fire . 
   do n't wait for germany , france , italy & spain nice partnership . 
   no resistance from the eu no real support to the non-member of eu . 
  huilo is not that insane to go after eu . 
  since 99 % of politicians in russia have property in europe . 
   will poles and balts be next ? 
  here is the tricky part -- not all soldiers are knowing ( or rather were told ) where are they going . 
  but ffs why we have to do with all this shit . 
  it 's a bunch of thugs there . 
  translation :  no regular customer , a sane person will eat blue cheese ( lit . 
  in russian `` cheese with mould '' ) or ham . 
  and those who can eat these products , can afford to fly to france and bring back `` under his arm . '', 
  or purchase in poland . 
  nato was created as anti-soviet defense block , since ussr disbands itself ( with warsaw pact ) there is no reason for nato to exist . 
  there was something about `` russkis out , americans in '' . 
  yet i do realise there are more to it than just that . 
   stop provoking your neighbours please provide examples from 1990 till 2013 . 
   then you too can attain closer ties with the west and we can put this shit behind us . 
  as i said it somewhere else : russia should just stop with this bullshit ( stop demonizing nato ) and go for nato membership . 
  yet putin need `` real '' threat outside of russia . 
  well , i am supporter of further federalization with decentralization , cause ... you know ... russia is federation . 
  kinda . 
  yet i 'm can be prosecuted for supporting it . 
  it wo n't solve africa 's problem , but africans solve their problem by running from it . 
   fear that we might lose just a little of the riches that we have it is not that simple . 
  sure thing , pal . 
  you wish . 
  not after ww2 .
