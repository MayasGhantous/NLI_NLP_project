  you ca n't really get anything from what you wrote than that `` german or polish minority is better than russian '' . 
   protecting them the russian way ? 
  now you understand . 
  why on earth do you bring this up ? 
  europe has * framework convention for the protection of national minorities * and other stuff . 
  and the notion of tolerance , respect and so on . 
  sorry , in modern world , the authority of media is quite low . 
  in this particular article , it 's only tales from some interviews that one could easily make up . 
  it 's even easier than photoshop-ing . 
  i usually read those as literary fiction , because nothing of it can be verified by hand , only taken word for it . 
  why would n't it ponder it , if it 's an official effort by the u.s. ? 
   i do n't mind minority , but i would rather prefer german/polish one than russian that 's just racist . 
  sorry i do n't understand that . 
  you do n't choose and prefer minorities , you protect them . 
  that 's european . 
   these countries are already filled with a huge share of non-native people , nor does it change the fact that these countries already face huge integration problems with their current non-native people . 
  yep , kinda hard to integrate when you 're stateless . 
  it 's no wonder you are hostile to new immigrants if you are hostile towards part of your own population living there for decades already , and having nowhere else to go . 
  and who are not very different from you culturally ( i have zero problems interacting with estonians  ) you can justify that with ussr or whatever but i think it 's not really european behavior , a least not the one i have always imagined . 
  it can be understood in case of latvia or estonia , but in lithuania the `` native '' population was 85 % in 2011 according to the census , and i can imagine it 's even more now . 
  the same trend is in other baltic states . 
  look , almost every country in the eu has some minority , in some countries ( especially small ones ) recent immigrants have constituted more than a quarter of population even before the crisis . 
  oh , please . 
  novaya gazeta has suddenly become evidence , sure ... 
  there 's not even a word about olympics or sochi in that article whatsoever . 
  since immigration is kinda loosely defined , you can stretch it to apply to former soviet citizens in baltics . 
  us arguing about it would be a mutual waste of time . 
  but you can not use it as a justification for why you do n't want to accept current migrants as we countries do , because the situations are not similar . 
  do n't exaggerate . 
  the protests were not mean to praise their death , they were meant to praise the prophet . 
  anyway , i do n't see how charlie is good ... 
  they are deliberately trying to hurt people 's souls . 
  people wishing them dead are a logical consequence . 
   evidence indicates which evidence ? 
  anyone can judge by seeing street photos https://www.google.nl/maps/place/grozny,+chechnya,+russia/@43.3187734,45.7214498,12.25z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x4051d31d2a73eb29:0xbebeb24edaacd29d!8m2!3d43.3168796!4d45.6814856 https://yandex.ru/maps/?ncrnd=2577&amp;ll=45.672159%2c43.358037&amp;z=12&amp;mode=search&amp;ol=geo&amp;ouri=ymapsbm1%3a%2f%2fgeo%3fll%3d45.694914%252c43.317781%26spn%3d0.001%252c0.001%26text%3d%25d0%25a0%25d0%25be%25d1%2581%25d1%2581%25d0%25b8%25d1%258f%252c%2b%25d0%25a7%25d0%25b5%25d1%2587%25d0%25b5%25d0%25bd%25d1%2581%25d0%25ba%25d0%25b0%25d1%258f%2b%25d0%25a0%25d0%25b5%25d1%2581%25d0%25bf%25d1%2583%25d0%25b1%25d0%25bb%25d0%25b8%25d0%25ba%25d0%25b0%252c%2b%25d0%2593%25d1%2580%25d0%25be%25d0%25b7%25d0%25bd%25d1%258b%25d0%25b9&amp;l=pht that 's clearly more than 1 sq km . 
   plus , estonia and latvia already have 30 % and 40 % non-natives ( i.e. 
  immigrants ) ... where are they from , may i ask ? 
  i guess they are from ussr , the country non-existent for more than two decades ... 
  i doubt they can be called immigrants in the sense used here ( international , economic/refugees ) , because at the time of them moving to baltics they were the citizens of a common country ( i.e. 
  they can be considered internal migrants ) . 
  sure , i take your word for it . 
  i can then ask you if there 's solid proof of russia executing the hack ? 
  what i have seen is best counted as indirect proof . 
  more to that , there 's no proof wl got the data from russia ( directly or indirectly ) . 
  and even if they did , why would they care if the data is authentic ? 
  why would this make them `` selling themselves to russia '' ? 
  thanks for sharing an opinion , but there 's no factual proof ( that i know of ) russia is funding wl or that assange is working for russia for non-monetary motives . 
  it 's speculation at this point . 
  wl in itself was n't meant to care for people 's privacy . 
  its purpose is different and somewhat orthogonal to privacy : publication of classified data . 
  so i do n't think you can compare snowden and assange . 
  anyway , in my opinion , the only thing that should matter about wl is whether the leaks are real and not fake . 
   the ussr constitution even stated that every republic has a right to secede after all , they seceded in the end . 
  sorry , i can barely see anything resembling sarcasm here . 
  maybe your comment counts , 
   there are good terrorists !, 
  you mean [ these ] ( https://twitter.com/dalatrm/status/755324899573501952 ) ? 
  this is a very low quality fake . 
  but do believe everything that comes from media . 
  i did n't say it 's used , i just said it 's interesting that it can be . 
  from a linguistical standpoint . 
  hahaha , thanks !, 
  jeez , that 's hilarious !, 
   russian eurovision entrant always absolutely kills it in the people 's choice vote every year regardless of how bad they may be huh , i do n't usually follow eurovision , but were there really bad russian performances there ? 
  the last few that i remember were quite good imo . 
  maybe it 's just because our tastes are different than yours , not because of the perceived ` collective behavior ' . 
  it 's interesting that german language can distinguish these terms in a very similar way russian does . 
   they sent message how they want friendly relations to neighbors yet he doesnt even visit them did he ever get invited ? 
  this movie has 33 % rating out of 9 reviews on rotten tomatoes . 
  critics are calling it ` boring ' . 
  too early to tell , but probably not very good actually ... https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_promise_2016/, 
   so no , russians . 
  not chechen asylum seekers . 
  that 's what you wrote . 
  that 's what the article says . 
  btw , the word ` russians ' can stand for both ethnicity and a political nation , which creates ambiguity . 
  that 's why it 's usually avoided in such cases , and a more neutral ` russian citizen ' is used . 
  take care . 
  basically everyone can afford a bot army nowadays ... 
  it 's funny how we have to read german-language media to prove it to a german ... 
  you know , chechens in russia are russian federation citizens as well ... 
  dude , they have nothing , all they have is empty talk . 
  i really like your approach , i 'm using at as well . 
  so sad that `` reporting '' has replaced fact-checking for many people ... 
  or usa . 
  except that there they have two clowns and no putin , 
  true , but at least they have what they wanted - independence . 
   what else ? 
  holding a referendum while the region is occupied would be the same as signing your own death sentence . 
  i mean , you consciously limit the options of peaceful reunification to those evidently impossible . 
  i can understand your attitude but it 's a dead end . 
  and the longer you are stuck in it , the less likely the reunification will happen at all . 
  i already consider the probability of this happening to be rather low . 
  a lot less likely than some 10-15 years ago . 
   georgia will only accept the referendum if russia completely demilitarizes the region and separatist government steps down . 
  there wo n't be any official deals with separatist government because they are by constitution a terrorist organization , responsible for the ethnic cleansing of the very people who will be voting in that referendum . 
  this attitude is the reason abkhazia is not coming back . 
   georgia will win the referendum fair and square very bold claim , i would n't be so confident . 
   kosovo had just those tiny problems like ethnic cleansings etc. 
  the war and those grave events started after several years of separatist insurgency .
