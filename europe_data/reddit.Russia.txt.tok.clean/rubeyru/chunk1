putin is hitler like literally , did n't you know ? 
  it is the only independent media that is critical to kremlin and writes in english though . 
  novaya gazeta , rbc tv , dozhd tv are the ones that independent as well , but they report only in russian . 
  edit : oh i totally forgot about meduza guys https://meduza.io/en but they are located outside of russia though, 
   independent media enjoy http://www.themoscowtimes.com, 
  very few questioned if this is true or not . 
  the majority just believed in this just because it is forbes . 
  that 's really scary . 
  this article is deleted even from / r/worldnews . 
   there is no possibility of one ethnic group dividing from the united states as a whole . 
  well obviosuly because you are all came there from somewhere else . 
  the us is completely different thing . 
   russia is in big trouble i do n't know man you are too pessimistic . 
  sure there are a lot of problems , but i do n't believe everything is so awful as you portray it . 
  in early 90s there were some people who wanted to be independent . 
  they were n't supported by the majority though . 
  well , we have no ethnic hatred here at all . 
  we have churches and mosques built near each other . 
  huge amount of russian-tatar couples . 
  culturally we are strongly tied . 
  economically the republic is highly developed and independence might look like a good idea , but there are some problems like radical muslim terrorists . 
  for example in 2012 an assassination attempt was made on mufti , his deputy was killed . 
  fsb regularly neutralizes those guys who are coming from middle asia . 
  they are kinda displeased that islam here is moderate . 
  we do n't have any army or special forces , everything is federal . 
  so im afraid that on our own these gentlemen will fuck us up . 
  and hey , we are surrounded by russia after all . 
   the question is are they tatars first and russians second , or is it vice versa ? 
  the question is not really correct . 
  russia is multicultural . 
  we are together since 16-th century . 
  we are both . 
  that 's sort of twisted logic here . 
  if soviet means russian then ukraine = russia . 
  no it was not . 
  it was russian since 1783 till 1917 . 
  my point is that your parallel between china 's and ukraine 's situations is completely invalid . 
   tatarstan is a possibility just because we are muslim ? 
  as a tatar from kazan reading something like this from people who have no single idea what they are talking about is ridiculous . 
  crimea was russian since 1783 . 
  ukraine was landing it to russia for 23 years . 
  get your facts straight . 
   there are no russian soldiers in ukraine , russia does not arm pro-russian terrorists never said that . 
  you see what you want to see so that 's your problems . 
  sure i am . 
  pathetic . 
  this shell will be dropped on heads of civilians of donbass , not on evil russians . 
  that 's disgusting how many upvotes this post has . 
  it does n't matter if they are nice or not . 
  it is about the side they choose . 
  kadyrov and official chechnya are destroying everyone who has connections to isis . 
  and i wo n't call kadyrov a nice guy . 
  the nis was unprofitable until gazprom bought it . 
  that 's a business as it is , not a donation . 
  the song was not so bad at all as well . 
  i liked it . 
  oh , now it 's the moldovan president 's fault . 
  because he is mentally ill and an ass kisser . 
  fascinating . 
   the story is like this : the story is a lot more complicated . 
  even on wiki you 'll read a different story . 
   has no proper infrastructure , education hits the floor , poverty and crime trives and there is need of a proper goverment gdp per capita is on level of moldova . 
  index of economic development , material security and of social protection of the population is higher than in moldova . 
   thanks putin putin had nothing to do with this in 2009 . 
  talk about circlejerk . 
   became a hell-hole need more drama . 
  so why in 2009 he thanked russian peacekeepers and noted the stabilizing role of the present peacekeeping operation ? 
  does he has schizophrenia ? 
  i 'll tell you why . 
  here is the agreement signed in 1992 by moldovan and russian presidents : http://www.peacekeeper.ru/ru/?module=pages&amp;action=view&amp;id=89 it allows russian peacekeepers to remain in the republic of moldova . 
  moldova may withdraw from the agreement unilaterally ( paragraph 8 ) , but it ** still did not do it ** . 
  so yeah , keep circlejerjking . 
  no , it was n't :  joint declaration adopted following talks between president of the russian federation dmitry medvedev , and president of the republic of moldova vladimir voronin and head of transdniestria igor smirnov , barvikha , march 18 , 2009  the leaders of the republic of moldova and transdniestria , hereinafter referred to as the sides , meeting in moscow on march 18 , 2009 , in the presence of the president of the russian federation , expressing satisfaction with the fact that peace has been maintained in the transdniestrian region for many years , guided by their desire to settle the transdniestrian conflict solely by peaceful political means ,  have agreed as follows :  1 . 
  the sides will continue direct contacts in order to reinvigorate the negotiation process on a political settlement of the transdniestrian conflict . 
  the sides will intensify the work of expert groups to elaborate confidence-building measures and to develop cooperation in the transdniestrian region in the economic , social and humanitarian fields . 
  the sides reaffirm the great significance of the `` permanent conference on political issues within the negotiation process towards a transdniestrian settlement '' ( the 5 +2 format ) and will be creating the conditions for the earliest resumption of work in this format , possibly in the first half of 2009 . 
  the sides call upon all participants in the 5 +2 format to contribute to creating those conditions . 
  the sides note the stabilizing role of the present peacekeeping operation in the region and proceed from the advisability of transforming it into a peace guaranteeing operation under the aegis of the osce following a transdniestrian settlement . 
  the sides express gratitude to the russian federation for the mediation efforts , directed at facilitating the search for an enduring and comprehensive transdniestrian settlement option .

  the only opinion i force here is that this guy is a dick . 
  while i not even lightly support his prosecution and the law permitting it . 
   just a bit ironic you 're claiming he forces his opinions on others while he 's the one facing jail time . 
  hard to force opinions on people from a cell . 
  i see no irony here . 
  he kept forcing his views even when the believer guy asked him to be more careful with what he 's saying , that his phrases insult him and might lead him in a court . 
  and he 's not jailed and most likely wo n't be since this is his first delict . 
   he 'd likely be arrested for having such an `` offensive '' item . 
  i guess there is a reason he never wants to go back , even for a visit . 
  you said that there are only bible quotes in your calendar , so i do n't really get why would he be arrested . 
  should i ? 
  are . 
  you . 
  blind ? 
   it does n't mean that the whole `` offending of believers ' feelings '' law is not an absolute bullshit though . 
   to the present as a universal wisdom well i guess it is a wisdom for him , do n't you think ? 
  that 's why he decided to post that quote . 
  you can agree with that or not in a civilized way without insults . 
  but the atheist guy decided to be edgy and offensive . 
  that 's why he is a dick .
