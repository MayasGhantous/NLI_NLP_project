  russians do n't care about romanians actually . 
  you 're literally worse than hitler, 
  so democratic , much liberal, 
  there are other parties ? 
  you 've got to be kidding, 
  belarus is a lanlocked country , for example . 
  you mean weather ? 
  b\u00f8rk, 
  woah , that 's pretty bad, 
  thank you . 
  i know that poroshenko made a lot of promises that he did n't keep after being elected ^ ( our media just wo n't shut up about this ) , but i do n't know anything about yatsenyk . 
  was he a good pm ? 
  good news .

  probably the only reasons for westerners to visit kalmykia .

  tbh , the sovet union existed _ 25 years ago _,

  barsik the cat was the most sane candidate , actually . 
  holy shit , til . 
  i 've heard only good things about riga from russians, 
  / r/imgoingtohellforthis, 
  soviet legacy . 
  basically a bunch of truncated words, 
  the solution is simple - we have to build mountains on our borders !, 
  our neighbors would be pretty happy , i think ... 
  dealing with a bunch of formerly created states some of possess nukes is much harder than dealing with one . 
  he came into my parents tv in 2000 and did n't leave ever since no , thanks .

  potato is life . 
  and the other half are economists, 
  speed ! = stability, 
  that 's what mgts offers in moscow , i suppose ? 
  it does , actually, 
  i wonder how many years it will take for our nation to realise that oil-ridden economy with massive corruption is totally unreliable and can start sinking ... at any moment . 
  it has already reached its limit in 2011 , when gdp growth has slowed down , despite the growing price for oil . 
  with the given circumstances , i am thinking of leaving the country :|, 
  they could 've just said : `` guys , we removed most of country-based ip constraints !, 
  hooray ! '', 
  10 euro / month with the current exchange rate ... 
  i pay much less ( well , about 6 euro ) for the internet itself .

  mostly because of cheap oil .

   savings dropped from 32,6 to 32,8 billion from july to august huh ? 
  in soviet russia , east is west, 
  `` no h\u043e\u043c\u043e '' - our media,
