i wonder how liberal and democratic they actually are their leader zhirinovsky proposed to ban all political parties and make russia a monarchy state again : https://translate.google.ru/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ru&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.newsru.com%2frussia%2f23aug2014%2fzhirinovsky.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url the real liberal party in that list is a rpr-parnas . 
   wtf ? 
  sorry , i meant `` legalization '' . 
  you know today the world obsessed with defending lgbt rights , but pedosexuals get punished in almost every country . 
  it is unjust . 
  there is also a big difference between leftists in various countries . 
  for example many anarchists that i saw in russia ( including myself ) stands for truly freedom including legalisation of pedosexuality , freedom to defend fascism etc while yuropean `` anarchists '' ( we can see them on / r/anarchism ) often prefer stalin-like systems . 
  sorry for this wall of text , i just ca n't restrain my butthurt anymore ... 
  russian . 
  learn it once , and you will be able to speak with almost everyone in russia , ukraine , belarus , georgia , kazakhstan , uzbekistan , azerbaijan ... 
  probably the cheapest fountain pen ink in the world . 
  i 'm just reminding that at the same time a neo-nazi party `` right sector '' still has their leader in rada . 
  i 'm a socialist ( a kropotkinist ) and i dislike muslims as well as i dislike christians because all religions is a bourgeoisie shit used for opressing proletariat ( for example look on modern russia where orthodoxy is used for opressing lgbt and justification of imperialistic policy ) . 
  modern leftists forget it but true socialists of xx century always were antitheistic , remember [ the red terror ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_terror ) , i 'm not a fan of repressions but fighting islam/christianity/judaism / other religious shit is a good thing . 
  i 'm leftist but absolutely ok with this news because fuck religion . 
  bombing turkey is an most effective way to get rid of isis .

  we 're with you guys . 
  `` we '' by yevgeny zamyatin . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/we_ ( novel ) . 
  a great dystopian novel written 28 years before orwell 's `` 1984 '' . 
  translation : of love , of hope , of quiet glory not long i nursed the self-deceit , vanished are adolescent dallies like a dream , like the morning mist ; but still desire burns within us ; beneath the press of fateful power with impatient soul we hark the native country 's summons . 
  we bide with yearning expectation the moment of sacred liberty , as the young lover bides the moment of the promised meeting . 
  the while with liberty we burn , the while our hearts are quick for honour , my friend , to our land we dedicate the soul 's exquisite raptures !, 
  comrade , believe : it will arise , the star of captivating bliss , russia with rouse herself from sleep , and on the ruins of despotism our names will be inscribed !, 
  rhymed translation : not long did youth 's vain hopes delude us , its dreams of love and prideful fame . 
  they briefly , fleetingly pursued us , then passed like mist and no more came . 
  but still we chafe , our hearts afire , under the yoke of tyranny , and , heedful of our country 's plea , her true deliverance desire . 
  we freedom wait with all the fever , the hidden ache and eagerness that ` fore the hour of promised bliss consume the yong and ardent lover . 
  while freedom 's flame within us lives , while we by honour 's voice are guided , to russia , comrade , let us give our spirits whole and undivided . 
  dear friend , have faith : the wakeful skies presage a dawn of wonder - russia shall from her age-old sleep arise , and despotosm impatient crushing , upon its ruins our names incise !,

  religion is a bourgeois instrument created for opressing the proletariat . 
  true socialist must bomb churches and mosques , not praise them . 
  looks like typical russian hospital .

  [ emerald dick ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2o8dui8uqzi ), 
  law enforcement authorities have opened a criminal case against a kazan blogger ramil ibragimov . 
  according to tatarstan 's news resource `` real time '' , the case for ibragimov opened under article 205 of the criminal code ( `` act of terrorism '' ) . 
  according to `` life '' , we are talking about the article 205.2 , which refers to the justification of terrorism . 
  the publication notes that he is under house arrest . 
  earlier ibrahimov published post in social networks , in which he justified the massacre in orlando gay club . 
  the 90s is back !, 
  good . 
  gays are 5 % of the entire population , so there is nothing weird that they 're presented in every movie . 
  it reminds me of this : http://www.perm.kp.ru/daily/26477/3347680/ ( spetsnaz member died trying to save dog from train ) .

  i agree . 
  of course pseudo-socialist totalitarian maduro government should be demolished , but opposition is going to establish far-right pro-american dictatorship ... 
  rise of the far-right movements , i guess . 
   2 % of the vote ? 
  [ 0,73 % ] ( http://www.vybory.izbirkom.ru/region/region/izbirkom?action=show&amp;root=1&amp;tvd=100100067795854&amp;vrn=100100067795849&amp;region=0&amp;global=1&amp;sub_region=0&amp;prver=0&amp;pronetvd=0&amp;vibid=100100067795854&amp;type=242 ) . 
  the other opposition party , yabloko , scored 1,99 % btw . 
  i actually voted for yabloko in 2016 and i regret it now due to the recent scandal with yevgeny roizman :-( . 
  more ( by the same artist ) : https://www.svoboda.org/z/16979,

   would it be 760k or 760kk , communists will find a way to justify it `` for the greater cause '' stalinists * tankies are not real communists . 
  as well as brits still worship churchill ... 
  radical islamism combined with putin 's fascism ... that 's a disgustingly weird shit . 
   russia has denied responsibility and ** the head of france 's cybersecurity agency , guillaume poupard , has said there is no evidence of russian interference ** from the article . 
  debunked by meduza ( one of the most popular opposition news websites ) : https://meduza.io/feature/2017/07/28/vizhu-novosti-chto-glavnyy-istochnik-informatsii-dlya-molodezhi-pervyy-kanal-seriezno ( in russian ) . 
  tl ; dr : channel one is the most popular ** tv ** source of news , not the most popular source of news in general . 
  tl ; dr : he worked together with far-right movement that was banned in russia in 2011 .

  you seem to read too much duginist shit . 
  russia is the mother of europe , and shit like homophobia/imperialism/oppressing opposition is temporary . 
  as an anarcho-paneuropeanist , i honestly believe that sometimes we 'll get rid of all this controversion . 
  just imagine if a russian , a pole , a turk , a french , a silesian etc. . . if all of us would prefer to watch hentai together instead of useless fighting ... 
  this is my dream . 
  / r/russia actually . 
  well russia is more friendly to europe than usa is . 
  it 's time to set up a mesh network i think . 
  cjdns , netsukuku etc. 
  that 's why i support kurdistan rather than turkey . 
  so , nato now praises former waffen-ss members ... disgusting . 
  afaik it 's related to traditional cossack haircut [ chupryna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chupryna ) . 
  there is also a lot of ways to insult russians . 
   especially over them meddling in american elections ? 
   ukrop is a far-right ukrainian nationalist party , but bentley uses the term to describe all government forces hehe , this is wrong . 
  '' \u0423\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043f '' ( `` ukrop '' ) is just another offensive word for describing ukrainians , as well as '' \u0445\u043e\u0445\u043e\u043b '' ( `` hohol '' ) or '' \u0440\u0430\u0433\u0443\u043b\u044c '' ( `` ragul ' '' ) or '' \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442 '' ( `` svidomit '' ) . 
   one of the most prominent is russell bentley , a texas native who describes himself as a pro-russian communist because supporting far-right imperialist government ruled by oligarchs is sooooo communist !, 
  it 's always nice to see complaining about protests in russia from country that elected conservative candidate who works in favor of putin , ex-kgb officer who literally kills his political enemies and puts innocent people in concentration camps in chechnya ... yeah , obedience to right-wing bourgeois government is exactly what russia needs now !,

  so macron now exterminates his enemies ... capitalist `` democracy '' at its finest . 
  check out \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0411\u0438\u0435\u0446 , chairman of revolutionary workers ' party ( the biggest trotskyist organisation in modern russia ) . 
  he stands for returning crimea back to ukraine since the beginning of all this shit , but he is not as major as navalny though . 
  all that migrant crisis shit is just extremely ignorant . 
  it was western world who started libya & syria wars , it is bourgeoisie who responsible for thousands of migrants , and it is capitalists whose heads should be acquaint with the pavement for this . 
  around 625 in russia according to [ interfax ] ( http://www.interfax.ru/russia/432966 ) ( it says 90 thousands per year , so 90000/144 = 625 ) . 
  the founder of thegreatmiddleeast.com lives in baku , and armenia is at war with azerbaijan so expect bias .
