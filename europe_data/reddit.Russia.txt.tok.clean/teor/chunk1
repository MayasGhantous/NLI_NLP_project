so you imply that every other country in eu supports him ? 
  so he is pro-gay then ? 
  with the whole burning people in ovens ? 
  u wot ? 
  so , him banning the `` anti-gay '' actor from russia was just a hissy fit ? 
  that 's kinda cute . 
  good for him non the less , but hissy fits should not be part of foreign relations . 
  * buttmad again ? 
  well i do n't think anyone but russia will sell me an aircraft carrier . 
  okay , fine , i will not buy an aircraft carrier . 
  are you happy now ? 
  a lot of that stuff is a thing in russia too . 
  zapiekankas ( i love me some cottage cheese zapekanka ) , kompot , jello-fish-thing , kogel-mogel , shitty food at schools followed by an awesome desert . 
  buttmad state be buttmad < 3  you are incapable of seeing things as they are , even if there are video evidence . 
  yeah , you posted all dem videos with truth . 
  oh wait , you just cry and try to insult me < 3, 
   most of the world [ sure sure , do n't cry . 
  sure sure . 
  no one understands the plight of buttmad-state ! 1111 putler literally invading . 
  more insults plz < 3, 
  so all your ** `` truth '' ** is just a whine about how evil the ussr is ? 
  crimea river . 
  what truth ? 
  truth of mobs beating people for stating their opinion ? 
  buttmad states be buttmad . 
   you are fucking moron . 
  such a mature and well argumented response . 
  shame i ca n't do that , but i 'm just a putin-bot :( i will never reach the level of wit of ( i already forgot from which buttmad-state you are from ) . 
  such is life . 
   you show up in the massive gathering of angry opposing mob and start expressing your opinion hey , victim-blaming !, 
  awesome stuff . 
  i still do n't see how that makes it safe for people to vote . 
  but i just posted a video that contradicts your words . 
  somehow you try to rationalize it by saying that israeli would do the same to swastika-wearing person . 
  you know , your whole argument can be summed up in * `` but what about israel and swastika ? '' * . 
  clearly not whataboutism . 
   you will get some attention . 
  that 's some double-speak you got there . 
  mob beating a person ! = some attention . 
  [ it ' so nice that mob will not beat people for voicing their opinion . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w9ix3gtsq0&amp;channel=mediaarhiv ) [ good thing ukraine is such a civilized country . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evl9c5u8nus&amp;channel=uc3vu4a8qhzi37hegwyz0jww ) how will you rationalize that ? 
  i bet they were kgb agents or something , clearly not citizens . 
  remember kids , it ai n't whataboutism if it 's ai n't pro-russian !, 
  pro russian symbolic = literally putler invading omg . 
  but using the same logic , are `` pro-russian '' citizens not `` pro-nazi '' ? 
  voting for anything pro-russian would be like voting for nazi party , right ? 
  and why would n't they be hurt for that if a symbolic is enough to get beaten ? 
  you kinda contradict yourself , mate . 
   no one is hurting pro-russian citizens [ suuuuure ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tw70qdlsxu&amp;channel=djdansky ), 
  well there are few things why nothing close to that ( or even related in any way ) will happen to estonia : * estonia is actually a stable and functioning country . 
  * estonia does not have a revolution every few years . 
  * there is this new alliance thing , i think it 's called nato or something . 
  not sure , it 's pretty new . 
  but i heard it 's pretty big and powerful . 
  hey !, 
  it 's me in there !, 
  i want to thank the academy , my mom and all of the russian-hatin ' idiots !, 
  i can barely hold my tears of happiness . 
  this such an honor . 
  can i ask you a serious question ? 
  are you really post this as something good , or you just pretend to be retarded ? 
  [ literally putler , butthurt khokhols < 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=219fyq69c8i ) and what 's up with `` racial slurs '' ? 
  too buttmad to follow your own words ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omi0xmhu3kc ), 
  well it is your ultimate trump card . 
  khokhols just love to yell about holodomor when they got nothing else to say . 
   god , why does the evil amerikkka force the world to hate russians ?!!? 
  seizure again ? 
  oh wait , that 's some feeble attempt to build strawman . 
  are you okay there mate ? 
  did you have a seizure ? 
  khokhols are so cute in their powerless malice < 3 http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/10/20/ukraine-widespread-use-cluster-munitions boom . 
  done . 
  also it 's cute how you go huuuur huuuur racial sluuuuurs duuuur and have no problems using them yourself . 
  kinda hypocritical do n't you think ? 
  discussion 101 - if you want to take the `` moral high ground '' on something , you kinda lose ability to use it . 
  they do n't teach you that in uni ? 
  and what 's with khokhols and question dodging ? 
  ca n't you answer simple question without screaming about putler and holodomor ? 
   ethnic slurs ? 
  not polite . 
  you should probably jump for a bit . 
  do n't want to catch dat `` moscal '' stuff from me . 
   we were talking about crimea , we were talking about civil war . 
  there is no civil war in russia and crimes is in russia . 
  text comprehension , how does it work !? 
  you know , the same hrw you posted made a report on `` indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas with cluster munitions '' from ukrainian military . 
  but i 'm sure that was just putler propaganda rt. 
   he bullshit of `` ukrainian army shell civilians !! 1 ! 11 ! # ! @ '' . 
  implying that ukrainian army does not . 
  cute < 3 and how does any of that related to your inability to use such basic thing as compass , to point out where your hometown is ? 
  how is you message related to anything ? 
  what was that about `` irrelevant bullshit '' again ? 
  that 's a nice compass you edited in . 
  and if you use it and the map you posted , kharkov is literally `` cb '' or `` bcb '' . 
  you should probably see an oculist ( but i doubt he can cure stupidity ) . 
  civil war = irrelevant bullshit . 
  okay then . 
  oh wait , i forgot , there are no people in east ukraine , only `` vata '' and `` coloradi '' , my bad .
