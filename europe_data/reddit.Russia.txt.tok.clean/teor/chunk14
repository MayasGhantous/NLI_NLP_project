  not really . 
  donetsk referendum is a reactional thing . 
  if euro-maidan was peacefull and opinion of east ua actually mattered - nothing would have happened in donetsk . 
  and i do not understand why you emphasize `` ellected '' so much . 
  this officials were elected to take over goverment ? 
  was `` junta minister '' a thing in ua ? 
  or you imply that some thungs force all people of donetsk to vote at gunpoint ? 
   dictatorship by criminals ? 
  are you talking about current ua goverment ? 
  because it sounds like you do . 
   at least the current government is made up from elected officials . 
  so if `` minister of toothbrushes '' takes over the goverment , holding everyone at gunpoint , it 's cool ? 
  since he was elected and stuff . 
  what legitimizes it ? 
  first of all armed take over of goverment . 
  no one really asked east parts of ua if they want it . 
  secondly there is the whole `` right sector '' thing . 
  yes , right now politics kinda avoid them , but before they were all buddy-buddy with them . 
  one of the first laws that junta passed was cancelation of russian language as official in country . 
  since that was a huge problem for ukraine / s there is a lot of people in east ua who are ethnically russian . 
  and they are afraid of goverment , that thinks russian language is a huge problem and it must be dealt with asap . 
  and why are you not talking about euro-maidan ? 
  because it is even less legitimate ? 
  and euro-maidan was not `` random people '' ? 
  or postponing the eu-association pact is a legitimate basis ? 
  and technicaly it 's not their country anymore . 
  country is in hands of junta right now . 
  also , afaik in donetsk they vote for federation , not independence or joining russia . 
  neither . 
  but the thing is , even if donetsk voting was executed perfecly ( by international laws and all that stuff ) - eu and us would n't accept it anyway . 
  because `` huuur huuur putler evil scheme '' . 
  meanwhile euro-maidan is awesome and everything is cool . 
   who took refuge in a building which caught fire during the fight . 
   2 \u00b0 ) it was mostly an accident for the burning part * hey , ivan . 
  * what , ivan ? 
  * let 's burn ourself alive !, 
  * good idea , ivan !, 
  that will help us !, 
  oh and beating up people who jumped from 2nd/3rd floor to escape fire was accident too ? 
  or that 's how you help victims in ua ? 
  also , afaik there is no `` shooters '' alive from that `` accident '' , so can you give a proof of that there was a shooter and he was russian ? 
  j/k , ofc you ca n't . 
   armed thugs can not just occupy official buildings , declare a `` republic '' , abduct , torture and kill people , hold a sham election and expect anyone to recognize it . 
  this thread is about donetsk , not euro-maidan . 
  boom !, 
   russian mp : conchita wurst winning eurovision is ` the end of europe ' oh , i wonder who that was ...  vladimir zhirinovsky described the victory as ` the end of europe in other news , clowns throw pies at each other and stand up comedians make jokes . 
  and that changes what ? 
  it is not hypocrisy ? 
  because 2 girls are totaly at fault here . 
  well that ' l show putler how not to mess with eu !, 
  tbh this really shows just how much hypocrisy there is in people who try to show how much beeter they are than others . 
  was this a surprise ? 
  man in a dress ( or woman with a beard ) - russia mad . 
  speaks against russia - russia mad . 
  and then he ( she ) wins , what a surprise . 
  and writen by ~ ~ putin ~ ~ putler himself !, 
   lets see how can we blame russia for this, 
  so russia is more importan for / r/europe than actual eu countries ? 
  but ofcource . 
  russia is of illuminati and controls the internet , did n't you know ? 
   and beat some random gays in the park i doubt it . 
  you probably do n't have balls for that . 
  but you sympathize with vatniks who do . 
  maybe even envy them , who knows . 
   the joke was actually funny if you need to tell , that your joke was funny - it was n't . 
  if by `` sarcastic '' you mean `` retarded '' - sure , il agree with that . 
   indicate that `` gay '' for europeans is as sacred as `` good '' and `` democratic '' you just went full-retard there . 
  you okay ? 
  maybe you have a stroke or something ? 
  because this literally makes no sense . 
   there ca n't be two opinions about gays there can be infinite number of opinions , but the thing is - why mention them if there was no discussion about gays in this thread ? 
  and thats what makes you a vatnik . 
  it 's kinda like `` white trash '' , only somehow worse . 
  although he may use gay as in merry/happy , but i doubt it . 
  i did want to upvote and agree with you . 
  i really did . 
  but ...  and all that 's good and democratic and gay no . 
  just no . 
  piss off * vatnik * . 
  thats some amazing hypocrisy right there . 
  ** ` murrica ** lel, 
   from usa  calls makarov a glock why . 
  and he was shot by ua police officers . 
  you are not really smart , are you ? 
   caused the russians to horribly kill thousands of innocent german civillians in wwii unlike the peacefull germans . 
  they never did anything close to that . 
  also you spell `` soviets '' wrong . 
  oh and half of the current ukraine parlament are definitely not nazis . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_insurgent_army nooooope , they just like the flag . 
  u mad ? 
  y u so butthurt bro ? 
  and why you tell me about your desire to fuck putin ? 
  just look at all them x markings pictures !, 
  putin is literaly hitler !, 
  pretty much all goverment officials were massacred . 
  and i did n't say that they `` massacred every single russian '' . 
  yes , some were expelled and some killed . 
  but still , there was an attempt at genocide ( or some sort of `` cleansing '' ) in that region . 
  and not a single xssr did anything close to that . 
  most did n't even deport russian population back to russia .
