  was that some sort of sarcasm ? 
  brief history in checnya after fall of ussr : * all xssr ( like belarus ssr , ukraine ssr etc ) hold a referendum and decide to quit ussr . 
  * ussr is in deep shit and does not really care about it , so moscow just accepts everything . 
  * chechen radicals take it as * `` it 's ok to massacre russians now '' * and proceed with that plan . 
  army gets involved , civil war starts . 
  * now terrorists are taken care off ( mostly ) and everything seems fine . 
  now why right now checnya ca n't hold the same referendum as ssr 's back in 90 's ? 
  * only border is with georgia . 
  georgians and chechens are completely different etnicity . 
  * chechnya populated mostly by chechens . 
  * there is no `` great checnya '' country anywhere in the world . 
  * russia is not a collapsing empire . 
  * almost forgot the main part . 
  there are ~ ~ oil ~ ~ terrorists and russia is liberating ~ ~ it ~ ~ them . 
  * and yes , there is still a tension in checnya . 
  try to include muslim region in your contry and see how long will it take for them to start acting too *, 
   ukrainians decided to mass murder innocent polish villagers date march 1943 - 1945  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish-ukrainian_war date 1 november 1918 - 17 july 1919 yep . 
  also * was x 's once * is a funny argument . 
  most of the baltic states were soviet once . 
  borders inside of eu changed a lot in past 200 years too . 
  poor innocent poland :( never ever did anything bad :( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kiev_offensive_ ( 1920 ) ooops, 
  and they did what exactly ? 
  oh , i thought i heard `` ko-ko-ko '' * ( russian joke ) * and here it is - a navalny suporter . 
  well , i do n't think russia will join eu in this century . 
  nor do i think russia needs to join . 
  yes , it would be great ... for eu part of russia , but for asian/siberian/caucass parts ? 
  not so much . 
  and there is a matter of profit . 
  eu will get cheap natural resources - what 's not to like . 
  russia wil get - dunno , new currency or something . 
  only reall alliance i can see in near future is china . 
  and there is a lot of things that hint on it already ( imo ) . 
  in russia minimum ammount of money you need for a month is about 4500 rub , or 65 $ . 
  some people tried to do that , did not work out well . 
  hey , let 's swap our citizenship ? 
  i 'll live in horrible gayrope ( or judging by your post history , australia ) and you live in glorious russia . 
  btw , it 's really easy to get russian citizenship if you are from any western country , but not the other way around , weird huh ? 
  ha ha estonia is so poor , their president picks mushrooms !, 
  what 's next ? 
  he 's not eating banned food ? 
  maybe you do n't even have a retarded ban on food huh ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ plz ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ give ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ good ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ cheese ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ :(, 
   how is it possible literally putin . 
  no , seriously . 
  putin personally was involved in that . 
  and fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck kobzon . 
  i hope he will suffer . 
  like , a lot . 
  first one in my family was some giant and ugly motorola . 
  my personal first was siemens m55 . 
  such a great phone . 
  phew . 
  i feel so much better after seeing this . 
  i can almost forget about how our economy is in a shithole . 
  ave putin !, 
  sure sure , i am kremlinbot and i need rt links . 
  that ` ss why i did not ask for them i did not use le dank proofs maymay, 
  some random tabloid publishes top secret information . 
  nothing wrong here . 
  itt people who did not read the article and proceed to go on a tantrum about evil russkies . 
   business life ( delovaya zhizn ) reports on markets , finance , entrepreneurship , finance , and leisure , ** scarcely an outlet for sensational information . 
  **  however , reveals what appear to be official figures on the number of russian soldiers killed or made invalids but hey , it 's omg evil russia type of story , so it 's all good . 
  but before that he talks about how noone on ukrainian flight controll got punished for sending a plane to a warzone . 
  or something like that , i do n't even know what he is on about . 
   their propaganda machine needs some oiling if you have a good grasp on english language - you can probably get a better job that a `` kremlinbot '' . 
  actually it 's the jew-reptiloids who are behind this . 
  seriously , do n't you watch news or something !, 
   it 's just not `` just '' . 
  they slit the animal 's throat and wait till it bleeds to death . 
  that 's fucking horrible . 
   could you please tell me why i 'm wrong shut up russia is evil, 
  and what about that dead/robed person ? 
  shhhhh , not yet . 
  and the money are endless ? 
  like literally the person would have unlimited amount of money . 
   no shit , but are they physically harming anyone other than the user ? 
  if person buys them for his own money - money will end soon and said person will start robbing and killing people . 
  if drugs are state provided - state literally kills it 's own people with poison . 
  civilized country would not allow that . 
   suppose they get it legally from who ? 
  you do know that hard drugs are literally poison and kill your body ? 
  that 's why they will never be allowed . 
  ever . 
  well it is russia we are talking about , so government killing own people for lulz will not be weird , but still . 
   some argue , and it 's entirely possible that it will be accepted at some point that 14 year olds are old enough to give consent . 
  yeah . 
  it 's funny how the huuuurrr moral staples duuuur person argues for pedophilia . 
  kiddiefiddlers are a-ok , unless they homosex . 
  ah , the classic `` let 's compare 2 unrelated thing and come to a retarded conclusion '' method so popular in true patriots of russia crowd  hard drug addicts do n't harm others and they get money for drugs where ? 
  hard drug trafficking is legal too ? 
   who get consent from their partner that 's why age of consent is a thing . 
  a 5 year old and an 18 year old is two different people . 
   simple guide to russia : there 's moscow , there 's st.petersburg . 
  ftfy, 
  today you do n't beat two people for being gays and tomorrow they will force you to have sex with a cupcake !, 
  what sort of retard-o-logic is this ? 
  that is actually a remarkable achievement . 
  if you shitpost so good that you get banned from there . 
  lol, 
  if only he would spam news about how russia is literally mordor like / u/giggster now that is the sort of people / r/europe needs !,
