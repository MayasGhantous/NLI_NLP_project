  oh lol , a person from / r/politota , nvm then i do n't want to argue with mentally challenged person . 
  in other news - water is actually wet . 
  oh well , let 's hope i will get some good gains before things go back to normal . 
  ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ judging ^ ^ ^ by ^ ^ ^ how ^ ^ ^ slow ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ will ^ ^ ^ probably ^ ^ ^ lift ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ 300kg ^ ^ ^ by ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ time, 
   riding a bike in moscow is almost suicidal , right ? 
  not really . 
  it takes balls , yes , but if you actually learn road rules you will be fine ( and always wear bright clothes + helmet ) . 
  i can ride to work just fine and it takes less time that a car , since you can ride on a sidewalk . 
  outside of moscow on the other hand ... 
  damn i forgot to mention that in my post . 
  yeah , keto right now is really not great . 
  cheese is expensive , bacon is ridiculously expensive , good meat is expensive . 
  the only keto thing you can reasonably afford are eggs and butter . 
  had to drop keto and just stick with low-carb for now , but hey , i can bulk up a bit . 
  even `` pashihonsky '' is better than vomit, 
  well most of my friends do love cheese , but most of the time it 's something more simple ( maasdam , gouda and such ) , very few like stuff like camembert or gargonzola ( ? ), 
   i 'll think of you when i 'm going to buy some saint nectaire , tomme des pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es and comt\u00e9 . 
  i wish you the biggest mice infestation tomorrow < 3, 
  just to clarify it went up a lot for russian rouble . 
  basically in chinese shop you change price to roubles and you get official exchange rate + some sort of extra . 
  in some eu shops when i change to rouble i get price that is less than official exchange rate . 
  prices in chinese shops went up a lot . 
  things are pretty meh-bad right now . 
  it 's not * terribad * , but i prefer it not to be that way . 
  i can finally buy some camembert ( no idea how or why it is sold , but i 'm fine with anything ) and what is even more strange it is sold for the same price before it got banned . 
  prices went up pretty significantly and most shops taken shitty policy of scam discounts -  cheap cheap !, 
  only 50 rubles instead of 100 !!, 
  ! 11 ^ ^ ^ ^ * ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ 500g ^ ^ ^ ^ instead ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ 1kg because of that you really need to watch out in shops and of course only shop to not adopt this shit is non-russian franchise of auchan , that 's kinda ironic ... i guess . 
  pc parts are impossible to buy for reasonable price as well as most electronic goods ( not all ) . 
  for some reason a lot of online eu/us clothing shops prices did not go up that much , so at least i can buy decent clothes . 
  some of my friends also lost jobs and ca n't find a new one . 
  all in all it 's kinda shit , but living in russia you get used to `` kinda shit '' . 
  oh and there is one positive thing - the amount of advertisement in metro / on the streets gone waaaaaay down . 
  i like that a lot . 
  whopsies, 
   see see this and that was illegal that means we can do illegal stuff too  ** tehee ~ ** this is one of the most retarded things in a while . 
   a swedish tank oh snap , shit is about to go down for real, 
  if a single nuke from any country is launched to strike other country the world will end . 
  but that 's not the point . 
  the point was that russia and china can launch enough nukes to completely destroy any country in the world ( usa can do that too ) . 
  your question makes no sense . 
  * russia and china can destroy usa * how ? 
  * with nukes * oh yeah and usa wont respond to that huh !, 
  [ mhm .

  this is just in . 
  reddit user / u/blackgandalfcz says , i quote :  i hate russia more and more ... that is the reason why our economy is in a shithole . 
  new anti- / u/blackgandalfcz ministry will recieve 5b to solve this problem . 
  * - russian news *, 
  you should thank us from saving you from nazito !, 
  is n't it better to die from a ussr tank , than live in world where it is possible for your country to join nazito ? 
  convicts will work and receive a small pay for it . 
  literally no country in the world does that !, 
  ** when will the putler stop !? 
  i can already say , that russians did it and brave ukrainians tried to stop them . 
  that is 100 % truth . 
  also , `` tragedy '' my ass . 
  it 's like calling holocaust a `` jewish tragedy '', 
  ha ha , comrade , what is this putin you speak of ? 
  ~ ~ he never hired me , ~ ~ i mean i never heard about him . 
  now let us speak about military secrets for no reason . 
  captain obvious is on duty ? 
  how nice of you to show up . 
  yes , russkies are not true slavs , only ukraine is of true slav !, 
  of course not . 
  russians are evil mongoloids . 
  nothing good in russia !, 
  putler is behind it !, 
  what 's up with your fixation on azov ? 
  and , as i said , digging trough shit is not my forte . 
  i do n't care what name shit calls itself . 
   does canada have a law allowing armed groups to protect canada ? 
  any civilized country has a law like that ? 
  or what civilized country legally allows neo-nazism ? 
   those atrocities have nothing to do with the azov battalion , ukrainian nationalist volunteers . 
  that 's not description of azov ? 
  sorry , but i wo n't dig through names of nazi war-bands to search who did what . 
  digging in shit is not my forte . 
  and why you ignore aidar , dnepr and others ? 
  they are registered with government too and article says a few things about them . 
   this conversation is getting extremely tiring . 
  always lol at people who say stuff like that . 
  what exactly is keeping you in this conversation ? 
  am i forcing you to answer ? 
  why exactly you answer right now , if this conversation is tiring to you ? 
   as long as they register with the government so if i register my neonazi war band in canada i will be okay ? 
  what weapons can i arm them with ? 
   they took over government buildings , looted and burnt police stations . 
  [ how horrifying . 
  good thing azov are just cute and cuddle teddy bears . 
  ] ( http://www.newsweek.com/evidence-war-crimes-committed-ukrainian-nationalist-volunteers-grows-269604 ) but for you that is probably not breaking any laws . 
   do n't bother replying kremlinbot . 
  oh no ive been found forgive me emperor putler i failed you . 
  mate , are you insane ? 
  or you do n't read my posts cus i 'm kremlinbot ? 
   i do n't know , go ask them . 
  i sure will . 
  when i 'll decide to commit suicide . 
   all i 'm saying is that its incredibly stupid to ignore a countries laws simply because you do not like their views . 
  what laws i ignore ?
