  or neonazi war bands are allowed by ukrainian laws ? 
   going by your same logic , simply because i do not like them its ok if they are arrested ... 
  if they form an armed millitary unit - yes . 
  and `` going by your same logic '' ukraine should have just ignored separatists in donbass . 
  just because they do n't agree with them there is no reason to stop them !, 
   that would be against the law , and therefore illegal . 
  and armed band of neonazis is legal . 
  okay then , no problem here . 
  hail ukraine !, 
   if you are calling for the arrest and imprisonment of people you simply disagree with ideologically . 
  and now you quote me saying anything like that . 
   the russian propaganda has really gotten to you i oh no its le putler !!!, 
  he controlls me plz help, 
  why ca n't they join the army then ? 
  you know , the legal organization that is fully under control of government . 
  okay , okay , not muslim * terrorists * . 
  just radical muslims . 
  armed radical muslims without any control who impose sharia law , punish infidels , that kind of stuff . 
  why should we stop them ? 
   since its been invaded by russia . 
  oh snap , russia invaded canada ? 
  wow . 
   should ukraine arrest them simply because you and i do not like their ideology ? 
  should a country arrest an armed band of muslim terrorists only because we do n't like their ideology ? 
  since when canada allows neonazis to form an armed military unit ? 
  a military unit that is free to do whatever it pleases . 
   treat another ethnicity like this . 
  like what ? 
  i ask because i am obviously a kremlinbot brainwashed by kremlin propaganda . 
  because not following orders in ussr and nazi germany was so easy . 
  hitler would be like `` lol , ok , do n't join army idc '', 
  of course they can . 
  because filthy westerner 's laws are islamophobic and racist . 
  yet again , ~ ~ women ~ ~ girl refuses to wear burka and pays for it . 
  ** when will they learn !? 
  ukraine failing to pay is not some new development . 
  it 's a decade long trend . 
  failure to pay now is actually would be understandable . 
   thanks to russias help in donetsk . 
  since 1992 ? 
  and your point is ? 
  if you fail to uphold your end of the deal - next deal will be less beneficial to you . 
  and that 's not enough ? 
  try to take a loan and not pay for it . 
  then try to take another one and compare interest rates they will offer you . 
  when russia failed to provide what was paid for ? 
  do tell . 
  i am not from gazprom . 
  no idea how they price it . 
  probably something like * volume x reliability x personal preference . 
  * or something . 
  germany was never late on their payment and never threw a hissy fit , like ukraine did time and time again . 
  germany ( and rest of eu ) countries are reliable costumers . 
  ukraine is an unpredictable customer , that 's why they pay more . 
  you do understand that selling gas to germany and selling it to ukraine is completely different ? 
  that 's not `` sexual harassment '' !, 
  that 's their culture !, 
  check your privilege !, 
  oh hey , semantics . 
  the last line of defense . 
  you either ~ ~ reta ~ ~ confused , or you choose to look like it . 
  firstly , i did not say that . 
  secondly , the point of that ( i think ) was to point out that if you call for death of netanyahu - you go to jail , but if you call for carpet bombing of isis ( which will result in thousand deaths ) - you get * criticism * mate , are you like lost ? 
  you do n't know who you are talking to and do n't know what about . 
  are you ok ? 
  you do know what freedom of speech is ? 
  `` you are free to say x , y , but not z '' - is not a freedom of speech . 
  also , criticism ? 
  wow , how harsh , i hope hes okay . 
  i know it is not either/or . 
  yes , helping people in syria is a great thing to do , but not just letting everyone in from that terrorist infested hellhole . 
  especially when their core values are radically different from modern european culture . 
  you know , like treating women as equals and not furniture . 
   jesus taught the golden rule you do know , that the guys from `` syria '' do n't really believe in jesus ? 
  they are more on the side of `` kill everyone who insults islam '' . 
  small difference , but still / s  there 's a democratic demand and that 's why there should be a democratic procedure for letting people in . 
  not retarded `` refugees welcome '' policy of letting ** everyone ** in . 
   so we need to engage with the islamic world to some extent . 
  umm , what ? 
  i did n't call for like isolation of muslims or whatever , how is that related ? 
  how it the hell wwii is related to anything ? 
  well , i kinda can see a connection - isis sends their agents as `` refugees '' and they will breed more `` moderate jihadists '' in countries that they are at war with . 
  am i right ? 
   you ca n't leave men to be shot by isis . 
  actually , you can . 
  why you think that safety of people from faraway land  safety of the people of your own country ? 
   nobody blinks an eye if you call for carpet bombing isis but if you call for the murder of netanyahu it is a crime . 
  selective quoting is so cool , bro . 
   did you know that poles do n't really enjoy squatting ?

  yes . 
  alien invasion in more plausible in next 10 years . 
  after that it is just as plausible . 
  i tried but i could n't stop !,
