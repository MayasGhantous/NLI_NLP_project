  if only ukrainian government could shell them with artillery , oh wait they got all of their artillery busy at donbass . 
  literally putler literally eating crimean babies . 
  when will he stop !, 
  crimea river . 
   when not discussing politics that 's like the first rule , if you want to be friends with someone . 
  you do not discuss politics or religion . 
  especially when drunk . 
   realize that there are other ways of eating mushrooms than raw . 
  [ in russia we drink mushrooms . 
  you are correct . 
  traffic laws are heavily in favor of pedestrians and it is really easy is to fake an accident . 
  / r/europe what happened to you ? 
  where is the anti-russia circlejerk i love you for ? 
  [ nvm , found some !,

   downvote brigade , your target is here ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ so edgy , i almost cut myself on all that edge . 
  you can try out for shadow the hedgehog side-kick . 
  ** so much edge **, 
  those damn meatballs why are they so cheap and delicious !, 
  i actually shopped for the first time in ikea last month . 
  i could barely move after how much i ate there , also bought stuff i did not even know i want or need . 
  curse you , sweeden !, 
  really disappointed in that police officer . 
  he clearly does not use his full power to beat that guy . 
   killing tons of russians then it would all be fine this is / r/europe of course it 's fine, 
  wording is hard . 
  it 's illegal for residents of russia . 
  if item just passes russia then it 's fine . 
  and you are correct . 
  it is illegal to send knives through mail/delivery service through russian border . 
  now i want this knife . 
  but i cant ' t get it ( knives are forbidden to import ) . 
  i hope you are happy . 
  dammit , my dream of starting communist party in poland is crushed !, 
  afaik pure communism is not a totalitarian state . 
  it 's more of a fairy-land . 
  but if it is soviet-style communism , then yeah , kinda can see why . 
   they ca n't promote hate on basis of race or nationality or conceal identity of their members or advocate using force to take power . 
  there is law like that in pretty much all countries . 
  communism is banned in poland ? 
  that 's kinda weird . 
  at first i was like :  extremally relevant comment !, 
  / s but then :  sarcasm is a nice way to evade conversation . 
  please do evade our conversation . 
  but the boogeyman electected ukrainian presidents for 20 years in a row . 
  or something like that . 
  it 's the new ukrainian boogeyman . 
  he is at fault for all of their problems . 
  it is , in fact , over 9000 . 
  makes sense . 
  and why are you such a stuck-up cunt then ? 
  we will know that in about 8 months . 
  no sunlight here from autumn till spring . 
  pfft . 
  ** wake up sheeple ** what a clown . 
  yeah . 
  not invading russia for 70 years . 
  step it up europe ffs . 
  sorry for this retard . 
  his other account / u/great _ stalin got negative karma , so he got this new one . 
  still a retard tho . 
   karelia is finland , no matter how you spin it but crimea is not russia . 
  the hypocrisy is just astounding . 
  yeah , all `` neo-liberals '' in russia constantly whine about * `` oh it 's time to leave the fckn rashka '' * but there is one problem - no one wants uneducated people with no skills . 
  but that is totally russia 's fault . 
  people with actual education and skills can leave country just fine . 
  in russian internet people like him are in meme status already . 
  well , our beer is really shit . 
  spirits are not bad , but at least you wo n't remember the taste in the morning . 
  putler , millitary exercise in the east part of russia , world is round , he literally plans to invade spain/portugal . 
  when will he stop ? 
  just give me a gold star or something , so you can distinguish between civilized and not . 
  edit : [ this guy is genuinely retarded or insane . 
  i feel dumber for talking to him .

  russian soldiers were always in crimea since fall of ussr . 
  that 's why ukraine paid less for gas , we had a deal . 
  anyone was free to monitor the referendum , but they decided not to . 
  and now they can claim that it was illegitimate . 
  that 's actually smart . 
  * oh it 's an illegitimate referendum , we will not send observers . 
  there were no observers - referendum is illegitimate . 
  * that 's catch-22 right there . 
  well i never saw any outright hatred for us here and that does make sense since us is kinda far away from europe . 
  i 'll answer you , since you actually ask a question without screaming about putler . 
  no , refugees are not free to move inside the country , since they are not citizens . 
  that 's pretty much same for every country . 
  ( well , they can move , but they will be arrested if police checks their id 's ) . 
  every country has some sort of procedure that registers them . 
  every russian city has an official `` capacity '' for refugees . 
  some people , who own some sort of business/private house , can house refugees and provide them with work and housing , [ like this ] ( http://www.the-village.ru/village/city/people/160103-bezhentsy-s-ukrainy ) 58 refugees in private moscow house , but officially there is no place for refugees in moscow . 
  government will even pay you and speed-up the process of refugee registration if you house 3 or more refugees . 
  i heard about some private farms hiring refugees for work + housing there . 
  the only possible problem may arise with people who want to be housed in moscow . 
  `` oh look at me , i 'm a refugee !, 
  give me apartment in moscow ! '' . 
  but the government only offers them magadan , since it is the only place that can fit them in . 
  and `` refugee '' , who fled from shelling , clearly is too proud to live there . 
  but hey , russia is clearly a bad guy for taking 500 000 + refugees from ukraine and not housing them in a luxury resorts .
