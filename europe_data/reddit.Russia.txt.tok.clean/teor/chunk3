   he invaded and annexed part of a neighboring country when did he do that ? 
  was it this morning ? 
  did n't read news yet . 
  yeah , hysteria from poland and baltic states is a thing . 
  but it 's not just them . 
  evil soviet occupation is evidence enough for some people . 
  well before the whole ukraine thing i never saw usa being in the title of every second post . 
  so that 's not the same . 
  i really ca n't say anything on ttip , i do n't really follow it since it will not have a strong impact on russia . 
  hell , just give me access to us amazon 's store ( or even eu one ) and i 'll support it . 
  on fox 's front page i can see news about isis , ebola , so there are at least ** some ** news not about how terrible obama is . 
  so you can see that there is an agenda on fox , but at least they try to be a news source . 
  like moscowtimes could at least mention , that 3 days ago moscow government started to build biggest oceanarium in russia ? 
  i think that thing is at least worth mentioning , but no , that will show russia actually doing something and is not about to implode , ca n't have that . 
  i did not mean you in particular , but comments in this thread suggest that moscowtimes is pretty credible source of information . 
  i 'm pretty much the only one here to call it bs . 
   the comments on here stated oh lol . 
  or are you serious ? 
  i never saw anything but putler putler soviet evil russia in comments here . 
  i never saw any questioning of bbc in this subreddit . 
  even when all the `` evidence '' they gave was some random dude on twitter . 
  maybe that 's because they say that russian is bad , but that 's just my hunch . 
  well does fox report only bad things ? 
  like literally only bad things . 
  since that 's what moscowtimes does . 
  as i said somewhere in this thread - shitty tabloid is all proof you need ? 
  and wait , i tought putler controlls all the media to feed us propaganda , why is there magadan paper publishing this sort of thing ? 
  should n't the authors be in gulag already ? 
  and `` opinion '' does not excuse blatant scaremongering and anti-russian bs . 
  blaming dutch with 0 evidence = bad . 
  blaming russia with 0 evidence = good . 
  sure , makes sense . 
  also you should probably check `` moscowtimes '' frontpage . 
  with news like that i got a better name for it `` doom and gloom '' or `` mordor times '' . 
  seriously , nothing good ever happens in russia ? 
  but hey , it is an anti-russian site , so it must be true . 
   the us was the victim in iraq um , no ? 
  we kinda can compare it georgia situation , but even then it 's not the same . 
  but even if we do , i do n't remember massive smear campaign against us . 
  just `` us show us the proof of wmd 's !, 
  nope . '', 
   rt constantly posts `` articles '' lacking any type of proof , not a single shred . 
  oh i get it , pro-russian with no proof = bad propaganda . 
  anti-russian with no proof = omg literally putler evil russians . 
  that 's not hypocritical at all . 
  i do n't read rt , but i do find it funny that what they post is instantly marked as propaganda , but shit like in op 's post is regarded as truth without any question . 
   pi\u0142sudski - yes . 
   was a polish statesman ; chief of state ( 1918 -- 22 ) , `` first marshal '' ( from 1920 ) , and leader ( 1926 -- 35 ) of the second polish republic . 
  so yeah , poland . 
  i do n't care what ussr was , what communism was . 
  we were talking about 90 's and fall of ussr , not about communism or anything else . 
  as for the rest , yes , ussr was destined to die , but not like this . 
  it died too fast , just like it was built . 
  if it was slower it would have been better for anyone involved . 
  well , it would not be a thing if not for shitty revolution and shitty bolsheviks . 
  so it would not be possible to slowly build it . 
  also , did you know that poland has a huge responsibility for existence of ussr ? 
  so , basicaly , any mention of ussr gets you in to the evil soviets stalin omg mood ? 
  because there is literally no connection betwen how hard russian citizens had it after ussr died and holodomor . 
  literally . 
  and what ussr and holodomor got to do with anything ? 
  you really can not make a conversation without bringing evil soviets ? 
  like , srsly , can you explain that ? 
  and ? 
  jeez , does everything a polish person says comes down to ussr occupation muh katyn ? 
  that 's just sad , mate . 
  oh , did i sent someone somewhere ? 
  well i can send you on a one way trip , but that 's not the point . 
  still wainting for some of that proof . 
  oh , k. moscow times = good . 
  russia today = bad . 
  because reasons . 
  or are you really saying that there is literally nothing good happens in russia ? 
   the reporter is talking to the families effected i just talked to your family and they said you do n't wash your teeth . 
  that 's disgusting . 
  stop it . 
   victim-shaming but who 's the victim if not russia ? 
  some shitty tabloid with sole purpose of publishing news on how terrible everything in russia is tells a bizzare story with 0 evidence to back it up and here you are with `` you are going to take a lot of shit for it '' . 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  of course it 's real . 
  russia is literally putler . 
  just check the front page of that site . 
  there is ** literally ** nothing good in russia and especially in moscow . 
  none . 
  i probably live in moscow , idaho and not moscow , russia . 
  or this site is from idaho and i live in russia . 
  am confused now . 
  only eu is made of sunshine and fluffy bunnies . 
  all other sorts of `` unions '' are made of sub-humans . 
  sorry , i 'm just kremlinbot :(, 
  mate , this is / r/europe you do not agree with russians in / r/europe, 
  ofc i did , that 's why i told you that . 
  just finish pilot and an electricity worker chillin ' with their army gear , silly germans call them fine gentlemen nazi for no reason . 
  i would n't even bother reading your list , sorry . 
  but i do know that it 's about situation in russia ( you informed about it by not living in russia ) and how terrible the russia is , right ? 
  i would n't call this a win tho . 
  clearly the guy with ss symbol just works with electricity !, 
  and the swastika guy is actually a finish pilot . 
  only putler can be of nazi . 
  i 'm surprised there is no rape `` joke '' .
