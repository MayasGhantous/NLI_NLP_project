  [ nope . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate_by_decade#1990s ), 
   was n't the only one having bad times in 1990s . 
  oh you poor baby . 
  i bet you were afraid to leave your house at any time of the day , because you might get killed for no reason ? 
  and having no food for 2-3 days in a row . 
  and all of that in capitall city . 
  what part of `` literally putler '' you do n't get ? 
  get on with the program !, 
  they will call you kremlinbot/shill if you do n't parrot that . 
  this is some high-school stuff . 
  `` upperclassmen '' tell ukraine to do something and they `` will totally back him up '' and then pretend they do n't even know him . 
  or ukrainian government does it 's usual shtick of saying retarded stuff and lies . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ forget ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ believe ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ when ^ ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ ^ something ^ ^ ^ ^ bad ^ ^ ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ ^ evil ^ ^ ^ ^ russkies . 
  i bet this `` billionaire and governor of the dnipropetrovsk region '' knows the right people for the job . 
  he just need 's few billions to start it . 
  i just love how ukraine does retarded stuff and then beggs eu/us/nato / ilumanadi for money . 
  fuck off , scum . 
  til france and ukraine are bff 's . 
  why no one told me that before ? 
   is the same as criticizing us intelligence for not connecting the dots and saying shit like `` oh that 's just us , that 's what they always want - kill innocent civilians '' but i never saw that here , i wonder why . 
  some more straw man . 
  some next level straw man you got there . 
  pathetic . 
  alleged russian vehicles . 
  you can at least read the title . 
  * reunification of republic of crimea and sevastopol with russia * 1 . 
  yeah , but you do n't hate them and do n't circlejerk about how bad the nation x is . 
   sending military on foreign territory [ citation needed ]  annexation of parts of it [ citation needed ]  used to prevent writing `` government '' yeah , typical / r/europe mantra of * `` oh we do n't hate the people , we hate government !, 
  why you ~ ~ sub-humans ~ ~ ~ ~ idiots ~ ~ ~ ~ communists ~ ~ have such bad government !? 
  '' * or something like that . 
  ikr ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ probably ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ poland, 
   invasion [ citation needed ] oh and i am really sorry for breaking circlejerk of putler invading omg . 
   putins actions and which putin actions you speak off ? 
  him taking a dump or something ? 
  why would you need my opinion on that ? 
  i have a more legit question . 
  even two of them . 
  how is your question related to anything i said ? 
  how do you know what i support ? 
  but i did . 
  bbc changed the title , or wait , probably putler did it someone stop him y u so mad ? 
  well , you need to be retarded , since that is probably how they find new ua government officials . 
  or they deliberately make statements that will support the literally putler notion . 
  / r/europe status = buttmad . 
  `` oh there were civilian casualities , that 's so russian . 
  russians are evil and like to kill babies i bet they did it on purpose . '', 
  nice suport indeed . 
  [ communism itself is not a `` totalitarian regime '' . 
  ] ( https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1385/96/1385962491972.jpg ) communism is a stupid idea and a pipe dream , but that 's other thing . 
  add some blue and yellow to painting and it instantly becomes about current events . 
  2deep4me . 
  i know what he meant . 
  but why should i feel sorry for that ? 
  guilt ? 
  for poland ? 
  why sholuld i feel guilty for that ? 
  itt people use tragedy to shit on russia . 
  leprosorium is a thing of it 's own . 
  it 's basically a giant circlejerk about how elite they are and how much better they are . 
  yea , i had pikabu on my mind as reddit clone , kinda forgot there is 9gag . 
  well yes , that 's why / r/worldnews is such a fucking cesspool . 
  russian `` clone '' of reddit is no better , but at least here we have a russian subreddit , * oh wait it 's pretty much overtaken by literally putler people . 
   you 're being downvoted russian flag + not screaming literally putler = downvotes . 
  that 's the truth . 
  the most active supporters of anything in this conflict are probably the least affected by it . 
  that 's what internet allows you to do . 
  with internet you are not nobody , you are a supporter and of course you support the good guys . 
   of every single ukrainian on earth actually , the most patriotic ukrainians migrated to canada/other country long time ago . 
  but they will support their homeland via internet !, 
  brave keyboard warriors never sleep !, 
  nothing really changed . 
  the only imported eu food i bought was camembert cheese , there is still some left in shops . 
  would suck to see it go , but oh well . 
  after analyzing my ration i found out that i mostly eat local food or food imported from asia . 
  good job !, 
  now that will show the putler who 's the boss here !, 
  pathetic . 
  i will not be surprised if ukraine is the top one in / r/russia, 
  russia  europe . 
  it 's official now . 
  no no no . 
  literally putler . 
  see the difference ? 
   full with idiots who want to act tough and want full scale war with russia . 
  armchair generals are indeed prevail on the internet . 
  they won all the wars against russkies . 
  article title :  u.s. official says 1,000 russian troops have entered ukraine post title :  official : russian forces back rebels in eastern ukraine smooth . 
  well , that 's a viable point too . 
  i do n't really see how poland is any kind of danger . 
  poland is now part of `` civilized humans '' , unlike dem russkies untermensch . 
   natural progression of the european peoples towards a greater western civilisation . 
   world free of the russian . 
  yeah , f them russkies subhumans . 
  reminds me of something , but cant point at what exactly . 
  can you take them ? 
  there is nothing good there and they smell bad & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  well most of the vehicles are russian . 
  so , technically they are not lying .
