  yes , we send them to gulag . 
  we need to finish our gulag quota . 
  [ \\  mrw / r/europe is buttmad again ] ( https://pp.vk.me/c616226/v616226713/19ade/dwmntxxu-xa.jpg ), 
  i see no humans oppressed in this video . 
  russians are not humans , so it 's a-ok to do that stuff to them . 
  some `` blogger '' testified about some roofers , who told him that they did it . 
  moral : do not brag about shit if you can go to jail for it . 
  and i 'm not . 
  it is like when eu told latin america countries to `` not take their spot '' and limit their export to russia . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ completely ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ retarded, 
  why then 9 out of 10 times the guy screaming about fascist soviet russian occupation is from a buttmad state ? 
   oh sorry , i am not friendly to people who constanly insult me and talk shit about me ? 
  that 's my horrible russian herritage acting up up , people of civilized eu will not do that lel kinda funny , how i never say anything bad about northern europe , maybe that 's because they do not insult my country every time they can . 
  oh and t hey do n't treat you badly when learn that you are russia , that 's why i will visit them them again on my next vacation . 
  so you imply that each and every russian in you country came there by their own will ? 
  back when ussr was a thing there was a lot of free choice . 
  sure . 
  cool , no college education for quarter of you populace . 
  makes sense . 
  i doubt they offer billions of euro for them to leave . 
  housing in russia is expensive and you ca n't live normaly without a job and since you ca n't get a college level of education in your country the only jobs you are left with are low-skill menial jobs . 
  no idea why they do n't just leave . 
  well is there a 25 % of estonians in russia ? 
  or even a singnificant number of them ? 
  i do n't really see any `` estonian minority '' in russia , did i miss something ? 
  well with that attitude they will not be a part of union . 
  union says `` jump ! '', 
  and you jump , then they will accept you . 
  and if you do n't - why accept you ? 
  must 've missread you . .  trying to insult my country i do n't even know which one is it lol  `` estonia not recognizing 25 % of its population as people '' well if you do not recognize language used by quarter of people in your county - you probably do not consider them as people of your country . 
   and notice how you are the only person here lel , sure . 
  / r/europe loves russia . 
  so much love < 3  non-russian speakers do not have similar access to any federal institutes . 
  unlike in whatever your country is ? 
  so i can go there and apply for your best education , without knowledge of language ? 
  first of all , most of people of certain ethnicity live in corresponding region . 
  that 's why their language there is official . 
  damn evil russkies forcing people to use their native language . 
  so yeah , 5 % can get their language recognized in russia , but 25 % can not in buttmad states . 
   97 % of the schools in russia u wot ? 
  why not 101 % ? 
  hell , why not say that there are no schools in russia ? 
   there is no russian in estonia who would not be granted education in russian and could not live their daily life using russian . 
  nice joke m8 . 
  why would i hate you ? 
  no , srsly , why would i ? 
  i have trouble distinguishing you guys , except for poland . 
  how can i hate you , if im not sure who you are ? 
   all you can do is try to make it sound as if language policies of estonia are more important issues to deal with u wot ? 
  oh , sorry , this thread was about ... i dunno , greece debt or whatever and here i am with russian language . 
  and just fyi . 
  there is an ebola virus in africa right now . 
  literally every single problem you migh have is irrelevant if you compare it to ebola . 
  i hope you ddid not complain once since the outbreak started ? 
  that will make you a hipocrite if you did . 
   anything more than hatred yeah , you people will always hate evil fascist russian soviets . 
  reminds me of good old poem `` elephant and pug '' . 
   your point was no , my point was that buttmad states are retarded . 
  or you can explain why quatrter of your populace is not recognised as people ? 
   youve embarassed yourself enough allready , bro . 
  to whom ? 
  to you ? 
  then make it a regional languange . 
  with region somewhat equal in territory to a regions in russia . 
  it is weird how barbaric communist soviet russian nazi can make a language regional for 5 % of it 's population , yet you useless country does not do anything about quarter of your population . 
  the thing is , a region in russia is bigger than your entire country . 
  [ you are clearly retarded . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_russia#official_languages ) or maybe you do n't know what an official language is ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_russia how much more retarded can you get , bro ? 
  no house , only gulag . 
  gulag is home now :(, 
   court was lenient , no lenient courts here . 
  only gulag . 
  took you long enough to bring up the u just listen to rt propaganda . 
  but i glad you did it , do n't want see actual intelligence in you people . 
  why would lithuanian deaths matter to me ? 
  or to anyone ? 
  it is not harder . 
  it is an entirely different thing . 
  even the amount of paperwork required is like 40 times more . 
  also , when you `` lived in norway '' , did you change your citizenship completely for that ? 
   russia is shit , buttmad states so cute < 3, 
   i merely explained you did n't . 
   there is no hate or discrimination towards russian funniest thing i read today . 
  of course not , nazis are the heroes , and soviets are fascist . 
  lel  100 000 sent to gulags and of course 100 % of them survived right ? 
  add two zeroes to that number and you get russian civilian casualties in wwii . 
  but we do n't whine about it everywhere ~ ~ evil german fascist pigs ~ ~ . 
  that 's how real country behaves itself . 
   why wo n't they be able to do the same thing in russia ? 
  you really comparing work ( or study ) travel to a complete emigration of an entire family ? 
   because it 's shit buttmad states < 3, 
  nope . 
  why should i stop ? 
   and have the guts to call us fascists . 
  can you quote where i did that ? 
  oh wait , it usual fascist russians muh occupation, 
  so it comes down to [ `` they 're not like you and me , which means they must be evil '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oycn3w_s2ua ) lel such tolerance . 
  much european values .
