  til, 
   piontkovsky says who ? 
   piontkovsky does not provide direct evidence for this oh okay then . 
  stay classy , / r/europe i also really like / u/pladmir _ vutin he posts only bad things about russia and nothing else . 
  now that 's dedication to your work !, 
   because of our gay rights i bet somewhere in the world there is someone who believes it . 
  and that is sad . 
  oh khokhols , never change < 3 goebbels would be proud of you . 
  it 's amazing how fucking inept russian goverment at making it 's point . 
  free wi-fi is not banned nor does it ruquire and id . 
  the law is about free wi-fi at post office and other goverment sponsored places . 
  the one that barrely works and not every post office has . 
  someone really needs to finish a law school before they start to sign laws and stuff . 
  so start genocide first , think later . 
  but not for serbia , because it was not genocide of russians . 
   did you see what putin did to grozny ? 
  oh the 17th biggest mosque in the world you mean ? 
  it is quite beautiful thing indeed . 
  or grozny-city towers ? 
  that 's nice too . 
  well that 's what politics are about . 
  do n't want to be my friend - why should i bother with you ? 
  moldova does not do what we tell them to - let 's find someone else to trade with . 
  all countries do that , no to this level , but still . 
   i just find it disgusting that putin brutalized them versus giving them freedom after ussr broke . 
  um , i hate to break it to you . 
  but putin is not our god emperor . 
  we kinda had a different president , [ yeltsin the alcoholic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boris_yeltsin ) was his name . 
  the guy pretty much destroyed what 's left of russia . 
  he is the reason that putin actually looks not terrible even now . 
  ^ ^ you ^ ^ should ^ ^ probably ^ ^ read ^ ^ about ^ ^ russia 's ^ ^ history ^ ^ if ^ ^ you ^ ^ want ^ ^ to ^ ^ point ^ ^ out ^ ^ bad ^ ^ stuff ^ ^ that ^ ^ russia ^ ^ did and the first chehen war start with chechens killing all non-chechen goverment officials and general violence to non chechen civillans . 
  so yeah , start genocide first , think later . 
  that war was a fucking disgrace , but still , russia was not an agressor there . 
   your cognitive dissonance is quite interesting . 
  yours is a lot more , or cognitive dissonance is only for russians ? 
  why can you answer how 1941 is totaly relevant , but 1918 is not ? 
  or how russian history is totaly ussr , but eu history does not involve countries in it . 
   why is putin so fascinated with it ? 
  got a source on that ? 
   what exactly had europe done to russia  as proof of how evil we europeans are yeah , why i do that . 
  it 's not like that was your question . 
  no , that must be putler influence on me . 
   russia has invaded ukraine oh shit !, 
  already ?!, 
  do i need to check in in at my local voenkomat ? 
  ** why i get news like this from some random dude on the internet !? 
  ** brb , need to clean up my ak . 
  serbians start genocide = bad . 
  chechens start genocide = good , because they kill russkies . 
  makes sense . 
  well , middle east is pretty much one giant shithole . 
  nothing good happens there . 
  but my point still stands . 
  for some reason people who fight goverment in siria are freedom fighters , but in ukraine they are terrorists . 
  by moldova you mean [ transnistria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistrian_independence_referendum,_2006 ) ? 
  and i bet they were terrorists , right ? 
  no freedom fighters there . 
  and european nnion got nothing to do with historry of individual countries in it ? 
  are you borg ? 
  that 's scarry . 
   but 1918 ? 
  really ? 
  that 's too long ago !, 
  ** you damn evil russkies muh katyn ** . 
  yep , everything is fine < 3 . 
  or is there like some sort of law in eu - * stuff that was x years ago dun real * ? 
  what for ? 
  ukraine is useless . 
  and it 's your pain in the ass now , you baby sit them . 
   initial peace keeping that split up georgia kinda like kosovo , eh ? 
   moldova and ukraine moldova ? 
   or chechnya ? 
  right , total genocide of russian population is a-ok !, 
  it 's only russkies anyway , it 's okay when they die , right ? 
  syria example is kinda awesome lol freedom fighters fight for freedom in syria and evil russia 's sponsored terrorists are in ukraine . 
  no double standarts here . 
  usa gives money to palestine ? 
  like 10 $ and a cheeseburger ? 
   fuck both of them . 
  well , at least we can agree on something . 
   if those nazis are so evil then how come they are such a huge trading partner for russia nazis ? 
  and hey , nice thing you do n't supply weapons to israel < 3 since you know , genocide and stuff . 
  oh ...  invasion  georgia you one of those retarded people ? 
   predates the eu u wot ? 
  europe was a not thing before the union ? 
  or wait , you mention ussr , but ussr is not a thing anymore . 
  so eu ! = europe , but russia = = ussr . 
  oh you people and your double standarts < 3 [ yeah , poor poor poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93ukrainian_war ) , literally saints , not trying to stomp county in the middle of a fucking civill war and defeat in wwi . 
   what exactly had europe done to russia before russia started invading countries on our border ? 
  that 's just amazing . 
  yeah , eu was always a good friend to russia . 
  never invading it . 
  nope . 
  never . 
  damn evil russkies , starting them world wars and even invading peaceful france and sweden back in the day . 
  and let us not forget about poor poland , they always wanted to be friends , but evil russkies for some reason did not . 
  oh no , please continue . 
  this is what civilized friends do , right ? 
  i do n't know , since i 'm a retarded alcoholic communist , such is life in russia . 
  valio cheese was nice . _ .
