  no hard feelings , `` the future will decide '' , sure . 
   modern politics does n't work this way . 
  you can say the same thing about catalonia , belgium , chechnya , dagestan , even russian far east . 
  and actually , i would n't be so sure about the outcome about such referendum anyway ( if we are talking whole crimea , not only sevastopol ) . 
  [ sometimes it does ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_independence_referendum,_2014 ) work that way . 
   no we are not , you should visit there and see for youself . 
  i was there like 6-7 years ago , my granny was living there . 
  and there were a lot of talks about closing russian schools , how 's it now ? 
  i 'm not an expert , i do n't know . 
  you can interpret it as you wish i guess but it does n't strike me as a political solution . 
  how exactly russia tells ukraine not to join the eu ? 
  that guy words are if ukraine signs trade agreement with eu , it 'll lead to big increase in custom 's supervision with ukraine . 
  the reason for that if i understand him correctly are financial , whether it 's true or not i do n't know . 
  no , not every , it 's mostly the us . 
  and uk i guess too , how 's your celtic culture doing ? 
  and ukraine is fine , as you can see . 
  my point was n't about who 's the biggest partner and who 's on the second place , as if the first place gives some extra privileges . 
  my point was about failing at basic things like pr , even if you 're doing exactly what everyone else is doing . 
  no disagreement here . 
  sure , sure , so i guess you would n't mind giving crimea back to russia , right ? 
  just as a step to retain your cultural identity , because 58 % of people there are russians , they 're surely hindering your plans to be more * ukrainian * . 
  oh , and you can even ask crimeans would they like to join russia on a referendum , as a democratic country you sure would n't mind referendums , are n't you ? 
  btw , you are n't doing those god-awful politics of * ukrainization * there , are n't you ? 
  [ do n't you know it 's bad , mmmmkay ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1knlah/kremlin_we_want_to_discourage_the_integration_of/cbqs5jv ) or is it bad only when ussr is doing it ? 
  europeans mindset is so confusing to me !, 
  [ ukraine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_ukraine ) : main export partners * ** russia 23.7 % ** * turkey 6.0 % * china 4.1 % ( 2012 est. 
  ) [ 4 ] main import partners * ** russia 19.4 % ** * china 10.2 % * germany 9.6 % * belarus 7.8 % * poland 7.1 % ( 2012 est. 
  ) [ 6 ] so as a main trade partner russia has any possible right in the world to follow it 's own interest and protect their trade routes . 
  the more important question here is - why exactly our officials still ca n't do what every other sane country is doing in this situation - shut the fuck up or at least adopt some nice , non-provocative rhetoric ? 
  as any other country would do , but apparently when ussr implements [ `` melting pot '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melting_pot#soviet_union ) policies - it 's bad , mmmkay . 
  because everyone sure loves and supports nationalism if it 's not in your own country . 
  yes , yes , good guy petlura , hahaha . 
  yea , by giving the whole [ crimea to ukraine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_peninsula#in_the_soviet_union ) and giving them back [ galicia and volynia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine#world_war_ii ) which were under poland . 
  great memory you have , although a bit selectional . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_holocaust_in_lithuania  prior to the german invasion , the population of jews was estimated to be about 210,000 , [ 2 ] although according to data from the lithuanian statistics department , as of 1 january 1941 there were 208,000 jews . 
  [ 3 ] this estimate , based on the officially accounted for prewar emigration within the ussr ( approx . 
  8,500 ) , the number of escapees from kaunas and vilnius ghettos , ( 1,500-2 ,000 ) , as well as the number of the survivors in the concentration camps when they were liberated by the red army , ( 2,000-3 ,000 ) , puts the number of lithuanian jews murdered in the holocaust at 195,000 to 196,000 . 
  [ 3 ] it is difficult to estimate the exact number of casualties of the holocaust and the latter number can not be final or indisputable . 
  the numbers given by historians differ significantly ranging from 165,000 to 254,000 , the higher number probably including non-lithuanian jews among other riech ( empirical ) dissenters labeled as jewish killed in lithuania . 
  [ 3 ]  two factors contributed to the rapid destruction of lithuanian jewry . 
  the first was the significant support for the `` de-jewification '' of lithuania coming from the lithuanian populace . 
  [ 8 ] [ 12 ] the second was the german plan for early colonization of lithuania -- which shared a border with german east prussia -- in accordance with their generalplan ost ; hence the high priority given to the extermination of the relatively small lithuanian jewish community . 
  [ 12 ]  the involvement of the local population and institutions , in relatively high numbers , in the destruction of lithuanian jewry became a defining factor of the holocaust in lithuania . 
  as a russian i would like to answer your questions , but to be honest i 'm a bit puzzled of what exactly are you asking . 
  russia + ukraine + belarus all are mostly orthodox countries , so some religious institutions sure can talk about one `` russian world '' , but it is just a social/cultural concept , not some new plan to merge those countries together . 
  it 's like there is a `` muslim world '' , which is n't one country obviously . 
  and just like saudi arabia for muslims , or vatican for catholics , those religious institutions want to have some consolidated power over orthodoxy as well . 
  of course , when ussr did something `` good '' in the eye of yuropean - someone will rightfully correct that it 's not only russians but all those different nationalities . 
  when it 's discussion about ussr horrible atrocities then it 's just simply russians and no kind correctors in sight . 
  makes sense , / r/europe for you , kids . 
  that uncomfortable moment when `` rip to all germans '' has more upvotes than `` rip to all russians '' ... / r/europe for you , kids . 
  irony is wasted on some people , truly . 
  words are cheap , just look at all those excited yuropeans who 're already half ready to support him because in their minds he 's going against the almighty putin . 
  hehehehe ... 
  totally not brainwashed yuropean opened my eyes just now !, 
  we need help !, 
  will you send ze germans to liberate us again !? 
  definetely , unlike more advanced and intelligent yuropeans , we can be brainwashed to believe anything - we 're untermenschen after all !, 
  i agree !, 
  and we have plenty of land in siberia for those who does n't !, 
  yea , russians - breaking yuropean circlejerks since what ... 15th century !, 
   no conspiracy about it my sweet one . 
  oh , that old condescending tone of enlightened yurop !, 
   the only reason russia is trying to create buffer zones ( belarus , ukraine ) between the eu and russia , is not out of fear of possible invasion , because noone in their right mind would attack a nuclear power . 
  that 's a bit naive way of thinking . 
  it 's not easy to use nuclear weapons , every person involved need to be a bit suicidal , which always makes sudden nuclear strikes possible - the person who 's job is to press a button and launch a missile need to say goodbye to his life . 
  not to mention different changes of circumstances , i.e. 
  political turnoil , revolutions etc. 
  `` nuclear power '' is not only a blessing but obliges you to be paranoid because now you know that if there would be any possibility for a rival nuclear power to have a chance to end your life with minimal risk of retaliatory strike - it will use that chance . 
   its because the kremlin fears that if russians saw that all that anti-western mumbo jumbo about how we 're all nazi-gays in `` geyrope '' is bullshit and not true , they might just like what they 're seeing . 
  it seems you 're still living in 91 , when the iron curtain was just lifted . 
  russians in 2015 do n't have any problems finding any information they want about western countries , we have internet , satellite tvs and translated versions of many western channels . 
  not to mention that simple fact that pretty much everyone were abroad couple of times at least . 
  and there already was a massive adorations of the west by russians in 90s - it ended for different reasons , partially because after some nonsensical adoration there 's always an element of disillusionment and the pendand of public opinions swings in the other direction ( to some nonsensical despise , for example ) . 
  government rides that wave and uses it for it 's purposes , but it 's not that wave is artificially created , that would be quite a conspiracy indeed . 
   europe is much like russia , and eu and russian citizens are very , very alike . 
  does anyone disputes that ? 
   what if russians end up wanting that ? 
  want to be part of the eu . 
  yea , you just got out of coma yesterday , it seems . 
  the thing is - you misunderstand what 's happening in russia on the fundamental level . 
  it 's somewhat true that government went a bit crazy recently with their `` let 's be conservative beacon of the world '' idea , but the reasons for that are the mentality of russians which is conservative , not the government . 
  they 're just using that idea to have a popular support , and you think it 's the other way round . 
  in effect the government was disillusioned about western intentions in early 00s , they thought ( reasonably ) that west is n't interested in seeing russia as a first-world country , at least not in the current borders/military capabilities , saw aggressive intentions to encircle russia with military bases , saw clear attempts to destabilize neighbouring countries and make them anti-russian spearheads ( georgia ) and gradually decided that the only real chance to remain an independent country ( in any sense , political , ideological ) is through a direct confrontation , which west still fears . 
  they utilized historical differences in mentality of russian and western societies - the fact that russian society is very much a conservative one , to have a popular support against the western technology of fabricating a revolution in any country with a populist `` for freeduuum ! '', 
  and that 's where it currently is . 
  so your original point which blames all differences in mentality on some government propaganda is a bit shallow - there are differences , they 're known and they 're quite ancient , the fact that government uses them to have support is n't some novel idea which only happens in russia - it 's pretty much everywhere , you 're very proud being yuropeans as well , for example . 
  not sure what do you expect your government to say - oh look , let 's be like americans , we 're not that different after all !? 
  why the hell would you do that ? 
  far east ( and siberia ) is as european as the european parts , mostly . 
  southern parts ( caucasus mountains , altai etc ) are very far from european though . 
  yea , you uncovered a malicious intent in the [ historical name ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavophilia ) of one of the russian movements , great job . 
  it 's funny that we 're all laughing at that phrase of yours , but i suspect our interpretation of it is very different , 
   russia is very european and most of russians are europeans , even though the kremlin is telling them that they are n't . 
  wow , that 's some cool conspiracy . 
  that division `` westernophiles vs russophiles '' in russian society is literally a millenia old , kremlin has nothing to do with it . 
  in different epochs different groups were winning , with different interests , opinions and understandings , but the discussion itself is one of the cornerstones of the russian identity , every big russian writer had something to say about it in some way . 
  you 're right but your examples are not really that suitable . 
  if by `` siberian native '' you mean indigenous peoples then there 's very little of them left , at least the ones who 're saying that they 're not russians .
