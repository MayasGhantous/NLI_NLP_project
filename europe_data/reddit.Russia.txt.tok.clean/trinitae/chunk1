russia invading sweden ? 
  [ it reminds me of this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cypsqsh8i4m ), 
  [ kazan  ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=kazan&amp;biw=1175&amp;bih=720&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoamovchmipuq9hotyxwivhjkach1rrwvf ), 
   because it is a suspected russian submarine ? 
  according to an irish fishing associate , not really the most credible source imo . 
   of course , that 's the media got you . 
  they report on information ** in their own way ** , it 's nothing new . 
  by that logic , russian media does things ` its own way ' . 
  when russia does it , it 's propaganda . 
  then why is there an emphasis on '' suspected russian submarine '' in the title with no indication as to who said it or in what context it was taken ? 
  in that case , the title should be : head of irish fishing association suspects '' russian submarine '' to have damaged trawler . 
   media did n't suspect anyone come on now , you should be able to see , from the title alone , how media tries to influence readers on this particular subject . 
  if some irish fishing associate believes that it 's russia , media gains a lot from only this information and can create any wording it likes yet remains completely immune to any consequences . 
  suspect an athlete that he 's on doping - reputation stained and a negative opinion of him/her quickly develops . 
  media works the same way . 
  ` suspect ' is a word used to point fingers at someone , without facing any consequences shall that ` suspect ' be wrongly accused , like in this case . 
  but is no us , swe\u042f it !, 
  what is your point , then ? 
  well , it 's not like they would put a military base with thousands of soldiers at the northern tip of the country or even the far east , would they ? 
  it would be strategic retardation . 
   the ministry intends to build nine barracks for 3,500 soldiers , warehouses for rockets , artillery weapons , and other munitions with a total area of over 6,000 sq m. and only then there is a mention of making a part of it a training complex . 
   the documents also stated there would be a large training complex , and an infirmary for 50 beds , which can be expanded in case of `` a massive influx of wounded `` . 
  ** edit : ** downvoted for what ? 
  there 's no emphasis on this being a training site like the guy claims , it 's a military base as the russian government suggests and points out . 
  russian flair = automatic down votes ? 
  basically fiba decided to suspend the russian basketball federation back in july for '' not being able to resolve longstanding institutional and legal issues preventing the federation to work under proper conditions and maintain full control and governance in the country , as proven by the recently published court decision against the rbf . '', 
  as a consequence , the rfb forfeited its rights as member of fiba , and its teams and officials could not participate in official competitions or activities . 
  it 's been resolved now in one way or another , allowing the men 's team to compete in the eurobasket , i really have no clue what happened to the rest of the teams or if they are able to compete ( i think they are fine as of now , still not 100 % ) but also russia recently got a new president of the federation which is andrey kirilenko , probably the best known russian player ( he played in the nba and the national team ) hopefully he 'll clean things up . 
  russia is lucky to even play , considering there 's a huge mess going on upstairs ( russian basketball federation ) all of our teams were literally banned from competing but we were lucky enough to fix it last second . 
  the mess is really portrayed nicely by our poor performance so far , see you at the next euros , such a team is not worth cheering for : ' /, 
   i only made it to moscow once when i was very young ( ~ 12 ) . 
  i felt like it was a lot more russian but i was with my parents and we were basically tourists . 
  i had a lot of fun there . 
  moscow has changed a lot , for the better . 
  they are building a lot of new things and there 's always things to do . 
  for some reason it feels like there 's always a celebration going on ( just this weekend was moscow day or federal city day and they went big in every aspect of the celebration ) . 
  if you visit again , you wo n't see the same city you saw back then . 
  everything is big and in your face and it 's simply breath-taking . 
  piter is , as you said , a window to the west yet has it 's own unique charm and beauty + it 's a lot less expensive than living in the big city . 
  there 's always a jealousy that muscovites feel when talking about piter , it undoubtedly comes from the beautiful architecture and stunning women . 
  but hey , moscow all the way !, 
  being a muscovite with tatar roots , i would have to disagree . 
  assuming you are from piter ? 
   has been literally fascist in the past could you care to give any examples ? 
  i know very little about the party except for their anti-immigration stance . 
  it reminds me of dubai a lot , they are constantly building new things and people regard it as the ` sports capital in russia ' . 
  they very recently hosted the world aquatics championships !, 
  the multi-ethnic city is honored by unesco and famous for muslims and christians living side-by-side in harmony and peace . 
  ( if you look at the division of religion in the region , this is great news ), 
  but the ~ ~ tatar ~ ~ volga bulgar legacy lives on 'til this day !, 
  as evidenced by my own roots !, 
   after the mongol invasion of europe from 1241 , volga bulgaria was defeated , ruined , and incorporated into the golden horde . 
  [ stupid mongolians  :( ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afnjbdt4t5g ) it 's all of mongol problem !, 
   the tax and currency benefit this year means rosneft and lukoil will yield free cash flow at more than twice the rate of shell and bp , according to barclays plc data . 
  ** russian producers are generating cash as if the price of oil were still $ 100 a barrel rather than $ 50 , goldman sachs group inc. said in a research note sept. 
  ** not bad . 
  no problem . 
  tatarstan is in the volga federal district while volgograd is in the southern federal district . 
  [ map ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_districts_of_russia#/media/file:map_of_russian_districts,_2014-03-21.svg ), 
  the city of volgograd in volgograd oblast in 2013 , yes , which is quite far from tatarstan ( approx . 
  it 's located in the early south of the country . 
  russia just stepped in , officially . 
  although we 've had a base in syria for quite some time , there is no way that we should bare any responsibility for what has happened there . 
  i do n't think it 's russia 's objective to escalate the situation more than it already is . 
  since when are muslim extremists far-right ? 
  dafuq  a sizeable portion name one republic where it happens outside the caucasus ? 
  we count ingushetia , dagestan and chechnya as one and the same . 
  i do n't know about chechnya , but if you want to see real peace and harmony , visit tatarstan . 
  but you would know if russian media is pure propaganda , right ? 
  because so many westerners have seen how it is for themselves ? 
  just yesterday i watched televised live debate about the situation in ukraine called '' ukrainian spring '' . 
  there were 4 ukrainians that were openly critiquing the government and providing points that many here on / europe seem to put forth and then another panel of ( mostly ) 4 russian speakers that were in favour of the governments actions . 
  what western people fail to understand is that russians are not zombies and can think for themselves , they have access to western media , as well . 
  it 's easy for westerners to point fingers at russia when they do n't know jack shit about what is actually shown on television here . 
  but you do n't understand , not many russians watch rt. 
  rt is designed for * international audiences * . 
  you mean joining the eu over siding with russia ? 
   there are also those who are in support of russia , but from my experience , they are a smaller minority . 
  small minority ? 
  when i was in belgrade , everyone only had good things to say about russia . 
   religion is a rare argument , few people are scared of that , people though are scared of raised terrorism possibilities and their integration ( again citing the russian relocation in ussr ) . 
  what terrorist activities ? 
  are you referring to the 98 riga bombings ? 
  in what way ? 
  i ca n't say anything about the people as i 've never asked a chechen about what he or she thinks about the recent attacks on western countries but certainly from an official government position , kadyrov has called the attacks '' a monstrous blow to our european civilization '' and called for muslim leaders to '' unite in the fight against isis '' . 
  certainly , you can say that places like chechnya and dagestan are the most radicalized in the whole of russia but in places like tatarstan and bashkortostan , the regions have received unesco awards for being places where inter-faith peace is the most apparent . 
  i do n't like seeing these places being placed in the same boat as some parts in the south where wahhabist tendencies are being fuelled by other countries such as , you guessed it , saudi arabia . 
   in russia we have our own muslim regions and i can clearly see their silent approval of all the attacks on the western countries . 
  how can you * see * this if i may ask , do you live there ? 
  i know plenty of tatars that were 100 % against this . 
  that 's a shame . 
  but what about the sweden democrats ? 
  i 've heard from my swedish friends that it 's considered racist to vote for them , is that true ? 
  and what about ibrahim baylan , your minister of energy ? 
  ardalan shekarabi , minister for public transporation ? 
  alice bah kunke , minister of culture and democracy ? 
  sooner or later , most of your government positions will be filled with people with non-swedish backgrounds . 
  i do n't think this guy is an exception . 
  those are some pretty sketchy sources . 
  the wikipedia link is just of a tv channel .
