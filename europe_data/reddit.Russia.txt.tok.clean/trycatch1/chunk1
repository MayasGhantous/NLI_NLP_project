damage control . 
  the very same zefs initially cited the coming and snowden out as the reason in their fucking official press-release . 
  edit : i [ read a bit about the owner of zefs ] ( http://echo.msk.ru/blog/avmalgin/832766-echo/ ) - maxim dolgopolov . 
  cool biography . 
  he spent 10 months in prison for armed robbery ( he stole not just money , but also wwii military decorations with intention to sell ) , then police looked for him for smuggling and unregistered weapons , then controlled several encashment companies , then criminal case for laundering of 2 billion rub , at this point he decided to move to politics , to the united russia . 
  i absolutely would not be surprised if that guy really thought it would be a good idea to send a press-release like that . 
  that 's stupid , but its installation there also was stupid . 
  jobs memorial had no business to be there . 
  spbitmo and st. petersburg are not related to jobs in any way or form . 
  if somebody needs memorials to consumerist icons , it 's not appropriate to place them on the territory of technical universities . 
  partially , yes . 
  but mostly it 's a real change in state of mind and the balance of power everywhere . 
  for example , take sloviansk , `` rebel stronghold '' just a few months ago . 
  on 2012 elections pro-russian party of regions and commies had overwhelming lead -- pr 65 % , cpu 17 % vs udar 5 % , batkyv 5 % , svoboda 2 % . 
  overall 82 % ru vs 12 % ua . 
  this time in sloviansk according to exit polls : opposition bloc 28 % , cpu 13 % , tyhipko 5 % vs bpp 19 % , pf 8 % , radicals 7 % , samopomich 5 % , batkyv 2 % , svoboda 2 % . 
  overall 46 % ru vs 43 % ua . 
  they still lead , but it 's almost 50/50 , nothing like the huge lead of 2012 . 
  so even in pro-ru strongholds results are like all-ukrainian average before . 
  [ see opinion polls ] ( https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9f%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%bb%d0%b0%d0%bc%d0%b5%d0%bd%d1%82%d1%81%d1%8c%d0%ba%d1%96_%d0%b2%d0%b8%d0%b1%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b8_%d0%b2_%d0%a3%d0%ba%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%97%d0%bd%d1%96_2014#.d0.a1.d0.be.d1.86.d1.96.d0.be.d0.bb.d0.be.d0.b3.d1.96.d1.8f ) . 
  low results for poroshenko , high for people 's front , samopomich , and ob . 
  if true , it would be impressive that poroshenko started with 40 % in september , and lost half of his voters in just 1 month . 
  first exit poll results from pavel sheremet ( belarusian journalist ) . 
  poroshenko - 22.2 , people 's front ( yatsenyuk , tyrchinov , avakov ) - 18.6 , samopomich ( lviv mayor , moderate liberals ) - 10.1 , opposition bloc ( ex-party of regions ) - 9.9 , radicals - 8.8 ( liashko , populist clown ) , batkyuvshina - 6.1 ( timoshenko ) , svoboda - 5.9 . 
  communists and gritsenko are out . 
  if true , these results would be quite unexpected . 
  edit : fixes, 
  http://imgur.com/a/jaiy3 the eu is already good . 
  it 's useless to discuss claims of spiegel/german intel . 
  without any details . 
  that 's very unlikely that relevant photo-evidence was faked . 
  the first one ( from russia , 100km from ukraine ) is a frame from a video published in instagram in june . 
  the second one ( from ukraine ) was published by paris match , a french magazine , few days after the crash . 
  they were linked together significantly later by other people . 
  it 's impossible to comment further not knowing about what exactly photos the german intelligence is talking about . 
  maybe they are talking about irrelevant buk 312 photo published by the sbu -- it was n't manipulated however , just taken out of context . 
   there 's also pretty strong evidence ( the sbu wiretaps , and a reuters interview with a donetsk warlord ) 3 ) also photographs [ of the same buk ] ( https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2014/09/24/video-comparison-confirms-the-buk-linked-to-the-downing-of-mh17-came-from-russia/ ) on russian territory on june 24 and in donetsk on july 17 . 
  4 ) also russian accent of buk crew noted by locals as ap reported . 
  it was broken . 
  it was confirmed by both sides . 
  also , the buk seen in donbass was previously photographed in russia , [ see this ] ( https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2014/09/24/video-comparison-confirms-the-buk-linked-to-the-downing-of-mh17-came-from-russia/ ) ( and [ the previous article ] ( https://bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2014/09/22/more-evidence-of-russia-supplying-the-buk-linked-to-the-downing-of-mh17/ ) ) . 
  so if the german intelligence really thinks that it was captured buk , it only shows their incompetence or their bias . 
  interesting thing , that there are plenty of osce observers , various non-osce observers , journalists , etc. 
  and it seems that nobody out of them have equipment to detect position of artillery fire -- you know , stuff that was developed and worked well since wwi . 
  what the point in all these observers if they ca n't really observe and attribute even ceasefire violation as serious as mrls `` uragan '' shelling ? 
  they turn situation where you can precisely and objectively pinpoint violating party into `` he said she said '' situation . 
  i wonder if that will change [ with first uavs delivered to osce mission ] ( http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/226824.html ) , but i do n't have much expectations from that . 
  evgeny feldman estimates 30.000 , i think he is the closest to the reality . 
  100-200k are a clear overestimation , 5k -- underestimation . 
  some chants and signs noted in [ / r/ukraina ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukraina/comments/2h10u1/%d0%bc%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%88_%d0%bc%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%b0/ckocd25 ) : ** pro-russian ** berkut !, 
  fascism will not pass nemtsov is a traitor of the mother country russia -- donbass , poroshenko -- a fag poroshenko is a cannibal liberals are a disgrace for russia ----- ** pro-ukrainian ** no to war putin is a thief no to fascism in kremlin peace to ukraine !, 
  freedom to russia !, 
  ukraine -- we are with you !, 
  russians are against the war with ukraine ukraine is not yours , that 's why you are angry moscow without sobyanin , russia without putin gang , get out !, 
  ( ukrainian chant used during the euromaidan and before ) glory to russia !, 
  russia without putin down with police state !, 
  junta is not in kyiv , it 's in kremlin glory to the kievan rus ' , novorossiya -- suck off putin -- khuilo , lalalalala, 
  he is a alive , also antikor.com.ua is an extremely shitty source , i do n't recommend to use it for anything . 
  do n't know about total fertility rate ( i was n't able to extract these stats from incredibly buggy and slow cbsd site ) , but we have positive natural population growth in saint-petersburg since this year ( in the previous years we had natural population decline ) . 
  saint-petersburg does n't have that many people from the group you mentioned to significantly distort these stats . 
  yes , you are right . 
  photos of the same moment from different angles . 
  edit : i 'm wrong again , it ca n't be the same moment . 
  on the second picture merkel laughs with putin alone : http://imgur.com/2gi4goe note the timing -- july 13 , the day after zelenopolye -- important escalation by russia , when ukraine for the first time was seriously shelled from russian territory with grads , killing 20 + soldiers and border guards . 
  next day ukrainian an-26 will be shot down from 6500m . 
  4 days before mh-17 . 
  you are right , that photo was from april 2013 : http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2013/04/8/6987648/ , during femen action `` fuck you , putin '' . 
  however , putin enjoyed [ the same exactly ] ( http://imgur.com/r4iysuk ) [ very warm ] ( http://imgur.com/2gi4goe ) reception from merkel at the world cup , so the / u/worldleader point stands . 
  there are 2 ( two ) more or less real opposition mps in 6th duma -- ponomarev and dmitry gudkov . 
  out of 450 . 
  seems like they think that it 's 2 too many . 
  `` the russian times '' -- i have no idea what is it , seems to be some very marginal outlet . 
  the article itself is a slightly modified and updated article from pravda from 2013 : http://www.pravda.ru/world/europe/european/21-03-2013/1149287-finn-0/, 
  it was not mentioned in the article , but petr dudnik , the protestant pastor who had his church seized by russians , is an amazing person . 
  during the occupation he organized delivery of humanitarian aid to sloviansk ( it was very important , because all the shops were closed in the end ) and evacuation of residents from sloviansk ( again , it was not easy to safely get out the town during the final stages ) , his church evacuated 3000 persons . 
  practically his church was the only party that was doing this work , neither the government , nor the separatists , nor the `` official '' orthodox churches did much about it . 
  when the town was liberated his church provided free dinners for locals , then organized reconstruction works in sloviansk , humanitarian aid and evacuations from other cities . 
   his idea is to strengthen mariupol for a start - it seems like this is happening right now . 
  i would like to believe that , but i do n't know . 
  read this : https://www.facebook.com/brtcomua/posts/746386698755320, 
  sure , foreign aid is just a strength multiplier , buff , not a silver bullet . 
  also , ukraine has its own big military industry that is able to produce a lot of stuff from sniper rifles to tanks , there were a lot of time to revive it -- i see some steps in this direction , e.g. 
  military factories switched today to war-time 24-hour around-the-clock work , but as usually ukraine reacts two steps too late . 
  the main problem is that most of actions of ukrainian military ( and not just military ) command are somewhere between incompetence and treason . 
  not yet , but the situation for ukraine is obviously grim . 
  [ very good analysis ] ( http://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2014/08/29/7036170/ ) ( in russian ) of the current situation by biletsky , the leader of azov battalion . 
  ( yes , the leader of supposedly all-nazi battalion writes a post completely in russian , and did n't even write `` sieg heil ! '', 
  a single time ) . 
  long story short , ua forces lost a lot of military equipment in numerous meaningless , non-coordinated , poorly thought-out attacks in hope to raise the flag over one more village as soon as possible . 
  so currently ukraine has enough infantry , but not enough heavy military vehicles . 
  now ukraine needs to create a stable defense line , then create assault fists behind it -- blitzkrieg did n't happen , now ukraine should try to carry out slow positional campaign . 
  yatsenyuk yesterday said very clearly in private ( there was a leaked video ) that new sanctions at this point , during ongoing invasion by russian regular forces are like vitamins for a dead body . 
  ukraine ca n't stand larger , better equipped , and better trained army . 
  why europe ca n't provide military and intelligence aid , even the simplest stuff -- that 's beyond me . 
  conflict with tanks and ballistic missiles will not suddenly `` escalate '' , if europe will provide e.g. 
  anti-tank missiles or sniper sights . 
  i wrote about it [ there ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2em3dk/ukraine_crisis_russian_paratroopers_captured_in/ck0t8er ) . 
  basically , 3 ( at least ) troopers from pskov were killed under luhansk in 18-20 august . 
  name of one of them was published by ukrainian side and confirmed by his wife in vk social network . 
  but then it turned into some absurd tragicomic cover up operation .
