  somebody : yes , that 's what we talked about . 
  shooting somebody at 5:16 : remove camera !, 
  [ 1 ] this _ porebrik _ ( curb ) lead to a wide discussion about it . 
  ukrainians commented on this that russian-speaking people on ukraine do n't say _ porebrik _ ( they say _ bordyur _ instead ) , up to the point that some even had to google that word . 
  i do n't know how much is that true . 
  while _ porebrik _ is primarily st. petersburg speak ( it 's even nicknamed porebrik-city sometimes ) , it 's also used in some other russian `` porebrik '' cities -- novosibirsk , yekaterinburg , kurgan , ... 
  there were some publications that claimed that word `` porebrik '' was also in use in donetsk , while other people from donetsk claimed that never heard this word before . 
   i remember `` brave freedom fighters '' throwing molotov cocktails , burning people alive . 
  not a single person from police died during maidan from molotov cocktails . 
  all were shot , except 2 who died in fire on berkut base in lviv . 
   i remember videos of people with sniper rifles , i remember people with aks in hotel of ukraine ( i do n't remember the name exactly ) . 
  you `` remember '' them from rt-like source ? 
   i remember the fact that no proper investigation has been conducted in regards to sniper shooting and if someone were to kill ~ 100 people i would like to know who exactly did it , how and why . 
  you remember that `` fact '' , because media you are using do n't report about the investigation . 
  proper investigation is in process . 
  press-conference of avakov , makhnitsky and nalivaychenko on preliminary results happened just a few days ago : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfmzm1jdwkg, 
   how come one is `` brave regime fighters '' and others are supporting terrorists ? 
  probably because they were not heavily armed uniformed forces that use using human shields and are controlled from the foreign country . 
  thanks for repeating the same what i said two messages ago . 
   maybe i 'm missing something and it 's a good thing that thread was so highly upvoted ? 
  it 's not a good thing that it was highly upvoted . 
  but you said that `` everything is taken as true as long as it 's anti-russian '' and that 's just bs . 
  moreover , for example , submission about  100 % voters on crimean referendum was _ removed _ from the subreddit , when people understood that it was just a mistake . 
   then she also showed me some photos he did n't say he saw any evidence in these photos . 
  it was your interpretation . 
  and this tape is indeed shitty propaganda , people who spread it are using appeal to ( non - ) authority fallacy . 
  paet is a foreign minister of estonia , but it does n't make him an authority the subject , and it does n't make him a person with some inside knowledge . 
  all he had was hearsay he collected during short visit to ukraine on february 25 . 
   `` people protesting in support of russia '' < propaganda , the people are paid by russia etc. 
   `` people protesting in support of eu '' < not propaganda . 
  different events are different ? 
  you do n't say . 
   i 'm saying the pro-russian protests should be viewed same way as pro-eu protests they will not be viewed the same , because they are different . 
   meaning that they are n't just propaganda tool , unless there 's direct evidence of the opposite . 
  i never see anybody who claimed that they are just propaganda tool . 
  indeed , there is minority on the east of ukraine that support them . 
   keep going this is interesting . 
  this is just a bunch of half-truths and bullshit . 
  for example :  false , out of context pro-eu/anti-russian submissions on / r/europe [ 1 ] ?
