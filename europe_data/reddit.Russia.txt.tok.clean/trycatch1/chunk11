  not propaganda . 
  [ example : `` russian tv showing crimea as part of russia '' http://i.imgur.com/bs3x7cw.jpg[2] ( 1k + upvotes ) . 
  let 's look -- https://pay.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zq8kf/russian_tv_already_showing_crimea_as_part_of/ top comment :  i read somewhere on twitter ( ca n't find the source now ) that the map was displayed as part of a `` what would happen if ... '' bit , and they just left it up afterwards . 
  second top comment :  this could just be \u201e hypothetical russia '' map . 
  you know ... \u201e this is what russia will look like if the annexation union goes trough '' . 
  and he is using that submission against this subreddit . 
  then :  confirmed phone call where estonian prime minister says to ashton that he was presented with evidence that snipers were shooting both parties ? 
  russian propaganda , and false flag operation . 
  paet ( he is not a pm , but foreign minister ) did n't claim that he saw any evidence . 
  and it \\ _ really \\ _ was taped and leaked by russia for propaganda purposes , while in fact it was just poorly informed person retelling hearsay in a private conversion . 
   people protesting and saying they like eu ? 
  not propaganda . 
  how that 's propaganda if that 's what really happened ? 
  and so on . 
  honestly , all of them look like real people . 
  one was registered in 2008 , another in 2012 , rinnero -- i already saw this username in ukraine-related discussions somewhere . 
  i am more suspicious about upvotes -- you do n't need to register to upvote and you seems to be able to vote multiple times from the same ip . 
  try qgis , it 's free and open-source gis . 
  then google shapefiles for the area you want . 
  then follow some tutorial for qgis , there are plenty of them in the web . 
  rebuttal to what ? 
  i do n't disagree with the article from wikipedia you linked . 
  sadly , it has nothing supporting your funny statements . 
  it 's already obvious that you ca n't explain anything in your amazing theory about `` russians being more aryan than slavic '' without making more and more hilariously ignorant statements , so `` fuck you '' is probably the most compelling argument you can still make . 
  i have to agree , it 's very annoying when people ask questions you do n't answers to . 
  especially if you previously said something extremely stupid , and people ask you to provide some explanations to your claims . 
  yes , i know , my cousin buys into zadornov 's bs . 
  and when there is zadornov on the table , then perpetuum mobiles , secret tesla experiments he was killed for , etc. 
  are just one step away . 
  it 's not a line of reasoning , it 's a link to the wikipedia 's article that does n't support any absurd claims you made . 
  russians have more aryan genes than slavic genes . 
  wtf am i even reading . 
  and i blamed nikonov for stupidity and ignorance . 
  again -- how you got such an amazing idea ? 
  i would love to see your line of reasoning . 
  the person i responded to talked specifically about the size of the sample , not large enough according to him . 
  and so what ? 
  how it have anything to do with you previous beautiful claims about russians descended from aryans ? 
  and that russians are not slavic ? 
  it seems that you have zero idea you are talking about , and just randomly post links to wikipedia articles . 
  why repost obvious bullshit ? 
  lol . 
  it seems that nikonov found quite a bit of allies in / r/europe . 
  they used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multistage_sampling, 
  russians are slavs . 
  this have nothing to do with size of the sample . 
  mp nikonov stated that . 
  and you said that he is `` not completely wrong '' . 
  this diagram demonstrates only that slavs and aryans ( indo-iranians ) have a common ancestor ( both are indo-europeans ) . 
  it does n't prove that slavs descended from aryans . 
  probably because that 's bs . 
  my guess that the guy is just an idiot . 
  in the single sentence he was able to claim aryan roots for russians and simultaneously praise russians for the victory against nazism . 
  ( and also say that siberia is the coldest part of the planet ) . 
  http://www.duma.gov.ru/news/273/646438/ ( edited google translate ) :  from what is written in textbooks and how convincing and exciting it will be written depends the attitude of the whole generation of young people to the history of their country . 
  we must always remember what country we live and work , know its traditions . 
  our fatherland has a great past . 
  branch of the aryan tribe descended from the carpathian mountains , peacefully populated the great russian plain , siberia , the coldest part of the planet , came to the pacific ocean , established fort ross , absorbed juices of richest cultures of byzantium , europe , asia , defeated the worst enemy of humanity - nazism , paved the road to the space . 
  but there are few places where people so poorly know and cheaply appreciate their past and present . 
  he is a doctor of historical sciences . 
  another article , i believe . 
  see [ there ] ( http://denmes.livejournal.com/494073.html ) . 
  this shit lasts for centuries . 
  read e.g. 
  russian magazines from xix . 
  some may argue that 1920s or 1990s were just exceptions from the rule , and russia always returns to its natural state with tsar , stalin , or putin . 
  yeah , it 's seems to be an article about the previous attempt . 
  new attempt : http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/727175 edit : that said , our mps do a lot of stupid shit , i would not pay much attention . 
  for example , yesterday one mp ( head of education committee btw ) said that russians are descendants of aryans . 
  considering how well the guys from nikolaev kicked asses of pro-putin thugs who tried to seize administrative building , it 's seems that majority of them are `` banderivtsy '' from `` right sector '' . 
  what a scary world . 
  banderivtsy and right sector are everywhere . 
  yeah . 
  local banderivtsy from nikolaev . 
  ( who do n't understand the stupidity of this statement -- it 's a city on ukrainian south with 80 % of population who speak mostly in russian , and 6 % of population of who speak mostly in ukrainian . ), 
  recently there was an interesting leak from the official twitter account of russian ministry of foreign affairs -- they linked to a `` good '' article and asked to support it on fb and twitter . 
  somebody erroneously posted it to the public feed . 
  the interesting part of it -- that it was a link to a _ german _ article in _ german _ spiegel . 
  then recently _ polish _ newsweek analysed pro-kremlin comments under their articles , and understood that they were made by astroturfers using proxies . 
  so if they care even about german and polish web , existence of kremlin bots in english web is pretty much given . 
  for completeness , kin-dza-dza was created by a georgian , and ilf was a jew . 
  / r/politota is a bit of circlejerk . 
  and it 's just a low traffic shadow of politota on d3 . 
   / r/ukrainianconflict [ 1 ] has also been occupied by , what it seems like , angsty putin teenagers . 
  the thing is that most of russians think like that . 
  even educated , high-income , middle class , young , etc. 
  part . 
  sadly . 
  man , seriously , read wikipedia or something . 
  4.5 % margin of error means that if they report 40.8 % who support ukrainian protests , then with confidence 95 % real share of people who support ukrainian protests are from 36 % to 45.3 % ( in fact errors are smaller for smaller means , see my response below with exact numbers ) , but most likely they will be pretty close to 40.8 % . 
  you do n't need to ask and every person to population mind share , because of magic called statistics . 
  relatively small sample will be enough . 
  see e.g. 
  [ margin of error ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/margin_of_error ) in wikipedia and so on . 
  for sample size 500 , the margin of error [ will be ] ( http://ideone.com/lzuji0 ) require ( binom ) binom.confint ( x = c ( 250 , 125 , 75 , 25 , 10 , 5 ) , n = 500 , conf.level = 0.95 , method = `` exact '' ) output : method x n mean lower upper 1 exact 250 500 0.50 0.455285569 0.54471443 2 exact 125 500 0.25 0.212619263 0.29036601 3 exact 75 500 0.15 0.119848623 0.18435964 4 exact 25 500 0.05 0.032615180 0.07292762 5 exact 10 500 0.02 0.009631430 0.03647241 6 exact 5 500 0.01 0.003254721 0.02318139 as you can see for n = 500 , the error is approximately equal to 4.5 % with confidence 95 % , when mean is around 50 % , and smaller for small means . 
  just like it was claimed in the source . 
  well , the previous interesting poll was downvoted in / r/ukrainianconflict as bullshit propaganda , because something something iri , something something mccain . 
  and it was done by gallup , well-known polling organization . 
  so i do n't bother posting there since then -- repost it if you want . 
  ok , maybe it was wrong , but your source confirms that these guys are armed and use women as human shield .
