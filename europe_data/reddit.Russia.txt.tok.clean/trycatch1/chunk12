   they expect the assault today . 
  `` they called the women , women lined up a human shield in order to prevent a possible storm the building , '' - he added . 
   then denying it would make these guys the silliest terrorists in history . 
  not at all . 
  they want to scare off _ government _ while keeping face among _ general public _ at the same time . 
  well , these guys fit to my image of `` terrorist '' pretty closely : https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=4bus2fxayhg and sbu claims that they took 60 persons as hostages -- have no idea , if it 's true or not . 
  well , it 's not like borders are closed or something . 
  according to euromaidan twitter , all of detained are citizens of ukraine . 
  that said , who the hell are the people who set on fire buildings in _ their own city _ ? 
  edit : photos of results from the fire : https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.436601873143914.1073741885.382115471925888&amp;type=1 first estimates of damages -- 10m of hryvnas ( 800k dollars ) . 
  you must be kidding . 
  or you seriously think that the government should not free buildings seized by violent armed mobs ? 
   without accepting that ukraine as it currently is can not stay . 
  it needs massive internal reforms , partition or something . 
  yeah , yeah , that 's what kremlin propaganda says . 
  except overwhelming majority of ukraine , even south and east , [ is against federalization ] ( http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/2014%20april%205%20iri%20public%20opinion%20survey%20of%20ukraine%2c%20march%2014-26%2c%202014.pdf ) ( page 37 ) . 
  maybe russia itself should finally `` federalize '' again and at least bring back to regions direct elections of governors ? 
  my point is that problem with trust to binaries is solvable , moreover , it 's practically solvable , and there is work in this direction . 
  ( however , i 'm not aware about cases when build servers of a popular distros were compromised and produced compromised binaries , so it 's more of a theoretical threat . ), 
  you just ca n't do this with proprietary software , you ca n't detect if build servers of your proprietary software vendor are compromised or not -- neither practically nor theoretically . 
  of course , you are right there issues with trust to upstream source , trust to distro-specific patches ( and famous debian openssl bug demonstrate that it 's a real problem ) . 
  it 's not a perfect system , but it 's much better than just running black boxes on your machine .

  russian side claims that the ukrainian major was drunk and attacked russian soldier , the soldier was injured and he killed major in self-defense . 
  illegal pretty much means that they have no right to do this . 
  i did n't discuss ethics and the concept of right and wrong . 
  euromaidan started as a peaceful protest . 
  it turned violent when yanukovich tried to violently suppress it , including methods like using paramilitary gangs ( see [ titushky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/titushky ) and oplot ) , destruction of protesters property ( see burned and destroyed cars of automaidan 's activists ) , forced disappearances ( up to 200 activists of maidan are still missing ) , beatings ( google e.g. 
  [ tetiana chornovol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tetiana_chornovol#25_december_attack ) or yuriy verbytskyi ) , and then decided to forbid protesting at all . 
  at this point violent response ( to some \\ _ limited _ extent ) was justified -- sorry , but everybody has right of self-defense . 
  in case of pro-kremlin protests , they _ start _ as violent protests from the beginning , without any provocation from the government . 
  it 's illegal according to the criminal code of ukraine , article 110 : http://kodeksy.com.ua/ka/ugolovnyj_kodeks_ukraini/statja-110.htm, 
   the eastern ukrainians have the same rights we are so quick to afford to the more pro-european west . 
  they have rights to peacefully protest , but they have no rights to seize buildings , beat people and police , and call for separatism . 
   you would have thought that the idiots in the rada learnt their lesson after the language bill fiasco and crimea . 
  that 's basically kremlin narrative . 
  while it was a poor decision to repeal the bill , the `` language bill fiasco '' was little more than excuse for russian propaganda . 
  crimean speaker konstantinov said in 2013 that the language law is unnecessary for them . 
  governor of donetsk said that the language law did n't change anything for them . 
  the whole issue around repealing of this law was hugely overblown . 
  according to [ this source ] ( http://delo.ua/world/v-mnogonacionalnoj-rossii-hotjat-otkazatsja-ot-principa-multiku-232454/ ) , they also claim that terms _ russky _ ( ethnically russian ) and _ rossiysky _ ( citizen of russian federation , not necessarily ethnic russian ) are practically the same thing ( !, 
  yesterday there was [ an awesome article ] ( http://izvestia.ru/news/568603 ) in a major pro-kremlin outlet with response to comparisons of putin 's and hitler 's annexations -- apparently , hitler was not at all bad before 1939 , he just gathered land and stuff . 
  he had to stop in 1939 , in this case he would be considered as one the greatest german politicians . 
  context -- that 's from project `` foundations of state cultural policy '' created by the ministry of culture and recently sent to the administration of president . 
  the project was in development from october 2013 , and putin himself explained how important is that project on march 25 -- `` this document should cause wide public resonance , because culture belongs to all people and each person '' . 
  fragments from this project were published only recently . 
  google translate :  russia should be considered a unique and distinctive civilization , that ca n't be reduced to either the west or to the east . 
  brief formulation of this position is the thesis that `` russia is not europe '' , confirmed by the whole history of the country and people . 
  [ ... ]  it seems appropriate to include in the document thesis renouncing the principles of multiculturalism and tolerance . 
  preserving the single cultural code requires the denial of state support for cultural projects that impose alien social norms [ ... ]  no references to `` creative freedom '' and `` national distinctiveness '' can justify the behavior that is considered unacceptable from the standpoint of traditional russian values . 
  this is not meant to limit the freedom of expression and the rights of citizens , but requires denial of state support to people and communities , demonstrating behavior contrary to the cultural norms [ ... ]  lack of world outlook and imposition of alien values , including by means of pseudo art , leads to mental distress , which is manifested through the increase in crime , alcoholism , drug addiction , through the increase in the number of suicides and abandoned children 's parents , through the increase of morbidity and mortality [ ... ], 
  press-conference of avakov right now : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9vomyrwsfi, 
  and he again talked about rail gauges . 
  facepalm . 
  there are plenty of people like him . 
  vitaly milonov ( author of anti-gay laws ) in early 2000s participated in anti-putin and anti-war protests with posters like `` no to militarism -- hitlerism , stalinism , putinism '' , `` milosevic -- fascist '' , `` f\u00fchrer lukashenko '' , etc. 
  -- now he attacks anti-war protesters and recently opened russian human rights center for serbs in kosovo . 
  irina yarovaya ( author of anti-protest law , laws about foreign agents , etc. ), 
  moved from liberal yabloko to united russia in mid-2000 for apartments and car in moscow . 
   journalist ca n't be separated from ethics . 
  but the people you see on the screen -- they often ca n't be called journalists , because often they are just agitators . 
  and agitator , author of a pamphlet or a writer -- has the right to do it , as well as an artist has the right to paint the picture in red , entirely , and to say `` that 's how i see the world '' , that 's my artistic vision . 
  but journalists have no right to do it , because the task of the journalist , in my opinion , is to demonstrate the true proportions of the world , to show the whole picture of the world . 
  it is rather a problem of the public , which looks at the screen and must understand who is in front of them - a journalist or an agitator . 
   we are talking about professional journalism . 
  if we say `` the crowd eat that up '' , then they will eat up perpetual lowering of the bar -- more vulgar , more naked ... any scandalous behavior , any lowering of the bar , any decline in morality and rules -- and the crowd will eat that up . 
  but then one day we 'll find ourselves in mud taking bath like pigs . 
  and the society will be like that . 
  and we will eat each other with mud . 
  and that 's where we 'll find ourselves . 
  and there would be nowhere to fall lower . 
  [ dmitry kiselev , 1999 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gzifjijasi ) ( edited google translate ), 
  avakov recently announced that some preliminary results and the names of arrested suspects will be published on april 3 . 
  seriously . 
  he was _ economical _ adviser of putin . 
  it was his finest hour , so now media is ready to retranslate any crazy shit that `` ex-adviser of putin '' ( or even `` putin adviser '' ) says . 
  two his favorite hobbies are to prove that russia attacked first in the 2008 georgian war ( theory that contradicts to the eu investigation ) and to deny global warming . 
  as economist he up to august 2008 repeatedly predicted that crisis and recession will not happen . 
  translated transcript in / r/worldnews -- http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/21ia5a/turkey_bans_youtube/cgdas8n, 
  as far as i remember , after the scandal with ponosov , federal government bought for all schools package of proprietary software ( windows , mso , etc. ), 
  licensed for 3 years -- with target to replace in 3 years proprietary software with free software . 
  and some schools really migrated to linux , when the license has expired , because they had no other choice . 
  there was also this funny document : http://government.consultant.ru/page.aspx?8411;1536480, 
  in uruguay them seem to have pretty good progress with linux deployment : http://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-uy-monthly-201202-201402 in russia actually it was n't that bad when they started migration to linux in schools , sadly when putin replaced medvedev , he scrapped the program . 
  that 's not exactly same type of the poll , because in case of the sun there was no `` i do n't know '' answer option . 
  so 75 % answered correctly about the sun , while only 34 % answered correctly about katyn ( vs 24 % who think it was done by nazis ) . 
  also , revisionists are pretty vocal . 
  katyn.ru is a revisionist site for example . 
  communists from kprf still support nazi version , and voted against declaration about katyn in duma . 
  on pro-putin/nationalist sites it probably will be hard to find a single person in comments who support the version that it was done by stalin . 
  at best they are talking about [ russian pows who died in polish camps in 1920s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/camps_for_russian_prisoners_and_internees_in_poland_%281919%e2%80%9324%29 ) as an argument why russia should n't apologize for katyn . 
  1/4 of russians [ still believe ] ( http://www.levada.ru/21-04-2011/o-tragedii-v-katyni-i-otnosheniyakh-s-polshei ) that nazi killed them , 40 % have no idea who are guilty . 
  most likely he meant [ volhynia massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_poles_in_volhynia_and_eastern_galicia ) that was indeed committed by upa . 
  katyn is rarely called `` massacre '' in russian -- it 's katyn shooting , or katyn tragedy , or just katyn . 
  actually , i listened the speaker and he indeed said ( on 3:00 ) that banderivets committed terrible crimes -- katyn massacre , volhynia massacre ; and then they all chant together `` pole , remember katyn ! '', 
  so , long story short , it 's not malice , it 's just a group of some special kind of idiots . 
  nationalists do n't mind , say , chechens living in chechnya ( especially under control of russians -- like in a colony ) .
