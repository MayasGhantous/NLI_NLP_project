  they are against e.g. 
  people from caucasus who migrated to , say , moscow or st. petersburg . 
  russia is vastly multinational , but for example according to 2010 census in st. petersburg 92.5 % were ethnic russians + 2.5 % more were belarusians and ukrainians ( that 's out of people who answered on question about their nationality ) . 
  also , putin says a lot of things . 
  he once said that those who use slogan `` russia for russians '' are either idiots or provocateurs , because russia is multinational . 
  propaganda will highlight his words that are currently necessary . 
  note that vera alperovich is not some random person pretending to be an `` expert '' to voice their biased opinion , but a real expert on this topic from [ sova center ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sova_center ) . 
  because minister of defense -- tenyukh from svoboda -- is incompetent . 
  people like to call svoboda fascists , neo-nazists , etc. , but look at the ukrainian army under his command -- it 's the most peaceful army in the world . 
  there were plenty of time to organize defense , or organize evacuation , or do something . 
  nothing was done at all . 
  read [ the blog ] ( http://belbek62.com.ua/novosti/kak-eto-proiskhodit.html ) of belbek military base -- the military base that was stormed yesterday ( translation from [ there ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/212v7i/explosions_and_shots_heard_as_russian_forces/cg9f2oe ) by / u/87percentkat + edited google translate ) :  `` after nearly a month , comes the realization that the most dangerous enemy is not even russian troops . 
  they act quite competently in terms of the acquisition of territory . 
  our most dangerous enemy is our government . 
  its complete inaction and pulling the wool over people 's eyes . 
   the situation described in some media and press conferences is radically different from reality . 
  today defense minister tenyukh claimed that he maintains contact with all parts of the territory of the autonomous republic of crimea , that orders were given to all troops and that the situation is under control . 
  our only orders were `` to remain in place '' and `` you are allowed to use weapons . '', 
  that 's all ... and what help is that when we are being stormed ? 
  especially when the tactics of the russian troops are to send women and children ahead of them to cover them ? 
  there were two options : either to send troops to help our men in crimea and start fighting , or to remove us from crimea . 
  we missed the boat on the first one , and we are about to miss the boat on the second . 
   [ ... ]  now in ukraine they create armed units from almost civilians . 
  at the same time in crimea they throw out more than 20 thousands of professional soldiers . 
  unique logic . 
  although , if you consider that as another step of `` flushing '' crimea and other regions of ukraine down the toilet - the decision becomes understandable . 
   we were very `` pleased '' with the order to detain all servicemen on exit from crimea . 
  by the way , it already started to work . 
  servicemen are being taken from trains , put in handcuffs and taken away . 
  and that 's for month they stayed for nothing , surrounded by the enemy , without orders , without any support from the government . 
  so it goes . 
  there is a consistent view that for our comrades in kiev it 's just beneficial if all military bases will be captured . 
  not again this russian propaganda bs . 
  no , he was n't ousted by violent coup after already agreeing to earlier elections . 
  he declined to do his part of agreement -- according to it he had to sign the law returning the consitution of 2004 in 48 hours . 
  instead he decided to voluntarily run away cutting all communications to the point that even people from his own party were not able to contact with him . 
  after 48 hours this agreement was just a useless piece of paper . 
  there is no such thing as `` the 75 % required to actually remove him from office '' . 
  3/4 of rada are required in process of _ impeachment _ , and that 's just one step of it -- 1/2 of rada should initiate process of impeachment , then special investigation commission should be created , then 2/3 of rada should charge the president , then constitutional and supreme courts of ukraine should approve , and _ only then _ you are able to vote to impeach the president with 3/4 of rada . 
  your 75 % are entirely irrelevant , because not only rada did n't vote to impeach him -- they just were not able to vote to impeach him . 
  yanukovich was n't impeached . 
  what really happened -- rada established that he voluntarily _ withdrew from performing his constitutional powers and stopped fulfill his constitutional duties _ . 
  what to do in this situation is not described anywhere in constitution . 
  if you want your 75 % -- yatsenyuk , pm of the new government , was elected with 371 votes , more than 82 % of rada . 
  both sides are equally corrupt bla-blah-blah . 
  show anything like mezhyhirya owned by the opposition ( including poroshenko who is legitimately very rich ) , or even past presidents of ukraine . 
  yanukovich is simply the most corrupt politician in ukraine ever . 
  [ according to konstantinov ] ( http://www.nr2.ru/crimea/431099.html ) ( speaker of crimean parliament ) in 2013 , year ago ( google translate ) :  `` we have our own constitution , which indicate the right to use three languages , the supreme council of crimea recognize russian as language of communication - the speaker said . 
  - this law , which was adopted , gives us nothing new . 
  therefore , we decided to use the constitution . '', 
   `` lawyers versed in the process and we were told that to take it [ the regional status ] , it is not necessary - it is automatically put into effect . 
  rule of law and rules of our constitution we reconciled - our constitution protects stronger all three languages - argued his position konstantinov . 
  - this law is more interesting , perhaps , for all other territories . 
  for the autonomous republic of crimea our constitution is more than enough . 
  and guys like that are talking about fascists in ukraine ... 
  i am sure you do n't forget to remind to those around you that thomas jefferson was first and foremost a slave-owning douchebag and abe lincoln was a racist asshole . 
  look , everything should be assessed in context . 
  in historical , in cultural context . 
  in context of the netherlands navalny probably can be considered a bad bad terrible nationalist . 
  in context of russia is almost liberal , he is far less nationalist than his opponents from kremlin , and he is a progressive force standing for right things . 
  do n't form your opinion on garbage articles like that . 
  while russians of course were traditionally homophobic to some extent ( in russia homosexuality was decriminalized only in 1993 , depatologolized in 1999 ) , you ca n't ignore importance of putin hate propaganda . 
  according to the polls of pew global attitudes project amount of russians who think that homosexuality is not acceptable [ raised from ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u041e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435_\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430_\u043a_\u0433\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 ) from 64 % in 2007 to 74 % in 2013 . 
  according to levada polls , number of russians who think that homosexuality is an acceptable sexual orientation [ shrunk from 20 % in 2005 to 12 % in 2013 ] ( http://www.levada.ru/17-05-2013/obshchestvennoe-mnenie-o-gomoseksualistakh ) , number of russians who `` absolutely agree '' with statement `` gays and lesbians should enjoy the same rights as all other citizens '' shrunk from 17 % in 2005 to 7 % in 2013 . 
  these people are deputies , they have immunity ( they promised not to use it , but anyway ) . 
  they `` apologized '' for that incident , sort of . 
  general prosecution office started investigation , but the general prosecutor is a member of svoboda himself . 
  that 's beyond stupid . 
  tyahnybok uses his \\* left \\* hand to point to something , and they are trying to represent it like he is making nazi salute ? 
  if you want to find a photograph of a fake nazi salute , at least find one when the target uses their \\* right \\* hand . 
  for example , like [ this one for merkel ] ( http://westsidetoastmasters.com/resources/book_of_body_language/images/036-palm_down.jpg ) , or [ this one for yanukovich ] ( http://bm.img.com.ua/img/prikol/images/large/4/1/200714_455140.jpg ) , or [ this one for medvedev ] ( http://std3.ru/6f/ed/1388703935-6fed4b32ecbcd2acbfb940ce7134c699.jpeg ) . 
  budget of abkhazia 2013 : 5.3 b rubles income , 1.9 b ( 36 % ) out of them were provided by russia . 
  so it looks a bit better than in south ossetia ( abkhazia has 5x more population however ) . 
  however , their current state is pretty poor : [ traveler 's ] ( http://nodima.livejournal.com/56050.html ) [ photo ] ( http://fishki.net/10571-abhazija-segodnja-84-foto.html ) [ reports ] ( http://cyxymu.livejournal.com/1291637.html ) [ are ] ( http://cyxymu.livejournal.com/1187952.html ) [ actually ] ( http://vmulder.livejournal.com/tag/%d0%90%d0%b1%d1%85%d0%b0%d0%b7%d0%b8%d1%8f ) [ pretty ] ( http://www.marshruty.ru/photos/photos.aspx?size=l&amp;albumid=8fd780a2-7015-4a42-a64f-028d8fa393c7 ) [ telling ] ( http://www.tema.ru/travel/abkhazia/ ) . 
  especially comparing to adjara that reunited with georgia 10 years go . 
  edit : typos, 
  in 2013 south ossetia budget had income 4.73 b rub , and 4.25 b rub out of them were provided by russia . 
  that 's 90 % . 
  and they still are not happy . 
  independent country my ass . 
  i mean their site is literally wordpress with litepress theme , they have very little information about them , no information about chief editor for example . 
  but they apparently have great anonymous turkish diplomatic sources . 
  there are a lot of real news around ukraine/crimea -- like murder of crimean tatar reshat ametov -- but it 's better to discuss something like this . 
  great speech . 
  highlights -- there is no legitimate ukrainian government , it was uzurped by impostors , ideologic successors of bandera ; bolsheviks gave to ukraine historically russian territories ( modern south-east of ukraine ) , khruschev actions were against soviet constitution ; crimean people asked to protect their rights and lives , so it was not possible to leave them in the lurch -- it would be a treason then ; russian opposition is apparently 5th column and `` national traitors '' .

  yes , very sketchy , `` hvilya '' does n't look like a reliable source . 
  better to ignore rumors and hearsay like that completely . 
  these numbers -- 1.724.563 -- were reported by itar-tass : http://itar-tass.com/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/1051661, 
  i did n't say it invaded anything . 
  `` svoboda '' is nationalistic , it 's neither fascist nor neo-nazi . 
  and damn , it 's not an invention of maidan , the party was elected to rada in 2012 with 10.5 % . 
  what `` fascist '' things they did since then in rada ? 
   http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26394980 wow , i did n't expect shit like this from bbc . 
  guy says :  \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b-\u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u044f\u0445 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0435\u0442 translation :  national socialistic theme -- sometimes in some people it shows through bbc translation :  national socialistic themes are popular amongst some of us and so on . 
  apparently anything goes , if you want to blame `` nazis '' . 
  read the detailed report on the 2008 war by amnesty international : http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/eur04/005/2008/en it was georgia who attacked . 
  version about russian tanks was invented by georgian side later , when the war was already over . 
  also georgia used grad on tskhinvali on 7 august on objects that were close to civilian population -- it lead to majority of 133 ossetian civilian deaths . 
  and they killed plenty of russian peacekeepers .
