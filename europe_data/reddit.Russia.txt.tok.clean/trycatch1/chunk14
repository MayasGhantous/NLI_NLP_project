  i am not trying to defend russian side , it did plenty of things it should be blamed for ( see the aforementioned report ) , but georgian side was far from clean . 
  well , there was a great article about margarita simonyan eating big mac . 
  lenta.ru is down . 
  you can [ use google translate ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ru&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.forumdaily.com%2fkak-gazeta-haaretz-perevrala-ukrainskogo-ravvina%2f ) , it 's generally provides adequate russian -  english translation . 
  long story short -- 1 ) haaretz chronologically moved the statement by the rabbi . 
  reuven azman told about it on 20 february , the day when snipers killed more than 50 , so it made sense in context . 
  haaretz published it on 22 february , when yanukovich fled and the situation was stable . 
  2 ) haaretz misquoted azman , his statement was not about all jews , but only women and children . 
  extended to all kiev 's jews by haaretz . 
  3 ) and then haaretz claimed that azman had connections with kremlin -- and that was the claim azmad actually considered to sue them for . 
  i confirm that , lj was completely blocked by rostelecom . 
  see [ how newspaper haaretz distorted words of ukrainian rabbi ] ( http://www.forumdaily.com/kak-gazeta-haaretz-perevrala-ukrainskogo-ravvina/ ) ( in russian ) -- the rabbi even considered to sue haaretz for slander . 
  it was n't even 22 february , it was ** 20 ** february , when  50 were killed in the center of kiev . 
  that was not common . 
  major resources are completely blocked by my isp -- livejournal , echo msk , grani , ej . 
  internet filtering laws were adopted in 2012-2013 , but they were not widely abused before . 
  something like that happened before in some regions , but now they are blocked by rostelekom in st. petersburg . 
  russia is now officially caught up to china . 
  edit : all unblocked by my isp , lj did n't even delete [ navalny blog ] ( http://navalny.livejournal.com/914090.html ) ( echo msk deleted his blog ) . 
  grani were taken down by their web hoster . 
  wow , livejournal is blocked by rostelekom in spb ( completely ) . 
  and http://echo.msk.ru/ . 
  a lot of sites are blocked . 
  it 's really freaking annoying to use proxy when all you need is to read some harmless programming blog post , that has the same ip as something blocked . 
  formally even [ wikipedia should be blocked ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%92%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%bf%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b8%d1%8f:%d0%a1%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%86%d1%8b_%d0%92%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%bf%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%b8,_%d0%b2%d0%bd%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%91%d0%bd%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b5_%d0%b2_%d0%95%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%82%d1%80_%d0%b7%d0%b0%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b5%d1%89%d1%91%d0%bd%d0%bd%d1%8b%d1%85_%d1%81%d0%b0%d0%b9%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b2 ) , but isps ignore it . 
  no , they were not rightfully worried . 
  crimean speaker konstantinov year ago said that the law was absolutely non-important for crimea , because special status of russian and crimean tatar languages in crimean constitution granted more rights to them than the law . 
  the very same law that become hugely important for some reason for the very same speaker . 
  also , ukraine ca n't just abolish regional languages , because it 's a member of european charter for regional or minority languages ( russia is n't ) . 
   crimeans just woke up one morning and randomly decided to seceed . 
  crimeans did n't randomly decide to seceed , they decided to seceed after russian invasion . 
  a bit edited google translate :  dear readers !, 
    today , on march 12 , the owner of `` afisha - rambler - sup '' alexander mamut fired chief editor of `` lenta.ru '' galina timchenko . 
  newly appointed editor is alexei goreslavskii - deputy director general for external communications . 
    unfortunately , it is not a routine castling , so it requires some explanation . 
  we believe that this appointment is a direct pressure on the editorial staff of `` lenta.ru '' . 
  dismissal of an independent chief and appointment of a controlled person , including directly controlled from the kremlin offices - is a violation of the law on the media talking about the inadmissibility of censorship . 
    over the past couple of years the space of free journalism in russia has decreased dramatically . 
  some media outlets are directly controlled from the kremlin , others - through curators , and others - by editors who fear about their jobs . 
  some media outlets were closed , others will be closed in the coming months . 
  the problem is not that we have nowhere to run . 
  the problem is that you seem to have nothing more to read . 
    we certainly expected that they would come for us . 
    we believe that this will not last forever . 
  in any case , you , dear readers , should know about it . 
    we hope to see you soon . 
    your dear editorial staff . 
  goreslavskij is a well-known person , he is a former editor of vz.ru , an absolutely terrible kremlin shithole . 
  i understand that you feel butthurt about kosovo , but seriously -- educate yourself . 
  he did n't came to power through the coup . 
  he was an elected speaker of rada , and started to be acting president when previous president murdered 100 and runaway . 
  well , if you do n't know i 'll try to educate you then . 
  it was voted by rada , but vetoed by the acting president few days after . 
  it is n't . 
  damn . 
  yanukovich was n't impeached . 
  they establish that he on his own withdrew from performing his work as president and stopped to fulfill his duties . 
  the full text :  given that the president of ukraine viktor yanukovych withdrew from performing the constitutional powers , which threatens the controllability of the state , territorial integrity and sovereignty of ukraine , massive violation of human rights and freedoms of citizens , based on the circumstances of extreme urgency , the verkhovna rada of ukraine , expressing the sovereign will of the ukrainian people decides : to establish that ukrainian president viktor yanukovych withdrew from performing the constitutional powers , and acts as such who does not fulfill his duties . 
  second - to set the date for special presidential election in ukraine on may 25 , 2014 constitution does n't describe what to do in this situation , so everything you cite is irrelevant . 
  and seriously ... yanukovich ordered to shot in his own citizens murdering almost 100 , he stole insane amounts of money , he illegitimately increased his own powers changing the constitution , he imprisoned his opponent in the presidential race , he fled to the country of aggressors that invaded his own country , and now from russia he says that `` ukraine is \\* our \\* strategical partner '' , in a few days he will be expelled from his own party , even his supporters putin and medvedev admit that currently he has zero political weight in ukraine , he had freaking golden bread in his residency !, 
  but let 's concentrate on the formalities in the impeachment process . 
  the law about regional languages \\ _ was n't \\ _ abolished . 
  may we stop talking about it ? 
  situation with minority languages in ukraine is hardly worse than in russia . 
  ukraine is a member of [ european charter for regional or minority languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_charter_for_regional_or_minority_languages ) , but russia did n't ratify it . 
  there are ~ 1700 russian schools in ukraine ( 8m russians live in ukraine ) , and only ~ 15 ukrainian schools in russia ( 2m ukrainians with russian passport live in russia ) . 
  oh , stop repeating rubbish propaganda . 
  the law ** was n't ** abolished in the first place . 
  the law was n't even important for crimea , that has its own constitution that grants special status to crimean tatar and russian languages . 
  year ago the very same crimean speaker [ konstantinov stated that ] ( http://www.nr2.ru/crimea/431099.html ) ( google translate ) :  `` we have our own constitution , which indicated the right to use three languages , the supreme council of crimea recognize russian language language of communication - the speaker said . 
  - this law , which was adopted , the new gives us nothing . 
  therefore , we decided to use the constitution . '', 
   `` lawyers versed in the process and we were told that to take it [ the regional status ] , it is not necessary - it is automatically put into effect . 
  rule of law and rules of our constitution we reconciled - our constitution protects stronger all three languages - argued his position konstantinov . 
  - this law is more interesting , perhaps , for all other territories . 
  for the autonomous republic of crimea our constitution is more than enough . 
  but now the law of course is hugely important , because it can be used for propaganda . 
   i saw your post . 
  i have no idea why i should take some google maps graphic made by i do n't know who in a language i do n't understand serious . 
  dude , no offense , but it seems that you are too dumb to understand any human language . 
  ok , i am not going to bother here anymore . 
  it 's the same as trying to explain something to a 9/11 truther . 
  if you are talking about svoboda , it 's not fascist . 
  read [ the assessment of svoboda by the leader of the association of jewish organisations and communities of ukraine ] ( http://www.vaadua.org/news/pravozashchitnik-iosif-zisels-o-evreyah-i-svobode ) ( edited google translate ) :  in practice , there are really some anti-semitic elements in `` svoboda '' , and we monitor them more than 20 years , since the days when the party was still known as the social-national party of ukraine . 
  anti-semitic rhetoric is becoming less and less prevalent . 
  for example , of the 37 deputies of the verkhovna rada of the party `` svoboda '' only six or seven people in the 20 years indulged in anti-semitic statements . 
   there is nothing directly antisemitic in the program of `` svoboda '' , nothing directly xenophobic either , although there are indirect xenophobic elements in this program . 
  from the rostrum of parliament deputies `` svoboda '' did not say a single - stress !, 
  - a single anti-semitic statement , unlike the deputies of the party `` jobbik '' in hungary or deputies of the party `` attack '' in bulgaria . 
   unless there is a political science definition as anti-semitic party , which may be to hang on `` svoboda '' ? 
  `` svoboda '' - a radical nationalist party , and i think that 's the right name . 
  it pursues a number of objectives in the struggle , and the priorities of these goals requires a separate study . 
  for example , the government of ukraine - one of the main goals , maybe even the most basic to the `` svoboda '' . 
  russian authorities - another important goal . 
  homophobia - a very important goal . 
  migrantophobia much less important goal , as in ukraine , this problem is not an important cultural and ideological feature of society . 
  communists - an important goal for the `` svoboda '' as well as collaborators , people who cooperate with the authorities and with the `` pro-russian authorities '' in ukraine . 
  and finally , the jews , and i think that jews control purposes of `` svoboda '' are the last or penultimate position , and fight with the jews - is not the goal of `` svoboda '' as an organization , it 's only the purpose of only some members of the `` svoboda '' . 
  `` svoboda '' is not a homogeneous party , it is not stable stable party , and we take this into account . 
  i largely distance myself from the `` svoboda '' .
