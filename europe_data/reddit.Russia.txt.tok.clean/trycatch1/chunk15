  but , for example , on the day when i was on the maidan , there were about 40 people on the podium - priests of different denominations , two u.s. senators , representatives of civil society , opposition leaders , poets , writers and others . 
  i had to remain silent ? 
  are they nice guys ? 
  nope . 
  but they are not fascists either . 
   sounds like you 're saying i 'm as dumb as paet ... no , paet is nowhere nearly as dumb as you . 
  paet was just poorly informed and made wrong conclusions , while you are mindlessly repeating stupid putin propaganda . 
   this is hilarious . 
  so he talks about it in great detail , referencing specific evidence , and talks to a colleague as if it were sound . 
  nope , that 's you are hilarious . 
  what specific evidence against opposition he referenced ? 
  nothing . 
  he did n't have any evidence in the first place , just hearsay . 
  but even the hearsay he had ( that both police and protesters were killed by the same bullets ) did n't point at protesters . 
   funny too you do n't bother to provide a source . 
  funny that you did n't bother to read my posts , but blame me . 
  look at this link again : https://mapsengine.google.com/map/viewer?mid=zvkhqufcetxo.kgcjaocfbd7u it contains tons of references to the various primary sources . 
  see also transcript of one of the intercepted sniper 's conversation : http://ord-ua.com/2014/02/23/peregovory-snajperov/ ( if you do n't know russian , use google translate ) . 
  there are plenty of [ such sniper tapes ] ( http://ord-ua.com/2014/02/24/peregovory-alfy/ ) that link snipers to the yanukovich 's forces with certainty , but of course you prefer to believe taped second-hand hearsay of a estonian minister . 
   if he said what you claim , and if there is an investigation in course , i 'd actually like to know . 
  * february 23 -- prosecutors merged all maidan murders into the single criminal proceeding about mass murder in the center of kiev http://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2014/02/23/7015928/ * february 23 -- makhnitsky states that parts of a sniper rifle and shells were found in the national bank of ukraine during investigation http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/3310190-snaiperskoe-oruzhye-obnaruzhyly-v-nbu-makhnytskyi * february 24 -- deputy lt. gen moscal publishes plans of yanukovich against maidan , publishes the names of people who commanded snipers , etc. 
  http://ru.tsn.ua/politika/moskal-opublikoval-dokumenty-s-familiyami-otvetstvennyh-za-rasstrely-lyudey-na-maydane-351009.html * february 24 -- makhnitsky talks about plans of investigators , about ballistic expertise , that crime scene was explored , where the shells were found , cctv video are being gathered , etc. 
  http://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2014/02/24/7016110/ * february 25 -- new interior minister avakov starts internal investigation about actions of police during maidan http://mvs.gov.ua/mvs/control/main/uk/publish/article/986994 * february 26 -- general prosecution of ukraine -- people guilty in mass murders will be punished http://www.gp.gov.ua/ua/news.html?_m=publications&amp;_c=view&amp;_t=rec&amp;id=134870 that 's just some news _ before _ the taped paet ( february 26 ) conversion . 
  enough for you to demonstrate that paet had no idea about things he talked about ? 
  oh , fuck , not that shit again . 
  paet was poorly informed and based his thoughts on hearsay ( funny thing that even hearsay he based his opinion on _ did n't support _ his claims ) . 
  it was taped on february 26 , and he did n't know at the time that actually there was active investigation . 
  but of course a single private conversation of a poorly informed person for conspiracy theorists is a far stronger than thousands of things like video , physical evidence , witness reports , published yanukovich documents , taped sniper communications and so on . 
  just like a single `` strange '' shadow beats millions of facts for conspiratards who believe that americans hoaxed moon landing . 
  go to / r/conspiracy with that garbage , seriously . 
   right , surely eu 's position would have been the same had the events been reversed . 
  reversed in what way -- if protesters decided runaway to russia from yanukovich or if ukraine decided to annex belgorod when there was unrest in russia ? 
   yes he never signed it . 
  because even after the deal the situation did n't calm down . 
  that 's not true . 
  yanukovich still controlled police forces , there was no danger to him whatsoever at this point . 
  he safely left the city without any interruption . 
  but ** even if ** there was danger for him in kiev ( thought experiment , he was safe ) , he was able to move to some place safe for him -- like crimea -- and work like a president there . 
  he did n't do this . 
  instead he just voluntarily disappeared , stopping to communicate even with his own party . 
   you know , those government snipers that apparently were not from the government after all ? 
  nope , but i know that you are just repeating bullshit putin propaganda again . 
  see the map of the snipers : https://mapsengine.google.com/map/viewer?mid=zvkhqufcetxo.kgcjaocfbd7u only few positions were accessible to protesters , and they were accessible to yanukovich forces just as well . 
  most of the shots were fired from positions controlled solely by yanukovich , and were inaccessible to protesters . 
  sorry to disappoint , but the snipers were from the government . 
   and fuck off with the victim blaming . 
  no one 's saying those shot , or their parents are to blame . 
  yes , that 's classic victim blaming . 
  when you are says something in `` both sides are guilty '' in situation when guilt of sides are incomparable , when one side 's actions are criminal , while other side 's action are just mistakes -- that 's victim blaming . 
   some in ukraine did everything they could to not reach a deal and solve the situation peacefully , and cease power for themselves as quickly as possible . 
  the eu watched it and let it all happen . 
  yeah , apparently eu is at fault because it did n't catch nimbly running away president . 
  sorry , but what you are saying is a complete bullshit and straight up victim blaming . 
  it was yanukovich who broke the deal of february 21 . 
  the very first bullet point of the deal -- that yanukovich had to sign in 48 hours the law about restoration of the constitution 2004 . 
  it never happened . 
  rada voted and send him the law , but he did n't sign it neither on feb 21 nor on feb 22 . 
  instead on february 21 he stopped to act as president , stopped to respond , fled first to kharkov and then on february 22 run away to crimea . 
  on february 22 he published 8-minute televised address full of blatant verifiable lies ( for example , he claimed that rada 's speaker rybak was beaten by protesters -- rybak himself said that it was just absurd ) where he stated that he is not going to sign anything , assuming that he already executed his part of the deal . 
  at this point the deal was null and void , and verkhovnaya rada had to take further measures , because de facto there was no president in ukraine anymore . 
  on february 22 rada admitted that yanukovich stopped to act as president , and set the date of the new elections . 
  from _ there _ it should be business as usual . 
  the situation started to stabilize , but putin decided to invade ukraine while the new government was n't strong enough . 
  yeah , seriously . 
  if you 'll look at the site of [ association of jewish organizations and communities of ukraine ] ( http://www.vaadua.org ) there are tons and tons of appeals from various jewish people to not associate maidan with antisemitism . 
  [ some even says ] ( http://www.vaadua.org/news/valeriy-pekar-evrei-i-maydan-pravo-vybora ) that actually yanukovich side was antisemitic , not protesters . 
  [ about svoboda ] ( http://www.vaadua.org/news/pravozashchitnik-iosif-zisels-o-evreyah-i-svobode ) ( edited google translate ) :  in practice , there are really some anti-semitic elements in `` svoboda '' , and we monitor them more than 20 years , since the days when the party was still known as the social-national party of ukraine . 
  anti-semitic rhetoric is becoming less and less prevalent . 
  for example , of the 37 deputies of the verkhovna rada of the party `` svoboda '' only six or seven people in the 20 years indulged in anti-semitic statements . 
   there is nothing directly antisemitic in the program of `` svoboda '' , nothing directly xenophobic either , although there are indirect xenophobic elements in this program . 
  from the rostrum of parliament deputies `` svoboda '' did not say a single - stress !, 
  - a single anti-semitic statement , unlike the deputies of the party `` jobbik '' in hungary or deputies of the party `` attack '' in bulgaria . 
  to be fair , he says that `` svoboda '' is homophobic ( to put it into context , most of the recent anti-gay bills were proposed by yanukovich 's party of regions ) . 
  [ interview of a jewish self-defense member from maidan ] ( http://vaadua.org/news/stoilo-zhit-v-etoy-strane-chtoby-dozhit-do-maydana ) ( edited google translate ) :  q : how heterogeneous is maidan ? 
  how to get along with each other '' right sector '' liberals , '' spilna right '' with `` svoboda '' and so on ? 
  do not lose control levers ? 
  or is it a self-developing organism to which both the government and the opposition have almost no influence ? 
   a : all these fractions are not dominant , accounting for ( combined ) 40 % protesters . 
  and the trend is growing non-factionalism , people come just because they feel it is their duty . 
  in this maidan quite manageable body , there is resistance headquarters , whose decisions are carried out by all factions . 
  except for one incident between `` svoboda '' and '' sp\u0456lnoy right '' ( as we call them , '' ss troops '' ) , the status quo is being maintained ...  [ ... ]  q : not if you have not encountered anti-semitism even , and with a certain condescending attitude , they say , even though a jew , but also the world worth ? 
  i 'm talking about the dichotomy : there is a '' we '' - the ukrainians , and `` they '' - the jews , some of whom - our fellow travelers and even friends . 
  for the question `` jewish matter ? '', 
  define ourselves and our ukrainian neighbors . 
   a : there was no shadow of such sentiments . 
  i talk to the first days of the activists of the `` right sector , '' una-unso - with all those people that in peacetime would be unlikely to find common ground . 
  in this position myself exclusively as a jew , and religious . 
  there are dozens of resistance fighters under my control -- georgians , azerbaijanis , armenians , russian - who do not even try to speak ukrainian - and nor have we encountered a manifestation of intolerance towards each other . 
  all of them with pronounced respect for my religion - they already know what i eat , what not to eat , etc. 
  and it does not cause any rejection . 
  and there are a lot more of similar stuff ... 
  it is n't . 
  kolovrat is an invention of neo-nazis and neo-pagans . 
  see russian wikipedia or [ this topic ] ( http://istorya.ru/forum/?showtopic=5787 ) . 
  of course , swastika is an extremely old symbol used everywhere , because it 's an extremely simple symbol , but it does n't change the fact that rne uses it as slightly modified nazi 's symbol . 
  putin tv loves that thug : * http://www.vesti.ru/videos?vid=582716 -- people 's leader of donbass * http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=1352251 -- civil activist pavel gubarev , named by locals `` people 's governor '' * http://en.itar-tass.com/world/722470 -- people 's governor of eastern donetsk * http://www.1tv.ru/news/world/253623 -- elected on donetsk veche people 's governor, 
  got it from [ there ] ( http://historyimages.blogspot.ru/2009/12/ww2-germany-takes-over-sudetenland.html ) : sudeten germans of the town of ash ( which was predominantly german ) welcome german soldiers . 
  dunno , if the caption is correct . 
  that was not about hitler comparisons or anything . 
  that was just a demonstration that it 's incredibly silly to use such pairs of images ( good one for one side , bad one for another side ) as an argument in any discussion .
