  capitalism is bad , etc. , let 's burn some cars . 
  yes , kadyrov already praised the suspects in his instagram , saying that they are great patriots of russia , brave warriors , that as muslims they were shocked by the charlie 's actions and comments in support of the cartoons , of course , murder is a crime , but ... , etc , etc. 
  kadyrov was likely involved in the assassinations of 3 yamadaev brotherss ( in moscow and dubai ) , so killing nemtsov would be like a cakewalk for him . 
  yes . 
  but it has nothing to with that parade . 
  it 's not an invasion , if we just supply arms to local rebels . 
  for example , kosovo was an invasion , this parade is n't . 
   an invasion is a military offensive in which large parts of combatants of one geopolitical entity aggressively enter territory controlled by another such entity , generally with the objective of either conquering , liberating or re-establishing control or authority over a territory , forcing the partition of a country , altering the established government or gaining concessions from said government , or a combination thereof . 
  `` why russia is not america '' is a popular russian book . 
  in a nutshell : because it has a bad climate . 
  its fans were pretty annoying back in early 2000s on various internet forums . 
  sbu fucked up including a irrelevant photo in their report ( well , it 's not like anybody is claiming that ukrainian state services are extremely professional ) , but it was n't used anywhere by bellingcat , it was immediately uncovered that it was a ukrainian buk . 
  discussion of this photo : https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/01/02/did-this-ukrainian-soldier-prove-ukraine-shot-down-mh17/, 
  crackdown on free press ( and free thought in general ) in russia is very unfortunate . 
  of course , state propaganda and suppression of alternative sources helped to shape public opinion , helped to achieve cult of personality-level of putin 's gratification . 
  but other things are just make sense or inherent to russia with any government . 
  russians hated the nato invasion of kosovo even during free pro-west 1990s . 
  being wary of pro-west `` democrats '' makes sense after their catastrophic performance in 1990s . 
   russians to go around reddit , the guardian , facebook and twitter  i 'm sure all the downvotes will convince people that the guardian and wikipedia are not to be trusted . 
  except reddit is not mentioned in your sources . 
  anyway , all of these articles discuss the very same `` agency of internet research '' from olgino/savushkino/st . 
  it was explored back and forth already , and no link to reddit was found -- and they mostly work in the russian web . 
  according to various sources , it has from 100 to 600 trolls , while it 's not small , it 's just ridiculous to assume that every pro-russian comment on a random web site was done by a paid shill . 
  you should understand that russia has 100 million internet population ( 6th largest in the world ) . 
  and most of them support putin . 
  ukrainian intelligence ( gur mo ) is well known for its made-up propaganda news . 
  what the point to send russian soldiers to lnr/dnr now ? 
  they have enough local forces , it 's all quiet on donbass . 
  your xenophobia is much better than their homophobia , i see . 
  ohchr report does n't give much insight into the structure of casualties : http://www.ohchr.org/documents/countries/ua/ukraine_13th_hrmmu_report_3march2016.pdf , but they mention that 235 civilians were killed between february 2015 and february 2016 , 2/3 civilians were killed by ieds and explosive remnants of war ( erw ) in november-february . 
  according to [ the list in the ukrainian wikipedia ] ( https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%92%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b8_%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%bb%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b8%d1%85_%d1%81%d1%82%d1%80%d1%83%d0%ba%d1%82%d1%83%d1%80_%d0%b2%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%81%d0%bb%d1%96%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%ba_%d1%80%d0%be%d1%81%d1%96%d0%b9%d1%81%d1%8c%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%be_%d0%b2%d1%82%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b3%d0%bd%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%bd%d1%8f_%d0%b2_%d0%a3%d0%ba%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%97%d0%bd%d1%83_%28%d0%b7_%d1%81%d1%96%d1%87%d0%bd%d1%8f_2016%29 ) , probably the best maintained list of this sort , 3198 ukrainian combatants died in this war ( it includes non-combat deaths ) . 
  sadly , the rebels do n't maintain similar lists , so it 's harder to talk about their casualties . 
  pro-ukrainians celebrated results of their offensive actions in this very area just a few days before this shelling ( for example -- [ topic 1 ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/ukraina/comments/4g95c4/\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044b_\u0430\u0442\u043e_\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438_\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u044c_\u043d\u0430\u0434_\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0439_\u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443/ ) , [ topic 2 ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/ukraina/comments/4ey1xr/\u0432\u043e\u0438\u043d\u044b_14_\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0434\u044b_\u0435\u0449\u0435_\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0436\u0435_\u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0448\u043b\u0438_\u043a_\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0443_\u0438/ ) ) . 
  ukrainian army moved their last checkpoint as far as 3 km forward along this road . 
  that 's during ceasefire and minsk-2 . 
  but when the civilians were killed there , they claim that `` separatists shell themselves '' . 
  both sides in this war strictly adhere to the rule `` if civilians were killed , that 's not us '' . 
  ... in the us . 
  that 's sad , but all of these cartoons are from 1960s and 1970s . 
  stalinism with its mass murders was officially denounced on the 20th congress of the cpsu in 1956 . 
  yes , she insulted a judge in court . 
  literally she said '' \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u044c\u044f , \u0430 \u0447\u043c\u043e '' ( `` not a judge , but a douchebag '' ) . 
  she was n't detained , she was barred from leaving . 
  the criminal action against her was started _ back in november 2015 _ , but ukrainian side did n't give a fuck and transported her across the border in diplomatic vehicles accompanied by a consul . 
  of course , it could not go on forever that way . 
  in other news -- ukraine during cease-fire shelled a checkpoint in olenivka , 4 dead , including a pregnant woman . 
  osce [ confirmed ] ( http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/236936 ) that olenivka was shelled from west-south-west . 
  ukraine is in denial , as usual , ukrainian experts hypothesize [ that the dead bodies were just dummies ] ( http://obozrevatel.com/politics/95043-mulyazhi-ili-trupyi-mashovets-rasskazal-o-provokatsii-terroristov-na-kpp-elenovka.htm ) . 
  but who cares about that , when evil russia is doing evil things again ? 
  in russia if you want to process personal biometric data , you have to get written permission of the subject + tons of other requirements . 
  also you need consent [ to use pictures of a person ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/commons:country_specific_consent_requirements#russian_federation ) . 
  see also relevant article on meduza : https://meduza.io/feature/2016/04/27/zakonna-li-tehnologiya-findface-i-kak-sebya-ot-nee-obezopasit, 
  hmm , it 's more like the author does n't understand shit about imageboards and makes silly generalizations . 
  it amazes me that it 's possible in restrictive and over-regulated russia . 
  repost a historical picture with swastika -- and you can get into trouble . 
  describe suicides or drugs in neutral way -- and your site will be blocked , even wikipedia was formally blocked for that . 
  create a service that really invades privacy of millions ordinary people violating several russian laws in process -- and nobody gives a fuck . 
   russia is not the ` largest country in the world ' ( not even close ) ; really ? 
  google `` the largest country in the world '' . 
  also russia is by far the largest european country , its european part is like 40 % of entire europe . 
   it has the 9th highest population . 
  it 's not like i claimed something else . 
  being in top 10 by population does n't look like a terrible result either . 
   it 's physical area is not relevant ; the only thing that matters is population , i see . 
  that 's why pakistan , nigeria and bangladesh are more influential countries than russia . 
  by the way , canada you mentioned is a part of g7 ( g8 ) . 
  it 's far from being an irrelevant country . 
   it has the 12th highest gdp in the world , not 5th or 6th . 
  that 's why i said gdp ( ppp ) . 
  russia is 6th by purchasing power parity-adjusted gdp . 
  there is no doubt that russian economics is far smaller than economics of the us or china . 
  but economics is not the only thing that makes country influential . 
  just a little example , look at this map : http://vincos.it/world-map-of-social-networks/ some countries are not like the other . 
  there were several independent opinion surveys by western companies : http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/20/one-year-after-russia-annexed-crimea-locals-prefer-moscow-to-kiev/, 
  it sounds funny , considering that the netherlands recognised independence of kosovo . 
  90 % + of crimean population support reunification with russia , just let it go already . 
   yet no one disputes finland 's independence . 
  probably because absolute majority of finnish population support its independence , while overwhelming majority of crimeans support reunification with russia . 
  majority of crimean population never considered themselves part of ukraine anyway . 
  ukraine is a much poorer country than russia , it did n't invest in crimea , tried to ukrainify it -- why ordinary people should have to deal with all that shit ? 
  just because some drunk soviet leaders drew some random borders that had nothing to do with interests of local population ? 
  the seized buk was destroyed , both sides knew very well that it was in irrecoverable state . 
  of course , it was a russian fault . 
  russia knew that the sky over ukraine was open for civilian planes -- and widely used by civilian planes , but sent the buk there anyway . 
  and obviously the crew was not properly trained . 
  note that the ukrainian actions were not entirely unreasonable . 
  they did n't know that there were sams capable to shot a plane at 10 km on donbass , all the ukrainian planes that were shot down before had much lower altitude . 
  yeah . 
  ukraine annulled work permit of their most popular political tv show host [ savik shuster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/savik_shuster ) today . 
  his show `` freedom of speech '' was very popular in russia ~ 10 years ago , then ntv closed it for political reasons , and then he moved to ukraine with basically the same show -- to get the same treatment . 
  it seems that russia is not going to admit any its faults . 
  bus in volnovakha -- it was a ukrainian mine . 
  shelling of kramatorsk and mariupol -- ukrainian fascists shelled themselves . 
  note that majority of russians believe in these `` official '' versions . 
  ukraine uses the same tactics exactly . 
  attack of the right sector on checkpoint in sloviansk during easter truce -- cynical russian provocation . 
  airstrike on luhansk administration -- manpad of stupid separatists homed in on an air conditioner . 
  shelling of various densely populated cities with huge civilian casualties -- terrorists shelled themselves . 
  yes , there is a nice graph http://www.rbc.ru/politics/01/07/2014/933931.shtml `` junta '' disappeared , just like ukrainian _ karateli _ were replaced with ukrainian _ siloviki _ . 
   russian state media never used such words in news ( but may be in talkshow ) .
