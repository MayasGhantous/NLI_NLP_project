  it 's not true . 
  `` junta '' was widely used in news , eg http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=1550133# , just like `` fascists '' and `` banderites '' . 
  there is a video somewhere on liveleak where azeri soldiers show off to people a head of armenian soldier like a trophy . 
  also during that short war they managed to shot and cut ears off [ of that old couple in tilash ] ( http://hetq.am/eng/news/66976/azerbaijani-soldiers-execute-elderly-armenian-couple-in-artsakh-then-cut-off-their-ears.html ) . 
   the ebu regards the romanian state as legally obliged to underwrite tvr 's debt which goes back as far as january 2007 . 
  it 's not their first stupid move in that direction . 
  their bans are extremely funny . 
  one of the first russian tv channels they banned was rbc tv , independent russian business news channel that has nothing to do with state propaganda . 
  they banned even old movies by famous ukrainian directors , because some supporting roles were performed by actors blacklisted by ukraine 20-30 years after the film release . 
  one ukrainian tv channel bought 4 seasons of russian sitcom `` kitchen '' , a blacklisted russian person appeared in _ one _ episode of the _ 5th _ season ( the season they did n't even buy ! ), 
  -- and the whole sitcom was banned . 
  and maybe the funniest shit -- french comedy movie `` la ch\u00e8vre '' from 1980s is apparently banned , because a leading role was performed by g\u00e9rard depardieu blacklisted in ukraine . 
   want to overthrow it we see how `` well '' it went in ukraine , it was a great experiment with notoriously negative results . 
  nobody here wants to turn russia into ukraine . 
  maskhadov already introduced sharia law at the time . 
  he did n't do anything against basaev even after russian request in august 1999 , he did n't even publicly condemn the basaev 's invasion of dagestan . 
  maskhadov ca n't blame anyone but himself in that situation , it 's a complete joke that some in the west are trying to paint maskhadov as some reasonable alternative ignored by russia . 
  kadyrov , who agreed to fight against basayev , khattab & co. , was welcomed by russia and immediately kicked out by maskhadov . 
  belarus has [ high tech park ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belarus_high_technologies_park ) with tax privileges , it worked pretty well . 
   when i read about ukraine in wikipedia , i see that they produce highly sophisticated goods : airplanes , trucks , satellites , even spacecrafts . 
  ukraine produced 3 new planes in 2014 , 2 in 2015 ( military + civilian ) . 
  to put this in perspective , russia produced 161 new plane in 2014 ( 124 military , 37 civilian ) , 140 military planes alone in 2015 , also 271 new helicopters in 2014 , 280 helicopters in 2015 . 
   satellites , even spacecrafts . 
  russia was the largest partner of the ukrainian space program . 
   also they have lots of it specialists . 
  it 's not that successful in it field . 
  ukraine exported $ 1.2 b of it services in 2015 ( ~ 10 % less than in 2014 ) , 4x smaller belarus -- ~ $ 800m . 
  ( [ belarus 2015 stats ] ( http://www.nbrb.by/publications/balpay/balpay2015.pdf ) , [ ukraine 2015 stats ] ( https://ukrstat.org/operativ/operativ2015/zd/ztp/ztp_r/ztp04_15_r.htm ) ) . 
  they are also planning to [ block local rfe/rl site ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/society/19/04/2016/57160cc49a7947eb633089e5 ) for wrecking :  it 's a [ wrecking ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wrecking_%28soviet_crime%29 ) service , in their publications there are justifications for subversive activities , extremism and endless discreditation of crimean authorities , incitement to ethnic hatred . 
  i am not a russian nationalist , but i 'll try . 
  probably because it did n't happen . 
  if it happened `` last week '' , why polish officials did n't protest already ? 
  so far all we have some unnamed forester interviewed by `` gazeta polska codziennie '' , low quality right-wing polish newspaper . 
  moreover , it was published on monday , but there is still no official polish reaction . 
  i found the source on twitter : https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cgweetywsaedmyq.jpg:large unnamed forester , unknown location ( `` right in a forest '' ) , unknown type of helicopters , unknown date ( `` last week '' ) . 
  yeah , sounds entirely legit . 
   and it is mainly eu funded once again , it 's not true :  in 2009 full financing of the eur 50 million plant was confirmed with the russian funds from the federal target programme to pay for the construction , installation and detailed designs , while grants from ndep ( eur 10 million ) and sida ( eur 11.5 millilon ) were assigned to the purchase of equipment . 
  in late 2009 , following the russian procurement regulations , ojsc mostostroy no 6 was selected by auction as the main contractor . 
  the construction works have been proceeding since 2010 . 
  70 % by russia , 30 % by eu . 
  you need to find some new reason to blame russia . 
   but what about russia ? 
  whatabout russian politicians ? 
  well , unlike you , i am not denying that rogozin says stupid shit all the time and looks silly . 
  i do n't blame foreign propaganda for his stupid shit . 
  it seems that omnipotent russian propaganda mind-controls your leaders to make them do silly things and look funny in the eyes of other people : * [ reuters - lithuania prepares for a feared russian invasion ] ( http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2015/03/15/lithuania-prepares-for-a-feared-russian-invasion/ ) * [ vice - lithuania thinks the russians are coming -- and it 's preparing with wargames ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/lithuania-thinks-the-russians-are-coming-and-its-preparing-with-wargames ) * [ foreign policy - lithuania to citizens : in case of russian invasion , ` do your job worse than usual ' ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/01/16/lithuania-to-citizens-in-case-of-russian-invasion-do-your-job-worse-than-usual/ ), 
  actually , the kaliningrad wastewater treatment plant was completed in 2015 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzw3zhigijg it will achieve its full capacity later this year . 
  st. petersburg treated 74 % of its wastewater in 1997 , 85 % in 2005 ( thanks to completion of [ uzos south-west wastewater treatment plant ] ( http://www.water-technology.net/projects/uzos/ ) during the putin 's second term ) , 98.4 % in 2013 . 
  according to current plans , st. petersburg will treat 100 % of its sewage in 2020 . 
   stop projecting . 
  look , russia is the largest country in the world , it has one of the strongest military in the world and it does n't hesitate to use it , it 's the 2nd largest arms exporter in the world , and it 's 5th-6th world 's economy by gdp ( ppp ) . 
  you are free to continue your `` la-la-la , i do n't hear you , russia is shit , shit '' routine , but it 's a bit silly . 
   nato and syria lol `` lol '' is almost perfect description of the us activity in syria , but i think `` lol wtf '' will be a bit better . 
   completely alienating your `` brother '' nation ukraine , which would n't have joined nato for a decade or two even without the whole crimea/eastern ukraine ordeal . 
  ukraine sought for nato member accession plan back in 2008 . 
  due to russia opposition and war on donbass the expansion was blocked . 
  there are 0 % chances that ukraine will be accepted to nato in the coming 20 years . 
   the dog barks , but the caravan goes on . 
  you have a point . 
  you can bark on russia as much as you want , but it 's not very productive . 
  you are so deep in denial it 's not even funny . 
  like it or not , russia has the 2nd strongest army in the world and largest nuke arsenal . 
  it 's not a superpower like the us , but it 's a major regional power with its own [ military alliance ctso ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collective_security_treaty_organization ) . 
   you 're disagreement boils down to crying about nato encroachment on state tv . 
  russian successful involvement in ukraine , georgia , syria never happened , it was an illusion probably . 
  continue to consume your propaganda that russia does n't matter , but your own leaders do n't believe in that anymore . 
  i see , discrimination ( against ethnic groups you do n't care about like russians ) is just human nature , but americans prefer genocide . 
  nice to know new bits about western democracy . 
  better for you ? 
  no , thanks , motion denied . 
  we never doubted it for a second . 
  that 's why we need strong army . 
   in the end , russia does the same things that they accuse the us of doing sure , we are the same , both russia and the us use the same double standards , and blame their opponents for their own sins . 
  of course , russia is much weaker , poorer , and much less influential than the us . 
   no proof of this , i assume you are referring to ukraine . 
  there were [ truckloads of color revolutions already ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colour_revolution ) , it 's not just euromaidan . 
  i doubt the us directly financed euromaidan ( there were enough of local oligarchs to do that ) , however , it financed plenty of pro-maidan ngos through usaid and it openly sponsors post-maidan pro-west government . 
   crimea was a sham vote . 
  i dont care if they want to be part of russia , hold a real vote and i would respect it . 
  are elections some kind of religious ritual for you ? 
  no less than 80 % of crimean population support reunification with russia -- that 's according to various western polls ( e.g. 
  [ gfk ] ( http://imgur.com/a/rm5aa ) , [ gallup ] ( http://www.bbg.gov/wp-content/media/2014/06/ukraine-slide-deck.pdf ) , [ pew research ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/08/despite-concerns-about-governance-ukrainians-want-to-remain-one-country/ ) ) . 
  certainly there were voting irregularities on the 2014 crimean referendum , but there is no doubt in its outcome -- overwhelming majority of crimean population supported reunification with russia . 
   all of the other countries barely exist due to russian kindness , they are not friends or allies . 
  lol . 
  belarus has ~ 2x gdp ( ppp ) per capita of pro-western ukraine or pro-western moldova , kazakhstan has ~ 3x gdp . 
  `` barely exist '' . 
   no one has this right . 
  all of our allies are voluntary allies and have the right to leave whenever they want . 
  yeah ... 
  but for some reason , when yanukovich decided to join our customs union , the us supported anti-government pro-western riots in ukraine in response . 
  the eu also forced ukraine to decline russian proposal , [ spiegel ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/war-in-ukraine-a-result-of-misunderstandings-between-europe-and-russia-a-1004706.html ) : `` the kremlin then proposed to brussels that negotiations be conducted between the eu and the eurasion union -- directly between the two blocs of power . 
  but european commission president jos\u00e9 manuel barroso refused to meet with the leaders of the eurasion union , a bloc he considered to be an eu competitor . 
  `` one country can not at the same time be a member of a customs union and be in a deep common free-trade area with the european union , ''  they fucked over azerbaijan and armernia at the end of the soviet union , started civil wars in ukraine and georgia . 
  looks like russia is some kind of evil demiurge for you . 
  ethnic conflicts are nothing special during country dissolution , see yugoslavia . 
  it 's just silly to blame russia for that . 
  it was n't russia who invented '' [ georgia for gergians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgia_for_georgians ) '' slogan and it was n't russia who started ethnic tensions in georgia . 
  maybe russia was partially guilty in the nagorno-karabakh conflict , i am not denying it , but russia also helped to stop it . 
  in ukraine the west supported the takeover of pro-western nationalist majority that tried to ignore opinion of pro-russian minority -- and it did n't go well .
