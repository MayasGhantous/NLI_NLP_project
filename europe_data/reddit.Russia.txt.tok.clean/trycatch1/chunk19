   thats why all these nations come to us and not you . 
  all the nations ? 
  belarus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan ( you had military base there and even declared it `` a zone of our strategic interests '' , but not anymore ) , people in crimea , tajikistan , armenia , syria seem to be pretty satisfied with russia . 
   russia has no right to a sphere of influence . 
  sure , because a guy from the us said so . 
  only the us has this right . 
   russia is responsible for destabilizing the region . 
  what region ? 
  the most fucked up region in the world nowadays is mena , and the us was far more deeply involved there than russia . 
   russia has no automatic right to a `` sphere of influence '' `` rights '' is a tricky thing . 
  for example , the us apparently has right to kill random people all over the world . 
  nato has right to invade serbia without un permission and later recognize part of serbia as independent country . 
  nato has right to invade iraq without un permission . 
  us has rights to arm weird bearded guys in syria , who fight against legitimate government . 
  us has right to support and finance colour revolutions all over the world . 
  but it seems that for some reason russia has no similar rights . 
   there 's no such thing . 
  well , when independent cuba tried to host russian missiles on its territory , the united states was a bit upset if i remember correctly . 
   it 's time to let go . 
  sure , the us considers the whole world is its own backyard . 
  too bad that russia disagrees . 
   no one wants to be a part of this backyard the funniest thing that you really believe in your own propaganda . 
  realistically , if you are hostile to russia , you have no reason to expect friendly gestures from russia . 
  we remember about the [ bronze night ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bronze_night ) , nazi parades in tallin and discrimination of russian minority very well . 
  feel free to blame somebody else for your own fuckups . 
   according to a 2008 survey of 500 ethnic russians conducted by the eu fundamental rights agency , 59 % of those questioned characterized ethnic discrimination as very or fairly widespread in the country . 
  27 % claimed they had experienced discrimination based on their ethnic origin in the past 5 years , including 17 % during the past 12 months ( compared to 4 -- 5 % in lithuania and latvia . ), 
  discrimination at workplace was characterized as widespread , with 72 % of poll participants saying that a different ethnic background would be hindering to advancement . 
  39 % said they had experienced discrimination during the past 5 years when looking for work , including 16 % during the past 12 months -- the highest rate in all the countries surveyed . 
  10 % confirmed that they avoid certain places , such as shops or caf\u00e9s because they believed they would receive bad treatment due to their ethnic background . 
  russia actively participated in a lot of wars : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_russia#russian_federation_.281991.e2.80.93present.29 russia really needs strong military , it uses it a lot . 
  poland on the other hand barely uses its army anywhere , it only had minor troop deployments in iraq and afghanistan since 1990 . 
  nato creeps into our backyard and meddles with out sphere of interests again , again and again . 
  nato expansion eastwards , kosovo , iraq , georgia , libya , ukraine , syria . 
  we tried to be friends with nato pretty hard in 1990s-early 2000s , but enough is enough . 
  there is nothing paranoid in that , russia have to protect its interests . 
  russia is not going to invade poland anyway . 
  cold war is long time over . 
  if you want to waste money on your outdated paranoid fears , you may as well spend money on anti-ufo shields . 
  rbc is the 4th largest internet-company in russia and it has its own tv channel . 
  it 's their second take . 
  russian press wrote almost exactly the same thing 2 years ago about the similar encounter ( russian official newspaper rg : [ april 2014 ] ( http://rg.ru/2014/04/30/reb-site.html ) vs [ april 2016 ] ( http://rg.ru/2016/04/14/rossijskie-voennye-samolety-opiat-napugali-ekipazh-esminca-vms-ssha.html ) ) -- `` donald cook '' was frightened by our su-24 , frightened american servicemen resigned , etc. 
  of course , patriotic folks in the comments celebrate , wonder if the american mariners changed their diapers ( standard joke in every comment section ) , and giggle about rabbit-hearted americans . 
  low intensity war is still ongoing ( maybe 3-5 killed per day on both sides ) . 
  russia sponsors dpr/lpr budget , so we sorta already help them . 
  they are able to do some limited restoration and construction work . 
  for example from the top of my mind , they rebuilt a destroyed bridge in horlivka and finished construction of new apartment complex in debaltsevo . 
  ukraine has come full circle . 
  groysman is an ex-mayor of vinnytsia , poroshenko 's home region ( e.g. 
  [ random article from 2012 ] ( http://prokuratura.org.ua/?p=7838 ) -- `` groysman , poroshenko 's protege , set a record of corruption in 2012 '' ) . 
  it seems that they kicked out natalie jaresko , the last minister that had any value , other ones like aivaras abromavi\u010dius were removed a bit earlier this year . 
  eu/us are stupid if they are going to support this circus . 
  ukraine supported georgia , several presidents visited tbilisi during the 8/8/8 war including yushenko , it was widely publicized and ridiculed . 
  but the main reason of the jump was 2009 gas conflict . 
  it 's interesting that [ attitudes of ukrainians to russia ] ( http://www.levada.ru/cp/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/otnoshenie-k-stranam.png ) barely changed during that timeframe ( solid line ) , while russian attitude to ukraine dropped significantly ( dotted line ) . 
  the idea that ukraine steals gas was promoted so widely that it reached even cartoons for little kids : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnflnb_pije ( luntik and his friends build cherry pipeline , but worms start to steal their cherries ) . 
  why ? 
  there were polls and stuff , we do n't have to guess . 
  by far the main reason for voting no was ( [ link ] ( http://en.reporter-ua.ru/the-referendum-in-the-netherlands-will-not-affect-the-provisional-application-of-the-agreement-eu-ukraine-said-in-brussels.html ) )  59 % -- i do n't believe ukraine , in particular due to the fact that there is a lot of corruption ; which is entirely sensible point . 
   having one of the largest amounts of natural riches in the world you boast about having 3x times gdp ( ppp ) of ukraine which has almost none ? 
  well , belarus has no russian resources , but it still has 2x of your gdp per capita . 
  russia exports not just natural resources , but far more arms , more manufactured goods , more software and it services than ukraine per capita . 
  by the way , it takes some nerve to say that ukraine has almost none natural resources , while metal is its largest export article . 
   it takes special kind of talent to keep russia , the country with so much potential , in a state of backwards shithole , where many people if russia is a backwards shithole , why millions of your compatriots migrate to work in russia ? 
   still do n't have access to civilization 's bare necessities . 
  sure , we throw poop out of the window and eat hedgehogs . 
  or maybe you just consume ukrainian media a bit too much . 
   will do whatever he wants , he will steal any number of billions , send you to any number of random wars , appoint his dog as a successor , are you describing ukraine ? 
  i noticed that ukrainians love to project their bad experiences on russia . 
  street raids to catch people and send them to a war happened recently in ukraine , not in russia . 
  while poroshenko did n't appoint his dog as a successor , but he brought his own son to the parliament , and he even claimed that his son was a war veteran ( which he was n't ) . 
  on a more general note , so far ex-ussr democracies with exception of baltic states ( ukraine , georgia , moldova , kyrgyzstan ) do n't demonstrate performance significantly better than authoritarian countries around . 
  or even demonstrate performance significantly worse than similar countries ( ukraine ) . 
   \\ - enjoy the fun while it lasts . 
  scary . 
  soon , very soon . 
  for real , you ca n't seriously appeal to the future as an argument . 
  yeah . 
  my country `` the way it is '' has [ 3x gdp ( ppp ) per capita of your country ] ( https://www.google.ru/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ukr:blr:geo:lva:rus:kaz&amp;ifdim=region&amp;ind=false ) , so we are probably doing something right , while you are doing something wrong . 
  it 's also pretty telling that you ca n't answer even the easiest questions . 
   yanukovich had to go . 
  why ? 
  because bunch of violent guys ( including a lot of nazis and other weirdos ) supported by bunch of oligarchs like poroshenko decided it ? 
  euromaidan ** was never supported ** by majority of ukrainian population , see [ polls during euromaidan ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%95%d0%b2%d1%80%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%b9%d0%b4%d0%b0%d0%bd#.d0.9e.d1.82.d0.bd.d0.be.d1.88.d0.b5.d0.bd.d0.b8.d0.b5_.d0.bd.d0.b0.d1.81.d0.b5.d0.bb.d0.b5.d0.bd.d0.b8.d1.8f_.d0.a3.d0.ba.d1.80.d0.b0.d0.b8.d0.bd.d1.8b_.d0.ba_.d1.81.d0.be.d0.b1.d1.8b.d1.82.d0.b8.d1.8f.d0.bc ) . 
  if yanukovich was so terrible , well , the planned elections were scheduled on march 2015 . 
  but what about putin ? 
  what about russia ? 
  23 % of nagorno-karabakh autonomous oblast population in 1979 were azerbaijanis . 
  they were expelled . 
  not only that , the armenians took control [ over other territories around the nkao ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian-controlled_territories_surrounding_nagorno-karabakh ) that were never part of the nkao in the first place . 
  population of agdam in 1989 -- 28,031 , population of agdam in 2010 -- ~ 360 . 
  is n't it nice ? 
  i am not going to defend azerbaijanian bs , but let 's not pretend that armenians are warm and fuzzy in this conflict . 
  it seems that the principle `` you break it you buy it '' does n't work in the eu international politics . 
   russia  isis nice comparison you made , and of course you consider _ other _ people brainwashed and influenced by garbage propaganda . 
  and then you will blame russian minority for not trusting your government and not giving a fuck about your country . 
  why ? 
  there are educated people in syria as well . 
  i 'm proud of our propaganda machine . 
  there is nothing wrong with it -- every nation is trying to shape international public opinion using various methods .
