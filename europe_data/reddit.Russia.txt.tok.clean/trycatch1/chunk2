  the wife of one of the troopers started to pretend that her husband is alive , mourning post in her vk was replaced with post claiming that he is alive and well , nameplates on the graves were removed , journalists trying to visit the cemetery were attacked . 
  article about it reuters : http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/08/28/uk-ukraine-crisis-russia-graves-idukkbn0gs17v20140828, 
  according to the rumors i heard , ukraine needs these tanks to fulfill its export contracts -- modernized t-72s for african countries . 
  ukraine has some amount of t-72s stockpiled , but most of them are in poor state , many already contracted to other countries , and it 's cheaper to buy and modernize relatively modern t-72m1 abroad than repair and modernize various older modifications of t-72 ukraine has . 
  ukrainian forces already [ captured non-damaged t-72b3 ] ( http://otvaga2004.mybb.ru/viewtopic.php?id=912&amp;p=34#p418111 ) , it 's the newest russian modification of t-72 from 2011 . 
  ~ 2000 ( assuming 1:5 killed/wounded ratio ) killed russian regular soldiers ? 
  that 's absolutely impossible , total bs . 
  the [ list in ukrainian wikipedia ] ( http://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%93%d1%80%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%b4%d1%8f%d0%bd%d0%b8_%d0%a0%d0%be%d1%81%d1%96%d0%b9%d1%81%d1%8c%d0%ba%d0%be%d1%97_%d0%a4%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%86%d1%96%d1%97,_%d1%89%d0%be_%d0%b7%d0%b0%d0%b3%d0%b8%d0%bd%d1%83%d0%bb%d0%b8_%d0%b2%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%81%d0%bb%d1%96%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%ba_%d1%80%d0%be%d1%81%d1%96%d0%b9%d1%81%d1%8c%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%be_%d0%b2%d1%82%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b3%d0%bd%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%bd%d1%8f_%d0%b2_%d0%a3%d0%ba%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%97%d0%bd%d1%83_%282014%29 ) includes around ~ 100 names of killed russian citizens -- that 's including volunteers , not confirmed kills , persons who fought for ukraine , etc. , not just russian regular army soldiers . 
  the real numbers can be different , but not 10x . 
  casualties that high would be noted much earlier , each chechen war had ~ 5000 killed russian soldiers . 
  no , no , no !, 
  no proof anymore , the signs with names [ were already removed ] ( http://tvrain.ru/articles/snjali_tablichki_s_imenami_s_mogil_pskovskih_desantnikov-374615/ ) from the graves . 
  whoosh , it was a close one . 
  not the worst parallel universe to open gates from . 
  imagine , for example , cacodemons and cyberdemons spawning on donbass . 
  not sure , if it would be much worse than it is , however . 
  the lies around the situation with russian troopers killed on august 19 under luhansk are even more crazy . 
  ua forces destroyed russian convoy somewhere under georgievka/lutuhino and captured two bmd-2 with documents from military unit 74268 ( pskov oblast ) , including a list of the names . 
  armchair warriors soon found numerous social profiles in vk of the persons from the list -- they really were troopers from pskov , and many of them disappeared from the web since august 15-16 . 
  wife of leonid ( one the found persons ) wrote on vk that her husband was killed in ukraine and that he will be buried on monday ( yesterday ) . 
  one of the friends of leonid in vk posted mourning words about him . 
  however , strange things started to happen soon . 
  the wife removed all posts about his death , and posted new status claiming that `` her husband is alive and well , celebrating name day of my daughter '' . 
  mourning status of one of leonid 's friends disappeared , too . 
  journalists called to the phone number in leonid 's wife profile , she confirmed that he is ok , and even passed the phone to a man , who said that he is leonid , and has no idea about rumors about his death . 
  journalists of several russian independent outlets ( yes , there is such thing ) visited the cemetery where leonid supposed to be buried , and found his fresh grave , indicating that he indeed died on august 19 . 
  edit : pps . 
  oh , it gets even weirder . 
  now they attacked the car of tv rain and russian planet journalists [ who arrived at the cemetery in pskov ] ( https://twitter.com/tvrain/status/504274205916282880 ) . 
  the journalists managed to abandon the car and escape . 
  no , for me that 's enough to call these strikes ( like in grozny ) indiscriminate \\* . 
  i talked about responsibility -- shitty hrw report failed to prove that the ua army was responsible for them . 
  -- \\* they were not `` indiscriminate '' however -- the terrorists specifically target residential areas without any military object around . 
  civilians is the target for them . 
  because france , greece , and poland were occupied by germany ? 
   russia does it to the separatists in chechnya chechen `` separatists '' intentionally committed `` criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public '' against russian civilians , hence they are terrorists . 
   israel does it to hamas hamas militants intentionally commit `` criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public '' against israeli civilians , hence they are terrorists . 
   west does it to the separatists in ukraine `` separatists '' in ukraine intentionally commit `` criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public '' against ukrainian civilians , hence they are terrorists . 
  it 's just not unusual that conflicts are asymmetric -- governments fight against terrorists , or against groups that use terrorist tactics . 
  _ terrorists _ shell civilian areas , not the ua army . 
  and please , stop using straw man -- of course , it _ do happen _ that ua army non-intentionally kill civilians -- when they miss their target , or have wrong intelligence , or attack targets close to civilians . 
  it also _ do happen _ that the `` rebels '' miss their legitimate military targets , have wrong intelligence , etc. , and non-intentionally kill civilians . 
  but first and foremost people in donetsk and other cities have to sleep in shelters thanks to the terrorists who intentionally and willfully shell residential areas without any legitimate military target around . 
  yepp , again shitty hrw report without any proof that ua army was responsible for these attacks whatsoever . 
  you are wrong . 
  i upvoted aschebescher 's comment , and i refer to the terrorists on donbass as `` terrorists '' . 
  interesting thing that ukrainian roofer mustang wanted already admitted that he did that and published photo proof . 
  arrested people seem to be unrelated to the flag story . 
  mustang wanted is a pretty cool guy btw : http://imgur.com/a/qjck5, 
  luhansk is mostly blocked by the ua forces , but there are still some unblocked ho chi minh trails . 
  notably , unsurfaced road through nikolaevka that was used this time , and used few days ago by convoy with tanks and apcs . 
  probably ua forces have at least some fire control over this road , but in this case they were able to _ destroy _ convoy , not to block it . 
  goods that you bring for you own `` personal use '' are not under putin 's embargo . 
  so it 's nice for [ shuttle trading ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shuttle_trading ) . 
  on the finnish border each person can take 50kg for `` personal use '' , so merchants pay to old ladies to cross the border with them , _ kilomummot _ as the finns call them . 
  i hope putin & co. will not cut this channel , because thanks to shuttle merchants , i have fresh finnish cheese in the fridge in st. petersburg . 
  i have no idea what the hell you are talking about . 
  that 's likely produced by `` santa bremor '' , belorussian food company . 
  they buy raw seafoods , process it , enough to claim belarus as their place of origin , then export . 
   the underlying conflict is n't addressed at all . 
  sure , putin still will be alive , and there still will be tons of weapons hidden somewhere . 
  there is already some `` ongoing insurgent activity '' -- lviv mayor 's home was shelled with rpg , kremenchuk 's mayor was assassinated , terrorist groups in kharkiv and zaporozhie attacked various object ( some of these groups were caught ) . 
  but in ukraine with real borders , with uplifted police , with stronger government , with stronger army it will be much harder to successfully significantly destabilize situation . 
  of course it will be over . 
  it 's already over in the places liberated by the ukrainian army . 
  in krasny liman , mariupol , sloviansk , kramatorsk , druzhkivka , konstantinovka , artemovsk , rubezhnoe , severodonetsk , lysychansk , etc. 
  people live their normal lives , not being afraid to be spread over asphalt thinly by grad , or killed by some weirdo with ak , businesses , services , transportation start to work again . 
  during 1 month after the liberation only two severe crimes were registered in sloviansk -- 1 murder and 1 robbery ( the murder suspect was already caught ) . 
  there was no `` coup '' in the first place . 
  there is no perfect neither imperfect encirclement , at the very least ua should take krasny luch or shakhtarsk to claim any encirclement . 
  it does n't matter what strelkov says . 
  in mid-june ( after ua forces took control over yampol ) he claimed that he was finally encircled in sloviansk . 
  a week later he received tanks ( tanks !, 
  super noisy devices ) without much problems . 
  looks like it was mostly shelled from the positions of separatists , when ua forces retook savur-mohyla already . 
  note the directions of the holes , they look at the north . 
  3d panorama of the memorial on savur-mohyla : http://turist.dn.ua/3d-panorama/tour-saur-mogila.html for snizhne this memorial was an important landmark , was like eiffel tower for paris , the statue of liberty for nyc , alexander column for st. petersburg . 
  except all these cities have tons of other landmarks , while for snizhne ( provincial industrial soviet town with only plants , mines , plants , mines around ) it was the _ only _ landmark . 
  of course i do n't know ideas of the ukrainian command , but it looks too optimistic . 
  donetsk is not even properly encircled yet . 
  there are plenty of settlements around donetsk that are still not under control of ua forces . 
  on the north yasinovataya is still under control of separatists , on the east -- basically everything , khartzysk , shakhtarsk , etc. , on the south-east -- ilovaysk ( there was a notoriously unsuccessful attack on it yesterday by `` donbass '' , `` azov '' , `` shakhtarsk '' battalions ) . 
  just getting closer to donetsk could take weeks . 
  it 's a fake . 
  usa sanctions against are russia are not anywhere that strong as against iran , syria , sudan , cuba or north korea . 
  the most severe sanctions against russia currently are the sanctions introduced by russia . 
  out consumer protection gets better and better every day . 
  it 's not yet china-level consumer protection , but it 's getting there . 
  we are already protected from the right sector , pornhub , ukrainian news sites , local opposition news sites , and numerous random sites that occasionally have the same ip as dangerous stuff people should be protected from . 
  1 ) / u/mkvgtired did n't say anything about motive 2 ) motive is something not trivial to establish , especially if the murderer was not found . 
  [ only 46 homicides ] ( http://journalists-in-russia.org/jir/journalists/index/incident:homicide/impunity:trial,%20conviction ) out of 184 resulted in `` trial , conviction '' . 
  and it 's very likely the death of kuashev will never reach that result . 
  of course , nobody is seeking asylum , they are repeating bs from russia media . 
  context of the story : in the early june ukrainian commanders decided to close the border with russia that was almost completely open in luhansk and donetsk oblasts . 
  at the time it was a sensible operation , separatists did n't even had tanks back then . 
  during ~ 12-20 june 72th , 79th , 24th brigades managed to close most of the border . 
  while they never were able to close the border completely , while they practically operated in the rear of the enemy , they were not at serious danger . 
  things radically changed in the early july . 
  several things happened : 1 ) strelkov & co. left sloviansk on july 5 , moved his forces closer to the border , and started offensive close to border . 
  2 ) russia started to shot down planes used by ukraine to deliver supplies to the encircled forces ( see an-26 shot down at july 14 ) , so the only safe supply channel was cut down .
