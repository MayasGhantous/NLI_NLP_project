  for better or worse , russia can do it , just like certain european countries can do it with kosovo , or turkey with cyprus , or israel with surrounding countries . 
  ukraine - 8,666 ( 2014 , world bank gdp per capita $ ppp ) russia - 25,636 ( 3x ukraine ) italy - 34,706 ( 1.4 x russia ) but you will likely ignore any numbers that do n't fit your world view . 
  tatars , azerbaijanis , kazakhs or kyrgyzs are muslim too , but they are fine . 
  truly moderate islam can be peaceful and compatible with modern world . 
  sure . 
  i would not blame would they decide to join a more developed country . 
  it 's against russian interests though , so russia would not allow it . 
  _ crimean _ sanctions were extremely light , just a set of few personal restrictions . 
  significant sanctions were introduced in response to _ donbas _ escalation . 
  and of course , there is a very good reason to stop these sanctions , because [ the eu loses 0.4-0 .7 % gdp ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/regdata/etudes/brie/2015/569020/eprs_bri%282015%29569020_en.pdf ) thanks to them and russian response sanctions . 
  note , however , that i did n't say that _ russian _ actions were sensible -- it 's a tough question , i did n't support it and still do n't support . 
  but the decision of _ crimean _ population to join russia was entirely sensible and rational . 
  not only it is n't relevant to crimea , it is n't even true . 
  check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita for example , yugoslavia was not `` occupied '' in any sense of this word and its countries ( with exception of slovenia ) have lower gdp . 
  and even if you are going to compare russia with developed european countries , the gap is smaller that the gap between ukraine and russia . 
  russia has 2.5x-3x higher gdp ( ppp ) per capita than ukraine . 
  what do you expect ? 
  it 's hard to call it `` occupation '' , considering that majority of , like , every single social , geographical or ethnic group ( including [ ukrainians of crimea ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/20/one-year-after-russia-annexed-crimea-locals-prefer-moscow-to-kiev/#2d540bd95951 ) ) of crimea supports joining russia , often overwhelmingly . 
  yes . 
  these surveys are true , they were done by multiple different pollers , including western ones . 
  and why should be they not satisfied ? 
  russia pouring a lot of money into crimea . 
   and i 'm betting the ethnic tatars do n't feel the same way . 
  crimean tatars are a bit different , but [ according to the recent survey ] ( https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/articles/2015/12/22/621984-krimskie-tatari-ne-zametili-polozhitelnih-izmenenii-posle-vhozhdeniya-krima-sostav-rossii ) , 21 % crimean tatars still report positive changes in their life after the unification , 15 % -- negative changes , 60 % -- no change . 
  it 's not bad . 
  putting it in context , [ 55 % of russians ] ( http://www.aif.ru/society/bolshinstvo_rossiyan_otmetili_uhudshenie_urovnya_zhizni_v_strane_v_2015_godu ) and [ 87 % of ukrainians notice ] ( http://nv.ua/ukraine/politics/okolo-treti-ukraintsev-nazvali-jatsenjuka-vinovnikom-uhudshenija-urovnja-zhizni-opros-103607.html ) negative changes in their quality of life , just 3 % both in russia and ukraine report positive changes . 
  contrast it with `` suffering '' crimean tatars . 
   putin or anyone should n't be invading sovereign countries in the 21st century . 
  ok , but what 's done is done . 
  crimean people made the right choice . 
  despite the sanctions , failing oil prices , cutting electricity and water by ukraine and so on -- surveys report that people notice improvements in their life . 
  they selected not only culturally closer , but much better developed country in almost every measurable sense . 
  human right violations are a sad thing , but they do happen in the rest of russia ( and in many other countries ) as well . 
  why is it a `` questionable unreliable source '' ? 
  rbth is a project of the russian official newspaper . 
  and it 's not a new trend that alcohol and tobacco consumption in russia reduces , while life expectancy grows . 
  they count as `` mutilation '' under various female genital mutilation laws . 
  it is n't true . 
  there are very different procedures under `` fgm '' umbrella term from extreme to even less intrusive than male circumcision ( see wikipedia for classification ) , to the point that even doctors ca n't tell if any procedure was performed at all , [ e.g. 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/13/female-genital-mutilation-trial-young-girl-convinced-jury-australia ) :  km said she simply `` touched '' the genitals of the girls in a `` symbolic '' part of the ceremony . 
  the prosecution argued the girls had been cut and a medical examination by a doctor could not determine what happened either way , though type one or type four fgm was not ruled out . 
  but abbreviations like that exist in other languages as well . 
  he named igor kononenko , mp from poroshenko bloc , sometimes called `` grey cardinal '' of the poroshenko bloc . 
  kononenko lobbied his man on position of general director of state-owned enterprise ukrkhimtransammiak . 
  it was the last straw when porshenko 's administration asked aivarus to take kononenko 's person as his assistant . 
  common term in the us and so on . 
  it 's not called `` rape '' in other countries , neither in legalese nor in informal language between people . 
  for example , in russian `` rape '' is '' \u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 '' ( root word `` violence '' ) , while statutory rape is '' \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 '' or '' \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 '' ( root word `` filth '' ) . 
  it 's perfectly fine to comment on issues anonymously or pseudonymously . 
  it is n't even anything new , various writers/poets/publicists published their controversial opinions anonymously or pseudonymously since ancient history , since forever . 
  twitter is also different from national newspaper , because you have control over your twitter account . 
  you can delete twits , rename or delete your account . 
  majority of twits are not indexed by google , also twitter is n't archived by the internet archive . 
  you do n't have similar control over a newspaper . 
  check [ this answer on thequestion ] ( http://thequestion.ru/questions/53236/byl-li-genocid-russkogo-i-drugih-narodov-v-chechne-i-kakie-etomu-est-dokazatelstva ) , it 's pretty objective i think -- even russian anti-government anti-war activists witnessed ethnic cleansings of russians in chechnya . 
  also see [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pccpyr4en90 ) for some testimonies of the victims , e.g. 
  on 4:50 interview with 13 yo girl who was gang-raped by chechens . 
  you ca n't just sweep this under the rug as propaganda . 
  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-20/nabiullina-sees-no-risks-to-financial-stability-after-ruble-rout  `` we 'll intervene only if we see risks to financial stability , '' nabiullina said in an interview wednesday in moscow on the sidelines of a small-business forum . 
  `` there are n't such risks now . '' analytics i read also think that the cb would not intervene , unless something will happen . 
  it seems they just use flat european price . 
  it just does n't make any sense , it seems they lack any interest and commitment in these new markets . 
  the lack of russian translation says it all . 
  opened the netflix site that was `` launched '' in russia . 
  everything in english , prices in euro ( 10 euro/month is reasonable , but not cheap , there are similar cheaper offerings around ) , i have to subscribe to see their collection , and is there even a client for rpi 2 ? 
  closed netflix site . 
  well , i see absolutely zero appeal and zero reason to use something like that , quite frankly . 
  i believe the logic is different in this one . 
  it 's not allowed to distribute photographs of copyrighted sculpture in a public place in the us , there is an exception only for photographs of architecture . 
  however , the little mermaid sculpture was published before 1923 , therefore it 's in public domain in the us -- there are some nuances , but i think wikimedia 's communities analyzed them . 
  it 's relevant because it 's a deal with the very same russia . 
  medinsky ( russian minister of culture ) even proposed to break all ties with [ international organization of turkic culture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_organization_of_turkic_culture ) . 
  turkey did n't close its russian centres afaik . 
  by the way , turkey never signed [ protocol i to the geneva conventions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protocol_i ) that outlaws attacks on parachuting pilots . 
  it went to `` ridiculous '' stage when they closed [ russo-turkish scientific centre of the all-russia state library for foreign literature ] ( http://rtnauka.ru/ ) , [ centre of turkey study of the kazan federal university ] ( http://www.interfax.ru/russia/483228 ) , and [ various other ] ( http://saratovdaily.ru/news/2015/12/04/18115:sgu_prinyal_reshenie_zakrit_centr_tureckogo_yazika_i_kulturi.html ) turkish language and culture centres . 
  yes , you backstabbed ukraine and other eastern european countries . 
   but the current situation and past events show that ukraine is everything but a reliable transit country why ? 
  ukraine transited russian gas to europe without interruption even during the war with said russia . 
   ( if only by the fact that russia is playing with them ) putin bullies neighboring countries using gas as an instrument for his geopolitics . 
  but worry not , germany has a solution . 
  let 's give putin more gas instruments to bully its neighbors !, 
  ( undercutting ukraine by some billions of dollars it gets from transit in process , hitting its economic stability even further ) . 
   highly volatile political region except it 's russia makes that region highly volatile . 
  it happened during short war of dagestan ( 1999 ) , when islamist basaev and hattab groups invaded dagestan . 
  1 week after start of that war yeltsin sacked pm stepashin , replacing him with putin . 
  you know the rest . 
  personally , i think that in 1999 the situation went to the point when realistically there was no other solution except military one . 
  the first chechen war ( 1994-1996 ) is a different story , however . 
  dudaev was negotiable , it was a mistake to assassinate him , the whole war was a huge miscalculation . 
  the thing was n't penetrated , and according to its spec it should survive 1000g shocks . 
  still it 's a pretty big fuck-up and example of poor engineering . 
  the box itself was n't significantly damaged , the pcbs inside fared well too , but the chips just disintegrated into fine powder . 
  http://imgur.com/a/2eng4 it even aroused conspiracy theories that the chips were intentionally destroyed . 
  clearly it was the intention of the lawmaker , at first they even talked about banning models with bmi < 18 . 
  also , banning and alienating `` unhealthy '' people ( who are unhealthy due to their genetics , not their behaviour ) is not any better . 
  this is discrimination of thin people . 
  not all thin people are anorexic , do they understand that people have different genetic and so on ? 
  i agree with you . 
  he was driving dangerously , he switched from the leftmost to rightmost lane ( the lane that was ending , there was no legitimate reason to move into it ) for the only reason to frighten away people . 
  it 's a shame that your unpopular , but entirely valid opinion was downvoted .
