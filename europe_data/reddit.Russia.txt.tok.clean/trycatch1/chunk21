  the article you linked to has nothing to do with the topic , because the us is not a party of the rome statute . 
  but priority of constitution over international law is nothing unusual , you are right .

  also good news http://www.communia-association.org/2015/12/04/1761/ , while not exactly relevant . 
  photographs of public-domain 2d art are no longer considered copyrighted in the uk . 
  few years ago there was buzz around and accusations about wikipedia `` stealing '' photographs of 2d art from the british library and other british museums . 
  so this loophole to recopyright public domain content was removed -- in the uk . 
   south ossetia and the whole georgian soldiers shooting up the civilian city , then driving through it screaming racial slurs and demanding that women and children come out of the basements since they in there and kill them in their rush for the gori tunnel were a good example . 
  [ ... ] and georgians are more than happy to slaughter all ossetians , who are distinctly different from them in both ethnicity and religion . 
  the amount of nuclear idiocy per word in your post is just amazing . 
  i wonder where you got all that bullshit ? 
  if you are not a mind reader you should probably try to read these little black thingies . 
   the weaponry alone does n't win a war . 
  i do n't see anyone claiming the opposite . 
   ukraine 's military is alone on this one and they already failed even with western support . 
  ukraine did n't receive any serious western backing in that war . 
  neither financial nor military , even the sanctions on russia were pretty light . 
  no lethal weapons , no anti-tank missiles , even non-lethal supplies as radars were very limited . 
  it 's funny that `` moderate opposition '' in syria ( the one that was elected by nobody , is in alliance with al-qaeda and installs sharia law in every city it captures ) received far more western military aid in syria than ukrainian legitimately elected government . 
   yes , they could win , at the cost of a terrible bloodbath 9000 dead is not terrible bloodbath enough ? 
  ukraine can win this war . 
  of course , with serious domestic commitment and western backing ( money , lethal weapons , and so on ) . 
  putin is not suicidal , he will not escalate forever in a conflict that does n't bring anything valuable to russia . 
  russian military is strong , but it 's far from a magic unicorn that can destroy its enemies just looking at them . 
   there are in fact very few states around the world that qualify as stable liberal democracies . 
  [ ... ] if nothing else , europe 's refugee/migrant crisis points to a long-lasting east-west values gap when it comes to tolerance and diversity . 
  i am sorry to interject this guy , but being a liberal democracy has nothing to do with western european weird ideas about tolerance and diversity -- like covering-up rape in fear of being called racist . 
  putin handled the kursk disaster poorly , and major tv channels ort ( controlled by oligarch berezovsky ) and especially ntv ( controlled by gusinsky ) were very harsh in pointing out deficiencies of his handling . 
  he learned his lesson and took control over both of them in a few months . 
  they represent majority of the syrian opposition , on the north of syria , at least . 
  if the `` rebels '' ( in their current form ) will prevail and assad will be toppled , these groups will not be just included in government , they will be the government . 
  with sharia , public executions for weird reasons , women rolled up in fabric head-to-toe , oppression of minorities , and other cool stuff . 
  that 's what already happened on the territories they control , e.g. 
  yeah , it will be better than the isis , it will be more like `` just '' taliban , but it will be hardly any better than assad regime . 
   from all the syrian opposition groups in saudi arabia that 's already hilarious . 
   groups like al-nusra are excluded . 
  al-nusra was excluded , and that 's all . 
  they included other salafi jihadist groups like jaysh al-islam and ahrar al-sham . 
  even without clicking on the article i can guess the user in question . 
  it was long , long overdue . 
  unauthorized one-person protests are legal in russia , you do n't need permission for them . 
  so at first he was detained several times for unauthorized protests while most of them were one-person , _ then _ got 15 days arrest in january for one-person protest , and _ then _ he got 3 years in prison for repeated violation . 
  that 's a pretty crazy sentence for this harmless guy for staying with posters like `` je suis charlie '' and `` freedom to savchenko '' . 
  he is a closeted gay most likely . 
  everybody suspected he is not straight seeing him once -- his voice , mannerisms , he hosted gardening tv show , and so on . 
  he used his position to promote gay rights previously , protested against gay propaganda laws , said things like `` it 's ok to be gay '' . 
  it was writing on the wall . 
   have declared al-nusra enemies of the rebellion and attack them as well do they even have line of contact with al-nusra ? 
  anyway , i do n't believe that russia considers them terrorists or ever called them terrorists . 
  they expressed willingness to participate in dialogue with russia , while russia is ready to negotiate with `` healthy opposition '' . 
  it 's true that there were some bombing by russia in daraa province , but ** absolute majority ** of russian airstrikes were targeted at the northern islamist rebel groups allied with al-nusra & co. . maps of the russian airstrikes by the isw have whooping total of 2 ( two ) russian airstrikes recorded in the southern front controlled territory , see [ sept 30 - oct 28 ] ( http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/russian%20airstrikes%2028%20oct-01_5.jpg ) , [ oct 27 - nov 5 ] ( http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/russian%20airstrikes%2004%20-%2005%20nov%20updated-01_6.png ) , just like [ any ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/world/middleeast/syria-and-russia-continue-coordinated-assault-on-militants.html?_r=0 ) [ other ] ( http://theaviationist.com/2015/10/02/heres-an-interactive-map-of-all-the-russian-airstrikes-in-syria/ ) [ available ] ( http://www.vox.com/2015/10/7/9471271/russia-syria-bombing-map ) [ map ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34465425 ) . 
  yeah , because russia does n't do this . 
  russia never labeled like that the kurds , the only significant truly moderate opposition force in syria . 
  hopefully , the usa will stop to drink that `` moderate rebels '' and `` moderate fsa '' koolaid . 
  i read yesterday one pro-fsa guy , who unironically defended al-nusra as `` moderate wing of al-qaeda '' , fsa supporters with straight face use phrases like `` moderate islamists '' , `` very conservative groups '' ( ahrar ) , and so on . 
  if a group wants to be considered moderate , at the very least they should distance themselves from known jihadist groups . 
  good luck to sdf , hopefully , _ this _ project will be successful . 
  good . 
  that 's what russia is already doing . 
  russia bombs the isis , ahrar ash-sham , al-nusra , jaysh al-islam , other islamist groups and their allies . 
  russia does n't bomb the sdf and kurds , afaik . 
  they knew it very well . 
  that 's why they did n't shoot down russian planes in the previous airspace violation incidents , acting via diplomatic instruments . 
  oh these fairy tales about that invisible moderate army again . 
  too bad russia does n't believe in these dangerous bullshit delusions that led to the current catastrophic mess . 
  it seem the us also does n't really believe in them , too . 
  russia does n't bomb the real moderates , ypg . 
   yes , there are 70,000 moderate opposition fighters in syria . 
  here 's what we know about them faylaq al-sham ( sham legion ) , part of jaf , apparently is a moderate opposition group now , just like ajnad al-sham islamic union . 
  you ca n't make that shit up . 
  these guys are really desperate in searching `` moderate '' opposition . 
  it 's not like they were able to identify journalists on atgm range . 
  they just fired at groups of people . 
  these moderates work in tight cooperation with not so moderate al-nusra front and ahrar ash-sham , designated terrorist organizations . 
  they do things like capturing syrian pows and then handing them over to the less `` moderate '' guys , letting them do the dirty job for them . 
  just today one of the oldest `` moderate '' fsa brigades [ joined ahrar ash-sham ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3ug8iy/one_of_the_oldest_fsa_groups_alfateh_brigade_who/ ) . 
  assad is not a good guy , that 's for sure , but at the very least he is able to maintain somewhat semi-competent secular state in his country -- unlike these moderate guys . 
  that 's simple -- if you hear the war drums , your blood boils , and you start to support your leader even if you do n't particularly like him . 
  in russia there are also plenty of anti-putin people who started to talk about constantinople , recognition of the armenian genocide and so on . 
   futhermore , there was nothing `` clearly non-intentional '' about the violation at the time it happened . 
  you should just look at the map , the border has a twist there . 
  warplanes travel at ludicrous speeds , they ca n't immediately change their direction , and the russian planes worked at targets close to the border . 
  `` a short-term border violation can never be a pretext for an attack '' , as erdogan said after shooting down of the turkish f-4 . 
  of course , there was nothing threatening in the actions of our planes . 
  moreover , most likely they were shot at when they started to leave the turkish airspace . 
   two unidentified fighter i do n't buy the turkish bullshit that they did n't know it was a russian plane . 
  for example the syrian planes do n't operate in pairs . 
  they knew exactly what they were going to do . 
   at the time two unidentified fighter jets had disregarded all instructions to change their course and had failed to identify themselves despite multiple attempts to contact them . 
  those actions do fit the profile of possible hostiles they probably did n't listen that frequency . 
  just like the iran air flight 655 for example . 
  it was also `` warned multiple times '' -- too bad the crew did n't hear a single warning . 
   here 's a simple , common sense preventive measure : russia should simply stop with their airspace violations . 
  sure , the russian planes will be very careful avoiding entering the turkish airspace . 
  just like the turkish planes will be _ very careful _ not to violate the syrian airspace inside of s-400 's operational range . 
  i see nothing good happening with turkish proxies fighting in syria as well . 
  such is life . 
  erdogan shot himself in the foot . 
  they decided to shoot down our plane for clearly non-intentional 10s minor incursion into their airspace , the plane that did n't pose for them any danger . 
  then their so called `` turkmen '' proxies killed our parachuting pilot in violation of protocol i of the geneva conventions and then posed with his dead body .
