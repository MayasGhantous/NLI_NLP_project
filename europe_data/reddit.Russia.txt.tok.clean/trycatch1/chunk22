  that 's all insane wtf-tier actions , they forgot that russia is not syria , that russia is not a nation that can be easily bullied in that way -- so they should pay for their actions , that 's important to prevent repetition of incidents like that in the future . 
  because it 's silly to shoot ourselves in the foot . 
   unfitting they are absolutely right . 
  our response is clearly inadequate , if they _ still _ did n't apologize . 
  we also should seek measures harming turkey alone , instead of measures that will hit both nations -- like cutting economic ties , stopping joint projects and so on . 
  oh , i read that / po / thread , where that picture was created . 
  it 's hilarious they took a picture from imageboards , but it 's mostly a fuckup of [ fars news ] ( http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940903000799 ) , while tv zvezda also fucked up identifying fars news as western media . 
  i see nothing wrong with that , there are similar posts all around the world . 
  i read a nigerian forum yesterday ( topic about terrorist act by bh in yola , killing 31 ) , and there were similar reactions . 
  laughing off the polish leaders as clowns , or backward idiots ( i saw these comparisons higher in this thread ) , or whatever else does n't look very sensible , if they are making more responsible decisions for their country and their citizens in the long term . 
  call the poland leaders idiots or clowns as you like . 
  but poland does n't have terrorist attacks on their territory , see : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:terrorism_in_poland, 
  i ca n't find any relevant clause in the echr , though . 
  i actually wonder about this . 
  france signed , but did n't ratify [ european convention on nationality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_convention_on_nationality ) . 
  it also signed but did n't ratify [ un convention on the reduction of statelessness ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/convention_on_the_reduction_of_statelessness ) . 
  i do n't remember the reddit alien being site-wide replaced after a321 terrorist attack , or recent turkey terrorist attack , or hajj stampede . 
  they pointed areas of possible launch location as calculated by three different groups of experts . 
  the areas are well consistent with everything we already knew , for example , with bellingcat investigation , and contradicts with recent claims by almaz-antey that the buk missile was launched from zaroschenskoe . 
  yes , these are worldwide deaths , sorry , i did n't make it more clear , but i talked about them from the start . 
  yes , i think the us responsible , at least partially . 
  the us has enough resources to enforce world 's peace , and it 's deeply involved in politics almost anywhere in the world -- from financing various groups to direct boots-on-ground military operations . 
  it 's not a coincidence that wars in africa ended during bush 's presidency . 
  he actually put effort in unfucking africa . 
  it 's not a coincidence that the middle east turned into complete mess during obama 's presidency . 
  about clinton ? 
  according to the same source , bush years saw significantly less battle deaths than in clinton 's period . 
  http://www.hsrgroup.org/our-work/security-stats/state-based-battle-deaths-region.aspx total death toll in 1993-2000 : 10.9 m , total death toll in 2001-2007 ( they have no info on 2008 ) -- 0.9 m. 
  subsaharan africa , europe and central & south asia were major contributors in 1993-2000 : https://imgur.com/wykc69o, 
  there were huge wars in africa in 1990s . 
  the same source has data per region : http://www.hsrgroup.org/our-work/security-stats/state-based-battle-deaths-region.aspx, 
  it does n't exclude civil wars , i particularly talked [ about this graph ] ( http://ourworldindata.org/data/war-peace/war-and-peace-after-1945/#rate-of-battle-deaths-in-state-based-armed-conflicts-by-type-of-conflict-1946-2013-max-roserref ) . 
  i think this one is the most ridiculous out of all . 
  because other ones at least did something to qualify , while obama did nothing at all at the time of awarding . 
  he received it just for rhetoric , or `` not being george bush '' . 
  what amuses me -- that number of [ battle deaths actually increased ] ( http://ourworldindata.org/data/war-peace/war-and-peace-after-1945/ ) since obama assumed the presidency , while bush years were the most peaceful in 70 years . 
  so much for `` idiot warmonger '' narrative . 
  which i would not even bother to cite to one more pro-russian denialist . 
  go to / r/syriancivilwar , check submissions . 
  why the hell it has `` misleading '' tag ? 
  nope , because it 's confirmed from independent sources . 
   will not deal with the oversupply issue at all . 
  what is capitalism ? 
  no , kremlin did n't initiate maidan . 
  that 's true . 
  sova center ( russian ngo specialiasing nationalism/xenophoby ) notice that nationalistic forces in russia are weaker than ever . 
  in their report on first half of 2016 [ `` evolution and devolution '' ] ( http://www.sova-center.ru/racism-xenophobia/publications/2016/07/d35018/ ) ( in russian ) they note continous decay of nationalistic organizations . 
  their stats of hate attacks in russia : http://imgur.com/a/4tdja \u0423 - killed , \u0420 - beaten or wounded . 
  in 2008 they registered 114 hate-motivated murders . 
  in the first half of 2016 - 1 , and even this only murder was an example of anti-lgbt hatred , not xenophobia . 
  first 3 rows - blacks , people from central asia , people from caucacus . 
  note the drastic decrease in numbers , and in the structure of hate-crimes anti-lgbt violence is higher than hate-crimes against migrants !, 
  bessarabia - you mean part of russian empire that you annexed 22 years before ? 
  the annexation that was never recognised by the soviet union ? 
  yeah , that was a good reason enough to become the largest hitler 's ally on the eastern frontier , invade soviet union , annex more soviet territory , participate in holocaust , kill jews , commit odessa massacre and numerous other massacres . 
  you literally tried to win the race for the title of the best hitler 's lapdog . 
  too bad that it did n't go well and your ass was kicked so well that you are still whining . 
  the world is so unfair ; _ ;  we and the finns tried to keep out of it and got done with real fucking savage . 
  nationalist delusions are usually hilarious , but comparison of finland with romania is something on its own level . 
  you are confusing facts with your imagination . 
  well , let 's hope he is truthful , the big bosses will agree on something and this stupid confrontation between russia and the us will finally end . 
  i am sure there are enough space on the earth for both countries to get along , this silly cosplay of the cold war gets really old . 
  hopefully , it will be easier to reach mutually-beneficial agreement with a businessman than with ideologically driven american establishment . 
  obama started well with the reset too , sadly the relations deteriorated later . 
  it would be great if trump will base his policy on american interests first . 
  i have great expectations for the future . 
  today is a good day . 
   trump cooperation with russia , endangering the future of peace in europe ( destabilisation of western alliance ) that 's upside down . 
  cooperation with russia does n't endanger peace . 
  attempts to isolate and marginalise russia , attempts to start new cold war , desire to maintain us world domination , readiness to escalate military confrontation against russia -- that 's what endangering the future of peace . 
  no-fly zone in syria - [ what the hell , really ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-syria-no-fly-zone-third-debate_us_58084280e4b0180a36e91a53 ) :  clinton did not directly answer how she would react if a russian plane breached a no-fly zone established by the u.s. interventionist war-hawk american president like hillary or bush could be plain dangerous . 
  hopefully , trump will bring sanity back in american foreign policy . 
  hurray , hurray , hurray !, 
  while i am sure that trump is not a pro-russian president like american propaganda trying to paint him , fuck `` we came , we saw , he died '' hillary . 
  there was no good candidate , but there was a terrible one . 
  it was worrying to see american presidential candidate that based good part of her campaign on cold war rhetorics and straight up russophobia . 
  yes , that 's russophobia when you are playing on irrational anti-russian fears . 
  hopefully , it will tone down anti-russian hysteria a bit , and the us will act in _ american _ interests , not in spite of russian interests . 
  and it 's fair . 
  hillary did n't deserve to win . 
  she has no personality and she had an awful campaign . 
  trump is literally hitler !, 
  pepe the frog is hitler too !, 
  we searched for `` tramp '' in russian register of companies , trump has 200 companies in russia !, 
  just recall 2008 obama 's campaign and compare it with this . 
  trump 's campaign was spectacular . 
  it 's so amusing that you ignored direct question `` so what 's the problem here ? '', 
  and started to run with argumentum ad whataboutismum instead . 
  no other arguments are needed when you noticed that a russian compares russians actions with american . 
  word `` whataboutism '' ( link to the wiki if you are not lazy ) is everything you need . 
  misdirection from what ? 
  yes , russia used private contractors ( mercenaries ) against isis in palmyra . 
  it was reported in detail [ by fontanka back in march ] ( http://www.fontanka.ru/2016/03/28/171/ ) , half-year ago ( everything , including the name of killed maxim kalganov ) -- reuters is just making rounds with an old story , knowing about short memory of its readership . 
  russian forces are openly and legally deployed in syria . 
  using private contractors is neither illegal nor unusual . 
  these people were neither conscripts nor children , they were not forced , they were adults who willfully consented to this affair . 
  i fail to see anything wrong with it . 
  russia is a fascist state , because of some stupid _ letter _ ? 
  that would be funny , if it would not be so sad . 
  ok , that 's / r/europe after all .
