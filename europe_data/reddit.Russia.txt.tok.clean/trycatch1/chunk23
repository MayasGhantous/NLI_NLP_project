  read the resulting document signed by putin , it contains nothing of this http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/files/41d526a877638a8730eb.pdf ( [ english version ] ( http://en.ipravo.info/russia1/legal73/927.htm ) )  v. principles of the state cultural policy  the principles of the state cultural policy are :  * territorial and social equality of citizens , including citizens with limited opportunities of health , in implementations of the right to access to cultural values , participation in cultural life and use of culture of the organizations ;  * ** openness and interaction with other people and cultures ** , idea of domestic culture as about the integral part of world culture ; compliance of the economic , technology and structural decisions made at the state level , to the purposes and problems of the state cultural policy ;  * ** freedom of creativity and non-interference of the state to creative activity ; **  * delegation by the state of part of powers on management of the sphere of culture to public institutes . 
  it does n't contain any reference to `` alien values '' , `` multiculturalism '' or `` pseudo-art '' at all , but instead claims that `` the multinationality , multi-confessionality russia developed and develops as the country integrating two worlds - the east and the west '' . 
  the text contains some ( many ) annoying fragments and overall looks unnecessary , but it has nothing as outrageous as the cited fragments of the letter . 
  annoying parts :  to possible manifestations of this crisis treat the most dangerous to the future of russia : ... deformation of historical memory , negative assessment of the considerable periods of national history , distribution of false idea of historical backwardness of russia ;, 
  soviet union was the first country in the world that had `` positive discrimination '' ( affirmative action ) policies for national minorities . 
  russian language -- hmm , do you think that soviet union had to invent new language as common standard , just not to look nationalist for harsh western critics ? 
  language is not just a fancy cultural thing , it 's a tool for communication . 
   but , let 's wait and see . 
  sure . 
  let 's wait and look at the slow evolution of the naysayers : \\ - it will never be done !, 
  it ca n't be done !, 
  \\ - okay , maybe it will be done , but out of schedule . 
  and a lot of money will be stolen !, 
  \\ - okay , it 's done in schedule and in budget ... but it will collapse after the first ice drift !, 
  \\ - ... \\ - who cares about stupid bridge !, 
  what contradiction do you see here ? 
  ukrainian authorities were not aware about this meeting , and the russian side of course knew position of maidan government beforehand . 
  russian intervention started only at february 27 , when russian special forces took over governmental buildings in crimea . 
  well , comparison of abkhazia/south ossetia/tskhinvali region/georgia to finland would be even more silly . 
   if the well-being of the russian people was a top priority for the russian government perhaps the russian people would be well off . 
  thanks for worrying about our well-being , but we are fine . 
  it 's much better than in 1990s , when our leaders were the best buddies of the west . 
  i am mocking absurdly stupid comparison between crimea and finland . 
  the usa invaded iraq . 
  how would you like such logic ? 
  anybody with an ounce of reason will say it 's plain idiocy and would be right . 
  but due to massive propaganda , people really believe in equally idiotic statement about russia . 
  do you realise that absolute majority of crimeans does n't consider reuinification with russian `` invasion '' at all ? 
  they would look at you like you are crazy , if you 'll start to talk about `` invasions '' . 
  in their opinion , it was just free expression of people 's choice -- protected by russia , but thats ' all . 
  crimea always was a special case . 
  crimea always was massively pro-russian and never really considered itself part of ukraine . 
  there was crimean referendum of 1994 , where the crimeans overwhelmingly voted for greater autonomy and dual russian-ukrainian citizenship -- referendum that was ignored by ukraine . 
  check the article '' [ sevastopol is not ukraine ] ( http://blogs.pravda.com.ua/authors/nayem/4adc22c19f1b6/ ) '' from 2009 by mustafa nayyem , no less ( pro-ukrainian journalist and activist , his in - / famous facebook post started euromaidan ) . 
  he openly writes that ukrainians are considered occupants in sevastopol , ukrainian flag -- dirty rag , kiev 's representative -- worst scum . 
  he writes that the city is called ukrainian for the only reason it was placed in geographical borders of ukraine . 
  and now somebody compares it with finland . 
  country almost without of russians . 
  independent from russia for 100 years . 
  independence of which was recognised and respected even by the soviet union . 
  but russia is going to invade it now , because ... because it 's evil . 
  that 's just , clinical idiocy , i dunno . 
  amazingly idiotic fearmongering even for this sub . 
  crimea had 90 + % of pro-russian population , and ~ 60 + % of people self-indentified as russians . 
  so far finland has 1.3 % russians . 
  aaaaaa !, 
  russians are coming !, 
  russians are coming !, 
  footnote . 
  when it will be done -- just in projected time in december 2018 , or maybe few months later if the constructors will fuck up , current bad-mouthers will be nowhere to be found . 
  :d so far the construction goes ahead of schedule . 
  current state : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lep8pvjaxge, 
  it 's a myth . 
  post-maidan government had intention to kick russian fleet out of crimea far before the crimean takeover . 
  check this article : http://www.rbc.ru/newspaper/2014/02/26/56bf55a59a7947299f72d4ee that 's not pro-putin media , rbc is a quality independent business newspaper . 
  26 february 2014 , before any events in crimea . 
  title : `` fleet , go away !, 
  new ukrainian government will want to denounce agreement on the black sea fleet '' . 
  it was the position of both the fatherland and svoboda -- only parties that were represented in post-maidan government . 
  sergey sobolev ( the fatherland ) , 26 february :  100 dollar discounts on gas do n't compensate the [ thing ] that was signed by yanukovich in kharkiv . 
  moreover , it 's not a discount , but basically transfered money to pay for lease of the black sea fleet after 2017 . 
  we pursue the goal - up to 2017 the lease exist , because it was signed in compliance with current constitution , after 2017 - it does n't comply with the constitution . 
  lol , they even had site http://flot2017.com/ ( online since 2008 ) . 
  it 's still up and has countdown to the presumed fleet withdrawal , with hilarious flash video . 
  currently it 's 208 days to go . 
   even if they had to have paid more for the rent , it certainly would have been cheaper than having a war . 
  that 's not about money . 
  crimeans are russians , they never wanted to have anything to do with ukraine , and they had no obligation whatsoever to the illegal government proclaimed by western-backed coup . 
  2 millions returned back to home . 
  this guy got 2.5 years of prison time for entirely nothing . 
  he several times `` violated '' protest rules as an individual protester , which is just an administrative offensive . 
  i put `` violated '' into quotes , because it 's doubtful he violated anything in the first place , individual protests do n't require permission in russia . 
  but if you violate protest rules more than twice in 180 days , it 's a crime according to new insane law . 
  that 's some non-sequitur . 
  actually , according to russian nuclear doctrine , nuclear weapons can be used only in defensive scenarios , 1 ) in response to enemy 's nuclear strike or 2 ) in case of enemy aggression against russia with non-nuclear weapons , but only in case when the very existence of russia is threatened . 
  so yeah , if norway is going to participate in nato 's all-around aggression on russia , it will be a nuclear target . 
  it proves yet again that russia is the evil aggressor . 
  somehow . 
  not that i am surprised with such amazing conclusion of the best / r/europe-an analysts . 
  it 's raining , therefore russia is the aggressor . 
  sure , if their intention was to be laughed on and look like idiots . 
  indeed , crimea never was ukrainian . 
   because we are not stupid ?!, 
  hmm . 
  no , you should try to find another reason . 
  tell that bs to somebody else . 
  the whole rada is nationalist , including `` pro-western '' parties like samopomich . 
  the only exception is opposition bloc & co.  in your own fucking country neo-nazis and banderites do n't rally in the streets of russian cities . 
  there is no neo-nazi regiment armed with tanks in russia . 
  russia has no memorials to nazi collaborators and does n't use slogan `` russland uber alles '' on their official logos . 
  there is article 282 that criminalizes hate speech against all ethnicities in russia . 
   if the rest of the world behaved like russia it should have been bombed already . 
  no , it would not . 
  you still do n't get it . 
  russia acts rationally , while ukraine acts against their own interests , often in the most possibly stupid way . 
  that 's why ukraine is such a laughing stock in the outside world . 
   i will be rude that 's fine . 
  maybe being rude and drawing `` le epic trolling '' logos will alleviate your phantom pains . 
  being rude is better than leveling civilians . 
   ... and thats exactly why people are affraid of russia .
