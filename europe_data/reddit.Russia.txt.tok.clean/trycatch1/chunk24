  why ? 
  because ukrainian nationalists who took control over ukraine behave like idiots ? 
   this is insane . 
  it seems you like to speak enigmatically . 
  what exactly is insane ? 
  freedom is slavery . 
  force is weakness . 
   the end is near for russia :d, 
   unfair and disproportionate of you the word you are trying to find is `` pathetic '' . 
  ok , russia is bad , evil , annexed part of their territory . 
  did they declare war on russia ? 
  no , they did n't . 
  did they at least severe diplomatic ties with russia ? 
  no , they did n't . 
  instead they cut electricity to their `` occupied '' crimean fellow citizens and adopt stupid logos for themselves `` to troll russia '' . 
  it will show 'em . 
  yeah . 
  russia is not outraged . 
  we just laugh on this retarded shit . 
  ukraine proves itself the best sitcom again . 
  wtf , seriously ? 
  what else country in the world place another country on their official logos ? 
  they continue to define themselves as anti-russians . 
  `` russia says it 's stupid ? 
  go with it !, 
  it must be good ! '', 
  good thing about it that crimeans dodged this bullet . 
   rsfsr constitution gives the right itself . 
  the relevant part : http://constitution.garant.ru/history/ussr-rsfsr/1978/red_1978/5478721/chapter/8/ rsfsr had right of secession from the soviet union , chechen-ingush autonomous soviet socialist republic did n't . 
  so far both serbian and russian sides are denying that any russian were expelled . 
  well , it 's right in this article . 
  same 0.1 % of russian total . 
  try to read the comment i am responding to . 
  right , but the recent talks about evacuation from the eastern aleppo were specifically about al-nusra : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/06/un-diplomat-offers-to-personally-escort-900-al-qaeda-fighters-ou/, 
  well , ukrainians always claimed that it 's not a civil war , but russian aggression . 
  they are denying the fact that most of the people they fight against are locals from donbass , their own fellow citizens . 
  and this time they were right , in the battle of ilovaysk they encountered units of regular russian army , for one of the first times . 
  you can discuss the subject . 
  you ca n't insult polish nation , though . 
  feels bad , man . 
   article 133 whoever publicly insults the republic or the polish nation , punishable by imprisonment of up to 3 years however , it 's probably not very smart to shit on the country you are living in . 
  and at some point the polish authorities were fed up with gross 's western anti-polish propaganda . 
  you are partially right , chechnya is not the poorest region of russia , crimea and sevastopol are poorer : https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0421\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043e\u043a_\u0441\u0443\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432_\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439_\u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438_\u043f\u043e_\u0412\u0420\u041f_\u043d\u0430_\u0434\u0443\u0448\u0443_\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f at least they were poorer in 2014 . 
  other north caucasian republics are better though -- with exception of ingushetia that 's more or less on the same level as chechnya . 
  `` oil-rich '' chechnya is 24th region of russia by the scale of oil extraction , 18th by gas extraction ( 2010 ) . 
  in 2014 526,6 m tonnes of oil were extracted in russia , 447k tonnes of oil were extracted in chechnya , that 's 0.08 % out of total russian output . 
  it 's just so poor and underdeveloped ( chechnya is the poorest region of russia ) that even relatively small industry can drive their economics . 
  it seems you are deep in denial . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chechen_republic_of_ichkeria#1996.e2.80.931999  president maskhadov started a major campaign against hostage-takers , and on 25 october 1998 , shadid bargishev , chechnya 's top anti-kidnapping official , was killed in a remote controlled car bombing . 
  bargishev 's colleagues then insisted they would not be intimidated by the attack and would go ahead with their offensive . 
  other anti-kidnapping officials blamed the attack on bargishev 's recent success in securing the release of several hostages , including 24 russian soldiers and an english couple . 
  [ 23 ] maskhadov blamed the rash of abductions in chechnya on unidentified `` outside forces '' and their chechen henchmen , allegedly those who joined pro-moscow forces during the second war . 
  [ 24 ]  some of the kidnapped ( most of whom were non-chechens ) were sold into indentured servitude to chechen families . 
  they were openly called slaves and had to endure starvation , beating , and often maiming . 
  [ 13 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] public executions in butiful free democratic country that do n't need no russians : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_ufj2udsa4, 
   islamist rebels interesting way to spell al-nusra . 
  except this is bullshit invented by ukraine to excuse their catastrophic losses , and demonize russians once again . 
  russian side was ready to agree on safe passage only for _ disarmed _ soldiers without vehicles , this condition was unacceptable for ukrainian side -- that 's according to muzhenko , ukrainian chief of the general staff . 
  so there was no deal . 
  in the end they decided to fight their way out of the pocket . 
  there is a video recorded by ukrainian soldier with order of general khomchak `` go ahead fighting !, 
  go ahead fighting ! '' . 
  see http://twower.livejournal.com/2019774.html ( google translate should be good enough ) for several _ ukrainian _ sources that confirm it was a forceful breakthrough . 
  ok , it 's faulty logic , it was sorta self-fulfilling prophecy , considering that external threat usually fuels nationalism . 
  but the assumption that russia had nothing to worry about is even more faulty , considering all russian fears were proven true . 
  these nazis were not created by russia . 
  they existed on maidan and for years before maidan . 
  it 's also true that crimeans were attacked by ukrainian nationalists before any russian intervention , that ukraine already tried to conduct its ukrainization policy in entirely russian-speaking crimea that never was ukrainian . 
  russian intervention just sped up already existing tendencies . 
   annexed their territory reunified \\* . 
  russia let crimeans to return to russia ( country they saw as their home ) from ukraine ( country they considered hostile to them and felt no connection to it whatsoever ) . 
  i think it 's great , fans of democracy should be happy about it . 
  3rd photo is from a movie about wwii . 
   they ( be it kremlin or the victims of its propaganda ) indeed are ready to kill and destroy just to prove themselves that they exist . 
  unfortunately to their victims , this whole `` battle '' exists only in russia 's sick imagination . 
  man , what the hell are you smoking ? 
  it seems they managed to transmit `` the internal hysteria '' right in your head . 
   russia gets hacked you immediately feel this top-notch journalism that differentiates american independent media from russian state propaganda . 
  so what are these putin aide 's secrets ? 
   there is a list of casualties in the donbass region of ukraine sent from a high-ranking separatist official ... separatists sent a list of their bi-weekly casualties to surkov . 
  awesome . 
  10/10 secret . 
   and a list of candidates for office in a sham election . 
  one email notes that the individuals with asterisks next to their name were `` checked by us '' and are `` especially recommended . '', 
  marshal group/malofeev sent to surkov list of recommended candidates with asterisks . 
  amazing . 
  not only this , meduza [ looked into the leaks ] ( https://meduza.io/feature/2016/10/26/hakery-opublikovali-perepisku-vladislava-surkova-falshivuyu-i-nastoyaschuyu ) and found that they confirm that surkov is likely the author behind pseudonym `` natan dubovitsky '' , but it was always known anyway . 
  so what 's next ? 
  nothing . 
  these are all the revealed `` secrets '' . 
  putin is on his knees , crying -- russia got hacked . 
  not even estonian newspapers ? 
  only dreams ? 
  :( feels bad , man . 
  of course , it 's not like you need any source to say stupid shit about russia . 
  wikimedia foundation has its bias , but it very rarely intervenes in internal affairs of local projects . 
  both members of arbcoms ( top conflict resolution body in big wiki-projects ) and admins of projects are elected democratically by ordinary editors . 
  of course , abuse of power and power grabs do happen , but it 's inherent to any society . 
  in the end russian wikipedia has pro-russian bias , ukrainian is pro-ukrainian and english is pro-western , so it seems that the wmf pretty well fulfill their role of neutral janitors . 
  it 's a necessity .
