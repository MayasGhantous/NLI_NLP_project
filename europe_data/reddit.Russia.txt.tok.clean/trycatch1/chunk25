  in a large open wiki you absolutely need effective measures against spam and vandalism , some structure in the community , some conflict resolution process . 
  you do n't see a lot of vandalism in wikipedia exactly for the reason it get ( generally ) quickly reverted . 
   it 's far from being `` free '' as in `` freedom '' . 
  wikipedia is free as in freedom , because it 's distributed under an open-source license . 
  there is no other meaning in this phrase . 
  curiouser and curiouser . 
  propaganda did n't change since 2014 , economy is [ returning to growth ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/economics/25/10/2016/580f731d9a7947d745bc3549 ) . 
  nothing changed in the last year significantly enough to explain two diametrically opposite opinions . 
   and stop bringing up the 90s like it 's giving putin 's regime an excuse to do what they are doing . 
  i do n't excuse anybody . 
  i reacted to your very strange panegyric to 1990s in the first place . 
  keep these slogans and cliches for an anti-putin demonstration . 
  so what happened with small businesses of your relatives destroyed by `` siloviki '' ? 
  were they legal ? 
  did they even exist ? 
  small legal businesses ? 
  closed by `` siloviki '' ? 
  well , anything is possible , but my bet on your good imagination . 
   no it 's not . 
  and the situation is getting worse economically and politically . 
  are you several different persons ? 
  `` life in russia is 100 times better then it was in 90s and it still gets better every year . '', 
   ministry of economics has prognosed 20 years of stagnation . 
  we are in the 90s again . 
  you either was too young in 1990s to remember them or just tend to absurdly exaggerate the things . 
  the ministry prognosed slow growth ( slower than world 's average -- that 's the problem ) , while in 1990s russian economy was in recession every year , except 1996 . 
   the collapse went surprisingly quiet . 
   subsequent construction of capitalism on the ruins of failed communism was also relatively ok .  everyone had options at every level . 
  free market gave opportunities . 
  0_0 sorry , i do n't usually do this , but i decided to click on your profile , considering the weird stuff you talking here . 
  [ ctrl-f 90s ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/36mfzn/russian_nationalists_set_sights_on_region_of/crg1f6x/?context=2 ) :  oneimage -4 points 1 year ago   are you telling me russia is not run by oligarchs and corruption which is robbing the country blind ? 
  such a shit country . 
   you 're intoxicated with hate and propaganda . 
   new streets of my town are cleaned with mercedes trucks , there are new houses , shops and cars everywhere . 
  policemen are nice and free medicine modernises . 
   life in russia is 100 times better then it was in 90s and it still gets better every year . 
  you just have no idea what are you talking about living in a stupid echo chamber constructed by your media . 
   oneimage -4 points 1 year ago   why does putin keep such a tight grip on the media  because he does n't want international agents to effect russian media field . 
  in the 90s our american friendly media was showing russian army in bad light , and actual terrorists that were building literally an islamic state ( imarat kavkaz ) as pure freedom fighters . 
  so i completely agree with you , it 's 100x better currently than in 1990s , and some tighter grip on media was necessary ( but not as tight as today , when media was turned into low-quality propaganda machine ! ) . 
  and this your post i consider as some sort of parody . 
  it seems that it just does n't pay off to say something good about russia in / r/europe . 
   you ca n't mean / r/russia , since 90 % of them are n't russians i am not a fan of them , but they are russians . 
  you are just delusional -- not that it 's unexpected for a poster of / r/europe russophobic circlejerk . 
  absolute majority of russians dislike [ both eu and the us ] ( http://www.levada.ru/2016/10/19/mezhdunarodnye-otnosheniya-3/ ) ( 60 % and 70 % respectively ) . 
  russia is threatening the west with nuclear war ? 
  did you read it in estonian newspapers ? 
   i can see the propaganda you 're pushing : so far i am just pointing to low-quality propaganda in the economist . 
   `` their independent journalism is as good as our state propaganda your `` independent journalism '' is just garbage for idiots . 
   the only thing russia cares about is sending a message to the west that `` sovereignty '' ( even of a dictatorship ) should mean an unlimited license for the government to do as they please within their national borders ; including deliberately bombing hospitals and indiscriminately dropping chlorine gas and barrel bombs on civilians . 
  nice . 
  cnn or guardian would be proud of this tirade . 
  while assad is indeed a brutal dictator , al-qaeda or sunni islamist rebels are much worser alternatives , as was already convincingly demonstrated by any territory they control -- e.g. 
  eastern aleppo or idlib . 
  and yes , syria is a sovereign country , and the west should remove its dirty hands from there . 
  and it will , no matter how much the western moderate terrorist supporters would cry and whine . 
   that is the fault of ... hungary ? 
  macedonia ? 
  oh no , wait , i know ... it must be the dreadful americans !, 
  most certainly it was n't a fault of putin . 
  it was a fault of yeltsin 's regime that was completely supported by the west at the time . 
  and that 's exactly the reason why was this discussion omitted . 
   did it make the humanitarian situation better ? 
  sure , it did . 
  ask people who live in damascus -- they are not shelled by the western-backed jihadists anymore . 
  however , it seems you have some reading comprehension problems . 
  the economist claimed that russian involvement made humanitarian situation ** far worse ** . 
  it 's obvious bullshit . 
   oh wait , i see , you 're claiming that russia cares deeply about the syrians ... more than the us and the eu with their pet jihadists -- that 's for sure . 
   but while it 's critical of the current russian regime , it 's not a state-run disinformation outlet , any more than anyone supporting the current russian regime is rt. 
  yes , it 's a private-run disinformation outlet that supports american regime . 
  russian soldiers who were killed by the rebels had relatives too . 
  i understand that hungary has different historical memory , and that 's normal . 
  edit : sorry about your father and fuck commies of course . 
  right , during gorbachev 's anti-alcohol campaign of 1985-1987 , life expectancy jumped by 2.5 years to 70 years ( russia reached this level again only in 2010s ) , birth rate raised , crime rate fell , homicide rate dropped by 1/4 to 6.3 per 100.000 ( russia _ still _ is far from achieving this level again ) . 
  [ some graphs in wikipedia ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%90%d0%bd%d1%82%d0%b8%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%be%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b5_%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%bc%d0%bf%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b8_%d0%b2_%d0%a1%d0%a1%d0%a1%d0%a0#.d0.a0.d0.b5.d0.b7.d1.83.d0.bb.d1.8c.d1.82.d0.b0.d1.82.d1.8b ) . 
  according to some estimates , it saved 1.4 m lives . 
   the economist to the trash it goes . 
  for reals , why you guys feel the need to read this retarded rt-tier propaganda ? 
  of course , in this huge article specifically about failed transition of russia to democracy , catastrophic 1990s are somehow almost entirely omitted . 
   it did change the course of events , saving bashar al-assad from a seemingly inevitable fall , and made the humanitarian situation in syria far worse . 
  but russia cares little about the future of syria . 
  lol . 
  i like how you moved goalposts from suppression of the hungarian rebellion to the soviet crimes in general . 
  bolshevik crimes were terrible , but 1 ) they mostly targeted population of the soviet union 2 ) ended with the death of stalin . 
  you should know better , considering that estonia still celebrate their waffen ss criminals . 
  i mean , freedom fighters . 
  to be fair to them , they were pretty effective in elimination of their jews . 
  almost no one who left in estonia managed to survive . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_holocaust_in_estonia  about 75 % of estonian jews , aware of the fate that awaited them from nazi germany , escaped to the soviet union ; virtually all of those who remained ( between 950 and 1,000 people ) were killed by einsatzgruppe a and local collaborators before the end of 1941 . 
  [ ... ] units of the eesti omakaitse ( estonian home guard ; approximately 1000 to 1200 men ) were directly involved in criminal acts , taking part in the round-up of 200 roma people and 950 jews . 
  [ 1 ]  [ ... ]  in 2002 the government of the republic of estonia decided to officially commemorate the holocaust . 
  in the same year , the simon wiesenthal center had provided the estonian government with information on alleged estonian war criminals , all former members of the 36th estonian police battalion . 
  random trivia : holocaust denial is not a crime in estonia . 
  it was necessary , without any doubt , in context of cold war . 
  and why should not we ? 
  good or bad , but it was the legitimate government , and they were not `` peaceful protesters '' in any reasonable sense of this phrase . 
  also , it probably was a bad idea to hang people on trees : https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:protesters_with_body_of_avh_personnel.jpg it did n't add legitimacy to this movement . 
  do n't forget that the rebels killed at least 669 russians , including conscripts , so we mostly remember this story in context `` hungarian bandits who murdered russians '' . 
  i understand that the westerners see russians as low-value disposable resource , but let 's agree to disagree here .
