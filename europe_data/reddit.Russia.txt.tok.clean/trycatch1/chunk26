  it 's natural that different nations have different historical memory . 
  we know . 
  that 's why we need our nuclear arms and modern system of its delivery -- to cooldown western hawks and hotheads . 
  nato is going to win -- losing a sizable part of its population in process . 
  the most honest , neutral and unbiased western press strikes again . 
  literal translation :  old fear of the nuclear war as the end of everything , as something inevitable ( ? 
  ) , the fear that was built up in the years of the cold war , ** partially remains ** . 
  but for the most part of population all the speculations on the topic of nuclear weapons are something like a game . 
  the game we play with the west . 
  interpretmag interpretation :  aleksey levinson , a sociologist at the levada center , says that surveys show [ he did n't say that surveys show it , because there were no such surveys ] that russians have ** partially lost the sense ** they had in soviet times that a nuclear war would be the end of everything and now view talk about it as a kind of game between moscow [ he did n't say that russians view _ nuclear war _ a kind of game , only _ speculations _ about nuclear arms ] , which they view as the innocent , and the west , which they see as the aggressor [ word `` aggressor '' was n't used even a single time in the interview ] . 
  title :  russians ** no longer think ** nuclear war would be end of everything and talk of war as a kind of game , sociologist says so , `` remains in part '' turned into `` partially lost the sense '' turned into `` no longer think '' . 
  they even included the correct translation somewhere in the middle of the article . 
  but very few fearless russian propaganda fighters of / r/europe would read that far . 
  they are banderites , members of extremist organization una-unso . 
  karpuk was the leader of una-unso in 2001 . 
  cry me a river . 
  europe is free to flirt with ukrainian nationalists or syrian jihadists as much as they want , but russia is not going to tolerate extremism . 
  it 's a shame that they convicted in a kangaroo court for the crimes they did n't commit , instead of their real crimes , but whatever . 
  they are like beria or ezhov who were executed for being foreign spies , while they committed real crimes enough for 100 executions . 
  they never were rehabilitated , while their convictions were obviously fabricated . 
   does it mean reach ? 
  coverage ? 
  or just how many people view channel as whole ? 
  that 's probably total amount of people in households who are subscribed for tv packages that include tsargrad . 
  in other place they used more correct term `` potential viewership '' . 
  tsargrad is included in base packages of several major paid tv providers , so it looks pretty realistic . 
  but it does n't mean people actually watch it , they just have it in base packages alongside with 100-200 other channels . 
   i actually think he wants some big conflict like that , to decide russian place in his mind . 
  that 's entirely possible , but he did n't say it in the bbc 's quotation . 
  bbc , of course , interpreted it in _ the right way _ , in line with their narrative . 
   i do n't think it 's about mainstream russians , but mainly does he have this big influence on putin and russian elite as many write he does . 
  why was he fired from the msu then ? 
  if he is so influential , why is he so absent in russian state-controlled media ? 
  that 's results from search query `` alexander dugin '' in ria novosti , major state-owned news agency : [ link ] ( https://ria.ru/search/?query=%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%81%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b4%d1%80+%d0%b4%d1%83%d0%b3%d0%b8%d0%bd ) . 
  only references to him i see are trivial mentions in the lists of various sanctions ( dugin 's books were banned in ukraine , and he is included in several personal sanctions lists ) _ and _ some mentions in reviews of the western press . 
  [ channel one ] ( https://www.1tv.ru/search/news?from=&amp;to=&amp;q=%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%81%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b4%d1%80%20%d0%b4%d1%83%d0%b3%d0%b8%d0%bd ) -- 2 interviews in 2011 on topic of muslim holidays , and that 's all in the last 15 years . 
  [ tass.ru ] ( http://tass.ru/search?query=%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%81%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b4%d1%80+%d0%b4%d1%83%d0%b3%d0%b8%d0%bd ) - all mentions in context of sanctions . 
  [ ntv.ru ] ( http://www.ntv.ru/finder/?keytext=%c4%f3%e3%e8%ed ) - trivial mentions in context of sanctions . 
  but if you 'll search _ western _ press you 'll get tons of articles on him . 
   channel that 42 million people watch which is not a small deal what ?!, 
  that 's nonsense . 
  it 's a fringe cable/satellite channel , i never heard about before . 
  maybe it 's _ available _ for 42 million people , but you can say that any website is available for 7 billion people . 
   russian authority does n't debunk this statements . 
  and the us authorities do n't debunk the statements of the guy that the earth is controlled by lizard people . 
  it 's either 1 ) they agree with him , or 2 ) maybe do n't feel the need to do it , because he has no official status whatsoever . 
   no he does n't brzezinski saying us is no longer imperial superpower , dugin saying war is inevitable for russians to become independent civilization he did n't say this in the paragraph cited by bbc . 
  he said that the us can return its lost status of the imperial superpower boss over russia only via war . 
  basically the same stuff as brzezinski . 
   i mean if you listen to dugin , it 's pretty clear that he is crazy guy , no doubt about it . 
  that 's exactly why he is so popular in the western _ media _ ( western media -- russian propaganda , do n't confuse these two ! ) . 
  cherry pick crazy guy , sell his opinion as mainstream russian thoughts . 
  no , i understand your `` point '' better than you . 
  people have opinions different from mainstream western opinions ? 
  scary . 
  truly terrifying and orwellian . 
  seems to be just retelling of [ paul feyerabend ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paul_feyerabend ) 's ideas . 
  as a professional philosopher , dugin of course read his works . 
  so , please remind me , how bbc _ news _ are different from rt propaganda ? 
  it seems they do the very same thing -- cherry-pick fringe opinions and sell them as mainstream . 
  western _ media _ is so obsessed with that dugin freak . 
  he was fired from the moscow state university two years ago , but it changed nothing with this obsession . 
  if i search for [ `` alexander dugin '' in russian google news ] ( https://www.google.ru/search?q= '' \u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 + \u0434\u0443\u0433\u0438\u043d '' + - \u0446\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 & tbm = nws ) -- excluding his own ultra-conservative cable tv channel `` tsargrad '' , most of the mentions of dugin are coming from translated western _ media _ . 
  it seems the west created their own [ dr. hyder ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_hyder ) , american weirdo , whose activism was widely unknown in the us itself , but he was top news in the soviet union . 
   `` if the united states does not want to start a war , you should recognise that united states is not any more a unique master . 
  and [ with ] the situation in syria and ukraine , russia says , ` no you are not any more the boss . ', 
  that is the question of who rules the world . 
  only war could decide really . '', 
   mr dugin 's bellicose doublethink is not aimed solely at the west . 
  apparently it 's `` bellicose doublethink '' to do n't consider the united states our masters . 
  i mean , even zbigniew brzezinski says [ almost the same as dugin in this paragraph ] ( http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/04/17/toward-a-global-realignment/ ) . 
  the era of global dominance of the us is ending , it should recognise this new reality to avoid devastating conflicts . 
  so while it 's evident for people as different as brzezinski and dugin , but for bbc it 's `` different reality '' and `` bellicose doublethink '' . 
  what an amazing pinnacle of journalism . 
  collect ukrainian twits and call it a day . 
  much better than terrible russian propaganda  kuzya was produced in the soviet union , drawbacks of kuzya are well-known , including design flaws and especially bad unreliable boiler-and-turbine power-plant . 
  it 's scheduled for modernisation in spring 2017 , and its power-plant would be the major target of the planned modernisation . 
  so people for reals are rumbling about rusty soviet tech that is scheduled for replacement . 
  it 's especially funny to see ukrainian twitter accounts , considering that kuzya was produced in the soviet ukraine in the black sea shipyard located in mykolaiv . 
  ukraine have no aircraft carriers at all , its flagship is just a frigate , ukraine sold its own unfinished aircraft carrier of the same project 1143 [ to china ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chinese_aircraft_carrier_liaoning ) for peanuts . 
  russia too sold its another project 1143 carrier -- [ to india ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ins_vikramaditya ) , but with $ 2.3 b contract that included modernisation , planes and so on . 
  sergei leleka of the komsomolskaya pravda is a rare idiot indeed . 
  butthurt ? 
  from what exactly ? 
  that embassy guy ( yakovenko ) is consciously and deliberately jokes to provoke reaction . 
  in other words , he is trolling . 
  that 's far from the first time , he posted `` harold and kumar '' screenshot before and that [ wwi pic with angry turk ] ( https://twitter.com/russianembassy/status/669924409172434944 ) . 
  he probably is very satisfied that his bait was eaten and laughs his ass off on the tsunami of anger from the western public that ca n't parse his lighthearted joke . 
   butthurt russians , getting angry by / r/europe criticizing the poor taste of their government officials . 
  what is wrong ? 
  i thought russia is strong and does n't give a shit ? 
  also russians ca n't distinguish government officials from a cartoon newspaper . 
  ( np.reddit.com ) that 's one of the most non-butthurt titles i ever seen . 
  https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-pd-14-revives-russian-hopes-for-commercial-428518/  but aviadvigatel 's efforts still come close to matching the best that western engine manufacturers can offer on fuel burn . 
  bjorn fehrm , an analyst at leeham and a former saab engineer and test pilot , has calculated that the pw1400g exceeds the fuel efficiency of the pd-14 by only 2.5 % . 
  it 's important to use this military stuff in real wars to learn their weaknesses and train crew , even if it is n't cost effective . 
  just today russian mod talked about weaknesses of our military hardware that were uncovered by the syrian campaign . 
  same thing happened in st. petersburg recently , when authorities with support of some top putin 's bureaucrats installed mannerheim 's memorial plaque . 
  it was repeatedly vandalised by various nationalist groups , poured with paint , drilled , smashes with hammer . 
  in the end the state had to hide the damaged plaque in some museum , blaming public for immaturity and unreadiness for discussion about controversial figures .
