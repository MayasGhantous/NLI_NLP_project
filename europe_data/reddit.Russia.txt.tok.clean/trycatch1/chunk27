   they were accused because they broke in a church . 
  they `` broke into '' church open for everyone . 
  imagine `` breaking into '' an open shop to dance there . 
  you probably would not get several years jail time for that . 
   before that they 've broken into prison , overturned police cars and did another shitton of fucked up things . 
  unrelated . 
  they were not charged for that . 
   the last bit was just the last drop . 
  no , it was n't . 
  it was just a kangaroo court that used some ad hoc legal theory to retroactively apply blasphemy laws on pr 's actions and throw them in prison . 
  they were guilty under blasphemy laws , but these laws were adopted in response , after the pr 's action . 
  nobody would care even a little bit would they continue doing things they were doing before , but laughing on official state 's church is entirely different business . 
   and i tend to trust wikipedia on this one , considering that archiving all traffic is simply impossible . 
  it 's in the plain text of the law . 
  voice , images , sounds , video , other message should be archived for up to 6 months , details of implementation are up to the government of russia . 
  and it 's not impossible , just expensive . 
  maybe they will not archive encrypted https traffic , because it 's just silly ( without state-wide mitm ) , but at least all the voice data will be archived . 
   as of `` black boxes '' for vehicles , well , that 's just idea . 
  it 's an idea that has wide support in the government . 
  they are not `` black boxes '' , they are always online `` spy boxes '' reporting every movement of every vehicle in the country + remote shutdown . 
  britain has terrible track record , but yarovaya 's laws with their archiving of all _ traffic _ ( not metadata ) and ideas like installing [ glonass movement-tracking spy modules ] ( http://www.interfax.ru/russia/531286 ) in every new sold car are pretty unprecedented anyway . 
   possibly helping brexit it 's quite flattering to read / r/europe . 
  it seems that russia is truly the most powerful country in the world . 
  nothing bad could possibly happen anywhere without involvement of russia , putin 's agents or useful idiots ( these guys are potentially good , you just need to explain them evils of russian propaganda ) . 
   bombing civilians in syria  bombing un aid convoys cry `` whataboutism '' as much as you like . 
  300.000 already died in this war , even before russian intervention . 
  russian aviation is active in syria for 1 year already . 
  the us and eu suddenly started to care , wiping their crocodile tears , only after significant syrian and russian military successes in eastern aleppo . 
  us do n't give a fuck about civilians . 
  it 's angry , because it started to be obvious that if nothing will change , us minions are going to lose . 
  they are citizens of ukraine who lived in donbass for generations . 
  they have every right to watch tv channels they want to watch , to wave flags they want to wave , to express opinions they want to express , voting for politicians they want to vote . 
  self-identifying as russian , jew or jedi should not make their opinions any less important than opinions of pureblood aryan-ukrainian with certificate from phrenologist . 
  and if ukraine is trying to impose on these people ideology unacceptable for them , they have every right to revolt . 
   with support from russia russia supports pro-russians in ukraine . 
  is that really unexpected for anyone ? 
  of course , russia consciously heated up this conflict , using plenty of methods from propaganda to sending various armed groups , and tightly controls all these `` rebels '' . 
  but it was just an amplification of existing genuine discontent . 
  no amount of external propaganda will make western ukrainians wanting to joint russia . 
  people watched russian tv , because it better resonated with them . 
  as in ebul `` whataboutism '' ? 
  i thought `` whataboutism '' is bad , but it seems it 's entirely fine when used against russia . 
  no , it 's a crap article notwithstanding the author , and the moscow times is a garbage newspaper . 
   alexei levinson , the author , is a sociologist at the independent levada center polling organization . 
  so what ? 
  because you do n't have much leverage against belarus and ca n't stop it . 
   yet everyone is chill about the fact that russia is building another nuclear power plant in belarus not exactly true . 
  lithuania was ( and still is ) actively hostile to this project . 
  it even received harsh response from belarusian government : http://un.mfa.gov.by/docs/non_paper_eng.pdf  seem to have a really sketchy safety regulations . 
  that 's just fud . 
  russia builds in belarus the same vver-1200 as it builds in finland and hungary . 
  this design was scrupulously analysed by a lot of different countries , and it 's just evolutionary upgrade of vver-1000 reactors that were widely deployed all over the world with great track record . 
   first russia called ukraine neo-nazis it was a totally groundless , because neo-nazis do n't exist in ukraine . 
  what you see on the videos is just an optical illusion . 
  just like neo-nazi azov regiment that received from the government tanks . 
   closing schools because there was no real demand for these schools in crimea . 
  according to [ the recent poll ] ( http://openopinion.ru/content_res/articles/oo_crimea_brief.pdf ) ( page 17 ) , only 1 % of crimean population use ukrainian language inside of their families . 
  ukraine just tried to force ukrainian language down the throat of russians as part of their ukrainisation policy . 
   while ukraine has the smallest amount of nationalists in the parliament all parties of the ukrainian parliament are pretty nationalistic , except opposition bloc and `` revival '' party ( successors of the party of regions ) . 
  chairman of verkhovnaya rada is andriy parubiy was one of the founders of social-national party of ukraine ( early svoboda ) . 
  when these `` crazies '' receive governmental support , it gets a bit different . 
  ukrainian state declared upa founding _ a public holiday _ ( [ defender of ukraine day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/defender_of_ukraine_day ) ) , and what you see is just celebration of the said holiday . 
   and the country is at war with russia . 
  and the country is at war with part of its own population that does n't want to see nazi rallies on the streets of their cities . 
   the moscow times oh , i see some ultra-heavy artillery here . 
  they probably just get assignments like `` write a 1000 words essay , something bad about russia '' , and just do n't give a damn about resulting quality . 
   a surprisingly cheap and effective ultraconservative drug has been found for them : a daily showing of old soviet films on major tv channels . 
  this shit is hilarious . 
  some would just think that soviet movies are part of russian culture , just like e.g. 
  19th century literature of imperial russia , but thanks to this guy the evil plan was uncovered !, 
  however , that 's today 's tv schedule : https://tv.yandex.ru/2?genre=films&amp;grid=main&amp;period=all-day i see only two soviet movies right now -- adaptation of `` the suicide club '' by stevenson ( this one is very good , brilliant actors , banionis , dal ' ) , and adaptation of `` first love '' by turgenev , both on second-tier channels that seem to specialize on old soviet movies . 
  other movies are either foreign or modern russian . 
  btw there were much more soviet movies on tv in 1990s , because russian tv industry was pretty much dead at the time . 
   they have started to inject symbols of the soviet and imperial periods into popular culture . 
  in other parts -- the us should stop creating movies about american civil war . 
  france should stop creating moving about the french revolution . 
  russia is literally nazi germany . 
  putin is literally hitler . 
  bombing of long-bearded freedom-loving democrats in aleppo is literally holocaust . 
  it was n't so clearcut , he was a student historian , and killed his wife who cheated on him with her lover . 
  and he was n't 27 year old , but 23-year-old , so at the moment of the murder he was just 21 year old with clean criminal record . 
  anyway , executions is a barbaric practice that has no place in europe . 
   there is a widespread belief among russians that any criticism of the government or contradiction of the official narrative is anti-russian by definition , and this framing all dissent thus is the most significant aspect of russian propaganda , even more so than omitting any mention of impropriety by the russian state . 
  western media goes far beyond criticizing putin 's government or policies . 
  nothing positive could possibly come from russia . 
  i searched random _ positive _ things in rfe/rl . 
  russia builds vostochnyy cosmodrome , first big russian space project after the collapse of the soviet union . 
  rfe/rl covers it in the following way : `` for the russian government , when a soyuz rocket lifts off from the vostochny launch facility in the far east sometime in april , it will mark the dawn of a new era in the country 's storied space program . 
  * for others , the new liftoff site 's long and twisting tale of delays , corruption , and management restructuring sounds a lot more like the past than a bright future . 
  * '' russia is successful in exporting nuclear reactors , because they are cheap , safe , and russia is ready to invest its own money in construction . 
  let 's [ spead ] ( http://www.rferl.org/a/belarus-nuclear-mishap-soviet-style-secrecy-rule/27898340.html ) [ fud ] ( http://www.rferl.org/a/russia_nuclear_power_plants_unsafe_criticisms/2342630.html ) [ about their safety ] ( http://www.rferl.org/a/belarus_activists_campaign_vs_nuclear_plant/2339184.html ) , reiterate about chernobyl ad nauseum ( who cares that rbmk design used in chernobyl was long-time retired , while vver design has good safety record and passed tons of third-party certifications and evaluations ) . 
  russians are good in sports ? 
  let 's overblow doping cases , imply that all russians are cheaters . 
  russia becomes world 's top wheat exporter ? 
  [ do n't report it at all ] ( http://www.rferl.org/s?k=russia+wheat+export ) . 
  recently a twit from huffington post popped up in my twitter stream : `` oh my god , did you too notice , that trump 's vice-president recited a russian proverb ?! '', 
  ( implying he did something terrible and inappropriate ) or check this today 's masterpiece from bloomberg : '' [ treat russia like the international poison it is ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-13/treat-russia-like-the-international-poison-it-is ) '' . 
  they are not just against putin . 
  they are against russia and russians in general ( or topics as far-fetched as proverbs that can be centuries old and not even really russian ) . 
  nothing good can happen in russia , russia ca n't bring anything positive for the world , etc.
