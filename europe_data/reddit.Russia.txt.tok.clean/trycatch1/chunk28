  it works very well , ordinary people really start to think this way . 
  i 'm not saying russian media is any better . 
  in russian pro-gov media nothing good comes from the us and especially ukraine . 
  `` ukraine fails at something '' , `` ukrainian does something stupid '' are beloved topics . 
   there was a huge amount of anti-french sentiment resulting , resulting in french fries being named `` freedom fries '' in restaurants . 
  interesting . 
  never heard about it . 
  never noticed in american popular culture much of anti-french sentiment , except throwaway jokes about surrendering french cowards in sitcoms . 
   but whenever there is an acrimonious split between a corporation and an employee , there is simply no way to know what really went on unless you are an insider . 
  he had been working for rfe/rl for 25 years . 
  he was suspended and demoted to an ordinary journalist immediately after his blog post with that one sentence . 
  pretty clearcut . 
  it 's interesting that he went full pro-putin and anti-west since then , and he works for some rebel dnr media now . 
  interesting transformation of an ex-putin 's enemy , who was almost killed by fsb . 
   rfe/rl by its very nature is counter propaganda . 
  just like rt. 
  both rt and rfe/rl do n't care about truth , they do n't care about reporting , they only care about pushing agenda of their respective governments . 
  that 's definition of propaganda . 
  and it 's not sensible to find out which propaganda is more sensible or honest . 
  result is the same . 
  both people watching only western msm media and people watching only russian state-controlled media are going to have extremely skewed worldviews . 
  they gifted to us beautiful nothing , and we , ungrateful bastards , still pursue our own national interests . 
  this guy is an apt pupil , too bad his predecessors did n't end well . 
  `` due proccess '' and `` length of negotiations '' are entirely peripheral artificial problems that do n't influence outcome in any way . 
  no matter how long the negotiations would be , no matter how well the referendum would be organized - everybody ( including ukraine , eu and us ) know that the result would be same . 
  crimeans did n't want to live in ukraine even after 23 years of independence , and the west did n't want to recognise their choice , because it was n't beneficial for them . 
  and i would not object if the position of western countries would be the following -- `` let the osce organize fair referendum , respect human rights of tatars , negotiate with ukraine about their property -- and then we 'll recognize crimea '' . 
  then it would be a position of self-proclaimed democrats i can understand . 
  nope . 
  they just do n't respect self-determination of the crimeans , which is plain anti-democratic . 
  to follow `` due process '' like the us followed in serbia , russia should have bombed kyiv , toppled turchinov 's government , occupied crimea and expelled ukrainians and tatars from there , then recognized its independence in 10 years , then forbade this useless `` independent '' pseudostate from joining to russia . 
  certainly it 's neither in interests of ukrainians , nor in the interests of crimeans , but it 's for some reason required to satisfy weird arbitrary feel-good rules of the west . 
  rules the west do n't respect itself -- they did n't care about rights of serbians in kosovo , when they were ethnically cleansed . 
  note that crimean tatars still live in crimea , unlike serbians in kosovo . 
  according to pro-ukrainian tatar meidjlis leader tchubarov , 5 % of crimean tatars fled crimea since 2014 . 
  compare it with 50 % of serbians who had to flee kosovo after the nato 's humanitarian bombings . 
   even if the majority would rather be a part of russia , that is simply not nearly enough to justify seizing the territory from ukraine . 
  justify ? 
  to whom ? 
  that 's up to crimeans to decide their fate . 
  not up to the us . 
  / r/europe circlejerk continues, 
  you need two sides to start a conflict . 
  assad certainly shares part of guilt . 
  do n't forget that there is also western aleppo with population of 1.5 m ( 250k in rebel-controlled eastern aleppo , and it 's possible this number was significantly inflated ) that is controlled by government , that shelters refugees from eastern aleppo who had to run from their rebel `` liberators '' and that live under constant shelling of rebels . 
  recent video from their side by channel 4 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of32suz-c04, 
  so this mysterious lost city of moderate rebels bombed by russia is not found , 404 . 
  as expected . 
   everyone and are you speaking on behalf of all syrians ? 
  just because you read something in the western media that pointed fingers on good guys and bad guys ? 
  that 's ... impressive . 
   you did n't read the rest of the article you linked , did n't you ? 
  so fucking what when this particular islamist took weapons to kill authorities ? 
  i 've asked city controlled by moderate rebels -- you gave as an example town controlled by fucking ahrar al-sham . 
  ahrar al-sham ( often referred to as `` syrian taliban '' ) is a salafist group recognized by number of countries as terroristic , it wants to install in syria islamic state under sharia law and it allies al-nusra . 
  feel free to read in wikipedia about them . 
   guess that 's why he 's relying on iranian-paid afghan and pakistani mercenaries , then . 
  just like the rebels relying on recruits from all over the world . 
  it 's war . 
  every side uses any help it can obtain . 
  rebels use foreign fighters too , and it can be argued they are relatively more relying on foreign fighters . 
  and of course money from qatar , ksa , us and turkey are much better than money from russia . 
  money with taste of freedom . 
  ignoring your dodging attempt , and considering _ original _ question , question of assad 's support , all opinion surveys of syrians i 've seen so far , [ orb international poll in 2015 ] ( https://off-guardian.org/2015/12/19/western-poll-assad-supported-by-most-syrians/ ) and [ yougov siraj 2012 poll ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/17/syrians-support-assad-western-propaganda ) , found that assad is the most supported actor in syria . 
  you may disagree with polls conducted in conflict zone , but neither you nor the holier-than-thou west have better sources . 
  i 'm trying to tell you it 's not black and white in syria . 
  you are trying to tell that it 's not all black and white , using word `` cunt '' to describe assad , `` mercenaries '' to describe syrian soldiers , `` guernica '' to describe russian campaign in aleppo , `` moderate group '' to describe ahrah al-sham . 
  it was a good attempt . 
  you are almost as fair and impartial as western media . 
   it 's russian propaganda and their fellow fucking travelers who try to paint the conflict in black and white because if that were the case , then assad would , barely , qualify as white . 
  assad is not white . 
  but his western-backed sunni islamist foes are much darker . 
   that 's not clear . 
  he was suspended for defending putin 's annexation of crimea and human rights in russia . 
  actually most his post he was suspended for contained criticism of term `` national traitors '' used by putin ( [ the post ] ( http://natpressru.info/index.php?newsid=8837 ) ) . 
  he used only 1 ( one ) sentence to support reuinification of russia with crimea : `` that 's not about crimea -- i fully agree with general points of vladimir putin that russia had every right to take population of the peninsula under its defense '' . 
  that ' all . 
  for this 1 sentence he was suspended . 
  btw , i absolutely love people who call themselves democrats , but do n't respect democratic choice of crimean population . 
   but it is hardly a demonstration that rfe/rl is anti-russian . 
  i ca n't imagine more direct demonstration of anti-russian stance , when top liberal war reporter , who was labeled a `` traitor '' and `` agent of bandits '' by putin himself during the second chechen war , then detained and forcefully delivered to chechen insurgents , was sacked just for having pro-russian opinion shared by  90 % of russians . 
   only claimed by sputnik and other russian media . 
  it was claimed by babitsky himself in his interview [ to a czech site ] ( http://www.lidovky.cz/babickij-rusove-na-krymu-se-konecne-dockali-pomoci-moskvy-pms-/zpravy-svet.aspx?c=a150313_224800_ln_zahranici_ele ) ( google translate ) :  september 2 , 2014 i was on camera made the exhumation of four bodies . 
  two civilians and two rebels . 
  according to the testimony of local residents - not militants , but villagers novosv\u011btlovka affordable - these people were executed ukrainian battalion of volunteers ajdar . 
  i did not not comment , only recorded on camera and sent to the moldovan editors liberty . 
  video hanged on site . 
  at that moment nationalists who sit in the newsroom ukrainian svoboda got hysterical . 
  it was a terrible scandal . 
  in doing so , i gave the site a video that recorded what i really saw , without my comments . 
  [ ... ] this video downloaded . 
  september 26 , i returned to prague . 
  they invited me and told me that my position was abolished . 
  radio liberty is definitely and obviously become merely a tool of american propaganda . 
  he says that rfe/rl is american propaganda , and i think he is entitled to his opinion , because he worked for rfe/rl since 1989 . 
  you forgot to point on the map this mysterious city controlled by a ) moderate rebels b ) bombed by russia . 
  https://twitter.com/thelemniscat/status/784130562298699776 or maybe idlib ? 
  http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/culture/2015/04/syria-idlib-christians-jabhat-alnusra-.html  the success of the white helmets has drawn the fury of the regime this ( very neutral ofc ) shit is hilarous . 
  humanitarian organization , financed by the us , and also simultaneously openly pushing for regime change . 
   madaya , for example .
