  ahrar ash-sham is a moderate group for you ? 
  but at this stage i am not surprised in any insane claim of western apologists . 
  [ vice news ] ( https://news.vice.com/article/exclusive-meet-the-syrian-rebel-commander-in-the-besieged-city-of-madaya ) :  the 47-year old former baker never attended university , and , apart from some lessons at the mosque , he has no formal islamic education . 
  ** but he now leads the local branch of ahrar al-sham , perhaps the largest islamist rebel group in the syrian civil war . 
  ** for the past six months , he and his men have been under a brutal hezbollah siege in the syrian city of madaya , located about 28 miles northwest of damascus . 
   now surrounded by his mercenaries and hizbollah , all approaches mined , people starving . 
  ah-ha-ha , dirty assad mercenaries against brave rebel freedom fighters . 
  too bad assad is supported by majority of syrians , unlike your bearded sunni jihadi friends . 
   weathering hizbollah attacks and putin 's recreation of guernica must seem preferable to assad taking his revenge . 
  you forgot to compare it with holocaust . 
  of course , you do n't care that 1.5 million of aleppo citizens that live in assad-controlled territory under `` rebel '' shelling , you do n't care about any warcrime or massacre committed by the rebels , you do n't care that the `` rebels '' from aleppo attack not only gov-controlled territories , but also kurd-controlled area in sheikh maqsood . 
  you do n't care about anything that does n't fit to your worldview , just retelling black-white propaganda against ebul russians . 
  state-funded deutsche welle in russian exists . 
  and of course it has pretty clear agenda . 
  i would not call it `` propaganda '' , though . 
  for example , their interviews with poroshenko and klimkin went viral among pro-russians , because the interviewer asked tough questions , and ukrainian functionaries looked weak . 
  but still -- they have agenda . 
  they certainly dislike competitors . 
  it 's blatantly anti-russian . 
  they sacked top journalist babitsky , who worked on rfe/rl since the soviet union , when he supported self-determination of crimeans and tried to report on warcrimes of ukrainian paramilitaries . 
  how is it different from voice of america or rfe/rl ? 
  i can read rfe/rl in russian and i can tell you it 's pretty much blatant propaganda . 
  what a bunch of inane bullshit . 
  that 's exactly what russia does in syria . 
  russia does n't fight kurds or moderate groups like southern front . 
  point on the map these `` non-fundamentalist rebel groups '' bombed by russia . 
  which cities they do control ? 
   they are there to make sure their puppet stays . 
  aww , `` peaceful protesters '' narrative again . 
  assad has majority popular support . 
  why should he step down because of demands of \\* violent \\* rioters ? 
  he had every right to crack down on `` protests '' , and you sorta has to use violence when `` protesters '' start to set buildings on fire and kill police officers . 
   like the kurds ? 
  russia does n't bomb the kurds . 
  quite the opposite , the kurds are being shelled by us-supported aleppo moderate head-choppers . 
  google sheikh maqsood shellings -- entirely ignored by the most honest and impartial western media . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ypg%e2%80%93fsa_relations#clashes_with_other_fsa_groups_in_aleppo_.28november_2015_.e2.80.93_present.29  and russia is not cleaning up . 
  it is targeting doctors without borders facilities and causing a massive humanitarian crisis . 
  so it was russia who created `` a massive humanitarian crisis '' . 
  good to know . 
  why `` in general '' ? 
  french motivation is entirely inside of scope of this topic . 
  france [ funded these moderate terrorists ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/07/france-funding-syrian-rebels ) to change regime in sovereign country without un permission . 
  they helped to turn this conflict in the huge bloodbath it currently is . 
  france is not some neutral third party , they are knee-deep in blood of syrian people . 
  so may they gently shut the fuck up , when we are cleaning up the shit after them ? 
  the only irrelevant thing here is french blabbering . 
  rules should be same for everyone , or they are not really rules . 
  video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v71cjf_9ekg the dress was demonstrated as part of forum `` geopolitical challenges of modern time and spiritual mission of vladimir putin '' ( [ link ] ( http://www.forsmi.ru/announce/350030/ ) ) organized by bahrain 's embassy in putin 's birthday . 
  this dress `` face of tsar '' was designed by [ mona al mansouri ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mona_al_mansouri ) . 
  if `` peaceful protesters '' respond to violence with violence , it 's not a peaceful protest anymore . 
  it 's a riot or uprising . 
  and every non-failed government , any authorities will try to forcefully suppress it . 
  of course , assad is a brutal dictator , no doubt about it , i do n't argue against it -- but i do n't trust this `` peaceful protest '' narrative . 
  it 's a fact that hundreds of syrian police officers were killed in first few months of unrest/protest/uprising phase , and it was barely mentioned in the western media . 
  assad used excessive force and gunned down protesters . 
  sure . 
  but looking around i see countries like [ nigeria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/killing_of_pro-biafra_protesters_ ( 2015-2016 \\ ) ) or [ ethiopia ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36546917 ) that kill protesters at factory scale , but it seems nobody really care about them . 
  while in case of syria the us went full mad , `` assad should go '' and so on . 
  peaceful protests . 
  i have heard about these [ `` peaceful protesters '' already somewhere ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm1nkqspsvm ) . 
  do you realize that these `` peaceful protesters '' set on fire several buildings ? 
   20 march , president assad sent a delegation to offer condolences to the families of those killed in the clashes in daraa . 
  [ 29 ] thousands gathered in and around the omari mosque in daraa , chanting their demands : release of political prisoners , abolition of emergency law , and : `` no fear after today '' . 
  [ 29 ] [ 30 ] as the protests heated , the police sprayed tear gas , further angering the protesters who started tearing down a poster of assad ; then the police opened fire into the crowd , witnesses said . 
  [ 29 ]  protesters then burned the local ba'ath party headquarters , the town 's main courthouse and a branch of the syriatel phone company owned by rami makhlouf , a cousin of president assad , a symbol of corruption for the anti-government protesters and considered syria 's richest businessman . 
  [ 22 ] [ 29 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] on the same day , ** seven police officers and four demonstrators were killed in daraa . 
  ** [ 22 ] if the protesters were so peaceful , how these 7 police were killed ? 
  did they shot themselves ? 
  misconduct ? 
  10 spetsnaz soldiers were killed during the storm , including three commanders of storming groups -- two lieutenant-colonels and one mayor . 
  those were the largest special forces casualties in the russian history in a single operation . 
  they had to go in attack even without bullet-proof vests , because the terrorists suddenly started to kill hostages . 
  these people are heroes . 
   russia and assad are bombing hospitals , this is a war crime [ hmm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kunduz_hospital_airstrike ) :  a final report , released 29 april 2016 , reaffirmed the incident as an accident , and said it thus did not amount to a war crime . 
  [ 57 ] sixteen members of the u.s. military were disciplined as a result of the investigation , though none were criminally charged . 
  you forgot a little thing . 
  evidence that russia ** intentionally ** bombs hospitals . 
  because hospitals get bombed for a lot of reasons like in every bombing campaign everywhere . 
  and comparison with other bombing campaigns does n't show that russian bombing is any different in terms of civilian casualties . 
  there would be much higher casualties among civilians would they be really deliberately targeted . 
  i see you are trying to say something . 
  go on . 
  what ? 
  well , i just copied that from wikipedia . 
  it clearly attributes the claim to serbian sources ( obviously biased ) . 
  ok , i edited it out . 
  but my point was that in the end we have 1000 killed combatants and 500 killed civilians , that 's 1/2 ratio -- the same as in this case , if the `` sohr '' numbers are correct . 
  i know that feel . 
  when you accidentally walk out of your cozy echo-chamber and meet with opinions you do n't agree with . 
  how so ? 
  france never called up to for similar investigation against the us or other countries . 
  and i strongly doubt that if e.g. 
  the north korea would blame the us for human right violations ( well , they do it all the time , just read rodong sinmun ) , people would seriously discuss their accusations . 
  russia is not perfect , i do n't know how you get that from my words . 
  neither is the us pure evil , i did n't claim it either . 
  the us greatly helped the kurds in their offensive against isis and so on . 
  maybe they honestly believe they do the right thing and promote democracy ( tm ) , helping the rebels , i do n't know . 
  but in fact they are helping extremists ( see the brave new world of idlib ) and fucking up this poor country . 
  compromise and agreement with russia is certainly possible .
