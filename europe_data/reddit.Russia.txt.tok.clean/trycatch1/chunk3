  3 ) russia started to openly shell encircled ukrainian forces from russian territory with grads and heavy artillery . 
  the first major instance of that shelling happened on july 12 , when 19 soldiers ( or even more , up to 50-70 , according to unofficial estimates ) were killed in a grad ( tornado-g , as ua officials claim ) attack under zelenopolye . 
  the situation for the encircled started to become increasingly grim . 
  ua soldiers were not able to return fire , because the attackers were on russian territory , so they were basically just targets for russian artillery . 
  various ua journalists , activists , wives of the soldiers immediately started to ask to do something with them , to redeploy the encircled deeper in ukraine to make it possible to fire back . 
  however , brilliant ukrainian generals did nothing , except lying every day that encircled forces were unblocked , and responding `` hang in there !, 
  '' , `` do n't give up ! '', 
  on reports about shelling from russia from the encircled servicemen . 
  during these 3 weeks the ua forces on the border suffered significant casualties , lost most of their military equipment and vehicles , and basically became unfit for action . 
  what happened today is not yet clear . 
  rnbo claims that there was a `` planned operation '' carried out at 4:30 , part of the encircled forces near to chervonopartisansk were able to break through , another part retreated to russia . 
  they lie all the time , so i have no idea if it 's true or not . 
  servicemen that were able to call to their relatives after the event say something like that : `` alive . 
  not in russia '' , `` we did n't surrender . 
  we are at gukovo '' , `` we did n't desert , we carried out orders '' . 
  bbc journalist who saw at gukovo says that they destroyed their weapons , while their apcs were long time destroyed by enemy fire .

  dutch and swedish wikipedias have ~ 2/3 bot-created articles and ~ 1/2 bot-edits . 
  without these articles they would not be able to even reach top 10 . 
   the last independent russian tv news show was cancelled about 10 years ago . 
  yes , approximately when parfyonov was kicked from ntv . 
   a russian who posts 90 % of the time in / r/ukraina / of course , that 's bs about 90 % , i had been active on reddit for years before / r/ukraina even existed , but yeah , i post there under `` st. petersburg '' flair . 
  it 's a russian-speaking subreddit , and there are plenty of other russians there . 
  ukraine is and will be at least for a while the dominating topic of discussions in russia . 
   i 've heard it all now no . 
  not really . 
  well , it 's sorta not the strongest possible response . 
  i did n't just said `` hrw sucks '' , but explained why i do n't trust that particular their report . 
  i would also love to hear your counter-arguments against the evidence cited in the two threads on / r/ukraina i linked to . 
  btw , hrw report contains other funny bits , like :  ukrainian authorities should order all their forces , ** including volunteer forces , to immediately stop using grads ** in or near populated areas , and insurgent forces should avoid deploying in densely populated areas so , in the opinion of hrw , pro-ukrainian volunteer forces have grads . 
  it 's such a pathetic article . 
  blah-blah-blad bad , unprofessional ua army randomly kill civilians with its stone age military technology . 
  i do n't know where to start : 1 . 
  there are around 500 killed ukrainian servicemen/members of volunteer battalions ( according to the list in ukrainian wikipedia ) and at least ~ 1000 ( i took the lowest reasonable estimate ) killed pro-russian militants . 
  so even if 800 civilians were killed ( this looks like an overestimation ) , it 's around half of killed combatants from both sides . 
  check nato bombing of yugoslavia -- ~ 1000 killed combatants , and at least 500 killed civilians . 
  or take [ 2003 invasion of iraq ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_iraq ) . 
  or take the current gaza war . 
  it 's just a large-scale , intensive conflict , thanks to russia the ` rebels ' armed with heavy artillery , tanks and grads , and sadly civilian deaths are inevitable against well armed enemy . 
  it seems that these guys without much doubt attribute most if not all of civilian casualties to the actions of ukrainian army . 
  while of course ua army killed some civilians ( and some of their servicemen with friendly fire ) , no doubt that majority were killed by the separatists . 
  kidnappings , murders , killing people on checkpoints , mining everything with anti-personnel mines ( forbidden in ukraine ) , etc. , etc. 
  but probably the most lethal was their terrorist tactics to intentionally shell residential areas with mortars and grads to put the blame on ua army . 
  while it 's widely supported by [ the available ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukraina/comments/2c4maz/%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%82%d0%b5_%d0%bf%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82_%d0%b2_%d0%ba%d0%be%d1%82%d0%be%d1%80%d0%be%d0%bc_%d0%bc%d1%8b_%d1%81%d0%be%d0%b1%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%b8_%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%b7%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b5%d0%bb%d1%8c%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%b0/ ) [ evidence ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukraina/comments/2ar39b/%d0%be%d1%87%d0%b5%d0%bd%d1%8c_%d0%bd%d1%83%d0%b6%d0%bd%d0%be_%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%b7%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b5%d0%bb%d1%8c%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%b0_%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%be_%d1%87%d1%82%d0%be_%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%bf%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b8%d1%81%d1%82%d1%8b/ ) , while it 's the official version of the ua authorities , and most ua journalists -- i did n't see a single article in the western media about the issue , nobody even tried to at least investigate it . 
  then they uncritically repeat findings of the hrw `` report '' . 
  hrw ... fuck hrw , seriously . 
  i read their report , and it 's just a piece of garbage . 
  the only `` proof '' of ua guilt they got -- they found directions of the shellings . 
  in most of the cases they described ( i am not sure about maryinka shelling myself ) just having the direction of the shelling was not enough -- there were _ both _ ua and separatist forces in these direction . 
  for example , they found that pervaya ploschadka ( donetsk ) was shelled from the west on july 19 . 
  ok , look at the map , separatists controlled krasnogorovka 15km on the west from the pervaya ploschadka , minimal range of grad is 5 km , separatists were easily able to carry out that attack . 
  then they blame ua army for july 21 shelling of kuybushevskyy district of donetsk , while there are very good reasons that it was committed by separatists from avdiivka , e.g. 
  there is a video [ recorded that day at 12:00 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5jhx1a4t98 ) how grad positioned near to avdiivka shell in the direction of kuybushevskyy district ; locals [ immediately identified ] ( https://imgur.com/ac604bl ) that donetsk was shelled from avdiivka direction ( before the video was even published ) , and even pointed to yakovlevka ; the direction of shelling from the north is confirmed by the shells ( see e.g. 
  [ this article ] ( http://pauluskp.com/news/3830485f6 ) ) . 
  but nope , hrw ignored all and every piece of evidence and blamed for this attack ua army : `` human rights watch investigation on the ground strongly indicates that ukrainian government forces were responsible for the attacks that occurred between july 12 and 21 . '', 
  screened or not , it 's interesting to know how prevalent these views are . 
  if one idiot said something like that aloud , there are many thousands who think along these lines . 
  and considering comments i read on israeli news sites , `` many thousands '' is an underestimation . 
  not that it 's surprising for a country at war ( e.g. 
  during chechen wars , there were plenty of people who proposed to just kill all chechens ) , but it 's still a problem . 
  however anti-israel hysteria ( and this article of course will be used to fuel it ) is just as annoying . 
   sounds like vice or news republic would be your preferred journalistic style . 
  vice news is not a major news outlet . 
  yes , i think that simon ostrovsky probably is the best reporter on this war for non-russian/ukrainian speaking folks . 
  for russian-speakers local citizen journalists in twitter are still much better though . 
   i agree that these news outlets are n't doing in depth military analysis of the conflict each and every day . 
  well , in sloviansk after 2 month of war even some old ladies were able distinguish bmp from nona , while for these reporters every armored caterpillars vehicle still is a `` tank '' . 
  ok , apparently they do n't have to be military experts to report on a war , or even have any idea about military aspect at all ( seriously , you do n't need to be a military expert to distinguish a bmp from a tank ) , but they probably shine in other areas ? 
  maybe in covering deep political background , social and day-to-day life issues ? 
  nope , coverage of all other topics are just as bad and shallow as their coverage of the military aspect . 
   as for the ` united ' comment i think it 's fairly obvious that the nation is in fact not united , but is fragmented in civil war . 
  hardly a distorted view . 
  naming this conflict a `` civil war '' and is a prime example of a view distorted by all this reporting with `` rebels '' , etc. 
   well the bbc , reuters , guardian , independent , times , itv etc all are reporting on the ukraine situation and have reporters on the ground i opened the bbc site , the top report on ukraine is this thingie : [ ukraine mh17 : rebels ambush army convoy near crash site ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28599315 ) . 
  reported by tom burridge from kyiv . 
  nobody would argue that he reported it `` from the ground '' , however , this ground was more than 600km far away from the events he reported about . 
  the ambushed convoy was ~ 20km from grabovo , maybe from kyiv it looks `` near crash site '' , but for the conflict it 's not `` near '' at all . 
  then he retold official statements of ato press center and official twitter of dnr . 
  then a video fragment showing how an osce observer is returning to his car from a toilet , tucking his pants , few more videos of osce observers and ua military moving around . 
  this report is over . 
  then there is a report by a guy who actually visited shakhtarsk -- that 's good , however , his visit was absolutely useless -- few sentimental interviews with crying civilians , that 's all you can get from it . 
  he did n't say in a single word e.g. 
  why shakhtarsk is so strategically important for both ua army and `` rebels '' . 
  not a single word that `` rebels '' also have strong artillery in shakhtarsk ( including 120mm mortars , tanks , self-propelling 122m howitzers `` gvozdika '' , grads , etc. 
  ) , and that they happily shell the city with all this stuff . 
  in the end he makes the following abstruse statement : `` ukrainian forces are seems to be determined to retake the territory controlled by rebels , but no sign yet that they can unite the nation '' -- dude , maybe you should visit sloviansk or kramatorsk to get such a sign ? 
  or read the latest survey showing that the ukrainian nation is more united than ever ? 
  the report is over . 
  that 's basically is an example of very poor superficial reporting and non-existing analysis you are able to get only a very vague and distorted idea what 's going on in the area . 
   i ca n't recall a time where any of the newspapers/outlets have published a story which was complete bullshit with zero evidence or factual backing . 
  what about secret putin-merkel pact invented by the independent ? 
  they surely double checked this stuff . 
   maybe you need to start watching/reading different news outlets . 
  thanks , i am already doing this . 
  nope , these `` major news outlets '' 1 ) actually publish a lot of bullshit 2 ) do n't report noteworthy events at all , with or without `` double check '' . 
  in a result consumer of these `` major news outlets '' have more distorted world-view than persons who gather information from other sources , like non-mainstream or social media . 
  at least it 's true if we are talking about the situation around ukraine . 
  it only shows the pathetic state of these `` major news media '' . 
  it 's a sad state of affairs when you are able to get better information ( more correct , in-depth , etc. ), 
  from mashable and buzzfeed than from bbc or cnn .
