  invasion of georgia happened after western-backed saakashvili 's attempt to forcefully push russia out of south ossetia , recognition of independence of south ossetia and abkhazia happened after kosovo 's independence recognition , rt is much younger than radio free liberty , crimea happened after euromaidan ( with neither democratic and illegal removal of relatively pro-russian president ) . 
  russia has to do something against the expansion of us sphere of influence . 
  nato is a military alliance that was created against the soviet union , and the us made it clear that russia was not welcome in this alliance . 
  i do n't even see russian attempts to prevent its expansion as paranoia , it 's just common sense . 
  do putin really `` protecting russia from american imperialism '' ? 
  i am not sure . 
  but there is a broad perception that pro-western russian foreign policy in 1990s did n't do us any good ( even forgetting catastrophical fall of quality of life inside of russia ) . 
  a lot of was lost without gaining anything . 
  russia was basically excluded from world 's policy . 
  1990s were ended with kosovo , bombing of belgrad ( extremely humiliating for russia ) and very harsh rhetoric from the us/west after the start of the second chechen war . 
  in western press it was presented like an exampel of russian brutality and expansionism , russia was even sanctioned ( albeit lightly ) -- planned imf tranche and one more credit were canceled . 
  but i ca n't imagine any leader that would act in other way after the invasion of dagestan and bombing of apartment builds . 
  in that situation putin did what he must . 
  putin tried to explain his position [ in nyt op-ed ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/14/opinion/why-we-must-act.html ) , and i think he was honest . 
  pro-western foreign policy just did n't work . 
  maybe putin acts naughty , but he raised russian importance in foreign policy a lot . 
  considering `` american imperialism '' -- well , it 's just american level of domination gets to the point that it indeed looks like that the us is metropolitan country , while all other countries are colonies . 
  facebook , twitter , google , instagram , youtube , github , reddit -- all are american . 
  and they increasingly moving from being culturally neutral platforms into curated social networks that project american ideas on the rest of the world . 
  hollywood is american , all other national movie industries are puny in comparison . 
  even content created outside of us is dominated by huge us home market . 
  dice is a sweden company , but battlefield 1 has no france , but has the us . 
  polish witcher 3 creates backslash in the us for not having blacks . 
  campaigns like black lives matters leaks to countries that do n't even have similar problems . 
  technologies windows , os x , android , oracle are american and the us demonstrated that it 's easily going to use them to project power . 
  once again -- it 's just common sense that russia is trying to create independent infrastructure . 
   i could also say that creating an independent dpr-lpr is the russian goal and they failed because they signed the succesive minsk accords . 
  sure , and russia scrapped this `` goal '' ( it never declared ) right after being victorious and while it was advancing . 
  look , poroshenko declared ukrainian goal in this war multiple time -- to `` liberate '' whole ukraine , e.g. 
  [ president : we will fight for liberation of every ukrainian ] ( http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/mi-borotimemosya-za-zvilnennya-kozhnogo-ukrayincya-prezident-37573 ) . 
  they did n't achieve their military goals . 
   you ca n't say that oh these were just local volunteers but when the real russian army intervened the ukrainians were steamrolled . 
  this is a kindergarten level argument . 
  that 's exactly what happened , you are free to deny it as much as you want . 
  and ukraine lost territory along the whole frontier , not on just some region of it . 
  look at the map . 
  in mid-august ukraine almost encircled lugansk , it almost divided lnr from dnr . 
  and russian forces were not really that large , but they were enough to inflict fast and crushing defeat to ukrainian army that used all its arsenal , including aviation , tochkas , and smerches . 
   that glorious russian victory came because the ukrainians were blindsided . 
  yeah ... russian decisive victory was n't really victory , because of reasons ... because it was n't fair . 
  well , in case of a real invasion , it would not be fair either . 
  russia will outnumber ukraine , attack on poorly protected directions , encircle and destroy ukrainian forces as well . 
  i agree , there were violations and electoral fraud on the crimean referendum . 
  that 's why i did n't use the official results ( 97 % ) , which are fraudulent . 
  on the other hand ~ 90 % support for reunification are confirmed by practically every poll , including polls by western pollsters ordered by pro-ukrainian forces . 
  damn , a guy from the us no less , who said `` let 's fight now '' just one post above , says that nobody wants `` to invade you '' . 
  that 's just unbelievable that a guy from the country that invades other countries right and left has the nerve to be outraged by russian peaceful and democratic reuinification with crimea . 
   i suppose that 's the russian flag flying in kiev now ? 
  because russian military had no such objective . 
  it does n't mean they ca n't do this , if they were ordered to do . 
  there is no american flying over , i dunno , moldova either . 
   attack any light infantry force with tanks and you get the same result . 
  these `` light infantry forces '' lost 376 armored vehicles destroyed and 147 captured in august-september 2014 alone . 
  and russia did n't even use aviation , or missiles , or its best military stuff . 
  but they lost the war and had to sign minsk i after their defeat under ilovaysk , minsk ii after their defeat under debaltsevo . 
  they failed to achieve their military goals . 
  even war against the rebels proper was n't that easy for ukraine , and when they met with real russian units they _ were _ steamrolled . 
   better to fight now . 
  go on . 
  we will find a few square meters of russian land for every invader . 
  the west has interesting tradition -- to invade russia every hundred years or so . 
  the results [ are mixed so far ] ( http://imgur.com/a/2f9yc ) . 
  that 's just unbelievable . 
  did you even read minsk ii in 1.5 years ? 
  restore control of the state border to the ukrainian government in the whole conflict zone , which has to start on the first day ** after the local election and end after the full political ** regulation ( local elections in particular districts of donetsk and luhansk oblasts based on the law of ukraine and constitutional reform ) by the end of 2015 , on the condition of fulfillment of point 11 -- in consultations and in agreement with representatives of particular districts of donetsk and luhansk oblasts within the framework of the trilateral contact group . 
  well , it seems these are news for _ you _ . 
  no , these are the armored vehicles lost by _ both _ sides : http://lostarmour.info/analytics/ ukraine lost several times more vehicles destroyed and captured than dnr/lnr ( especially many _ captured _ vehicles that were abandoned by ukrainian army in various cauldrons , when ukrainian army run away ) . 
   hypothetical russian - ukrainian conventional conflict i thought russia invaded ukraine two years ago , no ? 
  but anyway , i assumed that after the battle of ilovaysk and the debaltsevo cauldron believers that ukrainian military can stand up to russian military should disappear . 
  but they still here and well !, 
  awesome . 
  these are some true believers . 
  no those are russians . 
  they will be scared by javelins and run away . 
  are you in denial or something ? 
   after the sanctions take its toll . 
  when is it going to happen ? 
  i just like to collect dates of inevitable russia 's collapse . 
  so you started to bring random stuff into discussion , okay . 
   little green men in crimea were clearly not russian paras , just crimean freedom fighters with latest russian weapons . 
  total coincidence free self-determination of people , sorry . 
  like in kosovo . 
  `` international law contains no ` prohibition on declarations of independence '' , as international court of justice ruled . 
   shooting down civilian airliner , total accident , fault of nazi jew homosex kiev junta . 
  yes , kiev had to close skies over combat zone -- and they did n't do this . 
  if a civilian plane is going to fly in combat zone with advanced sams deployed -- sooner or later it will be shot . 
  if you do n't believe me , read the official report by dutch safety board on ukrainian conduct . 
   must save oppressed minorities by bombings the shit out of them . 
  so donbass was bombed by russia ? 
  not by ukrainian military that tried to `` liberate '' their people via shelling them out of existence ? 
  interesting point of view . 
  it seems very few bad things in the world happen russia is not directly guilty for . 
   now oil is low again and can get even lower . 
  russian economy shrunk by mind-bogging 5 % !, 
  ok , according to the world bank forecast , it will start to grow again next year , but these 5 % will surely kill puny russia !, 
  russia will certainly collapse in n +1 year ( where n is current year ) !, 
   russia provides political and ** military support ** to pro-russian rebels let me know which word you did n't understand . 
  different people have different opinions ? 
  how dare they ? 
  no , crimea voluntarily joined russia in result of referendum .
