  turned out that 90 % of crimean population did n't want to live in your country even after 23 years of ukrainian independence . 
  sorry about this . 
  according to [ this article ] ( http://izvestia.ru/news/630516 ) , only 30 % districts had cameras on this elections . 
  chechnya had [ no cctvs at all ] ( https://www.gazeta.ru/politics/news/2016/08/26/n_9042845.shtml ) this year . 
  in the end he scratched `` vlk pnh '' ( it means `` vilkul , go fuck yourself ! '' ), 
  on the vilkul 's car . 
  of course . 
  it also would not be a big deal if the rebels would regain control over e.g. 
  mariupol , since russia is not in ukraine . 
  russia did n't invade ukraine , but russia provides political and military support to pro-russian rebels . 
  status : `` awaiting approval '' . 
  no progress , no movement since 2015 . 
   it 's not been that easy to make progress on this issue any problem is unsolvable , if you are not going to even try to solve it . 
  ukraine had to think about these problems before signing minsk ii . 
  there are pretty reasonable minsk agreements already . 
  instead of helping to implement them , these guys are flexing their military muscles and yet again are eager to use force against russian interests . 
  it would not end well , if they are really going to follow that path . 
  there was a good article in spiegel ( 2014 ) : [ war in ukraine a result of misunderstandings between europe and russia ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/war-in-ukraine-a-result-of-misunderstandings-between-europe-and-russia-a-1004706.html ) . 
  it was possible to find some reasonable compromise , but the eu decided to forcefully push their solution ignoring russia . 
  russia lives up to the minsk accord just fine , that 's ukraine is the side that locks any progress in implementation of minsk accords . 
  restore control of the state border to the ukrainian government in the whole conflict zone , which has to start on ** the first day after the local election and end after the full political regulation ** ( local elections in particular districts of donetsk and luhansk oblasts based on the law of ukraine and constitutional reform ) ** by the end of 2015 ** , on the condition of fulfillment of point 11 -- in consultations and in agreement with representatives of particular districts of donetsk and luhansk oblasts within the framework of the trilateral contact group . 
  constitutional reform in ukraine , with a new constitution to come into effect by the end of 2015 , the key element of which is decentralisation ( taking into account peculiarities of particular districts of donetsk and luhansk oblasts , agreed with representatives of these districts ) , and also approval of permanent legislation on the special status of particular districts of donetsk and luhansk oblasts in accordance with the measures spelt out in the attached footnote , [ note 1 ] ** by the end of 2015 ** . 
  `` by the end of 2015 . '', 
  2016 is close to its end , and no constitutional reform in ukraine happened so far , and ukraine is not going to do it in 2017 , or 2018 , or ever . 
  government put them up after large protests in 2011 , first time they were used on 2012 presidential elections . 
  according to wikipedia , there were 180.000 cams -- two on each electoral district . 
  on these elections most of them were removed . 
  these guys still do n't get it . 
  even after south ossetia , crimea and syria they still think that it 's a good idea to use military force against russia ( including arming and encouraging its enemies ) instead of negotiations . 
  the unlearnables . 
  wunderwaffe javelin will surely scare russia off :'), 
  `` put obama in the same situation and all bets are off '' . 
  but we are not in the same situation , that 's not some alternative history world . 
  comparing of putin with hitler , because he dares to protect russian interests against american neoimperalism , is just absurd and cheap propaganda . 
   parnas or yabloko exactly , opposition parties , but not united russia . 
  i saw these ads on youtube and twitter too ( especially parnas ' ads before sharij 's videos ) , but it sorta shows that opposition in fact tried to mobilize its voters . 
  tried , but failed . 
  it should be similar to gaussian on some simple election models and simulations . 
  it also fits well with empirical data from a lot of real elections from all over the world -- if electoral region is homogenous enough , of course . 
  this works in russia as well . 
  distribution in 2011 in moscow was far from gaussian and there were other indicators of fraud . 
  but since then it was gaussian-like in moscow on every election -- on presidential elections 2012 , on moscow mayoral elections 2013 , on legislative elections in 2016 . 
  see http://eugenyboger.livejournal.com/6579.html for some graphs . 
  * [ wciom 's exit poll ] ( https://wciom.ru/index.php?id=236&amp;uid=115870 ) ( whole russia ) -- 44.5 % for united russia * [ fom 's exit poll ] ( http://fom.ru/politika/12867 ) ( whole russia ) -- 48.4 % for united russia * actual result -- 54.2 %, 
  elections in chechnya in 2012 , electoral district with 99 % turnout , 100 % for putin ( cctv ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxf-nrtdvgq this year cctvs in chechnya were removed . 
  i think significant part of population distrust the election results . 
  there were large protests in moscow after the last elections ( in 2016 there was no significant electoral fraud in moscow , maybe to avoid angering people ) . 
  but surprisingly , [ according to levada 's polls ] ( http://www.rbc.ru/newspaper/2016/08/23/57b9c2fd9a79474fe46237bf ) , trust to elections increased with time . 
  31 % expected fraud on elections in 2011 , 13 % expected fraud this year . 
  low turnout was most likely result of calculated move by united russia 's electoral technologists than conscious boycott or anything else . 
  the elections were moved from december to september , while it was known beforehand that turnout in september would be lower than in december ( every single general legislative election in russia so far happened in december ) . 
  the tv was relatively silent about the elections , there was not much advertisement of it . 
  every vote matters in general constituency , not just positions in local region . 
  and the results were already lowered a bit to be less obvious . 
  in 2011 there was 99.5 % turnout and 99.5 % for united russia in chechnya , while this year they are at 95 % / 96 % . 
  this peak on voting distributions in saratov region : http://imgur.com/a/9gasv, 
  shpilkin ( mentioned in the article ) published the graphs of votes/turnout distributions per region on his google drive : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0byfmnunpilrinmhaulzoufjteda it 's very easy to see the pattern . 
  some regions have good gaussian-looking distribution ( moscow , st. petersburg ) . 
  united russia gets ~ 40 % there . 
  there are regions with badly skewed distributions , united russia gets 50-60 % there . 
  and also there are regions like chechnya or mordovia that play in the league of their own . 
  both are right . 
  there is no contradiction between these two claims . 
  russia is not going to attack a nato country , because all despite all the western propaganda putin is not crazy , and in non-nuclear war against nato , russia will be squashed . 
  nor he is a modern-day hitler or some expansionist psychopath . 
  actually , russian ambitions were pretty modest so far . 
  even in ukraine russia did n't recognize independence of dnr and lnr , or even took control over the whole donbass ( dnr/lnr control less territory than at the beginning of this war ) . 
  but in extremely unlikely case in which russia attacks lithuania , nothing is going to save it . 
  preparation for repelling alien invasion or asteroid impact event would be about as much cost effective . 
  reasonable foreign policy would be much better shield for lithuania . 
  populists = charismatic politicians we for some reason do n't like . 
  no , when one party is much more popular/has much stronger administrative resource than other parties , it 's going to get disproportional amount of seats from single-seat constituencies even without cheating . 
  that was the primary reason why it was reintroduced this time -- 2007 and 2011 elections did n't use it . 
  and with cheating ... 
  ~ ~ 198 ~ ~ edit : 203 \\ . 
  203 single-member constituencies out of 225 total goes to the united russia so far . 
  united russia had its candidates in 206 constituencies , so it lost in just 3 constituencies . 
  is n't it amazing ? 
  according to pre-election prognoses , the ur was going to to get 140-180 single-member constituencies . 
  but it surpassed even the wildest expectations . 
  what a twist . 
  and according to preliminary results based on 32 % of votes , the ur is getting 52 % in the multi-member constituency so far . 
  better than any pre-election poll or exit-poll , including wciom 's exit-polls ( 44.5 % ) . 
  what a twist . 
  kprf is the main russian communist party with its eternal leader zyuganov . 
  communists of russia is a spoiler party with logo confusingly similar to kprf and crazy program `` 10 stalin 's blows to capitalism '' . 
  you can guess its contents . 
  in st. petersburg according to exit-polls liberal opposition parties received actually good results ( up to 15 % yabloko , ~ 8 % party of rost , few percents parnas ) , but in the end it does n't really matter . 
  the united russia gets constitutional majority in duma thanks to reintroduction of mixed 50/50 system of single-member constituencies , that greatly helps to leading parties . 
  +80 ( approximately ) seats since the previous elections . 
  even more than projected . 
  :') sure , joint action . 
  there were 11 polish divisions , and 2 `` ukrainian '' divisions created in poland by your puppet . 
  it was approximately as `` joint '' as nazi invasions -- `` alliance '' of invaders and local collaborators . 
  moreover -- poland invaded belarusia and minsk as well , going as far as to polotsk ( that had just few percents of poles ) . 
  moreover -- you did n't create independent states on the territories you managed to grab . 
  you just annexed them and started to polonize their population . 
  they did n't even receive autonomy . 
  so overall it 's pretty insane that poland whines that the soviet union returned polish land grabs to their rightful owners in 1939 , just one year after poland did the very same thing with czechoslovakia . 
  sure :') simply as that .
