  we should have left hundreds of thousands jews to nazis to make poles happy . 
  innocent noble poland would never do anything like that . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kiev_offensive_ ( 1920 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93czechoslovak_border_conflicts#annexations_by_poland_in_1938 poor poland never did anything wrong , it always was attacked by evil ruskies for no reason at all !, 
  the most hilarious thing is that some poles _ really believe _ this bullshit . 
  interesting version of history . 
  poland got cities like rivne that had only very small minorities of poles ( 7 % according to 1897 census ) . 
  for some reason the poles think that we should have left territories mostly populated by ukrainians and jews to nazis -- it would be fair in their mind . 
  yes . 
  148 persons were convicted in russia in 2014 for distribution of porn via internet . 
  https://zona.media/article/2016/03/01/codex-242 only 5 of them got jail time , the rest got suspended sentence . 
  it includes both people torrenting and people who published videos in vk . 
  russian alternatives are under pressure as well . 
  youporn.ru changes its domain for the second time to evade blocks , vk started to ban porn groups , 2ch . hk had to hide its erotic boards to avoid filtering . 
  it 's a torrent tracker -- and that 's the problem . 
  every user of it is a distributor of porn with all the unfortunate legal consequences . 
  while it 's extremely unlikely that you will be prosecuted for that , but it 's still possible if you was born under unlucky star . 
  and their shills claimed that the river always looked that way . 
  article in chinese with some investigation about this company http://www.eeo.com.cn/2016/0902/291512.shtml ( google translate is good enough to understand it in general terms ) . 
  it 's a company with authorised capital hk$ 10 000 and small office in hong kong . 
  official press-release http://www.antonov.com/news/478 :  on august 30 , 2016 , antonov company included into ukroboronprom sc and aerospace industry corporation of china ( aicc ) signed cooperation agreement on the an \u2212 225 programme . 
  that 's not aviation industry corporation of china ( that 's not a mistake or mistranslation either ) . 
  the difference is like between adidas and abibas , nike and nikke . 
  maybe it 's some serious deal between real serious parties that decided to use dummy company for some reason , i do n't know . 
  but so far everything looks extremely dodgy . 
   ukraine is now reviving its production with chinese cooperation . 
  antonov will produce 0 planes in 2016 ( 8 new planes were produced in 2012 under bloody dictator yanukovich , 2 in 2014 ) . 
  revived production , my ass . 
  in comparison , russia produced 170 new planes last year alone , plus almost 300 helicopters . 
   but i can see that some shills who in 2014 and 15 were extatic about prospect of antonov filing for bancrupcy are now not happy when antonov is signing large financial deals . 
  they did n't sign any contract , that 's just one more meaningless memorandum , useless piece of paper , signed with `` aerospace industry corporation of china '' . 
  try to find this organization in wikipedia . 
  that must be a serious organization , if they are going to mass produce an-225 , the largest plane in the world , right ? 
   local networks work only as long as all your friends are from your country , but good luck getting someone from abroad to register in some `` obscure '' site in a weird language , and have them actually use it . 
  you do n't have to force anybody to use your platform , you can register in more than one social network . 
   if there 's anything `` your '' map shows , then it is how disconnected russia and china are from the rest of the world . 
  dream on about isolation of russian . 
  russian social networks vk and odnoklassniki are leading networks not only in russia , but in other countries as well , pretty much in the whole ex-ussr , except baltic states . 
  and there are not one , but two popular russian social networks -- odnoklassniki and vk ( and facebook is popular as well ) . 
  i guess it shows that russia is disconnected from russia or something like that . 
  that 's not just about language . 
  russian search-engine yandex managed to get 5 % market share in turkey in several years . 
  i am not aware if any eu-based search-engines even exist . 
  they have some extremely arbitrary rules on nudity ( fb com/communitystandards ) :  nudity  people sometimes share content containing nudity for reasons such as awareness campaigns or artistic projects . 
  we restrict the display of nudity because some audiences within our global community may be sensitive to this type of content -- particularly because of their cultural background or age . 
  in order to treat people fairly and respond to reports quickly , it is essential that we have policies in place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily when reviewing content . 
  as a result , our policies can sometimes be more blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for legitimate purposes . 
  we are always working to get better at evaluating this content and enforcing our standards . 
   we remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in on fully exposed buttocks . 
  we also restrict some images of female breasts if they include the nipple , but we always allow photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with post-mastectomy scarring . 
  we also allow photographs of paintings , sculptures and other art that depicts nude figures . 
  restrictions on the display of both nudity and sexual activity also apply to digitally created content unless the content is posted for educational , humorous or satirical purposes . 
  explicit images of sexual intercourse are prohibited . 
  descriptions of sexual acts that go into vivid detail may also be removed . 
  the eu brought it on themselves . 
  they had capacity to create their own social media platforms , but did n't do it , preferring to rely on foreign american services . 
  no sympathy to them . 
  reddit is a us site btw , europeans are just guests here . 
  exhibit 1 . 
  map of sovereign nations and american client states : http://vincos.it/world-map-of-social-networks/, 
  he was arrested for article 148 part 2 , it 's only related to actions committed in the places of worship . 
  it 's far more severe ( up to 3 years ) than part 1 ( up to 1 year ) . 
  he did nothing else in churches , except playing pokemon . 
  so yeah he was arrested for playing pokemon go in church , both de facto and de jure , not matter what bullshit the investigative committee is trying to invent . 
  that post badly needs byline from south park -- `` this is what some consumers of anti-russian propaganda actually believe . '', 
  `` stealing territory from a new country ( first moldova , then georgia '' -- could you please read history of these conflicts before saying stupid things ? 
  wikipedia would be a good start : * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria_war#background * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria_war#outside_involvement * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_in_abkhazia_ ( 1992 -- 93 ) russia imposed economic blockade on abkhazia , it was lifted only in 2000s . 
  stealing land , my ass . 
  `` then ukraine '' -- we did n't _ steal _ anything . 
  crimea voluntarily joined russia after the referendum with over 90 % of public support . 
  crimean people have free will , they are not personal toys of ukrainian nationalists in kiev . 
   this may sound cheesy , but the west does n't do disinformation . 
   http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2014/03/putin-war-propaganda-exposed-same-pro-russian-actress-used-in-five-different-ukrainian-reports/ ah , i see , reliable sources . 
  low-resolution jpegs are the best weapons against russian propaganda . 
  :') these are at least two different persons on these screenshots -- maria tsipko and yelena danilchenko ( and the woman in kharkov is probably the third one ) . 
  both are ukrainians . 
  none of the videos were created by russian tv , 5 is a ukrainian tv channel owned by poroshenko , danilchenko [ was also interviewed by vice news ] ( https://youtu.be/aqhezus9_ey?t=210 ) . 
  yeah , ukrainian on ukrainian and western tv -- putin 's war propaganda/10 . 
   anyway , the significance of this video , in which the fighters burned a dutch flag , is that it was released around the same time a referendum was going to take place in the netherlands , regarding ukraine being allowed to sign the eu association agreement . 
  this video was thoroughly debunked by the goods folks over at bellingcat . 
  it proved the video itself was fake and that russian trolls began a concerted campaign to spread the video on the web actually , i ca n't find in google news a single article in russian media that covered that azov-netherlands fake -- with two exceptions . 
  article on pro-separatist site news-front '' [ cheap ukrainian fake : azov threatens the netherlands with terrorist acts ] ( http://news-front.info/2016/01/19/deshevyj-ukrainskij-fejk-azov-ugrozhaet-teraktami-niderlandam/ ) '' , and on [ tv zvezda ] ( http://tvzvezda.ru/news/vstrane_i_mire/content/201601200547-ofj5.htm ) that mentions it 's a likely fake . 
  however , it was widely covered by ukrainian media -- as a proven `` russian fake '' :d that said , i would not trust anything produced by cyberberkut -- they are serial fake generators . 
   propaganda watch : listen to two russians badly impersonate cia spies to pin mh17 on u.s. 
  it was published in tabloid komsomolksaya pravda that usually writes about ufos and stuff . 
  `` komsomol truth '' ) is a daily russian tabloid [ 1 ] '' . 
  for example , news from today -- [ ufo destroyed musk 's space x ] ( http://www.spb.kp.ru/daily/26577.5/3593020/ ) . 
  why do the foreign policy care about bullshit in local russian tabloids ( that do n't even have english version ) -- i have no idea . 
  overall , that 's some intensive cherry-picking . 
  even if russian media uses more deliberate fakes than its western counterparts , its amount is still negligible in comparison to reporting of real stories . 
  all media have their biases and narratives -- russian , ukrainian , western , just the set of their beloved propaganda tools is a bit different . 
  great interview , some answers are pretty much spot on . 
  on syria :  i am simply sure and i get this confidence from the events of the last decade , specifically the attempts at democratizing iraq and attempts at democratizing libya . 
  we see that in fact led to the collapse of statehood and the growth of terrorism . 
  where do you see elements of democracy in libya ? 
  maybe they will emerge eventually , i very much count on it . 
  or the continuing civil war in iraq . 
  and what will happen in general with iraq in the future ? 
  so far these are big questions . 
   it 's the same with syria . 
  when we hear that assad should go , for some reason someone peripheral [ someone from outside the country ] thinks so , i have a big question : what will it lead to , will it be in line with international legal standards and what will it lead to ?
