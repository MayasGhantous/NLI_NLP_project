  also , the united russia will easily have stronger representation than in current duma due to reintroduced 50/50 single-member constituencies system that favors stronger parties . 
   never heard of google , huh ? 
  google can be a bad advisor , if you have no idea about the problem . 
   and fyi , just because someone speaks russian as their native language does n't mean they 're ethnically russian . 
  sure , but you should not stop there . 
  if people self-identify as ukrainians , it does n't mean they want to live in ukraine , it does n't mean they are not pro-russian , it does n't mean they give a single fuck about united ukraine . 
  actually , surveys of crimean population demonstrated that majority of people self-identified as ukrainians [ supported reunification with russia ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/03/20/one-year-after-russia-annexed-crimea-locals-prefer-moscow-to-kiev/ ) :  in june 2014 , a gallup poll with the broadcasting board of governors asked crimeans if the results in the march 16 , 2014 referendum to secede reflected the views of the people . 
  a total of 82.8 % of crimeans said yes . 
  when broken down by ethnicity , 93.6 % of ethnic russians said they believed the vote to secede was legitimate , ** while 68.4 % of ukrainians felt so ** . 
  moreover , when asked if joining russia will ultimately make life better for them and their family , 73.9 % said yes while 5.5 % said no . 
  according to [ the last april-june 2016 opinion survey ] ( http://openopinion.ru/content_res/articles/oo_crimea_brief.pdf ) , 84 % of crimeans self-identified as `` ukrainians '' support reunification with russia . 
  it does n't fall off the cliff , and our gdp is going to grow the next year already . 
  and the thing you do n't understand that we are not afraid of you and your sanctions . 
  stronger sanctions would probably boost putin 's rating even more . 
  oh , cut the bullshit . 
  their `` eradicated '' language is one of the official languages of the republic of crimea and is more widely used in crimea than ukrainian language . 
  they returned back . 
  219k crimean tatars lived in crimea in 1939 , 246k `` eradicated '' crimean tatars lived in crimea in 2014 . 
  only 12 % of crimean population are crimean tatars . 
  and [ approximately half of them support reunificiation ] ( http://openopinion.ru/content_res/articles/oo_crimea_brief.pdf ) ( page 40 ) . 
  yes , animosity of crimean tatars against russia is heavily exaggerated by western media . 
  just like western-backed coup had no right to remove legitimate president , change constitution , and do a lot of other things it had no legal right to do . 
  but the west carefully selects what rights it wants to protect , violation of what rights it wants to ignore , and what rights it 's going to violate itself . 
   i just hate this lie so much . 
  you are just in denial . 
  crimea has russian majority [ for the last century at least ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_crimea#ethnicities_and_languages ) . 
  and it had russian majority during all its ukrainian period of history , from 1954 to 2014 . 
   yes , but how do you know that they are pro-russian without a legitimate referendum ? 
  there is a weird mysterious thing called opinion surveys , you know . 
  of course , ukraine knows pretty well that crimeans do n't want to get back to ukraine , that 's why it 's strongly against any referendum there . 
  did you read your own fucking link ? 
  it 's just unbelievable that some drones upvoted you , while your words directly contradict to your source . 
   a joint survey by american government agency broadcasting board of governors and polling firm gallup was taken during april 2014 . 
  [ 249 ] it polled 500 residents of crimea . 
  the survey found that ** 82.8 % of those polled believed that the results of the crimean status referendum reflected the views of most crimeans ** , whereas 6.7 % said that it did not . 
  73.9 % of those polled said that they thought that the annexation would have a positive impact on their lives , whereas 5.5 % said that it would not . 
  13.6 % said that they did not know . 
  [ 249 ]  a comprehensive poll released on 8 may 2014 by the pew research centre surveyed crimean opinions on the annexation . 
  [ 250 ] despite international criticism of 16 march referendum on crimean status , ** 91 % of those crimeans polled thought that the vote was free and fair , and 88 % said that the ukrainian government should recognise the results ** . 
  [ 250 ] these numbers were confirmed few days ago by new large opinion survey of crimeans . 
  79 % crimeans polled participated in the referendum -- that 's turnout higher than in brexit . 
  88 % support reunification with russia . 
   even now many crimeans genuinely believe russian speakers are severely oppressed everywhere in ukraine though it 's utter bullshit . 
  typical ukrainian denialism . 
  there were a lot of protests in crimea against attempts of kiev to ukranize crimea , for example [ this one from 2009 ] ( https://lenta.ru/articles/2009/05/28/mova/ ) or [ this one from 2005 ] ( http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/71241/ ) against ukrainization of schools , but you know better than crimeans of course . 
  that 's such inane western propaganda . 
  okay : * there was no genocide in kosovo , not even american wikipedia claims such things , [ un court confirmed that there as no genocide back in 2001 ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1530781.stm ) . 
  at most there were a number of war crimes committed by both sides and ethical cleansings committed by both sides : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_crimes_in_the_kosovo_war `` genocide '' in kosovo was just a propaganda tool of the west to justify its aggression . 
  just like the wmd shit in iraq . 
  or crap about `` moderate '' rebels in the syrian civil war . 
  * humanitarian intervention ( even if we 'll take this western bullshit at face value ) does n't excuse ripping part of serbia without its consent 10 years after the war . 
  milosevic was long time gone in 2008 , it was entirely possible to integrate kosovo back -- with significant autonomy , guarantees , etc. 
  this path was n't taken . 
  * russia likes not land , but people -- 2 million russians who live in crimea and never agreed on government created by anti-constitutional illegal western-backed coup . 
  people of crimea overwhelmingly support joining russia -- ~ 90 % support or strongly support reunification with russia . 
  unlike kosovo , there was no significant number of refugees from crimea after russian . 
  it 's likely that russian intervention in crimea prevented humanitarian catastrophe and thousands of deaths -- sadly , russia did n't follow this path on donbass . 
  fast russian intervention in donbass would have saved ~ 10000 lives . 
  * crimea was not annexed either . 
  it declared its independence and then joined russia . 
  there is no difference either from legal pov or moral point view ( of course , it was in interests of crimea to join russia instead of staying as independent dwarf state -- for no reason whatsoever , just to please the west ) . 
  the west just invents silly superfluous _ ad hoc _ reasons to make it look different . 
  south osetia , transnistria and abkhazia were not accepted by russia ( while it 's certainly would be in best interests of said countries ) , but are not recognized by the west anyway . 
  russia will never turn into the north korea . 
  we have everything and we can produce everything with our own in-house tech . 
  yes , please . 
  so far these sanctions work very nice . 
  government finally took their head out of ass and started to make our infrastructure independent from western blackmail . 
  indeed , russia protects its own interests , not interests of its neighbors . 
  same shit . 
  escalate ? 
  that 's fine . 
  to what point do you want to escalate it ? 
  to mariupol ? 
  to kharkov ? 
  to kiev ? 
  or maybe to lvov ? 
  the last time the things got `` escalated '' -- exactly two years ago , the northern wind blew out the whole ukrainian military on all directions in a few days with just low gentle whisper . 
   is the west supposed to do ? 
  the west is supposed to fuck off . 
  and that 's what it 's already doing actually -- nobody is going to follow advices of / r/europe 's red scare wet dreamers and escalate the conflict . 
  the west has no legitimate interests in crimea and donbass , areas with population that overwhelmingly support russia . 
  actually , according to [ the latest poll by iri ] ( http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/2016-07-08_ukraine_poll_shows_skepticism_glimmer_of_hope.pdf ) , even part of the eastern ukraine still controlled by ukraine still supports joining russian customs union instead of the eu , and both the south and the east of ukraine are against joining nato . 
  and that 's after years of anti-russian propaganda by kyiv-controlled media . 
   except for the part were they did n't fucking invade a sovereign country illegally . 
  the maidan coup was violent , illegal and anti-constitutional . 
  people of donbass never agreed on that new illegal government . 
  even ukrainian soldiers admit that majority of donbass locals support russia . 
  absolute majority of rebel forces are locals , absolutely majority of ukrainian forces are not local . 
  ukrainian soldiers from the western ukraine are the invaders , not the locals who are trying to defend their homes . 
   they also do n't use child soldiers for reals ? 
  you have quite selective vision . 
  [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30134421 ) : `` child soldiers appear to be playing a part on ** both sides of the conflict ** in eastern ukraine . '', 
  tsn.ua : '' [ andrey romanyuk from vinnitsa went to war in 16 ] ( http://ru.tsn.ua/video/video-novini/andrey-romanyuk-iz-vinnicy-v-16-let-poshel-na-voynu.html ) '' . 
  a few months after this enthusiastic report the very same andrey romanyuk tried to rob petrol station and murdered two ukrainian cops . 
   mass murder civilian plane passengers hmm . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siberia_airlines_flight_1812 president of ukraine apologized in this way : `` we are not the first , nor we are the last . 
  do n't make a tragedy out of it . 
  mistakes happen everywhere , and of much larger scale . '', 
   they 've very much got the moral high ground in this conflict and get to occasionally mess up yes , like volunteer battalion tornado with pedophile 5-time convict onizchenko .
