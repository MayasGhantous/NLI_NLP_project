  or nazi regiment azov . 
  the most amazing thing about it that the ukrainian nationalists are still in denial the photos were staged . 
  check / r/ukraina . 
  they even attacked sergei loiko , russian war photographer who contributes [ to the la times ] ( http://www.latimes.com/la-bio-sergei-loiko-staff.html ) and enthusiastically supports ukrainian military in this conflict -- he even wrote a book about the siege of donetsk airport . 
  his interview about the donetsk airport to echo msk was considered extremist by russian authorities . 
  but they still attack him , because he had the nerve to call out muravsky , to call these obviously staged photos staged . 
  loiko says he never in his career received that amount of insults and threats , ukrainian nationalists managed to one-up even russian nationalists . 
  lol . 
  \\ ^ this typical consumer of western propaganda , drone . 
  he left long suicide note to his relatives , he was depressed , he had severe financial problems ( to the point that he had to sell his car and home to pay debts ) . 
  ukrainian authorities launched criminal proceedings qualifying the case as suicide . 
  10/10 assassination by putin . 
  why is putin so evil ? 
  murdering journalists nobody heard about in the heart of ukraine . 
  it 's so funny how much you are trying to attack or insult me in some way , but you have no idea where to bite . 
  because i never proposed weighting sources . 
  it 's straw man in its purest form . 
  after consuming only the most honest western media in the world , you have to use propagandist tools even in casual conversation , heh . 
  if you do n't have enough of input ( like , two full-blown opposing opinions on the problem ) , you just do n't have enough of data to apply critical thinking . 
  gigo . 
  well , you are free to watch only the most honest western news that comply to your confirmation bias and continue to live in your bubble . 
  rt still produces tons of great footage . 
   rt has earned their reputation , even russians admit that . 
  admit what ? 
  rt is directly subsidized by russian government , and it 's sorta supposed to express russian point of view on international policy and influence the international audience . 
  it 's written in its organization charter . 
  it would be very strange if they would do something against our national interests . 
  sure , it 's propaganda , it 's supposed to influence opinions first and foremost . 
  just like your media . 
  lol , dream on . 
  the truth is , you ca n't do shit against us without hurting yourself more . 
  rt has a lot of propaganda . 
  they publish tons of quality footage too . 
  look who is talking . 
  the most honest western media . 
  i liked how they kicked out babitsky from the radio free liberty , because he supported self-determination of crimean people in fb post and then filmed footage with exhumation of civilians killed by ukrainian so called `` volunteer battalion '' aydar ( in fact -- gangs of murderers , looters and rapists ) -- without any comments , just video , and interviews of locals . 
  he was n't even an ordinary journalist . 
  he had been working for the rfl since the soviet union , and covered tons of important events . 
  in russia he was considered a traitor for his sympathetic coverage of chechen rebels , he even interviewed basaev after beslan . 
  putin himself called him a traitor , said that babitsky worked for enemy and that his actions were more dangerous than firing from machine-gun . 
  babitsky was detained by fsb and then transfered to chechens -- without his consent . 
  he had been the editor-in-chief of `` echo of caucasus '' , rfl subdivision in georgia . 
  and he was immediately kicked out from liberty/freedom just for an attempt to show the another side . 
  i recently read freedom-liberty project on crimea , and it 's pure unadulterated propaganda . 
  they report only negative news from crimea . 
  if the news are positive , they should be twisted in some negative way ( `` yes , the kerch straits bridge most likely will be built :( ( ( but a lot of money will be stolen !, 
  and it 's useless anyway !, 
  it 's all just putin 's ego ! '' ), 
  check e.g. 
  [ `` economic realities of crimea ( infographics ) '' ] ( http://ru.krymr.com/a/27695075.html ) . 
  they report raised prices comparing to ukraine 2013 , but `` forget '' to report raised income . 
  russia spends more than ukraine on crimea -- but it 's twisted in negative way , now crimea is more `` subsidized '' . 
  they source the number of tourists in russian crimea on some claim of _ ukrainian _ ex-minister , instead of official crimea stats ( note -- it 's fine to not trust the crimean official stats on tourism , which are likely inflated , it 's not fine to present claims of random biased guy as facts and sneakily mixed them with data based on russian official stats ) . 
  they claim the unemployment rate raised 5x ( ! ), 
  in crimea since `` annexation '' -- for fuck 's sake , they compare numbers calculated using different methodologies !, 
  if you 'll compare [ apples ] ( https://ukrstat.org/operativ/operativ2013/rp/rp_reg/reg_r/rbn_2013_r.htm ) with [ apples ] ( http://www.gks.ru/bgd/free/b04_03/isswww.exe/stg/d06/37.htm ) -- the unemployment rate basically did n't change at all . 
  overall i ca n't find a single real non-twisted fact in that info-graphics . 
  i do n't see how this propaganda is any better than the rt propaganda -- actually rt 's propaganda generally has much higher quality . 
  somehow integration to moldova or romania does n't look appealing for the people of transnistria : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistrian_independence_referendum,_2006 i wonder why ? 
  who in their right mind do n't want to join countries as successful and prosperous as moldova or romania ? 
  these `` whistleblowers '' were serial dopers , and when they were caught they ratted out all their accomplices . 
  from 2015 wada report :  with mokhnev 's full knowledge and counsel , stepanova took a number of different prohibited performance enhancing substances . 
  in 2010 , stepanova heard rumours that she had tested positive . 
  however , mokhnev advised stepanova that he had spoken with moscow laboratory director , grigory rodchenkov , and it was agreed that stepanova would pay 30,000 roubles ( approximately $ 1000 at that time ) to rodchenkov to cover up the positive test result . 
  this payment was paid directly by stepanova to one of rodchenkov 's friends , a person with the last name `` evsukov . '' stepanova informed the ic that as a result of the payment , rodchenkov reportedly called mokhnev on the same day as the payoff , to report that stepanova no longer had to be concerned about the positive test . 
  the west got some awesome new citizens . 
  and of course they fear for their lives . 
  because putin wants to assassinate them . 
  sure . 
  most of people died on the east of ukraine , died in result of ukrainian military activity . 
  because they think that using mlrs and cluster munitions ( including 300mm smerch ) in densely populated areas is an awesome idea . 
  also , ukraine is a country that demonstratively ignores its obligations under the minsk agreements , it had to introduce decentralization in its constitution by the end of 2015 . 
  the end of 2016 is drawing close -- they did nothing and they are not going to do anything . 
  mh-17 is a terrible tragedy , but it was an accident . 
  it was n't a deliberate act . 
  just like e.g. 
  tu-154 shot down by ukraine in 2001 . 
  ukraine had to close skies over the war zone and russia had to instruct its servicemen properly . 
  we care about opinion of the crimean population . 
  we do n't give a fuck about _ your _ public opinion . 
  we had to ban [ chegin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viktor_chegin#athletes_coached_by_chegin_and_banned_for_doping_offenses ) and others much earlier . 
  instead of it sport authorities supported and continue to support athletes and coaches caught on doping . 
  i 'm impressed with performance of our team . 
  there was so many bs about doped russians , cheating russians , there was cold war amount of dirt poured on our athletes . 
  1/3 of our team was barred from competition , including people like isinbayeva , who was never caught on doping in her very long career . 
  and in the end we got the same 4th place as in 2012 -- yes , with less medals than in london , but anyway . 
  most likely , we had no chance to move to 2nd or 3rd place even without bans . 
  so he moved from svoboda to poroshenko party since 2013 , while he still have svoboda everywhere in his social media profiles . 
  that 's why you called me a liar . 
  well , okay . 
   use this old manipulation on someone else my dear liar . 
  well , so far the only objection i heard from you - that this guy recently moved to a richer party from svoboda . 
  that 's somehow makes him less biased and makes his research more sound . 
  as far as i can see you do n't have better objections . 
  the national review is one of the most influential american magazines ... 
  even if you do n't take its articles at face value , a lot of people will . 
  it 's telling that they provide tribune to whackos . 
   that said , the ryazan incident has been discussed by far more than the national review . 
  ryazan incident is nothing . 
  there were no explosives and no real explosive device .
