  the same person who erroneously detected explosives at scene , failed to detonate it few hours later . 
  are you mentally unstable or something ? 
  that 's just not normal to accuse people of lying at 100 % random , without any knowledge of subject matter . 
  however , that 's nice that you did n't disagree on other points . 
   insinuating you know the reasons why they were murdered . 
  well , conspiracy theorists should prove connection of these murders with 1999 bombings , not i should disprove it . 
  anyway . 
  litvinenko and politkovskaya were killed in 2006 , that 's a bit too late for cover-up . 
  yuschenkov and shchekochikhin are more relevant , because both were members of kovalyev 's commission on apartment bombings in 2002-2003 . 
  however , not even other members of the commission linked their deaths with the commission . 
  yuschenkov was n't an important member of the commission , and he was most likely murdered due to his conflict in berezovsky 's party `` liberal russia '' ( it was n't the only murder there , golovlev from the `` liberal russia '' was murdered in 2002 ) , while shchekochikhin was a investigate journalist and had plenty of other enemies . 
  by the way sergei kovalyev is still alive and well , and live in russia , just like all other members of the commission . 
  the commission did n't find anything of value , and at most kovalyev claimed he have no direct evidence , but [ `` some involvement of russia secret services is pretty likely '' ] ( http://www.bbc.com/russian/russia/2009/09/090909_explosions_10_years.shtml ) . 
  that 's sharply different from the national review 's `` the evidence is overwhelming that the apartment-house bombings in 1999 in moscow , buinaksk , and volgodonsk , which provided a pretext for the second chechen war and catapulted putin into the presidency , were carried out by the russian federal security service ( fsb ) '' , which is pure unadulterated bullshit , because such evidence simply does n't exist . 
   it is also a bit rich you claim conspiracy theorists are `` fucking idiots '' yet that is what most russian news media revolves around . 
  conspiracy theories in the national review show very well that your news media is not any better than us . 
  yes , russian media also uses conspiracy theories when it 's convenient for them ( mh-17 ) . 
  it does n't blame the us for 9/11 though . 
  so there is still some room to fall to the level of your media . 
  could you please point out , where exactly i lied ? 
  anyway , i am not going to whitewash the crimes of the stalin regime and communists . 
  nor am i going to non-critically agree with all the xenophobic anti-russian bullshit generated by ukrainian nationalists . 
  estimates like 20.000 killed or 120.000 killed are based on exactly nothing . 
  if you read ukrainian , you can read yourself the article on dneproges by moroko , and his reasoning about his estimate ( 20.000-30 .000 ) : http://istznu.org/dc/file.php?host_id=1&amp;path=/page/issues/29/moroko.pdf he just pulled it out of thin air basing on amount of all people in the area . 
  no documents , no nothing . 
  just take a random number 0 < n < n , where n - total amount of people in the area ( much larger than flood zone ) . 
  local historian vladimir linikov [ avoids any estimates ] ( http://retro.zp.ua/life/event/439-podryv-dneprovskoy-plotiny-18-avgusta-1941-goda.html ) and compares destruction of dneproges with destruction of dams during the operation chastise that killed 1600 -- and his opinion is just as good as morokov 's one . 
  you can assume anything that 's convenient to you . 
  for example , [ baburova and markelov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anastasia_baburova ) were killed by russian neo-nazis . 
  according to vladislav moroko , who just happened to be a member of far-right anti-semitic party `` svoboda '' . 
  totally unexpected conclusion from a reliable source . 
  we do n't care if it will be turkish stream or nord stream 2 . 
  ukraine is going to lose its gas transit anyway . 
  big difference !, 
  at first look it looks like any crazy conspiracy theory , but in this case we have ** mysterious deaths \u00a9 \u00ae \u2122 ** . 
  wow !, 
  it makes it so unique and so different from other conspiracy theories !, 
  fsb just kills everyone !, 
  wait . 
  trepashkin is still alive and still lives in russia . 
  andrei nekrasov is still alive and visits russia without any problem . 
  there must be something wrong . 
  other guys : * yushenkov was murdered by [ kodanev ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9a%d0%be%d0%b4%d0%b0%d0%bd%d1%91%d0%b2,_%d0%9c%d0%b8%d1%85%d0%b0%d0%b8%d0%bb_%d0%9d%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b0%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%b8%d1%87 ) , who was close to berezovsky ( good guy , political refugee protected by the uk ) . 
  according to kodanev , the assassination was directly ordered by berezovsky . 
  * politkovskaya was killed in 2006 , 7 years after the bombings . 
  not even her colleagues claimed that it had anything to do with bombings . 
  the caught killers said that they received order from zakayev and berezovsky ( two good guys in the uk ) . 
  * targeted killing of litvinenko happened in 2006 , 7 years after the bombings . 
  well , you probably expected roses for this ex-fsb traitor . 
  nothing really points out that his removal had anything to do with his `` investigation '' . 
  he wrote his bullshit book `` blowing up russia : terror from within '' in 2001 , 5 years before his death -- fsb must be a bit of slowpoke . 
  it was never conclusively proven that he was murdered . 
  there were even less signs that it had something to do with his `` investigation '' . 
  overall , as usually in ** mysterious deaths \u00a9 \u00ae \u2122 ** conspiracy theories , there is not a single bit of evidence that those deaths had anything to do at all with bombings of apartments . 
  and it 's the best proof conspiratards have -- all others are even less convincing . 
  conspiracy theorists are fucking idiots . 
   every crime in russia , ever , always chechens . 
  \\ #freejahar \\ #justice 4jahar  who even needs investigators . 
  we have investigators , stupid conspiratard . 
  and these investigators found who exactly committed these terrorist acts . 
  there were not just chechens . 
  gochiyayev and dekkushev were karachai , ibn al-khattab was born in saudi arabia . 
  there were plenty of terrorists acts committed by non-chechens . 
  the bombings in volgograd in 2014 were committed by dagestani . 
  nevsky express terrorist act was organized by [ said buryatski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/said_buryatsky ) , a buryat , who was radicalised late in his life . 
  some terrorists were ethnic russians . 
  that 's certainly the same nooscope , but it was probably written by one of vajno 's co-authors . 
  now i am sad . 
  it would be great to cut electricity costs . 
  yes , that 's exactly what 9/11 truthers claim . 
  https://wikispooks.com/wiki/9-11/premature_death it 's not different in case of the apartment-bombings . 
   one is much more plausible than the other . 
  which one ? 
  the one that nuclear weapons do n't really exist , and it was just a hoax by soviet and us governments ? 
  or the one that oil companies kill off tesla followers ? 
  i am all ears . 
  bull . 
  crap . 
  there is no unsolved mystery . 
  you can visit wikipedia and read all the names of perpetrators and details of their attack . 
  it 's approximately as `` unsolved '' as mystery of 9/11 or jfk . 
  of course you can just read report of the 911 commission or sites like historycommons to get minute-by-minute timeline . 
  or you can fantasize about the third bullet and claim that the mystery is unsolved , because jet fuel ca n't melt steel beams . 
  all these conspiracy theorists conveniently forget that just 1 month before the apartment bombing the chechen islamists invaded dagestan and started to chop off the heads of russian conscripts , killing overall up to 300 persons in dagestan . 
  they conveniently forget that chechen islamists committed multiple terrorist acts before and after the apartment-building bombing . 
  for example , [ march 1999 bombing in vladikavkaz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_vladikavkaz_bombing ) that killed 62 , that 's half-year before the apartment-building bombings . 
  inclusion of ryazan incident is just funny , because de-miners were not able to explode that `` hexogen '' - it contained no explosives . 
  the weird thing about that even state-controlled russian tv does n't promote conspiracy theories about 9/11 , while in the west even serious press like the national interest still pushing that conspiracy crap . 
  i consider these conspiracy theorists not only anti-putin , but , quite frankly , anti-russian . 
  they are supposed to show that russian counter-terrorist operation in chechnya was n't justified , that it was just one more example of russian expansionism , brutality and savagery . 
  no , it was completely justified . 
  chechnya was a failed state in 1999 , it had islamist terrorist training camps on its territory , and maskhadov ( president of chechnya ) declined to do anything against them . 
  we had no other choice , but to use military force . 
  i doubt that even authors of this `` nooscope '' have any clear understanding about it . 
  in one of [ the vaino 's ( or whoever really wrote it ) presentations ] ( http://studydoc.ru/doc/4699730/proekciya-neba-na-zemlyu ) nooscope is just a single-board computer based on freescale i.mx35 and linux 2.6.38 . 
  overall , in my understanding , it supposed to be some super-surveillance device to track and analyse [ noosphere ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noosphere ) - the sphere of human thought , a term from [ russian cosmism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_cosmism ) . 
   i believe a liberal change in ukraine is for the absolute best maybe , but there is nothing liberal in the rule of corrupt oligarchs , rampaging nationalism , hate-mongering against russians , worshiping to st. bandera and nazi battalions . 
  liberal parties are not very popular in ukraine , actually . 
   i wholeheartly welcome them into the eu and hope they embrace a liberal government system while the rebels are crushed you are free to welcome whatever you want -- it 's not going to happen . 
  that 's nothing more than your power fantasies -- to crush people who absolutely do n't want to live in ukraine and who do n't want to be associated with ukraine in any way or form .
