  lol . 
  tell the crimeans that they are occupied by somebody . 
   ukraine is perfectly well entitled to do whatever it takes to remove the russian invaders from their land . 
  well , good luck to them . 
  i am afraid they will be removed themselves , if they 'll try to do it . 
  yes , he told the whole story about that fight . 
  it was sanctioned by the ukrainian authorities btw . 
  we are not funding terrorists . 
  we support rebels in donbass , just like the west supports bearded islamist rebels in syria . 
  our rebels do n't chop off children heads though -- that 's the only difference . 
  blatant lies like the `` yarosh business card '' ? 
  two years later yarosh admitted the story was true , the right sector indeed attacked sloviansk checkpoint during truce . 
  russian media were telling truth from the very start , while ukrainian media since the very beginning cried about russian fsb provocation . 
   sounds more like russia preparing a storm on mariupol . 
  i am sure it looks exactly like that for the western and ukrainian propaganda . 
  of course , we were able to easily take mariupol back in 2014 if we wanted to -- when it had almost no defense . 
  but propaganda does n't care about such details . 
  you need to somehow explain shooting , two dead russian servicemen and captured ukrainians . 
  oh yeah , fsb shot themselves ( ukrainian excuse n1 ) and panov was kidnapped from ukraine ( yeah ... , it 's very realistic , kidnap some entirely non-important guy when he was going to meet his comerades-in-arms ) . 
  so far the accusations are very serious and seems to be true . 
  there were rumours about shooting and ukrainian subversive group since august 7 . 
  then a large-scale manhunt happened , even the border with ukraine was closed . 
  officials did n't confirm anything until yesterday , journalists were getting information only from informers and locals ( the locals heard the shooting ) . 
  two russian guards were killed when they tried to detain the groups . 
  according to kommersant , the captured leader of the group ( panov ) already confessed that they were going to commit terrorist acts in russia -- without civilian casualties , but to scare away tourists . 
  according to ukrainian media , panov is a veteran of the donbass war , who was very upset by the loss of crimea . 
  he told his family he was going to meet with his army buddies and disappeared . 
  so far , the russian version of the event looks far closer to the truth and the observable events than the ukrainian . 
  i am not sure that he was an agent of ukrainian intelligence -- it 's entirely possible it was just a bunch of crazy nationalists on their own -- but it 's within the realm of possibility . 
  scale of the operation , they had two separate groups , up 15 persons , hints on the governmental involvement . 
  pro-putin folks have 100 % flexibility of conscience , they can do u-turns in no time , 1984-tier . 
  they still doubt in erdogan 's honesty , suspect cia antics , but praise putin 's wisdom . 
  so ... why is it any bad ? 
  these power plants are needed to improve quality of life of the crimeans . 
  do you want to punish the crimeans ? 
  well , you are going to achieve nothing , because crimea is russian and will be russian . 
  it will just make the russians more isolationist and more hostile to the west . 
  and of course , these stupid sanctions are being circumvented . 
  and of course europe knows about it , but turns a blind eye on the violations . 
  do you think that the crimeans do n't play in pokemon go , or that the russian mobile network operators are not available there ? 
  it does n't . 
  we 've installed underwater power cable to mainland russia + crimea has internal energy generation + some temporary mobile power plants were installed there . 
  all these sources fully cover crimean needs in electricity . 
  two new power plants in crimea are in the process of construction . 
  because it is politics . 
  there is no other reason why kosovo is allowed , while abkhazia or dnr are not . 
  or why crimea clubs are not allowed in uefa . 
  congrats to serbia with its first gold !, 
  they did n't lose all their advertisers and viewership . 
  major cable and satellite providers were _ forced _ to remove dozhd from their packages . 
  please , cut the bullshit , really . 
  there is no freedom of press in russia on any reasonable metric , it 's just silly to argue otherwise . 
   nevertheless , the usada is very low in my list of respected organizations anyway , they had no incentive to cover-up a russian athlete and still considered her testimony credible and honest . 
  yes , but it 's still not fair . 
  yefimova doped by a mistake , she bought wrong supplement basing on recommendation of a salesperson . 
  her intake of this supplement was very brief , just 1 week . 
  doping panel ( not russian , us doping panel , because she lives in the us ) [ agreed with ] ( http://www.swimvortex.com/wp-content/uploads/efimova_decision.pdf ) her proofs that it was an honest mistake , that she used it briefly , and that he had no intention to improve her performance using 7-keto dhea . 
  she was banned for negligence for 16 months that passed since then . 
  why is she banned from rio , while justin gatlin caught on doping _ twice _ is allowed , and still lying about it ? 
  both live in the us , what 's the difference ? 
  they also have nice rudimentary pre-crime via sexual risk orders http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-36481127, 
  bandera was liquidated during the khrushchev thaw , so his assassins hardly were the `` very bad guys '' in comparison to bandera . 
  at least they did n't commit any ethnocides . 
  ukraine had plenty of time to disband azov that brings ukraine into disrepute . 
  they did n't do anything . 
  azov was upgraded to regiment from battalion and got tanks instead . 
  nowadays azov 's design bureau develops [ new two-turret tank ] ( http://twower.livejournal.com/1939377.html ) and have [ number of exciting wunderwaffe projects ] ( http://twower.livejournal.com/1983034.html ) . 
  they are whitewashing upa crimes right in the article about `` anti-ukrainian sentiments '' in poland . 
  recognition of volhynia massacres as genocide is considered an example of anti-ukrainian sentiments for some reason . 
   on july 3 , a ukrainian rock band was banned from entering poland despite having done so 20 times before . 
  [ i wonder why ? 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/rnh4k ) i mean , bandera was such a nice guy , what not to like about him ? 
  no wonder , ukraine is full-on in denial and full-on whitewashing their `` freedom fighters '' . 
  google translate of the lead section of '' [ volyn tragedy ] ( https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%92%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%bd%d1%81%d1%8c%d0%ba%d0%b0_%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b3%d0%b5%d0%b4%d1%96%d1%8f ) '' in the ukrainian wikipedia :  volyn tragedy ( in polish historiography floor . 
  rze\u017a wo\u0142y\u0144ska , `` volyn massacre '' ) - mutual ethnic cleansing ukrainian and polish population , made ukrainian insurgent army and the polish army with polish battalions schutzmannschaft ( 107 , 202 ) [ 1 ] , and soviet partisans [ 2 ] in 1943 , during world war ii in volyn . 
  part of the polish-ukrainian conflict during world war ii , or b. vyatrovych `` second polish-ukrainian war '' [ 3 ] . 
  in a broader sense , part of the centuries-old ukrainian-polish conflict in western ukraine - volyn , galicia , kholm , podlasie nadsyannya , lemko . 
   the aim of actions of ukrainian nationalists in volyn was primarily a desire to prevent future claims of the polish government on the land ( as it happened after the first world war ) . 
  in addition , loyalty to the upa population was potential support for germany and the ussr . 
  at the beginning of summer 1943 , the strength of upa in volyn were , according to various estimates , from 3 to 5 thousand fighters , and end of the year reached 8-12 thousand . 
  according to the records of upa commander `` klim savur '' ( dmitry klyachkivskyy ) , in january-february 1944 , there were 6920 persons upa [ 4 ] . 
  instead , polish partisan divisions in the region numbered only 1,300 soldiers , about 3,600 armed men acted in self-defense bases . 
  polish police shuts-in the service of the nazis who participated in the `` pacification '' of ukrainian villages of approximately 2,000 people , 202 polish battalion `` garnet '' of the police , who arrived with the general governorship , totaled - 360 people [ 5 ] . 
   in traditional polish historiography biased perceived as ethnic cleansing exclusively polish population ; in ukrainian - like `` action in response to '' the atrocities poles about ukrainian civilians . 
  this topic is far more studied by polish historians dealing with this problem from the end of world war ii . 
  [ 6 ] the works of polish historians tends to exaggerate the polish victims [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] by impairing ukrainian victims , counted the dead ukrainian at the hands of the poles as poles were killed by ukrainian [ 13 ] and included among the polish victims of other people part even of polish nationality who died in very different circumstances that had to do with to volyn tragedy . 
  [ 14 ] ukrainian historians mostly began to explore this topic after ukraine 's independence . 
  and the rest of the article spends approximately the same amount of words on polish and ukrainian crimes . 
  it even looks like that upa mostly fought against nazi accomplices , while the poles carried out punitive operations ( `` poles destroyed 5 ukrainain villages for every destroyed polish village '' ) . 
  it 's not some fringe view , the article reflects mainstream ukrainian point of view well . 
  the ethnic cleansing was mutual , ak is just as guilty as upa and so on . 
  well , none of ex-ussr countries ( excluding baltic states ) are doing great -- except resource-rich countries . 
  belarus is doing better than many of them . 
   they are still a largely manufacturing economy , but the competitiveness seems to be based on just that - cheapness , and not quality . 
  belarus exports significant amount of it services for example . 
  significantly more than ukraine or russia per capita . 
  he uses a stick , it 's possible he is an old guy , it explains his slow reaction . 
  he also looked in another direction when the explosion happened . 
   belarus is a strange beast as russia has been paying them 15 % of their gdp ( or more ) every year just to buy one friend . 
  well , that 's some crazy bullshit .
