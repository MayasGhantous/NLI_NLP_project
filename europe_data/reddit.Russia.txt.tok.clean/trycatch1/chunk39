  numbers straight out of your ass . 
   they 're still shitty as is russia . 
  look who is talking . 
  you probably should visit st. petersburg or moscow and compare them with your country . 
  they are not great , but they are [ far better than ukraine ] ( https://www.google.ru/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;idim=country:blr:ltu:lva&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_kd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:blr:ltu:lva:ukr:rus:est:pol&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) . 
  and ukraine had better starting conditions in 1990 . 
  cctv video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biv2gkue6jo, 
  in europe . 
  just saying . 
  yushchenko awarded the title of hero of ukraine to bandera back in 2010 ( and shukhevych in 2007 -- both awards were annulled during yanukovich 's presidency ) , stepan bandera monument in lviv was completed in 2007 . 
  so bandera-worshipping in ukraine is not that new . 
  plus raising nationalism and logic `` russian propaganda attacks bandera =  he must be good '' . 
  they are also basically in denial of `` volhynia massacre '' , calling it `` volyn tragedy '' and promoting view that it was a two-sided ethnic war , in which the poles/ak were just as guilty as the ukrainians/upa . 
  moscow is a city . 
  if they hate _ a city _ ( the largest in europe btw ) , they 've got a problem . 
  russia has a lot of kiev placenames -- nobody even think about renaming them , it would be too silly even for russia . 
  they also renamed suvorov street in kyiv today -- it had that name since 1902 . 
   sz\u00e9ll k\u00e1lm\u00e1n t\u00e9r ( sz\u00e9ll k\u00e1lm\u00e1n square , formerly between 1951 and 2011 moszkva t\u00e9r or moscow square ) is a square in budapest . 
  well , it makes sense , it was just renamed back to its historical name . 
  moscow street in kyiv got its name in 2004 ( it was red cossacks street before ) , so it was n't even some soviet leftover or anything . 
   despite war , despite europe 's crisis of faith , no price is too high for ukrainians to become a better nation . 
  brexit or not , crisis or not , war or not , we will go the way of eu integration . 
  which means : more fairness and respect , less corruption and post-soviet absurdity . 
  yeah . 
  they renamed moscow street in kyiv to bandera street today . 
  they are getting closer to europe with every passing second :'), 
  it 's not that simple https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:nationalities_in_second_polish_republic_ca._1931.png, 
  yes . 
  it 's generally explained by necessity in the history textbooks i am aware of . 
  polish territories captured by the soviet union are referred to as western ukraine and western belarus . 
   wrong , but i do n't know a way to explain it better probably because before explaining anything you need to understand it yourself . 
   direct democracy word `` direct '' is unnecessary , your arguments are generic for any democracy . 
  maybe you just do n't like democracy . 
  people were not asked about technicalities they ca n't realistically understand . 
  they were asked about their self-determination , and it 's a basic human right , that has very little to do with economics or foreign policy . 
  they did n't vote on economics , they did n't vote on base rate of interest . 
  using your analogy it 's like the right of a patient to decide if they want treatment proposed by a doctor . 
  `` idiot orangutan '' johnson knows latin and ancient greek , and also speaks several other foreign languages , as far as i remember . 
  lol . 
  a pretty bad day today , gosduma adopted several new bad laws , including the one that forces isps to store all traffic for 6 months , and some shitty anti-cryptography amendments . 
  but at least good news from abroad , we have the largest russian geopolitical victory for a while . 
  i hope the sanctions will be gradually removed . 
  the same minister said that 1 ) the russian nation has additional chromosome 2 ) that he is concerned about `` asian , cosmopolitical '' faces in russian cartoons . 
  this guy is annoying . 
  he is also involved in some muddy stuff . 
  thing that bothers me the most are the anti-cryptography amendments . 
   lawmakers have proposed a simple mechanism for fighting encrypted data : require the `` information-distribution organizations '' that use `` additional coding '' of electronic communications to provide the federal security service ( fsb ) with the information that will allow them to `` decode '' the information . 
  `` organizers '' that refuse will be fined as much as 1 million rubles ( more than $ 15,000 ) . 
  the legislation is worded to make it clear what kind of `` additional coding '' the authors have in mind : encrypted chat messages and any website that uses the https protocol . 
   the draft law would also introduce an administrative statute prohibiting the use of `` uncertified means of coding ( encryption ) for the transmission of messages on the internet . '' fines will be as high as 40,000 rubles ( $ 615 ) and police will have the right to confiscate any illegal means used to commit the offense . 
  if they want to ban telegram ( one of the few recent internationally-recognised brands that originated from russia ) , that 's just stupid . 
  also these amendments are overly broad . 
  i ca n't find katyn mentioned anywhere in the zagladin 's textbooks , maybe in newer editions . 
  other textbooks mention it . 
  i do n't really remember , it was long ago . 
  i checked out modern edition of zagladin 's schoolbook that was used in our school -- it 's a pretty polished and cursory version of russian history : * molotov-ribbentrop pact . 
  soviet union had to do this , because it did n't trust to the western powers after munich , because poland did n't want agreements with the soviet union , japanese threat , etc. 
  * germany _ attacked _ poland , then , when the soviet union saw that the polish army was unable to defend itself , the soviet army _ entered the western ukraine _ and _ the western belarus _ . 
  * 14 june 1940 the soviet military under pretext of protection the baltic states from aggression _ entered _ their territory . 
  estonian , lithuanian , latvian leaders run away and communists replaced them . 
  they were proclaimed as soviet republics and acceded to the ussr . 
  * soviet union gathered military on the border of romania and _ achieved _ transferring bessarabia to the ussr . 
  and so on . 
  there was another textbook , better and more detailed , but i ca n't find it now . 
  30 % - due to pressure from the soviet union , 10 % - due to secret agreements between stalin and hitler . 
  also there was an interesting poll about russian-ukrainian relations recently . 
  source : http://www.fontanka.ru/2016/06/16/141/ also we got kadyrov 's bridge today despite all the protests . 
  medinsky ( minister of culture ) in response to people cited stalin who protected mannerheim -- something along the lines `` do n't be holier than stalin '' . 
  peskov ( putin 's pr person ) said that yeah mannerheim is controversial , but `` he is an extraordinary person , he has relation to our history , and his role will be studied by historians for a long time '' . 
  even on loyal pro-kremlin websites people 's reaction is like `` wtf ? '' . 
  moscow just piss in st. petersburg citizens 's face , they know very well they can get away with anything . 
  his twitter is comedy cold . 
  he is so outraged by the travesty of justice -- all the detained people were innocent , nobody participated in the clashes in marseille or on the stadium , etc. 
  interesting that he said that the injured english person soon will be declared dead -- probably that 's how the french side explained them why they were detained . 
  small step for france , but a great victory for ukraine -- all ukrainian groups celebrate . 
  which is sorta strange , because these news have nothing to do with ukraine at all . 
   thats why many people , including me , consider russia biggest evil that has happened here . 
  that 's pretty understandable considering the role of your collaborators in the holocaust . 
  not many like to recall dark spots of their history . 
  almost all the jews in estonia/lithuania/latvia were murdered by germans with enthusiastic help of locals , but in modern baltics it 's no biggie comparing to bad bad evil stalin who deported some people considered disloyal during the greatest war in human history . 
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_holocaust_in_lithuania * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_holocaust_in_latvia * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_holocaust_in_estonia, 
  eu commission also wanted to limit the freedom of panorama . 
  russia would be annihilated by the media for the same amount of fuck ups as france with euro 2016 . 
  remind me what was wrong with our organisation of the olympic games ? 
  an olympic ring did n't go on ? 
  paired toilets ? 
  russian gdp is still falling , of course the government ca n't raise pensions at the rate of inflation . 
  it was just a funny sequence of words that went viral . 
  putin would get away from this question with his ordinary vague promises he has no intention to fulfill , while medvedev answered straightforwardly and got shitstorm . 
  without any doubt i consider medvedev the best russian president ever , there was another atmosphere with him . 
  moscow already has kadyrov 's street ( and grozny has putin street ) . 
  now it 's our time to name something , _ anything _ in the memory of kadyrov . 
  the city government pushed for kadyrov bridge very strongly through the city toponymic commission , but 6 members voted against it anyway ( 9 for , 6 against , 2 abstained ) . 
   i 'd like to know more about the karelian fortifications . 
  i know we had the mannerheimm line to stop the russians but i didnt know there was anything similar on the other side ( one questions is that why would the soviet union have anything since attack war was planned ? ), 
  the whole site dedicated to it : http://www.kaur.ru/ ( in russian , but google translate should be enough ) . 
  map of the 1941 positions on the karelian isthmus http://imgur.com/98mvcd9 , the red line is the border of 1939 . 
  they were afraid that finland will be allied with one of the great powers -- britain , france or germany . 
  exactly like it really happened in the end . 
   i 'm not saying that he was some kind of saint , do n't get me wrong on that .
