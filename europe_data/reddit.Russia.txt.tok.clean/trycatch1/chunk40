  sure . 
  i am not saying that he is a villain or something . 
  it 's just different nations have different heroes . 
  the finns advanced as far as they were able to advance . 
  on the leningrad direction they were stopped by the karelian fortified region , on other directions [ they were able to advance much further ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_military_administration_in_eastern_karelia ) , far beyond the 1939 borders . 
  mannerheim was a fan of the greater finland idea , on the conquered territory he immediately renamed russian-sounding settlements to make them finnish-sounding and sent local russians to [ concentration camps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/east_karelian_concentration_camps ) , many of whom died . 
  mannerheim was not a good guy , at least for russia , and _ especially _ for st. petersburg , but someone in moscow is crazy determined to commemorate him here . 
  moscow also pushing to install a memorial plate to carl mannerheim somewhere in st. petersburg . 
  they already installed it last year , but backtracked in the last day before the opening ceremony . 
  pretty controversial , considering his role in the siege of leningrad . 
  but at least mannerheim has something to do with st. petersburg , unlike kadyrov . 
   the law bans people from sending abusive communications . 
  this is generally a good thing ( people sending death threats really should be investigated ) you do n't need special internet law against death threats . 
  you already have [ such law since 1977 ] ( http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/vict/24-25/100/section/16 ) :  a person who without lawful excuse makes to another a threat , intending that that other would fear it would be carried out , to kill that other or a third person shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years . 
   things get investigated by the police ( the people in question are usually released quickly after being arrested and it never goes to trial ) it 's not required to arrest just to investigate things . 
  `` usually '' / `` minority '' / `` generally '' - i wonder if you are basing claims on some reliable data , or just pulling stuff out of your ass . 
  how is it a strawman if the labour party and the snp mostly opposed anti-isis airstrikes in syria ? 
  in september 2016 , according to the latest promises . 
  it 's not high enough . 
  it has just 52m of clearance in its highest point , it will block some large ships from st. petersburg , especially sailing ships with their tall masts . 
  it even caused some controversy . 
  western rapid diameter + commieblocks gives some half-life 2 feel : http://imgur.com/a/6itdj,

  i do n't know anything about him . 
  maybe he just was angry at russian government , sympathised ukraine and reposted various stuff from ukrainian groups he was subscribed to . 
  the baltic states really should shut up in this situation , considering their own dismal record of prosecution people for dissenting opinions . 
  physician , heal thyself . 
  especially latvia that [ recently jailed a guy ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-latvia-russia-iduskcn0vz267 ) for [ this joke internet petition ] ( https://secure.avaaz.org/ru/petition/obrashchenie_ko_vsem_zhitelyam_latvii_sbor_podpisey_o_vstuplenii_latvii_v_sostav_rossiyskoy_federacii ) calling latvia for joining russia . 
  the petition even mentioned that it was just a joke in its text -- unlike the person discussed in this thread who was dead serious . 
  i do n't remember any discussion of that latvian case in / r/europe though . 
  sova center ? 
  no , it 's a good organization from what i see . 
  [ wiki-article about them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sova_center ) . 
  they are mostly doing monitoring and analysis , not activism or promotion of their views . 
  they monitor both racism/xenophobia/extremism in russia and crackdown on dissent under the veil of anti-extremism by the state . 
  1 ) you need to publish something extremist or inciting hatred to go to jail . 
  just being an offended estonian does n't count . 
  2 ) it was n't just a picture of toothpaste . 
  that 's the original post he reposted : vk.com/wall-72278108?day=04042016&amp;offset=15120&amp;w=wall-72278108_479279%2fall from the ukrainian nastup , no less . 
  it 's a batshit crazy community of ukrainian nationalists , they celebrate every time civilian russian plane crashes . 
  the post included text that was considered `` fascist '' even by some members of this community . 
  other members responded that there is nothing wrong with fascism . 
  that 's impartial objective neutral western reporting for you . 
  it 's a well known case , it was n't just a `` picture of a toothpaste '' , it had byline with call to `` actively destroy russia '' -- `` like the chechens back then '' . 
  not even sova center ( ngo specializing on extremism and unlawful prosecution of `` extremism '' in russia , mentioned in the ap report ) considers his conviction wrongful , with the only exception -- sova center considers that he should not be prosecuted for his position on crimea , and that 's all . 
  except you did n't read the minsk agreements . 
   russia just killed another bunch of ukrainians . 
  that means you have not left the ukraine . 
  no , that does n't mean it . 
  do you realise that dnr and lnr have significant armies of their own ? 
  they have two army corps , for god 's sake . 
  they have tens thousands of men , hundreds of tanks , artillery , mlrs . 
  they do n't need russian army in every single minor clash . 
  you said bunch of ukrainians were killed . 
  ok , that 's unfortunate . 
  but do you realise that dnr and lnr soldiers are being killed daily in the very same way ? 
  it 's a war , it 's mutual killing . 
  it 's just american ambassadors or western media are not going to talk about them , even when significant number rebel fighters are being killed by ukrainian army in a single incident . 
  yes . 
  we mostly implemented our part of the minsk agreements , currently that 's kyiv does n't want to do their part ( point 11 - changing the consitution , [ elections in the dpr and the lnr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minsk_ii#elections_in_the_dpr_and_lpr ) ) . 
  there were no significant escalations on donbass for more than a year , except small clashes . 
  casualties dropped drastically : * [ destroyed military vehicles timeline ] ( http://lostarmour.info/analytics/ ) * [ ukrainian military casualties timeline in 2015 ] ( https://imgur.com/znchges ) * one more timeline based on different sources http://memorybook.org.ua/indexfile/statmonth.htm, 
  while i much prefer medvedev , putin is not that bad . 
  there are far worse options . 
  he still has moderately liberal people around himself -- like kudrin , gref and medvedev , he was an assistant of anatoly sobchak , who co-authored modern russian constitution ( his daughter is a tv personality and a notable opposition figure ) , putin even called himself a liberal . 
  putin is not a full-on stalinist , for example , he publicly admitted that katyn massacre was done by the nkvd , recently he signed some laws to help ngos that commemorate the victims of political repressions . 
  he is less nationalist than many others , he introduced `` hate speech '' article 282 and cracked down on many russian nationalist organizations , and even said that slogan `` russia for russians '' is supported only by idiots or provocateurs . 
  of course , there are a lot of things putin should be criticized for , but please ... comparison of russia with isis or putin with hitler are just entirely crazy and out of this world . 
  i am proud of vk -- right sector , azov , various crazy russia-hating nationalist communities like ukrainian nastup or \u03a8 we are patriots of ukraine \u03a8 still use vk , despite it 's a russian social network . 
  because they will be immediately banned in facebook for their conduct , while vk only blocks access to these pages from russia ( so you can use proxy to read them ) , and only if they were forced by roscomnadzor authorities . 
  ramzan kadyrov is a ph.d in economics ( [ candidate of sciences ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/candidate_of_sciences ) , to be more precise ) . 
  he also has legal education . 
  when he was asked about the topic of his diploma , he said that he did n't remember . 
  oh , i did the very same thing . 
  in the mpeg-4 era i copied full futurama to hdd , and played it in loop every time before sleep . 
  i read the same idiotic proposal for quotas in on-demand streaming services in russia just a few weeks ago , just a bit different quotas -- 80 % should be in russian , 30 % russia-produced . 
  it seems that our lawmakers take pages from each other . 
  well , at least torrents will not be quoted . 
  and at least they do n't introduce quotes in steam and gog -- yet . 
  confirms ? 
  it shows that the french journalists completely misinterpreted words of the old lady . 
  she never said anything about `` three migrants that replaced her '' in the russian report . 
  i agree that it was bs about the migrants in the school , but it seems that this time rossiya-24 admitted the mistake . 
   i only showed you all the other polls done at that time , i know you like to cherrypick the most suitable of those , but not all showed such results . 
  you are hilarious . 
  you blame me for cherry picking for citing english wikipedia , while you picked two completely worthless votings ( literally internet voting on a website ) for the only reason that they conform with your worldview . 
   p\u00e4rnu postimees writing of tns emor polling : 82 % of estonians supported government 's actions during relocating the monument , 84 % of russians opposed . 
  are you doing this on purpose ? 
  one more poll done _ after _ the events . 
  this one was done in 2-5 may . 
   so please , do n't try to even act like you know what 's happening in estonia or what estonians think . 
  oh , i am sure that watching estonian propaganda gives you a great insight into everything , better than results of opinion surveys could possibly ever tell and better than opinions of various international organizations . 
  i probably should say the same thing about your continuous whining about russia . 
  we do n't want [ ... ] anymore and just want him to ... '' ( at 5:47 ) so nothing in connection with `` we invested several thousand of euros just for our studies etc. . . '' whatever , i hear nothing . 
  it 's possible that rossiya-24 took relatively long interview ( several minutes ) and compiled it into one phrase . 
  they `` disproved '' one part of the interview with another part of the interview , instead of using the same part . 
  this is manipulation , plain and simple . 
   in this case , he also condamned the american propaganda about the islamist immigrants . 
  the only thing he forgot - to condemn his own propaganda . 
   did you remember the ukrainian child crucified propaganda from 2014 ?
