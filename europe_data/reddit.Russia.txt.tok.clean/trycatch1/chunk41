  oh , not this shit again . 
  this crucified child soon will be 2 year old , soon he will attend kindergarten . 
  give him a go already . 
  ukrainian tv produces shit like that continuously . 
   medvdev has the same foreign policy as putin wtf ? 
  of course , he did n't . 
  medvedev negotiated the reset with the us , he did n't block the un resolution on libya , which is a radically different from what russia usually does . 
  read the us ambassador to russia mcfaul :  a key event in domestic russian politics , mcfaul said , was former prime minister dmitry medvedev 's withdrawal from the russian presidential elections in september 2011 . 
  while russian president vladimir putin takes a zero-sum view of the world , seeing the united states as a competitor rather than a partner , medvedev had a win-win perspective , similar to obama 's , mcfaul said . 
   putin has a different mental model of the relationship between russia and the united states . 
  recently , mcfaul suggested , putin has used the u.s. to legitimize the falsified russian parliamentary election of december 2011 , which provoked massive protests , and as a means to legitimize his regime and counter dissent . 
  essentially , mcfaul said , the russian leader has `` resurrected '' the united states and its leadership as the enemy and stirred hatred of the west in his country . 
  response from rossiya 24 with original interviews : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmkgmng4pga it seems that _ le petit journal _ fucked up badly . 
   we killed you too https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_lithuania there is a nice graph . 
  the russian occupation was between 1944 and 1990 , independence -- from 1990 , do n't mix it up . 
  to kill the lithuanians more effectively russia even build a nuclear power plant there . 
   you wo n't find any respect from me thanks . 
  it 's probably a good thing . 
  i think you must be a bit confused . 
  the demolished memorial commemorated the people that kicked nazis asses , not your nazi collaborators . 
  you are probably talking about these guys : http://www.wiesenthal.com/atf/cf/%7b54d385e6-f1b9-4e9f-8e94-890c3e6dd277%7d/45-15.pdf ( look , the simon wiesenthal center is spreading russian propaganda !, 
  literally putinthal center ), 
   estonian tv debate show telephone polling : 80 % for relocating . 
  phone voting on tv show , seriously ? 
   estonia 's largest newspaper 's postimees : 83 % for relocating . 
  internet poll of a newspaper , seriously ? 
   saar poll : `` was relocating bronze soldier justified ? 
  '' : it 's the only real survey among all you mentioned . 
  however , the polling took place in 15-25 june 2007 , two months _ after _ the demolition of the memorial , while opinion poll by turu-uuringute as was done right before the events . 
  no wonder that public opinion changed after two months of `` objective coverage '' by estonian tv channels -- from 49 % of support in the ethnic estonian subpopulation to 79 % . 
  however , it 's a bit strange to blame russian tv for omitting the fact `` about majority of estonians supporting the relocation '' , because there was no such `` fact '' at the time of the demolition . 
   so it was clear vast majority of estonians ( ~ 80 % ) were for relocating the monument . 
  are you just in denial ? 
  because you have shown only two unscientific polls and one from the future . 
  it 's not like the page in english wikipedia has no links : http://epl.delfi.ee/news/eesti/eestlased-teisaldaks-pronkssoduri-venelased-mitte?id=51084542 it also mentions one more survey done 1 month before the riots -- with the same results . 
   they conveniently ommitted any facts about majority of estonians supporting the relocation ( the governing party 's popularity surged to nearly 50 % for a few months after the events ) \\* cough \\* \\* cough \\* on topic of omitting inconvenient facts , english wikipedia :  the idea of relocation was opposed by a majority among inhabitants of estonia . 
  according to an opinion poll ordered by eesti p\u00e4evaleht and performed by turu-uuringute as from april 5 through april 22 , 2007 37 % of respondents supported relocation of the monument , while ** 49 % were against relocation ** and 14 % had not formed any opinion on the subject . 
  relocation of the monument had slightly stronger support from native estonian speakers -- 49 % in favour of relocation -- while ** only 9 % of native russian speakers supported relocation ** . 
  [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] `` that the protests turned into most violent and destructive riots , '' -- maybe , just maybe that has something to do with ignoring opinion of significant part of your population ? 
  the girl at 1:48 said `` betrayed us '' , loud and clear . 
  and then she claims at 5:50 that she did n't say this and , moreover , she does n't even know how to say that in english !, 
  then to prove russian translation wrong they demonstrate _ her _ recording of the interview ( in english ) . 
  but for some reason they do n't air the whole recording from the beginning to the end , only her first phrase . 
  so to prove that the russians forged her answers in the interview , they show _ another _ part of the same interview . 
  wtf , seriously ? 
  do they treat their viewers like idiots ? 
  i also liked their random putin portrait appearing out of nowhere for no reason at all . 
  such subtle humor . 
  totally not a manipulative show . 
  i never use this tilting feature . 
  it 's dangerous for cats who can try to jump into the gap and hang themselves . 
  it 's not very useful either . 
  match-3 games . 
  the first match-3 game was _ shariki _ from early 1990s , then one of its clones was discovered by popcap developers that turned it into bejeweled . 
  huh ? 
  barter is a thing of the past , just like dollar transactions , there is nothing remotely similar to hyperinflation ( check definition in wikipedia ) . 
  it was a joke of economy . 
  hyperinflation , non-monetary transactions between enterprises , people using dollars for any barely non-trivial transaction , mass tax evasion . 
  it hardly was more diversified , russia exported the same oil/gas/metals back then as today . 
  it was so much better during 1990s before putin . 
  :') a truly diversified economy -- selling stuff for scrap , mafia contract killing , ponzi schemes , oligarch-controlled media . 
  i will be very lucky , because it 's the 3rd time you wishing me good luck . 
  what kind of source are you asking ? 
  i ca n't find a source for your vague incoherent strawmans , i ca n't find a source to prove that the song was `` good '' , because `` good '' and `` bad '' are subjective categories . 
  you doubt that youtube is a good measure of popularity ? 
  well , [ billboard and nielsen use youtube views ] ( http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1549399/hot-100-news-billboard-and-nielsen-add-youtube-video-streaming-to-platforms ) for their chart ranking :  the youtube streaming data is now factored into the chart 's ranking , enhancing a formula that includes nielsen 's digital download track sales and physical singles sales ; as well as terrestrial radio airplay , on-demand audio streaming , and online radio streaming , also tracked by nielsen . 
  but they are just rookies without enlightening wisdom of a guy advocating to occupy the kremlin on reddit . 
  it 's related directly to the quality of song , because it 's entertainment , _ popular _ culture , and _ popularity _ is the main benchmark of success for it . 
  youtube views is an indicator of its popularity , popularity demonstrate its success . 
  you are keep ignoring that not only youtube views show the outstanding popularity of this song -- but you just dislike objective reality and think that it 's smart to deny it . 
   / discussion you are keep doing it and saying `` good luck '' . 
  i think you are supposed stop `` discussion '' after this point and return back to pushing your agenda on reddit . 
   if i can dislike the song why ca n't the juries ? 
  _ anybody _ can dislike a song . 
  not matter how popular the song is , it 's going to have its detractors . 
  that 's why your ( or my ) personal opinion just does n't matter . 
  in this case , however , juries liked or disliked the song with alignment of `` party lines '' , perfectly matching geopolitics of their countries . 
  lithuanian jury disliked the song placing at # 25 , while belarusian jury liked the song placing it at # 1 . 
  there is no politics , it 's just an amazing coincidence !, 
   and , why should we tolerante intolerant people ? 
  that does n't look like progress to me . 
  intolerance shall be treated with intolerance . 
  i do n't know , why we should tolerate this intolerance on song contest . 
  in this case intolerance against contestant lazarev who on every occasion voices his sympathy to the lgbt cause . 
  but his political views do n't matter , though , it 's a freaking song contest . 
   so your whole argument is now your opinion is rule ? 
  my whole argument that you are deep in denial . 
  during the whole `` discussion '' with you , i never used my opinion as an argument , i only referred to objective metrics -- results of public voting , youtube views , charts , bookies . 
  you on the other hand referred _ only _ to your own personal opinions -- that the song was `` average '' , that the `` video lacked heart and emotion '' , and tons of other opinionated garbage like that . 
   / discussion good riddance . 
  back to searching something negative about russia ? 
  that 's the 3rd time you are repeating that you did n't like the song . 
  thanks , i got it from the very first time . 
  your opinion ( or my opinion ) is not an argument . 
  it 's an opinion . 
   i 'm not surprised they did n't get many votes . 
  then you should be surprised , because it got a lot of votes . 
  russia won in public vote by a landslide , actually receiving one of the highest televote scores in the entire history . 
   even in esc , especially with the ridiculous intolerant comments about counchita . 
  so they decided to protest against that voting down in a non-political song contest participant , who was vocally against anti-lgbt laws .
