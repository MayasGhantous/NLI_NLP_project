  genius . 
  apparently , it 's bad to be intolerant to lgbt persons , but it 's ok to be intolerant against russians . 
  that 's so progressive and cute . 
  oh , sure . 
  lithuanian jury placed russian song that otherwise was among the leaders on 25th position , last year the same jury put another top russian song on 20th place . 
  21 juries did n't give a single point to russia . 
  clearly , nothing political , they just disliked the tune . 
  \\ ^_^  if it was political , well , too bad people do n't like russia . 
  maybe they might have reasons . 
  in other words -- `` of course it was political , but i do n't want to admit it '' well , maybe they should find another way to demonstrate their hatred of russians instead of voting down nonpolitical _ song _ contest participants ? 
  it 's somewhere between petty and borderline idiotic . 
  i have no idea what 's your point . 
  russian delegation admitted defeat , it 's not like it 's going to protest , sue the ebu or something . 
  yes , it 's the rules . 
  shitty rules -- that 's what the discussion all about . 
  it 's a _ song _ contest where a participant can be buried , because the jury just disagree with politics of its country . 
  which is against all declared principles of the said contest . 
  or against principles of , like , any other significant international competition . 
   being the song with the most views does n't mean it 's the best one neither that is should win . 
  no , but it 's a good sign that it 's the most _ popular _ song , just like the other signs -- positions in charts , results of televote . 
  which is the main benchmark of success for _ popular _ culture . 
  it 's not like eurovision is some sort of high-brow academic competition . 
  and no , 21 juries gave russia 0 points not because they considered it `` mediocre '' . 
   russian song was very average . 
  yes , you already said it . 
  it 's just , like , you opinion . 
  public opinion was different . 
   burden of proof on you to show 13 million views makes the song more than mediocre . 
  by definition , no ? 
  should i really bring you the dictionary definition of `` mediocre '' ? 
  if it has by far the most views among all participants ( also most televote points , highest positions in itunes charts , etc. 
  ) , it 's not mediocre . 
   i could record myself taking a shit and if furthered russian nationalism maybe a few million russians will vote for it . 
  do it . 
  i am sure it will be a spectacular success . 
   and to be honest the song and video is mediocre . 
  it is everything wrong with modern pop . 
  bland , boring , plays it safe , lacks soul , lacks heart , lacks emotion thanks for you honesty , occupythekremlin . 
  it was n't easy for you , but somebody have to admit the bitter truth . 
  that 's why professional lithuanian jury put russian song at 25th place -- they just found that it lacked heart . 
  and australian song on the hand was such a shining non-bland masterpiece . 
  too bad that stupid public did n't agree with you placing russia first , with one of the best sum of points ever . 
   good luck good luck occupying the kremlin . 
  how 's the progress so far ? 
  germany is the second most populated country . 
  it did n't help them . 
  there are songs with more than 1 billion views , but none of them participated in esc 2016 . 
  in context of this eurovision russia was by far the leader . 
   sorry but 13 million views means nothing . 
  that is objective truth . 
  the objective truth that you are getting hilariously deep in denial . 
  so you started to claim that youtube views were inflated by bots -- seriously ? 
  for what purpose ? 
  just to give me a handy argument for discussion on reddit ? 
  that 's some nice / r/conspiracy material . 
  and it 's not just high view count . 
  you are ignoring results of televoting , odds by bookies and high positions in charts -- all of them pointed to the russian song as the top favorite . 
  were they created by bots as well ? 
  [ stupid bot removed my previous response for facebook links ] it 's just a scene . 
  they do n't do their own visuals . 
  jamala was produced by facebook com/frontpictures / russian video was produced by sever production and illuminarium 3000 . 
  you are entitled to your opinion . 
  i strongly disliked australian performance , and loved the polish song . 
  but number of views on youtube , positions in charts , results of televoting are objective metrics of song success . 
  it 's a part of objective reality , no matter if you like it or not . 
  no , because it has by far the most views , it means it 's not a `` very mediocre song '' like the guy above claimed . 
  lol , cognitive dissonance is strong in this one . 
  because people liked the song . 
  not everyone is so politically anxious in a non-political song contest . 
   butt hurt russians who think their song should have won ( sorry ) it was the same after semi-finals , or after finals before voting . 
  russian semi-final video was the most popular by a landslide . 
  ukraine was the second , poland 3rd , while australia far behind with the rest of the pack . 
  http://esctracker.com/ has several other metrics , sadly they were already contaminated by known results . 
  but the russian song is among the leaders everywhere -- on youtube , itunes , and spotify . 
   there is for some reasons a lot of russians on eurovisions youtube channel yes , because people liked that song . 
   some countries likes to listen to their own songs , that includes russia which has quite a lot of people in it when you compare it to a country like sweden for example , [ sweden in 2011 had 2.4 million views ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-04puett7oi ) vs [ 280k views of russia in 2011 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-3oharn3mm ) . 
  it seems this principle did n't work back then . 
  these people are just in denial . 
  the same is true for poland , by the way -- people blame polish diaspora for their high rank in televoting , while in fact they got a lot of points from countries without any noticeable polish diaspora . 
  that `` very mediocre song '' has 13 million views on youtube , it 's like twice more than any other entry in this competition . 
  yeah , those must be russian agents voting from all over the world , even including countries without any significant russian diaspora . 
  edit :  btw the visuals are done by the same team for every country about a month before the main event . 
  you are just making shit up . 
  russian show was [ directed by fokas evangelinos ] ( http://www.fokasevagelinos.gr/en/fokas-evagelinos/page/105-eurovision-song-contest ) , not by some mysterious `` the same team for every country '' . 
  russia got at least 3 televote points _ from every single country _ . 
  yes , there are problems with televoting , russia and other countries with large diasporas get some free bonus , but it 's just nothing comparing with ridiculous jury voting . 
  russian jury put ukraine at 24th place , ukraine put russia at 22th place , german jury awarded 12 points to israel , poland gets the last place and so on . 
  i think it will be interesting to scrap published eurovision detailed results , and recalculate ranks using the old method . 
  but you are right , it probably would not be much different . 
  yeah ... what a joke this `` professional '' jury , lasarev was buried out of top 10 by them , poland got just 7 points . 
  congrats to ukraine , though . 
  at least it was n't australia , no matter how hard the jury tried . 
  i hope the old system would be brought back . 
  it was _ far _ less shitty in poland . 
  the transition in ex-ussr country was completely botched , it was a catastrophe . 
  poland gained 7 % gdp ( ppp ) in 1990-96 , while russia lost 42 % of its gdp in the same period , ukraine -- 59 % and belarus -- 34 % ( wikipedia has [ a nice table ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balcerowicz_plan#criticism ) ) . 
  there is a good article by jeffrey sachs [ what i did in russia ] ( http://jeffsachs.org/2012/03/what-i-did-in-russia/ ) , who was an advisor both in poland and russia . 
  i think it 's spot on :  i believed that the money supply should be tightened and subsidies to firms should be ended . 
  this would stabilize prices but at the cost of initial unemployment . 
  this advice was rejected .
