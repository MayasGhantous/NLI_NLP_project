  high inflation continued unabated for several years . 
   i believed in the need for a strong social safety net , partly funded by the west . 
  this was not accomplished . 
  the health care system , for example , fell into shocking collapse . 
   i believed that the west should provide large-scale and timely foreign assistance to russia , as it had to poland . 
  the united states and the imf rejected this advice . 
  russia fell into a deep balance of payments crisis . 
   i believed that russia should `` commercialize '' its enterprises by turning them into corporations with state ownership . 
  this was generally done . 
   i believed that russia 's privatization should be quick but transparent and law-based . 
  care should be taken to prevent corruption . 
  this was not done . 
  the privatizers went ahead outside of transparency and the law . 
  corruption and insider dealing were rampant . 
   i believed that the large natural resource companies should remain in state hands . 
  this was to ensure that the russian government got the revenues from the production of metals , hydrocarbons , and other valuable commodities . 
  this was not done . 
  the natural resource sector was corruptly privatized , giving rise to the new oligarchy . 
   my area of responsibility for advising was macroeconomics , not privatization . 
  i had no responsibility for the corrupt privatization , though i was often blamed wrongly for it . 
  i actually opposed it strenuously , but was no longer even an advisor to the russian government when it occurred ( especially 1994-1996 ) . 
  meanwhile , it seems the us continues to support everything poroshenko is doing , even appointment of poroshenko 's _ kum _ without legal education as prosecutor general : * [ biden welcomes lutsenko 's appointment as ukraine 's prosecutor general ] ( http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/343311.html ) * [ u.s. to move forward with $ 1 billion loan guarantee for ukraine ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/us-move-forward-1-billion-loan-guarantee-ukraine-biden-poroshenko-imf/27734003.html ) i remember all these talks during the euromaidan -- russian $ 15 billion loan will be just stolen and eaten away by corrupt ukrainian government , but money from the west are totally different , the west will only give ukraine money with strings attached , it will greatly help to reform ukraine , etc. 
  heh , so much for that . 
  the article in question http://www.rudnikov.com/article.php?element_id=27962 ( [ google translate ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.rudnikov.com%2farticle.php%3felement_id%3d27962 ) ) . 
   the government will need a good explanation to limit it on their own . 
  they already have a `` good explanation '' . 
  actually , many of them . 
  terrorism , `` think of the children '' , foreign western enemy agents , protecting our people from fraudsters , `` internet should be safe '' , etc. , etc. 
  -- select any combination you like . 
  rip rbc . 
  so these raids were not just a coincidence -- just like expected . 
  one of the last quality not pro-putin major news website , _ the _ last quality tv . 
  rbc probably was a bit too extreme for russia -- it invited aviation expert vadim lukashevich that debunked `` ukrainian pilot '' version of mh-17 crash , reported about panama papers , putin 's daughters and stuff like that . 
  i read vedomosti so far , but if the vedomosti will be cleansed as well , there will be nowhere to go . 
  poroshenko & co. are hardly any better . 
   that does n't change the fact it 's more like a joke of a state it 's not a fact , it 's your opinion . 
  some people have trouble understanding the difference . 
   their country to some bunch of peasants and thugs . 
  actually , donetsk oblast and luhansk oblast have the highest level of urbanization in the whole ukraine , 80-90 % of people there live in cities and towns . 
  and i am sure that all 4 million people who live in dnr and lnr are nothing more than thugs . 
  the whole parade : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lq_ai9m_l4, 
  crimean population never wanted to be part of ukraine in the first place and it overwhelmingly supported reunification with russia even after 23 years of independence . 
  bolsheviks painted some funny borders on the map , ignoring ethnic composition or opinion of locals , e.g. 
  moved mostly armenian nagorno-karabakh to azerbaijan . 
  after the collapse of the soviet union this whole artificial system collapsed as well . 
   while justified by the political instability and lack of judicial independence in certain countries , the arbitration clause has no place in an agreement between countries that respect the rule of law , the expert said . 
   `` it is wholly unnecessary in countries that are party to the international covenant on civil and political rights , which commits states to due process and the rule of law , '' he added . 
  it 's just too funny . 
  almost all countries in the world are parties of the [ international covenant on civil and political rights ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_covenant_on_civil_and_political_rights ) , including such upstanding countries respecting the rule of law as syria , eritrea , north korea , and zimbabwe . 
  there are plenty of pro-russians in the baltic states , that 's why they are so busy fighting against russian `` propaganda '' ( aka media with a point of view they do n't like ) . 
  other countries are geographically and culturally are too far away from russia and too close to other centers of power , it 's no wonder russia has no significant influence on them . 
  after all russia is a relatively weak country . 
  serbia is a landlocked country , it 's surrounded from each and every side by eu , nato , or nato-wannabes -- what else it supposed to do ? 
  i 'm not sure it 's correct to claim that serbia is a more successful country than , say , belarus , see [ their gdp ] ( https://www.google.ru/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:blr:ukr:pol:rom:srb:rus:kaz&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) . 
  i read the article `` crimea is ukraine '' by stomakhin that guy reposted . 
  it included stuff like `` russia should be defeated in a war , destroyed by military means and erased from the world map '' , proposal `` to drown in a sea or to burn in ovens '' the `` moskals '' that voted on the crimean referendum , claim that every decent russian should support the caucasus emirate ( designated terrorist organization by russia/un/us / uk/uae ) . 
  the picture he reposted contained text encouraging to actively destroy russia like the chechens tried . 
  probably it was n't smart to post things like that on your vk profile . 
   half-finished high-rise buildings , in which whole families live in poverty and without basic services , are dotted with satellite dishes that mostly broadcast russian programs . 
  they deliver a powerful message to georgian homes : you belong to us . 
  those damn russians . 
  forced these poor people to install satellite dishes and watch evil russia propaganda . 
  in western media people ca n't be just genuinely pro-russian due to their historical , cultural , personal or economic ties . 
  they must be brainwashed by russian propaganda . 
  `` had to accept '' ? 
  under the barrel of gun , yeah , i forgot about that part of ukrainian mythology . 
  ukrainian media probably had to invent some bs to explain way why the hell  99 % of `` occupied '' crimean population received their russian passports without any resistance . 
  of course they were not satisfied with unpleasant truth -- crimeans were not forced , they just do n't want to live in ukraine , far poorer and less developed country than russia , in country with weird ukrainian nationalists in the government that all the time wanted to forcefully ukrainise them . 
   uh if you checked the referrendum you 'd know the only choice was to go back to russia that 's not true , but i agree that referendum was n't perfect , there were irregularities and signs of rigging . 
  however , since then there were a lot polls conducted both by russians and western pollsters . 
  they confirm that majority recognize the referendum , ~ 90 % supported reunification with russia , while only 2-3 % support going back to ukraine . 
   how about you ask the local tartars how they feel about russian occupation . 
  50/50 according to the polls i 've seen and they are just ~ 10 % of total population . 
  note that there was no exodus from crimea , they still live in crimea as they lived before . 
  russia takes some steps to please the crimean tatars . 
  for example , russia recognised deported crimean tatars as victims of stalin 's repressions and gave them benefits like halving their utility costs . 
  it 's amazing how much liberal progressive pro-democratic europeans want to gift crimea back to ukraine against the will of 90 % of crimean local population . 
  no , it 's not going to happen again , crimeans are not serfs to gift them without their consent like livestock -- with or without putin . 
  why so many sarcastic comments ? 
  you may disagree with sweden politics and so on , but what is wrong when the whole city unites on a memorial ceremony ? 
  at least it 's better than filters on facebook profile pictures and lighting national monuments up . 
  it 's the natural way to mourn the victims . 
  also , i used metro yesterday and the train brought me right to the improvised memorial on technolozhka 's platform . 
  there was a sea of flowers and a lot of silent people were standing around it in circle . 
  i 've joined the crowd for a minute . 
  it felt very nice -- genuine and non-official . 
  it 's interesting that both perpetrators in stockholm and st. petersburg were uzbeks . 
  our terrorist was an ethnic uzbek from kyrgyzstan who got russian citizenship few years ago . 
  the perpetrator in [ 2017 istanbul nightclub shooting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_istanbul_nightclub_shooting ) was an uzbek as well . 
  combined heat and power plants , i think . 
  moscow gets almost all of its energy from thermal power plants burning natural gas , which are placed right in the city . 
  it has no nuclear power plant or anything . 
  moscow has some nice modern buildings : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhmjydr_hcq, 
  that 's some red scare-tier scaremongering . 
  so they used the second most used traffic analysis tool in the web after google analytics : https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/traffic_analysis/all gotcha !, 
  i would not be surprised if these damn spies use nginx as well !, 
  this level of anti-russian sentiments is unhealthy already . 
  i do n't remember even our `` patriots '' searching for google analytics in state-affiliated sites -- there are a lot of it btw . 
   the article by boris stomakhin `` crimea is ukraine !, 
  '' , beginning and ending with the words : `` the collapse of  that 's pretty clearly political criticism .
