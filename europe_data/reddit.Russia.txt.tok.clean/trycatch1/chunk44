  that 's not political criticism , the article in question was n't banned for its title . 
  stomakhin is an entirely crazy guy who supported ideas of extermination of the russians , nuclear bombing of russia , terrorist attacks by caucasus emirate and so on . 
  in his article `` crimea is ukraine '' ( [ the article on his site ] ( http://stomahin.info/articl/krym.htm ) ) he wrote that russia must be defeated and then erased from the world map , and that he does n't care if the russians in crimea who voted on the referendum would be drown in sea or burned in ovens . 
  stomakhin serves the second term in prison for incitement of hatred currently , because the first term was n't enough and he continued to do his thing like nothing has happened . 
  i doubt he would stay free for a long while saying similar things in any western european country . 
   a poster-collage depicting three people , two of them ( in the form of soldiers of the third reich ) look like the the pic in question : https://i.io.ua/img_su/large/0093/87/00938724_n2.jpg i agree with you on this one . 
  the opinion of linguistic expert ( `` the humiliation of the honor and dignity of an individual person or a group of persons on the basis of their relationship towards religion '' ) looks very far-fetched here . 
  they just analyzed a lot of pictures at once from tsvetkov 's vk , most of them really contained hate speech , but with some of them they went overboard . 
  however , these `` gay putins '' and other funny stuff form a very small minority of the list of extremist materials . 
  [ that 's the breakdown ] ( http://www.sova-center.ru/racism-xenophobia/publications/2017/03/d36630/ ) by independent anti-xenophobia watchdog sova center of 785 new entries added to the extremist list in 2016 ( google translate ) :  * materials of modern russian nationalists - 604 ;  * other nationalists - 6 ;  * classics of racism - 2 ;  * islamist militants and other appeals of political islamists to violence - 69 ;  * muslim materials ( said nursi 's books , materials of banned organizations , including hizb ut-tahrir , and much more ) - 18 ;  * orthodox fundamentalists - 3 ;  * religious materials ( materials of jehovah 's witnesses , etc. ), 
  - 5 ;  * radical anti-russian statements from ukraine ( we separate them from `` other nationalists '' ) - 11 ;  * materials of the ukrainian media and the internet - 13 ;  * materials inciting to unrest and violence - 27 ;  * peaceful opposition materials - 2 ;  * a large heterogeneous array of texts , blocked entirely - 1 ;  * parody materials , banned as serious - 2 ;  * materials that are banned explicitly by mistake - 2 ;  * materials created , in our opinion , by people in an altered state of consciousness - 2 ;  * non-identifiable materials - 18 ( including 4 excluded ) . 
  by a huge margin the courts ban content created by russian ethnic nationalists and islamists . 
  amount of legitimate political content wrongly added to the list is negligible . 
   everything i see on here would be constitutionally-protected free speech in the us . 
  oh , sure . 
  the first amendment is something the us can be incredibly proud about . 
  it 's not that easy to copy it though , even the western europe did n't copy it . 
  overall so far the `` hate speech '' laws seem to be necessary in russia , considering that russia is a multi-national country , there should be some way to fight against ethnic tensions . 
  the recorded hate-motivated violence in russia is lower than ever . 
  in 2000s there were nationalist gangs who were mass-murdering immigrants , but the police seems to resolved that disbanding nationalist movements , jailing its leaders and ordinary members . 
   the moscow times fake news hit again . 
   in the photograph , putin has red lips and painted eyelashes , and a suggestive caption reads , `` they say there are many of them , but there are n't any among the people i know . '' the moscow times missed the first sentence entirely . 
  there must be a lot of them , but none of them are among my friends '' . 
  that 's why that _ particular picture with text _ was added to to the list of extremist materials , not just any generic suggestion that putin is gay . 
   officials have not provided a copy of the image , but it likely resembles the photo at the top of this story . 
  oh , i am sure that a nazi with account full of swastikas , ss , attacks on jews , democracy and immigrants will share poster with caption `` stop homophobia '' . 
   so less than 30 % actually want it brought back only if 0 % of remain voters support these measures . 
  support for death penalty in britain overall is around 50 % too : http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-32061822, 
  i am still uneasy about it . 
  vedomosti discuss some ways how this law can be abused : https://www.vedomosti.ru/economics/articles/2017/03/20/681812-biznesmeni-nalogovogo-rezidentstva and it 's impressive how fast these laws pass -- laws in the interests of selected few , or maybe even a single person . 
  a ** paid shill ** is a person who disagree with me in the internet . 
  thanks !, 
  at least 2 killed were not even russian -- a young woman from azerbaijan and a student from kazakhstan . 
  also st. petersburg and moscow are the regions with lowest putin support and highest support of liberal parties . 
  thanks to them . 
  to be honest , i did n't expect that . 
  good riddance , indeed . 
  i still have warm feelings to soros , because in 1990s when russia was piss-poor , his grants to talented students in russia were very helpful . 
  kudos to him for that . 
  but this training of agents of influence controlled from outside has no place in an independent country . 
   http://gtlodz.eu it seems this site gives only thumbnails when linked from outside . 
  nice trams . 
  i do n't care , i did n't give a single fuck after the recent terrorist acts in europe either . 
  shit happens , all over the world . 
  they did n't lit up anything after boko haram terrorist attacks in nigeria either . 
  the west did n't give a fuck when the terrorists blew up apartment buildings in moscow in 1999 , while it was our 9/11 . 
  instead they pushed conspiracy theory that russians bombed themselves and actively tried to obstruct the second chechen war . 
  i long time used to this hypocritical shit , so i would care only my city , russia and our friends . 
   that 's historical fact . 
  old ukrainian language in 11th century ? 
  yeah , it 's approximately as historical as other bs you told here . 
  and it was n't `` ukraine '' , it was a _ ukraina _ , meaning just borderlands . 
   you were called ` provocators ' at the time . 
  no , they were called ` historians ' at the time . 
  term ` kievan rus ' started to be prevalent only in the soviet union , but [ other terms still were in use ] ( https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=%d0%94%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%bd%d1%8f%d1%8f+%d0%a0%d1%83%d1%81%d1%8c%2c%d0%9a%d0%b8%d0%b5%d0%b2%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%8f+%d0%a0%d1%83%d1%81%d1%8c%2c%d0%94%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%bd%d0%b5%d1%80%d1%83%d1%81%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b5+%d0%b3%d0%be%d1%81%d1%83%d0%b4%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%be&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=25&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3b%2c%d0%94%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%bd%d1%8f%d1%8f%20%d0%a0%d1%83%d1%81%d1%8c%3b%2cc0%3b.t1%3b%2c%d0%9a%d0%b8%d0%b5%d0%b2%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%8f%20%d0%a0%d1%83%d1%81%d1%8c%3b%2cc0%3b.t1%3b%2c%d0%94%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%bd%d0%b5%d1%80%d1%83%d1%81%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b5%20%d0%b3%d0%be%d1%81%d1%83%d0%b4%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%be%3b%2cc0 ) . 
   ` ukraine ' in old-ukrainian is dated back to 1187 . 
  i loled . 
  that 's ancient ukrs-tier . 
   referring to ` kyivan rus ' as ` old-russia ' is a sign of olgyno shill who really needs a bit of integrity . 
  til there were olgino shills since 19th century , because that 's when terms `` old rus ' '' , `` kievan rus ' '' and `` old russian state '' were introduced . 
  yeah , i really have poor english comprehension skills . 
  i did n't know that single `` lel '' can possibly mean that much of stuff . 
   by saying crimeans are happy about their decision , implyies that crimeans decided to become russian . 
  when in fact we know that 's not true . 
  of course , it 's not true . 
  they did n't decide to become russian . 
  they were russian all the time . 
   first was russia taking crimea from ukraine , and afterwards the referendum . 
  eh , what ? 
  the referendum happened at march 16 , crimea joined russia at march 18 . 
  you should get the most basic facts straight . 
   what part do you not agree what part ? 
  you 've quoted my `` crimeans are happy about their decision '' and added `` lel '' . 
  i disagree with 1st , 2nd and 3rd letter . 
  crimeans already voted pro-russia in 1994 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_referendum,_1994 in response ukraine scrapped crimean 's 1991 declaration of sovereignty . 
  they never wanted to live in ukraine in the first place . 
   your metodichka is been outdated , my retartded comrade oh , you are so buttmad after being confronted with facts . 
   that 's expected , but still nice . 
  you did n't even notice that i am not even denying the involvement of russian military . 
  i question the scale , but not the fact of intervention . 
   funny video with kobzon and burned buryat . 
  the video is only funny if you do n't think about all ukrainians he killed before getting injured . 
  yeah , i read his interview and he was pretty successful in blocking debaltsevo 's road . 
  is that scary russian army you are always talking about ? 
  one buryat against 42 million strong nation ? 
  ukraine ( 42 million ) vs buryats and chechens ( 2 million combined ) -- and you still managed to lose . 
  that 's some pretty pathetic performance of ukrainian military then , i would be ashamed of that fact instead of talking about it all the time . 
   rostov 's cemetary you really used these photos of cemetery of unidentified people as a proof . 
  lol . 
  there are a lot of such cemeteries both in russia and ukraine , you have to bury hobos somewhere . 
  oh , that denial . 
   they ca n't genuinely like living in russia , they must be wanting to get back to ukraine deep inside , because ... hmm ... 
  i do n't know . 
  for some reason . 
  the size of shadow economy is estimated using indirect methods and included into official gdp estimates . 
  at least that 's how it happens in russia . 
  reading his biography in wikipedia : * he was a candidate from sps+y abloko in electoral district n204 of moscow during parliamentary elections 2003 . 
  he lost , got 2nd place with 8.6 % . 
  * he initiated nomination of dissident [ bukovsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_bukovsky ) as a candidate for 2008 presidential race , bu the electoral committee refused to register him as a candidate . 
  it 's the first time i hear about the whole affair , bukovsky was an absurd candidate , because he lived in the uk and was nobody in russian politics .
