  * he got 2nd place in internal elections of [ solidarnost ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solidarnost ) party after nemtsov in 2008 . 
  solidarnost was sorta big back then , so maybe it 's significant . 
  * he participated in elections the [ russian opposition coordination council ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_opposition_coordination_council ) in 2012 , got 21st place . 
  that 's really not much , considering that whole `` council '' collapsed almost immediately after its construction . 
  * he actively pushed for the magnitsky laws in the us , spoke on behalf of russian opposition , talked to the us congress , and so on . 
  then he pushed for similar legislation in canada . 
  that 's probably the most important think he did as a politician . 
  * he is a coordinator in the open russia ( khodorkovsky 's project ) . 
  * he also was a journalist on english-speaking tv channel rtvi -- it did n't work in russia , so i ca n't say anything about it . 
  that 's all . 
  so he is not a fabrication , just a massively oversold figure . 
  as a public politician he is not important at all . 
  maybe he is important in some opposition backbone to warrant murder , i just do n't know . 
   and it 's hard to tell , how do people there like this situation . 
  it 's not very hard to tell . 
  there were plenty of polls that confirm that crimeans are happy about their decision ( like [ this ] ( http://fom.ru/nastroeniya/12471 ) , [ this ] ( http://openopinion.ru/content_res/articles/oo_crimea_brief.pdf ) or [ this ] ( https://www.gfk.com/fileadmin/user_upload/dyna_content/ua/1_press-releases-2016/gfk_eu_netherlands_irf_eng.pdf ) ) . 
  they notice improvements in the quality of life have even more satisfied with their life than average russian . 
  it 's hardly a surprise , they would be idiots would they want to get back from russia to far poorer and far less developed country that neglected them . 
   as much as soviet-finnish war was a cyvil war . 
  we do call it `` hybrid war '' we do call it `` bullshit '' . 
  majority of dnr/lnr fighters are not russian soldiers in disguise , but locals from donbass -- unlike ukrainian army , most of which are not donbass locals . 
  it 's a sad reality for ukrainian nationalists , but real russian army only briefly participated in the war and its participation was very limited . 
  it just amplified the forces of locals and that 's all . 
  it 's a textbook civil war , intervention of foreign powers does n't make it less civil . 
  like a dozen foreign countries already intervened in syrian civil war , it 's still a civil war . 
  budapest memorandum just reiterated helsinki accords to which all signatories were bound anyway . 
  it did n't add anything new , i mean it literally links the helsinki accords in its text . 
  ukraine had no chance to keep its nuclear status anyway . 
  i never heard about that guy before the poisoning story . 
  the first time i heard about the story , i confused him with his father -- he was a notable tv host on ntv . 
  there was one more referendum in crimea , in 1991 , ukraine was a socialist republic in the ussr back then ( ukraine declared independence from the soviet union at august 24 , 1991 ) . 
  crimeans were asked if they wanted to restore crimean autonomous soviet socialist republic and be _ a subject of the soviet union and the soviet agreement _ . 
  the answer was 93 % yes with 81 % turnout . 
  crimea indeed received crimean assr status from the ukrainian ssr , but it did n't get the second part -- upgrading crimea to a subject of the soviet union . 
  then crimea declared its sovereignty as part of ukraine -- the declaration that was scrapped by ukraine in 1994 . 
  there is an interesting [ article on these ] ( https://www.novayagazeta.ru/articles/2016/09/05/69755-krym-kotoryy-ne-nash-i-ne-vash ) ( in russian ) early crimea topic by a lawyer in novaya gazeta ( strongly anti-putin media btw ) . 
  would yeltin 's gang be more persuasive during the collapse of the soviet union , crimea would gain its independence back then , and there would be no modern problem -- ukraine never had any moral right on crimea and its legal claims were dubious too . 
  instead yeltsin decided to trample chechnya ( a predominantly chechen region russia had no particular interest in ) into middle ages . 
  i am not sure if they realistically were able to do something better with unfinished aircraft carrier ( aka heavy aircraft carrying missile cruiser ) . 
  but the planes -- damn !, 
  nato even tried to persuade ukraine [ to destroy its t-64 tanks ] ( http://sled.net.ua/utilizaciya/tanki/ukraina/zubi/2013/29/07 ) in 2013 -- would they succeed , ukraine would be stripped of tanks for their war . 
  i like ukrainian folk songs as well : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dznlstqlfq, 
  from left to right : lm-99 by spb 's own tram factory ( bankrupt by now ) , ktm-31 by ukvz , citadis cis 301 by alstom ( instead of citadis we were going to buy ukrainian electrons produced in lviv , but the deal was n't implemented for some reason ) . 
  moscow recently bought nice new trams fully developed in russia , vityaz -- http://imgur.com/a/1nsrm sadly , st. petersburg is a provincial town comparing to moscow , our trams are even painted in some boring provincial way . 
   so your arbiter t is about they 're no less now so no way you have slaughtered in such numbers . 
  [ ... ] blah-blah-blah , a lot of words , but i 've only used populations as an illustration of absurdness of obviously idiotic claim about 20-30 % killed . 
  there is no way to find 250k ( 20 % ) killed in the chechen conflict , no data supports that outlandish claim proposed by chechen separatists and their supporters . 
  that 's comparable with the syrian civil war casualties after 4 years of war -- but in 20x smaller region . 
  i 've cited a professional demographer , corresponding member of the russian academy of sciences , who estimated total casualties in chechnya at 50k-60k , including 10.000 russian soldiers . 
  do you have anything better ? 
   show me some place that 99 % of the infrastructure was destroyed and whole cities were leveled to the ground , literally . 
  seriously , you do n't even need data for that but just need to take a look at the photos . 
  what an amazing method to estimate casualties -- just _ look the photos _ and get a _ feeling _ how many people were killed . 
  looks like it 's the only source you are using . 
  by the way , of course , nowhere near to 99 % of infrastructure was destroyed , you 've used your `` look at the photos '' method again . 
   also please , do n't act like some meme , where some vatnik goes around and asks for proofs . 
  oh , those damn `` vatniks '' !, 
  they ask for proofs instead of blindly trusting any bullshit claims by a `` gentleman '' . 
   russian crimes in chechnya are not some secret . 
  there were russian crimes -- completely overshadowed by the crimes of chechen terrorists . 
  bombing a city is not a crime , however . 
  if someone are going to use the city as a fortress , the city is going to be leveled . 
  blame dudaev , basaev , maskhadov and other criminals , who decided to turn grozny into a battlefield . 
  yamadaev was smarter and gudermes was saved . 
   the two chechen wars killed 20 % of the local population ( with some estimates as high as 30 % ) that 's pure bullshit , not supported by any data , invented by separatists and promoted by their western friends . 
  population of chechnya in 1989 , year of the last soviet census - 1.275.513 , in 2017 - 1.414.865 . 
  there were not even that large demographic losses as 20 % -30 % . 
  more realistic estimates of total body count in both wars - around 50k-60k , approximately half of them were civilians . 
  http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2005/0211/analit02.php  mostly innocent civilians  indiscriminate destruction of grozny it reads like some war propaganda piece . 
  `` good '' side fights against combatants , mostly kills terrorists , destroys enemy 's hqs , while `` bad '' side seemingly fights only against civilians , specifically targets hospitals and indiscriminately shells cities , turning them into rubble . 
  that 's like aleppo bombed by russia and iraqi cities bombed by coalition that experienced similar levels of destruction ( objectively measured by unosat for example ) , but had drastically different coverage in western media . 
  it was a war , a war of significant scale . 
  russia lost ~ 10.000 soldiers killed in both chechen wars , more than the us lost in iraq and afghanistan combined . 
  they were not killed by civilians . 
  it was a war , not a slaughter . 
  the real reason for reunification with crimea was fixing mistake of khruschev who gifted russian region to ukraine for no reason . 
  80-90 % of crimeans supported reunification with russia all the time , there were three referendums since 1990 already . 
  it should have been fixed during the collapse of the soviet union , but sadly the crimeans had to wait for 23 years , russia had other problems at the time . 
   so they will probably never let loose on crimea ? 
  of course , crimea is russia and will stay this way . 
  ~ 90 % of russians [ support the reunification ] ( http://www.levada.ru/2016/06/16/13639/ ) . 
  crimeans did n't change their opinion either . 
  after-reunification satisfaction rate of crimeans is around ~ 80 % and higher than russian average , 2/3 think that the situation is improving . 
  annexation is not any different than first invading and recognizing the invaded part as independent country . 
  if the country is independent it 's free to join any other country . 
  but mr. secretary of state , ukraine already returned crimea in 2014 . 
  they ca n't return it again . 
   huh , we have +25 % of industrial production this january . 
  lol . 
  +25 % is a bit too much , is n't it ? 
  in fact , ukrainian industrial production ** contracted ** in february by 1.7 % year-to-year , and by 2.6 % to january ( seasonally adjusted ) . 
  http://www.segodnya.ua/economics/business/promproizvodstvo-v-ukraine-v-fevrale-upalo-gosstat-1006186.html  fwiw we could keep 3 % + yearly gdp cool . 
  at this rate in just 40 years ukraine will achieve _ current _ russian per capita gdp ( ppp ) level . 
  with such low base gdp growth at world 's average is nothing to be proud about . 
   why on earth should we want to talk to you ? 
  why do we need you ? 
  it 's cute when a little kid says something like that to her parents , but when an adult person says the same thing it looks ugly . 
  sadly similar views are indeed shared by sizable part of ukraine -- so far ukrainian society as whole is infantile . 
  i hope it will change in the future and ukraine will not be driven by emotions and populism , but by pragmatism and self-interest . 
  well , the russians nowadays indeed have conservative , anti-gay ( typical for majority of ex-ussr countries ) and anti-europe ( relatively recent development due to the recent kerfuffle ) views , but that old crazy guy is not any more relevant to russian mainstream than westboro baptist church to the us .
