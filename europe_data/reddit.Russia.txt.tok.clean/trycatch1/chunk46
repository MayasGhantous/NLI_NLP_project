  even school students did n't take him seriously and laughed on him like he was some sort of clown . 
  most likely the school will ask him not to do this anymore or will just get rid of him . 
  in a similar case , the lecturer from the moscow conservatory who was telling to her students about `` 5th column '' and `` traitors '' was fired just yesterday . 
   ukraine exports  2013 : $ 63.3 b ( to eu - $ 13.9 b , to russia - $ 14.9 b )  2016 : $ 36.4 b ( to eu - $ 13.1 b , to russia - $ 3.6 b ) russia was buying not just your commodities and agricultural products , but also [ most of your machinery exports ] ( http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/ukr/rus/show/2013/ ) , that are not interesting in the eu . 
  you 've destroyed your own economy and lost access to a huge market . 
  but russia lost a bit too , so it 's a net victory for ukraine i guess . 
   as for our citizens , well , they 'll have much more profitable destinations in europe just in a few months . 
  that 's fucking hilarious . 
  are you aware that visa-free regime does n't give you right to work ? 
   you know , only full retard could prefer moscow over warsaw . 
  lol . 
  you are just a goldmine . 
  the only terrifying thing here is stupidity of people who generalize marginal opinion of a single person on country with 146m population . 
  obzh -- literally , basics of life safety -- is the most useless subject in russian school . 
  it 's about things like fire safety , gas safety , cpr , first aid and so on . 
  maybe in theory it should be one of the most important subjects , but in practice it 's often being taught by random people without necessary skills of teaching . 
  our obzh teacher was a complete clown who was n't respected by anyone . 
  looking at the guy from the link , it seems little has changed in 20 years . 
  at least he entertained his students . 
  but really , obzh teacher saying or doing something stupid is not news . 
  well , good luck him with his career in the us . 
  godspeed and good riddance . 
  if a person reports to the us senate , asking for monies and more sanctions against russia , he ca n't be considered a russian politician . 
  sure , but sadly i do n't need it . 
  and i never saw toilet paper with obama face sold in russia . 
  it seems that this type of back pain is far less prevalent here . 
   and none of those are in europe . 
  i fail to see why do you think that it 's fine to invade countries outside of europe , and why geographical position make invasions and regime changes any more acceptable , but the us invaded serbia , did you forget about it already ? 
   should we now find a list of countries russia has invaded since ? 
  so if russia did something bad too , it somehow justifies actions of the us and its puppets ? 
  however , the list would be very short -- only ukraine and georgia may qualify . 
  georgian campaign happened when saakashvili invaded south ossetia and killed russian peacekeepers , ukrainian -- after western-backed coup in kyiv . 
  russia did n't pursue regime change in any of them though , both saakashvili and poroshenko retained their seats . 
  it 's supposed to heal ukrainian nationalist buttpains . 
  it seems you are arguing with a strawman , because i did n't say that . 
  extending anti-russian military alliance to the borders of russia , invading countries right and left , sponsoring numerous regime changes , sponsoring dubious ngos inside of russia , scrapping anti-ballistic missile treaty qualifies as `` acting aggressively '' . 
   they chose a more pro-western path eh , they selected pro-russian path , then the west sponsored pro-western coup that toppled government and scrapped agreements with russia . 
  in 2013-early 2014 population was equally split between eu and customs union http://imgur.com/a/4ywpp of course , customs union was arguably more beneficial for ukraine . 
   but annexing portions of and crimea is the special case . 
  it was a mistake that happened during the collapse of the soviet union -- crimea should never be a part of ukraine in the first place . 
  kruschev decision was nonsensical , in all referendums since 1990 the crimeans demonstrated their will to be a part of russia . 
  fortunately , the historical mistake was fixed in 2014 when crimea reunified with russia . 
  no other land was annexed . 
  russia still recognize dnr and lnr as parts of ukraine . 
   sponsoring separatist movements in the neighbouring country just because they chose a more pro-western path will look bad regardless of how you spin it . 
  you ca n't do it all the time and seriously blame russia for doing the same . 
  i mean _ all the time _ -- libya and syria are not even old examples . 
  russia just ca n't strictly respect international laws if its main adversary does n't respect them -- it would put russia into disadvantageous or even lost position . 
   shooting down a plane full of civilians will not make things better either . 
  it does n't have to do with anything . 
  mh-17 was n't shot down intentionally . 
  it should not have flied over war zone during ongoing aerial warfare . 
  civilian victims from mh-17 are not any different from other war collateral losses -- like thousands of donbas people killed in indiscriminate shellings and air strikes by ukraine or ~ 5000 civilians killed by coalition airstrikes during the battle of mosul . 
  it 's just the west cares only about civilian war victims when it 's convenient . 
  in the future with ai , robots and shit large population would be a liability , not an asset . 
  good thing that we have the largest country in the world with a lot of resources . 
  also we are one of the countries that will benefit from global warming the most . 
  the future would be ok . 
  rwanda is ranked 5th in gender gap index : http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2016/rankings/ its fertility rate is comparable with other african countries . 
   as a swede i am grateful that nato exists to counter an increasingly aggressive russia increasingly aggressive nato is the main reason why russia have to act aggressively in the first place . 
  that 's too stupid even as trolling . 
  you should try harder . 
  hizb ut-tahrir is not equal to isis . 
  in russia there were 20308 road fatalities in 2016 . 
  that 's 138 fatalities per million , darker than the darkest region on the map . 
  24 % fatalities -- due to drunks . 
  not sure who hates the crimean tatars , but russia builds for them large mosque https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchohqmvjmu , people who suffered from stalin 's deportation are recognized as victims of repressions and receive benefits from the state . 
  they did n't get shit from ukraine in 23 years . 
  all these arrests are related to hizb ut-tahrir -- extremist islamic organization which is banned in russia . 
  lol . 
  these clowns are still trying to make the human rights story out of arrests of hizb ut-tahrir extremists who dindo nuffin . 
  read about this organization in wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hizb_ut-tahrir :  al-nabhani also developed a program and `` draft constitution '' for the caliphate , [ 8 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] which would be run by a caliph head of state elected by muslims . 
  [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] article of the constitution detail such points as metals to be used in currency ( silver and gold ) , age at which muslims males will begin military training ( 15 ) , the `` sole language of the state '' ( arabic ) , and obedience of wives to their husbands . 
  [ note 2 ] anti-zionism and the belief that the state of israel is an `` illegal entity '' to be `` dismantled '' [ 21 ] or `` destroyed '' without compromise , [ 22 ] is an important element of party doctrine . 
  [ 8 ] ...  hizb ut-tahrir has been described as `` controversial '' , [ 23 ] and as of mid 2015 it was ** banned in germany , russia , china , egypt , turkey , [ 24 ] and all but 3 arab countries ** . 
  [ 25 ] [ 26 ] ...  critics and others argue that the party is engaged in `` politics of hatred '' [ 34 ] and intolerance which is a `` natural precursor '' of and provides ideological justification for [ 35 ] violence ; [ 34 ] that actions such as calling suicide bombers `` martyrs '' , [ 36 ] accusing western countries of waging war on islam and muslims , [ 37 ] [ 38 ] or calling for the destruction of hindus in kashmir , russians in chechnya and jews in israel -- are extremist ; [ 39 ] or that it opposes violence and military expansion not in principle but only until its `` islamic state '' has been established . 
  [ 28 ] i wonder why was this organization banned in russia , such nice guys . 
  probably because russia is evil and put people in prison for sadistic pleasure . 
   all the crimean activists were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the hizb ut-tahrir organisation , which russia has declared a terrorist group . 
   the kharkiv human rights protection group ( khpg ) asserts that there is no evidence to suggest that the organisation is connected to terrorism , nor is there any proof that the men were involved in the group . 
  oh , if _ ukrainian _ human rights group said something , it must be true . 
  because ukrainian organizations are known for their honesty . 
  just think about -- it 's well known that hizb ut-tahrir was popular in crimea , it had thousands of members there . 
  do you really think that fsb ca n't find few dozens real members of hizb ut-tahrir who continue their practices ? 
  why do they claim that `` nor is there any proof that the men were involved in the group '' ? 
  in fact i found vk profile of one of these innocent guys and his profile contained nothing but reposts from pro-hizb ut-tahrir group and some reposts from pro-isis group . 
  and that guy got just few days of administrative arrest for these posts and that 's it -- probably , because his house-check did n't show anything . 
  people who got real sentences were not innocent at all , they were real members and real leaders of hizb ut-tahrir cells who recruited people into his organization , and there was hard evidence against them . 
  check [ this article in zona.media ] ( https://zona.media/article/2016/24/05/hizb-ut-takhrir ) ( it 's an independent pro-opposition outlet ) -- hizb ut-tahrir literature was found with them , correspondence related to the operation of their cell , sound recordings of their meetings ( zona.media 's articles includes some transcripts ) . 
  and guardian still out of the blue claim that `` there is no any proof '' of their involvement in the group ? 
  fuck them . 
  their coverage is not any better than rt , just with a different sign . 
  medvedev is much better than other options and it 's not up to corrupt fake lawyer navalny to denounce someone for corruption . 
  volodin , medvedev , maybe somebody else , maybe somebody unknown . 
  it 's too early to say , we have like 7 years to the succession . 
  nobody knew about medvedev 7 years before his presidency and even one year before the elections people were not sure , who will be selected by putin -- medvedev or ivanov . 
  i would be really happy if putin would select medvedev or kirienko . 
  it 's much better than being a puppy of western sponsors . 
  all of them are corrupt . 
  medvedev is not different from others .
