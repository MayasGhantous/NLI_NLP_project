  the us and , to a lesser extent , eu countries behaved incredibly irresponsible in that conflict . 
  hopefully , thanks to russian intervention in syria , this country will be peaceful in , say , 2 years from now . 
  without russian involvement syria will be in the state of eternal war . 
   are n't you seeing what is happening in ukraine ? 
  maybe ukraine bears some responsibility for that ? 
  just a little bit ? 
  maybe it was n't a good idea to burn unarmed people in odessa trade union house and then let perpetrators go unpunished ? 
  maybe it was n't a good idea to impose ukrainian nationalism on ethnically and politically divided country ? 
  to shell densely populated residential areas with mlrs and heavy artillery , to pound commieblocks with airstrikes ? 
  russia started real intervention in donbass conflict only in august 2014 when civil war was in full force , and it immediately helped to ( almost ) freeze that conflict . 
   you do realize that western support did n't cause any of these events ? 
  western ( both eu and us ) actions were a major cause of euromaidan . 
  not the only one , but one of the most significant causes . 
  lol , imagine some russian official on blm riot , or on bronze soldier protests if you want . 
  you would lose your shit -- and rightfully so -- but for some reason consider it normal to do the same in other countries . 
  the west financed hromadske.tv -- tv channel created during euromaidan to support its cause . 
  yet again the west is losing their shit about rt , but for some reason using western-backed propaganda channels for regime change in other countries is entirely fine . 
  lol , the west even directly financed creation of well-known ridiculous cartoons showing beautiful future of ukraine in the eu and terrible in the customs union : http://tyzhden.ua/gallery/89753/8#gallery it 's hard to precisely estimate the size of western contribution to the regime change , but it 's plain silly to deny that it was significant . 
   arguably russian actions did . 
  russian actions were not the only reason to cause crimea and donbass secession either . 
  crimea already tried to secede in early 1990s -- without any help from russia . 
  there was crimean referendum of 1991 to declare crimea separate soviet socialist republic , [ referendum of 1994 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_referendum,_1994 ) , attempt to declare independence by the [ president of crimea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yuriy_meshkov ) and suppression of this attempt by kievan authorities . 
  in donbass situation , ukrainian authorities lost control over donbass without any russian intervention . 
  euromaidan rallies in donetsk were attacked and scattered in early march , administrative building were captured in early april , local police was pro-russian and did n't interfere . 
  organization `` donetsk republic '' worked in donetsk oblast since 2005 , they also had dnr flag and stuff . 
  read some timeline of the events . 
  it was n't as simple as `` putin sent his agents and starts the war '' , the conflict did n't materialize out of nothing , there was local grassroot sources for that and russia has huge support on the ground . 
   it 's ridiculous you try to lay the blame on the west . 
  it 's ridiculous that you ca n't admit your own fuck ups . 
  this black and white nationalist worldview is so familiar , it 's not any different from opinions of people from rt comment section . 
  zero reflection and self-criticism . 
  evil russia doing evil things for no reason , the west din do nuffin . 
  try to change status quo stomping interests of regional power . 
  support violent regime change with nationalistic flavour in ethnically divided country . 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
   giving moral support for democratic ideals and funding reforms is pretty much the main extent of western support . 
  these talks about `` democracy '' and `` reforms '' - that 's some kind of magic thinking . 
  russia was more or less democratic in 1990s , elections were real , there was independent media controlled by different groups of oligarchs -- and it was far behind modern putin 's russia in every reasonable sense . 
  moldova is a democracy . 
  still the poorest country in europe . 
  kyrgyzstan -- the only democracy among authoritarian countries . 
  poorer than its neighbors . 
  honduras and salvador . 
  democracies . 
  do you want to live there ? 
  ukraine is not going to be democracy like estonia , it will be democracy like russia of 1990s with groups of corrupt oligarchs fighting each other . 
  reforms can be done in an authoritarian country just as well as in democratic . 
  many things hailed as achievements of maidan were long time done in `` totalitarian '' putin 's russia without much ado -- for example , deployment of electronic procurement . 
   because even as russia considers the new government all evil and bad , there are still nearly 40 million people there who need to live , have hopes for the future etc. 
  maybe in your brotherly behaviour it 's norm that you throw them under the bus because putin said so , but we at least try to give them a chance . 
  ukraine threw itself under the bus . 
  ukraine is an independent country and russia ca n't be responsible for their self-harming behavior . 
  russia did n't cut key exports to ukraine ( like nuclear fuel ) , unlike ukraine which cut water and electricity to crimea -- hitting ordinary crimeans the most ( who are ukrainians occupied by russia , according to ukraine ) . 
  most of the sanctions between two countries were initiated by ukraine , russia just mirrored them later . 
  for example , it was ukraine that banned civilian air travel between ukraine and russia , so planes from moscow to kyiv are flying through third-party countries . 
  ukraine banned russian payment systems in ukraine , making it harder for ukrainian migrants in russia to transfer money to their families . 
  it was mostly ukrainian populist rulers ' decision to severe relations with its largest trading partner . 
  in comparison , georgia exports to russia more than in 2007 : http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/stacked/export/geo/rus/show/1995.2014.2/ georgia is pro-western and had military conflict with russia too , but its leaders are not self-destructive idiots . 
   why do you think your neighbours turn to west ? 
  first and foremost , compare size of economics of the west ( eu and us ) and russia . 
  the eu is naturally much stronger magnet than russia . 
  second , some countries still live in the past , and have russia = ussr = russian empire = stalin = satan in role of the main villain in their national myth . 
  and third , russia has fine relations with most of its neighbors . 
  it even maintains good relations with both armenia and azerbaijan . 
  relations with mena , central asia , china , india , etc. 
  are fine . 
  it 's mostly the west is a problem . 
  the us wants to dominate , while russia is not ready to be dominated , wants to have independent foreign policy and promotes idea of multi-polar world . 
  so the us sees russia as an adversary . 
  it 's sorta fundamental conflict , it ca n't be easily resolved with for example removal of putin . 
  any politician acting in russian ( country , not ethnicity ) national interests would act in foreign policy more or less along putin lines -- even if you 'll make russian obama clone , or install on russian throne some german duchess . 
   so would serbia then give its territories with kosovar ( albanian ) majority to kosovo ? 
  why ? 
  that 's not serbia who makes shitty excuses for invasion and occupation . 
  it 's not like serbia illegally annexed these territories from albania . 
  ( btw presevo and bujanovac are so much for the claim that albanians just ca n't live in serbia peacefully -- but somehow they do . ), 
  northern kosovo makes all these attempts to justify recognition with arguments about ethnic cleansings , `` albanians ca n't live with serbians '' and self-determination ridiculous . 
  albanians do n't live there , the region is like 95 % serbian , they did n't self-determine themselves out of serbia . 
   the basis for kosovo 's independence was the territory 's autonomy , which means it was already partly self-governing . 
  they pretty much extended their right of self-determination . 
  `` we do n't respect internationally-recognized country borders , but respect internal administrative borders of the same country -- that were never designed as country borders in the first place . '', 
  invasions are illegal either way . 
  but at least ceding albanian-majority kosovo can be morally justified with arguments about self-determination and alike -- just like crimea . 
  occupation of large non-enclave serbian-majority territories just because it 's easier cut along the dashed line can hardly be justified by anything . 
  okay , i am tired to type this bs ) ) ) not sure why did i write all this stuff , just had a free hour and it one-sided western view on russia always annoys me . 
  the source is clearly english tass story http://tass.com/world/928965 it 's much shorter than the russian one . 
  this  minsk , february 3 .
