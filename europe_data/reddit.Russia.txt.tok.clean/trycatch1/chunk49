  lol . 
  seems to be their modus operandi . 
  i 've just looked on their front page . 
  their today `` fresh '' news : * [ newly discovered footage of stalin 's funerals ] ( https://themoscowtimes.com/news/watch-newly-discovered-color-footage-of-stalins-funeral-57452 ) . 
  other outlets [ reported it a week ago ] ( https://meduza.io/feature/2017/03/10/pohorony-stalina-s-balkona-posolstva-ssha ) . 
  * [ navalny releases new video and calls for protests ] ( https://themoscowtimes.com/news/opposition-leader-navalny-calls-for-protests-across-russia-57442 ) . 
  the video was released two days ago . 
  * very few legitimate news , but they are just extremely short reprints , in 2-3 sentence . 
  what a joke `` news '' outlet . 
  it 's more like a collective blog to push their garbage editorials and opinion pieces with anti-russian agenda than legitimate media . 
  literally fake news site . 
  good enough for their core audience though . 
  i bet they can report 5 year old news as fresh and their target audience would not notice shit . 
   you are seriously comparing invasion to just supporting ordinary people in toppling their incredibly corrupt regime ? 
  oh , i am sure they are much better with another incredibly corrupt regime , this time nationalist ( because it 's great in a multi-national country ) and pro-western , now with -20 % gdp and few regions less . 
  :') however , yeah , supporting violent revolution and toppling of the legitimate government by bunch of nationalist thugs is not ok and has nothing to do with promotion of democracy or human rights . 
  these `` ordinary people '' had to just wait 1 year to the next elections and vote for whatever candidate they wanted . 
  democracy is not mob rule . 
  note that only half of ukrainians ( both geographically and number of people ) supported maidan -- that 's at the peak of its popularity . 
  the other half opposed it . 
  crimea and donbass were overwhelmingly against it . 
  yanukovich was a president elected by the whole ukraine , and citizens of kyiv alone had no right topple him . 
  maidanites broke the social contract , i am not sure why did they think that other part of the country must agree with voluntarily changed contract imposed on them and agree to be ruled by de facto usurpers . 
  kyiv unilaterally changed the rules , crimea changed the rules too . 
   yes , i 'm sure those 50 soldiers brought some huge destruction there . 
  so what ? 
  estonia still participated and supported that invasion , even in purely symbolical way . 
  weakness is not an excuse . 
  `` it was n't a rape , because my penis is too short '' . 
   also , they at least left the region , something russia usually tends to do some 50-100 years late , if at all . 
  estonia is a member of a military alliance led by certain country that 's doing all this stuff for them . 
   i 'm not personally very fond of the situation , but they had a fucking ethnic cleansing . 
  no way they would continue to peacefully live in serbia from that point . 
  for sure at least serbian majority regions were able to keep living in serbia -- but for some reason there were forcefully ceded from their own country . 
  that 's plain and simple occupation . 
  not possible to live ? 
  people live in bosnia , croatia , rwanda , iraq and [ many other countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_ethnic_cleansing_campaigns ) . 
  serbs live in kosovo despite they were ethnically cleansed by kosovo albanians . 
  i see no reason why it was n't possible to keep kosovo in serbia -- of course with guarantees , protection of human rights of all parties , of all minorities , significant autonomy and so on . 
  obviously it was possible , they just did n't want to that . 
  it 's just certain western countries ( including estonia ) have artistic understanding of international law . 
  and if your country has such selective view of international law , you should not be surprised that other countries are doing the very same thing . 
   we know ukraine has had pretty bad leadership and the country is definitely not a success story . 
  it does n't justify invading them in any way . 
  well , there would be no russian intervention in crimea without illegal western-backed change of power in kiev and no russian intervention in donbass without full-blown civil war that had to be stopped by someone . 
  ukraine was n't `` invaded '' just for not being a success story . 
  by the way , considering that estonia supported and participated in the invasion of iraq , i think you should address these words to your own country . 
  according to condoleezza rice :  months ago , the prime minister of estonia told president bush that he did not need an explanation of the need to confront iraq . 
  because the great democracies failed to act in 1930s , his people lived in slavery for 50 years . 
  oh , estonia also was one of the first to recognize kosovo  just 3 days after the us . 
  i am sure you protested against that . 
  because it `` does n't justify it in any way '' and so on . 
   now , to see all the russia 's disgusting cynicism it 's weird that you forgot to say that their remarks generated a huge scandal . 
  producer responsible for [ that show was fired ] ( http://www.spb.kp.ru/daily/26650/3671228/ ) . 
  both hosts were forced to [ apologize for their insensitive remarks ] ( http://ura.ru/news/1052280850 ) . 
  their remarks were not acceptable in russia . 
  that 's basically how ukrainian and western media cover crimea and russia -- they mine for exceptions , sell them to their audiences as something commonplace , then make sweeping generalizations ( `` somebody in russia said something stupid '' -  `` russia as whole is cynical '' ) . 
   in the occupied crimea no , when she toured in crimea it was already deoccupied . 
  lithuanian jury placed lazarev 's song on 25th last place . 
  http://www.eurovision.tv/page/results?event=2113&amp;voter=lt oh , i am sure they just did n't like the song . 
  :') btw , thanks to jury member e for 22th place , you are true august landmesser of modern lithuania ) ) lithuania is the last party that have moral right to whine about politicizing esc . 
  there is zero political anything in selection of samoylova ( she was considered for the esc long before ) , there is zero anything political in her song . 
  it 's just not very smart people from ukraine and certain western countries love to politicize anything connected with russia . 
  stalin killed a lot of top-notch military commanders and military engineers ( including e.g. 
  [ creator of katyusha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgy_langemak ) mlrs ) right before the world war . 
  however overall it 's unlikely the famine was planned , it was never proven that some guys gathered around and decided -- let 's organize famine !, 
  but when it happened , stalin used it to crush peasant resistance . 
  in the same vein [ the famine of 1921-1922 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_famine_of_1921%e2%80%9322 ) ( it mostly hit russia , so it was genocide of russians , i guess ? ), 
  was used by the bolsheviks to crush the church . 
  probably because it was n't a genocide . 
  it was a stalin 's man-made famine that happened in a result of collecitivization and affected approximately half of the soviet union -- kazakhstan , ukraine , belarus , northern caucasus and russia . 
  kazakhstan had higher depopulation rate than ukraine , so the claim that holodomor was a genocide against ukrainians is a bit weird theory . 
   poland yeah , 20 years after poland [ invasion of russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kiev_offensive_ ( 1920 ) ) and captured ukrainian and belarusian territories with polish minority that never were polish in the first place , russia got these territories saving ukrainians them from falling to genocidal hitler 's rule -- just like poland [ grabbed back czechoslovak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93czechoslovak_border_conflicts#annexations_by_poland_in_1938 ) lands just one year before . 
   finland it was necessary to protect st. petersburg . 
  i am genuinely sorry about finns and russians who lost their lives in this entirely avoidable war , but it was necessary . 
  the border was too close to the # 2 largest city of the soviet union . 
  siege of leningrad demonstrated that these concerns were absolutely legitimate . 
   romania it 's so cute that hitler 's ally still cries a river . 
   cry more . 
  thanks for stalingrad , though . 
  portugal found a way to remind about its existence . 
  anyone who express opinions i disagree with is not worth listening to . 
  you are right , of course , this rating is just a steaming piece of shit . 
  it 's impressively amazing that people here are ready to uncritically take any random rating at face value . 
  i 've seen a lot of stupid ratings , but this one is truly special . 
  indicators they use :  volume of transfers of major conventional weapons , as recipient ( imports ) per 100,000 people  financial contribution to un peacekeeping missions  nuclear and heavy weapons capabilities  volume of transfers of major conventional weapons as supplier ( exports ) per 100,000 people apparently it 's bad to export arms , it will penalize you in some bullshit rating . 
  good to know . 
  then , almost half of their indicators are based on `` expert '' assessment of the economist `` intelligence '' unit which is truly a joke . 
  according to them , `` political instability '' of belarus and ukraine are the same . 
  `` political terror '' in russia is higher than in zimbabwe , saudi arabia or any post-soviet country -- well , russia is literally hitler , so no surprise here . 
  `` ease of access to small arms and light weapons '' in usa is lower than in russia . 
  wtf , seriously ? 
  they are not even trying . 
  overall , the result is a worthless aggregate of arbitrarily selected low-quality indicators . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_cities_by_population_within_city_limits population within city limits is a bit meaningless metric for size comparison . 
  urban or metropolitan areas would be better : [ list of metropolitan areas in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_metropolitan_areas_in_europe ) , [ list of urban areas in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_urban_areas_in_europe ) . 
  these lists are not as developed as the city limits one though . 
   muslim hotspots hmm . 
  philippines :  the philippine statistics authority in october 2015 reported that 80.58 % of the total filipino population were roman catholics , 10.8 % were protestant and 5.57 % were islamic . 
  [ 15 ] germany :  34-36 % of the country 's population are not affiliated with any church or religion , and a minority adhere to other religions .
