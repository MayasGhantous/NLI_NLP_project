  that 's why ukraine should stop listening to the eu , should stop searching an ally in germany , etc. , and resume ato as soon as possible . 
  there will be no meaningful sanctions on russia . 
  iirc one of our guys traced forests , swamps , etc. 
  of estonia and maybe some other countries with fuzzer . 
  russian osmers did n't accept such import , claiming that the quality of automatically recognized data was low . 
  so e.g. 
  leningrad oblast looks less prominent -- it 's all hand-made , and it 's a laborious work to trace forests , etc. 
  by hand . 
  you can see the border of the bot import in finland very well . 
  soviet offensive in august 1945 was considered most important factor in japanese surrender , and the bombing was painted as unnecessary . 
  it was more or less neutral , matter of fact way , however . 
  i 've opened our modern schoolbook from 2012 , and now it 's far more opinionated ( by danilov and filippov ) :  august 15 , 1945 japanese government declared about their readiness to surrender to the allies . 
  in the usa it 's widely believed that the japanese were scared by atomic bombs dropped on august 6 and 9 august 1945 on hiroshima and nagasaki . 
  the barbarian murder of 114 thousands of mostly civilian people -- maybe it was able to scare americans themselves , but not japanese military elites . 
  [ ... ] in case of landing into japan , imperial government and military command planned to evacuate into korea and manchuria , and continue to fight there . 
  the soviet offensive put an end to these plans . 
  they had nothing else to do , but accept terms of the surrender of the allies . 
  that thing in action : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbpbozdcqb4#t=101 they have elbrus os -- fork of linux kernel , their own proprietary c/c + + compiler and linux distro . 
  they also advertise their system of binary translation , so it 's able to run windows xp ( [ video of windows 2000 loading on it ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcei07neit0 ) -- in 3 minutes or so ) . 
  quite frankly , i have no idea , who uses this stuff . 
  we had ( and still have ) original elbrus microprocessors with original architecture . 
  the last one is elbrus-4s from 2014 -- 65nm 4-core 64-bit 800mhz cpu . 
  elbrus cpus have been the topic of endless flamewars for decades in russia . 
   bringing home crimea , while probably justified  listen to donbass 's legitimate concerns russian propaganda works well . 
  moreover , activists from lviv had to practically smuggle [ bulletproof vests from poland for the army ] ( http://galnet.org/newsticker/147037-lvivyany-na-sobi-perevezly-bronezhylety-z-polschi-dlya-ukrajinskyh-vijskovyh-na-shodi ) . 
  france helped with some bulletproof vests , but [ they were found useless ] ( https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1427737124163705&amp;set=a.1403451879925563.1073741831.100007822924448&amp;type=1&amp;fref=nf ) . 
  so much support for ukrainian army from the west . 
  yeah , proxy war indeed -- regular ukrainian army fight using ukrainian military equipment ( often developed and produced in ukraine ) on ukrainian money . 
  it will not help separatists in luhansk , if ukrainian forces will continue their luhansk offensive . 
  ukrainian forces today took stanitsa luhanska and schastia , they already control the road from metallist to schastia , and took stukalovo balka . 
  ~ ~ something is going on in donetsk right now !, 
  heavy explosion . 
  fire/smoke in the administration building . 
  reports ( unconfirmed ) that the bus was blown up . ~ ~ nope , just car of some `` minister '' of [ the dpr exploded ] ( http://t.co/a6mnjmbob6 ) , 4 persons injured .

  tsn tv channel is owned by ihor kolomoyskyi . 
  inforesist is a ukrainian website , moreover that 's just copypasted [ report of ukrainian tv channel tsn ] ( http://tsn.ua/ukrayina/poloneniy-gorlivchanin-sam-pogodivsya-na-inscenuvannya-vlasnogo-rozstrilu-teroristom-bisom-353893.html ) . 
  in the tv report they also talk with budick 's wife -- currently she appeals to all authorities to do something to free her husband . 
  she knows better if her husband alive or not , and i ca n't imagine more reliable source than her . 
  then , of course , these guys ( including besler ) have terrible track record . 
  but it does n't prove that they were guilty in that particular crime . 
  also , besler has track record of fake executions -- there was one more fake execution by him on 27 may . 
  besler was real and detainees were real as well . 
  the execution itself was fake . 
  besler did that trick before , on 27 may he publicly `` executed '' two police officers for whatever `` crimes '' against dpr . 
  two days later they were released , beaten but alive . 
  [ it was on the top of / r/europe ] ( https://pay.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27dl49/nsflnsfw_prorussian_separatists_execute_prisoners/ ) , so i think that confirmation that it was a fake is relevant to the sub . 
  long story short -- vasily budick , `` executed '' in the video , confirmed in phone interview to 2 +2 channel that it was staged . 
  ukrainian forces and separatists planned prisoner exchange -- separatists were ready to exchange budik , colonel vaschenko , one more civilian , and 2 soldiers on some woman olga detained by sbu . 
  but in the end ukrainian rejected the deal . 
  so the video was filmed to influence ukrainian society . 
  -- edit : also budick was interviewed today by [ obosrevatel ] ( http://obozrevatel.com/crime/28460-bezler-otpustil-6-pogranichnikov-i-otnositsya-k-nam-luchshe-ukrainskoj-vlasti-grazhdanin-gruzii-iz-plena-dnr.html ) and [ 112 . ua ] ( http://112.ua/politika/uchastniki-inscenirovki-rasstrela-plennyh-bezlerom-rasskazali-o-prichinah-sozdaniya-video-73906.html ) . 
  the interview by obosrevatel ( google translate ) :  according to budick , together with him in the seized gorlivka 's obop militants hold two men of the 25th commando brigade and colonel of sbu . 
  at the time of a call , the other hostages of the fake `` donetsk people 's republic '' were next to budick . 
  bezler ( bes ) was willing to trade all four prisoners for a young woman - the wife of one of its fighters , kulygina olga ivanovna . 
  this woman was arrested while attempting to cross the russian-ukrainian border with undeclared 10 thousand dollars , she tried to smuggle to gorlivka . 
   `` i am in captivity for 41 days - said vasily budick . 
  - bezler is ready to trade us for olga ivanovna , which is in the sbu kiev . 
  we feel good ... now . 
  we are waiting for our rescue . 
  all authorities were involved , the decision is up to poroshenko . 
  sbu , the ministry of defense , national security council - all do not mind . 
  already once agreements have been reached , remained until half an hour of our liberation , but turchinov canceled everything . 
  afterwards bezler let go 6 border guards from lugansk just like that , without any exchange . 
  these guards were deserted by their commander and then the rest went to russia , and 15 fighters moved to kharkov , and 6 of them were captured . '', 
    according budick for young border guards came rubezhnoye their parents . 
  a common earlier video shot himself and colonel vasily budick sbu was staged in order to hasten the exchange of hostages . 
    `` until bezler called to the parents , they did not know what happened with their children - told budick . 
  - bezler released one son to every mom and dad . 
  the border service did n't interfere - it is nonsense that they were involved . 
  bezler wanted to show with our execution that something like that could happen too - your pick . '', 
    according to budick , before terrorist bezler ( bes ) voluntarily released three other fighters of the ukrainian army , whom the government has forgotten . 
    `` nobody worries about the fate of the captives . 
  mothers of the soldiers of 25th airborne brigade , which are here next to me , had already arrived for them to gorlovka - waiting for their children to be able to leave the territory , '' - said vasily budick to obosrevatel . 
    captives , according to the words of budick , were shocked by the indifference of ukrainian authorities about their fate . 
    `` what threat to ukrainian security may be this olga ivanovna , they say that she has 4-year-old child ... why she ca n't be exchanged for four prisoners of war ? '', 
  - says hostage . 
    georgian government delivered a note about budick to ukraine . 
  according to the prisoner , president poroshenko yesterday paid 3 minutes for a meeting with the ambassador of georgia , who asked to hasten the release of budick . 
    `` one signature -- and we will be free . 
  but while the ukrainian government treats us worse than bezler . 
  bezler laughs : `` this country needs you ? 
  '' - said vasily budick . 
    nevertheless , a citizen of georgia basil budick not ceased to be a patriot of ukraine . 
  `` we serve the people , not the government - says prisoner . 
  - looking for politicians , convinced that these people are not gentlemen of his words , but i still love the ukrainian people . '', 
  of course , budick is still in captivity , so everything he said should be taken with a pinch of salt . 
  but without any doubt he is alive . 
  well , nothing was renamed yet , and maybe nothing will be renamed . 
  that 's not pro-kremlin . 
  tymchuk is strongly pro-ukrainian , also the opinion that the execution was fake is widely supported in many ( most of ? ), 
  pro-ukrainian communities i read . 
  i do n't understand the analogy . 
  again -- this person staged mock executions as recently as a few days ago . 
  also he claims that he executed officers , while it 's known that the person he named ( vasily budik ) is not an ukrainian officer , but kidnapped activist , citizen of georgia . 
  so while it 's possible that it 's a real execution ( besler is a pretty scary person after all , he was involved in kidnapping of rybak murdered later , in killing soldiers under volnovakha , etc. 
  ) , i would not be surprised if it 's a fake . 
  why consider hypothesis about staged execution extraordinary ?
