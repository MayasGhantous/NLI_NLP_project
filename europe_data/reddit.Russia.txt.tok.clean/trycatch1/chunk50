  [ 4 ] [ 3 ] the second largest religion in germany is islam , with between 2.1 and 4.7 million adherents ( 2.6 % to 5.7 % ) . 
  good . 
  the west is yet again is trying to use the unsc as their soapbox to make the bad guy out of russia . 
  however , all vetoed resolutions on syria ( except one ) were vetoed not just by russia , but by china as well . 
  the ceasefire works : * stats of destroyed armored vehicles of both sides per month : http://lostarmour.info/analytics/ after march 2015 it just vanishes . 
  * ukrainian side casualties per month : http://memorybook.org.ua/indexfile/statmonth.htm ( height of columns is misleading ) . 
  in august 2014 alone ukrainian army lost more people than in the whole 2016 . 
  a lot of these 2016 casualties are non-combat casualties , like drunks playing with firearms , own mines , brawls , or sickness . 
  * civilian casualties are down , see ohchr report , page 11 : http://www.ohchr.org/documents/countries/ua/uareport16th_en.pdf and _ ukraine _ mostly kills civilians , nowadays , not the rebels : `` 23 . 
  shelling from various artillery systems caused over 60 per cent of all civilian casualties : 13 killed ( three women and ten men ) and 88 injured ( 37 women and a girl , 48 men and a boy , and an adult whose sex is not known ) . 
  20 percent of these casualties ( three killed and 18 injured ) were recorded in the government-controlled territories , while ** 80 percent ( 10 killed and 70 injured ) were recorded in the territories controlled by the armed groups . ** '' . 
  * there was no significant offensives or territorial changes since minsk-ii after the end of the battle of debaltsevo . 
  and in those few movements that did happen it was the _ ukrainian side _ that tried to advance , tried to take control over gray area or rebel strong points . 
  ukraine got the second par of shirokino , gray zone here and there , the rebels did n't advance anywhere . 
  the ceasefire works , intensity of the current conflict is just non-comparable with intensity of 2014-2015 war . 
  and when _ it does n't _ work ukraine is very far from being innocent . 
  overall , i do n't see a single legitimate reason for ukraine not to implement article 11 . 
  they are probably do n't feel much of external pressure and they are sure that eu/us still will support them no matter if they are going to implement minsk-2 or not . 
  and having permanent war is not bad for local ukrainian political elites . 
   if everyone in crimea is so happy to be back , let 's have another referendum . 
  fully planned , with the support of opposition parties ukraine and the west would never agree on such referendum , exactly because they know very well that the result will not be good for them . 
  it 's an illusion that larger preparation period or fair electoral campaigns for both sides , or independent vote counting will change anything at all . 
  no , it would not be 97 % ( it 's the result of vote fraud ) , it would be 90 % , or maybe even 80 % support . 
  okay , let 's imagine 70 % support , which is on extremely unlikely side . 
  there is no way it would be lower . 
  these numbers change nothing , it 's still supermajority . 
  and why should n't they support reunification with russia ? 
  crimea has russian majority , russia is significantly more developed country than ukraine -- why in the world would they want to get back to ukraine ? 
  especially after all ukrainian friendly tricks like cutting electricity to crimea , banning trade and so on . 
  according to several opinion polls ( including polls by western pollsters ) , idea to return to ukraine has 2-3 % of support in crimea . 
   then have international observers present at the voting booths so there can be no doubt and the question is settled for good . 
  russia invited international observers . 
  osce and other international organizations declined to participate . 
   having a legitimate referendum is the logical next step and since all of crimea apparently wants to stay as part of russia , then the result will come out the same and russia will have nothing to lose !, 
  second referendum would not be accepted by the west just like the first . 
  at the very best it will be pointless . 
  hmm , it 's strange that you forgot much closer historical example :  1991 : crimea is ukrainian and never will be russian again !, 
   2014 : oops ... 
  considering sudetenland -- yeah , i remember . 
  it happened when the nazis attacked russia and got their asses whipped after slaughterhouse with  50m total death toll . 
  just to transfer crimea to ukraine against the will of crimean population ? 
  absolute majority of crimeans consider themselves part of russia , absolute majority of russians consider crimea part of russia . 
  it 's very unlikely that russia will give up its integral part . 
  there is no politician in the entire russian political spectrum to propose such inane thing as gifting crimea to ukraine again -- at most navalny proposes new referendum ( with predictable results ) . 
  actually , all the soviet republics ( including baltic soviet republics ) had the right to exit the soviet union . 
  check any soviet constitution . 
  ah , sweet dreams  too bad that in our harsh reality crimea is not ukraine and will never belong to ukraine again . 
  however , crimea is indeed the most ukrainian territory in russia , the op is n't wrong . 
  it has slightly more ukrainians ( 16 % ) than sevastopol ( 14.2 % ) and yamalo-nenets autonomous okrug ( 9.7 % ) . 
  tragic to whom ? 
  that 's how the `` tragic event '' looked like for crimean population : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo2cwldet-4 crimea returned to its home , for the most of the crimeans it 's one of the happiest events in whole their lives . 
  indeed , it 's a truly tragic event for banderites , ukrainian nationalists and their western puppeteers . 
  they were slapped so hard that their head is still spinning , kicked so well that they still feel severe pains in their rear -- it 's evident from this very thread . 
  but somehow i do n't feel really sorry for them , 
  the right way to read / r/europe comments -- from bottom to top . 
  the most informative answer usually is the most downvoted one . 
  it was fabricated , it was a politically motivated kangaroo court and navalny was indeed involved in some really shady schemes that look like ordinary fraud through shell/mailbox companies . 
  looks like a duck , walks like a duck , and probably was a duck . 
  but the investigators were incompetent or lazy , or maybe there were other reasons , but in the end they managed to fuck up even when they had royal flash in their hands . 
   1000 is enough for statistics ~ 3 % sampling error with 95 % confidence interval . 
  wow . 
  that shit is hilarious . 
  are you seriously that delusional ? 
  honduras has the largest murder rate in the world and like 1/5 gdp ( ppp ) per capita in comparison to russia . 
  but i am not even surprised that in your imagination nothing ticks as wrong , when you see honduras higher than russia in the index of `` fragile states '' ( whatever does it mean ) . 
   russia is more fragile than honduras hmm , i always wondered about the point of these bullshit ratings coming from silly-named organizations like `` the united states think-tank fund for peace '' . 
  i mean nobody can be that stupid to take them seriously ? 
  now i see that they can be used to prove that your country is better than other countries in internet discussions . 
  just in some irrelevant ratings , but larger numbers are still larger numbers . 
  you are just pulling shit out of your ass . 
  you invented _ ad hoc _ theory not confirmed by anything whatsoever , just because the facts were inconvenient for your worldview based on western propaganda . 
  [ there ] ( https://wciom.ru/index.php?id=236&amp;uid=115770 ) [ were opinion ] ( http://openopinion.ru/content_res/articles/oo_crimea_brief.pdf ) polls done in 2016 , they confirmed results from older polls . 
  ~ 90 % support reunification , 2-3 % dislike it . 
   were expecting the annexation to bring higher pensions , more jobs , higher wages and everything was hugs and promises yeah . 
  and that 's exactly what really happened . 
  even if russia is in state of financial crisis , the gap between ukraine and russia was too large , and it probably even increased since 2014 . 
  most of people notice improvements in the quality of their life -- and these are the results of opinion polls , not just your imagination . 
  actually crimean level of satisfaction is higher than russian average . 
  feels bad , is n't it ? 
   russia is as shitty as a shitty country can be it 's truly golden to hear this from portugal . 
  \\ ^ geopolitical wisdoms from / r/europe posters . 
   defending crimea no , it 's just western world leaders are not as terminally dumb as ordinary / r/europe users , and did n't want to start war against russia to defend crimea from crimeans . 
  me reading this thread https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48h34ukfe8g / r/europe never disappoints :d, 
  russia is a great country . 
  you may dislike this fact , but bitching in / r/europe about it will hardly change it . 
  it would be awesome if these clowns will indeed try to continue attack on polish sovereignty from the eu . 
  ca n't wait for further weakening and deconstruction of this shitty globalist behemoth . 
  that feel when even censor.net.ua ( crazy nationalistic ukrainian shithole ) is more truthful than western propaganda . 
  i have to say , it 's an achievement of some sort , congrats to bbc . 
  http://censor.net.ua/blogs/4667/smena_rastet_ili_pochm_nynche_para_veder_soldatskoyi_krovi ukrainians attacked rebel positions on their own initiative and took control over one rebel strong point . 
  donbasians counter-attacked and encircled the attackers , and now nationalists are crying about their high casualties in the failed blitzkrieg blaming incompetent generals and poor planning , while ukrainian officials are bragging about `` repulsed rebel offensive '' and western propaganda outlets uncritically reposts them . 
  if you read russian , i recommend reading transcripts from 2007-2008 roundtables in moscow state university between major russian and ukrainian historians on this very topic -- `` genocide of ukrainians vs common tragedy of ussr people '' . 
  * http://www.hist.msu.ru/labs/ukrbel/obrukr-golod.htm * http://www.hist.msu.ru/labs/ukrbel/golod_final.htm position of russian historians -- it was a man-made famine , unlike other major famines of 1921 and 1947-48 , but it was n't planned , it was a `` social genocide '' if you like , but it was n't a genocide against ukrainians . 
  kondrashin , one of the top russian scholars on 32-33 famine , summed up the general points ( he is also member of the united russia and deputy of the federation council , so that 's almost official russian pov ) : * [ ... ] population contracted in kazakhstan by 30.9 % , in volga region by 23 % , in ukraine by 20.5 % , nothern caucasus - 20.4 % [ ... ] * the famine happened in a result of anti-peasant policy of the stalin 's regime during the first five-year plan , its mistakes and anti-humane measures against peasantry that lead to destruction of agriculture and famine . 
  * it was n't planned , but stalin 's regime used it to force peasants to work in _ kolkhozes _ and enforce the chosen political course . 
  * the famine had regional specifics that defined its scale and results . 
  it hit first on zones of total collectivisation , in areas where the state met with active resistance against grain procurement . 
  * situation in ukraine was defined first and foremost by grain specialization of the republic , high population density in zones of total collectivization , scale of resistance of peasantry and response to the resistance by central and local authorities , measures to suppress resistance and protect _ kolkhoz _ system . 
  * famine of 1932-33 and overall crisis of ukrainian economy , just as famine of 1921-22 , let stalin 's regime to solve other problems ( in 1921 it was destruction of opposition in the russian orthodox church , in 1930s it was suppression of potential growth of national movement in ukraine ) . 
  but the reason of the tragedy in the ukrainian ssr , just like in other regions of the ussr , was n't national question , but problems of strengthening of _ kolkhoz _ system , economics overall , political regime , solved by stalinists with methods from their arsenal , linked to the nature of victorious regime and person of its leader .
