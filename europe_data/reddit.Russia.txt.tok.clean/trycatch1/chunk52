  fsb agents tried to be as suspicious as possible -- they bought in local shop shotgun shell ( that was supposed to be the detonator ) , and publicly unloaded truck with partially covered license plate in the evening . 
  locals noticed it and called police . 
  the hoax explosive device was found , sappers ( who did n't know about exercises ) tried to explode it , but failed , because it was just sugar , there was no explosives . 
  that 's all . 
  it looks like , well , botched exercises . 
  but if you will omit some key parts of the story , if it will look like unsuccessful terrorist attack . 
  child-beheading by cia-vetted zenki group is not any better . 
  al-qaeda allies that are _ directly _ supplied by the us are not any better . 
  the us is _ directly _ responsible for idlib that was taken over by al-qaeda , because it supplied its allies . 
   moreover , none of the major victories in idlib since early-april would have been possible without the crucial rearguard actions of u.s. -- and western-backed fsa units and their externally-supplied artillery shells , mortars and american-manufactured bgm-71 tow anti-tank missile systems . 
  that 's not rt or sputnik , these are words of charles lister , big fan of the rebels , expert on syria for cnn and so on . 
  thanks , indeed !, 
  thanks to this , christians [ had to run from this city ] ( http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/culture/2015/04/syria-idlib-christians-jabhat-alnusra-.html ) -- those who were not executed . 
  the us bombs cities both in syria and iraq . 
  fallujah and ramadi are no less devastated than aleppo , if not more devastated : * [ fallujah ] ( http://www.unitar.org/unosat/node/44/2417 ) * [ ramadi ] ( http://www.unitar.org/unosat/node/44/2343 ) * [ aleppo ] ( http://www.unitar.org/unosat/node/44/2344 ), 
   e.g. 
  iran/russia/syria are just as bad , if not worse . 
  they killed more civilians in syria than isis . 
  they fund terrorists and are involved in the proxy war in yemen . 
  indeed , why this retarded nonsense get upvoted ? 
  both soviet cartoons did n't do justice to the original . 
  the books are true classics of children literature , especially the last ones , _ moominpappa at sea _ and melancholic _ moominvalley in november _ . 
  they are basically the opposite of cheesy . 
  moderate rebel journalists are celebrating :d https://twitter.com/omaralsory641/status/805772264474079232 i really hope that russia is not going to agree to ceasefire or evacuation bullshit from the west . 
  lol , nobody cared ? 
  all western news are about ebul russians slaughtering poor ill innocent kittens of aleppo . 
  russia is destroying last hospitals of aleppo , cat sanctuaries , last clowns , and that poor girl with mom who for some reason decided to stay in war zone and twit about evil assad instead of evacuating . 
  that 's some insanely idiotic shit . 
  in real reality , that 's fsa who allied isis on many occasions , e.g. 
  against common enemy -- kurds . 
  [ reuters in mid-2013 ] ( http://in.reuters.com/article/syria-crisis-kurds-idinl5n0hm3m220130926 ) :  faced with what they see as a shared kurdish threat , moderate free syrian army rebels fought in atma alongside the islamic state for iraq and the levant ( isil ) , an al qaeda affiliate controlled by foreign jihadists , only a week after the two factions fought each other in another border town . 
  moderate , lol . 
  ok , that 's 2016 , so smashing skull with a club should be humane enough for everyone . 
  however , it seems quite a bit of the rest of the world disagrees with you . 
  european food safety authority [ has 100 + pages report ] ( http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2007.610/epdf ) on this topic and reviews existing scientific research , which is scarce , conflicting and inconclusive . 
  summary :  there is evidence that , during the canada 's commercial seal hunt , ** some animals do , and others may , suffer pain and distress at different stages of the killing process ** . 
  this could be largely avoided if sealers complied with the canadian regulations in relation to manually checking the skull or administering a blink reflex test . 
  trading seal products is banned by the eu , the us , and eurasian economic union ( with ebul russia inside ) . 
  but when the eu banned seal products trade , progressive environmentalists norway and canada went to dispute the ban in the wto -- unsuccessfully . 
   oh look , another russian taking a criticism of his government as a personal insult . 
  no shit . 
  russians support russia !, 
  who could possibly expect that ? 
  i am not a fan of russian government , i never voted for putin , but if i see that russia does some completely reasonable things -- like making territorial claims in arctica or helping legitimate syrian government to remove extremists in aleppo -- of course i am going to support it . 
  that 's just common sense , it have nothing to do with putin , any government acting in national russian interests would work along these lines . 
  it 's not absolutely free , but restrictions you talked about are only related to broadcast channels . 
  no country in the world has absolute freedom of speech ( and it 's probably not desirable , because it will include things like freedom fraud , freedom of child porn and freedom of slander ) , but in the us freedom of speech is significantly wider than in other countries . 
  at least it 's certainly not going to ban anti-abortion websites , because they may upset someone . 
   russia thinks they own the entire arctic it 's extremely hilarious to hear this from a citizen of the country that claims ownership over the north pole , not having [ any reasonable standing there ] ( http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2016/05/08/why-canada-cant-have-the-north-pole/ ) . 
   i totally side with norway and canada what a surprise . 
  i 'm sure your opinion is fair , informed and balanced , and totally not based on blind anti-russian hatred . 
   have strong environmentalist movements and wo n't allow to exploit and destroy natural environment there sure . 
  that 's why baby seal hunting is still legal in canada ( banned in russia ) , that 's why norway still practices commercial whaling , and canada is not a member of the international whaling commission at all ( only aboriginal whaling in russia is allowed , limited by the iwc quotas ) . 
  maybe , but not as misleading as your comment . 
  '' [ b ] supporters say [ / b ] the bill would target sites that masquerade as neutral sources of information on abortion ... '' you are just retelling opinion of _ supporters _ of the bill . 
   specially regarding tv ( tonnes upon tonnes of odd occurences where words can not be said or elements performed but whatever ) this has little to do with freedom of speech . 
  american government controls radio spectrum and strictly polices its usage . 
  you are free to put in cable networks , satellite or internet whatever you want . 
   stop acting like france does n't have freedom of speech , this is dishonest . 
  you should ban this too . 
  it 's just your way of `` dealing with these things '' after all . 
  saudi arabia , russia and france all have their unique ways dealing with freedom of speech . 
  sort of . 
  ukraine tried to ukrainize crimea , mandated ukrainian language in cinema , forced ukrainization of crimean schools and so on . 
  all this just because good guy khruszhev gifted russian region with all its 2 million population to ukrainian ssr . 
  anyway , stop inventing artificial reasons . 
  ethical cleansing does n't give a right to tear a country apart , there is no such law . 
  that 's just some post hoc justification to separate similar cases of kosovo and crimea . 
  and if you can use such ad hoc line of reasoning , so can we . 
  in contrast kosovo , there was no large exodus of locals in crimea , while majority of kosovo 's serbs had to leave in the aftermath of the nato invasion . 
  in contrast to nato in kosovo , we did n't bomb hospitals and bridges in kyiv to force ukraine into submission , reunification with crimea was entirely peaceful . 
  in contrast to kosovo , there are no local areas in crimea with populations that support ukraine . 
  in contrast to kosovo , crimea never was ukrainian before the generous khruszhev 's gift . 
  so , in our view it 's just as completely justified that kosovo is serbia , while crimea is russia . 
   kyrgyzstan it seems they forgot about [ manas air base ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transit_center_at_manas ) that was active prior to the crimean crisis . 
  it was quite expensive for russia to kick the us out of there . 
   the news of the base 's closure followed the announcement of a new agreement between russia and kyrgyzstan in which kyrgyzstan will receive $ 2 billion in loans and $ 150 million in financial aid from russia . 
  [ 31 ] most observers see the two events as connected , and believe that russian financial assistance was offered on the condition that u.s. forces were expelled from kyrgyzstan . 
  [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] as of 2009 , the u.s. government provided $ 150 million in aid annually to kyrgyzstan . 
  [ 32 ] according to general david petraeus , head of u.s. central command , around $ 63 million of that sum is directly connected to the base . 
  [ 36 ] the larger russian package is viewed by some analysts as an effort to `` out-bid '' the americans . 
  [ 32 ]  referring to the closure of manas air base , pentagon spokesman geoff s. morrell directly accused russia of `` attempting to undermine [ american ] use of that facility '' . 
  [ 31 ] u.s. secretary of defense robert gates also said that , `` the russians are trying to have it both ways with respect to afghanistan in terms of manas . 
  on one hand you 're making positive noises about working with us in afghanistan , and on the other hand you 're working against us in terms of that airfield which is clearly important to us . 
  '' [ 35 ] ah , nato bases , not us bases . 
  well , half-truth is not a lie , i guess . 
  xddd, 
   from our point of view in central and eastern europe russia started to distort information thanks god , there is correct information ( american and other western press ) , so we always can find distorted information comparing it with the reference . 
  what would we do without the western media , the janitor of truth ? 
  we would be totally like blind kittens in a dark forest without them . 
   and influence media markets much earlier . 
  of course it does have an influence on societies in the eu and on other countries . 
  these guys _ really _ do n't like competition . 
  bbc , deutsche welle , voice of america , rfe/rl all are state-owned , have russian versions and work in russia ( totalitarian russia ) . 
  but when russia does the same thing in the west , they are honestly shocked . 
  it seems in their worldview russia supposed to be only an object , not a subject . 
   lol , documented involvement of russia in ukraine , threats that they will nuke european countries and we should just dissolve nato because some putin puppet said so . 
   so all this military hardware that is only in service by the russian army that is showing up in donbas is lazy journalism . 
  let me guess , you actually believe that these are `` volunteers '' that have for some reason access to a 50 ton battle tank , all i can say is lol these are your only two posts in / r/russia . 
  so you tried to troll , but they banned you instead of feeding .
