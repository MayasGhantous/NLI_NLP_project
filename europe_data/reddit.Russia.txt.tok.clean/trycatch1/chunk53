  feels bad . 
  how can be the russians so evil ? 
  term limit helped _ even _ in russian context . 
  medvedev was significantly more liberal than putin , despite not being really independent , etc. 
  putin had to extend term length from 4 to 6 years to postpone the next flip-flop . 
   stop good people from running again and bad people the problem here that different persons ca n't agree which people are good and which are bad . 
  russians do n't consider putin a bad president ( certainly he is one of the best russian leaders for the last century ) , while merkel looks like some sort of practical joke from here . 
  the article about eviction of the amnesty was on the top of / r/europe , this ones receives 0 upvotes . 
  well , if soros-funded reporters without borders says it , it must be true . 
  they support truly amazing impartial journalism ( as opposed to agenda-driven propaganda ) . 
  you are technically wrong . 
  it 's a translation of an old edition of the code . 
  since 2007 the definition of hooliganism [ was changed ] ( http://kremlin.ru/acts/bank/25987 ) ( google translate ) :  1 \\ . 
  hooliganism , that is , gross violation of public order , expressing obvious disrespect to society , committed :  a ) with the use of weapons or items used as weapons ;  b ) on the grounds of political , ideological , racial , national or ** religious hatred ** or enmity or on grounds of hatred or enmity towards any social group  \\ - shall be punishable by compulsory labor for a period of one hundred eighty to two hundred and forty hours , or by correctional labor for a period of one to two years , or by imprisonment for a term of up to five years ; '' either a ) or b ) are enough . 
  so there is hooliganism on ground of religious hatred . 
  that said , of course they were not sentenced for hooliganism , it was just an absurd political decision of a kangaroo court . 
  i fail to see any relevance of that pic . 
   why ? 
  because nominal pensions did n't decrease , they were even raised a bit . 
  in january 2017 the pensioners received single-time 5000 ruble ( ~ $ 90 ) payment . 
  that month the real disposable income grew by +8.0 % year-to-year . 
  in march it was -2.3 % , in april it 's -7.6 % . 
  it 's really a very volatile stat . 
  considering that retail consumption grew in the same april , it could be some sort of methodological artefact . 
  edit : nominal disposable income decreased too , so the lack of inflation adjusting of pension ca n't explain that . 
   payed paid  also being more civil helps too . 
  i probably would not bother much about people who spread blatantly false information . 
  you brought 3 videos and all of them contained st. george ribbon in first few minutes . 
  what a joke . 
  you did n't even check the videos , because you was absolutely sure that the st. george ribbon was n't used before putin . 
  try to be more critical to propaganda from your country . 
   i did n't say that russian propaganda machinery invented it , but they revived it to today 's extent . 
  nobody revived it , because it never was forgotten . 
  it always was a major symbol of the victory . 
  its popularity was boosted in 2005 by ria , but it did n't change its meaning . 
  just proposed to use already well-known st. george ribbon by ordinary people . 
  it 's not like it 's a very original idea to wear ribbons to show your support for some cause and st. george ribbon was already known . 
   does that justify violating international law and the territorial integrity of ukraine ? 
  no , it doesnt it 's another way around . 
  russian intervention does n't justify thugs attacking tourists because they do n't subscribe for ukrainian official nationalist ideology . 
  it does n't justify nazi battalions , worshiping to bandera , whitewashing upa , institutional nationalism in a multi-national country , shelling donetsk with heavy mlrs , total censorship , discriminating minorities , and doing stupid shit that harms ukraine in the first place . 
  ukrainian problems in a significant part are self-imposed . 
  they are not just victims , but also the perpetrators and the main architects of their own problems . 
  and of course our bloodless intervention was entirely justified . 
  we saved the crimeans from all this nationalist circus and let them self-identify . 
  i see just nothing wrong in that , it was a net win for everyone , except ukrainian nationalists in kyiv . 
  western crocodile tears are irrelevant -- they should make a break from attacking a new country every few years , if they want to lecture other countries about international law . 
  just like the guy with a ukrainian flag who got `` irl downvoted '' during the celebration of 3rd anniversary of reunification of crimea with russia ? 
  but as far as i remember / r/europe did n't try to blame the victim that time . 
  :d it 's funny , that people here are ready to justify all and every shit from ukrainian nationalists . 
  zero self-reflection combined with religious belief that you are right , while the opposing side is wrong and brainwashed . 
  well , the world is simple and black & white , russia is evil , ukraine is good , is n't it ? 
   not condoning what happened , but lol . 
   the st george 's ribbon is basically a propaganda item by the russian government yeah , since catherine the great to 1917 , and then since 1942 when the st. george ribbon was revived as the guard ribbon . 
  it was one of the major symbols of the victory in wwii since 1945 , when it was used for [ the victory medal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medal_%22for_the_victory_over_germany_in_the_great_patriotic_war_1941%e2%80%931945%22 ) . 
   considering all the death and destruction russia has exerted onto ukraine maybe ukraine is guilty too ? 
  just a little bit ? 
  when it alienated part of its own population , when it tried to enforce on them official nationalist ideology they did n't agree with ? 
  maybe majority of crimean and donbass population had some reasons to hate ukraine ? 
  russia attacked and all , but people do n't just become separatists out of nothing . 
  that 's all russian propaganda .

  partial blindness ? 
  you probably did n't see any nazis on maidan as well . 
  it was n't used as a wearable ribbon , but it was a major symbol of the victory . 
   source [ 1 ] `` ukraine breaks from russia in commemorating victory '' . 
  kyiv post . 
  retrieved 8 may 2015 yeah , some authoritative source right here , totally not propaganda . 
  st. george ribbon was the symbol of the victory since forever , it was a part of the [ medal `` for the victory over germany in the great patriotic war 1941 -- 1945 '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medal_%22for_the_victory_over_germany_in_the_great_patriotic_war_1941%e2%80%931945%22 ) . 
  check just google search in [ soviet postcards dedicated to 9 may ] ( https://www.google.ru/search?q=9+%d0%bc%d0%b0%d1%8f+%d1%81%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b5%d1%82%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%b5+%d0%be%d1%82%d0%ba%d1%80%d1%8b%d1%82%d0%ba%d0%b8&amp;newwindow=1&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x ) . 
  majority of them used st. george ribbon in some way . 
  it 's just bs that the ribbon had no public significance . 
  it 's true that as a wearable ribbon it was used only since 2005 , and this new use was proposed by ria journalists . 
  however , ria of 2005 was n't this propaganda mouthpiece it is today , it happened long before 2013 when it was overtaken by dmitry kisyelov , so i see literally nothing wrong here . 
  try to stop reading ukrainian propaganda . 
  a blank book `` reasons to vote for democrats : a comprehensive guide '' recently topped amazon bestsellers list . 
  sure , russia is not really a democratic country , but you 've used a different argument , you 've tried to milk `` poor crimean tatars oppressed by ebul russia '' narrative . 
  kiev and its western backers love to use this tatar card -- while kiev did n't care about the tatars not even in the slightest when crimea was a part of ukraine . 
  anyway , it 's really hard to feel any sympathy to meijlis activists , who blew up electricity pylons to cut crimea from electricity and who are trying to bring to russia the chaos from ukraine . 
  it 's just a fringe group , they do n't and they ca n't represent interests of the crimean tatars . 
  also , kde is german , the document foundation ( org behind libreoffice ) is german , qt is finnish ... 
  yes , it was the soviet union , but it does n't exist anymore . 
  however , ukraine has similar privileges for other categories of victims , but not for the deported people . 
  [ a speech from 2013 ] ( http://urokiistorii.ru/history/soc/51980 ) ( google translate ) :  i will come back to this issue when we talk about other payments , but for now i would like to say about those categories of repressed people that are not mentioned in the law at all . 
  if we are talking about representatives of repressed peoples , then these are crimean tatars , greeks , bulgarians , etc. 
  ( victims of deportations from the crimea during and after the second world war ) . 
  in addition , these are large-scale deportations of ukrainians , connected with the ukrainian-polish relations at the end and after the war , and deportations for the complicity of the upa , which affected about two million people . 
  ** in fact , this is a huge array of repressed people , and they seem to fall under article 3 of the law , but the last point in the decree to enact this law says that this article does not apply to representatives of deported ** peoples . 
  in relation to those , an attempt was made to adopt a new law , this was the responsibility of the crimean tatars themselves . 
  unfortunately , they only baked themselves , they did not talk about the rehabilitation of victims of deportations on ethnic grounds . 
  but ** even the crimean tatars could not achieve the adoption of such a law ** , and to date , some crimean tatars are trying to defend their right to property in court , for example , to sue the current owners of the house in which they lived about deportation . 
  but these are long property disputes in which the court can not rely on any regulatory legal act on rehabilitation . 
   so , one category of `` disadvantaged '' is representatives of deported peoples , the second is the children of repressed people . 
  we repeatedly raised the issue publicly and at meetings with deputies , there were even committee hearings in the parliament . 
  we said that people living in russia and ukraine , subjected to virtually identical repression , are in an unequal position . 
  ** in russia , after a well-known decision of the constitutional court , the law was changed and the status of the victim from political repression was introduced .
