  in ukraine , there is nothing like this . 
  ** we have seen repeatedly how the elderly who moved to their children from russia ( where they had status and benefits ) to ukraine , lost all rights . 
  this is direct discrimination . 
  there were many attempts in which we also participated , to compel the parliament to pass such laws , there were more than a dozen bills , and one of them even passed the first reading in 2010 . 
  but this all stalled . 
  the law on the rehabilitation of victims of political repression in ukraine since 1991 has not changed at all . 
  this category of people - the children of the repressed , as well as their widows or widowers - are not at all covered by law . 
  in fact ukraine just did n't give a fuck about the crimean tatars when crimea was a part of ukraine . 
  they started to use the crimean tatar card for political gains after 2014 . 
  yes , the deportation of the crimean tatars is officially recognized as a crime . 
  the victims ( including people were born after the deportation ) receive benefits and privileges , e.g. 
  they pay 50 % for utilities , drugs , can use public transportation for free . 
  they did n't get shit in ukraine . 
  there were large official ceremonies commemorating the deportation today : * ceremonies in bakhchysarai with top crimean leadership : http://crimea.ria.ru/society/20170518/1110423871.html ( i know people here dislike ria , but it contains photos ) * [ armyansk ] ( http://1tvcrimea.ru/pages/news/063982-v-armjanske-vspominajut-zhertv-deportacii ) * [ students in simferopol ] ( http://1tvcrimea.ru/pages/news/063983-bolee-2000-studentov-vozlozhili-cvety-k-monumentu-v-krymskom-inzhenerno-pedagog ) i do n't why the person on the pic was detained , but he was n't arrested , he was detained for a few hours ( or probably even less -- maybe even not detained at all ) . 
  well , it 's not hard to me to apologize to poland right here for atrocities during soviet-polish war , repressions against ethnic poles during the great terror in 1937-1938 , for 1939 ( lwow is the rightful polish clay ) , katyn , warsaw 1944 , and soviet occupation . 
  i know very well that russia was n't always a good guy , a victim or a liberator , it was a perpetrator as well . 
  katyn is officially recognized by russia as a stalin 's crime , it 's in school textbooks . 
  but these regular five minutes of hate against russians , these regular comparisons with the nazis in this sub are still pathetic . 
  without us , orcs of mordor , in a likely course of event the poles would just cease to exist . 
  unlike the nazis the soviet union never planned to exterminate the poles and it never considered the poles as some kind of second sort people . 
  stalin killed a lot of poles , but he killed a lot of ethnic russians as well , often extremely random people like astronomers from the pulkovo observatory . 
  i agree . 
  ukraine unfairly occupied the western ukraine . 
  you should fix that terrible historical error . 
  yeah , we all see how _ you _ decided to stop that shit with kosovo . 
   now that the shoe is on the other foot , are you going to support that as a universal precept ? 
  that would be a perfect solution . 
  i do n't care about chechnya , if they would contain themselves inside of their borders . 
  russia accepted the chechen sovereignty in 1996 , [ the peace treaty was signed ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%94%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%be%d1%80_%d0%be_%d0%bc%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%b5_%d0%b8_%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b8%d0%bd%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%bf%d0%b0%d1%85_%d0%b2%d0%b7%d0%b0%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%be%d0%be%d1%82%d0%bd%d0%be%d1%88%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b9_%d0%bc%d0%b5%d0%b6%d0%b4%d1%83_%d0%a0%d0%a4_%d0%b8_%d0%a7%d0%a0%d0%98 ) . 
  but then maskhadov 's government collapsed , and salafi islamists basaev , khattab & co. started to build their caucasus emirate , invaded dagestan , blew up shit in russia . 
  at this point it did n't matter if they were a separate country or just a part of russia , it was just self-defense . 
  afghanistan was n't part of the us , but the us went there after 9/11 . 
   what happens if some portion of your country -- especially , say , a town on a river , something that cuts off access to upstream russia did n't cut access to anything , it did n't poison the ukrainian well , it did n't destroy some ecosystem . 
  it was ukraine who blocked electricity , water and goods for crimea . 
  what did the ukrainians lose exactly from the `` annexation '' ? 
  they are still free to travel to crimea visa-free like always . 
  the main ukrainian port is in odessa , not crimea . 
  just some borders were moved on the map . 
  the only thing ukraine really lost were 2 millions of people who voted for yanukovich and did n't care about ukraine and hated its european projects . 
  crimea is not just a town ( some go further and compare it with one house or flat wanting independence ) . 
  crimea in independent ukraine was an autonomous republic with almost 2m population , it 's larger than some eu countries . 
  they had their own constitution and certain autonomy , an autonomous republic was just one level lower than a soviet socialist republic in the ussr . 
   i do n't think that russia , as a country , would support that . 
  their _ support _ does n't matter . 
  they need to be realistic and _ accept _ that . 
  it 's not going to change anyway . 
  and start to act pragmatically without doing stupid emotional tricks like suddenly cutting electricity to crimea -- it 's not doing anything good to anyone . 
   we do n't know what crimeans we know what they want very well , because there were tons of polls , including polls by western pollsters like gfk and gallup , all of them show ~ 90 % of support of reunification with russia . 
  it does n't mean that 10 % wants to get back to ukraine , most of the rest just do n't care . 
  it was n't similar to brexit or trump 's election when few percents decided the winner . 
  with this overwhelming support of russia , small details just do n't matter , any fair referendum would bring the same result . 
  btw , one of the polls was ordered by taras beresovets ( pro-poroshenko ukrainian political `` consultant '' ) , and he did n't get the results he wanted . 
  check his interview with rf/erl : https://ru.krymr.com/a/27129465.html -- of course , it 's full of bs , but even according to him 82 % of crimeans supported joining russia . 
   even if you claim there was no real/intentional intimidation , just seeing those soldiers there when you vote is an intimidation . 
  2014 presidential and parliamentary elections in donbass were not legal then . 
  also , they had ridiculously low turnout , unlike turnout of _ at least _ 75 % of `` intimidated '' people in the crimean referendum . 
  and this intimidation -- it 's just an excuse to not recognize crimean 's will . 
  they are intimidated , had to vote under barrel of gun . 
  they are zombies , tv told them to vote , they voted . 
  they are brainwashed by putin 's propaganda . 
  they are rats , who betrayed ukraine . 
  the referendum is null and void , because both answers were the same . 
  no , they just do n't want to live in ukraine . 
  there is not a single rational reason , why the crimeans would prefer ukraine over russia . 
   why was there not a protest movement after 1954 up to the dissilution of ussr to make crimea russian ? 
  there were protests against it . 
  see the crimean referendum of 1990 , the [ declaration of state sovereignty of 1992 ] ( http://zakon3.rada.gov.ua/krym/show/rb001d002-91?test=4/umfpegznhhi8p.zinijbx/hi4ias80msh8ie6 ) and the [ crimean referendum of 1994 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_referendum,_1994 ) for greater sovereignty ( supported by 78 % ) . 
  ukraine in response just scrapped the crimean constitution and deposed the crimean president . 
   russians outside of russia proper had no concept that they were in a different country when living in the baltics or ukraine until 1991 . 
  i agree . 
  these issues had to be resolved during the dissolution of the ussr -- majority russian crimea should have never been a part of independent ukraine , or mostly armenian nagorny karabakh should not be a part of azerbaijan . 
  sadly , with the alcoholic in the seat of the leader it was the mission impossible . 
  luckily , the problem with crimea was fixed 23 years later . 
   there were foreign troops on ukrainian soil who stole the land . 
  without these foreign troops , the referendum would be forcefully suppressed by ukraine . 
  do n't forget that the referendum was declared by legitimate at that moment ukrainian authorities of the autonomous republic of crimea . 
   german of the sudetenland also applauded the anshluss . 
  i do n't think the annexation of sudetenland was entirely wrong . 
  things that _ followed _ the annexation were entirely wrong . 
  sudetenland had like 90 % of germans , it was a recipe for disaster that eventually really happened . 
  stage 1 . 
  denial . 
  i even cited the sources used for the map -- similarweb and alexa . 
  * http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/ee * https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/estonia, 
  savik shuster 's show in russia was closed in 2004 for some phony reasons . 
  savik shuster 's show in ukraine was closed in 2016 for some phony reasons . 
  so some parallels are obvious . 
  but full russian model in ukraine is unlikely , because poroshenko has no power of putin . 
  some lighter model -- maybe . 
  i 'm not sure that oligarch-owned media ( russia of 1990s and modern ukraine ) is much better for a country , however . 
  it 's both . 
  article 1 of the russian constitution :  the russian federation - russia is a democratic federal law-bound state with a republican form of government . 
   the names `` russian federation '' and `` russia '' shall be equal . 
  it 's up to the crimeans to select their way , not to a bunch of ukrainian nationalists in kiev . 
  if crimea ever was stolen , it was stolen from russia in 1954 by khruschev who ignored opinion of the crimeans . 
  the thing that happened in 2014 is called `` self-determination '' . 
  crimeans ca n't steal from themselves . 
  could you finally realize that the crimeans just do n't want to live in ukraine and never wanted to live there ? 
  and why should they ? 
  at this point ukraine is worse than russia in every thinkable way .
