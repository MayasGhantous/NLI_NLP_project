   so do n't try to equate the eu to russia . 
  it 's a ridiculous comparison . 
  i 've commented on the fragment related to 2013 . 
  neither russian intervention nor the western-backed coup happened at the moment . 
  no , sorry , but russia is doing better . 
  ukraine blocked 4 sites out of ukrainian top 10 ( [ alexa ] ( http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/ua ) , [ similarweb ] ( https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/ukraine ) ) , while russia blocks only 1 site out of the russian top 50 , and it 's a torrent tracker . 
  as much as i dislike any censorship , rutracker 's service is entirely illegal and torrent sites are blocked in many european countries , not just russia . 
  even rutracker was blocked after several court decisions , not just with a presidential executive order . 
  it 's a huge qualitative difference , russia and ukraine are not even in the same league of censorship . 
  ukrainian level of censorship is unprecedented for a european country , it 's closer to uzbekistan/turkmenistan/iran and so on . 
  they absolutely can sue vk , but vk will just delete the copyrighted content . 
  also , vk makes moves to legalize its content , they 've deployed music id system to block uploading of copyrighted tracks several years ago , and recently made a deal with the major labels : [ mail.ru group and united music agency partner with universal music , sony music and warner music to license media content for social networks ] ( https://corp.mail.ru/en/press/releases/9660/ ) . 
  dailymotion contained some full tv shows of `` friday '' channel . 
  generally this shit gets immediately wiped from youtube or vk , because tv right holders are pretty stringent . 
  according to fridaytv , they 've asked dailymotion to remove the videos several times , but the requests were ignored ( for example , revizorro [ is still there ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/us/relevance/universal/search/%d0%a0%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%b8%d0%b7%d0%be%d1%80%d1%80%d0%be/1 ) ) . 
  then fridaytv went to court and dailymotion was blocked . 
   yandex announced that media that is not registered with roskomnadzor , the state media monitoring agency will see its stories disappear from the front page of yandex news as well as regional and subject pages yandex in russia have to comply with russian laws , no shit . 
  it 's not relevant for yandex news in ukraine . 
  it aggregates all ukrainian news sources , even censor.net.ua . 
  feel free to check it yourself : https://news.yandex.ua/, 
  it 's the half-truth , or even the quarter-turth . 
   to stop ukraine from going forward with its desire for a free-trade agreement with the european union . 
  ukrainians had approximately the same support for both the custom union and eu association in 2013 . http://imgur.com/a/1rrlk in 2012 the cu had a bit more support than the eu . 
  and arguably , the customs union made much more economic sense for ukraine , russia was its largest trading partner . 
  it was n't at all obvious that ukraine had to go the eu way back then . 
  but carl bildt makes it look like the evil is trying to stop ukrainian desire to go to the good side . 
   a heavy propaganda offensive in ukraine russia indeed used propaganda against the eu association agreement , but so did the west . 
  for example , [ propagandist cartoons ] ( http://tyzhden.ua/gallery/89753/ ) comparing life in the customs union and life in the eu were directly sponsored by swedish embassy : http://imgur.com/a/toote and now the very same carl bildt , who was swedish mfa back then , whines about russian propaganda against free-trade agreement with the eu . 
  i just do n't see what we won from the war in donbass . 
  russia achieved extremely little , but lost a lot . 
  it was a defeat for everyone involved -- for russia , for ukraine , for donbass . 
  and , of course , it greatly helped nationalist forces in ukraine , support for nato membership in ukraine significantly raised : http://imgur.com/a/ujoad second pic is from late march 2014 , after the crimean referendum -- bloodless reunification with crimea alone was n't enough to turn ukraine into an enemy , unlike the botched conflict with ~ 10k dead . 
  i think that war in donbass shows very clearly that putin really had no clear plan , or his plan was awfully poor . 
  he acts reactively in ad hoc ways , sometimes it works out , sometimes it does n't . 
  esforce holding ltd owned by usmanov recently [ invested ~ $ 10m in na ` vi ] ( https://ain.ua/2016/07/27/kibersportivnyj-klub-natus-vincere-zaklyuchil-sdelku-na-10-mln-s-byvshim-virtus-pro ) , buying at least their media rights , maybe something more . 
  so when you are cheering for navi , you are literally cheering for putin . 
  or maybe something is broken in your `` guilty by association '' logic . 
  if vk is directly controlled by kremlin , why do nationalist ukrainian groups like azov , \u03a8 \u041c\u0418 \u041f\u0410\u0422\u0420\u0406\u041e\u0422\u0418 \u0423\u041a\u0420\u0410\u0407\u041d\u0418 \u03a8 , ukrainian nastup , etc. 
  use vk ? 
   reminder , de facto we are in war with russia lol , no . 
  if you would be in _ de facto _ war in russia , ukraine would not exist at this point . 
  you may had a point in 2014-2015 , when small russian forces directly intervened in the war in donbass , but since minsk-ii ( february 2015 ) war against russia just not the case neither _ de jure _ nor _ de facto _ . 
   vk isnt facebook of post-soviet countries . 
  it is . 
  http://vincos.it/world-map-of-social-networks/ ( according to alexa and similarweb , not personal anecdotes like `` i do n't know anyone using vk '' ) . 
  when did ukraine declare war on russia ? 
  did ukraine at least declare state of martial law ? 
   i do very much hope ukraine does n't develop it 's own version of roskomnadzor . 
  as much as i hate roskomnadzor , they never did anything of that scale of stupidity , just blocking half of the web out of blue . 
  so far no major site is blocked in russia , with exception of rutracker and some other torrent/piracy sites , dailymotion ( for piracy ) , linkedin ( something about personal information , but linkedin never was big in russia ) and some messengers . 
   in your opinion , could the russian government ban entire wikipedia ? 
  so far it looks unlikely , but everything can change to the worse quickly . 
  formally speaking , roscomnadzor was able to block wikipedia back in 2012 , because some of its pages were immediately added to the list of forbidden sites -- for example , [ suicide methods ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suicide_methods ) and [ vaporizer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaporizer_ ( inhalation_device \\ ) ) ( yes , even english articles ) . 
  some pages were removed from the list since then , but [ few are still there ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%92%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%bf%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b8%d1%8f:%d0%a1%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%86%d1%8b_%d0%92%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%bf%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%b8,_%d0%b2%d0%bd%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%91%d0%bd%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b5_%d0%b2_%d0%95%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%82%d1%80_%d0%b7%d0%b0%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b5%d1%89%d1%91%d0%bd%d0%bd%d1%8b%d1%85_%d1%81%d0%b0%d0%b9%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b2 ) -- mdma , amphetamines , cocaine , self-immolation , suicide and suicide methods . 
  in 2015 roskomnadzor tried to force russian wikipedia to remove some information from article `` charas '' and wikipedia was on the edge of blocking . 
  russian wikipedian community declined to bow to roskomnadzor and delete well-sourced information ( iirc , the contested fragment was based on some textbook for police officially published in russia by a major publishing house ) , and started to prepare for blocking instead . 
  however , in the last moment roskomnadzor have stepped back , but claimed the victory -- according to them , wikipedia changed the article to comply with their demands ( it was a lie ) . 
  they clearly avoid to block major websites like wikipedia . 
  there was a proposal recently to slow-down major websites like google instead of blocking them . 
   do many people in russia use it or would it go unnoticed ? 
  it 's in top 10 most popular websites in russia and 5th country by wikipedia 's traffic consumption : https://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/squidreportpageviewspercountrybreakdown.htm , so it would be noticed . 
  well , even that protest was n't unanimously supported by the whole community of the russian wikipedia . 
  many though that wikipedia should stay away from politics , and that the proposed laws were not directly relevant to wikipedia . 
  if i remember correctly , there was even some arbcom decision that punished the admins that organized the voting for that protest , because they did n't follow some procedure or something like that . 
  also , significant part ( if not majority ) of russian wikipedian community is pro-putin and they tend to seek for some compromise instead of antagonizing to the government . 
  fuck the jury that sunk belgium and romania . 
  at least spain deservedly got the last place . 
  the most boring shit is leading . 
  the whole top 5 is hopeless . 
  russian wikipedia used similar thing to protest against internet censorship laws : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/protest_of_the_russian_wikipedia_%28july_2012%29.jpg of course , it was ignored . 
  belgium has amazing songs several eurovisions in the row . 
  this is cringeworthy . 
  please , stop and never make jokes again . 
  she did n't pass far , but pelageya worked with her later ( pelageya is a famous folk song performer in russia ) . 
  old memes are old . 
  she participated in russian the voice under coaching of pelageya .

  [ kommersant reports ] ( https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2979489 ) that prosvechenie 's market share for elementary school textbooks in moscow grew from 0.23 % in 2013 to 93 % in 2015 . 
  the problem is real . 
  i 've googled a bit and found that 2016 textbook edited by torkunov and published by prosveschenie . 
  http://imgur.com/a/t8ovv google translate :  september 1 , 1939 , germany attacked poland . 
  england and france declared war on germany . 
  thus began the bloodiest war in world history . 
  on september 17 , when the polish government had already left the country , parts of the red army were ordered to cross the western border and liberate the territories of western ukraine and western belorussia . 
  the soviet troops practically did not meet resistance . 
  polish soldiers were massively surrendered in the east . 
  their fate has developed in many ways , for many tragically . 
  thousands of polish officers were later shot in the katyn forest near smolensk . 
   [ ... ]  in the autumn of 1939 , the ussr proposed estonia , latvia and lithuania to conclude mutual assistance agreements . 
  they contained provisions on the deployment of red army troops on the territory of these states . 
  during october-november 1939 such agreements were concluded . 
   [ ... several paragraphs about the winter war ... ]  the soviet union also suffered certain political losses . 
  in december 1939 , it was expelled from the membership of the league of nations . 
   in june 1940 , the ussr , under the pretext of hostile activity against the garrisons of soviet troops in the baltic states , demanded the formation of new governments in them . 
  the parliamentary elections led to the victory of pro-communist forces and the formation of people 's governments , which asked them to join the ussr . 
  in august 1940 , latvia , lithuania and estonia became soviet socialist republics . 
   in june 1940 , under pressure from the ussr , romania transferred control over bessarabia and northern bukovina to him . 
  in august 1940 , the moldavian ssr was formed , and northern bukovina became part of the ukrainian ssr . 
  yeah ... basically , it 's pretty similar to the soviet textbooks . 
  it mentions stalin 's repressions and deportations later , but it 's far from the main focus .
