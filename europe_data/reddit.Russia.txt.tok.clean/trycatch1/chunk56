  it 's not the only certified textbook , certified textbook published by drofa is much better : http://imgur.com/a/qrjn4 it mentions secret protocol to the molotov-ribbentrop pact , the map that compares the spheres of influence in the protocol and real territorial changes , explicitly put the responsibility for katyn on the ussr , mentions repressions and deportations in poland , repressions and deportations in baltic states and so on . 
  however , it 's likely that prosveschenie 's textbook will be pushed on schools , because `` prosveschenie '' publishing house is owned by rotenberg . 
  western solution : 1 . 
  destroy assad 's regime . 
  let it be overrun by long-bearded `` moderate '' salafi head-choppers . 
  syria is a democracy now . 
  indeed , russia blocked this `` solution '' . 
  and it 's good . 
  because any _ realistic _ solution of this conflict in the foreseeable future have to include assad , if you do n't want to turn syria into country controlled by salafi islamists in the chaos of perpetual civil war . 
   propping up the syrian regime with all kinds of support yeah ... it would be much better to let ( or even to help ) assad collapse , giving up aleppo to al-nusra and damascus to jaish al-islam , right ? 
  supporting the legitimate syrian government is bad , but arming the islamist rebels allied with al-qaeda is somehow entirely fine . 
  it 's significantly less of a clusterfuck than in 2015 , when russia intervened . 
  isis is dying , eastern aleppo is not under control of aq anymore , a lot of rebel pockets are no more , aq lost strategic initiative it had in 2015 ( when idlib had fallen ) . 
  i like our intervention in syria , while i am not a fan of putin . 
   honestly i do n't care about russia and russians honestly , judging by your posts russia and russians is the only thing you care about in your life . 
   you can cry all you want shills , but without triggering article 5 there is no fucking way russia will provoke us into an attack . 
  danish aviation directly participated in bombing of both serbia and libya . 
  when did they attack a nato country , i 've missed that part ? 
   fun thing about a defensive pact fun thing that some truly really believe in that bullshit . 
  or maybe you just consider everyone else idiots ? 
   stop the propaganda friend . 
  indeed . 
  please , stop repeating propaganda . 
  did you even [ read the unsc resolution 1973 ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council_resolution_1973 ) in question ? 
  it allowed to use force only to establish no-fly zone and protect civilians -- and that 's it . 
  instead the western countries immediately used the resolution as a blank cheque to intervene on the side of the rebels . 
  moreover , they armed the rebels violating the arms embargo from the previous unsc resolution . 
  that 's why while russia agreed on resolution 1973 , it vetoed all the similar resolutions on syria -- because the west demonstrated that it ca n't be trusted violating the compromise on libya . 
  yes , rogozin was significantly downgraded . 
  he was the leader of one of the major parties . 
   i also loved that ad of rodina from 2005 with rogozin and motto `` let 's rid moscow of trash '' ... you forgot to say that the ad was recognized as xenophobic and banned , while rodina was removed from moscow elections . 
  in several months after the ad rogozin was kicked out of rodina . 
   he apparently wanted to do the salute so hard that whoever was editing the video had an urge to edit that exact moment to look like one ? 
  what the hell are you talking about . 
  the video was n't edited . 
  `` glory to russia ! '', 
  and the gesture are clearly visible on both videos . 
  try to watch without rose-tinted glasses . 
   somebody remembering shit does n't make it true . 
  dat denial . 
  at least three witnesses confirm it . 
  at least two other persons ( [ one ] ( http://shuum.ru/opinion/31 ) , [ two ] ( http://boutique.az/view/4514 ) ) from yabloko confirm that he called a female colleague from azerbaijan '' \u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0436\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0439 '' ( black assed ) and recommended her to shut up and go trade on a marketplace . 
  his blog from 2000s is full of racial slurs , he participated in russian marches from the start , he allied with other nazi organizations like rogozin 's great russia and demushkin 's dpni -- and you are still in denial . 
  are dpni totally not nazis as well ? 
  have the courage to admit that navalny is an ethnic nationalist , their worst kind -- that consider other ethnicities inferior . 
  inb4 lies , lies !, 
  navalny is a saint , yabloko are putin 's agents !, 
   so you can safely assume that if there is no hard proof of him doing something bad it simply did n't happen . 
  there are a lot of proofs of navalny doing `` something bad '' , but navalny 's supporters are deep in denial about their fuhrer . 
  basically , navalny 's worshipers are not very different from putin 's worshipers . 
  neither of them are ready to look at their dearest leader critically . 
  well , members of yabloko remember navalny doing the same gesture nazi salute + `` glory to russia ! '', 
  ( it 's a pretty traditional formula for russian nazis ) when he was kicked out of yabloko for nationalism . 
  http://echo.msk.ru/blog/boris_vis/1141290-echo/ navalny certainly publicly used `` glory to russia ! '', 
  gesture : https://youtu.be/lxktkj_r45m?t=1145 ( i am sorry about that guy . 
  he clearly wanted to do a nazi salute , but there were people around recording him ) . 
  it was an anti-government rally , it 's not like they ever had any state support . 
  some of these nazis are in prison nowadays , their organizations are banned . 
  for example , two major leaders of the russian marches were [ demushkin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dmitry_demushkin ) and [ potkin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_potkin ) -- demushkin got 2.5 years just a few days ago , potkin got 6.5 years in 2016 . 
  rogozin himself was brushed off , he was kicked out of rodina and his new nationalist party [ great russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_russia_ ( political_party \\ ) ) was denied registration . 
  putin is a charismatic leader . 
  it 's not a given that his successor would be able to stay as popular as putin , even having great starting conditions . 
  see for example collapse of medvedev 's approval rating : http://www.levada.ru/2017/04/27/aprelskie-rejtingi-odobreniya-i-doveriya-5/, 
  in that sense -- yeah . 
  edit : to expand a bit , from imf-published article [ `` the imf and russia in the 1990s '' ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2004/wp04155.pdf ) :  some months later , a story emerged that the money had been stolen and ended up in the bank accounts of people close to the president and government leaders . 
  there was no truth to this : the documents purporting to prove it were forged , and a detailed audit of the cbr 's reserves found that they had been used to support the ruble , as was intended they should be , if needed, 
  realistically speaking , he has 0.0000 % chances to win in 2018 or even pass to the second round . 
  the gap between putin and anyone else [ is just too huge ] ( http://www.levada.ru/2017/05/02/elektoralnyj-rejting-vozmozhnyh-kandidatov-v-prezidenty/ ) . 
  while i agree that the program is weak and populist , it just does n't matter . 
  voting for navalny is more of a message than anything else . 
  elections of 2024 and 2030 would be far more interesting , of course , if putin will not change the constitution to declare himself eternal dearest president . 
  i mostly agree with you , but 1 . 
  i strongly doubt that zyuganov would be any better than yeltsin . 
  idea that the us rigged 1996 elections looks like a conspiracy theory . 
  both wciom and fom predicted yeltsin 's victory . 
  yeltin 's victory was confirmed by retrospective poll in 2006 . 
  there were no significant statistical irregularities in 1996 , unlike the recent putin 's elections . 
  see these posts for a discussion of the arguments about rigging : http://kireev.livejournal.com/660975.html http://kireev.livejournal.com/758035.html, 
  oil prices halved over the course of a few months in 2014 , _ then _ ruble collapsed ( it had little to do with reunification with crimea ) and we had some rough time . 
  the situation had stabilized since than , imf projects 1.4 % gdp growth this year . 
  at worst what we have today is stagnation . 
  no doom , no gloom . 
  singapore leaders are smart as fuck . 
  their current pm studied math in trinity college cambridge and was the [ senior wrangler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/senior_wrangler_ ( university_of_cambridge \\ ) ) . 
  to those who are unfamiliar with the term :  the senior wrangler is the top mathematics undergraduate at cambridge university in england , a position which has been described as `` the greatest intellectual achievement attainable in britain . 
   or critical journalists that are murdered under mysterious circumstances . 
  that 's a huge article . 
  according to that very article , majority of these journalists were killed for reasons not related for their journalistic activity -- that 's why there are [ j ] , [ ? j ] and [ nj ] tags . 
  even some journalists with [ j ] tag were killed in crossfires or in terrorist attacks , so while their deaths _ are _ linked their journalistic activity there were more or less random victims . 
  it 's just silly to sell a death of a war reporter in war zone as a putin 's fault . 
  some like anastasia baburova were killed by nazis , who had nothing to do with putin or the state , and who had been caught and prosecuted . 
  and there were no less killed journalists in the yeltsin 's years -- the opposite is true actually . 
  [ according to the committee to protect journalists ] ( https://cpj.org/killed/europe/russia/ ) , there were 30 killed journalists in 1990s ( motive confirmed ) , and 26 in 17 years since 2000 . 
  it 's just too high-density , and uses yards for parking . 
  would they place the buildings , say , twice further , there would be more space for living environment and urban improvements . 
  that denial . 
  medvedev 's approval rating [ plummeted ] ( http://www.levada.ru/2017/04/27/aprelskie-rejtingi-odobreniya-i-doveriya-5/ ) by 10 percent points after the release of `` he is not dimon to you '' because of _ shkolota _ as well , i guess . 
   navalny is a populist clown who also happens to be right wing . 
  he puts trump and le pen to shame , and yet foreigners consider him as credible opposition . 
  trump has been elected as the us president for fuck 's sake , le pen passed the first round .
