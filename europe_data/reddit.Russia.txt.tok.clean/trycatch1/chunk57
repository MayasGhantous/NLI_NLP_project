  being populist does n't make him irrelevant . 
  he will be fine , but while the previous time he turned everything into a joke , this time navalny was noticeable angry and annoyed . 
  it 's probably not nice when you feel strong pain in your eye and everything around looks like you are in the emerald city . 
   apparently , he was being attacked at the time for some reason by these hyper-nationalists and responded in his program . 
  yeah , he was attacked for `` trumpomania '' and `` cult of trump '' in his shows . 
  meanwhile nod 's youth division coordinator katasonova [ promotes le pen ] ( https://mianews.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17629957_10212004934668995_8985977921420642004_n.jpg ) . 
  he lives in russia , he is not hiding , he has two suspended sentences , it 's very easy to imprison him any moment they want . 
  moreover , so far his videos and his site are not blocked , his organization fbk is not banned , while it can be done in the blink of an eye . 
  attack on navalny is the top discussed news in all russian media that reported it at all . 
  2000 comments on lenta , for example . 
  and he is not just an internet celebrity . 
  ~ 50 % of russians know about navalny , he got 27 % on moscow mayoral elections -- being blacklisted from all state-controlled media . 
   ca n't the authorities regulate the dye away ? 
  it 's not just dye , it 's an active ingredient . 
   reminds me of pro-trump people in the u.s. nod is a pretty marginal movement , because their ideology of american occupation is obviously insane + they promote distrust to russian government . 
  it was even ridiculed by the state tv . 
  dmitry kisyelov called them a traveling circus of nutjobs and said `` i pity the people manipulated by them '' in his weekly news programme . 
  but they are useful for attacks on the opposition and alike . 
  [ brilliant green ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brilliant_green_ ( dye \\ ) ) is an extremely popular antiseptic in post-soviet countries . 
  every household has it . 
  it 's absolutely safe , unless it contacts with eyes , like in this case . 
  it 's more humiliating than dangerous , because it 's hard to wash it off . 
  i think these attacks were recently popularised by pro-putin groups like nod -- national liberation movement ( they think that russia is a us colony currently , most of russian government are in fact american agents -- except putin , and we need to fight against the occupation scrapping the constitution and giving to putin more rights ) . 
  it seems they have a free hand in these attacks . 
  varlamov is one of the top bloggers in russia , maybe the top blogger . 
  he has architectural education , and writes about urban planning , mostly in genre `` shitty rushka '' . 
  typical posts ( in russian , but photographs say it all ) - [ sorry , finns , we fucked up ] ( http://varlamov.ru/2334638.html ) about vyborg/viipuri , [ terrible omsk , part 1 ] ( http://varlamov.ru/1634146.html ) , [ bad nizhnyy novgorod ] ( http://varlamov.ru/2280131.html ) and so on . 
  he also makes posts about `` good [ city ] '' , but he is not known for that . 
  not unexpectedly , posts like these make locals butthurt . 
  this time he announced that will travel to stavropol to photograph [ one especially terrible district ] ( http://imgur.com/a/tt5dj ) of new human hive-like commieblocks . 
  the owners of the district did n't expect from varlamov 's review anything good and decided to launch preemptive strike and attacked varlamov in the airport . 
  they are heroes because they defended their country , their home from fascist plague and were successful in that . 
  they fought against extremely strong enemy and won , despite extreme hardships . 
  thanks to them the new generations of nazis can only whine about ebul russkies in / r/europe . 
  whine more , but if you 'll try to invade russia again , i am afraid russians would not be so generous to people like you . 
  wow , we kicked nazis so well , that their butts are still on fire . 
  that 's heartwarming . 
  yes , it was better . 
  in 1989 russia had natural growth +577 k , in 1992 natural decline -220 k ( -750 k in 1993 ) , number of homicides jumped from 13k to 23k ( and then to 32k in 1995 ) , life expectancy decreased from 69.2 years to 66.9 ( and to 64.5 in 1994 ) . 
  it would make more sense to compare 1989 to , say , 1995 when the `` shock therapy '' kicked in in full , but even 3 years were enough . 
  it was worse in every meaningful metric , kid memory is a bad source . 
   the west had no obligation to give russia free money . 
  the west does n't owe russia anything , but russia does n't owe the west anything as well . 
  russia must only care about its own people and its own national interests . 
  our partnerships should be beneficial for russia , international agreements should be selected for pragmatic reasons . 
  the short pro-western period of russia was easily the most catastrophic decade in the whole post-war russian history . 
  the west was too triumphant demanding a lot of concessions as a given ( nuland called it `` get the russians to eat their spinach '' ) , when giving back very little -- if not actively sabotaging russian affairs -- and that 's when russia had been passing through its worst hardships . 
  for some reason the us though that forcing russian into submission was a _ fait accompli _ . 
  after some time russia understood that forfeiting our own interests and doing anything to please the us just did n't work , so it 's time to search for something new . 
  it started to happen several years before putin , mfa [ kozyrev ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrei_kozyrev ) ( who lives in miami these days , heh , what a surprise ) was replaced with primakov and so on . 
  and while that one-sided `` friendship '' with the us brought nothing good to russia , the first attempts at active independent foreign policy brought some tangible benefits like crimea ( yes , i personally need it ) . 
  so probably it 's the way russia should work in the future , unless the us will change its ways to behave . 
   the ussr got defeated [ ... ] we did not go in for the throat bite , but allowed them to create their own destiny the ussr was n't defeated by the west , but by its own people who lost faith in that project . 
  it 's always funny to westerners behaving so victorious like they defeated russia from trenches . 
  russia did n't ask for western permission in the past to select its own destiny , and is not going to do this in the future . 
  wrong tab , it 's not a dick measuring contest . 
  russia with putin is doing much better than before him in entirely catastrophical pro-western 1990s , much better than majority of ex-ussr countries and not significantly behind of other eastern european countries if behind at all . 
   no , crimea is only part of russia according to russia , that 's enough . 
  crimea is russian according to its population and the real world . 
  ukrainian crimea exists only on some irrelevant papers , in dreams and on fantasy maps . 
   no , it is because russia signed after the breakup of the soviet union , to respect ukraine borders , including crimea . 
  ukraine is free to void these bilateral agreements , if it thinks that russia violated them . 
  that said , it was a huge mistake to recognize crimea as part of ukraine , of course . 
  the crimean error had to be resolved during the collapse of soviet union or shortly after -- for example , [ after the 1994 referendum ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9a%d1%80%d1%8b%d0%bc%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%b9_%d1%80%d0%b5%d1%84%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b4%d1%83%d0%bc_1994_%d0%b3%d0%be%d0%b4%d0%b0 ) , but yeltsin had no balls . 
  nobody would remember about ukrainian history of crimea by now , because ukraine never had any moral right on crimea whatsoever and its legal claims were shaky . 
  anyway , all is good that ends good . 
  please , understand that crimeans just do n't want to live in ukraine and never wanted it . 
  let it go . 
   today , your puppet failed . 
  get used to it . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  i understand that you are buttmad , but that 's some barely intelligible mess . 
   certainly until the orange revolution in 2004 , ukraine was a close ally of russia and its imperialism . 
  what the fuck am i reading . 
  especially una-unso was a close ally , i guess . 
   also i do n't see your point . 
  my point is that you should educate yourself before doing ignorant statements with word `` imperialism '' sticked in every second sentence . 
  wikipedia is a good starting point : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria_war, 
   it is as russian as moscow is polish . 
  moscow was polish , briefly . 
  then the poles were kicked out of there for good . 
  since then - not so much . 
   it 's very heart warming to know this . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen one , but i am happy that they exist . 
  i like them too . 
  their butthurt is so funny . 
  never gets old . 
  eh , they are peacekeepers . 
  they are deployed there in agreement with moldova . 
  russia has no major independent media , all major non-state controlled tv channels were de facto nationalised in 2000s . 
  the state also actively works to drive away any potential pretender . 
  so it 's not fair to compare russian approval ratings to the us that has real competitive democracy . 
  2011-2012 protests happened mostly in moscow -- the most developed russian region and one of the richest . 
  putin 's approval rating in moscow was significantly lower than russian average , getting as low as 27 % according to levada . 
  on 2012 elections , putin got just 47 % against 63.6 % overall , it was the lowest result among all russian regions . 
  the protests were dubbed as `` middle class protests '' , it was n't a food riot , it had nothing to with suffering as the article claims . 
  the conspiratard got called out on his bullshit and it seems he did n't like it . 
  propaganda does n't have to extremely popular . 
  it 's just `` information , especially of a biased or misleading nature , used to promote a political cause or point of view '' . 
  that guy was included in the video to push their agenda -- and that 's it .
