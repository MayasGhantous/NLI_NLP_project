  he was n't used to fairly cover the topic . 
  the authors intentionally sell fringe opinion as the mainstream , that 's textbook propaganda . 
  also , the rest of the movie is just as bad -- bunch of carefully selected opinions to promote their agenda . 
  for example , [ belkovsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanislav_belkovsky ) never provided any proof whatsoever about his estimates of the putin 's estate ( $ 40-70b ) , and he routinely talks a lot of other stupid bullshit , but he is included in almost every evil putin piece -- generally without any criticism . 
  apparently , the authors just like his estimate . 
  check [ this article in bloomberg ] ( https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2013-09-17/vladimir-putin-the-richest-man-on-earth ) by bershidsky , i think it 's spot on :  the media reports , which often cite one another , ultimately tend to rely on one primary source : a november 2007 interviewgiven by a prominent member of moscow 's chattering classes , stanislav belkovsky , to the german daily die welt . 
  in the interview , he claimed that putin `` controlled '' 37 percent of the oil company surgutneftegaz and 4.5 percent of natural gas monopoly gazprom . 
  the $ 40 billion estimate of putin 's fortune was simply the 2007 market price of these stakes . 
   `` and these numbers are substantiated ? '', 
  die welt journalist manfred quiring asked . 
  `` these numbers are correct , '' belkovsky replied , and that was that . 
   interviewers regularly ask belkovsky about the $ 40 billion number . 
  `` that figure could now have changed , i believe at the level of $ 60-70 billion , '' belkovsky toldmaeve mcclenaghan of the bureau of investigative journalism . 
   there has never been the slightest bit of evidence that putin actually owns stakes in surgutneftegaz or gazprom . 
  the western journalists using belkovsky as a source either do not know who he is or print his allegations simply because they are colorful . 
  `` what game mr. belkovsky is playing -- and on whose behalf -- is unclear , '' the telegraph of london warnedin a story copiously citing belkovsky 's allegations . 
   belkovsky 's game may be mainly literary . 
  a former computer programmer turned political consultant , he has written several booksabout putin and a humorous play featuring russian political figures . 
  belkovsky 's charm , easygoing style and keen sense of the absurd have made him a popular columnist . 
  even when he suggests that russia has become a constitutional monarchy headed by michael of kent or prince harry , people listen to him as though he is partly serious . 
  oh , it seems that the brave defender of pbs quality journalism just run away . 
  nice . 
   1990 secession of transnistria from moldova , to prevent a unification with romania . 
  lol . 
  could you please educate yourself about that conflict before claiming ridiculous things ? 
  [ ukrainian nationalists fought ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_national_assembly_%e2%80%93_ukrainian_people%27s_self-defence#transnistria ) on transnistrian side in that conflict . 
  were they russian imperialists as well ? 
  oh , let 's compare entirely different countries and get arbitrary conclusions . 
  these are either small countries , or countries that were not part of the ussr . 
  the countries that are most similar to russia -- belarus and ukraine -- to put it lightly , are not doing any better than russia . 
   that completely useless link the world bank is putin 's propaganda !, 
  of course it 's useless for you , because does n't fit in your black and white worldview . 
   how about glorious russian birthrates and population decline ? 
  russia has population growth each year since 2009 . 
  fertility rate ( 1.76 ) is higher than eu average ( 1.58 ) . 
   but i have no sympathy for the likes of you , you deserve to live in shit because you are so dumb and agressive towards those who just point out how shitty your country is . 
  lol . 
  it seems you are in permanent butthurt about russia . 
  you need to apply the cream on damaged area . 
  it 's pure propaganda used to demonize putin and russia in general ( it makes the second chechen war illegitimate and russian terrorist attacks are not real terrorist attacks -- russia bombs itself ) . 
  that guy probably believes to his theory , just like truthers believe in 9/11 inside job , but the cranks should not be anywhere near to mainstream media . 
   we just do n't learn it , so i 'm not sure it 's really `` propaganda , '' as much as it is a quirky bit of information from our perspective . 
  that 's even better for propaganda purposes , so you do n't know the whole context and can be more easily manipulated . 
  if quality tv would tell me that boko haram is nigerian inside job -- i would not have enough information to immediately rule out it as a conspiracy theory . 
  who knows ? 
  maybe . 
  but if you are better aware about the whole deal , it looks silly . 
  inosmi ( russian state-owned media , the same agency as sputnik ) faithfully translate evil putin-style articles in western press -- just because they know they will look ridiculous for russian readers , and they will reaction `` look , western media is not credible '' instead of `` look , putin is evil '' . 
   if this were really propaganda , do n't you think it 'd be more wide spread i see these accusation get repeated regularly . 
  check wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/explanation_attempts_for_the_russian_apartment_bombings, 
  how does the targeted killing of ex-fsb traitor proves your silly conspiracy theory ? 
  you failed to demonstrate any connection . 
  it 's just a silly non sequitur typical for cranks , because they do n't have arguments any better . 
  lee harvey oswald was killed ? 
  there was the third bullet then !, 
   we 're talking about the same state that murdered a dissident former fsb agent , who supports this claim of fsb involvement in the apartment so ? 
  litvinenko was a crook of berezovsky , sheltered by the uk . 
  try to read biography of that guy , i do n't give a single about fuck him . 
  he was killed 8 years after the supposed `` inside job '' . 
  i do n't know how does it prove that 1999 bombings were an inside job , but if cranks would have a bit of sense they would not be conspiracy theorists after all . 
   but yes , i suggest people read your link to wikipedia . 
  try to read it yourself . 
   he is perhaps best known for positing conspiracy theories that the russian intelligence services were actually behind the 1999 russian apartment bombings and is particularly critical of the rise of vladimir putin to the russian presidency . 
   that 's your problem you could n't built democracy like almost everyone else around you . 
  in countries like belarus , moldova , ukraine , kazakhstan , tajikistan , uzbekistan , turkemenistan or azerbaijan ? 
  thanks , but _ we _ do n't have a problem . 
  _ we _ are doing fine since advisors of our western friends were kicked out . 
   your shitty living standard [ hmm ] ( https://www.google.ru/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_pp_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:svk:hun:rus:ukr:mda:kgz:pol:est ) . 
   just stay there where you are . 
  have a nice day you too . 
  yes , it 's just conspiratorial bullshit . 
  explosives were not found , fsb would not use hand-written `` license plates '' ( that 's how the car was noticed by locals ) and buy detonators in local shops -- unless , of course , it was just an exercise . 
  your pbs literally brought conspiracy theorist [ david satter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_satter ) with his 1999 apartments bombing was inside job bs . 
  of course , rt is not any better than this crap . 
  they bring `` jet fuel that does n't melt steel beams '' clowns as well . 
   and steer them into the hands of utter bullshit , like fox news , breitbart , drudge report , rt , sputnik , infowars , and what not . 
  lol . 
  my propaganda is better than your propaganda !, 
  well , no shit . 
  crimea is a part of russia , like it or not . 
  there is a very strong consensus in russia about it . 
  lol , even khodorkovsky promised to fight for crimea would it be attacked . 
  even navalny and yabloko at most discuss the possibility of the second referendum . 
  i strongly disliked the reunification ( or annexation - as you like ) at first , but at this point it 's done and it 's over . 
  you are free to whine about it as much as you want , but it 's not going to change . 
   so the krimnash types have free reign in creating reputation for the entire country . 
  i see the opposite here - #crimeaisukraine types . 
  generous democratic europeans who are determined to virtually gift crimea back entirely ignoring the will and best interests of 90 % + of its population . 
  it 's only fair for crimea to be controlled by ukraine !, 
  because ... because something short-circuited in the head of the dearest leader 60 years ago and he decided to gift million-strong population of crimea to ukraine for the reasons only known to himself . 
  the same people would whine about evil commies all the time , but this particular commie decision is holy for them for some reason . 
   ( limiting presidential powers )  limit of 2 presidential terms total not included in his program . 
  https://2018.navalny.com/platform/ even if he talked about it elsewhere , it 's not a key enough point then . 
   promoting of local governance ,  transparency of state spending that 's a \u0441ommonplace . 
  it 's included in the united russia program as well . 
  he does n't bother to explain what exactly he is going to do . 
   easing of small business regulation commonplace . 
  putin and medvedev repeat that mantra regularly -- and they really did a lot in this direction already . 
   other key points of his program yeah , like large one-time tax of the oligarchs , 3 % mortgage loans , boosting pensions and wages , 2x boosting of healthcare spendings , more spending on education , investing more money in road and railroad networks . 
  btw , [ navalny 's program ] ( https://navalny.ru/platform/navalny_program.pdf ) during the moscow mayoral elections was n't any better .
