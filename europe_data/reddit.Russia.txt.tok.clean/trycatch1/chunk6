  i am not convinced about tymchuk arguments , but on 27 may besler already [ staged public mock execution ] ( http://www.ostro.org/general/society/news/445881/ ) of two police officers -- roman babyuk and dmitry krikunov . 
  few days later they were released ( for ransom ) beaten , but alive . 
  they used blank bullets , or according to another version -- other people were executed instead . 
  anyway -- publicly `` executed '' people later were found alive . 
  so it 's not impossible that this one is staged as well . 
  no , there is also [ survey of volgograd residents ] ( http://www.fund-research.ru/news/item/2118 ) . 
  majority is against this idea . 
  not true , see [ my comment ] ( https://pay.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27iv1u/putin_vote_possible_to_get_stalingrad_name_back/ci1ecuj ) . 
  majority of russians was against renaming volgograd to stalingrad as recently as in 2013 . 
  only around ~ 20 % support this idea , ~ 50-60 % were against . 
  i was n't able to find recent survey of volgograd residents , but found [ this one from 2002 ] ( http://www.fund-research.ru/news/item/2118 ) : * 4.6 % -- completely support renaming * 12.7 % -- mostly support * 14.5 % -- not formed opinion yet * 29.0 % -- mostly against * 29.9 % -- totally against so that was roughly the same as in russia as whole ( 17 % supporters vs 59 % ) . 
  of course , after aggressive `` media '' campaign , these numbers can be easily changed , but they shows real support for this idea among russians . 
  i 've just created / r/trueukrainianconflict to solve these problems . 
  no , people really believe that they are neo-nazis , etc. 
  it 's an important part of russian propaganda . 
  at first baltic countries were fascist . 
  then georgia was fascist . 
  now ukraine is fascist . 
  basically almost all ex-ussr countries that do n't particularly like russia happened to be `` fascist '' at some point in their history . 
  it 's a legit leak , gigabytes of released content . 
  also its authenticity was confirmed by some actors of that scheme . 
  it does n't matter who released it . 
  sometimes people 's death is good , when it 's net positive . 
  these people _ daily _ kill , kidnap , torture , rob , intimidate ordinary civilians . 
  or at least enable other guys to do that stuff for them . 
  _ daily _ -- and it 's not exaggeration . 
  [ yesterday in novoajdar ] ( http://www.segodnya.ua/regions/donetsk/v-seti-poyavilos-shokiruyushchee-video-svidetelstv-rasstrela-lyudey-v-novoaydare-21-523765.html ) ( luhansk ) they shot a car with mother and son ( ~ 20 y.o. ), 
  -- the son is dead , mother is in intensive care . 
  yesterday in mariupol [ they kidnapped local politician ] ( http://www.0629.com.ua/news/543332 ) from the fatherland party . 
  today in krasnoarmeysk [ they shot trucks ] ( http://news.liga.net/news/politics/1903026-pod_krasnoarmeyskom_boeviki_rasstrelyali_gruzoviki_myasokombinata.htm ) of a meat-processing plant -- 2 were killed , 2 were wounded . 
  yesterday in fights between ukrainian army and separatists 5 civilians were killed in sloviansk and 2 in donetsk . 
  there are reports that today in horlivka separatists executed two police officers for `` breaking the oath of donetsk people republic '' ( it 's not yet confirmed , there are conflicting reports ) . 
  there are probably much more cases i 'm not aware about . 
  return to normalcy is only possible for donbass after cleaning it up from all these `` dpr '' , `` lpr '' , `` novorossiya '' and other extremist groups . 
  so i consider death of these guys a net positive event . 
  they are allowed to vote , but the process is so convoluted that few will use their right to vote -- you need to register on the mainland and then vote on the mainland . 
  mejlis representative estimated that maybe few hundreds will vote ( while tens of thousands want to participate in elections ) . 
  interesting . 
  i did n't know that duckduckgo has maps at all . 
  it 's better integrated in sputnik though -- it has routes for example and its own tile server . 
   traceroute fellow linux user ? 
  btw they use openstreetmap as their basemap -- i think that 's the first major search engine that uses osm as the main map . 
  of course they forgot to include correct copyright notice according to odbl ( it 's just '' ( c ) sputnik '' ) , but still -- impressive progress of open source geodata . 
  works for me . 
  it seems it does n't work for non-russian ips . 
  nope : http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/yndx/ownership-summary, 
  i think it 's interesting in context of [ this discussion ] ( https://pay.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25rmnk/german_minister_google_breakup_may_be_required/ ) about european search engine . 
  that 's according to this document : http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml, 
  while rt is a garbage obviously , i do n't see anything anti-semitic in this video . 
  i watched that youtube channel before and it was a channel mostly about pro-wikileaks , criticism of existing politicians and political institutions , and other standard leftist stuff like that . 
  7 ukrainians and 1 terrorist were killed . 
  30 + killed is a fantasy of the op . 
  it was mentioned in his own autobiography . 
  it was also confirmed by photo and video evidence ( he sits on lecture of barkashov ) . 
  it 's true that these facts are pretty old ( ~ 10 years ) , and it 's unknown if he still keep connection with people from rnu , barkashov , etc. 
  they think that hitler fought against bolshevistic jews who occupied russia at the time , and the war was started by the jews , usa , uk , and so on . 
  also some of them think that hitler was actually covertly pro-russian -- they search or forge his pro-russian actions and quotes . 
  another argument -- hitler was a german nationalist , so it 's obvious that he cared only about german nation . 
  something like that . 
  i am not an expert in their idiosyncrasies , actually . 
  russians were outraged over gibberish phrase `` lasha tumbai '' that was heard as `` russia , goodbye '' . 
  small correction -- barkashov is not a russian official . 
  he is the leader of neo-nazi party ( _ really _ neo-nazi -- they used stylized swastika , nazi salute , and other nazi symbolics ) russian national unity . 
  pavel gubarev ( recently released `` people 's governor '' of donetsk ) is from the same organization . 
  yes , later some woman said that the beard is the symbol of doom , loneliness , and apocalypse . 
  there were actually some openly and half-openly gay people in the studio yesterday . 
  this hypocrisy is nothing new for russia -- just like all these officials who talk about terrible gayrope , but send their children to study in this very `` gayrope '' . 
  that 's official show after eurovision on rossiya-1 . 
  they always were disrespectful about opponents ( i remember well how they shit talked about lordi , claiming that bilan who got 2nd place is the real winner , etc. 
  ) , just brought all this to some new level . 
  the translated article was deleted ( [ afd discussion ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%92%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%bf%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b8%d1%8f:%d0%9a_%d1%83%d0%b4%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8e/23_%d0%bc%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%82%d0%b0_2010#.d0.a1.d0.be.d0.b2.d0.b5.d1.82.d1.81.d0.ba.d0.b8.d0.b5_.d0.b2.d0.be.d0.b5.d0.bd.d0.bd.d1.8b.d0.b5_.d0.bf.d1.80.d0.b5.d1.81.d1.82.d1.83.d0.bf.d0.bb.d0.b5.d0.bd.d0.b8.d1.8f ) ) , that 's another one with significantly different topic . 
  considering that it was deleted with ignoring correct procedure by sysop with strong pro-soviet views and history of pov-pushing , i think that it 's a clear example of pov-pushing by admins . 
  same story with `` rape during the occupation of germany '' . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2p1lvtts_8 host : we just saw the final of eurovision , we cheered for our girls , for sisters tolmachev , and they performed very well , they are in top 10 , but the result is predictable . 
  not a man , not a woman , with beard , bearded woman won . 
  conchita wurst from austria . 
  many countries gave max points , so i have a question -- europe went complete mad ? 
  zhirinovsky : yes !, 
  there is no end to our indignation . 
  it 's the end of europe . 
  it rotted . 
  [ audience applauds ] they do n't have anymore men and women , they have `` it '' . 
  europe of neuter gender . 
  [ audience applauds ] we had holiday with tears in our eyes [ victory day ] , they have culture with tears in their eyes ... alibasov : that 's the common trend ... zhirinovsky : get off !, 
  sit down !, 
  100 years general brusilov destroyed all austrian divisions , 70 years ago soviet army occupied austria , we stationed there to 1955 , we should not have left austria [ audience laugh ] . 
  there would have be other people there !, 
  [ ... ] danko : if you think that it 's a victory , i 'll say that it 's a worst defeat of the european union . 
  finally we see its real face . 
  host : during the song , someone said from the audience that it 's a funeral of the european union , it 's a requiem on the european union . 
  it 's a requiem on the traditional values in europe . 
  danko : there was no performance , the person just stayed there . 
  and let 's objectively look at the appearance -- good god !, 
  host : well , let 's look objectively !, 
  i think it 's a very precise , very talented representation of the today 's europe !, 
  something like that , not a man , not a woman , completely lonely , flame bursts out of him ... flames ... that 's hellish flame , that 's the flame of apocalypse . 
  journalist of komsomolskaya pravda : that 's personification of the new world , but we do n't want to see this world . 
  [ ... ] zhirinovsky : do you think that donbass can be with this europe ? 
  there will be russian flag over donbass !, 
  [ audience cheers ] russian flag over donbass !,
