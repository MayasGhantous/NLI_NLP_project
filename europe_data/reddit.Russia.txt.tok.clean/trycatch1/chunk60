  that 's pure populism on navalny 's part , just like the rest of his program . 
  how is he going to replace workforce of 10 millions migrant workers in russia ? 
  kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan are parts of the eaeu , migrants from these countries have every right to work in russia , is that genius going to disband the eaeu ? 
  brick _ khruschevkas _ still look fine even if not renovated , panel ones look like something you want to burn with fire immediately . 
  overall i am very satisfied with my district constructed in 1960s . 
  low-rise brick commieblocks , a lot of parks around , including a very large one , two multi-storey parkings , schools and kindergartens everywhere . 
  soviet skills in urban planning is sort of lost art in russia . 
  newly developed from scratch district ( completed in 2016 ) not that far away from me look like that : http://imgur.com/a/fgurr, 
   in later decades , like in your first link that 's [ trellick tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trellick_tower ) in london , it has nothing to do with the soviet union . 
  there are few buildings in that style ( e.g. 
  [ centipede-house in moscow ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/%d0%94%d0%be%d0%bc_%d0%b0%d0%b2%d0%b8%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%be%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b2_%d0%bd%d0%b0_%d0%91%d0%b5%d0%b3%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%be%d0%b9_%d1%83%d0%bb%d0%b8%d1%86%d0%b5_%d0%b0%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%bb%d1%8c_2014_00.jpg ) or ( in ) famous [ house of soviets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_soviets_ ( kaliningrad \\ ) ) in kaliningrad ) , but overall brutalism in the soviet union was n't that widespread . 
  it 's a british style in the first place . 
  according to [ the article in russian wikipedia ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439_\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439_\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044c#.d0.a2.d0.b5.d0.be.d1.80.d0.b5.d1.82.d0.b8.d1.87.d0.b5.d1.81.d0.ba.d0.b8.d0.b9_.d0.b2.d0.b0.d1.80.d0.b8.d0.b0.d0.bd.d1.82_.d0.bc.d0.b5.d1.81.d1.8f.d1.86.d0.b0_.d1.81_.d0.bf.d1.8f.d1.82.d0.b8.d0.b4.d0.bd.d0.b5.d0.b2.d0.bd.d0.be.d0.b9_.d0.bd.d0.b5.d0.b4.d0.b5.d0.bb.d0.b5.d0.b9 ) , there were no february 29 and february 30 in 1930-1931 , it was just a proposal . 
  also , [ soviet calendar of 1930 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/soviet_calendar_1930_color.jpg ) -- it 's an ordinary gregorian calendar , but the days are colored with respect to their position in 5-day week . 
  why would russia get involved in any way ? 
  that 's in china 's backyard . 
  in syria russia waited for 4 years for the mess to fix itself before getting involved -- and we had a military base there . 
  the first putin 's reaction to the starting syrian war was `` we do n't have interests in syria '' . 
   927 personnes \u00b1 2.6 % ( 95 % confidence level ) around 20 % - random confidence interval calculator from the web . 
  so yeah . 
  also , wikipedia has huge https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_french_presidential_election,_2017 that is far more informative than this and includes polling of all likely pairs in the second round ( macron wins in all of them with a significant margin ) . 
  it has zero to do with eurovision . 
  that 's politics , and in politics there are different points of view , more than one . 
  one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter . 
  for ukraine it was an invasion and occupation , for crimeans it was a liberation and deoccupation . 
  there are losers , there are winners . 
  ukraine lost its soviet colony gifted by khruschev , crimea reuinified with russia , achieved the thing it always wanted to achieve . 
  the same thing with kosovo ( albanians and serbs have diametrically different povs ) , iraq ( for the kurds it was a liberation ) and so on . 
  song contest is not a political playground to decide who is right and who is wrong . 
  russia did n't send anybody from 100 + list of banned russian celebrities ( why the hell the host of the esc has lists like that at all ? ) . 
  the song was not political , just ordinary bland stuff bought from the west ( in this case co-authored by germans ) . 
  the contestant was not political , she was not widely known at all . 
  the only thing she did was violating procedure of entering crimea 2 years ago -- and that 's all . 
  it 's a minor administrative offense , not a crime . 
  ukraine just searched for any arbitrary reason to ban russian contestant . 
  ukraine on the other side has history of turning the esc into their political sandbox . 
  for example , in 2005 they sent [ razom nas bahato ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/razom_nas_bahato,_nas_ne_podolaty ) to the esc in kyiv :  the original song was entirely in ukrainian , and was written specifically to refer to the 2004 presidential election , even going so far as to name presidential candidate viktor yushchenko by name . 
  when it was the ukrainian entry at the eurovision song contest 2005 in kiev , [ 1 ] the lyrics were rewritten to include english lyrics , and omitting references to yushchenko . 
  then jamala with her 1944 , and then this shit . 
  i do n't remember a single political song from russia . 
  when russia won eurovision in 2008 , we sent a ukrainian singer with song in both russian and ukrainian languages as [ the russian entry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mamo_ ( song \\ ) ) in moscow 2009 . 
  it happened right after the gas conflict between russia and ukraine , yuschenko was the president , political relations with ukraine were quite bad . 
  but the song contest was out of politics . 
   `` ukrainian law '' argument is a crap because there 're thousands of people who were in crimea and later visited ukraine . 
  this `` ukrainian law '' probably just does n't exist , at least it did n't exist in 2015 when samoilova visited crimea . 
  i honestly tried to find it , but only found [ this ] ( https://i.factor.ua/law-41/section-223/article-1969/ ) in the administrative code ( google translate ) :  article 204-2 . 
  violation of the order of entry to and withdrawal from the temporarily occupied territory of ukraine  violation of the order of entry into the temporarily occupied territory of ukraine and departure from it . 
  entails the imposition of a ** fine from one hundred to three hundred non-taxable minimum incomes of citizens or administrative arrest for a period of up to fifteen days ** . 
  there is no law mandating entry ban . 
  it 's not a crime , just an administrative offense . 
  she should be just fined for 300 minimum ukrainian incomes = 5100 hryvnias = $ 190 . 
  of course , they can arbitrarily deny entry for anybody for any reason , but it has nothing to do with violation of some `` law '' . 
  joke as in `` the world would be better if you would not exist '' ? 
  at least for liberal `` progressives '' from / r/europe . 
  combat hopak is scary . 
  in the soviet union it was dubbed amazingly as well ( sadly not all funes movies were dubbed by kenigson who was by far the best russian funes dubbing actor ) . 
  a few different dubbings of the same scene : [ original ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwsujfwv9o4 ) , [ czech ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8teeteyudpq ) , [ russian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsquhjunyca ) , [ german ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp48lcawepc ) .

  the airfield was taken by groups `` alfa '' and `` omega '' . 
  one of the main objectives of the operation was to save lives of military and separatists . 
  some separatists were captured . 
  it 's a major development of the situation , so it 's better to discuss here , and not in the megathread . 
  according to the official information 3 roadblocks were taken , 5 terrorists were killed , 1 soldier was wounded .

  https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ru&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dif.org.ua%2fua%2fpolls%2f2014_polls%2fobshestvennavjansk.htm in april-july sloviansk was the main stronghold of separatists , it was even called `` second stalingrad '' by pro-separatist resources . 
  sloviansk and kramatorsk were reunited with ukraine on july 5 , when strelkov 's forces successfully broke out of encircled sloviansk . 
  kramatorsk is a slightly larger town located in 10km from sloviansk , ua army entered kramatorsk the next day after sloviansk on july 6 . 
  so it 's interesting to see the opinion of their residents today . 
  the survey was conducted in november 22-27 , 510 persons were polled in sloviansk , 500 in kramatorsk . 
  some highlights : ** who are to blame ** in the whole situation on donbass ( q47 ) : the current government of ukraine ( 72 % ) , yanukovich gov ( 43 % ) , maidan ( 32 % ) , usa ( 32 % ) , russia ( 31 % ) , ukrainian oligarchs ( 25 % ) , ukrainian nationalists ( 12 % ) , eu ( 10 % ) , local donbass elites ( 10 % ) . 
  ** hardships experienced ** during the war 6 % had their relatives or friends killed , 16 % have wounded relatives or friends , 0.6 % were wounded themselves , 5 % in sloviansk had their homes looted , 2 % in sloviansk had their homes completely destroyed ( 20 % in sloviansk -- damaged ) , 13 % lost jobs ( q10 ) . 
  main problems : 70 % in sloviansk -- repair of damaged buildings , 55 % -- relaunch of businesses , creation of new jobs , 37 % -- restoration of damaged infrastructure ( q40 ) . 
  ** role of russia ** 35 % believe that russia supplies arms to lnr and dnr , 24 % believe that russian armed forces are directly involved in the conflict ( q49 ) . 
  35 % consider that there is ongoing war between russia and ukraine , 36 % disagree ( q50 ) . 
  ** eu vs cu ** 23 % support accession to the european union , 30 % prefer accession to the customs union , 27 % want to stay out of both cu and eu . 
  to put this into perspective , in 2012 ukraine as whole slightly prefferred cu over eu ( https://imgur.com/5kndipb ) ** what should be done ** 46 % are ready for any compromises to bring peace to donbass , 26 % are ready for compromises but not any , 14 % think that the conflict can only be resolved in some military way ( q51 ) . 
  ** dnr or ukraine ** 27 % think that donbass should stay in ukraine on the same terms as before , 45 % want more independence from kiev , 7 % want donbass to be an independent state , 5 % -- part of russia ( q55 ) . 
  61 % think that their city should stay in donetsk oblast of ukraine , 8 % want to join dnr , 4 % want to divide donetsk oblast between ukraine and dnr with their city staying in ukraine ( q56 ) . 
  ** self-identification ** 40 % feel themselves in the first place citizens of ukraine , 19 % are in the first place residents of their town , 25 % -- residents of their region , 7 % -- citizens of the ussr , 1 % -- citizens of russia ( q58 ) . 
  64 % speak inside of their family only in russian , 2 % only in ukrainian ( q77 ) . 
  76 % consider themselves ukrainian , 21 % -- russian ( q76 ) . 
  in july 2014 malaysian boeing airliner has crashed in the donetsk oblast . 
  most of experts agree on the hypothesis that the plane was shot down by a missile . 
  who , in your opinion , was behind this attack ? 
  * ukrainian army , ukrainian special forces - 50 % * western special forces - 14 % * terrorists , unrelated to the conflict in the eastern ukraine - 8 % * rebels , self-defense forces of eastern ukrainian people 's republic - 4 % * russian army , russian special forces - 1 % * other - 7 % , no answer - 16 % young people ( 18-24 y.o. 
  ) : 28 % - ukrainian army , 19 % unrelated terrorists , 18 % western special forces , 10 % rebels , 0 % - russian army old people (  60 y.o. 
  ) : 64 % - ukrainian army , 12 % - western special forces , 6 % - terrorists , 1 % rebels , 0 % - russian army https://wciom.ru/index.php?id=236&amp;uid=115900, 
  belarus , probably . 
  otherwise , alexander iii 's maxim `` russia only has two allies : the army and the navy '' is still popular and relevant .
