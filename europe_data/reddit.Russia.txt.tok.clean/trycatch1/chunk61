  it 's big . 
  also , the rap battle between oxxxymiron and johnyboy in 2015 [ got 37m views ] ( https://youtu.be/mvoumfkmaei?t=166 ) on youtube and made rap battles mainstream , so recent rap battles between top rappers are top discussed news in social networks . 
  tarkovsky was a skilled director , no doubt about it . 
  but how can you talk about spirituality all the time -- and do things like burning a cow during filming of `` andrey rublev '' ? 
  i do n't believe him . 
  he is a phony preacher , just as fake as russian patriarch wearing $ 30k-worth watch . 
  if you did n't manage to convince yourself that tarkovsky is a genius , all these unjustified long takes , empty meaningless 5-minute highway scenes or 10-minute panning and zooming slideshow in the ending of andrey rublev look like just what is -- pretentious cheap filler . 
  lem 's `` solaris '' and strugatsky brothers ' `` roadside picnic '' are great on their own , the movies are hardly an improvement . 
  and solaris ( 1972 ) is such a weak response to space odyssey ( 1968 ) in every single aspect that it 's not even funny . 
  it demonstrated the huge gap between just a good director and a genius director . 
  you mean `` come and see '' , about evil sadist germans ? 
  you can expect something more nuanced for a movie from 1980s than film version of [ korean posters about americans ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/wbyqe ) . 
  not very different from one-sided over-the-top western movies about evil sadist russian soldiers . 
  i ca n't stand tarkovsky , so something by sergei eisenstein probably . 
  for example `` alexander nevsky '' with wonderful score by prokofiev . 
  that 's propaganda , but brilliantly done . 
  in 1938 it was n't possible to film anything else , anyway . 
  you step a little bit away from the party 's line -- and you get into trouble . 
  eisenstein 's `` bezhin meadow '' was destroyed and `` ivan the terrible part 2 '' was not released until stalin 's death . 
  later soviet cinema was badly hurt by socialist realism , but there were some good movies that avoided the curse of socialist realism . 
  kozintsev 's hamlet ( 1964 ) is beautiful , some comedies like kin-dza-dza . 
  modern russian movies ... 
  i dunno , `` green elephant '' was funny . 
  yes , i read most of lindgren when i was a kid . 
  karlsson-on-the-roof is by far the most popular lindgren 's book in russia , but pippi , emil , bullerby , mio my mio , ronia the robber 's daughter , etc. 
  are known as well . 
  not exactly a conspiracy theory , but majority of russians believe that ukraine or some third force blew up the plane and then covering it up . 
  according to polls , only few percents believe that the plane was downed by russia or the rebels . 
  katyn was done by the germans , 20-30 % still believe in that . 
  it was the official point of the ussr of 1950s-1980s , but even the ussr recognized in 1990 that it was a crime of stalin 's regime . 
  so this theory implies some conspiracy among top russian officials who forged declassified soviet documents related to katyn . 
  it 's a part of broader stalinist 's denial of any stalin 's misdeed . 
  kal-007 was a spy plane . 
  not exactly a conspiracy theory , but i noticed that the flat earth theory got more popular recently . 
  it 's probably more of a worldwide phenomena though . 
  russia is an american colony . 
  the us controls almost everything in russia -- the government , tv , central bank , legislature . 
  except putin , of course -- he is trying to revolt and liberate russia from our american overlords . 
  instead of improving russia , the central bank invests all the free money in the us -- this is actually russian tribute to its master . 
  this theory is promoted by organization called [ nod ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_liberation_movement_ ( russia \\ ) ) , it 's controlled by mp evgeniy fedorov , a member of united russia . 
  there are some anti-putin conspiracy theories as well , the most known is about ryazan sugar -- belief that putin organized terrorist attacks in 1999 . 
  it 's promoted in the western media as well . 
  a recent update to the theory -- the terrorist attack in st. petersburg 's metro was either staged or organized by fsb . 
   call hdds `` winchester '' same in russia . 
  the most beautiful is st. petersburg or moscow -- i dunno , it 's subjective . 
  smaller towns like novgorod are also nice . 
  the most ugly -- i was n't there , but omsk has really bad reputation , varlamov had a series about : [ terrible omsk ] ( http://varlamov.ru/1634146.html ) , [ roads of omsk ] ( http://varlamov.ru/1635553.html ) , [ backyards of omsk ] ( http://varlamov.ru/1637335.html ) , [ omsk : one big garbage dump ] ( http://varlamov.ru/1636193.html ) . 
  putin did a lot of bad and good things , i consider him neither a saint nor a villain . 
  however i 'm just tired of him . 
  i have been living with putin as either pm or president most of my life . 
  in a few months people who lived whole their lives with putin in charge would be of the full legal age . 
  it 's just time to go , time to move on -- if putin was a progressive force in 1999 , he is not anymore . 
  but most likely putin will stay at least 7 years more , or who knows , maybe up to 2030 , that 's 13 years more . 
  only minority of russians do n't trust kremlin-friendly media . 
  you see a picture based on a skewed sample . 
  in the same way reddit is anti-trump and anti-brexit , reddit turks are anti-erdogan . 
  majority of russians trust tv , trust tv media more than internet media , trust russian media far more than western media ( well , i absolutely do n't trust western media about russia too , there are exception however , but overall - no ) , and think the topic russian media is the most objective about is our foreign policy . 
  some polls ( in russian , but google translate should be near-perfect here ) : * https://wciom.ru/index.php?id=236&amp;uid=115248 * http://www.levada.ru/2016/08/12/14111/ * http://www.levada.ru/2016/11/18/doverie-smi-i-tsenzura/, 
  tv , especially federal tv , is pure kremlin propaganda ( there is liberal tv rain but it 's shitty ) -- in 15 years it was entirely cleansed . 
  in the internet it 's different , there are a lot different media from the whole specter -- from state-owned ria and rt to huffpost-level liberal meduza that loves to write about how bad trump is , fat shaming , anita sarkeesian , feminism and other stupid shit entirely irrelevant for russia . 
  there is some specifics , e.g. 
  most of even liberal media generally avoid to criticize putin directly , and very few media reported about `` he is not dimon to you '' navalny 's film , but overall it 's fine . 
  with aggregators you can create your own world of comfortable media for your taste . 
  f1 , but it 's not hugely popular either . 
  i 've stopped to watch it when drivers like jp montoya , michael schumacher and kubica quit . 
  2-5k rubles ( $ 40-90 ) per hour . 
  not only tatars were deported from crimea . 
  also bulgarians , greeks , armenians , germans and some other minorities . 
  stalin perceived them as hitler 's accomplices . 
  it 's big . 
  sometimes you get the feeling that everyone hates it , but everyone watches it . 
  it 's routinely the top news in russian media , russian officials like mps , senators , putin 's spokesman , etc. 
  often comment on it . 
  to give you the general idea of popularity -- terms [ eurovision , putin , dota , crimea , ukraine in google trends ] ( https://trends.google.ru/trends/explore?geo=ru&amp;q=%d0%b5%d0%b2%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b8%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b5,%d0%bf%d1%83%d1%82%d0%b8%d0%bd,%d0%b4%d0%be%d1%82%d0%b0,%d0%ba%d1%80%d1%8b%d0%bc,%d1%83%d0%ba%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b0 ) . 
   pharaoh there is a magnificent film adaptation by jerzy kawalerowicz , ca n't recommend it enough . 
  yeah . 
  putin & co. felt bad about it and made some apologetic steps toward poland -- duma finally recognized katyn as a stalin 's crime , a major state-owned tv channel broadcasted andrzej wajda 's `` katyn '' and so on . 
  sadly , this trend did n't continue . 
   i like russia though . 
  i like poland too , and sorry for all the shit russia did to poland and poles in 200 years . 
  turkey and poland . 
  we had never-ending conflict streak with them from 16th century to 20th . 
  * [ list of russo-turkish wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_russo-turkish_wars#list_of_conflicts ) * [ list of polish-russian wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93russian_wars ) the relations with them are far from great , but better than used to be of course . 
  there was a silly plane incident with turkey , but since then the relations mostly normalized . 
  turkey is # 1 tourist destination for russians , we are building turkish stream gas pipeline project , russia is building a nuclear power plant in turkey , turkish construction companies are building major projects in russia . 
  football , euro 2000 qualifiers , russia-ukraine 1999 . 
  russia had to win to advance . 
  we were leading 1-0 up to 88th minute . 
  but then a free kick was awarded to ukraine and goalkeeper filimonov made this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfrshtfjtx8 1-1 and russia was eliminated . 
  it did n't help ukraine though , it was eliminated in their next game and failed to qualify as well . 
  still , almost 20 years has passed since then , i do n't even remember who won on euro 2000 , but still remember that catastrophe -- and ukrainian pilgrims still visit the youtube videos of that goal and leave comments like `` glory to ukraine !, 
  fuck the russians ! '', 
  the most recent bitter defeat was virtus.pro vs og in 5th game of the grand final of kiev major the last week . 
  vp had 15k + net worth lead on 40th minute - bam - [ one fight ] ( https://youtu.be/-eyyvkeq5es?t=1998 ) , and in just a few minutes they had to accept their defeat . 
  who knows when a russian team will advance to the grand final on a home major again . 
  maybe it was the only chance . 
  i was a kid back then , so i remember only late gorbachev years . 
  the soviet union was way behind the west in technologies , probably 10 + years behind for most of mass consumption products . 
  quality of sovet-produced was poor pretty often . 
  there was a joke : `` what 's that -- does n't whistle and does n't fit into your ass ?
