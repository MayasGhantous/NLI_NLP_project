  soviet-produced butt-whistle '' . 
  still , the soviet union produced pretty much everything -- from sand to cpus . 
  toilet paper was in short supply , so we had a stack of newspapers in the toilet . 
  it was used at last in , first out principle -- you put new newspapers on the top , pick newspapers from the bottom . 
  it was necessary to dry out newspaper ink . 
  there was a belief that newspaper ink can cause cancer , so my parents told me to select part of paper without pictures . 
  tv had 3 or 4 channels -- and that 's in st. petersburg . 
  programming was shitty . 
  when they 've started to broadcast latin american soap operas ( [ slave isaura ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/escrava_isaura_ ( 1976_telenovela ) , [ the rich also cry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/los_ricos_tambi%c3%a9n_lloran ) ) in 1988-1989 it was a revolution . 
  kids also greatly benefited from the collapse . 
  while soviet cartoons were nice , but they had nothing like duck tales , chip 'n dale rescue rangers , the new adventures of winnie the pooh , gummi bears and so on . 
  with collapse of the soviet union , the quality of tv just skyrocketed . 
  toys were okay . 
  various toy cars , tanks , guns , soldiers . 
  [ 900x microscope analit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdm944r0vss ) with various specimen , `` young chemist '' set , various construction toys ( nowhere as good as lego though ) . 
  there were soviet clones of western toys , like [ elektronika im-02 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3chasa_rbqm ) -- clone of nintendo game & watch . 
  the best my toy was german piko railroad . 
  there was no vhs ( the only soviet vhs recorder [ vm-12 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elektronika_vm-12 ) was shitty , expensive and hard to get ) , instead we 've watched filmstrips narrated by voice on a compact cassette or vinyl . 
  in 1980s personal computing was mostly limited to programmable calculators ( there were games for them published in magazines , you was supposed to type them by hand ) , but since mid-1980 there were 8/16-bit computers rk-86 ( shit-tier ) , bk ( good-tier ) and zx spectrum ( god-tier ) , both diy and factory-produced . 
  my dad built a diy speccy on soviet-produced chips . 
  games were easy to get , you had just copy the tape with two tape recorders or use special software , copy protection was removed by polish crackers ( a lot of games had `` cracked by bill gilbert '' ) . 
  elite , saboteur , jet set willy , robin of the wood , bruce lee , anything you want . 
  there were soviet clones of pc xt , but they were too expensive and outside out of reach of ordinary people , used on enterprises and so on . 
  there was a book craze , quality books were hunted for . 
  it was hard to just _ buy _ a book , you had to _ get _ it . 
  there was a project to exchange paper waste for high-demand books , the books that you was n't able to buy without recycling enough of kgs of paper waste . 
  samizdat was the thing . 
  i still have `` the master and margarita '' fully retyped by hand ( because there was no ocr ) and printed by my father . 
  yes , it 's legal . 
  also there is some crawling rehabilitation of stalin ongoing in russia ( similar to the one that happened in brezhnev 's era ) , so it 's unlikely that any similar law will be adopted anytime soon . 
  parliament of ingushetia ( a federal subject of russia ) is trying to adopt such law on regional level -- ban on justification of stalin 's actions and on demonstration of the images of stalin in public places . 
  the ingushs were deported in 1944 , 20 % or alike were perished in process , so they are not fans of stalin . 
  the drawt law unanimously passed the first reading , there was negative law review or something like that , but it seems the parliament is determined to adopt the law in the end . 
  beslan hostage crisis , 300 + hostages ( mostly kids ) are dead . 
  there were a lot of terrorist attacks before and after , but this one was the most shocking out of all of them . 
  it was immediately used to strengthen putin 's power and to strip from people their right to elect their governors and mayors ( actually this right was guaranteed by the constitution , but who cares ) . 
  many events . 
  the economic crisis that hit russia significantly , small victorous war in georgia , medvedev-putin switcharoo . 
  medvedev moves to more liberal policies , talks about modernisation and nanotechnologies instead of enemies , the relations with the west are warming up , the reset with obama . 
  bolotnaya 's protests in response to the rigged parliamentary elections , people get weary about putin . 
  putin is the president again , medvedev 's thaw is over . 
  conservative turn in domestic policy - protesters and opposition get prison sentences , pussy riot kangaroo trial , law to protect religious feelings , law against gay propaganda , [ dima yakovlev law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dima_yakovlev_law ) , introduction of the [ internet filtering law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_internet_restriction_bill ) . 
  full-on reaction , i 've avoided to read russian news back then , because they were nothing but saddening . 
  relations with the west started to deteriorate again . 
  russia agrees on compromise on libya , abstains on libyan unsc resolution , but the west fucks us over anyway and gaddafi gets sodomized with a bayonet . 
  sergey magnitsky sanctions introduced by the us . 
  the most important year in the whole post-2000 russian history . 
  maidan in ukraine , reunification with crimea , war in donbass , the sanctions and counter-sanctions . 
  crimea unites the whole nation , putin 's approval rating breaks the ceiling amid a patriotic craze - putin made russia great again . 
  popularity of russian ethnic nationalism vanishes - we have external enemies instead of immigrants now . 
  yes , it became popular in 1990s after the fomenko 's works , but they were inspired by morozov . 
  in the soviet union morozov was widely known as a revolutionary , i even read his memoirs , but his historical `` works '' in which he identified jesus as basil of caesarea were rather obscure . 
  russian government proudly brags that russia is the world 's leader in reducing ghg emissions , russia halved its emissions since 1990 . 
  it happened due to the `` structural shifts in russian economy '' as they diplomatically call it , aka collapse of the soviet industry . 
  other than `` structural shifts in economy '' russia is not doing much to be greener . 
  one of the exceptions is the recent program of subsidizing solar and wind power plants . 
  so far only 0.04 % of russian energy is produced by wind/solar , but it should start changing , 1.1 gw of solar plants alone will be installed in just 3 years . 
  sort of . 
  for example , illarionov ( he is usually cited by the western press , because he is an ex-advisor of putin and criticizes putin all the time ) is a prominent climate change denialist . 
  putin said something along these lines . 
  most of russia is too cold . 
  i am not convinced that global warming is bad for us . 
  well , historical fakes really do exist . 
  for example , [ historia augusta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/augustan_history ) described biographies of fake roman emperors . 
  and historical [ literary forgeries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/literary_forgery ) exist as well . 
  so you just need to add 2 and 2 and arrive at a logical conclusion ... that all history is a hoax . 
  the first new chronologist in russia morozov spent 30 years in tsarist prisons ( as a revolutionary he was involved in alexander ii assassination plots and barely escaped execution ) and had a bit too much of free time . 
  * [ dulles 's plan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dulles%27_plan ) . 
  evil yankees secretly destroy russia from inside corrupting russian morals and culture , supporting drug use and alcoholism . 
  if you see a drunk russian somewhere , you know who is to blame . 
  random translation of the `` plan '' from the web :  war will end , there will be peace again ... and we will use everything what we have : all our gold , all our material might , to fool and to trick people !, 
   human 's brain , people 's mentality can be changed . 
  by rooting chaos there ... we will subvert their values with false ones and make them believe in those values . 
  how ? 
  we shall find our supporters , our allies in russia herself . 
   episode after episode , a greatest ... tragedy will be performed : death of the most disobedient nation on the earth , total and complete fading of their self-consciousness . 
  for example , we will eject socialist nature from their art and literature , step by step ...  we will support and raise ... artists who will carry out propaganda of ... sex , violence , sadism , treachery ...  we will subtly but actively support corruption among bureaucracy , alcoholism and doing drugs ... treachery , nationalism and national intolerance - intolerance and hatred towards russian people before others ...  only rare people ... will surmise or even understand what is happening . 
  but we will ... make others laugh upon those people , we will find a way to compromise and isolate them ...  thus , we will influence generation after generation . 
  we will ... make our stakes on the youth , we will turn them into cynics ... and cosmopolites . 
  * [ new chronology ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_chronology_ ( fomenko \\ ) ) . 
  reliable history started since 18th century . 
  most of the history before never happened , it was invented by historian conspiracy in 16th-18th centuries . 
  ancient roman and greek statues are fakes crafted in the renaissance , alexander the great = charles the great = joshua = skanderbeg lived in 15th century , jesus christ = byzantine emperor andronikos i komnenos = andrey bogolyubsky lived in 11th century , and so on . 
  new chronology was huge in russia of 1990s-2000s . 
  agnetha faltskog had many lovely solo songs in swedish outside of abba : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1a_wdmqcl8, 
  metro in st. petersburg is woefully inadequate , just 67 stations in 5-million city , huge districts have no metro at all . 
  thanks to wc2018 , ~ $ 1.5 billion from city budget was wasted into [ the useless stadium ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krestovsky_stadium ) , one of the most expensive stadiums in the world , so all other projects suffered from that . 
  the metro grows at a snail 's pace , it 's enough to say that moscow will build in 2017 alone more new metro stations than st. petersburg built since the collapse of the soviet union . 
  i have a tv . 
  kids need cartoons , it 's just more convenient than tablets or pc for family entertainment . 
  especially when connected to htpc with steam , kodi , etc. 
  ( or a console ) also , as much as i disgusted by quality of russian broadcast zombo-tv , there is still some good content like the voice or sport events . 
  19th century . 
  there was some explosive growth in russia in all areas . 
  belinsky famously said 1830s - `` we have no literature '' , so it 's to be created from scratch on an empty field . 
  because , really , writers of 18th century like sumarokov , trediakovsky , fonvizin , lomonosov , derzhavin and kantemir do n't really count -- i doubt many people read them willingly nowadays . 
  most russians would be hard pressed to recite _ anything _ from russian literature of 18th century at all . 
  and in just a few decades we 've got gogol , pushkin , dostoevsky , turgenev , lermontov , nekrasov , tolstoy and many others -- some of the best russian writers ever . 
  it was like the cambrian explosion . 
  everyone wrote poems , from soldiers to diplomats .
