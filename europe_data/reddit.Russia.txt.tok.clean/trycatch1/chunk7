  ----- and so on for like 1 hour . 
  to be fair , some people were respectful to the winner , notably kirkorov and verka serduchka . 
  so much butthurt on russian tv . 
  edit : video -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2p1lvtts_8, 
  ah , `` soviet war crimes '' wikipedia article . 
  i remember the fight in russian wikipedia over it -- someone translated the article from english wikipedia to russian , and local pro-soviets fought tooth and nail against it . 
  in the end the article was deleted , and the article written over it reads like some sort of soviet-era propaganda piece that spends more time on dismissing claims about soviet war crimes than describing them . 
  i do n't watch russian tv , and i was n't able to find anything about this documentary in google . 
  idea that `` poland is guilty in ww2 '' exists , but it does n't seem like it 's part of the official propaganda . 
  article from 2009 . 
  self-defense forces in the larval stage . 
  people were shot on the streets , not in the trade union building . 
  it 's a joined list of all people who died on 2 may . 
  what the hell you are talking about ? 
  3 dead from military . 
  head of traffic police of mariupol was killed . 
  also today ukrainian priest was killed by separatists in konstantinovka . 
  in luhansk family did n't stop at a roadblock and was shot ( wife and husband are dead , survived 10 y.o. 
  daughter is in a hospital ) . 
  a 12 y.o. 
  kid was shot in chest in sloviansk ( he is alive ) -- sure , `` right sector '' was guilty . 
  shooting continues right now in several cities . 
  congrats to putin -- it took just 1 month to descend european country peaceful for the last 70 years into somalia . 
  read halder 's war diary for example . 
  8 july 1941 :  it is the fuehrer 's firm ' decision to level moscow and leningrad , and make them uninhabitable , so as to relieve us of the necessity of having to feed the populations through the winter . 
  the cities will be razed by air force . 
  tanks must not be used for the purpose . 
  `` a national catastrophe which will deprive not only bolshevism , but also muscovite nationalism of their centers . '', 
  see other documents there : https://labas.livejournal.com/1054907.html ( russian translation ) . 
  hitler planned to raze st. petersburg to the ground with its entire population . 
  so it would not be better , at least not for me . 
  i mean they did n't block / r/trees yet ( because it 's in english and nobody cares about it in russia ) , but there are plenty of other filtered sites about recreational drugs , including wikipedia pages about drugs , site about virtual drugs in eve online , and so on . 
  that 's probably mostly against influential political bloggers like navalny . 
  reddit already can be blocked using existing laws , e.g. 
  against propaganda of drugs ( / r/trees ) or whatever else insane internet filtering laws adopted in the last 2 years . 
  actual text of the law : http://www.rg.ru/2014/05/07/informtech-dok.html it covers everything , any site . 
  https://vk.com/ap_barkashov funny that he just added a new post :  judeo-khokhol sbu published the recording of conversation of the leader of people 's donetsk militia and barkashov . 
  cool . 
  but the case is that i am in donetsk . 
  and i can discuss everything with dima personally over a cup of tea . 
  why the hell would i talk over the phone ? 
  so we are waiting for bandera enthusiasts . 
  we will put down as much as we can . 
  he wrote about this very conversation in this very vk just a few days ago . 
  caps lock is a useful button after all . 
  that 's just their command hierarchy . 
  it just shows that low-level nazis who participate in the intervention are commanded by their senior nazis . 
  that 's hardly unexpected . 
  it would be very strange if they would be under direct command of russian officials . 
   it sounds fake as shit . 
  amazing argument . 
  `` x sounds fake as shit . 
  i am not y. '', 
  apparently no other rationale is necessary . 
  well , let 's go to barkashov vk . 
  the phone call was intercepted on 5 may . 
  on 5 may he wrote the following ( google translate ) :  attention to everyone !, 
  just got a phone call from our brothers and comrades from donetsk . 
  donetsk surrounded . 
  kiev junta to focus more military forces to assault donetsk . 
  over 300 armored vehicles . 
  artillery including reactive . 
  [ and so on ] 300 vehicles -- exactly what they talked about in the intercepted call . 
  i see nothing wrong with that . 
  eurovision is usually politicized in russia . 
  and currently it 's far more important to demonstrate support to ukraine from europe , than some possibly hurt feelings of some girls . 
  some comments on youtube are awesome :  hello to our german brothers , who support our fight against judeo-masonic nazi junta on the territory of novorossiya and malorossiya !, 
  together we will win !, 
  the topic [ was previously discussed on / r/europe ] ( https://pay.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22rpxl/have_you_noticed_prorussian_astroturfing_in/ ) , but it was mostly dismissed as conspiracy theory lacking evidence . 
  they did n't just took over ukrainian institutions , they killed people -- that 's why ukrainians were so angry . 
  yesterday 200-300 of them attacked peaceful rally of ultras of metallist ( kharkov ) , chernomorets ( odessa ) and euromaidan activists . 
  ( note that it 's not normal -- for example , nobody attacked pro-russian rallies in odessa on 1 may . ), 
  pro-russians were armed with bates , chains , military helmets , ( presumably ) airguns and _ firearms _ . 
  ** 5 ukrainians were shot dead . 
  ** police sided with pro-russians , doing nothing to disarm them : https://imgur.com/a/q5aaw ( notice the same red armbands ) . 
  ukrainians greatly outnumbered pro-russians , they started to make molotovs and dismantle the road for stones , stormed their barricades and pushed them back . 
  then ukrainians went to the pro-russian camp on kulikovo , but the tents were empty -- pro-russians already left them trying to hide in the seized trade-union building . 
  pro-ukrainians attacked the building , pro-russians were shooting in attackers , it seems that ukrainian side also had firearms ( or airguns ? ), 
  at this point . 
  both sides threw molotovs . 
  the building was set on fire . 
  when pro-ukrainians realised the danger for separatists , they tried to save them [ throwing ropes ] ( https://imgur.com/sjkdw25 ) , [ moving constructions from the scene to the building ] ( https://imgur.com/pgaonux ) , etc. 
  attack on peaceful rally was a well-planned provocation by pro-russians , it was n't some spontaneous clash . 
  edit : a good photo report : https://napaki.livejournal.com/100072.html note interesting [ behaviour of the police ] ( https://imgur.com/p1cghqt ) ( yes , there is police under the shields ) . 
  it 's even more interesting that tymoshenko praised the work of police in odessa on may 2 , and police colonel dmitry fuchedzhy , who was seen among pro-russians , got a raise . 
   you should and it 's a pity you do n't . 
  nah , i should n't . 
  that said , telling to internet strangers what they should and should n't do is a great hobby of course . 
   look , people who come to kill are usually well-armed and 30-odd men with automatic weapons would be perfectly able to defend themselves from the mob . 
  i see . 
  5 + shot to death ukrainians , handguns , shells and bullets from ak is an optical illusion . 
  these ones who went to odessa to kill , but died themselves instead ? 
  somehow i feel very little sorry for them . 
  [ 7 dead ( 4 confirmed ) ] ( http://hromadske.tv/society/v-odesi-----sutichki-lunayut-vibukhi/ ) . 
  colorados used firearms -- at least 3 dead from firearms , a lot of wounded . 
  there are rumours about much larger death toll . 
  that 's just terrible . 
  pro-russians were moved in from other places -- minivan had donetsk numbers , one identified person with a gun was a guard from zaporizhia , etc. 
  witnesses say that colorados were supported by police . 
  https://imgur.com/a/kc9fx moreover , colonel of police led the mob of colorados armed with bates , chains , helmets himself ( source -- witnesses from odessa forum ) .
