  nevertheless , it was amazing how unarmed citizens organized against armed thugs . 
  odessa demonstrated today that it 's truly a hero city . 
  over 4 million blacks lived in the united states in 1860 . 
   senator has offered to create database of child porn - to fight it more effectively ( meaning it will be ok to watch child porn for government officials on this website / database ) ; of course mizulina is crazy , and fuck her , but it 's not that insane . 
  usa already [ has this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_child_victim_identification_program ) . 
  also , you do n't need to keep child porn itself in this db , signatures ( feature vectors , etc. ), 
  will be enough for matching . 
  just like you do n't need to keep viruses themselves in the antivirus db . 
  itar-tass , garbage source . 
  see the [ explanations of ukrainian officials ] ( http://www.unn.com.ua/uk/exclusive/1335745-voda-cherez-krimskiy-kanal-ne-postupaye-cherez-neprofesiynist-krimskikh-spetsialistiv-yu-odarchenko ) .

  update : [ vitaly kovalchuk 's brother confirms ] ( http://vesti.ua/donbass/49150-brat-obvinjaemogo-v-perestrelke-v-slavjanske-ne-ponimaju-chego-pravyj-sektor-otkrewivaetsja ) that he is from the right sector . 
  he is still [ alive according to simon ostrovsky ] ( https://news.vice.com/articles/i-had-it-pretty-easy-because-i-was-let-go-simon-ostrovsky-on-his-detention-in-sloviansk ) . 
  simon shed some light on him :  vitaly kovalchuk , a former member of the euromaidan self-defense corps , who by his own admission came to sloviansk with a group of right sector radicals who tried and failed to capture guns from pro-russia militants . 
  19 y.o. 
  yury popravka seems to be in the same group as vitaly . 
  [ he was brutally murdered ] ( http://vesti.ua/kiev/48945-ewe-odnim-pogibshim-pod-slavjanskom-okazalsja-student-kpi ) and dumped with rybak . 
  whereabouts of mikhail stanislavenko ( 31 y.o. 
  ) , the driver of mitsubishi l200 , [ are unknown , supposedly he is dead ] ( http://vesti.ua/donbass/48770-pri-perestrelke-pod-slavjanskom-vzjat-v-plen-trener-iz-kievskogo-fitnes-kluba ) . 
  he was apolitical , did n't participate on maidan , but was in need for money for his family . 
  14 april he said to his family that he found a work -- some unknowns asked him to work on them as driver . 
  according to his son , these people filmed some movie in pirogovo . 
  then mikhail said that filming under kyiv is over , but he will continue to work with the team driving across the ukraine . 
  mitsubishi pajero was sold on saturday , day before the attack . 
  its owner [ ca n't say anything about the buyers ] ( https://twitter.com/simonostrovsky/status/458169142852722688 ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the moment when you started to murder local politicians , abduct civilians and take journalists as hostages for use as bargaining chips -- you have evolved from insurgent to a terrorist . 
  read [ the yesterday 's interview ] ( https://pay.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/23shb2/interview_with_selfproclaimed_mayor_of_slavyansk/ ) of sloviansk `` people 's mayor '' to understand what kind of person he is . 
  some selected fragments :   a. 
  we will take steps so that the elections wo n't take place in the south-east . 
  steps to what level ? 
  we will capture someone and hang him by the testicles . 
  we 're serious , do you get it ? 
  [ . . ] in slavyansk we have unanimously put our hands together and stated - all who are with us will do well , and all who are against us - well , you can guess yourselves . 
  what does it mean ? 
  there will be an ` elimination ' . 
  --   q. russian journalists have a tough time getting into ukraine . 
  are you planning a symmetric response . 
  yes , well , the american is sitting with us now . 
  we need prisoners . 
  we need spare change , get it ? 
  many of our comrades have been captured , they are being taken to kiev and tortured . 
  therefore , we do the same . 
  that is , capturing people . 
  better for readers of / r/europe , of course . 
  megathread was created to solve the situation when half of the / r/europe front page was filled with ukrainian-related topics -- often minor , redundant and low quality ( from sources like dailybest and so on ) , not to bar from / r/europe the most important events currently happening in europe . 
  not much . 
  all dead were identified , all were locals , no surprises . 
  simon ostrovsky [ called to the owner of pajero ] ( https://twitter.com/simonostrovsky/status/458169142852722688 ) , turns out he sold it on saturday . 
  probable social network profile of the captured guy was found ( under pseudonym ) , he shared some right sector videos and was subscribed to rs group ( well , like 400000 + more persons ) , and his brother is a known activist from unso . 
  also this twitter has updates : https://twitter.com/grahamwp_uk, 
  so what we have in sloviansk since 12 april : * 7-8 dead ( 1 officer of alfa , 1-2 shot in a car , 3 locals self-defense on 20 april , 2 bodies of murdered found in the river , including deputy from fatherland party ) * quite a bit of abducted people with unknown whereabouts * anti-semitic tv channel with lectures of a crazy conspiracy theorists petrov and neopagan stuff * ` people 's mayor ' with [ interesting views ] ( https://pay.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/23ktda/donetsk_militia_leader_calls_western_ukrainians/cgxzcc5 ) * pogroms of gypsies * there are a bit , hmm ... infantile people with aks , because arms were distributed among ordinary people -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvb7pw96lq0 * base of professional , heavily armed `` green men '' with anti-tank rpg-26 and stuff all this looks pretty bad . 
  vladimir rybak , kidnapped on 17 april in gorlovka deputy from the `` fatherland '' party , likely [ was found murdered in sloviansk ] ( http://novosti.dn.ua/details/223368/ ) . 
  he was killed on 19 april . 
  all 3 killed in sloviansk were identified , according to the sloviansk city forum . 
  that 's 20 y.o. 
  guy from the description of separatist from [ the video of the local channel [ 1 ] ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afjkcoacgls ) . 
  school-bus driver . 
  he was multiple times mentioned in [ 1 ] . 
  * pavel pavelko ( 1972-2014 ) . 
  flame-cutting torch operator . 
  had two kids . 
  member of anti-maidan . 
  wrote pretty aggressive stuff in social networks . 
  so , according to the [ 1 ] , it was pavel pavelko who had ak .

  i 've collected a bit of facts and rumors about yesterday attack in sloviansk . 
  fight . 
  started in 2:00 20 april . 
  attackers had 4 cars . 
  separatist from [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afjkcoacgls ) by local tv channel [ 1 ] claims that defenders had 2 assault rifles ( i.e. 
  after 1 hour attackers retreated , taking wounded and possibly dead with them . 
  dead . 
  only confirmed dead bodies are bodies of defenders , 2 dead bodies of attackers were not confirmed . 
  separatist from video [ 1 ] says that from their side guy with ak was killed , father of his friend , and some 20 y.o. 
  old guy . 
  woman from video [ 1 ] says that she personally saw two dead bodies -- sergey and pasha ( pavel ) , one more was wounded and died on the road to hospital , he was n't identified because his face was disfigured . 
  interior ministry of ukraine [ reported ] ( http://lifenews.ru/news/131635 ) that two were identified -- locals with birth dates 1957 and 1972 , one still is not identified . 
  journalist roman butko [ claims ] ( https://twitter.com/christian_bss/status/457961695885811713/photo/1 ) that one of the dead was pavel pavelko , 41 year old anti-maidan activist from sloviansk according to his page in social networks ( probably the one who was born in 1972 ) . 
  [ lifenews showed ] ( http://lifenews.ru/news/131635 ) quite a bit of various loot dropped from the attackers . 
  printed google maps in satellite view . 
  yarosh calling card . 
  right sector badge . 
  ~ $ 2k dollars in $ 100 bills , half in newish 2013 year bills . 
  mg-42 yugoslavian modification ( m-53 ) . 
  some documents of legal car owners . 
  some haphazard medkit . 
  yarosh calling card . 
  according to [ this report ] ( http://vesti.ua/donbass/48578-vizitka-jarosha-prinadlezhit-pomowniku-lidera-pravogo-sektora ) , it 's non-personal calling card of right sector that can be freely taken in their office . 
  it 's not phone number of yarosh , only number of one of his helpers . 
  [ personal right sector badge ] ( https://imgur.com/a/nu3bg ) . 
  right sector [ denied that they had personal numbered badges ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/04/20/world/europe/ukraine-shooting/index.html ) -- `` we only have id cards with letters , where we mention the department where the person works '' . 
  i googled and was not able to find a single mention of these right sector badges before 20 april -- for example , it was not mentioned that killed muzychko had any badge . 
  some pointed that using birds in symbolics that way is not typical both for the right sector and ukrainian nationalists in general .
