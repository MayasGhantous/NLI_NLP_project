  russian channels ( e.g. 
  [ ntv ] ( http://t.co/0cyrqkxz4o ) ) claim that the badge was taken from dead attacker -- clearly it contradicts to the fact that no dead bodies of attackers were found . 
  cars . 
  one of the burned car [ was identified ] ( http://inforesist.org/odin-iz-sgorevshix-avto-pod-slavyanskom-byl-vystavlen-na-prodazhu/ ) -- it was on sale since 23 march with the same license plates . 
  telegraph journalists claim that bullets in the car were fired from back . 
  captured guy allegedly from `` right sector '' . 
  in [ the interview to lifenews ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jojzxolkjm ) , he did n't say a single word confirming that he participated in the attack , or that he was from the right sector -- it was all from voice-over . 
  he was identified as trainer from kyiv , from 15th sotnia of maidan self-defense ( it 's not right sector , right sector is 23th sotnia ) . 
  edit : update on yarosh calling card, 
  they do n't want federalized ukraine . 
  federalisation of ukraine is a concept invented in russia , only minority support it even on the east . 
  impossible . 
  afair according to 2013 december polls even tyahnybok ( !!! ), 
  was able to beat yanukovych in the second tour , not to mention more sensible candidates . 
  rule 1 . 
  if you do n't like results of the survey , try to attack organization that conducted it . 
  example 1 . 
  survey done by gallup and rating group ukraine for iri . 
  top comment in / r/ukrainianconflict [ +18 ] :  the organization who conducted this poll is also accused of orcastrating/financing coups in other nations iri second highest comment [ +12 ] :  another report by a reagan-era think tank . 
  why is this organization is allowed to be involved in the affairs of a sovereign nation is beyond me . 
  example 2 . 
  survey done by donetsk institute of social studies and policy . 
  from top comments in / r/ukrainianconflict [ +15 ] :  here 's some funding notes from their ethics statement  national endowment for democracy [ 1 ] ( opinions of the authors do not necessarily reflect the official position of the fund )  media development fund [ 2 ] ( opinions of the authors do not necessarily reflect the official position of the fund )  international resistance foundation [ 3 ] ( opinions of the authors do not necessarily reflect the official position of the fund ) . 
   in other words , much like radio svoboda all their operating funds comes from the united states ' annual budget , so that being said if we 're not allow to trust rt ( which i never will ) then we 've got to dismiss this as well . 
  unless of course somebody is willing to dig through their archive for a reasonable amount ( more than a handful ) of stories/reports covering acts of corruption by pro-western politicians and oligarchs over the years . 
  ^ \\ ^ funny ^ thing ^ there ^ that ^ they ^ are ^ attacking ^ not ^ even ^ polling ^ agency , ^ but ^ the ^ news ^ site ^ that ^ reported ^ it . 
  example 3 . 
  survey done by kyiv international institute of sociology :  well that explains it . 
  might as well post a poll by kremlin favoring the separatists . 
  btw , if you want to post a poll by kremlin favoring the separatists -- do it . 
  it would be interesting to read it . 
  sadly , they do n't exist . 
  i know that many read only titles , so i 've tried to pack up more information into the title . 
  it seems that for \\ _ some \\ _ people even reading the whole title is too complex , but i ca n't please everyone . 
  sorry , man . 
  i remember two recent relevant surveys : * [ iri all-ukrainian survey 14-26 march ] ( http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/2014%20april%205%20iri%20public%20opinion%20survey%20of%20ukraine%2c%20march%2014-26%2c%202014.pdf ) * [ 26-29 march donetsk survey ] ( https://pay.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22loex/recent_26_29_march_opinion_poll_of_people_of/ ) seems to be about the same , because questions were different , etc. 
  * polling agency name -- [ kyiv international institute of sociology ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kyiv_international_institute_of_sociology ) * method used -- mixed phone ( ~ 45 % ) + face-to-face interviews ( ~ 55 % ) * date of the survey -- 10-15 april 2014 * sample size and composition -- 3232 interviews , 160 locations . 
  large , very interesting survey , 3232 respondents . 
  i recommend to read it completely , using [ google translate for example ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=ru&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fzn.ua%2fukraine%2fmneniya-i-vzglyady-zhiteley-yugo-vostoka-ukrainy-aprel-2014-143598_.html ) . 
  some highlights . 
  11.8 % want federalisation : * 21.6 % in lugansk oblast * 19.1 % in donetsk oblast * 13.4 % in kharkiv oblast * 6.7 % in odessa oblast * 5.9 % in dnipropetrovsk oblast * 5.7 % in zaporizhia oblast * 5.5 % in mykolaiv oblast * 4.7 % in kherson oblast 49.6 % consider yatsenyuk government illegitimate , 33.6 % -- legitimate , in donetsk and lugansk support even lower ( 72.1 % of donetsk consider it illegitimate ) . 
  19.6 % still consider yanykovich legitimate president ( 32.4 % in donetsk ) , 69.8 % consider him illegitimate ( 58.2 % in donetsk ) . 
  36.8 % agree that there is war between ukraine and russia ( 28.2 % in donetsk ) , 48.9 % do n't agree ( 60.6 % in donetsk ) . 
  11.7 % support russian military invasion ( 19.3 % in donetsk ) , 74.3 % do n't support ( 66.3 % in donetsk ) . 
  7 % will welcome russian military in case of invasion ( 12.6 % in donetsk ) , 20.9 % are going to put up military resistance ( 11.9 % in donetsk ) , 2.1 % are going to fight on russian side ( 3.5 % in donetsk ) . 
  in case of referendum choosing between eu and customs union with russia , belarus and kazakhstan -- 24.7 % would vote for entering eu ( 9.4 % in donetsk ) , 46.8 % for customs union ( 72.5 % in donetsk ) . 
  she made u-turn ~ two day after , openly speaking out against `` rebels '' -- and that 's why she was kidnapped by separatists . 
  and while she is a pretty shady person , she did n't start that shit -- the shit started when russian military occupied the town . 
  and good or bad , she is legitimate mayor elected in 2010 by 60 % , in contrast to `` people 's mayor '' vyacheslav ponomarev , nobody heard about before . 
  i read the city forum of sloviansk , and the situation in the town is very bad . 
  criminals attack local businesses , because police went into hiding . 
  road police is not seen for a while as well . 
  journalists are being intimidated , so local press does n't work anymore . 
  city news site http://slavgorod.com.ua/ is no more and returns error 404 . 
  legitimate mayor shtepa was kidnapped . 
  i did n't see confirmation about attacks on romani people yet , but the situation is really bad even without that . 
   you made this part up . 
  no , he did n't . 
  the person from belgo said exactly that . 
   also , this video is edited weird , like to make putin more `` callous '' , laughing in inappropriate places . 
  it 's not from the official broadcast . 
  no , you are lying . 
  this is the full broadcast on the official channel of rt. 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=lz1b8o9p0ts#t=7418 or maybe rt edited video to make putin weird as well ? 
   he presented himself as a an `` auto enthusiast '' . 
  in russian `` auto enthusiast '' just means `` auto owner '' ( owner of a personal car ) and you know that . 
  [ dictionary ] ( http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/efremova/137093 ) :  the one who drives a car , but is not a professional driver , motorist . 
  ~ ~ this term originated from the ussr , when having a personal car was considered hubby . ~ ~ edit : after the second thought , _ \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c _ ca n't be translated as `` auto enthusiast '' at all , _ \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c _ used there as amateur , non-professional , not as `` enthusiast '' . 
  if you are not a professional driver like taxi driver , etc. , you are _ \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c _ . 
  ** tl ; dr. you are full of shit . 
  and of course , it was immediately decided to build the road to belgo . 
  few days ago somebody published similar `` decree '' on the official site of the federation council of russia -- that time it was about deportation of crimean tatars . 
  it indeed was on the official site , so somebody breached the site just to publish this fake decree . 
  that 's certainly not true . 
  even the article you cited does n't confirm that . 
  i read sloviansk city forum , and it does n't look like it 's a civil war , it does n't look like these guys have popular support . 
  while locals mostly have anti-maidan sentiments , they do n't support guys with aks and rpgs either , and some feel pretty strongly against them . 
  for example in twitter one resident of sloviansk wrote : `` now i understand what my grandma felt when germans occupied sloviansk '' and then `` sloviansk got a great vaccine against federalization . 
  people are shocked , ready to starve just to live in the united ukraine '' . 
  yes , i know , sorry for the source . 
  sometimes they report things first , though , or have exclusive materials . 
  edit : it seems you were right , looks like it was just disinformation . 
  reports about killed people were not confirmed by both sides . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  setting may 25 as the date of the new presidential elections was the first thing rada did after the flight of yanukovich . 
  it seems that you do n't need to know much to blame the west in any given situation . 
   for instance : the west could have pushed for parliamentary elections soon after the deposition of yanukovych , but it did n't , possibly because how things were turning out seemed advantageous at that point ; how so ? 
  ratings of the party of regions and communists [ dropped after the flight of yanukovich ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_parliamentary_election,_2017 ) , ratings of batkivshchyna + udar + svoboda + solidarnost -- raised . 
  early parliamentary elections would be beneficial for the new government . 
   but instead european leaders either kept silence or publicly denied that right separatism is not a right . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-determination#self-determination_versus_territorial_integrity  according to the helsinki final act of 1975 , the un , icj and international law experts , there is no contradiction between the principles of self-determination and territorial integrity , with the latter taking precedence . 
  [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ]  which gave putin a golden excuse for the invasion . 
  transcript for those who are interested . 
  person in _ ushanka _ : from where you are , guys ? 
  uniformed guy pushes him back . 
  some non-uniformed person : i am a veteran of afghanistan . 
  gorotdel was taken by afghans and troopers !, 
  afghans and troopers of the city of kramatorsk . 
  guys , we are for donetsk republic !, 
  person in _ ushanka _ : guys , we control the situation !,
