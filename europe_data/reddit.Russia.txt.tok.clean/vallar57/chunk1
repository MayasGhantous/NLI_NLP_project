i recall reading that the poles occupied moscow for a while . 
  [ that did happen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93muscovite_war_%281605%e2%80%9318%29 ) , but it was so long ago nobody cares . 
  absolutely . 
  sea , mountains and historic sites , all really close to each other . 
  they did pay turkey for taking this many refugees in though . 
  are you hyped for the cossacs expansion ? 
  i 'm incredibly so . 
  may be i could finally complete russian world conquest with it . 
  the best tutorial in the world is in hoi3 , as it 's * hitler * that tutors you . 
  i see what you did there ), 
  badboy is from eu3 , and borrowing from jews is ck2 . 
  saudi arabia and their gulf friends ,, 
  yep . 
  i just specifically asked a pilot : planes do not have to be tuned to guard frequency all the time . 
  in fact , they usually do n't . 
  there is a reason why the usual rules of airspace violations include escorting and warning shots . 
  warnings on guard frequence are good for making witnesses though ... 
  i have to stop reading so much detectives . 
   and said anyone who will violate turkish airspace + 5 miles , will be warned and shot down . 
  and they have absolutely no right to do that . 
  edit : i mean , adding 5 miles to their airspace . 
  there were 2 ( two ) violations in early october , and then nothing until today . 
  probably not tuned to the frequency on which the warnings were issued . 
   do not belittle the dice gods . 
  they remember all , and show cruelty beyond what any mortal could imagine . 
  i 'm absolutely sure that the dice god is , actually , tzeentch . 
  you know , in my black crusade game i was a tzeentch psyker , and loudly prayed before every roll . 
  it worked ), 
  i 'm just gon na quote the article . 
   the attitude in russia to stepanova typifies how many in the country view the scandal : they acknowledge there is a problem , but also believe it has been blown out of proportion by russia 's rivals for political reasons . 
  correlation does n't mean implication . 
   hence why atheists are more charitable than `` believers '' and commit less crime than `` believers . '', 
  this is a known fallacy . 
  if you group people by wealth first , you will see trend there ( the richer , the more charitable and less criminal ) , and in each wealth group the difference between `` bellievers '' and atheists will either disappear or tip slightly in favor of `` believers '' . 
  it 's just that `` believers '' are generally poorer . 
   the only period we actually had a good leader was when this country was led by a benevolent dictatorship . 
  terrible idea . 
  first , it would send millions into exile , second , these new countries will have relations so bad there will be wars . 
  akimov denied that he said that , you know . 
  it is rumored in russia that reuters got pranked - like , reuters ask akimov 's office for an interview , is told to wait , then in a few hours they get a call and a voice saying `` hello , i 'm akimov , let 's talk '' . 
  he did n't say `` additional '' though . 
  damn +15 % to development cost . 
  the source is opposition-aligned , and even has government pressure put on it through `` foreign agents '' list . 
  they do their job very well . 
  they stopped minting them in 2012 , but recently ( in 2014 ) minted another batch . 
  looks like the coins are still used xd  also , rur is the old , pre-1998 ruble . 
  the new one is rub did n't know that , thanks ), 
  i can try xd i 'll throw a question in eu4 channel for now . 
  how about stellaris ? 
  would be easier to make an actual tournament xd, 
  there is actually a legal term for that : [ selective enforcement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/selective_enforcement ) . 
  in a lot of cases , the very fact of applying justice selectively is a threat to the system by itself . 
  anyway , we were talking about effectiveness of sanctions on dissuading other countries from similar offences . 
  i think this is a topic that requires a great deal of study , outside of casual conversation on reddit . 
  because i do n't know if sanctions are actually effective in that regard . 
  do you ? 
  and here we return to step 1 . 
  the first part of the punishment 's purpose is countereffective , and the second is undetermined ( i found no studies on the topic ) . 
  any legal system with such underwhelming results , and which is also applied selectively to boot , should be taken down and reformed . 
  i enjoyed this conversation , but it 's high time for me to go to sleep . 
  you would be right if there were some kind of abstract `` they '' that were on equal positions on both topics , and now decided that enough is enough and started the sanctions . 
  that 's not the case ; the very countries that now impose sanctions on russia were perpetrators on the other issue . 
  judjement based on double standarts is n't just . 
  i personally suggest striving to give more power to un , so it can actually play the role of a judge on controversal international issues . 
  i do n't know if that 's feasible though . 
  it 's a good thing you mention * other * , because i can now point to kosovo without being accused of whataboutism . 
  there is not much sense in the punishment if that `` something '' that criminal learns is that * they were right all along * , is n't there ? 
  i understand where you are coming from , but the difference is actually huge . 
  74 % 's position is the position of victims . 
  they think the west attacks them . 
  therefore , they feel right in what they do and who they support . 
  the sanctions ' stated purpose is to make russia and russians reconsider crimea annexation and support for donbass separatists . 
  the sanctions ' result is the exact opposite ( [ 84 % support ] ( http://www.levada.ru/2016/10/27/ukraina/ ) for crimean annexation ) . 
  therefore , sanctions are objectively pointless . 
  see my response to comment above . 
  this line of thought is not based on reality . 
  what it actually does is making people believe they are under attack . 
  [ this poll ] ( http://www.levada.ru/2016/11/08/kritika-i-sanktsii-zapada/ ) form october 2016 , among other things , asked people what they think are reasons for sanctions on russia . 
  74 % answered `` to weaken and humiliate russia '' , while only 5 % said `` to stop the war in eastern ukraine '' . 
   if sanctions are so `` pointless '' , why russians want to drop them ? 
  sanctions are pointless in a sense that they do n't make their stated goal happen . 
  if you look through history , [ only 5 % ] ( https://web.stanford.edu/class/ips216/readings/pape_97%20 ( jstor \\ ) . pdf ) of sanctions introduced actually resolved in completing their purpose . 
  economic sanctions are effective in a sense that they damage economy , making life worse for people . 
  pointlessly . 
  when you were in ukraine , their kopiyka likely costed five times more than russian xd . 
  at least kopeyka coins are always shiny !, 
  upping the game , we use 0,01 rur coin , which is 1/64 euro cent xd, 
  thanks . 
   offered to return the bust of churchill to the uk embassy as soon as he became president . 
  genuine question , why is that insulting ? 
  what 's the context ? 
   every damn one of my eu4 runs imo , they are actually harder to deal with if they do n't unite . 
  instead of one big country with an aggressive foreign policy , you now get two , usually allied with each other . 
  something like `` bro '' or `` bruh '' . 
  some numbers to clear the haze : population census in crimea , 1939 : 558481 russians ( 49,58 % ) , 154123 ukrainians ( 13,68 % ) , 218879 crimean tatars ( 25,34 % ) . 
  so no , the majority was n't created by the deportation . 
  it 's a reference to terry pratchett . 
  eh , unhealthy food is way healthier than no food . 
  in the past year , my bag was checked in metro 4 times , iirc . 
  true numbers are unknown , however , i saw the ~ 2 million figure in various sources unconnected to each other , including ( in english ) [ the independent ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/eid-al-fitr-2015-drone-shows-huge-crowds-celebrating-the-end-of-ramadan-in-moscow-10395950.html ) .
