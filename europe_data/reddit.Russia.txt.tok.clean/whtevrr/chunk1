however , the outflows were matched by illegal transfers of money into russia . 
  almost 2 trillion was funneled into the country between 1994 and 2012 , the report said . 
  it works great in eu because dacia is essentially the cheapest option available there , so the name does n't really matter that much . 
  on the other hand , in russia it 's priced slightly above lada and some chinese brands . 
  and i imagine in this case it would be rather hard to sell a romanian car with an awkward name , that sounds like [ `` dacha '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dacha ) in russian . 
  avtovaz ( lada ) , as well as dacia , is owned by renault-nissan . 
  they also produce your regular [ renault-branded logan ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0fi3nnj.jpg ) and sandero at the same plants here . 
  as far as imported parts go , renault is actually quite efficient . 
  for logan they source [  70 % of the parts domestically ] ( http://www.autostat.ru/application/includes/uploadimg/10054.jpg ) , more than some of the ladas own models . 
  something [ like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mctcyoi.jpg ) , relatively close to the city , 400-500m2 . 
  alternatively , a ~ 100m2 apartment in [ a skyscraper ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mhf1caj.jpg ) . 
  afaik a while ago it was actually quite hard to score heroin or any other decent stuff , at least in my city . 
  which was a problem of its own because people ended up using all kinds of awful shit , like [ krokodil ] ( http://time.com/3398086/the-worlds-deadliest-drug-inside-a-krokodil-cookhouse/ ) for example . 
  now it 's seems to be a bit better with the more widespread usage of darknet . 
  the actual page they were trying to block :  easy and reliable way to grow psilocybe https://www.reddit.com/r/rudrugs/comments/1derq9/, 
  you are now banned from / r/pyongyang, 
  it would probably be the same in any big city ( spb , yekaterinburg , novosibirsk , nizhniy novgorod , etc ) . 
  as long as you walk in a crowded public place you 're not going to get beaten or stabbed . 
  but doing that late at night in a moscow suburb is definitely not recommended . 
  just a simplified smiley ''  ) ) '' =  '' ) ) ) '' i think the reason why it became so widespread is that in cyrillic keyboard layout you have to press shift +6 to type a colon , which is pretty awkward . 
   \u043b\u043e\u043b ) ) ) ) ) those fucking colonless smileys are the cancer of the russian internet . 
  but at least you can easliy judge people 's intelligence by the amount of brackets they use . 
  not even the first time this happened . 
  a few month ago they actually fined a girl for posting some grammar-nazi related pic . 
  best thing is , she was an activist and one of the leaders of a local youth wing of edinaya rossiya ( the ruling party ) . 
  they should probably start with banning porn on vk . 
  i think , after collapse of the ussr , nato should 've been either dissolved ( and possibly replaced by some kind of eu-only alliance ) or reconstructed ( maybe under another name ) to include russia . 
  doing that would 've killed , once and for all , the retarded idea of a ` multipolar world ' , and all of the problems we have now would 've probably be avoided . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvx-prbrtty ), 
  i just love its grumpy looking `` face '' . 
  [ this one ] ( http://bkm.by/pub/products/59/621%20%d0%be%d0%b1%d1%89%d0%b8%d0%b9%20%d0%b2%d0%b8%d0%b4.jpg ) is even better . 
  they have some very questionable data there . 
   median wealth ... 871 usd per adult ... what ? 
  well , they saw how western media/politicians reacted , they saw mccain and nulland in kiev shaking hands with the opposition and that was basically it . 
  also , putin had to blame somebody for the revolution . 
  the obvious choice is us , simply because the eu in the eyes of the general russian public are mostly seen as us puppets . 
  you can go as low as ~ 20 ( in 5 % abv/0 ,5 l equivalent ) with [ this ] ( http://msk.metro-cc.ru/category/produkty/alkogolnaya-produkciya/pivo/ohota-svetloe-krepkoe-1420-ml ) . 
  minimum required price for vodka is 185 rub ( 0,5 bottle ) , but in most stores you wo n't any below 200 . 
  when adjusted for alcohol content that shitty beers seems like a better deal , and you get a free ` dinner ' with all the carbs in it ( which is also a hit and miss situation as it might be more efficient to drink on an empty stomach ) . 
  i like how kommersant were the only ones to actually bother with properly reading the original report . 
  everyone else ( even the most notoriously pro-kremlin media ) just run with the same ( incorrect ) clickbaity title . 
  russian journalism in a nutshell . 
  egg , pickles , bologna sausage ( the cheapest available ) , cheese , ketchup and mayo . 
  not fit for consumption , but i guess it is somewhat uniquely russian . 
  you cross to the other side of the road . 
  because despite some occasional lame rituals , the majority of russians are still only culturally christian/borderline atheist . 
  sure , putin uses the church in his propaganda war , but it is n't getting far enough to actually meddle with people 's lifestyle . 
  russians hate gays because they think it 's `` gross '' or whatever , not because the bible says so . 
  i would imagine the majority have no idea what the bible actually says about gays ( or in general ) , and the church are n't the ones pushing that issue . 
  or maybe because it costs you nothing and actually makes the city better ? 
  corruption or not , most of these were really really ugly , and i 'm glad they 're gone . 
  even if some of the freed space might be used for new developments it will still be worth it . 
  fashion trends were similar to the western ones . 
  for most people it was quite hard to get their hands on fancy things , but you could still see all of that on tv , in movies , etc. 
  as far as music goes , there used to be quite a few [ state approved pop-rock bands ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/%d0%a6%d0%b2%d0%b5%d1%82%d1%8b_%d0%b3%d0%b0%d1%81%d1%82%d1%80%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b8_%d0%bf%d0%be_%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b0%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%bc.jpg ) . 
  it 's the underground ones that were oppressed . 
  however , in the 80 's a lot of them went mainstream . 
  the one in perm , run by ngo on the historical site , was indeed closed . 
  i guess it was mostly part of the campaign against ngos . 
  the one in moscow [ recently got a new building ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/arts_n_ideas/arts_n_ideas/article/new-museum-stakes-claim-to-russias-gulag-legacy/542211.html ) . 
  [ in all sizes . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/64ywtq0.jpg ) and some of these are new ... 
  holy shit , you 've got a surprising amount of old soviet cars on the streets . 
  in just a few minutes i 've found one moskvitch 412 , six ( ! ), 
  vaz-2101s , four vaz-2103 / 2104 , a few nivas and even one zaz-968 . 
  there 's even [ a shot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/piejb7f.jpg ) of two 2101s parked next to each other , one 10 meters away and 2103 in the background . 
  most of them seem to be kept in pretty good condition as well . 
   oil + gas accounts for ~ 70 % of russia 's exports , more than 50 % of budget , well over 30 % of gdp . 
  i think at this point it 's like 50 % of our exports , maybe even less ( there is also some hefty trade surplus though ) . 
  and as far as budget goes , for 2016 they plan to get around 40 % from oil & gas running 3-5 % deficit . 
  apparently they thought paris attacks were over-hyped compared to the plane , with all the french flags and everything . 
  the charlie situation from a week before did n't help either . 
  later things got really ugly when it all turned into a ridiculous and cynical discussions about `` the appropriate amount '' of mourning . 
  rip turkey ? 
  [ russian academia divided over fsb vetting of research papers ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russian-academia-divided-as-media-report-says-research-papers-to-be-vetted-by-fsb/540047.html ) by the moscow times, 
  they also have one with [ a plane ] ( http://carobus.net/catalog/krovat-samolyotik-klassik-goluboj/ ) . 
  mandarins ( or tangerines ? ), 
  also , artem chaika , the oldest son of our infamous prosecutor general yuriy chaika , recently bought * a saltmine * ( 2nd largest in russia ) . 
  so that 's convenient . 
  because they want to appear `` moral '' and the church is one of those institutions that are still somehow viewed in a positive light . 
  at the same time very few people can actually be bothered to be religious . 
  and as such it 's easy to embrace every little thing ( like defending the church against haters ) that requires no action , but allows you to claim moral superiority . 
  well , this particular one was hardly random . 
  the guy has 250k subs on youtube and in that video he was basically `` testing '' the law ( it worked , obviously ) . 
  he 'll probably spend a few month in jail with a fine , gets a bunch of new subs and donations . 
  now the real `` victim '' here is the russian state and it 's reputation ( or what 's left of it ) . 
  or , which is more likely , nothing will happen and it would be just yet another law ignored by everybody , but occasionally used for selective prosecution . 
  they watched too many english hooligan movies and decided to show them how it 's done . 
  it was the anti-protest law in this case . 
  they were holding a big sign ( `` love wins '' in english ) and police officers assumed they were going to protest something rather than just leave it at the memorial . 
  then kazakh government gave up on supporting their currency and switched to a free floating rate ( same as ruble ) . 
  that 's way too expensive , should be around 5 $ in any half-decent retail chain . 
  still overpriced though , and i guess that 's why it seems to be always on sale whenever i see it . 
  get the cheapest available pasta , overcook it to the point where it might as well be porridge , pour some disgustingly sweet ketchup that barely tastes like tomatoes , and serve with bologna-like sausage made of soybeans and toilet paper . 
  modern russian cuisine in a nutshell . 
  more like they were n't extreme enough , so they attracted a wider audience ( when comparted do tvrain , for example ) , but at the same time they were reporting on some real issues which none of the regular media dare to touch . 
  holy shit , and here i thought our $ 50/10 yrs . 
  passports were outrageously expensive . 
  there 's also a possibility the entire thing was made up by the source ( liberal newspaper , novaya gazeta ) that 's have been at various times suspected of colliding with the security apparatus ( aka the fsb and friends ) who happened to hate kadyrov ( for good reasons ) . 
  that 's hardly surprising considering that mcdonald 's joints in russia are disproportionately concentrated in major cities with nearly half of them located in moscow .
