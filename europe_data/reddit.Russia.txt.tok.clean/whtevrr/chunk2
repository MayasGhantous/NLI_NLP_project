  with the amount of dog shit on the streets in spring , i feel like we really need more of that . 
  that 's a pretty old pic . 
  if there 's one thing we can praise putin for it 's that he has enough sense to keep glazyevs `` alternative economy '' camp far away from actual economy . 
  you can get putins team of liberal economists as much shit as you want , but at least they do n't spew populist bullshit while carefully avoiding the core problem ( i.e. 
  putin himself ) . 
   and poof regular , popular , and sound politicians appear . 
  well , is n't that exactly how got putin ? 
  it 's not really that surprising . 
  for decades people have been exposed to various examples of neglected architecture . 
  in that situation to an untrained eye the only `` real architecture '' is something classical-ish with catchy details , while everything else , including the very best modernist buildings , end up looking like yet another `` boring '' commieblock . 
  and the same goes for new developments -- they what something with `` pretty details '' , but do n't really have the money to pay for neither competent architects , nor quality construction . 
  the real question is how did estonia escaped that mentality ? 
  better education ? 
  trying into * nordic * ? 
  til they actually made [ this thing ] ( https://cdn2.pcadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/reviews/3652484/xi_mi_mix_review19.jpg ) . 
  * brb getting my loan *, 
  the first one is just a casual `` we do n't care/have no money '' , but the second one clearly states `` we have no taste '' , which is much worse . 
   the credit suisse research institute has a great reputation and is held in high regard worldwide . 
  if their research is n't considered trustworthy , then pretty much nothing else is . 
  that particular report is still pretty bad . 
  the fact that they put $ 991 ( ! ), 
  as median wealth per adult in russia ( vs $ 608 in india and $ 4885 in china ) and actually called the quality of data `` good '' says enough about their methods . 
  it would still be there , just ... cheaper . 
   there are billions of people who are either opposed to the expansion of marriage laws , against due to faith or simply reserving judgement until more details are discovered over how it comes to be that a person rejects the biological imperative of reproduction . 
  the question is why the fuck do they even care ? 
  even if you live with a typical russian mindset ( like `` being gay is just a lifestyle choice '' ) , unless you actually plan to somehow reduce gay population numbers , there 's not much of a point in opposing marriage or adoption . 
  you 'll just end up with a bunch of unhappy people who have no kids . 
   and the others are banned since the crimean sanctions ? 
  not really . 
  of those relevant they pretty much sanctioned just two people : arkady rotenberg and yury kovalchuk . 
  also , boris rotenberg and gennady timchenko are only sanctioned by the us , as apparently both are citizens of ... finland . 
  everyone else ( including people involved in this investigation ) is free to go anywhere . 
  kind of pissed with this . 
  unless they 're a planning to fuck people over and move them somewhere to the outskirts of the city ( which would be fine by me , as i personally have little sympathy for the people of moscow ) this is going to be a huge fucking waste of federal money . 
  there 's no way the developers can sustain doing all of this on their own in just two years , so expect a few more trillion rubles poured into moscow for no reason whatsoever . 
  that 's actually a stalinist-style 5-story building with most of the decorations removed , not a khrushcheyovka . 
  either way , the vast majority of them are fine and could easily last another 50 ( or more ) years . 
  it 's worth noting that very little of what this article talks about has much to do with actual religion . 
  in fact , if `` enforcing christianity '' is the end goal , they are n't doing a very good job ( to say the least ) . 
  as [ this graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rxc6qf3.png ) ( how important is religion in your life : 6 % very important , 28 % somewhat important , 40 % not very important , 22 % not at all important ) demonstrates , the core of ~ ~ mentally challenged ~ ~ religious nuts actually managed to shrink in the last ~ 12 years , and the rest are just ... there -- living their miserably lives , getting drunk while watching [ this shit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=xwxbbu_mqhy#t=4716 ) on ny 's eve ( when orthodox christians are `` supposed '' to be fasting ) . 
  it 's most likely the case of `` people who do n't like me ( or whom i do n't like ) hate him , so he must be good '' . 
  there 's no such thing as a `` rotting territory '' . 
  you use what you need for agriculture and you move most of the people in ( properly planned ) cities . 
  russia has the exact opposite of this `` problem '' , where it 's actually way too reluctant let go of numerous spread out rural settlements and small towns . 
  as a result we end up with a huge chunk of population living a miserable life and contributing nothing to the economy . 
  that 's like basically victim blaming . 
  you should fight gangs , not street view . 
  they have a few cities on [ yandex.maps ] ( https://yandex.com/maps/?ll=27.195595%2c53.593203&amp;z=7&amp;l=stv%2csta ), 
  those fuckers should probably go out and see whats happening in their own country . 
  my local supermarket has been out of fresh broccoli for a few weeks . 
  that 's not even saying the majority of russians probably ca n't even afford broccoli . 
  they also [ unblocked ] ( https://twitter.com/roscomnadzor/status/828984752476651523 ) youporn today . 
  that system where any random court can just block a website for the entire country is beyond retarded . 
  $ 41/month and around $ 500/year for all city transit . 
  it 's outrageously expensive ( i think even moscow is cheaper ) and unless you do lots of trips with transfers would probably cost you more than just paying $ 0.40 for a single pass . 
  that 's just not true . 
  unless you 're way over 40 or still live with parents chances are you either rent or pay mortgage ( which can be even more expensive ) . 
  what an amazing piece of concentrated elitist bullshit . 
  it 's funny how they try so hard to distance themselves from moscow only to end up looking exactly the same , but worse . 
  go to / r/politics where they 'll tell you that shady rosneft deal was actually a bribe to trump . 
  i do expect to get my money 's worth . 
  i feel like at this point dugin gets more exposure abroad than at home . 
  here he 's just yet another nutjob ( of which we have many ) . 
  reading western press you get the impression of him being like some kind of a mastermind behind a modern russian state . 
  it depends . 
  in a timeline where he never appeared could 've been anything from never ending chechen war and a complete failure to capitalize on ' 00s global economic surge to an actual oil-fueled prosperity . 
  in a timeline where putin just leaves after his second term things probably would n't be that different . 
  definitely not as much crazy geopolitical bullshit , but ultimately still facing much of the same problems : mainly the uncertain prospects of a dutch disease afflicted economy . 
  i 've actually seen a surge in facebook use recently , at least among my somewhat young social circle . 
  but it 's so bad though , even compared to vk . 
  and also tends to be a gigantic time-wasting tool with all the independent comment threads . 
  well , just a few month ago there was that gigantic shitstorm when our local officials ` accidentally ' ( or was it ? ), 
  declared an epidemic . 
  not sure about the rest of russia , but here it was the biggest awareness event since probably ever . 
  except that the majority of russians probably think he 's a `` liberal gay-loving scumbag on state dep.s payroll '' and the muslim issue is one thing they would likely agree on . 
  to be honest i think they 're digging their own grave ( again ) . 
  until recently the church reaped the benefits of its victimized image and did n't have much problem with anyone but very few hardcore atheists . 
  now as they get more aggressive even neutral non-religious people ( i.e. 
  most of the population ) are beginning to see their true nature . 
  well of course , but contrary to that clickbaity title we are n't really there just yet . 
  other than that silly censorship law ( which is bad , but not really comparable to an actual ` firewall ' ) and random people getting jailed for posting a kitten with a swastika ( not a real story ... probably ) internet is still mostly free and barely regulated . 
  at this point they have very limited control over cross-border traffic and probably do n't even know the full extent of the network . 
  some people , like our young and not particularly relevant minister of telecommunication , try really hard to change that , but so far all they 've got is a proposition of a very vague legislation which does n't appear to actually change much . 
  i 'll eat my words when/if he ever gets his way , but so far it just does n't seem very likely . 
  most of the recent controversies were around the surveillance law , or rather technical problems that go with it as i doubt many people here actually care about privacy . 
  holy shit dude , get a life . 
  nowhere i said that the guardian is `` the mouth of its respective government '' or even failed to report on surveillance issues ( even though they seem to be rather chill about it , while in russia the similar law was dragged through mud by pretty much everyone including some of the state-controlled media and big telecom players ) . 
  also , tfw when you actually went to a fucking protest against a law in question , but still get accused of not caring about what 's going on in own country . 
  kind of ironic coming out of uk who themselves passed basically the same surveillance law just a week ago . 
  at least in russia nobody expects it to actually work . 
  they might eat as an exotic luxury , they 'll never buy it in russia . 
  i would not be surprised if most of them never bought a single piece decent cheese when it was still there before the self-sanction clusterfuck . 
  what i 'm saying is that people who smuggle an utterly unremarkable cheese ( similar to what they 're used to ) out of finland are n't doing it because they specifically dislike the taste of russian cheese ( otherwise they would smuggle cheese that 's actually good and/or not available here ) , they just believe in superior quality of finnish products . 
  as i said somewhere else , you 'll often see the same kind of thinking applied to various products from toothpaste to dish soap . 
   do n't they realize the lack of difference in taste immediately ? 
  or is cheese made with milk a bit better ? 
  they might realize it if all they eat is the cheapest cheese-like mess , but something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n2y107q.png ) ( arla actually bought a huge cheese factory in russia to produce it ) , which is easily available in most stores , would be nearly indistinguishable . 
  then again , it 's called confirmation bias for a reason , they do n't need to taste anything to support their beliefs . 
  well , you are n't going to compete on prices with your smuggled cheese . 
  those who smuggle cheap finnish cheese are the same people who ` smuggle ' fairy dish soap ( yes , apparently it 's a thing in st.pete ) .
