   not sure why aged cheese is such an issue to produce aged cheese you need very good quality milk ( which is scarce in russia ) and cheap long term loans ( you money are essentially frozen for many month while cheese ages ) . 
  you can fund a small operation on you own if you can find a competent farmer with a steady supply of good quality milk , but to scale it up significantly you 'll probably need start you own dairy farm , which is just a shit-ton of money by itself . 
  oh , and another problem would be that most russians have no clue what to do with aged cheese anyway . 
  because most people do n't actually care about great cheese , hence why they 're smuggling the shittiest finnish cheese available ( which is really no different from what you get in most stores in russia ) . 
  they were just told by the media that now there 's no good cheese in russia , which is true to some extent , but the vast majority never really bothered with good cheese even when it was abundant . 
  most russians ca n't stand cheese that stinks , that 's too hard or too soft . 
  they just want something tasteless that you can put on top of a ketchup layer of a sandwich melt in a microwave . 
  but the media told them that cheese, 
   if memory serves me well , the first time the concept of mir was introduced to the public , it was supposed to be something like a contingency plan in case the regular payment systems would get forbidden from working here . 
  nah , that was nspk . 
  mir is just a step further in stripping visa/mc of processing fees . 
   i doubt even russians understand what its upsides are as long as competitors are in the game . 
  well , soon many of them wont have much of a choice . 
  in 2018 you 'll need a bank account connected exclusively with a mir card to withdraw any government-issued payments . 
   payment system the us can shut down whenever they want to they ca n't actually do that anymore , not since 2015 when visa and mastercard were forced to process all transaction in russia locally through the nspk ( which is owned by our central bank ) . 
  that 's also how they got around sanctions to work in crimea . 
  on top of that i think in many regions you can get a subsidy to match your income to local living minimum . 
  he could 've wrote the same about men , if only so many of them would n't be drinking themselves to death . 
  apparently , the russians [ are n't scared ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m82vtpl.png ) -- i do n't think my local airport ever had so many flights to a single destination other than moscow , they even got a freaking 747 commissioned . 
  well , there 's a list of banned websites , which every isp in russia is supposed to download and apply to its users . 
  now they expect vpn providers to do that as well , or face being added do the very same list . 
  they are n't actually banning protocols , only the public services that would abstain from censoring their russian users . 
   authoritarian rule what are even talking about ? 
  in the last 25 years they had 2 revolutions and 5 presidents . 
  the democracy they have is flawed in many ways , but it 's nowhere near ` authoritarian ' . 
  oh , they are well informed . 
  it 's just that the usual line of thinking is either `` the other guy would be even worse , look at the 90ss , ... '' or , which is arguably even worse , `` hell , i would do the same in his place '' . 
  russians study english for like 5 years in school and 2 years in the university , yet the vast majority still wo n't be able to form a coherent sentence . 
   is n't like half of the economy still controlled by the state ? 
  probably even more . 
  it 's the same as with russia , really , just a bit more micromanagement by the central government and a bit more useless/retarded shit like the infamous unemployment tax . 
  it 's a very state - * heavy * capitalism , but capitalism nonetheless . 
  besides , there 's really no such thing as a * true * free market economy , certainly not in europe . 
   belarus is de jure a communist state still it 's not and it never was . 
  after the ussr collapsed they went through the transition to a free market economy similar to other post-soviet counties ( although they did n't go too far with the privatization and to this day the state controls key enterprises in most sectors of the economy ) , as well as a democratic political system ( which later turned dictatorship * y * ) . 
  except , you ca n't ` eat ' that increased value . 
  so unless one would plan to sell it ( or rent it out ) and move somewhere cheaper , there 's very little incentive to invest in the looks of the building . 
  not really , just a regular ( well , fairly unique actually ) late-soviet modernism . 
  the bridges [ connect it ] ( http://photos.wikimapia.org/p/00/05/79/27/71_1280.jpg ) to the street on top of a mountain . 
  in that case , in russian media , they would have to paint trump either as the biggest scum on earth or as an actual putin 's puppet . 
  but instead , they showed him as an underdog going against the corrupt system , who then turned mildly anti-russian . 
  i 'd say in public eyes it plays for democracy and could even potentially threaten putin . 
  on top of that , the entire issue of russian interference the us elections somehow managed to escape the russian-speaking world almost entirely , to the point where most people ( opposition or not , unless one would activity follow us-based english sources ) perceive it as some sort of a paranoid joke . 
  it really is quite surreal when first you open politico , where 2/3 of the headlines mention russia , then look at some reasonably-independent russian paper and there 's like no shits given , maybe a tiny line in the corner `` some random shmuck says something about russia , again '' . 
   so we have this good precedent here ; but i ca n't imagine such a precedent being set anywhere in russia . 
  well , we had [ this ] ( https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/a-russian-rich-kids-joyride-to-jail-53132 ) rather famous incident . 
  it 's not clear whether it was a pr stunt , genuine police work , or part of some elite power struggle . 
  regardless , it did leave quite a mark in public eyes . 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fpfph0t7zk ) sums it up perfectly . 
  a lone protester `` arrested '' by `` nkvd '' while getting swarmed by people with cameras in front of an outrageously expensive fashion store . 
   remove currency controls ... introduce e-government the irony here is that those are few things putin 's government actually done ( somewhat ) right . 
  central bank 's decisions to let the rouble into free-fall while refusing to give in to populist pressure ( i.e. 
  print lots of money and introduce proper capital controls ) kept the economy from sinking even deeper . 
  gosuslugi.ru ( although flawed in many ways , especially when it comes to actual processings on local levels ) was a monumental step towards containing bureaucracy . 
  i see you like ratings , un puts russia at [ # 35 ] ( https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/data-center ) in e-government index , ahead of most of eastern europe . 
  the problem is they think no politician ever in any country could be honest . 
  which is dangerous , counterproductive and prevents even those few striving for change from getting anywhere . 
  a small amount of trust is essential in a democracy . 
  politicians lie , politicians fail and steal , but you change them up and hopefully , possibly , the next batch will be slightly better . 
  here , people just gave up for no good reason . 
  life was shit for 10 years after your entire political/economic system collapses -- big fucking deal . 
  to be fair , most of them assume everyone in politics is corrupt by default ( they also probably picture themselves no different in the same circumstances ) . 
  and as such , a strong authoritarian leader likely seen above pity things like corruption . 
   former communist politician by that logic , virtually everyone over 50 is a former communist politician . 
  since 1993 she was a member of several very liberal parties for at least 10 years . 
  it was n't until 2010 when she either gone completely nuts or just decided to cynically speed up her career amid changed political landscape . 
  why is this getting downvoted so heavily ? 
  is my english so bad that 's the actual point gets lost or do people get triggered by certain words/sentence and just outright ignore the rest ? 
  either way , if anyone actually cares , [ this article ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dw.com%2fru%2f%25d0%25ba%25d0%25be%25d0%25bc%25d0%25bc%25d0%25b5%25d0%25bd%25d1%2582%25d0%25b0%25d1%2580%25d0%25b8%25d0%25b9-%25d1%2585%25d0%25be%25d0%25b4%25d0%25be%25d1%2580%25d0%25ba%25d0%25be%25d0%25b2%25d1%2581%25d0%25ba%25d0%25be%25d0%25bc%25d1%2583-%25d0%25bd%25d0%25b5-%25d1%2583%25d0%25b4%25d0%25b0%25d0%25bb%25d0%25be%25d1%2581%25d1%258c-%25d0%25bf%25d0%25be%25d0%25b2%25d1%2582%25d0%25be%25d1%2580%25d0%25b8%25d1%2582%25d1%258c-%25d1%2583%25d1%2581%25d0%25bf%25d0%25b5%25d1%2585-%25d0%25b0%25d0%25ba%25d1%2586%25d0%25b8%25d0%25b8-%25d0%25bd%25d0%25b0%25d0%25b2%25d0%25b0%25d0%25bb%25d1%258c%25d0%25bd%25d0%25be%25d0%25b3%25d0%25be%2fa-38643648%3fmaca%3drus-tco-dw&amp;edit-text= ) ( google-translated ) is a pretty good summary on the matter . 
  yeah , i 'm well aware of that and was just talking about one particular protest in my city ( which is n't moscow/stpt ) . 
  in my city the only person they detained was a guy wearing a pro-putin t-shirt . 
  overall , this was a pretty sad looking event , showing once again just how woefully incompetent khodarkovsky 's organization really is . 
  they actually had a permit but could n't even manage to get a hundred people ( compared to navalny last month with a solid few thousand showing up for an unsanctioned protest ) . 
   the use of russian has retreated fastest in kazakhstan , where in 2016 just 20.7 per cent of people said they typically spoke russian at home , compared with 33.7 per cent in 1994 , according to data from national censuses and the un , collated by euromonitor international , a research group . 
  i 'm fairly certain these are numbers for ethnic russians in kazakhstan , not the language . 
  the wrong kind of protests . 
  trying to fight symptoms instead of the disease using lame populism . 
  where were these people when putin took crimea , passed a bunch unconstitutional laws , destroyed investment climate , made a joke out of judicial system ? 
  they cheered him , and now they reap what they sow . 
   no , we do n't have those , not that i 'm aware . 
  in smaller blocks , owners of the condos often create legal body to menage whole block . 
  in case of my block every condo owner pay something called `` renovation fee '' to that body in order to create downpayment for staircase renovation , thermal-insulation , pipe replacement etc. 
  it 's similiar in other blocks . 
  banks like to give those menaging legal bodies cheap loans becouse they always pay , it 's good bussines . 
  it 's the same thing here , in theory . 
  it kind of works for newly built houses , but old commiblock are populated by a rather diverse crowd . 
  how do you motivate a 75-year old grandma , or a 50-year old alcoholic to pay even as little as 20 euro/month for their commieblock to ` look nice ' ? 
  you also need somebody who 's highly motivated , and actually competent and has enough spare time to set up the entire thing ( unless the city takes care of that part ) and convince his neighbors . 
  well , here 's an example . 
  [ two buildings ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ebako ) next to each other , both renovated by the city . 
  the first one is some kind of municipal dormitory , looks nice and clean , even if somewhat boring . 
  with the second one they could n't touch ( because muh , muh `` private property '' ) neither windows/balconies , nor the first floor storefront madness , and so in the end it still looks like a slum . 
  the vast majority are ruined by the moronic owners randomly installing their stupid ugly-ass white pvc windows/balconies . 
  other then that it depends on the material . 
  the ones made out of brick look [ okay-ish ] ( https://www.google.ru/maps/@55.689172,37.5749642,3a,51.1y,77.27h,98.41t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1siktc-ezgn1lwkkyp1ynfiw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) to this day , painted prefab concrete -- [ not so much ] ( https://www.google.ru/maps/@55.6885524,37.5782139,3a,69.1y,317.19h,89.14t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srbarognauvlyhug7hj33ya!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) ( if anyone wonders , that 's the actual neighborhood from many of these photos ; it was an early experiment in moscow though , so not very representative overall ) . 
  contrary to other people in this thread , i would like to say though that most of them hold up surprisingly well , especially considering nearly nonexistent maintenance . 
  compared to a pre-war historically significant constructivist building where i lived for nearly half of my life , which seemed like it was literally made out of sawdust and was falling apart after barely 60 years , even the oldest commiblocks look like they could easily withstand a few more decades . 
  who would pay for it ? 
  i assume you 've got some kind of eu-funded program which provides loans at ridiculously low interest rate , maybe even co-funded by the state/city . 
  and the lack of cheap , heavily subsidized heating probably helps to motivate the owners to do thermal-insulation .
