  i think , i 've heard about plans to give those cards to pensioneers . 
  state employees , medics , police , clerks , will probably get these too as ` salary ' cards . 
  donato bramante , the man [ who used paint ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/sansatirointeriors.jpg ) , when [ he had no bricks ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/img_5383_-_milano_-_abside_trompe-l'oeil_in_santa_maria_presso_san_satiro_-_foto_giovanni_dall'orto_-_17_febr._2007.jpg ) to continue . 
  you see metal & glass , i see stones of pain creating halls of death where high coven of witches collect flesh and leather of their subjects from defenseless city at the foot of their spire , for their wicked rituals where they summon the prince of demon who already opened one of its eyes in the sky dooming all alive . 
  this red sky beneath black towers of evil in the original photo is more dark fantasy than your walls that look like generic epic fantasy stuff . 
  including special turkish ones ? 
  edit : letters , not terrorist groups . 
  bad ukrainians never put their one . 
  i already celebrate the deaths of hundreds of young men in syria & iraq because of their politics every day . 
  why to start cry about that one ? 
  of course . 
  18-summer ... to those who does n't find there sense : in russian `` years '' turns into `` summers '' when there 's more than four of it . 
  it is four years , but five , six , seven summers . 
  so it means 18-year old . 
  about topic : thank god . 
  only he said it after he was sacked . 
  russia will remember that, 
  wtf ? 
  even in this sub the neighbor link is to the news about the man who said it is fired two days ago . 
  and also dagestanis , nakhs , kalmyks , bashkirs , yacuts , buryats , tuvinians , chukchas , mordvins and udmurts . 
  not including really small ethnicities . 
  i am agree . 
  would n't it be more understandable with ratings from -200 to +200 ? 
  in eu4 culture conversion takes a long time too . 
  i simplified , of course . 
  our former finance minister alexey kudrin is highly despicable by left people for his strict decision to put any ` outcome ' oil money into european and especially us funds he was doing during about 10 years . 
  `` why do we must finance the hostile state when we have not enough money for olds and hospitals ? '', 
  while he did it especially to fix rouble on its 30,00 per dollar rate not letting oil export revenues make all other exports senseless . 
  without him we would probably live 2 times better in 2000s and 4 times worser today . 
  it is when one sector of economics becomes so profitable that it starts to choke all others with sucking investments , slowly destroying them and unifying the economics of whole country in itself , making it vulnerable in the case prices will change and the sector profits will drop . 
  named by an economical crisis the dutch fell into after their tulip market blown up . 
  japanese have a temple that is being rebuilt every 20 years from scratch . 
  it is very ancient by their words . 
  crimes against logic is the worst kind of crime . 
  fly to germany , be cured by incredible german medics , then starve , trying to clear the debt . 
  yesterday . 
  i have bad news * for you * : he is right . 
  russian economics suffers from something that is called `` dutch disease '' . 
  a lot of countries survived this ( among scandinavic countries norway with oil too , for example , so in russia it is also called `` norwegian disease '' ) . 
  what is his guilt ? 
  removing kebab ? 
  you do n't know , there is no sixth book yet . 
  from central asia . 
  we actually did n't . 
  all this time it was only astrologers who did all the inventions and breakthroughs . 
  they were opened with mysticism . 
  they can as well imagine themselves brave warriors saving waterdeep from the giant slime blob in the dungeons . 
  from meat , vegetables like potatoes , carrot etc and red beetroot that gives intense red color to it ( that 's why it is called czerwony ) . 
  well , it 's my guess basing on what russian bortsh is . 
  well , russian neonazis at least are hardly convinced that slavs are true aryans ( germanic and other white people are aryan too , but not very aryan , they have no kolovrat ), 
   thanks to petain france lost its honour it 's not important as honor is something that can be belonged only by men , not countries . 
   de gaulle never set any foot in russia with his armies so i do n't know what you are talking about . 
  * the local * de gaulle . 
   thanks to petain maybe you can say that russia lost many more people , if petain and his allies would have chosen to fight if petain and franco , and any other ruler who saved their nations from the massacre of wwii . 
  300 , well , 400 years ago france discriminated gays because of catholics . 
  now it discriminates catholics because of gays . 
  what a progress !, 
  a finn and two his sons drive through the forest . 
  suddenly an animal runs , crosses the road and hides in the woods . 
  the finns keep silentness . 
  after a hour one of sons opens the mouth : `` it was a fox . '', 
  all is silent again . 
  a hour after another son speaks : `` no , it was a wolf . '', 
  all are quiet again . 
  after a hour the old finn says : `` oh , only do n't start a fight here , you hot-blooded finnish guys ! '', 
  it is all true in the world where there are france of de gaulle and france of petain coexist together . 
  but there is only one france , and this france won the world war ii . 
  it just can not be changed . 
  the only ` guilt ' of petain he did n't spill french blood for interests of britain or the us . 
   de gaulle saved france , the image of france , petain almost destroyed it . 
  if you are a frenchman you are clearly on the wrong side of history with your words . 
  i am a russian . 
  i live in the country where the local de gaulle fought to the last drop of russian blood , the country that dies for seventy years because of this war . 
  one russian catches a car in estonia . 
  he asks the driver : `` is it far to tallinn ? '', 
  `` nooo . 
  the man enters the car , they start to move . 
  after a hour of driving the russian asks : `` what now , is it far to tallinn ? '', 
  the man waits . 
  after a hour he tires and asks again : `` is it far to tallinn ? '', 
  `` yees '' , the driver says . 
  it is not an irony and not something antisemitic . 
  the owner of this hand was emil maurice , one of those a few , as you said , who hid their past , the founder of ss and the guy to whom hitler dictated all the text of his book . 
   maybe you have missed something but thanks to petain france , or vichy france , was an ally of nazi germany !, 
  maybe you miss something but france did win the second world war . 
  with de haulle it would win it too , because , as i wrote before , he was a genius . 
  only in that case every fifth or fourth french would be killed , not a fistful of those unlucky to go to concentration camps . 
  petain is a french eliash and must be treated as well . 
  mein kampf was written by a jew hand . 
  your analogy is incorrect . 
  a black member of kkk can be compared with a slav member of nsdap . 
  well , even it will be not fully true . 
  a jew member of nsdap . 
  and what we 'll see . 
  there was a lot of them . 
  even the best friend of hitler was a jew , if i correctly remember . 
  thank to petain , france won the world war ii without war and with minimal losses . 
  in other words , he did as much as was possible for his country . 
  without petain france , of course , still would win the war with the military genius in the head of its army , who even in the maximally harsh conditions did impossible , and with untied hands would probably lead frenches to berlin . 
  after 5 years of the war that totally destroyed france and pushed it into ruins for decades of years .
