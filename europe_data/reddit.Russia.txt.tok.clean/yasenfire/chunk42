  well , nothing to wonder about . 
  the us maybe is not as ideal as it needs to be , but it 's trustworthy too . 
  did n't he whine about the rest of the country stealing our money ? 
  technology 's ( science 's ) warnings about the planet 's overpopulation and extinction of all natural resources , starting from fresh water . 
  this logic reminds me one of the joke about a man who saves from the flood on a church 's spire . 
  a boat arrives and people there say him : `` let 's go with us . '', 
  `` no , '' the man answers , `` i know the lord will save me . '', 
  then another boat comes with the same dialogue , and another one . 
  he sends them off and continues to pray . 
  finally , water covers the spire and the man drowns . 
  he flies right to the heaven , meets god and asks him : `` i prayed to you so much , why did n't you send me salvation ? '', 
  `` i sent you three boats . '', 
   seems like you are having trouble with every nation on this planet . 
  do n't say for others , but i do n't . 
  that 's why i probably do not spend my time analyzing sayings of kolomoisky and discussing how it shows the hidden barbaric slave nature of ukrainian people . 
   why ? 
  why poking that absent limb ? 
  because it 's very cool . 
  but you 're right in some sense . 
  there could be better ways to deal with a situation . 
  i would vote differently . 
  too bad , your only point here is to prove how russians are brutal savage finns . 
   then again . 
  i do n't think you could make a well defined rule about how a preformer can look , dress or function . 
  that 's probably why we appoint highly subjective human judges to such competitions instead of building an algorithm that gives a score based on objective criteria . 
  and sometimes these judges insult disabled people and small girls . 
   this is really stupid . 
  in ukrainian russia everything is really stupid . 
  and in real one he gave a whole speech on the topic of that he thinks no one can excel a man dancing with one leg . 
   and the other judge called his disability a `` forbidden technique '' and voted against . 
  he said , it 's a forbidden technique , because a man dancing without a leg is absolutely unbeatable by any competitor and his performance is so high it will remove any sense from competition , as after voting for him the only option left will be to vote for him again and again up to the finale . 
  later on he apologized for his choice of words ' a forbidden technique ' . 
  let core = [ `` austria '' , `` belgium '' , `` estonia '' , `` finland '' , `` france '' , `` germany '' , `` greece '' , `` italy '' , `` latvia '' , `` lithuania '' , `` luxembourg '' , `` malta '' , `` netherlands '' , `` portugal '' , `` slovakia '' , `` slovenia '' , `` spain '' ] ; let peripheral = [ `` cyprus '' , `` ireland '' ] ; let poor = [ `` czechia '' , `` denmark '' , `` hungary '' , `` poland '' , `` sweden '' ] ; let nordic = [ `` liechtenstein '' , `` norway '' , `` iceland '' ] ; let foreveralone = [ `` switzerland '' ] ; let south = [ `` bulgaria '' , `` croatia '' , `` romania '' ] ; let dwarves = [ `` andorra '' , `` monaco '' , `` san marino '' , `` turkey '' ] ; let euroarea = core.concat ( peripheral ) ; let efta = nordic.concat ( foreveralone ) ; let shengen = core.concat ( poor , efta ) ; let eu = euroarea.concat ( poor , south ) ; let eea = eu.concat ( nordic ) ; let ecu = eu.concat ( dwarves ) ;, 
   actually the ottoman `` empire '' was allied with the europeans against ataturk and the independence movement : i thought it 's called civil war . 
  i am glad , i like this guy . 
  he is of course totally wrong about crimea , but there is no perfectness . 
  so true . 
  the problem is not they smile , the problem is they do n't smile , probably . 
  expressive cheap makeup ( ` cheap ' as in ` so bad you can say it 's makeup from the first view ' ) associated mostly with prostitution , pretentious grotesque dresses combine with very serious looks of deep thinkers and some heroine chick . 
  all together it fully vanishes any possibility of associating it with some fairytales and shows clearly that these pictures are photos of young not very bright modern girls wrapped in some funny clothes . 
  the soullessness of these works forbids it to be some form of art , and so it all turns to be about money . 
  speaking shortly , all i see is whores . 
  do n't recognize almost anything , all i see is whores trying to make smart faces . 
  obviously , saint patrick is a true official orthodox saint , as all the saints before the great schism that did n't share ideas opposite to the teachings of orthodox churches ( isidore of seville is n't recognized as a saint , for example , because of filioque ) . 
  so , can you build a monorail with transparent trains over these wastelands , france ? 
  opium wars were the part of the secession of china ( preparations for this event ) and to xx century almost every great power was ready to do it and take their piece , the question was about shares everyone will get . 
  a winner with a biggest piece would unconditionally turn into the superpower , losers get subjugation and possibly destruction . 
  that 's what was the reasons of the great war , and that 's what happened . 
  winners took everything , losers were turned into slaves and spent xxth century by helping interests of the winners fighting between each other for absolute supremacy . 
  would the great war end differently , there was no the usa hegemony , there was no the third reich , there was no the ussr , no wwii , no falling of monarchies and no democracy , no communist china , no decolonization . 
  probably there would be something different and not much better than what we got . 
  so , speaking shortly : in the great war every power fought for its right to determine history for next hundred years , to shape the world by their ideas , simply for survival . 
  it was n't senseless and vice versa , it was the most important war ever for every its participant through its whole history . 
   what you wo n't learn is wether ww1 made any sense at any point of time and in which way it was totally worth it for any party involved . 
  cutting china pie . 
  and he said to you that it was very far from the third world level . 
  i was in bangladesh and indonesia and can confirm that eastern europe 's problems are nothing in comparison . 
  the revolution in tsar russia was two years before , not a decade later . 
  every rape is sex . 
  a headscarf is a casual headwear . 
  what is there i think is some variation of a kokoshnik , a heavy big rich top weared on holidays and other important dates like weddings and so on . 
  [ images in these article ] can give the idea of its variety . 
  a man with a knife can . 
  it 's traditional for russians ( as tatars , bashkirs and all other ethnicities have their own traditional dress obviously ) , and it differs much from a region to a region . 
  for example , these funny mushroom hats - i 've never seen them before . 
   but anyway it 's just a stockholm syndrome i am not an ukrainian . 
  of several . 
  because i am their blood . 
  46 % of russians do n't worship stalin . 
   like russians do by worshipping stalin ? 
  like some russians do by worshipping stalin and , yes , exactly like this . 
  there are a lot of communists in russia and as all other communists in the world they separate in different factions , and as among all other communists in the world there is a marginal faction of stalinists . 
  bad , but mind diseases exist . 
  today i learned . 
  before i knew only guinness of all civilized countries ' beers . 
  but it seems , there 's reallly a wide choice of beer in england . 
  i always thought this ` c ' in words like lech , czech is to determine it 's a slavic hard ` x ' , not english soft ` h ' . 
  for now and forever . 
  there 's nothing bad about calling irish engli, 
  no , i am alive . 
  i hope , they will fignt for their rights and resist until building the pipeline through territory of ukraine , romania , bulgary , greece , italy , spain , portugal , france , switzerland , austria , hungary , slovakia , czechia , poland and finally germany . 
  that way it will be most just and sensing , because i insist again , portugal 's right to transit gas from russa to germany is immanent and can not be disputed . 
  also it will help economics of all these countries . 
  well , i do n't know about intelligence or weakness , but women are definitely smaller than me , and i am of very average height . 
   putin is n't gon na attend any pre-election debates with competitors putin never attends debates . 
  people who know more about political technologies than me say that for a leading candidate debates are only a way to lose votes and weaken their position . 
  you can make a wealth in russia even if you 're stupid . 
  the land of opportunities !, 
  the seat must be heated . 
  if you sit on the cold surface , you 'll become impotent . 
  that 's why slavs squat . 
  so , push your shit onto floor . 
  your stomach will be empty and ready when it arrives . 
  sangria is absolutely perfect . 
  and spanish wine is better . 
  it 's the best wine in the world . 
  i just wonder why that girl sucks the dutch flag . 
  is n't it unpatriotic ? 
  this guy was granted with alternative freedom , so what 's the talk about ? 
  at least your country does n't use thermic crypto-analyzers yet .
