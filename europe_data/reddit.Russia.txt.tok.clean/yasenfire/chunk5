  you have a freedom to stay away of the conflict and with full guarantees of your human and citizen rights , or you can participate in and take full responsibility for the consequences . 
  with the full responsibility . 
  there were attempts to break the mongols rule , one was successful , many previous were ingloriously ended , ended in a bad way . 
  but those who attempted knew well , what they do and what will happen with them in the case of their lose . 
  i think , it is just . 
  but it is the separatist revolt . 
  were there analogical crimes of russians against poles ? 
  you did when you had your chance and you collaborated with bolsheviks . 
  so , when you remember all this stuff about warsaw uprising , about how unfortunate citizens of warsaw were betrayed etc , remember , who had destroyed muscowy & who helped those betrayers to rise . 
  you had your chance . 
  you destroyed muscowy . 
  enjoy your katyn . 
  you 've spared a lot of misery for yourselves . 
  how can anyone to not be proud of spain ? 
  even i am proud of spain . 
  i think , the orthodox church is the putin 's bitch , not that putin is the bitch of the orthodox church . 
  which words ? 
  if anyone places ideology ( * any * ideology ) before the other , he is nothing more than fanatic . 
  to judge the history - the same . 
  for example , let 's say germany is the country with christian roots . 
  probably , ancient germans even killed some people because of their sexual orientation and because of religious motives . 
  what can it say me about germans ? 
  nothing . 
  they did n't knew before homosexuals are the same people . 
  they know it now . 
  there are no things that were known always . 
  well , at first , i do n't understand this ` still ' . 
  it seems important for you , if you even marked it with bold . 
  there 's no possibility for the orthodox church to ** still ** lead to human right abuses . 
  the russian orthodox church was totally reformed two times since the middle ages and once fully destroyed and recreated by the organization that have nothing common with the orthodoxy , christianity and any other religion . 
  so this structure called the orthodox church can not ** still ** lead to human rights . 
  at second , of course , i do not see again , why i must feel shame of my christian roots , because christianity is a homophobic religion . 
  yes , it is . 
  but to spit at every previous generation of ancestors because of homos , for me it is somewhat close to the behavior of first christians destroying ancient statues , because it 's the sin to worship idols . 
  fanaticism . 
  it 's difficult to judge people of obscurantism when you are more obscurant than they are . 
  if you are a true norwegian black metalist , then yes . 
  i do not see much of shame in christian roots . 
  in russian there is ` the resurrection ' instead of sunday , and i do n't know anyone who would be annoyed of it . 
  because serbians are turkish finno-ugres . 
  why is crimea marked here as the former colony ? 
  i still do not see there a problem . 
  finns and russians had ( & still have ) saunas . 
  swedes and norwegians , probably , too , it seems like a nordic thing . 
  a steam bath clears more effectively than water alone . 
  the climate is not warm , so you do n't sweat much . 
  and there 's still possibility to put a barrel , fill it with water and douche yourself at morning , warm up some water in a footbath at evening and wash your feet . 
  in childhood i was spending my summers in the grandpa 's village usually and that 's somehow close to how my grandparents lived , they had a traditional banya and heated it once a week . 
  maybe , a typical modern urban dweller is a bit more clean than a nord of medieval ages . 
  but they surely were much more cleaner than their contemporaries from western europe , and , probably , from the biggest part of the world . 
  i do n't understand what 's the problem with the ` bath day ? 
  i still take a bath once a week . 
  seriously , there is a big difference between ` bathing ' and ` showering ' . 
  how about the ` language ' word ? 
  the most hateful thing about britain is your accent . 
  you swallow sounds , pronounce them in the different way , use the strange worlds , like ` the tube ' instead of subway . 
  your american is very difficult for understanding . 
  that 's the root of all evil . 
  i tell you about spitting at russians . 
  you start yell at me . 
  yell , carl !, 
  it 's really not how educated people talk . 
  it 's how thieves talk . 
  or just ordinary drunks maybe . 
  no matter . 
  you start to telling me about some covert operations of the tsarist government . 
  probably they did it . 
  so what ? 
  russian soldiers who died in bulgaria were not planning something like this . 
  but you spit at them again because of something they could n't change . 
  typical . 
  then you start to talk about gas . 
  it is bad move . 
  really . 
  let imagine you met a beautiful woman , you talk with her about this , about that . 
  you and she are very similar , you both have a lot of topics to discuss , you understand each other . 
  you like her , she likes you , it seems . 
  and all goes well before she suddenly starts talk about money . 
  it changes all . 
  now , for example you can be rude with her , say her fuck off . 
  because she is not equal more , just a prostitute . 
  and you , if you are sane man with working social sense , must talk with her like with a prostitute , not a girlfriend . 
  ( if it was even something just , because russia proposed to pay bulgaria for gas and bulgaria proudly refused ) finally , you start to associate yourselves with some nomads , writing about stealing the alphabet ( the alphabet ) . 
  i can only applaud . 
  if there would be some doubts after my posts , you did everything to bury them . 
  both doubts and your country . 
  russians have n't been thinking bad about bulgarians , never . 
  they are slavs , they are good people , they are in trouble and why do n't we help them ? 
  i remember what my mom told us when she had returned from bulgaria . 
  well , it 's all in the past . 
  in 2014 bulgarians went to the memorial of russian soldiers , ugly , soviet , communistic memorial , i do not deny , and wrote here with big black letters ` heil ukraine ' . 
  and painted the flag . 
  it will be what russians remember . 
  ` bulgarians ? ' . 
  ` oh , those nazi thinking we stole their alphabet ' . 
  and i just stated this . 
  well done , continue your mockery . 
  yellow and blue , your colors . 
  as one beautiful ukrainian mind said , ` they painted themselves in those colors they painted themselves in ' . 
  the investigation is going .
