wait , did anyone at all believe that ? 
  over here , the news sources that cared to analyze all came to a conclusion that the bailout was provided just to delay the problem , and that it could be delayed again and again until the eu would feel stable enough to try and solve it . 
  this one looks like the best so far . 
  good job on turks , french , swedes , and yourselves . 
  at least they have no idea what kind of chinese cartoons is being streamed . 
  is it ? 
  graduated in 2006 , and the most i can recall is `` we took them per the non-aggression pact , and there was some resistance '' . 
  although it was one of the least interesting periods of modern history , so i might have skipped straight to the war bits . 
  not in belarus .

  we tried , dad . 
  we tried so hard and got so far . 
  we 're so lost without you . 
  you guys took the first place in fifa 2015 rating . 
  something something road to hell and good intentions . 
  that one is `` how else are you supposed to call those guys ? '', 
  therefore , `` a bit '' . 
  so what 's the correct answer to the first question ? 
  [ we got a tiny bit better .

  it ai n't gon na attack itself . 
  so you wo n't stop defending russia from my `` racism '' by being racist towards its inhabitants . 
  most interesting kind of defense . 
  yes , this is exactly what i 've been asking you to do all this time . 
  then go on , send that report . 
  racism is a bannable offense here , is it not ? 
  i 'll be dying of laughter when i 'm banned before a wannabe white knight that implies that we russians should be thankful to be considered human . 
  we were invited .

  your username is relevant to your agenda and methods . 
  a piece of handy advice for you : do n't play spoken equilibristics with russians , most of us have heard enough of those to last a lifetime or two . 
  take your last post for example . 
  you state that `` a senseless mash-up of the following terms would still describe us better than any term from the list that does make sense on its own '' equals to `` every term from the list is true when applied to us '' . 
  that 's just low effort . 
  now to the original issue , rephrased for better understanding . 
  would you call the article neutral or would you insist that a neutral attitude is high praise for us ? 
  again , read the post . 
  i said you classified the article as positive , the human part is pretty obvious with basic reading comprehension . 
  either that , or the author of the article comes from a place with some shitty people , in which case she has my condolences . 
  my only personal comment on russian people was saying that the following list :  occupants ? 
  gentle people ? 
  violent drunks ? 
  nationalists ? 
  fascists ? 
  communists ? 
  imperialists ? 
  just corrupt ? 
  atheists ? 
  fundamentalists ? 
  nihilists ? 
  mashed together describes us better than any part of it alone . 
  the rest was my perception of your comments , which you still avoid addressing by presenting it as my own view . 
  it 's quite funny to see someone calling themselves `` occupy the kremlin '' talk about agendas . 
  did i ? 
  read the post again . 
  additional clarification : i said that judging by your classification of the article ( describing russians as human ) as `` positive '' , a `` neutral '' russian image , an unbiased one , should be worse than human ( subhuman ) . 
  defender my ass . 
  apparently you want to get out of a sticky situation by resorting to a `` no you '' argument . 
  it depicts us human , which should be a given . 
  if this is what `` positive light '' means , then the image of an ordinary russian is pretty subhuman , and that contradicts your last line . 
  you 'll have to do better than this . 
  because you 're handsome :3, 
  oh i know what we are and what kind of nicknames our politicians deserve . 
  lived here for a tiny bit of time , see , so i do n't need a tacky headline to define my today 's image of russia and russians . 
  occupants ? 
  gentle people ? 
  violent drunks ? 
  nationalists ? 
  fascists ? 
  communists ? 
  imperialists ? 
  just corrupt ? 
  atheists ? 
  fundamentalists ? 
  nihilists ? 
  what are you going to call us tomorrow , occupant ? 
  or will you call us everything on that list at once ( hitting closer to reality ) and then wonder how the mysterious russian \u00ae soul \u2122 managed to combine everything at once ? 
  where does this one come from , though ? 
  i 'm yet to hear any lithuanian spec ops stories . 
  it 's easier to prove you 're not a camel when you have one . 
  sick burns on italy . 
  wait , so lithuania has special forces now ? 
  hot news , hot news , brought to you exclusively by la times !, 
  humans in russia ? 
  it 's more likely than you think !, 
  is it for the same reason as their [ glorification of waffen ss ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/16/latvians-march-commemorate-ss-veterans ) ? 
  nice one though . 
  huge is a lifestyle , not a destiny . 
  becoming huge is a matter of desire and a lot of effort . 
  zyzz be with you , australia . 
  quick to forget , are we ? 
  to the soldiers who fought in the war . 
  as i said , your choice . 
  i was referring to a link provided one post earlier . 
  and in any case , osce is silent on foreign military forces on ukrainian soil , unlike ukrainian officials . 
  does n't this mean they 're pro-russian and are working to destabilise ukrainian society and endanger ukrainian independence ?
