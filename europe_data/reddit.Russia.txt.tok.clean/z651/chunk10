  good luck latvia , that hellspawn absorbs roundup like rain water . 
  and it has a somewhat better justification than `` these villagers deserve to die because i wrote so in my book '' .

  try 20000 , what with those mutant bears , unrestricted krokodil consumption , and deadly radiation levels . 
  today 's unsc meeting record has not been published yet . 
  oh , there 's little connection between him and zhirinovsky , it 's just an example of how important he is over here . 
  you have a point about naryshkin though , and that by extension means that dugin 's voice was heard across our parliament . 
  that makes him a better influence that expected , actually . 
  we have a problem with how disconnected the elites are from the people over here . 
  visiting the english-speaking parts of the internet often feels like being alice as she steps into the mirror . 
  you guys are for some reason strongly convinced that dugin 's opinion holds some weight , that zhirinovsky is a serious politician with an influence , etc. 
  here 's the dry summary of the situation . 
  trump is the least ordinary of the potential candidates , the least suitable for the american establishment , it seems from over here , he 's not an experienced politician , and can be compared to the aforementioned zhirinovsky , going by the heat and controversy generated through his statements . 
  trump 's views matter little as long as he retains this image . 
  anybody else could behave like him and kremlin , along with many of us , would see him as a preferential candidate , dugin be damned . 
  plenty of us dream about the reunification of the empire , be it called a union or a federation or whatever else , without a need to know who dugin is . 
  it 's what people see as a proper status quo , not an artificial ideology . 
  no idea if it 's what you 're looking for , but the [ ______ watch ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/night_watch_ ( lukyanenko_novel ) ) series ( currently 5 entries , night/day/twilight / last/new ) is your best bet around present days ' local literature . 
  it includes a total of zero miligrams of history , but is ripe with realosm and local flavour . 
  side effects may include your nephew becoming a bitter cynic . 
  yeah , i 've deleted mine . 
  this is heavily affected by the muslim population density though . 
  i 'll adjust it in some five minutes . 
  [ there have been certain talks about this , ] ( https://www.rt.com/business/319974-russia-syria-contracts-construction/ ) and the local business is unlikely to pass on a government 's contract , even if it 's a foreign government . 
  such things are less news than palmyra or war though , so it 's unlikely that anything like `` a factory opens anew in aleppo '' will ever make it to the headlines .

  wonder if someone slipped up at the speech writing department or if it was meant to sound this way .

  ] ( http://economytimes.ru/novosti/sergey-chemezov-oboronnye-rashody-v-2016-godu-budut-sokrashcheny-na-10 ) however , the ongoing [ reform ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_russian_military_reform ) will serve as a free news generator all the way up until 2020 , no matter how much it gets cut . 
  [ that was in no way an ordinary rbmk test ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/chernobyl_disaster#steam_turbine_tests ) , although i was partially mistaken about its purpose . 
  i mean yeah , the japanese have claimed so since 1993 or some such , they even carried out live testing if memory serves me right , but then fukushima happened . 
  not exactly a plane , but it raises some questions . 
  exactly . 
  the experiment was carried out to see whether or not the turbines running on inertia could be used to produce electricity still , a function the reactor was never designed for . 
  for that purpose , the plant ( one of its blocks , to be precise ) had to be run in its state of shutting down , another thing never intended by design . 
  if there was a single scientist around to tell the suits up above about iodine poisoning , and how the breeding coefficient loves getting out of control at those stages , how it 's well beyond human or automatic reaction , then maybe the incident could 've been avoided . 
  probably not . 
  it 's gorbachev 's policy of saving money at all costs we 're talking about here after all . 
  chernobyl was a result of trying hard to squeeze additional power out of an outdated design in the absence of a single competent scientist in the bureaucratic machine up above that issued the order . 
  the worst case scenario would be a radioactive fallout , but you 'd have to crash a plane or two straight into the plant . 
  and you pretend that the lawyer 's death will silence them . 
  is n't that silly ? 
  and yet they live , fully able to talk anything they want . 
  the western press will jump at anything juicy they have to say , that 's for sure . 
  does n't look like anyone wanted them silent , does it ? 
  the one dead is their legal representative versed in the ways of law , who would be able to represent their position at court much better than they themselves . 
  he 's dead , and the documentation which would be used for their defense is missing . 
  looks like someone wanted them found guilty , does n't it ? 
  and let me remind everyone that [ the hearings have been opened without the lawyer or his replacement present ] ( http://tass.ru/en/world/862426 ) to speed up the process . 
  now , if you google `` savchenko exchange '' , you 'll find quite a few mentions who she was offered to be exchanged for . 
  those people are , surprisingly , quite relevant to our topic , and exchanging savchenko is kind of a big deal , since her sentencing was beneficial not only to russia , which has made a statement , and to ukraine , that has received its martyr to farther fuel the hatred towards russia . 
  the problem is , to be exchanged , both sides have to be sentenced first , and the topic at hand has coincidentally produced much progress towards that goal . 
  now now , what exactly is a lie in that article ? 
  did the lawyer not go missing on approximately 6th of march ? 
  is he alive ? 
  does ukraine not claim that his client was a russian serviceman ? 
  does russian mod claim he was ? 
  i understand that the word `` russian '' is to you what red pants are to a bull , but hey , let 's at least pretend to be serious here . 
  and i suppose the death of the man most suited to prove otherwise is a tragic coincidence . 
   kiev claims the detainees are russian servicemen . 
  should 've read the article . 
  a reason for celebration , eh ? 
  we did it all , buster . 
  we did it all . 
  why would anyone want to eat kebabs though ? 
  a usual kebab is about as good as a burger from mcdolan 's . 
  politicals get that . 
  hell , political asylum seekers get that and a whole lot more , but they 're very few and far between . 
  the last and only time in xxi century russia provided basic assistance en masse was to the people fleeing from the ukrainian conflict , but the list of countries which residents can count on the same treatment is short . 
  ukraine , belarus , the baltics , caucasian minors , central asian postsovietstans . 
  maybe even shorter . 
  otherwise , you get nothing . 
  that 's one of the two major reasons why neither refugees nor `` refugees '' come here to stay . 
  that would explain it partially , but why they 'd keep kuusamo , vartius , niirala , imarta , and vainikkala open ? 
  that is hardly a choicea country can make , and what choice it does have lies in its immigration policy , not the emigration one . 
  russian immigration policy does not discourage arabic immigration more than any other kind , and on top of that , there had to be a certain amount of refugees coming over the border , else the finns would n't bother with the agreement . 
  maybe it 's a preemptive measure to ensure that the norwegian polar antics do n't happen to them , but again , locking a fraction of the border will redirect the problem , not stop it . 
  seriously though , this is an insufficient measure . 
  the border has nine crossings in total , all of which have to be closed in the same manner for the flow to stop . 
  why , probably to oppression of free speech , human rights , and genocide of national minorities . 
  i mean , what else can you expect with those dastardly russians ? 
  do answer .
