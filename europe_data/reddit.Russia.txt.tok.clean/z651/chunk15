  the tricky part is that there can exist different viewpoints on culture . 
  taking a local example again , the question of gogol . 
  ukraine claims he 's ukrainian , while almost any russian knows he 's russian . 
  both are right , and both are wrong . 
  there 's just no correct universal answer in such cases . 
  we 're of the same blood and the same mind , so do n't get your hopes too high . 
  [ i wish it stopped after sobering up . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/hcbpb_fqcse ), 
  something like `` wan na bet ? '', 
  [ if it means `` lul bruh , bet you would n't dare to do this stupid bullshit '' , then you 're 100 % correct . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/ve2k9bg8_og ), 
  of course . 
  it 's * zeitgeist * . 
  it was far from an open conflict back then , and i would 've preferred for it to stay that way , but yes . 
  the * zeitgeist * that led to a conflict so far and will lead to who knows what still started more than a decade back . 
  what difference is there ? 
  what is there of importance ? 
  most of american politics are defined by the congress anyways ( if i understand anything ) , and talk what they may , the presidents wo n't make much difference on those matters . 
  especially where my country 's mentioned . 
  just a reminder that the * zeitgeist * dates back to 2003 . 
  are you 100 % sure those are my quotes ? 
  did i ? 
  and yet , it was not done . 
  yeltsin tried to do it around the time when the unionite territories were being divided , but he was so incompetent that even kravchuk tricked him like an elementary schooler . 
  should there be anything else ? 
  \u0425\u0414 '' 1 : '' \u041d\u0430 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440 \u0425\u0414\u0414\u0414\u0414\u0414\u0414\u0414\u0414\u0414\u0414\u0414\u0414\u0414 '' 2 : '' \u0425\u0414\u0414\u0414 '' and then at least one of them ends up at a hospital with a lot of problems but a feeling of accomplishment . 
  there 's little to fail to understand in a source link . 
  a common answer to that is `` because khruschev was ukrainian '' . 
  note this was n't the only one of his arbitrary territorial exchanges between the subjects of the unionite contract . 
  kazakhstan gained a lot of its northern territories thanks to him iirc . 
  his reasoning eludes me . 
  http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/displaynews.aspx?newsid=20017&amp;langid=e original statement . 
  nah , it goes back to late fifties , at least . 
  gorbachev was an inept leader whose best suite were speeches that left people scratching their heads due to being unable to recall what he said . 
  did n't make him look good at all . 
  you glorious son of a bitch . 
  once again , there was no reason or physical possibility to take it over during gorbachev 's rule , as we were one country . 
   according to insiders  allegedly as a result of pressure from the kremlin  loyal viewers speculated  apparently due to one of the investors ' interests in `` russian cosmism ''  it was in response to angry calls from customers  other publishers alleged the conflict was due to ...  the reason for kovalsky 's dismissal was his decision to publish a photograph of course they needed to put a putin on it to sound convincing . 
  your choice . 
  the mock attacks are . 
  it was about as much as our own people got . 
  do n't expect more . 
   you met those russians who can afford traveling abroad , which means that they earn more , which in its turn means that they are better educated and more intelligent just like the courchevel extravaganza participants , right ? 
  god dammit , i was sure it 'd be a good joke . 
   they had retired from soviet army just days before their capture wait , just for how long have you been keeping them captive ? 
  whole lot of media buzz going on over here , different sources report different stages of exchange underway , but one thing the absolute majority of outlets agrees on is that the exchange is going to happen . 
  those seats are all booked for a decade ahead . 
   polite people expect a police officer at your place to question you about collaborating with future invaders : ^ ), 
  `` to sit while the anthem 's playing means you have to stare at the ass of the one standing . '', 
  cumans were the tribe that lived in the region before the tatars came . 
  then there were no cumans , and the land was considered tatar . 
  have another example : australia . 
  have another example : the americas . 
  you may not like it , but it is how the world works . 
  did i ? 
   because they do not feel that most of the society supports this discrimination , whereas the tatars seem to do so then again , why is this only the case in crimea ? 
   no ethniticy has to , and should govern alone . 
  exactly . 
  yet , the vocal part of crimean tatars are the same people that promote their mejlis while the country already has a federal parliament , and the region already has a local one , where they can and should represent themselves . 
   sending a message ? 
  so the same thing our airforce has been doing . 
  this is nice to hear . 
  i wonder what those recon planes are doing out there . 
  surely they never gather targeting information for those very same us/nato/eu assets coincidentially parked right next to the border . 
  i believe that not having hostile forces kilometers away from their borders factors in the states ' decision not to conduct mock bombing runs . 
  intel agencies work at all times . 
  the world is in a constant cold war . 
  that explains it , thanks . 
  tell this to the cumans . 
  oh snap , the 146 % meme is back , and it 's as real as ever !, 
  hoo boy , if we go by epic neo-nazi graffiti on abandoned buildings , then why do n't the jews , for example , complain about their oppression ? 
  as for the ownership and attitude , russia is 80.9 % russian , sure we act like we run the place . 
  in crimea , russian and ukrainian population put together equal to the same ~ 80 % , while the tatars sit at around 10 % . 
  should a minority govern ? 
  even in tatarstan , where you say russians are guests , the respective shares of the population that identify as tatar and russian are 54 % to 40 % . 
  and still we coexist . 
  soon to be removed , no doubt . 
  no kidding , it was considered a beacon of freedom and democracy alongside voa here as well back in the day ( if the older generation is to be believed ) . 
  people got disillusioned later , when communism was no more . 
  i wonder what makes tatars in crimea feel more special and oppressed compared to tatars in tatarstan and the surrounding regions , who live in the same country and seem to have few problems doing so . 
  wait , what ? 
  [ here 's a track about putting a condom on one 's own head . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/pq9fosqaemo ) it gets somewhat political . 
  this deserves the front page much more than the usual articles about russia that make it there . 
  her political opinion may be debatable , but what she does present is a slice of the local mindset . 
  her words on what the freedom fighters really wanted , on the western image of putin le unpredictable dictator extraordinaire , hell , even the quote in the title , it 's all spot on . 
  google 's first images for `` urskog '' do n't seem much different from a regular forest farther than 100km from moscow . 
  are those not representative ? 
  but you ca n't even undergo military modernisation with 6 adm !, 
  yup , just informing . 
  bohemia will get you stuck between austria , brandengurg , and poland , / u/beanyadult . 
  hungary will put you betweeen austria , poland , and the ottomans . 
  thank you . 
  if there 's no dedicated one , you can always join as an unclaimed country and use the observe command through the console . 
  then the advantage is yours . 
  i 've already done some groundwork , so pm me if you 're interested in it as well . 
  considering your religious stance , i doubt an ottoman alliance is possible . 
  oh , holy hell , i absolutely forgot about the deal with burgundy . 
  thanks , i 'll try it in sp if i have the time after work and before we start . 
  i 'd very much like to see some austro-prussian rivalry too , if someone claims one of those countries .
