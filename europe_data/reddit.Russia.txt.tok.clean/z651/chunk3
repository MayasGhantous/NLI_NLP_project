  on shaurma stands though , the guy is right , these things are rat centrals and should be forced into civilization . 
  the vendor policy is bad as a whole , but god damn are they right on shaurma stands . 
  and several decades on top of 36 hours to mitigate the following reaction . 
  nato is a guarantee of your safety . 
  if his shows here at ntv some long years ago are anything to go by , he knows how to drive his guests into a zealous rage , pit them against each other , and reap great ratings from it . 
  he 's very good at what he does , and i 'm sure canada has a show that would benefit from his skill . 
   today , almost 90 percent of russians regularly watch news programs on state television , while only 30 percent of the country use alternative sources of information . 
  i 'll take source for 300 , alex. 
  it 's a good article for meduza though , it takes its time building trust with the reader through reliable information before diving into its natural habitat . 
  that 's one unexpected question . 
  three words : turkey , mushrooms , sour cream . 
  okay , four words . 
  this dish is awesome , and i 'm not even big on shrooms . 
  also , acid jokes inbound . 
  i was making a joke related to europa universalis . 
  russia will do its most to prevent any country within a well defined border from merging with others , pledging allegiance to anyone , or entering military conflicts . 
  bessarabia lies within said border . 
  i sure hope it 's not a bullshit one that expires in 3 months . 
  weird , i 've never come to this conclusion reading what the western media has to say about russia . 
  it definitely feels like you guys adore repetition . 
   again jokes aside i think it is inevitable for some regions in the long run , they can not be held by force forever . 
  and here comes the point in the conversation where i just put my hands up and want to use the `` just come over and check yourself how much force is applied to hold them '' , but then remember that it 's easier to believe the memes from afar . 
  i should write a booklet on talking to westerners and the expected flow of conversation . 
  i dunno , we get news from belarus weekly or so . 
  their agricultural business has been booming like crazy . 
  never would 've thought belarus had the conditions to grow oysters and pineapples , or the experience to make parmesan that tastes just like the italian version . 
  apart from this , when was the last time belarus was called a dictatorship in the media ?

  ] ( http://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ecli:nl:rbdha:2016:4229 ) i know , hague is n't russia , but yukos news is . 
  there was little reason to do so . 
  we were pretty busy killing each other and ourselves to pose any threat back then . 
  and no one 's talking about annexation , of course not . 
  we 're talking about setting oppressed regions free from the imperial grasp . 
  exactly . 
  same goes for the western regions and other powerful countries to our west . 
  oh they have every right to . 
  there can be one every two years , if the people want it . 
  looks like the people that do reside beyond our country 's borders , though . 
  so it 's true what they say , a westerner wo n't be content until tula `` declares independence '' . 
  a permanent nuclear arsenal would deter russia even better . 
  a declaration of independence from 80 of its 85 subjects would deter russia even better still !, 
  i 'm asking for an official reaction or a traceable source and providing political background , which does n't necessarily equal to denial . 
  https://youtu.be/-wbbp0omsom this song is from 2007 . 
  der spiegel 's kind of lagging . 
  that 's israel 's problem with iran and vice versa . 
  russia and persia have been friendly for centuries longer than modern israel 's history , and it 's not about to change soon . 
  israeli diplomats ( they visit our radio stations sometimes ) sound pretty cool with these relations , even for the diplomats they are . 
  besides , most of israel 's problems with iran stem from hezbollah 's palestinian activities , and if hezbollah keeps its activities focused on syria , israel benefits from a relatively easier situation on their own ground , iran benefits from steadily restoring a shiite-governed country back to its original state , russia benefits from having a foothold on the other side of turkey , and syria benefits from not becoming another breeding ground for sunni zealotry . 
  everybody gains , everybody 's happy . 
  for a while , at least . 
   the unsourced report in yedioth ahronoth gave no dates or locations for the incidents nor any indication israeli planes were hit . 
   an israeli military spokesman declined comment . 
  netanyahu 's office and the russian embassy in israel did not immediately respond . 
   [ today , the paper is headed by noah mozes 's son , arnon mozes . 
  for many years it was edited by herzl rosenblum 's son , moshe vardi , who was replaced in 2005 by rafi ginat . 
  it is published in tabloid format , and according to one author , its marketing strategy emphasizes `` drama and human interest over sophisticated analysis . 
  '' ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/yedioth_ahronoth#today ) reuters has to do better than push a tabloid story as reliable news . 
  russia and israel have mutually non-exclusive goals in syria . 
  one is there in force to prevent a lybian scenario which could direct a flow of fundamentalists to tajikistan and then further north where borders exist mostly on paper , the other labors to keep hezbollah 's newly acquired firepower on the syrian front . 
  as long as hezbollah is allied to the syrian government , these goals even lie along the same road . 
  israel and russia have little reason for hostilities . 
  they 've already given it to obama . 
  does the state make the laws that draw the line between these categories ? 
   it depends a lot on the viewpoint of the reporting you can scroll this page up or down and get an understanding of the viewpoint . 
  and a protest resulting in resignation can hardly be called overthrowing over here . 
  1917 and 1991 can . 
  do you realize why we are n't that hot on the idea now ? 
  only if you pay the first of the mutual visits . 
  russian hospitality , you know . 
  yes , blaming the same corrupt media that fails to report this thread 's topic on every channel ( not ) will explain everything . 
  i 'll repeat my last post : overthrowing the government is not the solution . 
  if this is apathy to you , go overthrow your own next time you see a social problem around . 
  we only do this when there 's little to lose , thank you very much . 
  a reformer better versed in politics than both of us together said a little bit more than a hundred years ago : `` you , gentlemen , seek great perturbances . 
  we seek a great russia '' . 
  when in 20 years i see that the third ukrainian revolt is as efficient at fighting corruption as both earlier ones , his words will still be right . 
   now which countries would be involved in this heavily depends on the circumstances the union breaks up . 
  austria , most probably , then the czechs and slovaks . 
  italy would probably join on special terms . 
  poland and benelux , probably . 
  france , maybe . 
  sorry , i had to do this . 
  because if we have n't been able to get rid of corruption in 400 years , there 's no reason to believe we can just throw corrupt politicians out and get angels instead . 
  frankly , i doubt it 's possible anywhere . 
  money entices . 
  would it now ? 
  would you ruin a functioning government , install new officials that are inexperienced on top of corrupt , give a green light to a total criminalization of society , and force the people into real poverty ? 
  or would you do this to russia exclusively ?
