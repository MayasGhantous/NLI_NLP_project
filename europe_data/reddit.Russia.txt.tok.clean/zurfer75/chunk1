then let 's go smoke behind the school , mates ? 
  omg , what 's this ? 
  reminds me of the french [ `` la b\u00eate '' ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072752/ ) , 1975 . 
  could n't agree more with your conclusions . 
  the considered opinion is a rara avis in these days , and it 's always pleasant to see . 
  your comment reminded me of [ * the last king of scotland * ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455590/ ) . 
  genocidal maniac , serial rapist and a cannibal . 
  such a nice guy !, 
  it 's ridiculous how many leaders tolerated him , gave him a handshake and hugged him , how many european banks were happy with his money . 
  who 's that ? 
  / s i ca n't even imagine him in that role . 
  perhaps , navalny has a chance . 
  no need to excuse , i do n't feel offended . 
  i just hope that things will settle down and get better for everybody . 
  is my english so bad or you have problems with comprehending ? 
  could you please point out where i said that ? 
  / u/tigrezno thinks that middle class elected putin and we have to suck it up . 
  i have an opposite opinion , that old retired motherfuckers are mostly responsible for that nonsense . 
  actually , no one knows for sure * because of * the rigged elections . 
  as a nation we with no doubt bear the burden of the responsibility for our leadership 's actions , at least , to some extent . 
  you 're confusing approval ratings of the glorious leader ( were 86 % ) with voting intentions ( less than 50 % ) and the percentage of people supporting the war with ukraine ( about 15 % , iirc ) , all numbers taken from the ~ ~ kremlin ass ~ ~ polls of `` levada centre '' . 
  i understand your anger and frustration though . 
  however , even 15 % mean millions of people who are potential allies of your country . 
  perhaps you should think about it . 
  or just switch to decaf . 
  yeltsin has put him in charge of russia from the starters . 
  `` i 'm tired , i 'm leaving '' and all that jazz . 
  last elections were obviously rigged . 
  so it 's an open question . 
  yes , it did . 
  it 's known . 
  it 's not clear why is russia ruining its own money making class and was it intentional or not . 
  may i remind you that making sweeping generalizations is not a sign of a great mind , let alone the usage of the word ` bydlo ' ? 
  a complete denial of mistakes may be also interpreted as a method of psychic defence . 
  the same reaction has happened in russia after the end of the 90s which were filled with recognizing of soviet atrocities . 
  it was my pleasure . 
  thank you and wish you the same !, 
  i answered for a similar comment in the thread i linked . 
  tl ; dr - i blame the west for only one thing . 
   entire claim to legitimacy oh dear , he finally lost his legitimacy during the last elections . 
  [ did n't change anything ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%e2%80%9313_russian_protests ) . 
   capacity to invade another neighbor russia does n't need any special `` capacity '' in this case . 
  you 've confused the countries , as usual . 
  it 's not the us whose servicemen are getting expensive training and are paid high wages while they are performing their duties on the other side of the planet . 
  have you seen the photos of results of the first fighting for the donetsk airport ? 
  where a pile of dead boides lying in a small room ? 
  i read the story about it in runet . 
  volunteers , who participated in the battle , were hired in the office in rostov for about $ 1k per week . 
  let 's count . 
  if a random unemployed dude decides to make some money ( why not , right ? ), 
  killing enemies of mother russia , how much it would cost ? 
  - training : may be none or a couple of weeks in the camp . 
  bless the conscription !, 
  - equipment , weapon , ammo , ration packs , meds : from the warehouse . 
  - transportation : a bus or train ticket ( $ 10-200 ) - wages : ok let it will be as high as $ 1000 a week , good money , btw . 
  mind you , during chechen wars both ukrainans and russians were fighting there as mercenaries on the chechen side . 
  these were the `` hungry 90s '' . 
  nice plan , ai n't it ? 
  hehe . 
  the hostility towards the west are steadily growing even among the middle class of moscow , let alone the low-paid majority . 
  [ if anyone interested , i described my own impression of the current situation . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2lgy2c/russia_reserves_decline_105_billion_most_since_may/clv0q55 ) in short , the middle class in russia ( apparently the most westernized part of the population ) was caught between the rock and a hard place . 
  now many of them feel themselves betrayed . 
  this class are currently facing the possibility of full disappearance within the next year . 
  actually , i find the policy of the regime totally brilliant in terms of efficiency . 
  now the vast majority are rallying around putin as around the flag , the fifth column is being frowned upon by ~ ~ low-paid drunkards ~ ~ fellow countrymen , authorities even need n't to turn on the full stalin to fight the dissent . 
  more and more people would end up blaming the west , even though they realize what is the true cause of their miseries . 
  interesting , was this outcome desirable or has it happened accidentally ? 
  i could if the exchange rate in my bank made any sense , but the main reason is we 've been trying to convert leftover of rubles into cash . 
  edit : we 've pulled leftover from the deposit account , but , as far as the exchange rate in fucking spermbank was ridiculously higher ( above 60 ( ! ), 
  per euro ) than official , i found it more logical to withdraw rubles and buy some cash in another bank . 
  i do n't have any suggestions . 
  anyway , it 's too late already . 
  maybe , as a future advice , it would be great not to suck a dick of the dictator and do not turn a blind eye while he is oppressing remains of the internal opposition . 
  we made this bed now we lie in it . 
  personally , i 'm aware of the fact that the burden of responsibility of the ruble plummeting mostly lies on the shoulders of the leader and the incompetent government . 
  i 've just brought over here a piece of vox populi of the moscow middle class . 
  btw , i heard it all in the bank 's branch on leninsky avenue , not in some siberian village . 
   how hard is it to get dollars or euros ? 
  queues currently are almost in every bank . 
  if you do n't see a queue it means that a branch has no money left or the exchange rate has reached a level named `` it 's ridiculous , i 'd better buy a vodka '' . 
  today i noticed several atms which have stopped giving out currency , only rubles . 
   can you keep a dollar denominated bank account easily ? 
  yep . 
  i 'm yet to see any changes here , but it 's only an anecdotal evidence . 
   also , is there an official rate/what is the typical rate you get compared to the institutional rate ? 
  www.exocur.ru - check it out . 
  a gap between the exchange rate in different banks is reaching 3-5 rubles . 
  also , there 's a rumor ( or so-called insider info ) that banks will have imposed strict limitations on currency sale on monday . 
  i do n't know if this is true or not . 
  consequences of a plummeting ruble have interesting side effects . 
  today i was waiting in queue for two hours , * nigga just wanted to buy his mama some dollars * . 
  i tried to fight a bad mood , reluctantly listened to mid-aged cunts who were arguing about the latest events in economy and ukraine along with crimea etc. 
  previously , i 've been thinking that i live in a good district . 
  it 's just nonsense what amount of shit they are full of . 
  the large majority of the citizens of rufed had a generally favourable ( or at least indifferent ) attitude towards eu/us before the the beginning of the year . 
  the recent polls show that approval ratings of the current regime are going on the decline as more and more people are realizing the perspective of falling into poverty , in spite of wide-spread jingoistic propaganda . 
  however , it would be a great mistake to think that falling of the popularity of putin means simultaneous improving of the image of the west . 
  i 'd rather say that people are massively jumping in the anti-west hate wagon . 
  personally for me , the saddest part is that even people who belong to the westernized minority are losing the ground beneath their feet .
