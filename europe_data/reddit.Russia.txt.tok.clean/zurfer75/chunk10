  even if i add a percentage of people who speaks other * european * languages ( or claims so ) ... well , let 's assume it would be 10 % or so in total . 
  a rhetorical question is : does anyone still wonder why russians * en masse * have no clue about the actual news instead of translated sources ? 
  guess why the gov ' t got all major websites under control along with the tv channels . 
  edit : ah , i forgot . 
  almost every time you see anything named `` russia '' on tv you presumably see moscow or spb . 
  these towns may even remind you berlin or paris in some cases . 
  i see why you wonder how can modern country be so backward when it comes to politics and polls . 
  you 're looking at the frontend . 
  wan na see the real russia ? 
  welcome to the / r/anormaldayinrussia or / r/slavsquat . 
  to where the rest of people belongs . 
   they enabled him to become this way . 
  it is their moral responsibility to get rid of him ever since it became apparent what he is . 
  of course , as a nation we bear the burden of responsibility of our leader 's actions . 
  unfortunately , we 'll be lucky if the price we have to pay be less than germans once paid . 
  on the other hand , i ca n't help but mention you have no idea how putin get in charge of russia in the first place . 
  the same goes for arrangements he managed to use to being kept in power . 
  usually knowledge comes before speech , so to say . 
  am i too bitter ? 
  a quarrel followed with a mass fight happened in the cafe `` evgeinia '' , mineralnye vodi , southern russia . 
  as a result of a beating , a local man roman savchenko was injured and taken to hospital by his friends . 
  later on , about 40 men broke into the hospital emergency room and beat up a friend of savchenko , anatoly larionov who happened to be there , [ long yt video : nsfw ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo30hwbe0aa ) , after that larionov has died . 
  in result local people rioted demanding to justice .

  that fact did n't help to settle down the situation as well .

  that means / u/kistoul is n't even trying . 
  there 's 3 +1 options left in russia : - de-facto state-owned channels those have its own news programs or political shows - independent ( usually sat ) channels those have no political news at all - euronews , probably censored or edited last option = online streaming only . 
  if he liked it then why he complained ? 
  he could buy a gift or roses and offered it to the loved one . 
  thanks a lot , now i feel weird discussing such topic . 
  why does it always end up like this when it comes to our * slavic brothers * ? 
  with brothers like us , who needs fucking enemies , amirite ? 
  these so-called `` cossacks '' are just a bunch of clowns . 
  even kids in russia give 'em no respect . 
  for instance , a weird story ~ ~ w ~ ~ has happened in southern russia ( where these cossacks belong ) not so long ago . 
  one cossack owed money to a chechen man and did n't want to hand it back . 
  in exchange of delay in payment a chechen has fucked a poor guy right in his brave ass . 
  cossack told this story to his commander . 
  instead of cutting a muslim dick with a rusted sabre , our brave dudes decided to complain to authorities , and the story went public in the end . 
  the whole runet was giggling and making fun of cossacks for a month or two . 
  so , do n't be a pussy , do n't be afraid of these dudes .

  [ wiki says ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_internet_exchange_points_by_size ) that m9 ranked 5th biggest hub in the world . 
  considering amount of torrent traffic i 'd rather believe it , haha . 
  our illiterate officials have no idea of the way things works . 
  they 're living in 19th century . 
  they do n't know about software updates and maintenance , they have no clue that cutting the internet will mean ` say goodbye to all modern industry , medicine , trade and gas/oil delivery and whatever ' . 
  the ` second most popular language ' in terms of w3 consortium has nothing to do with articles you linked . 
  it 's about a number of pages in the internet written in russian/has cyrillic codepage . 
  that 's it . 
  so , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sejm_ ( disambiguation ) in the west has the same meaning as [ veche ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/veche ) in the east . 
  i 'm guessing that internet censorship in china played its part in the issue . 
  oh , that reminds me how unhappy was my aunt when she was studying latvian :d, 
  thanks a lot !, 
  i had no idea . 
  that pretty much sums it up ... 
  i 'd choose the former . 
   i would have guessed spanish or ** chinese ** . 
  tbh , i thought the same thing . 
  maybe the reason is right here :  russian is also the most used language in several countries that belonged to the soviet union : 79.0 % in ukraine , 86.9 % in belarus , 84.0 % in kazakhstan , 79.6 % in uzbekistan , 75.9 % in kyrgyzstan and 81.8 % in tajikistan . 
  [ link ] ( http://w3techs.com/blog/entry/russian_is_now_the_second_most_used_language_on_the_web ), 
  that 's how communist party members were sitting in russian duma . 
  they got their percent of votes but were barely able to do something due to lack of collaboration with the rest of parliament . 
  maybe , in case of the saeima , there 's also nothing to worry about . 
  i always forget that entry-level games and porn sites are the only reasons of existence of the internet , haha . 
  probably , non-russian parties could make a coalition in saime . 
  no , we ca n't .

  there 's such a good word in finnish : ` my\u00f6t\u00e4h\u00e4pe\u00e4 ' . 
  everytime an english speaker tries to fake a thick russian accent , i get this feeling . 
  moscow . 
  - arrogant , snobby and cunning guys who stole all the money from blue collar workers ; - too many hipsters and lgbt persons , too many owners of expensive apartments , local girls wo n't date you unless you 've got a bmw or the us/eu passport . 
  / s - special gay-ish pronunciation and sarcastic word play often make other people feel linguistically inferior to us . 
  simple-minded peasants deserve that attitude , after all , haha . 
  saint-petersburg . 
  - all the issues mentioned above minus money and pronunciation , so they 're getting less hatred in general . 
  in some cases they would n't even have beaten by angry mob in rural area . 
  smart ones . 
  also , they 've given us lenin and putin and got away with it . 
  i 'm saying about present day 's ties , armenia is not a medieval motherland laying overseas for an average member of said diaspora . 
  of course , i do n't know much about their internal politics , i just want to say that i 've never met anyone from this country who is supporting the opposition to the russian gov ` t. 
  probably , guys who do n't like russia do n't go to russia . 
  or they keep a low profile while being here . 
  quoting the second article :  various figures estimate that the ethnic armenian population in russia is actually more than 5 million . 
  well , knowing a few armenians i doubt they would do something against the will of the regime . 
  anecdotal evidence is irrelevant , of course . 
  assuming it 's happening on a street stage this song is not so bad , haha . 
  if it took place somewhere in the southern region i 'd rather say that guys were serious though . 
  craziness of so-called cossack `` folk culture '' is beyond understanding . 
  i still want to believe they 're playing the fool in the video . 
  there 're more armeninans living in russia than in armenia itself . 
  for instance , armeninan diaspora in moscow exists for centuries . 
  head of beloved on reddit news agency rt is armeninan etc.
