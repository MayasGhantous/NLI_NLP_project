  these are tears of joy . 
   scientists in japan who discovered element 113 have chosen the name nihonium , derived from the name of the country in the local language , and the accompanying symbol nh . 
   russian and us scientists , meanwhile , have proposed ** moscovium ** and mc for element 115 , tennessine and ts for element 117 and oganesson and og for element 118 . ; _ ;, 
  i 'll show myself out . 
   they 'd definitely choose a wealthier country than belarus . 
  except it 's awfully hard to legally immigrate to a western country ( let 's put the whole migrant crisis aside for the time being , as it 's beside the point ) . 
  whereas said belarus could still provide potential migrants with a decent standard of living . 
  migration does n't always have to be ` asylum shopping ' , y' know . 
  some people could afford a plane ticket . 
  by the way , russia has tried to change its relaxed migrant policies as of late . 
  at least , they _ seem _ to want to curb the uncontrolled migration from asia . 
  as for those mythical russian speaking migrants - well , it might be true like 10-15 years ago . 
  most asian migrants i 've talked with in the last years ca n't even string a coherent sentence together . 
  ca n't really speak about ukraine , no idea where the data comes from . 
  however , the active fighting in ukraine is limited to a tiny area in the easternmost part of the country , so i imagine it would n't be affecting the number of migrants .

  perhaps , a number of returnees from russia played its part in statistics . 
  just for example : a ukrainian friend of mine who has lived in moscow for a decade or more was denied re-entry at once and had to marry a moscow girl to get a russian visa back . 
  plus the general attitude towards the ukrainians is currently not as rosy as it used to be . 
  i imagine that the ru-ukr conflict could be a turning point for many of those ukrainians who lived in rufed before . 
  there are a lot of countries much worse than the rus/ukr/bel triad . 
  iirc , russia was ranked among the most popular immigration destinations at some point . 
  all these countries are post-communist hellholes only for a typical western manchild . 
  for the vast majority of people , let 's say , belarus is a dreamland with drinkable tap water , electricity and working transportation . 
  also no land mines and gang rapes every time you go outside . 
  russians seem to be surprisingly calm about poland and the balts . 
  i guess the blame for that should be squarely put on a language barrier . 
  i mean , if they only knew what our western neighbors _ really _ think about the big , bad russia ... gee , that would be a volga river of butt hurt .

  7:2 where is your god now , murica ? 
  not necessarily . 
  by the look of it , the cold war 2.0 is going to be waged mostly on twitter and fb . 
  i mean , a politician making bold statements is peanuts , in terms of finances , 
  i got a 5 years travel ban after getting the 3rd cat secrecy access . 
  truth be told , it happened a long time ago in the 90s so i did n't even notice it - had no money for travelling anyway . 
  ninja edit : on a second thought , that might be a 2nd cat , i do n't remember that clearly . 
  in short , yes , you are . 
  you can speak nato language , that would be enough for them , under certain circumstances .

  according to [ asiarussia.ru ] ( http://asiarussia.ru/news/7667/ ) , which is citing an ` unnamed official ' , ethnic russians make up to 31 % of the total population of moscow .

  `` liberal dictatorship with no election '' = the first ( and the second , to some extent ) term of mr putin in the early 00s . 
  killing off the political life in the country because of his unhealthy focusing on one person does n't sound as a thought out decision to me . 
  as i said before , he seems to think that * this one person * is the root of all evil . 
  which is not true by far . 
   up to 400 people took part in a mass brawl at a moscow cemetery , most of them reportedly migrants , armed with bats , sticks , and metal bars . 
  two people have been killed in the fight , the investigative committee told tass . 
   gunfire was heard at the scene , and witnesses cited by life.ru said there might as many as 12 people killed . 
   police and special forces intervened to deal with the fight , shooting into the air . 
   according to the latest interior ministry data , two people have died and 10 have been injured in the fracas . 
  some 200 people are participating in the fight , which is taking place at the front entrance to the khovanskoe cemetery , officials say . 
  other sources place the number at up to 400 . 
   two people received gunshot wounds , and 13 were hospitalized with other injuries . 
   a criminal investigation has been launched . 
   reports that a police officer was killed while trying to intervene in the fight are now being verified by police officials . 
   fifty people have been detained , according to police , as quoted by tass . 
   weapons have been seized at the scene , security forces added . 
  the conflict has now been contained . 
  the alternative is that they will have all the money stolen by 2020 , just like always :d,

  he once said that russia needs no elections to install a ` liberal dictatorship ' [ after the dearest leader goes away ] and that the opposition should not participate in the coming elections [ coz it would be used to add more ` legitimacy ' to the existing regime ] . 
  he looks like a political freak to me . 
  i just ca n't shake that feeling . 
   the three top editors left billionaire mikhail prokhorov 's rbc media group , whose flagship newspaper , one of the last independent dailies , has published investigative reports into president vladimir putin 's daughter and son-in-law . 
   elizaveta osetinskaya , editor-in-chief of the rbc media group , maxim solyus , editor of the rbc newspaper , and roman badanin , editor of the rbc newswire , have all stepped down , the company said on its website on friday . 
  osetinskaya declined to comment on her facebook page . 
   russian police earlier this week said they 'd opened a fraud case involving a company formerly owned by rbc . 
  this followed raids last month of offices of prokhorov 's onexim holding company and other businesses . 
  law-enforcement agencies found some tax violations concerning a bank that onexim said occurred before the group had acquired it . 
  not gon na happen . 
  kasparov 's lost his marbles and now falls victim of his own obsession with the regime . 
  which does n't mean shit , in the grand scheme of things . 
  #recep tayyip erdogan seeks limitless power ## the turkish president has wilfully cut himself off from any free flow of critical information * may 11 , 2016 by : david gardner * president recep tayyip erdogan last week pushed out ahmet davutoglu , the prime minister he himself had handpicked , seemingly to clear his way towards the untrammelled one-man rule he has sought since he moved from the premiership to turkey 's presidency two years ago . 
  conventional wisdom says mr erdogan is surrounding himself with loyalists . 
  but the man he has just defenestrated is a loyalist . 
  he joins a long list of those jettisoned from the president 's inner circle over the past two years , in a processional purge that is starting to look like standard political procedure . 
  the ruling justice and development party ( akp ) , a conservative coalition with roots in political islam , came to power in 2002 as cautious and wary outsiders . 
  they scarcely had a toehold in a secular state built by mustafa kemal ataturk from the rubble of the ottoman empire . 
  initially , they relied on the shadowy islamist movement headed by fethullah gulen , a us-based imam , which over three decades had inserted its cadres into the judiciary , the police and then the intelligence services . 
  over time , and swept forward by mr erdogan 's electoral triumphs , the new akp establishment supplanted the old secular elites . 
  with the help of the gulenists , and by fair means or foul , it elbowed aside generals and judges who , as late as 2008 , were trying to get the akp banned . 
  all this helps explain why , even now , the akp often behaves more like an opposition than turkey 's paramount party . 
  this paranoia grew exponentially after the mid-2013 demonstrations nationwide against mr erdogan 's intrusive and increasingly authoritarian rule . 
  after the gulen network launched corruption probes into the erdogan inner circle later that year , the then prime minister treated the crisis as existential , shutting down the investigation and launching a purge of gulenists that continues today . 
  it is also something of a paradox that mr erdogan has cocooned himself among courtiers . 
  he had , after all , created a genuine mass movement , widely seen at the time as a muslim analogue to european-style christian democracy . 
  before first winning power in october 2002 , the akp spent 22 months interviewing in depth 42,000 people across the country . 
  by 2013 , it became clear that the feedback loop of this well-oiled political machine had been short-circuited by sycophants . 
  mr erdogan evidently feels more comfortable surrounded by ciphers . 
  at the time of the 2013 turmoil , abdullah gul , then president , a co-founder of the akp and a more emollient foil to mr erdogan 's abrasive personality , assured turks that `` the messages with good intentions [ from the protests ] were received '' .
