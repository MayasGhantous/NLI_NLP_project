  mr erdogan growled : `` what message ? '' the popular mr gul was an immediate casualty . 
  after mr erdogan was elected president , he scheduled the akp congress to elect his successor as party leader and premier just before mr gul left office -- disqualifying him constitutionally as a runner because he was still in the presidency , a non-partisan , largely ceremonial post before mr erdogan took it . 
  other loyalists followed mr gul into political limbo : bulent arinc , the third co-founder of the akp ; huseyin celik , mr erdogan 's party deputy and propagandist ; as well as economic tsar ali babacan . 
  and now mr davutoglu . 
  various behind-closed-door differences have been adduced by turkish analysts to explain the prime minister 's fall . 
  the president and his premier disagreed on : the independence of the central bank and state guarantees for favoured contractors ; negotiations with kurdish insurgents and the jailing of journalists and academics ; the deal mr davutoglu struck with the eu on syrian refugees ; and so on . 
  but one reason counts above all , signalled for weeks by the `` erdoganist '' faction that is replacing the old guard loyalists : as mr erdogan moves towards an all-powerful executive presidency , there is no room for a rival centre of power , however flimsy . 
  what is remarkable , though , is the manner in which mr erdogan 's former comrades have all gone with scarcely a murmur , indeed singing the praises of the leader . 
  sealed off in his neo-ottoman palace in ankara , four times the size of versailles , and wilfully cut off from any free flow of critical information or pushback , it is hardly surprising he feels no limits to his power . 
  akp barons such as mr celik used to complain that the kemalist elite behaved as landlords of the state , treating the elected government as their highly evictable tenants . 
  now that president erdogan behaves as the landowner of the country with almost patrimonial entitlement , it seems they have nothing to say at all . 
  the activist ( ? ), 
  was released from a psycho clinic today . 
  a district court in voronezh has ruled that the dude 's detainment was illegal ( [ link1 ] ( https://riavrn.ru/news/voronezhskiy-sud-osvobodil-iz-psikhbolnitsy-oppozitsionera-dmitriya-vorobevskogo-/ ) , [ link2 ] ( http://www.svoboda.org/content/article/27730761.html ) ) and now the whole incident is to be [ examined by the investigation committee ] ( http://echo.msk.ru/news/1763458-echo.html ) . 
  if we take the number of losses , ethnic russians made up [ 66.4 pct ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9f%d0%be%d1%82%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b8_%d0%b2_%d0%92%d0%b5%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%b9_%d0%9e%d1%82%d0%b5%d1%87%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b9_%d0%b2%d0%be%d0%b9%d0%bd%d0%b5 ) of the total ** army ** loss of the ussr . 
  ukrainians were the second with 15.9 % . 
  which is [ almost consistent ] ( http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/pyhalov/31027164/76004/76004_original.jpg ) with the ethnic composition of the ussr . 
   has to import 70 % incorrect . 
  the actual average in 2015 was [ 28 % ] ( https://www.fedstat.ru/indicator/37164.do ) . 
  plus rufed is a # 5 wheat exporter in the world ( [ 10.1 % ] ( http://www.worldstopexports.com/wheat-exports-country/ ) of total wheat exports ) .

  one of the protesters ( can be seen at 1:45 ) was showing a russian passport while speaking against the dearest leader . 
  what 's your opinion on his options in case of a sudden liberation ? 
  unlike the sheltered westerners cracking jokes on reddit , he is the one with balls who is taking the real risk of getting into trouble . 
  the guy would get a warm welcome on / r/europe , 
  no idea . 
  i do n't think it really matters now . 
  after all , it was not a competition , was n't it ? 
  for the record : of all nations , i admire the german one the most . 
  i wish we could be like that . 
  their ability to acknowledge the past mistakes is a rara avis in this ugly world . 
  everyone ( who wants to ) knows about the war crimes committed by the red army . 
  it 's not a secret anymore , since it 's been put on wikipedia and covered by the ` opposition ' media . 
  most people just do n't give a flying one about it . 
  the common attitude is something along the lines : ` they had it coming ' . 
  your point being exactly ? 
  what , americans did n't rape as much as the soviets did ? 
  well , 70 % of the us were n't in ruins back then . 
  hence the difference . 
  yes , that all was the terrible , brutal revenge of the soviets - i 'm not gon na sweat it . 
  granted , some kind of acknowledgement of the war crimes * would be * nice , but i wo n't hold my breath waiting for the common russians to change their mind about it . 
  there 's such a huge stigma over the soviet losses in the ww2 . 
  this is n't going anywhere soon . 
   but not at the scale soviet soldiers did it : mass rapes and kills of women and children - thousands of them . 
  < ...  by contrast thousands of soviet female nurses , doctors and field medics fell victim to rape when captured , and were often murdered afterwards . 
  [ 37 ] german soldiers used to brand the bodies of captured partisan women -- and other women as well -- with the words `` whore for hitler 's troops '' and rape them . 
  [ 73 ] following their capture some german soldiers vividly bragged about committing rape and rape-homicide . 
  [ 74 ] in the soviet union alone an estimates regarding the rape of soviet women by the wehrmacht range up to ** 10,000,000 incidents ** , with between 750,000 and 1,000,000 children being born as a result . 
  [ [ wiki ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_crimes_of_the_wehrmacht#rapes_2 ) . 
   but slowly becoming mainstream far from that . 
  if one out of every few hundred cars has been covered with tacky stickers - so what ? 
  do you realise that from 2 to 3 pct of the total population are actually [ retarded ] ( http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0215/p1059.html ) ? 
  yeah , over the few last days i 've seen quite a lot cars with st. george ribbons ; and yes , _ personally _ i think this is not the best way to commemorate the victory day . 
  still , people have the right to do as they like . 
  for instance , in many families , there 's a tradition to dye eggs on easter . 
  which does n't make all of them devout christians , right ? 
  it 's just freaking dyed eggs . 
  * edit : fucked up the grammar . 
  percentage wise , belarus is the one who suffered the most in the ww2 , as [ 25 % of the population ] ( http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/53874410eab8ea7e59b36468-800-/wwii-losses.png ) were exterminated . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  the world is taking a sharp turn to the right . 
  that 's some scary shit , if you ask me . 
  sadly , this dude at 1:45 saying that * russian citizens are against putin * while showing his passport may not get away with it . 
  that was brave , i 'll give him that , but stupid nonetheless . 
  he can be arrested on return to rufed . 
  you mean , that saudi arabia which is [ committing war crimes in yemen ] ( http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/25/civilian-casualties-war-crimes-saudi-arabia-yemen-war/ ) as we speak ? 
   * how can the united states , britain , and france keep shipping riyadh arms when its pilots are dropping bombs on innocent civilians ? 
  * ...  attacks like the one on khamees market have become the norm for civilians in yemen . 
  more than 3,000 civilians have been killed during the conflict , according to the united nations . 
  thousands of others have been injured , more than 2.5 million have been displaced , and 83 percent of yemenis are reliant on humanitarian assistance . 
  there is barely a single corner of yemen or a single soul that has n't in some way been touched and scarred by this war . 
  samsat-218 is a tiny 2 kg experimental satellite made by [ these students ] ( http://www.uznayvse.ru/images/stories2016/uzn_1462379484.jpg ) . 
  [ [ link in russian ] ] ( http://zelenyikot.livejournal.com/94190.html ) . 
  both `` real '' million-dollar satellites seem to be launched properly . 
  i can relate to that . 
  we do n't give a damn about zika , since our brains have been permanently damaged by a fetal alcohol syndrome . 
  knock it off , personal attacks and shitposting wo n't be tolerated here . 
  take it as a warning . 
  i was just making a guess  of course , i do n't know for sure what their circumstances are . 
  `` groups '' is a key word here . 
  the chechens , as an `` officially '' persecuted ethnic minority , usually have solid chances to get asylum , at least , in europe . 
  which is not the case for the russian citizens in general . 
  no , there are no `` plenty of reasons '' . 
  it 's not enough to say `` hello , i 'm a gay person / political activist from russia '' to get asylum . 
  you 'll need to prove that your life is being in immediate danger . 
  as as i already said somewhere in this thread , from the _ legal _ standpoint of the western authorities , russia is widely regarded as a safe country , with one exception of chechnya . 
  ethnic russians have little to no legal basis to seek asylum in europe . 
  despite all the blabbering in the western mass media , so far no int ' l organisation has deemed russia `` unsafe '' so that russian citizens , except for chechens , could have any real chances to apply for asylum elsewhere . 
  this is not how it works in rufed . 
  not all countries are the same . 
  no one in their right mind would call a chechen `` russian '' here , and vice versa . 
  it 's just as wrong as referring to an irishman as to a briton . 
  dodged a bullet this time !, 
  that 's true . 
  ugh , over of the last three years , the vast majority of comment sections of russian websites have been completely ruined by the never ending battle between pro-west and pro-russian bots / paid shills . 
  you have n't heard about it because it would 've gone against the western narrative . 
  do n't take my word for it ; come to any russian news media ( such as lenta.ru or gazeta.ru , to name a few ) and see it for yourself .
