    how much ** sympathy ** did the shooting down of \\ ^ the comment i was replying to . 
  i do n't remember whether the official reaction was empathetic or not but , for what it 's worth , [ here ] ( http://cdn.tvc.ru/pictures/o/115/178.jpg ) is a picture of the front door of the netherlands embassy in moscow . 
   in her review `` mustering most memorable quips '' of konstantin dushenko 's 1997 dictionary of modern quotations ( \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044c \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0446\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442 : 4300 \u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0447\u0438\u0445 \u0446\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0425\u0425 \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430 , \u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 , \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b , \u0434\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 ) , julia solovyova states : `` russian historians have no record of the lines , ` death of one man is a tragedy . 
  death of a million is a statistic , ' commonly attributed by english-language dictionaries to josef stalin . '', 
  western sanctions that do actual harm to the economy are sectoral . 
  targeting a few token oligarchs has had little to no effect in the grand scheme of things , even though it makes a nice gesture . 
   russia is in a parlous state . 
  real incomes have fallen by 10 per cent in just a year . 
  the rouble depreciated 37 per cent and in real terms gross domestic product fell 3.7 per cent , according to world bank figures . 
  the 10 % fall in incomes is hardly a tragedy . 
   twenty years ago , a small group of russian businessmen saved the country from a return to communism . 
  boris yeltsin , physically and politically weak , was close to being beaten in the presidential election by gennady zyuganov . 
  oh , it 's wrong on so many levels . 
  so , i take it the author sees nothing wrong in bending the rules by manipulating the public opinion when it suits a particular political agenda ? 
  in 1993 , yeltsin shelled his own parliament , but it was okay since he was a pro-western guy . 
  in 1996 , lesin called his american friends to come to the rescue of the young russian democracy , but it was okay , because muh communists at the gates . 
  in 1999 , yeltsin ( or rather the family ) singlehandedly installed a successor while bypassing a normal electoral process , but it was okay because fuck democracy at that point . 
  it 's called a slippery slope . 
  now everyone is losing their shit about the rise of the dearest leader ... yeah , sure , nobody had that coming . 
  i beg to differ . 
  different cultures treat homosexuals differently . 
  i mean , it 's kinda sad and all but that 's just the way it is . 
  muslim republics is a legacy of the russian empire . 
  however , the status quo is not written in stone , if you know what i mean . 
  false analogy . 
  being a devoted muslim is not a crime . 
  it 's only safe if you have local friends who can provide an accommodation and guidance to you . 
  which is also somewhat true for the rest of north caucasus , save for the black sea coastline . 
  it would be inhumane to jail people for being themselves . 
  on a side note , gulag ceased to exist a long time ago . 
  russians have no authority in chechnya . 
  basically , this is a huge no-go zone which is ruled by sharia and local warlords . 
  please , use the '' **np**.reddit.com '' format for links . 
  the ruling elite is so far detached from reality that it does n't seem to care at all . 
  they are simply too arrogant to pay attention to what _ bydlo _ thinks . 
  except nobody significant in moscow has had any problems with tatars , bashkirs or yakuts for a long time . 
  let 's not pretend that nationalistic rhetoric of the likes of navalny was ever aimed at russia 's ethnic minorities in general . 
   his ethnonationalistic views would be pretty much compatible with that of the vast majority of the population . 
  you guys are really grasping at straws now , while trying to present his random blogging crap from ten years ago as an actual political platform . 
  and , by the way . 
  go ahead and tell me that we ethnic russians are actually internationalists somewhere deep inside and that we really love to see around all these millions upon millions of imported muslims from all over northern asia and n caucasus - i need a good laugh today , haha . 
  the nationalistic agenda navalny used to push in the past still sounds really appealing to many , many people here . 
  `` people from youtube comments '' are either retards or edgy kids , simply by definition . 
  the problem is that the police lost its reputation a long time ago and they have nobody but themselves to blame for it . 
  yea , it would be nice but it 's not gon na happen . 
  if history is anything to go by , the u.s. are always in the need of an external enemy . 
  it seems like americans ca n't function without it . 
  not that russia is any different in that regard , though . 
  the enemy has always to be at the gates . 
   some idiot you misspelled ` an agent provocateur ' . 
  up to [ 100 russian cities ] ( https://vk.com/wall-55284725_272730 ) were set to participate in the protests : [ [ meduza twitter feed 1 ] ] ( https://meduza.io/feature/2017/03/26/antipravitelstvennye-aktsii-po-vsey-rossii-novosibirsk-ekaterinburg-irkutsk-vladivostok-i-drugie-goroda ) the protests ( non-sanctioned ) in moscow are to kick off right now : [ [ meduza twitter feed 2 ] ] ( https://meduza.io/live/2017/03/26/aktsii-protiv-korruptsii-po-vsey-rossii-hronika ) [ [ official live stream on yt ] ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2fhmpohmiq ) [ [ navalny live twitter ] ] ( https://twitter.com/navalnylive ) by the looks of it , this is going to be the most massive protest in rufed since 2011 . 
  switching off my phone now , coz i do n't want it tracked  its been long since the last time i saw so many cops and police vans around pushkinskaya metro station . 
   you 're basically living in ussr 2.0 as someone who lived in the ussr , i must say that this is a ridiculous statement . 
  day-to-day life in the ussr was objectively worse in every possible way . 
   putin 's power was beneficial for them until now that 's the point though . 
  he was a communist mp and a thief . 
  the mere fact that it 's usually people like you  we should have nuked russia from this earth [ [ link ] ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5yu07y/us_secretary_of_defense_william_perry_left/det26tg/ ) who tend to advocate for a regime change in rufed is a great argument _ against _ the regime change . 
  kremlin 's ban on the import of vegetables from turkey is still in place so it 's no wonder that turkey is showing its impatience and doing some arm-twisting in the meantime . 
  the recent gdp slump perhaps ? 
  did someone say ` divide europe ' ? 
  yeah , the two things you should always carry in your backpack ... / s,

  * just in case it 's behind a paywall : * -- this time two years ago , the united kingdom stood on the brink of dissolution . 
  the referendum on scottish independence hung in the balance and momentum was with the nationalists . 
  the optimism and energy of alex salmond 's campaign stood in admirable contrast to the shrill hysteria of project fear , the name given to a unionist campaign that churned out ever-less-credible warnings about what would happen after separation . 
  the union was saved , but 45 per cent of scots had voted to leave it . 
  so the referendum had not closed the question , but left it wide open . 
  at the time , the north sea oil sector was still in fairly good health . 
  in the snp 's economic manifesto for independence , it gave estimates of up to # 7.9 billion a year for oil revenues . 
  then the oil price crashed -- and oil revenues are now 99 per cent lower , at # 60 million . 
  this is no freak : america has mastered fracking and does n't need to import so much oil now , pushing the price of a barrel down from $ 110 to $ 45 . 
  this has n't hurt the uk economy because the stimulus from cheaper fuel generally balances out lower north sea receipts . 
  a country of 65 million can absorb such shocks . 
  a separate scotland simply could not . 
  had the snp achieved its stated ambition of ` independence day ' in the spring of 2016 , what would it be doing now ? 
  we do n't have to imagine . 
  this week , the scottish government published figures for its national finances . 
  they show that the scottish government spends # 127 for every # 100 it raises in tax -- a ratio unequalled anywhere else in the developed world . 
  it can do this because so much extra money is sent up from england . 
  for every # 100 spent per english head , # 120 is spent on a scottish one . 
  greece , italy , albania -- no country , no matter how economically distressed , has such a mismatch between state spending and tax collected . 
  scotland 's deficit -- at 10.1 per cent of gdp -- is now twice as big as the next-worst country ( japan ) . 
  no independent country could afford to run a deficit of scottish magnitude : to borrow on world markets , you need a semblance of fiscal respectability . 
  even to join the european union , scotland 's deficit would need to be below 3 per cent . 
  so an independent scotland would right now be facing a choice : state spending down by 15 per cent , taxes up by 19 per cent , or a combination of the two . 
  [ chart ] ( http://imgur.com/a/jxsbs ) the cuts are certainly doable . 
  the scottish government machine is vast , and at times the whole enterprise looks like an attempt to recreate east germany . 
  nicola sturgeon could certainly propose a rapid slimming down of government , and say that this is a price worth paying for secession . 
  but as her own government figures now make clear , she could not pretend that an independent scotland could sustain current levels of largesse . 
  she can forget about free university tuition and free personal care for the elderly . 
  the snp 's case for separation has always rested on three pillars : that the black gold in the north sea would transform the economy , that scotland 's priorities are irreconcilably different from those of england , and that scottish government always means better government . 
  each of these three pillars has now collapsed . 
  the north sea dream has ended : jobs and expertise have already shifted to the caspian sea and the gulf of mexico . 
  as to the second pillar , the british social attitudes survey , the largest of its kind , shows scots growing ever closer to the english in their outlook to politics , culture and society . 
  and better government ? 
  the snp has now had nine years to prove its theory that decisions taken by officials in edinburgh are better when it comes to schools , hospitals , transport and the environment . 
  but even nicola sturgeon can not claim that the nhs is better in scotland than in england . 
  or that scotland 's state education system is more progressive than england 's . 
  on the contrary , a poor scottish teenager is now half as likely to get into university as a poor english one .
