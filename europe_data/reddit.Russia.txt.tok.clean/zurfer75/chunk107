  what 's wrong with that statement ? 
  unless you believe that lukashenko 's socialistic `` paradise '' has been self-sustaining since the fall of the ussr . 
  the `` money in exchange for loyalty '' program clearly does n't work as intended . 
  let them go their own way to moldova 2.0 , for all i care . 
  no , i meant cut off bat ` ka and his cronies . 
  by the way , whining about `` moscow stealing our monies '' is a dead giveaway of a provincial person who has no clue about how the economy works . 
  one can hope that 's not yet another fake news . 
  it 's time to cut off the freeloaders who 've been sucking our money for more than 25 years now . 
   a senior new york city official briefed by the medical examiner 's office says russia 's ambassador to the united nations died last month from a heart attack and no foul play was suspected . 
  [ the latest : official says russian envoy died of heart attack | ap ] ( https://www.apnews.com/1320c69ced004e3694420242436fdb41/the-latest:-official-says-russian-envoy-died-of-heart-attack ), 
  220 years since the death of ekaterina ii , so yeah , it 's kinda correct . 
   sanctions would end oh boy . 
  the western sanctions are n't going to be removed in our lifetime , a regime 's change or not . 
  most russians would n't even notice that , since they tend to use homegrown alternatives , such as ok , vk and mail.ru instead of facebook/gmail . 
  also , it 's always fun to see how you enlightened and democratic europeans are gang-ho about authoritarian measures when it comes to the unwashed masses , but sanctioning any of the russian oligarchs who openly keep their money and families in the west is a big no no . 
  'cause they bring money to your economies , that 's why . 
  maybe we are not that different after all , with all these plebeian knee-jerk reactions to the powerful and wealthy . 
  well , my great-grandma lived through two world wars , two revolutions , czarism , war-time communism , stalin 's purges , khrushchev 's spring and the late socialism of the 1980s , all while residing in the same apartments . 
  and died at the age of 103 ( or rather at 105 , because she most likely forged her papers in 1918 so that she could be a bit `` younger '' , haha ) . 
  people put too much importance on politics . 
   200,000 rubles in 1995 the ruble was redenominated on 1 january 1998 , with 1 rub equaling 1,000 rur . 
  [ [ wiki ] ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/monetary_reform_in_russia,_1998 ) , so this sum of money could be just 200 rub in today 's rubles . 
  the current utility fees , food and medication prices are beyond comparison with that of the ussr . 
  it 's pointless to talk about how it would be . 
  realistically , most pensioners _ were _ better off in the ussr . 
  as of now , the average pension is barely enough to cover the basic needs . 
  that 's the reality . 
  simply put , a lot of people , especially retirees and state employees , would have been better off in the ussr . 
  now , they 're facing poverty with no relief in sight . 
  we have 42 millions of pensioners , and on top of that , roughly a half of the working population are being employed by the state . 
  do the math , 
  `` the others '' are likely creatures of your own sub-consciousness , however , there may be other opinions in that regard  i do n't insist on that , though . 
  i used to use the following technique : p1 , a preparation : you 'll need lay down and flex and then relax your limbs muscles ( without moving said limbs ) starting with your legs , going up from a heel to a buttock , then arms , going from a hand to a shoulder , then abdominals , chest muscles ( no idea how it 's called in english ) , finishing at your neck . 
  rinse and repeat until your body gets fully relaxed . 
  p2 , the hardest part : you 'll need to cross your eyes as if you tried to look at the bridge of your nose and then * roll your crossed eyes up into your forehead * , as if you tried to look at your `` third eyes '' from inside of your head . 
  by the way , it hurts , but you have to overcome this pain , keep your eyes crossed & rolled up and put all of your attention into the process . 
  very soon you 'll start seeing colour spots , flashes and other crap like that and eventually get into a self-inflicted trance state of mind . 
  do n't forget to breathe deeply , almost as deep as during holotropic breathwork . 
  p3 , enjoy the other world ^ tm , be as bad and perverted as possible , it 's , like , a necessary step . 
  once you explored your own perverted and violent nature ( that may take more than one night/session , obviously ) , you may want to explore the dream world and , perhaps , eventually meet the others . 
  having said that , do n't take these last words as an advice , 
  these things are not mutually exclusive . 
  that 's why there are still a lot of people who see him as he is - a brutal dictator . 
  nice backpedalling , man . 
  twisting facts to fit your agenda is always wrong . 
  as for stalin , he likely gets credit for not losing in ww2 . 
  i 'd wager that in 20 years from now he will be seen more positively . 
  rufed is a feminine country at its core , such a brutal guy with a moustache will never fall from grace here , haha . 
  on a more serious note , peter i , for example , was even more ruthless , yet we have a lot of monuments dedicated to him . 
   a total of 46 percent of russians expressed ** some kind of positive view of stalin in levada 's poll ** vs  ** worshipping ** stalin ok . 
  how the hell is usakov 's corrupt ass related to the topic ? 
   the parliamentary faction of the ruling national alliance will soon propose legislative amendments to have public and municipal officials suspended upon repeated violations of ** the rules concerning the use of the state language ** , the latvijas avize daily report on friday . 
  if he is corrupt , bring him to trial . 
  you 've just reinforced my point . 
  `` dangerous ethnicities '' , my ass . 
  except the implication that members of a certain ethnic group are more prone to be traitors to their host country just because of their ethnicity is , in fact , utterly racist , no matter how you spin it . 
  comes as no surprise that you westerners do n't hesitate to put your prejudice on public display . 
  structural bigotry towards the russians , which is deeply ingrained into the western mindset , has always been socially acceptable not to say openly encouraged in your culture . 
  i would n't hold my breath waiting for a `` good guy '' here . 
  such a guy is not coming . 
  i 'm not a big fan of cultural relativism either , but it 's stupid to expect the sudden appearance of a western-type centrist/leftist in russia . 
  the whole country is kinda right wing , jingoistic and violent . 
  navalny is a bit like that dutch dude , geert wilders , in sense that he wants to curb the uncontrolled muslim immigration , but otherwise he is as pro-western as you can get . 
  he is , though . 
  you should n't take wiki as gospel . 
  granted , somewhere in western europe he would be considered `` a far right nationalist '' , but for rufed , he is a very , _ very _ moderate guy , considering the alternatives . 
  and rightly so . 
  in response to numerous requests from the working people , this thread was marked as not safe for work . 
  hooray , comrades !, 
  no unmarked/unannounced gore videos here , please . 
  corrupt officials pose a direct and immediate threat to our country 's sovereignty . 
  here 's why : they keep their money in the west . 
  their families live in the west . 
  therefore , said west efficiently has them by the balls , which makes all of them potential or more likely actual agents of the foreign influence if not straight-out traitors to the russian people . 
  uncle joe would execute people for less , mind you . 
  could you please remind me , what was at stake , exactly ? 
  some corgis ' wellbeing ? 
  it 's baffling how good you guys are at defending of someone who openly spits in your face . 
  on the other hand , every nation deserves its rulers . 
  if i believed in all that spiritual crap , i would say `` karma is a bitch '' . 
  actually , i was there today . 
  and yeah , i 'm bitter about what i 've seen . 
  according to the organizers counter , ~ 15k people have shown up today for the march . 
  a lot of old farts , hipsters and intelligentcia ( or am i being redundant by mentioning this ? ), 
  the weather was surprisingly nice though . 
  looks ghetto as fuck . 
  and depressing . 
  the worst thing is that the neighborhood is not going to look any better for years to come . 
  you 're still forgetting about the time factor . 
  renovating such a huge amount of the housing stock in moscow will likely take decades . 
  in fact , it still works . 
  possible profits could be a tad lower but it 's not like that the construction business as a whole would become a charity , all of a sudden . 
  the neighborhood i live in now was fully made of 5-storey commie blocks as recently as 15 years ago , now it looks much , much better but the average apartment here is still nowhere near to be affordable for the vast majority of potential buyers . 
  itt : clueless westerners with a hard on for the god emperor , mwahaha . 
  the process of renovation has been going on for more than twenty years now and it has nothing to do with `` misusing public funds '' , whatever it is supposed to mean . 
  here 's how it is done : 1 . get a loan big enough to buy new apartments for 80 or so families 1 . move all the tenants to the newly bought apartments within the same district/okrug 2 . demolish an old 5-storey building and put a new 17-storey into its spot 3 . sell the newly built apartments for a gazillion of dollars 4 . pay back the loan , buy a yacht and a cool mansion in miami 5 . rinse and repeat , if you feel that your new mansion is not cool enough . 
  you think of [ lada largus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lada_largus ) . 
  [ vesta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lada_vesta ) is a newer gen car . 
  wholeheartedly agree with the entirety of your post . 
  or , you are an 18 or older yo guy _ with _ a passport who still can be randomly detained at one of the checkpoints and then drafted into the ukrainian military service ...
