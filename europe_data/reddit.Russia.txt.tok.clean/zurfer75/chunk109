  take , for example , the post-crimea german move to cut off the supply of diesel ship engines to the russian navy . 
  the cancellation promised to scuttle a critical part of the modernization of the russian fleet , as several new buyan-m corvettes were sitting in russian shipyards , waiting for their german-made engines . 
  the kremlin found another supplier soon enough . 
  several years before , berlin had sold some of the same engines to china , which the chinese quickly duplicated in their own factories . 
  russian officials booked flights to beijing where they struck a deal to buy the cheaper chinese knock-offs , which while not as good as their german predecessors , were decent enough to get the russian ships out of their drydocks . 
  in a related move , moscow sold three other frigates waiting on now-banned ukrainian-made diesel engines to india , recouping their initial investment . 
  and when it comes to some of the critical electronic components russia had traditionally purchased from the west for its space and missile industries , moscow has looked to south korea and other southeast asian nations that never went along with the western sanctions . 
  if some of the sanctions currently in place are lifted by the incoming trump administration , as the president-elect has hinted he may do in an effort to reach a broader deal with russian president vladimir putin , the break from the european defense industry may already have become permanent . 
  `` i do n't think the russians are going to rush back to buy these things , '' said michael kofman , a research scientist at cna corp. `` they learned their lesson , they not going to go back to german and french companies . '' the defense official said that the russians have been biding their time since the sanctions came down , and putin is likely calculating that under the trump administration -- and after the upcoming french and german elections where some pro-russian parties have gained momentum -- the penalties can go away . 
  `` so he hunkered down to ride out the storm . '' while continuing the buildup of the russian military , moscow has also been showing off the capabilities it has built up in recent years . 
  late last year , moscow managed to deploy its aircraft carrier , the admiral kuznetsov , on its first combat deployment . 
  stationed off the coast of syria last last year , the ship 's aircraft flew sorties to hit targets in syria for several weeks , with a checkered record : two warplanes crashed into the sea after being unable to land on the ship due to mechanical failures . 
  over the weekend , moscow also announced a 50-year basing agreement with syria that will allow the russian navy to dock more and larger ships at the tartus port , which will give the country the ability to conduct longer operations away from their baltic and black sea homeports , extending moscow 's reach in the middle east . 
  even with the russian workarounds , the official insisted that the equipment moscow is buying elsewhere is n't as high quality as european-made technologies , and `` the sanctions have had an effect because we 've restricted sensitive technologies that have affected russia 's development of next-generation military technologies . '' but the work continues with newly russian-made or chinese-sourced material that might not be up to nato standards , yet remains lethal , and effective for the missions moscow is undertaking . 
  case in point is the russian intervention in syria -- undertaken well after the sanctions were put in place -- which has by all accounts met its objectives of keeping the regime of bashar al-assad in power , and showing off russian capabilities . 
  on monday , six russian tupolev tu-22 strategic bombers hit what the kremlin said were islamic state positions in deir ezzor , syria , after taking off from russian territory and flying over iran and iraq to reach their targets . 
  and earlier this month , the russian defense ministry announced that it was refitting five udaloy-class anti-submarine ships with new electronic weapons systems , all of which would be made domestically . 
  still , moscow has been receiving some help from european countries not on board with the sanctions . 
  italian company iveco continues to supply its lynx light armored vehicles to the russian army , which has since deployed them to syria . 
  other arms-related deals remain in place . 
  the ukrainian engine make motor sich , still sells hundreds of helicopter engines to moscow a year , unable to break its dependency on one of its largest clients . 
  having seen the writing on the wall , however , russia has been slowly building up its own a capacity to eventually replace motor sich , and kofman says that in a few years moscow might have the ability to make its own engines without having to look outside its borders . 
  look more closely at the website you 've quoted from . 
   the kremlin said it was too early to comment on his nuclear-sanctions proposal . 
  ok , that 's exactly what peskov [ said today ] ( https://lenta.ru/news/2017/01/16/nuclear_deal/ ) . 
  good reporting , sky ne ...  russia says it agrees with donald trump 's comment that the nato military alliance is `` obsolete '' . 
  ... aand here we go again . 
  who said that ? 
  ca n't find any official comments concerning nato . 
  sometimes i wonder if it 's no longer possible for the msm to not pull disinfo out of its collective ass . 
  no clickbait headline , no clicks . 
  it 's not a secret that many ` spiritual gurus ' in russia are hoaxers seeking either to get laid ( because tantric sex opens a third eye , that 's for sure ) or to collect ` donations ' from their brainwashed followers . 
  i 've read somewhere that the guru in question was arrested at request of a husband of one of his students ( followers ? ) . 
  make what you want from it , but in my opinion , the underlying reason of why he was charged might be more mundane , 
  personally , i do n't see any problems with the counter-terrorism law itself . 
  it 's law enforcement that can be misguided , heavy-handed or plain abused . 
  i think it 's obvious for everyone that the latest anti-terror laws were n't purposely aimed at the followers of krishnaism . 
  the problem is that they ca n't outright ban radical islamic preachers because you 'll need to draw the line somewhere . 
  in case of islam , nobody 's figured out how to handle this . 
  hence the vague definition of ` illegal religious activities ' which can be basically anything remotely religious preached outside officially approved ( and watched ) churches/mosques . 
  the dude was n't accused of terrorism though . 
  he is facing a fine for conducting illegal missionary activities . 
  it is not ` acceptable ' to generalise . 
  i think the initial minimal investment should n't be more than $ 50 . 
  [ siberia delivers ] ( http://sibsamogon.ru/katalog/samogonovarenie/oborudovanie_dlya_krepkogo_alkogolya/samogonnie-apparati/ ) , literally the first link in google . 
  the beatings will continue until morale improves . 
  nice analogy but this is not the point of the article/quote . 
  it 's not arguing about whether the hacker attack was real or not . 
  it 's about the us publishing an official report that contains random crap instead of an actual evidence and why it makes no sense for anyone familiar with it . 
   first reported by the intercept on wednesday , nearly half of the 876 `` suspicious '' ip addresses identified by dhs ( roughly 42 percent ) are currently tor exit nodes or have been tor exit nodes in the past few years . 
  up to 367 ip addresses listed alongside the government report on russian malicious cyber activity may have been used , or may be presently in use , by thousands of internet users who have no ties to moscow , the dnc hack , or any kind of malicious cyber activity . 
  i would n't be surprised a bit if the headline were saying something along the lines of ` the last young man in a russian village ' . 
  sometimes moving somewhere else is the only way to get a job and a perspective in one 's life . 
  the last orthodox christmas night ( on jan 7 ) in moscow was the coldest in [ 120 years ] ( https://lenta.ru/news/2017/01/07/holodno/ ) ( -29.9 c in moscow proper and -33.4 c in the countryside ) . 
  the last night was as cold as -36 c. 
  cool story , bro :d, 
  at least some of the aforementioned websites are , indeed , banned . 
  yeah , it 's kinda telling that while 9/11 truthers always get ridiculed , litvinenko 's `` revelation '' has been pretty much taken as gospel since its inception . 
  even though i would not be surprised if both tragedies were an inside job , i do n't see why such a shaky theory has to be presented as a matter of fact . 
  you forgot to mention the banking sector , oil and gas r & d , and military industry .

  i have no idea how to prove the absence of dugin 's books in the russian military curriculum . 
   this book is now standard lecture in russian military academies . 
  no , it 's not . 
  dugin is a former member of nbp and it 's unlikely that his teachings could be allowed anywhere near the army . 
  either way , there is no push for having the process fixed . 
  traditional media is slowly dying out and one day it will go extinct . 
  a social media news ` message ' tends to be a veiled bit of advertising so it can not be non-partisan by definition . 
  i would go with public flogging , 
  at first i thought you were joking . 
  [ smh ] ( http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/53678 ) . 
  the whole ` fake news ' narrative does n't necessarily assume the presence of a huge conspiracy behind it . 
  if anything , i 'd put the blame on the ` money in exchange for clicks '' business model , which turns out to be detrimental for journalistic integrity and can only lead to further decline in the quality of media reporting . 
  [ russia : west spreads ` fake news ' about american school closure ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/russia-has-not-closed-american-school-fake-news-maria-zakharova/ ) . 
  tl ; dr : fake news made up by cnn . 
  except eusp is [ yet to be shut down ] ( https://eu.spb.ru/en/news ) , no ? 
  i 'm literally crying right now . 
  can someone please think of the overprivledged children of western diplomats and wealthy multinational businessmen !, 
  as long as it helps keeping radical preachers and shady hoaxers at bay , i 'm fine with it . 
   the anglo-american school of moscow < . .  catered to students between the ages of 4 and 18 , chartered by the american , british and canadian embassies . 
  < . .  the majority of students were the children of diplomats and foreign businesspeople . 
  [ wiki : anglo-american school of moscow ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglo-american_school_of_moscow ) no worries , `` ordinary russians '' had no business being there . 
  since the fall of communism , russia 's had a lot of problems with religious sects of various degrees of insanity . 
  hence the restrictions . 
   nursi inspired a faith movement [ 18 ] [ 19 ] that has played a vital role in the revival of islam in turkey and now numbers several millions of followers worldwide . 
   said nursi lived much of his life in prison and in exile , ** persecuted by the secularist state ** for having invested in religious revival . 
  looks pretty bad to me . 
   which makes persecuting them okay ? 
  yes . 
  why on earth do we need yet another bunch of religious nutjobs ? 
  plus jw reportedly targeted lonely seniors so that the scammers could brainwash them into giving up their expensive apartments in moscow . 
   peaceful religious individuals and groups , particularly muslim readers of turkish theologian ** said nursi ** who was a radical sunni islamist and whose teachings have inspired [ fethullah g\u00fclen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fethullah_g%c3%bclen ) . 
   and jehovah 's witnesses which is a fucking sect . 
  my point is , aside from a few politicians/generals being slightly butthurt , there is next to no outrage toward ch this time . 
  seems like the public finally got used to their kind of humour . 
  i could barely find any [ news about it in the local media ] ( https://www.gazeta.ru/social/news/2016/12/28/n_9512651.shtml ) . 
  a bitter commentary coming from a mod representative hardly amounts to full-blown outrage . 
  the headline is just being a bit clickbaity . 
  neither of those types appeal to me .
