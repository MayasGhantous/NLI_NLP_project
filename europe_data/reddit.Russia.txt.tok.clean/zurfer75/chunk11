  i wrote about [ this article ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ru&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.newtimes.ru%2farticles%2fdetail%2f86540&amp;edit-text= ) on the sub three weeks ago . 
  he writes too much but his predictions still make sense . 
  unfortunately , no one wants to read google-translated text . 
  i 've deleted my comments . 
  i would n't touch it with a ten-foot pole . 
  that signal had been transmitting from military site in the zelenograd area . 
  i used to go there on holidays , friend of mine has got a dacha in the village near this place . 
  i 've read that it 's some kind of synchro signal for military purposes , maybe it 's just a speculation . 
  iirc by now that place is abandoned . 
  [ bimmer ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381936/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_6 ) and [ bimmer 2 ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402874/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_5 ) - nice stories about plain moscow guys , russian people and famous german vehicles . 
  from the recent ones : [ zhit ' ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2190483/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2 ) is an amazing movie but it 's full of hope and sadness . 
  if russia uses nukes we * all * will die a few times in a row . 
  stop that shit . 
  two months ago polite people t-shirts were handed out in a shopping mall in the red square . 
  it 's a cheap pr move , nothing more . 
  if moscow principality acquires a nuke , i 'll eat my hat . 
  so , distribution of 30k t-shirts is a big deal ? 
  i agree it looks kinda stupid , but euromaidanpress is blowing it out of proportion . 
  it 's a common thing in all slavic countries . 
  there 's nothing to be ashamed of . 
  nothing to add . 
  there were tens of thugs standing behind fences along the way . 
  funny , they were the only ones wearing tracksuits among the people there . 
  they were throwing yellow-black ribbons at protesters , shouting insults etc. 
  this disproportion is the aftermath of the 90s . 
  a third part of my male schoolmates is already dead . 
  i believe a baby boom was started a few years ago and going on for now . 
  mr pelevin ? 
  is it you ? 
  tens of thousands was enough in 1991 . 
  revolution does n't need millions to happen . 
  population of the rest of russia does n't matter at all . 
  moving across the country could take a week , besides the fact that only a few would have come to defend the gov ` t. 
  just edited [ video on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvjfgeb9d2s ) . 
  if anyone interested , [ there 's a pov ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2gp3or/crimean_tatar_mejlis_given_24_hours_to_leave/cklpual ) of average ivan ( me ) to the issue . 
  furthermore , according to [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_russia ) , 6.5 % of citizens of rufed are muslims . 
  you have to stop thinking of crimean tatars as of ethnic minority . 
  they 're just another * muslim * minority within * current * russia borders . 
  by now , it 's a reality we 'll have to deal with . 
  moreover . 
  crimean muslims ( see what i did here ? ), 
  is a hostile to the regime . 
  being * hostile muslim minority \u2122 * is the big no no in russia . 
  from pov of authorities , average muslim can read only prohibited yada yada jihad jihad books . 
  quran is being read by a mullah . 
  so , crack down on the library was inevitable . 
  just to keep 'em in check . 
  we know how russian government reacts to any muslim insurgency . 
  to be honest , i wonder why are they so soft now ? 
  edit : grammar . 
  whatever . 
  i 'm just cynic , it 's not avoidable in that job . 
  cognitive dissonance , etc. 
  television is a lie , even the best one . 
  moreover , eastern russia is north of north korea , north korea is south of eastern russia . 
  what a brilliant idea : adding a name of the cardinal direction to a geographic name !, 
  man , i 'm sure it works in both ways !, 
  shame on you , op . 
  also , shame on me for an attempt of translation : a price of the community is clear for anyone . 
  while you smile wide , small talk goes on , the truthful mind is wrecked . 
  a knife is behind your back . 
  ruler of the east [ ( wiki ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladivostok ) . 
  * edit : * in advance : yes , right . 
  ' - mir ' means `` world '' . 
  ^ winks, 
  there are also vostok watches , grow some balls and wear it !,

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vostok_watches ^ here ^ we ^ go ^ again, 
  i 'm not a producer or journalist , thanks god . 
  as a motion designer i 've got a couple of channels and tens of shows in my showreel . 
  all designs were made for russian entertainment tv . 
  so , meeting the needs of ~ ~ babushkas and slav scum ~ ~ old ladies and young gentlemen is my work . 
  i have a virtual master degree in that field , haha . 
  * edit : / u/4ringcircus is right , i 'm unworthy to serve in the temple of truth :'( *, 
  i 've heard a word `` distance '' . 
   this exercise was deliberately misnamed hell knows how it was misnamed when it 's happened in [ voronezh ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/place/%d0%92%d0%be%d1%80%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b5%d0%b6,+%d0%92%d0%be%d1%80%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b5%d0%b6%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%8f+%d0%be%d0%b1%d0%bb%d0%b0%d1%81%d1%82%d1%8c/@51.3256172,40.5023388,5z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x413b2f5ce874e813:0x48d94c0efba762bd?hl=ru ) . 
  i 'm just guessing that you 've deliberately misspelled / r/china when submitting your link on / r/europe . 
  ^ such ^ a ^ shame . 
  how to apply for a job on the channel ? 
  i 'm sure they got cookies for me . 
  there is also the vostok spacecraft , standing in moscow museum   the first human spaceflight in history was accomplished on this spacecraft on april 12 , 1961 , by soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vostok_ ( spacecraft ) ^ your ^ turn, 
  just fyi : `` vostok '' means `` east ''  the maneuvers will take place on the island of sakhalin , the kamchatka peninsula , chukotka , and the southern part of the primorsky territory ( ** russian far east ** ) . 
  i 've been working as computer graphics & animation artist last twenty years . 
  hell knows how to prove it , show 'em my portfolio ? 
  to whom ? 
  i never thought about it . 
  basically , all i need is a job appointment . 
  btw , i 've seen very good job offers in china . 
  good salary , full pansion , free transfer , free housing , need n't bother about work permit or visa because they do it all by themselves . 
  looks like a trap , but i 'm too old to be a sex slave of organ donor anyway , haha . 
  i totally wo n't miss a chance to say `` fuck you '' to game developers !, 
  answered [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2gvbkg/vladimir_putin_seeks_power_to_unplug_russia_from/ckn7qfd ) , thanks !, 
  i partially answered [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2gvbkg/vladimir_putin_seeks_power_to_unplug_russia_from/ckn7aw7 ) , thank you . 
  btw , i have no idea about dota , never played it , but i did n't encounter such problems in wow . 
  each server has its own language settings , annoying or speaking foreign language players can be easily reported to gms ( and it works ! ) . 
  probably , it 's a question of proper in-game chat moderation , ai n't it ? 
  i ca n't help but to say `` fuck you '' to our public schools .
