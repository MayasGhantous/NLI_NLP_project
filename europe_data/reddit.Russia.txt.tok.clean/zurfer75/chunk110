  i would be a ukip supporter though if it existed in russia . 
  dude , i think it 's obvious for everyone with a couple of functioning brain cells that the us and nato do n't care about anything but pursuing their own interests . 
  the problem is that our corrupt , two-faced , lying elites , who openly despise their fellow citizens , ca n't stand their ground against the west because de facto they and their families live in the west and their property and assets are all stashed in the western countries . 
  the middle ground keeps its mouth shut . 
  kungurov , a buddy of limonov and a staunch stalinist . 
  like in plato 's ideal state ? 
  normally , moscow hanukkah festivities kick off at [ the revolution square ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolution_square,_moscow ) , right behind the back of karl marx 's statue ( i know , it 's weird ) , and last for a week or so . 
  here are a video from [ this year 's opening event ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyk2ylo-c_i ) , and [ some photos ] ( http://varlamov.ru/1534246.html ) from the last year . 
  nb : do n't read yt comments . 
  vox populi can be toxic at times ... 
  that 's why i think that any possible plans to develop siberian agriculture are unrealistic . 
  there are still plenty of unused arable land in areas with less extreme climatic conditions . 
  ahem , every able bodied russian dude is legally obliged to be a part of the russian army . 
  realistically , karelia is so small that it could n't possibly serve as a model territory . 
   just not very profitable _ or _ , not profitable at all . 
  depending on the average temperature , it may be easier to put more effort into proven agricultural areas . 
  according to the [ world bank database ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ag.lnd.arbl.zs?view=map ) , the percentage of arable land in rufed is 7.5 % . 
  you 're welcome to provide a better source . 
  the biggest russian children 's charity activist of something to that effect .

  2/3 of the russian territory is permafrost , so normally nobody wants to live there . 
  the direction of the discussion is getting dangerously close to `` finding a final solution '' so i advise you to knock it off , for your own good . 
   it represents a case of tu quoque or the appeal to hypocrisy , [ 3 ] a logical fallacy which attempts to ** discredit the opponent 's position by asserting the opponent 's failure to act consistently ** in accordance with that position , without directly refuting or disproving the opponent 's initial argument . 
  [ wiki : whataboutism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whataboutism ) . 
  i was neither attacking your position nor accusing you in hypocrisy . 
  therefore , the term `` whataboutism '' is not applicable here and you just used a buzzword without understanding its meaning . 
   the note named specific groups that are particularly susceptible or vulnerable to fake news , including `` russian-germans '' and people with turkish origins , the magazine reported . 
  yet another totally not racist and not patronizing statement . 
  `` the untermensch are too dumb to think for themselves and therefore need to be spoon fed by the state-approved counter-propaganda . '', 
  - that 's how it sounds to me . 
  and osama bin laden was once seen as a hero . 
  see where i 'm coming from ? 
  because writing a book somehow abstains him from being a supporter of jihad ? 
  let 's just agree to disagree . 
  georgia ( which had had nato membership aspirations for a long time ) allowed the presence of an ichkeria embassy on its territory . 
  a lot of chechen jihadists have found refuge in turkey , a nato member . 
  akhmed zakayev still lives in london . 
  i mean , come on . 
  true , but complaining about these two topics is universally acceptable in sense that ` no social stigma attached ' . 
  the fact that imf 's money was stolen has nothing to do with the cause of the default . 
  just a side effect . 
  they are still russians . 
  we complain about the bad weather and corruption all the time . 
  [ sort of ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:russian_orthodox_church_followers.png ), 
  the ceo dude is not wrong , just being overdramatic . 
  of course it 's not the west that is to blame for russia 's economic woes , but their half assed meddling in russian politics has done more harm than good during the 90s . 
  i mean , supporting throat-slitting islamic insurgents in a mainly cristian country , how on earth is that okay , as long as your country 's name is not saudi arabia ? 
  is this how you guys make friends , eh ? 
  this headline is misleading though ( what else can you expect out of these southerners ? ), 
  the record low temperature of -73 c was registered in oymyakon in the 1930s . 
  jesus will spank you for this , mark my words . 
  well , it 's embarrassing . 
  at the moment like this , i thank god for not being an orthodox :d, 
  i 'm not really familiar with american statistics , sorry . 
  basically , anyone ( i guess ) can get the raw data from goskomstat , or the general prosecutor 's [ website ] ( http://crimestat.ru/offenses_map ) or the ministry of internal affairs or [ from somewhere else ] ( https://rospravosudie.com/research/crime_map.html ) and make their own presentation . 
  it was n't me who started talking about the role of russian leadership in the decline of homicide rates  i 'd like to hear some arguments too . 
  ahem , i 'm aware of statistics and that the overall situation has improved over the last 15 years . 
  i just pointed out that neither praising the dearest leader nor outright blaming him does justice to the truth . 
  as a matter of fact , i just do n't understand why it always has to be black or white , all or nothing when it comes to discussing the period of putin 's rule . 
  whatever makes you feel better . 
  i have no clue whether his policies have had an effect or not . 
   depending on one 's point of view , it could be everything , nothing or something in between . 
  depending on one 's point of view , it could everything , nothing or something in between . 
  however , it 's a common way to evaluate a leader 's efficiency in his position , along the lines of : * over the course of the presidency of x , the y parameter has changed from z to z ' * . 
  a proof of what , exactly ? 
  things have gotten better since the 90s ? 
  it 's hard to argue with that . 
  i ca n't take the measurement of the dearest leader 's personal input ( or lack thereof ) to the country 's well being . 
  and i 'm afraid no one can , objectively . 
  you 're missing the point . 
  since it is a matter of subjective evaluation , one can glorify the dearest leader regardless of statistics . 
  the inverse is also true . 
  the data seems to be digged from the database of goskomstat . 
  at least , the page footer says so :  murder rates calculated from the population figures , crime figures by federal subject for the years 2005-2010 and mortalities from external causes 2014 , mortalities from external causes 2015 for the 2014 and 2015 years . 
  the baltic states are vastly different from russia . 
  population wise , drawing a comparison between rufed and ukraine / poland could make sense , but still it does n't take into account certain ` cultural ' aspects . 
  in short , i have no idea . 
  perhaps , comparing apples and oranges makes no sense at all . 
  again , not everyone is so obsessed with putin as the western public seems to be . 
  some people praise him , some do n't . 
  historically , russia loves strong leaders . 
  oh , come on !, 
  you ca n't be serious . 
  street violence , general lawlessness , and a lack of basic services are much , much worse than anything else ( besides war of smth equally bad ) . 
   some others `` some others '' have it done under the supervision of ( or thanks to the aspiration to join ) the eu . 
  plus , you ca n't seriously compare a nearly monocultural country as big , population wise , as my district in moscow to the mess that russia has always been . 
  regardless , though , i do n't attribute the decline in homicide rates to the dearest leader , but many people do and i ca n't blame them for such oversimplification . 
  after all , it 's the result that matters . 
  still worth it . 
  you ca n't put sanctions on the largest banks along with the most profitable sectors of a country 's economy and expect it to have no impact on the general populace . 
  the sanctioned companies are way too intertwined with everything else to make it happen . 
  granted , the oil prices play a major role in the downturn of the economy , but saying that the western sanctions were n't aimed at the common folk is plain dishonest - they were . 
  the whole point of putting sanctions is making pressure on the poor and middle class in hope that they , in turn , put some pressure on the elite . 
  not really . 
  check this one : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_federal_subjects_of_russia_by_murder_rate moscow as well as most of the heartland cities went from honduras-esque two digits homicide rates in 2005 to single digits over the course of the last 10 years . 
  do n't even let me started on the '90s . 
  safety is one of those things that people value the most . 
  here 's a hint : maslow 's hierarchy of needs . 
  it 's not like the majority of russians had been significantly better off before the whole sanctions thing kicked in . 
  now at least they have someone to blame for their woes ( le ebil westerners ) , and something to be proud of ( the ` liberation ' of crimea ) .
