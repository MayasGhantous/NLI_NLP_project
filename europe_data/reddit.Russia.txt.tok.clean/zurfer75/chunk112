  except in a real police state you could n't get away with 20 arrests without having your life completely ruined . 
  `` check and balances '' is not a `` very smart way '' , it 's just a normal way to deal with politics . 
  in case you forgot , nobody 's let navalny run in the mayoral elections in a normal way . 
  he was essentially banned from media . 
  courts , attorney and cops ** are not ** a unified machine . 
  they benefit from a high conviction rate . 
  hence the latest witch-hunting frenzy , because lawsuits related to political agenda are a low-hanging fruit for them . 
  no offense but `` the almighty police state '' is a myth ( or a self-fulfilling prophecy , if you will ) and you felt for it hook , line , and sinker . 
  `` allowed '' , that 's fucked up man . 
  what 's with the meek mentality ? 
  his own brother is in jail . 
  yet you make it sound as though they did him a favor . 
  you 're just reciting the lines from kremlin 's propaganda playbook . 
  it 's boring . 
  they 'd be totally happy if navalny would just shut up or have fled the country . 
  that 's what a propagandist would say . 
  the regime could n't care less about the perceived legitimacy of the elections , they 're being much more focused on practical matters . 
  the never ending war in north caucasus has been a reality since the late '80s . 
  according to [ this poll ] ( https://therunet.com/news/4664 ) , the russians trust the internet more than tv . 
  why do you think paid shills in this very thread come out of the woodwork and start shitting all over the perspectives of navalny to become a president one day ? 
  because the internet propaganda matters a lot . 
  he is not wrong about it . 
  making bold claims about the legal status of crimea could easily land him in hot water . 
  so he chose not to do that , which is perfectly fine , imo . 
   that mr. navalny was even allowed to run ** was seen as an attempt by the kremlin ** to make the election look more legitimate . 
  in other words , the author implies that navalny is a puppet . 
  which is propaganda . 
   in the meantime , mr. navalny garnered more than 27 percent of the vote in a race for mayor of moscow , a better result than any other open critic of the kremlin in a major election since mr. putin assumed office in 1999 . 
  that mr. navalny was even allowed to run was seen as an attempt by the kremlin to make the election look more legitimate . 
  nyt forgot to mention the fact that navalny managed to get his 27 % while being flat out banned from state-owned tv channels . 
  yet this so called `` journalist '' did n't hesitate to parrot a kremlin propaganda bit about how navalny was accessory for making the elections more legitimate . 
  i ca n't even fathom how depressing to see such a sad state of affairs in the western media . 
  the licence suspension was reportedly [ put on hold ] ( https://www.gazeta.ru/science/news/2016/12/13/n_9449717.shtml ) by the arbitration court of saint petersburg . 
  roi is just as useless as change org . 
  only a humble petition to tzar may help in this case !, 
   they can go to a liberal country this is rich coming from someone who does n't even live in russia . 
  `` let them eat cake ! '', 
  newsflash , most of them ca n't do it . 
  i take it you 've never been to any autonomous republic in rufed , 
   french and spanish alphabets have accents , cedillas , tildes so do many local ` cyrillic ' alphabets in rufed , which were adopted for writing in local languages . 
  it 's just a matter of usability after all . 
  i do n't think that anything substantial are going to change here . 
  it 's called standardization , methinks . 
  using a standard script simplifies book printing issues . 
  because you 'll need to print , y' know , school textbooks and other stuff in local languages . 
  plus , it makes a great deal of sense when it comes down to , say , road signs in local languages . 
  i for one would n't want to struggle with reading the arabic script if i had to take a trip to kazan ' , for example . 
  i 'm struggling with understanding what is your point exactly ? 
  local language classes in schools are n't real ? 
  bi - and more-lingual tatarstan , caucasian republics are n't real ? 
  tv channels [ broadcasting in local languages ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a1%d0%bf%d0%b8%d1%81%d0%be%d0%ba_%d1%80%d0%be%d1%81%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%b9%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8%d1%85_%d1%82%d0%b5%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%be%d0%b2#.d0.a2.d0.b5.d0.bb.d0.b5.d0.b2.d0.b8.d0.b4.d0.b5.d0.bd.d0.b8.d0.b5_.d0.bd.d0.b0_.d1.80.d0.b5.d0.b3.d0.b8.d0.be.d0.bd.d0.b0.d0.bb.d1.8c.d0.bd.d1.8b.d1.85_.d1.8f.d0.b7.d1.8b.d0.ba.d0.b0.d1.85_.d0.a0.d0.be.d1.81.d1.81.d0.b8.d0.b8 ) are n't real ? 
  if you are being concerned with the inevitable decline in using of local languages in rufed , i 've got a news for you : local languages suck big time . 
  because being fluent in a dying language has little to no use irl . 
  i 'm partially belarusian/mari myself and i do n't give a flying fuck about their respective local cultures/languages . 
  being able to understand basic english trumps it all for me . 
  what , may i ask , does this rant have to do with my comment ? 
  i 'm well aware of the issues that rufed has had with the censorship / human rights for the last 10-15 years . 
  [ this is a list of the languages that are recognized as official ( state ) in constitutions of the republics of russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_russia#official_languages ) , you really should educate yourself before posting baseless assumptions . 
  it may come as a surprise but personally i 'm perfectly fine with being branded as `` asian '' , `` mongoloid '' and whatnot . 
  i do n't take it as an insult . 
  people who care too much about the amount of `` pure '' aryan blood running through their veins are just petty , insecure racists . 
  `` westernism '' has never been written in stone anyway , it is a vague , living concept , in sense that you can share some western values while rejecting others . 
   however , the management has responded that ukrainian journalists could not work for the russian service `` because their cultural background is too different '' . 
   journalists have rejected the explanation as ridiculous . 
  in fact , the journalists from both the ukrainian and the russian teams were born in the ex-soviet union and thus share more or less the same cultural , educational and other backgrounds . 
  are they implying that uncivilized mongoloid swines from the eastern horde could share the same cultural background with a shining beacon of western values , namely ukraine ? 
  what a blow to their ego that would be !, 
  the leaflet is just a bit nicer way to tell the recipients to gtfo of lithuania than , for instance , painting a hammer and sickle on the front door . 
  they should at least hire a native speaker for a grammar check . 
  using correct phrasing is hard , i know . 
  as in `` but you not a real ( wo ) man '' . 
  which is dehumanizing and discriminatory . 
  baba yaga comes from the indigenous pagan culture . 
  i would agree with you if you said it all comes from kievan rus or , say , novgorod . 
   let 's not get into the russians invented everything mentality . 
  projecting much ? 
  i just expressed my doubts that the myth comes from poland . 
   the first clear reference to baba yaga ( iaga baba ) occurs in 1755 ; mikhail v. lomonosov 's rossiiskaya grammatika ( ` russian grammar ' ) . 
  the bill was aimed at the _ malicious _ misuse of gender pronouns . 
  i can think of a lot of situations in which intentional misgendering can be a form of discrimination of transgender/transsexual people . 
  it 's just a steaming pile of alt-right propaganda . 
  [ bill c-16 -- no , its not about criminalizing pronoun misuse ] ( http://sds.utoronto.ca/blog/bill-c-16-no-its-not-about-criminalizing-pronoun-misuse/ ) . 
   but last time i checked in russia there 's no information war . 
  eh , i 'd rather say that our domestic social media much more divided than that of the west . 
  gazeta 's columnists are all as liberal as you can get . 
  [ for the record , yes , george w. bush did help create isis ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/14/jeb-bush-isis_n_7284558.html ) . 
  when you forcibly dismantle a country 's armed forces , including police , and then refuse to provide some basic security to the country 's population - so you make space for so-called ` power vacuum ' . 
  any vacuum needs to be filled , hence the rise of religious extremism in iraq/syria . 
  for instance , if such chaos happened in a non-muslim country , there would be a rise of your ` normal ' organized crime . 
  god , the moomins was a cartoon i vehemently hated when i was a kid . 
  the plot was so cheesy that it was borderline insulting to my intelligence . 
   according to science and logic it is a disease  im talking about how it can be seen . 
  sorry , does n't look like that to me . 
  my point still stands . 
  homophobic rhetoric is unacceptable on / r/europe . 
  take it as a warning . 
  `` food , ivan arnoldovich , is a subtle thing . 
  one must know how to eat , yet just think -- most people do n't know how to eat at all . 
  one must not only know what to eat , but when and how . ' ( philip philipovich waved his fork meaningfully . ), 
  ` and what to say while you 're eating .
