  yes , my dear sir . 
  if you care about your digestion , my advice is -- do n't talk about bolshevism or medicine at table . 
  and , god forbid -- never read soviet newspapers before dinner . ' ` m\u2019mm . 
  but there are no other newspapers . ' ` in that case do n't read any at all . 
  do you know i once made thirty tests in my clinic . 
  and what do you think ? 
  the patients who never read newspapers felt excellent . 
  those whom i specially made read pravda all lost weight . '' - mikhail bulgakov , heart of a dog, 
   there were russians there just doing their thing cool story . 
  `` mother russia '' is mostly a western meme . 
  to my knowledge , the only case when it was used non-ironically in russian was the ww2 wartime propaganda . 
  the most obvious choice would be state-funded , non-partisan media , such as bbc or dw . 
  disinformation comes from many sources . 
  sometimes it could be linked to state actors , like rt , sometimes it 's just people who are more prone to embrace conspiracy theories . 
  tabloids are popular because they give you simple answers . 
  either way , the modern mass culture is built around entertainment and therefore , any kind of new media you can come up with must be simple and entertaining . 
  the problem with ` serious ' media outlets is that the twitter generation just ca n't go through 10 pages of text without getting bored . 
  the question is , though , whether it is financially feasible to run subscription-only media or not . 
  most popular newspapers are all tabloids anyway . 
  perhaps , this is a natural form for the media existence in the 21th century . 
  fine by me . 
  `` the reserve _ fund _ is projected to be depleted in 2017 , not [ the whole foreign exchange currency reserves ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/foreign-exchange-reserves ) . 
  maruoani and his lawyer were freed later the same day . 
  according to an aide of the lawyer , the moscow police apologized for the occurrence and has yet to press charges against the singer . 
  [ [ lenta ] ] ( https://lenta.ru/news/2016/11/30/sorry/ ), 
   that leaves private , professional media with plenty of homework to do . 
  how did we end up more mistrusted by a large segment of western readers and viewers than state-funded sputnik or rt ? 
  did we perhaps follow government narratives too closely and uncritically ? 
  sucking up to elites did n't go unnoticed by the plebs , that 's what happened . 
  fair enough . 
  it 's not like two previous governments were any better though . 
  i was merely addressing the form in which the message was delivered . 
  good agitprop is never a load of lies , but a set of thoroughly structured and then presented truths . 
  by the way , lumping together the war in georgia with that of ukraine is a dead giveaway that you are not well informed about the situation ` on the ground ' . 
  not every country is the same as any other country . 
  while the war in ukraine really came out of the blue , most conflicts in northern caucasus have a long and complicated history . 
  i have no idea whether the map is correct or not , but something named * atlantic council * ` debunking ' russian propaganda sounds just as laughable as peskov 's mustache denying russia 's involvement in ukraine or something like that . 
  furthermore , hiding the truth behind technicalities such as the imaginary difference between ' a neighboring country ' and , say , germany or turkey , or ` this is not a nato base , this is an american base ' does n't make any sense . 
  we all know who calls the shots in nato . 
  grow a pair already and accept the reality : the shitflinging match between the west and rufed that we 're witnessing now is a necessary part of pre-war preparations . 
  so it all has nothing to do with ` debunking propaganda myths ' . 
  thank god i never liked popcorn , because i 'd be probably 100 kg by now . 
  dudaev is da real mvp , hats off . 
   moscow -- a russian human rights group has published a database containing personal information about nearly 40,000 members of the notorious security force that carried out soviet dictator joseph stalin 's purges , shedding light on an ugly stretch of history the kremlin would prefer to remain hidden . 
   the archive , culled from the records of stalin 's security forces ( the nkvd ) and posted on the website of memorial , the human rights group , for the first time names those who carried out some 700,000 executions from 1935 to 1939 during `` the great terror . '' russian president vladimir putin has in recent years revised stalin 's legacy , emphasizing the dictator 's role in defeating nazi germany in world war ii and turning the soviet union into a world power . 
  it 's called `` recursive spider '' . 
  i believe website downloaders are supposed to do this , you 'll just need to make sure that downloading of media files is turned off and the main page of reddit would make a great start , 
  sort of . 
  they ca n't start seizing people 's savings anyway , as it could spark a banking panic in no time . 
  that 's why they 're raising property tax now with more new taxes to come . 
  central bank is shooting down smaller banks left , right , and center . 
  at this point , it 's safe to say that public confidence in the domestic banking system has fallen quite low . 
  hardly work against the money stashed in foreign banks / offshore companies . 
  source : your ass :d `` how oligarchs stole all our money '' is a general topic for a casual conversation in russia , it 's almost as common as complaining about bad weather . 
  realistically , what can be done about that ? 
  anything short of setting their mansions on fire will be pointless . 
  i 'm fairly sure that such a move would be frowned upon by european authorities , haha . 
  why ? 
  female inmates are usually less judgmental . 
  plus she has n't done anything particularly horrible . 
  it 's not that simple . 
  the banking sector , oil & gas related hi tech stuff are all under sanctions . 
  there are large web boards crowded with people discussing in which non-russian banks it is still possible to open an individual / small business account . 
  now it 's almost impossible even in hk banks , let alone western european ones . 
  the bottom line : you have to be filthy rich to overcome the restrictions . 
  if you are a simple dude who only wanted to make a small saving for a rainy day - welcome to shady eastern european banks . 
  which is kinda ironic , considering that those russian nouveau riches who are rich enough to actually _ have _ connections within the ruling elite are the ones who have lesser problems with the western sanctions . 
  if anything , the global warming has increased the likelihood of freezing rains here in moscow . 
  and the last summer had been hitting african levels of heat at times . 
  so i have mixed feelings about all this stuff . 
  i hate you now . 
   church slavonic language is chimera here we go again . 
  reminds of a word game my friends and me used to play back in the days . 
  no , man , that 's not the case with russia . 
  then again , countries _ are _ people , unless they are occupied or something . 
  there is no other way to spin it . 
  come to think of it , i too used to have delusions in that regard . 
  the internet , thankfully , changed my view . 
  yeah sure . 
  i 'm afraid that on the contrary , many russians , especially the ones who only watch domestic tv channels , seriously underestimate the amount of hatred the westerners have for them . 
  the state-owned tv often paints very rosy picture about ` the common people ' in the west wrt their attitude to russia . 
  whereas [ the facts suggest otherwise ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/09/russias-global-image-negative-amid-crisis-in-ukraine/pg-2014-07-09-russia-favorability-02/ ) . 
  could n't care less about the opinion of all of the abovementioned . 
  [ `` some media say that europeans ca n't stand russians . 
  we checked with some europeans to see if that 's true . 
  watch what they say !, 
  '' ] ( https://www.facebook.com/euvsdisinfo/videos/1213000258746283/ ) making videos like this serves no purpose at all . 
  what if they asked the same questions somewhere east of the oder-neisse line ? 
  in that case , the resulting picture might be not as rosy as they painted . 
  i mean , if i spent a day or two interviewing people in the streets ( at least , in moscow ) on any kind of sensitive topic , be it gays , ukraine or whatever , there would be enough material to make _ two _ 5 min long videos fully supporting _ two _ completely opposite / orthogonal narratives of my choice . 
  and what is important is that none of the two would be a _ fake _ in the strict sense of the word . 
  what does it all have to do with the russians ? 
  [ russia is n't actually that happy about trump 's victory | nyt ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/opinion/russia-isnt-actually-that-happy-about-trumps-victory.html?_r=0 ) .

  kirby resorted to `` and you are lynching negroes '' in that exchange . 
  even though i 'm not a fan of rt , the way he reacted was unprofessional and , lets be honest here , he was kind of a dick to the girl .
