  if he thinks that rt does n't belong to free press - fair enough , but in that case , they should not have invited an rt journalist to the press conference . 
  if you happen to live in one of [ those republics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_russia#official_languages ) , voting ballots must be printed in two languages , so you could vote . 
   the rules of citizenship by birth generally follow the principle of jus sanguinis [ [ wiki ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/citizenship_of_russia ) , so formally you wo n't need to speak russian to acquire one , provided that at least one of your parents was a citizen of rufed beforehand ( or both parents have got a residence permit ) . 
  naturalisation , on the other hand , does require passing a language test , though i may be wrong about the details . 
  lie or not , this is what many people believe in . 
  according to the latest census , around [ 800.000 ] ( http://www.russkiymir.ru/publications/86202/ ) of russian citizens do n't speak russian ( my deepest apologies for the source ) . 
  i guess this is mostly limited to rural areas of non-slavic republics , such as tatarstan , tuva or dagestan . 
   the icc , set up in 2002 , has been a tame , rather inefficient institution . 
  ** it has only completed proceedings against 17 people , and has convicted just three . 
  all 39 suspects indicted by the court have been african ** . 
  burundi , south africa and gambia cited that history when they said they would no longer recognize the court 's jurisdiction . 
  bensouda 's report appears to be an attempt to show the court has a broader reach -- but the reaction of the bigger powers has been predictable . 
   elizabeth trudeau , the state department spokeswoman , said tuesday that ** the u.s. did not `` believe that an icc examination or investigation with respect to the actions of u.s. personnel in relation to the situation in afghanistan is warranted or appropriate . '' ** the u.s. , she said , was not an icc member , and in any case it had its own robust procedures to hold members of its military accountable . 
  do as i say , not as i do . 
  does n't matter . 
  beside kazakhstan , there is only one relevant candidate to join nato . 
  a game changing candidate , i would say . 
  that 's for sure , but it takes two for tango . 
  now they 'll need to convince the western public that it has no other choice than to go to war . 
  give it a couple more years . 
  brainwashing is a lengthy process . 
  you point being ? 
  yes , russia ( or rsfsr at the times ) was involved in those places . 
  thinking that russia was the main instigator , esp regarding so and abkhazia , is immense lunacy . 
  it 's possible though that there was some group or internal force that may have escalated the conflicts . 
  what exactly are you referring to ? 
  i 'm aware of russia 's involvement in ukraine , thank you . 
  whatever man . 
  have a nice day . 
  if you truly believe that ksa or turkey are ( were ? 
  not sure about turkey 's position now ) independent actors here , then i have a bridge to sell you . 
   russia is casting a wide net in the wake of the october hostage crisis in a moscow theater , asking governments from denmark to the persian gulf to cooperate in efforts against chechen separatists . 
  for its part , denmark detained ahkmed zakayev , a representative of chechen rebel leader aslan maskhadov , after the russian government accused zakayev of involvement in the siege . 
  in addition , moscow has alleged that the chechen hostage-takers made telephone calls to islamic foundations in saudi arabia , the united arab emirates and turkey during the standoff . 
  although it is well established that charities in the persian gulf have ties to islamic militant organizations , the accusations against secular turkey are another story . 
  < . .   throughout the 1990s , turkey allegedly gave covert support to the chechen rebellion by supplying material , financial and logistical support . 
  moscow began looking more deeply into the relationship after a chechen force comprised of many turks , and led by turkish native muhammed tokcan , seized a russian ferryboat in the turkish port of trabazon in 1996 . moscow responded by backing the pkk , which fought a long , bloody war with turkey for an independent kurdistan until 1999 , when leader abdullah ocalan was captured . 
  [ link ] ( https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/russia-little-power-counter-turkeys-chechen-connection ) . 
  turkey is a nato country , and ksa is a puppet state of the us . 
  the difference is that ` nato green men ' tend to be quite religious and wear full beards . 
  you do n't need tanks to slit the throats of unarmed civilians . 
  you do n't need tanks to establish sharia in a town or to set up a slave market , country fair style . 
  way to twist my words . 
  ksa provided the chechens with money and mercenaries , turkey - with shelter and medical aid , georgia - with free passage . 
  everyone had their own job .

  political pressure on yeltsin 's government . 
  america undoubtedly was the one to call the shots . 
  by the way , i did n't know that stratfor was a conspiracy site . 
  there are a number of free of charge vpns and content unblockers that can be installed by a couple of clicks/taps . 
  are you sure that we 've never had to worry about ` green men ' backed by some nato countries ? 
   chechnya posed its biggest threat to russia 's internal security during the chechen wars of 1994-1996 and 1999-2004 . 
  saudi arabia , ** the united states and turkey ** -- all of whom had a vested interest in keeping russia heavily preoccupied after the fall of the soviet union -- ** helped fuel these wars by providing support to the chechen rebels ** . 
  saudi arabia in particular led this effort by implanting the wahhabist doctrine and providing financing , arms , supplies , guerrilla training and moral support to chechen militants . 
  the bulk of saudi support to the chechens was funneled in through charities and humanitarian aid in the region .

  so , if russia is paranoid , is it okay for anyone else to be paranoid ? 
  by the way , speaking of 28 member countries of nato , it 's a fucking billion of people . 
  maybe , just maybe russia has a reason to be a bit paranoid about nato , because nato actually poses a real threat to russia ? 
  yep , i remember something like that . 
  the thing is , there is a lot of controversy around him as of a historical figure , because there is a brutal dictator stalin , who killed millions , and there is a talented military commander stalin , who won the war . 
  and the two barely overlap at all . 
  if you are referring to this one : [ poll : almost 40 % of russians have positive attitude to stalin ] ( http://www.unian.info/politics/1062013-poll-almost-40-of-russians-have-positive-attitude-to-stalin.html ) , then you should read the actual text :  according to the survey , a total of 30 % of respondents respect stalin , 7 % have sympathy , 2 % have admiration , while every third respondent was indifferent to him . 
  < . .   in general , those russians who believe that the suffering of stalin 's victims in soviet times was justified by `` great goals and results , '' has increased from 25 % in 2012 to 45 % in 2015 . 
  while the increase in numbers of those who justify his crimes is definitely worrisome , having some ` respect ' for him is not exactly the same as having a ` positive attitude ' . 
  under his rule , the ussr won the most devastating war in our history . 
  that matters a lot . 
  the west has a lot of nukes too . 
  then again , why on earth should i look at russia from the perspective of our potential enemies ? 
  it wo n't help me to survive , will it ? 
  bombs and bullets do n't care about one 's perspective . 
  neither do hunger and diseases . 
  anyway , this is a pointless discussion . 
  have a nice day . 
  both statements are correct . 
  the difference is , you know , that ` the west ' is a number of times bigger , population wise , and richer than russia could ever be . 
  there is very little trust that the west may be satisfied with anything less than a complete dismantle of the country and dividing it into occupation zones between nato countries . 
  at least , this is a commonplace point of view which is shared by many people here . 
   russia is willing to go to war against the west except it 's not . 
  russia is getting _ ready _ for a war , and the west does the same . 
   russia see an eternal boogieman in the west aswell russia is afraid of the west and , if history is anything to go by , the fear is not completely irrational . 
  except france does n't get a lot of bad press . 
  i 'd rather say that the media coverage of problems in france is either neutral or empathetic . 
  media reporting is totally different when it comes to any kind of things related to russia . 
  it 's not that i believe in some global media conspiracy against this country , no . 
  but a certain hive mind mentality in the western msm is definitely a thing . 
   `` and then it got worse '' which is a western-made meme , by the way . 
  there is no saying like that in russian language . 
  you said it as if a country has to be nice to deserve good relations with the west . 
  in ksa , a beloved ally of the west , they behead people for being gay or under allegations of sorcery . 
  not to mention that the arabs are waging an illegal war of aggression as we speak . 
  and yet nobody bats an eye . 
  russia is just a big , convenient and approved boogie man . 
  you better ask yourself why your society ca n't function without an external enemy so you always need to make one . 
  except [ it did ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/09/03/global-opinion-of-russia-mixed/ ) . 
  in the western msm , russians are always portrayed as either aggressive mobsters or drunk brutes . 
  how the heck is that a positive image ? 
  i hope you 're not going to argue with the fact that the western msm is the one to define a worldview of the vast majority of people . 
   out of those , russia violated the echr convention on human rights 109 times -- more than any other country . 
   behind russia was turkey , with 79 violations of the echr convention , while romania was third with 72 , and ukraine fourth with 50 .
