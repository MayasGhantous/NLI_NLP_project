  no consulate/embassy can grant you with citizenship . 
  ehm , what ? 
  drop that `` you guys '' bullshit mate , this is my second comment in this thread . 
  you ca n't just show up in rufed and get a russian passport in exchange for a soviet one . 
  end of story . 
  it just does n't work like that . 
  you are gon na go through a lot of paperwork before it can happen . 
   it was extremely simple . 
  basically just showing your soviet passport and getting a russian one . 
  nope , it 's never been _ that _ simple . 
  tsargrad , here we come !, 
  how dare you, 
  nothing `` hypothetic '' about that . 
  even though a lot of russian _ citizens _ may consider themselves 100 % `` russian '' as of now , it does n't mean all of them completely forgot their roots and their lineage had no impact on their lives . 
  the impact is just reduced but it 's still there . 
  for good or for bad . 
  those `` 80 % '' are rather `` soviets '' as in `` my lineage is too complicated/irrelevant to spell it out '' , i.e. , those people who ticked the `` russian '' box in the survey are most likely to have a whole bunch of intermixed russian/ukrainian ( cossak ) / tatar ancestors . 
  the soviets have intentionally destroyed the very idea of _ ethnicity _ in rsfsr , they did put a lot of effort in it , only leaving this `` ethnic minority '' construct for terminal cases in which they had n't got enough time to finish the task and overcome the resistance . 
  had the soviet 100 % succeed in their plans , we would have 100 % of `` russians '' living in rufed now , 
  there is a major distinction between ethnocentric nationalism and civic nationalism . 
  as remaining ethnic russians die out , russia as a whole leans toward the latter . 
  xenophobia in rufed is more likely to stem from differences in wealth rather than pure racism . 
  [ nenets autonomous okrug ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nenets_autonomous_okrug ) , pop . 
  i would hazard a guess that op just made a mistake . 
  this area was ranked really low in the [ list of federal subjects of russia by grp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_federal_subjects_of_russia_by_grp ) , near to the bottom of the list . 
  and the number of respondents from your link who would rather russia stays in its established borders went up to 57 % in 2015 . 
  cherry picking whichever number better fits your agenda ? 
  i must have missed it , thank you !, 
  the sad truth is that neither democratic governments nor autocratic ones are going to let the internet off the hook . 
  other than that , having been an avid it enthusiast for the last 3 decades ( my first computer was based on a soviet rip off of z80 ) , what i 've got to say is that i 'm absolutely with you on all of this . 
  it-illiterate politicians are ruining the net for everyone , and we are letting them do it . 
  welp , i did n't see that one coming . 
  tor in its current incarnate is pretty much an one-click solution - it is just slow af . 
  i do n't think that the problem at this point lies in technical capabilities to circumvent the bans . 
  some countries block porn , some - voice apps , some - hate speech etc. 
  the cumulative quality of the internet as we know it goes down , that 's the problem . 
  if said company refuses to comply , their ip gets blocked in russia . 
  so it 's up to the company to decide whether they care or not . 
  navalny is not fat yet his websites are also blocked . 
  there never were a lot of opposition websites to begin with . 
  unlike the isis propaganda , russian opposition never enjoyed a steady stream of foreign funding . 
  the temptation to mute dissenting voices is just too strong to resist . 
  couple that with the recent law allowing extrajudicial blocking of web mirrors , and our puny alternative political scene wo n't stand a chance . 
  make no mistake , it 's not that i believe that free internet would make any difference . 
  it 's just sad to watch them putting yet another nail in the coffin of freedom . 
  pfft , their goal is to put an end to the free exchange of dissenting opinions . 
  a small bunch of tech savvy users who are able to circumvent the restrictions poses no threat whatsoever and will be eventually pushed away from the rest of social media users in rufed . 
  out of sight , out of mind . 
  there is ( nearly ) no need in both controlling the narrative and shaping the public opinion . 
  they just want to make political stuff look toxic and dangerous . 
  `` i would not touch it with a ten feet pole '' is the most preferable reaction they would like to see from the average runet user . 
  i would n't call strelkov a `` liberal oppositioner '' . 
  also known as a `` protestantism/catholicism vs orthodoxy/islam '' map . 
  the landscape is too clean for russia . 
  must be either moscow or spb . 
  my money is ( obviously ) on the southern part of moscow , somewhere along [ kashirka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kashira_highway ) . 
  ... or you could just say `` til , thank you '' . 
  https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/joseph_stalin#misattributed no evidence whatsoever that stalin actually said that . 
  low effort . 
   listen here you low son of a faggot , your low energy subreddit gon na go down changed to a perma-ban . 
  have a nice day !, 
  as i said before , this thread stays because it 's top news in runet . 
  the rule on editorialisation has nothing to with the suppression of freedom of speech . 
  hell , this rule would n't be a thing if people were actually reading articles before commenting , 
   ** disallowed submissions : **   editorialised titles : use the original title of the article . 
  you may add text from the subtitle or the first paragraph where necessary for clarity . 
  refrain from including your opinion within the title or arbitrarily emphasizing selective segments . 
  just so you know , op : https://www.reddit.com//r/europe/wiki/community_rules the thread wo n't be pulled tho . 
  however , the title may be misleading now , because it is up to debate whether nossik has ever been a `` harsh critic '' or not . 
  obviously , none of the prisoners in the list could possibly be charged as political ones - the modern legislation does n't have means for that . 
  hardly . 
  [ memorial human rights centre : list of political prisoners as of 9 may 2016 ] ( http://www.rightsinrussia.info/rights-groups-in-russia/memorialhumanrightscentre ) contains 87 names . 
  this is a decades-old business . 
  one of my schoolmates worked in a joint polish-lithuanian - ( bela ) russian `` enterprise '' like that . 
   we 're all pretty similar with only minor differences between us . 
  no , we are n't . 
  even balts are vastly different from the average russian . 
  do n't even let me started on the rest of europe and beyond . 
  no backsies !, 
  nah , the - stans are haradrim . 
  this is a false equivalence and i bet you know it . 
  homophobia can be violent and threatening whereas your love for r 'n' b ( or lack thereof ) is just a personal preference which nobody gives a damn of . 
  i stand corrected , thank you . 
  nothing dishonest about what i said . 
  if someone dislikes feminine men because the latter are , ugh , feminine , then they are a bigoted moron and should be called out on that , plain and simple . 
  granted , everyone is entitled to their opinion and may disagree with my judgment . 
  but it does n't change the fact that hating on other people because of their harmless peculiarities is moronic , always has been and will be . 
  not _ that _ easily , that 's for sure . 
  i remember that one russian asylum seeker ( on the grounds of lgbt persecution ) committed a suicide in a dutch detention center because he had been denied asylum and was facing deportation back to russia . 
  it 's just a wide-spread stereotype among the russian low-lives that most gay men got ta be feminine . 
  has nothing to do with reality and stems purely from ignorance . 
  i would troll fellow passengers on my trips in the past by telling them that i would enjoy homosex once in a while . 
  their reaction was priceless every time i pulled it , like fucking clockwork , 
  russian tv was modelled after american tv . 
  most local tv shows are either adaptations or rip-offs of popular american tv shows . 
  just like most popular local newspapers are modelled after british tabloids . 
  and most local musicians are just copycats of thier western idols . 
  and the soviet/russian animation tradition just disappeared without a trace . 
  the fall of the ussr killed off the last remnants of the somewhat original local culture , as naive or laughable it used to be sometimes . 
  the nerve of you to defend this moron .
