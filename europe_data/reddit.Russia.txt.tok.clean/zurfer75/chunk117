  considering that 5 years ago stalin got [ 42 % ] ( https://www.gazeta.ru/social/2017/06/26/10737095.shtml ) of the votes and now it is 38 % , the overall trend wrt stalin could be described as cautiously optimistic . 
  then again , the mere fact of having seen 3 brutal tyrants ( stalin , lenin , and piter i ) among the top 5 reduces my optimism back to zero . 
  this is yet another evidence of how utterly clueless western fanboys of the dearest leader tend to be . 
  ethnically russian muslims are few and far between . 
  russian _ citizenship _ is a different matter . 
  that being said , russian ethnicity has eventually become the matter of self identification . 
  this is basically what you think about who you are and that 's about it . 
  suck it , europe . 
  now we are more multicultural than all of you can possibly be :d, 
  if wall st journal is `` hogwash '' to you , please link a better source . 
  i 'm afraid that your assessment of the situation is not correct :  nato rejects russian air-safety proposal for planes in baltic region  * moscow proposed all military planes flying in region would keep transponders operational * [ [ wsj link ] ] ( https://www.wsj.com/articles/nato-rejects-russian-air-safety-proposal-for-planes-in-baltic-region-1474391644 ) seems like nato does n't want to follow this transponder rule . 
  and russia , in turn , wo n't unilaterally agree to do it either . 
  which is not surprising , given the current tensions between the two . 
  the thing is that many of these bullet points are a bit blown out of proportion . 
  for instance , the 5 day war with georgia in 2008 was just a petty revenge for their support of chechen `` separatists '' , and so on . 
  fair enough . 
  that being said , duign 's ideas are nothing new . 
  irredentism ( as in reclaiming `` righteous russian clay '' i.e. 
  crimea ) has been extremely popular in rufed for more than 25 years now . 
  it 's unlikely that dugin has ever been involved in big politics . 
  he was a member of a now banned political party the head of which spent two years in jail for extremism . 
  i 'd wager that it 's dugin himself who pays to shills on reddit for spreading the bullshit about his influence , just because he started to make videos in english for his youtube channel and it needs clicks . 
  and the rest of people just mindlessly repeat the lines from wikipedia without putting much thought into it . 
  hardly `` some '' people though . 
  quite a lot , actually . 
  thing is , moscow 's autonomy , with some exceptions , normally ends at the municipal level . 
  on the other hand , a moscow 's mayor is a much more influential position than that of the vast majority of governors , let alone city mayors . 
   what 's happening in moscow currently just fyi : this is not happening and it seems like not gon na happen . 
  the state duma has just adopted a new law concerning the resettlement . 
  basically , the gov ' t approach to renovation remains the same as before , according to which ppl will get either a compensation or equally valuable apartments as a replacement . 
  the whole _ business _ point of the proposed renovation is kinda lost due to this law , so i would n't hold my breath while waiting for potential developers or investors to jump in , 
  * `` when ukraine sends its people , they 're not sending their best . 
  i 'm afraid you 've got it backwards . 
  kids are stupid ( and arrogant on top of that ) . 
  people of my age ( mid-40s ) are less likely to believe propaganda or the media in general . 
  i mean , being born and raised in the ussr made us overtly cynical and sceptical . 
  i did n't believe pravda back then , i do n't believe the media today . 
  they all lie . 
  i stand corrected , thanks . 
  not even close to that at least in lithuania ; they have like 6 % * of ethnic russians . 
  edit : wrong number . 
   over 40 billion dollar loan was given to russia by the west . 
  got a source for that ? 
  wiki says : `` a ** $ 22.6 billion ** international monetary fund and world bank financial package was approved on 13 july 1998 '' [ [ link ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_russian_financial_crisis )  the money disappeared . 
  `` on 19 march 1999 , u.s. treasury secretary robert rubin had told `` the new york times '' in an interview that the ** $ 4.8 [ billion ] ** loan the imf allocated to russia on 14 august 1998 was `` probably spent improperly . 
  to be more precise , it was misappropriated by yeltsins [ circle ] . '', 
  [ [ link ] ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20080617173807/http://www.rferl.org/reports/corruptionwatch/2002/06/25-270602.asp ) is there any particular reason for the lie/exaggeration ? 
  well , proto-iran if you will . 
  then again , the entire situation is manufactured and so far it 's been done in the most stupid way possible . 
  i do n't give a flying one about beating georgia or ukraine ( or tuvalu for that matter ) into submission , if it was so necessary , geopolitics wise - politics , in general , has nothing to do with basic dignity or emotions . 
  but . 
  there are cia-like means for that , such as , dunno , money , propaganda or blackmail . 
  why on earth did they decide to drag the general populace into that ? 
  all this rallying around the flag and the rise of religious nutters - why ? 
  that 's beyond me . 
  the dearest leader is a smooth talker , i 'll give him that . 
  knowing first hand how utterly clueless about the it stuff most of russian officials are , to the point where they seem to take a pride in their ignorance , i 'm too having a hard time believing in such a great success of `` russian psy ops '' . 
  so far it seems like americans are just being butthurt over electing an orange buffoon into office . 
  hence the hysteria in the western msm trying to shift the blame onto the archenemy . 
  owning up to your fuck up is hard , i see . 
  make no mistake , hacking is really popular here . 
  if needed , the kremlin can hire an army of ` leet hax0rz and hack the living shit out of western networks . 
  but first , you 'll need to know that this could be a thing , right ? 
  and what could come from this . 
  that 's the point . 
  the dead giveaway of prevalent ignorance of our officials is the outcome of their attempts to gain influence over runet . 
  which , aside from poisoning the well , is essentially zero , and a number of such attempts have backfired spectacularly . 
  speaking from personal experience , the modus operandi of the average gov ' t institution in rufed is throwing money at something they have no idea of , and then stopping to give two shits about it . 
  because it 's a process that brings your money in form of kickbacks . 
  and results bring you nothing , except the shitty ones can easily land you to jail . 
  then why worry about it ? 
  hope for the best , insha'allah . 
  no planning whatsoever , not even a semblance of strategy is involved . 
  oh , with the exception of russia 's central bank . 
  it seems that they 've been good so far as even bloomberg gives them a lot of credit . 
  one thing that the dearest leader forgot to mention is the reason why . 
  just to make it sound more plausible , that is . 
  why would `` patriotic hackers '' choose western governments as their targets ? 
  not so long ago , the public attitude towards the us/eu used to be genuinely neutral , if not mostly positive . 
  what happened , the us has since dropped a nuke onto our soil ? 
  not to my knowledge . 
  maybe , being under the constant barrage of vitriolic anti-western propaganda could play a role in turning a less developed but still relatively european country into a [ mostly ] christian version of iran ? 
  maybe , * just maybe * , the army of paid trolls and `` patriotic authors '' that has destroyed the public discourse in both the digital and traditional media has something to do with the recent u-turn ( or even `` turn inwards '' ) of russia 's course ? 
  this all is coming to the point where the existence of non-state actors in the `` russia hacks the west '' plot seems not so far-fetched . 
   doing your job as a journalist , actually became dangerous in the rf . 
  `` actually '' , the chances of getting killed [ tend to decrease ] ( http://imgur.com/kqqkebl ) as time passes . 
  you can see it for yourself : https://cpj.org/killed/europe/russia/ that being said , this kind of statistics does n't tell the whole story b/c it does n't include such things as intimidation by authorities or any other non-fatal means to obstruct a journalist 's work . 
  i did n't mean to be rude , my apologies if it sounded like that . 
  as you may see in my other comment around here , unr was not the only republic that appeared in the post-revolution ukraine . 
  even though your sympathies apparently lie with unr , it does n't make the existence of pro-russian or pro-bolshevik forces in the post-revolution ukraine any less real . 
  unr failed to unite the entirety of ukraine and consequently lost to the reds . 
  the rus ' as an ethnicity was known way before . 
  [ ibn rustah ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ahmad_ibn_rustah ) , a persian traveller , gave his account of tenth-century city of the rus ' . 
  it should be noted that the word `` rus ' '' here refers to the ruling elite who were [ descendants of ] varangian conquerors , and not to their slavic subordinates . 
  anna pretty much falls into the `` elite '' category . 
  ctrl-f `` annex '' , returns 3 results : 1 . the annexation of the austro-hungarian lands of the west ukrainian people 's republic . 
  2 . the ukrainian central council adopted a resolution regarding the kholm governorate protesting its annexation by poland 3 . 
  adoption of the ukrainian central council resolution condemning the annexation of bessarabia by romania so , nope , the founding member was not annexed . 
  i agree on the invasion part though . 
   during its short existence the republic went through several political transformations from the socialist-leaning republic headed by the central council with its general secretariat to the national republic , led by the directorate and by symon petlyura .
