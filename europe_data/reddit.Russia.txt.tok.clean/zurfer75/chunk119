  i 'll leave it up to you to find out how moscow schools [ are ranked in the pisa global education rankings ] ( https://theconversation.com/asian-cities-tussle-for-top-spot-in-new-education-ranking-as-london-left-behind-55266 ) ( even the the article focuses on london in that regard ) . 
  except i 'm not the one who 's trying to belittle other armies here . 
  nor the one who brags about the ` glorious soviet military campaign ' in afghan . 
  condescending armchair generals is one of the most embarrassing things in the internet and they should be called out on their crap . 
  are you talking about the u.s. navy here ? 
   the us navy 's most technologically advanced warship broke down while transiting through the panama canal , the second setback for the $ 4 billion ship in the last two months . 
   the propulsion system of the uss zumwalt ( ddg-1000 ) had problems while passing through the canal and had to be towed in to the former naval station rodman in panama [ [ link ] ] ( https://www.businessinsider.nl/uss-zumwalt-breakdown-panama-2016-11/?international=true&amp;r=us ) just kidding  you guys have proven your indisputable military might in all these wars against camel herders !, 
  lithuania does n't . 
  why should russia interfere in the internal matters of chechnya ? 
  this is a homogenous , mono-ethnic republic ; they have had their own police , courts and clergy for more than a decade now . 
  from a practical ( and cynical ) standpoint , i consider the chechens to have won both wars , b/c now they 're enjoying both self-rule ( and practical impunity for chechen nationals ) _ and _ the inflow of russian money . 
  they should be left to their own devices . 
  and honestly , rufed in its present state is not in the position to lecture other people about gay rights . 
  ** macron marches into the breach of eu overhaul ** * arguably his boldest idea would establish a eurozone budget overseen by a eurozone finance minister * ^ by ^ simon ^ nixon ^ updated ^ may ^ 14 , ^ 2017 ^ 3:42 ^ p.m. 
  ^ et the symbolism could hardly be clearer : emmanuel macron will spend his first full day as president of france in berlin visiting german chancellor angela merkel . 
  the man who campaigned as an ardent pro-european , who greeted the crowds at his victory rally to the strains of the european union anthem , and who pledged at his inauguration on sunday to `` reform and relaunch the eu '' is signaling that this work starts immediately . 
  yet mr. macron may find the challenge of overhauling the eu even more daunting than reforming france . 
  his ambitions for the eu extend from defense to border control , to climate change to tackling so-called social dumping -- the attempt to gain a competitive advantage through looser fiscal , environmental and labor-market policies . 
  but the most eye-catching aspect of his european agenda is his proposal to create a eurozone budget overseen by a eurozone finance minister . 
  in seeking to deepen eurozone fiscal integration , mr. macron is n't short of support . 
  there is a broad agreement across the eurozone that something must be done to restore public confidence in the single currency following a series of shocks that have left much of the continent suffering from high unemployment and stagnating living standards . 
  berlin and brussels also recognize that mr. macron 's election has created a political imperative to show a willingness to engage with the new president 's agenda . 
  but it wo n't be easy . 
  the european commission was tasked by eu leaders two years ago to come up with proposals for deepening economic and monetary union , and the commission is due to publish its proposals at the end of this month . 
  yet these proposals have become the subject of wrangling between national governments with no certainty as to what will emerge , brussels officials with knowledge of the process said . 
  two major ideas are under discussion , both broadly in line with ideas floated by mr. macron and his allies . 
  the first is to use the eurozone 's bailout fund -- the european stability mechanism -- to create so-called european safe bonds , securitized bonds that would be issued by the esm and backed by a pool of eurozone government bonds . 
  initially , governments would remain responsible for their own liabilities , but ultimately esb 's could be guaranteed by the esm -- and therefore jointly guaranteed by eurozone governments -- transforming them into genuine eurobonds . 
  the second proposal is to create a common european-wide unemployment insurance fund , which would allow countries hit by an economic shock to reclaim part of the cost of higher unemployment benefits . 
  both ideas are problematic . 
  it is n't clear there will be any market for european safe bonds without an esm guarantee , which governments are in any case unwilling to allow . 
  and with or without an esm guarantee , there are growing concerns that the creation of a large pool of esbs could trigger a collapse in demand for the nonpooled bonds of the eurozone 's weaker credits , leaving those countries facing higher rather than lower funding costs . 
  the problem with the unemployment-insurance idea is it would require the politically challenging harmonization of the eurozone 's highly divergent labor-market rules and welfare systems . 
  what both proposals show is that it is very hard to find a halfway house between the current eurozone setup , in which there is limited risk-sharing , and a full political union that would allow brussels far greater oversight of national budgets and labor-market and welfare policies . 
  this task is made harder by the need to avoid changes to the eu treaties , which might trigger referendums in many countries , where public appetite is limited for the transfers of sovereignty needed to underpin deeper fiscal integration , let alone any willingness in germany and other northern european countries to pool debts . 
  that could limit the overhauls to little more than german finance minister wolfgang sch\u00e4uble 's current proposal to turn the esm into a european monetary fund with increased powers to enforce the eurozone 's existing rules . 
  would this be so bad ? 
  in economic terms , perhaps not . 
  the contrasting fortunes of postcrisis spain and ireland with the sluggish recoveries of italy and portugal should caution against blaming the eurozone 's problems on a lack of fiscal transfers -- as opposed to weak domestic policies . 
  evidence from the u.s. suggests the importance of fiscal transfers in stabilizing a currency union can be overstated : private capital flows help smooth around two-thirds of shocks to regional output , compared with 13 % by fiscal transfers , according to the european central bank . 
  that suggests the eurozone 's priority should be strengthening its banking systems and delivering overhauls that would improve cross-border investment flows . 
  nonetheless , mr. macron 's political imperative remains , and the fate of the eurozone may now hinge on his success . 
  no wonder he is beating a path to berlin . 
  just in case : ----- ** defiant orban encourages hungarians to say no to brussels ** * prime minister hardens anti-eu stance despite country 's reliance on bloc 's funding * lajos nanassy is sick and tired of what he sees as western european hypocrisy . 
  the 77-year-old hungarian folk singer , who sports a thick moustache , says the eu is soft on refugees , holds too much power and should stop pushing hungary around . 
  `` germans , belgians and french ; they all accuse hungarians of racism and yet they have the most notorious records in history , '' he declares . 
  mr nanassy was attending a crowded public meeting in support of the multibillion forint `` stop brussels ! '' campaign launched by hungarian prime minister viktor orban . 
  a publicly funded billboard advertising blitz and questionnaire sent to more than 8m hungarians has warned them of an `` unholy alliance '' of eu bureaucrats , human rights groups and the billionaire investor george soros , all intent on killing jobs , raising taxes and flooding hungary with migrants . 
  `` they dream of a world without borders , '' szilard nemeth , a senior government mp told the audience at csepel island -- a post-industrial budapest suburb , dotted with abandoned communist-era factories and apartment blocks ringed by overgrown fields . 
  mr orban late last month promised his centre-right political allies in brussels that he would end the `` constant attacks on brussels '' -- and a crackdown on foreign universities that has sparked an eu lawsuit . 
  but the increasingly populist prime minister , who has sparked controversy with his illiberal reforms , has shown little sign of reversing course . 
  this month , he has instead intensified his anti-eu campaign , but rather than leaving the eu -- an idea most hungarians oppose -- mr orban insists he wants to recast the bloc in a more conservative form . 
  analysts say he hopes to halt a slide in approval ratings by mobilising his core voters against meddlesome brussels elites . 
  ahead of parliamentary elections due by next april , he hopes this rhetoric will help his fidesz party see off a threat from nationalist rivals such as the far-right jobbik party . 
  in this environment , politicians in brussels who criticise mr orban directly run the risk of playing into his hands -- by increasing his appeal to nationalist voters . 
  last week , frans timmermans , european commission vice-president , in an interview with die zeit accused mr orban of using anti-semitic tones in comments about mr soros at the european parliament . 
  hungary 's foreign minister in return called on him to resign . 
  `` george soros is a speculator and it 's not anti-semitic to say that -- it 's the truth , '' mr nemeth told his grey-haired audience , which spilled out the back of the csepel community hall and into a car park . 
  he pressed a button and up flashed a picture of european commission president jean-claude juncker embracing mr soros with a kiss on the cheek , prompting a chorus of boos and groans from the audience . 
  at first glance , csepel appears to be an unlikely hotbed of eurosceptism ; what little new development has come courtesy of brussels . 
  a new harbour , roads and a municipal water treatment plant were built with hundreds of millions of euros in eu grants and loans . 
  but attitudes have shifted dramatically since 2003 , when 83.8 per cent of voters supported hungary 's entry into the european union . 
  although hungary has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of eu funds , incomes have failed to converge with western standards . 
  mr orban rejects the idea that lucrative eu funds -- worth $ 5.6 bn or more than 5 per cent of output in 2015 -- mean he should support eu decisions he disagrees with .

  `` we ran out of patience some time ago , '' says frank engel , a luxembourgish mep and orban critic . 
  he says members of the european parliament will this week invoke an `` article 7.1 resolution '' -- a procedure designed to halt a breach of the eu 's founding democratic values , one that could ultimately lead to the suspension of hungary 's voting rights . 
  the procedure is an unprecedented step , and would almost certainly be vetoed by poland , which is the subject of a separate `` rule of law dialogue '' with the commission . 
  mr timmermans has cautioned against invoking the procedure prematurely . 
  he wants the eu to find new ways to harness relative high public support in its eastern members and has released a four-page rebuttal of the hungarian government 's claims , available on the commission 's website . 
  istvan hegedus , president of the hungarian europe society , wants the commission to go further and launch its own advertising campaign to rebut mr orban 's claims . 
  but eu officials shy away from such a public confrontation with a member state , meaning few hungarians hear the brussels perspective . 
  among fidesz ' core supporters , like those at csepel , eu criticism of mr orban only makes them more committed . 
  `` we should n't care what the west says about us anyway -- soon it will be a crime to say we are even hungarian , '' said one woman in her sixties . 
  mr nemeth urged the attendees to channel their energy into filling out some of the eight million surveys that have been sent to households asking them how to respond to `` attacks '' from brussels . 
  `` vikor orban defended hungary in brussels , '' he told them . 
  `` now he needs you to strengthen his hand . '', 
  public housing but individual apartments are either privately owned or owned by the municipality of moscow ( i.e. 
  social housing ) . 
  it depends . 
  a lot of first gen 5 storeys ( the ones that were built of concrete plates ) are in terrible conditions . 
  on top of that , really , really bad design . 
  stalin 's era brick buildings , on the other hand , are way better and , imo , simply should be fixed / renovated . 
  that 's the funniest part . 
  they ( as in the gov ` t ) do n't go into details . 
  seems like that as of now it remains a purely political decision . 
  short answer : nobody knows it yet . 
  hence the fuss . 
  edit : a bit longer answer : the renovation program is nothing new , actually . 
  old concrete 5-storeys ( `` kruschevkas '' ) in moscow have been demolished non-stop for more than 30 years now . 
  from time to time it becomes a problem . 
  for instance , most people do n't want to be relocated to more distant districts ( because of the property prices that may significantly vary from district to district ) . 
  the government has laid out a massive renovation plan that potentially may affect up to 20 % of moscow households . 
  many people are not happy with that , b/c they expect abuses of all kinds and rightly so . 
  i could n't care less about whoever said it , it is simply not true .
