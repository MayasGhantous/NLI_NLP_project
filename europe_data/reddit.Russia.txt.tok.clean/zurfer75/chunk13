  last president elections were rigged . 
  last municipal elections were rigged . 
   is still very popular who said that ? 
  pocked pollsters `` levada-centre '' followed by bbc and pew said 86 % . 
  why not 146 % then ? 
  they could say anything without consequences , because there is no way to make an independent poll in russia . 
  foreign ( = independent ) agencies is not allowed to do their work anymore . 
  you can still hate us , we do n't care . 
  hate is a basic human right . 
  unfortunately , one day we might start to hate you back . 
  it 's a very single thing that give me the creeps . 
  that would be the day when shit will hit the fan . 
  at this time , for real . 
  aww , thank you for posting this !, 
  i 'm fond of irish music since prehistoric era !, 
  i think it was about 25 years ago when i saw `` the pogues '' ( or maybe `` dubliners '' ) on russian tv for a first time . 
  not so long ago i 've been listening to `` floggin ' molly '' on repeat for a month , haha . 
   top russian writer ... of whom i 've never heard about , as a russian ? 
  ignorant me , ok :(  `` the instinct of self-preservation kicked in immediately . 
  the formula for saving any dictatorship is universal : create an enemy ; start a war . 
  the state of war is the regime 's elixir of life , '' the writer says . 
  yeah , no . 
  war with ukraine was planned decade ago . 
  rapid annexation of crimea was too effective and clean to be spontaneous , and so on . 
  that title ... & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  i feel like i should give some perspective from our side of the fence . 
  you need n't read it if you came here only for bitching about evil russia . 
  personally , i do n't give two shits about ukraine/crimea and its inhabitants , regardless of their ethnicity . 
  crimean tatars = / = tatars . 
  the former are descendants of indigenous tribes that lived under rule of ottomans ( turks ) ; the latter were conquered by moscow centuries ago and became russia 's 2nd largest minority . 
  both are muslims . 
  crimean tatars were accused of collaboration with nazis , along with many others from caucasus regions . 
  uncle joe sent them on vacation in sunny siberia . 
  in the 90s ( ? ), 
  they returned to crimea , it belonged to ukraine yet . 
  there they made friends with muslim escapees from chechnya etc. 
  tatars were grabbing lands , chechens were raping white girls , i.e. , business was as usual . 
  russian tv was whining and bitching about those issues all the time , accusing kiev that it did n't bat an eye . 
  to be honest , i have no idea if it was true or not . 
  probably , kiev have n't had an idea what to do with that , as moscow did at the same time . 
  however , point of view of media was n't positive in russia . 
  years have passed . 
  by the beginning of this year things were settled , more or less . 
  despite that fact , hive mind in russia has n't changed . 
  crimean tatars are still being viewed like dangerous muslim insurgents ( or , at least , friends of these kind ) . 
  mejlis was hostile to rufed from the start . 
  it was only question of time until regime crack down . 
  seems like time has come . 
  * ps : as usual i 'm sorry for my english and the wall of text :( *, 
  do you really believe in that ? 
  what do you think : how many people would choose / r/science over / r/aww ? 
  huh , i was making fun of a friend of mine . 
  i was like : `` hey , do you know that orbits of the moon and the sun will intersect in 2012 ? 
  the moon would be destroyed !, 
  along with all of us ! '' . 
  she was like : `` o_o for real ?? 
  what should we do now ? '' . 
  she was n't stupid , btw . 
  she just was n't aware of the distance between one thing and another . 
  now / u/executivemonkey is blacklisted . 
  good luck with mortgage loan next time !, 
  my favorite links : [ third of russians think sun spins round earth : poll ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/02/11/science-us-russia-poll-education-science-iduktre71a5b920110211 ) [ 1 in 4 americans believe the sun revolves around the earth ] ( http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/imageo/2014/02/17/1-in-4-americans-believe-sun-revolves-around-the-earth/#.u_3t6pmsyso ) in addition , billions of people believe in existence of long bearded imaginary friends . 
  human beings are mostly idiots , get over it , haha . 
  i 'd bet money on our lizard overlords . 
  i agree it 's hard to believe that it was intentional . 
  thanks for being so kind . 
  an anecdotal evidence : a friend of mine was told to avoid eu countries . 
  she is a state worker from hmm nevermind . 
  so she went on vacation to well-known muslim resort . 
  she told me it was fine and classy , btw . 
  the olympic village was built in a shitty part of the coastline . 
  dirty sea , bad beaches . 
  i guess all these hotels are expensive as hell . 
  that 's why it was abandoned - companies just ca n't afford maintenance . 
  he 's got a ** model ** of su-35 fighter jet . 
  just a souvenir . 
  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_canadian  in 2011 , there were an estimated 1,209,085 persons of full or partial ukrainian origin residing in canada _____ http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainians_in_russia  the official census in 2010 reported that 1.9 million ukrainians were living in russia _____ seems like mr poroshenko is n't good at math . 
  only 17 % of rufed citizens have had a passport that is required to travel abroad . 
  that means that 83 % could n't leave russia , even if they want to . 
  78 % are yet to travel abroad even for a single time . 
  nuff said . 
  [ source ] ( http://politota.d3.ru/comments/598350/#11967267 ) , sorry , it 's in russian . 
  i find that correlation between 86 % of regime supporters and 83 % of people who do n't have a passport says more about the roots of problem than anything else . 
   i 'm ukrainian ...  ... i was told by a tour guide ... my life will be in danger if you 're ukrainian then i came from the moon . 
  stop telling lies about my town , please . 
  maybe moscow is n't the best place on earth but speaking any foreign language is not a threat to life here . 
  emm , i do n't know maybe i was n't clear ... 
  i 've just said that gay propaganda in russia never was a thing . 
  we 've had plenty of gay/lesbian clubs/bars in moscow and spb , personally i used to go there with my ex because there was far more safe instead of regular clubs . 
  but in the case of promoting such a thing like a ` gay lifestyle ' ... you 'd rather find another country . 
  there 's too much animosity towards minorities . 
  slavic relationship for ages : hopefully the neighbor 's life could get even worse than mine . 
  as if post employees have got time to stare at these stamps or mail is being sorted by hand in msk/spb ... 
  i do n't get the whole outcry about gay propaganda . 
  it did n't exist regardless of the law . 
  i guess the backward mentality bears far more responsibility than legal ban . 
  yep , shit is getting real . 
  you 've clearly described a life in ussr , but ruined life = / = life in gulag . 
  you know , a year ago i 'd say that things are not so bad . 
  but today , after maidan , when regime went full retard i 'd rather wait until winter coming and see what will happen .
