  prices are going up so fast , including fuel price ( +7 % from january ) , i doubt that people are going to throw away their own life to a trash can . 
  crimea is not worth it . 
  immigration from russia is not so easy , but brain drain is a real thing . 
  given a chance , young professional would likely flee . 
  it 's not about regime though . 
  ahh , you 're too kind to me . 
  let me another six months and i 'll show you the class  sorry , i 'm drunk . 
  well , i 'm in touch with approximately 100 lads and gals in moscow . 
  no one support putin , no one is supporting war with ukraine . 
  but , unfortunately , it 's moscow , we 're irrelevant to russian hive mind . 
  yes , permission to travel to poland or east germany ~ ~ of ~ ~ or even bulgaria was a sign of huge luck at soviets ' time !, 
  i remember , instead of moscow or spb let alone russia they had food , clothes and even electronics !, 
  my first portable player was bought in bulgaria , i was a luckiest asshole in my class . 
  yes , it 's proven what late ussr have had political prisoners . 
  but calling it as ` gulag ' is a blatant exaggeration and insult to the memory of those who were killed in the real gulag . 
  btw , i 've read `` archipelag gulag '' of solzhenitsyn mmm let me think in the end of 80s so it need n't bother about my awareness of the crimes of the stalin regime . 
  op has some questions about the certain situation in the present . 
  i prefer to avoid childish speculation . 
  probably you should try to do the same . 
  thanks you for clarification . 
  i feel like i should n't touch that problem , because people would n't even read the rest of a comment . 
  buzz words such as `` gulag '' , `` stalin '' or `` cold war '' could only trigger another ranting about ` what evil russians/commies did to my country ' . 
  hell , as if we have no other issues to discuss on this thread . 
  i have no idea about romania , i talked about moscow . 
  there were numerous persecutions on dissent persons who was loud enough to disturb regime . 
  but it 's definitely not a `` kitchen talking '' case . 
  i do n't need to ask anyone . 
  i remember the 80s very clear . 
  also , gulag is not exist since the end of stalin era . 
  evil commies are in the past , get over it , mate , you 're tilting at windmills . 
  for instance , my grandma was going mad every time when someone accidentally mentioned communism and soviet regime . 
  she just hated it all and did not hesitate to express such opinion in public . 
   ... cold war era regime ... scared to talk to your neighbor you are confusing the stalin era ( direct persecution of opposition ) with the cold war era ( absence of free speech in public ) . 
  an idiomatic expression `` kitchen talking '' has its roots in the latter ; i mean , during , say , 80s , there was no problem with blaming regime or just bitching about politics . 
  basically , this era has returned because major websites and tv channels are under government control and expressing common pro-regime narrative . 
  as long as you are staying in the web ( `` kitchen talking '' of 21st century ) you are barely noticeable . 
  ___  if you live there , how do you perceive these changes , are they noticeable at all ? 
  tourist industry is falling down ; car sales and production was reduced by 25 % ; food prices are going up ( 10-20 % ) . 
  ___  how is life going ? 
  as funny as the dead man 's smile . 
  ___  how is the political scene going ? 
  in shambles . 
  protesters who 's been participated in 2012 rallies now are sentenced to imprisonment ; the leader of opposition is under house arrest . 
  ___  is putin the true leader of russia , or is he just the tip of the iceberg ? 
  such a good question . 
  i would say that recently he * was * the tip of the iceberg . 
  ____  is russia run by putin/oligarchs/military / all of these ? 
  wow , another good question !, 
  [ here is the interesting article about the issue ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ru&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.newtimes.ru%2farticles%2fdetail%2f86540&amp;edit-text= ) , sorry , only google translate is available . 
  my favorite quotes : * for years government agencies are considering pros and cons of various decisions , now the fsb just `` sells '' threats to the president . 
  * * smart officials , like the head of administration sergei ivanov , have simply excluded themselves from any kind of management . 
  by now their role is reduced to mouthpieces of the president . 
  * ___  what are the chances of a regime change in russia ? 
  speculations about this issue are punishable by 5 years of imprisonment in russia , otherwise i 'd never shut up in this thread . 
  ____ ps : i 'm sorry for the wall of text , also , i 'd like to apologize for my english . 
  pps : [ here 's a facebook post in russian ] ( https://www.facebook.com/serge.sharovdelaunay/posts/627676260684273 ) about economic problems those may lead to bankrupt of rufed in the near future . 
  it says that rufed has to pay a debt of state-owned companies in this year . 
  it 's about $ 220-250 billions . 
  total currency reserves of rufed before adventures in crimea were about $ 450 billions . 
  i have no idea if it 's true or not , you decide . 
  it makes sense but i 'm guessing you 're aware of the fact that main regime lovers ( that 86 fucking percents ) live in regions . 
  yes , there are some caucasus outcasts like chechnya and dagestan but the rest are seem loyal to the center . 
  which parts are to be cut off , vladivostok and spb ? 
  not so much . 
  the population of big [ siberia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siberia ) ( the whole asian part of russia , mind you ) is about 30 millions . 
  at the same time [ area of siberia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siberia#geography ) is larger than , say , [ usa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geography_of_the_united_states ) . 
  it 's just the largest forest on earth . 
  no roads , no towns , only foxes and deer . 
  i doubt that any country is going to risk and colonize this place . 
  if we suck big time here then warm-loving chinese nationals seem to be even less suitable for this task than russians , 
  you do n't read comments , right ? 
  [ here is a beautiful nasa map ] ( http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/55000/55167/earth_lights_lrg.jpg ) , look at this and think again . 
  `` siberia is rich in resources '' , my ass . 
  many countries rich in resources , but in some cases extraction of these resources is not so efficient in terms of economics . 
  if china does n't need this soil for lebensraum then nothing is going to change . 
  they 've already bought these resources and could buy more , what 's a purpose of war in this case ? 
  it 's beyond my understanding . 
  do you believe that chinese nationals are dreaming about living in siberia ? 
  lmao . 
  last time i checked internal migration in china aims to warm south instead of northern china let alone siberia . 
  fyi , control on chinese border is soft enough to almost free traveling up and down . 
  there 's a fuckton of chinese in irkutsk , no one gives two shits . 
  it 's a routine work . 
  you ought to tell the stories on daily basis . 
  i ca n't blame tv crews for little cheating , because no one actually cares about quality and ratings , only narrative has a meaning on state-owned channels . 
  i regret about your family 's losses , seriously . 
  i was n't going to hurt you . 
  no need to argue what current situation is barely manageable . 
  what is happening now is extremely dangerous for all of us . 
  i just ca n't get your point of view : what do you expect ? 
  you can not divide russia along unclear lines ` just for lulz ' . 
  sovereign siberia or far east , huh , it 's fairy tales for our misinformed friends/rivals/whatever in eu . 
  these regions are far more russian than muslim moskvabad of gay finnish spb . 
  whom to cut off from who ? 
  i do n't get it and i bet you feel the same . 
   `` ussrian situation '' which made everyone happy apologies , i do n't buy it . 
  hundreds of thousands refugees were n't happy , tens of thousands were just killed . 
  i lived near by the street that was filled with refugees from karabakh so i 've seen them with my own eyes . 
  i 've known the stories about ethnic cleansings . 
  the road to hell is paved with good intentions .
