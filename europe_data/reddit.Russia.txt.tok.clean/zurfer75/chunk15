  no matter how deep is your desire to see the crash of the reunion , it would n't end peacefully . 
  do n't kid yourself . 
  main state owned tv company . 
  been working there in 90s . 
  we used to hang around in the inner yard , you know , to drinking beer or getting high . 
  either it-crew or cg-artists we looked like the hobos at that time . 
  whenever reporters were running out of time they 've been using us to get `` an interview with random guys in the street '' . 
  and the guys were like : * `` go ahead , mates , tell us about the football '' * and we were like : * `` what the hell is the football ? 
  '' * and the guys were like : * `` god damn , spartak ( moscow team ) lost the game !, 
  '' * and we were like : * `` so , are we going to play sadness , right ? 
  '' * ... done . 
  nothing really changed . 
  funny to hear that alma mater is still classy , haha . 
  [ that 's why !, 
  yeah , right . 
  putin is a single author of the economic miracle in russia . 
  when i was living on $ 200 a month in 1998 it was my fault . 
  when my monthly income increased up to $ 2000 in four years it was either an oil price or putin himself gave me a hand . 
  all hail to the oil glorious leader !, 
  yes , our government is n't helping much . 
  probably they are scared that we would flee away and leave them high and dry , haha . 
  yeah , blind hatred always comes in handy when you 're looking for a way to alienate the people . 
  lots of westernized russians got used to such attitude but , out of curiosity , how are you going to handle the rest ? 
  mind you , he 's got a ~ ~ son ~ ~ heir to the throne . 
  copy-paste of my comment from / r/worldnews ___ screw you , op !, 
  let 's see that a footer of the page says :  \u00a9 2011-2014 \u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0430\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e `` the russian times '' . 
  * 03 sep 2014 ( ** 4 days ago ** ) this website ( the russian times ) was registered as a media by the state censorship agency `` roskomnadzor '' . 
  let 's make it clear . 
  the website , that op is promoting here , was made for only one purpose : to discredit well-known news media [ `` the moscow times '' ] ( http://themoscowtimes.com ) . 
  the latter has been operating on hospitable finnish soil and remains one of the few respected media which provides information about russia at first hand . 
  it was predictable that state-owned propaganda would try to ruin a reputation of their rival . 
  do n't be late for the last bus from olgino , op . 
  ___ edit : citation index ( yandex analogue of pagerank ) of the page = 375 . 
  [ link ] ( http://yaca.yandex.ru/yca/cy/ch/therussiantimes.com/ ) , no one knows about this site . 
  for instance , ci of lenta.ru ( one of the major news outlets ) = 21000 . 
  ps : do n't buy into propaganda b/s , guys !, 
  it 's true but war is going on . 
  both sides are famous by avoidance of civilian casualties and accuracy of shelling . 
  being a refugee is a bitter lot . 
  overwhelming majority of these people were born there . 
  they continue to watch russian tv and expect a better life under rufed influence . 
  they are not going to run away from their land . 
  tbh , i was watching local tv last night ; if you believe it then everything seems alright on our soil . 
  it 's hard to wait a serious analysis from simple minded e ukr inhabitants . 
  knowing a kind of people who lives in the area i would n't bet on their adequacy . 
  `` well done , guys !, 
  '' , `` hold on !, 
  '' , `` hooray ! '' . 
  tanks , what a joy !, 
  i do n't get it . 
  in their shoes i would n't have been so glad . 
  great plan !, 
  but i bet you 've never been to siberia , dear armchair general , 
  yes , pretty close . 
  of course , you still can travel across the country and even rent an apartment ( illegally ) but you might / might not have some issues . 
  for example , if you have n't registered at the new place yet then you and your relatives ca n't get an access to hospitals , schools and kinder-gardens . 
  cop in the street might fine you or demand a bribe etc. 
  checkpoints vary widely . 
  for instance , on a route [ from moscow to maykop ] ( https://www.google.ru/maps/dir/%d0%9c%d0%be%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b2%d0%b0/%d0%9c%d0%b0%d0%b9%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%bf/@47.1354919,42.2408418,6z/data=!4m19!4m18!1m10!1m1!1s0x46b54afc73d4b0c9:0x3d44d6cc5757cf4c!2m2!1d37.6173!2d55.755826!3m4!1m2!1d38.9580094!2d45.0477076!3s0x40f04f6fb44602fb:0xaebe41b8b877abd5!1m5!1m1!1s0x40f0cce5ee08a45d:0x500f351ac87184d1!2m2!1d40.083333!2d44.6!3e0?hl=ru ) i remember a border between moscow oblast and tula oblast , millerovo ( rostov oblast ) , kuzhevka checkpoint and customs ( krasnodarsky ** krai ** entry ) , autonomous ** republic ** of adigea border ( instant ass rape if you drive a car with tanned windows ) . 
  tl ; dr : oblast border crossings are almost transparent , krai/republic border security is high especially in southern regions . 
  joke about necessity of learning tadzhik language in moscow has ceased to be * funny * a few years ago :\\, 
  it 's a matter of preservation of the local culture ** and ** communication . 
  can you get a work permit in an anglophone country without basic knowledge of english ? 
  that 's it . 
  i 'd rather choose russia as example of xenophobia in society than baltic states . 
  holodomor has happened in 1930s . 
  tbh , at the same time stalin * deliberately * killed even more russians than ukrainians but about half of modern russians are n't aware of this fact , or prefer not to know . 
  do you see what i mean ? 
  i guess that only russian blue collars from the ex-soviet republics are dreaming about this . 
  it tells alot about their mental abilities . 
  if i were in their shoes i 'd love to have studied local language and got a passport at last . 
  exactly . 
  with ` brothers ' like that , who needs enemies ? 
  my ex and i have been hanging out there for a month driving around daily . 
  if you have local car plates cops pay no attention to you . 
  can confirm , local customs and [ security checkpoints ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/security_checkpoint ) are a country-wide reality . 
  many regions are definitely hostile towards each other . 
  it 's hard to expect any changes here . 
  a few years ago i dated a girl from northern caucasus region . 
  when we were arguing about whose car we ought to choose to visit her hometown , she had strictly enlightened me that travelling there on a car registered in moscow is a really bad idea , haha . 
  i can only hope that he is n't just full of hot air and his words matter . 
   but people somehow forget that ukraine is unique , because we gave away one of the largest stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the world in exchange for some vague security guarantees . 
  first off , ` stockpile of nuclear weapons ' was just a pile of war-ready nuclear * materials * which have n't actual military use due to absence of launch and detonation codes . 
  west was deeply concerned about a chance of losing control because islamists and blah-blah . 
  ukraine or russia were kinda out of money after the ussr split . 
  the us and allies offered money in exchange to give away nukes because in that time both countries could barely afford maintenance and security . 
  nukes went to russia and during 90s us had beed paying their own bucks for security systems and control . 
  allies , ua an ru have signed a memorandum generally meant that ` we 're all friendz foreva ' . 
  by now this treaty is broken . 
  that 's it . 
  sorry for the wall of text . 
  i understand your hatred of subhuman russians including children but i ca n't help to remind you that hostage-takers did not allow hostages to get ** any ** water . 
  that was a reason along with a hot weather ( +30 -35 \u00b0 c iirc ) why some kids tried to drink their own urine and sweat etc. 
  since a human being barely could get along more than 3 days without water special forces have no choice . 
  all these kids and stuff would be dead due to dehydration very soon . 
  been participated in anti-putsch uprising in 1991 so i 've seen at first hand the turmoil in the city . 
  also , do n't forget shelling of moscow white house in 1993 . 
  - good news : russians do n't like crimea annexation anymore . 
   * according to the august poll `` levada-center '' , the number of russians who admired attachment the crimea to russia declined for four months from 23 % to 16 % . 
  the amount of people who has been supporting direct military involving of russia to ukraine conflict has also shrunk from 36 % in march to 13 % in august .
