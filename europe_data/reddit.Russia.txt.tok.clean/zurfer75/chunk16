   federal agency for press banned yekaterinburg musicians from tour to romania festival because their performance includes either jazz music and poetry . 
  `` this is american music . 
  why should n't you try to use russian music during performance ? '', 
  - the organizers of the trip argue to musicians . 
  you 're welcome !, 
  btw , i also had no idea about etymology of ` unitaz ' and ` kedi ' . 
  i like an idealism of / u/3dom but apparently any major clashes in the big cities or country-wide turmoil would lead to military dictatorship , hopefully collaborative one . 
  time has drastically changed since 1991 along with population of the cities . 
  an alternative is economical and political isolation and slow death but i suppose it would be the worst scenario ever for the world and russia . 
  unitaz = toilet kedi = sneakers jeep = any suv pampersi = diapers jacuzzi = hot tub scotch = duct tape plastir = med plaster ... and many more : [ ^ google ^ translate ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ru&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.adme.ru%2ftvorchestvo-reklama%2fbrendy-stavshie-naricatelnymi-23684%2f&amp;edit-text= ), 
  ` slogans ' . 
  you said that . 
  at this point , the whole turmoil looks like a blackmail the kiev in order to install some regional puppets . 
  both countries remain far more cynical and cold-blooded than needed to start full scale war or reincarnation of some b/s . 
  til again . 
  ps : 2 vowels + 1 consonant = 12 symbols . 
  i 'd like to remind you that the soviet union was broken to pieces in the middle of reforms which were accompanied by the rejection of ideology . 
   you do n't need it when you have a cult of personality like the one putin is creating around himself . 
  who knows . 
  ` your world narrative ' seems to be too fragile . 
  i 'm afraid to break it down if i would try to remember something positive from our horrible past ... 
  personally , i guess russia does n't want to officially recognize the soviet occupation simply because they 're afraid of compensation claims from the baltic countries , poland and the rest . 
  it could be huge reparation , even more than the budget of the rf though . 
  oppressive system was run by the soviets . 
  it 's kinda weird , the beginning of the wwii saved a half of my family . 
  both grandfathers returned from the war injured but still alive unlike almost all of their relatives were ` disappeared ' in end of 1930s ... in moscow . 
  i 've answered to ` forgetting the past ' [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2f3pkb/russians_of_reurope_are_sanctions_affecting_your/ck64tv2 ) . 
  why do you think that current aggression is the same what happened before ? 
  the behavior of the ussr has been driven by ideology , expansionism and fear of war . 
  what is on the list of modern russia ? 
  - ideology [ ] - expansionism [ x ] ( * ) - fear of war [ ] * crimea . 
  seems like no one knows what to do with it . 
  state-owned companies are barred from operating here ; yesterday 's blackout ; absence of the road to peninsula etc. 
  no , dead people are not relevant to the present . 
  they 're dead and have nothing to do with our life . 
  it 's a history and we have to analyse this and make a conclusion how to sort out the present situation . 
  edit : i do see the difference between a history and jingoistic patriotism , the latter is nothing more than old flag waving . 
  maybe i ` went full retard ' , you decide . 
  who is talking about cheering the soviet 's ? 
  i really did n't . 
  also it does n't exist anymore that 's why i consider a history of this country as irrelevant to the present war . 
  also , i 'm just curious why all the good thing we did it was soviet 's merit while all the bad things attributed to russians . 
  does anyone aware of the policy of renouncing russian identity conducted by bolsheviks in order to cripple imperialistic ( = tsarist russia ) ideology of the russian empire ? 
  stalin put it back right before the war only , btw , because it has been needed to encourage the majority of the people . 
  believe or not but my own family would be significantly bigger than now if uncle joesph and soviet 's were n't exist at all . 
  i regret about losses of your family but it does n't change anything . 
  we should get over the past , that 's my point . 
  it 's not ironic because we 're not ` his own people ' , the government does n't give two shits . 
  actually , this move seems to be effective for the regime 's purposes . ', 
  - average vasya , where is all the food ? ', 
  ' - no more food . 
  we 're under sanctions ! ', 
  do you see how it works ? 
  just do n't use adjective together with ` sanctions ' and majority will forget who is responsible for this very soon . 
  forget about old iran . 
  in two or three years the west will get the brand new version of iran this time fully equipped with nukes , icmbs , sams and modern aircraft ... just located a few thousand miles to the north . 
  it should be funny , should n't it ? 
  well , their [ website ] ( http://moscow-hypermarket.ru/gipermarket/ashan/ ) says it 's a french company . 
  ps : til . 
  i thought it was something armenian because word ' \u0410\u0448\u0430\u043d ' sounds like this for my ears , lol . 
   both warring states are automatically a boogieman for each other . 
  ^ ftfy . 
  ^ no ^ thanks ^ needed . 
  dehumanization and use of the derogatory terms are working well on either side . 
  i find it ridiculous how keyboard warriors who sided with ukraine love to remind about holodomor / two millions raped german or polish ( i dont remember ) girls / whatever . 
  participants are fucking dead already . 
  how can it be relevant to the present ? 
  the `` fascist nazi junta '' thing is the same shit invented for the idiots living on this side of the border . 
  the mythical ` ancestors ' should n't ever bring up in conversation because it does n't contribute to living in the present . 
  let 's be clear : many of them were real assholes regardless of the country . 
  35 years of sanctions brought a lot of positive changes to iran . 
  now it 's secular , democratic and rich country . 
  given a chance , an average citizen does n't even try to run away from there !, 
  your comment was about ` canada started invading ' not ` us invades canada ' . 
  i hope you see the difference . 
  to be honest i have no idea what would you do if , say , canada tries to annex russian part of arctica . 
  you have no neighbor to invade thus your words are just hot air , 
  considering the last elections which were obviously rigged , an average russian has nothing to do with the situation either in russia or ukraine . 
  that 's why current regime refuses to admit its involving in recent military actions . 
  this is not for europe , it 's for domestic audience . 
  there is a big difference between bombing boogieman chechens to dust and conventional war against ukraine . 
  thanks a lot , fixed it !, 
  i have yet to notice severe changes except for lack of some foodstuffs in the big-box retailers metro cash & carry and ~ ~ ashan ~ ~ auchan . 
  also , the value of rouble is falling down at a fast rate . 
   but that is still a short life for a developed country yes , it is . 
  always glad to help .

  ftfy, 
  how do you intend to leave comments in this sub if you 've chosen such a nickname ? 
  . . or someone might consider russians as an offshoot of kievan rus inhabitants . 
  such a reasoning does n't make sense in 21st century . 
  my point is that russian politics have nothing to do with an ethnic division , no matter what they say to an average citizen . 
  we have to grow up and prevent ourselves from falling into nationalistic rhetoric .
