  nothing good could come from that shit . 
  [ here 's a map of haplogroups in europe . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ooykquo.png ) i 'd rather say there 's no big difference between eastern slavs . 
  have you ever read [ the latest article ] ( http://aillarionov.livejournal.com/725287.html ) of illarionov , which is called `` putin-merkel pact '' ? 
  i know , even a broken clock is right twice a day , but what he said makes sense , imo . 
  if only i could be so optimistic as you . 
  by now i feel myself being cornered even in the internet , haha . 
  i like how you replaced the word `` russia '' with an acronym `` rufed '' . 
  unfortunately , it wo n't work . 
  from the point of view of western public that is predominantly represented here , the difference between russia , russian government and russians is indistinguishable . 
  i believe the word choice of an average redditor between `` the russian government is responsible for what is happening '' and `` dirty rooskie savages did it '' depends more on the politeness than understanding the distance from a random guy up to the top officials . 
  no , he 's just an [ useful idiot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/useful_idiot ) . 
  do n't insult us en masse , haha . 
  [ here ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=ru&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fslon.ru%2frussia%2fsudit_po_russki_za_chto_v_rossii_mozhno_sest_a_za_chto_prostyat-1145645.xhtml ) is the recent but badly google-translated article about the consequences for protesters . 
  two guys - 3.5 years of imprisonment , one guy - 2.5 years , a girl - 3.25 years of probation . 
  the same judge has previously sentenced an ex-representative accused of ** raping 24yo girl ** to 4 years of ** probation ** . 
  any questions left ? 
   did schools become worse ? 
  yes , unfortunately . 
   everyone with brains or money leave the country ? 
  not everyone , but brain drain has been happening since ussr collapse . 
  money is in the offshore banks because of unfair and unpredictable taxation . 
  the industry has destroyed because of broken ties between the facilities . 
  in a simple way , the planned economy ( during ussr ) has a fundamental difference from the free market : customers , suppliers and developers were imposed on the manufacturing by the certain ministries . 
  just imagine ( ofc , for instance ) : given a chance to open a restaurant you 're not allowed to choose a dishes in a menu , to make your own decision about personnel salaries , to decide which farmer would supply you eggs for a fucking omelette ... because , say , town authorities will decide it instead of you . 
  will it be effective and competitive ? 
  i guess it wo n't in the long run because of lack of the interest . 
  once said authorities had disappeared then the whole business fucked up , that actually happened in russia right after ussr collapse . 
   the only thing the country is able to manufacture on their own is propaganda . 
  let me remind you that one of the seven [ millennium prize problems ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/millennium_prize_problems ) was solved by the [ russian scientist ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grigori_perelman ) while the rest still remain unsolved . 
  seems like you 're trying hard to generalize the russian population . 
  according to your flag it is not surprising though . 
  [ about ratings and polls in russia ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ds1j0/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_17082014/cjukf4a ) . 
  check it out . 
  but we won in 1991 , did n't we ? 
  :d today is an anniversary by the way , i guess i will never forget that day . 
   levada is n't too reliable that 's exactly what i 'm writing about . 
   among people i know nobody think `` ukrainian adventure '' will have positive effect i guess anecdotal evidence does n't matter in this case but i have to say that i 've never met any of hardline putin 's supporters . 
  i wonder where they are . 
   it was enforced more in some places than others could n't agree more . 
  dad had a long hair and beard but no one gave a shit about him . 
  i had been in a punk movement in the last years of the ussr and did n't have any problems with authorities too . 
  by then we had encountered problems with the young local thugs - yeah , it was tough sometimes . 
  i guess moscow and spb were far more liberal in the case . 
  ` opinion polls : interest , confidence and fears ' by levada-center : [ google translate ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=ru&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.levada.ru%2f18-08-2014%2foprosy-obshchestvennogo-mneniya-interes-doverie-i-strakhi&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  previously published results of this company are often being cited on reddit ( putin 's approval ratings have exceeded 80 % etc ) . 
  q : * are you able to freely express your opinion about the polices pursued by the country 's leadership ( i.e. 
  putin ) ? 
  * a : ( august , 2014 ) yes , i always am 38 % yes , i am , but with some limitations 28 % no , i 'm not ( i 'm afraid or feel uncomfortable ) 6 % i do n't need it 26 % it 's hard to give an answer 3 % ok , we have a quarter of the population which does n't give a fuck about politics . 
  ( un ) fortunately , 38 % do n't afraid of government or they 're just idiots . 
  third part is in doubts or they 're being scared ( good for the latter ! ) . 
  q : * could one who has been a critic during the interview be harassed by the authorities ? 
  * a : ( august , 2014 ) definitely yes 6 % it is likely 22 % unlikely 44 % completely impossible 17 % hard to answer 11 % almost half is in doubts ; only a few percent ( 17 % ) truly believe that they can take a part in polls without fear of persecution . 
  tl ; dr : the results of the recent polls in russia are questionable . 
  is it good or bad ? 
  time will tell . 
  no , it was n't  my dad was kind of hippie so he used to wear jeans all the time . 
  well , i 've answered . 
  nuclear artillery shells were allowed , probably nothing has changed . 
  [ wiki : us/nato analogues ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_artillery ) fyi . 
  iirc , military doctrine of ussr did n't allow using nuclear weapons in the conventional war , except tactical nuclear artillery shells : [ ru-wiki ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%af%d0%b4%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d1%81%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%8f%d0%b4 ) . 
  according to the link above it had an explosive yield equivalent to 2.5 kiloton of tnt . 
  if you ask about the delirium of the old blogger who wrote the article ... 
  i ca n't take it seriously without an evidence . 
  it 's just words atm . 
  nothing wrong , nothing good . 
  he 's just a fucking blogger . 
  hell , there are many smart and reasonable bloggers and writers and they are just making noise . 
  we need politics , like navalny , whose team did things and keeps doing things . 
  can you read ? 
   us/nato ** nuclear ** forces nukes , not tanks . 
  you 're absolutely right !, 
  russia is just mirroring us/nato nuclear forces . 
  russia 's military doctrine is descendant of the ussr doctrine , not to say its copy . 
  details is well known , there were wiki articles , books et cetera . 
  so as blogger in the article is just parroting wiki , op tries to kid us if it were any kind of news . 
  that 's what i wrote . 
  so , do you want to kill 140mils of people including women and children and poor me ? 
  1/5th of them is not russians though . 
  hope you get a boner while dreaming about that , haha . 
  i had no idea that it is so / r/europe before . 
  i agree , it works in both ways . 
  during maidan i felt myself tired of the both russian and ukranian news websites and went to / r/worldnews there was sticky post with the online streams from the square . 
  so i stayed here , haha . 
  children like to tell each other scary tales as well as adults . 
  moscow kids love stories about the black hand or the last red bus ; moscow old dude mr piontkosvky frightens us with stories about black putin who threatens to conquer the world while white putin , as we know , sits in a dark dungeon in chains . 
  sorry , i 'm kidding because i feel nervous myself . 
  the problem is warmongering and dehumanization of your ** possible ** opponent . 
  that 's how propaganda works . 
  well , it 's hard to recall any significant ** news ** for , say , last week . 
  i meant real news from ukraine/russia war ( ok , conflict ) . 
  only hot air . 
  got some facts from this [ pdf ; in russian ] ( http://wciom.ru/fileadmin/vybory/duma/duma_5.pdf ) : * sympathy to the ldpr experience mostly very young ( 29 % ) and uneducated ( 28 % ) people . 
  memes both from party campaign slogans and zhirinovsky himself : * we 're for poor , we 're for russians !, 
  * enemy number one for russia is an official !, 
  * russia is for russians !, 
  * russian soldier will wash his boots in the indian ocean !, 
  * do n't lie , do n't fear . ^ [ 1 ] ^ 1 . 
  it 's a variation of the russian jail mantra `` do n't trust , do n't fear , do n't ask ( beg ) . '', 
  sadly , zhirinovsky does n't like the indian ocean no more :(,
