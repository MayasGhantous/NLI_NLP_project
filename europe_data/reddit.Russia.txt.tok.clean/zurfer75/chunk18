  i do n't want to interrupt your circlejerk , ladies & gentlemen , but [ andrey piontkovsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andrey_piontkovsky ) is a blogger from kasparov.ru . 
  i have no idea if he is a good writer of not but his siding with kasparov means that he is just a pure putin-hater and nothing more . 
  i guess he is not able to access to any actual materials from kremlin or ruiling elite . 
  despite that fact that i 'm personally pro-west and pro-navalny i never , never ever will waste my time reading or following these ` oppositioners ' like kasparov or nemtsov . 
  imo , of course . 
  just advice . 
  spb was built to wave a dick to sweden . 
  not in our case . 
  our muslims are savages . 
  i just wish we both are arguing about sauna sex , dude !, 
  no warring , no mess . 
  read tolstoy he is better . 
  i took a part in 1991 coup , we were fighting for our freedom but i doubt were it go so bloodless now :( time has changed . 
  now we have more than two million muslims here . 
  seems like you have no clue haha, 
  dude if moscow people were in charge we 've got straight rail from helsinki to vladivostok . 
  because we 'd like to have fun , to trade , to bang girls in sauna . 
  because it 's funny to wave a dick to alaska standing in the eastern docks . 
  orly ? 
  what did spb give ? 
  dude who eventually killed an old slut and went crazy about that . 
  if i met him here , in moscow , i 'd rather told : `` fugget about it , dude ! '', 
  and offered him another shot of whiskey . 
  do you see the difference ? 
  it 's an ill city , nothing good comes from there . 
  october revolution is from spb . 
  it 's enough . 
  they do n't want us to party , plain and simple . 
  i guess our government just want us to die because we are too loud : /, 
  we do n't have a hive mind and we do n't have an upper hand here . 
  ask saint-petersburg , they are the cancer of the country . 
  they gave us tsars , lenin and putin . 
  hope they will drown in swamps at last , infamous fucks . 
  well , as far as i 'm sitting in a first row ... 
  it could be funny , after all . 
  civil war , coup d'\u00e9tat , turmoil in moscow , whatsoever . 
  thanks god , whole of my family lives in eu , 
  i guess you are from novosibirsk , ai n't you ? 
  what do your fellows think about this issue now ? 
  i 'd rather call it bad taste . 
  black people are the smallest target of racial hatred in russia . 
  in perm area 20 % declare themselves non-russian , in reality a half or more of the population there is of mixed ethnicity . 
  they would rather hate each other than a black person from overseas , 
  hardline religious believers can not into fun . 
  they 've already [ ruined ] ( http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/bomb_threats_protests_cancel_marilyn_manson_shows_in_russia ) marylin manson performance . 
  two years ago it was impossible to imagine . 
  [ roscosmos regains control of the gecko sex satellite ] ( http://www.federalspace.ru/20803/ ) : 26 jul 2014 at 08:05 gmt +4 command link to the spacecraft `` foton-m '' # 4 was restored .

  i 've just found the price ... 
  monthly fee of the rent of an ad pillar is about 130 euros . 
  in perm . 
  as it belongs to a private company there may be either obama or ` happy birthday , honey !, 
  sincerely , kolya ' . 
  are you nuts to take it seriously , guys ? 
  icmb does n't need satellites to navigate , it 's just another option together with stars/the moon . 
  also , submarines and rockets are examples of the [ faraday cage ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/faraday_cage ) . 
  basically , any military equipment is emp-protected more or less . 
  roads were n't dry six months a year that time . 
  thanks to global warming , in recent years things were/are going to be better and better . 
  it is not an insanity  when you start at 10pm you 're a lucky if you reach relatively free road by midnight . 
  after passing by blockposts , suburban dwellers and village zombie loons you finally get an opportunity to drive little faster and come to bed at last . 
  perhaps i was not clear : i meant km/h . 
  of course i was only speeding at federal ( m ## - that 's what you could see in the video ) ` out of town ' roadways . 
  shit happens when a gf lives so far away and you are obliged to drive and see her on weekends ... and then go back home . 
  it is not so complicated as you think . 
  winter tires , careful steering and slow braking . 
  i used to drive at 130-150 at winter nights because it 's easier when the road is free . 
  everyone who 's worn st. george 's ribbon this year . 
  video of the accident : [ youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsu6ngi8j7w&amp;t=57 ) photo of the ` truck ' : [ imgur ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tmi4yxc.jpg ), 
   they need to have something that they are proud of good point . 
  communist ideology does n't exist for decades . 
  despite the popular opinion that the new ideology is something religious it 's simply not true . 
  the attendance of the average people at church is very low except old grannies living in rural areas . 
  on the other hand , new-born nationalism is a very extreme and dangerous way of thinking . 
  current regime plays with it a lot and that is a really scary thing . 
  since e ukraine conflict started i 've been reading through non-public russian blogs . 
  it 'd sound strange but many bloggers accuse the government of an indecision and betrayal of the russian entity . 
  they * are * the minority who * does n't * support current government actions !, 
  what 's in the head of average person who * do * support it ... i do n't even want to know though . 
  probably vacuum . 
  edit : grammar, 
  people are mad because of ukraine/maidan . 
  several months ago it was possible to debate about politics . 
  since then it has been risky . 
  unless you do n't agree with the common statements ( fasist junta in kiev , crimea is ours etc ) you should better shut up . 
  i have no clue how it has happened . 
  many people have relatives in ukraine and count the country as ` another russia ' ; many really jealous because ` an everlasting neighbor ' eventually decided to break away . 
  both reasons are obsolete , of course , but there are places in russia where time has stopped a half of the century ago . 
  many people still think they live in the empire . 
  * the opinion from mordor/behind the enemy line/whatever * putin is just a cover for the dozen families who are really in charge here . 
  none of them is under the spotlight so these sanctions will not hurt a real power . 
  his electorate mostly consists of the low wage people , thus , they would not feel significally worse than now , because they are already underneath the bottom . 
  only the middle-class would be fucked up again . 
  just as planned :| small ~ ~ rant ~ ~ lament here : my mother worked for a company which came under recent sanctions . 
  she has just retired and here we go again - the bank which holds her savings is suffered the same fate . 
  despite that fact i doubt what she would rebelling so as me . 
  i have been studying english since may and i must will have it done by the time when iron curtain come down again :d edit : a word, 
   those two things do n't mix . 
  it could be described as a cultural apartheid . 
  as a muscovite , i do n't feel a connection between me and the rest of the country .
