  russia is the territory marked as `` here be dragons '' and `` inhabited by dog-headed people '' on my map . 
  i 'm half-joking , of course , but such a separation is one of the main problems nonetheless . 
  he 's right on this one . 
  i expected to see varg vikernes in here . 
  speaking seriously , if i were google i 'd rather choose one between thor heyerdahl , nansen or amundsen as the right answer . 
  maybe it 's just me but these three names come to mind first . 
  easy there , cowboy . 
  take a deep breath and calm down a little . 
  as far as i lived through the 80s , 90s and 00s , i feel confident enough to have an opinion and share it from time to time . 
  do n't even get me started about siberia . 
  have you ever been there ? 
  since the fall of the ussr , many places turned into complete shitholes , as they were n't needed out there from the start . 
  meanwhile , the oil-rich regions are doing just fine . 
  it 's not a coincidence , that is how the economy works . 
  whatever it was , the russian north are slowly dying , regardless of efforts to put it back on rails . 
  as for dictatorship ... omitting the fact that any dictatorship shows a worse result in the long run , one of the problems is that human behavior is not predictable . 
  once your dictator lost touch with reality and the country is rolling down the hill . 
  so it goes . 
  and that 's what is going on now . 
   he stole $ 500 000 from the russian people you fucking idiot !, 
  phew . 
  that 's the price of good apartments in moscow . 
  even though it were true ( which i doubt ) i could only conclude that he 's awful at stealing and would make a good president . 
  he has n't done enough to prove his relevance . 
  what did kasparov do apart from talking ? 
  perhaps , he did but i have n't heard anything about that . 
  it 's a bad sign , considering that i 'm at least somewhat interested in the political scene in russia , making certain efforts to find the info . 
  i think that kasparov has about zero credibility left . 
  imo , of course . 
  he fled the country anyway , so his political activity is n't worth bothering about . 
  in the best case it would be navalny but taking into account our famous ` luck ' it would n't rule out strelkov or someone like him . 
  try google translate . 
  2 ) maybe i put it in a wrong way . 
  he remains a nationalist but it 's not the main field of activities anymore . 
  his struggle against corruption is well-known and this is that attracts a lot of supporters . 
  i keep going to these `` racist marches '' ( which are called as russian marches ) , although , for the most part , it 's just a tribute to the past . 
  at least , the last one was clearly disappointing . 
  perhaps , you should read more [ about him ] ( https://navalny.com/ ) . 
  he ceased to be just a `` right-wing guy '' a long time ago . 
  he is the most prominent and promising leader of the opposition , who 's got 27 % of votes in the moscow mayoral elections without a single appearance on tv , by using only the internet and street promotion . 
  in [ a video you 're talking about ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ilxqieemg ) , he simply proposed to ease gun control laws ( it is an idea which i wholeheartedly support ) and made it in a comic style . 
  obviously , he had in mind aggressive men of north caucasus origin , supposedly muslims , who are widely hated for their violent behavior . 
  risking to cause an uproar on this sub , i dare say that the role of the person in charge is quite exaggerated by the west in case of the present-day russia . 
  personally , i 'd like to see navalny as a president , although many others would disagree with me , but that 's not the point . 
  i 'm much more concerned with how easily the power was usurped by a person who appeared out of the blue . 
  our dear leader can rightfully take a latin ` veni vidi vici ' as his motto . 
  so far as we see , it 's completely wrong that the structure of governance has allowed it to happen in the first place . 
  it should n't happen like this , but it does . 
  i 'm almost sure it 's a common practice everywhere , given the technical possibilities . 
  they `` do this just in case '' . 
  could you please refrain from speaking in such a manner ? 
  i merely stressed that you compare apples and oranges . 
   leave their phones at home it mostly goes to state employees or those who 're going to get a job like this in the future . 
  as for the rest ... 
  i do n't think it matters . 
  they can put anyone in jail , regardless of the protest activity or collected evidences . 
  re-read my comment please , then type \u0421\u0418\u0417\u041e in google images search . 
  that 's exactly why i compared the latter to \u0413\u041a\u0427\u041f , not with gorby ... 
  yeltsin was a huge step ahead as compared to gkchp . 
  anyway , * that * country was already ruined . 
  if you see no difference then you clearly have no clue about conditions in the russian jail . 
  once arrested , you may never return back home . 
  even though you were innocent from the start . 
  it certainly makes a difference . 
  some placards were directly accusing our glorious leader ... 
  cops do n't need ids , they gather information about participants by using data of the cellular network . 
  the same thing happened in ukraine , when authorities were sending sms to the people whose phones were within the recieving range of the mobile base stations around the maidan square . 
  edit : a word, 
  we had around 100-200k back in 1991 and this number was enough for success . 
  call me snobbish , but moscow ( and spb for some extent ) has an upper hand here . 
  you 're wrong . 
  there was the [ `` russia '' hotel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rossiya_hotel ) , by now demolished . 
  hello guys !, 
  here are some [ photos from the rally ] ( https://imgur.com/a/a7omd ) . 
  also , i just finished editing [ a short video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh--hjzjirw ) . 
  edit : 50k seems a plausible number . 
  edit2 : had to wait in queue for more than an hour before went through the security checkpoint . 
  it was n't cold today but all that waiting out there was a bit boring . 
  ps : i heard a lot of people around me joking about `` we all are nation traitors and enemies of the russian people '' . 
  like , we 're a `` fifth column '' and that queue was barely moving because the cops had to check the id and make a photo , in order to make it easier to find us in the future . 
  it was weird but funny . 
  pps : oh , just noticed i got gilded . 
  thanks !, 
  [ relevant . 
  is [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeim6l5meqi ) song ? 
   you have ~ ~ 90 % ~ ~ approval ratings 146 % ftfy, 
  a food shortage and meal tickets are on the way next months . 
  what a brilliant move . 
  nice generalizations you have there . 
  i could n't care less about what russia said . 
  it 's a joke , dude . 
  great video , thanks a lot !, 
  the shtick with the boxes deserves `` oskar '' . 
  perhaps , my confusion stems from the fact that many countries , from which europe currently takes the migrants , are deeply religious . 
  by the way , in regards to the birth control issue , the hardline christianity is just as bad as the hardline islam . 
  edit : a word . 
  yes , they are , the redheads . 
  unfortunately , a bear stomped on my ear , and sudden urges of this kind are now punishable by imprisonment . 
  there 's a [ localized version of `` vesti '' ] ( http://www.gtrkmariel.ru/news/conduct-of-mari-el-in-the-mari-language/news-of-mari-el-mar-25-09-2015/ ) being aired in the mari language . 
  sadly , it 's a gov ' t propaganda channel ...
