  from what i see around myself , i could only made a conclusion that citizens of rufed will remain extremely hostile to the west for many years , regardless of whether putin will stay in charge or not . 
  i just sit and wonder where it all would go . 
  sorry , i ca n't provide you with an actual info . 
  i left the scene in 20 ( coz i married my gf and hence was obliged to earn money ) and , in addition , i dislike russian scene because of carders and botnet owners . 
  code cracking was a challenge to my intelligence , not a way of money making . 
  and it was fun !, 
  quoting / u / _ maxiking _ comment :  inferior human beings german nazis used a word ` subhumans ' ( like / u / _ maxiking _ did ) to define a position of eastern slavs in the human hierarchy . 
  perhaps , they also might know a word that you 're looking for . 
  he 's an ukrainian while he holds a passport issued by ukraine . 
  he can claim himself as a russian - it 's up to him , but it does n't matter in this particular case . 
   the kremlin 's desire to keep nationalist passions within controllable limits was visible in the high profile given to the unity day march , while pushing the ** less loyal ultra-nationalists ** into an obscure and distant neighbourhood . 
  less loyal ? 
  so , singing `` putin khuilo lalalalala '' and pro-ukraine and anti-war chanting in the streets of moscow are just `` less loyal '' ? 
  nice word choice . 
  fuck that website and fuck the piece of shit who wrote this article . 
  if anyone interested [ i 've posted my photos and a video ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2lb39d/russian_march_2014_in_moscow_photo_video_chants/ ) of the march in maryino . 
  maybe , it happens because i was young and healthy in those time but i keep pleasant memories of the late 80s - early 90s . 
  yup , friends of mine and i had no money but we were hoping that better times will come one day . 
  no one had been cared about commies , tbh , but once they have ousted we experienced such a great feeling of freedom . 
  it was a strange time : a half of my schoolmates were into so-called ` business ' then another half had drowned into computers . 
  heck , i even remember how i used to go to my friend who worked in a ministry in order to print thick docs of x86 assembly language for free . 
  those books were helped , in a couple of years i became a decent cracker and made my own group . 
  i hope that ~ ~ imperialistic pigs ~ ~ lovely software publishers had lost some money because of my patches , hehe . 
  the only thing i ca n't understand about russia despite of almost 40 yrs of living here : why can these people not just live their lives and let others do the same ? 
  why , why every time when things seem to be okay something has to happen to ruin it all we were able to achieve ? 
  that reminds me an old joke about tsar peter the great who has outlawed an impalement and replaced it with hanging as the death penalty because he was hoping that russians would start to pay more attention to their heads instead of usual focus on the own ass . 
  edit : grammar, 
   so now you are saying there is no such ethnicity as a russian ? 
  may i ask you how did you come to such a conclusion ? 
  russian ethnicity as well as ukrainian one makes sense abroad , esp. , overseas , or when it comes to the local non-slavic ethnics . 
  i just want to point out that final separation of the slavic triad has not happened yet . 
  considering the number of mixed families and the number of ex-ussr citizens who is still alive i 'd say it would take another decade or more . 
  the current armed conflict between rus and ukr will speed this process up to some extent . 
  i repeat : if he was born in ukraine , has got a passport of ukraine and is indistinguishable from his fellows from e ukraine then he 's a bloody ukrainian . 
  period . 
  that 's how an international recognition of the citizenship works out . 
  whether otherwise it would be great ... * sighs * no one cares , where have your grandparents come from . 
  no one cares , with whom your grandma was cheating . 
  ethnicity does n't make sense in case of rus/ukr/belarus relationship because they have been fucking each other for a thousand years . 
  russians , ukrainians and belorussians are of the same ethnicity but they live in different countries , speak different languages and have a slightly different mindset . 
  at the same time , kalmyks , chechens or tatars speak different languages , have a completely different mindset but live in the same country . 
  you need to take into account that russian = / = citizen of russia . 
  if this thug from lugansk speaks like ukrainian , was born in ukraine and lives in ukraine - he 's just a pesky khohol in my eyes of a noble muscovite . 
  does n't even matter that i only have about a quarter of pure russian blood running through my veins . 
  who are ` we ' ? 
  apologies , i was reading too fast and not comprehending well . 
  that was a guy on the video claimed that they all have to remember that they 're russians . 
  it 's even more ridiculous . 
  out of interest , how do you know if he is either an ukrainian or a russian ? 
  this dude was born in ukraine , speaks with thick ukrainian accent . 
  i 'd never call him a russian . 
  just to cheer you up : it [ exists ] ( http://www.dp.ru/a/2014/10/27/borotsja_s_omerzeniem_mo/ ) . 
  i tried to find out if they have a branch in moscow but had no luck . 
  nice job , though . 
  i 'd apply if i could . 
  regional leaders are independent to some extent from moscow then it comes to local management . 
  [ -- ] kistoul 2 points an hour ago  to quote / u/mazur49 in the worldnews thread :   the monument was removed by the same company ( zefs ) who sponsored it first hand and they wrote letter to inform about this intention before cooks 's coming out . 
  reason for removal is clearly stated in aforementioned letter - for repair . 
  there was problem with touchscreen and it needed to be fixed . 
  after repair it will be placed back on the same spot .

  another bullshit from businessinsider ? 
  deleted . 
  do you remember that russia 's full name is ` russian federation ' ? 
  and a word ` russian ' also refers to a historical territory , not only to a name of the dominant ethnicity . 
  many republics have its own presidents and parliaments . 
  things here differ from mono-ethnic countries . 
  finally , a compliment in this thread . 
  it was n't precisely aimed in my case , but thanks anyway !, 
  / u/londonghost has preferred not to notice this part , hehe . 
  with all due respect seems like you have no idea what are you talking about . 
  granted , life here can be tough sometimes but it does n't mean that russia is a hellhole . 
  there are many troubles with leaders though , i 'm guessing it 's something historical . 
  it would be greatly appreciated !, 
  how about obtaining me an eu passport ? 
  in my case . 
  haha . 
   purgatory oh dear , westerners are so touching . 
  like new-born puppies . 
  i 've just pointed out that a number of crimes is quite low for russia . 
  i did n't say it 's okay to get assaulted . 
  go hate somewhere else , mate . 
  6 times for 40 yrs of living ? 
  nope , it 's pretty ok . somewhere outside big cities this number would be far greater , esp. , in blue-collar regions , like ural . 
  - economic inequality ; - cultural and religious differences , muh muslims ; - many single male immigrants from - stans ; - many of the latter are living in the horrible conditions . 
  corrupt officials hire them , pay a half or less of a normal salary and treat them like slaves . 
  - famous russian mindset and tradition `` to sort out any problems on the spot '' pick one that you like more . 
  about ten or so years ago moscow cops stopped mentioning nationality in the annual statistic reports , because immigrants from - stans and caucasus region were overwhelming champions in field of rapes and street assaults . 
  i guess nothing really changed since those times , cops are sweeping it under the rug as usual . 
  it has nothing to with blacks , btw . 
  copy/paste of my comment from / r/worldnews ____ * it 's disgusting , of course . 
  i just ca n't help but notice that numbers mentioned in the article are nowhere near high enough to talk about special animosity towards blacks . 
  117 cases for 3 years in 140 millions country , is it a real threat ? 
  for instance , in moscow , dozen or more attacks are happening daily , everyone has a chance here to be beaten up regardless of a skin color . 
  * ____ another black dude mentioned in the article whined he was attacked 3 times for 15 yrs . 
  let 's count . 
  before my 25th birthday i was hopelessly beaten 3 times , another 3 times i was able to return a favor immediately on the spot , let alone my own aggressive acts . 
  well , 6 times in the sum . 
  as a four-eyed white nerd living in moscow i find it quite normal . 
  for many it ended up far more worse .
