  omg , thatwasajoke.jpg as for the refugees ' influx ... maybe , just maybe , they should stop breeding like bunnies . 
  ah , i forgot , their imaginary friend does n't allow them to wear a condom . 
  well , maybe they need to put some efforts into construction and education , instead of killing each other and blowing things up . 
  the climate changes all the time . 
  africa 's problem is not in the climate , they badly need to learn how to grow food . 
  the me 's problem is not in droughts , they just ca n't get along with each other . 
  europe 's problem is not with the mass migration per se , it should stop bending to the demands of newcomers . 
  that 's how i see it , my apologies in advance if it was tedious and preachy . 
  why ? 
  the winters are less harsh than it used to be . 
  i 'm fine with the global warming . 
  the author is american . 
  azssr ! = azerbajan , it was part of another country , therefore it did n't have a statehood . 
  do n't be too harsh on them , it 's just them trying to be edgy by putting random russian words in a sentence , hehe . 
  my granny used to mumble something like : `` ohh , kh-kh jummooaa '' . 
  what a weird language . 
  well , they see it in a wrong way . 
  i hope one day it will be changed . 
  a ) you do n't need to secede from a country you 've never been part of . 
  b ) good luck with initiating a secession process in an authoritarian petrostate such as azerbaijan . 
  see , for example : russia and chechnya . 
  nk has never been part of azebaijan . 
  it claimed independence in 1918 , at the same time as the azerbaijan democratic republic did . 
  both were later included in the ussr . 
  ah , good ol' guardian !, 
  meanwhile , other news : [ russian marines fight isis along with hezbollah in syria , says report ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.in/russian-marines-fight-isis-along-hezbollah-syria-says-report-648048 )  a group of russian marines have been reportedly engaged in a battle with the islamic state ( isis ) terrorists . 
  the russian soldiers , along with the hezbollah fighters and the syrian army , fought the isis in aleppo province in northern syria . 
  i do n't see an irony in the deaths of innocents . 
  sad to hear that : / armenians merit a better neighbor . 
  do n't they do it , like , every month or so ? 
  north - ice and tundra , no man 's land east - snow and taiga , squatting gopnicks south - eww , cossack hillbillies and islamists west - yurop, 
  [ putin 's adviser criticizes us for misinterpreting how obama meeting was arranged ] ( http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/09/25/putins-adviser-obama-asked-for-meeting-with-putin )  a foreign affairs adviser to russian president vladimir putin says it was u.s. president barack obama who wanted to meet with putin , not the other way around . 
  not sure who the heck you talked to but whining about corruption is a national pastime here . 
  like , every official is only stealing money , every pile of concrete blocks in the city is being built only for collecting kickbacks and so forth . 
  you 're not wrong . 
  not percentage wise , though , by the sheer number . 
   hagia sophia well , technically , it 's a former christian basilica and now is a museum . 
  \\  implying that istanbul is in europe, 
  some analysts say that there are up to 5 million in the moscow region ... 
  people tend to rally round the flag in tough times . 
  so far his support appears to be holding , even growing a bit . 
  dream on , buddy !, 
  as-salaam-alaikum !, 
  as i previously stated , it 's what you have to pay when you live in your own flat . 
  renting a decent two bedroom apartments would cost you up to 40.000 rub a month ( in moscow ) . 
  if you lived in your own apartments , then a monthly rent/maintenance fee was about 20 rub ( ~ 5-10 % of income ) . 
  now it 's about 4-5k rub , so it 's about 20 % of income . 
  well , you 're not wrong . 
  public figures got travel bans and personal sanctions , and the institutions were cut off from the international markets . 
  nobody cares about the oligarchs , the only sanctions that hurt were put on the banking sector and the oil drilling industry . 
  putin said it 's the biggest mosque in europe .

  how did you get my picture ? 
  username checks out . 
  okay , i 'll bite .

  houses were mostly built out of concrete blocks . 
  a carpet is good to cover the gaps between panels . 
  plus , a concrete wall is cold by touch in the winter . 
  partially , yes . 
  in addition , it 's a good insulation material for walls in the commie blocks . 
  it 's damn cold here . 
  since the time of peter i , there has n't been any alternative to the western way of life . 
  why does it bother you so much ? 
  that being said , while the anti-american sentiment is alive and kicking , i 've yet to meet anyone who sees europe as a direct threat to the country . 
  more like a usual grumbling `` dem american puppets , hurr durr '' . 
  in terms of terms of personal wealth , the population has never in history been so prosperous , as in the last decade . 
  hence the strongest ever support of the current regime , even though it would be much , much better in managing the country 's vast and growing oil wealth . 
  the percentage of supporters may well be changed in coming months ( or years for that matter ) , if the post-crimea levels of economical fuckuppery are to continue growing . 
  do n't even get me started on `` the past days of glory '' in the ussr '' . 
  it was only good in empty heads of western marxists . 
  now , we have the toys we like . 
  you can buy a car if you want , it no longer needs to wait for five years in queue . 
  you can afford to buy a flat if you have money , it no longer needs to wait for twenty years to get it for free out of the state , in the best case . 
  people have phones , computers , carpets on the walls and a whole load of series and shows on tv , need to have sth to talk about . 
  and , if you have money , you can afford the dental care . 
  or travelling somewhere . 
  or not standing hours in queue for basic ... everything ? 
  shining , my ass . 
  i recall how it was shining the other day i had to undergo a dental procedure . 
  `` you 're a man , boy , you can stand a little pain , cant ' t you ? '', 
  surely , i could , as i passed out flatly in a dentist chair . 
  they just tried to remove a nerve without anesthesia , because they had n't had the needed meds for * weeks * when i happened to be there . 
  putin 's russia , or yeltsin 's russia are/were light years better than anything in these bloody lands before . 
  people never knew any better . 
  and , realistically speaking , they never deserved any better , given the work productivity in the motherland . 
  well , the british have class . 
  even their krokodil is made from cocaine . 
  like the proverb goes `` severity of the russian laws is compensated by their poor enforcement '' . 
  it 's not really hard to get away with something when it 's possible to take the train and to disappear in a thin air . 
  what i found from talking with our local muslims , it 's even not the islam per se that is a problem . 
  essentially , the problem we have been experiencing is rooted in the cultural encounter between differently developed societies . 
  all their lives they 've been taught that if a woman is dressed like a slut she must be what she looks like . 
  there wo n't be an easy win with that people . 
  it is far too deeply ingrained in the culture . 
  be it an educational effort , or a law enforcement mission - either way , the western society has to deal with it , instead of crying about endangered western values . 
  y' know , doing as the adults do . 
  after all , who let the refugees in ? 
  as a wild guess , it was a democratically elected government which is responsible for this . 
  so it represents the will of the people .
