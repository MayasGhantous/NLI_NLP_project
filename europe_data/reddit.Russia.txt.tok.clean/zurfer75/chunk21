  it 's a reasonable move . 
  better to be safe than to be sorry afterwards . 
  from my perspective , there 's no reason to panic about that . 
  moscow has been subjected to creeping islamisation for decades . 
  it has ended up ranked # 1 in europe , in terms of the sheer number of muslims living here . 
  actually , short of preventing the ghettoisation of newcomers , there are not many things to be done at this point . 
  eventually , the locals will learn about basic safety awareness . 
  eventually , the migrants will stop overreacting when they see a girl wearing a mini skirt . 
  needless to say , though , the cops should be dealing effectively with that sort of a situation . 
  let 's hope , it will be passed into law asap . 
  that said , i wo n't be holding my breath . 
  still not a thing to lose your shit about . 
  i bet that we will see a lot more casual racism in coming months , as the refugee crisis continues to worsen . 
  no , it does n't make it ok , of course . 
  the mayor just came across as a not-so-subtle racist and should be called out on his bullshit . 
  i guess the mayor a ) is not the sharpest tool in the shed ; b ) has no clue whatsoever of how life could be for someone who lived in a war-torn country . 
  i 'm not saying that the gypsies are better or worse than the syrians - no , that would be too rayciss to think that way . 
  my point is that for the most part , the european gypsies are much more tame than the refugees from the middle east , who grew up in a culture which is light years away from the european counterpart , who is actually suffering from ptsd , and so on and so forth . 
  give the mayor a little more time . 
  maybe you should read it before commenting . 
  i 'm sure that in this case , `` eastern europeans '' is just the politically correct way to say `` goddamn gypsies '' . 
  calm down a bit . 
  third time for charm , lol . 
  why would they be afraid of giving a honest answer ? 
  the poll was conducted in the gov ' t controlled areas . 
  hold my bear , i 'm going down the rabbit hole . 
   [ unian ] ( http://www.unian.info/society/1121710-poll-in-dpr-less-than-third-of-residents-support-separatists.html ) : less than one third of residents of the self-proclaimed donetsk people 's republic ( dpr ) are supporting separatists , according to the results of a survey carried out on request of the local authorities . 
  uatoday.tv ( sep. 13 , 2015 ) refers to the following article on unian ( 12.09.2015 ) : [ poll in dpr : less than third of residents support separatists ] ( http://www.unian.info/society/1121710-poll-in-dpr-less-than-third-of-residents-support-separatists.html ) . 
   it is reported that [ the survey ] ( http://www.unian.info/society/1116514-over-50-of-ukrainians-see-donbas-conflict-as-russias-aggressive-war-poll.html ) was conducted by ** sociological research centre `` special status '' ** in august 2015 . 
   a total of ** 6,500 people ** aged from 18 were questioned in ** 19 militant-controlled towns of donetsk region ** . 
  the link actually refers to another news article on unian from 28.08.2015 : [ over 50 % of ukrainians see donbas conflict as russia 's aggressive war - poll ] ( http://www.unian.info/society/1116514-over-50-of-ukrainians-see-donbas-conflict-as-russias-aggressive-war-poll.html ) let 's read it :  more than 70 % of ukrainians believe russia is the aggressor state , while nearly 65 % say `` dpr '' and `` lpr '' are terrorist organizations , according to the survey by the ** razumkov center ** , ukrainska pravda reports . 
  what 's happened to the mysterious sociological research centre `` special status '' ( which is ca n't be googled btw ) ? 
   the study was conducted on august 7-16 , ** 2010 ** involving respondents aged 18 years or older ** from all ukraine 's regions , with the exception of crimea and the occupied areas of donetsk and luhansk regions ** . 
  here is a link to [ the survey results on razumkov center 's website ] ( http://www.razumkov.org.ua/eng/poll.php?poll_id=1024 ) , if anyone interested . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** 71.8 % of ukrainians , ** excluding ** those who live in crimea/dnr/lnr , think that `` russia is an aggressor , a part of the conflict '' . 
  ps : 19.8 % gave a `` do n't know '' answer . 
  that means , about a fifth part of the ukrainians have no fucking idea what 's going on in their country . 
  `` logical '' , my ass . 
  wars are not about logic , especially in the middle east . 
  meanwhile , in syria : [ at least 38 killed ( including 14 children ) in shelling on government-held areas in aleppo ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/19-dead-rebel-fire-syrias-aleppo-160203830.html )  at least 38 civilians including 14 children were killed by rebel bombardment on tuesday of a regime-held area of the northern syrian city of aleppo , a monitor said . 
  if you want to believe that the `` rebels '' are the good guys here , it 's just your emotional choice . 
  to me all the sides are equally bad . 
  ... according to the report of snhr . 
  i 'd rather wait for a report made by the un to be published before making up my mind on the issue . 
  those are just the numbers for one month in 2014 . 
  do you have anything more substantial to back your point up ? 
  propaganda , injured false pride , not handling the situation well , and throwing a tantrum as a result . 
   intellectuals pointed me to books on berlin in the 1920s and the concept of `` ressentiment , '' a philosophical term that describes a simmering resentment and sense of victimization arising out of envy of a perceived enemy . 
  it often has its roots in a culture 's feeling of impotence . 
  in berlin in the early 20th century , it helped explain the rise of german fascism . 
  in russia in august , it seemed to have many targets : ukraine , gay people , european dairy products and above all the united states . 
  < . .   anti-americanism is more potent now because it is stirred up and in many ways sponsored by the state , an effort that russians , despite their hard-bitten cynicism , seem surprisingly susceptible to . 
  independent voices are all but gone from russian television , and most channels now march to the same , slickly produced beat . 
  virtually any domestic problem , from the ruble 's decline to pensioners ' losing subsidies on public transport , is cast as a geopolitical standoff between russia and america , and political unrest anywhere is portrayed as having an american state department official lurking behind it . 
  < . .   `` tell her how well we all live , how much better than in europe and how wonderful crimea is now , '' hissed a woman in a skintight dress to someone i was interviewing . 
  she was referring to the crimean peninsula , which russia annexed last year . 
  that of course , was the other big change i encountered . 
   inside russia , mr. putin 's actions in crimea have broken friendships and split families , leaving society as divided as i have ever seen it . 
  politics , once everyone 's obsession , now seems like a distant land no one visits . 
  those who do , pay a price . 
  mr. gudkov said he felt like `` a jew in hitler 's germany '' when he opposed the crimea annexation . 
   the move also caused the biggest break in relations with the west since the collapse of the soviet union . 
   `` it 's like a divorce , '' said keith darden , a political-science professor at american university . 
  `` they are saying : ` the relationship we had is over . 
  we 've had enough of your efforts to change us . 
  we 're doing our own thing now . ' ''  he added , `` but they do n't know what their own thing is . '', 
  no wonder , this nation is made of modern-era serfs . 
  they feel abandoned every time they are not raped by the new nobility . 
  hence the results . 
  now go and tell it to the military . 
  they 're using the concept of nuclear deterrent developed in the 60-70s . 
  hopefully , they may change their views ... eventually . 
  the missile shield is not a defensive measure in terms of the nuclear deterrent and m.a.d. 
  if a country got encircled by the enemy 's missile shield and lost its nuclear strike capability as a result , then the nukes stationed within the country borders are rendered useless . 
  mama merkel , could you please tell him to stop fucking with syria and burning our money ? 
  it 's time to start getting used to the new reality . 
  be it wars , food shortages , droughts or the climate change - europe will remain the # 1 migration destination for years or even decades to come . 
   the rebels do you mean the sunni militants ? 
  if they come to power , what fate do you think lies in store for [ 1.5 millions of the syrian alawites ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alawites ) ? 
  even though the sunni let them go alive , alawites have no other choice but to flee to europe or turkey/lebanon . 
  the focus of attention has shifted to syria . 
  seems like the eye of sauron is only capable of looking at one place at a time . 
  according to syria 's ambassador , we 've got a few thousands of refugees officially . 
  every time i go shopping to auchan i see quite a few middle-easterners , so the actual numbers are more likely higher , since the official statistics suck balls as usual . 
  if you are not an ukrainian , registering as a refugee does n't give you much advantage , if i 'm not mistaken . 
   and that muslim get stabbed by neo nazi in moscow . 
  unfortunately for us natives , it 's the other way around . 
  [ moscow is largest muslim city in europe , but faithful face discrimination from public , authorities ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/moscow-largest-muslim-city-europe-faithful-face-discrimination-public-authorities-2020858 ) . 
  the latter . 
  brb , gone buying a ticket to london . 
  [ gazprom , european partners sign nord stream-2 deal ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/04/russia-forum-nord-stream-idusl5n11a0g420150904 )  led by gazprom , which has put the cost of the plan at up to 9.9 billion euros ( $ 11 billion ) and maybe less due to savings , the group is to build a third and fourth pipeline to transport up to 55 billion additional cubic meters of gas a year . 
   it would double the capacity of lines 1 and 2 , which take the same route . 
  the new pipelines are due to start transporting gas by the end of 2019 . 
  ahh , that :d totally went over my head . 
  excuse me ? 
  would you mind to rephrase it somehow ? 
  never heard it before . 
  we say : forgive only twice , and the third time kick an ass . 
  well said !, 
  yes , sure .
