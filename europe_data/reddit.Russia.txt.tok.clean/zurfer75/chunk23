  dorin chirtoac\u0103 , the mayor of chi\u0219in\u0103u , is currently on a trip with his girlfriend in barcelona . 
  what a lovely bunch . 
  some women love to be ruled by others . 
  why do some people love to play the race card ? 
  black people can do no wrong ? 
  it 's not true . 
  btw , the syrians look white , or it 's just me ? 
   the head of the opposition nemtsov was n't `` the head '' of anything substantial , it 's navalny who is . 
  it 's a hard question . 
  to me , if a man was born & bred in ukraine and he is white - he 's ukrainian . 
  they have no problems , unless they 're coming back to ukraine . 
  accent, 
  stop readin ' news , matey . 
  i guess so . 
  i was an astronomy geek when i was a kid . 
  thanks for your advice !, 
  have n't seen it yet . 
  is it worth watching ? 
   the trio blasted off aboard a soyuz rocket from the baikonur cosmodrome on wednesday but ** the trip lasted two days instead of the usual fast-track six hours ** after the iss raised its orbit to avoid space debris . 
  i , for one , am totally glad that they have made it up through the space debris . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , it 's not a thing to fuck around with . 
  can confirm , i have noticed a lot of ukrainians recently appearing in moscow . 
  it 's just throwing a temper tantrum : `` do n't you let me in [ to germany ] ? 
  arghhh , fuck it all ! '', 
  * tell me who your friends are ... *, 
  i hate when he 's right . 
  but he is right on that one . 
  * syrian economy is destroyed * does n't not compute with * no refugees *  no daesh which is [ originated in iraq ] ( http://www.wanttoknow.info/war/isis-islamic-state-origins.shtml ) , where the americans have put their boots on the ground . 
  did you mean the iraq war and how the american society got divided over the issue ? 
  the difference is that in america , peace-loving hippies like me were n't told by the president that they are national traitors . 
  from the syrians who already live in the country . 
  i 'm 146 % sure that they are unhappy with the influx of newcomers . 
  as far as i know the dialects of arabic are varying from country to country . 
  the language is a dead giveaway of a home country . 
  russia has a tiny naval `` base '' in syria . 
  see wiki : [ russian naval facility in tartus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_naval_facility_in_tartus ) . 
  as far as i know , that 's it . 
   moscow < ...  was found to have unhelpful locals and a general `` aloofness '' by survey participants , plunging it to the bottom of the list . 
  so true . 
  do n't even think about going here unless you have a local guide . 
  ^ wink ^ wink ps : bring on the euros !, 
  i suppose the fundamental question is : what anyone would ever need it for ? 
  it 's afghanistan-79 all over again . 
  apparently , the process of bankruptcy or the russian state is not going fast enough for their taste . 
  saved it . 
  thanks !, 
   vitaly guy gave me a chuckle . 
  nice to hear it . 
  to me it 's normal to dislike my own people and their backwardness . 
  i mean , it 's my duty as a citizen to call 'em out on their crap . 
  what 's weird for me is when a foreigner does the same . 
  it 's like having a raging boner for an ugly girl who does n't give two shits about you . 
  i 'm pretty far from cherishing my compatriots . 
  most of the time i hate them too . 
  i just got used to this feeling and barely notice it . 
  anyways , hope dies last . 
  the army normally does n't have the a `` war-peace '' switch . 
  it 's always on duty , performing various tasks , be it drills , idleness or real combat . 
   i do n't `` just oppose russia 's politics '' , i actually have a strong distaste for russian people , mentality , nation , history poor fella : / i can only imagine what it must be like for you . 
  according to [ rt ( eng ) ] ( http://www.rt.com/news/314141-russia-syria-jets-reports/ ) , [ gazeta.ru ( rus ) ] ( http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2015/09/02_a_7735427.shtml ) , and [ echo of moscow ( rus ) ] ( http://echo.msk.ru/news/1615024-echo.html ) , there 's no russian jets/ground troops fighting in syria . 
  turns out , the lgbt-community has blown the story out of proportion , as they always do ? 
  just kidding . 
  thanks for the info , it 's nice to hear that no one was seriously injured . 
   the western city of kryvyi rih offtopic : just came to mind - [ '' \u0428\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0441\u0430 '' kryvbas - hard bass , kryvyi rih , ukraine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3frxdzzplle ) . 
  it happened nowhere near the actual zone of conflict which involves , like , 0.1 % of the population and occupies , like , 1 % of the territory . 
  a poor excuse , if you ask me . 
  if you want to bring the rufed into discussion ... all right , let me remind you that we too have an ongoing conflict in a breakaway region within the borders of the country - chechnya . 
  by your logic , it gives us the right to assault gays , beat our wives , and punch kittens . 
  -- let 's draw some funny parallels : after turmoil in moscow , chechens , who lived in an ethnically distinct region , say `` down with russia !, 
  we 're gon na be autonomous ! '', 
  after turmoil in kiev , novorossyans ( or whatever the fuck they call themselves ) , who lived in an ethnically distinct region , say `` down with ukraine !, 
  we 're gon na be autonomous ! '', 
  the locals start expelling and killing russians , taking over their property along the way . 
  the locals start expelling and killing ukrainians , taking over their property along the way . 
  the war , which is called `` counter-terrorist operation '' ( kto ) , breaks out . 
  the war , which is called `` anti-terrorist operation '' ( ato ) , breaks out . 
  the rich saudis and qatari start pouring money into the new-born ichkeria . 
  middle-eastern mercenaries flock into the breakaway republic . 
  the certain forces in the rufed gov ' t ( some say that the ousted ukrainian president also had a hand in that - maybe it 's just rumors ) starts pouring money into the new-born novorossya . 
  mercenaries , random thugs and cossacks flock into the breakaway republic . 
  the western countries express their support to the `` brave freedom fighters of chechnya '' . 
  the charity collection points `` help the people of donbass ! '', 
  appear all over the city of moscow . 
  * cue forward * the chechens won the first war and managed to achieve a de facto autonomy . 
  the novorossyans won the first war and managed to achieve a de facto autonomy . 
  * cue forward * the chechens lost the second war and went to a mode of a creeping insurgency against the occupiers ( sporadic acts of terror , sleeping cells and all that stuff ) . 
  the novorossyans lost the second war and went to a mode of a creeping insurgency against the occupiers ( sporadic acts of terror , sleeping cells and all that stuff ) . 
  -- of course , a load of rubbish above has nothing in common with reality . 
  let 's leave it as an exercise in alternative history . 
  i just wanted to point out the flaws in your logic . 
  my point is that the civil conflict - once started - can smoulder for decades . 
  granted , it 's a truly gift from above to any * bad * government . 
  you can literally ( lol , no ) piss on the heads of citizens , while justifying your own fuck-ups . 
  i know what i 'm speaking about . 
  in two last decades , the card of war/terror/imminent threat was played every once in a while . 
  see where it took us . 
  tl ; dr : fighting a war in a country is not an excuse . 
  full stop . 
  hats off , guys !, 
  this is some top notch analysis , delivered for you straight from pricksville , usa .
