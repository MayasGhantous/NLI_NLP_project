  everything is possible for a hypocrite in action . 
  the elites keep playing with fire . 
  they 're now selling patriotic bullshit on tv , while hiding their assets and families in the gay ebil west . 
  apparently , they honestly believe that no one ever noticed it . 
  hello mates , i 'm zurfer75 from moscow , and i 'm here to apply for a mod position . 
  here come my answers : - * how often are you on reddit in an average week ? 
  * 7 days a week . 
  it got to the point of addiction . 
  - * how often do you visit / r/europe ? 
  * this is my favorite subreddit . 
  checking it constantly , all day long . 
  - * what country are you normally resident in ? 
  - * do you speak any languages besides english ? 
  * russian . 
  - * what interests you about europe ? 
  * everything . 
  i 'm a grateful reader/listener . 
  - * what are your favourite and least favourite things about / r/europe ? 
  * a wide diversity of opinions / brigaders and agenda pushers . 
  - * do you have experience as a moderator or similar ? 
  * nothing really worth mentioning . 
  although i 've gained some experience at managing media projects . 
  some even told me later that i was not * that * bad at it . 
  - * why do you want to be a moderator ? 
  * i want to contribute to my favorite online community . 
  - * why do you think you would be a good moderator ? 
  * i 'm pretty sure it 's important to be objective , regardless of personal attitude . 
  - * do you have any experience with statistics , datamining or reddit bots ? 
  * sadly , no . 
  - * what is your opinion on the immigration megathread ? 
  what do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? 
  * out of sight , out of mind - that 's how it worked out . 
  curtailing information is bad , mmm ` okay ? 
  - * what 's one weakness you have ? 
  * i 'm often in an apocalyptic mood for no apparent reason . 
  the end is nigh and all that stuff . 
  - * would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses ? 
  * i 'll pick a horse-sized duck any time , any day . 
  it 's obviously a magical creature , so i 'd go full nils from the swedish fairytale ; i mean i would tame it , ride it and fly the fuck away from this planet . 
  - * what single word connects all of these three of the following words : europe , pussy cat , teacher ? 
  explain why * all these words are * bigender * ? 
  i mean , europe can addressed in a feminine sense as an area and in masculine - as a continent etc. 
  not sure , though , if it makes sense in english . 
  you may keep on reading comments on / r/europe , it 's just as toxic . 
  eh , no , that 's not how it works . 
  a grenade blast ( or any other kind of explosion for that matter ) releases a finite amount of energy . 
  ( i belive it 's called the law of conservation of energy of smth like that ) . 
  any obstacle , including a human body , takes and absorbs a chunk of kinetic energy of a blast wave . 
  unfortunately for us , human beings , the same goes for the lethal fragments . 
  in more simple words , if someone shields you from the blast with their body , you 'll be safe in most cases . 
  it 's doubtful that a hand grenade thrown in a crowd can kill or injure a whole hundred of people . 
  i ca n't wrap my head around it . 
  if it was * one * grenade blast , how is it that so many was injured ? 
  or there were some massive clashes taking place ? 
  with friends like you , ukraine does n't need any enemies . 
  just saying . 
   all civilian pro-russian elements to be stifled so , what do you suggest exactly ? 
  ethnic cleansing ? 
  mass repressions ? 
  how european of you , haha . 
  i find it entertaining when you guys show your true face . 
  * `` and , god forbid -- never read soviet newspapers before dinner . ' ` m\u2019mm . 
  but there are no other newspapers . ' ` in that case do n't read any at all . 
  do you know i once made thirty tests in my clinic . 
  and what do you think ? 
  the patients who never read newspapers felt excellent . 
  those whom i specially made read pravda all lost weight . '' * [ -- mikhail bulgakov , heart of a dog , 1925 .

  apparently , you watch too much rt :d, 
  \\* unidentified municipal maintenance workers , ftfy, 
  [ ericsson ga 628 ] ( http://www.gsmarena.com/ericsson_ga_628-105.php ) that was a time !, 
  given how the things are going , it would become the last opportunity to jump off the crazy train in which this country is turning into . 
  it 's good that some people still dare to protest in the motherland today . 
  when i was reading this , a really strange idea came to my mind ... 
  it seems i should have used `` the last ones to suffer '' instead . 
  anyways , i hope you get the gist . 
  pandering to the muslim minority at expense of the christian majority is a commonly used tactic in mixed communities ( at least , on this side of the pond ) . 
   pretty hypocritical considering russia loves invading weak nations it 's almost like a russian can only speak on behalf of the government . 
  having your own thoughts about something is also not allowed , amirite ? 
  * `` if in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall , then in the following one it should be fired . 
  otherwise do n't put it there . 
  i mean , it may be irrelevant at some point whether the nato is aggressive or not , inherently evil or not . 
  as far it goes for war-hungry elites , well , as we clearly know , they 're the last ones to be directly involved when the hell breaks loose . 
  luckily the intervention put a stop to the war and brought peace to the former yugoslavia . 
  therefore , it 's had a positive impact overall . 
  i 'm too far removed from the situation to have an opinion . 
  i think it depends on who you are going to ask . 
  the serbs do n't seem too happy about it . 
  actually , i find kosovo similar , in a way , to other breakaway republics , such as transnistria , abkhazia , to name a few . 
  if by `` effective '' you mean the death of hundreds of thousands , making millions more refugees and turning a cradle of the civilization into ruins - indeed , it 's very effective . 
  on the other hand , in case of war , i will likely get the short end of the stick , so i 'm fine to go with my own choice of words . 
   regardless of good or bad intentions maybe i should bold the important part next time . 
  it 's not a hatred but a legitimate concern . 
  at this point , russia is an enemy of the nato and vise versa . 
  thinking otherwise is naive . 
  history shows that the nato could be brutal towards their enemies and they do n't hesitate to act . 
  i 'm struggling to keep up with the discussion . 
  if history is anything to go by then yes , russia might be or might not be aggressive . 
  what does it have to do with the nato ? 
  whataboutism at its finest .
