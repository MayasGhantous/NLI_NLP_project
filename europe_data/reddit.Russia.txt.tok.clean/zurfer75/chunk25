  the alliance attacked a sovereign country , killed or injured hundreds of civilians and temporarily occupied part of the territory . 
  regardless of good or bad intentions ( or their moral obligations for that matter ) , they acted as an invading force . 
   according to nato the operation sought to stop human rights abuses in kosovo , [ 40 ] and it was the first time that the organisation used military force without the approval of the un security council . 
  [ 41 ] on a side note , the un had nothing to do with * the bombing * . 
  i 'm not going to debate whether that was uncalled for or not . 
  someone might say that the serbs got it right on the money and yet others could think that the bombing of residential areas was a war crime . 
  our emotions are irrelevant to the topic . 
  the question , as i understood it , was `` can the nato be aggressive under some circumstances ? '', 
  the short answer is yes . 
  the longer answer may be along the lines of `` yes , when it suits them '' or `` yes , when they have to satisfy the public demand '' . 
   is n't it only a defensive alliance ? 
  [ nato bombing of yugoslavia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_yugoslavia ), 
  indeed , we drink and smoke a lot . 
  we really love pets and animals in general . 
  in some cases , we love these furry bastards more than people . 
  risking own life to save a pet - oh , it 's normal . 
  we too call it `` panel ` ka '' , `` khruzhevka '' is a special term for the first wave 5-storey building , which has inner walls made from paper blocks : /, 
  really ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  perhaps , you may enlighten me . 
  coz it 's a natural way of behaving for the human being ? 
  war is bad and all that stuff . 
  why ? 
  how is it any different from ' a former drug addict ' or ' a former criminal ' ? 
  more like a whole neighborhood built of khruzhevkas . 
  moscow has a program of demolishing these old 5-storeys and moving tenants into newly built apartments . 
  for free , by the way . 
  [ according to the moscow government ] ( https://stroi.mos.ru/news/v-moskve-ostalos-snesti-177-pyatietazhek ) , 177 khruzhevkas are left to go on 4 aug 2015 . 
  about 90 % done . 
  it 's not an improvement at all . 
  demushkin & co were banned for their strict position against the war with ukraine . 
  generally , the newer the neighborhood , the less problems with parking it has . 
  having a traffic jam in moscow is like snow in the winter , so , do n't even get me started on that . 
  i 'm not really sure who you addressed with your comment . 
  demushkin and the said movement ( now suspended ) were the only reason i went to the rally where i took these pictures . 
  here , in the 21th century it 's called the `` apartment buildings '' . 
  as someone who lived in a real commieblock in his childhood , i may assure you : both things are not the same . 
   it was the 10th annual gathering of white supremacists , neo-nazis and far-right nationalists , held in moscow in november . 
  [ pictures taken during the rally ] ( http://imgur.com/a/gwsdo ) , if anyone interested . 
   `` nationalism has a bright future in russia , '' said co-organizer dmitri demushkin , 36 , a former skinhead and ex-leader of the slavic union , a banned group whose russian initials , ss , intentionally mimic those of the nazi paramilitaries . 
  `` we will either win or the russian people will die . '', 
  in the last years , demushkin was a founding leader of the nationalist movement `` the russians '' . 
  aand it 's gone . 
  a week ago , on aug 14 , the political activities of the group has been suspended by the moscow prosecutor 's office . 
  `` the russians '' got banned in russia !, 
  oh , what cruel irony . 
  i 'm by far not a naive person . 
  it 's only my laziness that keeps me from writing long rants . 
  anyway , here 's a rare moment of agreement between us . 
  one quick look at what was done to his public image ( let alone the country turning into a laughing stock of the world ) , reveals that he is light years away from `` fulfilling his desires '' . 
  one thing is for sure , though : he is further from achieving his ambition than he was before the sochi olympics . 
  which is sad , actually . 
  he 's by far the most intelligent leader in the modern history of russia . 
  perhaps , all the years spent surrounded by ` yes men ' have finally taken their toll . 
  or he 's just getting old , haha . 
  turns out i 'm either stupid or blind . 
  the only thing about the dearest leader that i believe is of value is that he is seeking recognition ( or , at least , respect ) as a world-renowned leader playing the big role in the world politics . 
  he may want to isolate * the country * , while trying to keep a grip on power at home . 
  but i doubt he wants to isolate * himself * from the world . 
   will ruin his dream to rebuild army and restart cold war let me guess : is this what you found out looking into a crystal ball ? 
  or laughing , while having money parked in foreign banks ... 
  there is nothing unusual in the cb policy . 
  just a natural way of forming the exchange rate in a petrostate . 
  actually , it 's not like that they can do anything else at this point . 
  i meant the first few pages of / r/europe . 
  just to make sure that there 's no `` barrage of the russian propaganda posted here '' . 
  well , i 've just trawled through the first few pages but failed to find a single posting that could be described as `` pro-russian '' . 
  luckily for us , the situation here is nowhere near as dire as it might be . 
  the pro-regime propaganda rarely hits the front page , thus there is no need for ad hominem and name calling . 
  either way , it would be better to address the content than to shoot the messenger . 
  i 'm personally a big fan of how vice is looking at the situation in ukraine . 
  let 's give it a try . 
  he was reportedly sacked for his inappropriate behavior during the raid . 
  ninja edit : [ source in ru ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2015/08/21/sankcii/ ), 
  til that vice news is a kremlin mouthpiece . 
  the sad truth is that sanctions or not , crisis or not , life has always been grim for rural dwellers in places like this . 
  oh , please no !, 
  i 'd shit my pants if i ever met him . 
  [ stas baretsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanislav_baretsky ), 
  just the usual nonsense along the lines `` do n't we have our own breweries [ in the country ] !? '', 
  i like the moment when he says : `` no , it 's absolutely not a pr stunt !, 
  '' , and a second later : `` yes , it * is * the pr . '', 
  stas baretsky ( the dude in red ) ftw !, 
  man , i love this clown , though he went full retard with all that patriotic nonsense . 
  been drinking a lot this week . 
  now i 'm going out of town for a while . 
  i beg to differ . 
  a genuine war has nothing to do with embarassment . 
  after all , what matters in the end is the result . 
  the far east is russia 's . 
  siberia ? 
  yep . 
  the p-l commonwealth is long gone . 
  even the authentic mongols are using cyrillic these days , haha . 
  so hard to choose , it 's all so delicious . 
  i think i 'll go with the whole molotov-ribbentrop pact and its consequences ( occupation of the baltics , partitioning of poland , katyn , etc etc ) . 
  yep , it 's in the news . 
  that 's just a sign that the country is in the denial stage . 
  hopefully , it will pass soon . 
  the average life expectancy in russia is around 70 .
