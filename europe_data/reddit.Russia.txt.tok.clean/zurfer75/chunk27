  you did n't vote for a war criminal , you campaigned against him - it was a right thing to do . 
  so did i for that matter . 
  there 's nothing to argue about . 
  you lost me at the point of taking responsibility . 
  if it is a thing that makes you feel better and/or special - it 's up to you and i 'm totally fine with it !, 
  however , you have zero rights to ask anyone to get on the guilt train . 
  i see it in a more simple way : i tried & failed . 
  full stop right here . 
  no point in feeling guilty about the country when said country goes banana . 
  after all , i think i got my punishment in the form of losing money . 
  i could sell my flat and move the fuck out of the county before this shit started . 
  now that train is gone and i , as a result , deemed to rot here till the end . 
   i did n't vote for bush , does n't matter , still my responsibility , i 'm not absolved and neither is any other american . 
  out of interest , what did you do about it ? 
  i mean , do you have any hints or suggestions ? 
  what should i do if i feel guilty about what our nation is doing now ? 
  yes , it depends on the technical capabilities of isp . 
  mts will most likely block a page about drugs while leaving the rest accessible . 
  vpn seems to be easier to use , unless they start shaping/blocking the encrypted traffic . 
  thinking all night long . 
  https://meduza.io/en/news/2015/08/12/russia-bans-reddit  reddit , one of the most popular destinations on the internet , has been added to russia 's list of banned websites . 
  the federal drug control service decided to block the site after discovering what it says is content promoting the use of illegal drugs . 
   the offending content was a page titled , `` minimal and reliable methods for growing psilocybe [ mushrooms ] . '', 
  because reddit uses https protocol for secure communication , many russian internet providers ( perhaps 30 percent , according to the government ) will block the website in its entirety . 
   on august 10 , russian censors complained that they were unable to contact reddit 's administrators . 
  `` we assume that the website is simply understaffed during the summer holidays , but this is no excuse to risk [ losing ] its entire audience [ in russia ] , '' officials said publicly . 
  i do n't know what 's better . 
  paid shills are more obvious than fanatics . 
  a wall of text with a dozen links is one of the dead giveaways . 
  [ ` ministry of truth ' recruits ukrainians for ` internet army ' ] ( https://globalvoicesonline.org/2015/02/25/ministry-of-truth-recruits-ukrainians-for-internet-army/ )  finally , several hours later the ministry 's official online hq spit out a press-release announcing the `` internet army '' launch and linking to the new website . 
  the release says the army 's main goal is to mobilize internet users to fight `` russian bots , spreading fakes , informational and psychological pressure from russian media '' and notes the minister hopes that the new project `` will help mobilize a number of volunteers to spread the truth and expose russian fakes . '', 
   absolutely nobody of consequence dislikes the russian people . 
  i laughed a lot reading this . 
  thanks , op !, 
  oh , what 's really mind boggling is the amounts of mayo they put in every goddamn salad . 
  so , just to sum it up , you got triggered by mere mentioning a word . 
  apparently , reading and comprehending is hard these days ... 
  my point was that the ossetians have been somewhat independent from georgia . 
  the last two times ( 1918 and 1992 ) when the georgians tried to establish their rule in the breakaway region , ossetians started a rebellion . 
  it seems like there 's a sort of pattern here . 
  no , it was n't . 
  nothing in my comment suggested that the borders should be redrawn to make it satisfy the needs of the russian imperialists . 
  you 've made up an argument and tried to attribute it to me . 
  ps : i 'm not your buddy , yank . 
   the borders should have reverted to those of the russian empire ? 
  no , we 're not supposed to do so . 
  where exactly did you read that in my comment ? 
  the only bold proposal here is yours . 
  i simply stated a couple of facts without attempting to make any particular ` argument ' . 
  south ossetia was an autonomous region of the gssr . 
  before the soviets it was part of the russian empire . 
  so , in practical sense , the georgians never had significant authority over the region . 
  [ if you include kazakhstan ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?v=67&amp;c=en&amp;c=kz&amp;c=lh&amp;c=pl&amp;c=rs&amp;l=en ) , you 'll get a different result . 
   since the passport had been issued in december 2013 lithuania 's foreign minister linas linkevicius believes it confirms moscow 's plans to annex crimea . 
   `` the passport had been issued a few months prior to the annexation of crimea , '' said linkevicius . 
  `` this , along with other facts , shows russia 's consistent preparations for the annexation of the region . '' lmao , lithuania . 
  is that what you 've been turned into ? 
  a man was born in 1992 , a year after ukrainan ssr has got independence . 
  hell knows , what 's written in his birth certificate , by the way . 
  for instance , i 've got a military id of the ussr , hehe . 
  regardless . 
  that means , he 's got a civil passport in 2004 , when he turned 14 . 
  crimea was ukrainan through and through back then . 
  a birthplace in his passport had to be like `` ukrssr , rep. crimea '' or `` ukraine , rep. crimea '' . 
  this data went to a central database . 
  by no means peroxide-haired cunts from ovir who issued him a ** travellers passport ** in question could made this shit up . 
  they 're filling passports with data from the interior ministry database . 
  full stop . 
  so , it was a honest mistake in documents , not some evil plot . 
  hell , pm medvedev ( iirc ) himself admitted that the government had no idea about the annexation right before it happened . 
  it was a secret operation from the very beginning . 
  what 's interesting is that her diary was written in russian , english and deutsch . 
  i wonder if they 'll find a way to spin it . 
  something along the lines of `` knowledge of a foreign language would make you a cannibal ! '' . 
   especially if the alternative is a private company running proprietary code . 
  that 's the part i agree with . 
  yeah but it does n't mean that sailfish is/will be free of vulnerabilities . 
   protecting ethinic russians ... in south ossetia ? 
  [ according to 2008 census ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9d%d0%b0%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b5_%d0%ae%d0%b6%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b9_%d0%9e%d1%81%d0%b5%d1%82%d0%b8%d0%b8#.d0.ad.d1.82.d0.bd.d0.b8.d1.87.d0.b5.d1.81.d0.ba.d0.b8.d0.b9_.d1.81.d0.be.d1.81.d1.82.d0.b0.d0.b2 ) , ethnic russian made up 2,8 % of the population of the breakaway region . 
  no wonder . 
  according [ to the source ] ( http://autotraveler.ru/en/spravka/fuel-price-in-europe.html#.vcyj8fmqqko ) , the price of a litre of holy benzinium in russia is the lowest in europe . 
  exporting it elsewhere is more profitable than to sell it in the domestic market . 
  [ russia imports of gasoline cmlv ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/imports-of-gasoline-cmlv )  imports of gasoline cmlv in russia decreased to 30.60 usd million in january from 870.80 usd million in december of 2014 . 
  seems like we stopped importing gasoline since january . 
  the middle class is nowadays composed of wealthy state white-collars , such as corrupted security officials , state-owned enterprise managers and the likes . 
  if the regime does eventually fall , they 'll be fucked up . 
  granted , there 's still the independent business community left in the big cites but it 's unlikely that they are make a majority ( although the latter will most likely be better off in this case ) . 
  so , it 's the entire elite that is fighting for life , not a small group on the top . 
   the tale of the princes of vladimir has been attributed either to dmitry gerasimov or pachomius the serb , among other learned monks . 
  essentially , a story that was made up by a group of bootlicking monks desperately trying to suck up to a future * tsar * . 
  nonetheless , it was sofia who was firstly obsessed with the idea of the third rome . 
  would be interesting , although i doubt we 'd see it in retail any time soon . 
   just to confirm that russia stronk . 
  who on earth would need proof of this undeniable truth ? 
  i mean , come on . 
  i ca n't keep a straight face any longer . 
  have a good time !, 
  you have a strange idea about computing power . 
  the first gen raspberry pi is pretty much capable of handling basic tasks , such as surfing the web , playing media files or even gaming . 
  it has a real performance about 0.04 gflops ( 24 for the graphic subsystem ) , which is orders of magnitude lower than the throughput of the elbrus cpu .
