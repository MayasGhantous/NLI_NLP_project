  i do n't even count poland or the baltic states as `` friendly '' , haha . 
  think more along the lines of africa , asia and cuba . 
  it would be much better if russia had only the february revolution to go through . 
  or , in the worst case , lenin 's russia , living into the new economic policy . 
  last time i heard that they order microchips in taiwan . 
  55 savushkina str , saint-petersburg . 
  * if * they got into power and * if * they had something to give in return . 
  after the fall of the ussr , the rufed wrote off about [ $ 140 bn ] ( http://smart-lab.ru/blog/155249.php ) of hopeless debts of our former friends , such as mongolia , vietnam , the best korea and cuba , to name a few . 
  god knows , how much money was pumped into these ~ ~ shitholes ~ ~ beautiful countries during the cold war . 
   yet you still see him as `` saviour '' and the west as `` assholes '' yet i see both sides as the same assholes . 
  i almost got my arse frozen off protesting in the last three years or so . 
  so what ? 
  may i have a cookie ? 
  i 'm in a bad mood today . 
  it was not your fault that you came across that way to me . 
  cheers . 
  cutting the largest banks from the int ' l credit lines ? 
  banning export of technologies ? 
  putting sanctions on the oil & gas industries , the only ones that bring petrodollars into the country ? 
  on the ground it looks like the western business is getting afraid to deal with russian firms and individuals . 
  toxic assets , toxic country . 
  they just do n't know for sure , which one is/will be under sanctions and which one is not . 
  it 's more safe for them to refuse the deal today and lose a little profit than to get into hot water tomorrow . 
   disingenuous to whine have a nice day , buddy . 
  come back when you learn some manners . 
  we 're also not equally supporting the aggression towards ukraine , y' know . 
  in our case it does n't help anything though . 
  the ussr supported a whole lot of `` marxist '' militants in africa etc. 
  i 'm aware the food ban is self-imposed . 
  i 'm talking about the crippling the economy in a general sense . 
  yes , those people . 
  do you know them all by names ? 
  go sanction the shit out of them , haha . 
  the reason i keep talking about sanctions is that the entire thread is about sanctions . 
  and yes , i do consider the west as a bunch of assholes that brings misery to my life . 
  why should i think otherwise ? 
  they do it , it 's reality . 
  regardless of a person `` who got us there '' , it 's still the * western * sanctions imposed on the whole country , instead of the people that are directly responsible . 
  the russians , as a nation , are being held responsible for electing the wrong people into office . 
  i do n't understand what we are arguing about, 
  you 're forgetting a bunch of `` socialistic '' countries which sucked money and resources from the ussr . 
   military products generally cost roughly the same to build no matter where you build them well , it 's generally not true . 
  it 's only somewhat applicable to the state-of-the-art technology , such as fighter jets etc. 
   russia smuggles microchips ... for the reverse engineering . 
  it 's doubtful that they may use it as-is . 
   old men in suits do n't have power , in the sum of things . 
  that 's one debatable statement . 
  do n't they , really ? 
  you 're moving the goalposts here . 
  people 's response to the sanctions is irrelevant to the fact that said sanctions were imposed in the first place . 
  in case you forgot , prior to the last presidential / parliament elections there were no territories annexed and the relations with the west were mostly fine . 
  we 're talking about the * western * sanctions here . 
   it 's not about hurting ** wealthy ** russians , ** ftfy ** yeah , let 's starve the shit out the poorest instead . 
  your comment does n't make any sense . 
  couple of billionaires from the inner circle got banned from the beaches of florida ? 
  i 'm sure they 've just cried out a river . 
  oh , wait , they did n't . 
  what 's about both chambers of the parliament that voted ( except for one guy , unanimously ) for the annexation ? 
  not that the location of their property in miami is unknown , right ? 
  wake me up when the west will grow a pair . 
  exhibit a : the best korea . 
  they may be lagging behind the developed world as long as it pleases them but they are still alive !, 
  therefore , technologies are not vital to survive for some autocratic countries . 
  i do n't think so . 
  after all , i remember the 80s very well . 
  most people had stopped giving a damn about ideology long before the ussr came to the end . 
  stalin did n't come out of the blue . 
  he was a product of the wartime communism through and through . 
  i mean , back in the 1930s , there were a lot of people who really believed in the final victory of communism . 
  then in the 70-80s ... not really . 
  treating soldiers as cattle is a long standing tradition in the motherland . 
  so , there 's nothing new on that front . 
  do you realize that the middle class these days is mostly composed of corrupted bureaucrats , cops , army officers et al. 
  falling of the regime will have their lives ruined , either way . 
  just for the record , i hated living in the ussr as much as the next guy . 
  in my opinion , the soviets crashed mostly due to a lack of willing to continue with building the world 's communism . 
  i doubt that matters somehow . 
  the leadership simply adopted the low-hanging fruit strategy of exploiting * a phantom pain in russia 's amputated limbs * . 
  people are weak and tend to get into troubles for stupid ideas , such as restoring the russian empire etc. 
  after the fall of the soviets , the western bloc came to be seen as a model country for many , many here . 
  it 's hard to say where we hit a tipping point . 
  in case you did n't notice a * subtle * reference to the kosovo thing at the end of my comment , it 's there . 
  what 's wrong with the flag ? 
  the military complex wo n't need a lot of money to be spent on the stuff that is domestically produced . 
  according to [ pew global ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/06/10/2-russian-public-opinion-putin-praised-west-panned/ ) , a vast majority of the russians hold negative views towards nato , the u.s. and eu . 
  the propaganda on tv did an amazing job of ruining everything positive about the west gained over the last decades . 
  i guess the end goal of sanctions is to wreck the economy ( especially in the military sector ) to the point where it can no longer cause any damage to the neighbouring countries . 
  no one cares what the russians will be thinking about their leaders at that point . 
  what really matters is to make an example from the country . 
  redrawing borders in europe is a big no-no in this day and age ... 
  unless you are not nato , hahahaha . 
  all the people i know went banana . 
  soon i will have no one left to talk to . 
  a fun fact . 
  most guys wearing tracksuits that i see in moscow these days are either of north asian origins or the ukrainian refugees . 
  [ dolls # 249 - a true story of putin - little zaches - english subs ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezjx9bgwdv0 ), 
  speak for yourself . 
  i guess it 's been mostly volga germans and russian jews who have moved to germany . 
  it 's doubtful that many of them are salivating at the idea of restoring the russian empire . 
   they always saying idiots do .
