  also , from what i heard , black guys are easily getting all the girls esp. , in distant areas because they look ` exotic ' . 
  tl ; dr : the entire article is bullshit . 
  i believe nothing can be done to achieve change in attitude towards russia . 
  at this point , it is n't even worth trying . 
  regardless of government policy , no matter how either aggressive or peaceful it would be , the root of contemporary controversies lies deep within the history . 
  more specifically , the main problem is a completely different mindset of an average inhabitant of russia . 
  such a mindset is incompatible to its average european counterpart unless both sides would go to the great lengths in order to improve mutual understanding . 
  no need to explain that it wo n't happen anytime soon . 
  sources : my ass , mixed ethnics , and the most important part : 29 volume set of [ `` the history of russia since ancient times '' ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%98%d1%81%d1%82%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%8f_%d0%a0%d0%be%d1%81%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%b8_%d1%81_%d0%b4%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%bd%d0%b5%d0%b9%d1%88%d0%b8%d1%85_%d0%b2%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%bc%d1%91%d0%bd ) written by [ sergey solovyov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sergey_solovyov ) in 19th century . 
  many would call it madness but i 've read the entire thing once , for real . 
   why , what were they meeting about ? 
  and why were they arrested ? 
  the government promised them state apartments but have n't given nothing at all . 
  they arrested because public gatherings are prohibited if the organizers did n't get a permit from authorities first . 
  a permit theoretically can be obtained in the mayor 's office but obviously not in this case . 
   any chance to get a quick summary of what that means ? 
  different colors mean different factions , it 's in the provided guide . 
  this map is given in the polar coordinates , where the distance from the center is inversely proportional to the power of the politician . 
   is that a chance to secure funds for putin/kremlin in case the economy get worse ? 
  who are we to make assumptions about the leader 's wallet ? 
  / s well , this company follows the latest trend , fleeing away from russia . 
   and thanks for doing russia this week  it was my pleasure !, 
  well , he * was * a some kind of liberal politician , whatever it means in russia . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  iirc , in orthodox tradition this number has no upper limit . 
  it 's rather about herpes , is n't it ? 
  i 'm guessing cost of materials and labor is much higher in europe . 
  initial cost was [ 10,7 billions of rubles ] ( http://samara.onfoot.ru/sights/bridges/437.html ) , recent report says [ 12 billions ] ( http://ru-an.info/%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b8/%d0%ba%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b2%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%b9-%d0%bc%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82-%d0%b2-%d1%81%d0%b0%d0%bc%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b5-%d0%be%d1%82%d0%ba%d1%80%d1%8b%d0%bb%d0%b8-%d0%b4%d0%bb%d1%8f-%d0%b4%d0%b2%d0%b8%d0%b6%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f/ ) . 
  does anyone ever read the comments on the news articles ? 
  lenta.ru is famous with its vatnik brigades . 
  the similar article on [ lenta.ru ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2flenta.ru%2farticles%2f2014%2f10%2f27%2freachethnic%2f&amp;edit-text= ) , nice info graphic though . 
  * the ethnic composition of the richest citizens of russia : * nationality | number in the list | billions of $ $ | % in the list | % of the population -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | russians | 89 | 165,0 | 44,5 | 80,90 jews | 42 | 122,3 | 21,0 | 0,11 ukrainans | 24 | 70,4 | 12,0 | 1,41, 
  that was a weak call , mr erdogan . 
  look at the [ dacha of rottenberg brothers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ibdbw2a.jpg ) near moscow . 
  i would n't exactly label it `` scary '' though . 
  ass-licking as a tradition is an older than oil painting on the russian soil . 
  plesetsk is a single launching site for spacecraft within borders of russia . 
  where else would they launch this rocket ? 
  it was aimed on a target 1.500 km away of japan which is pretty far from finland . 
  like everywhere in russia . 
  it depends on a price . 
  given a chance , i 'd buy some of these paintings , it 's just a kitsch . 
  i 'm guessing authors were not getting paid enough . 
  granted , propaganda might be a piece of arts but definitely not in this case . 
  many pictures look like the result of a photoshop contest among newbies . 
  that 's why there are so many politicians worldwide those that feel animosity towards the internet , especially , i guess , towards archive and search sites . 
  i bet many of them would be totally happy if the information about their past actions could be erased or blocked . 
  my pleasure . 
  the story of milonov 's cronies is the russian politics in a nutshell . 
  thanks a lot , it 's my first attempt . 
  edit : added link to the article and guide . 
  in fact , there is nothing like that on itar-tass . 
  i guess it 's a fake .

  ^ edit : ^ grammar , ^ formatting, 
  gazeta.ru recently published [ an interesting article ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.gazeta.ru%2fpolitics%2f2014%2f10%2f31_a_6284709.shtml&amp;edit-text= ) entitled as `` donbass volunteers threatened with criminal cases [ in russia ] '' . 
  one of the top commanders of separatists , igor bezler , resigned today . 
  at least , girkin aka strelkov said so . 
  [ \u0420\u0421\u041d : gt ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.rusnovosti.ru%2fnews%2f349736&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  of course , it 's only an assumption but it seems like kremlin has had enough with uncontrolled insurgents and tries to tighten its grasp on military power in the region . 
  sceptical attitude towards kremlin among separatists is known very well . 
  meanwhile , domestic displeasure has been growing steadily . 
  even kp.ru ( the pro-kremlin beacon of vatniks ) [ whined yesterday ] ( http://www.kp.ru/daily/26303.7/3181020/ ) that the tough times have come blah-blah and russians are losing their courage and patriotic mood seeing growing prices . 
  is it a rhetorical question , is n't it ? 
  it 's called `` war '' . 
  both ( better to say ` all ' ) sides of the conflict have the same equipment and weapons , that 's why they look almost indistinguishable from one another . 
  this pictures remind of wars within the former yugoslavia . 
  a sad part is that locals got the shit end of the stick , as usual . 
  considering the number of different factions involved it is hardly a proxy war anymore , seems more like a full-blown civil war . 
  i was under the impression that both of you were talking about the present situation . 
  apologies , i misread your comment . 
  could you name a region in russia which tends to secede , aside from caucasus republics , of course ? 
  another mother is on a personal crusade then ?
