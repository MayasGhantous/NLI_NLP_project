   he wanted to be friends with russia he wanted to use the russian influence for sorting out american issues with the region . 
  it 's pretty far from `` friendship '' in my book . 
   what could have made him change his mind about russia , i wonder . 
  that 's what i 'm talking about . 
  it is the whole country which he seeks to hold responsible for actions of a few . 
  i feel it was the passage of infamous `` gay propaganda '' law that firstly caused the uproar in the western media . 
  ironically , the western reaction has only made things worse for the local lgbt community . 
  as always though . 
   everybody -- the whole world -- is against russia . 
  well , mr obama himself [ has put russia between the isis and ebola ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2784702/as-ebola-isis-russia-president-obama-night-admits-there-s-sense-world-spinning-fast-able-control.html ) , as a grave threat to the world . 
  that means that from the point of view of this dude , all 143m of us are lumped together with the murderous jihadists . 
  well done . 
  even most self-hating and liberal russians are coming to the realisation that the west is out to get us , regardless of political views , simply on the base of nationality . 
  way to go . 
  anyways , most of them are just idle wankers staring at the wall . 
   perhaps another figurehead will be groomed in the coming 12 months . 
  doubt that . 
  * anyone * in the president position , regardless of being loyal to the dearest leader , may put him in grave danger . 
   because of the legacy of the holodomor . 
  crimea has never had a ukrainian majority . 
  neither it was a part of ukraine prior to 1991 . 
  if you look through the census data , you can see that the percentage of ukrainians had been growing up steadily even in the 1930-1940 . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_crimea#ethnicities_.26_languages ) , just so you know . 
  edit : as for south ossetia ... georgians have made about 25 % of the population since the 1920s . 
  [ wiki : demographics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_ossetia#demographics ) . 
  honestly , i do n't see the dearest leader stepping down . 
  not anymore , at this point . 
  it would make him extremely vulnerable . 
  reshuffling the government , on the other hand , ca n't achieve anything - a half of the population wo n't even notice that . 
   then there 'll be token regime change does anyone really believe it ? 
  i fail to see the logic here ... 
  hehe . 
  my mother considers moving to riga , she has a right to obtain a permanent residence permit on the ground of family reunion . 
  the westerners themselves are a major turn on ... 
  welcome !, 
  by the way , saint-petersburg is much better in this regard . 
  second this . 
  i feel pity on the westerners . 
  it seems they have a huge shortage of the good-looking girls . 
  the ussr has been referred to as `` the prison of nations '' for a reason . 
  unfortunately , many `` fellow russians '' have a load of sawdust in between their ears . 
  winnie the pooh could make a good scientist here . 
  looks like the [ sayan mountains ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sayan_mountains ) for me , but it 's just an assumption . 
  if you had in mind nomadic deer herders , they live up in the north , no one is stripping them of the land ( if they even need any ) . 
  poles had been deported to komi assr , balts - to northern kazakhstan and trans-baikal . 
  [ here 's a map ] ( http://zrada.org/images/stories/2014/03/783-4.jpg ) , just so you know . 
  regardless of that , are you implying that the former convicts should have a good feeling about their prison or what ? 
  baltics/poland had to pay for the far east ? 
  flair checks out , haha . 
  changing a title by the editorial board of themoscowtimes ca n't be helped . 
  next time i 'll make a screenshot of the page . 
  my apologies . 
   three residents of the town of novorussky in the rostov region , which borders ukraine , had been spending sunday at a lake near the village and in the evening decided to take their picture at a nearby border checkpoint , a spokesperson for the border guard service of the federal security service , or fsb , was quoted as saying by news agency interfax . 
   a ukrainian serviceman stationed at the checkpoint shouted `` stop '' and then opened fire , injuring one of the `` selfie aficionados , '' nikolai sinitsin , a spokesman for the border guard service in the rostov region was quoted as saying by news agency ria novosti . 
  [ a graph ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/minard.png ) illustrating the size of napoleon 's army during invasion ( light-brown line ) and retreat ( black line ) . 
  he is , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  comrade 3dom has a valid point though . 
  shooting a random airliner out of the skies is a moment of retardness that is more appropriate to the middle eastern `` freedom fighters '' ( muh racism from my side ) than to a regular army . 
  military works using patterns , protocols and guidelines . 
  had the army decided to assist the `` rebels '' they would have deployed a whole buk system ( 4-6 vehicles or even more ) to e ukraine , as opposed to a single launcher with a mediocre radar . 
  so , it does look like a covert false flag op that went the wrong way . 
  soviet union had an aim of spreading communism . 
  `` protection of the russian speakers '' is a fairytale for the media . 
  since the fall of the ussr , millions of said `` speakers '' have been ethnically cleansed from the former soviet republics no one gave two shits about it . 
  ok , i do see an excuse , albeit a far-fetched one , but it 's not enough . 
  could you give me one solid reason that is worth a risk of invoking the article 5 of nato ? 
  what 's with all the warmongers spreading this bullshit everywhere ? 
  is there a single reason for russia to attack the baltics ? 
  amber ? 
  potato ? 
  anschluss of palanga and j\u016brmala ? 
  if navalny is not good enough for you , then you should drop any expectations about the russian politics . 
  he is by far the best choice at this point . 
  considering that his successor may well be from the likes of strelkov , it 's not encouraging anyway . 
  i was referring exactly to that video ... 
  seriously speaking , most of `` surveys '' of this kind can be easily debunked by some common sense thinking . 
  are you sure ?

   it really does n't help your current image no problem . 
  over the last year i 've given up any hope for the happy ending in the story . 
  so , moscow is more lgbt-friendly than kiev these days ? 
  haha , it was unexpected . 
  it 's hard to say anything for certain . 
  older russians may recall the ussr with nostalgia . 
  not that the life was good , no . 
  we * were * young and healthy back then . 
  younger ussr fanboys are just idiots . 
  i do n't even know a single guy of my age who miss the good ol' days of breadlines and shortages of everything . 
  we goddamn lived through it . 
   also why did the russians not revolt and overthrow the bolsheviks ? 
  the bolsheviks indeed improved the life in many regards . 
  women 's rights , worker 's rights , to name a few . 
  it 's also worth mentioning that the bolsheviks were not exactly the most timid group to deal with . 
  [ war communism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_communism ) . 
  bolsheviks ( now known as the communists ) wanted to form the ussr and , later , turn the whole world into the worker 's paradise . 
  [ fourth international ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourth_international ) , the more you know . 
  the opinion of the russians was irrelevant . 
  no one asked people what they want . 
  forbes says that it happened on [ 20 jan 1991 ] ( http://www.forbes.ru/sites/default/files/slideshow/2012/02/03_tass_47204.jpg ) . 
  the protests were triggered by the [ january events ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/january_events_ ( lithuania \\ ) ) in vilnius and other lithuanian cities .
