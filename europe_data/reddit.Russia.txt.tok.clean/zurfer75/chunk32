  [ 4 feb 1990 ] ( http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/vgil/24090713/435605/435605_original.jpg ) , about 300.000 ( some say up to a million ) moscow protesters demanded to abolish the article 6 of the constitution ( the leading role of the communist party ) . 
  by the way , on 14 jan 1991 , at the same place , hundreds of thousands muscovites ( est. 
  ranges from 100k to 500k ) rallied against the occupation of lithuania , hehe . 
  i guess kids nowadays do n't even know about it and we are enemies again . 
  what a shitty time to be alive . 
  ps : 15 yo me is somewhere in the crowd . 
  we do , lol . 
  [ 12 jun ] ( http://origin.iknowit.ru/paper1135.html ) . 
  no one knows for sure what it is . 
  how long has it been since you stopped drinking in the morning ? 
  dunno about the embargo . 
  to me the prices go up along with the euro exchange rates . 
  in case of k\u00f6nig it may well be a local shortage of certain pills . 
  for european-made medicines the prices are almost twice as high as they used to be . 
  same shit in russia . 
  the medicine prices surged last winter as a result of the rouble 's drop in value , and remain high since then , due to negative market expectations . 
  the mortality rate already [ went up by 5.2 % ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2015/05/08/diedrussia/ ) during the first quarter of 2015 . 
  the average pension in the rufed is roughly [ 200 euro per month ] ( http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2698644 ) , while the minimum cost of living [ has risen up to 152 euro ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2015/06/05/minimum/ ) recently . 
  the price of a blister of tablets ranges from 5 to 30 euro , no matter what it is .

  all that had value and could be carried off was stolen by kgb before the final accord . 
  your ukrainian delegate did n't have to be bribed to know that . 
   writing music prokofiev , shostakovich , khachaturian , schnittke, 
  i guess it 's designed for building temporary checkpoints or something like that . 
  yeah , i remember the suggestion that four grades of elementary school would be enough for the russians . 
  aaand godwin 's law has been invoked . 
   as long as these states do not attack neighbours , they can be anything they want . 
  well , saudi arabia is bombing the shit out of yemen as we speak . 
  they do it , due to a request of the ousted president , without a permission of the un , just because they can . 
  do n't you see any parallels in this ? 
  by the way , i 'm yet to see them being sanctioned to dust . 
  how come that the int ' l community has turned a blind eye to them ? 
   evidences of people tolerating their swiftly brainwashed piss-poor people who believe in their mission of helping to save a neighbour 's ass from le ebil gay nazis ? 
  that 's something unheard of . 
  and yet you insist that this country being even more stupid is a good thing ? 
   then , you should probably talk more to your compatriots , excuse me , could you please refrain from patronizing me ? 
  you know jack shit about my circle . 
  thank you . 
   not every state with an army is a fascist state fair enough . 
  that being said , there are plenty of countries that fall into this category . 
  most islamic countries could be described as fascist states , by all means . 
  evidences of what , exactly ? 
  the annexation of crimea , a covert war in donbass , what 's it all about ? 
  to me these things look like the catastrophic result of a wrong political decision . 
   have you ever been to russia ? 
  i 've been living there for 40 years . 
  i do n't know where you pulled it off . 
  education in general and science in particular are non-arguably good for people . 
  full stop . 
  political climate is a by-product of the overall culture & education . 
  unless you decide to get rid of the country 's population , you have to deal with it , either way . 
  a little crane and/or a hoist can be installed even on a pickup . 
  i 'm fairly sure that it 's a default option for a military truck , 
  i 'm reading just fine , thank you . 
  my point still stands . 
  saying that russia is an imminent threat to others is like saying that every country with an army is an imminent threat . 
  western values have nothing to do with the current war . 
  it 's merely paranoia of a narrow circle of the wrong people . 
  bro , do you even [ lift ? 
  science and education are coming together . 
  oh , come on !, 
  ukraine is full of the same hillbillies as russia does . 
  it 's just a matter of who is in power . 
  portraying the russians as some sort of eternal evil is ridiculous . 
  i 'm really sorry but wtf are you talking about ? 
  unload it from a truck , put bricks one on another and call it a day !, 
  six guys and 10 min maximum . 
  apologies in advance but it 's bullshit . 
  you do n't need rocket science to wage a war . 
  what you need is an educated population that could prevent it . 
  why not ? 
  75 kg is a weight that can be easily lifted by two average dudes . 
  it 's not a lie , haha . 
  believe it or not , not everything that the government does is some evil plot . 
  they simply did n't count illegal migrants , that 's it . 
  yeah , because ignorance and stupidity always lead to peace . 
  nobel prize winners in literature : pasternak , sholokhov , solzhenitsyn , brodsky . 
  well , i just wanted to point out that demanding transparency in finance is absolutely reasonable and just . 
  the other concern is that it would be used for achieving the current political goals , even though it would be not so good for a country in general . 
  i think you misread my comment . 
  cutting all ties with the west is vital for the regime to survive . 
  it makes no difference for them , to counter the spreading of western values or wahhabi . 
  no matter what a ngo is doing , if it involves exchanging ideas with the west , it will be closed . 
  because they do n't need a visa to enter the country ? 
  while i disagree with longes ' attitude about closing this particular fund , keeping an eye on the source of financing is a common practice that makes a lot of sense . 
  i mean , it would be irresponsible of the state to allow someone open a ngo named , say , `` the light of knowledge '' which would be spreading the wahhabi propaganda getting money from the rich qatari . 
  there 's a huge gap today between official and non-official numbers in the ethnic breakdown . 
  ethnicity | official ( 2010 census ) | non-official -- | -- | -- russian | 8.808.009 | 8.808.009 ukrainian | 253.644 | 700.000 tatar | 166.083 | 900.000 armenian | 124.425 | 500.000 azeri | 95.563 | 1.500.000 jews | 79.359 | 200.000 belorussian | 59.353 | 100.000 georgian | 54.387 | 300.000 uzbek | 24.312 | 150.000 chechen | 14.465 | 250.000 korean | 8.630 | 15.000 bashkir | 5.941 | 100.000 moldovan | 5.000 | 300.000 vietnamese | < 5.000 | 240.000 tadzhik | < 5.000 | 200.000 chinese | < 5.000 | 200.000 dagestani | < 5.000 | 50.000 total | 10.126.424 | 15.108.009 russians | 86,98 % | 58,3 % non-russians | 13,12 % | 41,7 % [ source ] ( http://www.rosbalt.ru/nazmsk/ ), 
   with an official population of 12.5 million , russia 's capital is now home to at least 1.5 million muslims , according to political analyst alexei malashenko . 
  ** this is by far more than the muslim population of any other european city where the local population is not predominantly muslim ** . 
  i call bs on this one . 
  several cities in europe have a higher percentage of muslims . 
  source : [ list of cities in the european union by muslim population ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_in_the_european_union_by_muslim_population ), 
  i simply pointed out your mistake . 
   russia is not the soviet union nor can it be the legal successor of the soviet union . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_union#dissolution  following the dissolution of the soviet union on 26 december 1991 , ** russia was internationally recognized [ 43 ] as its legal successor on the international stage . 
  ** to that end , russia voluntarily accepted all soviet foreign debt and claimed overseas soviet properties as its own . 
  under the 1992 lisbon protocol , russia also agreed to receive all nuclear weapons remaining in the territory of other former soviet republics . 
  since then , the russian federation has assumed the soviet union 's rights and obligations .
