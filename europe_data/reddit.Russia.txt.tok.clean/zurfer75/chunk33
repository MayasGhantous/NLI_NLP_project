  that 's why russia had to pay off the debt of the ussr . 
  well , my friend was n't * that * aggressive . 
  just cocky and selfish and was a dick towards girls all the time . 
  the `` street codex '' tell us that we have to help a friend engaged in a fight even though it was him who started all the mess . 
  i was mad at him because he never ever tried to evaluate the chances before dragging us into trouble . 
  if you please , i prefer not to go into details of my later life experiences . 
  it was the 90s , after all . 
  everyone i knew was involved in some shady stuff . 
  hence the certain kind of people we all met along the way . 
  i had a georgian chechen friend in school . 
  he was a sick motherfucker . 
  i also met others who were not so friendly though it all came to a good end . 
  having said that , not everyone i knew had been as lucky as me . 
  it 's not like oil has ever been a big deal . 
  the chechen leader is an ally of moscow and he has a private army that will never hesitate to suppress any kind of internal dissent in the country . 
  for me it looks like giving the lowest bow possible to the dearest leader . 
  [ this is what i see in the picture . 
  ] ( http://www.likecroatia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/game-of-thrones-iron-throne.jpg ), 
   are chechens also that infamous in your country ? 
  yes , they are . 
  the most dangerous people i 've ever met . 
   you american peasants ah , would that it were true . 
   going to jail for it ? 
  except he is n't . 
  in the worst case , he can be fined up to twice the value of the smuggled goods + 2.000 rub ( ~ $ 32 ) .

  [ energy ministry confirms chevron leaves ukraine - 15-07-2015 ] ( http://www.nrcu.gov.ua/en/148/601634/ )  chevron energy corporation leaves the project on shale gas extraction in ukraine , spokesperson for the energy and coal industry ministry of ukraine hanna dudka said in a commentary to ukrinform . 
  at least , he was n't hacked to pieces with sabers . 
  it is unlikely that many of them actually reside in the rufed . 
  crappy english ( runglish ? ), 
  is a dead giveaway of a low-grade paid shill . 
  what did you expect from the title ? 
  not exactly about poland but close enough .

  a dead giveaway that history repeats itself as farce .

  an affiliate in olgino may be not existing anymore , since they moved the staff to a new building within the city limits . 
  its quite funny though how everyones convinced that olgino pays for shilling on reddit . 
  there have been a lot of leaked docs posted on the net , but to date i 've yet to see a single mention of this particular board . 
  i guess they want only the city . 
  look at that gem of investigative ^ housewife journalism !, 
  * sits back and awaits rotten tomatoes for being such a sexist *, 
  which is why i started with `` according to ... '' i saw a lot of estimates ranging from 600k to 750k . 
  edit : i guess no one knows the actual number . 
  tons of people go in and out the city daily . 
  [ according to pravda.com.ua ] ( http://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2015/07/18/7074926/ ) , at 8pm , shells landed on the hospital # 23 , two grocery stores , namely `` amstor '' and `` ukraina '' and caused damage to a private property ( with no further details ) . 
  [ according to the dnr ] ( http://www.rusdialog.ru/news/27980_1432304027 ) there are 950.000 people left in donetsk . 
  quantity does n't equal quality . 
  however , such a rapid growth makes me wonder the reason behind it . 
  i 'd rather describe it as a story about the unequal relationship and one-sided love that ended up badly . 
  i mean , it 's not only about humbert humbert being attracted to the little girls . 
  when you think about it , it paints a pretty grim picture of how a dark passion could ruin a life completely . 
  two lives , to be more precise . 
  `` i 've yet to read [ that book ] but condemn it anyway '' - it was said by an anonymous communist censor about `` doctor zhivago '' . 
  the irony is that boris pasternak was later awarded the nobel prize for `` that book '' . 
  who in their right mind would even label `` lolita '' as a book about pedophilia ? 
  i suppose only those who had never read this book . 
  it 's like saying that the odyssey is the world 's first guide to mediterranean tourism . 
  i guess it 's all due to cheap/free booze at all-inclusive resorts of turkey . 
  it wo n't be a big exaggeration if i say that some caucasus nations have been holding a grudge towards each other for * centuries * . 
  you ca n't win with these people . 
  personally , i think it would be great if russia were n't involved at all . 
  your mistake is that you 're looking at the situation from a purely political standpoint . 
  when it comes to the caucasus region , it 's almost never the case . 
  many people down there are mostly driven by emotions . 
  back in the early 90s , the georgians were heavily involved in the ethnic conflict in abkhazia and ossetia . 
  the outcome is pretty clear - they have been hated by the locals since then . 
  as simple as it gets . 
  do n't try to find a logic here , there are still a lot of people who think of the concept of justice as of some sort of vendetta . 
   presenting the bill on thursday , ukrainian president petro poroshenko insisted that the changes he is proposing would not turn ukraine into a federation . 
  he said that along with giving more powers to local authorities throughout the country , the bill allows broader autonomy in the areas the government is currently not controlling . 
   `` ukraine will stay a unitary state , '' poroshenko told the parliament . 
  hmm , he ca n't have a cake and eat it . 
  not to mention that it 's doubtful if kiev would ever find a common ground with the guys in charge of dnr/lnr . 
  not a `` gunmen '' but a freedom fighter , so it 's fine then . 
  all the governments have been under the thumb of reptiloids ever since our savior left us . 
  the dearest leader has most likely had a direct phone line to the other side . 
  the church is made of its followers . 
  russian orthodoxy is quite xenophobic by its nature . 
  there were a couple times when old babushkas , who accidentally discovered that i 'm of the `` wrong '' branch of christianity , started sobbing about this fact , as if i had leprosy or something worse . 
  thank you . 
  i just tried to find anything on the issue but had no luck . 
   russians invaded , kicked out ethnic georgians , and set up military bases ? 
  how it was started :  on the night of 5 january 1991 , 6,000 armed georgians entered tskhinvali . 
  after fierce street fighting , the georgian forces were repelled and driven out of tshkinvali by south ossetian troops . 
  [ 12 ]  as a result of the war , approximately 100,000 ethnic ossetians fled from the south ossetian a.o. 
  and georgia proper , and 23,000 ethnic georgians fled from the south ossetian a.o. 
  into ethnically georgian areas . 
  100 villages were reportedly destroyed in south ossetia by both sides . 
  how it all ended :  the human rights watch concluded that the `` south ossetian forces sought to ethnically cleanse '' the georgian-populated areas . 
  [ 9 ] in 2009 , the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe resolutions condemned `` the ethnic cleansing and other human rights violations in south ossetia , as well as the failure of russia and the de facto authorities to bring these practices to a halt and their perpetrators to justice '' . 
  via [ wiki : ethnic cleansing of georgians in south ossetia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_cleansing_of_georgians_in_south_ossetia ), 
   which the un has already declared illegal had they ? 
   russian orthodoxy you did n't the article , did you ? 
  of course not . 
   a moderator 's message on the blocked webpage said that the move was due to a ruling by a court in the mainly muslim north caucasus region of ** chechnya ** in may 2015 . 
  i often see this magic number surfacing in surveys : - [ 81 % ] ( http://fom.ru/obraz-zhizni/11470 ) have never been outside the former ussr - [ 89 % ] ( http://gtmarket.ru/news/2014/05/28/6787 ) ca n't speak bloody english - [ 80 % ] ( http://www.newsru.com/russia/10jul2015/pro80.html ) are against the gay marriage - [ 89 % ] ( http://top.rbc.ru/politics/24/06/2015/558a80089a7947cedeece913 ) approve of the activities of the dearest leader [ coincidence ?
