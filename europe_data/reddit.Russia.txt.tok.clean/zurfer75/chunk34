  i was being a tad facetious . 
  however , it 's well known that the city center is quite unpopular among the locals on weekends . 
  a vast majority of migrants are also white . 
  ethnic russians hanging around the red square and tverskoy blvd on the weekend ? 
  sounds plausible / s, 
  mind you that the anti-gay sentiment in its current form emerged in st. petersburg this time . 
  for a `` cultural capital '' that city is causing too many troubles . 
  i used to be one of them . 
  the situation is a bit complicated but i 'll try to explain . 
  i 'm far from putting the blame solely on the muslim community . 
  propaganda plays a major role in the recent surge of homophobic sentiment . 
  however , the recent migrants from the former soviet asian republics and north caucasus have one thing in common : they are firmly indoctrinated into religious beliefs and ideas of machismo . 
  much more than the local muslims , who are mostly fine . 
  considering that the migrants presumably come from poor , backwater regions and have a lack of education - that is not exactly surprising . 
  i may be a bit harsh on this topic but putting a spoonful of tar spoils a jar of honey . 
  especially , if the jar were filled with shit from the start . 
  it 's worth mentioning that the video is a bit tricky . 
  i mean , the guys are walking through the touristic areas in the city centre ... what kind of a muscovite is going to waste their time having a walk there ? 
  such places are full of newcomers , migrants and one day visitors . 
  spb is generally considered a more `` european '' city , whatever that means . 
  not having a [ four million strong moslem diaspora ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_in_russia#islam_in_moscow ) is also helpful . 
  except for saint-petersburg , people 's reaction would be much worse . 
   shitty like oh , give it a rest !, 
  7 out of the 10 tallest building in europe are currently located in moscow , including the tallest one , vostok tower . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_tallest_buildings_in_europe ) . 
   none in other cities of russia could n't care less about `` other cities '' . 
  what does that have to do with moscow ? 
   dumbed please , do n't . 
  * `` a l'exemple de saturne , la r\u00e9volution d\u00e9vore ses enfants '' * `` the revolution devours its children '', 
   it may be hard to recognize or comprehend , but those people have their own manuals and their own traditions , not unlike the taliban . 
  child prostitution , poligamy , ban on education for women is among those . 
  golly , i hold my breath waiting !, 
  you are now moderator of / r/pyongyang !, 
  you 're right , all those buildings [ tightly packed in a small space . 
  yes , it is .

  i 'm 99 % sure that it 's true . 
  [ caucasus emirate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caucasus_emirate ) , 31 october 2007 -- present . 
   since the creation of the caucasus emirate , ** the group has abandoned its secular nationalist goals and fully adopted the ideology of salafist-takfiri jihadism ** which seeks to advance the cause of allah on the earth by waging war against the russian government and non-muslims in the north caucasus , such as the local sufi muslim population , whom they view as mushrikeen ( hypocrites ) who do not adhere to true islamic teachings . 
  in 2011 , the u.s. department of state included the caucasus emirate on its list of terrorist organisations .

  [ specially for you ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tgyhcsy.jpg ), 
   since the start of the year , a new russian migration law has required foreign workers from countries outside the eurasian economic union customs bloc to pass russian language and history tests , acquire expensive permits and pay steep monthly fees to keep the jobs they have been doing for years . 
  so , if i get it right , from the point of view of the muricans ^ tm we are guilty of `` fueling the is '' because of establishing a minimal migration control ? 
  strange as it may seem , russian girls often come across as more homophobic than the men . 
  straight from the article you linked :  with these gains , harbin aurora will be able to position itself next to russia 's monocrystal as another global giant in the sapphire industry .

  fair enough . 
  that 's what you get when there 's no a single pollster left that can be trusted . 
  ` faux ' is a key word here . 
  in the eyes of an average guy , girls are supposed to be ` playful ' with each other , that 's the reason why lesbian porn is not perceived as perverted . 
  it 's more along the lines of the imaginary clandestine behavior , `` all the girls do it when the boys are not around '' . 
  i guess this hillbilly attitude derives from the stalin times , when the male homosexuality was re-criminalized but lesbianism was left in limbo , as a non-existent thing . 
   the number of those who think gay people should be allowed to get married has decreased from 14 percent in 2005 to 8 percent in 2015 . 
  according to the poll , only 3 percent of respondents said lgbt people should be able to bring up children . 
  another 3 percent supported the idea of marriage , but said children should not be brought up in such households .

  the expansion of the monthly production volume is planned to increase from 4 to 5 million equivalent units of finished product . 
  this will allow the manufacturer to the end of the year to take 30 % of the world market . 
  what a shame !, 
  among other things , i had been a c/asm x86 guy for a long time , now i 'm trying to get back into coding because i goddamn like it , but there 's zero demand here .
