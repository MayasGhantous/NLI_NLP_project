  it takes like 30 min from takeoff to landing . 
  take the bus or drive yourself . 
  edit : or better use a catapult . 
  we 're being told the same thing about the us . 
  got ta keep the balance . 
  no , it ca n't , unless a court sends you to prison for `` hooliganism '' . 
  history repeats itself first as tragedy second as farce . 
  toy stalinism , fluffy fascism . 
  and the gross incompetence goes on and on , through and through . 
  these clowns did n't even manage to make an exclusive design for the `` flag '' - they just stole it from a bunch of french halfwits . 
  when every goddamn noun can be turned into a diminutive in a handful of different ways , your question does n't make any sense . 
  do n't even get me started on insults - there 's an infinite amount of possible ways to attack someone . 
  it 's none of my business but imo , it looks more like the katyn massacre . 
  i do n't think that slapping the word `` genocide '' on every goddamn war atrocity is a good idea . 
  doing it , we belittle the meaning of this term . 
  i think the approach of the un to the issue is a ) purely political b ) one-sided . 
  yes , yet . 
  your statement is still incorrect . 
  [ bbc weather - saint-petersburg ] ( http://www.bbc.com/weather/498817?day=0 ) . 
   otherwise it 's the national version of a guy locked away in his room reading propaganda and fuming about the world he never interacts with ; it 's radicalizing , and dangerous . 
  you 've just described a pipe dream of the regime . 
   at least two studios in the central city of nizhnevartovsk have reportedly been sent letters by local authorities asking them to stop hosting yoga classes being taught in municipal buildings . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-bans-yoga-as-part-of-crackdown-on-religious-cults-10355676.html ) tl ; dr : in the middle of siberian nowhere , two yoga classes has been banned from municipal buildings . 
  russia has n't banned yoga yet . 
  even a broken clock is right twice a day . 
  it was the least we could do for our brothers ; _ ; even though the politicians did it just in spite of the homo gay west . 
  if so , insurance companies would have a field day with that . 
   twenty-one launches will be performed by arianespace using the russian soyuz rocket with an additional 39 launches provided by virgin galactic 's launcherone . 
  it 's gon na be a helluva amount of work . 
  funny , there are likely chechens fighting on both sides . 
  it 'll never bring any backlash . 
  never . 
  i was thinking more along the lines of the yeltzin times . 
  anyway , i see no point in going deeper into that , sorry . 
  the west lost a chance of turning russia to their side long before the war in ukraine . 
  even before a brief war with georgia ... 
  i disagree with orthoxerox in part of the necessity of a pro-russian government . 
  imo , a * national unity * government is more appreciated in terms of stopping the fight . 
  such a government could be more complacent about the rufed , especially if the latter would stop stirring the pot and pull out the troops . 
   this is the type of propaganda that riles up hatred for both sides . 
  on a side note , it was frightening ( albeit entertaining ) to watch how the greeks were quickly , over a span of a couple weeks , demonized in the press . 
  as a bystander to the conflict , after reading the news lately , i picture a typical greek as a fat , obnoxious guy with greedy eyes , who steals candy from an emaciated german child . 
  ( in fact , i do n't , of course ), 
  state owned assets can get turned into private companies . 
  i mean , having so much at stake , they 'll be trying hard to evade the ruling of the court .

  we 're here for having fun above all else . 
  it would be unjust to the non-political part of the government . 
  they are doing their best to keep the boat afloat . 
  i 'm struggling to see them paying 50 bn to the former yukos shareholders . 
  eh ... it 's a sort of fairy tale . 
  the regime does n't give a damn about the national interests . 
  overplaying the europe 's hand in the dick contest is only thing that matters . 
  edit : as for your question - [ russia 's rainy-day reserve fund could run out in a year and a half ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/russia-s-rainy-day-reserve-fund-could-run-out-in-a-year-and-a-half-finance-minister/519691.html ) . 
  russia has [ $ 356 bn ] ( http://www.cbr.ru/eng/hd_base/?prtid=mrrf_m ) left in the int ' l reserves . 
  not to mention that they 've lost about $ 90 bn over the last year . 
  if there 's a chance to gamble then now is the right time to try . 
  if climate conditions could be left unchanged during transition , it would be nice to have all lands west of the border ( except the uk , obviously ) replaced with the caribbean sea .

  there are people of many ethnicities , including russians , who are working together to make the moscow times better . 
  and zhirinovsky is half-jew , by the way . 
  cut your racist crap . 
  those pesky foreigners !, 
  always meddling in the internal affairs with their suspicious money , capacitities and skills . 
  do n't be so bloodthirsty . 
  these people are no less brainwashed than novorossya 's `` fighters '' . 
  i 'm also fairly sure that rallies , such as this one , could only worsen the east-west tensions in the country . 
  the drone sounds like a swarm of angry bees . 
  i 've never said that . 
  there are , however , different degrees of responsibility . 
  are you accusing me in paying vat ? 
  it 's inevitable . 
  fair enough . 
  i 'm not paying taxes . 
  well , i 'm russian and i never ( by `` never '' i mean not even in 1999 ) voted for putin .

  another example of the `` counter-extremism '' fuckery : the head of a district in the far east [ got fined ] ( http://news.chita.ru/75208/ ) for posting a link to an old video made by navalny . 
  what is really crazy , the said video has been ruled out as `` pandering to extremism '' in 2013 . 
  the guy posted a link to lj in 2011 . 
  is that an ex post facto law or what ?
