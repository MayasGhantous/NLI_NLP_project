  dammit . 
  the same way in here . 
  i wish it would be possible to buy only cheap products . 
  ( un ) fortunately for the russians , the time of self-reliance is long gone . 
  i guess only a tiny minority regarded the annexation of crimea as a direct aggression against ukraine . 
  like it or not . 
  is it a euro on the tip ? 
  can i look at it more closely ? 
  when riding a bike , you have to choose between the right lane and a sidewalk , given that bike lanes that do exist are mostly in the parks . 
  for me , sideways look a lot less dangerous than motorways , haha . 
  nothing to add . 
  thank you so much , that was unexpected to read in here , and a very nice thing for you to say . 
  no worries , i think i 've just sorted it out and i 'll ( hopefully ) have my bag of rusty nuts and bolts repaired before the weekend . 
  your point being ? 
  i 've written the word `` assembled '' for a reason . 
  lada is mostly domestically developed , i guess . 
  never thought too hard about that . 
  `` kitty '' has grown twice as big since then . 
  whoa , that 's rich . 
  i 'm struggling to recall a time when i spoke out on behalf of either ukraine or the us . 
  now i understand why i 'm receiving death threats in pm from time to time , haha . 
  well , i cook simple dishes most of the time , so i 'm not a kind of person who misses european delicious food . 
  anyway it was barely affordable even before the rouble plummeting against the euro . 
  just so you know , there are plenty of car models , aside from lada , are assembled domestically . 
  [ lada kalina ] ( http://www.lada-dealer.ru/ru/avtomobili/modelnyi-rjad/kalina2/hetchbek/ ) is also not * that * bad for its price . 
  ugly , but cheap . 
  what is good for an economy is not always good for a commoner . 
  honestly , i believe it 's the other way around . 
  yep , there have always been a lot of jokes mocking the re-export of shrimps `` caught by a strong fishing fleet in the belorussian sea '' . 
  it 's much easier to find parts for popular models , like golf 4 or 10-15-yrs old bmw320 - i believe that any day , those can be built as a whole from used parts . 
  the distances are small while i 'm stuck at home doing nothing . 
  moscow is not really comfy if you do n't have a car . 
  it 's sad , imo . 
  as far i know , the modern industrial sector is overwhelmingly dependent on imports from the eu , namely machine tools , assembling conveyors etc. 
  nope , swedish . 
  but it 's such a good car !, 
  not to mention it has the most comfortable driver seat my ass ever sat on . 
  retailers have sorted out their problems with imports from the eu . 
  now they 're importing banned food from other places . 
  the price level , on the other hand , leaves a lot to be desired . 
  if only i had a bmw !, 
  it would be easier to find a needed part , stolen locally or imported from the non-eu countries . 
  since i ca n't drive anymore , i switched to walking . 
  i walk a lot everyday and , finally , i 'm inch away from getting back to morning jogging !, 
  there have been shortages of certain food items ( nothing crucial though ) occurring for a while , but the situation has drastically improved at some point . 
  so , now it 's fine . 
  the biggest issue is the cheap rouble . 
  damn , buying something from europe , it feels like a kick in stomach . 
  for instance , piss poor punks like me who drive an old european car are fucked up - car parts are too expensive . 
  when a throttle body ( that must be replaced in my case ) costs about 30k rub , repairing a car does n't make sense anymore . 
  i mean , the car as a whole is dirt cheap anyway . 
  dunno , i decided to stop giving a damn and concentrate on what is positive about it . 
  summarizing it all : khrushchev just followed us from the grave . 
  that was some wild guess . 
  here 's [ a map of the ottoman empire ca 1700 ] ( http://www.euratlas.net/history/europe/1700/entity_6084.jpg ) . 
  southern ukraine as well as crimea were conquered from the turks and annexed into the russian empire . 
  before that , ukrainians would have settled there merely as slaves . 
  since the beginning of colonization , they 've been settled there mostly as serfs of the the russian nobility . 
  according to [ the 1897 census ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_crimea#ethnicities_.26_languages ) , ethnic ukrainians made up 11.84 % of the population of the peninsula . 
  so , the ethnic breakdown you suggested would have most likely never happened . 
  maybe somewhere , in a parallel universe , where winged hussars have freed the ukrainian land , hehe . 
   local population was subject to oppression in defence of the tsarist russia : considering what the crimean tatars * were * before , i think they were treated surprisingly well . 
  you 're right and wrong in the same time . 
  stalin indeed deported the crimean tatars in 1944 . 
  but russians had made 49.6 % of the population * before * the wartime deportations were started , according to the 1939 census . 
  [ link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_crimea#ethnicities_.26_languages ) . 
  you ca n't take back what you never had . 
  who , ossetians ? 
  they did . 
   the human rights watch concluded that the `` south ossetian forces sought to ethnically cleanse '' the georgian-populated areas . 
   false flag attack according to whom , litvinenko ? 
  sorry , i ca n't take the words of a flipped ex-kgb officer at face value . 
  even though it were true , it would n't change a whole lot . 
   most of these were killed by russian special forces not by the terrorists . 
  sf had no other choice than to storm the building , as in many other cases . 
  the fact that they got fucked up ca n't excuse the terrorists . 
  the jihadists were the first and foremost reason why the hostages died . 
  period . 
  if you want nitpicking , here are a few other links for you : [ kizlyar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kizlyar-pervomayskoye_hostage_crisis ) , [ beslan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beslan_school_siege ) , [ budyonnovsk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budyonnovsk_hospital_hostage_crisis ) . 
  i posted [ a link to the whole list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_battles_and_other_violent_events_by_death_toll#terrorist_attacks ) earlier , it can be sorted by country . 
  what a load of crap .

  there have been plenty of [ other tragedies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_battles_and_other_violent_events_by_death_toll#terrorist_attacks ) . 
  how about no ? 
  maybe it 's up to the the western countries to fix the middle east which they have broken ? 
  maybe murica ^ tm should get her shit together and hold in check her bitches , namely the saudis and qatar ? 
  except russians in narva are far better off than russians in ivangorod , therefore no one is going to riot in the first place . 
  the world is saved . 
  see my answer to radene below . 
  while i 'm all for the decriminalization of homosexuality , shoving one 's values down other 's throats should not be the way to make it happen . 
  i mean , polygamy is not a crime per se , unless it 's a forced marriage . 
  it happens in the western countries as well . 
  perhaps , they ask for more than they expect to get ? 
  i take for granted that there are plenty of the brown shirt groups supporting the regime wholeheartedly . 
  i 'm also well aware of the present political alignment of a vast majority of my fellow countrymen . 
  that 's not the point . 
  however , a thing that i would like to highlight here , is that i 'm honestly yet to see a notable public event , held in support for the regime , which was * not * organized by the said regime . 
  in social media , there have been numerous evidences of the direct funding of so-called `` professional protesters '' . 
  officials paid them a little money though , about $ 5-7 paid to each person , but it was * money * nonetheless . 
  it looks kinda strange for me .
