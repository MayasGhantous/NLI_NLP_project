  if the alleged public support were so huge as it 's being presented by media , then why on earth would they have to pay for taking part in rallies ? 
  i mean , after the killing of nemstov , it took a day ( or two ? ), 
  for activists to get about 50k of people to the streets . 
  one day i was reading the news feed and and on the next day i was standing at the starting point of the mourning rally . 
  hell , i did n't even recognize the names of those activists , nor did i care about it . 
  the only thing that mattered was the message of the rally . 
  needless to say , i did n't spot anyone who handed out money to us . 
  on a side note , it would be great if it was n't like that : i was * literally * smashed by the hangover , haha . 
  most vocal supporters of the regime are getting paid for it . 
  so , any minute now ? 
  it calms me down / s, 
  here follows a gem from [ the original report ] ( http://www.cepa.org//sites/default/files/styles/medium/baltic%20sea%20security%20report-%20%282%29.compressed.pdf ) :  8 ) offensive military capabilities can be better coordinated too . 
  america has allowed finland and poland to buy the agm-158 jassm ( joint air-to-surface standoff missile ) , a stealth airlaunched weapon that has the capability to strike hundreds of kilometers inside russia . 
  this has a powerful deterrent effect . 
  translation for dummies : `` yes , we 're deploying missiles , that can not be intercepted , aimed at moscow , a city of 12 millions and the 6th largest city in the world . 
  you ruskies have nothing to worry about . '', 
  considering the accuracy of the defensive nato bombings of the residential neighbourhoods of belgrade , methinks i better be living somewhere beyond the ural mountains , just in case of a sudden reveal of the massive human rights violations in russia or something else like that , haha . 
  not for long , if they are not covered by the regime . 
  oh , come on !, 
  since then , russians have gradually turned into cynical , undisciplined , greedy buggers . 
  good luck with building a new north korea on this sand . 
  the stalin 's ussr , despite being ruled by assholes , had the idea , ideology if you want , that bonded people together . 
  it 's gone by now . 
  do n't be so bloodthirsty . 
  no one wants a civil war , it would be a complete disaster for the entire planet , in the worst case . 
  military wise , all these muslim battalions have a little support outside the caucasus . 
  what could he do here , short of pissing off the local population ? 
  next to nothing . 
  you did n't get me . 
  a radical muslim can not sit on the throne , it 's a big no-no for almost everyone here , including many muslims from other regions of the country . 
  stalin is irrelevant to the topic , the country has changed a lot since those times , also he was n't of a widely hated ethnicity . 
  and , as a chechen , he wo n't be accepted by the army , the recent wars are not forgotten . 
  in the end of a day , people have a say . 
  here you go : [ foreign fighters in iraq and syria | radio free europe ] ( http://www.rferl.org/contentinfographics/foreign-fighters-syria-iraq-is-isis-isil-infographic/26584940.html ), 
  does n't matter . 
  your average russian commoner is way too xenophobic to accept a token chechen . 
  and the army will never agree with it - it 's a spit in the face . 
  he 's got two major problems : his ethnicity and religion . 
  even afro-american has a better chance of winning the race in the rufed . 
  he is a typical warlord , thirsty for money and the power . 
  acting reasonably is not the strength of people like that . 
  his direct subordinates were detained for the killing committed in 100 meters away from the kremlin . 
  not really a good sign , if you ask me . 
  i thought that heavy drinking was not allowed during ramadan . 
  look what it 's done to you !, 
  if he continues to stay loyal . 
   learning english will also be much easier i suppose . 
  learning at least one foreign language ( en/fr/de ) is mandatory in schools ( i assume it 's the same in ukraine ) . 
  it teaches everyone to be able to read latin script . 
  sadly , it does n't seem to help much with overall language proficiency . 
  it reads like a text written in slovio . 
  or polish . 
  i do n't know whether it was sarcasm or not . 
  there was a travel agency in moscow that offered 4-day tours to the war zone . 
  i guess it should be quite easy to go all the way to donbass from russia . 
  in case you have a russian passport , of course . 
  zhirinovsky 's got ta be himself . 
  i do n't know who the other guys are , to be honest . 
  it 's true , of course . 
  however , it 's not * that * hard to get legal registration . 
  people often save them time by paying bribes . 
  it 's sort of part of the goddamn culture . 
  they could withdraw from e ukraine , simply flushing the rebels down the lavatory . 
  the problem is , they ca n't leave crimea . 
  it would be an instant suicide for any government . 
  oh , come on . 
  as if all these migrants in moscow were registered in a proper way or they give a damn about it . 
  things are fubar atm . 
  the sole purpose of these laws is to make the bottom-tier cops feed themselves . 
  perhaps , muslims should stop getting offended so easily . 
  except there 's one letter with an umlaut in russian : ** \u0401\u0451 ** , pronounced as `` yo '' . 
  though a little obsolete one . 
  the diaspora eats the same propaganda . 
  the only difference is that they have access to the alternative point of view , they just willingly choose not to listen to anything but rt. 
  most russians likely believe that all those guys in donbass are defending their land or sth along the lines . 
  i mean , that 's how the war is being portrayed in the mainstream media . 
  propaganda has won over the common sense . 
  they have azeris at their throats . 
  so the choice is being pro-russian or die . 
  amster, 
  [ igor plotnitsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/igor_plotnitsky )  born 26 june 1964 either in luhansk or in the town of kelmentsi , chernivtsi oblast . 
  rank | country | population | % of jewry -- | -- | -- | -- 6 | russia | 186,000 | 1.3 % 11 | ukraine | 63,000 | 0.4 % [ via ] ( https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaism/jewpop.html ), 
  sounds plausible , if you ask me . 
  bubbling with gas ? 
  whenever things go south the blame always lands on da joos . 
  i 'm going to wait until the price of a small island has matched the price of my apartments . 
  i 'm sure that many readers of this sub took to the streets yesterday . 
  eagerly awaiting for pictures !, 
  i 'm not arguing that the sanctions are justified or not - they are . 
  but i 'm not an idiot to rejoice for the west who is out to get me . 
  it will be turning into huge swamps , so no , the global warming wo n't really help here . 
  last year , when i started studying english , i was thinking of articles as follows : 1 ) `` a '' is short for `` one '' ; 2 ) `` the '' is short for `` this '' . 
  that helped me a lot . 
  to be fair , 2/3 is permafrost , it does n't count as `` soil '' . 
  the rest is not much better , except for the chernozem areas in the south-western part of the country . 
  tl ; dr : it 's fucking cold here . 
  you know me through and through !, 
  because they have no say , as it goes in every dictatorship ? 
  basically , the war was started by a small group of high-ranked officials . 
  i recall the interview of pm medvedev ( iirc ) where he said that he had n't seen it coming , in regard of the sudden annexation of crimea .
