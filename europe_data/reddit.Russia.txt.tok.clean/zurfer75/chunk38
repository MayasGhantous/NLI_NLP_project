  why the hell does the entire nation feel responsible for actions of a few ? 
  frankly , ca n't think of anything in particular . 
  i do n't allow whatever comes in my way to flow through me . 
  it 's becoming sort of a trend , is n't it ? 
  do n't fall off your high horse . 
  do n't be a menace to kremlin while drinking your hoegaarden in the hood . 
  happy cake day , o ' sarcastic one !, 
  rip zhanna ... * sighs * i need something to drink . 
  if anyone gets offended by this , they should seek mental help . 
   barbarians that 's rich . 
  yet i see [ barbarians ^ nsfw ] ( http://novorus.info/uploads/posts/2015-05/1432569385_1432384301_screenshot_10.png ) on both sides . 
  it 's just a professional disease , to see these things in a glance . 
  the perspective angle of the letters does n't match the rest of the picture ; the letters are in shades of gray when the tank has a blue ambient color ; wrong amount of blur ; wrong lightmap ... ffs , why i keep making excuses . 
  no one goddamn care either . 
  it was n't my point that no one paints some aggressive shit on their tanks . 
  they do . 
  heck , there 's a couple of cringe worthy cars ( slapped all over with `` patriotic '' stickers , such as '' \u041d\u0430 \u0411\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0438\u043d !, 
  '' , `` t-34 '' etc ) parked around my neighborhood . 
  tl ; dr : the picture you found looked a bit too fake to use it as example . 
  these images are not doctored . 
  the unexpected personal attacks are on your conscience . 
  yeah but the picture you linked is photoshopped . 
  apples and oranges . 
  neither is justified but the reasons for that are completely different . 
  the import tax for cars is still in effect and it 's way too high : / that said , a lot of european-designed cars are manufactured locally , for the domestic market . 
  so , the overall situation is bad albeit not terrible . 
  `` gazel '' accounts for nearly half of all light commercial vehicles sold in russia . 
   [ ** key party ** ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=key+party ), 
  where do you think the cheaper gas will be supplied from ? 
  or you were referring to the planned energy union and lower prices due to it ? 
  two ? 
   are you for real ? 
  yes , i am . 
  dude , i 'm living less in 10kms away from the kremlin . 
  in case of a war between the west and russia my personal fate is pretty much known . 
  i doubt you 're in the position of accusing me of trivializing anything related to the topic . 
  there is still no reason for a personal attack . 
  my point is that the ambassador said nothing of what the headline suggests . 
  soldiers are not supposed to kill civilians . 
  had n't seen it coming . 
  i tho you were a decent guy . 
  i 'd gladly give you an answer if only i were a minister of defence or another shit like this . 
  i 've only pointed out that the headline is total horseshit . 
  considering the behavior of our political elite , they probably see the entire planet as a military target :d so what ? 
  let the bullshit flow through this subreddit ? 
  there 's nothing in the words of tatarintsev to suggest that sweden is likely to face an * instant * military action even though it 's going to join nato . 
  here 's what he said :  but if it happens there will be counter measures . 
  putin pointed out that there will be consequences , that russia will have to resort to a response of the military kind and ** re-orientate our troops and missiles ** . 
  if a country joins the ** military ** alliance , which sole purpose is to deter russia , it will be viewed as a legitimate target of the russian military . 
  now substitute the word `` russia '' with any other country 's name and read the sentence again . 
  i do n't think that those who shot an old granny and her daughter in their own house should be described as `` idiots '' . 
  there must be other name for that . 
  i do n't get what all the fuss is about . 
  both countries have a treaty that allows them to have around 500 missiles ready to fly . 
  so , russia puts the new stuff in place of the old junk . 
  renewing this dangerous shit is a necessary thing to do . 
  no , of course , and i never implied that . 
  the problem is there are next to none trusted sources . 
   lulz lulz . 
  yeltsin destroyed a parliamentary republic in russia and made it a presidential republic instead , that paved the way for the future usurper . 
  i bet many russians and ukrainians are laughing their asses off as we speak .

  one of the mps : [ yevgeny fyodorov ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/yevgeny_alexeyevich_fyodorov ) . 
  edit : state duma has no legitimacy over the soviet government bodies . 
  something something yeltzin , 1993 , shelling of the parliament building . 
  replied to a commenter above . 
  i was referring to the leaked plans of invasion from the northern direction . 
  i assume it 's being widely discussed on the net . 
  if the documents , that have been leaked today , are not fake , then all these journalist 's investigations have no meaning anymore . 
  nah , feelings matter everywhere . 
  well , it was a long read . 
  as if running out of money was a sole reason behind the fall of the ussr . 
  also , something something about people in glass houses who should n't throw stones . 
  dammit , i was hoping that having a big nose would be a good cause to apply , hehe . 
  how are they going to verify jewish ancestry of applicants ? 
  i feel like it 's time to learn a couple words in hebrew ... 
  dude , it 's not about a random house somewhere . 
  go for it, 
  because he 's playing a role of the biggest cheese in the town . 
  a couple of guys does n't count . 
  a whole of french riviera , miami , london belong to putin 's cronies . 
  hot air . 
  wake me up when they start seizing assets and blocking bank accounts of our corrupted officials . 
   besides russia \\* sighs \\*, 
  falling into a crisis having the int ' l financial system behind vs falling into a crisis alone , having crimea & donbass as a burden . 
  something is seriously wrong with that logic . 
  btw , the ` inspiring example ' also leaves a lot to be desired . 
  however , it 's hard to tell whether this is the result of the war or not . 
  the country 's currency reserves = / = the sovereign wealth fund . 
  i would n't describe it as ` tinfoilery ' . 
  plans of `` re-integration '' of the former russian land have been floating around since the fall of the soviets . 
  i mean , there have been a lot of butthurt about crimea among marginal `` think-tanks '' . 
  what really amuses me about the situation is that those marginals got control over the country 's leader . 
  i can only take his words at face value . 
  i 'm almost sure it was belkovsky who said that . 
  sorry , i 'm not going to go through a gazillion hours of the video to prove it . 
  i barely can stand him talking , to be honest . 
  realistically speaking , ukraine had a chance of joining nato once in a blue moon . 
  incompatible weaponry , wide-spread corruption , a quite low level of training , the low public support of the membership in the alliance - many problems that would n't be solved quickly . 
  funny enough , now ukraine has better chances .
