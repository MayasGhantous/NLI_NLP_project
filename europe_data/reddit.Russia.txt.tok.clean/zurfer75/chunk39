  surname ` smirnov ' derived from the non-christian given name ` smirnoy ' which denotes a quiet and docile * child * , as opposed to a spoiled little brat . 
  being quiet was a notable character trait in the rural russia , where entire families had to live together , in one house . 
  just because you 're paranoid , it does n't mean they 're not out to get you . 
  someone ( belkovsky ? ), 
  once said that the dearest leader took the death of gaddafi with all seriousness . 
  he had been watching the video of the lynching again and again , for a long time . 
  quite sick stuff . 
  * there 's a lot of difference between listening and hearing . 
  * - g.k.chesterton . 
  he was re-elected into office before the euromaidan . 
  his grip on power had tightened before the euromaidan . 
  all that he got for the annexation of crimea was the surge in his approval rating . 
  was it worth it ? 
  it 's a normal practice , unless the inner circle is turned into echo chamber of his mind . 
  agreed . 
  this version makes much more sense . 
  i 'm goddamn sure he did n't . 
  he admitted to not using the internet . 
  the president is supposed to listen to daily reports provided by the press service . 
  or another ... hmmm ... service . 
   [ 2 ] putin 's desire to stay in power . 
  he had all means to stay in power as long as he pleases . 
  the next elections are in 2018 . 
  he is not worried about having voters in his pocket , as long as he has the electoral commission and parliament under the thumb instead . 
  the opposition is chased under the bed . 
  i mean , wtf ? 
  \\  implying that he ever had a chance for listening to this song . 
   the country is in such deep hole , that without external enemies and expansion it would get eaten from the inside by its own issues . 
  before the ukrainian shenanigans , russia was in a better shape than ever . 
  there must be another reason for him doing what he did . 
  suppression of national culture ? 
  facing a backlash as a result ? 
  that 's something unheard of / s, 
  hmm , apparently it is , just came to mind . 
  a peace that can be broken by a man with a handgun is not worth a bloody dime . 
  man , it 's inevitable . 
  they have to either tighten the grip on the people or risk the country falling apart . 
  i only hope that the eu will whip the gov ' t ass in case they go too far . 
  i do n't think this government is inherently bad . 
  just as populistic as many before them . 
  sanctions may be lifted once crimea is handed back to ukraine . 
  this is not gon na happen unless the rufed , as we know it today , is dismantled completely . 
  in that case , the western sanctions will be the last thing to bother about . 
  not only in russia , though . 
  this negative attitude has been around for a long time and expecting that it may be changed overnight is unrealistic , to say the least . 
  what i disagree with is that op omitted the word ` statutory ' . 
  op should have clarified that then and made it more clear . 
  i mean , as far as i understand , those are * different * crimes in the us penal code . 
  do you mean that having consensual sex with an underage girl is a rape nonetheless ? 
  a quote from the wiki article :  as a result of the plea bargain , polanski pleaded guilty to the charge of `` unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor , '' [ 114 ] [ 115 ] and was ordered to undergo 90 days of psychiatric evaluation at california institution for men at chino . 
  [ 116 ] therefore , he 's never been convicted for a * rape * . 
  never thought of reading the article before posting , op ? 
  would be nice though . 
  that said , the money saved will most likely be spent on the ongoing rearmament programme . 
  therefore , it wo n't make any difference for the common people . 
  your point being ? 
  despite being a neighboring country , estonia still draws less attention than latvia , lithuania or finland , to name a few . 
  that contradicts with your initial statement . 
  case closed . 
  congrats , you 've just come up with a new unit of measurement . 
  not so funny as micro-hitlers though . 
  try ' \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430 ' or ' \u041b\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f ' , estonia will get less hits anyway . 
  population size is not so relevant in that regard . 
  with ten times the population , china makes less headlines than russia does . 
  wtf is the method ? 
  rg.ru , seriously ?

  no need to make up numbers . 
  estonia is barely even mentioned in the rufed media . 
   why russia has such a problem with estonia are you sure what they * have * the problem ? 
  the illarionov 's opinion should be taken with a pinch of salt . 
  why should they do that ? 
  there 's nothing wrong with the chip . 
  above all , meduza is a niche product ; there are plenty other websites spreading the good news about the motherland . 
  although they may be too loud sometimes , i have a favorable view of the armenian people . 
  ca n't explain why , perhaps , they are simply awesome , haha , and their cuisine is delicious . 
  no , it 's just kzakhar is not worth engaging in a serious conversation . 
  xe 's just repeating the same thing in different ways . 
  the most explosive tensions seem to occur between the slavic population and muslims from north caucasus or the former soviet republics . 
  kazakhs and tatars are fine , though . 
  armenians are my personal favorites from all of the foreign nationals , haha . 
  actually , it 's impossible to single out a certain ethnicity that is hated by everybody here . 
  at ease , private !, 
  zombie stalin did it . 
  color me surprised . 
  right sector openly made threats to beat the shit out of the lgbt activists . 
  sports ( football / hockey ) 2 . 
  complaining about everything : - bad roads ( when in car ) - where to find lowest prices ( when shopping ) - healthcare ( do n't even get me started ) - whatever else 3 . 
  recently added topics : america is out to get us / ukrainian fascists are eating babies, 
  1 ) the level of abstraction usually decreases from left to right , i.e. , megacategory -  category -  subcategory -  item . 
  i mean , placing the category 's color brick to the right of the title is weird , to say the least . 
  2 ) too much empty space between titles and categories . 
  i mean , our eyes can not move straight from side to side without little santa helpers . 
  that 's why we use horizontal and vertical lines in tables etc. 
  the existing lines are too pale to follow . 
  i had to struggle every time trying to catch a link between the title and the respective color brick . 
  edit : last but not least . 
  the colors of rectangles would be much less saturated . 
  after all , it 's / r/europe , not a website made for kim kardashian . 
  now you feel my pain on this subreddit !,
