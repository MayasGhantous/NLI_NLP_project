  i thought she 's an activist . 
  not so long ago , she was whining about a little boy who was raped being `` dressed like putin '' somewhere in scandinavia . 
  i 'll provide a link if i find it . 
  i 'd describe it as a crooked implementation of the third rome . 
  this is what you get when a misconception plays a role of a basis of the country . 
  recently , i saw the results of another poll . 
  more than a half answered they do n't care about ruble weakening because they have neither rubles nor dollars . 
  i find the whole picture quite hopeless . 
  the majority : - have no savings at all - owe expensive loans to private banks - have never been abroad , have n't got a required passport - ca n't speak a foreign language - use tv as a prime source of information dae believes in liberal democracy in russia ? 
  it 's another problem . 
  the beliefs of siege mentality play an important role in russian national mindset . 
  and also our reptilian overlords and crab people . 
  i tho my sarcasm was pretty obvious . 
  the current regime in moscow was installed with the advice and consent of the western masters . ^ 1 putin and his cronies are under control of the west . ^ 2 kremlin 's behavior have been directly playing into uncle sam 's hands for the last years . ^ 3 since the regime has been aiming to the total defeat of russia , only true patriots can stand against the kremlin traitors . ^ 4 ^ 1 the odds are 100 to 1 ; ^ 2 true , the west keeps their money and families ; ^ 3 true , regardless of reasons ; ^ 4 a popular point of view among russian nationalists . 
  orcs are orcs . 
  i disagree that anecdotal evidence is worthless but opinion polls make it easier to get the whole picture even though the results look controversial or contradict to personal experience . 
  sincerely , capt. 
  obvious . 
  you can find either pro-regime or anti-regime guys everywhere . 
  this fact of itself proves nothing . 
  also , * `` it is dangerous to be right when the government is wrong . 
  dragging the name ikea into political fight is worse than kicking a cat .

  you just ca n't wait to the ongoing war , can you ? 
  give it time . 
  vast majority of russians have n't never read any of the western media outlets . 
  approval rating of putin is on the decline . 
  i 'm glad for you . 
  the source of your hatred remains beyond my comprehension . 
  i do n't blame you . 
  i hate myself too . 
  if i had a dollar for every time i read about `` hurr durr evil russians oppress poor chechens '' i 'd buy a pair of winter tires . 
  what does the bible say , `` do n't gloat when your enemy falls '' , right ? 
  thou shalt love thy new neighbour , denmark . 
  forget what i said , i feel really sorry for europe in this case . 
  no one deserves chechens . 
  * sigh *, 
   run over to ~ ~ russia ~ ~ eastern siberia ( far east ) look at the map , for starters . 
  locals reported in the net that they have plenty of best koreans over there . 
  they have been coming over the border for smuggling and illegal logging . 
  dude , i was born in the ussr . 
  before the soviets ' fall i had been obliged to provide actual political information ( ' \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f ' ) in my class once per week . 
  i had been a master in the dark art of propaganda and demagogy even when i was a kid . 
  i 'm ready to pay lip service to praise glorious leader with passion !, 
   dmitry ** rogozin ** , a senior russian defence official , ** tweeted ** earlier ... lol , op . 
  given a chance i 'd like to visit best korea . 
  one time , my sick obsession with asian girls will get me into trouble , i feel it , haha . 
   it 's in almetyevsk , the capital of the republic of tatarstan , russian federation . 
  it 's not the capital but a medium sized town , 150k inhabitants . 
  [ kazan ' ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/kazan ) is the capital . 
  who knows ? 
  i have n't found a story related to the photo . 
  i can only guess , by that time chechens have already finished russians in grozny off . 
  i did n't say anything about story makers from russian tv . 
  hmm . 
  they have an autonomy but it only exists on paper . 
  granted , russian 's legal system is not so bad as it may seem but it fails when it comes to reality because of total corruption , tons of small amendments , direct orders from the top etc. 
   the image was snapped by photographer alexander nemenov on march 31 , 1995 , at an ** orthodox cemetery ** in chechnya 's capital , grozny , according to the afp photo archive . 
  the bodies were those of civilians `` killed in winter fighting '' that were `` exhumed for identification , '' according to afp . 
  apologies for breaking circlejerk . 
  chechens could n't bury their dead at the christian cemetery . 
  apparently , there were dead bodies of russian civilians . 
  your information is revisionist history . 
  how so ? 
  you linked wiki and i did the same . 
  you 're barking at the wrong tree . 
  honestly , i 'm not interested in motives of participants those committed war crimes during ww2 . 
  both my granddads returned to moscow in 42-43 , hence they 've never been to europe and were unable to rape anyone there . 
  hope you 'll find someone else who cares about ww2 enough to continue discussing . 
  what the heck are you talking about ? 
  firstly you brought up ww2 as an example of russian weakness at war , for now you 're talking about mass rapes as an evidence of what ? 
  get your shit together . 
  also , there were no saints on either side . 
  [ wiki : war crimes of the wehrmacht ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_crimes_of_the_wehrmacht#mass_rapes ) . 
   estimates regarding the rape of soviet women by the wehrmacht reached up to 10,000,000 cases , with between 750,000 and 1,000,000 children born as a result . 
  [ 73 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] so , german nazis were 5 times more rapey than soviets , amirite ? 
  another link to [ askhistorians ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/1cpgy5/i_hear_a_lot_about_rape_from_the_red_army_in/ ) . 
  if you 're bringing up wwii you may also find it helpful to check out its results . 
  also , what crisis , mate ? 
  tho population constantly [ grows ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_russia ) since 2009 . 
  i 've no idea about the rest of russia but there 's a baby boom in moscow last years . 
  damned kids are everywhere . 
  i 'm totally happy that number of us military losses so low . 
  bombing enemy cities full of civilians to dust makes good sense in terms of k/d rate . 
  these tactics were also used by russian army in grozny , it worked very well . 
  i 'm sure such methods should be widely used in the future conflicts . 
  the vast majority of so-called russian trolls lives in the us/eu . 
  perhaps , you should ask them directly . 
  i do n't consider them to be `` true '' russians anymore , they 've left the country . 
  also , `` levels of hatred '' towards russians were always high , especially among idiots . 
  as a russia 's citizen i do not care much about that , coz westerners `` en masse '' are too sissy to be afraid of them . 
  perhaps , i was n't clear . 
  i meant , that documentary implied that the ussr was spending * petrodollars * for buying goods for gdr , when in moscow shops any western-made goods were extremely rare . 
  where did you get a photo of my local shop in 80s ? 
  although it was possible to buy anything ... for a double price in the back yard . 
  the headline suggests that siberia is ready to secede . 
  it 's not true . 
  the point is that they want more money from the federal budget .
