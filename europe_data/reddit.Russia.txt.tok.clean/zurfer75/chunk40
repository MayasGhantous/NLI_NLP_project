  i 'm fairly sure there are many chechens who are nice people . 
  maybe , they live somewhere else , dunno , in france or sweden . 
  sadly , but in 40 years of living in moscow i 've yet to meet one of them who was not a criminal of some sort . 
  that 's how prejudice is learned . 
  / thread trigger warning : do not read below the line !, 
  the comments here are cancer !, 
  fair enough , vice is notorious for sensational headlines albeit having good journalists . 
  it 's in their style . 
  * `` the story how i became literally hitler '' *, 
  i hereby admit having committed the act of cultural appropriation : i just had a sandwich with salo for a snack . 
  chechen diaspora is the first thing that comes to mind . 
  these training centers , so-called [ `` military-patriotic clubs '' ] ( https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%92%d0%be%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%bd%d0%be-%d0%bf%d0%b0%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b8%d0%be%d1%82%d0%b8%d1%87%d0%b5%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%b9_%d0%ba%d0%bb%d1%83%d0%b1 ) , have been around since the 1980s . 
  when the war in afganistan began , it turned out that the pre-conscription military training taught in schools left a lot to be desired . 
  i think that every town in russia has at least one centre like that , they 're quite popular . 
  not sure if it should be called as ` training of child soldiers ' : by that logic , every soviet guy was a ` child soldier ' once , on account of the fact that military training classes was mandatory in schools . 
  for instance , in my school , there was an optional course on paratroopers fighting . 
  the course was taught by a sadistic afganistan veteran . 
  punching someone in the balls was the favorite exercise of that guy ; he was saying something like `` your body should better learn how to pull testicles up into the abdomen , when in danger ! '', 
  it depends , actually . 
  in my neighbourhood , the ethnic divide would be like 50/50 ( slavs/non-slavs ) . 
  now i 'm claiming my oppression points !, 
  interesting , thank you !, 
  oh , please !, 
  you 're making me blush . 
  in addition to my * qualifications * , i also have a pretty grim sense of humor . 
  it 'll all be fine . 
  agreed . 
  `` do n't piss into the wind '' is a motto for life in russia . 
  as for approval ratings , i do n't think it 's a conspiracy . 
  i guess it may be a normal concern about sharing one 's thoughts . 
  pollsters often conduct phone surveys using landlines - what kind of anonymity is this ? 
  i 'd give people the benefit of the doubt . 
   washington ( ap ) -- the obama administration is weighing a range of aggressive responses to russia 's ** alleged ** violation of a cold war-era nuclear treaty , including deploying land-based missiles in europe that could pre-emptively destroy the russian weapons . 
  editorializing is bad , amirite ? 
  / s well done , op . 
  i hope it will be easier to flee the country as a refugee , when a war breaks out . 
  sadly , yes . 
  sorry , it seems that i misunderstood your comment . 
  i have a very low opinion of my compatriots , so i 'm not the best person to ask about it . 
  that 's not a mother they want to see again . 
  [ why bosnia has the world 's highest youth unemployment rate ] ( http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/141008/bosnia-youth-unemployment-rate ) . 
  do you really need anyone from the outside ? 
  in given circumstances , the liberal dissent has had nothing to offer to an average russian but empty words . 
  it 's not like 1990-91 , when people were fed up with the soviets . 
  it 's more like 1914 , when the emperor was greeted by the cheering crowd . 
  if someone is going to sacrifice their life for nothing , it 's as brave as it is stupid nonetheless . 
  leaving is a logical decision on their part . 
  fighting against the collective hive mind is futile ; you either shut your mouth or they will shut it for you . 
  to date i 've heard about one case , when an online shop owner was questioned by the police after they conducted a controlled buy . 
  it 's in a grey zone , like having a shop without a till . 
  no , it is n't . 
  they just have no ideas on how to deal with it . 
  does eu countries have to vote unanimously to keep sanctions in place or to impose new ones ? 
  someone should have told the photographer that oversharpened photos are so ' 00s . 
  looks nice , though . 
  i 'm half joking , ofc , but poroshenko should have taken the loaf . 
  it would make the imperial regalia of ukraine of something along the lines . 
  ... aaaand it 's gone : [ theft of ukraine 's ` golden loaf ' reflects the revolution 's failings ] ( http://time.com/3748769/ukraine-revolution-golden-loaf-theft/ ) . 
  yep , because 86 % of approval rating is not enough for putin , he needs 100 % , 
  must be true , if he said so . 
  kudrin is the best finance minister ever . 
  come on , man , i 'm not blaming the common folk . 
  it would be rather stupid , considering the circumstances . 
  i just want to say that even though the overall situation is going to change for the better , the possible recovery of the country will be extremely painful for everyone involved . 
  calm down a bit , if it 's possible . 
  i 'm not convinced that chechnya nowadays is north korea of some sort . 
  they can move freely . 
  tell me whatever you want , but a quarter ( !!! ), 
  of the country population taking to the streets to participate in the islamist rally is a bad , very bad sign . 
  see my [ answer to watergeuzen ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/38cnht/battle_rages_for_marinka_25_ukrainian_soldiers/crugawq ) . 
  first and foremost targets are small and medium importers/exporters , people working/studying/resting aborad , internet shops and shoppers et al. 
  you can try and google `` capital flight from russia '' , normally it can help you with understanding the basics . 
  the thing is that cutting off the swift is a measure aimed at your average russian in hope of inducing panic and , possibly , uprising . 
  many banks and state-owned companies have been efficiently blackballed from getting loans and credit on int ' l markets . 
  this is exactly the point of sanctions imposed by the eu/us . 
  this is exactly that is causing damage to the russian economy this time . 
  the swift has nothing to do with the things you mentioned , it 's a system which allows to make rapid cross-border transactions between different banks / traders . 
  how does it hurt top managers ? 
  they keep their money in western banks anyway . 
  it 's not a big deal to withdraw a few dollars even though the swift is down . 
  big money always finds a way . 
  this committe is a russian ngo . 
  [ as a share of total spending , half of what russians spend this year will go just to buying food . 
  ] ( http://qz.com/353868/this-year-cash-strapped-russians-will-spend-half-their-money-on-food-alone/ ) so , how many russians actually have any money to spend in other countries ? 
  any ideas ? 
   most chechens belong to the shafi'i school of sunni islam and there are significant others that follows mystical sufi tradition . 
  ok , i 'll take your word for it . 
  my point is , when i see all those women wearing black clothes and hijabs , that reminds me of nothing less than saudi arabia . 
  whom , exactly ? 
  a half of the population do n't have any savings . 
  for everything else there 's ~ ~ mastercard ~ ~ sberbank , which has its own processing network . 
  big business does n't give a damn about swift , there are alternative ways to make a transaction . 
  small exporters/importers and people who are working/traveling abroad are fucked up , for sure . 
  but the latter is the `` fifth column '' anyway , the less people communicating with the west , the better for the regime . 
  do n't sweat it , man . 
  `` kadyrovtsi '' is not an occupation force , sent from the outside to oppress poor chechens , but a significant part of the society brainwashed by wahhabi mullahs . 
  in the same way as the `` anti-maidan '' movement represents the most backward and jingoistic part of the russian nation brainwashed by the propaganda pouring from the tv screen . 
  while i 'm all for giving chechens the benefit of the doubt , lest we forget about the rally against `` je suis charlie '' that has drawn about a half a million protesters in grozny . 
  what if they love being tortured ? 
  the human rights are haram , just so you know .
