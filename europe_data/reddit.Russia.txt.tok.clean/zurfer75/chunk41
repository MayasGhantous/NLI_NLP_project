  about time . 
  g7 summit is to be held this weekend in germany . 
  thank you for clarifying that for me . 
  so , the campaign aimed at recruiting more mods ended with sacking of the mods , including old and new ones . 
  unfortunately , he probably is . 
  my guess is that his mother dragged him to the church instead of mental hospital because a priest is way more cheaper than a doctor . 
  is that how you homo-nazi-zombies look like in ukraine ? 
  i know jack shit about orthodoxy , so , no ideas . 
  but the guy should better make sure that his ribs were not broken in process . 
   i 'd try to kick the shit out of anyone spotted the possessed one !, 
  actually , i feel pity for him . 
  he did n't even swear much . 
  yelled for his mom to help him . 
  also , it was funny , how the guy accused the priest of being too fat and heavy : `` whaddaya eat ? 
  pork meat ? 
  '' , as if it was some delicious food . 
  the priest is saying : `` we are going to jerusalem !, 
  '' , `` toll the bells ! '', 
  the patient is complaining , whining and bitching . 
  he is certainly upset about the situation . 
  haha , a real case of exorcism . 
  orthodox church never seizes to amaze me . 
  edit : at 3:47 you can hear a voice of `` the demon '' saying ' \u0432\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0443 , \u0432\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0443 ' ( ` ok , ok , i 'm going out now ' ) . 
  holy crap , it 's ridiculous . 
  [ there you are ] ( http://glavpost.com/post/29may2015/worldpolitics/37891-alfred-koh-chem-nepreklonnee-ukraina-budet-v-voprose-kryma-tem-krovavee-budet-eta-voyna-na-donbasse.html ), 
  i 'm inclined to rely on the western point of view , unless it 's proven wrong . 
  once again , the things you mentioned are sad but none of them could justify the shelling of residential areas . 
  otherwise , the deliberate bombing of , say , grozny can also be justified . 
  which is bullshit . 
  nato bombing of belgrade drastically changed the attitude toward the west . 
  it was the first time since 91-93 , when i started seeing people in the street arguing about the politics . 
  are you sure you comprehend the meaning of ` sarcasm ' word ? 
  no , i was n't sarcastic , in case you did n't get it . 
  give it a time and you 'll see it . 
  it 's my assumption based on what alfred koch said in the recent interview . 
  yeah , because using words such as `` baguettes '' or `` bums '' in regard to the army of napoleon is a clear evidence of the serious attitude . 
  it 's amusing . 
  while others were busy nitpicking my comment ( pointing at the well-known fact that i was taught in a school ) , it is only / u/pwndbyautocorrect ( may his beard be white ! ), 
  who has given a substantive response . 
  but you went even further , drawing far-reaching conclusions about my personality and the national mindset . 
  whose mindset , do you think , has been revealed so far ? 
  the first and foremost purpose of building the city of st. petersburg was showing a middle finger to swedes , who lived across the sea . 
  it was the alpha and omega of its existence . 
  no one has ever regarded it as an actual capital . 
  as for moscow ... 
  it 's irrelevant who was the person responsible of setting the city on fire . 
  it was not that the mayor was jealous about the fame of emperor nero and did it for the lulz . 
  there must have been a reason and the reason was the army of napoleon . 
  ^ / s/s/s ^ at ^ your ^ option, 
  on a more serious note , i find the timing of this article quite interesting . 
  apparently , the west slowly comes to the realization that the dearest leader is not going to draw back . 
  at the same time , the western officials are clearly afraid of pushing too hard . 
  the devil we know is better than the devil we do n't ; no one really knows who may come after him . 
  hence the new narrative : `` the ruling elite is a lesser problem , it 's just russians are being fucktards , as they 've always been ! '', 
   it emerged 200 years ago , at the end of the napoleonic period , with the opening up of what we would today call a values gap . 
  this is some top logic right here . 
  when baguettes , leading the army of bums from all over the europe , come and burn our capital city , this is still our failure , because our values are not good enough for them , right ? 
  sometimes i think that cossacks should have burned paris to the ground in 1814 , just for shits and giggles , as a small gesture of our thanks . 
  if russians are guilty by nature , why not have some fun along the way ? 
  seems like zhirik is late to the party . 
  project `` novorossya '' has been [ ~ ~ frozen ~ ~ closed ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/522320.html ) recently . 
  i 've been to minsk and it felt like a sunday morning though it was a week day . 
  i think i got what you mean . 
  by the way , the public transit has significantly improved since the introduction of bus lanes and tightening of parking restrictions . 
  probably , the actual number is [ close to 17 millions ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/rbth/society/8555676/moscow-17-million-people.html ) . 
   i would n't want to live there . 
  i , on the contrary , feel the opposite . 
  as someone who has a family in a baltic country , i always knew they had a low opinion about russians . 
  on a side note , it is n't surprising me at all , knowing the history of these countries . 
  but as it turns out , the rest of europeans share this point of view and that means i had a skewed perception of the west for , like , all of my life . 
  anyway , it 's better late than never . 
  now i 'm glad that i got rid of idealistic illusions . 
  only a year ago , i was seriously considering moving westward and the newly gotten info has made me reconsider the plans . 
  apparently , no . 
  i think the authorities are displaying a kind of `` not on my watch '' attitude . 
  since neither unauthorized gatherings nor telling `` homosexuality is ok '' to minors are allowed , you do n't have many options left . 
   latynina you can not be seriously suggesting this . 
  that 's why i put that word in inverted commas . 
  hint : they both have never been provoked . 
  prejudice based on ethnicity is a glaring example of racism . 
  also , you ca n't quit being an ukrainian . 
  you 're confusing ethnicity with nationality . 
  `` my '' vacationers in e ukraine have nothing to do with the shelling of tskhinvali by the georgian armed forces in 2008 . 
  does n't matter where it 's coming from . 
  one wrong does not excuse another . 
   that 's a concept substitution , which the russians like so much . 
  by the way , you should be called out on racist remarks . 
  but oh , ok . after all , you 're just ukrainian / s i mean , come on . 
  back in 2008 , saakashvili was `` provoked '' in a similar way that putin was a year ago . 
  there are also some differences regarding the outcome : 1 ) saakashvili miscalculated the willingness of the nato allies to help him against russia and got his ass handed to him ; 2 ) putin underestimated the eagerness of his adversaries to sanction the shit out of the country and flushed the fattest decade in russian history down the toilet . 
  in hindsight , neither of them was right . 
  and , in conclusion . 
  granted , you can argue your ass off defending saakashvili , but shelling civilians is still bad , mmmkay ? 
  no matter how much you personally hate them bastards ; this is the very case when * the ends do n't justify the means * . 
  [ georgia ` started unjustified war ' | bbc news , 30 sep 2009 ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8281990.stm )  the war in georgia last year was started by a georgian attack that was not justified by international law , an eu-sponsored report has concluded . 
  yes , i do . 
  lucky me , huh . 
  seeing how activists were immediately beaten and arrested , it would be hard to expect any mass amount of people coming to the rally . 
  i ca n't shake the feeling that i 'm watching a real-time satirical show . 
  saakashvili governing odessa , it 's just plain weird .
