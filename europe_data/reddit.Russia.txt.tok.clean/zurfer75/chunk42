  it 's sort of like zhirinovsky serving as the mayor of damascus . 
  he surely can afford to hire a translator .

  umm , well , what about wearing a tie over a bare chest ? 
  that is terribly sexy .

  deepening the divide between russia and western countries plays directly into the hands of the ruling elite . 
  they do n't need * love * from the west , they want to keep the west away from the domestic audience . 
  odessites , hide your ties !, 
  you know , not everyone is buying into the propaganda that is coming out of rt. 
  despite their efforts , in case you did n't notice , the public sentiment toward russia is quickly turning negative . 
  what they need is to distract people from adherence to western values as much as possible . 
  mutual hatred and distrust always come in handy : the more negative emotions they cause in the western countries , the more success they will have in their approach . 
  honestly , i 'm starting to think that it 's good that a vast majority of my compatriots can not read in english . 
  my point is , they 've already won your `` heart and mind '' if the news like this makes you hate the country . 
  that means they 're winning the propaganda battle . 
  stirring up mutual hatred - that is what they 're aiming at . 
  history , boy . 
  there must be limits of a concept of ` while guilt '' when applied to europe . 
  not to mention that she , as a turk , should better shut up in regard to slavery in general .

  in some way , the 90s never ended in this corner of siberia . 
  irkutsk itself is not * so * bad though . 
  if you are a normal guy , you 'll be fine . 
  angarsk or usolye , on the other hand ...  i 'd prefer not to go there , but it 's just my opinion , ofc . 
  be sure to keep your eyes open out there . 
  obsession ? 
  you read too much into the gov ' t propaganda efforts . 
  20-somethings nowadays do n't know jack shit what the ww2 was about . 
  i hope not . 
  otherwise , humanity is doomed .

  i 'm struggling to sort out what is more entertaining : the statistics provided or discussion ensued here in the comments . 
  your point being ? 
  do you think the tsarist army would have been any better ? 
  probably , they would , but we 'll never know for sure .

  i 'm not a big fan of the regime , but , under the circumstances , it would be stupid to expect them sitting on their hands .

   `` it is reported from aisha that she said : the prophet entered into marriage with me when i was a girl of six ... and at the time [ of joining his household ] i was a girl of nine years of age . ''  `` khadija died three years before the prophet departed to medina . 
  he stayed [ alone ] for two years or so . 
  he ** married ** aisha when she was a girl of ** six ** years of age , and he ** consummated ** that marriage when she was ** nine ** years old . '' [ link ] ( http://www.muslim.org/islam/aisha-age.htm ) get your shit straight , kebab . 
  every autonomous republic has its own laws regarding marriage , age of consent etc. 
  chechnya follows sharia . 
  iirc , their prophet was a-ok with raping 9-yo , so i have to stress that her age was a minor obstacle on a way of loving hearts . 
  in that particular case , age of the bride was a lesser problem . 
  apparently , it was a forced marriage - that * is * what has sparked outrage . 
  [ daniil kharms ] ( http://www.sevaj.dk/kharms/kharmseng.htm ) has a word for you . 
  not that if russia as a country needs it but the regime does for sure . 
  there 's no reason to be sad . 
  far-right parties still have a long way to go before success in europe , when russia is quickly running out of money . 
  i wonder what northern country will get blamed in the end . 
  ps : a massacre is not a subject for jokes , of course . 
  my apologies , i just could not resist . 
   because they love his money .

  [ vladimir putin : the rebuilding of ` soviet ' russia ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26769481 ) . 
   vedomosti , a liberal russian newspaper generally sympathetic to ukrainian reformers , lamented the passage of the laws : `` the attempt ... to turn history into a handmaiden of ideology is removing ukraine from democratic values , bringing it troublingly close to contemporary russia . '' when tough times come , liberal values go out the window . 
  it 's true for either side .

  [ russian official severely beaten after reporting electoral fraud ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russian-official-severely-beaten-after-reporting-electoral-fraud/520147.html ), 
  just recently , one guy got beaten and his spleen removed because of doing this job . 
  man , i 'm aware that renaming of toponyms is not the end of the world . 
  but it costs money nonetheless ( even changing name boards for shops and replacing road signs would cost you dearly ) and i 've just pointed out that it 's not worth bothering with , when the country is balancing on the brink of bankruptcy . 
  that 's why i think it 's nothing but the populism . 
  do n't you think the name `` kantograd '' sounds a bit too ... odd ? 
  the main problem with koenigg is that it 's basically a huge military base , inhabited by people of a certain mindset . 
  if it was n't so , it would have been renamed a long ago . 
  like , for instance , leningrad was renamed back to saint-petersburg as early as 1991 . 
  i heard about some activists who vowed for restoring the original name but that 's it . 
  i do n't like it because it sends a wrong message , to both sides . 
  my guess is that estonian society was more eager to fix the issue . 
  but , okay , i 'll take your word for it . 
  i honestly doubt that german renamings were ever taken into account . 
  in the post-communist times , many streets and towns have regained their `` historical '' names . 
  iirc , stalin-something names were eliminated completely ( i do n't give my hand to cut off , though ) . 
  lenin streets are still everywhere . 
   it is not a big deal at all . 
  i assume you never tried to fathom the bureaucracy in the former soviet republics . 
  what makes you think that i 'm against it `` in principle '' ? 
  it 's their money after all .
