  by the way , i live in the city where a street was named after kadyrov , so hitler strasse does n't even seem * that * bad . 
  in case of renaming a city or a street ? 
  how could you avoid it ? 
  right . 
  also , they 're establishing the iron curtain 2.0 using a soft control . 
  considering that they 're building an imitation of the ussr , it makes a lot of sense . 
  since many officials have had a property ( as well as business interests ) abroad , they ca n't exactly close the border . 
  however , they can distract people from traveling by stirring up hatred on both sides . 
  given all the hostility , imaginary or real , who would travel to the western countries only to be called out ? 
  there 's enough strife at home , no need to seek it outside . 
  i see no point in arguing about his chance of winning election . 
  you 'll never know until you try , right ? 
  however , if the opposition parties are so insignificant as you say , then why is the gov ' t so afraid of fair elections and free media ? 
  well , having a populist government detached from reality is a long time tradition in ukraine . 
  whilst i think that the problem with upa is overblown ( it 's about the jews after all , hehe ) , the idea of renaming cities is , if not exactly bullshit , but presented at the wrong time . 
  hell , in that case , you have to issue a metric ton of legal papers , from passports and driving licenses to real estate deeds and banking / business documents . 
  for instance , it 's been more than two decades since the fall of the soviets and i still keep a handful of documents issued by the ussr , such as a school diploma and a military id , just to name a few . 
  it would be a real cancer if i had to obtain a duplicate of any of those , not to mention changing something in the info . 
  yeah , anyone criticizing this country is a self-loathing prick . 
  like saltykov-shchedrin , whose books are being removed from the school literature program , even though it 's been around for a century and a half . 
  what the hell am i reading ? 
  another half-assed attempt to water down the results of moscow mayoral elections ? 
  navalny has been always portrayed as a criminal , he was barred from any kind of debates/ads on tv , all what he had were those `` cubicles '' in the streets and a blog but he won 27 % of the votes anyway . 
  if he had an hour a week of tv time we 'd probably got an uprising . 
  oh , please . 
  where do i sign up ? 
  who may ever need it , yet another expensive event that we ca n't win anything at ? 
  a weak capitalistic offshoot of the glorious sopot music festival . 
  quite decent paintings though , is the author still around ? 
  judging by the username and their blind supporting of the regime , i 'd guess that this moron is a typical kazakh or tatar . 
  many ethnic minorities , especially asian-looking ones , are notorious for being complete vatniks . 
  for the record , i do n't know where it comes from . 
  just an observation . 
  did i get it right that both ukraine and moldova were basically ditched from the eu ? 
  what do ukrainians think in that regard ? 
  boring , * boring * , ^ boring ^ ^ boring ^ ^ ^ boring ps : maybe it 's just me but conchita wurst looks like made from plastic . 
  there 's nothing wrong with buying from the best . 
  really ? 
  so tell me , o wise one , when you get called out as a racist for providing two links - one to a jewish website and one to the wiki - whose logic is that ? 
  [ 25 % of wealthiest russians are jewish ] ( http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,l-4587086,00.html ) [ jews make up 0.266 % of the population ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_population_by_country ) muh antisemitism . 
  the ex-ussr jews are making around 15 % of the israel 's population . 
  of course , they cut ties with the motherland the moment they crossed the border / s, 
  what always gets me is the people who believe that building a drone is something from the field of nuclear physics . 
  that means nothing , actually . 
  like two arduinos on my table do n't mean that italy are sponsoring the putin 's regime . 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; how dar ... ahh , fok it, 
  you 've just misspelled saint-petersburg . 
  yeah , it 's a fresh idea . 
  perhaps you should tell it to someone . 
   push them in front of the camera and half the world 's view just to sell them for parts after they could n't have known their fate beforehand . 
  i 'd be scared as fuck if i were captured by armed men on the enemy territory , especially if it happened in ukraine . 
  do n't change the subject . 
  i said nothing about responsibility . 
  so , mentioning the blog in comments is promoting ? 
  you should issue the list of approved websites and make everyone follow it . 
  still works for me . 
  [ try this way ] ( https://www.google.com.tr/#q=youtube+%d0%b1%d1%83%d1%80%d1%8f%d1%82+%d0%b8%d0%b7%d0%b1%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%b5%d1%82+%d0%bc%d0%be%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b2%d0%b8%d1%87%d0%b0+%d0%b4%d0%bd%d1%80 ) . 
  exhibit a : the recent balkan wars . 
  i mean , organ harvesting , torturing , human trafficking and weapon smuggling is not something unheard of , even here , in europe . 
  i 'm not implying that ukraine is somehow unique in this regard , shit like this happens * everywhere * there is a power vacuum . 
   countries that work properly are you sure that ukraine in its current state falls into this category ? 
  in shoes of the captured soldiers , i too would be afraid of the possibility that enemies may steal my kidney . 
  tbh , i 'm really bad at recognizing faces and i therefore wo n't give my hand to cut off for that . 
  maybe , it was just the beard that confused me . 
  [ anatoly sharij ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/supersharij ) ? 
  he is ukrainian from kiev though . 
  the russian captian looks a lot like ` the deserter ' [ in this video ( a bit nsfw ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrkjqgasyuw&amp;bpctr=1432042144 ) , filmed in dnr a while ago . 
  what if op 's mom would n't mind it ? 
   i do n't know if you can truthfully talk about public support if the country ranks 117 . in the world press freedom index . 
  if all people see is government propaganda of course they will eventually have public support . 
  now , if you bring up those notorious 86 % , i 'll know what to say . 
  this is one surprisingly well written article . 
  props to the author . 
   yes , they are . 
  these numbers would be equal if russia declared war on ukraine and yet it did n't happen . 
  your statement is based on the assumption that putin 's rating and the number of people approving the war with ukraine are equal to each other . 
  war is war and lunch is on schedule . 
  well , for those who live down there , being visibly attracted to humans instead of ... you know . . is a big leap forward , regardless of how stupid it looks . 
  the man in the red jacket is [ stas baretsky ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanislav_baretsky ) , a showman and turbo-chanson / ebm musician . 
  i think he 's just having fun out there . 
  sweeping generalizations , such as using the word `` every '' with regard to a group of a certain ethnicity , may cause testicular cancer . 
  money ca n't buy you class . 
  vasa had a fair chance at moscow . 
  too bad he chose not to be baptised into the orthodox faith . 
  it 's too meta . 
  when nikolai was executed that suffering came as the result of his own policies , his own stupid and backward decisions . 
  whereas lenin ... well , he just had to be himself and let the country go its way as planned . 
  nikolai was a useless prick , to be fair . 
  since i 'm not a big fan of tsarism , it seems natural to give more credit to one of the most progressive politicians ever . 
  i 'd switch places with lenin and did n't get myself injured in a killing attempt . 
  thanks !, 
  wow . 
  what baffles me is the selective blindness of the authorities . 
  instead of battling dangerous religious sects they 're putting all their efforts into hunting for harmless ngos . 
  huh ? 
  could you enlighten me a bit on that ? 
  i 've never heard about this guy . 
  i 'll chime in .
