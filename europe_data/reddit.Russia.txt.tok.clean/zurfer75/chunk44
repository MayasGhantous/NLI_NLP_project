  haha , i remember that very well . 
  i meant , they indeed built all those reactors , enormous dams and nuclear icebreakers . 
  on the other hand , making everyday life more exciting never was a priority for the soviets . 
  well , i was more referring to the past . 
  of course , all these remnants of the soviet glory are no longer economically viable . 
  free market is slowly killing them , one by one . 
  careful here , camerade . 
  these things can make you someone else instead ... 
  the planned economy was not flexible enough to meet the demands of independent customers . 
  granted , a couple of geeks could build a computer in their garage ( and many did so ) but it was impossible to start the mass production , let alone the further sales of the product and making money . 
  also , many talented people moved abroad at the first opportunity . 
  the heavy industry is still alive , though . 
  the soviet-style industry is relatively good at immense projects , it sucks big time only when it comes down to small and medium scale enterprises . 
  perestroika . 
  one of the biggest fuckups of the soviets was the complete loss of the it race . 
  that 's my educated opinion of a person whose first computer was built by hands from a pile of russian microchips . 
  a clone of z80 coupled with 16 +16 kbytes of ram/rom - that was laughable even back in 1989 . 
  here 's the [ full report ( pdf ) ] ( http://www3.weforum.org/docs/wef_human_capital_report_2015.pdf ) , if anyone interested . 
  ps : finland has been ranked first in the world . 
  according to [ the oecd statistics ] ( https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=anhrs ) , greece is the second most hard working nation in the world . 
  no , why . 
  people love reading made-up stories . 
  i just want this sub be better . 
  ask mooslems for that , it 's theirs as a matter of fact . 
  ok , ok , i got it . 
  now gib back polen , suomi and baltic . 
  navalny once compared our dearest leader to a toad sitting on a gas pipe . 
  the sad truth for us is that we all , as a country , are sitting on that pipe . 
  the sad truth for ukrainians is that they 've been living on petrodollars gotten from the cis-countries for too long . 
  that means that indirectly they were sitting on the same pipe , just a little farther from the sweet spot . 
  if * all * their products are n't allowed to be sold on the eu markets , they 'll be fucked up .

  how it is relevant to the discussion ? 
  kp is a tabloid of a worst kind . 
   russian society is much more conservative that 's what the state owned media want you to think . 
  also , millions of muslims make our statistics worse .

   oleg was happy that before easter , after standing in a line for almost 12 hours , he managed to buy one chicken and a cod fish . 
  for the record , i concur with the rest of the comment , but i call bs on this one . 
  if it was about norilsk or sakhalin , i 'd believe it was true . 
  but n-sk , above all , is the third biggest city in the country . 
  it would be a shitstorm happening all over the social media , if there were a lack of basic food and long queues over there . 
  my guess is that your friend just made a bit of fun of you . 
  granted , a lot of western brands have disappeared since the beginning of the crisis , but buying ordinary chicken is yet to be a problem . 
  itt : people talking of things they have no genuine knowledge of . 
  you must be a really famous opposition figure to get an asylum staying outside of the destination country . 
  otherwise your request will be declined in 99.9 % cases , due to some unspoken policy . 
  the only * real * way to get a * chance * for success is entering the country ( illegally or by the tourist visa ) and * then * apply for asylum . 
   works for russians too . 
  sadly , no . 
  hello there , i 'm zurfer75 and i wish to apply for the position of a moderator . 
  so , here goes with my answers to the survey : -- \u2611 * account age  1 year * \u2611 * 500 + combined karma from any subreddits * \u2611 * be on reddit at least once per day to review the mod queue * \u2610 * have experience as a moderator ( or similar ) * - nothing special to speak of . 
  however , i have the experience of managing media projects . 
  -- * do you have any experience with automoderator ( / r/automoderator ) , css or the mod toolbox ( / r/toolbox ) ? 
  * - never used any of these tools before , though i 'm fine with basics of html/css . 
  anyway , i 'm eagerly waiting for any opportunity to educate myself even more . 
  add to that more than 15 years of working as a motion designer , that gave me some understanding of the use of fonts , colors and layouts . 
  * what timezone are you in , and when are you generally on reddit ? 
  open all day long to late night . 
  being a lonely middle aged sociopath has some advantages . 
  * what is your favorite/least favorite thing about / r/europe ? 
  * - diversity of opinions / quick resorting to personal attacks . 
  * what could be implemented to make it better ? 
  * - such a big userbase should be used for good . 
  so , the first thing what comes to mind is conducting polls and surveys . 
  * what would make you a good moderator ? 
  * - a lot of free time ; graphic design skills may come in handy ; sticking to the facts is really matters to me . 
   russians were and * are * any different than the nazis i think i 'm done with this sub , 
  oh , such cuties !, 
  realistically , this notorious `` anti-gay '' law is not aimed at the lgbt community . 
  it 's against unauthorized activism in general . 
  how many have been fined since 2012 , when the law was adopted ? 
  that 's nothing but a drop in the sea of oppressive measures of the state . 
  that depends on whom you ask . 
  on a less related note : even in the west , peter i is often perceived as `` the great leader , who dragged the country out of the medieval age '' , notwithstanding his ruthless policies . 
  yep , this chip is notoriously known for its never-ending way to production . 
  however , 4-core , 800mhz cpu seems well suited for many applications . 
  it usually estimates that mass production can reduce the consumer costs . 
  hopefully , that will be the case . 
   elbrus-4c anyway , it 's a breakthrough . 
  if they manage to reach the mass production stage , it would make a nice niche cpu for a domestic market . 
  what 's * really * interesting in this is that the research team ( like all 500 of them ) , which was developing elbrus from the scratch , has later been hired by intel . 
  the world 's [ best selling helicopter ] ( http://www.helistart.com/helicopter-top-10-lists.aspx ) is `` very bad '' ?

  does he face any obstacles on the way ?
