  our glorious leader can no longer throw up his hands and say `` sweet jesus , what have i done ? '' . 
  that ship has sailed . 
  what 's done is gone . 
  the only question that matters is how far he will go and where he will stop . 
  if my grandmother had wheels , she 'd be a streetcar . 
  russia already has its fingers in ukraine , and it has nowhere to go . 
  what do you want , all out war ? 
  at least , while russia tiptoes in the east it somehow saves lives . 
  otherwise , there would be much more than 7.000 dead civilians . 
  which one ? 
  we have plenty of accidents . 
  here 's a problem with stalin and/or ww2 . 
  during the 90s , the soviet history was demonized to make a space for recognition of atrocities etc. 
  my guess is that people just tired of that . 
  most ex-soviets were really just normal people making a living and should be treated as such . 
  but , nope . 
  all of a sudden , we all became a nation of murderers , rapists and oppressors . 
  it 's a very russian feature : all or nothing . 
  in my opinion , the recognition of the soviet past should have been done in a less severe way . 
  for now , the pendulum is passing to the other side and no one knows how far it will go . 
  it is said that do n't put all your eggs in one basket . 
  stalin died too long ago to be of much concern now . 
  save for historians , nobody gives a damn about the purge . 
  according to [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/effects_of_nuclear_explosions#blast_damage ) , the blast wind speed may approach ~ 300 m/s , therefore it would take about 30 seconds to go from the kremlin to my place . 
  it should give me enough time to recall my memories , when my life will flash before my eyes ... 
  i 'm guessing that poorly worded questions can confuse people . 
  blocking , say , cp in vkontakte is also censorship to some extent . 
  i bet that almost everyone would admit that it 's a necessary measure . 
  already removed . 
  it was placed on the fence by a local company , to which said fence belongs to . 
  so , they were in their own right . 
  at least , at place where i live , it will end very quickly . 
  just a bright flash and the next moment you 're dead . 
  it 's calming . 
  you 're not really reading , are n't you ? 
  that 's exactly what i said . 
  no matter where you was born , ethnicity does n't merely stem from the view from the window . 
  am a muscovite but being born and raised here does n't automatically make me russian , by the way . 
  the fact that i acknowledge my national and cultural identity does that . 
   nationality is not based off parents nationality . 
  stop going banana , lobogato !, 
  even though my mother was born in harbin , it does n't mean that i 'm a half-chinese . 
  i found [ the poll ] ( http://fom.ru/kultura-i-dosug/12148 ) on their website . 
  as far as i understand , 82 % believe that gov ' t officials have to be in control of the media , whatever it would mean ( age ratings ? ) . 
  on the other hand , 56 % are against the ** banning ** of controversial art pieces . 
   the moscow-based public opinion foundation found that 82 percent of russians agree with the state 's control of films , books , theater productions and art exhibits . 
  and then  yet the poll < ...  found that 56 percent of the russian population think bans on theater productions , films and other artistic creations are unacceptable . 
  the red army suffered heavy losses in the beginning of the war , when russians were in the majority , and hence eventually they should have been replaced by fresh troops . 
  as an anecdotal info , both of my granddads were drafted in 1941 , then returned to moscow as early as 1942-43 and were never sent back to the war . 
  well , it was kind of true . 
  ** april 1943 ** 1,77 % armenians 1,48 % georgians 1,4 % azerbaijanians 2,62 % uzbeks 2,22 % kazakhs ** 1st july 1943 ** russians 63,84 % ukrainians 11,6 % armanians 1,4 % georgians 1,17 % azerbaijanians 1,57 % uzbeks 4,44 % ** 1st july 1944 ** russians 51,78 % ukrainians 33,9 % armenians 0,81 % georgians 0,5 % azebaijanians 0,81 % uzbeks 1,25 % __ * from `` the peoples of caucasus and the red army '' by alexey bezugolny . 
  that 's why there 's the difference between ww2 and the great patriotic war , where the latter refers to the period from 1941 to 1945 . 
  i mean , this is how it 's being taught in school . 
  what always gets me is that how many young guys , especially those living abroad , tend to glorify the ussr and , to some extent , russia nowadays . 
  it 's almost like they have may have had some skewed perception of how things were going on back then . 
  they 're looking at old photos ( which were made up for propaganda purposes ) or watching old sovet movies ( neither of which were the truth ) and getting convinced that they know something . 
  10/10 for efforts but comparing those two is insane . 
  falling of assad would put alawits and christian minorities on the brink of death or enslavement , while ukrofascism is imaginary , not a real menace . 
   the claims were published in the pro-kremlin russian newspaper komsomolskaya pravda . 
  the newspaper quoted the opinions of several russian women on the matter . 
  kp is a tabloid . 
  spewing crap about celebs is their bread & butter . 
  thanks for input . 
  i meant , him being an observer at a polling station or participating in the commission does n't mean he was a * gov ` t * official , in sense that it was his permanent position or something like that . 
  in theory , anyone who meets the conditions can apply for this job or become an independent observer .

  4th day of ~ ~ drinking ~ ~ holidays is not going well for the editorial board of themoscowtimes.com . 
  pozdnyakov was not an official but a member of the opposition party , \u0420\u041f\u0420-\u041f\u0410\u0420\u041d\u0410\u0421 . 
  blink twice if you are being held at gunpoint !, 
  come on !, 
  even though poles have been whining for all these years , you are guys in your own right to blame russians on any occasion , considering proximity to the motherland and the significant non-latvian minority . 
  why so sad , mate ? 
  it 's a great day , is n't it ? 
  not so long ago , one of the pro-regime mps ( iirc ) threw out the accusation that an old russian rock-band `` kino '' ( local copycats of early `` the cure '' , quite popular ones ) was on a payroll of the cia/british intel or something along the lines . 
  not sure how it went in the west but the sex pistols have certainly destabilized a lot of young minds in our capital cities . 
  `` never mind the bollocks ... '' was the first punk album ever i managed to get . 
  `` the great rock-n-roll swindle '' was one of the first music movies that i got a copy of . 
  the iron curtain had been still in place , so it was n't so easy after all . 
  thanks !, 
  where it is possible to learn more about what jobs and positions are needed ? 
  re-read my comment , please . 
  `` last summer '' = `` about a year ago '' . 
  haha , i mixed you up with akarlin , my apologies !, 
  who is going to start a with the eu ? 
  perhaps , you should n't go banana . 
  the text on the flag says : `` russia is europe '' ( or `` russia is the part of europe '' or `` russia belongs to europe '' ), 
   no-one assaulted , no-one arrested . 
  i just expressed my doubts in the comment above . 
  of course , levada can be considered as an independent polling company , to some extent . 
  however , given the complexity of the political situation , i wo n't bet my money on them being entirely trustworthy . 
   levada center , a moscow-based pollster ,, 
  are you being willfully dense ? 
  ~ ~ you said nobody 's arrested ~ ~ , i said one guy got arrested , end of story . 
  who the hell cares how they do it in germoney ? 
  edit : no , it was n't you . 
  other countries ' legislation is irrelevant to the subject .
