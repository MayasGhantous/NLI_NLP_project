  he * was * detained , his arrest was linked to the demonstration and therefore your statement above is untrue . 
  * had , about a year ago . 
  for now , no one knows it for sure . 
  the results of the polls , recently conducted by levada and state-run agencies are questionable at very least . 
  however , do n't read too much into that number . 
  we do n't give a damn about the politics as long as everything goes fine but now it 's not the case . 
   no-one assaulted , no-one arrested . 
  i ca n't even . 
  [ detaining of artyom loskutov ] ( https://meduza.io/news/2015/05/01/v-novosibirske-zaderzhan-organizator-monstratsii-artem-loskutov ) , the leader of `` monstration '' , does n't count for you ? 
  i wonder if other motor clubs would hold a grudge against nw because of secondhand embarrassment .

  i 've read somewhere , that the infamous number `` 2 millions '' was calculated in a similar way : they took a number of rapes , real or imaginary , in one municipality and extended it to the rest of the occupied territory . 
  so , both estimates are a lie ? 
  i 'm ok with that . 
  yeah , the information about two millions of rapes in germany was obtained from the ( former ) nazi authorities and the resulting number is probably overblown tenfold after decades of the cold war propaganda . 
  do you see ? 
  it works both ways . 
  yeah , losing twenty fucking six million people is also ridiculous . 
  who could ever do that , amirite ? 
  iirc , somewhere around 1940 , the wehrmacht command had loosened the rules regarding sex crimes against untermenschen , therefore a ` race crime ' was concerned with merely regulating the consensual relationship between true aryans and others . 
  that 's all fine and dandy but it was a quote from the english wiki page . 
  the usual charges of bias and brainwashing are not applicable here . 
   by contrast thousands of soviet female nurses , doctors and field medics fell victim to rape when captured , and were often murdered afterwards . 
  [ 33 ] german soldiers used to brand the bodies of captured partisan women -- and other women as well -- with the words `` whore for hitler 's troops '' and rape them . 
  [ 69 ] following their capture some german soldiers vividly bragged about committing rape and rape-homicide . 
  [ 70 ] in the soviet union alone an estimates regarding the rape of soviet women by the wehrmacht range up to 10,000,000 incidents , with between 750,000 and 1,000,000 children being born as a result . 
  [ 71 ] [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ wiki ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_crimes_of_the_wehrmacht#mass_rapes ) . 
  your anecdotal evidence is worth nothing . 
  many victims was killed , many others never told about that , because soviet authorities often treated rape victims as collaborators and sent them to gulag . 
  just as insane as ten million rapes committed by germans on the territory of the ussr . 
  it 's kind of weird , by the way . 
  at that time , germany was one of the most enlightened countries in the world . 
  since they thought of slavs as of inferior race , were n't they supposed to see sexual intercourse with untermensches as a sort of bestiality ? 
  have you ever shot a real ak , brah ? 
  people attending sjw meetings have no balls whatsoever ^ / s, 
  a lot of them ca n't even spell ` international ' properly , you give people too much credit . 
  paint 'em black , cut the balls and let them in . 
  problem solved . 
  oh , thanks a lot !, 
  that 's what i was looking for . 
  literally , yes . 
  i 'd put it slightly differently . 
  something along the lines of `` once you 've been touched by it , you 'll never be the same '' . 
  well , they merely support their elected president , nothing else . 
  what is an illegal annexation for you , is a peaceful and legit reunion for them . 
  i would n't put too much into that . 
  if they supported an actual war ( implying they 're aware of what 's going on ) , in that case , it would be another story . 
  because of having a swastika on the cover , this book was banned by the bookseller over fears of being accused of spreading nazi propaganda , just like it recently happened in a shop selling ww2 figures . 
  mts bank started issuing unionpay debit cards , by the way . 
  although i 'm yet to figure out the processing costs , i think it 's about time to get prepared for excluding russia from the western payment systems . 
  my guess is that it would happen quite soon , if `` rebels '' in donbass start another offensive . 
  russian economy had been surviving for years in the 90s , despite lacking the luxury of high oil revenues . 
  reduced earnings from fossils export would have a huge negative impact on the country but it wo n't necessarily cause the economy to crash . 
  it would be something like ukraine or belarus : yeah , it 's quite bad , but still not a suicide . 
  oh , night wolves became a laughing stock a long ago , when they start flirting with the high-ranked officials . 
  no idea how to translate ' \u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f ' though that 's exactly what they did , in eyes of hardline bikers . 
   cutting gas trade would be suicidal for russia .

  i usually avoid being didactic , but recently i got hooked on q.i. 
  with stephen fry and started watching all the seasons from the start . 
  sometimes it comes out of me , haha . 
  this quote is misattributed . 
   this actually comes from the novel children of the arbat ( 1987 ) by anatoly rybakov . 
  in his later book the novel of memory rybakov admitted that he had no sources for such a statement . 
  it would be great if only it could be possible to work 40 hrs a week , as the graph shows , and make a good living . 
  google mordvin / udmurt / mari / komi people and check out the image search results . 
   ... their god damn government annexing and destabilizing sovereign countries . 
  also , if you look at the numbers a majority of those hot chicks probably support putin . 
  that 's rich . 
  how do you know that ? 
  putin has been voted in as the president in 2012 , when nothing has been annexed yet . 
  is there any legitimate way to change the country 's policies on the run between elections ? 
  are they looking for mercenaries ? 
  the redhead anomaly , there are too many of them . 
  you tell me !, 
  i too have some genes from that region . 
   implying that there will be russians or romanians in five years, 
  [ exactly . 
  nothing wrong with that but it would be better if russia could be compared with something that is more promising . 
   do russian women cook also ? 
  if you 're looking for someone in their 20s then the answer is no , unless you find a bride from a rural area . 
  however , the latter are like opening a can of worms , for real . 
  you ca n't take the village out of the girl . 
  although the comparison with romania is not really flattering , it 's still better than nothing .

  it 's a lovely moment when enlightened europeans show their true face , hehehe . 
  being a subject to the u.s. sanctions is a crime in europe ? 
  what 's up with poland ? 
  are they still into win95 osr2 ? 
  out of interest : what crime , if any , do you think they committed ? 
  i nowhere said that oxygen was `` manufactured '' by plants , hehe . 
  iirc , * all * naturally found elements , save for hydrogen and helium , were generated in stars as a result of the stellar nucleosynthesis .
