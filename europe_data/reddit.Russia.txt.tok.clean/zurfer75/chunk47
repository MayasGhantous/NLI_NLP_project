  i often come across the point of view that the evolution is real but humans are the only ones who did n't evolve from other species . 
  well , most ukrainians i 've seen or met did speak with a notable accent , which i do n't like . 
  that 's all i wanted to say . 
  apples and oranges . 
  what does speaking in dialects have to do with having an accent ? 
  actually , no . 
  plants and cyanobacterias are responsible for the rapid ( in geological sense ) increase in atmospheric oxygen . 
  creationism is not exactly the news . 
  have to disagree with the last part . 
  for me it 's much simpler to find a common ground with someone from kiev than with folks from donetsk or russia . 
  russian , surprisingly without that horrible accent . 
  i bet the soundtrack was mastered somewhere in kiev . 
  semantics . 
  what 's wrong with that statement ? 
  eu * is * anti-russia at the moment , it 's just a nonsense thinking otherwise . 
  yeah , 86 % seem totally plausible / s now there are municipal elections ongoing in a couple of moscow satellite towns . 
  independent observers , who noticed violations during the voting , were beaten up by some ` unknown ' thugs . 
  their video cams were seized by the police . 
  local authorities accused them being `` fascists , trained in the polish camps '' . 
  that 's how the democratic elections are being held in the motherland . 
  an empty fridge is the best teacher . 
  to be fair , the dearest leader won the last elections with 63,6 % of the vote , that 's not even close to the results of the election in kazakhstan . 
  the power of archicad, 
  for the record , i do n't support hate crimes but some measures have to be adopted to deal with the situation in moscow sooner rather than later . 
  many people do n't know what it is like to live in here where only less than a third of the population are indigenous to the city , a half are migrants and about twenty percents are muslim halfwits . 
  couple that with the widespread poverty and you get a town-sized ghetto . 
  [ the video in question ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=npznxztucdu ) , if anyone interested . 
  how dare we , being born and bred as slaves , speak in front of the enlightened western nobles ? 
  it was n't supposed to insult you either . 
  i just pointed out that awesomelove seems rather obsessed with russia . 
  my apologies , i used your comment history to illustrate how it should be , in a perfect world , 
  what makes you think it was a sort of slavery ? 
  it was a strict totalitarian regime with closed borders prevented its citizens from fleeing to the west . 
  the party managed to avoid internal dissent by constant brainwashing and persecution of the most vocal opponents . 
  granted , it was bad but not * that * bad as outright slavery . 
  i ca n't believe it was written by akunin . 
  a bleak comparison with the best korea - is that all he managed to come up with ? 
  that being said , old age has no mercy . 
  i knew that german nazis were less humane than others but i 'm rather surprised with japanese ranked as low as 4th . 
  i thought they would be 3rd , right below the soviet team .

  today is the cleanup day in moscow as well , the last one before may , 1 . 
  as a filthy sociopath , i showed a middle finger to community activities and went instead to the cemetery to clean up my greatparents ' grave site . 
  china seems fucked up big time . 
  i ca n't even imagine what it 'd would be like to live there , breathing such dirty air . 
  it 's about 34 ( green zone ) around my home and i can smell gasoline fumes , while they have it ten times worse . 
  that 's sad . 
  [ here you are ] ( http://www.fontanka.ru/2015/04/06/144/ ) . 
  there 's a tradition within the motorcycle club culture of saint-petersburg , that a kickoff to the riding season is up to the leader of night wolves . 
  apparently , it is going to be changed this year : local bikers from piter are turning against a leading role of nw , due to the `` friendship '' of the latter with the regime . 
  it was n't like as if lazy peasants fucked themselves up and nobody was around to give a hand . 
  armed groups were robbing villagers blind , taking away crops and cattle . 
  i would n't think of it as the new branding . 
  real , thoughtful journalists and editors were expelled from office and the management hired new people to take their places . 
  judging by the impact it had on people , it should be called a genocide . 
  although , to what extent it was intentional or what initial intentions were - that is still debatable . 
  there 's a broad range of opinions on the topic : from `` a punishment for fighting for independence '' , then to `` the intentional ethnic cleansing of ukraine '' , after that to `` a lack of competence of the soviets , resulted in a wide-spread famine '' and from there to `` the rapid development of industry required more working hands , that 's why the soviets pushed country people to the cities and starved a surplus of peasants to death '' . 
  sputnik , former known as ria novosti . 
  what kind of reaction do you expect from the society ? 
  this is not a topic to debate on the national tv , therefore it never happened . 
  paganism is on the rise in russia , esp . 
  among the youths , although it 's a new wave which comes from urban areas , along with celtic neo folk music etc. 
  `` old-school '' paganism has always been there for centuries , it does n't go anywhere any time soon . 
  some ethnics are just more into it than others . 
  there 're [ many different ethnic groups ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_groups_in_russia ) . 
  taking a visible influx of middle-easterners into account , it 's possible that assyrians , among others , also moved into the country . 
  well , for instance , a good friend of mine is a somewhat karelinan / pomor / muscovite , another one is of polish / russian origin , me is a mix of mari / ( belo ) russian / semitic , et cetera . 
  i hope you 'll get an idea . 
  turks and caucasians are not my type , i 'm not quite aware of how they live here . 
  yes , it 's pretty common . 
  historically , people from the north have been more eager to marry each other , the same goes to southerners , due to the cultural differences . 
  however , it 's a fading trend . 
  muslim minorities are more traditional than others and tend to marry within their own religious / ethnic group . 
  it seems you 've already made up your mind in the matter . 
  every assimilated ethnicity had a significant impact on society , though to a less extent in case of the northern caucasus . 
  my guess is there are certain tensions between the different branches of the state security services . 
  not a war yet , of course , but a fight under the carpet . 
  the dearest leader might have certain security concerns , regarding chechens or someone else , plain and simple . 
  free money is getting tight or at least that 's how it perceived ? 
  [ found a fb post written by volkov ] ( https://www.facebook.com/leonid.m.volkov/posts/880783811944253 ), 
  [ history of russia from earliest times by sergei m. soloviev ] ( http://www.ai-press.com/soloviev.html ) , it seems that not all books have been translated yet . 
  [ here 's 29 volumes of the original study ] ( http://www.runivers.ru/lib/book4544/ ) , in russian , of course . 
  all that i mentioned above did come from the golden horde . 
  modern tatars are their remnants , more or less . 
  i 'm writing too much on this sub so i ca n't really find my speculations on the issue . 
  in short , kadyrov has given away a few sings of lacking of the usual obedience when his people were accused of killing of nemtsov . 
  the leader was out of reach and the situation was certainly alarming . 
  well , when the dearest leader was absent for a while , i tried to point out how much was going on behind the scene in regard of the chechens ' reaction but was n't taken seriously . 
  now that moment has finally come : ** i fucking told you so !, 
  i do , but am a racist pig who despise an asian part of the mindset . 
   putting russia and aq in the same row mr obama , is it you ? 
  ah , izhevsk , a cradle of the hardbass dance !, 
  apparently , the poor guy got beaten for speaking a `` foreign '' language . 
  it is not necessary that those thugs had something against udmurts in particular . 
  i myself once got into serious trouble for speaking with a moscow accent in public ... not so far away from moscow , haha . 
  not to mention a few times when i was bullied by local gopnicks for wearing an earring . 
  a lot . 
  traditional winter clothes , meat dishes , medieval war tactics and horse riding , ruthless , fatalism , a prevalent disdain for individualism - a few that come in mind . 
  that link must stay blue . 
  supposed to be more friendly and supportive to those who disagree with the actions of the regime , maybe ?
