  something along the lines of `` the enemy of my enemy etc '' like it was during the cold war ? 
  well , moving overseas is a different can of worms entirely . 
  it 's well-known that people in the u.s. and canada are way less xenophobic then fellow europeans . 
  with all due respect but it 's not a big deal . 
  the western countries love the people throwing themselves into a meat grinder of the totalitarian regimes . 
  fallen heroes are even more appreciated : they are not someone requiring actual help and give an opportunity of issuing another strong-worded letter . 
  due to recent developments , it 's not clear if all of them can be considered as non-pariah states , ahaha . 
  ah , now i got it . 
  sorry , bad wording on my side . 
  oh , come on . 
  apart from pariah states , can you name an european nation that has a positive view about russian nationals ? 
  care to provide a better source then ? 
  there are millions of foreign migrants solely in moscow , let alone the rest of the country . 
   actually hating russians helps putin . 
  indeed . 
  not to mention that blind hatred from europeans helps him to restrain more skilled professionals from fleeing the country . 
  europe , in general , always comes in handy : them being easily manipulated while serving as a [ summer house for his cronies ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lt_d3doakqs/vtuj8c4hiti/aaaaaaaabfs/xmmowhqt6bc/s1600/screenshot_123.jpg ) ( personal sanctions ? 
  yeah , for sure , lol ) . 
  to be fair , russia was the [ second most popular destination for migrants ] ( http://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/charts/top-25-destination-countries-global-migrants-over-time ) in 2013 , not sure if germany surpassed us in recent years or not . 
  no , exactly . 
  look how bravely egxplayer nailed it . 
  it 's almost like there were five men total in the country , and those 20 % were nothing but a lonely hobo living under the bridge . 
  as if an entire country were a hivemind and should be treated as such . 
  that 's the way people think , do n't sweat it . 
  apples and oranges . 
  rotting in a totalitarian shithole is not the same as living in a first world country , where you would n't give a damn about the rest of the world and be fine nonetheless . 
  bullshit and you know it . 
  who can tell the difference between the state and the people ? 
  it 's too complicated for an average joe and rightfully so . 
  every country gets the government it deserves . 
  when the world hates you , hate it back . 
  fine , let the hate flow through my veins . 
  when it 's not snowing , i.e. , in the summer . 
   despite being promised the requested discount , zharov vents his frustration about having to vacation in russia . 
   `` prices for anything decent are at least 2-3 times higher than high-quality hotels in europe , '' he writes to ulyanov . 
  `` this is a catastrophe . 
  i do n't know what to do . '', 
  [ i could n't stand it ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/003/194/001.jpg ), 
  well , the war came unexpected for almost all of us . 
  it 's a horrible feeling when shit like that is going on and you have no power to change anything that happens here . 
  feels like a trap . 
  thanks again !, 
  seems like many russians look in that direction nonetheless . 
  that 's way better than the root comment . 
  thank you , it was informative . 
  i just hope you was n't serious when you said that you 're afraid of the possible invasion out of that . 
  otherwise , it 's just sad , and makes me feel that europe is not a place to flee to , when the shit hit the fan at home . 
  the root comment :  we get thousands of russian immigrants annually too . 
  wiki article you linked gives the diaspora population growth of about 8k for 10 years ( 2001-2011 ) . 
  ~ ~ how it could be `` thousands annually '' ? ~ ~ edit : wiki is out of touch here . 
  i 'd like to see something more convincing . 
  there are dozens of different languages in vietnam , those children might belong to the different tribes . 
  meanwhile , russian is 4th most spoken language in the country . 
  kids do n't care about the goddamn integration , they only need lingua franca to talk with each other . 
  i was asking about `` thousands '' of russian immigrants in czech rep who `` refuse to assimilate '' . 
  how the heck is ukraine related to my question ? 
  care to provide any source about `` most refuse to assimilate '' ? 
  except it does n't , lol . 
  calm down a bit . 
  spb was built on the bones of numerous serfs , died during construction . 
  not sure if it 's a good example , given the shitty weather and the growing risk of being flooded . 
  in the recent interview to dozhd , belkovsky said something like : `` rogozin , being an expert in this field , should lead a government campaign of shooting itself in a leg '' , hehe . 
   russia 's southern ural mountain republic of bashkortostan  sergei ** bukayev ** and konstantin surkov color me surprised !, 
  that said above is mostly goes to siberia and tundra areas in the far north , the regions that are already inhospitable for living . 
  european part of the country will get better , hopefully . 
  this . 
  and the rise of temperatures by releasing greenhouse gases will likely exacerbate the severity of climate change . 
  [ mysterious siberian crater attributed to methane ] ( http://www.nature.com/news/mysterious-siberian-crater-attributed-to-methane-1.15649 ) build-up and release of gas from thawing permafrost most probable explanation , says russian team . 
  it 's not all unicorns and rainbows with methane ... 
  i used the word `` bottomless '' for a reason . 
  in some areas , which can be as large as an average european country , the thickness of permafrost goes up to 500m . 
  do n't forget about a swamp gas , methane , happily exploding from any spark . 
  he 's been playing that game for decades , using every opportunity to gain leverage over his neighbours . 
  permafrost , when melting , turns into a huge bottomless swamp , so it will be even worse . 
  2/3 of the territory is permafrost . 
  dunno , he has n't shown up for the parade since the 60th anniversary . 
  is it a big deal that he wo n't appear this year ? 
  anyway , almost no one is going to be there , so he could get some points for cheap . 
  vatniks are not necessarily stupid or simple-minded . 
  many of them just chose the side that they see as winning . 
   in a note posted on kasparov.ru today < . .   `` i do n't know what to do , '' the activist says . 
  `` i have only one thought : to raise a stink in the media to bring this attention to the very top < ...  that 's what it exactly is . 
  the tear-jerk story how activists ca n't find a free truck in spb , it sounds totally plausible / s. 
  it is once again proved that when the kasparov 's website was blocked , nothing of value was lost . 
  here 's my favorite hip-hop band : [ 2h company - \u0420\u044d\u043f \u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u041d\u0435 \u041a\u0430\u043b ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zalvppr7zlu ) the cute `` folk '' rap : [ \u0421\u042f\u0412\u0410 - \u041f\u0418\u0412\u0410 \u041d\u0415\u0422 ( 2013 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aig5dj0qgn8 ) just a random mix : [ russian rap meat mix - # 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eahlvtdr5nk ), 
  that does n't mean that they shake in their shoes . 
  the opposition is tightly controlled by the gov ` t. 
  poland is usually portrayed as the us sockpuppet , that 's all . 
  back in 2011-12 , it was n't known for sure if any protester could be jailed just like that . 
  the time has changed for activists , thus it 's highly unlikely that the mass protests can happen , unless the gov ' t does something really stupid . 
  * q : * do you believe in god ?

  yes , i believe there must be someone ... or might be something ... out there ... looking at me from up there ... [ x ] a religious nutbag, 
  moreover , the real estate market has been almost frozen and the dollar prices lost about a half of their worth , similarly to the rouble exchange rate . 
  70 % is a far fetched assertion , most photos indeed belong to the motherland . 
  someone has to show them carpet_rise or similar publics on vk / lj . 
  my bear-wife loves that sub . 
  it 's time to bow down to the russian overlords , yurop !, 
  well , the moscow middle-class has never really bought into the gov ' t narrative , so i do n't see a big contradiction to the poll result . 
  our dearest leader is extremelly popular among the ~ ~ mentally handicapped peasants ~ ~ alternatively gifted citizens who represent the lion 's share of the population , haha .
