  ps : yeah , i know , i 'm going to hell for my arrogant attitude . 
  my guess that it depends on the scale of the possible repressions . 
  if the mood of my environment is anything to go by ( top notch it / developers / motion designers ) , i 'd rather say that almost everyone is looking for opportunities for leaving the country , more or less . 
  said the guy having such fantasies . 
  a local maidan is not even remotely close to happen . 
  it is more likely going to be a witch hunt against the `` liberal '' 15 % minority . 
  https://slon.ru/posts/50592  `` the diffuculty in reaching these remote places is overwhelming even for a well-trained man . 
  let 's suppose that there was a sabotage group which simultaneously set the forest on fire at many spots . 
  [ granted ] , we can blame everything on the residents or the natural causes but it 's necessary to determine the real cause [ of the disaster ] '' , [ rogozhkin ] said . 
  why do i get the feeling you 're touching yourself while typing that ? 
  haha , that 's rich coming from a turk , just like the pot calling the kettle black . 
  `` unparalleled '' ? 
  not sure about the medieval times , but wiki says that soldiers of wechrmacht committed five times more rapes than the red army did . 
  when it come down to civilians , both armies were brutal as hell . 
  except , there are no invaders , according to the official point of view . 
  regardless , it 's all started long before the whole maidan / crimea thing . 
  both sides use the conflict as a card in their game . 
  neither ukraine nor russia are confident enough to cope with the crumbling economies . 
  blaming le ebil west in case of russia as well as blaming russia in case of ukraine have been a sort of a national sport for a decade of even more . 
  i do n't think that russia 's fears about the possible threats of the nato/us presence around the borders are as baseless as it 's often portrayed . 
  regardless of the current meddling in ukraine , we 've been always seen as an enemy of the western world . 
  i 'm not going to argue how we 've come to this point - it 's pretty clear for everyone with two brain cells . 
  nonetheless , my point stands . 
  moreover , if the west had a chance to draw the country into the internal conflict which might further lead to the total balkanization , i.e. , rendering the country into a handful of weak , devastated and powerless states , whilst not being directly involved in that process , they would do it in a blink of the eye . 
  for the record , i share the sentiment that the country , in its current state , is not going anywhere to achieve anything good . 
  for now it 's an artificial construct , in which many parts simply hate each other . 
  someone might say that dismantling should have happened in the early '90s , along with the fall of the soviets . 
  maybe . 
  i 'm much more disappointed with the reaction of the public . 
  killing of a journalist is not something to cheer at , regardless of the political preferences he had . 
  what is the difference between the `` ukromedia '' and the `` ukrainian media '' ? 
  i was on the phone , tired of typing . 
  did someone not catch an idea ? 
  refrain yourself from watching the russian tv and be fine . 
  personally , i do n't give a flying fuck about the words spoken by the dearest leader . 
  how is it related to a murder of a kiev 's journo ? 
  he was killed out of passion or something along the lines ? 
  a lack of the self-awareness among the iarmy is astounding . 
  i have a weird feeling that you cunts from either side are reading the same book . 
   russian products ? 
  to be fair ... 
  yes , there are many things which is being * assembled * in russia from the imported parts . 
  cars , electronics , yes . 
  most of these parts come from china , apparently in exchange for roubles , therefore the western sanctions had a lower impact on the local market than it could be . 
  sorry , not my type . 
  go ask him , if you want to . 
  bbc : [ pro-russian journalist killed in kiev ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32337621 ) ua today : [ breaking : controversial ukrainian publicist oles buzyna shot dead in kyiv ] ( http://uatoday.tv/politics/famous-ukrainian-journalist-oles-buzina-shot-dead-in-kyiv-421736.html ) world bulletin : [ ukrainian journalist oles buzina shot dead in kiev ] ( http://www.worldbulletin.net/news/157964/ukrainian-journalist-oles-buzina-shot-dead-in-kiev ) edit : the sunday morning herald : [ ukraine journalist oles buzina killed by masked gunmen in kiev : interior ministry ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/world/ukraine-journalist-oles-buzina-killed-by-masked-gunmen-in-kiev-interior-ministry-20150416-1mmvgl.html ) the international business times : [ ukrainian journalist oles buzina known for pro-russia views shot dead ] ( http://www.ibtimes.co.in/breaking-ukrainian-journalist-oles-buzina-shot-dead-kiev-629459 ) ps : [ no bullet proof yet ] unian.info : [ journalist serhiy sukhobok killed ] ( http://www.unian.info/society/1067807-journalist-serhiy-sukhobok-killed.html ), 
  hmm , i was referring to the fact that it was a murder . 
  sorry , it seems i misunderstood you . 
  at least , you explained your position instead of typing `` i lol 'd '' and then calling it a day . 
   there was a pretty big change as the constitutional amendments of 2010 were reversed and 2004 constitution was reinstated . 
  well , if history is anything to go by , there were numerous examples when the constitution was used to wipe someone 's ass . 
  for instance , the russian constitution was pretty good written but here 's a little problem that no one bother to follow the rules . 
  what do you say about the report of [ anton gerashchenko / arsen avakov ] ( https://www.facebook.com/anton.gerashchenko.7/posts/843370589083123 ) ? 
  are they also mouthpieces for kremlin ? 
  that guy was shot dead from multiple wounds in the stairwell of his apartment block . 
  what word in `` \u0423\u043c\u0438\u0441\u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e '' you do n't understand ? 
   it 's actually a site with russian propaganda . 
  is it ? 
  i had no idea . 
  a quote from [en.wikipedia.org ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian_news_agency ) :  the ukrainian news agency ( ukrainian : \u0406\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0435 \u0430\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e '' \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0456 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438 '' ; informatsiyne ahentstvo `` ukrayins ` ki novyny '' ) is a kiev-based ukrainian news agency . 
  it produces and provides of political , business and financial information , as well as popular photo reporting service . 
  since february 2008 the company is part of the u.a. 
  inter media group limited who also owns 61 % of the ukrainian tv channel inter . 
  i was n't intending to jump on you , my apologies , if it was looking like that . 
  funny that the story has made the front page , while on / r/europe ... not that much . 
  as for the constant gay nazi russophobic circle jerk here , i just stopped bothering a long time ago , hehe . 
  the ukranian ministry of affairs [ admitted ] ( http://mvs.gov.ua/mvs/control/main/uk/publish/article/1445094 ) that it was a murder , the victim was receiving death threats recently , a day before the death he reportedly send a letter to his friend and the text was already [ published ] ( http://ukranews.com/news/166485.opublikovano-predsmertnoe-pismo-olega-kalashnikova.ru ) by the ukromedia . 
  does it look like a suicide ? 
   lolk such a childish attitude to discussion merely undermines your own credibility . 
  if you want to call it a revolution - as you wish . 
  just keep in mind that revolutions are usually associated with the more severe changes that are being brought to the country , such as altering the constitutional order or a radical reshape of the governing system . 
  indeed , a parallel here might be drawn with the '90s in the neighbouring country . 
  since the fall of the ussr , the ukrainian policies have been spinning around the kremlin , therefore the kiev coup d'etat can be seen as a corresponding event to the 1991 coup attempt in moscow . 
  in regard of acquiring the actual independence , i 'm gon na stand by that analogy . 
  the difference is that instead of yeltsin , ukrainians have got a local brew of khodorkovsky . 
  it would be funny if the kiev 's version of the 1993 events will follow as well , haha . 
  well , since the operation `` successor '' that happened in 2008 when the overall situation has started spiralling out of control , there has been nothing to be proud of . 
  meddling in ukraine ( and georgia , to some extent ) is certainly a fiasco , and clearly we , as a nation , should be ashamed of it . 
  although , it 's rather attributed to the government being dicks than to the ordinary people just being idiots . 
  not that the idiocy could be an excuse though it might happen with everyone . 
  as for the moments to be proud of , i 'd rather pick the relatively peaceful dissolve of the soviet union and the warsaw pact . 
  also , august of ' 91 , the rare moment in our history when the revolution worked out in a proper way . 
  though one might also draw parallels with the hitler-jugend , i 'll take your version any day . 
  in my defence i can only say that once i had written `` punk 's not de \u24b6 d '' on my red cravat ( have i used the right word for it ? 
  ) , i got immediately banned from wearing it to school . 
  there are stuffed heads of said apologists all over the walls of / r/europe ... 
   do not have communist , nazi or other extremist past what about a membership in the [ pioneer organization ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_lenin_all-union_pioneer_organization ) , does it still count ? 
  are you implying if there were no war , all that money would be spent for the benefit of the people ? 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  routine duties , such as preventing wildfires , have not enough room for corruption to be interesting for officials . 
  tbh , i do n't care about smuggling of delicatessen since i ca n't afford it anymore . 
  having oysters in the fridge is irrelevant for a daily ration , not to mention that illegal deliveries from belarus is a drop in the ocean . 
  what i 'm upset about is the absence of quality , affordable food for medium-income residents . 
  nope . 
  most european groceries & other food , save for serbian apples , completely disappeared from shops a while ago . 
  since you seem so well-informed of the conflict , perhaps you should provide us with answers , instead of jumping at someone who merely read the report and stated a couple of things . 
  this time it was the ukrainian side who broke the ceasefire ( if it has been holding in reality , first of all ) . 
  easter has nothing to do with it , only the weather conditions do . 
  haha , bbc can not into irony .
