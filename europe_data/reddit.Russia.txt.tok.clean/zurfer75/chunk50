  sasha `` hirurg '' has lost his mind completely . 
  not that it 's sad ... 
   i was comparing it to other countries that also had their turning points , or other defining moments . 
  yet they stick to one generally agreed name . 
  there 's one thing which has to be taken into account : it 's been almost 45 years of the soviet 's brainwashing since the end of the ww2 . 
  what we have so far it is the result of the lasting propaganda . 
  have to deal with it `` as is '' :\\ i doubt it can be helped somehow in the near future . 
   that 's because gpw was the part that affected russia . 
    you are right . 
  the other part is where russia affected it 's neighbours . 
  how do you call that part ? 
  it 's called ww2 , as it has to be . 
  look , i can understand your butthurt about the partitioning of poland but i think it can be explained in simple terms . 
  from the point of view of an average russian , the molotov-ribbentrop pact , or , i donno , the katyn massacre are nothing but another ugly * episodes * in the endless row of victories and fuckups of the country . 
  the part that happened between 41 and 45 , which is usually addressed as the great patriotic war ( sic !, 
  ) , on the other hand , is being seen as something completely different . 
  since the mongol invasions , it was the second time when the entire nation was put on a brink of the physical extermination . 
  that 's why it has a special name . 
  meanwhile , poland ... what is poland ? 
  where the hell it is ? 
  from the local pov , what 's a difference between the war in poland and the war , say , in north africa ? 
  or france ? 
  or the pacific war theater ? 
   have to vote him out . 
  three years to go for a chance to do it , haha . 
  these refugees really pulled the shortest straw in the draw . 
  across the rest of the country , they would be rather seen as a sort of unwanted burden in the best case scenario , or as the russian `` 5th column '' in the worst . 
  not that the situation is better for those who fled to russia . 
  ironically , the locals often see them as `` damned ukrops '' who get money `` for free '' and gon na `` take our jerbs '' ( insisting that there are any ) . 
  edit : i think that 's exactly why an expression `` may you live in interesting times '' is widely regarded as a curse . 
   if you 've never lived under the horrors of communism , you have no fucking right to talk . 
  are you sure that you meet the conditions ? 
  you sound like a teenager filled with angst . 
  this is so utter bullshit that i do n't even know where to start . 
  i think it 's a wrong place for submitting stuff like this . 
  \\ # 7-8 are looking really nice , i like that military style . 
  in other news : the pepe market is going to boom in the motherland !, 
  captain obvious to the rescue !, 
   not that they 're the only ones , you take it back , mister !, 
  the claims of bulgarians and kebabs are just ridiculous , moscovy third rome is the best third rome in the world and everyone else must bow down to its awesomeness !, 
  when it comes to the lgbt rights in russia , the main concern is related to the ongoing decline in the overall situation and the u-turn made by the government in recent years . 
  [ who knows ? 
  ] ( http://www.talkandroid.com/wallpapers/images/1/1_1216075962777.jpg ) ps : i have to admit that i 'm going full history channel here , so it 's merely wishful thinking . 
  obviously , yes , it 's the most interesting thing ever happened in the us . 
   authorities in russia 's southern city of ** krasnodar ** will be scrutinizing a concert friday by rapper noize mc . 
  i thought they banned everything save for cossack choirs a long ago . 
  what an accent markov has !, 
  a gay marriage and adopting children by homosexual couples are prohibited , a legal civil union is impossible ( not recognized by the law ) , promoting the lgbt values and relationship is punishable by a fine ( relatively small though ) . 
  homosexual relations between men is frowned upon by society , lesbians are mostly not being taken seriously , bisexuals are seen as weirdos and perverts , transsexuals are having problems with recognizing their new identity by officials . 
  life is normal as long as you stay in a closet or your social gay life remains limited to gay clubs and close friends , although that only goes to moscow and spb . 
  so far i do n't have any first-hand experience of the situation in another regions , i would only guess that the gay life is much tougher outside of the big cities . 
  yes , it 's quite accurate . 
  personal things ( like furniture in apartments , a toothbrush , a car that you bought - hope you get an idea ) were in the personal possession . 
  meanwhile , your apartment was not yours in the most cases ( in the late ussr there were so-called `` cooperative build apartments '' , which could be bought , like a property in the western countries ) . 
  on the countryside , that was even more complicated : a commune ( `` kolhoz '' ) , as a separate entity , had its own fields , tools and tractors in the possession , in theory , but , on practice , it could n't be bought or sold without a permission of the upper ( = the party ) management . 
  members of communes had small patches of land available for subsistence farming , but they could n't say `` fuck it '' , sell their land and move somewhere else ( again , without a permission , which was quite difficult to obtain ) . 
  even now , a legal status of dachas ( a small pieces of land with a summer cabin on it ) , which were granted to the people living in towns , remains quite cloudy , because no one knows how to deal with it . 
  for instance , we have a dacha , we can sell it as it is , but we ca n't demolish an old house and build a three-storey brothel on this spot ( or the sauron 's tower ) , because , by the local rules , there are only summer cabins allowed . 
   russians consider their great patriotic war as a thing apart from world war ii , and anyone who suggests otherwise risks getting branded as a falsifier of history . 
  well , it 's a version of history we were being taught in school . 
  after all , who would be interested in knowing something else ? 
  four-eyed historians , all three of them ? 
  if you think my attitude is bad ( and can understand russian ) , check out [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aarsuio_xy0 ) - that 's what * is * bad . 
   more russians have read `` mein kampf '' than , for example , `` the origins of totalitarianism '' by hannah arendt . 
  the author made a straw man argument comparing one of the most known books ever written with an academic study , which was published in russia only once , in 1996 , so now it could be found only in libraries . 
  tl ; dr : the article is merely an opinion . 
   the soviet union had private ownership . 
  no , it had n't . 
  you 're confusing private ownership with [ the right of possession ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/right_of_possession ) . 
  could they also open the old archive of the cia while they 're at it ? 
  i 'm curious about what exactly happened in one town in new mexico . 
  a lot . 
  the import of consumer goods , including meds , groceries , cars & parts , electronics , clothes & shoes etc , shrunk by [ 20-30 % in 2014 ] ( http://daily.rbc.ru/special/economics/04/03/2015/54f041729a7947667810fad7 ) . 
  at this point , i 'd rather say that there 's nothing in particular to be excited about . 
  despite of the efforts of recent years aimed at the strengthening of the religious values in the social life , nobody except for muslims and babushkas gives a flying fuck about religion , however almost everyone loves to talk about `` spirituality '' esp. , after third glass . 
  the hell if i know what they have in mind though . 
  indeed , but in case of greece it will be blown out of proportion by the press . 
  artificial intellect . 
  something tells me that the further it goes , the more stories about the criminal , inhumane nature of greeks will pop up in the news , up to the point of the full dehumanization . 
  [ hold you hat , texas . 
  while you are being dense , thatsjustsowrong is contradicting to his nickname and making a really good point . 
  that is what you 're calling `` russians '' is n't russians in sense of ethnicity in numerous cases . 
  the situation is different than a hundred years ago , when great russians ( literally ! ), 
  were the \u00fcber race of the russian empire , and being of mixed heritage would have been an issue in one 's career . 
  for good or for bad , the soviets have partially reached its goals . 
  personally , i find it amazing that russian became a lingua franca for this country . 
  otherwise i would be speaking a mixture of five languages , two of those is not even indo-european and make no sense at all . 
  the shipyard has reportedly flooded the dock .
