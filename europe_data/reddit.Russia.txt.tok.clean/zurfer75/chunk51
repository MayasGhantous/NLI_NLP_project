  if it is so , his career will not last for long . 
  on a less related note , `` govorit moskva '' is a lair of complete vatniks . 
  if you value your mind , please refrain from listening to the radio station . 
  it 's like a squared version of rt or vesti fm . 
  thousands and thousands of communists and peasants have enjoyed vacations in the hospitable siberian camps . 
  i really do n't know if there was a social group excluded from the scope of repressions . 
   we do n't have an obvious slogan for the rally yet it 's just ridiculous . 
  what is the point that they are going to make with the speechless demonstration ? 
  what 's happened , the moscow police has accidentally lost the database containing protesters ' ids ? 
  even a broken clock is right twice a day . 
  67 % 03:05 i know nothing about balkans . 
  dammit . 
  if i misread your comment then i apologize . 
  i 'm just getting mad reading countless comments of the regime 's apologist and sometimes bark on a wrong tree . 
   considers everybody outside moscow city limits a dog-headed alcoholic if you did n't recognize this as ~ ~ a dank meme ~ ~ sarcasm , it ca n't be helped . 
  - votes for the dearest leader ( again ? ), 
  - wants to make his country a better place ( by voting in for the dearest leader ? ), 
  - implying that the arrogance of muscovites gets him off the right track - blaming others for having a wrong attitude yet another time when i 'm getting convinced that the country 's condition is hopeless . 
  romania was among the axis powers , no wonder they had been seen as a part of the nazi world , i.e. , as deadly enemies . 
  therefore , germans were killing & raping civilians within the borders of the ussr , soviets was doing the same shit outside the ussr , which lead us to the bitter conclusion that people who had early fled to both americas were the smartest asses and we , in europe , are nothing but descendants of short sighted peasants : /, 
  germany was n't `` less-rapey '' and actually was much more brutal in their actions when it came down to eastern slavic untermensch . 
  the myth about `` civilized wehrmacht soldiers '' goes from the cold war , general western bigotry toward russians and decades spent in the worker 's paradise created by the ussr in eastern europe . 
  for instance , balts were less inferior to the master race thus they lived fine through the nazi times ; latvian part of my family was always pretty clear in that regard . 
  on a day after the split , siberia will be annexed and ethnically cleansed by china , i 'm kinda sure that siberians are pretty aware of this perspective . 
  it gets us to a starting point . 
  boys do n't like me because i have acne , or i get pimples all over my face because i ca n't get laid . 
  this situation is unlikely to improve unless people take responsibility for their choices . 
  i may sound as arrogant cunt but it was n't moscow who robbed the regions blind and turned the rest of the country into a shithole . 
  people do that , when they resort to drinking in the morning instead of getting skills they need to thrive . 
  poor fuckers from central russia and siberia made their bed and now they lie in it . 
  if their choice was voting the same guys into the office again and again then i could n't care less when they become even poorer . 
  if anything , moscow was the only city where our dearest leader got less than 50 % of votes in the last elections . 
  also , i do n't see any protests in the regions - so , does it mean that they 're happy ? 
  fuck them then . 
  why i 'm not surprised with him being a fellow muscovite . 
  it is no wonder we are so hated by the rest of the country . 
  depends on what you mean by `` luxury '' . 
  if that includes meat , fish , chicken , sausages , ham , quality canned food and groceries - then yes , they needed connections to buy it . 
  ninja edit : also , there was another opportunity to get your fridge filled - standing in queues for hours . 
  they managed to get food through good connections . 
  i wonder is there any chance for him to obtain political asylum in the us ? 
  ddr served as sort of a showcase of what the communists had to offer to the rest of the world . 
  people tend to forget that the ussr was n't only about the brutal dominance as a self-sufficient goal but also it was trying to spread its ideology across the planet . 
  shipping maybe , but it does n't mean that the stuff might be found on shelves in shops back then . 
  all the nice ( and cheap ) stuff was immediately being bought by the dog-headed people from the outskirts of moscow . 
  a joke from those times . 
  `` what is long , green all over and smells like salami ? 
  it 's the friday train from moscow to ryazan ' . '', 
  more like [ this ] ( http://povareshkino.ru/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/holodec.jpg ) . 
  i remember that time very well . 
  neither of these cities were `` well fed '' . 
  how my family was obtaining food is a different matter . 
  apparently it is . 
  meat jelly with horseradish sauce . 
  i 've read somewhere that there are several travel agencies ( at least in moscow ) offering tours to the best korea on a regular basis . 
  not sure whether it 's safe for capitalistic pigs from the west or not . 
  had they only made the website less hipster-ish it would be taken more seriously . 
  the moon rock is a part of the permanent exhibition , so it must be displayed to the public . 
  moscow was n't an exception . 
  if anything , most warshaw pact and baltic countries were better than moscow and spb in regard of the availability of food . 
  the situation in romania was different as far as i know . 
  north-west of russia was sparsely populated in those times . 
  nowhere near to medieval europe or asia minor . 
  happy easter , europe !, 
  a tiny fraction of the minuscule community of moscow catholics virtually joins the party !,
