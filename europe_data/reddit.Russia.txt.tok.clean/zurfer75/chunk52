  there 's still plenty of snow outside . 
  my deepest sympathy goes out to you poles . 
  hopefully , one day you 'll forgive us . 
  well put , i subscribe entirely to that . 
  drinking water will be the new oil . 
  `` repossessed and given '' my ass , it 's called `` robbery '' . 
  once in a blue moon , lol . 
  not sure what you mean by `` reverse '' . 
  granted , notable members of the communist party and close relatives of high-ranked officials had obvious privileges coming along with the status , as well as access to better education and medical treatment , but saying that the rest of society was excluded from the educational process is a far fetched generalization . 
  your statement is as wrong as it possibly could be . 
  it 's worth mentioning that `` boltai '' is n't a hacker group in the `` geek '' sense of the word . 
  following the `` behest '' of mitnick , they also use a variety of other methods of gathering the info , such as social engineering , internal tensions on the `` victim '' side and probably buying / bribing officials . 
  moreover , in the interview to meduza , their leader pointed out that these political leaks are the byproducts of the commercial activity . 
  that would mean that they 're not just `` hackers '' but also active `` players '' in this murky field . 
  so , take it with a grain of salt . 
  on the other hand , doctoring evidences of the affairs between european marginals and our local propagandists is n't really worth bothering with . 
  `` demonizing '' is a quite mild word for that what is happening . 
  i was listening to vesti fm today . 
  those folks , who were calling in to the radio show , were pretty straight about the way the opposition should be treated . 
  according to my fellow countrymen , the stripping of citizenship is the least severe measure that should be applied to anyone , who dares to cast any doubt upon the leader or criticize the government policies . 
  basically , having a disagreement of any kind means that you are the enemy of the state . 
  i could n't have imagined such vitriolic hatred a couple years ago . 
   his jacket and bike were found at the albert canal in hasselt . 
  does that evidence suggest he drowned himself ? 
  it may be used as a substitute for a civil passport , in some cases . 
   hope you will store it well that 's my duty , as a male citizen , to keep it carefully . 
  e.g. , it 's still required for applying to some jobs . 
   eu should start a crack-down on everything russian implying that is n't happening right now ? 
  it 's war , though ideological yet . 
   hope it stays this way .

  yeah , `` the religion of peace '' , `` moderate muslims '' , `` we should be respectful of any cultural values [ including barbaric ones ] '' - i 'm fed up with that bullshit . 
  just because it works somewhere else does n't mean it will work here . 
  during tough times , muslim minorities in russia always resort to religious extremism . 
  not that i 'm justifying the authorities ' actions , neither i 'm blaming our muslims themselves for being simple-minded - the point is that our government , in its current state , ca n't handle with them . 
  officials simply do n't know how to deal with the religious diversity , therefore , given the chance , they try to shut down everything they can reach . 
  a lesser evil . 
  and nobody bats an eye . 
  given that crimean `` tatars '' were bffs with chechens and have strong ties with turkey , there 's no reason to become upset about the fate of another source of the ~ ~ yada yada juhad juhad ~ ~ islamic propaganda . 
  no , i was n't sarcastic , i really had no idea about the belssr and ukrssr membership in the un . 
  just fyi , donkey piss is an easy substitute for '' \u0411\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 '' . 
   stalin created ficticious countries to earn more vote at the unated nations til that the soviet republics had their own seats in the un . 
  [ alexander vertinsky - `` that 's what i have to say ( in memory of junkers ) '' ] ( http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1subwcqob5g ) and the [ boris grebenschikov 's cover ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yplajylfmia ) of this touching song . 
  a quote from the yt description :  `` the one , i should say '' is aleksandr vertinsky 's romance , which was written at the end of 1917 . 
  it 's considered to be one of the most well-known russian antiwar song . 
  vertinsky wrote it soon after the october revolution . 
  at the end of 1917 lyrics was published by moscow `` modern news '' . 
  it was commented that it was dedicated to `` their blessed memory ''  in fact it 's dedicated to junkers , dead in moscow during the october revolution of 1917 and buried in moscow fraternal cemetery . 
  vertinsky wrote himself about it in his memoirs : `` soon after the october 's events i wrote `` the one i should say '' . 
  it was written under the impression of burial of junkers dea\u0432 \u0448\u0442 moscow '' . 
   apropos this song , full of empathy to bolsheviki 's enemies , vertinsky was also called to investigation committee for giving his explanations . 
  according to the legend he said then : `` it 's just a song , and anyway you can not forbid me to spare them ! '' and he was replied : `` if it would be necessary , we 'll forbid you to breath ! '', 
  if russia had no nukes , the us and allies would have invaded as early as in the 60s . 
  in terms of history such a selective memory makes a lot of sense . 
  first off , poles got their asses whooped by the uprising of a city 's poor , which is shameful for any army . 
  second : prior to invasion , poles and lithuanians were not seen as deadly enemies in the public eye . 
  in history books , the sentence '' \u0441\u0431\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0443 '' ( '' [ someone ] fled to lithuania '' ) occurs frequently , in regards of any kind of opposition to the moscow principality ( see : the long term correspondence between andrew kurbsky and ivan iv the terrible ) . 
  however , the attitude towards the western neighbours was drastically changed and remained consistently negative through the centuries . 
  furthermore , there were numerous wars which have partially led to the fall of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  so far what 's happened is the imports were cut off . 
  no more cars , electronics , branded clothes and quality food . 
  improving of the domestic production does n't even get started . 
  there must be a political decision beforehand , which we still await . 
  i think that the pose that candidates are doing speaks for itself , hehehe . 
  a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, 
  [ dutch disease ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_disease ) in a nutshell . 
  nevertheless , there is also hope that trying to mitigate a negative impact on the economy , our government may eventually come to the conclusion that diversifying domestic economy really comes in handy when the times get rough . 
  while i wholeheartedly agree with your comment , i ca n't help but mention that this is rich coming from an ukrainian , haha . 
  i have no stake in problems of ukraine and , as a compassionate man , i wish your country to find its way to europe ( at least , it seems you guys are on the right track ) but ... in the same time , i 'm afraid that europe would eventually realize something about ukraine . 
  something that i , as many others , always knew . 
  hopefully , a little later on , it will turn out that i was wrong . 
  illarionov once said that the launcher unit was operating under direct control of the rostov base and hence , according to him , it was a ( failed ? ), 
  false flag black op . 
  however , such an interpretation leaves a lot to be desired : - what was the purpose in towing a single , barely operating unit up and down the border , increasing the risk of getting jammed during the connection ? 
  take the whole missile * system * , with a radar and shit , drive into ukr , make a pew-pew and drive back to rus - what would be a more obvious way to perform the task ? 
  - what the hell is with with all that bragging online and leaked phone calls ? 
  since then having a twitter account is even allowed in the army ? 
  encrypted comms are not a thing anymore ? 
  i have a scary feeling that the entire story may turn out to be a result of general mental retardation taking place in the army . 
  i just do n't want to believe in this , having in mind all these nukes etc. 
  what the hell is this ? 
  if you never heard of blaming muslims that would only mean that you never lived in the big cities or you are muslim yourself . 
  just an observation . 
  blaming jews is so old-fashioned and soviet-esque . 
  i think that only babushkas are doing that now . 
   muslims , immigrants redundancy ( implying that we are annoyed with non-muslim immigrants , if there are any ) . 
   he did something against oligarchs to show them who the boss is yes , that 's exactly what i had in mind , thank you . 
  that 's what i 've come to understand as a general opinion among the opposition . 
  he limited the circle of persons , involved in the process of decision making , to the narrow inner circle , composed of core members of the military and security establishment . 
  granted , some of them , if not most , are oligarchs as well but that 's not the point . 
  supposedly , it 's happened prior to the annexation of crimea so it 's hard to tell if it was a coincidence or a sort of a plan . 
  do you really believe that every warlord out there gives a damn about the kremlin opinion ?

  what exactly are those displays needed for , short of watching the homonazi gayporn in hd ?

  totally . 
  what about the iconic white toyota trucks ? 
  however i 'm afraid these cars should be baptized in the orthodox way to make them less capitalistic .
