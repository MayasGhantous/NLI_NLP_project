  you can laugh all you want on things you have no clue of but it wo n't change anything . 
  also , fyi , the last `` moskvich '' was produced in 2001 , i.e. , 14 years ago . 
  the oligarchy has no say in that regard . 
  short of global warming , nothing can make siberia more desirable for living . 
  i 've been there a couple of times and my answer is a big fat no . 
  as for the mindset , i would say that russia is much more diversed than monoethnic countries like ukraine or belarus or baltic countries and this fact is finding its reflection in the way of thinking . 
  the western allies are preparing for the upcoming world war . 
  what 's happened to cg artists in europe ? 
  where have they all fled to , the us & canada ? 
  the post-production quality is beyond embarrassing . 
   just move a load of poles , balts and ukranians to anadyr and vladivostok and anschlu\u00df their clay , ftfy third time 's the charm , eh ? 
  hehe . 
   actually moving their population east as well what ? 
  where to ? 
  there is no place to live out there . 
  actually , people are slowly moving from siberia back to the european part , let alone the fact , that almost everyone , save for siberian & muslim republics , have nothing in common with asians , in terms of mindset . 
  given the circumstances at the point , this country , as an uniform entity which we have known , would n't be trusted in the int ' l community again , regardless of a state of affairs in the internal political environment . 
  therefore , the conditions established over the last 100 years will remain unchanged . 
  this conclusion comes from observing of the deep existential crisis of society , which * is * being reflected in the politics , not the other way around . 
   what do you do with rabid dogs ? 
  you put them down . 
   russia should 've been completely destroyed in 1991 hello there , dr. jekyll and mr. 
  hide !, 
  ps : chechens got an independence after the first war . 
  perhaps , you should read something about the beginning of the second one ... 
  i beg to differ . 
  that number is greater than the percentage of the black population in the us ( [ ~ 13 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_united_states#race_and_ethnicity ) ) , way more than the total number of migrants in the eu ( [ ~ 10 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigration_to_europe#statistic_data_on_immigrant_populations ) ) . 
  do you think that these social groups are tiny or irrelevant ? 
  by no means that makes a few percent of the population . 
  dammit . 
  i just pointed out that the opposition section of society is massive , by any means . 
  that is not just a tiny `` minority '' that lives somewhere in the siberian taiga . 
  you 'll never know , beforehand , who is who , when you meet a random guy from russia . 
  if the statistic science is anything to go by , then you 'd have a few normal guys in every football team you see . 
  or , like , one in every 7-seater suv . 
  if a couple of tens of millions is merely `` a few '' for ya , then you should get renamed to `` thechinesedragon '' , mate . 
   who exactly are the ` normal people ' there that should be differentiated from the government 146kk * 15 % = 22kk , that 's several times more than the baltic countries combined . 
  is there anything to read aboit the process of applying for asylum in portugal ? 
  what conditions have to be met ? 
  thank you very much . 
  it 's all in god 's hands . 
  yep , she acquired the citizenship a long time ago . 
  as for the consulate ... 
  i think you 're giving them too much credit , implying that they 're bad at doing their job out of evil intentions . 
  being lazy and incompetent is the normal way of working in the state institutions in russia . 
  however , i can not exclude the possibility that when given the opportunity , some state offices try and fart in general direction of the west . 
  on an unrelated note , i have a bad feeling about the family meeting today . 
  when a half of the family has completely bought into the propaganda and got divided over the mess in ukraine ... * sigh * nothing good can come from this . 
  to be fair , all visa issues have been worked out in this particular case , thanks to jesus . 
  from what i gather , the oil prices will never go back to the $ 100 level in the foreseeable future , therefore you can be relatively calm about the fuel consumption of your car . 
  i , for one , welcome our future overlord !, 
  thank you , capt. 
  igor . 
  here , have this rock . 
  itt : people who do n't realize that our current dearest leader * is * quite liberal , comparing to others . 
  [ the oil price ] ( http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/crude-oil.aspx?timeframe=1m ) , maybe . 
  if only it were possible to make our officials truly care about the rights of the russian-speaking minorities , instead of spouting hot air that carry no weight . 
  for instance , it still remains unclear at this juncture whether my aunt will get to moscow in time to attend to a funeral of her mother or not . 
  the wankers working in the russian consulate in riga are so busy protecting the said rights that they are getting too exhausted to keep their miserable shop open after 3 p.m. even though the case requires an immediate response . 
  i always thought of rusyns as of the way slavic inhabitants of karpaty ( uzhgorod etc ) named themselves , not as about ethnicity . 
  was it a wrong point of view ? 
  the co-founders of `` warner bros '' were born in the russian empire ( now belarus ) . 
  parents of andy warhol moved to the u.s. from slovakia . 
  i recently saw a docu about him . 
  the boy got un/us/nato all mixed up in his head , like a vague representation of `` le ebil west '' . 
  that is not * that * surprising , considering the constantly running propaganda machine and the fact that * the west * never had any good intentions towards russia . 
  not everything , though . 
  [ such lovely faces ] ( https://std3.ru/78/e4/1427233187-78e48cee5494adf1a96d025608dcf6da.jpeg ) . 
   russian state has the advantage over others that it is directly governed by god , ** otherwise it is impossible to explain how it can exist at all ** - the full quote , ftfy given that the quote comes from a german who lived in the 18th century , my guess is that the author was being sarcastic here . 
  not sure if rogozin recognized the irony though ... 
  damn , it 's terrifying to say the least . 
  seems like someone does cleaning in the house . 
  imo , the late ussr was a way less dangerous for citizen dissent of any kind than the modern day russia , which is sad . 
  edit : by the way , it was my grandfather who encouraged me , he bought me a radio receiver and told how to make an external short wave antenna . 
  pretty much true . 
  you 're comparing two vastly different countries here . 
  most people do n't care about a sexual behavior , they just do n't want to look at parading the other 's `` perversion '' . 
  it 's something deeply rooted in the national tradition . 
  it 's quite hard to explain . 
  lgbt activists are acting in ways that they find appropriate , yet they only get punished for that by authorities and frowned upon by the public . 
  it 's not going to get us anywhere . 
  making other people angry is not a strategy at all , it 's only painting the rest of the lgbt community in a bad light and making us look stupid . 
  i 'm a bi , actually . 
  i do n't exactly blame the community , i just think that their way of fighting for the rights does not fit right for this country . 
  when i was a kid , i got used to listening to the radio show of seva novgorodtsev on bbc . 
  the danger of such a hobby is blown out of proportion , though . 
  if anything , riding across the baikal lake during the last week of march seems pretty stupid . 
  i 'm a layman in the 4x4 theme , that 's why it 's only my opinion . 
  our lgbt community must have stop being a copycat of europe . 
  the west practice does n't work here . 
  you 're just repeating my words . 
  yes , moscow , piter , nsk , eburg and vladick are okay , to some extent . 
  the rest of russia ... well , shit . 
  please , do bear in mind that i 'm certainly biased in that regard . 
  in short , the russian society is not ready yet to acceptance of a variety of sexual behaviors . 
  period . 
  it is being called out as a deviance . 
  period . 
  neither putin nor stalin shitted everyone 's pants ; it is something that people do to them themselves . 
  maybe .
