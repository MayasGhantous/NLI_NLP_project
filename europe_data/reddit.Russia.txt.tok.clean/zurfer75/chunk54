  i 'm not doxxing anyone here . 
  he was res-tagged as a `` paid shill '' but actually i do n't care much about things that people would have to do for a living . 
  [ so , 90s !, 
  ] ( http://roxannesilverwood.com/images/2_motion/2013/rs-thats-so-90s-logo.jpg ), 
  it 's brilliant . 
  do you realize that you 're responding to the lgbt person who actually lives in russia ? 
  well let 's consider this my coming out then . 
  i think i have a say in that regard . 
  and in my opinion , the biggest enemy of the lgbt community in russia is the said community itself . 
  the author completely missed the main point . 
  authorities do n't care much about homosexuality , they 're just against any kind of `` unauthorized '' actions and activism in general . 
  had they thought a bit , they would n't have detained people who were holding russian flags or blank sheets of paper in front of kremlin . 
  their position is simple : shut your mouth and go home , peasant . 
   written on sep 12 , 2014 what a slacker you are , donheart . 
  you should n't get paid this week , 
  you are not alone , mate . 
  how do you feel about beer ? 
  given you reside in moscow , ofc . 
  well , the widely discussed ties of lebedev with authorities are n't the news , indeed . 
  we can and we will , give it a time . 
  i 've subscribed . 
  who knows ... 
  artemy lebedev is certainly the most known and commercially successful graphic designer in russia and it is for a reason . 
  i can only envy you . 
  our gift and souvenir shops have been selling roman-style busts of putin for the last decade or even longer . 
  shocking news , indeed . 
  edit : a word . 
   they 'll spend around 75 % of it in 2015 alone i heard they have spent ~ [ 30 % ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/foreign-exchange-reserves ) of currency reserves since the beginning of 2014 . 
  that said , their further moves seem barely predictable at this point . 
  pfff , you put it like as if there were a real chance of returning that money . 
   the younger son of ukraine 's former president viktor yanukovych ** has drowned in lake baikal ** in russia , reports say . 
  the current temperature in the baikal region varies from -5 \u00b0 c at night to +8 in a daytime , so , the water temperature is close to 0 \u00b0 c. 
  who the hell would dare to swim in icy water ? 
  edit : ah , now it 's clear . 
  he did n't find the way back to the surface when the minibus he was driving has fallen through ice . 
  i believe there 's a sort of a theory in which any volatility of markets makes `` premium '' rich players even more rich and poor even more poor , as a matter of fact . 
  now all she has to do is get away with it . 
  hopefully , she wo n't be hunted down by school teachers or something along these lines . 
  a recovery of financial market is fine , who 'd argue with that ? 
  investors , shareholders and other dirty capitalistic pigs could jerk off on that `` recovery '' until their dicks fell off , for all i care . 
  on the other hand , food prices stay high , prices on imported goods are as high as twice the figures a year ago , the dollar price of my apartments dropped by 40 % ... while salaries remain the same . 
  was this crimean shithole worth it ? 
  i doubt that . 
  it 's a vivid illustration of the so-called `` siege mentality '' . 
  reminds me of the stories , that russian newspapers were publishing during wwi , in which almost every incident , be it a mysterious loss of cattle or a widespread outbreak of diarrhea , was all blamed to `` foreign agents '' or `` kaiser 's spies '' without a second thought . 
  was it a rosskie submarine vessel ? 
  this is very much possible considering that russia officially restores a submarine patrolling on the global scale this year , for the first time since the end of the previous cold war . 
  or , perhaps , those scots accidentally scratched their boat on reefs and made up this story out of whole cloth . 
  we all know that fishermen are the most honest people on the planet , who were never caught on stretching the truth , amiright ?

  the location matters . 
  also , the energy is not free of charge . 
  look at what [ happened ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-a0c4856e-1019-4937-96fd-8714d70a48f7 ) to the aral sea - once the sea , it is now a desert . 
  does n't make much sense , imo . 
  fresh water will be oil of the 21th century . 
  saint petersburg is more akin to moria ( was also known as khazad-d\u00fbm a.k.a. 
  leningrad in the soviet times ) , a once great and beautiful capital city now fallen into decay , haunted by ghosts of the past , inhabited by modern day orcs . 
  moscow is obviously minas morgul , a home of lich kings , their guards , escort and people , also inhabited by orcs and undead of all kinds , including soviet fanboys - zombies . 
  barad-d\u00fbr could be placed , metaphorically speaking , within the walls of kremlin . 
  although , imo , it 's a poor comparison which gives ~ ~ the bastards ~ ~ our prominent leaders too much credit . 
  i 'd rather see the sauron 's tower being placed in weak people 's minds , as a venomous essence of imperialistic views of the backward section of society and elites . 
  regardless of the current russia 's policies , saudi arabia is your key ally , not ours . 
  perhaps , you should stop tolerating thier medieval attitude toward women and use your influence to guide these religious nutjobs to the right direction , instead of asslicking and giving a hug to their leaders . 
  this book meets my need for aesthetic satisfaction , i just like the narrative style of the 18-19th centuries .

  not sure about racism , but it often happens in public places when an old ~ ~ cunt ~ ~ lady starts shouting at younger guy who dares sitting in front of her , even though she had no intention of sitting herself . 
  needless to say , the presence of any black person is not necessary to let it happen . 
  on a day when our glorious leader appeared back in public , i 've pointed out how important those news stories ( a fb post by volkov and that interfax article ) were for understanding the situation . 
  reddit kiddos barely noticed it . 
  now it 's a story on rferl.org - crickets . 
  it seems that circlejerk around non-news is much more funny .
