  perhaps , my language skill is too low to tell the difference . 
  haha , the mercator projection always makes big scary russia even more big and scary , not to mention greenland . 
  is it true that local branches of euronews have their own bias ? 
  i thought they were supposed to make accurate translations . 
  i could try and compare a local channel broadcasting in moscow with the online int ' l version , if anyone interested . 
  edit : well , i watched both channels ( a russian version on tv and an english one in the internet ) simultaneously , for a half an hour . 
  the result was somehow predictable : the same news stories , in the same order , edited in the same way , including poroshenko with erdogan , russian military drills , nato military drills et al. 
  translations seem accurate , imo . 
  the timelines is a bit ( ~ 1m ) out of sync , perhaps because of different lengths of commercials played out . 
  the only difference i found was in the `` no comments '' section . 
  two different scenes were filmed in india , however , i 've totally missed the point both times . 
  shocking news : a professional looking cg was made by a skilled motion designer who was paid for his work . 
  from what i see around here , the level of obsession with inane ideas of the `` russian world '' is inversely proportional to the professional qualities and intelligence level of a person . 
  customers and creators of propaganda , on the other hand , are n't bound to any particular ideas , except for getting money , and usually have a very cynical attitude toward their job . 
  during the last presidential campaign of the yeltsin 's times , i worked for a company which was making the promotional materials ( tv ads & other garbage ) for almost all candidates , regardless of their political alignment . 
  there were a lot of awkward moments when our managers had to rule out the possibility of an impromptu meeting of the `` deadly '' political enemies at our place , haha . 
  i do n't really see how it could be a * russian * propaganda ? 
  eutimes.net , whatdoesitmean.com , what the hell is this ? 
  aggressive stance is being stirred up by the government . 
  they have intentionally pushed people into supporting their imperialistic ideas . 
  i would n't draw any far-reaching conclusions about the willing of the nation . 
  ultima online and wow, 
  this and maybe also the porous borders in the south and east put its share to general mistrust . 
  the west is essentially bad at meddling in other countries ' internal affairs , every time they try they only make things even more worse . 
  so , no . 
  it 's unlikely that overthrowing the regime could be a positive measure , neither then nor now . 
  i was more thinking of implementing a reasonable strategy , which would keep the russian regime in check , like giving it a sense of reality about the presence of the rest of ther world around russia . 
  it 's was much more possible in 2008 or 2012 than now , although i would n't bet my money on the western success either . 
  did i get it right that passengers were hunted down by dogs , being held at a gunpoint and literally raped by the lithuanian homo nazis ? 
  in general , participants of pro-government rallies could be divided into the categories - those who had come willingly ; state workers who had to attend ( or they came in exchange for a future day off ) and those who were paid for coming to the rally . 
  this time , the rally 's coordinators handed out coupons for the jewelry store before the rally and participants could exchange it for money at the meeting point after the rally ending . 
  [ the letter of the law vs. the spirit of the law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/letter_and_spirit_of_the_law ) our dearest leader has abused the constitution in 2008 , when he installed a puppet and did remain in power instead of stepping down . 
  later , in 2012 , it then became clear for everyone else . 
  saying that `` every nation deserves its rulers '' is thin ice . 
  that 's like saying : `` hey , that woman deserves to get beaten daily because muh what did she think of when she married him ? '', 
  recently , i was giving a lift to one guy , apparently of north caucasus origin , and we were chatting a bit about cars and stuff . 
  and then he said something like : `` granted , * germans are fascists * but they are the best car makers ever . '', 
  he put it in a way of giving an excuse for his fascination with german cars ( or , perhaps , as a matter of fact ) . 
  o_o mfw i heard it . 
  a couple of years ago , i would have thought : `` wow , what a dumb asshole ! '' . 
  in regards to the present day mood , i do n't even know what to think . 
  they keep their propaganda running 24/7 , people keep falling into this . 
  does it mean that all the russians got stupid/evil overnight ? 
  i do n't think so , there must be other explanation . 
  edit : a lil bit of grammar . 
  correlating with the dearest leader 's third term . 
  the west gave him a favor , when they turned a blind eye to the mass protest against the anti-constitutional matter of restoring him in power . 
  now you reap what you sow , stupid greedy suckers . 
  could you please watch your mouth . 
  where does that come from , am i supposed to support our dearest leader & his suicidal actions no matter what ? 
  would you care to provide a source for your claim ? 
  fyi , the true nationalist movement has nothing in common with that scum . 
  some of them were paid for taking a part in the rally , some - merely state workers who were ordered to attend the event . 
  put away your wide brush . 
  you got me confused now . 
  have you just compared russia to aq ? 
  i do n't even know what to say . 
  thank you , i appreciate your help !, 
  there is a general lack of information about the processes of applying for asylum and the rest of issues involved . 
   only 24 hours news channel in russia actually , no , there are other 24h news channels as well ( including euronews and russia 24 ) . 
  rbc ( \u0420\u0411\u041a ) is the premier source of business and finance news in russia . 
  a bunch of clowns shouting stupid things gets you guys talking about the big and scary war ? 
  if russia did not exist , it should be invented , haha , just for entertainment purposes . 
  show a little mercy : many of them had to stand out there for hours , with no way to rest the legs , in order to earn a bit amount of cash ( ~ 5.5 euros ) :d [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://std3.ru/78/68/1426710001-7868d9349c8dadfc4465e28a5300528d.jpg ) , [ [ 2 ] ] ( https://std3.ru/8a/dd/1426710003-8added9e0893bced75d1fe6f1d22acc1.jpg ) , [ [ 3 ] ] ( https://std3.ru/bc/10/1426710005-bc102dda215e33b0a0aef3dafdbd5f53.jpg ) .

  does poland accept political refugees or asylum seekers represent an oppressed minority in other countries ? 
  can someone tell where to read about it ? 
  call me a heartless bastard but i laughed so hard watching this !, 
  i do n't get why does it have to be a parade exactly ? 
  why do they not choose to hand out some food to the ww2 vets who are still around ? 
  is it dangerous to look at the solar eclipse directly ? 
  had no idea though . 
  so , spaniards are similar to my great grandma , who passed away at the age of ( apparently ) 105 , lived through two revolutions , two world wars and two political systems , whilst residing at the very same apartments ; who have never had a job because meh that 's the men 's only duty ; who thought that a daily 50ml shot of vodka is a cure for every disease and a cigarette is for calming down and , finally , * who has never given a fucking damn about anything * ? 
  am i right in here ? 
  i 'm really having a hard time recalling an instance , in which ultras and aks both were involved . 
  either baseball bats or knives - yep , such a shit happens all the time . 
  `` geomagnetic activity is still high , meaning aurora borealis could be seen anywhere north of [ red line on map ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cauvcmywqamwipw.png ) this eve . '', 
  [ a gallery of tweets : northern lights over central russia - meduza.io ] ( https://meduza.io/shapito/2015/03/17/zhiteli-sredney-polosy-rossii-uvideli-severnoe-siyanie ), 
  that means that a huge geomagnetic storm is happening . 
  [ here 's another graph ] ( http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/research/organizational-units/departments/department-2/earths-magnetic-field/services/kp-index/quicklook/ ) . 
  well , they just have to manage the power grid properly . 
  the article seems unnecessarily sensational to say the least . 
  the total phase of a solar eclipse is quite brief ( a few minutes ) , so the answer is nothing . 
  my guess is that is the result of the ongoing solar storm : [ rare ` severe ' geomagnetic storm is hitting earth right now ] ( http://mashable.com/2015/03/17/rare-severe-geomagnetic-storm-sun/ ) .

  studying `` marxism-leninism '' was mandatory , it 's right , but it never ended up taking a half of a day , unless it was the main subject of study at a few faculties in some universities . 
  sadly , i always thought of finns as one of the better nations in europe . 
  your words got me unpleasantly surprised . 
  nevermind . 
  they 'll eventually bugger off , back to the stinky swamp of saint-petersburg and my beloved hometown will be fine again , as it meant to be . 
  yeah , i 've just laughed my ass off . 
  how about no ? 
  apparently , this picture was taken from the [ kotelnicheskaya embankment building ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/kotelnicheskaya_embankment_building ) , a quite popular [ place ] ( http://lastdjedai.livejournal.com/95505.html ) among photographers . 
  my guess it was a roleplay on the background of the cold war or something like that . 
  poland can not into having fun . 
   did those guys actually do it ?
