  does n't matter , but it 's hard to believe it was their own idea . 
   also why would the fsb go after kadyrov . 
  the rivalry is the main reason . 
  chechens seem dangerously competitive and eager to advance their influence over local business , which is now paying ( and sometimes belongs ) to curators from the shadow gov ' t structures . 
   a chechen mother color me surprised !, 
  does n't matter who the fuck they are . 
  it turned out that they did it by their own decision . 
  no ` big names ' were involved , nothing of value was lost , the opposition shits bricks . 
  end of story . 
  [ volkov 's written about that today ] ( https://www.facebook.com/leonid.m.volkov/posts/880783811944253 ) . 
  [ another breaking news today ] ( http://www.interfax.ru/russia/430152 ) : the state investigators ruled to re-qualify the charges against a group of chechens who were accused in the killing of nemtsov . 
  according to the new version , it was * not a contract killing * but a murder committed out of * religious or ethnic hate * . 
  the change in accusation means that a person who ordered nemstov will escape the criminal charges , because said person does not exist for the court . 
  apparently , the russian security services tried to use the killing of nemtsov against kadyrov ( and his private army ) . 
  seems like both sides ca n't get along with each other anymore * and * it seems that putin took the side of chechens in this conflict . 
  so , our dearest leader has finally chosen chechens over fsb ? 
  it 's become clear why ksenia sobchak fled from the country . 
  eh , it was n't my point ... she is not `` just a pretty girl '' or `` merely a journalist '' . 
  the fact that she does n't feel safe raises the question about the ability of the regime to protect their inner circle from getting hurt . 
  it 's actually a much more important sign for those who are being in touch with the russian political scene . 
  pretty much reliable , i think . 
  would n't it be more logical if those paid shills would be targeting the comment sections of major news websites or , at least , / r/worldnews ? 
  [ the fire was liquidated ] ( http://www.echo.msk.ru/news/1512040-echo.html ) , only minor damage was reported at this time . 
  [ the restoration works were stopped ] ( http://www.echo.msk.ru/news/1512038-echo.html ) 12 hours hours before the fire started . 
  as the contractor 's representative said , workers have lately been renovating the golden plating on the tower 's dome ^ ^ oh ^ ^ wow .

  [ that 's how the tower looked before . 
  i found it funny : slava rabinovich [ put it in a way ] ( https://www.facebook.com/slava.rabinovich.9/posts/846262642101718 ) that our dearest leader was actually framed by officials . 
  on the pretext of the upcoming celebration of the annexation of crimea , he was thus forced to testify against himself on a camera and has given direct evidence to the hague war court with his own hand . 
  however , rabinovich is just a blogger , so i 'm not sure if ~ ~ he speaks out of his jewish ass of a russophobe ~ ~ it 's merely a wishful thinking . 
  well , 5 meters away when i was driving along kremlevskaya embankment and about a couple hundred meters away when i rode down mokhovaya street . 
   putin is still extremely popular his rating entirely based on the media noise . 
  no one is constantly seen around , instead of him . 
  it does n't mean that angry mob will grab pitchforks and go out on the streets defending their beloved leader . 
  a vast majority would n't give a damn about a person on the throne , had he been presented in a proper way . 
  thanks , i saved it for a future use . 
  it says a lot about the general confusion inside the gov ' t apparatus . 
  thank you for the compliment !, 
  i just realized i may have something in common with winston . 
  we 're the same age , both love gin , smoke too much and have a thing about younger girls who like breaking the rules . 
  also , both had been working in the `` ministry of truth '' for a long time before eventually came to the thought that not every way of earning money could make you feel good . 
  on the other hand , it 's possible that such a type of behavior is associated with a certain type of mental disorder , haha . 
  [ you tell me !, 
  c'mon , it 's not a gay-ish thing , so it should be legal , hehe . 
  personally , i do n't see any reason to be worried about . 
  the source of institutional problems in russia lies much deeper than personality of the president . 
  at very least , i 'm going to stay calm unless a horde of armed chechens starts breaking through my front door ... 
  hell if i know . 
  something is going on around here that no one can figure out . 
  seems entirely plausible to me , those pesky mexicans poke their nose everywhere . 
  a ) the president 's [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/putinrf/ ) has not been updated since march , 8 . b ) journalists [ wo n't be appointed ] ( https://twitter.com/adagamov/status/577050481845002240 ) at the putin 's meeting with the president of kyrgyzstan , which was scheduled for tomorrow . 
  i took a ride around the central part of moscow today , just for fun , thanks to sunny weather , low traffic and the good music on megapolis fm . 
  have n't seen anything unusual , neither helicopters nor tanks . 
  what the hell are you guys talking about here ? 
  not yet . 
  only a `` canned footage '' is being presented so far . 
  for unknown reason , that song reminded me of [ '' \u0412\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0434 \u0418\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0412\u0430\u0445\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0430 \u041a\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0434\u0437\u0435 - ' \u0416\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0442\u0443\u043b ' '' ] ( https://myzuka.org/song/3805760/%d0%92%d0%be%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%bf%d0%b0%d0%b4-%d0%98%d0%bc%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8-%d0%92%d0%b0%d1%85%d1%82%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b3%d0%b0-%d0%9a%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%b1%d0%b8%d0%b4%d0%b7%d0%b5-%d0%92%d0%b5%d1%87%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b8-%d0%9a%d0%b0%d0%b8%d1%84-%d0%96%d0%b8%d0%b4%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%b8-%d0%a1%d1%82%d1%83%d0%bb ), 
  no , it 's not a joke . 
  the president has been missing for a while . 
  there 's no flu in moscow . 
  weather is fine , the sun is shining . 
  meanwhile , in the local news ... [ `` mr zaur dadaev , speak up louder ! '', 
  - forbes.ru ] ( http://www.forbes.ru/mneniya-column/vertikal/282331-zaur-dadaev-govorite-gromche ) after the death of nemtsov , various groups of security forces are going to take the kremlin as hostage . 
  * `` an ex-member of the government said that using the liberals as the cause of the third chechen war while losing the second war in ukraine is a very smart and sneaky decision . 
  '' * ... and videos : [ [ muscovites talking about `` lost '' putin ] ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acqh9parof0 ) [ [ geidar jemal : `` putin was neutralized by the special forces ( siloviki ) '' ] ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twxwe1jvmle&amp;t=190 ), 
  seems like it already happened . 
  it has nothing to do with the banner content . 
  even holding a national flag or a blank sheet of paper could get you arrested . 
  it 's about any kind of activism , they want everyone to shut up and make us sit quietly at home . 
  straight from your root comment , which i answered :  russia has killed way more people in ukraine than slaves dying in qatar . 
  ^ over there , you 're taking that numbers ** in terms of common sense ** , implying that russia is inarguably responsible for the total death toll as a matter of course , although you do n't know exactly how many deaths were directly caused by the russian army . 
  fair enough , i was okay with that ...  russia also has more slaves than qatar , plus racism . 
  ^ ... aaand you lost me right there . 
  this time you 're taking things ** literally ** , talking of absolute numbers , thereby the second part of the sentence contradicts with the first part . 
  tl ; dr : you ca n't have a cake and eat it too . 
  what 's your point ? 
  for instance , in absolute numbers china has several times more slaves than russia ( let alone their infamous racism ) , this fact did not stop the int ' l community from having the olympic games out there in 2008 . 
  i do n't deny the problem with slavery ( neither with racism ) , but you 're now shitting on russia just like that . 
  also , a number per capita was invented for a reason . 
  did you seriously compare ~ ~ a spit in the middle of nowhere ~ ~ some minuscule desert country with russia and jumped into conclusions about that ? 
  for god 's sake , please , take it away from us , for whatever reason . 
  it 's doubtful that russia can afford the world cup in its current financial state . 
   russia also has more slaves than qatar could you please refrain from spreading bullshit ? 
  qatar ranked # 4 in the global slavery index , while russia ranked # 32 , according to [ the report ] ( http://www.globalslaveryindex.org/findings/ ) . 
  huh , the tv channel [ russia 24 reported ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3t-aw-musy ) that he ** had ** a meeting with the president of kyrgyzstan on ** 16 mar 2015 ** .

  text bubbles say `` where is he ? 
  '' , `` where did he go ? '', 
  it 's quite hard to make a movie w/o financial support , except for comedies or action movies . 
  it was my pleasure to help . 
  ## the conspiracy of generals ? 
  perhaps , these days will be known as `` the conspiracy of generals '' among historians . 
  on the one side we see a lieutenant colonel , on the other - a group of generals : two colonel generals and three generals of the army . 
  by now , after two weeks of the undercover battle , a view of the battlefield , revealed to the public yesterday , leaves little doubt as to the outcome . 
  the party of `` blood and money '' ( in the terminology of a. piontkovsky ) suffered heavy losses and had to retreat from all fronts , being crushed under the onslaught of the party of `` big blood '' . 
  - s. ivanov , who was absent since feb 27 , suddenly appeared in the public eye , allegedly secured an alliance with the russian orthodox church , or , at least , tried to safeguard the neutral position of the clergy . 
  [ [ link ] ] ( http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/4011507.html ) - nikolai patrushev accepted the surrender of ramzan kadyrov at the security council meeting in pyatigorsk . 
  [ [ link ] ] ( http://russian.rt.com/article/78994 ) - k.remchukov , sitting in a lodge of the bolshoy theatre , announced the upcoming resignation of igor sechin . 
  [ [ link ] ] ( http://www.echo.msk.ru/blog/echomsk/1509574-echo/ ) - apparently , the resignation of v.kolokoltsev seems inevitable , despite the latest rebuttal . 
  [ [ link ] ] ( http://www.newsru.com/russia/04mar2015/kolokoltsev.html ) in contrast to the appearance of ivanov , v. putin has `` disappeared '' .
