  the cancelled visit to kazakhstan and the rumors about his `` illness '' that is being thrown at the public - all these events make us wonder about where he is and in what condition . 
  if the analysis above is correct , then we should expect the resignation of prime minister dmitry medvedev and the appointment of sergei ivanov to this position within a few days . 
  the state duma led by naryshkin will guarantee the `` correct '' voting results . 
  later , the russian public will be informed about that the national leader deserves to have a rest . 
  anyone , who thinks that only generals or security forces are involved in the conspiracy , slightly simplifies the situation . 
  the popular blogger , another candidate on the role of `` the sacred victim '' , who published secret leaks against the party of `` blood and money '' , which were provided by the party of `` big blood '' , was kept in a safe place during the assassination of boris nemtsov . 
  a few days ago , another prominent opposition journalist assumed that [ `` after the murder of nemtsov , putin will be overthrown very soon . 
  '' ] ( http://joinfo.ua/politic/1075077_prezident-putin-ubiystva-nemtsova-svergnut.html ) to the readers , who mistakenly believe that the author of these lines has a sympathy for any of the parties involved in this mortal combat : i would remind you of the phrase : `` a plague on both your houses . '', 
  however , the following historical analogies inevitably come to mind : - the corrupt regime of the shah [ reza pahlavi ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reza_pahlavi ) with the [ savak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/savak ) secret service which was overthrown and replaced with the regime of ayatollah with the islamic revolutionary guards corps ; - the corrupt regime of chiang kai-shek with the secret police and punitive expeditions against communists , which was overthrown and replaced with the maoist regime without the kuomintang secret service but it brought a reign of terror to china nonetheless .

  edit : added the last part of the article . 
  you did n't get me . 
  i 'm not implying that poroshenko or someone else ordered his death . 
  even though it really was a suicide , it is still a bad sign . 
  the witch hunting of pro-anything officials , especially former ones , is not normal to any democracy , even though it may seem as a necessary measure for `` cleansing '' of the political environment in ukraine . 
  the helicopter landed near the building of the ministry of defence , on frunzenskaya embankment . 
  do you even can into moscow ? 
  huh , poroshenko borrowed a book from the moscow library ? 
  how mature of him . 
  in 1989 there were 293k ( 23.1 % of the population ) of russians in the chechen republic . 
  [ 9 ] in july , 1999 , there were 29k of russians who lived in chechnya . 
  you 'll be surprised then . 
  neither me nor my ancestors shipped shit from anywhere to somewhere . 
  stalin was really good at of butchering some of mine as well , by the way . 
  get fucking real , it happened 30 years before i was born . 
  neither i told about russians specifically , learn to read , man . 
  i 've said that i do n't want to dig that pile of crap up . 
  and i already made an apology . 
  what the hell do you want from me ? 
  like my grandma said : `` a poor do n't deserve a servant '' , use google . 
  i ca n't help giggling when i see someone who take the #ridiculous seriously . 
  time has changed since the fall of the ussr . 
  do you want me to do a research ? 
  usually , i try to be helpful but not in this case . 
  first off : you wo n't believe me anyway . 
  second : it 's too much personal for me to talk about . 
  my deep apologies . 
  i think that you 're too young to remember those times . 
  or , simply too stupid to believe that chechens did see the difference between russians and ukrainians back then . 
  i specially wrote `` the non-chechen population '' , seemed like it did n't help . 
  a weak personality and a lack of desire to get better . 
  it was n't solely a response to the chechen separatism . 
  it was also a kind of punishment for the massacre of the non-chechen population . 
  i do n't remember actual numbers but it was like 250k of non-chechen settlers before the fall of the ussr and about 20k left a few years later . 
  not all of them got an opportunity to flee away ... alive or non raped . 
  could n't agree more . 
  i read this book about twenty years ago and still somewhat remember the plot . 
  - a wide-spread civil war in the country with nuclear weapons - ( tens of ) millions of refugees flooding into europe - non-institutional paramilitary groups , involved in border conflicts with neighbouring countries - various groups involved in cross-border smuggling of drugs and firearms , including heavy ones , and possible arising of human trafficking in both directions . 
  just off the top of my head . 
  had he read this , he 'd be salivating like a dog , though . 
  in all honesty , an attitude towards the west is the last thing to worry about in this case ...

  funny that you said that . 
  plot twist : ukrainians started the war with afghanistan , because the leader of the ussr was an ukrainian !,

  why have you singled russia out ? 
  is n't the number per 100k supposed to be the same as anywhere else ? 
  yep , we already have such a halfwit : [ russian tourist fined $ 24,000 for colosseum graffiti ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2014/11/24/travel/italy-colosseum-graffiti/ ) . 
  speaking of developed countries , i 'd rather agree with your friends . 
  on the other hand , we have japan ... go figure . 
  gates , brin ? 
  we 're talking about russia , are n't we ? 
  we have little to no independent businessmen here . 
  also , i never implied that there was 40 % women among the oligarchy , i merely told about ordinary bosses / managers / executives . 
  perhaps , every oppressed minority struggles for its share of the public attention ? 
  to be honest , i find it quite stupid , not to mention that such a tactic is openly sexist . 
  do you realize that corruption is the only way to make billions in russia ? 
  we do n't have rich dynasties here , for the obvious reasons . 
  it 's not clear who was a real businessman in that couple . 
  good luck with getting away with a sexual crime against women or children , committed in russia . 
  given a choice , i 'd rather be punished for a murder . 
  domestic violence , on the other hand , is a big problem . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yelena_baturina the billionaire club in russia has less than a hundred members . 
  looking for a trend does n't make any sense in the case . 
  i beg to differ . 
  a lead accountant is one of the three positions which is necessary to run a company . 
  a person in this position bears the full responsibility for any financial decision and can be charged in criminal court . 
  what is it if not a boss ?
