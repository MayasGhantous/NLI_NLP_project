  think of it as of a top manager in charge of the financial department . 
   unambitious obedient puppets of some bigger fish above them if you take a big company , say , the russian railroads , there are * always * a few bigwigs that are above everyone else . 
  so what ? 
  the lesser bosses are not bosses anymore ? 
  using this line of reasoning , the total number of the * real * business leaders ( in russia ) may all be reduced to several hundreds . 
  it barely proves anything . 
  not necessarily . 
  for instance , like 100 % of lead accountants are women . 
  having a woman as a boss is also a routine situation in the state owned enterprises . 
  edit : a word, 
  what if gays are merely crybabies who are full of bitter jealousy of womyn 's good looks and success ? 
  i think that having women such as [ irina yarovaya ] ( http://www.compromat.ru/page_33130.htm ) or [ elena mizulina ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yelena_mizulina ) in leadership positions is discouraging a lot of potential women 's rights supporters . 
  are n't gays supposed to be more supportive of womyn ? 
  should n't gays pay more respect to womyn for their class struggle in the society owned by rich white old men ? 
  damn , you 're disappointing me , comrades !, 
  haha , patriarchal western misogynists can not into gender equality . 
  check your privileges and stop perpetuating the dominant oppressive masculinity !, 
  i was thinking more along the lines of economic diversity and competition in an industry . 
  money ca n't buy it , especially without the government putting certain effort . 
  i 'd rather say that history repeats as farce . 
  seems like i 'm getting too old for this , my sarcasm detector failed here . 
  whatever what would help russia get rid of the [ dutch disease ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_disease ) . 
  perhaps , the economic isolation is necessary to achieve that . 
  sorry if i got you wrong .

  a nenets ' shaman [ attended the meeting ] ( http://www.newstube.ru/media/neneckij-shaman-rasstroil-vitaliya-milonova ) of the legislative assembly of saint-petersburg by the invitation of the communist members of the said assembly . 
  [ vitaly milonov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vitaly_milonov ) got upset over this fact . 
  i do n't think it 's a fair comparison , you 're missing important points . 
  ukraine was the most prosperous , rich and educated republic of the former ussr . 
  along with independence , it has got the most fertile soil and a big chunk of the industry . 
  if anything , i think that an average citizen of ukraine had better initial conditions at the point of secession back then . 
  regardless of bullshit that is being spread by ukrainian teenagers here , ukraine was neither `` occupied '' nor `` a colony '' of russia . 
  it was a better part of the ussr than russia itself . 
  also , i doubt that a black guy from congo had a chance to become the king of belgium ( something something khrushchev ) . 
  as for oligarchs ... 
  some of them were influenced by their russian peers and other way around , some were not . 
  russia has always meddled in the internal affairs of ukraine in a matter of course but that does n't mean that russia has a direct control over its neighbor . 
  for the most part , russians had been trying to bribe them .

  i doubt that . 
  a lot of monasteries were used for different purposes ( storage etc ) and were handed back to the church after the fall of the ussr . 
   `` ukraine is responsible for everything that happens not sure whether i 'm a freethinker or not but ... do you think that this statement is false , except for the part where russia invaded/annexed shit ? 
  ukraine has been continually balancing on the brink of economy collapse since getting the independence , let alone that rampant corruption has been a problem regardless of the west/east orientation . 
   tectonics research ^ comments like this always remind me that modern kids have the memory span of a goldfish . 
  give it a half year bombarded by the pro-eu propaganda and the public stance in russia will make a u-turn .

  that , or maybe i got used to it . 
  it was written in a school book i had read in the 80 's .

  and authorities previously told us that the suspects were not caught on the surveillance video !,

  where else would we go if we needed a pair of killers , had we not the caucasus region , the cellar full of the perfect perpetrators ?
