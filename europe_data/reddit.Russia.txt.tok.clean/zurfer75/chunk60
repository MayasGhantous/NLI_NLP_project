  i mean , come on . 
  there are currently two wars at hand . 
  guess who are deemed responsible for that . 
  1 : http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/education-index 2 : [ academic ranking of world universities 2014 ] ( http://www.shanghairanking.com/arwu2014.html ) these are facts . 
  i 'm just stating the obvious . 
   educated people in russia haha , nice one . 
  to be fair , `` the head of saratov state university '' is a government appointed position . 
  the man who issued the letter is just a bureaucrat . 
  come on , what 's wrong with meat and vegetables ? 
  agreed about mayo though . 
  cola and burgers - well , that would be a really shitty and unhealthy meal . 
  i do n't think the poor in rufed can afford burgers these days . 
  they live on a diet of potato and macaroni . 
  i did n't understand your question about statistics , sorry . 
   spend half their income on shitty food 50 % of * retail spending * goes on food , ftfy . 
   shitty food do tell us , mr ramsay , what is not shitty food to you ? 
  osce twitter [ confirmed that it was ` from ' ] ( https://twitter.com/osce_smm/status/725603233822052352 ) . 
  `` one of the russians '' - that was me , actually . 
  truth be told , i have a mixed feeling about the russophobia thriving on this subreddit . 
  granted , many things being discussed here are true and the motherland , unfortunately , _ is _ a hellhole , but i 'm still upset about it . 
  too much close to casual european racism to be legit . 
  a name of god was irrelevant in that case . 
  soviet ideology was playing a role of a spiritual substitute of religion . 
  his estimates do n't mean that those 60 mil were set against the wall and executed right away . 
  think of the figures as of the number of `` victims '' in a broad sense of the word . 
  all those forced relocations , collectivisation , famines - you name it - everything counts . 
  i mean , no need to be executed to be a victim . 
   `` men have forgotten god ; that 's why all this has happened . '', 
  with all due respect to solzhenitsyn and his work , this was not what happened . 
  soviet `` communism '' had all the trappings of religion , such as dogma or ritual . 
  from what i 've gathered , she was barred from leaving the country , not actually detained . 
  [ falcon 9 ft ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falcon_9_full_thrust ) is much bigger and heavier than [ soyuz-2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soyuz-2_ ( rocket \\ ) ) . 
  i 'm not even sure if the two rockets belong to the same class . 
  it may take a while before a manned angara launch goes off , about 7-10 years down the line . 
  according to aforementioned [ dmytro kuleba ] ( https://www.facebook.com/dmytro.kuleba/posts/10154092177753389?pnref=story ) , vera has just taken refuge in ukraine 's consulate in rostov-on-don . 
  edit : according to poroshenko 's twitter , vera [ crossed the border into ukraine ] ( https://twitter.com/poroshenko/status/725681805769232384?lang=ru ) ( toxic comments alert , better not read it !,

  agreed . 
  i used to be a fierce nationalist and a regular attender of the russian march , but as of late , i 've been been more and more convinced that i 'm dealing with a well thought out campaign of mind-control . 
  outside of moscow and spb - yes , the resentment towards america is strong . 
  however , given a chance , they 'd move to the us without a second thought .

  nah , hedgehog jerky saves the day . 
  more nervous than before . 
  most differences between the situation now and that of 2 years ago boil down to : a ) the ruble has lost about half its value against the dollar since then ; b ) significantly less imported food from the nato countries . 
  other than that , you most likely would n't notice any differences in everyday life . 
  salaries are still high in it . 
  the political climate and general mood in the country are not that pleasant , so to say . 
  might be not the best idea to move here now . 
  you have a point , i 'll give you that . 
  here 's a little problem though : instead of ukraine , russia is not a mono-ethnic , mono-religious society . 
  even the balts had it easy in the 90s . 
  i mean , it does n't really matter how much of a hick your average russian is . 
  in the grand scheme of things , most of us could get along with others well . 
  this is , as i said before , not the case in the motherland . 
  a small clarification was added , 
  my cat has gotten so big that i had to put him on a diet . 
  thank you for worrying about us ; _ ; i really appreciate it . 
  it 's simpler than you think . 
  this time , it 's just a translation ( admittedly crappy , but it ca n't be helped ) of the article published by `` kommersant '' . 
  even rbth can be of use once in a while . 
  food prices in russia have been [ rising at a steady pace ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0rqxxnk.png ) for the last few years . 
  i do n't think anyone is surprised by that . 
  tv channel [ `` moscow 24 '' ] ( http://www.m24.ru/videos/110127 ) , the \\ # 1 business newspaper [ `` kommersant '' ] ( http://kommersant.ru/doc/2967460 ) , the \\ # 1 tabloid newspaper [ `` mk '' ] ( http://www.mk.ru/economics/2016/04/19/50-zarplaty-ukhodit-na-edu-tak-bedno-ne-zhili-8-let.html ) and virtually [ every single media outlet ] ( http://xn----8sbejf1b9b0a3g.xn--p1ai/%d1%80%d0%be%d1%81%d1%81%d0%b8%d1%8f%d0%bd%d0%b5-%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%b8-%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b8%d1%82%d1%8c-%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d0%b5%d0%b4%d1%83-%d0%b1%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%b5-%d0%bf%d0%be/342783/ ) is reporting this . 
  that goes without saying . 
  however , i do n't see any chance for changes in the near future . 
  okay , for the most part . 
  the overall situation is surprisingly tolerable . 
  ps : forgot to mention that the prices of tomatoes have been ridiculously high as of late . 
  i 'm sticking to green salads for the time being . 
  make of that what you will . 
  i guess the word ` turnover ' in this context means `` the total value of goods sold to customers '' . 
   * rising poverty levels due to a decline in real income are increasingly forcing russians to go without non-essential goods . 
  experts do not see any potential for improvement in the situation in the near future . 
  * --  the institute calculated that in february 2016 russians ' real income in comparison to the same period in 2015 had declined by 6.9 percent and real salaries had declined by 2.6 percent . 
  the poverty level by the end of 2015 had increased by 2.2 percent to 13.4 percent . 
  or , there 's the other way around . 
  the only thing that rufed has built so far is a strain of wild , unchecked capitalism , straight from the 19th century . 
  no workers ' rights , no social security system , no nothing . 
  no wonder many people feel a little nostalgic about ` the good ol' days ' . 
  the popularity of the ussr among the youth is a special kind of delusion that stems from ignorance . 
  as someone who grew up in the era of relative freedom , they never had any idea how bad , in terms of censorship , the ussr has always been . 
  exhibit a : the best korea . 
  every single photo published in the ussr was more or less staged , censored and later ( dis ) approved . 
  now these kids are looking at the pictures of `` happy life in the workers ' paradise '' and thinking that it could be true . 
  the ussr is dead but its propaganda machine is still alive and well . 
  one of the things the commies were really good at . 
  `` yes , but '' has the strong implication of `` no '' , in both russian and english . 
  which is why you ( and the moscow times ) should n't have conflated these two poll answers .
