  this is simply wrong . 
  * `` i would want to , but this is no longer possible '' . 
  * using ' \u0434\u0430 ' in a sentence could be confusing for a non native speaker . 
  for instance , ' \u0434\u0430 ' could either mean ` yes ' or ` no ' or nothing in such phrases as `` yes no '' , `` yes no maybe '' or `` yes no for sure '' in russian . 
   see the photo gallery : [ russia 's ponomarev scoops prestigious pulitzer prize ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/multimedia/photogalleries/russias-ponomarev-scoops-prestigious-pulitzer-prize/6293.html ), 
  i cautiously disagree with your sentiment . 
  rallying around the flag is not an [ unknown phenomena ] ( http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/gallupspaces/production/cms/poll/cvfspjk4hesmzts2bc0brg.gif ) - war does things to people . 
  there could be more to that than meets the eye . 
  economically wise , the situation over the last two years was definitely the worst in a very long time . 
  thanks to continually growing prices , the nearing collapse of health care , and the [ growing realisation ] ( https://ruposters.ru/news/08-04-2016/doverie ) that the state owned media is not _ entirely honest _ with people , many of the staunch proponents of the regime began to notice some discordance between reality and their perceptions . 
  as for now , the western sanctions are largely killing russia 's domestic banking sector . 
  on the other hand , these sanctions are a godsend for the propaganda machine . 
  that being said , it 's all nothing but a speculation . 
  not necessarily . 
  there 's a certain difference between the groups : `` i miss the ussr , let 's restore its power ! '', 
  and `` i would like to live in a state that could take care of me . 
  sadly , there 's no way to get it back '' . 
  i mean , you ca n't conflate the two . 
  at least , not while wearing a straight face .

  hate to ruin it for you , but the legal process is most definitely not over yet . 
  which is not surprising though . 
  handling corporate legal cases is a bread and butter for the army of lawyers , consultants et al. 
  haha , good call . 
  yea , you can be a filthy rich cello player ( hehe ) or you 've just buried a bag full of dollars in your garden - either way , this money is yours and hence a legitimate part of the economy . 
  at the same time , the money is not going directly into the gdp . 
  kind of schrodinger 's money . 
   a lot of the economy is in the shadows , so actual gdp is probably twice reported gdp if not more . 
  hold your horses . 
  i was under the impression that a shadow economy plays its part in a country 's gdp . 
  with regard to , e.g. , russia 's economy , the estimates of the size of the black/grey area may vary from 20 to 50 pct , depending on a source . 
  does it really mean that the actual gdp may be 20-50 % higher than the official data suggests ? 
  or it 's all included into the number you get from the official statistics , worldbank or whatnot . 
  i 'm genuinely curious . 
  i 'd rather have 90 % closed , in general . 
  the banking business model a la russe : 1 . 
  take a loan in a big western bank at , let 's say , 5 % per annum 2 . 
  offer credit lines starting at 10-15 % in the local currency ... 4 .

  no idea . 
  i just hope they are better off now than they used to be . 
  i mean , drinking huge quantities of the cheapest vodka you can buy is anything but healthy . 
  yep , the worst reaction you can get is `` the white trash is at it again !, 
  and now the weather ... '', 
  couple of my then-neighbors nearly drank themselves to death celebrating 9/11 . 
  both were fierce nationalists and , obviously , christian .

  yeah , and daily mail and the sun are n't the [ two most popular british newspapers ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/246077/reach-of-selected-national-newspapers-in-the-uk/ ) ... people fall for bullshit all the time and we have to deal with it . 
  it 's quite ironic , in fact , considering that the vast majority of national russian tv channels were modelled after the u.s. television . 
  source : worked there for a long time . 
  learning from the best , xaxaxa . 
  not even close . 
  rentv offers 1 ) dubbed american series and movies 2 ) homebrewed tv programs about the most crazy conspiracy theories ( mostly ufos , psychics , magic etc. ), 
  3 ) a daily news roundup , in comparison to which even rt looks like a pinnacle of quality journalism . 
  thank you !, 
   page 31 has the same graph regarding rape statistics regarding this graph , how to say `` russian '' in finnish ?

  a correct headline for this article would read : `` russia 's ruling elites continue to lose money '' . 
  more than [ 70 % of the russians have no savings ] ( http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2935606 ) at all , and the rest of those outside the tiny elite are n't in a much better position . 
  this is one badly written piece for dw . 
  why would they do that ? 
  the video of the incident was all over the news . 
  just a cheap way to boost the popularity of the airforce .
