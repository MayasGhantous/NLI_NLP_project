  [ stolen dutch paintings offered for sale by ukrainian militia ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/dec/07/stolen-dutch-paintings-sale-ukrainian-militia ) - i take it those paintings were eventually handed over to the authorities , right ? 
  my bad then . 
  the sailors , however , did n't strike me as particularly young either . 
  the average age of ruaf 's pilots is [ 35 ] ( http://old.redstar.ru/2009/07/28_07/4_03.html ) , so they might be allowed to drink . 
  it 's [ official ] ( http://ria.ru/world/20160413/1409882373.html ) . 
  there 's more to these papers than poor grammar . 
  no proper headers , no ref numbers etc. 
  kinda looks to me like someone unaccustomed to writing official letters made a some sort of artist 's illustration for the annual memo , in order to avoid publishing classified papers . 
  page # 17 gave me a good chuckle . 
  hard to believe that a native russian speaker would ever make such a stupid mistake . 
  it 's just me being a cynical twat or this swedish guy is blowing things out of proportion ? 
  kids are easily influenced by the mass media and they love all things edgy so no wonder they follow popular ` trends ' . 
  my generation was playing ` german fascists vs soviet guerillas ' , because of all the soviet ww2 movies , and yep , someone 's tool barn could be turned into the gestapo torture chambers , not to mention that those ` germans ' just loved to ` execute ' a couple ` fighters ' every once in a while . 
  in the 90s , russian kids were playing ` bratva vs businessmen ' and so on . 
  though these risky games could be a big no-no in sweden , i do n't know . 
  random yt videos do n't seem credible enough to give it a go . 
  you may want to submit this ap article as a post though . 
  this territorial dispute has been around for a long time . 
  no one seems to care about it anymore . 
  unfortunately , it did . 
  many people i know go apeshit every time the west comes up in conversation . 
  going from 30 % of the negativity towards the eu/us to 70-80 % over the course of a year . 
  the way things have changed over time is mind-boggling . 
  there are some hopeful signs that the government has finally decided to show the willingness to cooperate with the west : 1 .

  it 's [ rumoured ] ( http://www.gazeta.ru/social/2016/04/08/8168195.shtml ) that the four ukrainians convicted of terrorism may be handed over to ukraine in coming weeks . 
  i did n't say that the leak was aimed solely at the dearest leader , ok ? 
  just one of the possible outcomes . 
  desired , if you will . 
  i 'm not blaming anyone . 
  educated people tend to have a different mindset than those who are more likely to join the ( para ) military in case of war or ethnic tensions , so your anecdotal evidence is kinda irrelevant . 
  the events surrounding the fall of the ussr has shown us that different ethnicities could get along just fine , and then bam !, 
  - all of a sudden , they could go back to cutting each other 's throats in a matter of days . 
   according to human rights watch , during the war georgian paramilitary groups committed acts of violence against ossetian civilians within south ossetia that were motivated by the desire to expel ossetians and reclaim villages for georgia , and by sheer revenge against the ossetian people . 
  [ 10 ] between 60 and 100 villages were burned down , destroyed by georgian forces or otherwise abandoned . 
  several villages were ethnically cleansed by georgian forces . 
  on the other side , georgians living in ossetian controlled territory were `` easy targets '' : houses occupied by georgians were singled out , looted and burned down . 
  [ 2 ]  during the war , approximately 1,000 people died . 
  [ 3 ] it also led to the creation of large numbers of refugees : about 100,000 ethnic ossetians fled from south ossetia and georgia proper , mainly into north ossetia ( part of russia ) . 
  [ 11 ] a further 23,000 ethnic georgians fled from south ossetia and settled in other georgian areas .

  answering ` no ' to ` are we the baddies ? ', 
  is a basic inclination of the human psyche . 
  opinions ca n't exist in a vacuum ; no wonder that one 's national identity is relevant when picking sides in conflicts . 
  having said that , i 'm pretty far from blaming westerners for being narrow-minded . 
  in comparison to others , they are still better in that regard . 
  sorry if i made it sound like i 'm not happy watching for the show - i 'm slightly embarrassed by how much i enjoy it , haha . 
  european ( or any other for that matter ) redditors can be quite obtuse at times . 
  however , that 's beside the point . 
  the shit storm in comments on wikileaks twitter is worth to witness . 
  * `` being paranoid does n't mean they are n't out to get you '' * ( c ) someone . 
  it 's clear as day that the us is pushing for a regime change in rufed . 
  it 's also evident that the dearest leader will be fighting tooth and nail to prevent it .

  it 's worth mentioning that these `` extremists '' are members of [ the other russia party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_other_russia_ ( party \\ ) ) . 
  the [ national bolshevik party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_bolshevik_party ) has been officially banned in rufed since 2007 . 
  ps : the word on the street is that their leader , limonov , is an agent of the secret police . 
  about 100 `` crazies '' , actually .

  [ vladimir putin 's rating falls by 10 % ] ( http://rbth.com/politics_and_society/2016/03/21/vladimir-putins-rating-falls-by-10_577691 ) . 
  more likely , some guys to counter them ... 
  i beg to differ . 
  if you have the situation where any successful business can be easily raided and taken over , creating your own rainy day fund is a no brainer . 
  at very least , you would have a chance of fleeing a country to seek a new life . 
  it is especially the case in russia , where the central bank can freeze $ $ $ bank accounts on a whim . 
  yup , heard something about that . 
  the first time i encountered refugees , it was the late 80s , when about a hundred families of refugees from nk were , all of a sudden , accommodated in our neighbourhood . 
  truth be told , they did n't look like happy people . 
  i can only imagine the amount of crap they had to go through . 
  they first took up residence in the houses earmarked for demolition but subsequently stayed in the newly built apartment blocks . 
  i take it that they indeed had nowhere to return to . 
  apparently , the first head just rolled away : [ karabakh conflict : azerbaijani soldiers behead ezidi from armenia ] ( http://ezidipress.com/en/karabakh-conflict-azerbaijani-soldiers-behead-ezidi-soldier-from-armenia/ ) . 
  way to go . 
  the report on [ 1tv ] ( http://www.1tv.ru/news/world/305223 ) , that 's it . 
  well , my problem with pu is that he is blindly building another nanny state and , as the country runs out of money , there may be troubles . 
  the saddest part , it seems that he surrounded himself with yes-men who will most likely end up with steering into the wall . 
  if we want to avoid it , we should not be afraid of some ( potentially ) drastic changes . 
  that being said , next to no one likes turbulent times , because it sucks to live through . 
  right , maslow 's hierarchy of needs , that is . 
  however , we should n't demonise the soviets and blame them for the present , admittedly sad , state of affairs in rufed . 
  it smells of eugenics and other , generally racist stuff . 
  if anything , one of the best legacies of the ussr was a somewhat educated and proactive urban population that eventually managed to change the system . 
  i attended at many rallies back in 1990-91 , and , man , it was huge . 
  and now what ? 
  where 's all the people protesting / voting on elections ? 
  they all are sitting at home , watching tv . 
  bolsheviks have nothing to do with this fact . 
  pfft , do you really think that mr moustache is now talking to the domestic audience ? 
  the russian elites desperately want the respect of the developed world ; they do n't give a damn about what the local bydlo thinks .
