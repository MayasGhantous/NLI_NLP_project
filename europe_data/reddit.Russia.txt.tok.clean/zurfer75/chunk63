  on the contrary , if putin came out tomorrow and said : `` c'mon guys , you always knew that i 'm filthy rich '' , we would be left all speechless for a whole second and then would be like : `` what a lucky dog '' and nothing bad could come from that . 
  there 's a few things , among others , that money ca n't buy . 
  these are class , pedigree , and getting the true respect from the world 's elite . 
  the post-soviet nouveau riche lacks all of these things ; this is what makes them a laughing stock . 
  having said that , it 's likely that their kids will blend in just fine .

  tl ; dr : only major tv channels were completely silent on this issue . 
   neo-nazis and skinheads are big supporters of putin 's actions that 's not entirely correct . 
  the whole novorossya thing has seriously divided russia 's nationalistic movement in two . 
  the pan-slavic ( somewhat pro-ukraine in that conflict ) part is now under the dearest leader 's crackdown and its leader is currently in jail . 
   a militia in ukraine is a much smaller problem than the fascist views of the russian government .

   it has been estimated that half of the neo-nazis in the world are from russia . 
  estimated by whom , exactly ? 
  that 's what i asked you about . 
  so far i only found one [ abc news article ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/nightline/story?id=3718255&amp;page=1#.ucdbiaa4sui ) from 2007 , it 's in the wiki entry on neo-nazism . 
   there are neo-nazi in russia too , the most in europe . 
  this could be true ten years ago .

   in the 80s he wrote articles praising bin-laden . 
  you mean [ this one ] ( http://markhumphrys.com/images/fisk.1.jpg ) ?

   the independent tv station dozhd has announced a casting call for anchors . 
  one of the first journalists to take part in the open competition was zabi gaitukiyeva , a reporter whose resume includes working as an anchor for the chechen state television channel grozny . 
  test footage of gaitukiyeva -- a young woman wearing a bright-pink hijab -- has sparked a heated debate on russian social media .

  so , how is it related to the article at hand ? 
  i 'm curious , what part are you commenting on ? 
  \u2318 f ` baltics ' returns no hits . 
  will do my best to avoid getting drunk . 
  some interesting highlights from the article :  levada found 57 percent of russians said they entirely or generally agreed that stalin was a `` wise leader who made the ussr powerful and prosperous . '', 
  < . .   the pollsters also found that 71 percent of russians agreed that `` whatever mistakes or sins are attributed to stalin , the most important thing is that he led our people to victory in world war ii . '', 
  < . .   asked whether they agreed with the view that stalin was a `` brutal tyrant '' who killed millions , 62 percent said yes , while 23 percent disagreed . 
  the figures had changed slightly since 2008 , from 68 and 19 percent , respectively . 
  the poll was ordered by the israelis , iirc . 
  you can guess the magnitude of bias . 
  that was lenin , a man of many qualities . 
  your point being exactly what ? 
  you can be a citizen _ and _ a serviceman at the same time . 
  russian officials have yet to admit that the captured soldiers were on active duty ; this is why tass is referring to them as ` citizens ' on its website .
