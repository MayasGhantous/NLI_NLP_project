  sorry for a useless remark but man , i feel your pain !, 
  as someone who likes to grow a beard from time to time , i gradually got used to the intimidation , though in my case it 's all coming from the moscow police , not from the general public . 
  i mean , i get pulled over once in a while , sometimes get stopped by the cops at the metro entrances , all that stuff . 
  the thing is , i look a lot like a chechen guy with a beard . 
  couple that with a tight ` military ' haircut and you 'll get the whole picture , haha .

  would be nice if it was only one out of 12 who shares the stance of zhirinovsky . 
  collective punishment did wonders to my family in the 1930s . 
  i wish we could be friends . 
  however , now we 're about to be drawn into another cold war . 
  only time will tell how long it will take for normal relations to be restored .

  time left before the eu puts the blame for terrorist activities squarely on russia 's secret police : 3 . . 2 . . 1 . . 
  it 's not that i think that russia 's intel services are somehow incapable to do it , no . 
  nor that they can miss an opportunity to weaken their enemies in the eu ( and we _ are _ enemies now , let 's face it ) as much as possible . 
  the question is , however , to what extent is russia 's foreign policy the one to blame ? 
  one might argue that russian support of assad 's regime was the cause of the ongoing refugee crisis . 
  i kinda doubt that was the main cause . 
  why are you even surprised by that ? 
  intimidating a fugitive 's family has always been one of the most widely used manhunt techniques , along with using dogs for tracking or , dunno , offering a bounty . 
  allegedly , the board game was banned because of the foreword written by one of the polish authors . 
  you know , about the events that happened in 1939 , and all that stuff . 
  though i 've yet to find any sources other than the manufacturer 's facebook page . 
  it might as well be that the entire story is a misunderstanding . 
  or might not , it 's hard to tell .

  cool idea . 
   i caught a thief in a bus who stole wallet from an old woman . 
  you forgot to tell that the entire bus erupted in applause and the other lady stood up and thanked you for bringing the thief to justice . 
  #brussels warns eu banks against russian bond deal * alex barker in brussels and max seddon in moscow * brussels is urging european banks to steer clear of russia 's [ first sovereign bond issue ] ( https://next.ft.com/content/29c5af66-dbdd-11e5-a72f-1e7744c66818#axzz42sx611nr ) since the imposition of western sanctions over ukraine , creating fresh doubts about the viability of the offering . 
  although the eu 's sanctions do not explicitly prohibit purchases of russian government debt , eu officials have privately echoed washington 's warnings that the proceeds from an offering could be misused , according to two people familiar with the guidance . 
  if this qualified warning convinces european banks to avoid the sale , russia could be forced to abandon its first foray into capital markets since the [ annexation of crimea in 2014 ] ( http://www.ft.com/intl/indepth/crisis-in-ukraine?ft_site=falcon&amp;desktop=true ) , dealing a financial and political blow to the kremlin . 
  `` it is clear that they do n't want us to take part , '' said one banker familiar with the guidance . 
  `` we are being discouraged . '' in spite of the warnings , russia 's deputy finance minister , sergei storchak , insisted last month that enough foreign banks were still on board to proceed . 
  meanwhile , andrei belousov , an economic aide to mr putin , said he did not expect the treasury 's campaign to drive up russia 's borrowing costs . 
  moscow has long sought to undermine the west 's sanctions regime by accessing its capital markets while , at the same time , aggravating divisions between member states over the policy . 
  but there has so far been little shift in a sanctions policy that has enjoyed strong backing from angela merkel , the german chancellor . 
  after extended discussions on monday , eu foreign ministers reaffirmed that relations with moscow rested on the implementation of the minsk ceasefire accord in ukraine . 
  although the mere fact of a debate on russia alarmed some hawkish member states , only greece , hungary and italy pressed for more flexibility or a softening of the bloc 's response to russia . 
  that suggests that , unless there is unexpectedly rapid [ progress in ukraine 's peace process ] ( https://next.ft.com/content/7b31d8d8-0a06-11e5-a6a8-00144feabdc0 ) , the eu is moving towards once again extending existing curbs on russia 's energy , defence and financials services sectors when the current measures expire in june . 
  the bond issuance -- expected to come in the form of a $ 3bn , 10-year eurobond -- comes at a time when the government 's finances have been hit by recession and a plunge in world oil prices . 
  it is a test of the west 's willingness to take a tough line on sanctions grey areas , even as the eu pursues parallel talks with russia over syria and iran . 
  during monday 's ministerial discussion , philip hammond , the british foreign secretary , stressed that sanctions were squeezing russia by locking it out of capital markets and called on colleagues to maintain a `` robust '' approach . 
  yet the lack of outright sanctions on the russian state mean bondholders are unlikely to face trouble from regulators if the money is eventually used to support sanctioned entities , according to bankers and senior european officials . 
  in private guidance to banks , eu officials have merely urged the institutions to be mindful of the risks of bonds being used to circumvent sanctions and to take precautions , including insisting on clauses to stop the proceeds being diverted to sanctioned entities . 
  an obvious candidate for the funds is vnesheconombank , the state development bank facing a rbs1tn hole after a series of politically motivated loans to fund sochi olympic construction and the purchase of steel mills in eastern ukraine went awry . 
  unlike the other giant state lenders under us and eu sanctions , which have seen their dollar deposits rise as the rouble devalues , veb desperately needs the cash to pay off rbs200bn in eurobonds this year . 
  russia 's government is planning to spend rbs300bn from the national welfare fund , one of moscow 's two reserve funds , to sustain veb 's loan-making abilities , but has yet to indicate how much it will spend on the ailing bank from the budget . 
  `` this is a blatant attempt to get around the sanctions , '' said a senior banker in moscow . 
  `` veb 's got a trillion-rouble hole -- they 've got to come up with the money somehow . '' [ deutsche bank ] ( http://markets.ft.com/tearsheets/performance.asp?s=de:dbk ) , [ hsbc ] ( http://markets.ft.com/tearsheets/performance.asp?s=uk:hsba ) , [ credit suisse ] ( http://markets.ft.com/tearsheets/performance.asp?s=ch:csgn ) , [ bnp paribas ] ( http://markets.ft.com/tearsheets/performance.asp?s=fr:bnp ) and [ barclays ] ( http://markets.ft.com/tearsheets/performance.asp?s=uk:barc ) declined to comment on any eu guidance .

  like a softer version of polish . 
  ukrainian sounds like a poetic , archaic , villagers ' version of russian . 
  something you expect to hear from a 17th century peasant . 
  belorussian is entirely intelligible , just gives me a pastoral , archaic vibe . 
  polish sounds like `` trtbtgzhshtrstgzbzeshni '' czech speaks in diminutives . 
  even though i can vaguely understand written serbian ( and croatian , i guess ) , the way they speak gives me a headache . 
  no offense , southern cousins !, 
  well , they were n't the loveliest bunch of people . 
  perhaps , that 's one of the reasons why they got shelled . 
  it 's only my assumption but a territorial dispute concerning the border of leningrad oblast might well be handled by the administration of spb . 
  having said that , what do i know ? 
  everyone and their grandma know full well how corrupt the ruling elite is . 
  i think most of the people are just jealous of the elite 's wealth and power . 
  if you have to be corrupt to be rich , well ... pecunia non olet . 
  good leaders must lead by example , haha .
