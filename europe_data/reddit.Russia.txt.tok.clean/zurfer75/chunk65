  last time i checked the public support of nato was only growing . 
  apparently the strategy has n't worked so far . 
   i would prefer if europe , us , and russia put aside differences and worked together as friends instead of russia vs west/us cold war . 
  so would i. 
  but that 's not gon na happen . 
  neither of these are ready to `` put aside their differences '' . 
   a better strategy would be to strengthen the eu < . .  about your edit : the dearest leader is not a strategist , as it can be seen from the long ass string of failures and fuckups in the economy and politics . 
  plus it 's impossible for russia to get any serious advantage on the eu . 
  so , there 's really nothing to discuss . 
  you read way too much into that . 
  the gov ' t economic policies are reactive , not proactive . 
  just like the dearest leader has always been a sprinter , tactic , instead of developing any coherent strategy for dealing with the soviet legacy . 
   it seems he is making a high risk strategy of trying to break apart the eu by scaring civilians out of syria granted , i do n't know jack about the syrian conflict , but , as a rule of thumb : once you allow armed men in camo to roam freely in your country , be sure you will see civilians leaving in droves . 
  it 's , like , a fucking law of nature . 
  works everywhere , no matter what side you like more . 
  so , i do n't really buy into these sobbing stories about peaceful syrians being purposely bombed in hospitals . 
  if they stopped shouting what they always shout while waving aks above their heads , i might be less suspicious . 
  sorry if it sounded harsh . 
  my point is that the gov ' t stopped burning reserves after the near fiasco in 2014 . 
  imo , the economy is tanking because the most valuable assets , such as gazprom and the likes , were overpriced before , due to ridiculously high oil prices . 
  now it 's just getting back to normal . 
  back to the sad reality of non-diversified economy , i might add . 
   russia burns through the last of its reserves that 's not entirely correct . 
  russia 's foreign currency reserves have been [ growing for the last year ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/foreign-exchange-reserves ) .

  at first it was `` ukraine 's russian majority areas were artificially created by the soviet union '' now it 's `` it means they are not indigenous to the area , it 's not a russian land ! '', 
  i 'm glad we made some progress .

  i just reminded you of the fact that russians have lived there for three centuries . 
  i know , some facts do not fit into the comfortable narrative . 
  except it was you who first raised the issue of the recent annexation and accused me of trying to justify that . 
  how is it not a strawman argument ?

  nope , i just pointed out that a significant russian population in crimea was not `` artificially created by the soviet union '' . 
  they 've been living there since the 18th century . 
  so did ukrainians . 
  i did n't say a word about the annexation . 
  meanwhile , your response a textbook example of a strawman argument . 
   does n't affect the legality that goes without saying . 
  you 're making a strawman argument .

   anyway , my general thought is that you can not fix russia by applying european or american solutions because its neither . 
  you ca n't force people to choose someone else by making life harder because life in russia has been hard for the past 1000 years . 
  well put , could n't agree more . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=2726191&amp;tid=109524 ) the story did n't get much coverage on tv in particular . 
  former resident of chertanovo checking in :d, 
  you can read the whole article if you are interested . 
  the thing is , the crimean khanate was a ** turkic ** vassal state of the ottoman empire before the annexation by the russian empire . 
  ukraine had no business down there . 
   does n't make sense . 
  it does . 
   moscow has the largest muslim population in europe , with estimates suggesting that between [ 1.5 and 2 million ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/moscow-largest-muslim-city-europe-faithful-face-discrimination-public-authorities-2020858 ) of the russian capital 's population are of the faith . 
  my guess is that it 's about [ one past incident ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7resf5xira ) that remains vivid in memory . 
   but none of the major television networks -- including channel one , rossia-1 , ntv and moscow 's tvts -- made a single mention of the incident in their newscast well , that 's not entirely correct . 
  [ ntv 's '' \u0427\u041f '' report ( video ) ] ( http://www.ntv.ru/sobytie/%d0%a3%d0%b1%d0%b8%d0%b9%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%be%20%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b1%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%ba%d0%b0%20%d0%b2%20%d0%9c%d0%be%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b2%d0%b5 ) ; the people 's gathering [ at the crime scene ] ( http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/1610336 ) ; muscovites brought [ flowers and toys to the metro entrance and victim 's house ] ( http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/1610317 ) . 
  that being said , 1tv and rossia-1 once again failed to deliver , as expected . 
   ukraine 's russian majority areas were artificially created by the soviet union through a state-organized famine and russian immigration . 
  which is not the case for crimea though : [ demographics_of_crimea ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_crimea#ethnicities_and_languages ) , check out the results of the 1897 census .

   jan sjunnesson , a reporter for local news service ** avpixlat ** , which partnered with nine on the story , wrote that the nine crew ran into the trouble before reaching rinkeby when a man approached asking why they wanted to film in rinkeby . 
  he then deliberately drove over the cameraman 's foot .
