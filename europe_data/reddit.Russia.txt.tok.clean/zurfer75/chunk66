  non-random nanny would cost them a fortune . 
  that 's why i put quotation marks around the word `` nurse '' . 
  she was anything but qualified for the job . 
  in fact , about half of the population of moscow [ have come here from elsewhere ] ( http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=1158455 ) . 
  take whatever you want from this . 
  it 's doubtful that many outside the upper class could afford a non-migrant babysitter . 
  last time ( long before the crisis hit ) when we were hiring a `` nurse '' for our grandma , we ended up paying her about 50k a month . 
  of course , she was a n asian migrant . 
  hiring a russian nanny would have cost twice as much .

  with a little respect to astakhov , he 's talking out of his million-dollar ass . 
  it 's barely possible to get some migrant 's mental state properly checked in moscow . 
  granted , it goes without saying that the uzbek lady is obviously mental . 
  but the victim blaming is n't really helping either . 
  actually , according to the russian sources , she went banana because of her husband who cheated on her .

  what was that funny finnish word for secondhand embarrassment ? 
  with all due respect , but you 're moving the goalposts . 
  calls for hanging / lynching a group of people are calls for violence at its core . 
  koptelov launched a petition calling for , roughly speaking , losing sovereignty and thus getting better pensions and salaries . 
  you ca n't really compare the two . 
  i doubt that . 
  it does n't make any sense if you could start a petition with `` save the whales '' , get a gazillion of votes , and then edit it to `` xaxa , i trick yuo , kill the whales '' . 
  propka has one day a week designated for gay parties , iirc . 
  still nothing in comparison to the good old days . 
  nah , moscow 's nightlife has drastically changed over the last years . 
  now it 's mostly rich sugar daddies picking up younger boys for a hookup . 
  which is thinly veiled male prostitution , imo . 
  are you for real ? 
   events to mark the one-year anniversary of the death of kremlin critic boris nemtsov will be held in 57 cities in russia and across the world on saturday . 
   in moscow , a rally -- expected to be attended by 50,000 people -- will start at 2 p.m. at strastnoi bulvar and finish at prospekt akademika sakharova . 
  the organizers of the rally obtained permission for the event from the city authorities . 
   st.petersburg residents will gather at 2 p.m. in the city center to participate in an anniversary event , also approved by the authorities . 
   events in nemtsov 's honor approved by the authorities will be also held in the russian cities of kazan , samara , perm , chelyabinsk , yaroslavl , krasnodar , yekaterinburg and a number of other cities . 
   the arkhangelsk authorities in northern russia rejected a request to hold an event in his honor . 
   the residents of kaliningrad were also deprived of the possibility to arrange a memorial event , as city authorities claimed there was no space available on the date for such an event .

  it 's quite heartbreaking to realise that as recently as 5-6 years ago there were popular gay clubs in moscow .

   riga , feb 26 ( leta ) - riga kurzeme district court today sentenced maksims koptelovs , a resident of latvia , to six months in prison for launching an online signature drive for latvia 's accession to russia , as his attorney ilona bulgakova told leta . 
   < . .   as reported , the petition was submitted to the u.s. based www.avaaz.org in march 2014 . 
  `` if latvia returns to russia , all residents of the republic of latvia will have enormous development opportunities - much greater than those available in the european union , '' said the message . 
  koptelovs said later that the petition was meant to be a joke . 
   * ps : on a more serious note , the document does not bear any significance as it was meant to be a joke . 
  if someone has no sense of humour , [ we express our ] deepest condolences to them . 
  appreciate your polite take on it . 
  i 'd have gone with ` whining ' myself .
