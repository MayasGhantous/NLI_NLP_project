  apparently i mixed up http://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/ and http://morningstaronline.co.uk/ , my apologies then . 
  yes , it 's him .

  first of all , i 'm surprised that morning star is still around . 
  is n't it a uk commies ' outlet ? 
  really gets the '70s vibe . 
   calm . 
  that is the surprising feeling after spending a week on the ground in russia . 
  yeah , no . 
  it 's called ` apathy ' . 
  what 's to worry about when there is not much you can do about the current situation ?

  to be fair , it 's ridiculous to compare the two . 
  navalny is a real politician , who was running for moscow mayor against all odds . 
  whereas ja is just a western whistleblower . 
  obviously , everything comes at a price and the tv show could be part of it . 
  secondly , it 's completely wrong to see a weaponised media killer in the navalny guy . 
  the kremlin paid propagandeurs are jumping out their pants trying to paint him as such . 
  this falls into their underlying narrative : ` no one is honest , everyone is corrupt ' . 
  there are gigabytes of leaked emails of russian officials floating around in the internet , you 're just not paying attention . 
  just google shaltai 's leaks of whatever its name is now . 
  or navalny 's investigations . 
  wikileaks is part of the western world , russia 's internal issues are simply out of their scope . 
  i mean , you should n't be surprised by a lack of leaked documents from , i dunno , cambodia or cameroon , right ? 
  translation is also a problem . 
  what 's wrong with the notion of two ( or more ) adults having consensual sex ? 
   a ** new ** deal between the us and russia to enforce a ceasefire in syria has been reached , with the cessation of hostilities set to come into force on 27 february .
