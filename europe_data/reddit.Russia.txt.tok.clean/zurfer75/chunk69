  actually , i was thinking of potential draftees , under the age of 27 . 
  you 're right though , in case of an all-out war , i might as well be affected by the risk of draft . 
  hopefully it would never get to that point .

  i 'm not sure that [ this ] ( https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/riposte_la%c3%afque ) does really need to be `` labeled '' . 
  it speaks for itself . 
  granted , overly political correctness _ may _ cause some minor issues with the press coverage but presenting the situation as `` the free press is dead '' would be a huge , huge stretch .

  for some people ( e.g. , russian army generals ) , the 90s is not an ancient history and all that matters is their own opinion . 
   if turkey was supplying chechen terrorist paramilitaries . 
  funny that you said that . 
  in the late 90s , it was widely rumoured in russia that turkey was , at some point , funding and supplying the chechen separatists .

  i remember that . 
  and i also remember 2011-12 and how said minorities were laughing at people protesting in both capitals . 
  well , they had it coming . 
  it 's doubtful , at this point , that any minorities ( or the core ethnicity for that matter ) have a say in that regard . 
  the train has long since left the station .
