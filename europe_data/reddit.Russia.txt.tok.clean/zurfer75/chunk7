  if one wants to get karma from bashing russia why not to do it on / r/worldnews ? 
  the latter seems fitting for that purpose . 
  the post addresses are written like in japan . 
  russia itself is n't going to be like japan . 
   evil opiate market ... which is controlled by tadjiks . 
  a man can not surpass them . 
  inside my head such kind of people is bound to delivery of horilka and borsch . 
  perhaps , i 'm just hungry atm . 
  actually , symbols from `` cp1251 '' or `` koi-8 '' columns are well-known in the different european languages . 
  hell , i wonder if he tried to pronounce it before writing , lol . 
  you 're welcome . 
  btw , there 's an immediate schoolyard response for an insult mentioned earlier : `` go fuck your own [ mother ] , it 'd be cheaper '' . 
  i think it 's simple . 
  sender get an address via e-mail . 
  if sender had an international version of windows installed he would see characters from `` original '' column . 
  unfortunately , it seems like a sender had english-only version hence he saw symbols from `` cp1251 '' and have handwritten an address symbol by symbol . 
  tbh , one of the most common expressions means `` fuck your mother '' but remains impersonal at the same time . 
  you was referring to your ass : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_life_expectancy rank | country | age -- | -- | -- 124 | russia | 70.5 nothing good , of course , comparing to , say , japan .

  or just to evade exhausting accusations made by / u/yadungoofed , because he pissed me off . 
  encoding is right . 
  it seems like a font file on a sender 's computer does n't contain cyrillic symbols . 
  terrible ? 
  check your facts .

  are you serious ? 
  strange question . 
  of course , she puts much value upon life of any human being , regardless of nationality , sexual behavior or a type of drug addiction . 
  how to know if weed is n't poisoned by evil gay nazi ukranians ? 
  tv ca n't lie , amirite ? 
  my pleasure . 
  my mother just told me that ukraine intentionally supplies poisoned weed to russia and junkies are dying across the country . 
  russian tv told her so . 
  smart woman , two master degrees , professional translator . 
  goddamn , it makes me sick . 
  according to [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons ) russia has 8,000 warheads in total , hence a number in the headline still makes no sense . 
  yep , i watched on yt how fry interviewed milonov . 
  stephen definitely has a great mind , if i were in his shoes i 'd probably punched vitaly in the face . 
  perhaps , you should write a letter and ask milonov : what did he have in mind ? 
  op has kindly provided an address . 
  the choice of a postage stamp design is yours , it 's entirely up to you . 
  `` if a man tries to have homosex as an experiment , there 's nothing wrong with that . 
  but only once '' - vitaly milonov russian lurkmore has a great article about milonov [ ( google translate , not safe for brains !, 
  ) ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2flurkmore.to%2f%25d0%2592%25d0%25b8%25d1%2582%25d0%25b0%25d0%25bb%25d0%25b8%25d0%25b9_%25d0%259c%25d0%25b8%25d0%25bb%25d0%25be%25d0%25bd%25d0%25be%25d0%25b2&amp;edit-text= ), 
  relax , man . 
  i 've just pointed out that a number in the headline does n't match info taken from state.gov or the article body . 
  save your ammo for somebody else . 
  the ~ ~ entire ~ ~ clickbait article , ftfy . 
  you 're spending too much time playing video games , ai n't ya ? 
  there 's nothing unusual in a drunk snowplow driver in the morning , haha . 
  it 's happened in vnukovo , the most shitty moscow airport . 
  lenta.ru [ ( gt ) ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2flenta.ru%2fnews%2f2014%2f10%2f21%2fvnukovo1%2f&amp;edit-text= ) reported that the driver of a snowplow was drunk . 
  nuff said . 
  http://www.state.gov/t/avc/rls/232359.htm , mentioned in the article , says : category of data | usa | ru -- | -- | -- deployed icbms , deployed slbms , and deployed heavy bombers | 794 | 528 warheads on deployed icbms , on deployed slbms , and nuclear warheads counted for deployed heavy bombers | 1642 | 1643 where does a number in the title ( 5000 ) come from ? 
  i do n't get it . 
   de margerie had been critical of eu and us sanctions against russia in the wake of the ukraine crisis . 
  `` can we live without russian gas in europe ? 
  the answer is no , '' de margerie said . 
  the devil has a horrible sense of humor . 
   when his private plane collided with a snow plough snow has melted away last night . 
  it 's raining in moscow . 
   it 's lower on the map than nl ... basically , in eurasia , the farther on east you move , the colder climate you get . 
  for instance , next cities are roughly laying on 55th parallel north ( denmark ) but a minimum temperature varies a lot : vilnius : -20 c , moscow : -40 c , novosibirsk : -50 c. 
  ahh , this . 
  no , minas morgul is a command centre and headquarters , not a maternity home . 
  if seriously , i know this kind very well . 
  in moscow , mobsters were killing each other during early nineteens , survivors were almost finished by chechens , the rest became a businessmen . 
  no , people in the video are another thing - it 's famous donetsk thugs , so-called ` donetkie ' . 
  they were a real power even in russia to some extent . 
  tbh , watching this video is like seeing through a crystal ball into the past for me . 
  i have n't been to russia for a long time , sitting in moscow , maybe it is an explanation of my reaction . 
  * darling , i 'll take your panamera . 
  only first squad of orcs has marched out of the gates . 
  nazgul is sitting up there , waiting for arrival of armies . 
   russia 's state-owned companies will be prohibited from buying certain foreign-made industry products that have russian analogues . 
  hahahaha !, 
  it 's the best news ever !, 
  i ca n't wait to see our fat officials driving low-cost vehicles instead of luxury german cars !, 
  honestly , i do n't think actual numbers of the regime support among russians matter at this point . 
  this has gone too far . 
  even though today some agency will claim that putin has zero support in russia it wo n't change anything . 
  i have no idea about gays ; also , i ca n't even imagine how to prove this fact , lol . 
  i remember there was a story when one asylum seeker from russia was n't granted a residence and committed suicide in detention centre in netherlands . 
  sad story , he 's been living for a year there , iirc , before it happened . 
  jews can leave to israel any time they want , there 's no problems . 
  wish you all the luck you can get . 
  be stronk !, 
  i 'm sure you 're too kind to me . 
  thank you !, 
  it would be stupid to expect that ukrainian people forgive us and forget all this shit as if nothing happened . 
  i can only hope that war will be ended and things will settle down some day . 
  this is exactly what they want you to feel . 
  they want us to be enemies of each other . 
  this is a only one way to win for them . 
  you have to make your own choice in this case : believe them or not . 
  edit : also , you may watch this potato-quality [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvjfgeb9d2s ) , haha . 
  my apologies , but it is absolutely impossible . 
  personal attacks are against the rules of most subs and , to be honest , against my own rules .
