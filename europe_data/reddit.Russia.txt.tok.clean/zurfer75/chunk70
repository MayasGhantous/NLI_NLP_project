   we 're used to short-sighted irresponsible military adventures this is spot on right here . 
  that 's why i keep thinking that arming the kurds is definitely not off the table . 
  in the short run , this just may come in handy for the kremlin . 
  russia may then return a favour and start supplying the kurds with something more sophisticated than they have now . 
  two can play at that game .

  104 commercial buildings ( mostly shops , the legacy of the 90s ) were subjected to demolition by the city .

   both were already attempted actually ... [ nato -- russia relations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato%e2%80%93russia_relations ) , [ russia -- european union relations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia%e2%80%93european_union_relations#eu_membership_discussion ) - such attempts have never taken place . 
  just usual political talks every now and then . 
  both nato and the eu require a candidate county to meet certain conditions to join . 
  as well as a unilateral support of the existing members of the eu/nato . 
  this is not a voluntary decision that could be made behind the curtains . 
   p. 9 restore control of the state border to the ukrainian government in the whole conflict zone , which has to start on the first day after the local election and end after the full political regulation ( local elections in particular districts of donetsk and luhansk oblasts based on the law of ukraine and constitutional reform ) by the end of 2015 , ** on the condition of fulfillment of point 11 ** -- in consultations and in agreement with representatives of particular districts of donetsk and luhansk oblasts within the framework of the trilateral contact group . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minsk_ii the minsk accord requires some paragraphs to be fulfilled in a certain order . 
  which is the case . 
  the border control could be restored on condition of the implementation of the constitutional reform ( a greater autonomy given to dnr/lnr ) .

  i doubt that .

  the angry mob that you can see in the video is just a bunch of random muscovites living in the same neighbourhood .

  not the muslims that live in moscow right now . 
  tatars , yep , but they have become so secular over time en masse that the differences are barely noticeable . 
  i 'm a bit too old and a way too sick to move anywhere . 
  plus i 'm kind of starting from scratch here . 
  though i 'm slowly getting my shit together ; less than 2 years ago i was unable to form a simple sentence in english , haha . 
  i do n't speak on behalf of the state . 
  it 's just a common attitude of the people . 
  just think how many russians would be opening champagne if the nc republics were booted off the motherland the other day . 
  this is not about `` your people are baddies '' ( that was funny to read , considering you are a westerner ) . 
  this is about that we ca n't get along with `` your people '' . 
  and should not do that , for the people 's sake . 
  tatars are not exactly aliens in moscow . 
  the diaspora has been around ever since . 
  i 've read that most of moscow muslims came from tajikistan and azebadjan . 
  ca n't find the source atm , sorry . 
  you 're right though about the north caucasian muslims . 
  we 're not happy about them either . 
  i do n't think that anyone is `` funnelling '' refugees . 
  granted , some local mafia / cab drivers are happy to show them directions and earn a little money . 
  most likely , no one wants to deal with them . 
  you seriously overestimate the willingness of russian authorities to provide some afghanis with free housing and money handouts . 
  this is a wrong country for that . 
  which is not surprising , if you think about it thoroughly . 
  according to [ the russian police ] ( http://tass.ru/proisshestviya/2627076 ) , the incident did n't take place .

  in case you did n't notice i was n't entirely serious in my reply . 
  yep , it 's only natural that many former colonial capitals have to deal with the immigration of people from former colonies . 
  no biggie . 
  i do n't mind the people that come and live here unless they break the law . 
  i might add that , by your logic , the uk should be waiting for 1.2 billions of indians arriving any minute now . 
  which is , seemingly , not going to happen . 
  appealing to history does n't always make you look clever , by the way . 
  considering how many times tatars and mongols have burned moscow to the ground , i would say that we owe nothing to the descendants of the golden horde . 
  so this is an act of pure generosity on our part , hahaha . 
  i ca n't believe my eyes that i 'm reading it in the guardian .

  what is he wearing , a puma tracksuit ? 
  he looks like a typical wannabe gopnik from the moscow suburb . 
  only three millions ? 
  is that what all the fuss is about ? 
  we have between 1.5 and 2 millions in [ moscow alone ] ( http://www.ibtimes.com/moscow-largest-muslim-city-europe-faithful-face-discrimination-public-authorities-2020858 ) .
