  what you talking about is a textbook example of abusing the system . 
  `` piss off the authorities and thus get the grounds for asylum '' . 
  man , it 's not cool . 
  for the record , i did n't say that i were going to use this way out . 
  personally , i prefer to think that i 'm capable to make it to the west ( if needed ) by a legal way . 
  if not , then i 'm just a useless leech that should stay put where it belongs . 
  for the common good . 
  sounds bdsm-esque .

  i beg to differ . 
  if i ever wore such a t-shirt , it would get me killed , that 's it . 
  if you speak up against the state , it will get you jailed , that 's it . 
  you ca n't leave the country when you 're being charged with _ any _ crime . 
  in short , you have to be a very , very lucky dog to be a real , non-imaginary dissenter and , in the same time , be able to get away with it and flee the country . 
  granted , it worked for some public figures in history . 
  political asylum is mostly limited for some cohort from the countries that internationally recognized as non-safe for said cohort . 
  like , for closeted gays from ksa or something to that effect . 
  if anything , i 'd say that the government is doing it right so far . 
  rising salaries would only push the inflation rate up ( it 's already high ) . 
  layoffs would only incite the panic among the state workers . 
  i think that op is too young to remember the 90s . 
  as the saying goes , ` he 's never smelled the gunpowder ' . 
  i worked as a junior it in one of the goddamn core ministries back then , and my monthly salary was less than $ 100 . 
  for a full-time job , mind you . 
  why do they think it should be different now ? 
  has anything changed since then ? 
  haha . 
  the active political stance will land you in jail much sooner than it gives you the grounds for claiming asylum . 
  just saying . 
  although i used to go to the opposition rallies ( hell i 've probably been at all of them in the last few years ) i really do n't see if it 's going anywhere . 
  to me it looks like another attempt of controlling the masses . 
  and we all know who 's calling the shots . 
  believe it or not , i do n't think that the western asylum system should be abused in that way . 
  there are quite a few people running from war and persecution who deserve it much more . 
  as for russia , as long as you pose no direct threat to the corrupted state structures , they do n't give a flying one about you . 
  on top of that , being a west-leaning ( or anti-government for that matter ) citizen does n't make one qualified for asylum . 
  check out the statistics . 
  i bet my money that chechen nationals make a lion 's share of the successful asylum applicants from russia . 
  at very least in the eu , russia is considered to be a safe country . 
  a textbook example of [ survivorship bias ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/survivorship_bias ) , man . 
  you do n't know what part of those who tried to move to the us actually made it through . 
  so do i. 
  last time i checked the prices started from $ 7k for a `` lawyer '' ( getting a job offer and visa , in a legal way or not ) + tickets + pocket money for the first months . 
  a valuable occupation + a good command of english go without saying . 
  i could be mistaken though . 
  it 's also worth noting that the ones who are _ really _ in a dire situation at home tend to emigrate more actively . 
  nothing to lose and all that stuff . 
  btw , that 's why there are literally millions of ukrainians living in the states . 
  which is not surprising , considering their history . 
  i 'd give up my left leg for any european passport ( both legs for that of western europe ) without a second thought . 
  you put it as if america is handing out the working visas to russians , haha . 
  the state is not going to raise the wages of its workers in the foreseeable future . 
  massive layoffs , on the other hand , are quite possible . 
  how the heck a full length documentary could be only 25 minutes long ? 
  op , are you sure this is not a fragment or bogus video ? 
  i was referring to kiselev . 
   `` crimea is henceforth a russian territory '' this kind of phrasing indicates a strong bias , if you ask me . 
  i noticed that when i watched the trailer . 
  honestly , i 'm not going to insist on my point but it 's worth to remember , as the old saying goes : ` never say never ' . 
  our chief of the state propaganda department was a liberal journalist ten years ago . 
  shit , unfortunately , happens . 
  the sentence about ` crimea is currently russian ' ( or something to that effect ) has actually hit my nerve a bit . 
  this perfectly fits the kremlin narrative .

  for the record , i never said i actually believed in the grand american conspiracy behind maidan . 
  i just think that there is a lot of possibilities between these `` le ebil cia staged a coup d'\u00e9tat '' and `` america was n't involved at all '' extremes . 
  and if by `` meddling '' you mean `` giving money to loyal elites to keep them loyal '' then it 's true , for sure . 
  the horizontal ties between two countries were strong . 
  still are , even though this is not a popular point of view . 
  not saying that it _ was _ a us operation but given their track record in meddling in other countries ' internal affairs , i would say that this is not something unheard of  although i only watched the trailer and it 's too soon for me to make up my mind . 
  having said that , the fact that the filmmaker presented the annexation of crimea as a legitimate process is quite telling . 
  so , * it seems * that the docu might be a propaganda piece .
