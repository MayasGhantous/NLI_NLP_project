  i do n't think that there are many migrants coming from the baltic trio . 
  as for the rest of former soviet republics , most of them were royally screwed over long before the creation of the ussr .

  hmm , i thought it 's been around for a while ? 
  anyway , navalny 's team did a good job revealing the truth about corruption . 
  sadly , i do n't see it getting much traction in the west .

  he 's against the corruption , that 's enough . 
  navalny is my president , kalleluuja . 
  you know nothing about him , so please , please stop badmouthing the guy . 
  no , you did not  cheers . 
  indeed . 
  nope , the article i had in mind was published after the crimean annexation . 
  no , it 's not . 
  it 's 49 % percents who think that expressing honest opinions is not welcoming much . 
  wow , let us not open this can of worms . 
  dude , i 've never ever thought about approving anything what putin does . 
  this comes from my family , from the number of my potential ancestors who 've never made it through the 1930s . 
  i 'm not _ that _ critical of him for the only one reason : he reflects the desires of the vast majority of russians . 
  and i , fuck that shit , but i love my country and these pathetic pricks and cunts who happened to be born and live here . 
  you may want to find his interview to the rferl on their website . 
  i 've lost the link . 
  yep , i do n't even know what is more embarrassing : the whole `` mission accomplished '' thing or the murican crowd cheering at it . 
  i mean , there 's nothing to be ashamed of , if your president starts a war , especially if you 've never voted for this prick . 
  after all , you would have never known it beforehand . 
  shit happens . 
  you 're just showing your obvious bias here , * my friend * . 
  not everything in this world is about geopolitics . 
  i 'm talking about the everyday life , when you have to watch you back every goddamn minute . 
  levada center is being under control of the state . 
  no , it 's not a `` russian thing '' , you 're wrong on this one . 
  `` dog eats dog '' across the entire world with the exception of the western counties . 
  which is neither the biggest nor the most populated part of world , mind you . 
  grandparents ? 
  haha , when i was surveyed by phone ( landline phone , mind you ) on my opinions on the politics , i expressed full support for the dealings of the dearest leader . 
  truth be told , i also said that i would have voted for navalny , if he was in the ballot sheet , haha . 
  in case you did n't notice , all polls in rufed _ are _ done by the state nowadays . 
  of course they do but we can only make assumptions on the real extent of his support . 
  the last survey by a western pollster was conducted almost two years ago , shortly after the events in crimea . 
  no wonder that the dearest leader got a high approval rating . 
  rallying around the flag is a well-known behavioural flaw , haha . 
  since then , western pollsters have been de-facto banned from russia as the government deemed them to be `` unwanted '' foreign ngos . 
  this attitude has nothing to do with brainwashing per se . 
  this is the result of extreme cynicism . 
  `` everyone lies '' , `` everyone steals '' , `` get yours while you can '' etc. 
  quite popular point of view , to be honest .

  the russian middle class is different today from what it was ten years ago . 
  nowadays , it 's mostly a ruling class and their relatives / employees . 
  hence the shift in public opinion towards greater autocracy . 
  `` never bite the giving hand '' and all that stuff . 
   49 percent of respondents expressed the view that the russians are reluctant to respond to polls . 
  there you are . 
  apples and oranges . 
  while i believe that not following the pc line of thinking might have some minor negative consequences , that 's not the same as actually being in fear for your life or freedom . 
  ** a quarter of russians are afraid to tell pollsters about the situation in the country ** about 26 percent of russians are afraid to express their own opinions in public opinion polls on the situation in the country . 
  it is reported by `` kommersant '' with reference to the sociological survey `` levada center . '',
