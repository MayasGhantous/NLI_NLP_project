  speaking of surveys in general , 49 percent of respondents expressed the view that the russians are reluctant to respond to polls . 
  more than half of the survey participants answered thus believe that the russians are afraid of the consequences for themselves , 20 percent believe that the russians themselves uncomfortable truth about the situation in the country . 
  * political analyst konstantin kalachev said that `` the problem of socially approved responses , there is not the first '' : `` this is called the spiral of silence . 
  people go for the majority , they are afraid to stand out , superstitious prefer not to wake smartly and meet the harvested positive mantras '' * \u2192 kommersant, 
  unfortunately for all of us , things can turn ugly if someone here decides to return a long overdue favor and starts funding and arming the kurdish militia . 
  by the way , the chechen rebellion was secular in the beginning . 
  little santa helpers from ksa arrived significantly later .

  i take it that the turks are getting their own chechnya soon , are n't they ?

  yep , i 'm an old fart from moscow . 
   refugees from ** ukraine ** that 's the point . 
  as i said before , accepting ukrainian refugees was a public stunt . 
  actually , i remember reading a lot of complains coming from them . 
  the problem is that russia has never had any coherent policy concerning foreign refugees . 
  granted , some of them ( e.g. , refugees from nagorno-karabakh in the late 80s ) were given with free housing etc , but , at the same time , a lot of ethnically russian refugees from the former soviet - stans got literally nothing and on top of that they had to pay customs fees for their belongings when they were moving to russia . 
  tl ; dr : it 's much more complicated than it seems at the first glance . 
   `` people have decided that the worst is over , '' claimed a poll from the ** russian public opinion research center ** i bet that according to the state pollster of nk , the vast majority of their people are extremely happy as well . 
  the best thing that the western mass media can do is to stop spreading state-sponsored lies , since it 's a massive part of the propaganda machine . 
  fair enough but i still do n't get how a small minority could exert influence on the moldova 's politics . 
  i was replying to the following bit :  but then romania would have do deal with this mess directly : unhappy russian minorities < . .  - / u/trorollel i can only see one stunning 6 % russian minority in the list . 
  i mean , even though i can speak english a little , it does n't necessarily make me a staunch supporter of the british crown . 
  the argument that every russian speaker is overtly anti-european does n't hold any water . 
  what minorities ? 
   moldovan 75.8 % , ukrainian 8.4 % , russian 5.9 % , gagauz 4.4 % , romanian 2.2 % , bulgarian 1.9 % , other 1 % , unspecified 0.4 % [ link ] ( http://www.indexmundi.com/moldova/demographics_profile.html ), 
  the prices are going up , people 's mood is hitting a new low . 
  petrol & transportation prices are growing slowly yet steadily . 
  the prices of medicines are going through the roof , so i suppose that we all are royally screwed in the short/medium run , due to a flood of knock-off ( at best ) and fake ( most likely ) medications on the market . 
  on the bright side , i 'm paying $ 5/mo for 50 mbps optical fiber internet . 
  which is good , by any standard .

  some of them were , probably . 
  it 's worth to keep in mind that the whole situation was a giant public stunt and ukrainian refugees they were put under spotlight because of this . 
  now they and their problems are mostly forgotten .

   their people have some common culture with people in russia , they know language this is dead for a long time . 
  in addition , they 've never had a lot in common with the russians , it 's just a soviet myth . 
   because there are no help for unemployed non-citizens . 
  there is also no help for unemployed citizens , or refuges for that matter . 
  it 's not like i 'm taking some high moral ground . 
  homo homini lupus est , survival of the fittest , that is how we roll here . 
  what i 'm pointing out is that refugees in russia are basically unemployed hobos and they are treated as such by both the public and the state . 
  nothing on the page you linked to comes off as a contradiction to what / u/hokkeyfiend said . 
  in moscow alone , there are hundreds dying in the streets every goddamn winter . 
  i have to admit that it 's quite entertaining to read about the doom and gloom surrounding the european refugee crisis . 
  i mean , it 's been more than 20 years since the beginning of uncontrolled migration from islamic republic/countries to mainland russia . 
  so , watching the unfolding situation in europe is a bit like looking at the past through the crystal ball or something to that effect :d i believe the eu countries will eventually get their shit together and manage to establish proper registration procedures . 
  all in all , that would be a win-win scenario for everyone , including refugees . 
  if russian authorities are willing to cooperate ( supposedly this is the case ) , then there will be no problems with identification of refugees . 
  i 'm not sure about fingerprints , but it 's 100 % that russia 's visa centers have got refugees ' photos , even though it might be not required by the immigration law . 
  just out of security concerns . 
   the survey does n't delve into the possible reasons for this soviet union nostalgia , whether respondents remember it fondly as the halcyon days of their history , or if things have just taken a turn for the worse since it 's collapse . 
  wow , what would be the most likely reason for the nostalgia ? 
   the nostalgia for soviet times is most pronounced amongst older generations of russians , the poll shows . 
  pew explains that `` about seven-in-ten russians age 50 and older ( 71 percent ) characterize the end of the soviet union as a great misfortune . '', 
  ahh , there you go . 
  those who submitted a draft of the proposed law to the parliament , methinks . 
  `` a very educated population '' is one of these myths about russia that i often run into . 
  honestly , i have no idea where it 's coming from . 
  according to [ the un data ] ( http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/education-index ) , rufed was ranked \\ # 57 in the global education index . 
  so , russia got ranked number 12 ? 
  i can live with that . 
  dammit , brits !, 
  it 's taken me a while to realize that `` no 10 '' is a colloquial term for the office of the british pm . 
  from what i gather from the news , the situation with polish media reminds me of that of russian media in the early 2000s . 
  i believe it can be reversed unless it goes too far . 
  the guy who wrote this passage has gone full eastern europe with this one . 
  everyone and their grandma know the everything that could go wrong in ee went wrong due to the clandestine russian influence . 
  having a boogieman outside always comes in handy . 
  as the old saying goes : '' [ we 've ] never been wealthy , so it 's not even worth trying to get there . '', 
  a new passport could n't make one an ethnic russian . 
  and if by `` right before '' you meant `` last twenty years or more '' then it would be factually correct . 
   russia won a war with georgia in 2008 , driving georgian forces away from the separatist region of south ossetia . 
  the kremlin asserts that it is protecting the interests of ethnic russians in those areas . 
  mmm , this is prolly the first time i hear this line of reasoning . 
  ethnic russians ? 
  in ossetia ? 
  like all three of them ? 
  i guess the author has it mixed up with crimea .
