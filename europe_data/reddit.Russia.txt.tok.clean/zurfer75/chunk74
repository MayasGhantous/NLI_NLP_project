  i do n't get your point . 
  praising stalin is legal here . 
  given the sad state of affairs , who would not have done that ? 
  fair enough . 
  that being said , iirc , about a half of those who are named on the list of banned persons are members of the l/dnr militia ( ex-military and the likes ) . 
  many of them can be tried for war crimes , so i doubt they care about travel bans , to be honest . 
  okay , let 's tone it down a notch . 
  i actually see where you 're coming from . 
  granted , strangling someone at a slow pace is way better than engaging in open conflict . 
  but it does n't get them on your side , y' know . 
  i said it many times before and it ca n't hurt to say it once more : the western hopes are based on the false premise that the next govt is going to be western-friendly or , at least , pandering to the west 's demands . 
  i live here but i honestly do n't see this happening until , maybe , some completely unexpected scenario . 
  given that it 's happening in penza , locals supposedly do n't give a damn . 
  the communist party and its voters are special snowflakes . 
  i find it rather amusing that a business owner , of all people , would choose stalin as a role model . 
  this country is full of freaks . 
  a local businessman opened a private shrine devoted to the murderous tyrant . 
  while i ca n't endorse his worship of stalin , it 's not that the dude has no right to spend the money as he pleases . 
  well , instead of advocating for measures that will most likely harm innocent people , why do n't you come visit your congressman and launch a petition aimed at our corrupted officials who own a whole bunch of real estate in miami ? 
  oops , sorry , i forgot that the glorious us of a can not lift a finger against the rich . 
  that would be against your very principles of society . 
  granted , i 'm not bold enough to speak for the entirety of russia , but the meds i take are made in germany . . 
  except i was referring to the following part of lolmonger 's comment :  make it impossible for the average russian to buy or get anything coming from europe : i 'm aware of what the government is doing , thank you for caring . 
  not to mention that the import of drugs is not banned yet and , most likely , never will be . 
   food , clothing , antibiotics , student visas , computers/phones , vehicles , medical instruments , etc. 
  yeah , right . 
  i 'm on medications since the age of 5 and depriving me of that stuff will most definitely put me 6 feet under in a matter of days . 
  thank you for letting me know what an average american would have in mind for us . 
  that 's ... refreshing .

  military force is an element of influence and control . 
  no country likes to lose control . 
  sanctions that they imposed on the financial and banking sectors , making business with russian nationals and companies as unpredictable as walking in a minefield . 
  granted , many of these efforts have yet to come to fruition , but one should n't underestimate the impact that it may have on the country 's economy . 
  the size of the middle class has shrunk to just 15 % over the last year . 
  over the course of this year , we will see more than a half of the population living below the poverty line . 
  having said that , the sanctions is only part of a bigger picture , of course . 
  that 's the point . 
  i assume that the west tends to think of russia as of a bigger version of ukraine . 
  which is far from truth . 
  the country is extremely divided along the ethnic , religious and alignment lines . 
  as far as we can see , the western-leaning part of society does n't even make a significant percentage of the population , and the rift grows wider and deeper as we speak . 
  the 90s , when the liberals were successfully selling their narrative to the people , are over . 
   putin 's regime would be dead and it would be the russians who killed it . 
  this line of thinking - if there 's one - is based on the premise that the next government should be more western-friendly than the present one . 
  why the west is so out of touch with reality when it comes to russia is beyond me . 
  no , you 're thinking of sohr .
