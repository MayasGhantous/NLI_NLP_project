  it is quite insane to even think that the dutch conservatives would have supported russia in the conflict . 
  are there any chances that they are doing it just to spite the eu ? 
  i can not see any other explanation . 
  now i see where the dwarves came from . 
  thank you for putting things into perspective , really appreciated .

  finally , some context . 
  thank you !, 
  op , could you please tell me what the heck i 'm watching ? 
  what are the odds that the results of the upcoming referendum will not be taken into account ? 
  i was under impression that the tragedy of mh17 along with the russo-ukrainian quarrel should have caused a shift in public opinion . 
  i 'm curious why are the dutch so dead set against the agreement . 
  it 's not that ukraine is joining the eu tomorrow , just the first step on a long journey .

  the reserves have not been refilled since the 70s . 
  chances are , a hedgehog taken from the army freezer will be older than me : /, 
  i appreciate the recipe !, 
  what about a canine smell ? 
  will putting garlic into it be enough to remove the odor from the hedgehog meat ? 
  i have to stress it again . 
  how turkey is going to cope with the loss is not of my concern . 
  it 's russian tourists who are to be sanctioned . 
  tours to turkey/egypt were cheap . 
  se asia , on the other hand , is not . 
  most of the `` local destinations '' are overpriced , to put it lightly . 
  sochi is overcrowded in the summer . 
  do n't even get me started on karelia or baikal . 
  there 's no sunlight out there . 
  no problem, 
  good news . 
  the taste of dried hedgehogs is something that i would never get used to . 
  not so long distance from siberia and the far east . 
  cleaning ladies are not going anywhere but home for vacations . 
  i know jack shit about the russia-egypt relations , but i do n't think that the government gives a flying one about the egyptian tourism industry . 
  they have too many other problems to care about . 
  meddling in other people 's lives ? 
  why not . 
  the government is at liberty to do as they please . 
  especially in this case , when they enjoy the popular support of the masses they represent . 
  the following link should do the job : https://imgur.com/a/narhc,

  perhaps it would be different if the russians were more active on the international websites , instead of spending most of the time in the russian-speaking bubble of runet . 
  the rostourism 's official data tells us the following numbers for 2014 [ [ link ( xls ) ] ] ( http://www.russiatourism.ru/data/file/statistika/2015/%d0%92%d1%8b%d0%b5%d0%b7%d0%b4%20%d0%b8%d0%b7%20%d0%a0%d0%a4%20%d1%82%d0%be%d0%bf%2050%202014.xls ) : - travelled outside of rufed ( including the former soviet republics ) : 45.193.613 - travelled as tourists : 17.403.433 the same numbers for the first 9 months of 2015 are 29.333.387 and 9.995.472 respectively .

  ps : _ leningradsi _ drive for shopping to finland . 
  not sure if it counts as a trip to a `` foreign '' country , hehe . 
  turkey and egypt - [ 63,4 % in 2015 ] ( http://www.atorus.ru/news/press-centre/new/32873.html ) . 
  as for your first doubt : what makes you think that the real aim is to hurt turkey somehow ? 
  i 'm fairly sure they will cope with the loss . 
  knowing the reputation of my compatriots , the announcement : `` there 's no russians in our hotel !, 
  ! 11 '' would make a great advantage for many turkish resorts .
