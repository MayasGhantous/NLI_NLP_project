  esp in the eyes of the westerners . 
  the only ones who would be really hurt is the horny turkish guys - no more slutty natashas to them !, 
   as for the second one ... 
  selling tours to turkey is already prohibited . 
  the business licenses of some of the biggest travel agencies ( about 40 % of the russian travel market , iirc ) were recently revoked by the state . 
  it was said that they 've had turkish owners all along or something to that effect . 
  granted , if you are savvy enough in the internet , english and whatnot then you 'll be able to book a room online and buy a plane ticket on your own . 
  how many do you think of the ordinary russian holidaymakers are capable to make it ? 
  i would say , not so many of those who used to go to turkey before . 
  population wise , russia is situated between bangladesh and japan . 
  so , there must be another reason why the russians ' view of themselves is so skewed . 
  how is it , exactly ? 
   the sad truth is that most russians wo n't care very much about being cut off from the world -- according to a 2012 study by moscow 's levada centre , fully 80 % of russians have never travelled outside the former soviet union and only 5 % speak a foreign language at conversational level . 
  [ newsweek | russia isolated as putin breaks from the west ] ( http://europe.newsweek.com/russias-isolation-putin-breaks-west-265242?rm=eu ) i bet the vast majority of the rest have never been anywhere else apart from aforementioned turkey , egypt or thailand . 
  so , no biggie . 
  nothing ridiculous or stupid about it . 
  their goal is to cut as many informal ties as possible . 
  turkey along with egypt had had the lion 's share of holidaymakers from russia for the last decade or so . 
  now it 's gone . 
  the next target is se asia , namely thai and vietnam . 
  and once they achieve it ( prolly by pulling some nasty shit ) - ta-dam !, 
  - all the sheep go to crimea and sochi , while keeping dollars in the local economy . 
  big city life and westernization -  less children . 
  aside from checnhya , does it really matter ? 
  from what i gather , siberian minorities are overtly patriotic and they are prolly more `` russian '' , in terms of cultural consciousness , than all those western-leaning , decadent urban russians from the western part of the country . 
  from all of my friends , only one family dared to have two kids . 
  it 's a new normal state of affairs . 
  still , 1.75 is above than that of the eu ( 1.6 , iirc ) . 
  so , we 're bound to `` go extinct '' together , hehe . 
  anyways , i 'm not sure that 's something we should be boasting about . 
   as per the 2010 census , [ 7 ] ethnic russians make up 56.6 % of the republic 's population , with the ethnic altai people numbering only 34.5 % . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/altai_republic#demographics ), 
   as of 2014 , russian tfr of 1.750 children per woman [ 8 ] was the highest in eastern , southern and central europe . 
  in 2013 , russia experienced the first natural population growth since 1990 at 22,700 people . 
  taking into account immigration , the population grew by 294,500 people . 
  [ 9 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_russia, 
  an occupied country gets their seat at the un ? 
  yeah , it 's entirely believable . 
  if it came to fight , who would be stronger , reuters or independent ?

   one of the most famous finds at the pazyryk valley of the ukok plateau in the altai mountains , siberia , south of the modern city of novosibirsk , russia , is the pazyryk carpet , which is probably the oldest surviving carpet in the world .
