  you are spot on about the timing and reasons behind the raise of religious extremism in northern caucasus . 
  having said that , the region never struck me as a peaceful la-la land . 
  when i was a kid , i used to spend my summer time in kislovodsk , and i remember so well how the locals were scared shitless if they had to go outside the city limits after dark .

  i know right ?!, 
  there 's a commie mole right before their eyes !, 
  several cohorts have been banned from traveling over the last few years and many more to come . 
  the permits would be a bit overkill ... for the time being . 
  i was more thinking about soft , indirect ways to keep the population ` grounded ' , such as hiking up prices on plane tickets or stopping direct flights to the popular holiday destinations ( already there ) . 
  it 's unlikely there will be any russian tourists in the foreseeable future . 
  except for officials and their families . 
  the travel ban will most likely be implemented in a few months time . 
   i have yet to see an effective putinbot on reddit .

  i stand corrected , thanks a lot !, 
  indeed , but the thing is that there was a huge push to leave the former republics ' borders intact . 
  not everyone was happy with that notion . 
  let 's stick to the topic . 
  i was making a point about the american involvement into the process of the soviets dissolution . 
  the necessity of having buffer states around russia and other post-yeltsin era irredentist rhetoric have nothing whatsoever to do with my comment . 
  the regime is taking precautions for the upcoming war . 
  the government has just tightened up hard currency controls , `` to counter terrorism and money laundering '' , of course . 
  they issued a worldwide travel warning , `` in order to ensure the safety of the russian citizens '' . 
  2016 is promising to deliver . 
  do n't be so grumpy . 
  it reads as a piece of some tom clancy 's novel !, 
  i have to admit that this is primarily interesting to me as to someone who took part in the august 1991 events .

  my point is that ghwb * was by no means impartial in orchestrating the whole debacle of the soviets . 
  i never said it was dictate , jesus people , what 's wrong with you . 
  advising , encouraging , _ meddling _ - you name it . 
  i would say that yeltsin and kravchuk , led ( or advised ) by ghwb * , successfully outfoxed gorby , who was not particularly fond of the notion of the ussr 's breakup .

  haha , that 's always funny when something named ` american-interest ' tells me how paranoid the russians are . 
  however , there 's one particular paragraph that i would like to put under scrutiny :  as for the post-soviet borders that russian nationalists find so grossly unjust , they were drawn not in washington or brussels , but in moscow , and the west had no input into them whatsoever . 
  there was no diktat like versailles or trianon . 
  victoria nuland was not serving up sandwiches at belovezha . 
  true that . 
  mrs nuland was going into kindergarten back then . 
  but that hardly means that the u.s. had no part in the dissolution of the ussr . 
  which is not a bad thing per se , make no mistake . 
  i was a strong admirer of yeltsin and the soviet system was bound to crumble anyway . 
  i just do n't like that some pricks from the internet are trying to make a fool of me .

  he quietly passed away due to a medication overdose instead of getting tortured to death by his compatriots . 
  from that perspective , he is a lucky dog . 
  there 's a widespread notion among the putin worshippers that everyone who dares to speak in behalf of the west ( or ukraine for that matter ) is a traitor of the nation and deserves nothing but to be dead .
