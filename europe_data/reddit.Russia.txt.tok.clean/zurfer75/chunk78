  none of my friends here are catholics , so i 'm gon na be drinking alone all day . 
  cheers !,

  that 's what you pay guides for - to help you in avoiding dangerous situations . 
  for a lone foreigner without a basic knowledge of russian ? 
  absolutely yes . 
  having said that , moscow is by and large ok-ish but still , there are plenty of bad places . 
  i can relate to that feeling , if we exclude russia from equation . 
  as for what 's going on here ... 
  i would n't be so sure about safety . 
  that was meant to be a dark joke ; by no means moldova is some sort of syria or the likes . 
  sadly , the border guards are pain in the ass in places like this . 
  depends on how much your family might be able to pay in ransom for you .

  in other words , a stunning benjamin per head . 
  yeah , sure , this would have kept us all alive for the entire decade . 
  what a pity that the paris club of creditors had never heard about the initiative ; otherwise russia would have not defaulted on paying the soviets debts . 
  are you aware that the western food aid was , in fact , being sold in shops ? 
  could we please just stop pretending that the west has ever given a flying one about the people living here ? 
  there was an american flag , as a sign of the bloody cargo cult `` the west will help us '' , in every goddamn moscow pub . 
  yeah , that totally happened . 
  shh , must keep our secrets unrevealed until the gates of minas morgul are thrown open !, 
  obviously it was not the same . 
  just saying that a foreign support of secessionist / revolutionary movements is not unheard of in history . 
  quite the contrary . 
  the plummeting currency and burning reserves pose no threat to the dearest leader or the governing system that he managed to build . 
  they are massively cutting the social spending together with raising the indirect taxes to compensate the government for the shrinking oil revenue . 
   there was no country larger and more powerful than britain sending arms , money and manpower to the ira [ noraid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noraid ) ?
