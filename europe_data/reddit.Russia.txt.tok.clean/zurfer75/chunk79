  i take it you never had to worry about meeting specific requirements for some [ relatively ] old piece of hardware . 
  i mean , when you open a pdf file and read something like : required os : windows 95 and then you notice some ` driver.vxd ' in the installation folder . 
  and then you go like : ` oh crap ! ', 
  for instance , in the mid 00s , i was using a professional digital video player ( this is a device that provides playback of an uncompressed sd stream ) . 
  guess what was inside the box ? 
  pc dos 3.3 , as a controller os . 
  it worked perfectly , not a single crash or freeze had occurred ever since . 
  tl ; dr : new versions are made for gamers , 
  old news .

   those few who really went prison were sentenced under ` violent resistance to police ' articles not anymore .

  as far as i know ( can not be more specific on this topic ) , a typical nuclear plant information management system is divided into several isolated networks , each one for a different purpose . 
  it 's nearly impossible to plant a virus or a root kit into the reactor controlling subsystem . 
  my knowledge in that field is quite limited , but in my understanding , this is nothing wrong with using outdated operating systems in the industrial applications . 
  after all , this is most likely an informational terminal ; its purpose is providing an operator guy with the telemetry data or something to that effect . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , making significant changes in the constitution requires a country-wide referendum . 
  the current version was written in the early 90s . 
  george satarov , one of the authors of the constitution , was reportedly detained during the protest held on dec , 12 , a russia 's constitution day . 
  clearly , he totally had it coming , should have not written that annoying document . 
  that 's exactly why they do this . 
  people may go desperate when they realize , all of a sudden , how poor they are . 
  do n't be afraid . 
  the government just needs pretext for closing the border with finland . 
  they ca n't stand these pesky _ pitertsi _ who commute to finland on weekends .

  not when they 're busy pounding the yemenis . 
  duma is an oppressive tool of the ruling elite and hence there is always a gap between what they say and what they think . 
  as for the majority of people being homophobic and backward , that has always been like this here . 
  not a big deal . 
  i do n't even bother to check whether it 's true or not . 
  `` levada center '' is a joke too but their results are nowhere near as nonsensical as \u0412\u0426\u0418\u041e\u041c 's are . 
  [ [ ru ] ] ( http://www.levada.ru/old/09-10-2015/otklonyayushcheesya-povedenie ) , [ [ en ] ] ( http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/most-russians-want-homosexuals-liquidated-or-ostracized--poll/538389.html ) state duma is nothing to joke about , of course . 
  their opinion is the only thing that matters . 
  ps : i just do n't get how `` not all russians '' is related to the results of opinion polls but oh whatever .
