  a statement that i live in russia can be easily proved using the [ moscow 's first snow of the year !, 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2abjccr.png ) winter is almost here . 
  the idea that russians have some kind of hive mind seems ridiculous for me . 
  let alone the relevance of infamous 86 % of putin 's support . 
  there are still millions those openly disagree with the regime , even 14 % out of 140 millions are not so few . 
  i 'm guessing that many of critics live in big cities and their opinion has more weight than opinion of usually apathetic people from rural areas . 
  full archive containing leaked documents floats in runet . 
  the price i mentioned is intended for top lj bloggers , as far as i heard . 
  i do n't get you . 
  could you please be more specific ? 
  i 'm following similar thread on a private site . 
  one member said that russian navy submarines were n't involved in any incidents in the recent time . 
  and this boat can possess of the russian intel or even though a private company . 
  it 's only rumor , of course . 
  absolute majority uses only russian social networks ( odnoklassniki or vk ) , mail and messenger . 
  so , you 're right , they deserve what they got . 
  if it sank in a deep place then r.i.p. 
  the crew . 
   russian idiots on reddit haha , you 're so naive , mate . 
  some of those `` idiots '' are too lazy to come up with new nicknames . 
  they write in runet as well on reddit , and they 're keeping up the same agenga in either place . 
  my poor knowledge of english does n't give me an opportunity to judge their force of persuasion here . 
  believe me , they look very reasonable and intelligent bloggers when they write in russian . 
  many of these `` idiots '' are just eternal vacationers in s-e asia or immigrants in the western countries . 
  after all , it 's a work of dream - you need nothing but laptop and public wi-fi . 
  just a fact : one of the top bloggers in runet gets 1k of euros per one post . 
  this information was leaked not so long ago . 
  [ aftonbladet live ] ( http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/live/2/ ) - photo , video , live streaming is going on right now !, 
  wow , i appreciate your input !, 
  also , [ warship hnlms zeeland ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3682ey2.jpg ) from netherlands follows logachev . 
  * that escalated quickly !, 
  * edit : russian [ ministry of defence ] ( http://mil.ru ) said today at noon that nothing unusual is going on .

  i used to read these pieces of a newspaper before hmm proper use . 
  it was like a puzzle made from news articles . 
  your accusation is ridiculous . 
  did you even read the comment of / u/trycatch1-with-russia - flair , mr noflair ? 
  that 's what he said is a evidence ** against ** russia . 
  if buk came from russia , shot down the plane and then came back then russia is proven guilty . 
  perhaps , you should go back to / r/worldnews , where you belong ? 
  or choose a flair , for a start ? 
  actually , it 's not an insult . 
  amount of toilet paper in a sausage is a running joke of soviet 's time . 
  it 's just a measure of quality . 
  fortunately , young people do n't get it . 
  unfortunately , i 'm old enough to use that joke on a daily basis when bitching about wrong color of meat :(, 
   get soft and decadent in a few generations . 
  that or that they just get bored from the lack of challenge . 
  well , you hit the nail on the head . 
  i guess many things depend on the social environment . 
  whether they stay within diaspora or going abroad to work as a mercenary - nothing good will come of this . 
  if they will attempt to integrate in the society then you get another group of strong men as a result , it should be fine . 
  the main problem with inhabitants of the northern caucasus is that they often confuse politeness and weakness . 
  also , well-known muslims ' attitude towards women does n't require an explanation . 
  i 've no idea what can be done . 
  to be honest , russia is n't the best place to live nowadays . 
  i 'd rather say it is so hostile , so man should be tough to survive though . 
  they say here : `` if you live among wolves you have to howl like a wolf '' . 
  i believe that living in a better place would make one a better person . 
  ok , i just hope so , heh . 
  i was involved in a small business in the 90s , here , in moscow . 
  so , i met those guys and know their habits at first hand . 
  since then i hate them with passion and afraid of them as fuck at the same time . 
  they had been controlling almost 4th part of the city in those times . 
  killings , abductions , rapes , ( sex ) slavery , human trafficking - they were all sports champions , let alone jihad activities at home , in chechnya . 
  just one fact : while russian mafia was a boogeymen for the western world , chechens was going on safari to russia . 
  literally . 
  and still do to some extent . 
  another thing : they count russians as inferior relatives . 
  they are wolves , russians are dogs . 
  `` kill their men , rape their women '' chechens say . 
  also , they have some kind of respect to russians because russia conquered chechnya at war . 
  perhaps , they 're the most dangerous people in the world . 
  chechens as a nation are a common problem for many countries . 
  do you know , btw , that the top commander of isis is an ethnic chechen who was bearing a georgian last name before ? 
  forget about his accepted arabic name . 
  many jihadists do the same thing . 
  in chechnya , as in russia , many people are unhappy with the policies of the dictator . 
  the big difference lies in consequences . 
  in chechnya , if your family/clan becomes an opposition to kadyrov then men have a good chance to go directly to heaven , and girls ... we all know . 
  these people have no other way than flee abroad , away from russia as well , because forces of kadyrov can reach them even in moscow . 
  of course , these refugees are n't any better than other chechens . 
  they 've just picked a wrong side at home . 
  perhaps they change their habits in europe , idk . 
  i 'm not sure if i was looking for advice but thank you anyway . 
  you 're an idiot , man . 
  these refugees are chechens . 
  do n't send them to moscow , we have plenty of them right here . 
  too many for the city , i 'd say . 
  russians ca n't apply to a refugee status , except gays , maybe . 
  do wait until the official beginning of the war then go painting a big `` welcome '' poster , am omw , haha . 
  yes , he has . 
  according to [ wiki ] ( https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ccuqfjac&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2fislam_in_russia&amp;ei=bylcvkkddywf7gad9yggbg&amp;usg=afqjcngh67vejlyxuzo93qnde6uw4garjw&amp;sig2=t8tpkrua8hpqxrjlj65pqa&amp;bvm=bv.77648437,bs.1,d.d2s ) , muslims make up 14 % of population . 
  also , there 's conscription in russia . 
  actually , muslims along with inhabitants of rural areas and small towns are more encouraged to join army than residents of big cities . 
  in these cases it is one of the best ways to make a career . 
  in a big city you can a ) hide a ) go to uni c ) get money for bribing officials more easily . 
   russian version of sarah palin i 'd rather say he 's a younger version of zhirinovsky . 
  the latter promised that `` russian soldier will wash the boots in the indian ocean '' 15 or so years ago . 
  clowns allowed to be among high rank politicians in russia .
