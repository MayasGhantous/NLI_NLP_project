  the quality of representation has been deteriorating gradually since the early 00s ( maybe even earlier ) . 
  truth be told , we had it coming . 
  apathetic approach to elections does n't make any good . 
  the voting system lacks some crucial parts , such as unrestricted access of potential candidates to the mass media or providing security to independent observers . 
  by no means it could be trusted in its present state . 
  the protests were the biggest since the early nineteens , by the way . 
  that did n't come out of the blue : the protests were incited by the massively rigged elections . 
  at that point it did n't matter how many of the votes were tainted by fraud . 
  i doubt that . 
  they 've been a pain in the ass from the very beginning .

  has it been done in the civilized manner ( by stirring up the pot : funding the secession movement , organizing rallies and people 's gatherings , bribing mps and authorities , covert operations etc ) , there would have been no need in any armed `` polite men '' . 
  this is a pretty reliable ( albeit small ) news source . 
  it 's just worth remembering that meduza is founded and launched by the former lenta.ru team after the [ firing of a key figure ( chief editor ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lenta.ru ) . 
  hence the strong opposition bias . 
  sorry , i 've mixed up the terms . 
  obviously , i meant a chairwoman of the board . 
  what do you even mean that the `` russia '' bank is not state-owned ? 
  does it make any difference if a bank owned by `` the family '' instead of the state ? 
  the same goes to sogaz and the likes .

  yeah , but thinking that they 're going to willingly give up their power is delusional , to put it mildly . 
  that 's what i 'm talking about . 
  on top of that , no one will be making investments into a post-war / post-revolution economy . 
  so , we 're in a sort of `` loose-loose '' situation here . 
   but perhaps she did not mean the remark to be taken at face value . 
  later in the day , dobryakova said on her facebook page that russian news service misinterpreted her comment , which was intended as sarcasm . 
  she confirmed , however , that disruptions of fabric imports from turkey have presented a major problem for russian clothes manufacturers . 
   `` got a call from rsn [ russian news service ] , asking me whether i planned to make shirts with anti-turkish themes , '' dobryakova said on her facebook page . 
  `` i said , sarcastically , that as soon as trucks from turkey are allowed across the border , i will immediately do so . '' rsn fabricating fake news is not surprising . 
  it 's their job as a state owned source of propaganda . 
  what 's really interesting is that `` the moscow times '' and meduza.io published it without checking the facts . 
  it 's also worth mentioning that dobryakova reportedly made t-shirts for the last anniversary celebration of `` dozhd '' , the very last opposition tv channel that is being raided by the prosecutors as we speak . 
  looks to me like a successful ( looking at the comments in runet and here on reddit ) attempt of the intentional defamation of said designer . 
  `` amputated '' as in `` chopped off with a rusty axe '' ? 
  for the record , my point of view is in no way representing the general public 's opinion . 
  i fail to see anything good in the illegal land grab and waging war of aggression . 
  hopefully , so do most people i know . 
  as for the russian claims on crimea ... well , it 's a bit more complicated , at least in part of _ claims _ , y' know . 
  if the dearest leader was so eager about crimea 's accession to rufed , he should 've done it using political means instead of rough power . 
  sadly , most of my friends have still yet to see this as a huge fuck up of the regime . 
  #crimeaisours , in a broad sense of the word , is the most successful media virus of the last few years . 
  people are too stubborn to admit that we 're loosing in this game ; they simply refuse to see a fuckload of negative consequences behind that decision . 
  your point being ? 
  the retailer has already issued an apology over selling these cutting boards , they said it was caused by negligence - [ lenta.ru ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2015/12/10/obamaface/ ), 
  it 's doubtful . 
  in all likelihood , they 're going to uphold the sanctions after a bit of posturing . 
  given the circumstances , even such a simple gesture is gold . 
  it 's four years late for a peaceful transition of power in rufed . 
  be careful with what you wish for , so to speak . 
  still , something must be done about that . 
  the situation is not sustainable in the long run . 
  is n't that what the west wants , the regime change and all that stuff ?

  [ lenta.ru ] ( http://lenta.ru/news/2015/12/08/crimea1/ ), 
   last week three communist party activists in the same city were fined 10,000 rubles ( $ 150 ) each for laying flowers at a monument to soviet leader vladimir lenin . 
  the court ruled they were guilty of organizing an unauthorized rally , the interfax news agency reported . 
   the activists were detained after they placed flowers at the monument to mark lenin 's birthday on april 22 . 
  it 's almost funny .
