  i 'm wondering how it all worked behind the scenes : `` petrov !, 
  the nato pigdogs are out to get us again !, 
  grab an igla and off to the upper deck you go ! '', 
  `` yes , sir ! '', 
  `` blyat , it 's a tad windy up there . 
  petrov , put a coat on . 
  i do n't want you to freeze your ass off . '', 
  `` ah , commander , you 're so caring ! '', 
   boris volfman  the ukrainian-born israeli citizen russian as fuck . 
  it 's related to the headline of the thread , specifically in part of `` perpetrated by russian communists '' . 
  sadly , it seems that young ukrainians know next to nothing about their country 's history . 
  what does it have to do with a quote from the * kiev * court 's decision ? 
  not to mention that not all `` russians '' think alike .

  my favourite quotes from op ( / u/mandatoryaids ) : [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2syu7n/russian_forces_enter_ukraine/cnu8amo ) \\  we should have broken russians into pieces in 1991 [ [ 2 ] ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2teoxb/cnn_no_truce_with_ukraine_rebel_leader_says/cnysgw3 ) \\  or just all russians on earth ingesting strychnine since nothing else seems to stop them from being the pustulent cancer of the planet . 
  just a thought . 
  [ [ 3 ] ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2z43f9/fox_news_military_analyst_under_fire_for_saying/cpfl5mk ) \\  i disagree . 
  killing russians , all of them , will solve everything . 
  [ [ 4 ] ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3u2now/putin_calls_turkey_accomplices_of_terrorists/cxbibcy ) \\   * there is no reason to shoot at them * \\  yes there is . 
  they were russian . 
  [ [ 5 ] ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3u77ez/syrian_and_russian_special_forces_have_rescued/cxckkes ) [ about the rescued russian pilot ] \\  here 's hoping he dies soon . 
  the boy should seek help asap , haha . 
  sadly , many people seem to have trouble recognizing sarcasm .

  yep , natali tours and tez-tour have stopped selling tours to turkey today . 
  imo , the situation is more simple than that . 
  turkey was the second most popular holiday destination among the russians ( assuming it 's not anymore ) . 
  flights to egypt has been banned recently . 
  next step is shutting down the flights to europe , coz muh terrorism and stuff . 
  the glorious leader 's primary goal is to land as much people as possible within the country borders . 
  firstly , he needs these lovely dollars at home , secondly he needs the maximum manpower before the war begins . 
  the siege mentality is also very , very useful when you need to convince your people that they should be ready to die for the ambitions of the elite . 
  no , i 'm not arguing , just asking for examples . 
  lies produced by the propaganda machine are mostly aimed at the domestic audience , they usually do n't fly well in the west . 
   there was a lot of circlejerking in comments when i saw the thread in question on / r/worldnews , there were hardly any comments at all . 
  care to provide a link ? 
  from the article you linked :  on the night of 5 january 1991 , 6,000 armed georgians entered tskhinvali . 
  after fierce street fighting , the georgian forces were repelled and driven out of tshkinvali by south ossetian troops . 
  [ 12 ]  as a result of the war , approximately 100,000 ethnic ossetians fled from the south ossetian a.o. 
  and georgia proper , and 23,000 ethnic georgians fled from the south ossetian a.o. 
  into ethnically georgian areas . 
  100 villages were reportedly destroyed in south ossetia by both sides . 
  additionally , the north ossetia-georgian border went largely uncontrolled , providing an almost unhindered access point for weapons , fighters , and ammunition in both directions . 
  [ 13 ] so , what did happen there ? 
  the story will go the full circle then . 
  i mean , [ `` rotenbergs are worse then isis '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aj8wy1namc ) , that is . 
   blogspam ( if stolen content/direct copy ) - original news content on blogs is fine , but the largely copy-pasted stuff from earlier articles with a short line or paragraph of commentary is not . 
  the situation is still unfolding and the outcome remains to be seen . 
  i wonder if the truck drivers will manage to paralyze traffic on mkad , as they 're now planning .

  well , israel is a first world country , right ? 
  noblesse oblige of something to that effect . 
  and scotland was too sloshed to notice what was coming , otherwise she could have stepped aside . 
  because israel is being held to a higher standard than countries like ukraine or russia . 
  collecting kickbacks , as they supposed to do ?

  it 's doubtful that the government was voluntarily involved in the process . 
  just an ordinary corruption scheme . 
  mutko and the likes are paying lip service now , as someone in the ministry of sports was caught red-handed , and they most likely think that `` omg le ebil west is out to get us '' is a reasonable line of defence .

  no , it 's not . 
  everyone tends to reduce long words by omitting syllables . 
  the most notable difference between pronunciation in saint petersburg and moscow is that we , muscovites , tend to speak a bit more softly and use the ` a ' vowel instead of ` o ' . 
  rt is being handled on a case-by-case basis .
