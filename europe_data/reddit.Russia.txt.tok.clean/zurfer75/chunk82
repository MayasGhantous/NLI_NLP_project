  the asylum system has its flaws , for sure . 
  not to mention that it 's deeply political at heart . 
  no , i 'm not implying that this particular mullah did nothing wrong , of course . 
  what i 'm trying to explain is that asylum , once granted , is not an immigration visa that can be revoked at any time . 
  if history is anything to go by , we should remember how many people were deemed terrorists or `` enemies of the state '' during , say , the stalin times and where they ended up . 
  the iraqi government could be right on that one ( and it most likely was ) but we do n't know for sure . 
  that was my point . 
  do the crime in norway , do the time in norway . 
  political asylum is a different matter , or at least it should be . 
  i mean , if torture and death penalty as forms of punishment were allowed in norway , and he was sentenced to death , again , in norway - well , i think in that case it would be appropriate to send him back . 
  outsourcing jobs abroad is a common approach nowadays , is n't it ? 
  i 'm afraid you 're overlooking the fact that anyone who lives under oppressive regime can be convicted based on coerced confessions or false accusations . 
  this is political asylum 101 : an oppressive state can not be trusted whatsoever . 
  good news at last .

   a russian democrat  leonid david bershidsky, 
  still , the riots were ended with nothing . 
  i think you 've misread me . 
  `` nashi '' was supposed to become a massive , country-wide youth movement . 
  aaand it 's gone . 
  stopham is fine ... or not , it does n't matter . 
  my point is that stopham is a small group , and their actions are non-political . 
  what is it supposed to mean ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stopham_ ( organization ), 
  most state initiatives in that field are proven to be inefficient . 
  what 's left of the `` nashi '' movement ? 
  all the steam goes into the whistle .

  i do n't think it matters . 
  the bottom line is that abkhazians did essentially the same thing as poles , balts , ukrainians et al. 
  they declared their independence when they were given the chance to do so . 
  op , could you please provide us with the full text ?
