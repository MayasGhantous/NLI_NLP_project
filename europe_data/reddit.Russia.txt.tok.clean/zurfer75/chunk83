  [ 4 ] german support enabled the georgians to repel the bolshevik threat from abkhazia in 1918 . 
  the 1921 constitution granted abkhazia autonomy .

  buses and trolleys have to be on the dedicated `` public transportation '' lanes .

   on 5 may 1992 parliament declared crimea independent [ 2 ] ( which was yet to be approved by a referendum to be held 2 august 1992 [ 11 ] ) and passed the first crimean constitution the same day . 
  ** on 6 may 1992 the same parliament inserted a new sentence into this constitution that declared that crimea was part of ukraine . 
  ** [ 11 ] the ukrainian parliament convened on may 15 , annulled the crimean declaration of independence and gave the crimean parliament one week to cancel the referendum .
