  tatar edit : [ crimea referendum : what does the ballot paper say ? 
  | bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26514797 ), 
  this looks to me like a screenshot from the first `` kyrandia '', 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gagauzia#demographics https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budjak#ethnic_groups_and_demographics are going to insist on your point ? 
  could you please tell me how else should i treat your words :  give civilians 10 days to ** evacuate and execute everyone left ** . 
  as anything other than calls for ethnic cleansing ? 
  [ do my eyes mistake me or that was the second option ?

  advocacy for ethnic cleansing and calls for violence against minorities are not tolerated here . 
  consider this as a warning . 
   identity should n't be dependent maybe it should not , but it _ is _ dependent . 
  in mixed families it quickly fades away and the host culture gains control . 
  integration , goddammit !, 
  from a practical standpoint , it is the most natural way to live . 
  when in rome etc. 
  imagine italians who moved to the u.s. in the early 20th century , how many of their grandchildren can speak italian or consider themselves as italian ? 
  the similar thing happened here : some of my ancestors moved from quite distant areas to the big city and lost any connection with their folk culture . 
  hence the result . 
  i have no hard feelings about that , though . 
  minorities ' cultural heritage is in the books ( in russian ) , after all . 
  it seems you got it backwards . 
  i consider myself russian , despite being part mari . 
  and the guy i mentioned considers himself russian . 
  cultural and linguistic background - that 's what really matters . 
  and by the `` cultural background '' i did n't mean any love to the russian state , especially in its current incarnation . 
  if he 's not making up the entire thing , it 's a knockout story for sure . 
  so , as it 's customary with corrupted officials , the director has been sitting idle for years , getting money for nothing , and failed to successfully complete the task ? 
  and then it bit her in the ass ? 
  i 'd say karma is the bitch .

  81 % of russians is a huge stretch . 
  as a rule of thumb , everyone of somewhat mixed ethnicity falls into that category ( russian ) . 
  i 'm about 1/4 ethnic russian but i consider myself 100 % of that ethnicity . 
  i knew a guy who 's like 100 % komi - the same story . 
  the same goes to many half-tatars etc. 
  source ?

  i see where you 're coming from but i strongly disagree with implications . 
  kudryavstev is well equipped for the job , he was in charge of the `` kommersant '' publisher , goddammit . 
  it 's much worse than anything political . 
  oops , sorry , it seems i misread your comment . 
  you ca n't be serious . 
  take any of the popular news sites , e.g. , lenta.ru or gazeta.ru , you may see that the tone of news articles is mostly neutral ( or even sympathetic , when it comes to non-political issues ) . 
  state-controlled media reveal their bias when they cover sensitive topics , such as nato , ukraine , russia , american politics etc. 
   update : in comments to meduza , abdullaev clarified that the moscow times ' new owner has never interfered with the paper 's content policy and has pledged never to do so in the future . 
  `` my contradictions with him [ kudryavtsev ] , '' abdullaev says , `` are about the division of administrative powers over the editorial office , not about the content policies . '',

   luna 2 hit the moon about 800 kilometres from the centre of the visible disk 1959 september 13 at 21:02:24 ( september 14 at 00:02:24 in moscow ) . 
   on impact , it scattered a quantity of soviet emblems and ribbons across the lunar surface . 
  they were assembled into spheres which broke up on hitting the surface . 
  about 30 minutes later , the final stage of luna 2 's launching rocket made its own crater on the moon . 
  [ luna-2 ] ( http://www.zarya.info/diaries/luna/luna02.php ) the ussr said `` dibs on the moon ! '', 
  wait , is it leaving anywhere ? 
  so soon ? 
  if you read the article you may notice that it 's not the news about europe , and likewise it 's not news at all . 
  it 's about who tony abbott is .
