  apologies , i misunderstood you . 
   right now not only americans surpassed them , but also esa . 
  orly ?

  haha , no . 
  you underestimate russian stubbornness . 
  in addition , the internal insurgency was not really different from is : beheadings , slavery , holding people for ransom , suicide bombings . 
  people got used to this crap a long time ago . 
  it 's far too complicated matter for an average ivan of jakub . 
  even if you are against the gov ' t wrongdoings , it does n't make you less of a russian . 
  that distinction makes no sense whatsoever . 
  countries are made of people . 
  the tie chewer started a war with ossetia . 
  hope you see the difference . 
  except the world politics is not a kindergarten . 
  just saying . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  they have it coming . 
  why ? 
  i just looked it up on wiki . 
  the reason why i asked is that keto_naru made it sound like americans had a space shuttle in garage and it could take a day to roll it out and set it on the launch pad . 
  it 's doubtful that europeans are concerned about the lives of ordinary russians . 
  according to polls , most of them plain hate us . 
  so i do n't really see what 's the problem . 
  so , the thing that they will have in 2017 . 
  way to go . 
  was n't it medvedev who started a war with georgia ? 
  same hell , different devils . 
  both americans and russians have seen each other as enemies for decades . 
  what 's changed ? 
  why you would find that surprising is beyond me . 
  does the u.s. have a manned space program ? 
  the oil & gas bubble is a bubble nonetheless . 
  for instance , gazprom , which is the biggest russian company , makes up about 8 % percent of the economy . 
  its market capitalization dropped from $ 367 bn in 2008 to $ 78 bn in 2013 . 
  many other state-owned companies suck too . 
  already replied . 
  yep , it 's been happening since 2012 . 
  luxury stuff , be it affordable or not , does n't change the whole picture . 
  the upper class has the resources to buy anything they please . 
  dutch disease , on the other hand , is well-known problem of the economy . 
  why bother with manufacturing shit if you could sell fossils ? 
  it 's popping right now , there 's nothing to be afraid of . 
  the size of the economy is going to be corrected to represent reality . 
  that 's it . 
  makes sense . 
  this is what you get when salaries do n't match productivity . 
  one day the bubble goes pop .

  do n't be surprised by authorities ' staggering incompetence . 
  chemistry * has been * the subject to the regulations since forever . 
  iirc , one scientist got 15 years of prison for publishing public domain info on explosives . 
  the vice-rector ( chancellor ? ), 
  of msu [ denied ] ( http://www.interfax.ru/russia/474684 ) that the scientists have to get a permission before publication . 
  so , no idea who is telling the truth . 
  please avoid name calling .

  * form and function are a unity , two sides of one coin . 
  in order to enhance function , appropriate form must exist or be created . 
  * - [ ida p. rolf ] ( http://www.inspirationalstories.com/quotes/form-and-function-are-a-unity-two-of-ida-p-rolf-quote/ ) iirc , descartes also wrote something along these lines . 
  i mean , i can easily imagine this guy tampering the chassis number on the stolen a8l . 
  i would experience cognitive dissonance if he was wearing a suit rather than this t-shirt .

  how do you know they are relatives ? 
  they might simply come from the same planet . 
  - two four-graders were messaging each other : `` so why did we take the yearbooks back [ to the maker ] '' '' [ they need ] to edit out masha from the photo '' - one mom read the messages , went ballistic , took a screenshot and put it on her facebook page along with the sob story she wrote . 
  - shit hit the fan ( online ) - lifenews came up with the news that the teacher 's daughter is being discriminated due to her mental illness - the teacher 's got a nervous break-down , stopped coming to the work - shit went through the roof ( irl ),
