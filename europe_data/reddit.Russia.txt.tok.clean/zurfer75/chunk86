   efforts to protect the united states from the perceived threat of communist subversion were particularly enabled by several federal laws . 
  the alien registration act or smith act of 1940 made it a criminal offense for anyone to `` knowingly or willfully advocate , abet , advise or teach the [ ... ] desirability or propriety of overthrowing the government of the united states or of any state by force or violence , or for anyone to organize any association which teaches , advises or encourages such an overthrow , or for anyone to become a member of or to affiliate with any such association '' . 
  hundreds of communists and others were prosecuted under this law between 1941 and 1957 . 
  eleven leaders of the communist party were convicted under the smith act in 1949 in the foley square trial . 
  ten defendants were given sentences of five years and the eleventh was sentenced to three years . 
  the defense attorneys were cited for contempt of court and given prison sentences . 
  [ 33 ] in 1951 , twenty-three other leaders of the party were indicted , including elizabeth gurley flynn , a founding member of the american civil liberties union . 
  many were convicted on the basis of testimony that was later admitted to be false . 
  [ 34 ] by 1957 , 140 leaders and members of the communist party had been charged under the law , of whom 93 were convicted . 
  that 's the `` circuses '' part . 
  done that . 
  however , mother 's name was disclosed by the moscow times anyway . 
  [ fb page ] ( http://imgur.com/a/hyjqt ) of the mother of one of the students , that 's what caused all the fuss .

  aww , is n't that sweet ? 
  as if we did n't have our fair share of domestic douchebags and were in dire need of importing foreign staff . 
  she would make her career at lifenews , though . 
  they love that kind . 
  thanks , it makes more sense now . 
  truth be told , that was a sensational headline . 
  agreed . 
  on a second thought , the headline could be less sensational , as it gives a wrong impression . 
  this simply means that it 's impossible to know every militant by name . 
  mmm . 
  if they are terrorists , how come they are not the target ? 
  do you mean they were not the _ primary _ targets of the air strikes ? 
  [ nearly 90 percent of people killed in recent drone strikes were not the target ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/civilian-deaths-drone-strikes_561fafe2e4b028dd7ea6c4ff ), 
   president barack obama has admitted that global crises such as ebola , isis and russian aggression have made the world spin so fast , nobody is able to control it . 
  [ dailyfail ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2784702/as-ebola-isis-russia-president-obama-night-admits-there-s-sense-world-spinning-fast-able-control.html ), 
  well , america 's president did say that we 're sitting on the same line with ebola and isis . 
  what do i , as a russian , suppose to think about it ? 
  that was just words spoken by the mr president . 
  he did compare us with the worst of the worst . 
  was expecting a dead sheep in the trunk . 
  anyways , not bad . 
  could be better , though . 
  from the point of view of european authorities , the russian state is not persecuting gays . 
  otherwise it would be possible to get asylum for _ being _ a gay . 
  what i gathered from reading web forums is that the chances are really slim .

  my mother was born in harbin , china . 
  as my grandparents were about to depart to moscow , their chinese partners gave them a gift for the baby - a red flag covered with hieroglyphs . 
  my granddad asked what he was supposed to do with that . 
  the chinese said , `` one day , when you daughter will be a grown up , and the chinese army will take over the city of moscow , she will show the flag to the soldiers and she 'll be fine , because it will let them know that she 's a big friend of all chinese people '' . 
  neither europe nor russia have a clue on the chinese plans .

  is that an excuse for the westerners to be mean to russians ? 
  if so , do n't expect any positive changes in the future . 
  it works both ways and i bet you know it . 
  bitching about the past is not the same as endorsing an ethnic cleansing in the present . 
  expansion of nato is always portrayed ( at least , by the state-owned media ) as aggressive conspiracy of the u.s. . as for china ... 
  i 've yet to meet anyone who really believes in partnership with china . 
  but that 's only anecdotal evidence . 
  the western sanctions are seen as the price to be paid for the annexation . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  honestly , i do n't get what `` we '' do and where . 
  i would n't say no . 
  cheers . 
  as long as they keep visa-free access for russian tourists , i have no objection to that decision , haha . 
  i 've been there this summer and it would be lovely to return there again . 
  mesano meso was a cholesterol bomb , no less . 
  yummy af though .
