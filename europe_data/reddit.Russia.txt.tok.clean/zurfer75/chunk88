  i hate to be that guy but ...  the ukrainian government said on thursday that a russian military plane had shot down a ukrainian fighter jet in ukrainian airspace the previous evening , a serious allegation of direct intervention by russia 's armed forces . 
  [ ny times ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/world/europe/ukraine-says-russian-plane-shot-down-its-fighter-jet.html ) , july 17 , 2014 ( the day mh17 were shot down ) . 
  the ukrainian army did have a solid reason to deploy sam systems to the dnr/lnr borders .

   russia 's rt targets only russian ears and minds except it does n't . 
  i have about 50 channels on my cable ( for free ) but no rt. 
  it 's a prepaid sat/cable/iptv channel .

  imo , the urban/rural differences have a lesser impact on society than the amount of homophobia coming from the south . 
  that 's the price we pay for being part of a truly multicultural and polyethnic but extremely unequal and diverse society . 
  from sheep herders to deer herders , from sharia-ruled villages to cossack 's villages , from adidas-wearing chavs in kemerovo to moscow hipsters - there is no point in expecting them all to be on the same page . 
  btw , when saying `` every fifth russian '' you 're probably picturing someone you seen in the numerous yt polls `` what do average russians think about x ? 
  '' , most of those were filmed ( by pure coincidence , haha ) within the garden ring in moscow . 
  think deeper , man . 
  we 've been at war with terrorism since the day one . 
  then georgia , ukraine , syria ... 
  i mean , come on . 
  i was more addressing another thing : * what do you think should be done with homosexuals ? 
  * | 1989 | 1994 | 1999 | 2003 | 2008 | 2012 | 2015 -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- ` liquidate ' ( exterminate ) them all | 35 | 22 | 15 | 21 | 19 | 23 | 21 ** they must be isolated from society ** | 28 | 23 | ** 23 ** | ** 27 ** | ** 30 ** | ** 31 ** | ** 37 ** they need to be helped | 5 | 8 | 16 | 6 | 9 | 6 | 6 they should be left alone | 9 | 29 | 29 | 34 | 28 | 29 | 24 no idea / no answer | 23 | 17 | 18 | 12 | 15 | 12 | 12 as you can see , the number of people who want to put homosexuals in jail has been growing steadily since the glorious leader became a president . 
  that 's what really matters and this is a thing that can be directly attributed to his authoritarian rule . 
  the number of ` liquidators ' , on the other hand , does n't bother me much . 
  do n't be so upset . 
  who in their right mind would believe these polls ? 
  you ca n't conduct a survey in a totalitarian state at war and expect any reliable results . 
  if they phoned me , i 'd go with ` liqudate ' answer too . 
  this is spartaaaaa ! ^ 1 ^ 1 it was , it no longer is . 
  it does .

  here are the complete results of the poll in question -  [ link ] ( http://www.levada.ru/09-10-2015/otklonyayushcheesya-povedenie ) , if anyone interested . 
  * what do you think should be done with homosexuals ? 
  * | 1989 | 1994 | 1999 | 2003 | 2008 | 2012 | 2015 -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- ` liquidate ' ( exterminate ) them all | 35 | 22 | 15 | 21 | 19 | 23 | 21 they must be isolated from society | 28 | 23 | 23 | 27 | 30 | 31 | 37 they need to be helped | 5 | 8 | 16 | 6 | 9 | 6 | 6 they should be left alone | 9 | 29 | 29 | 34 | 28 | 29 | 24 no idea / no answer | 23 | 17 | 18 | 12 | 15 | 12 | 12, 
  access to alternative information sources , and likewise more young and active population . 
  on top of that , do you remember 90-something % % of votes for the glorious leader in the southern republics ? 
  those republics , there have been no independent observers allowed to monitor the elections for a decade or more . 
  no one knows , in reality , how they voted and if they voted at all . 
  boycotting elections is kinda counterproductive , do n't you think so ? 
  all those babushkas are voting anyway , and he will end up with them shaping his country 's future . 
  i think you 've got it wrong . 
  from the article you linked :  the outflow of capital from russia in 2015 is projected at $ 113 billion < . .  ** world bank chief economist for russia birgit hunsley ** told journalists . 
   according to the latest forecast of ** russia 's economic development ministry ** , capital outflow is expected to reach $ 93 billion in 2015  < . .  the outflow will not exceed $ 80 billion , according to the ** finance ministry ** . 
  those are projected numbers . 
  whereas reuters ' article says :  russia saw a net capital inflow of $ 5.3 billion in the third quarter , central bank data showed on friday < . .   despite the third-quarter figures , russia registered a capital outflow for the first nine months of $ 45 billion < . .  that means q3 has seen a net inflow for a first time since 2010 . 
  how bad will q4 be for the central bank ? 
  it remains to be seen .
