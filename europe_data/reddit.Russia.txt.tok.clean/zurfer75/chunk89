  actual title : `` i 'm too young to die ' : chilling last words of gang rape victim ` butchered by her own family in honour killing ' '' who 's lying here ? 
  if it was a satire i 'm fine with that . 
  i do n't think that living in a tent is a `` better treatment '' . 
  these people are fleeing from war , that 's all that matters . 
  please , do n't go personal . 
  please , do n't go personal .

  't was [ predictable ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3knoi4/for_the_first_time_in_18_months_no_shelling_in/cuyxbe7 ) . 
  aww , thank you !, 
  their username is _ so _ promising , after all . 
  debka is a conspiracy site , is n't it ? 
  ** gb ** : on this day in 1914 , the royal naval air service undertook one of the first ever ** strategic ** bombing runs in history , when the airplanes dropped twenty-pound bombs to the zeppelin base . 
  [ link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strategic_bombing_during_world_war_i#britain ) ** ru ** : on this day in 1892 marina tsvetaeva , one of the greatest russian poets , was born . 
  [ link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marina_tsvetaeva )  her work is considered among some of the greatest in twentieth century russian literature . 
  she lived through and wrote of the russian revolution of 1917 and the moscow famine that followed it . 
  in an attempt to save her daughter irina from starvation , she placed her in a state orphanage in 1919 , where she died of hunger . 
  tsvetaeva left russia in 1922 and lived with her family in increasing poverty in paris , berlin and prague before returning to moscow in 1939 . 
  her husband sergei efron and her daughter ariadna efron ( alya ) were arrested on espionage charges in 1941 ; and her husband was executed . 
  tsvetaeva committed suicide in 1941 . 
  as a lyrical poet , her passion and daring linguistic experimentation mark her as a striking chronicler of her times and the depths of the human condition . 
  that 's where all the money went to . 
  you are spot on about my neighbors . 
  most of the time i barely notice their presence , haha . 
   rublyovka oh , no , no , it 's not * that * near to be counted as moscow suburbs but not * that * far to be in the countryside . 
  something in between , within commuting range of the city . 
  in addition , the two-story log house that did n't get in the picture was built by the bare hands of my family members , including me . 
  not classy enough for rublevka . 
  that level of intimacy is supposed to be reserved for very , * very * , close friends . 
  honestly , i do n't think that sweden is in any danger . 
  despite the fact that our government 's actions are terribly retarded , i 've yet to meet a single person who 's been holding a grudge against your admittedly beautiful country . 
  cheers . 
  near moscow . 
  i would argue if it was absorbed . 
  the peninsula has some serious logistic problems , to say the least . 
  actually , i was talking about ukraine 's policies back in the 90s . 
  it 's absolutely clear that they should have done * much more * than they did to integrate the crimeans into the country .
