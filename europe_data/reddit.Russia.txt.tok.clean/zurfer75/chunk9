  it 's something historical or maybe based on mentality . 
  check out [ foolishness_for_christ ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foolishness_for_christ ) . 
  and they will be like : * this vault was built for masters only , stay away from here , peasant !, 
  a can for vomit is a must-have for those that want to read about russian politics nowadays . 
  like most of people do , i guess . 
  last month i caught myself thinking , that living six miles away of kremlin could be considered as a suicidal tendency , ahaha . 
  something like this . 
  i just remember they said `` although army mobilization is yet to start but a vault in the saint-petersburg 's major office is getting ready to receive president orders in case of war '' . 
  ask putin , mate . 
  he must know this . 
  yeah , no . 
  i 'm a layman , just have been reading russian-speaker 's forum about an economic perspective of russia . 
  there 're already more than 100k comments written since the beginning of the crisis ... tl : dr : it wo n't work , at least not in the way chosen by the government . 
   domestic production become wealthier no , it 's not right . 
  food production needs bank loans , farmers usually have not enough money for a full-year circle . 
  banking system on decline , no cheap loans -  less food , banking system crashed , no loans -  no food at all , because farmer said `` fuck it '' and went home . 
  most russians have no access to information besides promoted by state-owned companies . 
  they ca n't read bloody english , haha . 
  what is interesting , as things go south as some websites from top-20 go more and more anti-putin . 
  i noticed this kind of changes in rbc.ru ( # 4 ) , lenta.ru ( # 7 ) , gazeta.ru ( # 10 ) . 
  of course , they cover an ass with `` editorial opinion doesnt match author 's point of view '' , but still ... 
  meanwhile , television comes more crazy from day to day . 
  last time i checked central channels have been speaking about war and mobilization and vaults in big cities as it 's all uneviteable . 
  educated westernized minority does n't want to die , haha . 
  in a country where 86 % of population went full retard ... poor fucks , they have no other choice . 
  the whole situation reminds me nazi germany before the war . 
  they held a meeting [ at night ] ( http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/754883 ) . 
  usa ? 
  i 'm in !, 
  so , what exactly is the third rome if not moscow ? 
  obey , peasants !, 
  it 's doublespeak , relax . 
  satire . 
   ~ ~ greece ~ ~ bysantia , ftfy, 
  russia might ban anything . 
  subjunctive mood is not the news in case of russia-2014 and further . 
  i 'm not sure i can find the right words to say them . 
  jokes aside , i finally got an opportunity to hate russia/eu/us / ukraine indiscriminately . 
  let the hatred fuel me , haha . 
  roses are red , violets are blue ruble dropped down , thanks putin 's crew !, 
  prices are growing , our people in fear savings lost fifth part , during this year !, 
  when you never gave a vote to putin or his party members . 
  when you 've been going to opposition rallies , believing in democracy and peaceful changes like an idiot . 
  when you pay taxes from minimal wage because fuck 'em they 're already rich . 
  when you 've never been to either ukraine or crimea , and do n't give a damn about the people living there because it is a foreign country for you . 
  you do or you do n't , either way you fucked up . 
  karma is a bitch . 
  moscow .

  redundancy . 
  the true sociopath always stays at home as much as possible . 
  well , i 've already seen three riots . 
  i just wanted to say i do n't think in case of russia these laws will work as planned . 
   you ca n't exactly bribe the fbi . 
  mind you , it 's the best part . 
  if your local cops went retard then you can always call the fbi or maybe some federal police department . 
  we have a department of inner investigations in the russian police but it fails sometimes and they can be bribed as well . 
  it 's interesting how local communities can work out their own rules in the usa . 
  it seems by head and shoulders above centralized management . 
  for instance , most of russian villages do n't have a police force . 
  all goes well until a bunch of north asian migrants or gypsies or whoever criminal starts to settle in abandoned households . 
  ah-oh , at this point locals could get into trouble . 
  thanks again for the clarification !, 
  wow , thanks a lot , i appreciate your efforts !, 
  that reminds me of behavior of the police in russian small towns . 
  a chief is a godfather who 's permanently absent making his own biz , officers is a bunch of lazy laymans if no thugs in the worst case . 
  damn , some kind of people are the same everywhere . 
  i do n't get one thing . 
  is it not obvious , that having fully white personnel in a town where non-whites are prevailing , is not the brightest idea ? 
  i thought , there have to be some rules , ai n't it ? 
  haha , got it . 
  offtopic : as a somehow local , what do you think , was fergusson really so bad as seems from overseas ? 
  i mean , riots happened before , why does this one get so much attention ? 
  in russia , it 's an urban phenomenon , probably came from labor camps and infiltrated street culture . 
  know you [ meme ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/and_you_are_lynching_negroes ) , man . 
  how dare you destroy the classics ? 
  such ` joking around ' happened to be a lifestyle in every little town across the country . 
  edit : i 'm not sure about the sub i linked , but you get an idea how it looks like in real life . 
  do you have an advice for a sociopath as well ? 
  i appreciate your wisdom !, 
  passport 's lifespan was 5 years before a couple of years ago ( iirc ) , by now it was increased up to 10 yrs . 
   america kills negroes ? 
  & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ; americans * are lynching * negroes . 
  i think such laws make no sense . 
  in case of riots , does anyone care about time of day ? 
  can someone tread through life being a russophobe in russia ? 
  i 'd call it a boiling frog policy . 
  the previous version of the law has been banning protests from 23:00 to 7:00 , this one - from 22:00 . 
  ouch . 
   that gives you an ancestral right to the lands and resources may i ask you what are you talking about ? 
  so-called land code ( a country law to regulate land owning ) did n't come in force . 
  citizens do n't get benefits of mineral extraction . 
  as a citizen i do n't give a flying fuck about our ancestry rights , we still do n't have any rights except personal ones on our soil . 
  here we go . 
  this is simple : russian population divided in proportion 80/20 , it comes straight from the pareto principle . 
  all the meaningful percentages fall in range between 10 % and 20 % . 
  - about 20 % of population traveled abroad at least ** once ** . 
  i bet a half of them have only been to turkey or egypt .
