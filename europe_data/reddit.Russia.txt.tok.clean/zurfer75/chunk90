  it 's up to you but there may be repercussions . 
  also , i was n't in the mod team a month ago . 
  now i have to watch my mouth when commenting . 
  i think ukraine has taken a wrong stance on the crimean autonomy from the beginning . 
  i mean , holding two sticks is not the better choice , you should better swap one with a carrot . 
  nothing wrong with having an ethnic enclave in a country , but it needs some efforts on your side to get it integrated . 
  your point being ? 
  as a normal human being , i can be drunk or angry every now and then , or having a fleeting moment of stupidity . 
  i see no point in cleaning the comment history every time . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  + dnr/lnr `` volunteers '' , since the `` novorossya '' project is about to be shut down and the regime is most likely not excited to see them back in the motherland . 
  just so you know , / u/sturle is most likely the last redditor to `` flex my mod muscle '' about . 
  it 's a matter of principle . 
  comments on sensitive topics are already bad enough without additional witch-hunting . 
  just hit the `` report '' and call it a day . 
  if you are concerned with agenda pushing , there 's the `` report '' button for that . 
  shit flinging in comments is a ) annoying b ) against the rules . 
  no need to go personal . 
  please . 
  here we go again . 
  [ crimean sovereignty referendum , 1991 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_sovereignty_referendum,_1991 )  a referendum on sovereignty was held in the crimean oblast of the ukrainian ssr on 20 january 1991 . 
  [ 1 ] voters were asked whether they wanted to re-establish the crimean autonomous soviet socialist republic , which had been abolished in 1945 . 
  the proposal was ** approved by 94 % of voters ** . 
  [ crimean status referendum , 2014 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_status_referendum,_2014#history )  the ukrainian parliament ** abolished the 1992 crimean constitution [ 30 ] and the office of president of crimea in 1995 . 
  ** [ 31 ] in 1998 , crimea gained a new constitution , which granted it less autonomy ; notably , any legislation passed by the crimean parliament could be vetoed by the ukrainian parliament . 
  [ 29 ] like it or not , the government of ukraine usurped the power in the crimean republic . 
  therefore , crimeans were legitimately fighting for their freedom , haha . 
  here 's a little problem , though : crimea 's ascension/annexation into the rufed was illegal even by the standards of russian law .

  given that the belorussian police once arrested a one-handed `` protester '' for merely clapping * their hand * , it would n't be too surprising .
