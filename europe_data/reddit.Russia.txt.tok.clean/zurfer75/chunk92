  i beg to differ . 
  there 's no reason to lump them all together . 
  refugees ( or migrants for that matter ) are coming from many places . 
  you ca n't tell beforehand whether they are compatible or not . 
  i 'm arguing against prejudice , that 's what the fuss is all about . 
  please , avoid racist and hateful language . 
  it is n't tolerated here . 
  that would be implying that the immigrants ( in context of the discussion ) all share the same culture . 
  it should have been worded more clearly . 
  are you against sexism ? 
  great , i 'm more than fine with it . 
   it 's a fact they have an inferior culture that is not appropriate .
