   armenians raise their kids with hatred and paternalistic racism towards turks . 
  armenians think that azerbaijanis are a bunch of `` turkified iranians '' , so they hate them as well . 
  please , avoid sweeping generalizations which are meant to incite anger and hatred . 
  more like schrodinger 's finno-ugrs .

  please , refrain from insults and personal attacks . 
  this may be an unpopular thing to say , but a referendum , generally speaking , is an overly simplistic way to solve the complex issue . 
  it 's naive to hope that once you 've given a simple y/n answer , you 'll have the ( in ) dependent country on your hands with no strings attached . 
  obviously , imho .

  those were the scythians but close enough . 
  we are the mongols . 
  for the horde !, 
  ever occurred to you that ` free ' healthcare is not particularly free ? 
  everyone and their grandma are not entitled to benefits of living in a developed place while not sharing the costs . 
  fyi , the registration in a new place takes around 10 minutes as for now . 
  officially . 
  plus , i 'm sure as hell that i do n't want to deal with state workers who did n't pass at least a cursory background check before employment . 
  * propiska * , as an institution , is generally tied to - a ) a citizen 's ability to get the free healthcare they need - b ) the amount of maintenance and utility fees a tenant has to pay on a monthly basis - c ) a citizen 's ability to get a job in public sector - d ) taxes ( yep , i know it 's a funny joke ) if having * propiska * was so crucial for survival as it 's often portrayed , millions of migrant workers would never make it to russia 's big cities . 
  by the way , your comment was n't a metaphor . 
  it was part of the `` russians are genetically slaves who evidently ca n't govern themselves without causing too much trouble to their civilized , westernized neighbors '' narrative , a western-backed media campaign which has been pushed in the wake of the war in ukraine . 
  so far i 've seen plenty of this crap especially in runet . 
  the western public is yet to be emotionally prepared for the future war , hence the dehumanization social media campaign . 
  the topic was about how dugin allegedly influenced russian politics as a whole . 
  and now you tell me ` it does n't matter ' . 
  what 's it all about then ? 
  `` presumably '' oh it 's a solid argument , haha . 
  which is not `` presumably '' is the fact that dugin was a member of nbp that was deemed ` extremist ' and banned in result . 
  except none of them sources say that * `` this is putin 's favorite `` geopolitical philosopher '' who has enormous influence on all level of the russian government , particularly at the very top '' * dugin was one of advisers of naryshkin , while the latter presided over state duma . 
  you 're welcome . 
  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9479238-day-of-the-oprichnik  day of the oprichnik  by vladimir sorokin , jamey gambrell ( translator )  one of the telegraph 's best fiction books 2011   moscow , 2028 . 
  a cold , snowy morning . 
  a scream , a moan , and a death rattle slowly pull him out of his drunken stupor -- but wait , that 's just his ring tone . 
  and so begins another day in the life of an oprichnik , one of the czar 's most trusted courtiers -- and one of the country 's most feared men . 
    welcome to the new new russia , where futuristic technology and the draconian codes of ivan the terrible are in perfect synergy . 
  corporal punishment is back , as is a divine monarch , but these days everyone gets information from high-tech news bubbles , and the elite get high on hallucinogenic , genetically modified fish . 
    over the course of one day , andrei komiaga will bear witness to -- and participate in -- brutal executions ; extravagant parties ; meetings with ballerinas , soothsayers , and even the czarina . 
  he will rape and pillage , and he will be moved to tears by the sweetly sung songs of his homeland . 
  he will consume an arsenal of drugs and denounce threats to his great nation 's morals . 
  and he will fall in love -- perhaps even with a number of his colleagues . 
  sorokin is by far the best contemporary russian writer , so it 's impossible to give a short description here . 
  dugin is a controversial philosopher and , reportedly , a language genius . 
  calling his book `` a military text '' is intellectually deceitful .
