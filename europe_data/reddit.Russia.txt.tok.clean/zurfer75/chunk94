  many of his predictions have been the writing on the wall since the fall of the ussr . 
  plus , let 's not forget that dugin was a young padawan of mamleev and a frequent visitor at jour fixes of mamleev 's esoteric sect . 
  after that , he became a core ideologist of a kgb 's honey pot named `` pamyat ' '' , hehehe . 
  if there was anyone who actually might know where it all was going to , that must be dugin . 
  that being said , if you really wan na know about the future of rufed , do n't waste your time on conspiracy theories like that - go and read sorokin 's `` sugar kremlin '' or `` a day of oprichnik '' ( no idea what the exact title in english would be tho ) . 
  there you will find all the information you need , 
  i 'm all for it but you 'll need a number of fairly passionate people to pursue the changes needed . 
  the typical electorate of `` united russia '' is only able to drink beer and watch tv . 
  most pro-russian nationalist groups have been completely demolished over the last few years and their leaders were either forced to leave the country or they simply went to jail . 
  on the one hand , the sharp decline in the number of hate crimes is undoubtedly a good thing for everyone involved . 
  on the other hand , given that like 90 % of rapes in moscow are committed by migrants from muslim countries / republics , _ and _ the fact that the cops keep sweeping it under the rag - the situation will backfire dearly on one unlucky day . 
  i strongly disagree . 
  russia 's ruling elite is anti-russian at its core . 
  we need something to counterweight the cancerous influence of the rich who keep their money and families in safety in the west and care very little about the domestic problems in rufed . 
  well , i 'm far from thinking that the ukrainian conflict was manufactured strictly for that purpose , but you 're spot on - the fall of far right groups is a ` nice ' side effect , from the standpoint of the elite . 
  i like to think that anti semitism is on the decline in rufed . 
  at least , this is mostly limited to less educated social groups , such as the working class , cops , and military guys . 
  on the other hand , thanks to the growing economic crisis , said social groups will only grow in numbers in the foreseeable future . 
  you 're spot on about the leader portraits in every goddamn state office . 
  this is a real scary crap . 
  even though it 's mostly used as a visual pledge of allegiance of some sort , you are totally right , this is a hallmark of a country on a slippery slope . 
  i feel like i 'm getting too old for this internet propaganda crap . 
  no , seriously . 
  as someone who used to make fake internet identities back in the 90 's ( mostly female ones , let 's say , just for shits and giggles ) i ca n't wrap my head around the notion of people listening ( let alone blindly believing ) to random anons ' posts on the net . 
  i get why people believe to what their relatives / people they know irl say . 
  it 's okay for the most part . 
  but i 'm wondering how do those poor simple minded , susceptible to propaganda ones even function in the day-to-day life ? 
  do the girls willingly get into a car of a stranger in the middle of the night ? 
  do the guys buy 100 % golden rings with pure diamonds in it from that shady guy on the street corner ? 
  i mean , everyone should have at least a pinch of common sense . 
  this is like a basic ability . 
  i take it you 're trying to tell me that a bunch of shitposters in the internet can sway elections in the most powerful country in the world . 
  how the hell do you still have a country then ? 
   a russian diaspora well , color me surprised . 
  i get why people may want to show off their support of the motherland when they go abroad . 
  i 'm talking about russia though . 
  sorry , but so far i 've had a hard time finding someone wearing such a t-shirt outside of state-sponsored activities . 
  you 're kinda missing my point . 
  i just find it a bit odd that russia is often referred to as a putin 's russia . 
  granted , he 's got a lot of power and leverage over the inept opposition parties in rufed , but still , he is just an accepted representative of a few powerful clans , not a god-emperor himself . 
  yes , unfortunately , he enjoys the popular support , but then again , even trump of all people managed to get a lot votes recently , even though the latter is a bit of a buffoon . 
  the public can be easily swayed by the media . 
  what is going on behind the scenes is the only thing that really matters . 
  hell , now i sound like a conspiratard . 
  the westerners seem to be dazzled and obsessed by the massive personality of the dearest leader :d if there is a place where putin 's cult of personality really exist , that must be the western public . 
  heck , even local ass-licking rags , such as 1tv and rtr , usually do n't blow his significance that much of proportion . 
  whereas in the western msm it routinely presented as `` shortly after the breakfast , putin in the putin 's russia singlehandedly did this and that . 
  \\ #justputinsthings '' . 
  is there any chances that the euro could be a safe haven in that , hopefully hypothetical , case ? 
  eli5 , what economic impact would that cause ? 
  i mean , looking at the pound going down after brexit , is it possible that the dollar will also sink down a bit , taking the whole world 's economy with it ? 
  do n't be a russian living in the west - it 's non-patriotic . 
  problem solved :d, 
   the trades will more than double that gain by the end of next year by returning 15 percent , second only to investing in argentina 's peso , according to forecasts compiled by bloomberg . 
   citigroup inc. , the biggest foreign-exchange trader , has said russia is engineering a `` super-carry '' currency , while goldman sachs group inc. called the ruble one of its `` most-favored carry candidates . '' < . .   the ruble has climbed since reaching a record low of 85.999 per dollar in january , and was at about 63.7 in moscow on thursday -- up 16 percent this year and on course for its first annual advance since 2012 . 
  sixty percent of 20 analysts in a bloomberg survey said they do n't expect a correction in russia 's currency before the year is out . 
  kinda hard to believe that anybody in the west is seriously concerned over the wellbeing of the families of russian mercenaries . 
  at very least , they stopped sending conscripts to die in wars . 
  which is a very , very good thing . 
  either way , what 's so secret about it ? 
  it was in the news earlier . 
  the lack of self-awareness is fascinating  thanks for reinforcing my point . 
  sounds like a typical russia-related thread on reddit to me  at least , in the 90s , there was actually no shortage of books like that . 
  it 's actually quite telling that many ukrainians & poles sincerely believe that `` hurr durr russians are mongols '' is a harsh insult . 
  maybe you guys should re-evaluate your own values . 
  the mere fact of renaming the street could n't even get much traction in the russian media . 
  i mean , the average media consumer here has been already convinced that ukrainians eat babies alive . 
  bandera 's street adds nothing to the existing media image of ukraine . 
  the irony is that moscow was the only russian city that has seen a street protest against the war in ukraine . 
  not to mention that the police was gathering cell phones info during the rally so the participants were put on some sort of a list , just in case . 
  as i take it , ukraine no longer needs sympathizers in rufed , so be it . 
  perhaps that means they can no longer get foreign funding . 
   russian air strikes in syria have negatively affected the way the country is seen internationally , 32 per cent said . 
   however , ** 52 ** per cent of russians said they back moscow 's air strikes , while ** 26 ** per cent said they opposed them . 
   responding to a question about whether russia should continue `` intervening in what is going on in syria , '' ** 49 ** per cent said yes while ** 28 ** per cent said no . 
   when asked if they thought the us and western countries could find common ground with the current leaders of russia and syria , ** 35 ** per cent said it was likely or very likely , while ** 39 ** per cent said it was unlikely or very unlikely . 
   germans take 2nd place for most rapes committed during wwii i was only commenting on that bit . 
  were the soviets found responsible for more than 10 millions rapes ? 
  could you please provide a source for that ? 
   rapes were allowed in practice by the german military in eastern and southeastern europe , while northern and western countries were relatively spared . 
  [ 72 ] [ 73 ] in occupied denmark , which initially agreed to collaborate with nazi germany , rapes were not widespread , and german officials promised to punish them . 
  [ 72 ] by contrast thousands of soviet female nurses , doctors and field medics fell victim to rape when captured , and were often murdered afterwards . 
  [ 38 ] german soldiers used to brand the bodies of captured partisan women -- and other women as well -- with the words `` whore for hitler 's troops '' and rape them . 
  [ 74 ] following their capture some german soldiers vividly bragged about committing rape and rape-homicide . 
  [ 75 ] in the soviet union alone an estimates regarding the rape of soviet women by the wehrmacht range up to ** 10,000,000 ** incidents , with between 750,000 and 1,000,000 children being born as a result . 
  [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_crimes_of_the_wehrmacht basically , one rape per german soldier in the eastern front . 
  because somehow in your racist mind it 's only paid shills who post here from russia ? 
  my bad , i guess i was mistaken then . 
  regardless , such machines will be outlawed soon . 
  selling alcohol to those under 18 is prohibited anyway and vending machines can not into age check . 
  `` they '' do n't have it anymore . 
  there was only one such a machine installed and it was removed after the public uproar . 
  if even a small sign of disbelief on my side makes you enlightened westerners immediately resort to this tiresome capitalist-comrade rhetoric , which i 'm already fed up with , i would rather stay home , thank you . 
  that would save me a hassle . 
  yeah , cool story man . 
  those organizations are advertising as we speak : `` only $ 300 and 1 week for schengen - contact us today and get a huge discount ! '', 
  fair enough , but i thought we were talking about ordinary people who usually do n't have any relatives or friends in the west . 
   schengen visa applicants must prove that they have enough financial resources during their stay or transit in the schengen area . 
  the required means of substinence depend upon the purpose and duration of the stay , according to the average prices in the schengen country of main destination or of first entry for board and lodging in budget accommodation , multiplied by the number of days stayed . 
  http://www.immihelp.com/visas/schengenvisa/means-of-substinence.html plus you have to prove you have a real , non-minimal wage job in russia .
