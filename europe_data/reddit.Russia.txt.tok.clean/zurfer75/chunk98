  russia 's pension fund is a fairy tale for old babushkas . 
  it has never had any real money , only virtual figures . 
  pensions are being paid ( in roubles , mind you ) from the state budget . 
  whereas the currency reserve can be turned into dollars . 
  according to the central bank , russia 's currency reserves [ are at their highest since dec 2014 ] ( https://lenta.ru/news/2016/08/11/rusreserves/ ) . 
  rosstat : in the first week of august , [ deflation marked the second consecutive week ] ( http://russianeconomyportal.blogspot.com/2016/08/rosstat-deflation-marked-second.html ) for the first time since 2011 . 
  apples and oranges . 
  we are not germans , for good or for bad , so i do n't see how it 's related to the topic at hand . 
  imo , it 's entirely up to them . 
  they can praise satan for all i care . 
  i do n't think i 've ever glorified him . 
  the point still stands though . 
  different countries had it different . 
  not op but [ [ a saboteur or a victim : what is known about panov | korrespondent.net ] ] ( http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/3730356-dyversant-yly-zhertva-chto-yzvestno-o-panove ) , there you go . 
  eh , it needs to sink in . 
  thanks for the link . 
   blatant lies like the `` yarosh business card '' ? 
  two years later yarosh admitted the story was true i 'm afraid i 'm not following you . 
  do you mean , he said it himself ? 
  if true , it 's fucked up :|, 
  fair enough . 
  we 're learning from the best , hehehe . 
  why ? 
  he did win the war . 
  ever occurred to you that , even though it 's not a beauty pageant , stalin _ was _ , in fact , better than hitler , at very least , for the russians and belorussians ? 
  i know it was vastly different in the baltics , perhaps this is the reason you 're unable to grasp on such a simple concept . 
  i meant no offence , it 's understandable that everyone has their own bias . 
  that 's what i said . 
  in the fall of 2012 , before the reverse of the trend , fewer than 30 % were evaluating him in a positive light . 
  the point is , stalin is widely regarded as a ww2 winner _ and _ a tyrant at the same time . 
  the patriotic fever of the last years makes an impact on the ` war ' part . 
   does n't need to be , but he is still glorified by the majority of russians . 
   still this is not true and you know it . 
  the positive attitude to stalin is [ a trend of the last two years ] ( https://cdn.vedomosti.ru/image/2016/2d/bm2c/fullscreen-f1.png ) . 
  at the same time 60 % of the russians would rather not live under stalin 's rule and 2/3 consider him a tyrant , who 's guilty in deaths of millions over millions of innocents .

  for many people , the fact that under stalin 's rule the ussr won the war trumps everything else . 
  that 's not true . 
   70 % of the russians believe that a possible reconciliation with erdogan is either premature or not needed at all .

  no offence taken . 
  i wish all the luck to your continent !, 
  you were curious about our common perception of latin america - well , i just tried to clue you in , 
  these are technicalities  though opinions may vary wrt the affiliation of south korea and japan . 
  in my opinion , the two belong to both worlds . 
  i have no idea who was booing and , to be honest , i do n't care about it . 
  however , i assume that those who can afford to buy a ticket are most likely middle class , which tends to be more westernized and informed pretty much everywhere . 
  hence the awareness of the doping scandal , the shenanigans in ukraine etc. 
  no , i do n't think so . 
  the west is just other name for the first world countries , the us + their hat/uk/eu . 
  i hope you understand what part of said mentality i had in mind . 
  this man manly manliness which is often put on display in the region is a textbook example of a lack of self-confidence and generally an indicator of huge problems with self-esteem . 
  having said that , i really admire the famous caucasian generosity and hospitality . 
  you 're spot on about the cossacks though . 
  their lasting mentality is the reason why i 'm not a fan , putting it lightly , of the former ussr 's south , be it krasnodar , caucasus or s/e ukraine . 
  there are way too many obnoxious , homophobic , and overtly racist gopnicks for my taste . 
  [ russia accuses ukraine of armed crimea incursion , says two killed | reuters ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-crimea-attack-iduskcn10l1ee?il=0 ), 
  i think that by this time , we are kinda past the point of a possible reconciliation . 
  maybe it 's time to stop pretending that we could ever get along with the west and break all ties with our adversaries . 
  nothing good comes from this anyway . 
  on top of that , as a nation that inherited a good chunk of medieval asian/north caucasian mentality ( along with a huge inferiority complex ) , we are not going to forget all this booing , mooing , and whatnot in the foreseeable future . 
  bad memories and perceived grievances will be lingering here for decades down the line , that 's for sure . 
  i know a guy who once told me that `` the west '' deserved a harsh retaliation for booing at those young russian girls at eurovision , lol . 
  admitting such a mistake would have dragged his approval rating down to 10 % overnight , so no . 
  come on , italian is by far the most beautiful of european languages . 
   the uk parliament approved an air campaign against isis in syria but not ground troops . 
  special forces , though , have always been treated differently . 
  the government mantra is that special forces can be deployed wherever there is judged to be a threat to the uk . 
  this train is long gone . 
  while it 's true that turkey is a former archenemy of russia , no one in their right mind would cross the line into a real brawl with them . 
  on top of that they are one of a few neighbours who seem to be really determined to protect their interests and overtly patriotic about their homeland . 
   in moscow they did a march of shame with female prisoners care to provide a link ? 
  `` with friends like these ... '', 
  i would say it 's both . 
  the sanctions are killing the russian banking sector as we speak , btw . 
  the whole idea behind russian banks is 1 ) to take a cheap loan in a western bank 2 ) to offer credits at ungodly prices on the domestic market . 
  now the scheme is gone . 
  you 're making it sound like it 's not a big deal . 
  dude , my flat lost half of its price and it 's the only money i have . 
  given that i 've never been to crimea or ukraine , i would n't call it `` nothing serious '' . 
  it 's bloody serious . 
  well , a fair share of the russians do n't understand what freedom is needed for . 
  that does n't mean they are bad people or something , they are just not there yet . 
  this is why i 'm indifferent to the president personalia . 
  the reactionary movement we 're witnessing here is a grassroots movement , even though the propaganda machine is definitely to blame . 
  it has changed because now we live in a wild , unchecked version of crony capitalism . 
  money is the only thing that matters . 
  not everyone who is supporting putin blindly believes the domestic media . 
  i think it is simpler than you think . 
  most of the western media is rabidly russophopic at the moment and it 's not like the western msm are only set against the regime . 
  the russians are ultimately portrayed as a bunch of violent drunkards if not worse . 
  it 's only natural that many people are taking a defensive stance . 
  on top of that , we do n't have a luxury of free movement , given that obtaining a short-term visa to any developed country , let alone emigration , can be a bloody pain in the ass . 
  the vast majority of russians will never have other country beside russia , be it good or bad . 
  oftentimes it takes a lot of guts to openly admit that your only country is a shithole , especially if you know full well that you are condemned to live there till your death . 
  it has changed because now we live in a wild , unchecked version of crony capitalism .
