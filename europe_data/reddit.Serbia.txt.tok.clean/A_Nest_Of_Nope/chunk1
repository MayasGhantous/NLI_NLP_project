soooo , your are telling me jugoslavia is reborning ? 
  errrr , you just do n't wan na know . 
  we are not a country of mad slaughters , we are a fucking normal and nice country . 
  the average people here do not give a single fuck if you are white , black , yellow , blue and whatever religion you worship . 
  we have nationalists and extremist assholes as in every country , stop the prejudice against serbia , thanks . 
  hey dude , nobody doubts the skill and athletic level of nba players ( which have games every 2 or 3 days when european basket do it once in a week ) . 
  i am proud of the serbian team in the 2014 worldcup , and not an inch ashamed of what they did against the usa team , since they themselves knew how hard it would be to play against players of totally different level . 
  this was not trash talking , i just said that here basketball is followed with more hearth , and unfortunately aggressively sometimes ,, 
  i just lost my sides . 
  welcome to european basketball ` muricans . 
  top kek . 
  edit : til serbians ca n't post humuor or jokes in r/europe since everything become a circlejerk about balkan ethnic problems . 
  edit 2 : til ~ ~ serbians ~ ~ slovenian , croat , bosnian , serbian , montenegrin , macedonians and albanian . 
  no thanks , we already sent back your [ freedom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_f-117a_shootdown ) . 
  a thread about kosovo aaaaand is full of serbians , oh , the irony . 
  wow , thats some nasty shit , thanks brate . 
  some one can eli5 what 's happening ? 
  if i understood correctly eu says that kosovo must get rid of corruption before having any chance to join the eu , right ? 
  wan na talk about this small thing called neum ? 
  kosovo who ? 
  wait , wow , i 'm really surprised . 
  some one understood serbia diplomatic/economic actions . 
  now i feel ashamed for these 2 f117 :(, 
  oh boy , there are tons of international reports and analysis about the situation in kosovo from the 1970s , all had the same conclusion , which was proven to be correct from 1991 . 
  i guess we had all the information to prevent all this mess but , you know , killing each other from 800 years is too much fun . 
  oh boy , we missed so much you georgia . 
  maybe because bosnia is half serbian ethnic group/population ? 
  also because bosnia has an economic situation far worse of serbia ? 
  and because is the region who suffered more deaths during the war ? 
  but you forgot to mention that the churches burned down were all from 1100s and 1200s . 
  when the mosques were 4 or 5 centuries newer . 
  the disparity of serbian and albanian families is well known . 
  even the muslim culture is known for having a lot of more children of other cultures . 
  you had to ask this question back in 1998 dude . 
  i can speak of myself , not of what other serbs think . 
  the kosovo region was not been handled correctly from the former yugoslavia back in the 1970s , basically this region was underdeveloped in every field , from economy , infrastructure , agriculture to ethnic groups and obviously religions . 
  on one side there was the government doing almost nothing to develop this part of yugoslavia . 
  on the other side there was the people living there , serbians and albanian ethnic groups who just wanted to live good as the northern regions like vojvodina or slovenia since it was one big country . 
  year after year tensions , anger and nationalists ( from both sides ) idiots grew more and more in kosovo , the worse were the chetniks who wanted this land cleansed and untouched from muslim people cause historical reasons and fanaticism , but it was nonsense , you just ca n't pretend to erase muslim religion from a country which was under ottoman ( muslim ) empire for like 800 years . 
  also there was a lot of albanian nationalists who wanted to create the big albania and since in kosovo there was a lot of albanians targeting this region was obvious , more and more albanians emigrated in kosovo but a lot of them had 6 or more children for every family ( serbian families had like 2 o 3 children ) , this increased albanian population and if you add the idea of big albania the result is two ethnic groups already angry for their poor life with the addition of ethnic fanaticism . 
  it was a bomb ready to explode and it exploded . 
  yes , still kosovo is very important for the orthodox culture and religion . 
  in this land there is some of the oldest orthodox churches and monasteries like [ banjska ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banjska_monastery ) , [ devi\u010d ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/devi%c4%8d ) and [ zo\u010di\u0161te ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zo%c4%8di%c5%a1te_monastery ) . 
  unfortunately these churches were vandalized in 1998 and 1999 , they have been rebuild but many more have been destroyed and lost . 
  there * was * more serbs there , but you know , some things happened in the last 20 years . 
  this . 
  i did not said albanian nationalists , i said nationalists . 
  if it was for me , this match had to be played without spectators . 
  i just have no words of how much i am angry right now . 
  the same bullshit keep repeating over and over . 
  this is like what happened in 1990 with hajduk split and partizan beograd , my mother had shivers with the match of tonight , these fucking idiots who sent the drone are most probably born after the war , they just have no fucking idea of how bad feel those who lived in ex-jugoslavia during the war . 
  fuck you damned nationalists , fuck you uefa for just thinking only how to earn more money . 
  these idiots , who came in belgrade just to provoke all this shit , deserves the worst , they ca n't imagine of how bad will be the aftermath of this bullshit . 
  italian here ( yeah , i got the citizenship ) , the five stars movement it 's just a bunch of conspiracy clowns . 
  their own political party is falling apart since they eject every one who has a different opinion . 
  at the last elections they have been totally ** rekt ** , but they still yell that they are what italian people want . 
  just read at their website , it 's an insane mountain of conspiracy bullshit , seriously , they even claim that nasa missions on the moon are all staged . 
  please do not believe what five star movement says , they do n't have any idea of italy really is . 
  i would like to see a poll on the norwegian population to see how much these banknotes * sucks * . 
   if most people think your art is ugly , your art is ugly . 
  the end . 
  lol, 
  what you linked is art , graphic design is not art . 
  anyway , yes , you can be an award-winning dude and still creating crap , but in my opinion [ this ] ( http://snohetta.com/projects ) and [ this ] ( http://themetricsystem.no/ ) are not crap . 
  alright , i said `` 2 of the most important graphic design studios in norway '' cause when a government employs someone to design new banknotes they will search some one skilled , with an un huge work experience , some one who won many awards in their field , like these 2 studios . 
  the first comment of u/644282 , in my opinion is just shitting on something he does n't like cause it 's `` hipsterish '' ( wtf ? ) . 
  anyone have his own opinion , and it 's correct , but i do n't think that these 2 studios designed the banknotes randomly , i 'm pretty sure they have a strong motivation for their choices . 
  yes , you should be sorry . 
  if you are someone like max huber or jan tschichold i would listen your constructive criticism about the design of these banknotes . 
  but i doubt you even know who they are . 
  also you are just shitting on 2 of the most important graphic design studios in norway . 
  please explain to me what this [ one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dysdcsr.jpg ) and this [ one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jzpizi4.jpg ) have to be placed in the balkan context where the tipical mosque is like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ttftqsw.jpg ) . 
  classic , getting insulted when you point out truth . 
  cause fuck serbia , no ? 
  well ok , but without him and the other dudes purged by stalin you guys will still have the zar i think . 
  ** if ** lenin would lived more years i think soviet union/russia would have been a much more nice place . 
  just look at the uglyhugeasfuck mosque in sarajevo , oh and what about the thing in mostar ? 
  where you can see the competition of who is the biggest dick with the huge minaret on one side and the huge campanile on the other one . 
  actually i 'm not shitting , i 'm pointing out facts , this country is very small compared to the other european countries but the rate of crimes is nearly astronomical , even if you compare it with all the surrounding nations . 
  since the secession from serbia all the things i wrote increased drastically ( there is tons and tons of reports from the osce and un ) . 
  organ trafficking is well established in the albania/kosovo region since the 80s and still very high now . 
  yes , all these bad things are present in europe but not even close to kosovo . 
  i would like to know how you can candidate a country where the top government dudes have ties with huge criminal organizations and are even involved in war crimes . 
  this country is known to be the door from where all the asian/arabs drugs ( afghanistan ) come to be sold in europe . 
  human abduction , prostitutes/slaves trafficking and organ trafficking is just one the many fucked up things there . 
  true , my bad not mentioning them . 
  also add the floods , corruption , highasfuck rate of unemployment , radical muslim religion increase and you will realize that people living there will soon freak out . 
  well yeah , stalin was pretty mad at the master troll tito . 
  i lol 'd, 
  [ not balkan people reaction ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q93tot0.gif ), 
  cause telling things that almost no one believes make people upset on the internet ? 
  what i wrote is very well known as a true fact , it has been even recorded on a camera . 
  anyway , we are just blaming the evil slovens , cause they are ... slovens . 
  replace the stone with a anti-aircraft weapon , replace the serbian dude pissing with a yugoslavian army chopper full of ** bread ** and you got pretty much what started all this mess . 
  you had one chance back in the 1939 , but you defected it for the motherland . 
   a higher proportion of the serbian population probably participated in genocide no , the soldiers ** and ** the illegal paramilitary groups were a very few men . 
  also a lot of regular yugoslavian army soldiers defected , especially when the ethnical cleansings were ordered . 
  are you an internet noob ? 
  please tell me you did not saw ** / s ** in my first post . 
  you ... you enlightened me !,
