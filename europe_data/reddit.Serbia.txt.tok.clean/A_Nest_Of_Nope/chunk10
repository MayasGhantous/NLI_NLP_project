  i 'm ok with that . 
  kek, 
  so now every time radars and sonars pick up something it must be russian submarines ? 
  what the fuck . 
  i do n't think so tbh . 
  what if kosovo goes back to serbia and both we get in europe , deal ? 
  first they take kosovo and become and independent nation and then they want to give back part of it to serbia ? 
  wtf, 
  why there are protests ? 
  oh yeah man you are triggering the milosevic in me . 
  ah , i was expecting the one that would say again * georgia did nothing wrong , it 's russia fault . 
  there are 150 from 240 nuclear weapons in usa military bases all around europe , there are 50 nukes only in usa airport of aviano , italy . 
  there are 59 usa military bases in italy , 179 in germany . 
  without considering all the others in belgium , netherlands , norway , greece and bulgaria . 
  kaliningrad is since the end of ww2 the base of the baltic fleet , actually completely surrounded by countries in nato . 
  so since this one the most important part of russian military with over hundreds of vessels they have no right be militarized ? 
   it was their choice to accept us money are you for real ? 
  countries were basically in crumbles with no economy left , they were desperate and they had only * that * option to accept usa helps , and usa knowing that played their game to impose their presence in europe with military bases . 
   russia has continued to be hostile to the baltic states ( abducting an estonian `` spy '' in estonia ) wait , wait , wait . 
  you are justifying the presence of military bases and nuclear weapons from usa near russia because one single spy was kidnapped ? 
  you do n't even know what were the early plans of usa for russia when ussr collapsed , your goddamn governors and military in the 1990 had even plans to split russia in a way that siberia would become another country and then in a way to get the natural resources in there . 
   sovereign countries have every right to choose what alliance they want to join . 
  you should learn better history and what were the deals for countries that accepted helps from usa to rebuild their nations after ww2 . 
  and when russia threatened to invade europe ? 
  ah yes , of course nato is good now cause it stopped to do one single thing . 
  so please explain to me what is the real reason of filling europe , and all the countries that share borders with russia , with usa military bases/airports ( with even nuclear bombs in it ) . 
  what is the reason of increasing their numbers more and more * after * the collapse of ussr ? 
  because after russia was born their first intention would be attacking europe to recreate ussr ? 
  yes , of course . 
  let me remember to you that nato and usa kept plotting , sabotaging and waging illegal wars in countries from the end of ww2 , and kept doing it even after ussr collapse like in the second balkan wars , afghanistan , iraq , arming rebels ( with the known results ) in libya and now in syria . 
  how many aggressive and not * correct * acts russia did since ussr collapse ? 
  one , ukraine ( do n't even try to say georgia because it has been proven by every international organization that russia was provoked and attacked there ) . 
  so please , stop talking shit . 
  oh please , nato has never done anything aggressive towards russia in the last 25 years around his borders , yeah ? 
  edit : as expected downvotes instead of at least any kind of debate , stay classy r/europe . 
  yes please , spread more hate between nato and russia . 
  if the world anti doping agency says something * that * bold like `` all russians athletes must be banned '' they should at least indicate a citation or some proofs . 
  because just shouting things in this way it will only escalate in the two parties spewing shit at each other . 
  also , the churches that have been destroyed were 140 , not just a few . 
  all of them were from the pre-ottoman era , like [ monastery of the holy archangels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monastery_of_the_holy_archangels ) built in 1352 . 
  [ our lady of ljevi\u0161 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/our_lady_of_ljevi%c5%a1 ) built in 1307 . 
  [ devi\u010d monastery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/devi%c4%8d ) built in 1434 . 
  [ church of the virgin hodegetria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/church_of_the_virgin_hodegetria,_mu%c5%a1uti%c5%a1te ) built in 1315 . 
  [ monastery of st. mark of kori\u0161a ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monastery_of_st._mark_of_kori%c5%a1a ) built in 1467 . 
  [ visoki de\u010dani ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visoki_de%c4%8dani ) built in 1327 . 
  [ zo\u010di\u0161te monastery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zo%c4%8di%c5%a1te_monastery ) built in 1327 . 
  so basically what those people destroyed was basically already unesco heritage things , those people just shot them self in the foot . 
  honeslty ? 
  this guy has some problem and needs help . 
  from when austria has become ` murica ? 
  where in the fuck i 'm suggesting to bomb libya ? 
  dude , do you even know how to read ? 
  it was n't u/crnaruka . 
  [ removed ], 
  no , the removed posts were just ultranationalistics videos like `` god guides serbian bombs '' or other shit from balkan wars . 
  and also the perpetual circlejerk of albanians and serbians spewing shit to each other . 
  looks like u/hjongoldrake is purging the heresy from this thread . 
  shut up british colony !, 
  my troll detector is offcharts . 
  actually we should think more of why people are willing to pay over 800 euro for an hardware device used mainly for texting , facebook and instagram . 
  with the same amount of money you can buy a very good computer , or a lot of stuff much much more useful . 
  hello , learn to sarcarsm . 
  no it ca n't happen , russia going for moon it 's only an excuse to new putin imperialism who wants to annex other countries like soviet union . 
  signed usa, 
  because it 's just a country like others with normal people and nice places . 
  oh please , i like croatia , why should you do n't like serbia in 2015 ? 
  balkans always most relaxing places : warzone bandits resident evil allah dracula mass grave mine field, 
  yugoslavia never had communism , we had socialism and people still do n't understand the big difference of yugoslavia compared to soviet union . 
  please come back to yugo ;(, 
  wtf johnson ? 
  you are supposed to maintain your clown figure , not to say thinks that have sense . 
  lol . 
  berlusconi with all the wrong things he did is anyway faaar smarter of trump . 
  oh yeah , 2 millions of euro , totally fine to pay her political party and campaign in the past 2 years and get in the position where she is know . 
  are you serious ? 
  i mean you really think that is because fn got 2 million of euro now it can run for presidency ? 
  do you have the bare idea of how much a political party consumes in terms of money in 2 years ? 
  for campaigns , paying staff members , rents , transportation etc ? 
  i never said they are the only ones , but they are the majority . 
  my very same thought , if thats has been done on purpose it 's a very smart stubble trolling . 
  lol . 
  oh come on , we pretty much know that populist movements such these target a part of population that is usually poor and not acculturated . 
  this part of population is known to be very vocal when there is something not working for them as single individuals , because they want like zero taxes , super high retirement pays , low working hours etc. 
  but if the things that they want are not useful for the country as a collectivity then they blame the country , they blame everyone else , because in their small cone of view they are 1000 % sure to know better of the rest of population . 
  le pen speaks to these people and promises them the things that they want , if this part of population is higher then she takes high votes , but as we have seen more than ever in the last years , what political candidates promise it 's usually 1 % of what they do when they got elected . 
  how le pen got a russian megaphone ? 
  please explain this to me . 
  le pen family is inside of politics from * decades * , they accumulated millions of euro and all of this without russia . 
  if you really believe that le pen has now the chance to run for the presidency of france thanks to putin you are delusional . 
  because all that le pen is proposing are words of putin right ? 
  all the people that think exactly as her in france and vote her does not count right ? 
  putin is the only one to blame for it . 
  le pen would have been a very accultured and pragmatic politician * if * putin did not bribed her right ? 
  stop blaming others for your problems and start to aknowledge that if people like le pen are raising in power it 's france people fault . 
  they are not only internal issues , if ukraine becomes a nato member things will escalate even more . 
  all countries in the world deal with what their neightboors do , and if it 's something that is not good for them , they will do whatever is possible to stop them . 
  every one does this , from a very diplomatic and stubble way to a very aggressive and also wrong way , as funding and helping internal separatism or other things like that . 
  i repeat , i disagree completely on how russia is dealing in ukraine , but this does not mean that the situation should not be analized and that is not comparable to the baltics . 
  dude , he never said in this interview that they will not annex crimea . 
  he said a lot of things but not at once `` we will not annex crimea '' .
