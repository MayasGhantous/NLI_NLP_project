  i can give less then fuck about that shit hole . 
  trying to somehow change to subject of a funny thread into `` serbians killed people in kosovo ! '' ? 
  keep going them . 
  what about it ? 
  absolutist what ? 
  are you serious ? 
  you are the absolutist one by thinking that usa is right in doing these terrible things while others are not . 
  yeah , keep turning the subject of the argument . 
  ** the greek debt **, 
  on the next news : usa congress ruled that mexico is in dire need of getting more ~ ~ bombing ~ ~ air dropped freedom . 
  oh please stop pretending you did n't understood i was referring to usa , soviet union / and china . 
  you just demonstrated how americans are brainwashed for believing to be allowed to overthrow democratic governments from more than 60 years , giving powers to dictators and terrorists for their own personal agenda , creating false proofs to justify military interventions in other countries , do n't giving a fuck about un when they say that you ca n't bomb a nation and doing it anyway . 
  but then you blame others , you have the arrogance to state that others are bad and you are not . 
  that is a ** bold ** claim if we look at what is the us policy towards other countries from the end of the ww2 . 
  edit : i never said that soviet union and china are good , while usa is evil . 
  all these 3 countries did atrocities * all * around the world and inside their territory , all of them pushed personal agendas for geopolitical/economic/ideology interests . 
  there is no bad or good country , they are all evil , comparing them is pointless . 
  trying a way to end these actions is the only correct thing . 
  well , this is what happens when countries in the balkans where being governed by ultra nationalists for over 15 years . 
  both croatia and serbia . 
  because serbia is not actually a rich country that can afford to get a big territory such as rs to administrate and make it properly works . 
  also serbia simply does not want to get anymore problems , they want to grow , stabilize and give a better life to all their citizens , annexing rs will be a exponential clusterfuck in every aspect , since all the media will shit on us like in 90s . 
  and all of this will simply stop every step to join eu and to improve the country , it will simply destroy every relation with the other countries that serbia slowly restored in the past 20 years . 
  six lines , i repeat , six lines of text where it 's written that the `` economics ministry has adjusted downward its forecast through 2019 '' . 
  not a single reliable data to compare or see what should be this `` downward forecast '' . 
  then , an entire page of crimea/ukraine/military budgets/syria/old economical things about the * past * and not now . 
  world top `` journalism '' . 
  well , republika srpska is one of the most developed regions in bosnia , this means it will be a real economic problem ( where the situation is already terrible ) for bosnia . 
  well , it 's not something that you can compare . 
  they are different . 
  as u/kinmix wrote :  between the surface and an altitude of 29,000 feet ( 8,800 m ) , no aircraft should come closer vertically than 300 metres , unless some form of horizontal separation is provided ( note : for countries that measure altitude in feet , a 1,000 foot minimum is observed rather than the 984.252 feet found in 300 meters ) . 
  above 29,000 feet ( 8,800 m ) , no aircraft shall come closer than 600 m ( or 2,000 feet ) , except in airspace where reduced vertical separation minima ( rvsm ) can be applied . 
  so the needed vertical separation is 600m . 
  russians had 3 times the vertical separation , they did not break any rules about secure distance between the airplanes . 
  the whole background of the books is taken from real places , cultures , societies , etc. 
  with of course , fantasy and creativity of the the autor . 
  the main background come from the war of the roses that raged on in uk centuries ago . 
  it can be visited with tour or private boats , there is free access but only one dock , for one boat at time . 
  red wedding , offering bread and salt to guests means that they are protected and they should be in a secure place . 
  what walder frey did it 's something against the basic principles of society/religion in westeros , tainting him as the most evil person possible , as well condemning him to the worst possible death . 
  i know , the bread and salt thing was a reference to a famous episode/chapter of game of thrones/a song of ice and fire . 
  sorry but the last time someone offered bread and salt at a wedding , things went a little bit * edgy * . 
  the north remembers . 
  these are also in montenegro , where there is also the yugoslav `` alcatraz '' [ mamula island ] ( http://www.divemontenegro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/mamula-island.jpg ) . 
  try to contact an administrator ( not a moderator ) here on reddit and ask about it . 
  looks like a church/chapel converted into a defensive tower . 
  looks like that moderator reflects perfectly the political/government situation in macedonia . 
  dude , learn jokes . 
   he just did n't care oh please shut up . 
  i would n't mind honestly , it makes no problem at all for me . 
  well , do n't give up !, 
  things will be better if you keep going on . 
  well i do n't think it 's the case of u/myfuckinguser but many ` muricans do that because : * you get a loan !, 
  you get a loan !, 
  everyone gets a loan !, 
  * 30 years later your children have to pay your debts , marvelous . 
  have you considered to live in a shared apartment with other people while you wait to get into a dorm ? 
  also , as a student should n't you have more reasonable prices for public transport and insurance ? 
  here where i live no student does the insurance , the only thing with that are cars . 
  one very important thing is not spending money at the grocery store in fancy branded stuff ( and knowing which stores are more cheap ) , thats the most common way to waste money for food . 
  99 % of time not branded food is good as the rest , but it costs lesser . 
  and planning what to buy for every week , and buy food only once in a week is a very good way to cut expenses . 
  yes please , so we can remove ~ ~ kebab ~ ~ heretics properly . 
  well , you are student , your efforts and expenses should be focused on studying . 
  of course it 's not that you have to live inside an apartment and never go out with friends/evenings/cinema / etc. 
  but at the same time you are not supposed to do it every day . 
  i mean , it 's for sure a good help from the government , as it should motivate young people to also earn money by them self with part time jobs . 
  if someone keeps giving you money to do whatever you want , you will never learn the value of money and how to manage it . 
  i feel bad now , and i envy you . 
  yes , but in denmark the government gives to people reliable and working services in * everything * . 
  thats the problem with balkan countries , except slovenia . 
   `` tri carstvata '' for a moment i thought about 3 of [ these ] ( http://www.alimentipedia.it/files/images/cetriolo.jpg ), 
  * hears in the background danes pissing them self of laughter at `` not bad '' * . 
  pack it up boys . 
  we are done here . 
  when a slovenian says that , the truth ca n't be denied . 
  man i 'm happy romania is getting better every year , mine was just a joke about a freudian slip . 
  we need to go deeper !, 
  serb-catholic-turks-illyrians . 
  so you are now catholic turks ? 
  a whole loaf and a slice ? 
  ~ ~ rich . ~ ~ reich . 
  step 2 : wait for nukes coming from east :|, 
  well , not that a jet has like 50km of range . 
  by this reasoning every time usa makes a new jet , russia should go batshit crazy and blame them for whatever unrealistic reason . 
  as side note : remember that since before the industrial revolution everything we daily use , from smartphones , internet , bar codes , cars etc. 
  is derived from military technology . 
  now i 'm not saying that we should keep creating new ways to kill each other , but it 's thanks to military development in basically every field that we now have this easy and technological life . 
  not the even spanish inquisition was that merciless ahah . 
  italian mafia it 's actually in a pretty bad shape , in the last 20 years the various italian governments went total iron fist on mafia and other crime organizations . 
  basically all the historical and powerful bosses have been caught , thrown in jail under the [ article 41-bis prison regime ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_41-bis_prison_regime ) and they all started to talk . 
  mafia bosses now are youngster idiots who does shit like in the movies , and they get caught even more easily , now with this i 'm not saying that mafia has been removed , but still there have been huge improvements in these years . 
  i think that russia and finland do n't see each other as threats . 
  even the finland minister of defense niinisto said it 's completely normal :  `` earlier russia indicated it was making such moves , for example , the placement of the s-400 in the kola peninsula as well as in the crimea . 
  it is normal practice . 
  russia is using these systems to replace older s-300s . '', 
  they already had anti aircraft missiles on the these borders for decades , as basically every country has . 
  they are upgrading them . 
  exactly , russia may have it 's own agenda but they simply do n't want episodes like iraq to repeat . 
  destabilizing middle-east and north-africa countries may be something `` useful '' for some one in usa but the ones that are paying the consequences are us in europe , not the average red neck in mississippi .
