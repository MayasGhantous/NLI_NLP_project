  dictators are indeed bad and we should push for democracy everywhere in the world , but if the past 60 years of removing ( or creating ) with war dictators did n't worked , why the hell they keep doing that ? 
  there are always different ways , look at iran , until 5 years ago it was impossible even to think that they would create relations with usa and the rest of the west , guess what ? 
  they did it now . 
  russia is the only country that was legally invited and approved to enter in syria by un . 
  the others are not . 
  ** edit : ** this subreddit keeps amazing me , not even the truth is accepted anymore . 
   ridiculous . 
  there has never been one !, 
  sources then !, 
  man , the text of the supreme soviet resolution from 1989 . 
   but there has never been any original apology !!!, 
  as he said , the apologies for what soviet union did towards baltic countries started already in 1989 . 
   i ca n't believe a person is so dumb . 
  your words . 
   and you keep buying russian propaganda . 
  you keep confirming that you simply do n't want to hear anything that is not against russia , you keep confirming that you are right and whatever is said differently from your opinion is false and propaganda . 
   and estonians are not baltic people . . `` estonians ( estonian : eestlased ) are a finnic ethnic group related to the finns that mainly inhabit estonia , a country located south of finland and the finnish gulf . 
  their national language belongs to finnic branch and is known as estonian ( estonian : eesti keel ) . 
  although estonia is often geopolitically categorized as one of the baltics , estonians are linguistically , culturally and historically related to the neighboring finns -- both belonging to the baltic finnic peoples -- differing from the non-finnic indo-european speaking baltic peoples of latvia and lithuania . '', 
  first paragraph from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonians, 
   they are still quite ambiguous about how estonia joined the ussr . 
  so based on that all the rest of apologizing it 's not valid ? 
   source please . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfosguuwtf4  you insult me , did i insulted me ? 
  you insult me , did i insulted you ? 
  * typing error . 
   that 's the thing . 
  russia officially considers itself the liberator of europe , while it was the exact opposite . 
  it was not russia , it was the soviet union lead by a georgian ( slaughter ) man , yes they liberated europe from hitler and nazism with the alliance of usa and uk , you absolutely ca n't deny it . 
  what happened next was * after * the war , the occupation of baltic countries and the rest of the eastern block it 's an historical that happened * after * the end of the war . 
   no , in simple words you are brainwashed . 
  no , you keep pretending to posses the absolute truth , to be right no matter if someone tries to articulate an opinion with you . 
  it 's a big difference . 
  if i would be brainwashed i would not even try to talk with you , i would just insult you ( as you did ) with some old and inappropriate soviet era comment about baltic people . 
   changed russia is not any more soviet union . 
   apologized really ? 
  they teach in schools that what soviet union did was wrong , putin alone almost 10 years ago answered for the 1000th time about how many time they apologized and still baltic journalists kept refusing what he was saying . 
  you insult me , did i insulted me ? 
  no , and this simply showed the double standards how some people , germany apologized and it 's ok , russia did the same , it 's not enough . 
  we clearly have different opinions . 
  see ? 
  only looking at what happened in the past and then saying `` alright they did this wrong that time , they will keep doing wrong '' . 
  by the same reasoning germany should still be a nazi threat to whole world , since they did it once , they will for sure repeat it . 
  that 's you judging the whole country , that 's you not even trying to see a common ground from both parts without thinking that it 's some trick from russia . 
  and even if you are diplomat or something close to that , i do n't agree with your point of view where rejecting every proposal is the only course of action . 
  thats it ? 
  thats you reasoning ? 
  nothing more ? 
  you select single parts of my words and turn them as you like ? 
  you do n't even want a constructive discussion , you just want to be right no matter what . 
  you really pretend to know that diplomatic relations between countries start and work how you think ? 
  so naive i 'd say . 
  trying to find a common organization for airspace and airplanes flying paths near the baltic countries , all of this in accordance with nato is not a start ? 
  it 's again being hostile ? 
  no , thats you just rejecting everything , thats you wanting things happening in black and white tomorrow , in simply words not the real world . 
  relations and better stability starts by building one brick after another from both parts , not one part demanding and entire building ready for the next day . 
  you want better stability ? 
  then even * your * part has to work , at least allowing talks in the first place and not refusing them . 
  i see many things wrong with russia , because i 've also worked an lived there , and this why i want europe and russia to work together , because russia can learn a lot from other countries in every subject . 
  so it 's just no , just hating each other without any kind evolution towards better stability ? 
  simply no , fuck off , we do n't want to speak to you . 
  this for me is wrong . 
  yes , putin pays me in gold shills . 
  they should begin from somewhere , right ? 
  i think that baltic countries are the perfect start if russia * really * wants to improve relations with whole europe . 
  so every one around there knows that there are problems with airspace violations , provocations etc. 
  then if nato or other russia not `` influenced '' countries want talk about that , every one is ok . 
  when russia want to talk about that , to perhaps * try * to improve the situation , the answer is no . 
  and it 's not only no , it 's also added with statements like :  sang added that the invite from moscow was likely meant `` to play [ nato ] members against each other . '', 
  i actually do n't know anymore who is going in * full retard * mode . 
  ** edit : ** i get downvoted because i say that refusing any kind conversation or opening towards russia is seen as evil and bad here in r/europe ? 
  are you guys really serious ? 
  none of you would like to see russia rebuild relations with baltic countries and europe ? 
  allowing the people like us to live in peace without fear . 
  lol , you really have never been in a true war and you just proved you do n't know history of the balkans . 
  and even if you had `` 800 years '' of war you never experienced a fraction of it . 
  have a nice day war lover . 
  the troubles are not even comparable with the balkan wars , in every aspect , from destruction , to deaths , to the changes of society and countries . 
  oh please do n't even try to tell me that ira terror attack are comparable to full escalated wars in from 1991 to 1995 , and from 1998 to 2001 almost , in the balkans . 
  it 's so easy for you to cheer at war , but perhaps you never experienced war on your own skin , you never lost parents , friends , the country that was created thanks to your grandpa fighting against the nazis . 
  you sit in your room from ireland , not from sarajevo or ukraine , you see the media and point your finger painting things in black and white . 
  you have no idea of what are the consequences of full wars , not only the destruction of buildings and the death of people , it 's more deep , it 's the society that changes , the way people changes , but this is something that you ca n't experience just by watching television . 
  you should shut up before warmongering , because unless you did n't experienced war you do n't know shit . 
  because i honestly find stupid this move by the usa , to me it looks like more the last efforts of obama to try to do something . 
  the problem is that doing this `` something '' it 's potentially dangerous for europe , ukraine should get equipment , training and weapons from european countries , what the hell usa has to do in ukraine , they are not even in nato , it 's stupid , it 's even more warmongering with russia , it 's the opposite of how russia and usa are at least trying to work in syria . 
  i 'd rather not , thanks . 
  man , learn to understand sarcasm . 
  i hope for obama that he will look at what bush did and how , also at what hillary suggested to do in libya and syria , and then he will not repeat the mistakes of the past . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  are you saying that the mighty iraqi army that was trained by the us ( after they kicked out all the commanders from saddam army ) left cowardly every battle against isis allowing them to loot all the us equipment ? 
  impossible !, 
  perhaps it 's obama trying to do the last `` big '' things to be remembered before finishing his time as president ? 
  ok , but this time please do n't let it get looted by the separatists . 
  was it called * operation : remove kebab * ? 
  keep going . 
  because you are an arm chair general that knows what is the correct strategy for a such hypothetical and unrealistic fact ? 
  the majority of folks like you that `` knows '' still think that the geopolitical , social and historical situation that lead to the ukrainian war is comparable to the baltic states or to poland . 
  or in more simple terms it 's like comparing oranges with car windows . 
  at the same time the same majority of people like you still denies in every possible way what lead to maidan and how poro\u0161enko got power , but of course i 'm just a putin shill who spreads false information . 
  put more effort in your baiting and perhaps i may build a `` concentration camp '' just for you .
