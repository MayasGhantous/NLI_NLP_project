  welcome to r/europe , where biased thoughts are the truth and were the truth is being biased . 
  honestly , what do you pretend from an article like that ? 
  it 's pure sensationalism made to sell copies and subscriptions on the web site , also the article is from june 2015 . 
  nothing new , it 's just op pushing some agenda or farming karma . 
  the whole `` concentration camps '' story has been debunked hundreds of times . 
  [ this thread ] ( https://giphy.com/gifs/editingandlayout-dnp2vxyvlw2nw ), 
  thats the problem , usa right now can only vote 2 evils and nothing else . 
  it 's sad . 
  the fact is that trump said many many times that usa should pull of from middle east and all the shit thing they are doing . 
  hillary on the other side will just do thing worse on that side . 
   on the other side nato also has some reconnaissance flights without transponders on . 
  nice lyes , nato sent a spy plane almost inside russian territory not even one month ago with transponders off . 
   2 ) russian air force does n't give notice of exercises and routes of their flights in international air space . 
  again lyes , russia and nato always inform each other when they do military exercises . 
   3 ) russian planes perform risky intercept maneuvers on nato assets in international air space and sea . 
  yeah , keep sticking with that , i bet you never saw how the sea borders near st.petersburg and kaliningrad looks like , and it 's incredibly difficult for all countries military jets to fly correctly in these regions . 
  because hillary it 's a peaceful sane person , am i wrong ? 
  no mate , grozny has been defined by un the most destroyed city on hearth . 
  the horrors that happened in chechnya are far worse of what happened in jugoslavia . 
  and you should also check that there they had 2 wars in the same place , one worse of the other . 
  after 20 years some people still believes that there will be war . 
  people are stupid . 
  well , when jugoslavia and serbia were at war russia was a joke country , with yeltsin constantly drunk giving away national industries to the oligarchs . 
  then you add what was happening in chechnya ( which was far worse of balkan wars ) and you get a huge country not even able to piss in the toiled . 
  also , if russia would have helped it would have been a very bad thing , since having in the same country and war nato against russia . 
   so you admit serbia was complicit ? 
  you really do n't have any other arguments and instead you opt to turn the subject of the discussion on who started the war ? 
  really ? 
   source ? 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  do you even live in bosnia ?

  i can go on for hours , more in deep sources http://iacenter.org/warcrime/4_infra.htm , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_yugoslavia  serbia is still one of the poorest countries in europe , much like bosnia . 
  we are talking about bosnia , nice changing the subject again , really objective , wow !, 
  serbia is still poor compared to norway , congratulations on discovering the warm water . 
  serbia actual situation is far better of bosnia and if you try to say otherwise because in bosnia the salary per capita is higher you are just a clown . 
  yeah , i 'm slow . 
  nope , i 'm saying that serbia went trough 2 fronts war against croatians and muslims/bosniaks , had to already deal with kosovo first rise of uck , all of this from 1991 to 1995 . 
  then after 1995 , with already economic , infrastructure and industry losses for dozens of billions of dollars , it had to deal with all the clusterfuck in kosovo and get bombed by nato in 1999 . 
  losing even more important infrastructure and industries ( bombing all the major bridges , losing zastava main factory etc. ), 
  which were $ 29.6 billion in terms of money as i already wrote . 
  so , in conclusion serbia had many problems for even many years , they did not had the economic help from other countries as bosnia had , still serbia now is in a better situation . 
  bosnia problems in 2016 are not related with what happened over 20 years ago , the problems are related to the various governments and how corrupt and inefficient they were/are . 
  blaming the war right now is just an excuse to do n't accept their own flaws . 
  keep baiting . 
  no dude , your numbers are wrong , they killed 30 % of the population and deported more that 90 % of it . 
  after the war no one was living in bosnia anymore . 
  dead or figures according to research and documentation center in sarajevo ( 2012 ) from all ethnicities : * soldiers - 57,701 * civilians - 38,239 population in bosnia in 1996 : 3,645,000 millions people . 
  is this the only answer that you really can write ? 
  or you are just trolling ? 
  because of course , republika srpska illegal paramilitary tracked and killed on purpose all the people that were related with bosnian industry just to prevent the same bosnian industry to develop in the next 20 years , even if the same illegal paramilitary soldiers live in bosnia as well . 
  brilliant !, 
  serbia lost a total of $ 29.6 billion only from the nato bombing in 1999 , according to a group of economists from the g17 plus party . 
  edit : why the hell you folks bring up the ethnic cleansing in every topic ? 
  tell me how that can be related anyhow with the fact that the industries are shit and that they are managed by retarded corrupts ? 
   our industry never recovered from the aggression i disagree , the industry was given to corrupt , inefficient and unskilled people , who just sucked from it all the money they could without develop anything . 
  blaming the war after it ended in 1995 is wrong , serbia lost major industries and infrastructures after the 1999 bombings , as well was still recovering from the first balkan war , still , it was able to rebuild . 
  hello , fuck off with your ignorance . 
  muslims from bosnia are completely different in manners , culture , society etc.
