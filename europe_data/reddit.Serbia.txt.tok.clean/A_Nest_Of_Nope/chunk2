  i was always wrong , the history on books is trash !, 
  i have been manipulated all this time , from now until my death i will only believe on youtube comments . 
  of course , we serbs are all hyper nationalists chetniks who want to kill and rape every subhuman albanian muslim in our holy land , oh and i forgot that we will soon join the russian empire which will cleanse the entire world from the muslim filth . 
  cause yes , we are not normal people living in a normal country who want to live in peace . 
  justbalkanthings ( yes slovenia , you are in the balkans ), 
  i already smell another thread derailed to insult each other about who started the war . 
  oh , the love serbs get in r/europe . 
  maybe if every dude from kosovo has the same smart idea of this one , soon this land will be empty and it will come back to serbia ? 
  i want to believe . 
  is also hispanic / s, 
  my grandfather , who fought as partisan in ww2 , is turning in his tomb after this statement . 
  justcrusadethings, 
  i lost my shit looking at kosovo and jewish republic of turkey, 
  dude , if this ever happens there will be mass jerking on pubblic by senate and pentagon . 
   ~ ~ russians ~ ~ germans , 
  and drugs and enslaved/forced prostitutes . 
  russia is gon na collapse . 
  awwwwww there is too much hate , we need to create a big lovely country with serbia and albania . 
  oh wait , there is kosovo in the middle , nevermind , let 's invade them [ boys ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0qs4ovu0gy ) . 
   newb let 's say a troll newb . 
  to be honest i do n't think things gon na be worse with russians in albania , maybe better . 
  english , italian and serbian . 
  also i understand a little bit of russian . 
  i 'm curious to see what the western countires will do in this . 
  since we are talking of true ** human slavery and racism ** , with all the oil this country exports it will not surprise me if literally * nothing * will change . 
  * do you want a blitzkrieg ? 
  because this is how you get a blitzkrieg . 
  it was n't perfect , i know it , but the same things were happening all over europe , also it was a country with more or less 20 years of life , how can you expect stability in a such place during these years . 
  actually you ca n't compare things happened in 1900 ' with the war from 1991 to 1995 . 
  in the last years of the ottoman empire , serbian population was able to get more and more freedom during the [ serbian revolution ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbian_revolution ) , in the 1804 [ principality of serbia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principality_of_serbia ) was finally created and with more people demanding to be free from the ottoman empire in the 1882 [ kingdom of serbia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_serbia ) was born . 
  this is what they wanted to achieve with the so called * greater serbia * , not kill all people . 
  in 1914 gavrilo princip killed archduke franz ferdinand and his wife , this act was the last spark wich started the world war i after the political conflicts and the greed of many countries were growing in europe . 
  at the end of the world war i , in 1918 the [ kingdom of yugoslvavia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_yugoslavia ) was created , it was n't the * huge * kingdom of serbia , it was was the kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenes since every region of the balkans wanted to create a united country , this country would lasted even in these days but wait , some [ folk ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adolf_hitler ) from germany had some delusions of power and wanted to take the whole europe under his [ flag ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q6yxsqb.png ) . 
  serbians of bosnia wanted to live in peace . 
  the one who wanted to annex serbian populated zones of bosnia to serbia/yugoslavia were karad\u017ei\u0107 and mladic . 
  karad\u017ei\u0107 was a retarded extremist even for milosevic , he signed the peace truce in greece but when he came back in bosnia he just said `` i do n't care , fuck off '' and restarted to mess all up with mladic . 
  and so what ? 
  black hand organization was extreme during their time ( 1900s ) , but their ideas were what most of the common people was thinking . 
  we were able to be free from the ottoman empire after nearly 800 years and guess what ? 
  the austro-hungarian empire came and replaced them . 
  wtf germany . 
  also go home china , you are drunk . 
  you changed your original post . 
  no , i 'm not accusing you , in the original post you said something * wise * , but then posts from people like u/pladimir _ vutin started to pop up , posts where they just started to accuse russia and russian people for the dead of these children withuot explaning a single true fact , all this to spread more hate towards this country . 
  he purposely changed the topic of this thread , then other people started to follow him posting other misleading things , like the terrorists attack on the theater , or accusing russian government for `` no control '' when the bombings in the moscow metro happened , all this infuariated me , because i was in moscow when these attacks happened and to attack the russian government it 's retarded , it 's disrespectful to all the dead innocents and to all policemen and militarymen who died to save the russian people from terrorists . 
  me and u/deekan where the only ones who have tried to explain what happened in beslan . 
  it 's nice to see how a commemorative post about a terrible thing is being turned again in anti-russia propaganda , this subreddit starts to really disgust me . 
  looks like here anybody does not give a single fuck about the children died in beslan school . 
  seriuosly , the second post is  the deaths were caused by the russian military which opened fire indiscriminately without warning on the school killing many of the children by who ? 
  u/pladimir _ vutin , well fuck you dude . 
  you just came here to spread more and more hate when you do n't know the facts ( or you are simply manipulating them ) . 
  russian ** spetsnaz ** ( and not casual military ) stormed the school at the third day , after the terrorists started to detonate the explosives placed all over the school . 
  during the firefight parents of children broke out the security zone around the school and entered inside the building with the result of even more deaths . 
  because fuck russia , terrorist did a hell of good job right ? 
   emma bonino and susanna agnelli , both seasoned politicians with long careers and much experience . 
  ** bullshit ** they literally did nothing in their whole political carrer in italy and in europe . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emma_bonino - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/susanna_agnelli mocking federica mogherini because it was elected 6 months ago as foreign minister it 's just utterly retaded , it 's like mocking obama as inefficient one week after his election as president of the united stases . 
  the stupidity of this subreddit is skyrocketing . 
  sounds like a viking right before beheading you with an axe . 
  no slovenians !, 
  aight, 
  i think europe should create his own army , since we are like a big country we should share soldiers and military stuff . 
  i think we depend too much on usa on what to do every time shit hits the fan , i feel like a dumb kid ( europe ) who ca n't buy some icecream without a big kid ( usa ) tells me wich flavor i have to choose . 
  for example the infinite circlejerk of the infamous ** f35 ** , every single aircraft engineer says `` this plane is an exponential bullshit '' . 
  now since usa declared illegal exporting the f22 all european countries started to rant ** fuck this , we want it too !, 
  ** , the usa said alright , give them the dumb broder of the f22 with some fancy words like * multyrole , nextgeneration , nato army standardization * . 
  and then we are here , every time an f35 fly something goes wrong , but no , european countries still want to buy it , but looks like they forgot that one f35 costs 150 milion dollars . 
  also we forgot that in europe have been created these planes ( wich are better of the f35 ) : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurofighter_typhoon 63 milion euros http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saab_jas_39_gripen 69 milion euros http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dassault_rafale 70 milion euros and yet there is russian aircrafts wich are good . 
  hey look !, 
  it 's the same serbian guy who killed an albanian in switzerland !, 
  oh nevermind , the killer was albanian too ... 
  you forgot what one serbian soldier , armed with the ultimate accordion , was able to shot down . 
  to be honest , i really do n't think that things are going on like this . 
  i 'm the only one here thinking that latvia , estonia and lithuania are just freaking out just because minister mogherini is not screaming ** fuck russia !!! 11 !, 
  ** like they are doing ? 
  italy is in a hard economic crisis right now and cutting all import/export and economic plans with russia would be a suicide for this country . 
  italy has almost zero energy like gas and generation of electricity , they buy all from other countries , especially from russia and the prices of bills there are astronomic compared to the other countries . 
  latvia , estonia and lithuania right now are just spreading lies and terror because they still think italy is just * pizza , pasta and mafia * , when ( in my opinion ) they do n't know fucking nothing about this country as the majority of r/europe . 
  italy will never side with russia , or will never become a new part of russian federation , we have much worse problems in this country to think about before russia . 
  you forget that there is not only europe and usa in this world , china , kazhakstan , mongolia , iran , japan , india and the south american countries ( if i 'm not wrong ) just do n't give a fuck about sanctions . 
  even germany ca n't just stop imports from them , the risk for their economy is too high . 
  putting sanctions on north korea is one thing , putting sanctions on russia is a really stupid move . 
  instead of doing this bullshit , the west countries should find other ways to resolve things , since starting to yell `` fuck you '' at one of the most powerful country in the world is not a good idea . 
  then russia will post a map where on canada will be written ** soon **, 
   the russian economy is already struggling . 
  i do n't think so , the western sanctions are creating some kind of problems now , but nothing serious to really bother them . 
  if the sanctions will be more hard and for more time , russia will simply start to invest more in his industrial/agricultural/energetic sistem and in their ** huge ** mineral resources . 
  russia has almost everything in their immense territory . 
  ah , let 's start an informative article with a sentence that already tries to force your point of view . 
  then it 's even worse to be honest , because what do we know if this guy says the same things to his students forcing them to have his perspective ? 
  edit : i read his bio on the wiki page , this guy is a knight of the ` muricans assholes . 
   russian president vladimir putin , the argument goes , annexed crimea out of a long-standing desire to resuscitate the soviet empire . 
  i stopped reading here . 
  thanks random journalist to do n't reporting the things by a neutral perspective and by adding your personal hate toward russia . 
   i wonder if this is an attempt at consolidating power . 
  this . 
  we know what happened in the past governments in ukraine , let 's hope this will not happen again . 
  also how he plans to remove in a democratic way `` allies of the militants-separatist '' if they will be elected again ? 
  interrogation of one captured soldier : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ttur1y-ui4 some one says it 's staged , some one claims it 's all real . 
  here if you do n't use the bidet after you cleaned yourself with toilet paper it 's considerd something not hygienic/not good .
