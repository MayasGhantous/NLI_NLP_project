  none , bye . 
  put more effort in trolling mate . 
  shhh , you are thinking objectively , they are gon na skin you alive for this , 
   quite simply he is trying to hold on to the only electorate which still keeps him in power ** cough ** ~ ~ nationalists ~ ~ neo-nazis ** cough ** . 
  til : russia and ussr are the same thing !, 
  wow !, 
  yeah , continue to add out of context bullshit , let 's forget russia foreign policy from 1991 to 2008 also * without * considering usa and nato foreign policy in the same years , right ? 
  because nobody cares that they are related . 
  what the actual fuck crimea has to do with this context ? 
  seriously ? 
  the bloody missile platforms in poland and the nato ships in the barrens sea are there from the ** two fucking thousand seven ** . 
  while crimea mess happened in 2014 . 
  yeah , then why nato built the bases on the first place ? 
  the base in poland has being build to defend from who ? 
  please do n't even try to say iran . 
  because these missile bases are literally gon na stop an hypothetical russian attack ? 
  where just thinking about such scenario it 's beyond retardation . 
  because the concept of a platform that can use different type of missiles is something in the spectrum sci-fi , right ? 
  but yeah , nato ships with all kinds of missiles that are patrolling the barrens and black sea are there `` just '' to defend from who ? 
  iran again , really ? 
  but yeah , i 'm a putinshill , the fact that i find all these fear mongering `` articles '' just pure garbage , that basically alienate the population from reality , the fact that the arms build up of nato * after * soviet union collapse for me it 's just stupidity , the fact that the nato bombers patrolling aerial space of russia never gets reported on media , but when russians do the same this subreddit ejaculates exponentially it 's just incomprehensible to me and to people with a little bit of common sense , all of this does not matter . 
  it only matters that when nato does something it 's fine , and it 's just to `` defend '' , but when russia does the same * after * nato , it 's fear mongering , it 's new russian imperialism , it 's new soviet union , right ? 
  yeah right , i absolutely have no idea of what i 'm talking about : [ nato missile defence system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_missile_defence_system )  in april 2007 , nato 's european allies called for a nato missile defence system which would complement the american national missile defense system to protect europe from missile attacks and nato 's decision-making north atlantic council held consultations on missile defence in the first meeting on the topic at such a senior level . 
  [ 2 ] in response , russian prime minister vladimir putin claimed that such a deployment could lead to a new arms race and could enhance the likelihood of mutual destruction . 
  he also suggested that his country would freeze its compliance with the 1990 treaty on conventional armed forces in europe ( cfe ) -- which limits military deployments across the continent -- until all nato countries had ratified the adapted cfe treaty . 
  [ 3 ] secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer claimed the system would not affect strategic balance or threaten russia , as the plan is to base only ten interceptor missiles in poland with an associated radar in the czech republic . 
  [ 4 ] i still have no idea of what i 'm talking about , sure . 
  [ united states missile defense complex in poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_missile_defense_complex_in_poland ) yep , i 'm just pulling things out of my ass . 
  [ mim-104 patriot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mim-104_patriot )  on 17 september 2009 , u.s. president barack obama announced that the planned deployment of long-range ** missile defence interceptors and equipment in poland and the czech republic was not to go forward ** , and that a defence against short - and medium-range missiles using aegis warships would be deployed instead . 
  [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] following the change in plans , russian president dimitri medvedev announced that a proposed russian iskander surface to surface missile deployment in nearby kaliningrad would also not go ahead . 
  the two deployment cancellation announcements were later followed with a statement by newly named nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen calling for a strategic partnership between russia and the alliance , explicitly involving technological cooperation of the two parties ' missile defence systems . 
  [ 17 ] but yeah , it 's russia the one started it all , right ? 
  well , actually is nato that started it by placing long range missiles pointed towards russia in their eastern european countries as `` defence measure '' . 
  it 's just another day , with another fear mongering `` article '' . 
  in the same way russians think about how nato missiles pose a threat to russia . 
  this goes on from almost 60 years . 
  do n't say it loud , they may really print the tomorrow issue with this headline . 
  is me or poroshenko is really trying everything to alienate and being hated by ethnic russians living in ukraine ? 
  i 'm not referring to separatists , but to common people like farmers and workers that are caught in the crossfire of all that mess . 
  is information napalm reliable ? 
  i 've never heard or read something from them . 
  that 's a new from r/europe , putin has been put there by oligarchs . 
  sorry mate , you are confusing russia with ukraine . 
  oh look serbia shows again how our politics are retarded . 
  that . 
  city . 
  this photo is misleading in every possible way , that 's just the historic centre , which is not even 1/10 of the city , you can literally see all of that part in 5 minutes . 
  the rest of the city is basically one way roads always packed with buses , trams , cars and fucking speed cameras every where . 
  all of this within dirty and grey living blocks , it 's always incredibly dirty . 
  the train station zone gives you depression instantly . 
  mestre was basically built to give a place for all the people that were working in the industrial naval and refinery zone in the area ( which is bigger than the city ) . 
  it is by far one of the worst cities in italy , the same people living in mestre hate it . 
  vienna is absolutely beautiful . 
  well , it depends by your taste in my opinion , i think that italians would really struggle with turkish coffee . 
  false , they invested a lot in the country , but they do n't own it in any way . 
   one montenegrin tried to convince me they are illyrians . 
  you just met a salty albanian with a bit of `` mhu great albania !! 11 ! '', 
  mentality . 
  is this a cheap try to provoke more balkan drama ? 
  lol . 
  i lived in italy for years and basically all the tourists or foreigners complain how italians drive . 
  every time they make me smile on how they would react driving in montenegro . 
  my girlfriend ( from another eastern european country ) was utterly shocked when we went in montenegro . 
  have you looked at some general world poverty graphs in the last 15 years ? 
  because yes , some poor countries have and huge population with huge birth rate , but every year the levels of poverty on the world are lowering drastically . 
  so no , the `` high population growth is a threat to the planet '' is a myth . 
  because aliens . 
  history revisionism at his peak . 
  i guess that every time someone asks you that question you literally have an orgasm knowing that you will write down how evil nazi is serbia and serbian people in their dna . 
  keep hating, 
  bullshit , people were screaming at the same thing with china and india 20 years ago , turns out that every country that gets to a certain level of development ( exactly like china and india ) stops making 5/6 children for every family , and do 1 or 2 at max . 
   less country development -  lower standard of living -  less health -  highest probability to die before reaching puberty -  more birthrate to have at least one child living . 
   more country development -  higher standard of living -  more health -  lesser/none probability to die before reaching puberty -  lower birthrate since the children are almost guaranteed to live . 
   every people has a gun  rampant racism  trump gets elected `` there is still hope for america '' you made me laugh pretty hard , lol, 
   ~ ~ russian ~ ~ united states culture is disgusting and depressing , mired by imperialism , superstition , and oppression from elites . 
  i would like to see how different these 2 countries are based on your * smart * opinion . 
  oh , alright !, 
  fun fact : giuseppe garibaldi , who with his * mille * ( thousand ) unified italy , was actually a slaver in south america before being given the role to unify italy by savoia 's . 
  we did wars for less mate . 
  we are both equally retarded . 
  if we really want to be precise the picture of tesla on r/serbia is there from years , not even when the sub has been graphical changed the picture was removed/changed . 
  on the other hand r/croatia changed their graphic layout in the last days and also added the picture of tesla . 
  so , i really do n't want any fight , but to me it looks like that some one on r/croatia did it on purpose to create some ol balkan drama  edit : look at those juicy downvotes , you folks really need to relax . 
  oh look , a negative comment about russia in a russian related thread aaand is the most voted one , r/europe never disappoints . 
  i bet you are from veneto . 
  something something the `` walk of shame '' that swedish government had to do with the iranians ? 
  so you see my flair and you just jump on comparing italy to serbia ? 
  wow , so smart !, 
  you folks are way more than biased . 
  slow grow ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  the entire eu is growing basically double the pace than italy and you call it slow grow ? 
  since 2011 there have been only technical governments not elected by italian citizens , all of these government just kept cutting some spending to then raise some other tax , all this while increasing the public debt , keep increasing the deficit and keep asking for more money from eu . 
  youth unemployment rate : 40.1 % yeah , slow growing , $ 173 millions to nato will not change anything to italian economy . 
  right . 
  lol , from 0 to serbian nationalist putin lover . 
  reddit never disappoints . 
  would you not agree that a country ( where i lived for over 20 years ) should spend more money in restoring their economy instead of funding nato ? 
  at least for the period of time needed to exit the recession ? 
  i like how italy is actually one of the worse economies in europe after greece but whatever , let 's give to nato $ 173 millions every year .
