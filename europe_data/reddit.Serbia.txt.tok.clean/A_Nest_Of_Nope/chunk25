  well , with 50k inhabitants they are towns . 
  dude . 
   the first comment really ? 
  then could you please prove that what i wrote in the first comment is wrong ? 
  dude , my only comment on the republika srpska photos thread was actually a condemnation agains the author of the thread . 
  ah , and not even try to compare kosovo with bosnia , they are two things completely different . 
  fucking learn how bosnia and republika srpska were created . 
  butthurt ? 
  there are no `` kosovan '' things , it 's not even a recognised word . 
  learn what ? 
  an albanian terroristic organization infiltrated macedonia with the purpose to take over the country or to secede a part of it in the purpose to create the so called greater albania . 
  the same organization had and has original members of kla , that was recognised as illegal para-military group ( and even terrorist group ) . 
  some of the leaders of kla are internationally recognised criminals wanted by interpol , their leader hashim tha\u00e7i is a recognised criminal that now is the president of kosovo , he is involved in drug dealing , theft , corruption , weapons smuggling and human organs trafficking . 
  the very same albanian terrorists have been funded , trained and backed on field by usa forces , and it 's been fucking proven , especially after [ the ara\u010dinovo crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_insurgency_in_the_republic_of_macedonia#the_ara.c4.8dinovo_crisis ) where a us general ordered the macedonian army intervention to stop in that battle since there were cia operatives on the field and they were getting kicked in their asses by the macedonian army . 
  so do n't even try to come here telling me bullshit about `` macedonia surrended hurr durr '' , the ohrid treaty was done only because they threatened macedonia with sanctions , do n't even try to sell the bullshit story of `` albanians were in mortar range of skopje '' . 
   kosovan churches they are all built by serbs where kosovo has been always part of slavic populations , and part of serbia since 1000 . 
  so no , they are not `` kosovan '' churches , for fucks sake stop bending history , they are serbian orthodox churches . 
  yes and your country kicked their asses , at least you did not get bombed by nato for doing so . 
   you guys are all speaking the same language you just triggered all the mountain serbs , 
  the last photo description is ** fucking wrong ** , my grand dad would literally roll in his grave after reading it . 
   honoring the world war two struggle against fascism and the ~ ~ serbian ~ ~ ** yugoslavian ** victims that were lost . 
  you just described all the major cities in europe . 
  for once balkans can be a good example in europe , how secular and integrated is islam in these countries should be the standard for the muslims migrating in western europe . 
  ( yeah , i know there are some zealot muslims with long beards and arab clothes in bosnia , but they are an absolute ** minority ** and a new thing seen badly by the rest of the muslim population in the balkans ) . 
  not even in italy people say hello to strangers , you can expect a bad stare at maximum , and if you are an immigrant from africa wearing worn out clothes you could even get insulted or yelled . 
  yes it is buuut a lot of times companies where people are employed ( especially if you are not from singapore ) help their employees in the beginning with the rent . 
  some companies even pay the full rent . 
  add that to the fact that the wage tax is about 20 % in singapore and you are likely to save up some nice cash . 
   also people speak my language and do n't say hello on the street . 
   username : latvian ** lion ** aaalright . 
  jokes aside , i understand you point . 
  if i 'll move to luxembourg i 'd rather struggle for a bit the first months to remain living there , instead of going back to latvia . 
  yeah , you get $ 2000 every month , but then you spend $ 1700 for rent + bills + living . 
  the cost of living in luxembourg or switzerland is incredibly high . 
  if you want to get trucks of money and have almost 0 taxes or expenses you have to live in the gulf countries or in singapore . 
  that frame where clinton pats on a shoulder vu\u010di\u0107 made me cringe . 
  this is incredibly sad . 
  yeah right , comparing 19th century facts where a country invaded , occupied for centuries and imposed their religion in other countries , is the same as comparing facts in 2016 about 2 ethnicities inside the same country . 
  yeah right . 
  hey mate , how are things going after hdz stole basically everything they could leaving the country with the public debt growing exponentially ? 
  but it 's ok right ? 
  mhu catholic and pure croatia it 's better even if people still get paid shit . 
  shhh do n't try to reason with facts about russia on r/europe , you will be just labeled as a putinbot . 
  man , nla `` insurgence '' was stopped by macedonian army an police in every single battle or military action , this up set a lot of folks back in the us . 
  nla literally got their asses kicked . 
  the only motivation of why the ceasefire happened it 's because usa threatened the macedonian government with sanctions , they literally underestimate macedonian army and capabilities https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_insurgency_in_the_republic_of_macedonia, 
  are serious ? 
  i mean , really ? 
  you are really convinced that what happened in the balkans from 1990 was all due to karad\u017ei\u0107 ( a nationalistic retard in power in bosnia , and not jugoslavia , that prolonged the war by almost 3 years when he completely fucked up the crete peace talks where milo\u0161evi\u0107 , izetbegovi\u0107 and tu\u0111man all agreed to stop the conflict ) . 
  no one in jugoslavia had something to say agains macedonia when they spilt , because it was the only country where the population really wanted it , and not as it happened in the other ones . 
  macedonia from always has normal diplomatic relations with serbia and montenegro , the only ones that they hate are the albanians from outside macedonia , who literally tried to seize a part of the country to annex it to kosovo . 
  basically no albanians from macedonia was involved in all that shit , this should make you understand how different albanians there are . 
  play dumb ? 
  are you a greek nationalists butthurt for the macedonia name thing ? 
  the country was working more or less before the * current * government , which is another matter that does not have any connection with the insane idea of splitting the country now . 
  the round 2 bullets were not fired by macedonians in macedonia , but by albanians from albania and kosovo , which is different from what was happening in the rest of ex-yugoslavia . 
  no thanks for fucks sake , stop fuelling separatists . 
  macedonia is the only country that split from jugoslavia in a complete democratic way , without firing a single bullet . 
  or the us official is still salty for that time in 2001 when albanian terrorists ( trained and backed by usa ) have been kicked in the teeth by the macedonian army ? 
  this is what happens when after the war you get people in government that are supporters of usta\u0161e . 
  that in the real rural areas with literally almost no connection to the rest of the country , the places in these photos are medium/large towns connected with the rest of the country from centuries . 
  the folks in the pictures used to wear the classic eastern european clothes from the 20s , more or less . 
  r/shitamericanssay worthy comment . 
  these are indeed nice historical photos , at the same time let us remember that people in the pictures were dressed with folk clothes on purpose . 
  they did not wear that staff all the day every day in the 20s . 
   used to be good nation and neighbor but then putin got `` elected '' and everything went to hell . 
  yeah , because russia the drunk of the world run by yeltsin was the best thing ever . 
  try to say that to someone who lived in russia around 1992 . 
  man , what 's wrong with you ? 
  or you are just a troll probably . 
  err , you should read again what i wrote . 
  moving or transporting all this stuff is expensive , incredibly expensive , and it is a waste of money because there are already american vehicles , structures and soldiers in these eastern european countries , with also the armies of the these countries as well . 
  no one here us talking about russian army , so stop trying to change the subject of the argument . 
  i really hope there will be not a real war , still , moving all this military equipment because obama administration is desperate do provoke in any possible way russia , before the presidency of trump , it 's literally a total waste of american taxpayers money . 
  these paints schemes will make all these vehicles blend so well in the eastern european environment . 
  lol . 
  i do n't understand how you people in uk are literally not mass revolting about the railways , i have to commute from woking to london and the price per year is over # 2900 . 
  almost 3 grands to sit in a train for not even an hour . 
  for fucks sake . 
  it 's christmas , 
  it 's 2016 and i agree with what u/h2ppyme wrote , this is year is full of surprises . 
  aaand isis appeared lol . 
  well , actually thats depressing since it 's true . 
  stopped from what exactly ? 
  italian apple farmers for example . 
  yeah ? 
  the only achievement of such sanctions that i see is folks on this subreddit forecasting the downfall of russia from more than 2 years and still nothing even close to that happened . 
  meanwhile russia has increased it 's gold reserves exponentially , heavily invested in it 's own production of goods that are under sanctions if traded from eu , exponentially increased trades with china , iran , india and it 's also talking with japan about that . 
  already started the building of infrastructures to trade faster with china etc. 
  but no shit sherlock , russia has the gpd of italy and is a shit country , lol . 
  lol this guy . 
  and even today we have witnessed a person really believing that russia will invade an eu or nato country . 
  seriously ? 
  with all the agenda pushing of very known users in this subreddit you remove it as non on-topic ? 
  what the actual fuck is wrong with you people ? 
  this guy is justifying a fucking nazist , [ ante paveli\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ante_paveli%c4%87 ) , because he thinks that ( of course ) serbs suppressed croats during tito years , hiding the fucking fact that slovenians , muslims , montenegrins , macedonians and the very same fucking croats repressed croats as well . 
  putting on the same fucking level how ante paveli\u0107 repressed people to how were people repressed by tito , which was on a completely fucking different scale of level . 
  hiding the fact that most of the fucking croats he refers were nazis escaped all around the world and magically popped out in jugoslavia during the 1991-1995 war . 
  hiding the fact that after the world war 2 yugoslavian secret service , for example , patrolling train stations or public places baited usta\u0161e exposing them by simply shouting `` za dom spremni ! '', 
  out loud and catching the fucking retards , that had so few brain to raise the right hand and shouting that vile phrase back .
