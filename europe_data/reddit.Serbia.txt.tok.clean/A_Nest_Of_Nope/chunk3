  i guess it 's an italian stereotype . 
  for me it 's strange to do n't use them . 
  here in italy it 's just a joke , at least for me and my friends . 
  well here in italy the combo toilet + bidet it 's a very rare sight . 
  i never had a chance to use it , looks a good idea and you also safe a lot of space in your bathroom . 
  and then why i did not find a single one when i was in paris ? 
  to be honest i would like to know what you people , from countries where there is no bidets , do to wash/clean yourself after a successful shit launch . 
  using a shower looks unconfortable since you have to totally undress , not washing yourself does not look a good thing . 
  `` the lovers are french '' i would nope the fuck out , you guys do n't have ** bidets ** damn dirty frenches, 
  i would visit ` murica , only if you guarantee me that i will not be drowned in dangerous amounts of freedom . 
  alright , i corrected the message , thanks stranger norgegrammarnazi . 
  i 'm from my mother part serbian and i can say that unfortunately there is ignorant , primitive and arrogant serbs . 
  or i 'm just an internet noob and i ca n't detect sarcasm . 
  and what makes a serbian guy having a blood feud with an albanian guy in switzerland ? 
  1 - they are/were criminals , it is well known that serbian mafia and albanian ( drugs related ) criminal organization are spread in whole europe . 
  2 - the albanian guy did something wrong to a serbian guy , this is probably and often something about religion . 
  since there is even in serbia ignorant/primitive people , they tend to hate albanians just because they are albanians and because most of them are muslim . 
  this is my opinion , but i would like to read updates when the swiss police will find out what was going on . 
  i dod n't think a psychopath/crazy serbian dude went into a mosque and killed with no reason who ? 
  i would like to see some updates after the swiss police investigation . 
  we are indeed good people , but thanks to some dudes in r/europe and some personal real life experience there is a lot of people who see us as the supreme evil of europe ( well not like putin ) . 
  thanks random hyer-nationalistic serbian . 
  now the world as another motivation to keep hating the normal serbian people . 
  do you think it 's normal to see pictures of these guys in homes , and even on big billborards on the streets with the word `` hero '' on their pictures ? 
  after all i wrote the best thing you are doing is `` gotovina was not bad as mladic '' , seriously ? 
  i 'm not here to say that this country did bad things and the other country did not , this would be a retarded fucking old circlejerk . 
  bot of these guys did bad things , as other commanders from bosnia , serbia and croatia . 
  no one in this war was an innocent flower who fought with honor for the freedom of his country, 
  i was born in sarajevo and actually i live in italy from 22 years ( because war , you know ) . 
  every summer when i go in vacation in montenegro , where my grandparents live , i pass through my native city and every year i see more and more mosques with even biggers minarets . 
  this is not the country that was used to be , i see people walking in the typical arab clothes with these huge beards , to be honest this change toward arab `` look '' scares me . 
  bosnia was always a country/region with a predominant muslim population but it was perfectly fit into the society before the war , alongside with orthodox , chatolic and jew ( yeah they were few ) population that lived in sarajevo . 
  you were able to distinguish a muslim only if he would tell you , they were even used to eat pork and drink alchol from how much laic they were . 
  the balcanic region was under the dominance of the ottoman empire for something like 800 years , even after this long time we had our culture , lifestyle , society that never looked like middle east countries . 
  and now 19 years after the war , 15 years from the usa bombings we are just replacing our secular culture with fanatism , with even more hate because in 2014 we still fucking believe in religions and what these ignorants assholes says . 
  like , seriously , if you blow up your self you will go in paradise with 72 virgins , you must stone alive women and other bullshit . 
  i 've lost my house , a lot of my parents during the war , i had to come in another country with not a single dinar , i had to rebuild my life from zero , i had to listen ignorant racist italians mocking me . 
  but this is not the worst , the worst is to see how bad a man looks at you if your surname is not catholic , if you speak with serbian accent in dubrovnink when you ask to a bar man where is the fucking toilet . 
  i hoped to see some change in the better way after the war , yeah , i saw it , but slow , fucking slow after almost 20 years . 
  and when you see a good thing then you see people like this muslim imam , people with the picture of ante gotovina or ratko mladic in their homes . 
  rekt, 
  stalin is rolling inside his coffin from how many keks his sides are making him turning . 
  ok but explain it to journalists . 
  is that ... barad-d\u00fbr ? 
  please do n't let it happen , if any of these guys will die on a mine the whole world media will accuse serbia or croatia for killing immigrants . 
  wait wait wait , nikoli\u0107 is saying something ... * correct * ? 
  thinking about for a moment , i guess all the dispute about macedonia name will end , macedonia will probably get a real democratic government and maybe the economy will increase . 
  shhhhhh do n't spoil our super secret project of greater serbia . 
  correct . 
  since russia is starting having some * real * business in syria i guess in a short time we will hear about russian minorities claiming more rights in saudi arabia . 
  tfw nobody will have problems if saudi nobility will get rekt . 
  `` thanks mr.communism ! '', 
  russia from 1917 . 
  also what the hell serbia after 1910 , why that huge boost upwards ? 
  talks the dude from where they shot helicopters full of ~ ~ weapons ~ ~ bread , 
  switzerland giving zero fucks from back in the days . 
  well , you have one of our spies in your team , 
  well , it was more or less sarcasm , since whenever a country has nuclear plants or a program , even more for new ones who wants it , usually they get spied , or in the worst cases sabotaged ( like israel with iraq ) . 
  because nobody will stick his nose in every new country that is developing a nuclear program . 
  there is probably a line of ~ ~ people ~ ~ spies , from every major country , outside your nuclear research bureau . 
  i guess he likes the minefields . 
  yes theres is a coalition , but not like what putin suggests . 
  the actual coalition is composed by nato countries who decided to participate with bombings and aimed air strikes . 
  they are not sending trainers and advisors for syrian military force , they are not sending specialized and veteran troops to fight with syrian military . 
  russia is starting doing all this , with also the deployment of fighters and bombers planes on syrian ground plus military navy on the coast . 
  this a complete different way to `` involve military '' . 
  the small specialized forces deployed on ground by nato are basically only in iraq to prevent baghdad fall . 
  and all the puppet governments in south america countries . 
  heresy !, 
  [ ** blam ** ] ( http://1d4chan.org/images/7/77/commissar_no.jpg ), 
  shots fired . 
  i disagree . 
   this had nothing to do with religion are you serious ? 
  chechen wars had nothing to do with religion ? 
  ffs . 
  hey dude , my post was about kids being held hostages by retards , i did not mention or justify russian actions in chechnya ( where also things were n't black and white ) . 
  edit : thanks for the downvotes . 
  as i remember in the end there was n't any possible solution to not kill anyone , the terrorists wanted to die by blowing up the school and every one inside , in fact these savages just wanted to commit the so called * martyrdom * . 
  russian had to plan an attack where the only solution was to blow up part of school walls and enter trough these holes , since every window/door was trapped with explosives . 
  soldiers decided to be meat shields while the hostages would been evacuated trough the holes on the walls . 
  fucking absurd that someone does things like this based on a religion belief . 
  rest in burek . 
  yeah , my mother also did shooting practice , with school , during jugoslavia days back in the 70 ' / 80 ' . 
  you just do n't want to see serbian and italian soccer banners . 
  serbia never disappointing on r/europe expectations . 
  quickly !, 
  restart bashing the evil russia !, 
  something something liek [ dis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqkzestq0wo ) ? 
  are you upset my swiss guard ? 
  do you think that such act means that some * heretic * has infiltrated the place you swore do defend from the tainted and the unclean ? 
  have you ever seen the amount of people with weapons inside a us airport ? 
  think if he did it in the usa , he would been probably shot when he tried to run away . 
  i never said ukraine was neutral , i said that it had to be neutral , but never happened thanks to the things you wrote and a lot more . 
  yeah , like how is relevant that lenin told everyone to do n't allow stalin to be in charge . 
  guess what , maybe they had to listen to him . 
  thats europe ( nato members of it ) and russia problem . 
  ukraine is one huge country that had to be a buffer zone between the 2 parts . 
  ukraine had to be neutral , to prosper and grow , but no , west and east did all they could do to control and manipulate it . 
  honestly ukraine governments did all they could wrong to destroy their own country , and you know better than me that there was n't a single government there not corrupted/funded by one or other side . 
  to me it looks like both russia and europe did n't really put some effort on talks .
