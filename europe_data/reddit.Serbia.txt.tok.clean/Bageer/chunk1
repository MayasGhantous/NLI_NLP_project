we can always blame [ ** mongols ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongol_invasion_of_rus%27?wprov=sfla1 ) !, 
  im not saying communist russia was in any shape or form better then imperial russia or today 's russia , but you have to look at it from survival point of view , where communist leadership head real concerns of invasion . 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  we should get over it ** but ** we should never forget what war can do !, 
  looks lik `` the guardian '' ca n't go full anti-ukraine and make panama leak article only , no they have to remind us about ** raging battle ** with russia . 
  why do you think that ?

  ali mora da priznas da ih je ovde https://youtu.be/fttwqwd_iey pokopao !, 
  do you think reason with effect this people , do n't know why you even try ? 
  and i can say it does !, 
  now what ? 
  when did i say crimean independence and unification with russia was good ? 
  it really does not matter what serbia things about crimea or ukraine about kosovo because we really do n't have any say it this kind of affairs . 
  what really matters is international position when it comes to kosovo question and crimean question and west ( lead by us ) does not think the same when it comes to this two problems , and that 's hypocritical !, 
  hypocrite !, 
  precedent you say ? 
  personally that whole category is stupid , there is only europe . 
  it 's not like greece is the birth place of modern civilization or anything like that . 
  federation or not it 's the same country with same people . 
  so you are saying russia ( or people in general ) should just forget everything before 90 's ? 
  if we compere history of a country to life of a man it would be like saying forget about this people trying to kill you a year ago and focus on future . 
  all people should learn from history . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean_war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allied_intervention_in_the_russian_civil_war https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_invasion_of_russia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_barbarossa second article is one of the main reasons why later in its existence ussr did mistrust the west , and it have every right to do so !, 
  ( before you start saying how ussr did this or that let me tell you that i dont defend or thing they are better that the west ) west have always tried to downplay russia to say the least . 
  good argument buddy . 
  that 's why us-russia trade raised under sanctions while eu-russia trade is falling ... 
  right ? 
  would you defend uk if usa tries to invade ? 
  do you wan na know how benefits more from migrant crisis than russia ? 
  u s a and eu is blind to see that , while they placed sanctions on russia there ( us and russia ) trade grow , while trade between eu and russia fell . 
  us benefits more from weak and dependent eu not capable for stending for it self , it was always like that with all , all the way from wwii , cold war and todays migrant crises . 
  it must be hard for you to live a life in denial . 
  russian death camps ... or was it ussr death camps ? 
  i know that , was just woundering if / u/strukkstar knows the same . 
  what about syrian army retaliating against turkey for sharing syrian today , artical 5, 
  or us could keep supplying kurds with weapons . 
  i s\u0435\u0435 that im trying to have conservation with someone that dont see how real world works , world is not always black and white !, 
  hollywood !, 
  sorry i meant propaganda that reaches the most people we all know that north korean propaganda can only influence the people that live in north korea . 
  everyone should wiki `` jamestown foundation '' and see how found them !, 
  what country in your opinion have most powerful propaganda capabilities and could you point out the strongest ? 
  if only you could use that smart head of yours to see that every single msm is used for propaganda . 
  bbc is kremlin outlet !, 
  russia bad , putin bad !, 
  this is not map of europe but europe union, 
  what kind of government does moldova have at the moment , pro-eu or anti-eu at the moment ? 
  i agree with your comment 100 percent that ussr should pay for what they did do , but how should it be done when ussr died in 1991 and russia of today have nothing in common with that country and its ideology . 
  i do n't expect you to really take serious comment i have made . 
  `` what the hell is there to be jealous about ? 
  their culture ? 
  arts ? 
  history ? 
  sure , but putin ? '', 
  / r/europe in a nutshell !, 
  corruption is ever present , people can work to make it less spread and only that , main difference between corruption in rich countries and poor countries comes down to how widespread it is !, 
  venezuela is to close to us for them to have full scale invasion as it was the case of iraq , they ( us ) are not that stupid to have that big of a conflict so close to there border . 
  just look at all nukes that us have in europe , they know and i hope you to know why is that , just dont say to protect europe because if it would come to nuclear war between russia and nato it was perfect no one set for giving us better chance of surviving . 
  `` russian communist '' yeah fucking right !?!, 
  last time i checked stalin was the supreme ruler of soviet union at the time and he was georgian . 
  stalin was like kim jong un on steroids , and his word was like gods gift to people of ussr , and there was no russian that could make stalin change his mind . 
  therefore title of this article is wrong or simply made to be propaganda by saying russian communist . 
  i think your forget this is 2016 . 
  never say never !, 
  you got it all wrong , i like us , i dont like globalism . 
  trump is best thing that happened to us in a long time . 
  fuck your nato !, 
  eu will die in the same way ussr did . 
  eu will die , same way ussr did . 
  here i thought us got putin . 
  muh russia , muh putin and trump !, 
  first let us in eu then we can talk about sanctions . 
  reeeeeeeeeeee, 
  you must be trolling us ... oh wait  / u/trolls _ brigade nvm, 
   nato is a military defense alliance of democratic states . 
  russia is a hostile imperialistic dictatorship . 
   ** nato is ** a * military defense alliance of democratic states * . 
  ** russia is ** a * hostile imperialistic dictatorship * . 
  damn dude , anti-russian propaganda did numbers on your brain . 
  and in how many hours could ** nato ** overrun serbia if it wanted to ? 
  that 's a good question !, 
   there is no truth ( c ) your beloved ** anti-russian ** propaganda . 
  wrong , when we join eu they can ask and demand we join in sanctions . 
  other wise we will just get used and never join eu . 
  #to many retards on both sides !, 
  no to `` sovietisation '' says eu leader . 
   ... and embrace putin ? 
  how is embracing ** ex kgb lieutenant ** in any way anti `` sovietisation '' ? 
  #good one !, 
   ** allegedly ** , yes russia is . 
  oh , i see what you did there . 
  say it with me : #fear mongering and propaganda !, 
   if putin orders any nuke strike anywhere for any reason there is no chance that he would survive . 
  true . 
   he would be hunted down and killed . 
  do n't think there would be anyone able to `` hunt him down '' because in the first hour after nuke lunch 70 % people on the planet would be dead , and after couple of months up to 90 % - 95 % people would be dead . 
  im sure when they say crimea is `` moving '' towards russia , they think about [ ** continental drift ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/continental_drift ) . 
  which is true .
