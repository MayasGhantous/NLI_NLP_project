  what about 4chan , they would get triggered af . 
  hello good sir , you dropped [ ** this ** ] ( https://i.sli.mg/diopmp.jpg ) . 
  fraud was so ** clear ** it can not be ** seen ** !, 
  short answer : ** you ca n't ** long answer : ** you can not **, 
  and you are not ** retard ** . 
  power do not beg god . 
   - `` bad '' it is sad that people still discuss if russia have the right to do this shit - . - i think you will understand this phrase , komsija : `` sila boga ne moli . '', 
  and that includes every power . 
  i would bet my life that ukraine government `` leaked '' this letter just so people talk about `` bad '' russia . 
  #good news , it shows russia is fighting corruption . 
   oh i finally get it , brexit means brexit and it does n't mean non brexit ( as opposed to meaning brexit ) . 
  #all i 'm saying is that , people of uk have ** voted ** and they said they want to ** leave ** !, 
   if you are against either of those , ** next time ** try having a referendum on the particulars of the exit deal . 
  that 's a point there wont be any ** next time ** , leave camp won fair and square . 
   `` to express their dissatisfaction with the outcome of the vote '' . 
  it 's a democracy , it 's fine to disagree with the majority . 
  once that lose have ** all ** the rights to be ** dissatisfied ** , but they should not think for a second that by ** expressing their dissatisfaction with the outcome of the vote ** , they can change the decision to leave eu . 
  #it would be against democracy !, 
  ## red scare is in full force !, 
   its not that easy because 90 % of media is owned by kremlin . 
  and what % of media in the west is owned by pro-west or western governments ? 
   and people do n't take opposing media seriously because kremlintv said that they 're all western spies . 
  [ and west every time they mention rt are saying it 's kremlin propaganda that people should not watch . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/lhnq_3kgiq0 ), 
   half of these threads are always filled with whataboutism . 
  yeah , quit whining about me hitting you in the face , someone else somewhere got kicked in the balls . 
  both west and russia have always used propaganda on their people to make them fear the other side . 
  to me `` whataboutisam '' is really stupid term , it will always ** `` work '' ** if any side in a conflict is the ** first ** one to accuse other side of doing something both side have done . 
  then when they try to say `` what about you doing the same thing '' is then feed to people as look this is clear case of whataboutisam . 
   * edit * : also , destroying its economy means less money for warfare and better outcome for the rest of the world in this case . 
  after ww1 ** germany ** showed us what happened when others intentionally try to destroy their economy . 
  you should know better before talking from your ** ass ** . 
   i hear the earthquake in italy is also the putin 's fault . 
  correct the record was here . 
  [ you should try harder .

  [ nice try , dru\u017ee . 
  nah , us is way better then us , happy with second place . 
   happy i 'm not american that makes two of us then . 
   trump 2016 , i suppose ? 
  nah , gary johnson 2016 #and you are ? 
   i was mostly joking , but i would n't ever risk underestimating putin 's likelihood to use military forces damn propaganda really gotcha . 
  even pentagon can not be trusted if what they are saying is not in some way ** negative ** towards russia !, 
  feelsbadman, 
   wikileaks is russian propaganda got any ** evidence ** to back that up ? 
  or just few whatabout ** this ** and ** that ** . 
  do n't forget texas . 
  good thing kosovo was taken away from serbia in ** 1999 ** after all it was ** xx ** century , am i right ? 
   russia wants to give a helping hand and everyone acts like they are trying to nuke it instead of help with the fire . 
  i remember on dude telling people how canada was right to decline russian help , ** because they may send secret spy planes disguised as planes for fighting fire . 
  and they would scan for good location for nuke droping in a case war broke out . 
  ** #talk about mental people , am i right ? 
  that 's one big [ ** if ** ] ( https://youtu.be/9sju-tqhwio ) you got there buddy . 
   would you like to provide some evidence ? 
  hey let 's step in a shoes of vladimir putin for a moment . 
  everyone know that in a last couple of years west ( us , eu , nato ) have had somewhat ruff relationship with a erdogan , we can all agree on that . 
  us biggest problem with erdogan has been his unwillingness to accept [ us aid for pkk kurdish group fighting in syria . 
  ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/10/middleeast/turkey-erdogan-criticizes-us/ ) [ eu problem with erdogan for the most part has to do with ** refugee crisis ** ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-06-07/turkey-resorts-blackmail-warns-europe-it-will-unleash-refugees-if-no-visa-free-trave ) , turkey have almost openly blackmailed eu by saying they will open the gates and let even more migrants come to eu . 
  now if we look at the history ** cia ** had always done regime change in the countries they deemed to be not to us benefit . 
  and so you do n't think i 'm one sided same have been done by ** kgb ** . 
  when we look at this attempt of a coup in turkey and ask ourself who had more to ** win or lose ** if this coup was successful , and what could have been positives and negatives sides of successful coup . 
  ** russian positive aspects ** would have been more friendly turkey government , and that 's all . 
  ** negative aspects for russia ** would have been that us would most likely react in not good way for russia fist with accusations and evidence which they most likely would have had . 
  eventually harsher sanctions would have been applied on russia by us and eu and they would have every right to do so . 
  positive sides for us and eu if coup was successful would be much better then russian positives . 
  us would get more secular government , more accepting of us alliance with kurdish pkk . 
  eu would get much better deal for migrant crises do n't forget there are over 2.7 million refugees in turkey that eu would like them to stay there . 
  #now comes putin positives in the case of coup failing would have been much better for putin , why you ask ? 
  if rumors are true and putin warned erdogan about upcoming coup . 
  erdogan would forever be grateful to putin . 
  relationship between russia and turkey would improve . 
  relationship with turkey-us would take a blow , that 's for sure , and same goes for nato . 
  eu would still have problem with turkey over migrant crises , which benefits for russia in long term for sure , more refugees more terrorist attack on eu , more terrorist attack on eu more people will like to leave eu , and that 's ** really good for russia ** . 
  etc news ? 
   last thing nato wants is to throw turkey out into russia 's hands . 
  and that 's why nato with us on top tried to make coup not long ago . 
  turkey is just to important for nato and us , but on the other hand erdogan can be replaced . 
  us media is using fear against it 's own people with purpose of making ** russia ** in their eyes look like ** hell on earth ** and putin great ** satan ** him self . 
   btw , the us navy has been using militarized dolphins since 1960 that 's the point , when ordinary person look at ** titles ** of this kind of articles : cnn : [ ** dolphins , the russian military needs you !,

  i do n't believe majority of people in the us share your opinion at least when it comes to cnn .
