  st. petersburg is not moscow, 
  i 'll bet you on my life ukraina will ** never ** join nato , it would be just to big of a blow for russia . 
  potential missiles only 500 km away from moscow will never be allowed to happen . 
  i 'm not saying this as some pro-west or pro-east shill , it 's just the way of todays geopolitics and it was so from the start of the cold war .

  #or maybe putin will take back alaska ? 
  but people will vote for ** president ** not leaving eu . 
  how long before you leave eu ? 
  you should read more about us - russia relationship at the time of war for [ independence ] ( http://history.info/people/1780-russian-and-ottoman-empires-helped-the-americans-in-the-war-of-independence/ ) and ** civil war ** article [ 1 ] ( http://rbth.com/arts/2013/09/12/when_the_russian_navy_sailed_into_new_york_29761.html ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.voltairenet.org/article169488.html ) . 
  you can also read about there relations on [ ** wiki ** ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_empire%e2%80%93united_states_relations ) page . 
  cold war is over and ussr is more . 
  looks like you do n't approve of uk having good relations with russia . 
  i get it why you think that way , no one wants to lose control of there ally us more then anyone else . 
  not according to the un . 
  that 's geopolitics bud , russia is but a player . 
  not every one that voted to leave eu are right wing , people can see what is going on around them . 
  `` the kremlin is directly connected to most far-right parties in europe . 
  leaked text messages of kremlin officials showed that marine le pen received money from a russian-affliated bank after she deiced to send one of her party 's members to oversee the crimean referendum . '', 
  merkels migrant policy helped far-right parties 1000 % them rise in popularity and putins money ever could , i think you are aware of that ? 
  `` no , putin probably knew that if he would call for brexit before the referendum , he could scare away people from voting for leave . '', 
  that one shows you putin is better at tactics obama and his strategy was better . 
  by the way i agree ** edit : ** 75 % with your previous comment . 
  would your comment be any different if for example i was from uk or any other nation ? 
  i was simply stating the facts , obama obama did have an opinion and openly called for remain vote , while putin did not try to influence will of the people . 
  unlike obama putin never told people of uk how to vote , his remarks on brexit are all post-vote . 
  what ?? 
  [ vox video about brexit ] ( http://youtu.be/czwhvbmrnpq ) # 01:07 time of video, 
  well he 's a simple man , he sees brexit and he bets on it . 
  do n't know what character donald trump supposed to be in house of cards , but underwood 's are as clintonian as you get . 
  when in doubt , blame ** evil ** putin !, 
  i never said russia had stronger military then us , i just stated the fact that any country that can kill every single person on earth should be consider the superpower . 
  killing every single person in the world makes you superpower by default . 
  if only russia had death sentence ** like some countries ** , reddit would go ape shit crazy talking how russia is new nazi germany . 
  ahh but they are only dreams , i hope one day russia legalize gay killings ** like some counries ** so we on reddit and the west can ** hate ** them even more !, 
  ah sweet dreams !, 
  key word here is ** war ** !,

  i understand you 100 % , but i want you to understand me that same as rich and powerful people have demand influence so does rich and powerful countries demend influence , and ever since fall of ussr u.s. has done every thing to under mind russian influence were ever they can . 
  big powers play geopolitics that 's the rules of geopolitics . 
  also a country that keeps threatening its neighbors for just not wanting to be under its influence .
