  that , yes . 
  i had a brainfart . 
  the pronunciation is almost exactly the same , too !, 
  ( our \u00e1 is bit more closed/rounded is all ), 
  meh , it 's pretty consistently hollandia here in central-eastern europe . 
  what ? 
  where ? 
  that sounds interesting to say at least . 
  what / u/savolainen5 said . 
  also , we * do * have fancy names for the old german states/provinces : - swabia is sv\u00e1bf\u00f6ld - bavaria is bajororsz\u00e1g - saxony is sz\u00e1szorsz\u00e1g +1 steiermark/styria is st\u00e1jerorsz\u00e1g . 
  orsz\u00e1g literally means country , so yes , 
  pah , capital of orsz\u00e1gorsz\u00e1g * must * be glorious budapest , though . 
  also , i think we could safely bring \u00c9szak-\u00cdrorsz\u00e1g ( northern ireland ) to the fold . 
  n\u00e9met is german , n\u00e9ma is lazy . 
  so yes , you 're right !, 
  also , g\u00f6r\u00f6g can also mean `` to roll '' , though it 's a really archaic and irregular one . 
  and no , it 's just a random thing that they have the same form . 
  though if you really want to drive it home , use `` geci d\u00e1n '' ( geci is pronounced getsi and is a rude word for sperm ) . 
  well , it 's not really our fault that your history as separate entities is quite ... recent . 
  it only ever appears in dialects outside budapest and the media , so if you live here , you probably wo n't ever hear it . 
  the second e ( denoted as \u00eb ) sounds quite close to the german \u00e4 ( just shorter ) , and is quite consistently used in many regional dialects . 
  a good example is kellem\u00ebs , meaning comfortable . 
  not to mention we usually just use `` usa '' ( pronounced `` usho '' ) or amerika to refer to the us in everyday speech . 
  that some masochistic teachers in elementary school make pupils memorise in its entirety . 
  like really , it 's long, 
  also n\u00e9metalf\u00f6ld covers a geographically larger area than today 's netherlands ( northwestern germany , flanders , etc. 
  you 'll need more once the slavics start submitting their maps too ... shh bby is ok . 
  point taken . 
  i 'll still only use it as an insult , though , if i ever get the chance . 
  they need to learn 2-3 foreign languages already just to have the country 's own official languages under their belt . 
  imagine if you still had some semblance of the kalmar union left . 
  after learning norwegian , danish , swedish and estonian , would you still have time/brain cells left for english ? 
  bildungsopfer ... for all my years of learning german , i have never heard this word . 
  thank you , liebe ( r ) redditor ( in ) , for introducing it to me !, 
  i let out a hearty chuckle . 
  i wonder when kdnp starts campaigning against english in schools and for the reintroduction of latin instead . 
  would fit the mould perfectly . 
  dunno much about that , though we did have many great inventors ... and almost all of them were jewish , who are again a bit different ethnically . 
  `` there is no justice ! '', 
  - he crieth out loud . 
  also , do not forget the bus driver smoking and not even bothering to open his little window !, 
  that 's really weird , as we are of a much more mixed stock now as the finnish are ... 
  i mean , slavs , germans , turks , some leftover mongols and italians , gypsies , who knows what else ... all contributed to the glorious magyar essence . 
  and * this * is what we inherited from our even more glorious true ancestors ? 
  apart from the language , that is . 
  bless your poor heart . 
  you 're gon na do it anyway . 
  hungary has waaaaay too much sunshine and we 're still ( ? ), 
  among the top3 . 
  what gives ? 
  oh , you 'd find sooo many people who actually think that is the case here ... 
  wow !, 
  that 's cool . 
  til, 
  i 'll give you a detailed comment once i 'm back later this evening . 
  i typed up a comment but then lost it to the home button ... darn !, 
  a small preface to / u/maorycy 's comment : no , definitely not !, 
  you know it goes without saying that i quickly googled some * \u00e9retts\u00e9gi * notes ... 
  i know , it 's just my stupid pedantic eu teaching that makes my eyes twitch whenever i see a glorious yuropean write in such an uncouth , uncivilised ( ! ), 
  manner . 
  also , razbiti / \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0438 is `` to break '' . 
  see my other comment a bit further below , you ca n't really call us being out of reach of civili ** s ** ation !, 
  serbians have ratimir , `` war and peace '' ... 
  huh , if only we actually had such an orderly table or whatever ( as a native speaker you learn the aspects for sentence analysis , but not the tables ) ... 
  i 'm pretty sure i 'll leave a lot of them out , but here 's the singulars : h\u00e1bor\u00fa h\u00e1bor\u00fat h\u00e1bor\u00fa\u00e9 h\u00e1bor\u00fam ( - d , - ja , - nk , - tok , - juk ) h\u00e1bor\u00fai h\u00e1bor\u00fanak a h\u00e1bor\u00faban h\u00e1bor\u00faba h\u00e1bor\u00fab\u00f3l h\u00e1bor\u00fan h\u00e1bor\u00fara h\u00e1bor\u00far\u00f3l h\u00e1bor\u00fan\u00e1l h\u00e1bor\u00fahoz h\u00e1bor\u00fat\u00f3l h\u00e1bor\u00faval h\u00e1bor\u00fakor these are just the inflection suffixes ( the 3 ^ rd type of suffixes ) , that do not modify the meaning of the word . 
  there are a myriad of index and formative suffixes that already do . 
  plus , they are more or less freely combinable !, 
  stromae for french ( from belgium ) 2 . 
  enya for gaelic 3 . 
  dubioza kolektiv , \u017deljko joksimovi\u0107 , \u0110or\u0111e bala\u0161evi\u0107 , hari mata hari , boban markovi\u0107 orkestar , and goran bregovi\u0107 funeral and wedding band for serbian used to listen to all kidns of german music back in the day , when i still lived at home and had mtv2pop and viva . 
  probably they love some of her * particular * bits . 
  argentina needs to have the pope included somehow . 
  dat 80 % p\u00e1linka doe , the stuff of wonders and horrors . 
  we could get basically the entire body of work from the gy\u0171l\u00f6lt ellens\u00e9geink blog , take it unironically/literally , and put it there ... 
  so pretty much lonsdale ( i tend to see them in equal quantities ), 
  i 'm on mobile now , so i ca n't provide a link unfortunately , but do look up szomor\u00fa vas\u00e1rnap in the interpretation of p\u00f3ka ang\u00e9la . 
  of the somewhat recent covers , i think hers is the best , she really lives into it ( the video you 'll find is probably the crappy quality megaszt\u00e1r one , audio should still be one ), 
  can confirm , the flemish are usually very nice , the few walloons i met were indifferent ( few exceptions swinging either way did occur ) , while brussels is usually a hit-and-miss . 
  i recently had a friend post a 15-match ticket where he got all right except for the very last one . 
  i guess he was too pissed . 
  ` nuff said . 
  l\u00e6ffy would approve . 
  it 's called \u201e s\u00fclt v\u00e9r '' ( fried blood ) commonly , yes , it has no special name . 
  but i think \u201e pacal '' is also quite high up on the list . 
  it 's basically a stew made out of tripe/offal . 
  i want my goddamn space station in szeged . 
  would make me move back there in a heartbeat . 
  deffo not green for luxembourg ... 
  almost nothing is open on sundays , especially not larger shops . 
  that one song initiated my eternal love for within temptation , and through them , for dutch . 
  both choices that made my life significantly better ^ ^ though i rewatched x a couple years ago and was surprised that somehow i remembered much more of it than i saw . 
  aw yiss, 
  yup , the numbers for hungarian are also really far away from reality, 
  i dearly love the anime dubs germans did for rtl 2 back in the day . 
  many were even better than the english-language ones ( i much prefer digimon in german to any other version , for instance ) . 
  yeah , the house next to mine still has them . 
  one of the neighbours complained to me that because of the protected status it 's really hard to get stuff done like changing windows ... poor lady , she probably is cold during winter . 
  i do n't know ... 
  he looks like a merger between sean connery and pierce brosnan , but somehow not in a good way . 
  like in a paradoxical , bond-villain way .
