  you can get whatever you want if you book the venue . 
   that there is not a quote . 
  seemed faithfully quoted to me . 
  his question seemed fair enough . 
  what 's your problem ? 
  stalin 's even popular among some in bulgaria . 
  this is nothing extraordinary . 
  strange that you hear bosnian differently considering it 's the same language as serbian and croatian . 
  do n't translators have to work back and forth between every eu member language ? 
  i doubt many maltese can translate to bulgarian readily . 
  [ get with the program ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqtphhaktl8 ) . 
   berlin said the german public was worried about a recent spate of home burglaries by georgian criminal groups in germany , diplomatic sources said . 
  why does n't the german public here on r/europe tell us if this is really true . 
  is this really what people are worried about in the zeitgeist ? 
  it 's a disgrace , georgia has completely fulfilled every requirements of the eu 's visa liberalization plan . 
  if the eu keeps making empty promises no one will have faith in its institutions and will stop trying to join european society . 
  that 's a problem for pro eu folks . 
  so what can be done ? 
  be good patriots and shit out babies ? 
  it 's basically a hopeless problem . 
  there 's no way to keep the educated folks who 'd rather get paid $ 40,000 in brussels here in serbia , and every city but belgrade is slowly dying . 
  it 's a shame , there are ghost town villages all over the countryside that i doubt will ever be repopulated . 
  could n't have happened to a greater city either . 
  what retards would make it part of their agenda to tarnish the image of istanbul and ruin the fucking economy like that ? 
  the tourist dollars from russia already dried up , do they want to go even poorer ? 
  then what do you blame ? 
  laziness or some shit ? 
  not to be an asshole but they 're basically the same , you know ? 
  although there are no digraphs in \u0107irilica , granted . 
  there is no good reason for you to be downvoted . 
  i ca n't stand this tito revisionism . 
  how the hell can someone say this with a straight face ? 
  :  even if you do n't like him personally we can not ignore thattito made modern croatia 's borders . 
  if it was n't for his efforts a lot of croatia 's beautiful coast may not have even been part of croatia today . 
  you have those borders because tito forced civilians out of their homes !, 
  jesus christ , and this is a good thing to you ? 
  what about the [ danube swabians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danube_swabians#world_war_ii.2c_expulsion.2c_and_current_situation ) ? 
   of a pre-war population of about 350,000 ethnic germans in the vojvodina , the 1958 census revealed 32,000 left . 
  officially , yugoslavia denied the forcible starvation and killing of their schwowisch populations , but reconstruction of the death camps reveals that of the 170,000 danube swabians interned from 1944 to 1948 , about 50,000 died of mistreatment . 
  fuck that bastard . 
  basically like that . 
  cyrillic is used in official documents , both are used in practice . 
  and since croatian and bosnian media mostly use latinica and people watch croatian tv and listen to bosnian music and all that shit , everyone 's good . 
  i personally think cyrillic is interesting but i fear it may die out one day as in everyday use ( facebook , reddit , etc ) most people prefer latinica . 
  for now serbia is a fascinating case of digraphia though . 
  besides the fucked up tactics ( masked men demolishing buildings in the night ) , my problem with this is that the buildings do n't fit the belgrade aesthetic . 
  we could use some new good-looking buildings fitting the ornate central-european look belgrade already has to offer , but not these curvy glass apartments . 
  if emirates wanted high-rises why do n't they stay in dubai ? 
  and why mix up and confuse the existing style of the city ? 
  i really do n't want to deal with an ugly pile of shiny buildings here . 
  i mean , imagine putting this shit in the beautiful old city of jerusalem . 
  it would just look out of place . 
  belgrade is a city of concrete and stone , and the better-looking buildings should look permanent and sturdy . 
  i 'm not feeling this one . 
  this kind of reminds me of the ugly shit mess of high-rises parts of thessaloniki have become . 
  i 'd like to avoid that fate . 
  when in season i 've seen them for around 80-90 dinars . 
  something like .70 eur . 
  not bad . 
  your flair interests me . 
  so you must be from zakarpattia oblast in ukraine , right ? 
  that 's a shame , i thought that area was filled with old hungarian architecture and stuff . 
  suburbs in vojvodina look a lot like those in hungary . 
  and in fact , cities like subotica and sombor outside the center are basically all suburbs . 
  my friends call subotica europe 's largest village . 
  here 's shit from my hometown : [ pretty typical vojvodina houses separated by gates ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@45.9306341,20.0769267,3a,75y,325.19h,73.18t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1scn-9wprpidjf9vvsdyy7kq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) [ a somewhat nicer area ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@45.9307849,20.082754,3a,75y,115.33h,76.28t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sumiboeac8o0cnfafa0amvg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) [ some rich guy ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@45.9301156,20.0831298,3a,75y,19.51h,77.67t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1shhh-t6ykacry84rwnoqb3g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) [ my personal favorite ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@45.9296066,20.0749567,3a,75y,259.19h,75.15t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sp8uzdi-8hryonpvrygza2a!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ), 
   we our us this confused me for a good 10 minutes . 
   they have a particular inability to grow a moustache for example as they have n't been shaving long enough . 
  [ shaving does n't make hair grow back thicker ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1o8mhd/til_that_the_fact_that_shaving_doesnt_make_hair/ ), 
  there 's probably an inverse ratio with a country 's population and their fluency in english . 
  i have no real evidence to back that up , but maybe slovaks have more slovaks to hang out with while the lonely slovenians come here . 
  geographically by most definitions around a third to a half of slovenia is situated in the balkans though . 
  why do you escape from balkan when vojvodina ( geographically outside ) is stuck with it ? 
  on a side note , how is russia 's birthrate doing ? 
  i hear conflicted information that it 's improving yet that 's apparently due to some statistical anomaly . 
  i 'm not yugonostalgic but when it comes to cross-balkan communication i do n't see what 's wrong with saying srpskohrvatski , or jokingly yugoslavski . 
  when we dealt with the language in our linguistics classes , we called it srpskohrvatski . 
  not everyone has time to constantly deal with the registers separately . 
  i tell people i speak serbian . 
  but it 's not like i have to pretend i do n't speak the same language as bosnians , croatians , and montenegrins , unless i like to brag to foreigners that i speak 4 languages . 
  i somehow read this as michigan . 
  still quite far east . 
  top kek m8, 
  just give it all to australia and end the confusion once and for all . 
  are you generally against dual citizenry , or just with these countries in particular ? 
   croats vs serbs conflict started in the 19th century could you perhaps send me some wiki links or something to read up a bit more on that ? 
  i always thought that was the height of pan-slavist unity between you guys . 
  linguists sometimes deal with the south-slavic languages as a sprachbund from slovenian to bulgarian . 
  there are `` serbian '' dialects ( torla\u010dki govor or torlakian dialect ) that sort of `` meld '' into macedonian/bulgarian with less cases than standard serbian and more articles , for example . 
  kajkavian is similar in that way between slovenian and croatian , acting as a sort of bridge between the two -- you can see it in the kajkavian nepostojano ` e ' instead of the ` a ' for example . 
  so in that way there is some kind of continuity throughout all the languages . 
  for the purposes of serbo-croatian , instead of pretending that `` serbian '' and `` croatian '' are different languages , i think it 's simpler to say that all shtokavian speakers when speaking \u0160tokavski are speaking the same language , while some croats speak \u010cakavski or kajkavski -- whether you want to call those separate language is up to you . 
  but standard croatian and serbian are so clearly the same shit , different registers . 
   no one says `` x picture of subotica in vojvodina '' i mean , i probably would say so on a sub like this . 
  it 's not even that i have any nationalist attitudes about vojvodina , but the place has its own identity and style . 
  if i can assume the person i 'm taking to knows what vojvodina is , i 'm more inclined to say that than serbia . 
  perhaps it 's because i 'm from a particular minority in vojvodina that would make me ** serbian ** but not actually ** serb ** that i typically mark that difference . 
  i suppose from that angle if i said i was scottish and not british would i also be being a prick ? 
  what if i were a scot talking about the beautiful sights in england ? 
  regardless on your position on the issue , whether bosnia * should * be one country or that republika srpska leaves , or what have you , if this guy have some affinity for his region is refers to another region within his country , it 's not the biggest scandal in the world .
