  perhaps if it was taught differently and there was more of a demand for it it could have some use in europe , but it 's really a waste of time for most people . 
  i 'm not so sure i agree . 
  the international business done by chinese companies is already done in english , and as you touched upon , the mandarin language does n't seem to be `` exporting '' itself the way english , french , spanish , portuguese , and russian have . 
  you 'll find some people learning it , and you 'll find a demand for it in some central asian countries , sure , but somehow the rest of the world is learning other languages . 
  also , do n't underestimate french . 
  with the trend in africa 's booming population , french proficiency could skyrocket to make it more widely spoken than spanish .

  and what about all the german and english classicists butchering ancient greek pronunciation ? 
  listen to the [ numbers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9tg34yomvw ) in the mansi language . 
  i 'd been to grozny , chechnya in the midst of the rebuilding efforts and it was surprisingly clean ... too clean , in fact . 
  at least the city center was eerily sterile . 
  besides that , i guess norway and switzerland . 
  i 'm a fan of my native filth regardless . 
  just go to istanbul and you 'll see them .

  i 'm sure you could find some ethnic restaurant somewhere that 'll give you what you 're looking for . 
  last time i was in boston though , i had to go all the way to some armenian restaurant in watertown just to get a burek . 
  i know some people do n't follow the news , but damn . 
  the bretons are still holding out . 
  okay , so what the hell does the mosul dam have to do with libya ? 
  regardless of whether they were going to sell them or were just saving them , thank fuck those statues made it out . 
  mesopotamian archeology had been my hobby before these two most recent civil wars broke out and it 's been nothing but bad news since . 
   loud , obnoxious i hate loud and obnoxious governments .

  i 'd love to have a beer with maajid nawaz . 
  i 've always wanted to buy a couples acres and grow a little forest on it myself , doing my own little part you know , but shit like this makes me think it 's not even worth the effort . 
  i did n't say that at all . 
  assyrians got their iron from the hittites and the arabs got their iron from the assyrians . 
  i mean , historically it is wrong . 
  arabs have been using iron tools since the assyrians got their hands on them , far predating the birth of muhammad . 
  i do n't know why people are giving you shit , the sarcasm was pretty thick there . 
  ... what ? 
  just one moment . 
  read these if you will . 
  ** bosnian : **  \u010clan 1 . 
  ** english : **  article 1 . 
  all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights . 
  they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood . 
  really , the differences should n't amount to anything more than the occasional * razumem-razumjem * division and maybe words like * vlak * instead of * voz * . 
  it 's strange though , because even if that 's true ( my serbian 's not perfect ) , you would have figured out pretty early on the bosnian , croatian and particularly montenegrin are basically the same shit . 
  i mean , if you take an interest in the music and culture of ex-yugoslavia , you 're probably listening and reading more than just serbs . 
  i do n't know how you would n't have noticed these large populations where your `` native language '' is being spoken before we told you here on reddit . 
   my native language is serbian so it 's pretty difficult to understand this bosnian article i do n't know why people go on this subreddit and pretend to be from other countries . 
  you speak serbian , you speak bosnian . 
  serbian is to bosnian what british english is to american . 
  you either do n't speak serbian or you speak both , holy shit . 
  it 's such a weird thing to lie about too . 
  was n't it supposed to be a joke ? 
   it 's interesting . 
  the morroccons who are in europe are largely riffian . 
  who are notoriously violent and good fighters . 
  many of the paris attackers were riffian . 
  honestly , i like r/europe a lot but what the fuck is this ? 
  this is an ethnic group of 5-6 million people . 
   who are notoriously violent and good fighters . 
  this is n't lord of the rings where the different races have mastered different fighting styles and shit . 
  there 's no such thing as `` warrior races . '', 
  i mean , this is absolutely nonsense . 
   i would say the scum is being sent our way . 
  i 'm really not the overtly pc type , but pull yourself the fuck together . 
  and all the upvotes you 're getting ? 
  what the hell is this ? 
  persecuted intellectuals , political prisoners , and sahrawis for example . 
  agreed . 
  i 've spent some time in tuzla but i 'm not sure i had the same impression . 
  in my experience , the police wanted me to bribe them just to tell me where that animal hospital is ( the one just outside the city by the power plant ) . 
  but that said , it 's not like i 'm painting the place up as the wild west . 
  honestly , this stuff happens . 
  i do n't know if you think i 'm lying or something , but he came home with a pistol one day and that 's where he got it . 
  may i ask if you live in a city or a town ? 
  the cities are one thing , but do n't forget what goes on in the world of balkan small towns . 
  here there are no laws . 
  my girlfriend 's 13-year-old brother literally bought a handgun at his school . 
  finland 's too high , serbia 's too low ...

  very few people have actually applied for asylum in serbia . 
  the only other person i 've ever seen wear one of these is the town drunk in sombor . 
  but orthodox symbolism is more of a nationalist thing than a religious one . 
  this guy 's a serb nationalist , you might have guessed . 
  you really think people should be forced to get a license to fulfill one of the most basic human instincts ? 
  i mean , could you ever see anything like that being tolerated ? 
  if someone is rejected for the license , what are you gon na do if they reproduce ? 
  jail them ? 
  take their kids away ? 
  i do n't get it at all . 
  in serbia yes , and surprisingly wnba too . 
  if bilingualism takes off in african nations in which its an official language , it ought to be one of the world 's foremost languages in terms of native speakers . 
  it 's got a future . 
  i imagined this video being something else -- `` why are there so many names for germany ? 
  such as austria , poland , etc. ... '',
