  holy shit , how can a number that high be true ? 
  is so , that 's staggering . 
  if they 're selling cheap , you could just buy one and live there on the beach . 
  normally i 'm not such a purist , but god dammit i 'm learning french and i will not tolerate this new confusion !, 
  i heard long ago , while a student of arabic myself , that during the islamic golden age of baghdad more works were translated into arabic than are today . 
  i never quite believed it and never bothered to look up its truth , but stories like this have always floated around . 
  i actually would n't be opposed to schools offering arabic if the demand was there . 
  i 've been learning the language myself and can foresee its importance increasing moderately over time . 
  that said , for most it would serve as a hobby at best . 
  it 's not really a useful language to the average german -- hell , turkish would be more damn useful , and most turks are well integrated !, 
  arabic is not a language of scholarship nor even * really * a lingua franca in the arab world . 
  you can speak msa with the educated ( typically a minority ) of arab countries , and perhaps talk to the common man ( very basically ) speaking egyptian arabic . 
  with the rest you 're shit out of luck . 
  you studied msa , egyptian , iraqi , and levantine arabic for 10 years ? 
  oh , how nice !, 
  good luck understanding moroccans , algerians , tunisians , saudis , sudanese , etc. . 
  honestly , with any language besides english like french , russian , spanish , mandarin , or portuguese being offered instead students will be better equipped ( and likely more inclined ) to make good use of their new language . 
  i 've been kicking myself since then because i traded for euros all my leftover dollars from a stay in the u.s. ( a couple thousand ) when the euro was at its strongest , just to watch their value decrease nearly 50 % compared to the dollar . 
  do you think some georgian government tourism agency is targeting this subreddit with georgeous ( i misspelled gorgeous but i 'll leave it as is ) pictures of their country ? 
  every time i see these posts i become more inclined to see the place for myself . 
  great picture . 
  they all want the eu passport until the realize [ what country it 's from ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw8dnstf3te ), 
  well , that does n't sound like the right reason to have kids , frankly . 
  i 'm all for a net positive birthrate , but do n't shit kids out just to be a good patriot . 
  do you mean 34 ? 
  i planted a couple trees in my yard last year , no need to thank me . 
  are you playing around with us here ? 
  100 % safe and worth it . 
  sarajevo is my favorite city of all time and it 's all safe as hell . 
  i 've spent a lot of time there and i 've never seen anything that 'd make me look twice . 
  edit : `` safe as hell '' is probably not my best choice of words , but oh well . 
  one of my favorite cities . 
  all these pictures of georgia are quickly making it my favorite country . 
  i ca n't wait to visit . 
  `` cro-warrior '', 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  i do n't want people peeing on the side-walk , sure , but you ca n't even pee on the side of a highway in that country . 
  i was once in the states in a small town in upstate new york . 
  i was walking back to where i was staying from the next town over ( a long walk ) so i stopped to pee in some bushes or on a tree somewhere . 
  this is on the side of the road , but it 's night time and it 's not like i 'm peeing on someone 's yard . 
  anyway , a car was driving by at the time and he sees me , stops his fucking car , and turns right the fuck around to pull up to me and yell at me for exposing myself . 
  i was n't even facing the street . 
  i guess the culture just does n't accept shit like that . 
  anyway , i was a teenager and this was before i spoke decent english so i just panicked and ran away with piss all over my jeans . 
  then it 's true elsewhere . 
  in states without romeo and juliet laws , an 18-year-old might get shafted for fucking his 15-year-old girlfriend . 
  statutory rape can land you on the registry . 
  finally , this is long overdue . 
  nearly every sahrawi lives in a refugee camp too . 
  seriously ? 
  how convenient that you no longer have to argue your point with this fellow just because he used one of your special forbidden words . 
  i think he meant 2015 . 
  there are more conservative numbers below 1.8 million , but it 's still a fuck-ton . 
   the embargo does n't necessarily prevent us citizens/residents from traveling to cuba , more the inability participate in a financial transaction in the country . 
  hence why it 's a de facto travel ban , unless you have money stored outside the usa , which is then a grey area . 
  i 'm not really sure what you 're qualifying about my statement here ; you evidently think what i said was fine . 
   although to be fair the embargo has n't been enforced in terms of tourism related visits for about a ** decade ** now and it 's gradually being lifted . 
  eh , it 's a little more recent that the travel ban 's been de facto lifted , but even so my entire point was that all of this complication is avoided by entering on another passport . 
  i 'm not quite sure what your comment was meant to clarify . 
   dual cotizenship is allowed but in the eyes of the russian government , you are only russians . 
  most countries operate like this . 
  four i have experience with : the u.s.a. , brazil , hungary , serbia . 
  a dual american citizen enters america on his american passport . 
  but he can circumvent an embargo and enter cuba on a russian passport , for example . 
   how exactly would a country function if 1/3 of its citizens ca n't even speak the state language this is all i was responding to . 
  vojvodina seems to manage just fine . 
  it 's not just pockets of hungarians ; there are slovaks , romanians , albanians , `` banat '' bulgarians , rusyns , romani , etc. 
  serbs make up about only 2/3 of the population of vojvodina . 
  and it 's perfectly alright to be a monolingual romanian speaker in the region should you want to ( though you 'd be rather lonely ) . 
  if you ask me , it 'd be outrageous for the serbian government to revoke the citizenship of people born in the country speaking the language of their local population . 
  i 'm talking about vojvodina . 
  hungarians are about 15 % here . 
  i 'll grant you that it 's not quite as numerous as the russians , but nonetheless most of the hungarians speak shit serbian , if they speak it at all . 
  and you know , life goes on . 
  if i were talking about serbia as a whole in my example , you realize that serbia would be analogous to estonia and the hungarians to russians , right ? 
   how exactly would a country function if 1/3 of its citizens ca n't even speak the state language quite manageable for much of europe -- my home , for example . 
  yeah , basically every moldovan i know is a dual russian citizen ( but that 's probably not the case with most moldovans ) . 
  and while i see some contradictions in the russian nationality law upon googling it , nowhere does it say that one must renounce their russian citizenship on acquiring a new one . 
  i 'm not sure why people just talk out of their ass while the information they 're referencing is right in front of us all on google . 
  could you quote that bit for me ? 
  ca n't seem to find it . 
  ( by the way , some old idiot asking an army to come invade is basically meaningless . ), 
  nonetheless , it was your claim that he was either an agent or being sponsored/supported by russia in some way . 
  this makes him out to be a lone actor , does it not ? 
   unless they break the laws . 
  what sort of laws ? 
  the only thing that bothers me about this , really , is that this `` separatism '' is occasionally considered a crime in ukraine . 
  i think it 's a problem for some when their identity is n't listed on the census . 
  for others it 's a problem that they 're forced to study in ukrainian despite living in rusyn majority areas , without their language being given any formal lessons . 
  anecdotally i recall hearing about a certain ivan petrovsky being expelled from the ukrainian writer 's union for translating the works of shakespeare into rusyn ( and for his role in the rusyn national movement too , from what i gather ) . 
  it appears that when organizations come about to do something about this , they 're treated as anti-ukrainian , separatist , and occasionally outlawed . 
  it just seems a little odd to me . 
  anyway , i do n't care that much about it . 
  i 'll grant that ukraine 's got bigger things to worry about . 
  again , i do n't speak ukrainian . 
  but what i gather from google translate is that he 's some weird east-slavic nationalist who 's lamenting that russia 's ** not ** helping him with his rusyn nationalist circle-jerk . 
  i 'm afraid i do n't speak ukrainian ( or rusyn for that matter ) . 
  so you 're saying [ these guys ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhjgn4e0lgq ) are fsb agents ? 
   do n't make insulting statements without having any proofs , please . 
  i did n't insult anyone .
