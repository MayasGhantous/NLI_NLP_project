  and also , just because you can understand danish and swedish does n't really matter in this instance . 
  most turks can probably understand some azerbaijani and turkmen . 
  you 're taught some old norse , they 're taught some ottoman turkish . 
  so a kurmanji kurd who grows up in proximity to some zazaki speakers might grow up to be bilingual . 
  perhaps then he goes to school and learns turkish ( a language inundated with as many regional variations and accompanied by as many sister languages as your own ) , but effectively , turkish is not a language he 's necessarily fluent in . 
  you can easily live in your own little world in southern turkey . 
  i mean , your example is just kind of weird to me . 
  your ethnic minorities are terribly small . 
  your immigrants outnumber them , but as far as the natives go , your population is pretty homogenous . 
  at most you have 60,000 sami ( a very generous estimate ) of various sorts . 
  you do n't have millions of kurds , arabs , caucasian peoples , and massive immigrant populations ( to the scale of turkey ) congregating in your country . 
  edit : although perhaps i 'll say that this handicap of theirs does n't fully account for their low scoring here -- they likely get a shittier education than most the rest of europe . 
  poor macedonia . 
  they understand us but we 'll never understand them . 
  i never said it would n't one day be . 
  uplifting is a good thing , is n't it ? 
  well , and serbia . 
  albania was the world 's first officially atheist state . 
  they 're perhaps more secular than most current eu members . 
  and i would hope i could rely on the fair-mindedness of those who 'd browse this subreddit not to accuse me of saying anything i did n't even * remotely * imply . 
  apparently i was wrong . 
  albania is not just a poorer , smaller hungary , as was claimed above . 
  this is what i was refuting . 
  the differences are more substantial than that , ** for example , cultural differences such as majority catholic vs majority muslim . 
  ** not so hard , right ? 
  i do n't mean to be bitchy at you , but i 'm very annoyed that what i write ca n't simply be taken for what it is . 
  my point was that the other ex-yugo countries are n't so different than croatia . 
  my defense therefore would only apply to serbia and macedonia . 
  the `` sorry albania '' was n't even a sincere apology . 
  i just did n't bother defending your country because i 'm not an albanian . 
  i do n't think your culture is backwards and i know that you 're probably more secular than bosnia . 
  go defend albania to him yourself . 
  it 's not my job . 
  yeah , fuck you too . 
  do you honestly think serbia and macedonia ( sorry albania ) are culturally backward ? 
  then why is croatia in the union ? 
  i mean , the differences are n't that great . 
  no offense to albanians , but hungary is not really as a obscure country as theirs . 
  its landmass was basically half of central europe . 
  it dominated the region along with austria . 
  when you read old texts in local languages in vojvodina , for example , they 're often bilingual in hungarian ( or latin , incidentally ) . 
  it had a profound impact on european history and still has a sizable population of speakers of its language ( and a huge diaspora ) . 
  now while there is a massive albanian diaspora , in reality you might find that only half of them can speak albanian . 
  there are about 5,000,000 albanian speakers compared to hungary 's 13,000,000 . 
  other differences include religion . 
  this is just too much of a simplification . 
  has anyone given any thought to armenia , azerbaijan , and georgia ? 
  they may not be ideal nor strictly european , but at least armenia and georgia are somewhat european in disposition . 
  they 're ex-communist countries as well which makes them somewhat relatable to eastern europe , i suppose . 
  and azerbaijan , while probably the least compatible of the three , would put the eu on the caspian sea -- for whatever that 's worth . 
  and actually , come to think of it , kazakhstan has some european territory as well . 
  but they 'd probably join russia before joining the eu . 
  and i still think [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/future_enlargement_of_the_european_union#cape_verde ) is hilarious . 
  uh , no . 
  are there still pro-russian moldovans ? 
  i remember vladimir voronin saying something about joining the belarus-russia union state at some point . 
  yeah , you 're expected to refuse offers of kindness here at least once or twice before accepting . . that 's how you weed out the genuine offers from the platitudinous ones . 
  alright , you can join the balkan club . 
  it 's done here too . 
  i 'm not sure he 's saying anything of value . 
  i second this . 
  it 's spread to the nordic countries as well . 
  perhaps germany too , to some extent . 
  please tell me it 's satire . 
  my former latin teacher was very upset that the my school 's board of overseers changed the name of the heads of dorms from `` housemaster '' , worried as they were that calling someone `` housemaster '' ( and therefore `` master '' ) would evoke `` flashbacks '' of slavery in the black student population . 
  he , knowing its true etymology , had a few choice words for the board of ** overseers ' ** selective hearing on the matter . 
  americans used to do this , and they did it explicitly to mock black people . 
  i figured that because people assume that american politics are the world 's politics , people suddenly are making a fuss about black pete , regardless whether the motivations were the same . 
  so when 's [ cape verde ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/future_enlargement_of_the_european_union#cape_verde ) joining the eu ? 
  i 'm not familiar with this tradition . 
  are they mocking black people , or just dressing up to accurately portray a character who 's black ? 
  does n't blackface only have negative connotations in america because of minstrel shows which set out to mock the blacks ? 
  he has an absolutely lovely style . 
  he was also a tad crazy , but his work is entirely his own .

  i absolutely believe you . 
  well , no . 
  the kurds , as much as i dislike their extreme quasi-religious ( in its worship of `` apo '' ) ethnic cult , are the only properly secular force . 
  assad played up the `` secular '' game only recently . 
  keep in mind that he 's fighting so hard only to maintain his alawite foothold on the country . 
  it was n't too long ago when he was treating the christians and druze and * especially * the jews in his country like shit . 
  i want so say for the record , however , fuck the pkk-aligned kurdish rebels . 
  every time i see them praised as forward-thinking and modern and the ones `` we should support '' on this website , i get sick to my stomach . 
  you got a problem with americans as individuals ? 
  what 'd he even say ? 
  did you just reeeeeee in lithuanian ? 
  gora is mountain -- like [ fru\u0161ka gora ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fru%c5%a1ka_gora ) . 
  right , i was curious about this . 
  perhaps he 's talking about partitioning north kosovo and annexing republika srpska or something . 
  is that a real rule , or are you being british and sarcastic ? 
  `` sure , i recant '' * fingers crossed behind back *, 
  do you have more information on the divide within saudi arabia ? 
  i thought they were basically homogenous besides the small shi'a population . 
  sometimes people mention banat . 
  are you saying cousin-marriage is an abomination ? 
  where 's your fine ?
