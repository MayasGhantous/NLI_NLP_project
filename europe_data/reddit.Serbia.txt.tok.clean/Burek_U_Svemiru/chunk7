  yes , it means literally `` i do n't know . '', 
  this made me laugh . 
  i guess i 'm a pleb with a low-class sense of humor . 
  apparently we have the most guns per capita ( after america ) * in the world . 
  do you mean no more ? 
  what a bunch of fucking idiots . 
  do n't forget that political dissidents are really half the reason we have these asylum laws . 
  precisely . 
  immediately after i 'd written it , i actually considered deleting this comment because it 's a pointless , anecdotal thing to say . 
  but i wanted to let someone else spank me first . 
  yeah , it 's pretty annoying . 
  to be fair , most people i know do n't even want to join the eu . 
  fair enough point . 
  actually , despite that they 're both uralic language , finnish is a whole other monster . 
  i 'm not saying that agglutinative languages are objectively harder to learn , but somehow it feels much easier picking up french than even trying to learn finnish . 
  probably just as hard as swedish or norwegian . 
  for a serb , i suppose it 's a lot like learning english , although with more orthographic regularity ( i assume ) and fewer identifiable common loanwords . 
  no , no , it 's easy . 
  ayyyy,

  why do n't you have more upvotes ? 
  this i love . 
  yeah , what the fuck is that . 
  i 'm afraid this fight is already over . 
  morocco has imported enough moroccans to the region to upset its ethnic homogeny and turn it in their favor . 
  sahrawis are the minority in all of western sahara but the parts under sadr control . 
  europe 's gesture may be a nice sentiment , but the sahrawi case is dead . 
  it 's cool . 
  you and i can annex liberland into serbia to settle our differences . 
  it 's pretty annoying to be a suspected separatist just for being hungarian . 
  those types are living in the past . 
  i live in an essentially homogenous hungarian enclave is all . 
  the flair is more of a linguistic indicator than a nationalistic one . 
  also , my username 's in serbian . 
  i balance things well enough . 
  i honestly appreciate the general skepticism people have to the horse shit we tend to peddle . 
  that said , you 're behaving like an idiot -- read the article . 
  username checks out ? 
  there are posters of stalin in the sofia train station . 
  what do you think of that ? 
  apparently it can be treated as both a countable and uncountable noun . 
  you may say `` many ingushes '' or `` many ingush . '', 
  same thing . 
  forgive me , i 'm redditing at 3:00 in the morning . 
  my point is that the ethnic make up of senta is almost entirely hungarian -- a people who 'd take no interest in any kind of `` greater serbia . '', 
  ah , so it does . 
  good old vojvojdojnoj . 
  oh , that 's how it works .

  ... again ? 
  the `` biji serok apo '' cultists . 
  i like your flair . 
  why would you even make light of things like that ? 
  civilians were killed in that . 
  my ** hungarian ** village of senta was bombed . 
  :\\ it was all senseless . 
  excellent , but you forgot [ muzsik\u00e1s ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m839wzea9wk ) !, 
  their music certainly is n't authentic in that you 'd be hearing something identical 100 or so years ago , but it 's not bad . 
  they 're basically hippies that drew from the folk source material . 
  it 's good shit . 
  ah , i was waiting for the turkish music to come . 
  i thought this thread would be dominated by it , there 's so much good shit . 
  oh macedonia , the balkan 's musical [ capital ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_zlfhssitw ) . 
  how i could i forget ? 
  excellent , man . 
  this is really good . 
  would you know if this is an authentic field recording , or a sort of neo-folk revivalist thing ? 
  the production quality makes me think the latter . 
  damn , this is excellent . 
  this is played on a balalaika , right ? 
  very interesting . 
  out of curiosity , how historically accurate would you say are the attempts of percival ? 
  why would it be ? 
  i think we do n't want to insult the intelligence of kids living in the 21st century . 
  indeed , but this library was something special . 
  it held the majority of the [ arebica corpus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arebica ) . 
  this was a great loss for all speakers of the language ; bosnians , serbs , croats , montenegrins , what have you . 
  at least the castle still stands today . 
  the destruction of the library at sarajevo is what upsets me the most .

  the difference between spain and portugal is my favorite . 
  i do n't want to seem stupid here , but he 's writing from right-to-left to draw the tail of that ` y ' . 
  all i can say is it 's never been a problem for me . 
  i kind of get what you 're saying , but it 's just not an issue . 
  i 'm not sure i understand . 
  like , the paper would move if your hand was n't holding it down ? 
  the technique with which i was taught to write arabic letters seems to yield no problems . 
  you might be overthinking this , although i think writing with my left hand the arabic script , even if i were left-handed , would make less sense somehow . 
  perhaps the shape of the letters has something to do with it . 
  i do n't know why you said it 's not objective . 
  then what 's the point ? 
  i said it was n't objective either . 
  why would it be a hassle either way ? 
  i do n't understand what you 're getting at . 
  there 's no justification to say that writing left-to-write is the natural way just because it 's the way of your language . 
  the script from which yours descended , phoenician , used to write right-to-left . 
  early greek wrote that way too . 
  eventually greek decided to write left-to-right one line , right-to-left the next , then left-to-write again , and so on .
