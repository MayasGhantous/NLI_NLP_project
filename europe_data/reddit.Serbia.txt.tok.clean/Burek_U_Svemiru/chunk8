  other scripts write top-to-bottom , and theoretically they could write bottom to top for all i know . 
  if hannibal had conquered rome and you were long-descended from the punics , i think you would consider those who wrote left-to-right to be strange and inefficient . 
  i personally do n't speak turkish very well , but as far as i know it 's acceptable ( and it used to be common ) that you render a turkish word of arabic origin in the plural just as it would appear in arabic . 
  hafiz becomes huffaz , for example ( but i 'm unsure of the spelling ) . 
  it 's just a footnote i remember reading in a turkish language book i bought a couple years back . 
  i might have remembered wrong , but i 'll wait for a turk to correct me . 
  edit : i suppose i stand corrected , but perhaps this existed in old ottoman turkish . 
  i vaguely remember this being a thing . 
  especially if you know how to pluralize the arabic-loanwords . 
  very fancy . 
  absolutely . 
  this guy 's one of my favorite redditors on this sub . 
  just play along , he 's hilarious . 
  i 've never seen one bosnian woman in a burqa , but niqab-clad women are n't a surprise to me in the streets of sarajevo anymore . 
  i tend to think that a large percentage of them are tourists from muslim countries , but we have to accept that this reflects a change in bosnion society as well . 
  it 's sad but true . 
  that said , this should n't be overblown . 
  the vast majority of bosnian muslims would have a beer with me any day , even in the middle of ramadan . 
  edit : though to be fair , i 've never seen a niqab in tuzla before . 
  hell , i doubt i 've even more than a few hijabs in tuzla . 
  it 's really just sarajevo and perhaps a few odd [ villages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gornja_mao%c4%8da ) where you might find these occasional weirdos dressed like that . 
  [ for those unaware ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io79dhitc_c ) . 
  3 months . 
  this is what i 've been telling people . 
  i know , belgium is like the most statey state i could imagine . 
  i 'm asking you this in sincerity , so i 'd be very annoyed to be downvoted . 
  but i 'm sure you know the counterargument most people would levy against you : who 's to say which are the acceptable extremists ? 
  please continue this . 
  it 's fascinating . 
  this has nothing to do with islamophobia , but it 's more to do with ideological cowardice . 
  do you not have the mental capacities to treat your enemies as human ? 
  it takes absolutely no fortitude to consider them as rats to be exterminated . 
  you ought to face the world you live in as it is instead of simplifying it so stupidly . 
  u/thebeercannon is right . 
  know your enemy . 
  this is a common stock phrase among muslims , as common as * bismillah * and * alhamdulillah . 
  * it 's not swearing as in `` fuck you , allah you cunt . '', 
  it 's more like swearing an oath ; swearing on one 's honor . 
  i 'm afraid this is something i see being abused in the future . 
  people in this thread are rather gung-ho about france enacting stricter measures to capture / prosecute terrorists , but i just think of what happened to america after 9/11 . 
  usapatriot you know , for those who do n't like effort . 
  not really . 
  hayat did n't commit a crime , do n't you understand that ? 
  in american law there are special spousal privileges that even if you know your partner is going to commit a crime , you 're under no legal obligation to report it . 
  in fact , in certain contexts the police ca n't even take a spouse 's testimony as evidence if it was told to her in confidence . 
  this is american law and i do n't know how french law works . 
  but the law is the law and it is not bent for those whom you do not like . 
  her husband committed a crime . 
  let him be prosecuted . 
  if she committed a crime , let her be prosecuted . 
  this is supposed to be simple . 
  no , i tell you there are ** far more ** than 2,000 french citizens in syria . 
  not everyone there is fighting , you lunatic . 
  perhaps abu ahmed has a sick grandmother in damascus . 
  he 's free to visit her . 
  perhaps pierre studies levantine arabic and for some fucking reason went to syria to practice . 
  he 's free to fucking do that . 
  perhaps some genevieve is a ** really ** extreme tourist and decides to vacation in syria . 
  she 's a moron , but by all means , she can do what she wants . 
  and you , by all means , investigate all these people . 
  find out where they were , what they did , who they know , what religion they follow , and where their political tendencies lie . 
  but none of these people belong in prison . 
  the 2,000 who can be shown to have fought belong in prison . 
  prosecute them for all i care . 
  are you grateful to live in the west ? 
  it seems as though you want to throw away a core thing that makes france worth a damn in the eyes of many people . 
  you ought to be more proud of your nation 's role in the age of enlightenment and in the championing of human rights . 
  sure , investigate all you like . 
  it very well might be suspicious when 20-year old abu ahmed one day disappears from his madrasa and shows up in syria . 
  even investigate pierre the businessman for all i care . 
  but do n't make it a crime outright . 
  as for the embargo , an embargo on syria would do far more harm than good -- again , there 's a reason half of these measures you 've brought up * have n't been implemented . 
  * pierre the businessman is going to syria to bring imported wheat from tunisia . 
  this is not a crime and this is not `` aiding '' assad . 
  if pierre the businessman had come to syria to illicitly sell assad some hand-grenades , this is * already * a crime . 
  free-trade with the country is already hindered in many facets , but the international community issuing a total-embargo would decimate the millions of civilians living there . 
  if it were * only * by france , however , it probably would n't have much of an effect . 
  in other words , there 's no point . 
  how convenient that this would n't disadvantage you in the slightest . 
  i think your emotions get the better of you in times like these . 
  yes , what a lovely society . 
  you have a temporary curfew in paris for the time being which , if it has not been already , should be lifted in a few days once everything settles . 
  this is understandable , perhaps . 
  but france has as of yet not instituted travel-bans to syria or iraq because , as i said earlier , that would be ** ridiculous ** of them . 
  ( also , if you 're caught violating curfew you may be locked up , but i think it 's unlikely they 'd prosecute you of anything . 
  at the absolute * worst * , i can imagine a fine . 
  perhaps i 'm wrong and france has become more draconian than i 'd hope . ), 
  uh , sorry , but what the fuck are you talking about and how does it relate to anything i just said ? 
  civilians should n't go to somalia either then , right ? 
  god forbid any civilians go to eastern congo either . 
  i mean , these are active war-zones . 
  i do n't think you understand the reality you live in . 
  this is not world war i and civilians are not vacationing in the trenches when they travel to these `` war-zones . '', 
  countless civilians live in these regions . 
  damascus is a city of roughly 1.7 million . 
  if a french man travels to damascus to ship goods to that city and returns to france , has he committed a crime ? 
  how many of your freedoms are you willing to sacrifice ? 
  there 's a reason you 're not in charge of your country , seeing as you clearly lack the ability to make rational choices once your emotions are inflamed . 
  syria is still a country with a sizable population -- a sizable french-speaking population no less . 
  people have business there .
