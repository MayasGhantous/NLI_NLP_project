  is it a crime to go to damascus ? 
  is it a crime to go to tartus ? 
  there 's a fucking russian naval base at tartus ; there 's hardly any war there . 
  the day syria is empty of non-combatants is the day you might be able to make the case that access should be forbidden -- and even then , it ca n't be an outright crime . 
  cause for suspicion ? 
  sure , go right the fuck ahead . 
  one-way ticket to prison ? 
  give me a fucking break . 
  unless you have proof that they 're fighting in said war-zone , visiting a country currently at war should not be a crime . 
  this is ludicrous . 
  it 's not easy to monitor people who are not communicating on the internet you and i use , running plain-old google chrome . 
  there are ways to encrypt your messages , anonymize your ip , hide your personal identity , etc. 
  most governments have no access to vast swaths of what exists on the internet . 
  edit : i 'd like to add that this is a principal argument against mass-surveillance . 
  the real heavy-duty bad-guys know this shit already and are n't making their battle plans on fucking reddit using internet explorer . 
  i understand france is not the united states , but they do have to respect the rights of their citizenry to some degree . 
  you ca n't expect they 'd be permitted raid the home of everyone they suspect of wrongdoing if the evidence is n't really strong enough , save for extenuating circumstances like these . 
  the public outcry would likely outweigh that than if they missed a few terrorists , i would assume . 
  i 'm afraid that 's just how western civilization works . 
  france is not saddam-era iraq where you can treat people as disposable . 
  that said , if there 's proper reason to suspect them of any crime ( that is , credible evidence ) , then by all means get the french equivalent of a search warrant and fuck them up . 
  reminds me of my old apartment . 
  why does this guy get down-voted every time i see him ? 
  yes , but the kurds ( at least the ypg ) are bad in a non-platitudinous way . 
  140 + they say now . 
  if these attackers turn out to be islamic terrorists , does anyone know what sort of recourse the average citizen could turn to ? 
  what can we do to combat this brand of islamism ? 
  before someone says join the kurds in syria , i know someone who considered joining up with them before learning that they 're bad too in their own way . 
  i suppose since the vatican works with latin -- historically one of the most important european languages -- you could argue that all the various diacritics of its modern use should be included in this list . 
  \u0100 , \u0112 , \u012a , \u014c , \u016a , \u0232 and \u0102 , \u0114 , \u012c , \u014e , \u016c , y\u0306 and \u00c1 , \u00c9 , \u00cd , \u00d3 , \u00da , \u00dd ( and occasionally various combinations of the three ) are used in modern latin educational materials to indicate vowel length and stress , but you 'll find works of literature written in this way as well . 
  my * commentarii de bello gallico * by julius caesar contains macrons and stress accents , while my * aeneid * is just marked for stress . 
  latin enthusiasts who use the language on forums like [ this ] ( http://www.textkit.com/greek-latin-forum/viewforum.php?f=12 ) occasionally write with macrons for the sake of clarity -- its modern use in the catholic church might even occasionally make use of them . 
  macrons also have had an influence on [ classical medicine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macron#medicine ) from its long history with neo-latin . 
  the letters c\u0304 , p\u0304 , q\u0304 , s\u0304 , and x\u0304 , each being an abbreviation for a certain latin phrase , were used in the past . 
  i 'm not sure if they are still used by modern doctors . 
  i 've neglected to mention ligatures , if they even count . 
  in medieval latin many diphthongs were rendered as a single letter such as \u00c6 for ae and \u0152 for oe . 
  the last set are characters and not diacritics , but they 're easily the most interesting of them all . 
  they were never popularly used , but can be found on a few inscriptions here and there . 
  these were the [ claudian letters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/claudian_letters ) , or letters invented by crazy-roman-emperor claudius for no clear reason . 
  \u2132 , \u2183\u03f9 , \u2c75 each represented distinct sounds , and \u2132 would actually have been a fairly useful letter in distinguishing between u and v at the time , but their use was abandoned after his death . 
  latin is more of a fossilized language than a dead one , and since its modern use is more widespread than you might have thought ( unless you 're in the right circles ) then it ought to qualify for a slight mention . 
  it 's also surprising to see the amount of auxiliary characters that could exist in a language whose alphabet we deem the standard for our own languages , despite that most of these diacritics are modern innovations . 
  so in total , latin works with \u0100 , \u0112 , \u012a , \u014c , \u016a , \u0232 , \u0102 , \u0114 , \u012c , \u014e , \u016c , y\u0306 , \u00c1 , \u00c9 , \u00cd , \u00d3 , \u00da , \u00dd , \u0100\u0301 , \u1e16 , \u012a\u0301 , \u1e52 , \u016a\u0301 , \u0232\u0301 , \u1eae , \u0114\u0301 , \u012c\u0301 , \u014e\u0301 , \u016c\u0301 , y\u0306\u0301 , c\u0304 , p\u0304 , q\u0304 , s\u0304 , x\u0304 , \u00c6 , \u0152 , \u2132 , \u2183\u03f9 , and \u2c75 . 
  not too shabby . 
  edit : reddit 's formatting ca n't even handle half of the latin diacritics , so you 'll have to use your imagination .

  it 's not impossible considering the word for path or road is * p\u00f3nteh \u2081 s * in proto-indo-european . 
  that said , according to every etymological dictionary i 've looked through , welsh borrowed * pont * from latin 's * p\u014dns , pontis . 
  you 're probably right . 
  i do n't know much about the actual process by which the words made their way from latin to , say , welsh , but i just know that the second principal part ( the genitive declension ) of third declension nouns feature a ` t ' after an 'n' in words ending in ` ns . ', 
  rec\u0113ns to recentis , and so on . 
  it 's interesting that late vulgar latin would render everything in the ablative instead of the more intuitive nominative case , though . 
  the ` t ' comes from the genitive declension . 
  in latin , bridge is `` p\u014dns , pontis . '',

  * but * russians literally cite what they call the `` kosovo precedent '' when they pull this kind of shit . 
  [ `` the republic of crimea proclaimed its independence from ukraine on 11 march 2014 , specifically citing the kosovo precedent in the beginning of the declaration itself . 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_independence_precedent#ukraine_and_republic_of_crimea ) here 's the full quote :  we , the members of the parliament of the autonomous republic of crimea and the sevastopol city council , with regard to the charter of the united nations and a whole range of other international documents and taking into consideration the confirmation of the status of kosovo by the united nations international court of justice on july , 22 , 2010 , which says that unilateral declaration of independence by a part of the country does n't violate any international norms , make this decision , '' says the text of the declaration , which was published by the crimean media . 
  it seems like you 're setting up a strawman here with this u.s. invasion comparison when the nato intervention in kosovo would be most applicable . 
  not if your country is a signatory of the european convention on human rights , a group in which poland would count itself , no you ca n't .
