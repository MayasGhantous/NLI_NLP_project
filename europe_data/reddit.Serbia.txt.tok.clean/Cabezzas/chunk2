  too bad is that it stopped when it reached the highest level , and when kostunica took over , everything was back where it was and now we are where we are . 
   which was followed by the biggest purge in the security services ** connected with criminal groups that killed our prime minister ** , which pretty much ~ ~ decimated the entire intelligence community ~ ~ cleaned country from crime . 
  ~ ~ what a clusterfuck . ~ ~ bad thing is that djindjic needed to die , for us to feel safe again in our own streets . 
  waiting for a call from erdo . 
  thanks . 
  fair enough . 
  but i would argue that yugo was soviet satellite . 
  we had our own thing here that cant be compared with soviet union and warsaw pact countries . 
  and serbia is like any other european country , poorer but hardly a miserable place . 
  i am sure if you had a chance to visit it , you would change your opinion . 
   ( no offence ) no problem . 
  but would like to see why you think my country is miserable . 
  and why it being miserable is related to yugoslavia ? 
  so in 27 years he did n't changed his papers ? 
  whatever man , its stupid to identify someone by country that is long dead . 
  imagine tomorrow something happened , and police identify suspect as a czechoslovakian . 
  albanians lived in yugoslavia too . 
  i get what you are saying , but i doubt he identifies as a yugo in 2017 . 
  also , are there any soviets living in germany ? 
  albanian ? 
  when it is a muslim from balkans , they just say he is a yugoslav now . 
  sanctions did n't brought milosevic down , but him stealing the elections two times . 
  sanctions only hurt the people and made them even more anti-west . 
  his mother was bulgarian princess , plus his wife was also bulgarian princess and he called himself the emperor of serbs , greeks and bulgarians . 
  yeah , and skopje was also a capital of old serbian empire under king stefan du\u0161an , known as `` the mighty '' . 
  true , borders changed a lot . 
  i see a lot of today 's bulgarian cities under byzantium though . 
  i see there is no point arguing here . 
  i 'll just call you a pao fan that is jealous of our paok-partizan , red star-olympiakos friendships . 
  he is having a problem of two nations being friendly to each other connected with history of fighting the ottomans , balkan wars , and ww1 . 
  i mean what kind of a man you have to be to not respect it at least . 
  read the comment above slowly , because i see you are having trouble understanding it !, 
  give me a break , do n't teach me about morals please . 
  stop hiding behind srebrenica , and acknowledge other civilian victims too . 
  serbs perished in this war as much as others . 
  accept your peoples war crimes too , and then come to teach me about morals . 
  and no , i am not going to engage in discussion on `` who killed more '' . 
  fuck that !, 
  i do n't think it will ever secede , but denying its existence will only help it . 
  just look at this thread, 
  serbia & uk . 
  2027 believe !, 
  the guy shot into the crowd of people . 
  what do you mean ? 
  why would it be odd ?

  what he can do , invade us ? 
  plus , russia does not have a problem with us joining eu , since we had a pro-eu governments since year 2000 . 
  and he does not need to worry of us joining nato either . 
  n1 je cnn affiliate , tj . 
  partner  the deal gives n1 exclusive access to video and newsgathering resources from cnn international including live breaking news , news stories and programming , for transmission in serbia , croatia and bosnia and herzegovina . 
   n1 will also have the option of translating selected cnn programming and news into localised languages for the first time in the region . 
   n1 will give cnn access to its own reporting from the adria region , which will be gathered by teams based in its belgrade headquarters and in regional hubs including sarajevo and zagreb . 
   serbs will have free access to their shrines and historical sites in kosovo does n't seem likely . 
  displaced serbs cant even visit their graveyards and not get stoned by albanians . 
  we had a veto from netherlands and germany before , as i remember . 
  all countries agreed on serbia 's accession . 
  countries can block some chapters like croatia did for a while , but those problems are easily solved . 
  ohh you are one of those n1 = cnn = cia i guess . 
  explains a lot . . 
  because conference in brussels was finished couple hours ago . 
  those articles were edited later . 
  i think they cant make their own requirements for eu accession , and why would they ?

  the other one of the same class is the warship sms bodrog [ yugoslav monitor sava ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_monitor_sava ) . 
  it is the ship from which the very first shots of the great war were fired . 
  the ship was sunk and restored three times and now it 's been purchased by the serbian army and will be restored again . 
  so the sms leitha will not be the only remaining austro-hungarian warship .

  montenegro was an ally of russia in the russo-japanese war . 
  in 1904 montenegro declared war on japan in support of russia , however did not dispatch any significant forces . 
  volunteers from montenegro were sent to fight in the russian army in manchuria . 
  [ 4 ] in the peace treaty following the war , montenegro was excluded from the treaty and a state of war continued to exist between the two countries . 
  in 2006 , japan recognized montenegrin independence and declared that the war was over . 
  [ 5 ] thus ended the war that lasted 101 years , a war extended for diplomatic irregularity .

  yep , same thing . 
  that match was played in krusevac . 
  hooligans of the local team are also known by being racist to black players of the opposing team , so they painted the whole nation as racist . 
   the problem is people like yourself and your fa who deny there 's a problem so it will never change . 
  the racism is not a thing here , i can assure you . 
  these incidents happens rarely considering how passionate in sports we are , and some idiots would do everything to get under players skin .
