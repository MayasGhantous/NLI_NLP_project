  well , they tried . 
  300k people needed to die because of that and 6 million internally displaced within syria , and over 4.8 millions refugees outside of syria with no home to return to . 
  great job !, 
  all they ended up with is turkish stream !, 
   all religions have their extreme interpretations . 
  oh please . . enough with this bullshit . 
  you definitely should question every source , especially news like this . 
  my point was that before kumanovo inicident in 2015 serbian security warned macedonian government , they were right back then and we see the same pattern happening now . 
  i hope it is not true . 
  i still do n't know what to think about situation in fyrom , i can only hope things will calm down . 
  apparently source is someone from military intelligence . 
  latest news are that around 800 uck veterans have been crossing the border with fyrom , and that our security agency have informed macedonian government . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kumanovo_clashes#aftermath lets not forget that similar thing happened in 2015 . 
   consider how long companies like jamnica , ledo , ** konzum ** , tisak , belje etc etc have been around . 
  consumers trust them , only a moron would let that kind of good pr die . 
  true . 
  although most of their religious leaders get their education in places like cairo , algeria and istanbul and their degrees in theology on subjects such as sharia law . 
  qatar opens mosques in bosnia , croatia , serbia and kosovo too . 
  [ this is a plan to build a largest mosque in europe . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraf.rs/english/1727650-heres-how-the-biggest-mosque-in-europe-near-sjenica-will-look-like-photo ) you can only guess who is funding this . 
   la monumental that building is more beautiful than any religious building would ever be . 
  the church was looted and set on fire by albanians after the arrival of the us kfor forces in town , at the end of june 1999 . 
  it was attacked in the 2004 unrest , and albanian nationalist graffiti were painted on the walls in 2013 . 
  `` multicultural ''  in 2015 work on the exterior began . 
  in september 2016 more than 200 serb former inhabitants of the town ( pre-war 12,000 serbs , now only three ) , participated in liturgy in the church . 
  shh . . italy does n't know yet . . 
  visible serbian church in the background . 
  you mean small part of the opposition ? 
  i think that my flair suggest that i know how country of my parents looked like , i do n't need wiki for that . 
  also wiki does not say how communists took lands from my grandfather and gave it to his poorer neighbour , because , you know , everyone had to be equal in this communist utopia . 
  that 's something all yugoslav republics have to deal with today , through process of restitution and compensation . 
  i do n't know much about economics back then , but i know most of it was due to yugoslavia geopolitical position . 
  my father worked in a company that basically imported products from france , re branded it and exported it to warsaw pact countries for double the price . 
  so lot of things would n't work today .

  he just saw how it worked with djukanovic in montenegro . 
  it is the best way to to stay in power for next 25 years and become rich in the process . 
  ~ ~ federation ~ ~ ~ ~ union ~ ~ ~ ~ independence ~ ~ union federation all i can say is good luck friends !, 
  ok , maybe . 
  but it still is a shitty and misleading article . 
   2 braincells leave this shithole of a region asap if only they were leaving for the eu . 
  :( problem with the albanians is that they tend to emigrate to neighbouring countries , later cry oppression and seek independence . 
  they did n't banned all winemakers from montenegro , just plantaze wines . 
  so this is blown out of proportion and r/europe is buying this propaganda . . 
  these are not sanctions . 
  they banned this particular winemaker because of sanitary failings . 
  it is just an obvious click bait , and everyone seems to be jerking about it and not reading it . 
  i know , just kidding . 
  was referring to milanovic calling us `` saka jada '' . 
   also are n't you guys in deep shit as well ? 
  of course we are . 
   haferi as parliament speaker ( former member of the macedonian u\u00c7k u\u00c7k https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6ynewagkgn4/hqdefault.jpg i guess same thing as in kosovo , ex-terrorists in suits taking over the government . 
  do we all think about the same guy ? 
  serbia got nothing to do with this . 
  which countries is russia arming ? 
  while i hate military organisations , i do n't have problem with lithuania . 
  love your basketball players and history . 
  agree , fuck nato !, 
  i thought you only were in bosnia . 
  i hope you liked it here . 
  so you went to srebrenica ( b&h ) and learned about serbia ? 
  any chance that you discussed possible b&h integration to the eu , you know the country you actually were in . 
  where are the gods ? 
  do n't tell me they do n't exist . 
   i found this link to a twitter discussion showing a blown-up t-90 , presumably by isis , and i reckon this is not the only such video . 
  do n't take this guy seriously . 
  and what would be the reason for that ? 
  germans were surrendering to the british and american forces because they knew that after all the atrocities they did in in the east , soviets will not have mercy on them . 
  plus there were a fierce resistance by germans at the gates of berlin , something that other allies did n't encounter in the western part of the country . 
  no they did n't , it was a race . 
  soviets reached first . 
  because capturing moscow would mean end of the war in the east ? 
  yeah . 
  i just wanted to point the hypocrisy here . 
   organized army hardly . 
  true russia is arming them , but lets not pretend that nato does n't do the same when it suits their interests . 
  russians did the favor for chinese here . 
  next time you will see china vetoing instead of russia on some resolution in syria . 
  that is how it works . 
  yeah , we do that all the time with basketball too . 
  you mean ** singidunum ** ? 
  you people have no shame !, 
   a gun camera video was released by nato to support its version of the events . 
  future controversy occurred when it was discovered that released video was speed up 4.7 times , to justify the claims . 
   the german frankfurter rundschau prompted a further controversy during january 2000 , when it reported that the nato video had been shown at three times its real speed , giving a misleading impression of the train 's speed . 
  [ 7 ] the pentagon and nato stated that the error had been the result of the video being speeded up for battle damage assessment purposes , but not being slowed again for the press conference . 
  [ 8 ] [ 9 ] later investigation by frankfurter rundschau asserted that the video was sped up 4.7 times . 
  [ 4 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grdelica_train_bombing#controversy, 
  you are now mixing countries , wars and the timeline . 
  here is a canadian general talking about nato campaign and kosovo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy1jzwpj9ec also : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es267luacaa, 
  except that these civilian victims were nowhere near kosovo or the conflict . 
  oh do n't turn this conversation around . 
  you 're being hypocritical about this whole thing , justifying an act of violence , bombing to `` submission '' and trivialising civilian death . 
  and i am not criticising the west , just stating the obvious . 
   serbian/yugo forces needed to be bombed into submission and here we are , on the thread about 14 civilians bombed into a submission . 
   un resolution ... ~ ~ which came after nato action ~ ~ which came after the international law was already broken . 
  how many serbs are left in mostar ? 
   you should take germany as a role model . 
  shame on you for even comparing the two . 
  big difference :  14 dead happened  2 milion exterminated would have been worse your imagination,
