piter is the hippiest city in russia , i think they might survive for a few days . 
  something about disrupting our economy , he 's a nutjob . 
   even bigger wut ? 
  i think he meant it in the sense that croatia is too important to be bothered by puny serbia 's threats . 
  what 's interesting , a lot of commentators on our websites approved of his response because this particular minister is in fact a nutjob always trying to stir up shit with croatia . 
  i wrote a short recap of today 's diplomatic row and submitted it twice but the mods just wo n't approve it . 
  so : * serbian prime minister makes fun of croatia 's hospitality which lasted for the whole 2 days and offers to help the incompetent neighbors with handling the refugees [ \\ [ link \\ ] ] ( http://www.klix.ba/vijesti/svijet/zvanicnici-srbije-hrvatska-humanost-je-trajala-dva-dana/150918018 ) * answering to a question about croatia 's unilateral closing of the border between the two countries , serbian minister of social policy talks about the possibility of suing them at international courts [ \\ [ link \\ ] ] ( http://balkans.aljazeera.net/vijesti/zvanicnici-srbije-hrvatska-humanost-je-trajala-dva-dana ) * asked to comment on the threats coming from serbia , croatian prime minister said `` an eagle does n't catch flies . 
  we are the eagle . '', 
  [ \\ [ link \\ ] ] ( http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/milanovic-necemo-nikoga-sprecavati-da-udje-u-hrvatsku-dat-cemo-im-vode-i-hrane-i-neka-idu-dalje/842646.aspx ) * during a joint news conference with the hungarian foreign minister , serbian fm says the following `` i 'd like to answer him with a quote from the movie ` balkan spy ' : ` the eagle has fallen ' . 
  croatia should better watch how to avoid that happening to them instead on giving us lessons '' . 
  you should look up more to your superior slavic cousins , russia and serbia . 
   `` asked to comment on the threats coming from serbia , milanovi\u0107 said `` an eagle does n't catch flies . 
  we are the eagle . ' '', 
  and we 're the flies ? 
  turns out memes do n't provide accurate representations of countries . 
  we 'll replace estonia at the top of the nordic wannabees list . 
  `` you know , in our country those people pass 600 kilometres and stay for much longer than they did in croatia which has been facing this problem for 2 days , while we had it for 4 months '' , said vucic [ prime minister ] who 's on a three day visit to washington . 
  `` i just do n't understand what 's the matter . 
  maybe we 're bad at complaining , crying , asking for money ... 
  i do n't what it is '' . 
  `` we do n't want to pay the price of someone else 's incompetence . 
  if croatia is not competent in handling 6000 migrants , serbia is willing to send them help and people which handled 140,000 of calm and civilized migrants who did n't cause a single incident during their stay in serbia '' , said vulin [ minister of social policy ] , adding that `` he 's sad that the croatian hospitality and solidarity lasted for only 2 days '' . 
  serbs send their regards . 
  yes , frequency , but the article talks about the people who actually die from cancer . 
  in english : http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_id=93601  the number of the expected new cases for serbia in 2014 will be 2.8 times higher than the global average per one million people , he explained , adding that this spelled out `` a serbian catastrophe . '', 
  according to cikaric , `` unlike here , in developed countries the mortality rate has been declining an average of one percent per year over the past 20 years . '', 
   speaking about nato 's depleted uranium ammunition , the doctor said this material with a half-life of 4.5 billion years `` remains in serbia . '', 
  radioactive matter ingested or inhaled in the past is now causing cancer in people . 
  ! \u0645\u0627 \u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 nice to see that some western serbs can still read cyrillic , 
  we have no context , who knows how annoying/confrontational the other guy might have been . 
  also , if i was sleeping in a park and some motherfucker came singing ceca 's shit from the top of his lungs i would n't be gentle at all . 
  no , according to our laws between 22:00 and 5:00 you 're not allowed to be louder than necessary . 
  what ? 
  lol no , he 's singing an old folk song : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4syll0rvkoo#t=33s, 
  not him but the other guy who came last night and woke up everyone . 
  [ did we watch the same video ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/smhmw04.png ) they 're clearly not talking about him . 
   ivan tovic is a morning person . 
  he 's singing , laughing , playing with children ; he 's a burst of optimism in the relentless boredom of this park-slash-refugee camp near belgrade 's central bus station . 
  but there 's one issue : ivan has had at least six cans of staropramen beer . 
  it 's 9:30 a.m.  another problem : islam , the dominant religion among the syrian refugees congregated here , forbids alcohol and takes a dim view of those who drink it . 
  yet mr. tovic is tolerated here , perhaps even welcomed . 
  he bends down to greet an elderly afghan couple with what seems like sincere deference , even kissing the sun-weathered hand of the wife . 
  he lends his bicycle to a lanky syrian boy to take for a spin around the park . 
   `` look , i 'm a drunk , but i drink because i feel bad about all that is happening here , '' he says in a rare moment of sadness . 
  then his face breaks into a huge grin to greet mohammad , a 5-year-old boy playing beside him . 
  mohammad 's mother , yasmine , takes the opportunity to rest . 
  but she suddenly becomes wary when someone tells her ivan is `` sakraan , '' or drunk . 
  `` really ? 
  maybe we should move away , '' she says as she scans the park for another location . 
  but she stays . 
  mr. tovic and mohammad play on .

   if for you free speech are rallies composed by ultra nationalists chetniks yes . 
  i noticed him in other threads . 
  he 's some bulgarian-speaking turk who noticed that / r/europe is a right-dominated forum so he started coming here trying to get affirmation of his coutry 's europeaness from the neo-nazi fat fucks who have nothing better to do than complain about brown people fleeing war . 
  i believe that they , especially syrians , are a whole lot more progressive than the oil-rich gulf countries that some are suggesting they should go to . 
  they 'll fit much better here than they ever would in some wahhabistan . 
  turkey has already taken millions , they ca n't afford a whole country moving in . 
  and making them stay in some balkan shithole would be inhuman . 
  i think you 're underestimating western europe 's wealth . 
  because they 're young , progressive and do n't want to live in oppressive dictatorships . 
  it 's not all about money . 
   what 's the point of keeping the population of [ insert country here ] up if it ceases to be [ insert nationality here ] nation states are so last century . 
  i agree with the rest , we should prevent the bitches from murdering babies for no reason . 
  wtf dude our sodomy is 100 % clean ?!!, 
  of course , only you filthy deviant westerners could think of something so gross . 
  this . 
  it makes the life easier when you get diarrhea from all those half-digested \u010dvarci . 
  united states are lucky to have fair numbers of baby-making immigrants and religious , family-orientated citizens . 
  luckily we 're catching up on the immigrant part but we 're still seriously lacking those religious people , especially in developed countries , who could afford having 5 + children . 
  hedonistic atheists with condoms are the main reason our continent is dying out . 
   realpolitik applies so much in parenting it 's not even funny interesting thought . 
  dads telling their children scary stories about bogeymen who come if they do n't act well are basically kim jong un . 
  and if putin was a president when his daughter was little , he would annex all nearby playgrounds . 
  you should learn how to be more compassionate , dimche . 
  we europeans should be better than that . 
  they 're not going to stay there and steal your ... whatever there is to steal in macedonia . 
  they want to go through as fast as possible . 
  there would be no junk if you just let them go . 
  and 3000 people have to pee somewhere . 
  you 're abusing smileys to express your feelings . 
  you know who else is overly emotional ? 
  stupid people . 
  you know who 's stupid ? 
  ... :d :d you 're fake slavs anyway . 
  they have little children with them . 
  the easiest way to get them to shut up are sweets . 
  i think those 60 cents for a chocolate are worth it . 
   500,000 roma here in serbia if that 's true then how comes there 's still iron in serbia and i get asked for money only 2-3 times a day ? 
  i do n't believe them . 
  according to the 2011 census there 's a total of 147000 romas in serbia . 
  even if a couple thousand went unregistered , there 's no way they all left the country . 
  four months ago the prime minister bragged about unemployment going down . 
  that 's where it went . 
  young , educated people are leaving the country but they 're trying to sell it all as gypsies abusing the system . 
  making a studio look like that would cost a lot . 
  i do n't think they can afford it . 
  awww she 's so cute , i 'd let her brainwash me any time . 
  can someone translate what she 's saying ?
