  what a classy little snowflake you are . 
  do you have any serbian friends ? 
  from what i 've read so far , you would make a great serb .

  you mean second vatican , 
   i 'll assume you are willing to question ( not necessarily give up on ) your assumptions and engage in a decent conversation . 
  i do n't have karma points to spare ( / r/europe is too serbophobic ) and i 've read enough already . 
   you are a guy that would be a perfect ss . 
  that 's what [ bosnians are for ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_waffen_mountain_division_of_the_ss_handschar_%281st_croatian%29 ) . 
  denied the serbs their democratic right to self-determination , occupied them for 3 years and then practically committed a genocide .

  `` eu has no alternative '' is the story we 've been hearing since october 5th , year 2000 of our lord , so we never get any alternative polls . 
  the only ones mentioning it are the two major far-right parties , which according to the [ latest poll ] ( https://i.imgur.com/hcpflcy.jpg ) enjoy 13,6 % support . 
  if serbia were a serious candidate for eeu i think we could easily get 40 + % .

  the stocholm syndrome was ( and still is ) strong among them . 
  they hate the man - a young idealist , freedom fighter and one of the greatest heroes born in the serb lands - who 's act of bravery ultimately freed them from the germanic oppressors and brought them under the rule of a friendly , brotherly slavic king . 
  they 're ungrateful .

   1700 euro  which is n't a lot . 
  that 's a 5 months salary in serbia , probably even more in syria . 
  they like to think themselves important , how cute . 
  knowing how obsessed they are with russia , these polls they talk about must be common knowledge by now . 
  practically all of them . 
  you 're all serbs to me . 
  gay serbs , mountain serbs , the other mountain serbs , traitor serbs , silly speaking serbs ... 
  macedonians are suspiciously quiet . 
  8 serbs but not a single dimche in this thread . 
  it 's like they do n't care about their own country . 
  i thought it 's funny . 
  people here still laugh at remove kebab stuff so i thought i would give them something fresh : - /, 
  of course i shared article about the incompetent fuck that is president of serbia . 
  i hate the government and eu which bought them , gave them power and is now pressuring them to work against our national interests . 
  the world needs to know how shit this country has become since they took over . 
  would you like me to recite a few slovenian epics ? 
  there are none lol i know that in triglav serbia this might seem a bit barbaric but shooting guns in the air is an important tradition in the rest of our country . 
  and the fact that it occured just when albanian tourists came is a huge coincidence . 
  we would never ... like evvver do somethahaha :d, 
  [ hahaha hi ] ( https://40.media.tumblr.com/25c0f20c1ac172e0d183bb151ce7f7e0/tumblr_njk588lcsa1qkvtu0o1_1280.jpg ), 
  some stereotypes exist for a reason . 
  and i 'm not the only one , check other comments from people with serbian flairs . 
  we know them better than anyone else . 
  they were arrested for being serbs . 
  it 's completely normal to shoot in the air for holidays . 
   implying i need special reasons other than it being latvia, 
  google translate is using the albanian name for the lake ( ujmani ) in its english translation . 
  of course not . 
  this is all part of a big fucking conspiracy against serbia . 
  eurofags and obongo have teamed up against the serbs who are only guilty of not bowing to pope . 
  remember , remember the 5th of november , [ 1943 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_the_vatican ) , the best day of my life . 
  it 's based on true events . 
  it sounds unbelievable but satan ( ato ) does n't stand a chance against serbian missiles , led by god as usual .

  you ca n't make this shit up . 
  this is also coming from the country that has fighter aircraft only because russia donated it some mig accumulators . 
  i understand , it 's just that '' * despite * being militarily neutral '' makes it sound like we 're going against our self-declared neutrality for america 's sake . 
  ` murica fuck ye - oh wait this is / r/europe . 
   serbia also does military training with us forces [ and russians . 
  ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=02&amp;dd=27&amp;nav_id=93322 ) it 's not like `` we 're neutral but we like americans more '' . 
  no , we 're neutral and independent ( unlike ukraine ) and we can have military exercises with whoever we want . 
  and that 's probably the best for serbia . 
  good thing they 're not hurt . 
  from google 's translation it seems that they were attacked by an equal number of russians ( two ) . 
  probably some local criminals who got drunk . 
  otherwise i agree it 's important to report about night club incidents of european travellers around the world . 
  we have to keep an eye on our people wherever they go . 
  i think this will help russia push the `` euronazis '' narrative . 
  wwii is a big deal in russia because , as you know , they were supposed to be removed from the history but they managed to defeat the nazis with huge losses ( [ 14 million dead russians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_casualties#ussr ) ) and now that they want to celebrate it , half the continent is boycotting them . 
  probably , yeah . 
  not as funny as the 90s but there should be some drama now that croatian elections are coming . 
  great weather ? 
  lol wtf dude, 
  this is in response to albanian pm talking about [ `` unification '' of kosovo and albania `` through eu '' ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=24&amp;nav_id=93574 ), 
   [ what is a fab ? 
  ] ( https://www.eurocontrol.int/dossiers/fabs )  a functional airspace block ( fab ) is defined in the single european sky legislative package as an airspace block based on operational requirements and established regardless of state boundaries , where the provision of air navigation services and related functions is performance-driven and optimised through enhanced cooperation among air navigation service providers or , when appropriate , an integrated provider . 
  but what really matters is that airspaceically speaking estonia can into nordics , and austria-hungary is back .
