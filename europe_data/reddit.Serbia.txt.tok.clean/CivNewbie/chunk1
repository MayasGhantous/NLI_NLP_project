bad wording . 
  fascist submission of the flag of ... 
   you are attributing the whole war casualties to one side ? 
  that was the side who started the war and is thus responsible for each and every death . 
  in the same way , nazi germany is responsible for each and every dead axis soldier and civilian . 
  serious . 
  some of the things he 's been doing lately could be pre-election campaign , but he 's had similar episodes in the past as well . 
  note : both sources are croatian , leftist/liberal ; in other words , his voters . 
  please correct me if i 'm wrong , but it seems that you deny that denial of genocide is genocide ? 
  that 's kinda wrong : / the convention is old , created at a time where negating the genocide was deemed impossible to happen . 
  that was before the rwanda and b&h genocides . 
  the convention is going to change eventually , just as it did to - for example - include mass rape as a component of genocide . 
  in any case , the genocidal entity in b&h denies genocide and does its best to obstruct things such as finding and digging up mass graves . 
  let 's not even get into what they teach their children ... 
   well if the above happens and it stops committing genocide then it 's not really genocidal afterwards is it . 
  does it acknowledge genocide ? 
  because this one does not do that - it negates it . 
  which , by definition , is the ** [ final ] ( http://www.genocidewatch.org/aboutgenocide/8stagesofgenocide.html ) ** stage of genocide . 
  therefore , it is still a genocidal entity , just as germany or belgium would be if they negated what they did . 
  there is no such country called `` republika srpska '' . 
  it 's an ethnically-cleansed political entity in the sovereign country of bosnia & herzegovina , formed through genocide , mass rape , and the death of 100.000 people , all in the name of greater serbia and greater croatia . 
  the submitter is pushing a fascist agenda of negating bosnia & herzegovina as a sovereign , internationally recognized country . 
  the entity was formed through genocide . 
  that means it 's a genocidal entity . 
  ca n't be any simpler than that . 
  once again - if all armed conflict and all deaths cease in the islamic state , and the world allows it to exist as , say , an entity in iraq , everything would be fine on your end and you 'd vehemently defend your opinion that it 's * not * genocidal and has full political and moral reasons to keep existing ? 
  yes or no , please . 
  still the first one , although currently without weapons . 
  you really have no idea what 's going on in the genocidal entity these days , do you ? 
  changed ? 
  nothing has changed . 
  to an extent , it 's even worse . 
  so what you 're saying is that the islamic state should also be allowed to exist ? 
  yes - it 's a genocidal entity that is the shame of the entire civilized world . 
  it should not have been allowed to exist , as the only reason it does exist is genocide and fascism . 
  i still maintain that nobody needs to be banned , unless they 're not contributing anything of use . 
  op posts good stuff often . 
  this submission is fascist and as such should be removed . 
  that does n't mean the op should disappear . 
  i heard from a couple of different sources that milanovi\u0107 is heavily bipolar , and the meds he 's on ca n't suppress the illness entirely . 
  that actually makes sense , for anyone following his statements through a longer period of time . 
  edit : i forgot to mention that there are certain similarities between milanovi\u0107 and vu\u010di\u0107 in terms of control of all written media . 
  milanovi\u0107 recently made a child with another woman and no media was allowed to write about it ; vu\u010di\u0107 recently divorced and remarried and no media was allowed to write about it . 
  this is the fascist flag of the genocidal entity in b&h . i will report this submission , and so should you . 
  such a pretty man . 
  exactly that . 
  always a bit more to the southeast . 
  we do n't like camouflaged meat !, 
  of course not . 
  the balkans are * always * just slightly more southeast from where one lives , for * he * is part of europe , and * they * are balkan savages . 
  mrs. mccarthy needs some [ leskova\u010dki voz ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=leskova%c4%8dki+voz ), 
  that 's old news . 
  the new news is that serbia blocked cargo trucks , and croatia blocked entry for people with serbian passports . 
  i meant for regular small passenger cars . 
  this will just speed up the decisions by other big cities ( apart from paris and london ) to ban diesels . 
  it looks like the technology can work to an extent ( trucks have big tanks of urea ) , but it does n't seem to scale economically nor physically down to passenger cars . 
  from what i read , the cheating vw cars used both lnt and scr , which means neither of those two technologies is good enough . 
  maybe someone will figure out a revolutionary way of cleaning up diesel in 10-15 years , but ev are on the rise ... and i still want to see a complete city ban on personal cars as such - just replace them with autonomous networked electric pods , four of which could easily fit the space taken by one average car . 
  not sure what to do with service vehicles , but it would be nice to see a city almost entirely devoid of combustion engines . 
  the first city that does that somehow , i 'm moving there . 
  this could finally be the death of diesel . 
  it 's not going in a meaningful direction , despite billions invested into researching how to lower harmful emissions - hence , cheating . 
  there are people who eat sweet popcorn ? 
  like , sweet popcorn ? 
  wtf ? 
  everyone 's entitled to freedom of speech . 
  he might be fascist , but he 's not exactly dangerous to anyone , so no reason to ban him . 
  i did n't know that . 
  generally , it 's not a good idea to appoint a fascist as a moderator , in case anyone on reddit wonders . 
   and that motherfucker almost became a mod here ... is that for real ? 
  i get amazed by how beautiful romanian is every time i hear it spoken ... 
  no , but public sector salaries do . 
  what exactly are you talking about ? 
  do you need citations ? 
  graphs ? 
  exact numbers ? 
  what ? 
  or are you just trolling for the sake of it ? 
  oh god , you 've been brainwashed by the media as well : / `` sins of the past governments '' , `` restructuring '' , `` public sector not to blame '' , `` change in methodology '' ... look , it 's simple - i 'm not in the mood to go into exact detail , so i 'll leave you with this very simplified version : when the world recession hit in 2008 , the private sector scaled down and laid off / fired hundreds of thousands of people in the countries mentioned . 
  those who remained at their jobs got salary cuts . 
  the private sector provides basically all of the income in a country ; the public sector eats up that income and creates no income / value of its own . 
  strong labor unions , as a post-yugoslavian remnant , coupled with corrupt , power-greedy politicians , made sure that no job / salary cuts happened in the public sector . 
  that 's called `` keeping social peace '' . 
  also worth noting is that while the private sector had huge rates of unemployment , the public sector actually hired more and more people . 
  those people are votes in the elections . 
  the end result is that all of the balkan countries now have more people in the public sector ( again , creating no value and income ! ), 
  than before the 2008 world recession . 
  as a result , public debt started ballooning back in 2008 and it 's still going up , despite decreased velocity ; but going up nevertheless . 
  read this , it 's in slovenian , but you 'll manage just fine , even if you just look at the pretty graphs comparing slovenia to eu and undeveloped countries ; the same holds true for other balkan countries : http://www.finance.si/350011/slovenija-ima-rekordne-pla\u010de-v-javnem-sektorju ( also pay very close attention to salaries in the public sector actually * increasing * during the worst part of the recession ! ), 
  ( also , it 's funny that i 'm now the joint target of a croatian and slovenian downvote brigade , even though the nations - as is the norm on the balkans - usually hate each other . 
  yes , they do . 
  in both countries , the public sector has higher salaries than the private sector . 
  ergo , loans and debt to keep the public sector workers happy , whereas realistically their salaries should be 30 % lower than the private sector for the same job position . 
  nobody knows , actually . 
  the current regime likes to make things up , twist statistics and fabricate numbers out of thin air . 
  no such thing as `` debt increasing in accordance with eu '' exists . 
  if that 's what you 've been told by your media , then you have more problems than i initially thought . 
  also , preliminary 2016-2017 predictions point to slovenian gdp growth dropping compared to 2014-2015 : http://www.umar.gov.si/fileadmin/user_upload/publikacije/analiza/pomladanska_napoved_2015/pomladanska_napoved_gospodarskih_gibanj_publikacija.pdf from +2.5 % down to +2 % . 
  there 's a difference between `` being in debt '' and `` having your debt rapidly increase '' . 
  both slovenia and croatia were around 30 % five years ago , and now they 're near 90 % .
