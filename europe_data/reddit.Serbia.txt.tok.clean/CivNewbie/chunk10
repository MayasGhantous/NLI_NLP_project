   but croatia did n't fight bosnia , did it ? 
  yup . 
  the whole thing has mostly been swept under the rug because they later joined forces against serbia , so the early period of the war , where tu\u0111man wanted a greater croatia in the same way that milo\u0161evi\u0107 wanted a greater serbia , just gets conveniently forgotten . 
  here 's a very fun fact : tu\u0111man and izetbegovi\u0107 [ signed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-_jijj7uvs ) a confederation document between croatia and bosnia & herzegovina in 1994 , on the same day that the federation in b&h was formed . 
  technically , that agreement is still in place ; i do n't think the dayton accords dissolved it . 
  some say they ended up in the current croatian government . 
  poor spoiled babies . 
  i recommend civilization iv for this , for the `` stack of doom '' . 
  civ iii and earlier had `` spearman destroys battleship '' , and this is just too many units for 1upt in civ v. 
  but why in the first place ? 
  if i were given a task to perform an act of aggression on a country , i 'd try to run away . 
  if that was n't possible , and if i got forced to go there , i 'd take the first opportunity to put a bullet through my brain . 
  that 's the only reasonable thing to do from my perspective . 
  you do n't clear individual buildings by using millions of artillery shells and through indiscriminate destruction of the entire city . 
  i have this deeply unnerving and disturbing feeling that you 're proud of what you 've participated in , and that 's not a good thing . 
  yes , but those things are n't `` house to house combat '' . 
  the intent was to deliberately destroy the entire city . 
  i honestly can not understand why anyone would want to do such a thing . 
  sheer madness . 
  i think you 're overestimating it . 
  you do n't get to destroy an entire city with small arms . 
  [ requiem for vukovar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfx4gjbsi0g ) truly one of the largest atrocities since wwii . 
  to destroy an entire city - a city - that is the bottom of the barrel of so-called humanity . 
   how can we respond to these atrocities , and prevent more occurring ? 
  like i wrote in the other thread : this can not be fixed by the west . 
  militant islamists are islam 's problems , and the problems can only go away if islamic countries themselves declare a war on terror , go through a major reform , and get rid of all the rotten fruit on their branches . 
  i 'm also going to add that a lot of attacks - possibly this one , too - are carried on by a second generation of immigrants , born and raised here . 
  this can not be fixed by the west .

  nope . 
  it 's just an example of what i think would have happened in this particular situation . 
  last week i was at a bar , someone got wasted and something pissed him off , and he wanted to fight a random guy drinking nearby , shouting `` i 'm gon na kill you ! '' . 
  his friends contained the rage and prevented him from doing anything . 
  now , if he had a gun , he probably would have killed that person ( or the opposite , if * they * had a gun ! ), 
  and his friends would n't have been able to contain him , lest he shoot them as well . 
  answer : absolutely not . 
  fuck guns . 
   everybody had the most bleeding heart , `` let 's treat them well '' attitude at first . 
  `` hungary , do n't do that , be nice '' . 
  then when the herd actually made it to their doorstep it was `` holy shit there 's too many of them !, 
  abort , abort '' [ relevant ] ( http://starecat.com/content/wp-content/uploads/angela-merkel-feeding-pigeons-too-many-running-away.jpg ), 
  usually about [ squatting and tracksuits ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64wbna6jl0w ) . 
  words are more important than money , and pussylips * still * can not utter the word `` genocide '' . 
  so that 's 5.000.000 / 8.373 = 597,16 $ per head . 
  what a great price . 
  when i was but a small child , my mother said to me `` even though you were bad , i have some candy for you !, 
  :d '' she gave me licorice . 
  from that moment on , i only needed to be * told * that i 'm going to get licorice , and i 'd transform to a peaceful little angel . 
  he 's serious . 
  the propaganda in the last 25 years has been incredible . 
   so effectively , serbia is for the next 2 years in a position to completely block any kosovo eu integration nope . 
  the agreements are not to block each other in any way . 
  if serbia blocks kosovo , eu blocks accession talks . 
  nah , it 's not like that . 
  from every document i 've read , they do n't have any power whatsoever to be disruptive . 
  it 's an extended version of giving them minority rights ( still not full autonomy ) , and in a way , it 's a test for kosovo 's maturity as well . 
  be peaceful , respect the differences and set an example . 
  remember that while serbia is technically closer to eu integration , these things slow its accession . 
  might not be said publicly , but that 's the case . 
  every single anti-kosovo thing serbia does is another delay in their accession process . 
  not a single chapter has been opened yet , and that 's for a reason . 
  just wait and see the headlines `` chapters maybe , possibly by mid-2016 '' , because it 's not likely to happen this year , simply due to the whole `` we 're sitting on two chairs ! '', 
  farce . 
  kosovo needs to do its best to improve to shorten the accession gap , which currently stands at about 7-8 years in terms of documents signed and processes started . 
  if kosovo does things right and if serbia does things wrong ( which it continues to do ) , the gap can eventually , with time , be shortened to 4 years . 
  and that 's nothing , just like a unesco delay of 2 years is nothing . 
  you got 65 % of the positive votes . 
  that 's a huge majority . 
  focus on that fact . 
   you will never find a clip of serbs doing anything like that because they never did anything like that . 
  except in croatia and bosnia , removing ~ 1000 church \u0161trukli and mosque kebabs , and pummeling entire \u0161truklokebab cities and villages to dust . 
   seriously , this thread is sad to read . 
  such threads always are . 
  well , membership in 2017 , that 's not too bad . 
  after 95,11 % of the votes : hdz 56 +3 = 59 ( those 3 are from diaspora ) sdp+ids 55 +4 = 59 most 19, 
  i know a thing or two about croatian politics , and to me it looks like most wants reforms and layoffs in the public sector , whereas hdz and sdp hire people to the public sector to give them votes . 
  this could be very interesting . 
  first exit polls : 56 seats to sdp coalition ( current ruling party , leftist ) 56 seats to hdz coalition ( rightist ) 18 seats to most ( a new option - their leader said `` no coalitions with anyone without accepting our terms for reforms '' and even had that stamped at a public notary ! ), 
   yea , right , we will accomplish what next to none of the western european countries accomplished ( sweden and norway only accomplished it , hell , not even finland or denmark are green countries ) that 's why i said that   edit : also about chadda , he is not pro-eu , he is pro-usa same shit . 
  eu is usa 's babby . 
  also the coin swastika . 
  foreign politics are all that matters for such a third option , and those need to be of a certain type because that 's what the party is all about , not `` because * ` they ' * ask us to do this or that '' ( `` they '' being evil europe who gives them no choice ) . 
  vu\u010di\u0107 might technically be , say , pro-eu and pro-lgbt , but in practice he 'd rather not have to be that way ; it 's just that those things * must * be done as evil europe wills them . 
  chadda the alpinist is also pro-eu and pro-lgbt , but ldp 's stance is that those things * should * be done because they 're good for the people and the society . 
  anyway , my personal opinion is that this region will finally evolve to a civilized standard when the third option with its 15 % gets to be some kind of a green party of dirty hippies who have the power to veto a new coal plant because it 'll endanger the local butterfly population . 
  true , but are they * really * different ? 
  the third option in serbia would be something like the famous alpinist chedonnir chadda 's ldp , which is just different enough to put everyone else 's panties in a twist . 
  everyone else is part of the same ol' socialist/nationalist melting pot in one way or another . 
  every fool has a political party these days , but none of them are strong , and by that i mean none of them can take even 15 % of the votes . 
  hell , not even the * second * strongest party in serbian 2014 elections got 15 % . 
  if you had a 40-35-15 split , then things would become more interesting , because the 1st and 2nd could n't do shit without the 3rd . 
  worst thing is when someone from a party that got 2 % of the votes gets in a coalition with the leaders and then grabs a ministry spot because they were needed to form absolute majority - when that happens , you just * know * they 'll use their sudden luck to launder and steal as much money as possible in the next four years . 
  one common thing in the entire geographical area is that people do n't tend to vote * for * someone as much as they vote * against * someone else . 
  this is why a strong third option is desperately needed everywhere . 
  `` just people who romania '', 
  if romania is anything like the other balkan countries , then a small farmer with one cow will absolutely , positively need a brand new tractor , just because his neighbours have one . 
   with us you get 13k euro after tax a year . 
  i wanted to go work in sarajevo next in several years to pay my share of war reparations through taxes , but it looks like i might be going to prishtin\u00eb first ... 
  the statement is misleading because you ca n't just count hypothetical unborn children as a direct loss . 
  but nevermind that .
