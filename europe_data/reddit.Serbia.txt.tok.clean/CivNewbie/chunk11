  the reality is worse . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_serbia first , looking at 2002-2011 census data , the actual physical loss is about 300k ( 7.5 to 7.2 m ) , but !, 
  the census is flawed , as it makes no distinction between permanent and enumerated population . 
  the four years since the last census also saw a population drain through emigration , so taking those two things into account , the actual physical loss between 2002 and 2015 is even greater . 
  second , if you go back to the 1991 census , before the wars , you 'll see 8.1 million , compared to 7.5 in the 2002 census , but !, 
  the nineties saw hundreds of thousands of serbs from croatia , b&h and kosovo move to serbia and add to the local population . 
  assuming that 0.5 m people migrated to serbia during that decade , you get 8.1 +0.5 -7.5 = 1.1 m people lost from serbia between 1991 and 2002 . 
  now add the 300k directly lost according to 2002-2011 census difference , add an estimated 300k difference between permanent and enumerated population due to census flaws , add at least 100k in the last four years and you get an actual physical population drop of 1.8 million between 1991 and 2015 , without having to include theoretical unborn children to make for sensational headlines .

  poland can into stellarator !, 
  it takes a certain kind of * special * to downvote . 
  yes . 
  the karad\u017ei\u0107 trial includes genocide in bratunac , fo\u010da , klju\u010d , prijedor , sanski most , vlasenica and zvornik , and it 's very reasonable to assume - given the state of b&h - that 's he 's going down on all counts . 
  more info : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prijedor_massacre and http://stopgenocidedenial.org/2012/05/15/remembering-prijedor-massacre/  on 31 may 1992 , the bosnian serb authorities in prijedor , a town in north western bosnia and herzegovina , issued a decree for all non-serbs to mark their houses with white flags or sheets and to wear a white armband if they were to leave their houses . 
  this was the first day of a campaign of extermination that resulted in executions , concentration camps , mass rapes and the ultimate removal of more than 94 % of bosnian muslims and bosnian croats from the territory of the prijedor municipality . 
   this was the first time since the 1939 nazi decree for polish jews to wear white armbands with the blue star of david that members of an ethnic or religious group were to be marked for extermination in this way . 
  ( personal note : this will be reclassified as genocide next year , along with several other places of genocide , after the karad\u017ei\u0107 and mladi\u0107 icty trials are done ), 
  the breakup of yugoslavia left tens of thousands of operational heavy weapons , tanks and jets , hundreds of thousands of tonnes of ammo , and hundreds of thousands of people who went through mandatory military service . 
  there are no such things now - neither the equipment , nor the ammo , nor the people . 
  every single major internet media outlet in serbia that allows comments is being overrun by the ruling party 's bot army , upvoting their own comments literally by the thousands and downvoting everyone else 's . 
  mind you - that campaign very likely started even before putin 's . 
  to make matters worse , comments on all said media are pre-moderated , which means that someone has to deliberately publish them ; even when the exact same comment , word-for-word , comes from different ip addresses and is signed by a different nickname . 
  i guess vu\u010di\u0107 's troll army is now going to spread to different countries as well and their software got an upgrade . 
  it 's the exact opposite . 
  the demonstrations are * against * eu and nato . 
  i personally think it 's a nice little touch , but others seem to disagree . 
  i do n't follow the general subreddit drama much , but i do know that no matter what the forum , there will always be one mod that everyone picks on . 
  even if it 's a brony forum or one about gardening . 
  it was a joke , since there 's a french mod here that always gets downvoted . 
   man , i would really love to see some guidance on what constitutes low quality content for our mods if it 's not in english or french , then it gets removed . 
  and this is how slovenia and austria learn exactly what all other countries have been going through , and that there 's no stopping a group of a thousand people . 
  in this case it strangely is n't . 
  do n't know why . 
  the power plant was a very big deal in yugoslavia , and i think two more were supposed to be built , but i 'm not old enough to know the reasons why that never happened . 
  slovenia and croatia are mixed up on your image . 
  furthermore , the data in the source is incorrect ( !, 
  ) , since the nuclear power plant , while technically in slovenia , is equally co-owned by both slovenia and croatia , and they both own/produce half the power output . 
  i 'm willing to bet they 're at least 50 % faster than balkan trams . 
   it 's getting quite ridiculous , 12 buses or a train arrive , dump migrants , and show them a direction . 
  the migrants then walk for hours in rain and cold until locals alert our police so they can organise a pick up . 
  the same thing that happened when hungary closed its border , and serbia started dumping buses on various croatian border crossings ? 
   i also seriously doubt that serbia was registering all the people , who entered . 
  you are correct . 
  http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=18&amp;nav_category=12&amp;nav_id=1052827 `` 220.000 registered/discovered since the start of this year '' that 's nowhere near true . 
  then they go through b&h . 
  yeah , they do n't want asylum unless it 's in germany or sweden . 
  so that basically amounts to `` nobody gets in '' ... 
  the country that first uses its army to quell the riots of several hundred thousand migrants stuck in a very concentrated area : /, 
  here 's the thing : croatia must not build a fence . 
  it 's not even an option . 
  why ? 
  the only place the fence can be built is on the border with serbia . 
  if that happens , migrants get transferred to montenegro and b&h , in which case they enter croatia down by the sea . 
  tourism would suffer , and nobody 's ever going to allow that . 
  i do n't even think it 's technically possible to build the fence on the border with b&h . it 's not plains , like in hungary . 
   could any of the balkans countries survive 100k + people rioting in winter ? 
  nope . 
   i truly hope europe bands together to atleast make winter camps . 
  that 's potentially 100k people per month . 
  winter has n't even started yet . 
  in the worst case scenario , we could be looking at close to half a million people by the end of winter . 
  winter camps and tents wo n't do - this requires bricks and mortar and proper insulation , an insane amount of power , and literally ten thousand medical personnel . 
  this is n't going to go well . 
  hungary wo n't accept anyone . 
  they built their little ~ ~ [ tank ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lieutenant_hubert_gruber ) ~ ~ fence . 
  the greece -  macedonia -  serbia -  croatia route is at least 5000 migrants per day . 
  sometimes it 's close to 10k . 
  slovenia will only take 2.5 k daily , which means the main travel route is going to get clogged by 2.5 k + migrants every day . 
  in a month , that 's going to easily be 100k . 
  mind you , if austria keeps this up , slovenia gets clogged with 50k migrants in a month as well . 
  winter is coming ( no pun intended ) and there will be serious problems . 
  somewhere along the route , there will be 100k people per month stranded in cold rainy weather . 
  i might be a pessimist , but i think we 're soon going to be looking at a complete disaster . 
   slovenia will only allow 2,500 migrants to cross its borders daily - half the number neighbour croatia has asked for . 
  ...  interior ministry secretary of state bostjan sefic said slovenia could not accept croatia 's request to take 5,000 , because austria 's daily limit is 1,500 . 
  ...  there are also reported to be 4,000 migrants waiting at a reception centre in the east croatian town of opatovac , hoping for an onward journey towards slovenia . 
  ...  around 40 buses of people were backed up in serbia on sunday , and tempers flared between frustrated migrants and overstretched police officers . 
  ireland and the uk are n't europe . 
  they 're some kind of weird islands from [ lost ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/ ) with something that barely resembles food , and something that barely resembles weather . 
  i 'm showing a pattern of organized mosque destruction by serbia . 
  there were also hundreds of destroyed and heavily damaged catholic churches in croatia . 
   would you like me to show you facts about more than 500 mosques burned and destroyed in kosovo during 98-99 conflict ? 
  419 destroyed and 1152 damaged in bosnia . 
   a tear gas attack in a fucking parliament but yet `` everyone 's been calm about it '' ? 
  \\ #justbalkanthings, 
  i think industrial slaughterhouses have long moved past slitting the throats of cows and pigs - it 's done via some kind of hard impact to the head , iirc , or a heavy electric shock to the area . 
  depending on how the pig is * taken care of * , might be better that you did n't witness it . 
  if the pig gets slaughtered , instead of getting an unsuspecting bullet to its head , there is a lot of noise . 
  i do n't think anyone can ever forget the sound of a pig screaming for its life , along with the gargling noises .
