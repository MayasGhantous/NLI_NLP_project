  you 'd argue that the sky is n't blue if i wrote that . 
  there were 1500 + tons there , they were all supposed to blow up . 
  like above , i do n't think any more explanations are needed as to what happens when a tenth of the hiroshima bomb explodes . 
   in your posts you compare serbia with nazi germany , blame serbs for every misfortune in the balkans and portray others as completely innocent . 
  nobody is innocent and i do not portray them as such . 
  i will leave comparisons of croatia to nazi germany ( including the recent fascization , including clerofascism , and the general rise of neonazism-bordering right-wing extremism in the country ) to croatian people . 
  cleaning your own yard , things like that . 
  the only thing i will do is point a big finger of blame towards croatia for attacking b&h and creating at least one `` vukovar '' of their own ( bonus points if you know which city i 'm talking about ! ) . 
   furthermore you dont write serbian properly which makes me wonder why you have a serbian flair ? 
  there is no `` serbian expat '' flair , and i have n't spoken serbian proper in many , many years . 
  i 'll keep everything in english if that makes you feel better . 
  bad automatic translation here : https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.b92.net%2finfo%2fvesti%2findex.php%3fyyyy%3d2015%26mm%3d09%26dd%3d29%26nav_category%3d12%26nav_id%3d1045231 the guy blew up 170 tons of explosives two kilometers from the croatian city of bjelovar , pop . 
  60.000 with surrounding villages . 
  the plan was to blow up all 1500 + tons stored there and annihilate the entire area to dust , all civilians included , but only the smallest warehouse actually got blown up , leveling a dense forest in a 300m radius and heavily damaging or destroying over 1000 residential houses and homes . 
  prior to that incident , the city was shelled heavily from the army barracks . 
  footage of shelling and the huge mushroom cloud : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhh5cjdhnh8 vulin , serbian minister of fascism , called tepi\u0107 a `` great hero who will always be remembered '' . 
  well , you could have had * spaghetti * bolognese representing you . 
  not cool to hide things in headers . 
  subreddit themes can be disabled , and then the headers are n't displayed . 
  the block is lifted now . 
  it was in place because opposition parties have been spamming people and spreading anti-western propaganda . 
  heavy ddos attacks ( probably nation-state-sponsored ) are still in place against certain online media , like cdm.me . 
  sports . 
  i 'm okay with that . 
  but what does mexico put on pizza ? 
   so , $ 1000 in a hypothetical country called `` l33tl4nd '' , and $ 1000 in another country called `` sp33kerl4nd . '', 
  now , in l33tl4nd , a kebab costs $ 1000 , while in sp33kerl4nd , the same kebab costs $ 1 . 
  assuming the whole economy consists of these kebabs , then , although the nominal gdp is the same , in terms of ppp , then sp33kerl4nd has a gdp ppp 1000x higher than l33tl4nd . 
  but then a guy with $ 1000 says `` oooh , what a lovely 60 '' 4k tv !, 
  i want this !, 
  '' , opens his wallet , buys the tv and places the box in his large pickup truck . 
  when he gets home , he watches netflix in ultra-high-def . 
  man , that 7.1 surround sound is effing awesome !, 
  the $ 100 guy still watches tv on his 22 '' 4:3 crt , which - if it were human - would have just been old enough to gain right to vote in the upcoming elections ; to just think that it * only * took three years to repay the loan for ol' trusty teevee ... thankfully he does n't have to move the tv anywhere else , because his horse died from malnutrition . 
  and look !, 
  there 's a great old 1955 movie about fantastic leader on one of the two tv channels tonight !, 
  because anyone who does n't love mexico is probably ginger and does n't have a soul . 
  so why not cornbreros ? 
  do you also eat those vegetable leaves ? 
   was n't there a leaked recording from croatian officials in croatia that was saying that if conflict happened croatia will move to protect croats ? 
  `` protect '' , maybe . 
  `` help wage aggressive war '' , no . 
   croats have the best army though there is only one joint army in b&h . if you 're thinking about the armies of neighbouring countries , it does n't matter whose is the best , because they are not going to fight each other . 
  their only potential course of engagement would be to protect the dayton accord and sovereignty of b&h , and thus use military action against anyone who tries to break b&h apart . 
  croatia is likely to do that , serbia is likely to stay on the side . 
  any attempts to supply weapons and logistics to minorities in b&h to fight a proxy war would result in heavy economic sanctions , another decade or two lost , another million people emigrating , in the case of croatia getting kicked out of eu and nato , and in the case of serbia , another 1999 . 
  local politicians are stupid , but they are n't that stupid . 
  any war that breaks out in b&h is over in two weeks . 
  it 's completely unsafe against drop bears . 
  the boat looks very dangerous . 
  definitely australian . 
  am i imagining things , or do i already hear `` cyka blyat '' twenty seconds into the video ? 
  i am really hungry now :(, 
   also 1 $ for a single taco ? 
  jesus christ for 1 $ i can get an entire order !, 
  that 's it . 
  i 'm moving to mexico . 
   ok , you really do n't get it . 
  i specifically do n't give a shit what the media say about this `` anyway i watched a documentary a few months ago on croatia ''  that 's why i asked my question to a croatian to have the opinion of a local . 
  i 'm local , and of `` unwanted '' ethnicity . 
  you have some problems , buddy . 
  really , it * is * the answer to your question . 
  basically every country in europe currently has issues with neo-nazis and far right that leans into fascism . 
  from there on , it 's up to the media how to portray it . 
  a small group might become big news , a mountain can be made out of a molehill , and tsar putin may label the entire ukranian nation as neo-nazi if he wishes to do so , based on a single batallion of ukraine paramilitary fighting there . 
  but if you want things more directly : no . 
  not there , not anywhere else in europe is nazism and fascism a serious problem . 
   can you explain the situation a bit ? 
  mostly the same as ... france : http://americablog.com/2014/02/french-conservativereligious-right-protest-yells-jews-get-france.html germany : http://www.timesofisrael.com/10000-hold-anti-islam-protest-in-eastern-german-city/ sweden : http://europe.newsweek.com/neo-nazi-activity-rise-europe-316465?rm=eu belgium : https://news.vice.com/article/far-right-protesters-giving-nazi-salutes-hijacked-a-memorial-for-the-brussels-attacks slovakia : http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/03/06/neo-nazis-gain-parliamentary-seats-slovakia/81400716/ hungary : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jobbik ... etc. 
  that 's europe right now . 
  because they still have their own wet dream of having a third entity in b&h , and that 's why they support rs . 
   no , it totally does n't do that . 
  he asked about the legal justification by the supreme court , i answered the question . 
  this is about the national day . 
  i seem to have expressed myself badly in my original post . 
  nope . 
  see here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_day extremely few exceptions ( have n't counted , but probably 5 or less ) . 
  none of them in countries even remotely similar to b&h . 
  it violates the international convention on abolishing racial discrimination , as well as the european convention on human rights and freedom . 
  late edit : that 's not my opinion , that 's what the constitutional court said as legal justification . 
  the problem is n't the date as such , it 's that it goes hand-in-hand with celebrating an orthodox [ religious holiday ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slava ) at the same time . 
  you just ca n't have any type of religious holidays mixing in with ~ ~ state holidays ~ ~ national days , and you ca n't ban religious holidays , either , which means you can only ban a ~ ~ state holiday ~ ~ national day - which is what happened here . 
   vucic and tomo debil werent involved in the war other than being nationalisting demagogues do you need a link to pussylips carrying a rifle above sarajevo , or a link to toma grobar boasting about how he may have even killed someone in croatia ? 
   sorry but you made war criminals like haradinaj and thaci leading members of your govrenment ... and you made fascists like vu\u010di\u0107 and nikoli\u0107 prime minister and president . 
  how about that ? 
   and also with your history of ` keeping safe ' of serbian landmarks , you really should n't join either . 
  can we kick out serbia then , due to destroying literally thousands of croatian , bosnian and kosovar landmarks ? 
  poland can not into radiation poisoning, 
  i do n't mind the ketchup at all . 
  what i do mind is minced meat , beans , and whatever those white round things are . 
  what the hell ? 
  fresh data : http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2016&amp;mm=08&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_id=1169392 a large part of the population works for less than 200 $ per month . 
  modesti blejz , zagor te-nej , mister no , teks viler , rip kirbi , princ valijant , tali\u010dni tom ... 
  alan ford is not only not on the list , but it 's also not on the top spot ... 
  which means the entire list is invalid . 
  not true !, 
  i recently watched an episode of house where a small girl had two types of heart cancer !, 
  absolutely nothing . 
  there are several verdicts claiming exactly the opposite . 
  but none of them hold any legal value whatsoever , because they do n't apply to those not directly on trial .
