  the next verdict could say `` milo\u0161evi\u0107 was the first man to walk on the moon , before neil armstrong '' and it would n't mean that was true . 
  that 's not a nice thing to say about your slovakians . 
  [ big and strong ] ( http://winterson.com/2009/01/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west-redux.html ), 
  yeah , direct that question towards the americans . 
  it 's their fault . 
   operation storm helped lift siege of the biha\u0107 area . 
  something that few people understand is that srebrenica would have been child 's play compared to what would have happened if biha\u0107 fell . 
  the number of victims would be an order of magnitude higher . 
  icty is highly inconsistent . 
  the verdicts differ , and the trials finished later do n't take into account verdicts from trials finished earlier . 
  it 's entirely possible to have a verdict that states `` x '' , and a different verdict later states `` not x '' , or the opposite . 
  here 's something interesting : serbia is currently in the process of rehabilitating [ milan nedi\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milan_nedi\u0107 ) . 
  [ dra\u017ea mihailovi\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dra\u017ea_mihailovi\u0107 ) has already been rehabilitated . 
  hey , this is like a balkans thread !, 
  pokemines . 
  yuo are of worst traitor , pu pu uj !, 
  wtf france , actually . 
  what kind of security is that ? 
  someone could have smuggled in a deadly weapon instead of flares . 
  i did some website work for a uk client around that time , and things were hectic due to the uk ico requiring a very visible and obnoxious notice that cookies are being served , otherwise you 'll get sued and stuff . 
  here 's something i just quickly found : https://books.google.com/books?id=jprecwaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa222&amp;lpg=pa222 `` later in 2007 , the uk ico appeared somewhat stricter requiring a notice displayed to all visitors about the use of cookies ... '' if you google `` ico cookies 200x '' ( 2006-7-8 ) , things will come up . 
  i do n't have time to do it right now and provide more sources , dinner 's cooking !, 
  fun fact : this whole cookie nonsense started in the uk around 2007-2008 , ca n't remember exactly . 
  [ something to read ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fpescanik.net%2fzasto-su-nas-bombardovali%2f ), 
  yeah , those can be found in most offices here . 
  they are nigh uncleanable , so everyone who has a dust allergy has a really great time when they approach a venetian blind . 
  you ... you do n't have them ? 
  this is new to you ? 
  why ? 
  it 's a shame ... for what it 's worth , i think the portuguese language is beautiful , so at least you have that !, 
  interesting . 
  what happened that the industrialization was delayed ? 
  that kind of sounds like a volcano somewhere in south america . 
   colonialism . 
  you are welcomed , world . 
  i still have no idea how portugal , with all its colonies , turned out to be so much less wealthy than other colonizing countries are nowadays . 
  that 's exactly what i thought !, 
  i first heard the song last night , and i immediately said `` that 's like burial , and that 's fucking awesome '' . 
  i have nothing but deep respect for burial . 
  i do n't understand why spain was placed so low . 
  any other year , and this would have won . 
  huh . 
  i thought canada was bigger . 
  paywall, 
  are these edible ?

  they got bought out by some greek guy or company , and have been spewing sputnik and state propaganda ever since . 
  up to that point , they were decent media , but all the worthwhile stuff , like insajder , got cancelled . 
  they are very much in bed with the ruling political party now and deliberately publish bot comment spam , along with many forms of hate speech by right-wing lunatics and fascists . 
  ( comments on the website are pre-moderated and have to be published by someone to be visible . ),

  now let me see if i can find my candy bar wrapper from 1960 - it 's an antique , it 's got ta be worth a hundred grand these days ... '', 
   i do n't think republika srpska is really that comparable to crimea or novorossiya , and if they do want independence what is the issue ? 
  genocide is the issue . 
  and that would also be why you are absolutely correct this is n't comparable to crimea or novorossiya . 
  actually , some of them are from herzegovina , which is , of course , part of the sovereign country of bosnia & herzegovina . 
   i guess hundreds dead that day killed themselves aswell . 
  find [ this book ] ( http://www.worldcat.org/title/zene-krajine-rat-egzodus-i-izbeglistvo/oclc/442815286 ) and read it . 
  you might be surprised about what you find in there . 
   he was a character and had a good sense of humor when i watched some of the documentary films following him around / r/awwschwitz /, 
  because bulgarians are just eastern macedonians . 
  stop pretending you 're someone else and embrace who you really are . 
  pellets emit just slightly less co2 than wood ( because they have less moisture ) , but it 's not co2 that causes smog and respiratory problems . 
  it 's nox and sox , and those are also less of an issue . 
  still a big issue , but less than burning wood . 
  the main advantage of using pellet fuel is that it 's more or less automatic . 
  dump a sack in the container every couple of days , and the system uses as much as it needs to . 
  with wood , you have to keep the fire going constantly , including waking up in the middle of the night to add a log or two into the furnace . 
  that said , pellets are somewhat more expensive than wood , and you need to make your purchase in spring , maybe early summer at latest , when prices are low . 
  if you did n't buy enough , and you get a strong winter such as this one , you 're screwed - you ca n't feed your heating system with anything but pellets , and since demand is high , you 're looking at double the spring-summer price . 
  gas is the cleanest and also the most expensive combustion fuel , but it 's extremely convenient . 
  there 's also oil , but i do n't know much about that . 
  it 's probably extremely dirty and smelly . 
  [ pellets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pellet_fuel ) are a better option , if you can afford it . 
  but if you 're chopping down trees illegally , you probably ca n't . 
  natural gas is the cleanest combustion heating . 
   funny thing is serbia even gained population after the war . 
  there have been territorial changes . 
  read the pdf i posted above ( which got downvoted ) , it 's all explained inside .

  tad \u0111ej men, 
  just some friendly rockets on vacation . 
   mark my words , by the end of this year , croatia will choose the gripen as the new fighter jet to enter service after mig-21s are retired in 2019-2020 . 
  mark my words , it 's going to be f-16 , 
  if you manage to do that without touching your best friend , then no problem whatsoever . 
  if you 're a man , also wash your hands before you pee . 
  from my understanding , the plan is to put solar panels all over the tube . 
  there is still an energy requirement . 
  it is lower than other forms of transit , but it 's still there , especially since we 're talking about something that 's running long-distance . 
  cars and planes require fossil fuels and do n't have a large coefficient of energy transformation , trains ( even electrical ) are super-heavy , and all of them need to deal with air resistance . 
  hyperloop does n't , so that 's a benefit . 
  i found this , supposedly from musk 's initial presentation , in which he supplied no info about calculating those numbers : https://dqbasmyouzti2.cloudfront.net/content/images/articles/energy_passenger_per_journey_hyperloop.png this puts it at about a fifth of a tesla mode s energy usage , but another quick googleing told me the following : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tesla_model_s electric range 70 kwh ( 250 mj ) 240 mi ( 390 km ) the bar chart above is at about 250 mj for the s , but it 's still per passenger per journey , and the s is listed as having 2 passengers - so i do n't know what that 's all about . 
  we also do n't know how many passengers there are in a hyperloop pod . 
  and there 's also the issue of a lot of heat being radiated into the tube , by the system , and by ambient/sunlight . 
  presumably , the tube will also have to be cooled . 
  it 's vacuum or near vacuum , so it wo n't be easy and electrically cheap . 
  provisions need to be made for closing off sections of the tube in case of malfunctions and emergency evacuations . 
  this also means a lot of power and generators and backup generators every 500m - 1km or so . 
  hyperloop will require lots of power ... 
  tripes are a delicacy .
