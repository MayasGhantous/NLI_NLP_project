  click that for everything you do n't want to see , and poof , gone . 
   because this sub was made a default , which shifted the user-base away from having mostly consisted of federalists interested in european topics towards typical european reddit users , who are mostly young males with a lot of free time . 
  so ... those reddit users who , erm , * migrated * here from somewhere else have disrupted the balance and the old way of life on / r/europe . 
  maybe they should have gone to a different subreddit much more suited to their online culture , or adapted to how this subreddit was before , instead of posting their extremist comments and dank memes and taking over other people 's threads ? 
  and it 's always just the young male redditors going somewhere ; where are the old reddit people and female redditors , why are n't they joining to post here ? 
   ( this was n't personal nor in any way directed at you specifically ), 
  that 's not a nice thing to say about macedonians .

   as many people here know , i 'm a fan of flags . 
  potholes dislodge kidney stones . 
  that 's always a good thing . 
   if you do n't want to do it for being okay with your neighbours , do it for the fucking money !, 
  if everyone here got rich , then the countries would buy more weapons . 
  guess what would happen then ?

   they imagine all of us to be vodka drinkers living in snow covered commieblocks yeah . 
  we drink rakija , and global warming made sure there 's not a lot of snow on our commieblocks :(, 
   because i thought serbia is finally aligning with the eu , as most of its neighbours do . 
  it is . 
  this whole `` russian friendship '' thing is more along the lines of `` eu , you better hurry up to take us , or else ... '' . 
  however , that 's truly irrelevant now , and will be for the next several years , as serbia has n't even opened a single chapter , and the accession is going to last 10 years minimum , with a realistic target of 2030 . 
  nobody in the eu cares about what serbia does and will be doing for a very long time . 
  if this continues after 2020 , then there might be problems . 
   i almost get the feeling that you 're trying to prove that there 's some conspiracy against serbs in the hague yeah , it 's the cia and the vatican . 
  you should consider an eurail pass and just travel all around . 
  ca n't see more countryside than by train !, 
  http://www.eurail.com/ plan a route , ride the train , observe the countryside , sleep in cheap youth hostels that all 50k + cities have , visit a dozen countries in a month . 
  i see you have never owned a cat , 
  from what i learned , the split-zagreb rivalry started during the war , after the bbb hooligans started making fun of daily power and water reductions in dalmatia . 
  almost , but not quite . 
  that 's victory/liberation day , and everything else is secondary ( if at all mentioned ) , despite the un resolution , which means nothing in practice . 
  nobody ever said anything about innocent/civilian victims specifically . 
  it was a blanket statement by pussylips , he-who-carried-a-gun-on-the-hills-over-sarajevo , and an attempt to put an equality sign between * everyone * . 
  it 's you who does n't understand that . 
  this whole thing is not going to happen and it should not happen . 
  also , get rid of your nationalist paranoia . 
  i have lived in croatia for a fair few years , so the languages intermix . 
  not a big deal for non-nationalists , but obviously a big deal to you  in any case , placing an equality sign between a helpless victim of any of the multiple genocides in bosnia and a terrorist whose idea of fun was shelling sarajevo to kill civilians is simply incorrect from a civilized point of view . 
  i think it is not fair to call him like that . 
  sure in the past he said and done the things he has said and done . 
  but he was a 20-year old then and is 45-50 year old now . 
  from the personal experience , i know people can drastically change in that time . 
  then he changed ( `` changed '' ) in the last eight years , not twenty . 
  remember this ? 
  http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=26&amp;nav_category=11&amp;nav_id=248428 did nikoli\u0107 `` change '' ? 
  if he did , then it was only during the last three years . 
   the point here is to pay respect to the people who were killed , tortured or evicted from their home without no fault of their own . 
  that 's it , to pay respect to innocent victims of all nations and denominations . 
  that 's going to happen as soon as there 's a joint remembrance day for both the victims of the allies and the axis . 
  in other words - never . 
  everyone is free , and quite welcome , to have their own remembrance days , but a joint one is n't even morally correct , to put it mildly . 
  nothing , it 's just interesting . 
  also , 1 % is infinitely bigger than 0 , 
  http://www.blic.rs/vesti/politika/516150/milijarde-dala-eu-a-od-rusije-nista--istina-o-donacijama-srbiji over 6 billion $ so far , a tenth of that from the us . 
  nothing mentionable from uk , but then again , 0 ( zero ) from russia . 
  not everyone who is n't a \u010detnik nationalist is `` a croat '' . 
  do you remember the old yugoslavian joke about mujo driving on the autoput bratstva i jedinstva and hearing on the radio about a madman driving in the opposite direction , then thinking to himself `` bolan , ja ih ve\u0107 izbrojao petsto '' ? 
  the only one who should shut the fuck up is pussylips . 
   they supposedly wanted to show how they care for serbs by rejecting the attendance to the celebration in croatia and yet over 40 diplomats and high-ranking military personnel , including china , attended the military parade in croatia . 
  gb , poland and baltic states sent their flags , too . 
  there 's no neutrality here . 
  everyone is on croatia 's side , and for a very good reason . 
   every baby born in the balkans today is automatically a serb , croat , bosnian , whatever i think a much bigger problem is that every baby is born orthodox/catholic/muslim , instead of human . 
   why june 20th ? 
  my bad , it 's actually july 20th ... :( that 's when the pm in question went on one of his many displays of pure unadulterated fascism in the serbian parliament and called for the death of 100 muslims for every 1 dead serb . 
  it 's probably on youtube , now that i think of it ... yup , it is . 
  seems like everything is on youtube . 
  depends on the number of various kebab removals during those 999000 years ... 
  not in a million years . 
  i vote for ~ ~ june ~ ~ july 20th !, 
  i think it 's funny that everyone here gets their panties in a twist over someone who was 100 % american , 
  the name is common in the area . 
  the surname is n't . 
  by itself , it denotes a tool used to carve wood or something like that . 
  fun fact : a lot of romanians think tesla was `` theirs '' due to wallachian origins . 
  for a long while , romanian wikipedia claimed tesla 's mother was wallachian/romanian . 
  fun fact : slovenia often gets snail mail for slovakia , and vice versa . 
  that could very well be it . 
  i wish i could tell you more , but i ca n't - i do n't know where and when that happened . 
  i have no reason to doubt what he told me . 
  i have n't talked to him since i moved away from serbia , and i ca n't find him on facebook or anywhere else . 
  if i could , i 'd ask . 
  yeah , about 80 dead and a couple of hundred wounded . 
  i had a buddy who barely survived that , but his grandmother did n't , as she was too slow to get out of the way . 
   then i suppose that hundreds of serbian civilians burned their own houses and killed themselves too , right ? 
  according to various ** serbian ** publications ( articles , books , etc ) - yes , to a great extent . 
  many people committed suicide because they did n't want to part with their weapons to be able to enter bosnia , many died due to lack of water and money to buy it from bosnian serbs , many set houses on fire so the evil usta\u0161e would n't get them ... 
  many such events are described in this book , through interviews with women who fled : http://www.worldcat.org/title/zene-krajine-rat-egzodus-i-izbeglistvo/oclc/43685709 also , close to a hundred people died when a column of serbian tanks ran them over while fleeing . 
  that 's about half of all victims and crimes . 
  the other half was purely croatian crime . 
  things are n't as black and white as usually portrayed . 
  last names have nothing to do with nationality . 
  it 's a slovakian last name , but whatever floats your boat , 
  [ this girl ] ( http://rs.n1info.com/a79402/vesti/bivsi-pripadnik-nacionalnog-stroja-menja-pol.html ) is much prettier , though , 
  what else should i have ? 
  i may be an expat , but that 's irrelevant for the cause . 
  `` the great balkan kebab removings '' war is very much shit for everyone involved . 
  however , only one country/nation has been involved in all four wars in eight years , and that 's more or less everything that needs to be said about that dark and evil decade .
