  the same as of milo\u0161evi\u0107 twenty years ago . 
  he never did the right thing , ever . 
  not even this time - as he 's still a denier of genocide . 
  good . 
   celebration of `` oluja '' is way sicker . 
  yeah , because the war totally started in 1995 . 
  everyone can learn the truth if they want to . 
  it 's only a matter of actually wanting . 
  i 'm human , but there is no such flair here . 
  yes , that 's better  the estimated number varies - it 's hard to tell due to massive migrations during and after the war , but it 's between 80k and 300k . 
  generalizing on the level of an entire race or nation is pure fascism . 
  what 's to be expected when the prime minister of the country is someone who wanted to kill 100 muslims for 1 dead serb ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugqv9cjbd3u the propaganda is real , and now we have an entire generation of people who grew up on this . 
  no , ** you ** should read the drafts . 
  the final one does n't even contain anything prefixed with `` serb '' . 
  http://www.scribd.com/doc/270919186/srebrenica-draft-resolution-which-failed-in-unsc-on-july-8-2015 stop believing in serbian fascist propaganda . 
  just stop it . 
  it 's not good for you as a human being . 
   it was n't about srebrenica but about declaring serbian people genocidal except that this was never in any of the drafts . 
  not the first , not the final one . 
  are you aware how much propaganda you 're being fed through state-controlled media ? 
  1221 vs. 1523 is a very tough choice indeed . 
  i never got around to trying mdma . 
  by the time i convinced myself i was ready , the market - according to my party buddies at the time - was mda and mdea , usually mixed with other uninteresting shit like meth . 
  and now i 'm too old to try it . 
  kardashians , maybe ? 
   but in french , the welsh national rugby team is nicknamed `` le xv du poireau '' ( the xv of the leek ) a-ha , that 's why . 
  when i think of cymru , i think `` red dragon '' . 
  i honestly had no idea leek was a thing . 
  do you want me to see your ads ? 
  make them a part of the page , regularly , through normal html , and serve images from your domain . 
  do n't give me crap that loads javascript through four domains and is known to distribute 0-day crypto malware . 
  in other words , average criminals make you go gay .

  meanwhile , an article on b92 yesterday : http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2016&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=04&amp;nav_category=64&amp;nav_id=1115935 `` 15 years after the discovery , a mass grave in batajnica ( a district in belgrade ) with 705 exhumed bodies of murdered kosovar civilians , including 75 children , is still unmarked '' it takes a lot of effort to dig out such a mass grave and transfer 700 + bodies several hundred kilometers so they can be hidden . 
  like denial of genocide ? 
  which has a standalone radio button when reporting a post ? 
  no , he just said that croatian nationalism was due to serbian nationalism . 
  nothing to do with jews . 
  and in a way , he 's correct . 
  ask some slovenians . 
  and croatian nazis killed jews because they were croatian . 
  got it . 
   oh , my bad . 
  now , do you know what croatia lost after ww2 ? 
  [ i do ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/banovina.png ), 
  a country with 0 remaining military is defeated . 
   he was proven innocent not yet legally . 
  this is just a first-degree , non-binding judgement . 
  there will be a second one some time in the future , which may or may not confirm the findings . 
   wrong , serbia was defeated by combined efforts of austro-hungary and germany and bulgarian attack was focused later to cut off serbian army retreat . 
  they attacked after germany took belgrade , not before . 
  yes , bulgaria attacked a couple of days later . 
  austro-hungary and germany conquered belgrade and stopped just south of kragujevac , then went west to montenegro . 
  bulgaria occupied everything below that point , which was like 75 % of serbia at the time ( as it included present-day macedonia ) . 
  that 's called `` ethnic cleansing '' . 
  are you denying that , just like you 're denying the srebrenica genocide ? 
   i just do n't see how any of that actually forces serbia to create yugoslavia instead of just expanding itself . 
  serbia was completely defeated by bulgaria . 
  for three whole years it basically did not exist ; it appeared on the map again two weeks before the end of the war . 
  it was in no position to expand itself afterwards , and the entente would n't have allowed it in the first place after a complete military defeat . 
   for example , croatia and slovenia could have gotten their independence as well not at all . 
  they would have remained partitioned and under the rule of austria , hungary and italy . 
  greater serbia was never an option for anyone involved . 
  the territories spoken of , and present on the map ( which were never precisely defined ) were just so italy - which was to join the entente - would have less of a border with the triple alliance . 
  the london treaty was null and void legally , and it was mostly a ruse . 
  italy was so angry after versailles that , well , you know what happened a few years later with that guy who brought the roman salute back into play ... 
  anyway , the kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenes ( later kingdom of yugoslavia ) was formed for several reasons opportune to all parties involved . 
  everyone would be free from austro-hungary on the wings of a pan-slavic movement , there would be territorial gains , the new state would have a larger military and diplomatic power , bulgaria and italy would no longer be a threat , etc. 
  unfortunately , the kingdom immediately became a single-nation dictatorship , and that 's when all the hatred started brewing . 
  just to set things straight : that 's entirely his fault . 
  he obstructed the court on every chance he could : * by refusing a lawyer and wanting to represent himself * by claiming he ca n't read the latin alphabet * by claiming that he does n't understand anything that is n't 100 % pure ekavica * by claiming that he does n't know how to use computers , so he had to have everything printed out ( in cyrillics ) and be given a typewriter * by insulting the judges multiple times * by writing books insulting everyone he could ( sidenote : books reviewed positively and co-signed by vu\u010di\u0107 , current prime minister of serbia ) * by holding political speeches and refusing to proceed in court * by refusing to present his defence * by having to be dragged out of the courtroom by security multiple times * by asking to have a judge replaced * by threatening witnesses ( through writing books , giving out their names , and having criminals visit the witnesses and threaten to kill them ; serbia is yet to deliver three of \u0160e\u0161elj 's party members to the hague ) * by going on hunger strikes ... etc it 's his fault . 
  the trial could have been finished in two years , maybe three . 
  so why did serbian nazis kill jews ? 
   and then a war breaks out , and you are suddenly driven out of your home , or killed on the spot . 
  [ like this ?

   take a look at this map and you 'll understand why most of us feel really fucked by whole yugoslavia project and why we support the notion of ` greater serbia ' . 
  ah , the map that serbia was to know nothing about and was n't present at the meeting where it was discussed amongst many other options ? 
  the map that , even if agreed upon , would n't have ever come to reality after the serbian army all ended up on corfu , and it was pure strategic coincidence that the french army pushed bulgarians back and liberated serbia ? 
  because if it were n't for france , serbia would have been the size of slovenia , consisting of belgrade and \u0160umadija . 
  have you overslept your history lessons ? 
  no worries - this gets overturned after appeals , whether he 's alive or dead . 
  for now , he has a job to do in serbia , and he 's gon na start talking soon . 
  he 's already been released : http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2016&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=29&amp;nav_category=16&amp;nav_id=1113597, 
  just wait until vu\u010di\u0107 discovers reddit . 
  his bot army is doing downvotes by the thousands on various news media comments . 
  `` croats from the oven '' ? 
  that 's just nasty . 
  so we 're posting random opinions from 2008 now ? 
  it still does n't matter , the math does n't add up no matter how you put it . 
  the only correct number is the number of aircraft - although that is also misleading , because it also includes air recon , refueling , awacs , uavs , a-10s over kosovo , etc. 
  everything else is fabricated . 
  http://www.icty.org/sid/3639  during the attack by the bh army on kravica , jezestica , opravdici , mandici and the surrounding villages ( the larger area of kravica ) , on the 7th & 8th january 1993 , ** 43 people were killed ** , according to our information . 
  our investigation shows that ** 13 of the 43 were obviously civilians ** . 
  our findings are matching with the bratunac brigade military reports of battle casualties which are believed in the otp to be very reliable because they are ** internal vrs reports ** . 
   for the whole region , i.e the municipalities of srebrenica , bratunac , vlasenica and skelani , ** the serb authorities claimed previously that about 1400 people were killed ** due to attacks committed by the bh army forces for the period of may 1992 to march 1995 , when srebrenica was under the control of naser oric . 
  ** now the figure has become 3,500 serbs killed . 
  this figure may have been inflated . 
  ** taking the term `` victims '' as defined previously , these figures just does not reflect the reality .
