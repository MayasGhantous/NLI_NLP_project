   i wish to name various serb sources on serb victims which has circulated until recently . 
  they are maybe not detailed but as they were presented . 
  ** according to the rs commission for war crimes , the number of serb victims for the bratunac-srebrenica-skelani region was until recently 995 victims ( 520 bratunac area and 475 srebernica area ) , of which kravica , 43 victims . 
  **  according to ** `` the chronicle of our graves '' ; a book by milivoje ivanisevic , the president of the belgrade centre for investigating crimes committed against the serbian people ** , claimed that the number of ** serb victims for bratunac-srebrenica-skelani region was 1,200 victims ** but presented personal ** details available for only 624 victims ** . 
  the author claimed that all 353 kravica inhabitants were `` virtually completely destroyed '' which is not accurate . 
   another book , ** `` for the honourable cross and golden freedom '' ; a book ( 1,508 pages ) by unknown authors from rs and in collaboration with the rs ministry of interior ** , claimed that the ** no . 
  of serb victims for the bratunac-srebrenica-skelani region is 641 victims , all war-related '' ** . 
  # ** `` 641 victims , all war-related '' **, 
  there have been 187 civilian casualties , which is still a lot , although it does include those deliberately sacrificed by the government , such as 16 in the tv building , or those who had aa emplacements placed next to their homes and who were forbidden to leave them . 
  the school i went to as a kid had a 20mm aa gun placed on its roof , and it probably did a lot more damage to civilian structures than the cruise missiles it was shooting at ( and hit none of them ) . 
   tu\u0111man was freed ??? 
  no , that fucker died from metastasised colon cancer shortly before he was to be charged by icty . 
  a story has it that he technically died from sepsis once his colon got blocked to the point of feces returning to his stomach and being vomited out . 
  sometimes i think that such induced colon cancer would be a fitting punishment for everyone on trial in den haag . 
  did anyone pay attention to the numbers ? 
   during the aggression nato carried out a total of 2,300 airs trikes on 995 facilities across the country , while 1,150 combat aircraft launched nearly 420,000 missiles . 
  now let 's do some math . 
  1.150 aircraft , 2.300 sorties 420.000 bombs -  420000/2300 = 182.61 missiles per aircraft per sortie 22.000 tonnes -  22000/2300 = 9.57 tons per aircraft per sortie 9570/182 .61 = 52.41 kg per missile 995 targets -  420000/995 = 422.11 missiles per target 995 targets -  22000/995 = 22.11 tonnes per target but wait !, 
  there 's more !, 
   the bombing destroyed and damaged 25,000 housing units , 470 km of roads and 595 kilometers of railways . 
  995 targets -  attacking a target also destroyed or damaged 25 houses , 0.47 km of roads and 0.60 km of railways , on top of :  the attacks also damaged 14 airports , 19 hospitals , 20 health centers , 18 kindergartens , 69 schools , 176 cultural monuments and 44 bridges , while 38 were destroyed . 
  tl ; dr - all of the numbers presented , including the casualty `` estimates '' are complete bullshit . 
  read more about casualties [ here ] ( http://pescanik.net/ljudski-gubici-tokom-nato-bombardovanja/ ) through the help of google translate . 
   sounds pretty bad so i decided to google it . 
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civilian_casualties_during_operation_allied_force the wikipedia numbers are wrong . 
  i wrote about that previously . 
  http://pescanik.net/ljudski-gubici-tokom-nato-bombardovanja/ the correct number is 187 civilian casualties . 
  i ca n't wait for the day that genocidal fascist shithole of an entity finally disappears forever . 
  i last saw a firefly around 2003 or so . 
  then a drunken idiot killed it :(, 
  except the macedonians . 
  everyone loves macedonians . 
  you have been put on the `` terrible internet '' list . 
   threads about west balkan countries always make me deeply grateful that we were able to reconcile with our former enemies . 
  you are just one government away ( yours or someone else 's ) until that changes . 
  do n't think it 's permanent . 
  is it too late to grab popcorn and watch the comment show , or will there be more ? 
  sure it does !, 
  do you think electricity stops at a border crossing to have its papers checked ? 
  is a razor fence going to stop it ? 
  electricity goes right through it and does n't bleed !, 
  electric power goes where it damn pleases , and nobody can do anything about it !, 
  just do n't prescribe hellenitex for that , doctor . 
  one of the first full-length adult movies i had on my computer was called blow dry , starring jenteal and kobe tai . 
  every thread . 
  every . 
  damn . 
  thread . 
   you do n't fan your hair guys ... can you fan your ass hair , / u/asshair ? 
  so it was really just a handyman ? 
  no bald thugs with gold chains in the basement ? 
  or an illegal betting op . 
  that 's the only reason i can think of for having 10 tvs - people need to watch games and follow the scores . 
   yeah it was n't necessary when 10 years ago it destroyed around 10 tv 's in our basement ...  ** 10 tv 's in our basement ** what ? 
  probably around the same time when serbia donates 500 + billions of dollars it blew to pieces in 1991-1999 . 
  yes , and they also put out some fires . 
  but they delivered the bill in the form of expensive natural gas , 
  [ do you see the zero on the far right ? 
  amoebas were actually serbmoebas , but americans renamed them . 
  i have to  he actually has a phd in law ; obtained it at the age of 25 outside of yugoslavia . 
  a fully legit doctorate on the subject of fascism ( !!!, 
  ) , mind you . 
  \u0160e\u0161elj is extremely intelligent . 
  then again , insanity and intelligence are n't mutually exclusive . 
  everything he did , ever contempt of the court , every book he 's written , it was all done on purpose . 
  he fucked up because he wanted to . 
  he made a vow to make mockery of the icty and also make himself a martyr ; in his delusional mind of a true madman , that 's exactly what he did . 
  the whole story with serbia and \u0160e\u0161elj is a bit too complicated to go into details right now ( i should be going to bed ) , but let 's just say that the current political leaders in serbia ( prime minister and the president ) are basically his `` children '' who have recently merely switched to different clothes , but are still the same people as they were 25 years ago . 
  if he talks , and since he does n't have much longer to live , he probably will before he dies - things may become very interesting . 
  he was his own lawyer and he intentionally prolonged his stay in prison through various incidents , because he 's batshit insane . 
  is there a life sentence for bronies ? 
  there should be . 
  [ olm on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olm ), 
  he 's being sarcastic . 
  the general right-wing propaganda in serbia is that everyone in the former yugoslavia is a serb , and that basically nobody else existed until twenty-five years ago . 
  i 'm wondering if it would be a good idea to buy gbp with eur if it drops to 1.2:1 , bet on brexit failing , and convert currency when it rebounds back to 1.35:1 minimum ... 
   do you have a source for those numbers ? 
  wikipedia says it 's between 489 and 528 civilians killed wikipedia is wrong and uses hrw * estimates * - and the hrw [ paper ] ( https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2000/nato/natbm200-01.htm ) also uses very weird methodology , such as including an estimate of 87 kosovo albanians killed by nato inside its toll of ~ 500 . 
  for a scientific approach , based on extensive research , read this : http://pescanik.net/ljudski-gubici-tokom-nato-bombardovanja/ that 's 187 civilians , and that is the truth . 
  have you done that and counted the names ? 
  because look here : http://pescanik.net/ljudski-gubici-tokom-nato-bombardovanja/ the nato casualty list in serbia is 187 civilians ( 11 children ) and 93 military/police . 
  that 's the reason there is n't a single consolidated list of casualties . 
  would n't go well with the general propaganda about `` thousands '' . 
  as an interesting twist , the nato casualty list in kosovo is 220 civilians ( 40 children ) and 27 paramilitary . 
   nato had killed 2,500 serbs in 1999 , of which 79 children . 
  where are their names ? 
  where is the list of names of all the people who have died in 1999 ? 
   how did serbia start this ? 
  you need to start here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gazimestan_speech then you need to continue here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/log_revolution after that , you need to realize that this happened half a year before the things you mentioned in b&h : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vukovar also you need to remember this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_sarajevo and many other things , too . 
  your understanding of history is seriously and utterly fucked up . 
  true . 
   i imagine there is n't massive different between a bosniak born in serbia and a bosniak born in bosnia when it comes to genetics . 
  it depends where their ancestors came from . 
  a lot of people west of serbia , of all nationalities , have [ vlach ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vlachs ) origins .

   original release 26 may 1965  the idea of the show came from french president charles de gaulle , whose wish was that french and german youth would meet in a series of funny games to reinforce the friendship between france and germany . 
  i 'm trying to imagine a series of funny games reinforcing friendship between the countries of former yugoslavia twenty years after the war , and all that comes to mind is lots of blood , 
   i really have no idea what they had in mind when they set age of consent to be 14 . 
  c'mon , girls are in 7th or 8th grade of elementary school at that age .
