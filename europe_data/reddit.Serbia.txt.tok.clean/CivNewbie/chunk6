  and ... ? 
  it 's not like they 're not having sex at all . 
  they are . 
  hormones are overwhelming at that age . 
  it does n't matter if you put aoc at 14 or 18 - in both cases , the same amount of sex will be had . 
  you ca n't change that . 
  the laws are there just to make things less awkward and less illegal . 
  if at 14 you 're expected to start choosing your educational path in life , something that will shape your entire future , why ca n't you be trusted to bone as much as you 'd like , something that wo n't change anything ? 
  sheep children . 
  tasty , tasty sheep children . 
  i kind of prefer [ this ] ( http://www.agronews.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/peceno_jagnje.jpg ) ... 
   you imagined or willingly presented him as a person who equalises communism and antifascism yes , because all the nationalist right-wing fascist lunatics are the same . 
  it 's the same old `` antifascism equals communism '' story . 
  and only true fascists can say that . 
  tito should n't have been so lenient . 
  the new minister of culture is a neo-nazi . 
  is n't that great ? 
   why ca n't you admit that croatians also committed atrocities , and that tudjman is as a war criminal as milosevic ? 
  what ? 
  we were n't talking about that at all . 
  but if it makes you feel happy - yeah , tu\u0111man was a fascist shithead as much as milo\u0161evi\u0107 , and his idea of forming a greater croatia was by no means different than the idea of forming a greater serbia . 
  but that has nothing to do with what happened to the terrorists . 
   the situation has since been resolved by croatia winning the war and ethnically cleansing the disputed territories . 
  no , that was an organized voluntary exodus of terrorists and their families . 
  [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/demographics_of_rsk.jpg/800px-demographics_of_rsk.jpg ) was ethnic cleansing . 
  it was estimated that by 1995 , the area occupied was 99 + % ethnically pure . 
  in the nineties , all sides had hundreds of heavy artillery pieces , tanks , one side even had hundreds of aircraft . 
  now , 12 howitzers or an aa battery are suddenly a threat ... ? 
  lol . 
  politicians are scum . 
  if you want to take my meat away , you will have to kill me first . 
  it 's in your head now . 
  forever . 
  forever . 
   and how dare you bring turbo polka here ? 
  two words : [ \u010crna ma\u010dka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xygp_on5baq ) . 
  i was kind enough not to link that originally . 
  be quiet , or next time i 'm going to link the fireman song . 
   interestingly enough slovenians are genetically closest to slovakians - even more then they are to the rest of the yugoslavs . 
  slovenia has [ turbo polka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi7wnifbwxk ) , like the rest of the balkans has turbo folk . 
  it 's clear where they belong . 
   it is a really popular holiday destination . 
  yeah , czechs love to go there and die climbing a mountain in flip-flops or swimming to an island 5km away !, 
  roos , drop bears , huge deadly spiders . 
  run the following two links through google translate : https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/nebeska_srbija https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovski_mit ( this one has an english version , but it 's sparse and not very good ), 
  that depends on uncle sam ... 
  the most important thing is that the karad\u017ei\u0107 verdict will also confirm genocide in bratunac , fo\u010da , klju\u010d , prijedor , sanski most , vlasenica and zvornik . 
  dodik has a fire burning under his ass . 
  karad\u017ei\u0107 and mladi\u0107 verdicts are also due this year . 
  i say we 'll see a referendum by the end of 2016 . 
   i seriously do n't know where this fear comes from . 
  well , let 's wait and see . 
  we wo n't have to wait long . 
  probably not even until the end of 2016 . 
  there would be no such thing as `` offensive action '' . 
  croatia takes banja luka , br\u010dko and trebinje 8-12 hours after something happens to warrant an intervention . 
  serbia may , or may not , do something on its own to protect the territorial integrity of b&h and help the federation . 
  probably not , though . 
  two days later , it 's all over . 
  any type of prolonged warfare is almost impossible . 
  if serbia tries to support bosnian serbs , it 's gone as a country as we know it , and so are all the serbs from b&h . 
  that 's just light weaponry . 
  basically no heavy weapons are operational . 
  serbia can only come to the aid of the federation . 
  anything else , and 1999 looks like a walk in the park . 
  you ca n't have a war without weapons , and those are basically gone , which means 5k soldiers will quickly put a stop to everything . 
  if b&h ca n't do it , then croatia can , in 2-3 days tops . 
  no foreign invasion will be necessary . 
  the army and police of b&h will easily do the job once the time comes ( and that time might very well be before the 25th `` birthday '' ) . 
  in related news , serbian mfa gets overdosed on shitty brlja . 
  something that always amazed me is how you go through lika where it 's foggy and stupidly cold ( it always is ) , there 's no sunshine anywhere ( like , never ) , and the moment you pass velebit there is n't a single cloud in the sky and you have to switch the car 's air conditioning from heating to cooling . 
  that 's the chicken and the egg problem  theoretically , if you had many billions of $ extra ... 
  the airport is nearby , and so is the city bypass . 
  get rid of the garbage dump ( yeah , easier said than done ) and the train thingamajig , as well as build another bridge in that general area , and then you get a great commercial zone . 
  you have the bypass , the railway and the airport . 
  dugave seems to be built in a very good way . 
  get some more of that built , with a lot of trees and parks . 
  designate a large area for houses ; none are allowed more than one floor , and all of them must have large yards . 
  get natural gas and fibre to that area . 
  also place it near the canal , which will have year-round water after you 've built some dams upriver . 
  build a port . 
  there - you have a `` rich people neighbourhood '' . 
  if you look at a satellite view of the area , it 's still just a bunch of fields and low-density residential . 
  lots of space and lots of opportunities there ... 
  do you know why the expansion stopped ? 
  there 's only like 100k people living to the south of the river . 
   yes , like in southern sweden . 
  it melts within a day or so since it 's never freezing temperatures on the ground . 
  that 's weird . 
  is it because of the sea ? 
   10sec . 
  exposure , f5 .6 , iso400 nobody asked for that , so yeah , pro photographer definitely confirmed !, 
  we 'll see ... not many people generally in the world recycle things . 
  i do n't put much hope into having proper lithium recycling before it runs out : /, 
  we need a new breakthrough battery tech for that to happen . 
  lithium reserves do n't seem to be that great - about 13 million tons , which at 10 kg per car amounts to 1300 million cars . 
  car production is going up and is currently at about 75 million per year , so if we replace every organic fuel car with a lithium battery car , that 's theoretically barely above 17 years until all the lithium is gone on cars alone . 
  but we also use lithium for the production of glass and aluminium , phone batteries , medicine ... from what i know , there is nothing on the horizon to replace lithium batteries : /, 
  all of that is correct , but my personal opinion is that we should slowly start getting diesel to be more expensive than petrol , due to all the extra nasty pollution . 
  if/when all the car manufacturers improve real-world pollution , i have no issues with lowering the price again .
