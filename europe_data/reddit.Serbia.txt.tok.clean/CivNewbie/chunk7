  but until then , we 're making the existing problem worse . 
  are you serious ? 
  `` vague research '' ? 
  this is a common fact that i was just reminding him of . 
  no , seriously , were you unaware of that ? 
  here you go then : http://pic.plover.com/nevin/nevin2007.pdf http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jfeigenbaum/files/feigenbaum_muller_lead_crime.pdf http://www.nber.org/papers/w13097.pdf http://web.natur.cuni.cz/~houdek3/papers/mielke%20et%20al%202012.pdf, 
   diesel nox is certainly not `` far more carcinogenic '' than petrol 's benzene . 
  there 's more to diesel exhaust than just nox . 
   because the risk for human health by lead in super was quite null https://www.google.com/search?q=lead+violence, 
  i find it amazing that diesel is going * down * in price after the recent nox scandal and the fact that diesel exhaust is far , far more carcinogenic than petrol exhaust ... 
   vojvodina is hungary !, 
  just ba\u010dka ... srem is croatian and banat is romanian . 
  but first we need to get a couple of hundred thousand germans over there . 
  no , it was n't used in 1918 . 
  and while it was used in the late years of tu\u0111man 's fascist autocracy , it really makes no difference in this case . 
  it 's a nazi name . 
  end of story . 
   reiner announce changing name of institution , wtf , who cares ? 
  everyone in europe should care , because it 's not very common to see the return of a name used during the nazi regime . 
  yes , very serious . 
  `` serbs '' and `` croats '' and all others started appearing in the middle of the 19th century . 
  before that , there was no such thing as nationality . 
  not here , not in the rest of europe . 
  simple as that . 
  this is how it started : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_revolution this is a general simplified version : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rise_of_nationalism_in_europe bottom line - the concept of nations and ethnicity is a thing that we can roughly place around the year 1850 . 
  i 'm sure you know about that famous quote from [ massimo taparelli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massimo_d'azeglio ) - `` we have made italy . 
  now we must make italians . '', 
  so there you go . 
  that 's 1850 for you , right there . 
  the idea that `` croats '' or `` serbs '' or `` french '' or `` italians '' ( or any others ) existed before 1800 as the earliest is absolutely absurd and is the result of right-wing fascist propaganda . 
  there was no `` ethnicity '' , either . 
  there were just people following a certain religion . 
   those are the serbs/croats that bent the knee to the ottoman sultan , and made up the bosniak ethnicity . 
  no , because nations are a concept that 's about 150 years old . 
  there were no `` serbs '' or `` croats '' anywhere in the area before 1850 or so . 
  what , you do n't have enough mafia as it is , so you have to import extra from ny ? 
  it would cost a megafuckton of money ( which b&h does n't have ) to build a port and the relevant transport infrastructure . 
  tourism in the neum area ( 10-15k bed capacity ; growing yearly , so i do n't know the number ) would suffer greatly . 
  the sea is tranquil due to geography protecting the bay from strong winds , which means no strong currents to move the water ; bring big ships there , the sea gets polluted heavily . 
  this also kills the local production of fish and seashells . 
  all in all , the cost of building a port would be measured in billions , and it would never be returned , especially because : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/port_of_plo\u010de * in 1996 , croatia and the federation of bosnia and herzegovina signed the plo\u010de agreement , regulating unhindered passage of goods between bosnia and herzegovina and the port of plo\u010de and stipulating that such cargo should be duty-free . 
  * plo\u010de is built , has roads , has railroads , is closer . 
  have a look around - you 're likely to see fresh flowers starting to blossom . 
  i 'm seeing daisies and dandelions . 
  this winter is seriously messed up . 
  i 'm closest to being `` from yugoslavia '' . 
  it does n't exist any more , but it was an idea that tried to transcend nationality , which i find a noble cause that was just a hundred years too late . 
  it seems that way , but he 's still competent and has made it on his own somewhere outside croatia , and made it big . 
  whether he 'll get to use his competence , or just be a puppet for hdz , remains to be seen . 
  maybe this is actually a good choice ... ? 
  he 's not some guy who got insanely rich in the nineties and never worked a day in his life . 
  the whole thing is extremely shady , but for now , i do n't think you can fault the choice ; croatia is a pre-bankrupt mess , and the new pm is head of finances in a company with a bigger budget than croatia . 
  he probably knows what he 's doing , so theoretically , he could do well with croatia . 
  give him a year , if he lasts that long , then judge . 
   vojvodina given to hungary , sand\u017eak given to bosnia , pre\u0161evo to kosovo , ni\u0161 to bulgaria , and ** \u0160umadija and belgrade can throw a party ** . 
  why not give them back to turkey ? 
  my life is now complete . 
  if you 're from the capital : nothing changes . 
  if you 're not from the capital : you move to the capital . 
  your parents go bankrupt giving you money to stay there , and you repay them by postponing your graduation for at least three years . 
  when you do graduate , you return home unemployed at the tender age of 27-28 and your parents still have to support you financially . 
  nothing changes . 
  they were always the construction workers in ex-yu . 
  we all know that only mujo works the cement mixer , while haso is having sexy times with mujo 's fata . 
  what 's the first sign of spring ? 
  a bosniak mixing cement . 
  in a normal country , 100k people would be hitting the streets , but i think everyone in this area is just too lazy to protest . 
  the more things change , the more they stay the same . 
   building of all the area with living scycrapers will have about whole 10 % ( or even 20 % ) more capacity than three-storey buildings . 
  because of all the space you need to make parkings , communications , yards and recreational areas , keep all maintenance , sanitation & fire protection standards . 
  i guess that 's true if things are built according to standards . 
  here in the balkans i 've seen my fair share of recent 5-story buildings built with no green areas to speak of , and while the general code specifies 1 parking space per 1.5 apartments , that 's often like 1 per 3 or even 1 per 5 . 
  the constructor does have to pay a penalty for doing that , but it 's tiny compared to what he earns by selling apartments . 
  if by some miracle there is enough parking space available , and there are green areas , well , the parking is going to get taken over by people from the building that got made on the green area . 
  mind you , this is a new thing ... 50 years ago apartment blocks were constructed for living , not profit , and they had plenty of space . 
  however , even today , those are heavily struggling , because people now have more cars . 
  i used to live in a building that was really cool , but then a fast food joint was built , and a shopping mall nearby , on a field that kids used to play on , and despite the shopping mall having ample parking space by itself , the visitors really liked parking next to the nearby apartment buildings . 
  you 'd either have to park 300m away and take someone else 's spot , or you 'd have to wait for a solid half an hour until you find room on your own building 's parking lot . 
  from a very nice place to live in , the whole thing turned into a very loud shithole with lots of traffic and horrible fast food smell . 
  i like visiting badly-looking establishments , ones that seem undecorated since half a century ago , and frequented by old grumpy people . 
  some will know english , and then it 's just amazing to get to know them as much as a couple of hours and a bottle of booze allows . 
  my dream vacation would last a year , and would n't involve visiting any big cities . 
  well , i meant if you had a proper vacation , with a duration of two + weeks , and if the train took you through some nice areas , like rural france or spain . 
  i agree it would be incredibly stupid to waste time if you could only go away for 3-4 days , but if you had a lot more time to spare ... ? 
  truth be told , i never had short vacations , which is why i never found a need to fly . 
  if i have 14 days , i can spare 2-3-4 for travelling . 
  i prefer trains for the general tranquillity and safety , although going by bus you tend to stop at some tourist traps along the way , such as a national park , or the world 's largest ball of twine , or something else . 
  would you take the train if going on a vacation , even if the ride was `` 16 + hours with 1-2 changes '' ? 
  oh , so you do a lot of work outside sweden ? 
  or you fly a lot between swedish cities ? 
  flying is practical , i guess , but i just ca n't imagine not going by train or bus . 
  my favorite trip was to germany when something happened to the train somewhere in the austrian alps , between villach and salzburg , i think ... we got stuck in a small village for several hours , and it was just so otherworldly gorgeous . 
  and it was the era before the internet and laptops and mobile phones , so there were actual children playing football outside and some of us from the train joined . 
  it 's not that - i use the train or the bus . 
  not a lot of places in europe you ca n't get to in 48 hours or less . 
  why not ? 
  i personally love trains and have always picked them over airplanes and buses where possible . 
  so much stuff to see along the way !, 
  not in general - i was just curious about people from / r/europe  i should edit my post , it sounds stupid . 
  what do you think is the ratio of vacation and work flights ?
