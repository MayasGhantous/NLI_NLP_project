  i 'm curious - where do / r/europe people fly to and why ? 
  i never had the need to fly anywhere ( also i never had the need to pick anyone up from an airport , so i 've never been to any of them ) . 
  is it vacation , work , something else ? 
  edit : added '' / r/europe '' because my post was stupid . 
  and thanks everyone for the replies !, 
  honestly , i never paid any attention to tree toppers . 
  i 'm an atheist and i find this whole holiday thing to be annoying ... 
  so i never actually looked at trees - but somehow i 'd logically expect angels to take 1st place ( well , maybe jesus and angels - why not jesus ? 
  ) , then spires , then maybe stars . 
  wait , people put stars on their trees ... ? 
  stars ? 
   my post with the same content entitled as `` the most dangerous terrorist in europe '' was removed as editorialized if i were a moderator , i 'd have you banned from this subreddit entirely . 
   plus : dramatically reduced fire risk , especially with led spots replacing standard inbuilt spotlights which would get dangerously hot . 
  here 's what i [ wrote ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3obibj/so_we_havent_been_able_to_buy_incandescent_light/cvvte2q ) a couple of months ago :  i bought a 10 $ led bulb for my desk lamp , figured it 'll pay itself off in two years . 
   one day i got up and went to pee . 
  when i came back two minutes later , the room was dark and smelled like burning plastic . 
  the led bulb then caught fire . 
  luckily , i had an old t-shirt nearby that i used to douse the flame while it was still small . 
   i 'll be sticking to incandescents forever , thank you very much . 
   what is that protrusion in the back of the su-34 , between the engines ? 
  it 's a rear-facing radar , probably housing other electronic equipment as well . 
   pushing an alternate solution is also fine , what i 'd say is not fine is just burying your head in the sand but that is hardly something which only ee does , i 'd say it 's a continental epidemic !, 
  an epidemic will happen once people from africa decide to move over to europe - and then we wo n't have a couple of million migrants knocking on our doorstep , but a couple of * hundred * million . 
   we are the victim here . 
  funny - i thought the victims would be all the colonized regions and millions of slaves you had . 
   because grown-up countries do n't invade other countries out of pure malice oh yes , preventing two attempts of genocide in europe would have been malice , indeed . 
  and it was primarily the usa that prevented the third attempt . 
  not germany . 
  i 'm guessing you did n't want to spend money you needed for de-ddrification and lose people in someone else 's war . 
  that 's perfectly fine - but it does n't need excuses . 
  also , parallels can not be drawn between europe and middle east . 
  nations vs. tribes , clay vs. oil , etc. 
   how about you check my other comment where i say that i agree with ee refusing to take refugees ? 
  you never said that . 
  the closest you came to saying it was `` it 's fucking impossible to bully , bribe and force countries into committing what they perceive as suicide '' . 
  that 's just stating a fact , not your opinion ... 
   again , the single only idea i can think of to prevent your wars would be `` invade belgrade , force the serbian elected official to grant independence to other states '' . 
  so why did n't you do it ? 
  end result was over 100.000 dead , over 300.000 wounded , over 4.000.000 permanently or temporarily displaced , over 300.000 housing objects destroyed or heavily damaged , 750.000.000.000 $ direct or indirect financial damage . 
   because tbh i do n't feel any gram of responsibility about your separatist wars . 
  and i do n't feel any responsibility about your ideas that we should severely financially hurt ourselves by taking in a lot of migrants who do n't want to be here anyway . 
  you want them ? 
  you take them . 
  you do n't want them ? 
  then ship them back to where they came from - but not here . 
  unless you give all of us 750 billion euros , and at least a fifth that much to neighbouring non-yu countries which would also have vastly benefited financially . 
  do you have a trillion euros to spare ? 
   yes . 
  now go ahead and tell what my government should have done ( nevermind we were melting two countries in one ) in 1991 to stop the wars . 
  invade belgrade to force you to grant independence to the yugoslavian states ? 
  no , you tell me . 
  you 're all about `` solidarity '' , not me . 
  i find it funny that you just said `` we were having issues of our own , melting ddr with brd '' and not acknowledging that eastern europe countries did not have their `` brds '' and had to de-ddrify themselves . 
   ah yes , made some good cash from the eastern european bank i own . 
  i 'm going to use romania for this example  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_banks_in_romania top 10 banks : bcr : 16.2 % -- ** erste , austria ** brd : 12.4 % -- ** soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale , france ** banca transilvania : 9.8 % -- this one is local , yay !, 
  raiffeissen : 7.9 % -- ** switzerland ** unicredit tiriac : 7.9 % -- ** italy ** cec bank : 7.7 % -- ** credit europe , netherlands ** ing : 5.1 % -- ** netherlands ** alpha bank : 4.6 % -- greece , kind of an outlier here volksbank : 3.4 % -- ** germany ** bancpost : 3.1 % -- greece again guess where all the profits go !, 
  and if you visit the link above , have a look at local dissolved and bankrupt banks - they did n't go bankrupt on their own , you know ... 
   what war could be stopped in 1991 ? 
  are you serious ? 
   if one nation is poor but has lots of space then perhaps some sort of agreement can be made where one of the richer countries pays for the costs or some such . 
  that ca n't work , because it would create a ghetto . 
  not once in the history of mankind was a ghetto proved to be beneficial to anyone . 
  gdp per capita is also very misleading , because it fails to take into account things such as basic infrastructure . 
  you can have two countries with n gdp per capita , but one could realistically be doing a lot better than the other because it has a network of roads and railroads , its hospitals are n't in the running for greatest collection of mold world record , and everyone living in the country 's capital has running water and sewage . 
  if you truly cared about solidarity and the well-being of people in the balkans , you would have stopped the wars all the way back in 1991 . 
  but you did n't . 
  you stood there and waited while over a hundred thousand people died , you waited until the economies of the countries involved were ruined , and then you bought everything that could be bought - phone operators , banks , power distribution , etc. 
  that 's a very nice display of solidarity , it sure is !, 
  op seems to think that eastern europe is a place of vast richness and the ability to easily house and feed millions of migrants . 
  well it 's not . 
  if you can financially take care of the migrants - please do . 
  we ca n't , unless you want us to go bankrupt . 
  and then you will have wars and dead people . 
  did you , or anyone from your family , ever get up at 2-3 am to go stand in line for bread , with no guarantee you 'll be able to get it ? 
  did you think you literally owned the world if you got a banana and an orange for your birthday , because those were extremely exotic and expensive fruits ? 
  a kiwi ?!, 
  holy fuck , what is that shit -- it 's fruit with hair ?!?!?!, 
  did you ever have to wash dishes with river sand , because there were no detergents available ? 
  did you trade a whole live pig for a pair of badly-fitting jeans somehow smuggled from italy or greece ? 
  did you own black & white tvs until the mid-nineties , because tvs with color were too expensive ? 
  edit : and you could n't watch tv every other day because of power reductions ? 
  did you ever own a banknote with `` 500,000,000,000 '' printed on it , and it was entirely , completely , utterly worthless ? 
  did you have a member of your family disappear in the middle of the night because they somehow insulted the regime and nobody was allowed to talk about it ? 
  well then , stop complaining about istern yurop . 
  the whole project is a scam , and i fully expect jail time for many people in a decade or two , unless they take the money and disappear from public view . 
  the contracts are shady , the financing is shady , the plans and deadlines are shady . 
  this will end up as a giant shopping mall , a few residential buildings with atrocious view , and nothing more than that . 
   bosnian forensic experts have started exhuming the human remains from a recently uncovered mass grave believed to contain victims of the 1995 srebrenica massacre , the war crime prosecutor 's office said wednesday . 
   `` so far remains of at least 15 victims have been recovered , '' the prosecutor said in a statement . 
   the mass grave was uncovered at kozluk , a village some 70 kilometres ( 40 miles ) north of srebrenica . 
  ...  the site of the newly uncovered mass grave was unveiled by a bosnian serb , witness of the atrocities , munira subasic , president of an association of srebrenica victims ' families , told afp . 
   `` this man came to talk to me in a small restaurant in kozluk . 
  he told me ' i should tell you something . 
  there is a mass grave nearby . 
  i ca n't sleep of guilty conscience ' , '' subasic said . 
  ...  hundreds of other victims of this massacre have been found in mass graves in other places . 
   the srebrenica massacre has been acknowledged as genocide by two international courts . 
   we know what happened only people in serbia know the truth , and everything else is cia and vatican propaganda . 
  / s it 's been over quarter of a century since the 1999 nato intervention , and serbia still refuses to publish its list of victims . 
  why ?
