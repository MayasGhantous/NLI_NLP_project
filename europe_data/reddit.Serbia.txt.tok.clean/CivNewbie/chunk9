  because according to the media , there have been `` thousands '' of civilian casualties , and a third of those were children . 
  publishing the exact numbers would be dangerous to the regime , so my guess is that the list will be published about 50 years from now , with made-up names and locations nobody would recognize then . 
  every year all the media publishes an insane list of numbers - aircraft involved , bombs dropped in quantity and mass , etc. 
  every year the numbers come out in such a way that it turns out every airplane carried and released 20 tons of bombs . 
  every year there 's particular mention of a child , milica raki\u0107 , dead at the age of 3 , as the symbol of horrible nato aggression . 
  none of the media dares say that the poor child died from a serbian 20mm aa gun shooting at something it would never be able to hit . 
  go away and eat your smelly surstr\u00f6mming . 
  swedes and norwegians are the only ones capable of eating chemical weapons of mass destruction . 
   i just finished watching a 6 part bbc documentary on yugoslavia . 
  and good gods !, 
  now imagine things that happened that * were n't * part of that documentary . 
  for example , in b&h , there have been cases of even tanks being borrowed . 
  like , sides a , b and c were all fighting each other , but a and c , and b and c had a ceasefire , so a went to c to borrow a couple of tanks to help in the fight of a vs. b. 
  the tanks would be returned in a few days , and in a month , a and c would be fighting again . 
  except when it was time to establish a short cease-fire so that the political mafia could safely deliver smuggled cisterns of petrol to the opposing side . 
  when is the final judgement due ? 
  the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia established quite clearly that there was no attempt ( or `` joint criminal enterprise '' as they called it ) by croatia , at any point in the war , to annex parts of bosnia or any other country in it 's surroundings . 
  what 's this ? 
  it 's ** exactly the opposite ** of what you just said !, 
  as you can see , the icty clearly said that there * was * a joint criminal enterprise , that there * was * an attempt to annex a part of b&h , and that it * was * an international armed conflict !, 
  probably just retaliation in general . 
  people here like to retaliate , it 's daily business . 
  mostar was a huge mess all in all . 
  have a look at this part from wikipedia :  between 1992 and 1993 , after bosnia and herzegovina declared independence from yugoslavia , the town was subject to an 18-month siege . 
  the yugoslav people 's army ( jna ) first bombed mostar on 3 april 1992 , and over the following week gradually established control over a large part of the town . 
  by 12 june 1992 the army of republic of bosnia and hercegovina , formed in 1992 arbih and croatian defence council ( hvo ) in a joint action forced the jna out of mostar . 
  no , that 's the same shit as perpetuated here . 
  croatia performed an act of aggression on bosnia & herzegovina , with the purpose of creating a greater croatia . 
  denial of that fact is equal to denial of the fact that serbia performed an act of aggression on croatia and b&h , with the purpose of creating a greater serbia . 
   not true . 
  very true . 
  unless you want to say that serbian paramilitaries in croatia and bosnia had nothing to do with serbia . 
  or is that ... * different * ? 
  that 's ... interesting . 
  rifles , okay . 
  grenades , okay . 
  but land mines ... ? 
   -25 c in croatia ?!, 
  damn . 
  i just googled and found this : croatia : -34.6 c in 2003 . http://klima.hr/razno.php?id=priopcenja&amp;param=apsolutno_najniza serbia : -39 c in 2006 . http://www.hidmet.gov.rs/latin/meteorologija/klimatologija_temp_rezim.php bosnia & herzegovina : -43.5 c in 1963 . http://www.fzs.ba/bihb/temperipad.htm slovenia : -49.1 c in 2009 . http://www.cipra.org/sl/novice/3375 ( sorry for `` bad '' link , ca n't find anything from a government agency ), 
  every day ? 
  but even if that 's the case - again , why give a gun for free ? 
  give the people 1000 $ for a gun , 2000 $ for a rifle , and then you 'll see bigger improvements . 
   while a kalashnikov can cost between 300 and 500 euros ( $ 325-540 ) in the balkans , the price goes up to 2,000 euros in some countries . 
  ok , so that 's easy to fix - gib moneyz to the countries here , and then buy weapons from people who have them , without criminal prosecution for illegal firearms ownership . 
  occasionally there 's a `` bring your gun freely to the police '' day everywhere , and the police does collect some guns and ammo for free ... 
  but if those guns could be sold , then they 'd collect a lot more . 
  as it stands , nobody will want to voluntarily get rid of their assault rifle - who knows when it might come in handy ... 
  yes , \u0160vedska , with a capital \u0161 , 
  looks like a reaper from mass effect is having some sexy times with a poor unsuspecting building . 
  that 's [ somewhat doubtful ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naftna_industrija_srbije ) . 
  [ donations to serbia , 2000-2013 ] ( http://www.blic.rs/data/images/2014-12-02/545012_05_ff.jpg ) the graph on top is millions of $ . 
  the circled stuff is billions of $ . 
  the graph below is a poll , who the people think the biggest donations come from . 
  unfortunately , the only one who has a problem with history here is you . 
  1st war : serbia attacked slovenia 2nd war : serbia attacked croatia 3rd war : serbia attacked bosnia & herzegovina 4th war : serbia attacked kosovo as far as nato 's humanitarian intervention goes ( started due to a second historical genocide over native albanians , hence a defensive action for mankind as a whole ) , this entire region of the balkans would have been in a much , much better state had nato properly intervened in 1991 . instead of 1999 , which was 8 years , ~ 130.000 dead , ~ 350.000 wounded , ~ 4.000.000 permanently or temporarily displaced , ~ 500-750 billion $ damage in all countries involved ( directly or indirectly ) , too late . 
  if you 're going to hate on nato , hate them because they sat on their asses for too long . 
  the countries here are demilitarized - again , thanks to nato - to the extent of another war breaking out being extremely unlikely , as there are basically no more weapons to wage war with . 
  and that is a very , very good thing . 
  it 's not absurd . 
  in the timespan of less than a decade , serbia started four wars . 
  nato is here to make sure a fifth does n't happen . 
   thanks , but is it satire , to mock putin or are they more serious in their devotion to putin in ?!, 
  deadly serious . 
  nato is providing security to serbia 's neighbours , from serbia . 
   these were little kids man . 
  4-7 years old . 
  according to / r/europe , those are future terrorists . 
  * 0 points ( 19 % upvoted ) * yeah ... do n't post things like this over here . 
  yeah , i should have put a + sign between rednecks and slaves ; this way it looks like i put them in the appalachians . 
  [ this should be mostly correct ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qynzufw.png ), 
  i 'm very displeased with myself for even visiting buzzfeed in the first place , but i had to check the exact date , because i know i saw those pictures a couple of years ago ... 
  from the buzzfeed article this links to ( and steals content ) : ** posted on nov. 27 , 2013 , at 12:41 a.m. **, 
  a bomb or two explode on the coastline , and next year gdp drops down by 5 % . 
  fragile stuff . 
  someone needs to mod this into a europa universalis iv map . 
  that 's not what the article says  also , i think what turkey did is directly against nato rules of engagement . 
  i 'll see if i can dig up a link if you 're interested . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18584872 * 26 june 2012 * * turkey says its military rules of engagement have changed after syria shot down a turkish plane that reportedly strayed into its territory . 
  * * mr erdogan spoke of turkey 's `` rage '' at the decision to shoot down the f-4 phantom on 22 june and described syria as a `` clear and present threat '' . 
  * ** `` a short-term border violation can never be a pretext for an attack , '' he said ** . 
  * the turkish jet was on a training flight , testing turkey 's radars in the eastern mediterranean , he said . 
  let 's assume today 's scenario again . 
  russian aircraft shortly enter turkish airspace , are shot down from turkish territory . 
  russia says `` nyet ! '', 
  and shoots them down inside turkish airspace . 
  what happens then ? 
  yeah , but again - erdogan is crazy . 
  who else would have shot a russian plane down for a 10-second airspace violation ? 
  do n't underestimate erdogan . 
  he 's crazy , and has a very strong military to back him up . 
  if that cruiser does anything to turkish aircraft inside turkish borders , it 's going down , and then the world is in for a lot of fun . 
  putin seems to have forgotten that turkey is n't ukraine . 
  i think we 're going to see a sunk missile cruiser very soon . 
  i guess so . 
  the pattern of propaganda was the same in all scenarios . 
  goebbels would have been very proud of serbia in the nineties . 
  wars are won by ground troops , and if you send those somewhere - they tend to die . 
  it 's kinda hard to justify your citizens dying in a war that is n't technically your problem . 
  this is why nobody wants to send 50k trained soldiers ( that would be more than enough ) to syria and iraq to get rid of daesh .
