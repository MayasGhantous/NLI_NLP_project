what a hottie < 3, 
  it is / r/europe not / r/europeanunion, 
  we 're not part of the western circlejerk , sorry . 
  what, 
  why would anyone want stay with the failed state that ukraine is ? 
  there 's this too http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_serbia_ ( historical_province ), 
  what crisis in crimea ? 
  are n't the crimeans getting what they want ? 
  let 's do it boys !, 
  how is it different if crimea belongs to ukraine or russia ? 
  russia is in even better state than ukraine so it might even benefit them . 
  how is ukraine their native soil ? 
  wtf, 
  what a despicable thing to say . 
  tell that to the people in the region that has record high rates of leukemia . 
  seriously lol, 
  why is that hard to believe ? 
  is n't poland part of nato that `` legitimely '' bombed civilian facilities in kosovo with depleted uranium ? 
  thank you for telling us your story . 
  i wont even read this but would n't the sensible thing be to educate/guide their governments and not snatch any peeps that are worth something ? 
  i love people oversimplifying conflicts like this . 
  anyway it is not anything recent that we are allies with greeks . 
  both our countries had common enemies for quite a lot in the past . 
  in the last 100 years we fought the turks with the balkan league allience , and later fascism versus the nazis . 
  that 's a great link !, 
  i am so annoyed by / r/europe 's coverage of * anything * actually . 
  just so negative ... like there is nothing to be happy about :( also the word shithole has lost meaning to me, 
  just read this wiki page : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nika_riots#background byzantium4lyfe, 
  this is the main reason i decided to share these pictures lol . 
  look for his twitter , there is some selfies taken which i didnt include . 
  yeah !, 
  it 's not doom and gloom as this subreddit would love to suggest . 
  credit to / u/sirscoots twitter . 
  we 're actually quite multi culti which people do n't really recognise . 
  though we are mostly mono cultural which is obvious as serbian culture best . 
  nothing, 
  which is irrelevant to the discussion . 
  yes , and does n't the soc belong to both montenegrins and serbs ? 
  this is rage worthy . 
  i ca n't wait to see the videos !, 
  this is only annoying russians , also their media is gon na spin it endlessly . 
  i was looking for a friendly recommendation not for a pr description . 
  short synopsis ? 
  i have it downloaded but i have no idea what is it about, 
  vucic admitted the other day how the government killed a journalist back when his party was in power . 
  lazy ass cunts, 
  sochi will host the arena games and the mountain range near by will host ski related sports or whatever . 
  fucking / r/europe , they will look at anything to bitch on russia . 
  they are doing all the right things now though . 
  fuck off balts . 
  dayum and i thought greece is different than the rest ot balkans . 
  outside of ee & russia pr *, 
  thanks for giving us this write-up !, 
  good to have some insight from your pov . 
  always felt ee and russia in general are abysmal at pr . 
  autonomy does n't mean it 's not a part of serbia afaik . 
  kosovo does have autonomy, 
  is n't serbia in a better condition to join than bulgaria & romania were ? 
  priest are just glorified people , they are no different than you and me . 
  you are frustrated because `` atheists '' are not represented in the social/political infrastructure while i can see religious institutions lasting more thousands of years . 
  exactly lol . 
  what a piss of an article . 
  i do n't think there 's any other entity that knows the people better than the church , for us orthodox christians at least . 
  do n't the priests visit each family before their yearly festivities ? 
  and are n't they probably the people that chats to the public the most ? 
  if politicians are dependent on the church officials , i 'm glad it 's them . 
  the church usually represents the people , what did the church do wrong ? 
  prolly a cunt, 
  it prolly is , though india is on the flavor of the month kind of thing, 
  why are people surprised when shit happens in a 1b + population country ? 
  euronews can suck dick, 
  is it int that started this meme ? 
  well i remember it being posted by the japanese anon specifically for the exyu general  it 's unique !, 
  what are you interested in ? 
  it is pretty dispersed . 
  that 's the funny part of chanboards , it forces you to save interesting posts/pics . 
  yeah , it is common there also with latin/middle east variations . 
  i felt that the artwork was amazing and deserved to be seen by more people . 
  [ the pokedex picture ] ( http://imgur.com/4or2bim ), 
  meh that 's a bit ignorant , i think most of ee likes to bitch a lot and not bother change anything, 
  i think laibach is quite niche except maybe in slovenia . 
  i might be wrong tho, 
  meh , most of us do n't give a fuck about it , though we are ignorant . 
  why is always a lithanian shitposting this stuff . 
  what do you have against balkan music ? 
  ( our greatest regional export ), 
  this [ clip ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbgkg0zwzpa ) from a cult movie in serbia explains a lot . 
  basically loud , passionate about football people that spend their time in taverns . 
  exotic brazil in europe :3, 
  that 's what people said 1914 too !, 
  i do see similarities but i posted this primarily for a discussion, 
  i think so , but i am not really informed on it . 
  apparently [ 39 % ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society.php?yyyy=2013&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=10&amp;nav_id=86102 ) are for in a poll done this year . 
  the original division came in the beginning of ww2 with the communist ideology . 
  [ yugoslav partisans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partisans_\\ ( yugoslavia \\ ) ) vs [ chetniks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chetniks ) . 
  i know my moms village is pro-partisans while the neighboring village is pro-chetniks lol . 
  i like the sound of it and there have been movements for it in the past but it is/was really divisive . 
  also theres the scandal that the heir does n't know serbian kek, 
  you got ta admit we have a better score in treating them than the west, 
  i always felt that way too .
