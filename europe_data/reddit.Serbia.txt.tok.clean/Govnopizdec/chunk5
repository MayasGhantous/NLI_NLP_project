  he was n't beaten because he was gay , he was beaten because he was mean to the cleaning lady and for being german `` ovde si dosao da mi se kurcis '' . 
  also he was punched only once . 
  he was serbian , not the serb . 
  edit : so kebab wahhabi is right, 
  generally we see them as a threat but as long as they do n't attack serbs it 's none of our problem . 
  bosniak politicians ( they have problems with them ) are trying hard to push laws that will ban fighting in other countries but serb politicians mostly blocked that because they saw that as a conflict between usa and extreme islam ( let 's be honest , our politicians would lose support big if some guy with beard exploded together with serb children ) . 
  now the pressure from the usa pushed us into conflict too , they started pressuring serbia after some serbian attacked us embassy in bosnia . 
  [ today us ambassador said that there will be no threat of terrorism if we joined in campaign against extreme islam ] ( http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_category=12&amp;nav_id=903976 ), 
  i am not sure about bosnia but i know about situation in kosovo and serbia . 
  no they wo n't , if anyone starts cleansing bosniaks i swear that i will shot at them , they will have raska serbs together with bosniaks fighting against northern serbs . 
  [ both ex-yugoslavs and scandinavians are part of the genetically old-europe ( were/are among the first europeans ) ] ( http://www.arslanmb.org/armeniandnaproject/movements-of-haplogroup-i.jpg ), 
  it has a lot to do with genetics too . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavs#genetics no it has n't . 
  slavs are distinct , south slavs are genetically much different from other slavs . 
  scandinavians are the descendants of the south slavs yet our cultures are not even close . 
  all of them . 
  but they are just mountainous serbia ( that was almost always independent from serbia but it 's still the same shit ) , or maybe we are just hilly montenegro, 
  serbia is not located in europe but in africa, 
  bosnia, 
  puppet government is not the same as our government that joined nazis , one is a government that only 2 % of people loved which exterminated serbs the other one would have serbian and nazi soldiers pushing together on the fronts , for the irony to be bigger we had a guarantee from the nazis that yugoslavia would stay neutral if we only moved nazi soldier through our land but we had to do that typical idiotic balkan thing and say `` fuck you nazis !, 
  and then we all ended in the grob . 
  i say that the biggest mistake we ever made was that we did n't join nazi germany on it 's conquest , it fucked us so much that we will never become a normal country . 
  yes , because fuck serbia , i want to be muslim !, 
  gay, 
  ok , i saw , [ here is the explanation ] ( http://www.dw.de/da-li-%c5%a1kotski-referendum-uti%c4%8de-na-balkan/a-17932941 ) . 
  there is a button translate near the bookmark if you use chrome . 
  why is there no republika srpska ? 
  none of my business , and i am not afraid of russia . 
  can you post the link to the original article ? 
  only civilization can destruct nature and there would be never civilization in the balkans , we will always be cave dwelling giants . 
  there is nothing free today my friend , of course it 's payed . 
  floods damaged our plants so that 's why we started importing electricity . 
  rs wants to go out of bosnia and the ones who want it are the serbian majority in the rs , what 's there to explain ? 
  oh , now we gon na listen how muslim people from sandzak are actually nice , they do n't snort cocaine , drink and do n't gamble . 
  they never killed anyone . 
  maybe not in the 90s but how do you know that they together with germans did n't ethnically cleanse my grandfather ? 
  your post is pure whataboutism , so i gon na answer it simply with idiocy , if your females gave their pussies more we would n't be in this situation where we kill each other . 
  serbian majority from rs does n't want to be in the same non-functional country with bosnia , that 's all there is to say . 
  pre ww2 ethnic structure of the bosnia was different from the one after ww2 and by punished i do n't really mean punishing someone by killing him but bosnia pretty much avoided any responsibility for ww2 and only bosnian nazi divisions were punished which is not bad either . 
  bosnia came into being country because of removal of serbs , if the killings did n't happen then the minority would n't win in voting against serbs who were majority . 
  i stay with that the serbs in the 90s were murderers and that the people from rs got it through murdering but modern bosnia also came into existence through genocide . 
   world is trying to learn from their mistakes not really , genocide will always pass , if it was n't true then bosnia would be together with serbia or the borders would be much different and smaller . 
  muslims who were a minority before ww2 were n't really punished for removing the serbian pre-ww2 majority in bosnia . 
  post ww2 bosnia was created on the ethnic cleansing too by removing the serb majority . 
  edit : added `` too '', 
  cry me a river , i do n't give a fuck about presevo and sandzak , they can go if they want but rs is moving out of bosnia too !, 
  the borders were first moved in the ww2 after the serbian ethnic majority was killed and ethnically cleansed . 
  nobody gives a fuck if sandzak goes or even presevo . 
  i as a serb being minority in sandzak ( sjenica ) am ok with it going to bosnia if rs goes to serbia, 
  i imagine his wife now buying guns and equipment , she 's serb . 
  or maybe they are just dicks and dislike usa ? 
  [ serbs tried to defend him , two guys even got in the fight with the 3 retards that got into conflict with him ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leeqr8egwc4 ), 
  [ here is a video with fight ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leeqr8egwc4 ) edit : some faggot just punched the german from the back and the guy standing beside him just jumped to beat the guy who punched that german while others tried to help the german guy lying on the ground which is an unusual thing to see here , i did n't thought that people will defend him . 
  actually the number of believers in serbia is falling by a big number . 
  it 's ironic because the ones/one who have beaten that german guy probably thought of him as the barbaric invader . 
  according to german ambassador and police the one who was beating him shouted that he does n't want strangers in serbia . 
  according to reports he was n't beaten because of being queer but because he was stranger which is even more alarming thing . 
  what country are you from ? 
  it does n't , it 's typical for people living abroad to not know the cities and regions in ex-yu . 
  do n't worry neither do big part of serbs in serbia know . 
  how old are you and do you live abroad ? 
  [ from those territories serbs emigrated to the balkans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_serbia ), 
  yes , there are bunch of gays we need to kill !, 
  however , the world could do without danes imho . 
  it 's hard to see what denmark has ever done for the world , for minorities , for human dignity . 
  you can come to serbia , we have goulash . 
  ok , i did n't really expect that ... what 's next world war 3 and russia winning ? 
  i did n't say that it was western propaganda, 
  that sounds idiotic . 
  crimea would have probably been independent even if the whole referendum was completely legal . 
  crimea was already under ( what i would call ) `` constitutional repression '' by the ukraine so you could easily see that they were never in acceptance of ukraine as their homeland . 
  number of serbs there is simply huge for anything drastic even if srebrenica did n't happen the ratio would n't be of favour to bosniaks . 
  solution is not that simple . 
  but even bosniaks forget that serbs were the majority in bosnia before 450 000 of them ended up as soap or pile of bones so in one way the today 's bosnia came through the genocide also . 
  the country is simply broken beyond repair . 
  why would the rest of the bh go to croatia , there is only about 7 % to 14 % of croats in bosnia . 
  there is about 33 % to 37 % of serbs btw . 
  bosniaks about 45 to 48 % edit : not to sound that croatians are forbidden to secede , just that there are also bosniaks who are majority in bosnia, 
  i would n't choose war but let 's be honest , secession leads to war and union leads to war too . 
  only the status quo is possible with fbih and rs without touching any dayton parts but that thing is simply non-functional and it will collapse ( one positive thing could be that fbih gets bored and lets rs go or maybe even something strange happens and they become union but highly unlikely ) because there is a big push by the usa and eu countries for the union . 
  i know but the country went beyond repair , every solution leads to war . 
  union also sounds idiotic , i doubt serbs will accept it and i doubt bosniaks want serbs . 
  it would create instability of nations in the world . 
   and it does in fact seem to be one that has been discussed behind closed doors as part of the ongoing kosovo settlement negotiations . 
  highly unlikely , especially after the us officials explicitly told that they wo n't let any region swapping and even told dacic to stop thinking about that . 
  germans ( yes , german oebs , not serbia ) even rewrote the number of albanians there to 1000 , so now by stats we only have 1000 albanians, 
  too much work , there are much better options . 
  why , what are we supposed to do with territory that has albanian majority ? 
  i think that one is old , looks too red . 
  edit : [ here is one more up to date ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_recognition_of_kosovo#mediaviewer/file:countriesrecognizingkosovo.png ) , muslim countries are generally favorable of kosovo independence , the ones on your map were too red . 
  i support it . 
  i also support secession of rs . 
  there is nothing worse than being an ally of the britain . 
  they bombed whole belgrade , destroyed it down to the ground just to kill 20 german soldiers . 
  we do n't want to join the eu !!!, 
  our ruling party does n't respect the program they showed in the elections and broke almost everything written in it !, 
  you can count the number of serbs fighting in the ukraine on the fingers , this sensationalism about chetniks is boring . 
  is it so important what 5 totally unimportant persons did ? 
  that 's what i am saying also .
