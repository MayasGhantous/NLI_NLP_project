  if usa consisted of only russians , average iq in the usa would have 1 more digit . 
  innocent bosnian muslim civilians do n't exist , if they were n't killing serbs , serbs would have not killed them ( ah , i feel the ^ ^ o. 
  storm is coming ) . 
  especially april 14th , such a brave country usa is !, 
   are there lots of toxic waste dumps leaking into the water in serbia ? 
  probably depleted uranium . 
  \u0160ta je to antievropsko , antiukrajinsko i antidemokratsko u zahtevu da se ukrajina federalizuje ? 
  shhhhhhhhh ... ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ diversion, 
  well , there is only one way to find out . 
  i 'll give you my ak , cover you up and you start shooting at the us embassy . 
   i mean this isnt bloddy red alert 2 where a machine gun can blow up a building if you shoot long enough at it . 
  are you sure ? 
  oh , then ok . have n't really read the text , just saw mevlid on the pictures and some sentence about him attacking embassy . 
  yes , he is serbian ( srbijanac ) , he was taken down by the american sniperist in bosnia . 
  edit : pictures do n't show emrah fojnica but mevlid which is a guy from serbia which was shot , this guy was one of his accomplices , and that guy is from bosnia , the text is about him . 
  mevlid , i feel sad for the guy . 
  he is srbijanac btw . 
  not bosnian . 
  edit : srbijanac - serbian on english, 
  it does n't really break any law , it should pass ( actually there is bigger probability for it not to pass because eu is trying hard not to alienate serbia but that 's a big play with the democracy ) if they go through the european court for human rights in strasbourg . 
  some vojvodjani have tendency to act like djordje cvarkov irl , they really bored me to death . 
  sljivovica - drink of the ancient gods , whoever tried that drink got the power to go against whole nato with only one spear 2 . 
  serbs - these primitive animals inhabit places from ibar and timok in the south-east to karlobag-ogulin-karlovac-virovitica in the north-west ( ok , not really , human species which were inhabiting country that was the peak of civilization in the whole world with 1000 years old history the famous croatia removed them all ) . 
  there are more species of serbs , one famous species is montanius balcanicus from which all the species of serbs came , they are known by square heads , can grow so big that even dutch of human origins are midgets compared to them ( see [ slavko vranes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavko_vrane%c5%a1 ) ) , they usually inhabit western and central parts of serbia , whole montenegro and half of bosnia which they share with similar species called bosniaks ( overall they are similar and the only difference is the barking which is isus for the serbs and alah for the bosniaks ) . 
  now there are domesticated version of serbs like panonicus-not-balcanicus , these serbs believe ( which is of course bullshit ) that they do n't have square heads and are more round like russians , poles , generally slavs which they hate because slavs are not liberal . 
  panonicus-not-balcanicus is also known for eating kulen and having less gay tendencies than their violent mountainous not domesticated kind ( example : they are using `` jebem ti majku ! '', 
  instead of `` jebem ti oca ! '' ) . 
  race that experienced mass migration ( in folk tales known as the `` traktorijada '' ) is the famous race ultra-serbicus-not-believing-serbia that lived in the territories of croatia and scientists believe that they are exiled in around 1995 a.d. . that race was known for not listening to the pack and was always doing things it 's own way . 
  sumarice - mass grave and monument dedicated to the german reprisals , they took children from all the schools in kragujevac and executed them . 
  ^ do n't ^ speak ^ about ^ this ^ we ^ ^ can ^ ^ organize ^ ^ some ^ ^ rent ^ ^ an ^ ^ organ , ^ ^ serbian ^ ^ primates ^ ^ have ^ ^ really ^ ^ good ^ ^ organs 4 . 
  muzej vazduhoplovstva - they have awesome stuff like f-117 5 . 
  hladnjace - frozen albanians , among the only saved examples of these primitive species are kept there ( there is also this mythical country albania where they are supposed to live ) 6 . 
  german & serbian ww1 mass graves - some retard thought that burying savages with germans is good idea , we are sorry for that , we will punish that retard and send apology to germany , no one should equalize humans and animals . 
  cele kula - tower made by the turks from skulls of the dead serbs,

  what 's there to like about croats , and we only like savages . 
  sta da se radi , nestalo nam salate . 
  [ through the mosquito net ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/94751781.jpg ), 
  except that we already did that and russia warned us that they will also sanction us if we continue with that bad practice . 
  they gave us a yellow card ( second one , lol ) , and offered free help for the quality control . 
  nobody needs to know about our little secret , delete the post . 
   that must be a terrible burden to bear . 
  not really, 
   not being feminized is forbidden in sweden . 
  i was just kidding about this , you know , swedish stereotypes . 
   there was some guy who sued swedish pd over this and he won . 
  i read about [ this guy ] ( http://blogmuscle.wordpress.com/2007/08/13/sweden-man-arrested-for-having-big-muscles/ ) in some serbian newspaper , ca n't find the source now . 
  here in serbia almost nothing survived , only the mountain towns survived and they look really nice . 
  almost everything from the roman era was destroyed by the wars on the balkans and later by the serbs , turks and germans . 
  a lot of the ottoman architecture was left here ( even through we are savages we do appreciate turks and we left a lot of mosques and their buildings , we did however ethnically cleanse them all ) . 
  there are some churches that were left but any other byzantine building ( i am speaking about neo-byzantine buildings , the ones that were built by the serbs in the 20th century ) that was not the church was burnt/razed down by the germans . 
  not being feminized is forbidden in sweden . 
  there was some guy who sued swedish pd over this and he won . 
  i 'd say there would be dead race between albania and croatia . 
  people in the south would probably say croatia and people in the north would probably say albania . 
  please mr. vucic , spare my life , i will be good . 
  because they are hated by every neighbor . 
  dekebabization, 
  we are sky people ( nebeski narod ) , you 'd need to get into space to beat us .

  serbia , albania and hungary are like the ultimate evils on the balkans , every neighbor hates them . 
  edit : hungary is not on balkan but you get the point, 
   least favourite : haha , take a guess . 
  hint : they 're into kebab removal services . 
  and they reaaally like our country . 
  so much they tried to make it their own  anything less and we 'd be disappointed . 
  it would mean that we do n't do our job quiet well . 
  i think i see the similarities : * hungary : hard-core nazis ... ... ... . generally ok but in the case of the world war should be kept an open eye on them * croatia : hard-core nazis * bosnia : hard-core nazis * montenegro : criminals * kosovo/albania : criminals & soft-core nazis * macedonia : they like nato dicks * bulgaria : soft-core nazis ... ... ... ... generally ok but in the case of the world war should be kept an open eye on them * romania : soft-core nazis & our allies which never attacked us, 
  generally speaking as a country the only ones who we can trust are romanians ( maybe ) . 
  and i am speaking about countries , not about their populations , why should i care if someone loves or hates croats , macedonians , algerians or anyone else . 
  least favorite : everyone most favorite : none, 
  he had more chance to survive in the army than with the civilian population . 
  ww2 was even worse , for example `` partisan artillery '' was mostly made of young boys , we always fought for the total exterminations here on the balkans , it was always either them or us . 
  well , maybe . 
  oh , c'mon it 's not like serbia is some important ally ... slovenia , croatia , albania are together worth more than one serbia which never belonged to the west or east . 
  usa would have got involved no matter what , then the russia , eu and un only listened to what usa had to say . 
  if you have chosen serbia instead of them there would be slight bad feeling towards usa ( not really enemies ) . 
  but still now you have more allies , it 's better . 
  no , they do n't, 
  having 4 enemies , 2 of them muslims is far more worse than that . 
  not to say that yugoslavia even when it was made simply could n't function and there would have been endless wars ( also the reason why italia , france and russia were proposing ethnic cleansing instead of making yugoslavia in the 1915 ) edit : and the most important thing , serbs did all kinds of shit, 
  but intervention was a good idea .

  i do n't think eu really wants to integrate serbia, 
  to help you i 'm gon na buy finnish vodka , and cheers , thanks for making us richer . 
  it would be better but we do n't like making sandzak terrorists mad and we do n't want unknown source to arm them either so it 's better for us to join the eu . 
  serbia , we really love americans . 
  small number of measured people in this research , about 5 to 20 persons per country . 
  wrote the sentence wrong , fixed it . 
  if we sanctioned russia we would get bankrupt and eu would use that argument to push us further away from itself . 
  edit : wrote the sentence wrong . 
  serbian exports are going to get bigger . 
  cool , our export will grow bigger, 
  time for our export to get bigger, 
  hail started falling hard and the storm did n't even come , looks like it is going bigger , cops are warning tourists to evacuate . 
  the people in western serbia that got flooded homes but were not hit by the landslides , hail , got blocked by the flooded neighbors canal or are handicapped deserve what happened to them . 
  no such thing , just wars , wars and more wars . 
  they probably meant this [ eyesburn song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w47i-3ui_oe ) or maybe [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmb0gp2k3sc ),
