aliens come and explain to us how retarded we are and then they lead us into age of prosperity ? 
  ^ i ^ can ^ hope, 
  awesome !, 
  anyone from warsaw know 's where is this street today ? 
  i 'd like to see modern day comparison . 
  and he looks like he is in early 30s . 
  dracula confirmed ( o , . . , o ) also , [ wtf ] ( https://www.google.fi/search?q=alexander+stubb&amp;es_sm=91&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=-d5xvit4njpaavcigkad&amp;ved=0cagq_auoaq&amp;biw=1465&amp;bih=911#tbm=isch&amp;q=alexander%20stubb%20putous&amp;revid=586435694&amp;imgdii=_ ), 
  so was kosovo . 
  then you learn that laws do n't matter and that the ones who have the higher fire power are always right . 
  haha cool !, 
  where were you , which city ? 
  yeah , similar in serbia as well . 
  looks like that 's the thing with slavic weddings . 
  i have n't been to a wedding in western europe or us , but , at least from the movies it looks very formal . 
  here people dress formal and all that shit , but the wedding is just one huge party where people of all generations dance and have fun , with tons of food and alcohol everywhere . 
  germans just like to build shit , that is all . 
   normal people into total morons . 
  therefore they are not normal people . 
  if you do n't have enough self-control and fall under the influence of group , and because of that group you do stupid shit for me you are not a ` normal ' human being . 
  this looks steampunk as fuck,

  anytime i want to discover some new genre of music i just browse montage parodies for a while . 
  edit : holy shit i just discovered `` montage parodies calls xxx '' thing , i 'm fucking dying . 
   but thank god we have passed it how ??? 
  is it even possible ??? 
  teach us oh great estonia, 
  idiots who did this are the worst shit , hopefully the police will find them fast . 
  everybody is judging this , most of the people are normal enough to understand that destroying the bakery of your neighbor albanian who lives there for years has no fucking sense . 
  but there are always few retards who think that they are doing something smart . 
  that drone was awesome idea , kudos , i 've never seen such next level irl trolling . 
  but it was clear provocation from your side with the drone and when your players violently rushed to mitrovic when he was calmly bringing the drone down . 
  but it 's also a mistake from our retarded ` fans ' who do n't know how to ignore stupid shit . 
  all in all , terrible situation edit : apparently drone was flying [ this flag ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h84ffza.jpg ) , it 's a map of `` greater albania '' , that has parts of greece , serbia ( kosovo ) , macedonia and montenegro . 
  fuck now i want some gula\u0161 , im hung ^ ( ^ ^ a ) ry, 
  i remember learning about him in elementary school . 
  it 's a common synonym for traitor here as well . 
  3.8 unemployment how the fuck is that possible, 
  kinda tl ; dr : sns ( sns is a rulling party ) bots are people who post comments and upvote/downvote comments on all major newspapers websites . 
  the content and general idea of comments is assigned by their coordinators , it 's usually about glorifying sns and our dear leader vucic , or about denouncing political opponents . 
  they have their own coordinated groups and shit , they even wrote a program that runs in background and fetches instructions from server about which comments to upvote/downvote and then it does that automatically - they created their own botnet . 
  and it 's quite noticeable , you see typical bullshit propaganda comments everyday with hundreds of + that simply seem out of place . 
  also the term `` sns bot '' became quite popular and it refers to mindless supporters of the current regime . 
  i can remove everything , including tea and ham and eggs . 
  i was born in serbia , to serbian parents and i live here . 
  but i consider myself a human being . 
  being serbian for me is just a purely geographical term . 
  i believe in personal identity , every person has his/her own personal traits , regardless of where he/she was born . 
  i somewhat oppose the whole idea of ` national identity ' , for me that 's almost the same as herd mentality . 
  most of the people who are born in your county do x , therefore you should do x because it 's in your veins ? 
  i believe that you are n't born with all those national identity things and/or ` national mentality ' , it 's merely adopted because people subconsciously want to fit in , they want to feel like a part of a group . 
  monkey see monkey do . 
  so my advice to you is to care less about your country background , focus on yourself as a human being . 
  learn more about yourself as a person , develop your skills and interests and you wo n't have a need to identify yourself as german or ukrainian , these things will become irrelevant . 
  i can somewhat understand when people talk crazy shit like that about a distant country that they never seen . 
  but when someone actually visits a country and still keeps believing in crazy things ... that level of narrow-mindness ca n't be explained . 
  i 've met people like that , it 's unreal . 
  i like how only english language has 2 fags kissing huuheuehuehuheu, 
  i thought that was only used in twitch chat, 
  brooo ? 
  how do i dutch , send help, 
  removal of kebab removers ; _ ; actually relocation, 
  ok sorry moter russia gloriuous bring freedom, 
  yes , national identity itself is creepy , it 's a tool to manipulate stupid masses of people . 
  the less personal identity a person has , the more he/she will start identifying with the nation . 
  and the only way to develop your personal identity is through education . 
  what the fuck is with the gypsies kidnapping , my grandma used to tell me the same stories . 
  wtf termos is a brand :o ? 
  we do n't even have ` real ' name for it , if you want to buy that thing you must look for termos exclusively and everybody will understand what you want . 
  programmer , or programer in serbian  anyway , to be honest i do n't know any mainframe developers . 
  and i 'm in computer science uni ( have few exams left ) , i have lots of friends from various branches , but i still do n't know a single mainframe dev . 
  maybe that 's not so popular among the younger programmers ? 
  so i 'd say that it 's not that easy to get a job as mainframe dev . 
  programer , 
  ahh to be honest i did n't even knew that the guy was referring to that , my bad . 
  you are probably talking about \u040a ( nj ) and \u0409 ( lj ) . 
  my point was that all letters are always pronounced the same , 
  exactly , while i 'm not earning 5 figures , i really ca n't complain . 
  imagine if tomorrow all the prices in denmark magically dropped so you could survive through a month with 300-500 euros ( bills and food ) , if you needed 20 euros to go to a club etc. 
  with having all your friends and family around you ( i.e. 
  not having to relocate ) . 
  and of course , you keep your current paycheck . 
  fuck american dream , i 'm living the #serbiandream :d, 
  well there are no rules for it , it really is a global business , even in serbia you can earn 5 figures per month . 
  not that common , but it exists . 
  no softening , as i said every letter is exactly one sound that ca n't be `` divided '' , you can see this to understand what am i talking about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4qv_s6dd8q so everytime you see a letter it 's always that one sound , it 's never changed , 
  serbian 100 % phonetic language master race reporting in . 
  no double letters no shit , every letter is always exactly one sound = no confusion . 
  is polish like this too ? 
  wait wait how can a place like chicago or seattle have more sun than most of the europe ??? 
  ps you have a typo , 2600 - 1800 should probably say 1600 - 1800, 
  well it 's hard to artificially create a community if there is no interest for it . 
  it ' s one of those things where people say ` yeah that 's cool ' and then forget abou it next day . 
  lel that 's weird considering that both languages are slavic dom = home ; domovina = homeland, 
  [ nije da li\u010di na neku drugu himnu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooibnggrlmy ), 
  i guess that these kinds of videos show only the good parts of the city , but dammit this looks like the city of my dreams , it has everything that i like . 
  hwhat, 
  i really do n't know , probably because of the influence of english language ,
