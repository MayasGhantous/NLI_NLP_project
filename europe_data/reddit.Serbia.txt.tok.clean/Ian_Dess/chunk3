  [ we are the vanguard of your destruction ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppqwyu2b7x8 ), 
  here is another stream ( youtube ) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrzcaspkk74, 
  yeah , but time is n't , college , work , all that shiet ... who knows when i 'll have 1-2 months to do something like that :(, 
  holy shit its beautiful .

  \\ #cccc 1389, 
  is anyone even reading these lel ? 
  i have a feeling like people just come here to write and talk about their country edit : okay okay , i get it , there are people who read it . 
  we have that in serbia as well . 
  looks like it 's a common thing in ex-communist countries . 
  do you want to be mega hipster and brag to your friends how you watch serbian movies ? 
  then go ahead and watch [ klopka \\ ( the trap \\ ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478813/ ) , it 's an awesome drama about ( quote from imdb  `` about an ordinary man , who is forced to choose between life and death of his own child . '', 
  if you are having a bad day , go and watch intouchables , it 's fucking beautiful \\* . 
  ( you too ! ), 
  none , because all of our 1000000 year old traditions are still maintained . 
  i live in the 3rd largest city in serbia ( ni\u0161 ) and there is a mosque right in the city center . 
  and i think that not even 1-2 % of the city population is muslim . 
  cool story bro, 
  okay i just said dick is kinda cute : /, 
  poola is kinda cute \\ ^_^, 
  = serbian serbian is like e ^ x, 
  heh it 's nice to see serbian , serbian derivative 1 and serbian derivative 2 languages on reddit \\ ^ _ \\ ^, 
  what the marklar did you just fucking say about marklar , you little marklar ? 
  i 'll have you know marklar graduated top of my class in the navy marklars , and i 've been involved in numerous secret raids on marklar , and i have over 300 confirmed marklars . i am trained in marklar warfare and i 'm the top marklar in the entire marklar armed marklars . 
  you are nothing to marklar but just another marklar . 
  oh wow i never realized that about germans lol , even thogh the meaning and the word are similiar in serbian ( nemci ), 
  what the fuck happened with eurovision in the last 10-15 years ??? 
  could you even imagine a band like abba once performed on eurovision ? 
  i know i ca n't . 
  it seems nowadays like it 's a competition of anonymous singers ( ? ), 
  and clowns like this one . 
  power rangers fuck yeah , only the alpha kids in my school were white ranger . 
  i was always the nerd blue ranger ; _ ;, 
  their letters are fucking beautiful . 
  ( \u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 \u10d4\u10dc\u10d0 look at that , it looks like some awesome j. r. r. tolkien elf shiet . 
  is not unintegrated latvian russians . 
  is secret police . 
  man sad . 
  bosna stronk, 
  do you think that a country that had pretty good economy and where people were happy could just fall in terrible civil war by itself ? 
  of course not , our overseas friends imported ` freedom ' to us , with the help of domestic idiots . 
  and no , i 'm not a conspiracy theorist , in the last few weeks cia was removing ` top secrect ' labels from their documents on yugoslavian war , in those documents you can clearly see how they controlled the course of war , it was all over the news here , if you are interested i can find it . 
  and everything would be great for 50 years and then nationalistic scumbags/foreign powers would destroy your awesome union into lots of small poor countries . 
  source : tried making unions with neighbor countries ( more than once ) . 
  because eu is holy roman empire and you ca n't join hre if your country is bigger than emperor 's ( germany ), 
  that sounds terrible , but i wan na try it after all these orgasmic comments by the scandinavians d :, 
  ubuntu is fucking beautiful !, 
  i can do all my work on linux , valve ported dota to linux and more and more games coming to linux too , well , might be time to say good bye to windows !, 
  awww shiet , the day i was born . 
  i guess i am lithuanian now . 
  i understand that it 's difficult being gay in most of the world 's countries , but damn , that argument `` someone does n't like gays =  he is homophobic =  he must be gay '' makes no logical sense at all . 
  fuck no , we tried to remove kebab for 500 years . 
  & nbsp ; ^ ( erhm and we still are n't part of the eu ; _ , 
  fuking polan , they inherited the lithuanian throne and now they are the biggest country ( i.e. 
  like this http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/329/210/e13.png, 
  conclusion : our fathers were jealous fuckers that did n't give us food when we were young :(, 
  i am the only guy i know who is shorter than his father d : i 'm 178cm and he is 182 . 
   i do n't think the people of the us or britain ( or france - do n't forget about them ) would tolerate any sort of protracted conflict that involved anything more than a few limited missile strikes . 
  of course you would n't tolerate that , i know that 95 % of people everywhere hate war , no matter the color of the skin or nationality . 
  and that 's why your governments lie to you . 
  i witnessed it personally - 1999 nato bombing of serbia . 
  it lasted for few months , and nato told you that they were helping albanians on kosovo . 
  and how they helped them ? 
  by boming the shit out of serbia , i live in a second largest serbian city and i remember that like it was yesterday , when they bombed my civilian neighborhood with [ cluster munition ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cluster_munition#yugoslavia.2c_1999 ) in the middle of the day with all the people and children running around . 
  lol . 
  i hope that at least people of britain/us do n't believe bullshit from their government . 
  and i hope that they do n't think that britain/us would go to war just to ` help ' poor syrians . 
  wtf you have \u0161 and \u017e too ? 
  did n't know that  hai fajv for master rejs fonetik lengui\u017dis, 
  get on level of serbian language bro . 
  [ every letter is just one ` sound ' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=k4qv_s6dd8q#t=08 ) , there is no spelling , letters do n't even have names . 
  so when you see a word , let 's say `` ku\u0107a '' ( house ) , you just say the ` sound ' of each letter , and you are done , you read it properly . 
  yeah , well said , you are right . 
  i recommend the last one too ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  wut , did n't know alfred was dutch . 
  it was pretty popular here , too ... 
  i remember i somehow felt sad when i watched it as a kid , it had some crazy stuff and kinda mature content with that hitler crow and shit like that . 
  edit : wut again , is his name really alfred ** jodocus ** kwak ? 
  because in serbian dub they called him alfred ** jonathan ** kwak :d, 
  til i am in the 53 % and i am the 87 % . 
  here is why only 53 % of the serbians support eu : step 1 ) eu sets some conditions to our politicians , they give them actual work that needs to be done . 
  step 2 ) our politicians do n't do it , or do it sloppy , or take million years to do it . 
  step 3 ) eu responds to that with negative actions . 
  step 4 ) politicians do n't blame the eu directly , but they keep reassuring the people how they did everything correctly , how they tried their best , and how it 's really strange that eu gave them negative answers . 
  rinse and repeat . 
  so now average serbian thinks : `` fuck eu , all they to do is constantly make some requirements and give us crazy tasks , once we do that , they respond with more terms , we do n't need eu , they obviously hate us . '', 
  aaaand now i wan na play sim city , but i am sad that sim city 5 is shit and i played too much sim city 4 that it bored me fuck #firstworldproblems . 
  thanks ,

  \u00a1 genial !, 
  i know about that emperor ( or was he king ) mindaugas and i know that vilnius is capital and i know that i always loved to watch serbia ( yugoslavia ) - lithuania basketball matches . 
  most electronic devices are cheaper in us , not just the ps4 . 
  why ? 
  i guess it 's because of taxes .
