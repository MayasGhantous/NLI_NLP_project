  students , teachers etc. 
  but still , with all the isis threats and shit , this stuff is scary and i am kinda worried . 
  when thousands of them pass everyday through serbia , there is a high risk of terrorists infiltrating there . 
  as far as i know our police tries to check every single one of them , but i doubt the efficiency of that . 
  so people all around the country spontaneously agree to burn the fields with olive trees together ? 
  that 's really suspicious . 
   arson happens every year ,  exploit the land wat . 
  how , what do they get by this ? 
  i have no clue to be honest . 
  autonomous province means that they have more rights than a simple `` region '' so to say , but less authority than a state ( e.g. 
  autonomous province ca n't have it 's own laws and similiar stuff like an american state can ), 
  not a state , it was an autonomous province of serbia . 
  croatia and slovenia were states , kosovo was n't . 
  spaceship port ? 
  i do , but nowadays it 's just a monument and should be preserved imo, 
  half of bosnia is called `` serbian republic '' , 33 % of total bosnian population is serbian and they want independence through peaceful referendum : nope , ca n't do . 
  -- 2004 massive conflict on kosovo between albanians and serbs , most of serbs forced to flee from kosovo : 2008 - kosovo gets independence . 
  why ? 
  crowd and vibrations can harm structures . 
  or i missed something in that comment . 
  idk sounds like normal croatian to me : c, 
  it 's true , but we invaded 1300 years ago , it 's about time that we become one , accept our fate and let 's conquer the known universe together and ascend into new race of orthodox uber humans, 
  you ca n't simplify it like that . 
  declining economy , years of religious and other opressions , foreign influences etc , it all lead to the fall of yugoslavia . 
  there were thousands of factors, 
  it 's not a joke , it 's real bro, 
  [ ahem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarma_%28food%29 ), 
  shhh be quiet no tears now , let our empire into your soul, 
  this is just the starting point , our trained gypsy armies will conquer it . 
  we , and i believe other ex-yugo countries , call people with socks and flipflops `` a polish tourist '' . 
  why i have no clue , but i think it 's pretty widespread, 
  our roma do n't shit everywhere , yaaay, 
  yep , looks like you just hang out with rednecks, 
  yes , that 's what your media told you , but i was there when nato dropped cluster bombs on my civilian neighborhood . 
  why not become a mechanic or try with some similar physical labor since studying is obviously not for you ? 
  no matter where you live , if you have good real-life skills you will earn money . 
  does n't matter if your entire country or continent goes to shit , you have your knowledge and you can take it elsewhere , no one can take that away from you . 
  for me , that is the true meaning of that cheesy phrase `` knowledge is power '' . 
  our leader vucic also lead the tank division on foot and he destroyed the opposing tanks with his bare hands . 
  oh glorious leader, 
  [ \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f ] ( http://russiatrek.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/soviet-space-program-propaganda-poster-14.jpg ), 
  so joke 's on you usa and eu , russians gon na start doing more physical activity and simply crush everything once they develop amazing strength and physique . 
  i like how the `` village girl '' is wearing adidas bottom and high heels . 
  i 'd guess that 50 % of the people would say yes right away , the other 50 % would grab their ak-47s . 
  lel go back to your hole , this is about football . 
  come to / r/serbia if you wan na troll , we love trolls, 
  and so , their end has begun . 
  soon after this , most of them will sign contracts with 2nd league german teams . 
  because they won the world cup , they will think that they are the best players in the universe . 
  they wo n't train as hard and they will discover the appeal of alcohol , cocaine and hookers . 
  some of them will quit football really soon and come back to serbia broke , they will ask their baba everyday for 100 dinars , so they can have a coffee in a local cafe . 
  sometimes , baba will feel generous and give them 200-300 dinars , so they can have a beer too . 
  others will end their careers at 25 after glorious career in which they played for kazakhstani first league teams as a reserve player . 
  that is the career of an average serbian football player - great talent , zero motivation . 
  if yugoslavia was still a country , we 'd be a major force in all sports , olympic winner contenders easily . 
  nah not really ;d, 
  congratulations , you have reached the serbian level right now . 
  we are in a crysis for the last 20 years , so people simply do n't give a shit anymore . 
  double mexican ? 
  we are the mexicans of europe lolo edit : judging by some comments here , looks like some people do n't get this . 
  this is not a `` berlin wall '' , it 's just a wall to stop illegal migrants from africa and asia that pass through serbia on their way to eu , you will still be able to cross the border normally on border crossings . 
  last time i checked , constantinople was n't in serbia :d it 's [ nis ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ni%c5%a1 ), 
  oh you poor soul , it 's really bad that you have to suffer in those state of the art cars . 
  not really , i am pretty sure that no one bought a tesla in my city , yet it 's marked on a map under 2015 [ here ] ( http://www.teslamotors.com/supercharger ) . 
  but my city is on a somewhat important crossroad , it connects asia minor with europe so that 's probably the reason why they wan na build it here . 
  where are you from ? 
  if you live in a developed country , what did you do to make sure that your country becomes/remains developed ? 
  you voted ? 
  there is 90 % of the chance that you did n't do more than this . 
  maybe you tried to complain somewhere if you saw some irregularities ? 
  well guess what , people in our shit countries do all this and much more all the time . 
  so stop lecturing us like you are some capable all-mighty freedom fighter , i get really angry when i see these ignorant comments . 
  it is a complex matter involving thousands of factors and it 's not as simple as `` hey people , just stop laying around and do some shit finally '' . 
  r/europe is cringe enough already . 
  no need for mesages , i 'd just send couple cases of ak-47s and a lot of bullets to serbians in 1389 , before the battle of kosovo , to prevent 500 years under kebab . 
  there was a lot of mafia in security agencies and politic parties and his decisive fight against corruption and organized crime got in their way . 
  i think he would do his best to prevent the independence of kosovo through diplomatic actions , even though he was fully aware of the problem and small chances of that happening , while remaining in friendly relations with eu and usa . 
  but it 's really hard to talk about that now , who knows what could have happened . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assassination_of_zoran_%c4%90in%c4%91i%c4%87 this very smart and capable guy ( who was elected in 2000 ) got assassinated and the last glimmer of hope that we can become a normal country died again . 
  since his assassination , there has n't been a single man who was at least half the politician \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 was . 
  [ ignorant american stereotype intensifies ], 
  huh , i was sure that i saw last year that roaming charges were abolished . 
  okay good to know , i 'm looking into a possibility of a euro trip with interrail , so i 'm gathering info , 
  thanks . 
  but roaming charges for calls and sms were dropped , right ? 
  are data plans valid in whole eu or just one country ? 
  \u263b / this is bob . 
  copy and paste him so he can take over youtube . 
  i really have no clue how to find it , it was unrelated to the thread . 
  maybe someone else will help us . 
  but i 'm sure that i saw it here . 
  this http://i725.photobucket.com/albums/ww260/mejjasu/pozadina/heklanadesktopu-1.jpg i have no idea what 's it called in english . 
  ( old ) people tend to put it on any surface . 
  tv 's , kitchen counters , tables , etc. 
  lol didnt even notice that . 
  was n't there a thread here reticently where everyone thought that only grandmas in their country do that , but then it turned out that pretty much everyone uses those decorations and that everyone thought that it 's only in their country ? 
  no escape from balkan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtga0jvhp2a, 
  to prevent people from getting confused and offended , i propose this new map of europe http://i.imgur.com/susvl9h.jpg, 
  that 's the fastest way to return the money spent on building the track , just fine everyone usign it !,
