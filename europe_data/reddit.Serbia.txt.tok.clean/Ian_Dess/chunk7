  i am a man with university degree . 
  and this whole discussion is not about conspiracy theory , it 's just politics and geo strategical interests . 
  how is it not real when kosovo was a part of my country 10 years ago and i keep seeing `` greater albania '' sentiments everywhere ??? 
  before it became de facto independent i kept seeing such messages `` do n't worry guys , you are just paranoid etc '' do n't get me wrong , i 'm not some crazy nationalist and after all i do n't hate regular albanians , if you came today to my house as a friend i 'd invite you in and i 'd offer you my food . 
  it does n't matter what side are you or me on , we could cheer for darth vader as far as our governments are concerned . 
  the important thing is the reactions and statements of officials , and that is the thing that 's worrying me the most , i 've seen it happen time and time again for the last ~ 15 years . 
  yes , chill out and not give a shit about anything , i see how that helped us and how great our country is doing . 
  once again , that 's perfectly understandable , i do n't expect average joe from texas to give 2 shits about serbia or albania and i 'm not crazy to blame greater albania on the people of eu/usa . 
  the worrying thing is a complete lack of statements from officials and representatives . 
  it happens time and time again . 
  and it looks like albanians have a green light to do whatever they want . 
  if 50 serbians started shooting on kosovo , there 'd be a nato meeting in a matter of hours, 
  seriously ??? 
  man with kosovo flag says that ? 
  that 's like when someone punches you and then he says `` chill the fuck out bro '' . 
  it 's not a brand new story , it has been going for years . 
  and i 'm aware that most people do n't care about us . 
  that 's understandable but it 's just one more reason for my anti-eu stance . 
  but the more important thing is the complete lack of official statements from politicians , that 's worrying . 
  i do n't anymore . 
  the more i grow older the more i see how eu and west is dominated by propaganda , same like russia . 
  latest example is the shit in macedonia . 
  albanian terrorist army is caught in macedonia , they give official statement that they want greater albania and no reactions from usa and eu . 
  minimal mentions in western media . 
  in most it was n't even mentioned that they were albanian !, 
  some of the killed terrorist were the bodyguards of albanian politician from kosovo for fucks sake !, 
  meanwhile , when e.g. 
  serbian tourist gets into a fist fight with someone in eu , we as a nation are satanized in all foreign media like there 's no tomorrow . 
  i 've seen it happen a lot of times , i always wanted to believe that it 's a coincidence . 
  i respect european people and most of european values , but i am really dissapointed , it 's now completely clear to me that eu and usa is on the side of albania and supports their aspirations for expansion . 
  i wanted to believe that this is not the case for many years , that it 's just a conspiracy theory , but now it 's completely clear . 
  edit : to try to explain my point better : i do n't expect average european to care about serbia or albania , i am more worried about lack of statements from important government representatives . 
  good . 
  but this should be breaking news in all european media , this is an attack by 70 terrorists on a soil of a sovereign european country . 
  i do n't remember that we had an attack of this scale in last few years in europe . 
  fortunately it appears that there sre no civillian casualties yet . 
  it 's practically a war zone in kumanovo all day , and as far as i can see there are no news about this in western media . 
  why ? 
  oh look the albanians need more lebensraum, 
   europe is doing you a favor by even allowing you to join dear european minister of foreign politics , thank you for your input .

  are you realy that stupid and fail to see that the sententce you quoted was sarcasm ? 
  that 's it , i 'm unsubbing from this sub , your comment is a beyound retardness and the fact that it has upvotes has convinced me that it 's time to leave this poor group . 
  what ??? 
  a reasonable and mature comment calling for more understanding ? 
  time to downvote you brah, 
  and sanctions wo n't happen because russians own half of montenegro . 
  you have insulted us infidel , wraith of the god empreror of arakis is upon you . 
  kappa = grey face ( no space ), 
  keepo, 
  fuck eu , we 'll make our own country and we 'll call it yugos ... oh wait ... 
   just start acting like retards its because we are retards . 
  i said my neighborhood was bombed . 
  my fucking neighborhood . 
  that tends to stay in your memory you know ? 
  i do n't give a shit about you or uk or serbia , or anything , just fuck off . 
  i heard that serbs killed jesus too . 
  \\ #punishmentforgodslayers, 
  oh lol how fucking stupid are you . 
  i 'm not saying that it 's not worse . 
  it is worse . 
  now are you happy ? 
  ^ ^ ( remove ), 
  u foken wot m8 remove uk london is ireland, 
  ah fuck it why im even trying to reason with all of you fuckers . 
  remove kebab our glorious empire shall rise once again, 
  yep nato good guys , the world police , i ca n't wait for them to bring freedom again . 
  they can accidentally kill wherever they want and we 'll just say it 's sad . 
  50 retards who happen to be serbian do terrible things and my whole country getting shit for 20 years . 
  99 % of the people had no say in that . 
  most suspects are/were in hague , my country publicly callled those events tragic and apologized , it is a tragic event but there is absolutely nothing we can do now to change that , can we ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cluster_bombing_of_ni%c5%a1 yes it is a horrific event . 
  but i 'm tired of all those `` fuck serbs nato didnt even bomb them enough '' comments like whole nation went and commited genocide or whatnot . 
  but nato bombed my civillian neighborhood . 
  it is whataboutism , but that does n't mean that it 's not a legitimate question . 
  still , we were one nation back then and it was our soil . 
  or neighborhood . 
  call it whatever you want , but that had direct effects on all people from yugoslavia . 
  then the nato bombing in ' 99 . 
  then the rebellions on kosovo in 2004 . 
  that was n't a war per se , but it was a major conflict where we lost a part of our territory . 
  as you can see , i did n't even count the oluja in '95 because it `` was n't on our soil '' . 
  jesus christ italy you had last war on you soil 70 years ago . 
  serbia effectively had 3 wars in the last 20-25 years . 
  really , why ca n't people just forget all that and live in peace , hmmm it 's so surprising , i could n't think of the reason why the people have lack of trust . 
  wait , so he is back ? 
  that aired live today or what , i ca n't tell from the article ? 
  lol, 
  yep , some people prefer to use it and some people encourage the exclusive use of cyrillic to preserve national identity etc. 
  we learn both the cyrillic and latin at school and i 'm glad that 's the case , i see them simply as tools that help in written communication , the more you know the better . 
  i can easily read bulgarian or german or english or russian . 
  even greek to some extent , the letters are somewhat similiar to cyrillic . 
  lolo it was popular here as well . 
  but i thik the show ended or smth, 
  the odds are 1.10 that those slave traffickers end up being from some balkan country, 
  hoho kebab removing itself . 
  not really but i have to upvote you because i love vikings, 
  i passed through slovakia 3 times , whole country .
