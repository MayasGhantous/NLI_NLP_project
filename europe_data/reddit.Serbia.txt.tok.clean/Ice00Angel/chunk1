that 's just impossible . 
  it would take a lot of shit to happen to cause russia to join the eu, 
  `` small serbia '', 
  some of you croats simply cant go a thread without shitting over serbia , can you ? 
  it already is on 4chan as poortugal, 
  the reddit secret service thanks you for your cooperation, 
  what were you banned for ? 
  and what was your username ? 
  hitler and napoleon approve, 
  have you thought about the possibility the data is incorrect ? 
  why not ? 
  you should read the article twice before any rash posting . 
  i wonder where is this data collected , because if i had to guess id sad serbia is on 5-10 % max, 
  finno-ugric people, 
  you 're incorrect ... 
  typical `` nikada do 90tih nisu imali drzavu '' person, 
  same here . 
  there were two drops actually - a lighter one after the crimea situation , and a massive one after the refugee crisis . 
  it could also have to do with the fact it 's been made a default sub not so long ago . 
  regardless , the sub used to be far better . 
  i didnt bring religion onto this, 
  putting serbia in the same category with albania and turkey is just stupid . 
  bih higher pp than montenegro , serbia and hungary ? 
  yeah , no way this is correct . 
  few years ago our girls ana and jelena were place 1 and 2 on the wta ranking, 
   i 've seen at least one estonian user argue here on reddit that we have nothing at all to do with the other baltics . 
  pretty crazy . 
  oh , i think that guy argued with me and a lithuanian guy . 
  the only pro russia parties are dveri and radicals . 
  radicals are around on 6-7 % and dveri are around 4-5 % . 
  two of them are the only right wing parties . 
  are you serious ? 
  they are even called `` zveri '' here which means beasts . 
  probably among the worst parties in this elections . 
  it will change the tide a bit against him , as a lot of young undecided voters are huge fans of theirs . 
  they have 4 million views in 4-5 days after all . 
  if all of the pro russia and anti eu parties made a coalition , they woulnd ' t have more than 20 % votes . 
  serbia is n't close to the eu because of the political reasons * cough * kosovo * cough * . 
  difference between serbia , romania and bulgaria are n't that big to be honest . 
  and we 're definitely way more developed now than you were when you entered the eu . 
  why not ? 
  a lot can happen in 14 years . 
  +1 i get that its a black mail , but you people do n't realize how fucking rich the corporations are . 
  also you get the skilled work force from the countries with high taxes , not from the tax havens , so they should kinda repay for it . 
  small businesses should have smaller taxes than corporations . 
  they have austria and germany ... 
  in most of the middle eastern countries women are forbidden to drive under the sharia law . 
  most common 3rd lang is german , then followed up by russian and french . 
  in some elementary schools there is no choice , and in some there is , depends on its teacher capacity . 
  in highschools in most cases you can choose your preference . 
  also majority of highschools have latin as well as 4th language . 
  i 'm sorry but , however politically incorrect it seems , the fundamental teachings of islam do n't really comply with `` european values '' . 
  there is no way i 'd consider someone to be an european if he thinks women should be covered entirely in public , should n't drive cars or are in any way valued as anything different but a birthing organism . 
  there is no way i 'd consider chopping someone 's hand off for a theft or stoning someone because of his sexual orientation is european . 
  so , how much of a muslim someone is * does * matter , no matter how politically incorrect it is . 
  also , culture and religion may be different things , but religion is part of one 's culture and it defines it greatly . 
  and in dota and cs go . 
  you seriously do n't understand what gdp is and what it represents then . 
  why are there so many removed comments ? 
  this is probably the most fitting one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njtmtsxts_i chorus version with english translation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cko9mbwjqa this is a close contender : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcntqnxunee it 's a song about serbian and bosnian knights which fought the turks on kosovo field in 1389 in the battle of kosovo . 
  the translations : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/himna_kosovskih_junaka, 
  i only agree with the 2nd one being ` representative ' of serbia . 
  i can guarantee that most of the serbs have n't ever heard the other 3 . though i do n't understand why have you put a version of `` hajde jano '' sung by a foreigner ? 
  the accents sound way off, 
  i 'm becoming more and more certain that / u/da _ zna_bula is a \u0161e\u0161elj-bot . 
  what he literally does for the whole day is spread pro russia and anti eu propaganda on serbia related threads . 
  firstly , most of the young people look up to western countries and most of us think russia is a cluster fuck . 
  it 's not a secret that serbians like russia/russians for helping us in various crisis , but to go and say we want to be like russia is hilariously stupid . 
  rusophilia is mostly prevalent with uneducated and hillbilly people here tbh , and it 's not even as great as certain posters here portray it to be . 
  after all , `` rusi su nas prodali '' ( the russians have sold us ) is often used saying here . 
  also lol @ the source - pravdareport.ru kek cheers, 
  well thank god your opinion does n't count in these matters , otherwise half of the eu countries would n't be accepted on the same grounds . 
   we call people who are extremely pro-eu as eu talibans you 're either a diaspora serb or just flat out bullshiting , beause i 've never even heard of that term . 
  because no one made it ? 
  how this thread usually goes :  someone says hurling  someone posts a video of it  someone says `` omg hurling is so amazing , i will start giving it more attention '', 
  it participated for the first time last year . 
  vampir is actually a serbian word , and the legend primarilly originated here . 
  the first `` recorded '' attack was in kisiljevo i think, 
  the problem with making burgers imo is that they have so many different individual ingredients so when looking at them and the whole process , i get like `` fuck this , ill just buy one , its easier '' . 
  thx for sharing though , if i ever force myself ill try it out, 
  people are kinda driven away from it because it 's inhabited by 15ish people who know each other and quite often make internal jokes in the comments that do n't really add up to the discussion . 
  having lurked it for a while i realized they 're nice people , but i understand why other lurkers hesitate to post . 
  things got better after they added the casual sub i think , but it may have been too late . 
  this is effect is further increased by it not receiving auto subs from redditors with serbian ip address . 
  then you do n't get that much from it as your trade with the uk is already kinda big . 
  canada wants this deal to trade more with germany , sweden , italy , france etc. 
  to be honest , serbian - croatian relations have become a way to pick up some easy political points . 
   serbia is trying to join the eu  croats do n't really like serbia  block their chapter  get more votes also works vice versa, 
  done in paint 100 %, 
  please ... [ pin\u0111ur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pindjur ) is the masterrace, 
  tbh i think serbian \u010ce\u0161ka ( pronounced as cheshka ) is pretty neat, 
  jersey is a tax haven so it 's not comparable, 
  i 'm sorry if you ca n't handle it , but that 's just how almost everyone feels , how it 's being classified by the eu , by politicians and by the encyclopedias . 
  ** this ** serb just follows the standards everyone has set on this subject , rather than ** this ** estonian 's aspirations . 
  how can you be certain other nordic countries see you as nordic ? 
  because on this sub i 've got the impression that they do n't . 
  you 've not even given a single compelling argument on this subject , but instead procceeded to call my opinions stupid as `` i 'm not estonian '' . 
  therefore i 'm done with this argument . 
  i 'm pretty positive this guy was the lead role in a german movie called `` final race '' or smth like that . 
  estonia is baltic geo-politically , but not ethno linguistically .
