  because they do n't give up . 
  the skill difference it very noticeable , english player control the ball a lot better , but when an icelandic player gets passed he runs back to try and get the ball again . 
  over and over again . 
  iceland had 6-7 players in attack and 10 players in defence because they ran . 
  they ran and did n't give up . 
  got latest ep spoiler, 
  that i know of , yes . 
  each phoneme/sound has a corresponding letter in the alphabet and there are n't prolongued/differently accented/very similar phonemes . 
  so you learn what sounds there are , learn which letter corresponds to each sound ( 30 sounds , 30 letters ) and you 're ready to write . 
  you hear a word with 6 sounds , you take your pen and write them in the order . 
  same goes for reading - you see the letters written and just pronounce sounds . 
  2 letters cant make 1 sound ( example : english meet has 4 letters , yet 3 sounds . ), 
  kids as young as 1-2 grade can write and read 95 % of the words i think . 
  i think german is easier for slavic and germanic speakers , but french should be easier for romance speakers . 
  german being easier for slavic speakers is arguable though , but i think phonemes , accenting and grammar of german is closer than the french one, 
  yes but neither it is a romance language, 
  it 's not really similar to any of the slavic languages though  . , 
  i nominate serbian as it has the best/easiest spelling system of european languages !, 
  unlike the one in turkey only water had been spilled in belgrade . 
  i am not talking about citizenship , im talking about acceptance into their ethnicity and culture . 
  in the usa you can learn good english , learn about their history live for a while and call yourself an american . 
  british ppl have shown its not the same case in the uk, 
  would you wan na live in a country whose citizens only tolerate you because of your education and would banish you in any other case scenario ? 
  and how would you feel if people around the eu had started talking about banishing the british people as soon as the results appeared on 24th ? 
  i personally dont care really , as ive never intended to even visit the uk , i dont know anyone that has migrated to the uk and as there are barely a few serbs living there , but to me it seems that brits want the best of the 2 worlds and i dont think thats possible . 
  well i 'm of an opinion the circumstances have changed . 
  in the last century the economy was booming , so all the immigrants could 've been employed and that enabled them to integrate quickly . 
  now during the economic crisis not even the citizens have high employment so immigration becomes more noticeable . 
  i could be wrong though , not really familiar with post 2000 immigration to be honest . 
  started by acussations of brain damage ended up with an agreement on a portion of an argument . 
  hope brexit ends up at least similarly, 
  actually a lot of ppl from europe immigrated during the 20 century too . 
  thats why the usa emerged to be a superpower after ww2 . 
  post war booming economy paired with additional work force empowered their position . 
  almost all of the ppl of balkan descent and most of the polish and russian descent migrated during 1950-1990, 
  shouldve pointed out i was refering to 20 century immigration, 
  welfare system does tend to attract poor people with no education , true , but animosity from the local population will deter the educated immigrants . 
  im not experienced with immgrating , to be honest , but i do know i wouldnt wan na live in a country i was n't welcome in . 
  that 's why i jumped the gun and drew a paralel between the usa and uk because the former one built itself by warmly accepting immigrants and integrated them into society . 
  you 're right , no need to be rude , i 'm sorry . 
  was just in a league of legends game so my attitude transfered from there . 
  anyway i refered to the usa immigration during the 20th century which brought them where they currently are . 
  are you that braindead to understand ? 
  no doctor/engineer/programmer / chemist of polish/romanian/pakistani / indian/arabian descent would want to live in a country where his countrymen were banished from knowing the only reason he 's accepted because of his level of education . 
  learn something from the usa system , there 's a reason they 're a world power and the uk is n't . 
  the ironic thing is those people who keep demanding that immigrants get deported are in a lot of the cases less educated than the people they wanted deported . 
  way to dig your own grave, 
  umm i do n't understand your post ? 
  are you 13 ? 
   russia commentates on something `` oh boy they 're spreading the propaganda again ''  russia does n't say shit `` oh they 're silent so they do n't make voters vote against the result they would want '' you have an issue man, 
  you kinda did a 180 degrees in that argument by starting claiming i ` ts most viewed in russia and ended up bingoing his point it 's most viewed in england as it 's in english lol ... 
  democracy is n't voting on something until you get a result you want or is better for your country . 
  for reference `` ja '' means `` i '' in slavic languages, 
  but there 's a problem with the 52 % majority that has voted to leave the eu . 
  if the uk bowed after the referendum and ended up in an even worse position in the eu there ** will ** be riots and instability in the country . 
  those 52 % were already quite vocal , imagine how would they be after a decision they made by making up the majority was n't respected , and they even ended up more `` tied '' then they were before the referendum . 
  the uk is on a really thin ice and one wrong step could make it break so i hope your politicians do n't fuck up . 
  it was only a prank guys, 
  well i think germany wants the same thing, 
  denmark , finland and sweden ? 
  oh it 's kinda hard to spot sarcasm on the internet . 
  im not talking about your right to commentate on anything , and i in fact encourage it . 
  it 's the `` this is american website yadda yadda '' i have a problem with . 
  who gives a damn who 's site it is . 
  so british people can post shit about american politics and you woulnd ' t be allowed to complain about it because they language you 're using is theirs ? 
  you have to trigger it in under 2 years . 
   this is an american website , get use to it this comment is among the stupidest things you can say . 
  english is an european language yet no one forces you to follow it 's rules of spelling and vocabulary and say `` this is an european language , get used to it . '', 
  too bad considering the ticket for now is 500 usd for both ways : /, 
  i 'm pretty surprised by that map too as i know some danish people , and i 've seen pictures of danish celebrities and i could 've sworn brown - light eyes was about 50-50 . and 28 % seems a bit too low for serbia . 
  green + blue number is close to brown eyes number here based on my observation, 
  umm the colors are only used to differentiate the lang families , not to indicate which of them are close because in that case baltic languages should be colored more similarly to slavic than the uralic ones are . 
  anyway pink ( uralic ) and red ( romance ) are similar colors yet the language families are nothing alike . 
  we have a similar saying that goes :  i vuk sit i ovce na broju which roughly translates to : the wolf is sated and all the sheeps are at count . 
  casualties statistic is n't really reliable when it comes to siegeing a city as the wounded and captured civilians count while the attacking side has no civilians at the battle ground . 
  the legions have been formed around 150ish bce and from then until 3-4 century ad they have numbered between 4000 and 7000 men . 
  if i recall correctly during the times of barbaric invasions in 4-5 century ad number of men in a legion decreased , but legions numbers were increased so they could defend the border more efficiently . 
  after the western empire fell , legions continued to be used in the eastern empire until 6 century . 
  not only have they recognized it to be superior , they based a lot of their culture on the greek one . 
  mythology , myths , clothing , way of life , art , philosophy , science , music , literature , goverment etc. 
  were all either imported or influenced by greece . 
  though romans were inspired by greeks on a lot of subjects , they also improved stuff they ` borrowed ' . 
  roman architecture was influenced by the greek one , but they improved it drastically . 
  same goes for law and military . 
  well played !, 
  if it means anything most serbians are cheering for you and think you can win it . 
  i am not claiming it 's predestined to succeed , i 'm not agreeing with your claim it 's predestined to fail . 
  big difference . 
  neither does your claim two countries will fuck up a cooperation agreement in 2016 . but sure . 
  two can play that game : knowing the history of the usa you guys will have a civil war soon , in which black people will rebel against the white people . 
  in serbian `` sloveni '' are n't slovenians . 
  sloveni are slavic . 
  slovenians are sloven ** c ** i, 
  what do you mean ? 
  south slavic languages are really smooth and generally have gentle accents unlike other slavic languages . 
  he 's so salty about that tax lol, 
   i 'm not sure if you have free press there in serbia no we do n't have printing paper yet . 
  actually we are still living by the tribal system  but there 's something here in the west called `` opinion pieces '' there 's something here called `` kolumna '' which is basically that . 
  i 'm not refering to this post in particular , i 'm refering to the medias publishing misleading data , articles , claims etc to support he `` out '' campaign . 
  this is getting ridiculous .
