  newspapers should be objective not pushing their own propagandas . 
  from what ive seen here in the past few months i think the uk has the shittiest media in europe, 
  well that explains estonia i guess, 
  no its not , do n't lie . 
  you 're from slovenia and you consider yourself to be yugoslavian , so i do n't see any connection you have to serbia/serbs, 
  itt inconsiderate europeans being cunts about ac they do n't need in their 10 degrees averagely cooler country, 
  this guy is n't serbian , ive seen him on our local sub reddit he barely can speak serbian , so i 'm guessing its a diaspora serb that circle jerks russia, 
  that 's because most of the americans are n't familiar with european history . 
  which dish would you recommend for a tall , calorie demanding family ? 
  my mom is rather skilled at cooking and we love experimenting with food . 
  which greek meals are veggie friendly ? 
  from what i 've experienced , they use a lot of meat, 
  looks appealing to be honest , but not caloric enough imo, 
  can someone explain hungary ? 
  the population stats are taken from wolframalpha.com so if you calculate something slightly different it 's probably different population numbers between wiki and wolfram .

  considering you 're talking about retaking karelia by waging a war on russia i 'd say you 'd be in the country with the least chances ( if you 're from finland ) considering you 'd be the direct target of hydrogen bombs , and that shit leaves no survivors . 
  and even if you survived finland would be uninhabitable for a couple of centuries . 
  so , please , do n't take war so lightly , it 's not what you think of it , it 's 1000x times worse . 
  but it is true , i 'm not making it up for fun , so not sure why people downvote my previous post , but whatever . 
  what / u/butlerianjihadist said is true , merkel says , vu\u010di\u0107 ( our pm ) does . 
  he supports merkel 's statements , her actions , executes her `` suggestions '' . 
  during the refugee crisis we played the biggest role in the balkan and transported and housed the most refugees ( after greece ) and even when hungary closed the borders we didnt . 
  during the crisis our pm said he will not stop supporting and `` cooperating '' with merkel/germany even if he was the last country official to do so . 
  there are far more examples , of course , but lets keep it short, 
  it 's from september 2013 . 
  if you think our politicians would be eurosceptic in eu you 're wrong . 
  everyone here knows the germans are pulling strings in our political scene . 
  funnily we showed far more compliement to the migrant crisis solution than most of the eu members despite we did n't need to . 
  so yeah , if you do n't want us in the eu maybe your officials should stop navigating our politicians towards it , and towards nato agreements and movement permissions etc, 
  serbia and montenegro/macedonia/greece / romania/rs/slovenia ( + hungary as it 's our northern neighbour but not in the balkans ) have really good and friendly relations . 
  with others it 's mostly neutral to dislike . 
  since you 're too lazy to spend 3 seconds and google `` sajmi\u0161te '' i 'll explain it to you . 
  sajmi\u0161te is a camp in serbia that was used by croatian `` usta\u0161e '' and german nazis to kill serbs , not the other way around . 
  serbia is never mentioned as the only `` ethnically cleansed state in europe '' , no idea what the fuck are you talking about . 
  so i suggest you start googling things before making dumb statements . 
  ww2 serbia ???? 
  if you mean that serbs had been ethnically cleansed in ww2 , then yes . 
  is it just me or the last question is basically the bbc saying `` uk does n't belong with the rest of the countries '' ? 
  well i 'm not saying all inclusive are better than regular hotels , i 'm just saying that turksih all inclusive are better than spanish/greek ones . 
  and yes i do agree greece has a lot to offer so it 's not really favorable to you to expand the all inclusive business , but my point is that there some people who specifically want good all inclusive service for fair money , and that 's why they choose turkey . 
  and that 's why i 'm saying it . 
  other countries have them too , but they 're nowhere near in terms of quality . 
  turks are famous for their all invclusive hotel resorts that are far away from cities and have basically everything . 
  greece has similar hotels , but they dont really compare in prices or quality . 
  greece mostly relies on tourist villages that offer breakfast at best . 
  dont get me wrong i love greece but just saying its different from turkey, 
  turkey offers a unique type of service spain and greece really do n't . 
  it 's `` sve\u017ee '' in serbian, 
  it looks sketchy as fuck, 
  does svie\u017eios mean fresh in lithuanian ? 
  then would n't russia top the chart ? 
  and even if it 's not taken into the consideration by the report , would n't latvia be there too ? 
  since it has the highest % of russian population of all european countries besides russia . 
  my guess is that this is a statistical anomaly caused by estonia 's low population and a new drug being popular at the moment . 
  in a year or two im sure the numbers would get more average, 
  aw fuck you beat me to it, 
  too bad the state is n't doing much to preserve them . 
  i 've visited kosma\u010d fortress above budva , and it 's overgrown and slowly crumbling . 
  sometimes the time it 'd take to innovate something to enhance the productivity would take too long . 
  that 's the reason germany received millions of immigrants after ww2, 
  this thread actually shows how little people know about socialism, 
  your comment is so full of flaws i dont even know which one should i argue with, 
  a lot of our schools have that as well, 
  so you find yourself to be closer to white americans than brown germans ? 
  check `` pisana cirilicna slova '' its cursive cyrilic and its pretty af, 
  nope . 
  people just prefer latin i guess . 
  overall people are a lot more exposed to latin script and its used way more so therefore it became the go to script . 
  also a lot of people would argue cyrilic standard font is ugly as fuck and kinda badly pixelated . 
  those ppl that write in cyrilic ( me among others ) write in cursive which is very smooth and good looking . 
  standard is just so wide and ugly, 
  you can use whichever you want . 
  in casual writing they 're used about the same , but in media latin is much more used . 
  like 95 % of the times . 
  the only time you 're required to use cyrilic is in state administration ( dealing with court , letters from the state and such ) usage of latinica on the internet is about 99 % though . 
  phonetically they have the same numbers of letters which correspond to the phonemes . 
  same spelling as well . 
  so if you learn writing in serbian latin , it would take you around 5 min to learn the cyrilic letters and you 'd be rdy to write in cyrilic too . 
  so 99 % of the times its a matter of personal preference which one will you use, 
  you 're kinda blowing it up , there are only a couple of damaged buildings , you 're making it sound like there are in every street, 
  well that 's true . 
  good luck saving it !, 
  still does n't change the fact the title is incorrect, 
  they registered here recently , but it will only be in couple of months they 'll open the stores , as they 're , for some reason , opening them all at the same time . 
  so we 'll have to wait a bit more :(, 
  the ones ive seen were 1.20 ish $, 
  lidl 's opening this year in lithuania too ? 
  it 's not the last european ancient forest . 
  there is one in montenegro and bih respectively , that i know of . 
  probably a few more, 
  but in the media it 's represented as `` radical islamist terrorist attacked paris '' , not as `` belgian nationals attacked paris '' . 
  how do you know it 's a she ? 
  belgrade may have old buildings , that are n't painted regularly but it 's far from dilapidated, 
  well im more surprised it doesnt include waterpolo, 
  to follow up on this , their debt is also in their currency , so as a last resort of a crisis they could experience , they could print out a lot of money and effectively lower their debt . 
  the population wouldnt be too happy about it though , but in a long term it would save their economy . 
  that 's true , but it 's kind of a chicken and egg thing . 
  though , i 'd say hebrew names were hebrew before they have become biblical . 
  and i 'd call biblical names , the ones that were mentioned in the bible , but are not of hebrew origin .
