  53 days `` floyddit dick eating bet on french election . '', 
  because if you were younger he could ad hominem you as he does n't have a good counter argument . 
  it 's just futile to argue with someone who whataboutisms something completely irrelevant into the discussion just because he feels he has the upper hand in that subject . 
  please , do n't drag me into replying to you further . 
  alright we 're done here, 
  are you really gon na be salty about this ? 
  my country fucked things up in kosovo - we got bombed . 
  your country fucked up your economy - now you get to live in crysis . 
  my first post was to show there are countries having shittier economy than your own , despite running it better . 
  no , but serbia got bombed as a result anyway . 
  same goes for the rest of eastern european countries , except we did n't borrow money we knew we could n't return, 
  pretty much everyone in balkans own a washing machine . 
  something tells me she doesnt have the passport stamp to back that up, 
  i am not , he edited his post . 
  okay since people are very quick to downvote instead of using brains , here ; if ** x  y ** , x being ukraine 's gdp , y being luxembourgs it does n't mean ** 1/99 * x  y ** . 
  the only way that would 've been correct is if ukraine 's gdp per capita was higher becuase you said ukraine had 100 times the population so if you lowered it to luxembourgs population the only way ukraine wouldnt be on the list would be if their gdp per capita was higher . 
  god fucking damnit this sub is dumb . 
  you didnt understand me . 
  2 languages with only 4-5 million joint speakers comprising a single `` language family '' with slavic languages , spoken by over 300 million people never made sense to me either . 
  romania has 2-3 times more population tho, 
  special money transaction services for the rich people . 
  if you know what i mean ... 
  that 's not how it works because per capitas are n't equal . 
  the us would kick baltic countries out before turkey so there 's no discussion here really, 
  content insights for serbia , gjirafa.com for albania . 
  content insights is the serbian one, 
  yes , but they 're not an eu member, 
  they probably will collect a decent amount of people 's test to create a more correct statistic . 
  yes , but i could also have the 20 minutes reading something interesting instead of explaining some thats been talked about here dozens of times, 
  you asked why is it misleading i answered why . 
  i do n't have time for people asking me to elaborate in hopes i do n't know a lot about it and therefore `` killing '' my argument . 
  that was enough to answer your question . 
  you can check for more info online , there are * plenty * of sources . 
  because it 's not the ** effective ** tax rate . 
  luxembourg , netherlands and ireland are the tax havens in europe , yet if you take raw rate ( which also seem to be messed up in this map ) you get misleading info that nl and lux pay more tax than most of european countries . 
  misleading map . 
  construction workers having to ** speak ** french at all times is very different from construction workers ** understanding ** french . 
  if you hired , say , spanish construction companies to build something and they bring all spanish workers , it makes no sense for them to speak french it only makes things more complicated . 
  you must be new here then , ethnicity is discussed very often :p, 
  people who have the us citizenship tend to just call themselves americans despite their background . 
  it 's not like ethnicity in europe . 
  tell that to the other guy , not me who 's criticizing it :p, 
  a high percentage of programmers in the usa are immigrants from india , china , japan , taiwan etc. 
  so his native language might 've not been english . 
  you may wan na take a seat ... 
  idk if something changed recently or you 're badly informed but weed is rather cheap here compared to the west . 
  not problematic to find either , if you know the people, 
  they produce it in albania but sell it here :p, 
  `` in the last 30 days '' i guess people just do n't smoke that often, 
  ah yes , alentejo , the european silicon valley, 
  this sub is hyperbolic when it comes to estonia, 
  she most definitely looks more french than central european lol . 
  keep them coming . 
  i guess the jokes about bosnians hold some merit after all . 
  [ dis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7ovpjplj_8 ) one is najs, 
  on one hand i think the song is pure pop garbage but on the other i ca n't help how catchy it is . 
  help . 
  ah so you take first half of my sentence which is obviously a context for the next part and answer to it to prove a point , which is also not correct . 
  we both konw i meant the bosniak ethnicity is based on those people who accepted the muslim faith in order to live an easier life in the ottoman empire . 
  but since you ca n't argue in a logical manner do not even bother replying anymore . 
  have a nice evening, 
  people are always the most defensive towards the things they fear to be true , 
  because men are typically more ambitious and are more capable of machiavellian tactics to achieve them . 
  typically , of course . 
  serbs are also majorily i group, 
  so you think 70 % greece and 4 % sweden is legit ? 
  5 % netherlands but 30 % spain ? 
  that statistic is somehow badly conducted . 
  most of the antisemitism i witness was actually from people in the western europe . 
  ( coincidental , i know , but still ) e : okay i just checked other countries and the more i check the more map seems random . 
  thing you linked only tested people in eastern europe . 
  and 44 % for serbia seems like an enormous bullshit, 
  high homicide rate ? 
  or more like a little statistical body and sample . 
  eh what ? 
  april fool 's day lasts for two days this year, 
  so this subreddit criticizes us for having having such a heavy police presence at these things , while other countries dont even hold the parade . 
  lets face it , this sub is biased . 
  nah writing in cyrilic cursive is so much easier and faster that its a reason enough to keep it, 
  em how about the fact its used in a fair amount of places , signs ? 
  it obviously has a use . 
  so whats your point of `` they broke off yugoslavia without a single drop of blood '' ? 
  it implied breaking off would result in a war . 
  serbian is a majority language in mne though, 
  whats the downside of learning something that can be learnt in literally an hour ? 
   but the situation is better than greece or serbia idk , south of serbia sure , but north , most definitely not . 
   was a really nice nightclub my friend showed me probably top hill . 
  super expensive though . 
   do n't vacation there because it 's very undeveloped for tourism - go to greece instead ( and then we went to halkidiki , which seems to be completely undeveloped for tourism and filled with serbs ) greece is generally more developed for tourism than montenegro . 
  i do n't think you understand yugoslavian wars if you think the blood was spilled simply because countries were breaking off . 
  i think not ? 
   about 20 % are state employees and their families forced to vote for them and 20 % are genuine support and forced to declare their ethnicity as montenegrin, 
   not sure , but my tribe was the one of the more troublesome to ottomans , not paying taxes and stuff , so there was a lot of clashes uskoci/drobnjaci ? 
   sand\u017eak is not a an administrative division , it 's only a geographic area . 
  federal republic *, 
  ironic considering you live in a country where people are more likely to be shot by policemen because they 're black . 
   comitative - with a beautiful girl my favorite case, 
  props to italy for remaining a contributor despite having economical problems . 
   plus , please take note that , according to the un , the baltic countries are officially northern european , not eastern . 
  people sound so insecure when they say this lol,
