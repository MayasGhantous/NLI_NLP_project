  especially dark if you know the context . 
  serbia : food , alcohol , cigarettes . 
  enough said , really . 
  ah yes the austrian influence . 
  because slovenians are so inherently regressive that the only reason they 're being progressive is because of the austrians , right ? 
  your logic is ridiculous . 
  moldova is not in the balkans, 
  but you included malta , which is smaller than andorra ? 
  more familiar to people : \u0111 - g in italian buon ** g ** iorno \u0107 - c in italian ** c ** iao, 
  montenegrin is a minority language in montenegro , though . 
  it 's actually not . 
  i am just adding a predecessor and applying the same logic to us . 
  actually if he meant per capita he wasnt very wrong . 
  the most of yugoslavias losses which was well over a million were serbs . 
  im tired of explaining , i do n't care . 
  the deal is , i 'm not . 
  i 've seen this graph before , i read a report inwhich it was used so i know what it is about . 
  while the persons i 'm arguing are seeing it for the first time and do n't even know what the legend of the lines is . 
  i mean , the legend of the map is literally `` centuries since divergence '' . 
  but you can continue downvoting me , even though i read the report in which a very similar map was used . 
  actually i 'm done with this thread . 
  it 's like arguing with 12 year olds not listening to reason . 
  trust me , i 'm not . 
  what you 're refering to is called `` lexical similarities '' . 
  how do you explain english being closer to icelandic than to french ? 
  common ancestor connection , which this map is entirely about . 
  english has far more similar vocabulary to french than icelandic , yet it 's closer to icelandic because their common ancestor , proto-germanic is younger than english and french common ancestor - indo european . 
  if you look at the lines it shows what i said . 
  i mean the `` closer than greek '' part because i do n't see the map showing dutch being closer to greek than to scandi langauges . 
  the map is just fine , it 's just you misunderstanding it . 
  split the proto indo european languages ( so , all of them , except for hun , est and fin ) into 1 group . 
  let 's call that group a. 
  now , split uralic languages into another group . 
  let 's call that group b. 
  now , notice how group b languages have all same type of the link towards the a group languages . 
  it means that languages from b group split from all of the a group 's ones at the same time . 
  that time was when uralic and pie split from their common ancestor . 
  it does n't matter which languages are uralic connected to in this map , because they 're all equally connected to every language from pie . 
  uralic languages are equally connected to , german and to greek for example . 
  it 's like , your uncle children are same thing to you , cousins . 
  they share a common ancestor with one another closer than with you . 
  their father ( your uncle ) . 
  while you and them share a common ancestor - your grandfather . 
  now replace your cousins with swedish , german , lithuanian . 
  finnish , estonian and hungarian are finno-ugric language , none of them has ever ` split ' from swedish , latvian or ukrainian . 
  makes no sense because map is n't suggesting they did , it suggest how much time has passed since they had a common ancestor as i explained above . 
  itt people misunderstanding the map . 
  it does n't matter , this map is n't showing vocabulary similarities . 
  german words in estonian are loan-words . 
   i would have expected dutch to be a bit closer to the scandinavian languages . 
   certainly closer than greek . 
  it is though ? 
  you 're misinterpreting the map . 
  the map does n't show how much of the vocabulary is shared - it shows the time when the languages have split from a common ancestor . 
  german words in estonian are loan words . 
  estonian and german are very different languages that do n't share a family . 
  edit : love this sub downvoting me even though i 'm correct . 
  no , because the arab men wear [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thawb ) which covers head similarly to hijabs . 
  we 're talking about head scarves here , not burkas . 
  there 's no point really as some countries do n't have their sub geo-defaulted while some do . 
  / r/serbia is n't default for people from serbia for example, 
   our culture of not forcing women to wear pieces of clothing they do n't want is superior , fullstop . 
   any self-respecting western politician women should not accept to degrade herself by being forced to cover up . 
  what if there was a culture where they wore no clothes at all . 
  would you find it fair to force them to wear clothes to cover up their naked bodies while vising europe ? 
  just applying your logic, 
  true , but from the context i think it 's clear what i meant . 
   this is just awful article from the west to make us seem evil etc. 
   i do n't really think that , but the article * is * harsher compared to the ones written when similar things happened in the uk and italy . 
  not really ? 
  people of same language and language families definitely share a lot of genetics . 
  hitler basically considered everyone subhuman , but people 's who were his allies he proclaimed to be ( honorary ) aryans ( japanese , finns , croats ) . 
  his ideology was based on geopolitcs he was leading , not other way around . 
  hundreds of thousands of slav children were abducted by the nazis to be raised as germans . 
  that was n't the case with romas , jews . 
   medal per competition is what i said . 
  i 'm saying that some countries participated while there were far less contestants . 
  it 's easier to win medals when you have to beat 20 other countries than 100 . in the 1960s , 70s and 80s there were only a handful of countries participating compared to 2000s . 
  not trying to undermine romania 's results of course , but just saying the stats are a bit skewed for countries that participated since the beginning . 
  example : romania has almost the same medal per competition as the usa , despite usa having 300million people to compared to romania 's 20m . 
  yes but , there is a bit of statistical corruption regarding a few countries . 
  romania had been in every imo so far , and has won a lot of medals in the first ones . 
  imo was started by countries from warwaw pact so for a while it used to have only ~ 10 contestants, 
  between croatia and romania , probably . 
  the last time we took the tests we were 3 spots under croatia and 2 above romania . 
  sure , there are people like that . 
  but there are people like that everywhere . 
  point is that our good mathmaticians are good even compared to other countries ' . 
  9 gold medals in 11 participations to be exact . 
  also 19 silver and 24 bronze . 
  it 's a pretty good score for a 7million people country ( and considering it 's pretty much 1 school doing most of the work ) https://www.imo-official.org/country_info.aspx?code=srb, 
  it 's not serbian language , for sure . 
  a little info though about that guy 's link : it 's a radio station playing almost exclusively foreign electronic/dance/house / pop music . 
  i guess we should 've learnt from your ancestors ' example . 
  your extermination rate is impressive . 
  no one cares about kosovo . 
  those who recognized it did because they are western aligned , those who did n't have their own reasoning . 
  i like how you have the whole `` holier than thou '' thing going on while making an ad hominem argument . 
  yes ik , i 've been arguing with him a lot of times during the last few weeks , and i 've picked up his anti-serb sentiment . 
  but it 's a forum so i might as well be the one that made a meaningful post with clarifications instead of flinging shit like he does .
