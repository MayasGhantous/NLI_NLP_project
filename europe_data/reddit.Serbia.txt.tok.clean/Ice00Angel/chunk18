  someone might be interested in some history :p, 
  i mean , if you were n't trolling you would know no one went to become a jannissary voluntarily . 
  the people who did not want to convert to islam during the ottoman reign had to pay [ devshirme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/devshirme ) which is a blood tax . 
  young christian boys were taken from their homes by force to serve in the jannissary army . 
  the boys were of all christian ethnicities , so janissaries were equally greek , bulgarian , romanian and serbian , while bosniaks/albanians were spared because they changed their religion . 
  and for siege of constantinople , that is one of the rare times we `` sided '' with them and that 's only because we recently got conquered by them and were forced into submission . 
  our ruler had no chance because if he had n't sent the help of 1500 soldiers they 'd massacre us . 
  out of all balkan people serbs are ** definitely ** the ones that had the most uprisings and wars against the ottomans , so you saying what you did is kind of offensive . 
  you can check everything on wiki , especially `` serbian ottoman wars '' page . 
  well i guess we 'll see how it turns out . 
  macedonia is probably next in line , after kosovo . 
  with the support of the usa administration , * any * country can be significant . 
  it 's an internet meme in which kebab represents muslims , more specifically ottomans which serbs fought for over 4-5 centuries . 
  we 'll decide later . 
  there 's a plenty to choose from :d, 
  i agree , but you seem not to realize that their end goal is uniting in 1 country . 
  the game plan will only change when the current `` check point '' gets completed - kosovo independence . 
  what were you doing in serbia in 1999 ? 
  lmao, 
  just curious though , what makes you think kosovo would n't be allowed to join albania ? 
  http://prnt.sc/e8u362 so , besides being considered stupid , you 're gon na act stupid too ? 
   kosovo will never be allowed to join albania , wan na bet ? 
  ] ( http://prnt.sc/e8u362 ) da uzvrate jer je crna ruka svoj prvi post nazvao tipa `` beautiful scenery from rep. srpska '' . 
  zatim je nastao ovaj post , tako sto je ovaj poster nakon besomucnog spamovanja u crnarukinom tredu `` bosnia & hercegovina is sure a nice country x10 '' uzeo isti album crna rukinog posta i postovao ga sa naslovom `` scenes from bosnia and herzegovina '' . 
  the problem is - we 're never gon na get this deal offered . 
  the only way we could theoretically get the offer is for exchange of a small part of serbia proper where albanians are majority . 
  this deal would be offered only to make it look as if we 're killing the cooperation because they 'd know we ca n't ever accept giving away serbia proper . 
  because if we do , our territorial integrity is dead . 
  i agree on most stuff but albanians look different a bit . 
  they have a bit of that greek/mediterranean look and i can often discern them . 
   well i do n't reccomend missing out on their language , i think it sounds/looks really pretty . 
   finally some deserved recognition, 
  the [ skull tower ] ( https://shesnotpedallingontheback.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-skull-tower-nis.jpg ) that 's been posted here a few times was made during this uprising , in 1809 . 
   the battle of \u010cegar ( serbian : \u0411\u0438\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0427\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0443 / bitka na \u010cegru ) , also known as the battle of kamenica ( \u0411\u043e\u0458 \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438 / boj na kamenici ) was a battle of the first serbian uprising between the serbian revolutionaries and ottoman forces near the ni\u0161 fortress on 31 may 1809 . 
  fought on the \u010cegar hill situated between the villages of donji matejevac and kamenica near ni\u0161 in what is today southeastern serbia , it ended in an ottoman victory . 
  commander stevan sin\u0111eli\u0107 famously blew up the gunpowder magazine when the ottomans overtook his trench , killing every one in it . 
  skulls of dead serb rebels were embedded into the skull tower . 
  any answer different from [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njtmtsxts_i ) is incorrect !, 
  i 've told you numerous times but i guess you 're too dense . 
  seems we 'll be having a cold one . 
  the point is , i see plenty of posts titled as `` scenes from sicily/transylvania/bavaria / scotland/brettany/california / florida/etc '' but none of those has a surging national pride expat throwing a displeased 8 year old fit posting `` italy/romania/germany / uk/france/usa / etc are nice country '' about 10 times in a single thread while the discord pirates fanatically upvote . 
  i 'm done . 
  and p.s. 
  having friends from rs , i can tell you no one sees themselves as a bosnian . 
  no one from the whole bih does , actually . 
  i only now realized how immature [ you are ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5u2mf7/scenes_from_bosnia_and_herzegovina/ ) . 
  have fun beating your head against the wall over this , dear american-croatian-bosniak-bosnian . 
  1 . serbia goes for the eu integration path 2 . 
  `` ok nice but they have to recognize kosovo '' 3 . 
  eu has geopolitics policies which are against our own 4 . serbs start being less pro eu and more pro russia 5 . elections : pro-eu parties win by a big margin 6 . serbian politicians make statements about continuing the eu path while still doing dialogues with kosovo 7 . serbia wo n't sanction russia as we have good relations with them , we 're not in the eu therefore no obligations for it and we only have to lose . 
  `` serbia is a russian trojan horse we should never let them in '' this is so far my experience on this sub . 
  an entity with an anthem , flag , coat of arms , its own police force , supreme court , lower courts , tax regulations , administration , president , executive government , postal service , ** constitution ** , capital , national holidays , national day , borders . 
  also whatever it is , this picture is taken in republika srpska , just as [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/empire_state_building_by_david_shankbone_crop.jpg/800px-empire_state_building_by_david_shankbone_crop.jpg ) is taken in new york . 
  well are you not ? 
  you 're spamming `` bih is a beautiful country '' and acting as if republika srpska does n't exist , even though it 's very real and pretty close to being a different country . 
  either you 're ignorant or immature . 
  discordapp.com something similar to irc . 
  only if they 're a nigerian prince, 
  bosniaks are organizing a brigade on a discord server because of the rep srpska post . 
  well check his flair . 
  `` croatian bosniak in the states '' . 
  a balkanite in the states is literally the most ignorant one can be about this topic . 
  she is a professional skier and the guy they accuse of being at fault is her professional team doctor . 
  so their `` neither of us knew it contained forbidden substances '' despite it having a logo on the packaging that says so , is a really weak excuse but it 's the only one that possibly saves her carrier . 
  oh , i misread your quotation in the post . 
  i mean , are n't western countries selling weapons to saudis too ? 
   she was not deliberately taking performance enhancing drugs , but she used a cream to treat some lip-sores that contained steroids on the doping list haha yeah sure . 
  eh what do you mean by look down ? 
  oh boy this thread 's gon na be good, 
  green spot in serbia is definitely well populated . 
  holy fuck the quality of it is actually better than google.maps, 
  he is n't . 
  i bet you have an erectile dysfunction . 
  not serbs from serbia . 
  ah yes , the 10 serbs on this sub definitely made this happen / s, 
  idk , greek grey economy is definitely bigger than ours . 
  recieving a receipt in greece is kind of rare , while in serbia i get receipts even in the village stores, 
  sweden yes !, 
  your county genocided hundreds of native american cultures . 
  now what ? 
  there are numerous reasons why this is a very bad idea . 
  kosovo thing is already tightening up the relations but if serbia proper gets gutted as well , it will trigger the same thing versailles did for the germans . 
  ehh i expected higher : /, 
  i think you 're onto something . 
  we should ban the east - that will solve a lot of problems . 
  i would love to see how the situation would play out if albanians in the west proclaimed independence - what would be fyrom 's stance . 
  he 's one of yours , buddy :p, 
  speaking of coffee in this post , is n't the starbacks a bit to the right along the coast on the picture ? 
  oh well thank god we changed that lol . 
  57 % upvoted . 
  if this speech was delivered by schultz it would 've been 90 % + surely . 
  bureaucracy, 
  serbian and croatian are different because they tend to use old slavic words for shit while we follow latin changes for some stuff and have a bit more foreign words . 
  it used to be called the same in serbia too , i think , but just like how most of the languages started using latin names so did we . 
  booo, 
  lol i had no idea about the bulgarian part . 
  here we even have a ` joke ' that goes something along the lines of : `` never turn your back on a bulgarian '' hah, 
  some people here who are gasping at irelands `` magical gdp growth '' do n't realize that if their uncle tod working in a foreign county is a millionaire does not mean shit for them if he does n't share , despite their family 's high average wealth . 
  they 're downvoting you because you 're wrong . 
  the numbers are pretty much the same,
