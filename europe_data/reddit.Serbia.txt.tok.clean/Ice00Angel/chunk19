  that 's kinda misleading because most of the casualties in yugoslavia were serbs . 
  comparatively between the countries the numbers would still be similar . 
  those with the higher % in this map would have higher decline of childbirth , obviously . 
  lol, 
  not in 1913 we did n't, 
  our history classes do n't really lie - some stuff where we fucked up big time are just sugarcoated and/or omitted . 
  for example we never really learnt anything about the 90s wars , the fact we had a nazi regime during the occupation is left aside a bit , internal politics clusterfuck in pre ww2 yugoslavia , how chetniks went as far to collaborate with the nazis just because the partisans had the better shot of getting in power after the liberation are not mentioned a lot . 
  they sent an ultimatum to investigate it in our territory . 
  that 's comparable to a pole killing a russian high official in belarus and then russia asking poland to step on its sovereignty by allowing their agents to operate freely in poland with no proof whatsoever the government of serbia was involved . 
  so we refused , obviously . 
  also note that princip was n't a serbian citizen , instead he was from bosnia which austria recently annexed at the time . 
  and germany and bulgaria, 
  how much are the tickets atm ? 
  tbh the garbage content are the news articles as well . 
  ah so everyone is allowed to arm up besides us . 
  get it . 
  you realize nato would not sell us their planes right?and that we cant even afford them . 
  do n't be stupid, 
  we do commemorate it but not celebrate . 
  you probably are mixing it up with vidovdan which falls on the same day as the kosovo battle, 
  ali te\u017eak neki problem, 
   hungary really does n't get the credit it deserves regarding fighting the ottoman empire we do n't either : /, 
  [ get on our level ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/paso%c5%a1_srbije.jpg ), 
  residency is n't that `` important '' here . 
  a lot of people live at different places than the ones they 're officially residing in . 
  now a lot of montenegrins live in serbia and they had to give up montenegrin citizenship because getting working visa is n't that easy . 
  if dual was allowed they 'd be signed to reside in montenegro but would still work in serbia and live here . 
  it 's not any kind of fraud despite sounding like that - the montenegrins in serbia just love montenegro a lot and would not gave up ties unless they had to , meanwhile they do n't like milo ( the guy in power for 25 continuous years ) very much . 
  source : a know a lot of people in that situation , by lot i mean dozens . 
  a big reason montenegro does n't allow it is because all the montenegrins living in serbia holding serbian citizenship would vote against the ruling party were they dual citizens, 
  what does that picture have to do with communism ? 
  sweden was n't in the eastern block lmao, 
  looking at that map ( unrelated to the post ) - i noticed i 've never seen anyone here with a lichtenstein flair, 
  because people go for the best value for price products . 
  if serbian products are sold in kosovo it obviously means the competition products are n't good enough to overcome them . 
  consumer market has very little to do with patriotism . 
  strong currency hurts exports the most, 
  ah that explains why a lot of serbian products have the notations in albanian too, 
   how will these countries cope ? 
  they wo n't because rising the minimum wage overnight is n't possible for private sector . 
  public sector could be managable by going further into debt but private companies will have to fire a lot of people or close their business . 
  black market workers would increase in numbers and they will once again work for low salaries . 
  foreign companies will retract their business because for some of them the main reason for staying were the low salaries . 
  even more jobs lost . 
  the country would need to make a miraculous feat of improving the economy by increasing the spending of the `` newly acquired money '' ( loaned ) and somehow try to empower the industry , financial sector etc which would later pay teh taxes to return the loans from . 
  couple of possible scenarios ps im tired as fuck so forgive me if something makes no sense, 
  geopolitics expert here, 
   montenegro is far ahead actually they 're not . 
  and does calling other countries with good relations with them puppets protect you ? 
  or you know , your opinion is n't the only legitimate one and other opinions than your own can be nested in other people 's minds . 
  [ hyde park , belgrade ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/hyde_park%2c_belgrade_03.jpg/1280px-hyde_park%2c_belgrade_03.jpg ), 
  tbh politics is not a theme we talk about in serbia . 
  you might even hang out with a putin fanboi and never know of it . 
  posting about politics on the social network also never happens . 
  we all chill out and do n't give a shit about views of others . 
  not a rare thing to have pro-nato , pro-eu , pro-russia , anti-eu people at the same table because we typically do n't give a shit about that outside the internet . 
  some older people do like talking about politics , but it 's mostly about our internal politics . 
   daily dose of how all around were ** nazi ** and ussr were the only ** good guys ** propaganda . 
  we dont know the candidates yet apart from those who said they will run . 
  if jeremic candidates he stands the best chances, 
  nah the comments in our newspapers on this news are very critical , everyone is telling him to basically fuck off and that they wont send their children to fight a war . 
  the only thing keeping him relevant is that he will probably be supported by our pm, 
  the candidates are still not all known , and campaigns still havent started . 
  but i 'd like to see vuk jeremic be our president, 
  how long did it take one way ? 
  idk which polls you saw but i dont know anyone who will vote for him, 
  not liking russia is alright but being delusional about it isnt, 
  not saying everyone needs to know of it , but its hard to spend at least some time on the web and not to hear of her, 
  ignore our president now , he 's pulling stunts because the elections are near and he has no real chance to win, 
  dont worry we do . 
  no one here agrees with him , no one is considering war and no one thinks the train thing was a good idea . 
  the elections are near so hes pulling stunts because he stands no chance to win, 
  the title is edited ? 
  we wont, 
  that 's not the biggest of japanese worries . 
  their worse problems are their aging population and the failing tech industry . 
  software and smartphones are the strongest tech trees right now , not tvs and cameras which got them up there . 
  even in tvs , samsung and lg are smothering the japanese . 
  apple , samsung and the chinese companies are killing sony in sales as well . 
  south korea and taiwan are taking a lot of microprocessor business from japan too . 
  ca n't tell if you 're joking or not lol, 
  do n't mean to be rude , but where the hell have you been living for 2 years ?

  `` is n't this girl bulgarian ? 
  dobrev sounds bulgarian / i heard she is '' `` uh , idk let 's check '', 
  i 'd let her suck me dry, 
  not necessarily - check some sub saharan countries , like mali who have had a lot of famines in the 20th ( and even in 21st ) century and you 'll notice their height figures are only slightly lower than american ones, 
  i know n. korea is n't the best country , but you ca n't deduce who is their most fed soldier , or how they feed their soldiers off of 1 picture . 
  north and south korea are only split for 60-70 years , one generation of sparse nutrition can not cause big physiological differences , so if you think this picture represents the real difference between south and north koreans you 're ** very ** wrong . 
  i do n't typically remember names from here , but i do remember yours , as a flaming serb hater lol, 
  or because they enlist more soldiers without the policy, 
  well i guess we have different interpretations of names , probably because we share most of ours with some countries, 
  5 eu countries , cant you read ? 
  romania : [ 20 seconds of beauty ] ( https://youtu.be/jkocrmyky1w?t=164 ), 
  yup . 
  being closer to rich countries is always a good thing . 
  not like apple payed 0.005 % tax in ireland for years ... and numerous companies there have a similar deal, 
  and the whole tax haven thing, 
   you estonians outperform pretty much everyone in eastern europe . 
  what 's your secret sauce ?
