  i do think it 's baltic , because that 's how it 's classified . 
  just as italy is mediterranean . 
  but on the other hand i think estonia differs from the other 2 baltic countries just as finland differs from the other nordic countries . 
  that does n't mean either ca n't be grouped up in their respective regions . 
  you 're trying to argue estonia is nordic just because it 's not baltic right now . 
  it does n't matter what makes it baltic , it matters that not enough makes it nordic , and that no one will every recognize it as nordic . 
  that team is already selected . 
  i 've actually read it , and the whole arguments estonia has , and i personally think they 're not compelling . 
  sorry but it 's not about how estonians feel , it 's about how it 's recognized by everyone else : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baltic_states https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_countries, 
  i do n't think flying cars will ever really be a thing . 
  they 're too impractical . 
  but hyper tubes , really fast bullet trains and similar will probably start getting popular in 10ish years . 
  i like the app idea . 
  is there something similar for english/german ? 
  lindt is swiss . 
  serbia being anti nato is completely true . 
  serbia being anti - eu is n't true . 
  it 's just that those people who are anti-eu and pro russian are ** very ** vocal about it . 
  edit : i just do n't understand why does this subreddit give so much attention to this topic ? 
  every week there is a post similar to this one . 
  wtf dude ? 
  why are you forcing something that 's simply not true ? 
  estonia is not nordic , deal with it . 
  thats far from true ... not even politicians talk about it . 
  our favorite european nations arent even slavic . 
  sorry to disappoint you but your view is probably built anecdotally . 
  besides that , it wasnt serbians who were the most into pan slavism at all , check on wikipedia . 
  how is that stereotypical ? 
  oops , i 'm really horrible at blind typing the numbers, 
  it 's 2015 people , i ca n't believe you 're still using gdp to represent anything . 
  dubbed content is so shit ... ca n't believe it 's still being made . 
  admittedly though , few cartoon shows can be dubbed nicely ( our spongebob is really good as dubbed ) , but shows with actors , no way, 
  huh , i never knew slavs played a significant role in austrian genetics . 
  thanks for the detailed post, 
  i 'm not sure i understand this post correctly , can you please elaborate ? 
  he did it for the memes : ^ ), 
  well that user is bosnian , so he ca n't really be biased , can he . 
  get down from your high horse , croatian hague crew is n't any better . 
  i 'd say the number is closer to 50 . the notes you get from the atm is rarely unused/new, 
  oh man , i fucking hate tipping . 
  it puts you in a weird position . 
  they should just increase waiters ' salaries and drink costs so we can get it over with, 
  tbh , contrary to what people in this sub think , serbians do n't really hate , care or talk about albanians and kosovo in general . 
  few people here and there sure , but every country has them . 
  it 's only on reddit that i 'm reminded of the whole kosovo thing , and tensions towards it and albanians, 
  though his bot army wouldnt downvote this , he 's all about `` peace , love and stability '' in the region now . 
  would you think they would admit it is radioactive after using it ? 
  kinda obvious they 'd deny . 
  not implying anything though , but i understand why they 'd lie about it . 
  who is bringing cetniks in this conversation ? 
  are you brain dead or just opsessed with them ? 
  im sorry , but how is serbs not wanting to be a part of mess country bih any different from bosniaks not wanting to be part of yugoslavia ? 
  it goes both ways . 
  bosnia can get independance from yugo but rep srp cant from bih ? 
  thats kinda ironic , dont you think, 
  you live across the world in australia , but you sure know the best whats happening in bih !, 
  yep . 
  if ch gets shot up again i hope someone makes something similar about them, 
  had to explain because i know few catholics that that didnt at all understand difference between calendars, 
  ive heard this thing is done by hungarian border police on romanian and ukranian borders too, 
  police internal controle is actually quite decent now . 
  well , are you ? 
   tfw eu has worse border guards than serbia, 
  he is actually correct . 
  bernie 's tax policies are greatly biased towards the poorer people while trump 's are towards middle class and the rich, 
  east asian countries literally fail at the conditions you listed . 
  so do australia and canada . 
  and lets cut the crap , sweden is probably safer than at least half thr countries you listed . 
  just because they are liberal and have a lot of muslims doesnt make them unsafe, 
  there is no `` catholic '' and `` orthodox '' easters , its the same holiday celebrated at the different dates as every country is using gregorian calender , but not every church is . 
  did you forget a / s at the end ? 
  why ? 
  does being `` western '' suddenly make you better or something ? 
  do n't be a fucking insensitive retard , maybe you did n't give a fuck , but most of the people were scared shitless when they heard the sirens every day . 
   the special bond between serbia and france died these days . 
  yeah , france 's popularity here had a 180 degrees turn after ' 99 . 
  though serbs hate the uk and the netherlands more because they bombed with a lot of cluster bombs . 
  i 'm pretty sure the world is of italian origin . 
  so is \u0107ao ( ciao ), 
  oh , thats a great analogy . 
  thanks, 
  best - norway and iceland worst - ukraine, 
  serbia ? 
  i thought our flag was just a red-blue-white tri color in the sea of many similar ones, 
  if you do n't count only country flags there is bound to be a flag of a province/city/whatever older than 1150 . 
  also i heard scottish flag is from 9th century . 
  in serbia it 's used for both . 
  no , i actually like posters from the usa and canada posting about their culture/country . 
  it gives a nice perspective and comparison to the topic . 
  though i do hate certain posters acting as if they know european history and culture better than we do . 
  depends . 
  if you 're into skiing you can also come in winter . 
  but all around tour of montenegro is definitely the best during the summer . 
  you can save yourself from the summer heat in the mountains at the beginning of the tour and after you 're done with the north ( mountainous part ) you can go to the coastal cities and enjoy the sea . 
  i 'd recommend not staying in podgorica for any longer period of time , because it has not much to be seen , and the temperatures are ** horribly hot ** . 
  this can all be easily done in 10 days as montenegro is very small . 
  i 'd recommend coming by car if you wan na visit the whole country , as the rail system is not very big . 
  among the prettiest places are : biogradsko jezero ( biograd lake ) , \u017dabljak , kanjon tare ( canyon of river tara ) , boka kotorska , ostrog etc. 
  what are you talking about ? 
  serbians go to montenegro as much as to greece .
