  romanian corruption was worse and it got cleared with the help of the eu, 
  their reasoning is mostly dumb . 
  politico is never right when it comes to balkan . 
  i 've given their articles about balkan numerous chances by reading them and i 've regretted it every time . 
  they have no good sources here ( or none whatsoever ) and it often feels like they 're making a lot of uneducated guesses . 
  oh just like the us used the drones and hit a lot of schools in hospitals because they still were n't advanced enough ? 
  ah , not my type of humor i guess, 
  then what was the point of your post ? 
  i obviously meant which one, 
  the title is click-baitish the story in a nutshell : - croatian city a gifts presents to croatian city b in which serbs are a considerable minority - serbs celebrate christmas later than croats - the teachers decide not to bring the children to wherever they were giving the gifts due to being unsure whether all parents of serb children would be okay with it ( receiving the gifts before they actually ` celebrate ' christmas ) - the media smells blood and posts the story with the insinuation of discrimination to attract ad revenue my view - the teachers probably did n't wan na have problems with ** those ** parents that would complain the government is n't respecting their customs , and trust me the christmas thing would cause some parents to bitch about it which i find idiotic because our church calendar is incorrect after all . 
  feel free to correct me if i got some facts about the story wrong , only read 1 more source, 
  that 's a bit childish, 
  with what are you taking these photos ? 
  i agree but i never even argued about it , i only argued why french overseas teritory shouldnt be on the sidebar, 
  what sort of advantages did it bring ? 
  because the sidebar map is meant to show the european continent , not the overseas territories, 
  that 's already been proposed by many . 
  holy fuck , that village you linked is extraordinary, 
  who cares , they 're in macedonia and they 're a minority , and albanian is recognized as a minority language . 
  if they want to study in university in albanian , they could study elsewhere . 
  they wo n't ever do that because if they do they know albanians are going to try and separate north-western part of their country . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kumanovo_clashes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_insurgency_in_the_republic_of_macedonia, 
   it 's also not really a secret that russophilia is very common in serbia , and that there 's a lot of social stigmatization or downright discrimination towards lgbt people . 
  oh really ? 
  tell me more , because you seem to know more about my country than i do . 
  you also seem to understand serbians ' opinions , ideologies and views better than me by reading news articles online . 
  interesting, 
  i 'm indifferent of what your government does , but they should at least man up and admit its them that fuck up the relations between the two countries instead of always blaming it on us through their controlled media ( and even the public statements ) . 
  i may be biased but in the past couple of years it feels like your government has done more to destabilize the relations between our countries . 
  funny how it 's the albanian minority being `` mistreated '' in every country they border with . 
  not like they launched terrorist attacks in macedonia or something . 
  this will end up on front of / r/europe 100 %, 
   i was surprised in this thread that even many young serbians are against eu integration , i thought it would be different for the younger generations . 
  you base your opinion off of one man 's post , which is also incorrect ? 
  no , the relationship was bad since your country forcefully annexed bosnia earlier and then your duke decided to visit on one of the most important serbian holidays . 
  not justifying it , just saying . 
  nice , good for them . 
  i think a big factor to that is also usas good acceptance of immigrants / 2nd generation ( immigrants ) . 
  what i mean is , it feels like americans are really respectful to everyone living there , their cultures , ethnic backgrounds etc. 
  while in europe even the 2nd generation immigrants are seen as foreigners , despite being culturally integrated . 
  if i had to emigrate somewhere , it would probably be the usa . 
  you guys got that going very well , nowadays you attract the best educated , smart people around the world and treat them amazingly , no wonder the usa is the most powerful country in the world . 
  cheers . 
   who are now kicking ass 2nd generation serbs are kinda successful in the usa ? 
  it 's some psychological thing which i do n't understand either . 
  but it 's definitely a given a big number of them are totally trash people . 
  then it 's not `` every body '' as you said , is n't it ? 
  `` i do n't and i do n't '' , too , just like most of my friends . 
  how much time have you spent here btw ? 
  ( seeing you are making some generalizations about serbians ' views , i assume you have ), 
  do elaborate, 
  bosniak diaspora in a nutshell : a bunch of people with passionate hate towards serbs . 
  what they do n't get is serbs do n't give a flying fuck about bosniaks/bosnia either lol, 
  what 's funny is that you do n't know shit about serbian eu accession . 
  negotiations wo n't be frozen , because certain people in the eu are the ones pushing it the most , and basically holding our government in their palm . 
  so did estonia in '44, 
  was n't this posted a week ago ? 
  and mercedes ' from the 80s and 90s, 
   discussion really ? 
  it takes me 20 min of browsing the sub to find an interesting discussion, 
  just like the other guy said , zajecarsko and kabinet . 
  im not really the best person for the job , but i like jaffa keks , munchmellow , nela waffles , wellness keks , medeno srce, 
  no you were n't . 
  you do n't choose if you 're ironic or sarcastic - some stuff are ironic , some are sarcastic . 
  yours was ironic . 
  good night , you lovely person !, 
  yet i assume you support kosovo 's independence from serbia , but not crimea 's from ukraine ? 
  no , but your comment simply was n't sarcastic - it was ironic so it was ** ironic ** when you asked me if i knew what sarcasm was hehe, 
   ukrainian constitution does n't allow them to secede without the permission of the whole of ukraine just like how ours does n't allow the same to kosovo ? 
  probably more than you , considering you ca n't tell it apart from irony . 
  and ca n't even spot irony in my comment either . 
  those are the cheapest ones lol, 
  since the ' 45 ? 
  have you got bambi 's `` wellness '' cakes ? 
  najlep\u0161e \u017delje is good if you like milky chocolates ( they do n't really have different flavours ) , but chocolates are n't out best sweets , there are far better ones . 
  that 's because jelen is the worst serbian beer . 
  i can think of a lot of better names for it then ... 
  i do n't understand - how can japanese/japanese/english students have better reading than croatian ones . 
  in order to read a word in the 1st three languages you need to know how it 's pronounced , while in croatian you do n't . 
  also croatian has very few accents , so that ca n't be either . 
  while they were doing it in serbia , i 've never heard of it and i 've never heard of anyone that actually did the tests either . 
  dunno why are we even comparing jews and romas - they 're polar opposites . 
  serbia + bih , greece and bulgaria are in 3 different orange shades , yet there are only 2 in the legend ? 
  i agree that some of them are honest and good people and i recognize the prejudice they are facing , but it 's not the rest of us who are supposed to force ourselves to respect them and force them to get educated and do something with their lives , it 's them who need to start improving to earn our respect . 
  our government is giving them a lot of material help and free university spots which usually end up not being used . 
  i do n't hate roma , but i do n't respect them either . 
  also my opinions towards them are mostly negative ( for every nice roma person i 've encountered , there were 30 with whom i had bad experiences ) but i 'm ready to give my respect to whoever deserves it , and currently most of them do n't . 
  also note how roma people live in most of the european countries , from west to east , and yet , people from every country have similar complaints about them - so it 's not a country or two being incompetent to integrate them , it 's people from the same ethnic group being unable to integrate in various countries . 
  most of them are people with no willingness to get educated , work , use contraception , they rather beg , steal or cheat to earn money . 
  they forbid their children to go to school and use them as beggars . 
  also they act like nomads in 21st century . 
  there 's a story about romas getting apartments in belgrade to live in - they ripped the installations , the floors , bathroom stuff , furniture , sold it at low prices and moved back to their shacks . 
   our ultimate goal is to remove all cars from the center of athens in the coming years . '', 
  the athens * city * is less than 10 % of the whole urban athens - only 38 square km so i think it will only affect the said city core . 
  1000 statistic body research representing a country of 7.5 million people ? 
  no one knows how pro eu serbians are , and no one will know until the referendum , so please do n't spin that shit here . 
  well we 're 300 % balkan then, 
  there are plenty of muslims in bosnia walking around in niqabs/hijabs, 
  i agree it 's doable , but i think it 's not gon na happen, 
   serbia and montenegro expect date 2020-2022 i do n't think it 's happening before 2026 tbh,
