  montenegro is more corrupt than serbia though . 
  and it 's doing only slightly better economically . 
  edit : instead of downvotes on the theme you clearly know nothing about , reply to me and prove me wrong, 
  well yep you bullshitted as i thought . 
  it 's a legacy of metabolism slowing down as you age and therefore making them gain weight easier . 
   but to eastern europeans , $ 4 is expensive so it 's more of a luxury treat . 
  you can eat here for far less than 4 $ though . 
  some centre of belgrade prices : gyros 2.20 - 2.50 $ various boreks 100g 0.50 - 0.80 various dough products 0.20 - 1 sandwiches 1-2 $ crepes 1-2 $ pizzas 0.80-1 .80 $ pljeskavica 1.50 - 2 $ prices ofc vary from place ot place, 
   they even gave belgrad to suleiman the magnificent , because they are more scared hungarians than osman empire source ? 
  we still study latin in most of the highschools . 
  everyone is weirded out by london and dublin which are major tech/financial cities in which millions of people live , but no one is surprised fucking reykjavik , in the middle of artic steppe is 1300 $ ? 
   nato occupies itself for starters , cyprus is n't in nato . 
   how the heck did it got 11 upvotes 10 people knew the previous information, 
   both greece and turkey is nato members  greece  greece you realize northern cypus is ... in cyprus ? 
  which is an independent country ? 
  but the color coding the comment chain is talking about is different . 
  i like how you do n't even understand what the post is about yet you cry about it the most, 
  bulgarian is the mother of all slavic languages ?? 
  bulgarian is the least slavic of all , considering the grammar lol . 
  crna gora is of slavic origin , while montenegro is of romance . 
  do n't most of you learn german ? 
  and inaccurate, 
  reposting my post from a couple of days ago serbia : 37 % german ** 33 % french ** 25 % russian 3 % italian 1 % spanish http://srednjeskole.edukacija.rs/obrazovanje/koji-jezici-se-uce-u-skolama-u-srbiji, 
  dunno how the russian education is , but you can at least be proud of your computer science education . 
  the western countries are knowingly exporting crap to ee . 
  the data comparisions between the countries is useless as some countries do n't have the sub default sub 'd upon making an account . 
  i do n't think there is a country more culturally similar to greece than turkey, 
  just wondering . 
  you 're around 70 years old and using reddit ? 
  sure , sure ... 
  well it 's probably just a dozen of 60 + people declaring their village shall be putinovo . 
  um you realize raki and rakija are different drinks , right ? 
  do n't be an idiot . 
  destruction of this scale was completely unnecessary . 
  french is seen by some people as pretty and posh contrary to russian and german, 
  yes . 
  what about it ? 
  this is the 2nd foreign . 
  english is mandatory for everyone, 
  17 place - high . 
  not bad . 
  it 's only gon na get higher . 
  tho i did n't expect some countries to be better . 
  they * should of * learnt the difference !, 
  http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2016/11/09/russian-economy-inches-forward-says-world-bank tldr :  in 2016 , the economy is projected to contract by 0.6 percent , and grow by 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.7 percent in 2018  at 5.6 percent , unemployment is at near minimum levels . 
  in september 2016 , inflation was 7.5 percent -- less than half of the 15.9 percent in the same period in 2015 . 
   the report also flags that disposable income continues to decline in real terms , contracting by 5.8 percent in the first eight months of 2016 . 
  despite this contraction , the poverty rate is expected to slightly decline from 13.3 percent in 2015 to 13 percent in 2016, 
  that was n't a product of his management , but rather a product of america coming out of the recession from 2008 . 
  well they dont sell it because its only the young people moving out , the old people ( 60 + ) keep living in villages so the villages will be almost non existant in a few decades . 
  the demand for those houses is virtuall non existant too . 
  americans are notorious for jerking it on the veterans and people who `` served '' . 
  montenegrin villages are really beautiful , but a lot of them are facing depopulation problems ... winters are hard , schools/hospitals/markets are far . 
  they 're splendid during the summer though . 
  that 's some really stupid sentiment . 
  neutrality is when 1 side does n't favor any side between the opposing two . 
  therefore , with some healthy logic you can deduce holding military exercises with both sides is neutral by the definition of neutrality - not favoring any side . 
  you can continue with the sentimental `` it 's us or them '' logic , but that 's not how the geopolitics work . 
  serbia does multiple times more exercises with nato than russia , but i guess those news do n't sell the newspapers over there . 
  before you call bs because i put no source : http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/serbia-s-nato-army-cooperation-beats-russia-significantly-08-30-2016, 
  i do n't think so . 
  my grandma has heart problems for a while and the hospitals really helped her stay alive . 
  the problem is , in my opinion , the fact cardiovascular problems appear in the first place to a lot of people due to bad diet , drinking a lot of coffee/alcohol and living in a stressful environment . 
  to simplify it - per 1000 people , there must be at least x2 more cardiovascular problems in ee than we . 
  well germany seems to have more furries than spain , portugal , france and italy combined . 
   because they do n't like being called gamers . 
  with the money some of these people are making i do n't think they give a shit what you call them , to be honest . 
  if i just made 2 million from clicking with mouse and keyboard for 10 days , for all i care you could 've called me a whore . 
  also a player on the winning team just became the first pro esports player to have passed the $ 3million earnings from tournaments ( 3.3 million ) . 
  making his yearly earnings from tournaments only - ~ 470 000 usd or 39 000 usd/month . 
  i mean it 's all about perception . 
  one ca n't be wrong or right about this . 
  eu institutions , probably, 
  i actually agree . 
  instead of `` it 's not worth fighting over '' some redditors exhibit the `` oh god , please make a shitstorm in the comments '' preference, 
  the deal is , danish christmas you speak of is yule . 
  i know about how the two came to be , but now they are pretty much different holidays . 
   mostly in the form of food ( polenta , gola\u017e ) you 're kinda scoring an auto goal there :p, 
   christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of jesus christ , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] observed most commonly on december 25 [ 4 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world . 
  you do n't really have any leverage , so it 's not a stupid move at all . 
  you on the other hand ... 
  how did serbia occupy croatia exactly ? 
  considering how the conversation is going it seems that you 're the one thats gon na do some crying lol, 
  oh you poor thing !, 
  [ i post this in every thread such as this one ] ( https://imgur.com/a/tndve ), 
  why the fuck is the title sugar coating this ? 
  you do n't fail to notify someone . 
  you just do n't . 
  failing implies an attempt which was n't successful . 
  notifying someone ca n't be failed , it can be done or not done . 
  i volunteer to solve italy 's low number, 
  i do n't think it 's that hard to understand ... ? 
  you use gas for heating , not generating electricity . 
   being this economically illeterate, 
  but did n't we already have military drills with nato ? 
  or were they outside serbia , so this one happens to be the first in serbia ? 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/6jtvp8/serbian_flag_in_the_style_of_the_marshall_islands/ ) one has more upvotes, 
  how can he slap ? 
  can you stop lying on this sub already ? 
  croats may speak the same language as we do but we 're most definitely not the same people .
