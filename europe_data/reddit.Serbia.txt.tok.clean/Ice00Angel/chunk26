  same here . 
  we just roll it a bit and it 's no problem at all . 
  not a single r being a vowel part ever caused me a problem in pronunciation , so i ca n't understand other europeans ' awe of those spellings . 
  if anyone miraculously survived extermination it 's got ta be us : /, 
  so slavic word evolved from the original lietuva name , while the english one came to be independently ? 
  half a montenegro sounds the best . 
  we hef a lot of halfs of montenegro . 
  i thought it was from english, 
  in this part of europe , yeah . 
  a bunch of russian rivers are also wide enough for heavy cargo . 
  not sure about german and french rivers . 
   i feel that this bad connectivity on the adriatic is a problem that 's slowing all of us down . 
  i 'm talking trading with italy , bunch of mena countries etc. 
  that 's montenegro and bosnia that are taking forever . 
  our highway towards montenegro is going off quickly . 
  it will be finished apparently in 2018 . 
  also , is n't adriatic becoming slowly obsolete ? 
  when chinese finish the athens-belgrade-budapest highspeed rail i guess that 's where cargo will go through . 
  that 's litvanija right ? 
  vucko promised !, 
  vucko delivered !, 
   afaik most of the heavy cargo goes through serbia , and same serbia noticeably has no sea cargo-ports while that 's true , there is naval cargo from hungary , austria that goes via danube into the black sea . 
  please no . 
  our growth would be in nano italies :(, 
  and soon the city of shenzhen will overpass hk . 
  crazy how the times have changed . 
  [ we have something that looks similar , but is different and filled with cream ] ( https://coolinarika-cdn.azureedge.net/image/c7573da5bf048fe242f9f9710ca2eab1_header.jpg?v=3 ), 
  or send it an ultimatum :3, 
   the reaction of serbians here is just sad . . the only two serbian posts here are jokes which you take too seriously , therefore , you 're being insecure about it . 
  being this insecure despite winning is just sad, 
  [ baltic coast of germany ;\\ ) ] ( https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/05/15/18/new-prora.jpg ), 
  you can use discord via browser . 
  you should be ashamed , yurop . 
  ashamed i say, 
  they maybe are , but due to the fact workers are payed less , the shop venues are payed less , the suppliers are payed less etc. 
  and that enables highers margin . 
  i 'm sorry but that 's bullshit . 
  if you 're buying chocolate , more cocoa and/or milk is always better , so is more hazelnut when buying nutella and more peanuts when buying peanut butter . 
  some products obviously have an ingredient which having more of makes it better . 
  that narrative is used by food companies as a shitty excuse . 
  `` we are n't selling 10 % hazel nutella , because our researchers have discovered people living in this country prefer having less hazelnut in a hazelnut based product . 
  instead we just add sugar and shit '' . 
  more like : `` communists '', 
  ye that was hella spicy, 
  what does roman empire have to do with poland 's location ? 
  would 've been spicy if one side was so ripped off they raised hell over it, 
   not naming it croutia, 
  not really taking anyone 's side , but that analogy is n't fitting, 
  ye i see that , but i thought there was something funnier i 'm not getting : /, 
  why tho pretty great if u ask me, 
  what exactly ? 
  welcome to this sub buddy . 
  if you see `` eastern europeans '' in the title , you can with great certainty expect poles/czechs/baltics nagging about it . 
  which is not more corrupt than spain . 
  comparing estonia with italy and spain is ridiculous, 
  corruption is based on standard of living . 
  if you looked at poverty levels , umemployment , salaries you 'd see it correlates with corruption greatly . 
  africa , latin america , india , south east asia are most corrupt places for a reason ( being poor ) and not because their culture is inherently corrupt . 
  never heard of it ? 
  why is the serbian flag next to him ? 
  almost every single river border is by the flow , only you guys tryna get our territory : /, 
  belgradians are stereotypically teased to drag words out when speaking, 
  it 's actually pretty good, 
  isis fighters from bosnia make it an islamist terrorist state responsible for crimes isis commits ? 
  not only are you ignorant , you 're lazy too ? 
   serbia 's crimes in bosnia as soon as i read this i understood you literally have no idea about that war . 
  stories have it , [ the hobbit ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/ivica_dacic.jpg ) was there too , but the camera angle was too high, 
  delete facebook , hit the gym , lawyer up . 
  not really commenting debating your circle jerk claims , but i must say , when it comes to `` aggressive downvoting '' , some users here need to learn the downvote button is not used when you disagree , but rather when something someone wrote is irrelvant/incorrect . 
  i really wonder what the cheese tastes like . 
  it 's not a 1000e/kg question for me though lol, 
  water near the marinas is n't always the cleanest . 
  of course, 
  huh twitter is not dead ? 
  i wonder if there 's a similar one for instagram,

   [ -- ] austriapiganimal 8 points an hour ago yes even by % it has around 10 % muslims . 
  so , then it is n't ? 
   tfw i 'm first time hearing about that name, 
   i have the foundations for c , c++ , sql , html , css , javascript , php , even bloody assembler of all things , same for working with networks and servers in general and so on . 
  no java , huh ? 
  i now understand the `` stuck in 20 years ago sentiment '' lol . 
  we 've got assembly too hehe . 
   but anyways . 
  how are your exams going ? 
  ( they should be scheduled right about now , no ? ), 
  let 's not ruin the mood here :d  ps . 
  this channel is more useful than any of the subjects i had in college . 
  ah , the youtube learning . 
  i feel you . 
  with my sleeping schedule the good guys of youtube are a big help . 
   been looking for a job for these last few months now ...  does n't help that our education is so useless ( i 'm in it , yeah ... these colleges are like 20 years behind the times ) . 
  weird . 
  it here is quite the contrary . 
  students get job offers in their 3rd ( out of 4 ) year of study and those who finish generally have an easy time finding a job . 
  my college quotas even got increased by like 50 % this year ( i 'm studying it too ) and the programme is quite modern ( a book i currently have in front of me is a 2016 edition , and most of the books are from after 2010 , with maybe a few math subject exceptions ) . 
   have n't listened to this for years i prefer my [ hip-hop trap remixed garbage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieko-m2jcba ) but thx, 
  by raw number , probably . 
  by % of whole pop , no . 
  that 's a hill , buddy .
