  are n't you studying though ? 
  living in a country with cheapest electricity in europe suddenly feels good . 
  are you being ironic there , mate ? 
  you know , such occurrences are very common in almost every country . 
  serbia 's south is also poor compared to north . 
  maybe not as much as in italy , but it 's close , yet no one here cries about it because they 're our countrymen who deserve to have schools and health care as much as we do . 
  i would n't ever forgive montenegro if they did n't produce a replacement for monteniggers, 
  ah now you 've reminded me to listen to [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kgbwjfqpx0 ) song for the whole day, 
  this . 
  child support for multiple children is fucking s a d in serbia . 
  lol thats even more extreme than greater serbia, 
   but then we have transit fees from germany to rest of europe . 
  this argument should not be used because we are arguing about who should get the money . 
  everyone likes money ... this kinda makes no sense though . 
  there already are gas pipes towards countries between russia and germany , so gas wo n't transit `` through germany towards other countries '' because the nord stream will only supply germany , not poland , slovakia , czechia etc. 
  various shit , really, 
   mods just chilling on some mod-only channel there 's the discord server , so you 're not far off . 
  not mod-only tho , but a lot of them are tehre, 
  the cannabis produced in albania is smuggled . 
  so even if they legalized it , there still would be illegal plantations which `` export '' it to other countries . 
  thank you for your expert opinion . 
   serbs wanted to stay in a failing country . 
  bosniaks wanted to leave said failing country . 
  fearmongering and propaganda was ramped up , tensions were at a high , and then the war happened . 
  just like serbs now want to leave the failing country of bih  your kid can perfectly understand croatian or serbian . 
  it does n't matter who the teacher is and what dialect they speak . 
  serbs teach at federation schools and bosniaks teach in the rs , so on and so forth . 
  i do n't know if you 're aware , since you do n't live here , but minorities here have rights for education in their own language . 
  croats for example have their own books and curriculums in serbia and vice versa , and there 's nothing wrong with it . 
  ironic . 
  you say serbs always say division is the best solution - yet we were n't the ones that left yugoslavia . 
  now we also apparently can understand each other just fine , but serbo-croatian or bosnian-croatian-serbian or bcs or whatever it was called is replaced with bosnian , croatian and serbian . 
  it seems division happens only when it suits you but when it does n't then integration is fine . 
  if i had to pick to educate my child by language - i 'd always pick them to be educated by teachers speaking serbian , regardless of their ethnicity . 
  here you call for integration , but on discord you insist that you and i speak different languages . 
  how can a serb and bosniak kid attend the same class if that 's the case ? 
  i surely would n't want my kid being educated in a foreign language in grammar vocabulary that 's not used in serbian . 
  [ smash , smash , s-mash !, 
  maybe . 
  but i 'd rather be on just `` good '' terms with russia rather than `` fully turn '' to them . 
  their usage of euro is n't approved though . 
  they 're basically using it illegally and are n't part of the eurozone . 
  the eurozone just turn a blind eye on it because their economy is very small i guess ? 
  no thanks . 
  that was what i was going by too . 
  our assessments in 2016 seem similar if not better than theirs . 
  the deal is : they started 3-4 years before us . 
  montenegro seems kinda slow , no ? 
  holy shit dude . 
  literally entire your post history is revolving around russia in some way . 
  are you like , okay ? 
  [ jokes on them ] ( http://imgur.com/n8umjwj ), 
  what will you tell your children now ... 
  so ... nothing to spread ? 
  disgusting cropping mate, 
  point being ? 
  because i do n't use the voting system on reddit ? 
  what a joke, 
  so france and germany are old europe now ... ? 
   your sweet auntie in vladivostok he 's italian though ? 
  0 , 0 , 0 , 0 here . 
  it * literally * says it 's weakly radioactive . 
  literally . 
   normal functioning of the kidney , brain , liver , heart , and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure because , in addition to being weakly radioactive , uranium is a toxic metal , [ 7 ] although less toxic than other heavy metals , such as arsenic and mercury . 
  [ 74 ] it is weakly radioactive but is ` persistently ' so because of its long half-life . 
  the agency for toxic substances and disease registry states that : `` to be exposed to radiation from uranium , you have to eat , drink , or breathe it , or get it on your skin . 
  '' [ 75 ] if du particles do enter an individual , the type of danger presented -- toxic vs. radiological -- and the organ most likely to be affected depend on the solubility of the particles . 
  or maybe because she seems the most competent ? 
  if i were choosing between her , dacic , stefanovic etc. 
  i would 've picked her any day regardless of her orientation or gender . 
   she was appointed by the vu\u010di\u0107 ( not elected ) and in which parliamentary republic do they elect prime ministers ? 
   ( imo if there 's any possible real 2nd force to/against the west in the future , then it 'll be china ) fun fact : serbia , along with san marino are the only countries in europe that can have visa free travel to china . 
  apart from the two china has visa free only for < 10 countries , out of which only 2 are n't micro nations . 
  [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/visa_policy_of_the_people%27s_republic_of_china_for_type_p_%28ordinary%29_passport_holders_including_endorsed_type_p_%28ordinary%29_passports.png ) so i guess our diplomacy with them is relatively good . 
  so it is in half of europe . 
  toma is out of politics because of his incompetence more than anything, 
   woman i do n't think women in serbian politics are rare, 
  source for the `` nickname '' which is actually more of a meme : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snobwtl6oni, 
  he probably will now that the pm is chosen, 
  well , i knew britain is the western island , but i thought all uk citizens refered to themselves as british . 
  til . 
  well , not sure how yours are . 
  that 's true , but it feels his power is dropping . 
  the next elections will be interesting, 
  sure you do . 
  all citizens of the uk are british but only some of them are english , scottish , welsh and irish . 
   and she 'll probably look good in terms of pr to outsiders . 
   it 's a bit of a double edged sword though . 
  sns voters tend to be more conservative , so i think they will lose a bit of votes too . 
  you can make the same case for half of the countries , too . 
   i do think it is important to mention that she was n't elected but appointed because some may come to the conclusion how serbs would at this very moment elect a lesbian croat on their own - i do n't believe that . 
  maybe people that understand as bad as you how politics work . 
  why would you mentioned she was n't elected but appointed because that 's ** literally ** the only way someone becomes a pm . 
  you have parliamentary elections in which people choose the party they 'd like . 
  the winning party forms the parliament by their own choosing . 
  do i really need to spell it out for you ? 
   it is not normal in croatia for a single person to call for presidential elections to replace the current president and appoint a loyal pm in place of himself after taking that position to further centralise power . 
  firstly , no one `` called '' these last presidential elections . 
  they were due . 
  you could have checked that on google in approximately 20 seconds , but okay .
