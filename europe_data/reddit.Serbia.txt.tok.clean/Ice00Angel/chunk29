  but whatever . 
   should we give away them money while they are not doing the needed reforms ? 
  definitely no dude your country is literally in top 5 net receivers lol . 
  estonia was n't much more developed when it joined in 2004 either , not to mention bulgaria and romania . 
  [ 85 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generalplan_ost#phases_of_the_plan_and_its_implementation ) of lithuanians were planned to be exterminated . 
  i would n't base what hitler thought on what he said . 
  his narrative was shaped to enforce his plans , not the other way around . 
  he considered finns aryans because he needed them as allies even though they literally were n't aryans . 
  meanwhile he considered slavs which are by definition aryans subhumans because slavs were his primary enemies and immediate neighbors . 
  not sure if it stems from onomatopoeia but the meaning is definitely that . 
  could be , though , because it sounds similar to the sound you make when you gargle . 
  the joke is that czech has a writing system in which a random string of consonants could be someone 's name . 
  in what world does serbian have less vowels than polish ? 
  krkljati means to gargle in serbian . 
  lol, 
  i literally have never seen the last three used in polish lol, 
  theres one 60 something like her in millions . 
  i care so little that i did n't even know it was happening today . 
  well , macron probably has some sort of oedipus complex . 
  so i guess he does fall into the 2nd part of my sentance lol, 
   top 10 worst enemies ten most unfriendly , hostile countries by relations towards russia . 
  if you 're translating , at least translate correctly, 
  i like how bosniaks hiding behind the eu flairs have to make everything about serbia :p, 
  she 's bloody 60 , of course she is n't fappable . 
  unless you 're specifically into it . 
  exactly !, 
  here i 've bought far better coffee for 1 - 2 e than starbucks ' 4-5e coffees, 
  milo and co. made sure it passed :p, 
  yet another one who will give up one month in after realizing jolla/sailfish are garbage , linus is restrictive for casual users , texting is n't as smooth as whatsapp , snapchat and instagram have no alternatives , dailymotion simply is n't as big as youtube etc. 
  fml, 
  and what am i claiming in my post ? 
  ah right . 
  my interpretation of your post was actually at fault here . 
  you using them still generates them a revenue . 
  i did n't mean adopt a random name out of thin air . 
  most of our last names were adopted from patronymic name similar to yours , but they are n't changed every generation and are pretty much tied to the family . 
  my last name carries a lot of history with it and every person wearing it is my relative in under 30 generations . 
  great argument , buddy !, 
  i like how you thoroughly explained the meaning behind your claims . 
  you 'd make a great politician . 
  i dont drive or think about accidentaly dying either, 
  well , i was wrong about that one , but correct about prison population which obviously indicates there 's a lot of crime, 
   outside of some areas suffering badly from poverty and crime , life for us citizens is as peaceful as in western european countries . 
  that 's the deal . 
  i do n't have to think about whether or not will i be killed in certain neighborhoods . 
  those 4 are all very specific cases , different to one another . 
  the only paralel you could draw is spain and italy one , and even those 2 are different . 
  still , ireland does n't in reality produce 51k usd gdp per capita, 
  well , even budapest , belgrade , bucharest vienna and sofia are bigger compared to tallinn than tallinn compared to ljubljana . 
  while london , paris , moscow and ny are a tier up of belgrade , budapest , sofia etc, 
   `` wait , this is the capital ? '' . 
  it was beautiful , but small . 
  something you 'd rather call a town . 
  pretty sure a lot of people could say that about tallinn too :p it 's all relative to what you 're used to . 
  does n't the us have among the biggest murder per capita stat and the biggest prison population per capita ? 
  people here sometimes ca n't decide . 
  russia is apparently at the same time seen as a `` regional power '' with no real international power , but also as the secret puppet master behind the strongest country in the world . 
  does not compute, 
  serbia too . 
  stores are built , the opening is supposed to be in 2018 . 
  because having a last name makes a lot of administration and paperwork easier in countries other than iceland . 
  allowing people to adopt a last name does no damage , those who want the current system could keep it , those who want a last name cause no problem for others . 
  i did not say you should all start using last names , im saying disallowing them for those who want it is stupid . 
   which force special snowflakes and foreigners alike to adhere to a standard that seems obvious to most serbs you mean which forces only icelandic people to adhere to a standard which is obvious to everyone in the world except for them , right ? 
  pretty sure thats almost every country in the world , so yes . 
  how many years did he get ? 
  croatian girls can pm me anything they 'd like at any time xexexexexe, 
   around poland ( yes , lmao at the neighbors ) if they traced our genetics i would n't be surprised if we were somehow neighbours in africa dozens of thousands year ago . 
  is n't it johns ** s ** on and peters ** s ** on ? 
  which translates to '' 's son or 's daughter . '', 
   switching to a surname has been illegal that 's pretty dumb , tbh, 
  i do n't think you need to argue with the search suggestions from american google ... 
  the gold was sold , i think, 
  yep , but if spain didnt have the separatists movements it wouldve recognized it, 
  yes , yes i can . 
  neither was kosovos independence . 
  it also had no referendum to back it up , yet here we are . 
  it seems you dont even know what rakija is . 
  turkish raki you speak of and rakija are very different things . 
  agreed . 
  greek beaches are the best in balkans, 
  because handling bills is easier and more efficient ? 
  but we 're the first in line for the first into nordic country in balkans , 
   serbians feeling more european well you do n't need to be in the eu to consider yourself a european, 
  what the fuck , we teamed up and not only did we not argue , we helped a third party along the way ? 
  sto juznije to tuznije tho, 
  not really though, 
  english ignores americans , canadians , australians , new zealanders , etc. 
   japanese are extremely lucky they did n't lost more territory , things they 've done ... and almost no lasting consequences . 
  and the americans industrialized them after the war . 
  must 've been awful being a chinese/korean during the 80s . 
  while their countries got razed 40 years ago , japan was in their golden age . 
  also they gave up any claim to the kuril islands in the 1951 peace treaty . 
  but some time after they decided that 4 of the islands were n't part of the kuril islands and started claiming them again . 
   not really i think , the logic is you should use your turn light to indicate turning ? 
  you blink with your headlights , not with your turning lights . 
  only a third declares to speak montenegrin, 
   montenegrin doest have a wiki . 
   well you are n't gon na get far with a 200 000 speakers language . 
  sketchy money transactions,
