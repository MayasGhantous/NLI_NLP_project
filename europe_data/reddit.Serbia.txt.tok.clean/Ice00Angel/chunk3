  i guess so , but i do n't get the punchline . 
  is n't that dubrovnik ? 
  yeah , the public in mne wasnt very happy about it either ,, 
  it did n't . 
  ireland is an english speaking country with low corporate taxes , so that makes it suitable for international corporations to place their headquarters in dublin . 
  this is one of many reasons gdp is a bad economic indicator . 
  dont worry , we have it even worse . 
  there 's always a daily `` trash on serbia '' thread on this sub . 
  because they speak a harder to understand dialect . 
  kinda similar to kajkavian thing you got . 
  standard croatian is easier understandable to us, 
  there are more languages with grammatical gender than without ... 
  it is literally called serbo croatian by the linguists ,, 
  translation is : popocatepetl is a volcano in mexico . 
  when it erupts , everyone onto the furniture , because the floor is lava . 
  yes !, 
  you have some russian knowledge ? 
  10 what ? 
  but you also said it leaves no hope for the future and i think it does, 
  `` jebem li ti sunce iz neba '' - im gon na fuck the sun out of your sky, 
  thats not true . 
  newer generations are far less homophobic . 
  out of all macedonians i met on the internet , no one has considered themselves to be the same people as bulgarians . 
  a very big percentage of them actually speaks really good serbian . 
  and macedonians who are living here in belgrade consider themselves to be serbs or close to serbian nation . 
  so , idk , we probably do n't know jack shit , and should n't really discuss ** their own ** nationality views . 
  the propaganda actually just implies his whole family was serbian ( montenegrin ) , while the truth is , only his mother was . 
  but i 'm not claiming his mother being serbian makes him a serbian . 
  he 's an albanian and no one is disputing that . 
  just as alexandar was macedon . 
  his father was the macedon king , therefore he is too . 
  this is ancient times we 're talking about , mother 's nationality did n't really mean shit . 
   i just said greeks has been connected to ancient greek absolutely the same way as macedonians , bulgarians , serbs and turks have been . 
  this statement is even dumber . 
  by the time ancient greek 's civilization was conquered by the romans , and thus ended , macedonians , bulgarians , serbs and turks were nowhere close to balkan . 
  to be more precise , they settled nearby 1000 years after the ancient greek period ended . 
   well i think the argument would be similar to : would you call americans english it 's actually in no way similar , as both american and english cultures are coexisting for over 300 years . 
  american culture broke off from english one and continued changing on its own . 
  on the other hand , modern greek culture is the ancient one existing in one same linear line of evolution . 
   for example , i 'm going to be downvoted for hell for this but alexander 's mother was epirot , which albania and greece have disputed over for quite some time . 
  so would it really be perfectly accurate to label him hellenic ? 
  and skanderbeg 's [ mother ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voisava ) was serbian, 
  `` free eu passport ? 
  why the fuck not '', 
  to add up to my previous post , i found the wiki page about it : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_ ( region ) i do n't really have a stance on this matter , though . 
  i 'm pretty sure most of macedonians would n't agree with you , 
   alexander the great , archimedes , aristotle , pythagoras , ... for bloody fuckin ' sake are n't people from hellenic republic history . 
  so , you mean to tell us that modern greeks , who live in the exact same spot of the earth as them for over 2 millenias , share the most of genetic similarities with them , and speak a directly descendant language of the ancient greek are n't their cultural and genetic descendants ? 
   is their country at least part of historical macedonia geography-wise ? 
  i think almost the whole country is part of historical macedonia range, 
  whatsapp is the most popular here , followed by messenger and viber . 
  when i compare my contact list the phone , 90 % of it has whatsapp/viber ( usually both ) . 
  for that reason i have thousands of sms unused . 
  whatsapp  messenger  viber in serbia i think . 
  also , instagram  facebook nowadays too . 
  i mean , facebook does have more accounts , but instagram is far more popular . 
  yes , i switched them . 
  i 'm pretty sure they have 2 writing systems . 
  traditional - mostly for cantonese speakers ( hk , macau , singapore ) simplified - the rest edit : corrected the traditional and simplified mix up, 
  what differs in arabian dialects ? 
  words ? 
  accents ? 
   now russian grammar , i 'm told , is nightmarish for a native english speaker . 
  not only russian , every slavic grammar , finnish , estonian , hungarian , lithuanian , latvian and few others would be hard for english speakers because you only change pronouns with your grammatical cases while we change nouns , pronouns , adverbs , adjectives ( depending on language ) . 
  in contrast , to us ( slavic speakers at least ) the hardest part of learning english are those god damn present/past/future perfect tenses because we do n't have them . 
  prepositions may cause some problems as well , considering we use some of them differently . 
  oh , and we do n't have articles . 
   swedish : drunk danish to me it sounds opposite, 
  please ... if they wanted to stop it , they would 've . 
  gdp per capita is just a single economical statistic that does n't govern the wage by it self . 
  well if you 're driving a fiat 500l , it 's very likely it 's manufactured in [ serbia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiat_automobili_srbija ) . 
  yup , it seems to be a mistake . 
  if this was a real statistic , the media would be all over it, 
  what is the `` t. '' thing ? 
  i literally do n't know a single person that relies , or has ever relied , upon pulling out . 
  you know that condoms and pills are n't 100 % effective , right ? 
  cheek ( obraz ) also means honor, 
  but serbia has closed the border towards bulgaria . 
  considering you were awake around 00:00 , how do you manage to be 7 hours without a meal ? 
  i 'd like if there were more threads like this in / r/europe in which we can actually learn more about one another . 
  typical politics threads are shit , we all have news portals for that , and the conversations in those threads are n't as nearly interesting as in threads like these . 
  on topic : i like german ( yes , really ) , swedish , norwegian and spanish . 
  i like german . 
  specifically 1 melodic dialect , but i do n't know which . 
  [ \u2665 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozyao1mju7a ), 
  to be honest , a foreigner probably could n't tell a difference between slovene and serbo-croatian , but they do differ in vocabulary mostly , and some grammar . 
  https://youtu.be/wuslviksq5y?t=45 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxmbqbh9r5u one is in slovene and another in serbian . 
  i like greeks , montenegrins and slovenians the most . 
  romanians are also bros to us , but we 've not much in common as with the other 3 i think . 
  i hate ** individuals ** in neighbour countries that , even after 20 + years of peace incite hate and push anti propaganda around here ( / u/panonia - this guy legit searches weeks old news articles in serbian portals and posts them here ) . 
  i 'm aware that a certain number of croatians , bosniaks and kosovars hate us but i 'm neutral towards them i guess . 
  i dislike strong anti-integration behavior of albanians/kosovars in mne , serbia , macedonia ( not sure , but also maybe in greece ) and their tendency to ghettoize within blocks , villages and cities . 
  not sure what 's the deal with us and bulgarians , but i think they 're okay . 
  we do n't have much contact so i can really build up an opinion . 
  a thing we have in common is their singer which is currently getting popular in serbia [ andrea ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7-hukie1rx0/uuuksidvhzi/aaaaaaaamvg/rfhaq6ko0xw/s1600/150779_584742994887780_467714490_n.jpg ) , so thank them for that . 
  also , they can pronounce serbian so damn well ( judging by said andrea , and a few more instances i heard ) . 
  i categorically like cypriots ( read first line ) . 
  do n't like the fact some shady businessmen are hiding dirty money there and their goverment is doing nothing to help us prevent it . 
  neutral towards italians and portuguese . 
  the only things i know about the spanish is from a tv serie `` los serrano '' , so my stance on this may be biased .
