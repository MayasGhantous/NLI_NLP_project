  yet here i am complaining my 00-24h shop does n't offer a wide selection of articles . 
  none taken of course . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's influenced by the greeks or turks as they 've both had their variants and our cuisine is influenced by both of theirs . 
  it 's similar to `` pita '' bread, 
  [ my favorite type of bread ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/sarajevski_somun.jpg ), 
  serbia here . 
  our syntax and vocabulary is also rather different ( not as much as japanese 's ) from english , but english fluency is quite good and more importantly it 's high among the younger people . 
  if i were to give some very rough estimates for how many people can hold a basic conversation : 80-90 % for people under age of 30 30 % for aged 30-50 ( most of these people have n't had english in school ) 5 - 10 % for people above age 50 ( people who have n't ever had english in school , and had very little contact with it ) we start english at age 6 and learn it until age 19-20 . 
  1 . i only used that term because the guy i was replying to used it 2 . purchasing parity is definitely not the same in green areas . 
  buchurest is probably in the early 20k while other regions are in the higher 30k . 
  something tells me this wo n't be very upvoted, 
  right . 
  so bucharest is as developed as sweden ( minus stockholm ) , france ( minus paris ) , spain , italy ? 
  and albanian massacres are listed by nato and albanian propagists . 
  does n't mean they did n't happen . 
  i never said we 're the victim , i said you 're not innocent either and you should man up and admit it . 
  how about [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_massacres_in_kosovo ) ones from 1737 . to 1901 . and then from '41 to ' 44 ? 
  the data ranges make this map essentially useless . 
  are you living in the usa ? 
  technically in the austrian empire . 
  still , emma watson was born in paris , is she british/french ? 
  do n't tell me croatians claim him too ? 
  lol, 
  not yet he has n't, 
  that 's why some people should n't have the right to vote . 
  bulgaria is literally in the balkans . 
  balkan mountain range is in bulgaria . 
  it 's only natural . 
  you 've been hanging out with us so much throughout the history . 
  or maybe because slovenia 's ( for example ) 1.7 per 1000 of 2 million do n't really add up as much as us ' 1.3 per 100 of 320 million . 
  welcome to the eastern europe , greece . 
  majority of people i know did . 
  yea . 
  it 's as of recently though - we were n't in the euro so most people cheered for croatia . 
   rrom is only used in romania rom is used in serbia, 
  damn ... even we cheer for croatian football team, 
  that 's definitely brutalism . 
  alright , i 'm done arguing with you . 
  you 're too much convinced of your beliefs to reason with . 
  just like a certain group , 
  are you dumb ? 
  i said a thousand years ago , when we had no proof of atom 's existence , you , with your `` i have huge doubts in something that is not observable '' stance ** would not believe they existed ** . 
  me saying i do n't understand the necessity of people to shit on other people 's beliefs ? 
   i have huge doubts in something that is not observable , that 's about it . 
  you can believe in your fairy tale of higher being pulling strings on what are you saying so if we had lived a thousands year ago and i told you about this thing called atoms , we would 've had quite a similar discussion to this one - you claiming they do n't exist . 
  obviously ? 
  how can i be right or wrong when i do n't believe in either . 
  on the other hand you firmly believe in one thing without a proof , so the only one here that could be wrong is you . 
  in no part of my post have i defended the blasphemy law . 
  so , even after 10 replies you did n't realize i do not believe in god 's existence or it 's lack of existence . 
  ** i believe in neither ** as i ca n't prove either is correct . 
  you should really start reasoning stuff you read better . 
  again , if you read my posts with any understanding you would 've deducted i believe in the theory of evolution . 
  and if you had any deduction skills in general you would 've realized you sound as insane as christians - you firmly believe and claim there is no higher entity of any sort without any evidence . 
  again i say , as my last reply , ` god ' not existing is not a default state of this discussion . 
  as long as one claim is n't proven both are as equally ridiculous . 
  if you ca n't prove there is something in the box , it does n't mean there surely is n't . 
  yet again , you have proof to nothing of what you said , just like religious people and you sound as equally ridiculous as they do . 
   that would be different types of civilizations , more evolved living beings , not gods someone governing laws of physics and creation in such scale is quite comparable to religious definition of a god . 
  because i think people are entitled to their beliefs no matter how ridiculous they are . 
  different people interpret religion differently . 
  some believe theory of evolution is a scam . 
  some believe it 's true , and they do n't believe god created everything , but do believe there is some kind of a god . 
  if they do n't believe of theory of evolution it 's their own stupidity , not any of my business . 
  all of the firm believers i know do not suffer of mental disorder , they simply believe and it 's their right to do so . 
  and i 'm not defending religion , i 'm defending people 's right to it without being unnecessarily ridiculed by people who have opposite beliefs to theirs . 
  how would you feel if i ridiculed you for liking `` ladyboys '' ? 
  you realize not all religion propagates that ? 
  maybe some force made big bang happen . 
  maybe not . 
  there maybe is some higher force that governs the laws of physics . 
  maybe there is n't . 
  if i hand you a box , people claiming it surely has something inside are as equally stupid as those claiming there is n't . 
  to both claims there is no proof and some bigger force not existing is not a default state in this debate . 
  firmly believing god does n't exist is equally stupid . 
  i 'm not religious which is what you would 've known if you had read my post completely . 
  so by that logic should n't we be allowed to use word ni * ger ? 
  ah , another edgy atheist . 
  on one hand i think blasphemy law is ridiculous , but i still do n't understand the necessity of some people to insult and downgrade other people 's beliefs in the name of free speech . 
  seriously , what the fuck is the point of this ` art ' besides ridiculing christians ? 
  and no , i 'm not being subjective , i really do n't care about religion/atheism . 
  people are entitled to their own beliefs and free speech is not a justification for shitting on said beliefs . 
  you 're still avoiding the explanation to why cyliric is not suited for khazak language, 
  you actually said latin is more suited for kazakh language than cyrilic is and neever explained why . 
  i did . 
  it makes no sense . 
  how exactly is latin more suited for khazakh than cyrilic ? 
  i was 3 . 
  and one took all the blame . 
  idk if you ever spoke to a serb from kosovo . 
  they werent emigrating because they wanted to . 
  slashed tires , banging on the door in the middle of the night , murdered cattle , threats etc. 
  that 's been happening for a long time , but intensified during the 90s . 
  literally noone is defending milosevics regime . 
  then by that logic it 's hard to feel sympathy for latvian times under the sssr because some latvians collaborated with the nazis ? 
  also the bombing scarred me somehow . 
  as we spent those 3 months at my grandparents ' house , i now am very uneasy about that place . 
  there is nothing that could make me dislike it - my grandparents were kind , the nature is amazing , the house is really nice , grandmas cooking etc. 
  but something deep down makes me very repulsive towards it . 
  i feel despair , vulnerbility and i try to go as little as possible ( but i still do because of grammy ) .
