  so you could have 2 brothers one of which speaks serbian while the other speaks montenegrin . 
  so in short , croatian , serbian and bosnian have iso codes , montenegrin does n't . 
  despite the code , most linguists consider all of them to be 1 language anyway - serbo-croatian . 
  it 's all a language continuum , so the closer you are , the more likely you speak more similar , despite your language . 
  month, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njtmtsxts_i the best one , imo, 
  i 've looked through that channel and i only know of 2-3 songs lol, 
   ( which led to this modern parody ) i actually have this in my playlist lol, 
  and [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate#/media/file:road_traffic_accidents_world_map_-_death_-_who2012.svg ) is portugal having more deaths per 100 000 than serbia in 2012 . 
  i 'd go even as far to say you 're safer driving in extremely flat northern serbia during the summer than you are in portugal . 
  our numbers are similar , despite our death rate being skewed by icy and snowy roads for around 2 months , which you do n't have , combined with being more mountainous than you which means having more turns , blind spots etc. 
  he 's very anti-eu . 
  considering vat is widely ignored in greece , it wo n't help much with the budget :p, 
  not much of an opinion , but here 's what i learnt in school about it : - north was industrious - south was agricultural which meant their economy was based a lot on slavery - south slave numbers were higher in relative to population , so their economy would tank if it were abolished - lincoln popped up in the north and abolished slavery - south was not happy - south was led by general lee - north was led by general grant , which later became a president and is now chilling on the front end of the $ 50 note - south starts winning the war - north turns the tides , due to being more industrious - north wins, 
  as someone said 32-33 and over . 
  35-40 temperatures are frequent and 40 + occur almost every summer couple of days, 
  best feeling : when you 're drunk on a wedding already deep into the celebration and [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/kxivfqlda-s?t=44 ) starts . 
  i get annoyed a bit , and that 's it . 
  but the special place in hell should be reserved to those making oc maps from wikipedia which contains data for pretty much every country in the world . 
  so they only put countries of the eu and name the title `` number of x per capita in europe '' . 
  thankfully they 're few , but they do exist  . , 
  americans for some reason tend to think serbian girls are easy and end up having less game than they would 've in the usa . 
  it is n't because he 's from slovakia . 
  2500euro in slovakia is much more than 2500 euro in scotland . 
   as someone who considers himself to be an upper class man from bratislava  i make around 2500 net / month and i still ca n't afford a 50k + car that 's your answer . 
  you are n't upper class . 
  i know a couple of real upper class , and the figures they make monthly are likely a couple dozen of thousands euro . 
  you 'd be surprised how rich some people are and you do n't know about it . 
  even if you take people making 10k into consideration , it may seem ` only ' x4 more than you , but the difference is far bigger than with with someone making x4 less than you . 
  those 7500e over the course of the year = new car . 
  so to answer , those people buy expensive cars . 
  most of them are business owners , but also people with money are big into renting business ( mostly luxurious apartments and business buildings ) , profiting from interest rate of the money they keep in several banks , holding shares , buying land and selling it once it reaches higher market price ( this can be insanely good profit , but can be risky and prolonged sometimes ) . 
  well you must live higher up north , because in balkans , italy , spain , portugal summer heat waves lasts for 2-3 months, 
   edit : and an installation price ranges from 150-200 $ . 
  around 50e here . 
  you realize there are plenty of countries in europe in which ac is used right ?

  i had it as username on a game i was frequently playing . 
  i do n't remember why , i was a kid , but the zeros were supposted to be eyes ... 
  so after forgetting my first reddit username ( yea , my memory is shit ) i used this one as i have it well remembered . 
  besides the obvious ones ; i understand russian and slovak rather well . 
  a bit of german too . 
  they 're more similar . 
  and it also depends on the region you 're from . 
  i understand people from eastern croatia better than people from southern serbia for example . 
   hungarian is a whole different story though , i would n't say i understand anything at all - it 's like comparing english and albanian . 
  ca n't really google it right now , but i think it 's even more distant . 
  my neighbor has 4-5 of those st george 1000 notes . 
  that 's what i was going by . 
  yep . 
  raid is the most popular brand, 
  answers here are surprising i must say . 
  did n't expect so many firemen , nurses policemen . 
  anyway for serbia : programmers any type of medical doctor university professors higher ranking military personnel judges pilots businessmen lawyers, 
  i found austrian history/culture to be much more interesting than prussian/german one . 
  brate/tebra ( means brother ) . 
  new york 's , new jersey 's and delaware 's .

  oh i recognize elsa from los serrano lol, 
  it 's alright i guess ? 
  here 's me [ reading your post ] ( http://vocaroo.com/i/s15fi4uhg6pt ) , so you can be the judge of that . 
  i gave up near the end as your sentence is too damn long !, 
  excuse the shitty microphone . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcldw7k86gg that guy was 3rd place at this year 's presidential elections in serbia, 
  maybe they start eu accession talks after 2050 . 
  just maybe .

  it 's actually a gamble with low probability and high reward :p, 
  czech republic , poland , finland, 
  maybe only iceland .

  that empire would actually span from pacific to atlantic ocean . 
  holy, 
  serbian : vikipedija . 
  it 's also the biggest wiki in balkans ( in terms of article number ) . 
  n 's in nizhny are pronounced as the n with a tilda in `` espana '' . 
  zh is like french j in `` je '' . 
  here http://vocaroo.com/i/s0w2xrdfltuq, 
  serbian word for wien is be\u010d ( bech ) . 
  probably taken from hungarian . 
  word for greece , gr\u010dka ( grchka ) might be considered horroric to some , due to lack of vowels . 
  maybe once per a year or two . 
  when there 's a very strong storm . 
  tuga means sadness in serbian lol, 
  it 's pronounced similar to j in japanese `` gaijin '' or `` nihonjin '' . 
  thats not really relevant . 
  if irish people dont learn their own language , its not disrespectful if you dont either, 
  funny thing - in serbia we do n't really use that , but people in croatia , montenegro and bosnia have a differentiating names for ethnic serbs and people living in serbia - serbians . 
  well , at least we call you ma\u0111arska , which is similar to your own name for the country, 
  we have that phoneme , yet we do n't call you espa\u00f1a . 
   yes . 
  it would be a fault of respect not to . 
  [ considering they do n't put much effort into it ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/percentage_stating_they_speak_irish_daily_outside_the_education_system_in_the_2011_census.png/800px-percentage_stating_they_speak_irish_daily_outside_the_education_system_in_the_2011_census.png ) , would it really be ? 
  we have a similar saying :  da kom\u0161iji umre krava which translates roughly to :  may the neighbor 's cow die used when someone gets pleasure for someone 's misfortune he gains nothing out of . 
  what exactly is the north in croatia ... ?
