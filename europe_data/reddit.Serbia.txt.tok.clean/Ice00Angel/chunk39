  5 years for minors , though, 
  what are car hooligans ? 
  [ prince marko ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince_marko#in_folk_poetry ), 
  racist , no . 
  but i know homophobic people . 
  you realize there is 0 progressivity in `` candidate status '' , right ? 
  if you 're a candidate for 13 years it means you 've made no progress , or else you would 've been negotiating . 
   spoken like a true trumpist calm down your ad hominem . 
  if you ca n't argument like a human , do n't expect further replies, 
  turkey is a different case . 
  fyrom was n't ever ahead . 
  and in a lot of cases they 're right, 
  well we can only speculate at this point . 
  but by the time serbia completes the other chapters kosovo compromise could be found . 
  albania has n't even done the screening process while serbia completed it , opened 8 chapters and completed 2 with similar progression assessments to montenegro . 
  macedonia is only a candidate . 
  [ serbia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_serbia_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ) [ montenegro ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_montenegro_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ) [ albania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_albania_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ), 
  there is no way moldova joins before serbia lol . 
  the outer layer is paprika right ? 
  0.2 - 0.4 l daily . 
  idk i 've just seen some basic slovenian phrases and i do n't really notice any differences in how we pronounce ` l' . 
  got an audio example ? 
  differences are quite small . 
  there are dialects of croatian that i understand with more ease than some dialects of serbian and vice versa . 
  i dont know if [ these croatian singers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxf-hfgzy-m ) purposely changed their accents , but having never heard of them before and the song being released by a serbian publisher idj had me thinking they were serbian for quite a while . 
  but normal finnish would sound russian-like to you as well then . 
  i 've actually seen it on / r/europe, 
  what 's with the `` bugari tatari '' thing ? 
  i 've seen a macedonian respond to a bulgar with that and the bulgar flipped his shit lmao, 
  not a single macedonian i 've met actually believes or even talks about that . 
  standard measurements ? 
  any minute now ... just about to happen ... 
  china , japan . 
  you mean those exist outside of movies ? 
  ouch, 
  lithuanian women must love their men 's names having - as - us endings, 
   i never understood why including a photograph in your cv is necessary for some jobs it is preferable to be presentable ( read : good looking ) . 
  made in serbia is the most common i 'd say . 
  germany/italy/croatia are also very common . 
  non european countries are the same as everywhere - china , bangladesh , indonesia etc. 
  bulgaria/romania here . 
  though we do n't have a lot of their products anyway so `` made is eu '' is kinda rare . 
  wait , bokmal and nynorsk are just different spelling systems ? 
  there are no differences in pronunciation ? 
  technically yes because when standardization started everything was standardized based on it . 
  so now almost all of the serbian dialects are pretty much the same but differ a bit in accents . 
  so now standard serbian strives to less accent certain words to be more understandable . 
  if you have serbian channels on your cable turn on some serbian news and what you 'll hear will pretty much be belgradian dialect . 
  belgrade area . 
  it 's the least accented , smoothest and most understandable dialect of serbian . 
  chinese, 
  this is a discussion about the red army in the ww2 , no ? 
   as for the germans , i think the worst i can say about them is that they took the trains for their own troops when retreating from the don river so our troops had to attempt the journey home on foot . 
  i mean , you were in the axis powers ... 
  that 's a bit of an unfair comparison though . 
  germans occupied poland for 5-6 years , they had the time to set up supplies chains of food , materials etc. 
  whilst the red army just passed through towards berlin badly armed , underfed etc. 
  so they scavenged , took food away as they did n't have the time to transport goods from russia before german border defences were set up . 
  also germans building infrastructure in poland makes sense because they went on to invade areas further east . 
  good infrastructure = fast resupply , fast mobilization , fast retreat . 
  not really defending the red army and the bad stuff they 've done , but there are a lot of factors to `` they gave us blankets / they took our cows and vegetable '', 
  ermagad we 're stealing their jobs , but they 're stealing our womenz !, 
  not really , no, 
   the dutch are perhaps the friendliest . 
   weird . 
  years of multiplayer games left me with an impression dutch people rude and arrogant . 
  `` important '', 
  greece and austria i guess, 
  there are people who consider having only 2 genders is rude too . 
  we differentiate uncles . 
  maternal uncle = ujak paternal uncle = stric, 
  i 'm not sure about my father 's side , but my mother 's side grandparents did n't fight . 
  they were just shot as civilians as 18ish year olds . 
  both of my grandparents were only couple of months old . 
  have you seen latvian ? 
  i never said they do n't . 
  i said it 's seen as a very bad thing . 
  because weed is n't really socially acceptable by many and is looked down upon . 
  similar to how americans see drinking alcohol at ages 16-20 as a really bad thing , here it 's acceptable . 
  belgradians . 
  it 's the least accented and the most similar ( almost the same ) to the accent of news anchors . 
  pretty sure mhm and mkm are used everywhere in europe . 
  both are dumb . 
  why would i care if someone is fat ? 
  on the other hand , why would i make people feel better about being fat ? 
  is mayonnaise an instrument ? 
  not me, 
  welp , yes . 
  cyrillic is not taught in croatia . 
  2 bags of chips , 1l water , a meh sandwich - 15-20 $ , a gas station in greece . 
  / r/europe is n't representative about anything . 
  whoever says differently is probably lying . 
  what 's wrong with maribor ? 
  and where have you heard hate speech in the usa ? 
  norway . 
   * latvia 's six helicopters should win air supremacy o shit son, 
  there were multiple occasions in which serbians cheered for croatia in football . 
  serbian is imo far better/faster because written serbian is almost 100 % phonetic . 
  i 'd rather pay the 1.2 e for them not to run it anymore . 
  slagalica is okay tho,
