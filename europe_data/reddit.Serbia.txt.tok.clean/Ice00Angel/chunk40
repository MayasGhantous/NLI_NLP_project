  barber prices are usually x50rsd here . 
  so if it 's like 350 i leave 400 , 450 i leave 500 etc. 
  ha i watched enough skam to understand that one, 
  only way to get a phone with a good camera for 120 euro is to buy a second hand flagship from a couple of years ago and hope it lasts you enough to be worth it . 
  i thought you were explaining why people see those stuff as rivarly . 
  to be honest , visiting whole america ( south + north ) would be a big hassle for little gain . 
  i 'd just visit specific spots by plane . 
  new england , nyc and dc , west coast , chicago , carribean and brazil . 
  belgrade 's centar is a bit of a broad term , but most of the people agree that the [ circular tram line 2 ] ( http://cdn.tf.rs/2015/09/10/tramvaj-krug-dvojke-mapa-2.jpg ) outlines the center . 
  [ republic square ] ( https://www.google.rs/maps/@44.8162596,20.4606842,3a,75y,305.94h,89.85t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sw7uhds47klqbqtc4ylzmww!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) is considered to be the centrer of the center so to say . 
  that 's not really rivarly . 
  those were conflicts . 
  rivarly is when you 're competing with someone to be better than them . 
  i only know of one ; serbia vs croatia . 
  but even that one is n't pronounced that much outside of sports . 
  what other ones are there ? 
  idk if its vice versa , but croatian girls here are considered to be very desirable . 
  that accent ... 
  i 'm in no way certain of it , but a possible reason might be some counter weight . 
  considering hungary ( and a few other countries ) disagrees with the eu , maybe they feel like turks could push their weight a bit , if they were to join . 
  idk . 
  i have to study today . 
  i ca n't bring myself to do it though, 
  sauerkraut is very edible . 
  belgrade used to have ` posh ' accent but nowadays we speak kind of bland and unaccented serbian . 
  scandinavian people are the most `` 21 century people '' i 've met . 
  how is argentina regressing ? 
  not really familiar with it, 
  i mean you learning to pronounce serbian would probably have a harder time than me learning to pronounce dutch . 
  and there 's that whole thing about the work culture which is even worse . 
  i see . 
  thank you for taking the time to write a detailed post . 
  cro , nl and pl are the ones i notice the most . 
  game of thrones, 
  what happened in 2007 ? 
  never heard of it, 
  island suburbs of stockholm are amazing, 
  yes . 
  you put your clothes and an hour and ironing later they 're ready to use . 
  especially useful during the winter and autumn . 
  oh yes , in belgrade some of the known streets are called : - european - french - greek - croatian - george washington 's - roosvelt 's - yuriy gagarin 's - japanese - gandhi 's - one neighbourhood has all streets named after famous european travelers ( colombo , vespucci , marko polo etc ) - [ mackenzie 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/francis_mackenzie ) - macedonian - georges clemenceau - venizelos ' - parisian - tadeusz ko\u015bciuszko 's most of these are in 1/15 of belgrade 's area with which street 's names i 'm familiar with . 
  there are even more of those in other parts . 
  - croatian politicians are even worse than ours - milo djukanovic - bulgarians hate us for whatever reasons, 
  atheism is a polarity of christianity - a strong belief there is no force that made everything to be without any proof either so its equally stupid, 
   stonefaced soldier he prefers `` minecraft soldier '', 
  hope im wrong but you 'll probably regret getting a zte,

  fat people are rare too . 
   joko11 , you are by far the edgiest person on here . 
  hold your oscars , we have quite the competition, 
  it would realistically never happen .

  a lot of famous scientists were religious . 
  / r/europe users are most definitely a lot dumber than an average / pol / and / int / users of 4chan . 
  eh all slavic languages have that , i think . 
  i know how it ended up , but the circumstances are still there and it most definitely was n't `` out of the blue '' . 
  how was that random ? 
  austrian prince decides to parade in newly annexed bosnia on the ** biggest ** serbian holiday and gets shot by a nationalist . 
  i fail to see randomness there ? 
  few relationships , but almost no marriages . 
  yes i have . 
  we have pubs here too , they 're cool . 
  i literally dont know anyone with a xiaomi, 
  water polo , tennis , basketball, 
  i think the parliament should just renounce them of their royalty status . 
  sorry but no . 
  also can any macedonian write about the whole zaev issue - i simply have no time to read about it . 
  one of 3 bih presidents ( the bosniak one ) went against the disagreement of serb and croat ones , found a connection in the hague ( a bosniak woman ) and sued serbia ( despite this being already trialed ) for more war crimes !, 
  lol why are your politicians stirring shit up so publicly ? 
  ours are shit , but they at least pretend not to be, 
  i refuse to believe this is not trolling, 
  you read wrong, 
  the song was made for a tv serial `` dosije '' which uncovers narco cartel zemunski klan 's wrong doings . 
  they were active 15 years or so ago . 
  so the song basically features a lot of lyrics that are metaphors or straight out exclamations of those wrong doings . 
  here are some of them : `` ides za kanadu '' - you 're going to canada - it was a code they used when someone is to be killed `` do evropskih noseva , gudra stize preko kosova '' - to european noses , drugs are smuggled from kosovo - means they were involved in the drug trade from kosovo `` ja imam trzni centar , imam dva\u2019es vila , stanove , lokale , hotele , ja zivim taj kriminal . '', 
  - i own a mall , i own 20 villas , apartmants , premises , hotels , my life is due to criminal - this is , i think , hinting at our businessman miskovic who owns delta city mall to be involved with them . 
  - i own dickheads , from every pol party , we 're driving around in a police car like real policemen '' - means the police ca n't do shit to them because they 've been paying politicians off `` krv lije svakoga dana , drzava drhti od klana , premijer podleg ' o ranama , a nama gudru cuva banka . '', 
  - blood is being spilled every day , the nation is trembling from the clan , premier succumbed to the wounds ( refers to them assassinating our premier zoran djindjic ) , and our drugs are protected by the bank ( refers to an event where the police found their drugs in a bank 's safe . 
  that 's the first verse , i 'm too lazy to explain the 2nd one , sorry . 
  also my translations were quite literal . 
  they are since the last year with [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxf-hfgzy-m ) song . 
  they started collaborating with serbian song writers and the production house idj videos . 
  that song ( and the previous one i linked ) was met with a lot of hate in croatia while people in serbia generally like them . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ievza_kt6mk ) is the biggest meme-song here right now hah, 
  i like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1u7qdicgkw ) because of the lyrical contexts . 
  those youtube commenters made sure we know it, 
  the nearest neighbor house is like 20 meters away from the edge of ours . 
  chrome and google . 
  first time i 'm hearing about this , tbh, 
  also to be more precise - hvala is just thanks it can be used in most situations . 
  on the other hand `` thank you '' is `` hvala ti ( informal you ) / vam ( formal you ) '', 
  hvala , i think, 
  started english when i was 6 . 
  no school here teaches scandi langs . 
  we teach german , french , russian or spanish as 2nd foreign language . 
  but most popular is german .
