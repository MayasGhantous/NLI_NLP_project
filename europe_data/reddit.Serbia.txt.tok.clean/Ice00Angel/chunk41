  latin is 3rd foreign you get in ( some ) highschools . 
  i learnt a big deal of it in school school . 
  we start english at age of 6 and by primary schools ending ( age 15 ) i had knowledge of most of the grammar and a wide vocabulary . 
  whatever i needed to learn in highschool i already knew because i started using internet more . 
  more like , no one in serbia that does n't visit reddit has n't heard the song . 
  it 's used for respect purposes . 
  basically here we use the formal speech towards all older people , so in highschool you use formal you to address the teachers , while they use the informal you to address you . 
  and in college we still keep using formal you , but college professors use it back at us and also they use `` colleague '' when addressing you . 
  mutual formal you in college signifies we 're adults now and are being treated as such even by the most educated people in the country while the `` colleague '' thing is to signify professors think of us as academic citizens which they accept and regard as their professional peers . 
  finnish, 
  estonian , sami languages , v\u00f5ro, 
  here we use a formal `` you '' between each others and the word you use to address them is `` professor , '', 
  she looks a bit like olga kuzmina ( which is amazingly c u t e ), 
  bmw - bemve , bembara mercedes - merdza , mecka, 
  same here, 
  key word : average average maximum temperature, 
  [ the one to rule them all ] ( http://www.opustise.rs/jt-xlanci/uploads/2014/09/1405606-ceda02-ras-foto-mladen-surjanac.jpg?x33782 ), 
  having looked at a few other of her photos , they seem more blue to me, 
  pernille skipper looks a bit like sansa stark from the game of thrones . 
  schulz is n't even average ... 
  i totally agree with your post , but , is n't that ebba lady a blonde with blue eyes ? 
  lol i always found it weird that people ca n't pronounce words like `` hrv '' where r is a vowel . 
  like , we even have harder stuff i would love to see some of you guys trying to pronounce `` obra\u0161\u010di\u0107 '' ( \u0161 - sh , \u010d - ch , \u0107 - italian ** c ** iao ) , `` kaldrma '' - 4 consonants, 
  it 's quite interesting - hungarian and finnish are even farther relatives than russian and english ( 8000 years vs 4000 ) but the former two retain more grammatical similarities with each other , than the latter two . 
  i actually have no idea . 
  we 've had cable since i can remember, 
  lol we have those sweet pizzas too . 
  hijacking , cause lazy to type . 
  same except for 8.00 or 14.00 start depending on your shift . 
  burek is from turkey tho, 
  it 's not about the dish itself it 's about what 's according to some , the correct way to call it . 
  some people insist that burek is only the thing with minced meat and onions , so according to them , burek with cheese has no sense and instead is called pita with cheese . 
  it 's eh not popular but it 's known . 
  everyone has tried it at some points ( usually at 17-18 ) and never drank it again . 
  most popular mix with wine is sparkling water , with white wine . 
  to me it sounds like someone knowing 10 words is trying to improvise, 
  eh you mean stack overflow ? 
  football , basketball and volleyball, 
  there will never be a correct % of population able to speak fluent english stat . 
  also numbers on that link are overblown for some countries . 
  ~ 12 % for our two right wing , pro russia parties . 
  yup . 
  the worst thing is that unlike in the early 2000s , people here have seemingly given up . 
  back in the early 2000s when the nationalistic regime had fallen people were full of hope and we actually had improvement - now everyone is like meh . 
  i 'm not . 
  i 'm talking about veganism which is a more restrictive form of vegetarianism . 
  vegans are very rare here which does n't come off as surprising because we 're traditionally a very carnivorous country . 
  almost all of our dishes include meat or other animal products . 
  those that are vegans are seen as weird , or pretentious if they talk a lot about it . 
  fifa a bit less because it 's sometimes seen as a thing you do with your buddies when you 're drunk . 
  but games which you play solo in your room are seen as `` you have nothing better to do , eh ? 
  same as in finland , except it applies not only to adults , but to everyone who 's over 16-17 really . 
  feels like being stuck in a limbo, 
  in a way that yours is one of the few that invades other countries in 21 century . 
   although it 's only seems brutally effective when it 's deployed in the sort of `` get there , get rid of the enemy , get out '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vietnam_war, 
   yugos  malcziki ( our version ) oh god make it stop . 
   they wo n't cause it would be ilegal , since they would break the art 1 of the spanish constitution  so was kosovo 's independance declaration :p, 
  there was like 15 years ago . 
  also this guy is a blast : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvez7xadjse https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32mjtu7nof8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmpdzqyq6ki, 
  here we have to take a first aid course , then we have 40 classes of theory about various traffic related shit , then we have to pass the theory test with at least 90 % , afterwards we have 20 hours of practical driving classes with your instructor and then you have to pass the driving test in front of your instructor and a police officer with almost no mistakes . 
  all of that costs around $ 600, 
  so ... what color is it ? 
  so estonian shares about 1/4 of the words ' roots with finnish ? 
  ( assuming they kept those words as well ) also what is the relation between the words with estonian root and their appropriate finnish counterparts ? 
  i maybe do the ` t ' sound , i 'm not quite sure , but i do [ \u00f0 ] and [ \u03b8 ] differently ( most of the time ), 
  also hard gs, 
  yump ( jump ) , yacket ( jacket ) etc. 
  i bring my tongue to my upper front teeth kinda blow and say something that resembles 'd ' . 
  the current version is from 2006 . 
  first one was in 1835 . 
  i do, 
   green eyes are quite popular in france good to know , 
  women having fat asses ? 
  - height ( especially for men ) - being fit - being white those are what most of us would agree i guess . 
  hair , eye colors , facial traits etc are different from person to person . 
  hahah it looks like he 's playing with children, 
  serbia is around 183 which is 6 feet . 
  the tallest region i know of is surely south - eastern part of republika srpska . 
  everyone i know from there is 2-3 cm around my height ( 193cm ) this is all about the male height , i 'm not sure about female, 
  your 48 000 town in 2m slovenia is a much bigger fraction than his in 80m germany . 
  indeed, 
  4/5 , not bad, 
  ice hockey is canadian , according to the wikipedia page, 
  basketball, 
  reasons : 1 . 
  young people do n't really understand war and some might even get warm to the ideology 2 . 
  it 's not a good literary work . 
  it simply has no elements which will improve kids ' literature skills . 
  it 's as good as reading a random novel from a book store . 
  pro : 1 . helps kids view the story from the other angle and can bring some critical thinking for them . 
  what 's the point of political correctness ? 
  if someone tells me we need to introduce a dozen more genders and say `` gender is not binary '' i am not gon na agree with them , despite it hurting their feelings and even though they 'd think i hurt their rights . 
  despite you thinking you 're `` gender fluid : changing between male and female '' or you thinking you 're `` dragon-kin '' , a dragon stuck in human body , we 're not adding those to gender lists . 
  there are n't any sjws here . 
  first time i heard about `` kin '' , `` spiritual animals '' , 10 + genders etc. 
  was on reddit , and for a while i thought it was some sort of a joke/meme, 
  geopolitics is a bias thing : if 1 strong guy bullies someone you were about to become friends with you sanction him , if your strong friend bullies some other kid from another school you do n't give a crap . 
  now apply this methaphor, 
  though that 's based on wikipedia page views, 
  yea i do n't doubt you , but around the bombing of serbia there has been a lot of stories about serbia , a big chunk of which were untrue/speculations/taken out of context just to justify the bombings and so your people can say `` destroying their county in 3 months of bombing is fine , they had it coming '' .
