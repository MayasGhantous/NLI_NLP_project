  after some unprofitable time you 'll be forced to close your booth and i 'm left there with your ex customers , and ability to control the prices as well as the unfair subside from john enabled me to easily remove you from the market . 
  here we only thank someone for holding the door for you at elevator, 
  pointing finger is impolite everywhere i think . 
  especially if you 're pointing at a person, 
  i know of one more `` circle party '' ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  [ pst , hey you kids . 
  wan na start a religion ? 
  ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1648/25591855560_46e671aa25_b.jpg ), 
  even to computer science / medicine / electric engeering ? 
  oh and we need to remove some classes , add some and increase/decrease importance of certain ones, 
  i 'm gon na speak for primary and highschool only as you 're probably all familiar with bologna system for colleges campaign studying is big here because the class activity is meaningless . 
  teachers demand higher wages even though they do n't even regularly hold consulting classes ( for you to ask questions about something you did n't understand ) . 
  too many tests . 
  you ca n't ever fully come back from getting an f - if you decide to `` repair '' your grade the 1 ( f grade in serbia ) is still counted in your arithmetic mean . 
  how many hours of homework do you get weekly ? 
  and is it mandatory to do it ? 
  dunno about the us , but the breeds popular here are pomeranian , maltese , bichon , german shepherd , golden retriever , labrador , bulldog, 
  i mean its the best way . 
  id rather not be next to a dog in a moving vehicle tightly packed with people, 
  holy hell they 're expensive, 
  god i hope no more american sweets show up here because the younglings will rush to buy them as they 've seen them in their favorite movie/tv-show and they 'll kill the competition of good sweets we already have . 
  would n't mind that if american sweets were better , but they 're really not . 
   m & ms or kit kats from the us that are not available here . 
  you mean some flavors of them , or generally they 're not available in germany ? 
  i find the latter hard to believe lol, 
  here you can bring them to public transport vehicles only if they are in those transportation cages . 
  the exception is the guide dog for blind people, 
  farma, 
  another one of these threads ... 
  the same reason weed is popular in the usa - it 's socially acceptable . 
  i 'm pretty sure the biggest reason is the price . 
  ee does have a bit more smokers , but considering the pack price is 2-4 times lower than in we it 's not surprising . 
   in canada any adult can buy cigarettes . 
  no one is stopping you . 
  you can go to any grocery store , or any gas station , and get a pack . 
  the only difference is there 's basically no advertising for it , and the cigarettes are kept behind the counter so children do n't see the packages as easily . 
  they 're pretty much impossible for youth to shoplift . 
  the result is far fewer people smoke . 
  that 's how it 's here too . 
  that list does n't show properly how widespread smoking is because average cigarettes smoked per smoker could be higher for some countries and that would bring the whole average up even if their smokers ' numbers are n't as proportional . 
  this can be caused by habits and especially the cigarette prices . 
   and 1 $ - coins should be replaced by bills . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  thank god we have got bills for as low as 8 cents so you do n't have to deal with coins . 
  university of belgrade . 
  but the university itself is not that prestigious , some faculties within it are . 
  i 'm pretty sure the shanghai list is regarded as the best university ranking in the world . 
  sweden !!, 
  it 's my favorite nordic country for various reasons . 
  here 's a fact - you 'll ** never ** fully fit in with the locals ' circles of friends unless you learn their language . 
  you may befriend couple of them , sure , but if you imagine chilling on daily bases in a group of friends in which you 're the only one unable to speak the local langauge you can forget about it . 
  i am pretty sure this is the same all around europe and probably the world . 
  put some effort into at least understanding the language well and you 'll have a much better social life . 
  i speak serbian and english , and i use them daily . 
  i 've also some limited knowledge of german and russian and i almost never use them ( hence `` limited '' ), 
  the english spelling is just inconsistent, 
  the spelling is very misleading . 
  the problem will be the lack of people that are actually from there answering the question , and will get filled with pseudo geopolitic experts talking bullshit . 
  i dont think many people from that region use reddit for the sub to be viable . 
  but gl, 
  yea i know but those are a bit similar so they popped to mind . 
  did n't downvote you btw ( dunno why somoene even did ), 
  i do n't know much about the first question . 
  for the freedom and privacy i 'd say quite a lot . 
  here typically parents do n't control much where are you . 
  you typically just say you 're going `` to the city '' and they tell you when to come back . 
  discipline is carried out firstly by reasoning with the kid . 
  and since that ca n't be done in a lot of situation , beating your kid is accepted here . 
  not with a belt , or something hard , but a few spanks on the butt or slaps on the cheek . 
  the beating is only when you 're a cheeky shit as in , when you keep doing something after told not to . 
  i was ` beat ' a little while i was a kid and i think it was justified so is for all the other kids too . 
  ah i kinda pronounced the whole thing slowly so you could hear every sound clearly . 
  i think i pronounce it quicker normally, 
  i actually thought i could pronounce every word correctly , but now i 'm uncertain about rural . 
  is this correct ? 
   for me , `` rural '' comes to mind first . 
  the english soft r together with u and to return to another soft r with a different vowel is just mind-boggling . 
  how about : juror , aurora , rarely , rarity ? 
  aww thats adorable, 
  common sense, 
  what were you doing in serbia ? 
  just curious, 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europemeta/ this sub was made by / r/europe mods , so maybe try applying there . 
  i already thought of doing it , but i 'm hated just enough lol, 
  the problem is , no one probably wants to do it, 
  you couldve explained in what way is monrachy good , so yours wasnt very insightful either, 
  then you dont know shit about monarchy, 
  bulgarian language is slavic , but bulgarians might not be . 
  why ? 
  greece and balkan countries ( we pretty much share the same cuisine ) . 
  italy has good food too , but too much dough in my opinion . 
  meats and diary are my favorite . 
  he said inb4, 
  adam is rejected lol, 
  i like joana ( we have jo ** v ** ana tho ) and freja . 
  only to those who study philology, 
  https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ad-hominem firstly , even if it could be said about my country , does it suddenly make my argument invalid ? 
  secondly , i stand behind what i said . 
  countries in latin america were colonies of portugal and spain , and mostly the thing that separates them apart is simply being different countries . 
  out of all the regions in the world , latin america has got to be the least unique one .
