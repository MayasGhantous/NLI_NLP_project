  so yea if you wan na argue about it give me some valid points , not some ad hominem bullshit and a whatsapp smiley . 
  my post might be a little insulting . 
  latin america to me is the least interesting region to travel . 
  95-99 % of the people speak the 2 european languages , there are no particular landmarks besides cristo redentor , events besides the brazilean carnival . 
  south american cultural identity seems kind of artificial and a knock off the european one . 
  feels like south korea with more than 10 times less population is interesting . 
  the only country i 'd visit is brazil . 
  really ? 
  does n't brazil have the most to offer ? 
  you 've not seen many eurovisions have you ? 
  yes . 
  they kind of are , but they 're interpreted differently in slavic and english literature . 
  i might be subjective though . 
  e : i think of it like cevapi and kebab . 
  they probably have the same origin , but they 're made differently now and are to me different dishes . 
  the best group is surely [ beogradski sindikat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkszmpnzf-o ) . 
  though most of the foreigners that have gone clubbing here were interested in [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1u7qdicgkw ) . 
  i like both , but some people dislike the 2nd one because they 're misinterpreting it . 
  there are a lot more good songs , i just took the 2 most popular songs of the 2 most popular groups . 
  i just realized i do n't know shit about slavic mythology creatures besides vampires , vilas ( similar to fairies ) and slavic dragons, 
  ehh , most of the math taught in school is n't meant for reusing , it 's being taught to improve students logical reasoning in various ways . 
  a lot ( most ? ), 
  countries do n't . 
  seriously ? 
  romeo and juliet ? 
  everyone here has read them in school, 
  some people ask about serbian learning resources now and then in / r/serbia, 
  what does that have to do with my post you replied to ? 
  every church that is pushing a political , sociological or economic agenda should be closed in my opinion . 
  also a big number of serbian church officials should be jailed, 
  no europeans except the ones on forums like these ever think about estonia . 
  i do n't even remember the last time estonia was mentioned in the newspapers , it 's only you imagining people hold negative opinions about estonia , when in fact they hold no opinions at all . 
  not trying to flame or anything , i like estonia , but that 's simply how it is . 
  e : oh and ps i 'm not the one downvoting you , may seem so but i never vote . 
  hahaha , i 've had no such experience so i would n't know x ), 
  any answer different from montenegro is incorrect to be honest, 
  i realized the implication but you saying it was a bit excessive lol, 
  i 've families all around serbia and montenegro , germany , the usa and australia . 
  so i live car drive away from most , and a plane ride from some, 
  not sure what to make of that lmao, 
  yea i guess you wouldnt stick out as extremely short , but you 'd probably feel you 're on the shorter side ( assiming you 're male ) . 
  if i remember correctly the average height of younger males is 184ish . 
  me and the guy i replied to , or ? 
  it works how it fits him , obviously, 
  ikr , serbia is n't in ee after all , like estonia is : ^ ), 
  yes , we tend to be quite tall and strong built , but your figures are a bit high . 
  me and my father are ~ 193 cm tall ( 6 ' 4 '' i think ) and sure i feel taller than most but only slightly . 
  there are a lot of 2m + of men and 1.90 m + ** relative ** to other countries , but they 're still rare . 
  also people in western balkans are quite tall on average so you wo n't see a lot of men that would be conventionally short in the usa, 
  bogate may mean :  ( they are ) getting rich as a verb and  rich ( for plural feminine noun ) rich girl - bogata devojka , rich girls - bogate devojke, 
  oh so i 'm not the only one who noticed his pattern of obsessive posting about two subjects - estonia in nordic and russia . 
  according to companies , yes , because estonia is pretty much a tax haven regarding corporate taxes, 
   i appreciate you having no harsh feelings over our turbulent past why would they though ? 
  we 've never attacked them first , i 'm pretty sure . 
   most : the most successful resistance movement during ww2 is a pretty good thing , but no one seems to agree with me you got ta be kidding me haha, 
  i often feel like spain is the polar opposite of japan, 
  uh , we 've mentioned them in school and most serbs know that they exist , but i do n't really feel any closeness to them because i honestly know very little about them . 
  hope some countryman of mine with more knowledge about them can share their thoughts . 
  we have the same tri color flag - red , blue , white , they call us `` southern serbs '' , we call them `` lu\u017ei\u010dki srbi '' and considering two distant peoples share the same name , flag , and a location in which my people have supposedly lived according to a probable theory i guess it makes us long lost cousins , which is cool . 
  that 's how it all began :(, 
  we actually have a similar story , with the place being called `` white serbia '' . 
  i swear the us 's hate towards communism is built just so government can shout `` that 's communism !!! '', 
  at whatever they do n't want to improve/change, 
  samsung followed by apple from what i 've seen . 
  point is to post someone from your country , you said rita ora , to which i said she 's from the usa . 
  to that you said but her parents are ( and with that you probably implied she 's albanian , but only born in the usa ) and i said it does n't matter that their parents are from ` here ' and considering she 's ethnically albanian it does n't mean she 's from albania ( or even macedonia ) because she 's born in the usa and her nationality is american ( which is what the thread is about - nationality ) . 
  so that 's why i said nationality = / = ethnicity , because the post is about someone who is from your country - which means is a national of your country - which rita ora is n't and has n't ever been , and not about someone of your ethnicity ( which rita ora is - albanian ) i hope i clarified, 
  yes i know that , but she 's not from albania ( or macedonia for that matter ) as the thread is asking . 
  nationality = / = ethnicity, 
  era 's bonbon is ** soo ** good bebe is from the usa though . 
  there 's a decent reason : http://i.imgur.com/5spqoax.png?1 numbers are per capita , for period 2010-2014 . 
  they do that for a reason - most of their mother side families are noble too , so it 's sort of a collection, 
  if your family on mothers side has no male members it 's gon na die eventually anyway, 
  it 's identical here . 
  i 've numerous question , but the one that really tingles me is why was this uploaded by samsung russia ?? 
  lol, 
  oh god the g 's , make them stop, 
  d ) a crazy person, 
  i think this is still done here, 
   it almost defeats the purpose of us having good wages when everything is twice more expensive here than in other places . 
  it does n't because if you travel anywhere your standard increases significantly, 
  they 'll upvote anything, 
  then you 'd need to change estonian topography too . 
  ah , i always misinterpret that one . 
   stalin is more controversial than hitler though what the hell ? 
  you were downvoted because you argued his `` lowest class living conditions are horrible and there are so many homeless beggars '' with `` but the middle class is very wealthy though '' . 
  serbian companies : there are a lot of companies , but they 're not really big . 
  the most significant one of serbian origin is [ nordeus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordeus ) there are a lot of foreign companies here as well , among which is a rare microsoft development center . 
  some people may be concerned about their heights but it sure ai n't me . 
  180 is under average in 10 or so countries . 
  even more so in the 18-30 age range, 
  montenegro : every kind of natural beauty packed up in that small country . 
  honest people , but very stubborn . 
  our closest ally through the history . 
  croatia : i like our rivalry in just about everything , they lose to us in almost every major sport except for football , played so well in the euro champ in football this year that most of us even cheered for them , looks like a pretty country , but i 've not visited it . 
  bosnia : nice food , easy going and relaxed people . 
  bosnians seem to be the hardest working people in the balkan to me . 
  macedonia : macedonians in serbia have assimilated really well , their singers are ** amazing ** and their serbian accents ( even of those still living in mkd ) is great . 
  ajvar , rice and wine they make are top notch . 
  hungary : respectful people , they 're the biggest minority group in serbia and we get along really well , never had any problems with hungarians .
