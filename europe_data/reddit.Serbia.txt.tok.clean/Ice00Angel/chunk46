  budapest is what belgrade could ( and should ) be one day . 
  hungarian food products are pretty good . 
  also a fierce rival in waterpolo . 
  romania : we 've always had great relations with them , transylvania is quite a unique place . 
  nice language , brings some melody to this area . 
  every romanian i 've met was really nice and showed interest in serbia . 
  really ? 
  most of the people have the contrary impression, 
  i love it, 
  well considering how much cannabis is grown there you might as well legalize it lol . 
  anyway for serbia i guess it wo n't make difference , whoever wants it can get it for low prices anyway so i 'm for legalizing it, 
   zakynthos  for cultural reasons right : ^ ), 
  it 's not close if he 's visiting barcelona or mallorca for example . 
  actually even if he visited madrid , it 's still 400-500ish km away . 
  people from north  novi sad rest  belgrade, 
  well idk specifically about the ai programme , but some good comp sci unis are : eth zurich , oxford , cambridge , itmo sankt peterburg , uni of warsaw , technical uni munich etc. 
  you think you can teach yourself computer science and to create an ai with as an advanced algorithm as the one you described ? 
   which tend to be worth a few million euro so , bilbao is as expensive as the upper east side , new york ? 
  macedonians ' best friends are bosnia and croatia ? 
  weird, 
  that 's because there are a few countries that are very circlejerked in / r/europe for whatever reason . 
  post about country a : - 50ish karma , 20ish comments pretty much the same kind of post about country b : - over 200 karma , 100 + comments, 
  why not make one south slavic country ? 
  right guys ? 
  ^ ^ right ? 
  a ima i u big pici par interesantnih stvari, 
  interstellar , 50/50 , gone girl , pulp fiction , prestige , the cider house rules are the ones that come to mind . 
   plus if sweets in general , then curd snacks enjoy extensive regional popularity , but are unknown to the rest of the world . 
  they 're fairly popular in hungary ( and russia , but i guess that 's the regional popularity you speak of ) . 
  heh , that . si suffix fits moja\u010cokolada site really well . 
  ( `` si '' , at least in serbian means `` you are '' - so my chocolade you are ), 
  school trips here often visit graz, 
  volvo is considered premium ? 
  serbia is quite accomplished basketball , for a 7.5 mil country, 
  serbia can be as hot as mediterranean but [ not as sunny ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/europe_sunshine_hours_map.png )  oh and i 'm amazed by some guys whiteness obsession since i always equalised my grandpa 's pigs with it . 
  i 'm not into pale girls lol, 
  sure i agree but , skin complexion usually varies by the region . 
  regions with more sunny days ( greece , eastern bulgaria and romania ) generally have tanner people . 
  hungarians are generally pale , but if you moved to italy you 'd get darker complexion over time as you 'd receive 20-30 % more sunlight , especially during the hotter months ( assuming you 're from transylvania ), 
  i get that lol , but i do n't understand the ` joke ', 
  no idea what you 're talking about . 
  i have a hunch but i 'd rather not reply based on it, 
  yea i 've read it , but i do n't understand what that subreddit has to do with anything , and what is that deal about top thread ? 
   how 's that for a / r/imwhiterthayou top thread ? 
  bulgarians , greeks and romanians are ( before the downvotes come ) in my experience a bit darker than the rest of the balkans . 
  serbian girls are becoming darker as well as tanning culture here is huge . 
  / / * after returning from the summer holiday in greece *  ahmagad gurl your skin is so tanned amagad i 'm so jealous , brb going to the tanning bed again it 's ridiculous imo, 
  welp i seem to have misunderstood . 
  the residential buildings were in that similar style , only smaller and in worse shape .

  / r/badeconomics /, 
  to be honest , the younger generations are n't really knowledgable about communist yugoslavia . 
  - `` oh wow siberia must be so cold at this time of the year '' - it 's serbia , not siberia - `` oh ok '' / / has no idea serbia even exists or - `` oh serbia ? 
  politically ugly ? 
  what ... ? 
  hes implying the uk is n't pretty . 
  or even better - the exit festival, 
  albania and macedonia are different countries , so a data plan from one country ca n't be used in the other - you will be in ` roaming ' . 
  vienna , budapest , prague and venice are relatively close by bus . 
  for stuff croatia related you could ask at / r/croatia, 
  that 's what i was refering to ... 
  it 's always presented in the media as race , rather than phenotype ( first time hearing this word in english btw ), 
  there is a similar thing with gypsies here but it 's not really widespread . 
   i personally do n't believe in the idea of separate races how can you not believe in separate races ? 
  it 's pretty much a fact there 're different races . 
  time your flight from calgary starts + hours your flight lasts + 8 hours = the time you arrive in germany . 
  say you leave at 11pm , flight lasts for 9 hours and add 8 h to that = you arrive at 4 pm germany time . 
  uhh that 's the greeks . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unoh1qtcyd8 my favorite . 
  lol there is class in every capitalistic country , but i do n't need to convince you . 
   but that 's not what op is talking about and that 's why i said class works differently in the continental europe in my first response . 
  i 'm not saying anyone is treated differently based on their profession , or that anyone has higher rights . 
  but bet your ass it sounds more impressive to almost anyone when you say you 're a surgeon than plumber . 
  strangers will also , in a lot of cases , treat you with more admiration depending on your profession . 
  also , idk how it is in the uk , but even those classes here are n't very pronounced , it 's mostly kinda under the covers . 
  class in the uk in general is very different . 
  it 's very tied to your title , bloodline and who your ancestors were . 
  in most of the europe doctors , lawyers , engineers , programmers , businessmen , some artists are considered to be high class . 
  basically everyone with enough money/certain professional degree and decent manners . 
  it coincides with / r/europe getting worse . 
  thanks babe , , 
  probably nemanja . 
  domagoj too, 
  most of the stuff ,, 
  should be at least close to this : http://vocaroo.com/i/s0k2t3cwyqbz, 
  serbian word for vampire is `` vampir '' which is clearly the origin of the english ( and most language 's ) vampire over `` upir '' which other slavic languages use . 
  i never claimed the vampire legend appeared in serbia i just claimed the first `` case '' did , and since the word case is used as investigation , i 'm not wrong on this one either . 
  word vampire is of serbian origin , and the first vampire `` case '' was in serbian village kisiljevo . 
  who could be better at dealing with lying dicks than a pornstar ? 
  1100 after the 1st try, 
  ill go as far to say i can recognize every official language in europe, 
  the brainwashed eu    usa misconception has always been amusing to me on this and / r/europe subs . 
  you make no sense whatever but ok . whatsoever *, 
  what is 20 % ? 
  the number of people who voted ? 
  or the number of american people who voted trump ? 
  and let 's say that if we had an option to magically not encounter them at all 99 % of us would pick it . 
  at least , as far as i know , ex-yu communist buildings were far better quality than those from across the curtain . 
  to me it 's ironically funny how those same people were convinced trump had 0 chance to win , were easy going about the elections and were already concluding hillary would win . 
  now they 're on the streets rioting about the outcome which was n't what they expected lol .
