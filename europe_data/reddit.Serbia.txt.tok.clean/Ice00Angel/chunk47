  i do n't agree . 
  circumstances change all the time and therefore the answers do too . 
  if you asked someone what they thought of uk 's politics 1 year ago and now the answers would be very different . 
  i think there are some internships for vocational schools in the field of your profession but they last very shortly . 
  because the isis are their kinsmen . 
  is n't she the very one that said she 'd leave the usa if trump get 's elected ? 
  same as you do, 
  yea racists and sexual harassment did n't exist before trump at all . 
  that 's because the dnc 's campaign painted it that trump is gon na deport every colored person , instead of deporting of ** illegal ** immigrants . 
  well considering how major newspapers in the usa were clearly pro-clinton i 'm not surprised . 
  the riots are also disgusting to me : `` a candidate i do n't support won ? 
  better go to the streets and create a mess '' it helps no one 's cause ... 
  well i assume you know about the riots .

  you missed imperative ( used for expressing orders , commands , suggestions ) and potential ( used for wishes and possibilities ), 
  we have 9 actually, 
  serbian is something of serbia , from serbia or in some way related to serbia . 
  citizens of serbia are serbians , whether or not they 're ** serbs ** ( nationality ) . 
  interestingly enough , we rarely use this kind of distinction in our own language ( srbijanci and srbi ) , but croats and montenegrins use it .

  i 've never heard of it and ca n't find it on wiki lol, 
  tbh ww1 just sped up the process .

  summers are too hot sometimes ( 30-40 + ) , temperatures in fall and spring are too shifty ( shifts from 10 to 30 or 30 to 10 in a day or two ) we get hails every year , winters are cold ( -15 to 5c ) , windy , with high humidity ( the worst thing during the winter ever ) and frequently we get big snow storms that leave us with up to 20cm of snow . 
  may is amazing though .

  his approval rate is average , and those who dont approve of him wouldnt go that far to assassinate him . 
  a big chunk of mafia is extermanated and whats left of it is probably in goverment control . 
  those things considering , if someone did try to kill him , it 's probably from abroad . 
  ( they recently anounced they 're waging war on montenegrin mafia ), 
  ive been to corfu , vido and hawaii ( in budva , montenegro ), 
  langs arent the most important . 
  if you put that much effort into lang learning you ll neglect one of the following : chemistry , biology , geography , physics , comp sci , math, 
  idk how is it more accurate as our `` kebab removal '' wasnt fueled by islamophobia . 
  war on turkey and hatred towards them was because they opressed us and we wanted independence from them . 
  war with the bosniaks was a civil war , and once again wasnt fueled by islamophobia . 
  no one not using reddit knows about `` remove kebab '' either , so i kinda cringe when foreigners use it lol, 
  god i hate that meme . 
  the best surstromming video ever https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-wqhsuf6mm,

   there are often village fights , where guys from one village drive to the next one to beat up the guys in that village over someone 's old feud or because someone looked at somebody else 's girlfriend at the local tavern or whatnot .

  novak \u0110okovi\u0107 , obviously, 
  10/10 - would be unknown on the world stage again,

  i thought rita ora was carribean lol, 
  not really a gamer but i play occasionally league of legends and cs go .

  pizza isnt american though, 
  nobody thought it 'd be fitting to put ancient greek philosophers as their teachings is what the western world is bases upon .

  enjoy , 
  well you do n't have to put those 3 , and pljeskavica can be eaten in a normal bun , it sometimes is here , but most people prefer it in somun . 
  you can swap somun with greek pita , really . 
  to be honest i do n't have a recipe for which i 'm certain it 's good . 
  it 's similar to a burger except for the fact it is a mixture of 2 or more combinations of meat : veal , beef , pork or lamb . 
  each mixture gives a little bit unique taste , and how good it tastes depends on the % of each meet . 
  the good grillers know how to mix it up . 
  with that , an important thing is onion which also goes into the minced meets mixture before grilling . 
  you put the grilled meet into `` somun '' which is a flatbread used around balkans . 
  now you add toppings you like - people typically put something from the following - mayo , ketchup , sour cream , `` kajmak '' , cabbage salad , `` urnebes '' , garlic , onion , paprika . 
  my personal favorite is paprika , onion and cabbage salad . 
  the taste is really good , different from burger , and it 's usually half the price and bigger .
