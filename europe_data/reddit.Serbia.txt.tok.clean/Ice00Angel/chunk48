  check `` kajmak '' and `` urnebes '' im tight with time to link it, 
  i do n't think anything changed from its original state to an americanised state . 
  american products and fast food appeared long ago but they just coexist with other stuff we have . 
  [ pljeskavica ] ( http://cookingtheglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pljeskavica-serbian-burger-recipe-5.jpg ) will always be a pljeskavica , and burger will always be a burger . 
  rome and vienna . 
  the one that caught my attention is sexual openness - scandinavians are sexually more open than balkanites and start practicing sex earlier on average . 
  dunno about western/southern europe, 
  weird , because in my experience serbs under the age of 35 are very good at english . 
  romania is ~ 100 km away from belgrade , but i 've never visited it . 
  fun fact : iubit is of slavic root `` ljubiti '' which in some slavic languages means `` to love '' while in other it used to , but now means `` to kiss '', 
  roads in montenegro are n't that bad , it 's just the northern part 's terrain is very rough, 
  well you might be right on that, 
  oh and do n't argue with the `` what about serbia stronk , remove kebab , what about war with bosnia '' 1 . serbia stronk , remove kebab is a 4chan/reddit meme , ** literally ** no one not using the 2 sites in serbia knows of it , so if you ever visit do n't joke about it , because almost no one knows it and they 'll think you 're special 2 . war with bosnia was n't of religious nature, 
  i am certain serbia does n't have more islamophobes than rest of the europe . 
  i might even argue it has less than plenty of we countries . 
  i know that , but i ca n't see your point . 
  or are just clarifying ? 
  the deal is , there are n't countries which population is conservative , radical , misogynistic , homophobic , and generally backwards and happens to be christian . 
  meanwhile , there are plenty of muslim countries that fit the criteria . 
  so obviously the muslim population of that country is going to be backwards , but not necessarily because of their religion , but because of their country 's sociological values . 
  dude you 're contradicting yourself . 
  you say being in ee is a political manner , and then list cultural reasons to why poland is n't in ee . 
  and still i fail to understand how has macedonia been more tied politically with russia more than poland ? 
  that 's because most of the `` mainstream christians '' are from europe/americas where people are generally more liberal than the more radical on average mena population , which happens to be the place where most of the `` mainstream muslims '' live . 
  poland is more eastern than macedonia , yet you see it fitting to call macedonia eastern , but not for others to call poland eastern ? 
  it 's the best way for everyone that 's not from greece , macedonia , albania , montenegro , and maybe south-western parts of croatia and bosnia . 
  i made a little illustration http://imgur.com/a/6rlwy blue is through serbia , red is not, 
  and to serbia before hand . 
  well blame english for not pronouncing the j as everyone else, 
  i loved [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/df9yp8c.png ), 
  is n't that how you would pronounce it too ? 
  well i would n't call that `` liking '', 
  i have n't actually - care to fill me in ? 
  you must 've misunderstood something, 
  i know , but there arent any names that are endemic to a country . 
  those names i listed were just the closest to it, 
  guys ... 
  i think the point is to list some names that are unique ( to some extent ) in our countries . 
  there are ana 's , maja 's , adam 's , peter 's in every country ... 
  if the point is to list names from our country that are not popular in other countries - that 's hard . 
  but i guess male : milo\u0161 , ilija , nenad female : kristina , mina , nina , sanja, 
  serbians are very split on most opinions , so that 's hard . 
  what kind of coffee do you drink the most in finland ? 
  here i am . 
  idk which picture are you refering to . 
  yeah , specifically when it comes to homosexuality and transsexuals . 
  you 're , once again , mixing up brands with companies . 
  any of the bloody battles we 've hand against far stronger enemies in which thousands marched into their death to fight for serbia 's independence . 
  probably among the older generations . 
  but i think 90 % of people under the age of 50 have been . 
  sea side vacationing culture here is really big , and has been since the 50s . 
  i 've yet not heard someone saying they 've never been , but there surely are people like that . 
  atlantic group does n't directly own smoki , it owns \u0160tark - which owns smoki . 
  when someone else buys \u0160tark , atlantic group wo n't be able to produce smoki , therefore it 's only owned by \u0161tark . 
  that 's at least how i 've been taught . 
  i do n't think i 've received more than 3 legit receipts in greece . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjpsfub67b4 very related, 
  i was talking about companies . 
  meanwhile you said smoki was owned by atlantic group , instead of saying stark is . 
  well , i am not that familiar with citizenship , but considering you mentioned your father ** was ** a citizen of austro hungary you 're not gon na have a lot of success in your goal . 
  and even if you succeed you might have to revoke your us citizenship . 
  do n't take me for certain , of course , but i think you have small chances considering you have almost nothing tying you to italy/austria https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_nationality_law https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_nationality_law, 
  your post is n't quite clear , are you : 1 . an austrian citizen aiming for italian citizenship 2 . an american citizen aiming for italian citizenship ? 
  and then austrian if italian one fails ? 
  well , besides \u0160tark and frikom i ca n't think of any . 
  trade between croatia and serbia is generally quite low . 
  we only import $ 658m from croatia , while we import over $ 800m from slovenia . 
  export to croatia : $ 450m export to slovenia $ 504m and keep in mind slovenia has less than half croatia 's population, 
  do n't you have smoki , plazma , jafa , eurokrem ? 
  also serbian products are quite successful in bih ( rep. srpska ) edit : to put in perspective bih 's imports : croatia $ 1.35 bln serbia $ 1.20 bln so not too shabby . 
  well if we 're going by commerce we trade the most with germany , italy and russia . 
  military cooperation is apparently the biggest with the usa , then rest of nato and russia . 
  yes . 
  the state finances students in every college , but the numbers vary . 
  for example 520/540 students in mechanical engineering get the free education ( does n't include some fees and books ) but only around the half get financed in electrical engineering . 
  god damnit , the old europe is the eastern one , not the western . 
  huge, 
  evropa for both, 
  most of new belgrade , tbh . 
   some sweet cocktail ah , it was probably a `` girly '' cocktail . 
  for some reason martini , cosmopolitan and the likes of them are considered girly cocktails here by many . 
  it 's probably an asshole knowing americans tip and taking advantage of it . 
  waiters here do n't ask for tips and are polite . 
  in my experience , waiters around europe seldom try to take advantage of tourists , so beware of it . 
   i do n't think muslims will ever grow a civilized bone in them au \u010demu toliki hejt ? 
  what ? 
  there was a brigade ? 
  nope, 
  game of thrones and suits . 
  also `` andrija and andjelka '' it seems . 
  `` you might as well not bother visiting '', 
  no biggie , i often think some singers are serbian , when they 're actually not . 
  it 's not . 
  it only had some locations filmed in croatia . 
  if you 're talking about this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_parade_ ( film ), 
   i 've heard slovenian sounds more german/italian not at all to me . 
  it sounds like a softer version of polish to me, 
  srb ** in **, 
  biti jevrej ( to be a jew ) - when someone is a scrooge or stingy . 
  ciganska posla ( gypsy business ) - when someone 's behavour is impolite , rude , disgusting etc.
