  praviti se englez ( pretending to be an englishman ) - when someone is acting naive , but is n't .

  sweden . 
  i like mountains , lakes and forests . 
  how come serbia ? 
  did n't think it 's a country people would wan na move ** to **, 
  also note that word lu\u010da in serbian is a bit arhaic word for light . 
  not that i know of, 
  montenegro , obviously . 
  weird , because i think that for germans . 
  new europe is actually the western europe . 
  you got ta get yourself something like this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matemati%c4%8dka_gimnazija, 
  i think it was an invasion with an agenda hidden behind the veil of * l i b e r a t i o n *, 
  to have a proper social life , only in the uk and ireland . 
  and malta . 
  no one is really gon na bother much including you in their social circle for an extended period of time - just picture it , you , the only person not speaking the local language , and a few other people having to speak english to one another just so you could understand . 
  in their country . 
  and there is the problem of finding a job . 
  you could find other international friends in the country , but idk how successful would you be . 
  but if i would have to pick one ( outside the 3 i already mentioned ) i 'd say the nl due to high english proficiency among the people and presence of a lot of international companies in which you could find a job . 
  i do agree with you , and i agree it 's skewed a lot by various factors , i 'm not saying it 's ** precise ** i 'm saying it 's decent approximation for most of the countries . 
  you 're correct - it shows little of population 's well being , but it 's still a decent approximate indicator of a country 's economic strength . 
  there are forests and a lot of greenery near my house so flies , mosquito , bees and wasps are really frequent . 
  some spiders as well ( not technically insects , but for the sake of argument ) , but thankfully we have no venomous ones here . 
  why ? 
  did you not like the show ? 
  los serrano is simply amazing . 
  half of the serbian population has seen this show ( if not more ) . 
  one storyline follows young teens , one older teens entering adulthood , and one features adults though . 
  if you want teens exclusively , check internado . 
  it will be hard finding them though ( try youtube , it 's often uploaded and then taken down in a few days though ) . 
  and they 're in spanish . 
  it is now , yes , but originally it was made by slavs, 
  i do n't even know what lithuanian cuisine has to offer , and i 've only tried kvass out of the things in your post , but kvass is a slavic drink , so nothing i guess . 
  i really want goody 's to open here ... 
  if diners fall into american themed category , then [ yes ] ( http://www.intergalacticdiner.com/fotke/ ) . 
  they mostly serve american food - burgers , hotdogs , salads , milk-shakes , pies and pancakes . 
  i use both on a regular basis, 
  also if someone could explain `` inat '' to the rest , that 'd be great , im too tired and drunk to put good effort . 
  it 's similar to spite , but not quite i think . 
  different words for different types of uncles and aunts . 
  your fathers brother is your stric while your mother 's is ujak . 
  your parents sisters share the noun though - tetka . 
  stric 's wife is strina , ujak 's ujna and tetka 's husband is te\u010da . 
  i think that 's neat, 
  pretty decent i 'd say, 
  on a semi related note , here people often fail to differentiate `` kod ku\u0107e '' ( at home ) and `` ku\u0107i '' ( [ going ] to home ), 
  maybe your girlfriend is a guy who happens to have a pussy ? 
  no idea , but i fail to see why would straght men watch it . 
  is n't that what most of the arguments rest on ? 
  normally , yes . 
  but when it comes to sex , no one can tell me shemales are `` women who happen to have a penis '' . 
  no matter how attractive she looks , having a penis is a turn off to me and almost every straight guy . 
  that 's my point . 
   woman a woman is a female human . 
   female female ( \u2640 ) is the sex of an organism , or a part of an organism , that produces non-mobile ova ( egg cells ) . 
  most female mammals , including female humans , have two x chromosomes . 
  i do n't share your view , and shemales are n't sexually attractive to me , a straight male , and neither they are to any other straight guy i 've spoken to . 
  you think someone who 's all favorite pornstars are females would enjoy watching a shemale ? 
  do n't know a lot of 'em , but i 'd pick krystal boyd aka anjelica as my fav . 
  she 's , i think , russian . 
  you know sasha shatalova is a shemale/trap ? 
  as in , chick with a dick . 
  i just googled her btw, 
  commercial ones : best zaje\u010darsko most popular lav or jelen, 
  well cyrilic will never die out as it 's something that can be learnt in a day and its learnt in school . 
  cyrilic and latin have the exact same spelling system , they just have different looking letters . 
  but cyrilic use is on decline since the 2000s , and it doesnt seem like its gon na stop any time soon . 
  not really that common , but my favorite : `` daleko ti lepa ku\u0107a '' - may your house be nice , but far away . 
  used when you wish nothing bad for someone , but want them far away from you/don ' t want contact with them . 
  oh my bad , i somehow interpreted 20s to be 20th ** s ** entury even though i know it 's spelled century . 
  did n't that happen in 1920s ? 
  yeah , i meant latin . 
  yeah , we learn cyrilic in the 1st grade and latin in the 2nd . 
  not knowing both scripts pretty much means you 're illiterate . 
  newspapers : they 're in 90 % of the cases latin internet sites : a big chunk of the goverment , education and healthcare sites are offered in both [ latin ] ( http://www.privreda.gov.rs/?lang=lat ) and [ cyrilic ] ( http://www.privreda.gov.rs/ ) also wikipedia [ lat ] ( https://sr.wikipedia.org/sr-el/%d0%95%d1%81%d1%82%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%98%d0%b0 ) [ cyr ] ( https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%95%d1%81%d1%82%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%98%d0%b0 ) , while the rest of the sites are in 99 % of the cases in latin . 
  people on the internet also most exclusively use latin in general . 
  ads , shop names , menus are in latin , and if you go through the city you will mostly encounter latin . 
  on the other hand documents from the state are exclusively in cyrilic ( this is the only restriction to one alphabet over the other ) books : it depends on the publisher , but in most of the cases , again , it 's in latin . 
  demographics : i 've not really noticed some patterns , except for the overly patriotic/nationalistic people tend to use cyrilic more . 
  ~ ~ in school ~ ~ generally you can write either script , but mixing them up is a big no-no . 
  i personally used to write notes in school in cursive cyrilics ( it 's really fluid to write ) , but in tests and casual writing i wrote normal latin . 
  and in every other case i used latin . 
  i 've seen it , but rarely . 
  serbian language uses both latin and cyrilic scripts , but the latin one is much more prefered . 
  over 90 % of the people use latin more . 
  lol, 
  same in serbia, 
  they turned their backs on us during the bombing by nato ( against whom we also hold a grudge ) even though they could have prevented it . 
  also they gave up control over kosovo to the usa even though they got to it first . 
  this all happened in ' 99 . 
  and in general during the 90s they supported every sanction against the yugoslavia . 
  a lot of people who `` love russia '' generally like the russian people , and think russia has n't fucked us over like but are n't fond of their politics and are aware they 're using us as trade chips . 
  so they 're like the viewed as americans in some western countries - as people they 're cool , but their goverment is the biggest evil in the world . 
  the people who are genuinely into russia , everything russian including the politics , putin , expansionist tendencies do exist , but their numbers are low and kinda inflated by their ** huge ** activity in comment sections of news , forums etc. 
  they see it as an obligations to set us `` non rusophilic '' serbs at the `` right direction '' by spamming comments of how russia never bombed us and were good to us etc. 
  to put it into perspective pro russian parties ( 2 ) won around 12-13 % in the last elections . 
  even if you added the pro russians who voted for the other , pro eu parties , you would n't even get near 30 % . 
  i hate to generalize , but the pro russian people who i 've met are more often than uneducated , from rural areas and older people . 
  most people here aspire towards the european path , but that does n't necessarily mean they 're pro eu either .
