  `` ja sam bosanski srbin '' ( bosnian serb ) - said no one ever, 
  you just can not miss an opportunity to push your anti-serb agenda , can you ? 
  out of literally thousands of people who contributed in some meaningful way , you picked a french guy who joined ustashe ( a fascist organization ) and was killed by serbs afterwards . 
  totally coincidental , huh ? 
  from your link  in july 1991 , he boarded the train and arrived in zagreb completely alone . 
  [ 1 ] there he joined the croatian defence forces militia [ 3 ] of the extreme-right croatian party of rights , notorious for reviving the ideology and symbols of ustashe ( nazi-puppet regime in croatia during world war ii ) , and was set off to the front along the kupa river in banovina . 
  who is in your opinion natural and who secundary leader ? 
  well serbian doesnt really have that `` rough '' slavic accent . 
  i remember learning russian in school and the question that popped into my mind every class was `` why the hell do they accent this much ? '', 
  even croatian and bosnian have kind of funny accents to us , but still i think they 're way nicer than eastern slavic language . 
  though i personally dislike bosnian accent, 
  original joke ... 
  well , few centuries ago religion was seen as a big binding factor . 
  and since both serbs and romanians are in big numbers christian orthodox there must 've been some sort of mix up between the people . 
  i should also note that ** pop ** ovi\u0107 last name basically means `` the family of a priest ( pop ) '', 
  i 'm pretty sure this is the best thing i 've seen on / r/europe, 
  1 . every country presents a song 2 . voting ( you ca n't vote for your own country ) 3 . every country presents their points which range from 1-7 , then 8 , 10 , 12 points to other countries based on the results of the voting 4 . winner is announced, 
  actually it 's not * that * horrible . 
  if the facades on buildings were to be remade , it would actually be really nice . 
  especially [ paviljoni ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/paviljoni.jpg ) part of it . 
  what does nato have to do with economy ? 
  i do n't agreek, 
   we 're a classless society meanwhile the richest people of the whole world live in the usa while it has considerably more people under the poverty line than most of the other 1st world countries . 
  can confirm . 
  the `` belgradian '' accent is for the overly local patriotic belgrade-born people to differentiate themselves from `` the rest '' , but only a few people speak it though . 
  no accent serbian - master race . 
  though i never considered it to be ` posh ' and neither did i know other people consider it . 
  i would bet a lot of money that an average serbian is less intolerant towards muslims than an average american . 
  the `` remove kebab '' meme has gone way too far . 
  i would n't say serbia is too nationalistic , rather too patriotic . 
  fuck no . 
  also stronger germany is bad for the usa , as it loosens its grip over the eu . 
  this is fucking bullshit . 
  7k $ per person fine for raping an underage girl . 
  rapists , once again , leaving europe for australia as free men, 
  niqab is becoming more and more popular . 
  you can see plenty of women in some montenegrin cities wearing them . 
  i do n't know the specifics . 
  all i know is if the opposition forms the government , they wo n't sign the protocol , but will start a referendum over it . 
  not if their own government does n't ratify the membership . 
  and since we still do n't know who will make up the government in montenegro , we do n't know whether or not will montenegro join . 
   allowing montenegro to take an `` observer '' status ** pending ratification by ** the governments of the other members , ** as well as by montenegro 's own parliament ** it was literally in the same sentence . 
  and where does it say they are already in nato ? 
  they did n't . 
   which would be like one thousand times better gripens are twice as expensive and only slightly better . 
  yes !!, 
  ca n't wait to visit in the future . 
  they 're old buddies coming up with a nice deal wasnt probably too hard, 
  if a girl tells you she does n't wan na be with you , but * maybe * in the future , do you stop seeing other girls , or ? 
  is there any thread about serbia in which you have n't posted something negative about it ? 
   so there is a tad of hypocrisy going on from beograd these days when they try both to avoid sanctions , but also join eu as soon as possible . 
  there is no hypocrisy in geopolitics , only interests . 
  getting offended over this would be idiotic . 
  we are n't in the eu , and we 're not close to it , so we can afford these moves . 
  i support this move , not being in the eu and losing russia as the trade partner ? 
  nope , not that dumb . 
  how many people have died over this stupidity ... 
  nobody wants to be short either . 
  that map is incorrect for serbia . 
  jsut let it go ... 
  something interesting i 've noticed is bulgarians and macedonians are able to understand serbian far better than we 're able to understand their languages . 
  not burger england ? 
  that guy is actually legit . 
  vatican uses it for religious purposes and combining that with low population you get the high per capita, 
  dedinje and nbgd arent in city center . 
  i misread the latvian guy 's post . 
  bar is neither free of russians nor high in number of albanians, 
   rich americans live outside the city ; rich europeans live in the city center . 
  here , not so much, 
  the thing i dislike about these articles is how everyone fails to mention adopting euro increased purchasing power of the population as well . 
  euro has it 's ups and downs , if you could n't handle the downs , they should n't have adopted it . 
  every decent economist knew it was gon na come to this sooner or later . 
  i mean it 's a fucking beauty pageant competition in which the judges rate women according to their measures and physical looks . 
  there are `` ideal measures '' in this kind of competitions , and if hers were n't ideal it 'd obviously boost her chances to win as those measurements are literally the deciding factor for the winner . 
  i fail to see why people make such a big fuss over this . 
  this is almost satirical - if you visited the montenegrin coast line you 'll understand . 
  edit : you 'd *, 
  mission success !, 
  the biggest stretch ive seen on this sub lol, 
  lmao, 
  lmfao you 're such a cringy poster, 
  and poles, 
  no they would n't, 
  weird , most of the croatian posters here seem to be proud to have been part of austro hungary ... ? 
  same . 
  oh boy you have surely defeated me, 
  you already asked ... twice ... https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/56yx3u/is_there_any_way_to_stop_counterfeit_good_sales/ https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/51rv76/no_customs_inside_eu_how_can_market_eg/ you wo n't ever stop counterfeiting without the north korean approach . 
  there were n't even close to 516 ^ 18 humans born in our whole existence , let alone airports . 
  well not very correct then, 
  it was never polled , so we will never know . 
  but a considerable percentage is , yes . 
  context https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsflvx77yb0, 
  i dont dislike the english . 
  we 'd tune it down to `` harassing '' and get a fair comparison then, 
  oh you mean how killing expat poles is horrifying to people from poland , but soothing to englishmen ? 
  [ opposition accuses the ruling party to be buying votes for 250euros . 
  posts videos . 
  having bigger wages does n't mean it 's richer . 
  you 're very wrong . 
  in the top 8 european countries at water polo , there are a lot of waterpolo professionals .
