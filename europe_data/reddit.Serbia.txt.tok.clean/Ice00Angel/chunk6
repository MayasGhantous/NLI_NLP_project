  check italian and hungarian club leagues specifically - they 're huge . 
  this is your first poll , is n't it ? 
  gee i wonder who will win ... 
  if you are making a poll for / r/europe , at least do n't be lazy , and take an extra minute to put in all the countries . 
  as for the questions themselves , they 're meh . 
  thats because its him, 
  no , he 's visiting . 
  i hope the taxi cartel falls here too, 
  \u00fcber kek i actually have that song in one of my playlists, 
  i hope the gvmnt starts working towards ev project around here . 
  we produce quite a bit of renewable electricity and it 's very cheap . 
  you were literally the one that started with whataboutism lmao  do you see greeks and italians complain like hungary or poland ? 
  but i guess you 're right , it 's not the same - piigs are responsible for their crisis , while central europe is n't responsible for migrants roaming their country . 
  there are other , closer , countries that signed the geneva convention ( which syria itself has n't even signed . ), 
  you 're often gon na have to park outside, 
  i 've seen [ piigs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pigs_ ( economics ) doing its fair share of complaining in the past few years . 
  edit : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pigs_ ( economics ) the formatting messes up with brackets . 
  5 people make $ 100 gdp . 
  that 's 20 per capita . 
  gdp raises by 10 % resulting in it being $ 110 . 
  that 's 22 per capita . 
  you have $ 20 per capita . 
  your gdp per capita raises by 10 % which results in , yet again , $ 22 . 
  to get high gdp pc you raise your gdp in general . 
  i get what you mean in your post , but it makes little sense . 
  that 's because those with less problems are less affected by it . 
  as the weather gets colder , we 'll see more of these . 
  so , you 're gon na disregard unwillingness of some countries to do x by saying central europeans complain too much , and that they should sacrifice will of their own people just to comply with wishes of the stronger members ? 
  that 's what happens when your door is the first one on the way , and you 're under the threat of being buried by migrants . 
  i assume you 're somewhere western , so you do n't care much . 
  the picture shows country wide density , so it 's not important in this graph . 
  there is no way you can distribute current spain 's population differently and get a different result in this data . 
  the ` left out ' countries do n't fit the 50 + pop/km ^ 2 criteria . 
  they have less than 50 people per square km . 
  what does that even matter ? 
  even if population was more spread out , the density would n't change . 
  getting rid of them stopped being realistic during the 60s . 
  the other part of your post is arguable - the only time nuclear weapons were used on people was in the 1945 when no one else had them . 
  if everyone was facing a threat to get nuclear bombed back they would think twice before bombing in the first place . 
  why is it okay for some countries to have nuclear weapons but not okay for the rest ? 
  i have yet to see any separation movement or propaganda for sandzak seceding . 
  you 're claiming serb ethnicity does n't exist , and that we 're all the same ethnicity , while during the 90s serbs were the only ones that did n't pull out of yugoslavia . 
  during the 90s it was n't the serbs insisting we 're different people 's and we should split up , it was actually everyone else . 
  they are bosnians by nationality and serbs by ethnicity . 
  i dont see why is this so hard to comprehend, 
  you dont have to be orthodox to be a serb . 
  a lot of famous muslims from serbia see themselves as serbs , and most of them said they do so because they know their ancestors were serbs and so are they . 
  i like how you try to compare rs to other countries and as soon as you fail you start talking about a genocide lol, 
  and why would you stop this woman ? 
  too bad common sense does n't apply in kosovo independence politics . 
  coming from an albanian , this post sure as hell is n't biased . 
  i like how you didnt even read the article . 
  what why ? 
  i was correcting the lyrics, 
  i cry when angels deserve to die *, 
  wait , people here actually do n't believe serbs were cleansed in kosovo ? 
  i ca n't stomach it either . 
  surstroming is n't rotten though ... ? 
   edit 2 : why do you represent yourself as a bosnian when you are clearly a serb ? 
  his post was :  can i ask ** you ** a question , ** as a bosnian ** - what 's ... and not :  can i , as a bosnian , ask you a question ... get it now ? 
  ive yet to see a popular place where someone from my friendlist on facebook hasnt checked in yet . 
   furthermore , serbo-croatian for me is like dano-norwegian . 
  do people in denmark speak dano-norwegian ? 
  danish and norwegian are n't mutually intelligible , they do share a lot similarities , but they 're not even close to serbian and croatian . 
  source : i have both danish and norwegian friends , and they ca n't understand each other well enough to communicate properly outside of very basic sentences . 
  when it 's written it gets a little bit easier for them , like for serbian and slovenian , for example . 
  there is \u0427 in the russian and bulgarian alphabet . 
  \u0402 ( \u0110 ) and \u040b ( \u0106 ) are unique to the serbian cyrilic . 
  no serbs ? 
  what are the odds ? 
  i do n't know , but i do n't think cyrilic is same for the two of us - i learnt greek alphabet alright but it was n't the same as the 2 i 've known . 
  verbs ending on \u0107i ( pe\u0107i , i\u0107i , re\u0107i ) are separated with \u0107u , so for them its pe\u0107i \u0107u , i\u0107i \u0107u , re\u0107i \u0107u , the ones on ti are one word peva\u0107u , lete\u0107u itd . 
  whenever i see some text in latin/cyrilic i simply read it without even thinking about it , dont have to think about the letters and dont become confused by same symbols that represent different letters . 
  when i read something i dont even notice if it 's either cyrilic or latin , hell i can read words with mixed up letters from both scripts . 
  i think it 's sort of similar to bilinguality , only for alphabets, 
  there would literally be riots if the goverment did that . 
  why should we even do it in the first place ? 
  that 's the same in serbian , it 's just that this person is probably from diaspora and does n't know the grammar too well . 
  that 's the same in serbian , it 's just that this person is probably from diaspora and does n't know the grammar too well . 
  on the contrary - there is n't a single downside to using 2 scripts , so i see no reason to ditch one . 
  except for the fact they 're currenly in brussels, 
  there were none in the previous walks either . 
  there were hardcore christians going after them and `` cleansing '' the streets though . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%a0arplaninac this one i guess, 
  well you obviously never went shopping with a little kid, 
  albania ( and the rest of balkans for that matter ) wo n't even join the eu by then . 
  aw it 's okay we love you . 
  i get the word-play , zlo means evil in serbian too , but i do n't understand if it 's just a joke , or serious ? 
  some posters seem to use it jokingly , some not so much, 
  what is this zlovenia meme croats keep using ? 
  this always surprised me - the lack of wifi and/or having to do some sign up shit in a lot of countries . 
  here every cafe/bar/hotel has a wifi with actual coverage and all you have to do is ask for the password . 
  e u pm what are you studying ? 
  `` reunion '' lol . 
   just add the two northern majority serb parts to serbia and the rest to albania . 
  they do n't even wan na discuss that actually, 
  it most certainly is . 
  please ... normal people were leaving for the usa and canada , not argentina . 
  maybe argentina ? 
   serbs increased due to political reasons you mean montenegrins increased due to political reasons ?
