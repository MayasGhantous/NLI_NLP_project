  serbs and montenegrins are ethnically the same , it 's just about your personal views . 
  i know of a lot of cases where one brother considers himself to be a serb and another montenegrin . 
  it is n't . 
  i like this idea . 
  would be nice if we had a similar thread here . 
  well south east is in the asian part ... 
  0.005 % tax for the richest company in the world ? 
  richest company in the world payed more taxes than small/medium businesses , fucking hell . 
  this whole thing is a massive fraud against the irish people and the people responsible for it should be tried accordingly . 
  firstly , greenland is an autonomous country , so it 's statistics are in 99 % of the cases not included in denmark 's . 
  maybe the op did n't make the map and worded the title poorly , while the map maker wanted to show temperatures of european * countries * . 
  also even if you excluded the asian part of russia , the difference still would n't be ** that ** big . 
   counting and presenting random data from which you can not say anything meaningfull is just useless trivia . 
  i really do n't see any random data here , it 's an annual temperature average per country , for some regions it 's very inaccurate , but considering it 's not a per region statistic , it should not be viewed as such . 
  something that should be noted : western europe and mediterrean have far smaller temperature fluctuations between the seasons than central and eastern europe do but at the end it averages out to similar numbers . 
  example : temperature in the uk during the winter is usually around 0-10 degrees , while in serbia it goes from -15 to 5 . on the other hand summers are 15-30 degrees in the uk , and 20-40 in serbia . 
  the numbers are really rough and only used to illustrate a point , so do n't take them factually . 
  declaring a statistic to be pointless because you do n't like the methodology used for it 's creation is n't ? 
  longer coast, 
  poland is coastal , and coastal areas are considerably warmer than inland during the winter due to the sea releasing the heat so it raises the average a bit . 
  also czech rep is on average a bit more mountainous, 
  do n't you think you 're overreacting a bit ? 
  i really doubt it . 
  uk 's and ireland 's ties are beyond the border crossing between ireland and ni only . 
  dont the uk and ireland have a free movement deal outside of the eu ? 
  they entered serbian and lithuanian market this year , so considering their strategy of entering a market by opening dozens of stores simultaneously , i 'm not surprised . 
  osam ( eight ) and no\u0107 ( night ) here . 
  though we have devet ( nine ) and krevet ( bed ) so that 's something . 
  spanish would be problematic - ananas colada does n't sound as cool : /, 
  [ serbian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjpsfub67b4 ) he says : `` kako si dobra pi\u010dka '' which roughly translates to `` you 're such a good pussy '' pi\u010dka ( pussy ) is a swear word slang used to express a girl is a bombshell . 
  there is [ vine ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/word_for_wine_in_european_languages.svg/2000px-word_for_wine_in_european_languages.svg.png ) and [ ~ ~ pineapple ~ ~ ananas ] ( http://imgur.com/vhsa8az ), 
  tfw romanians are more slavic than the slavs themselves, 
  i did say 200 is a big difference , i meant it didnt seem like a big deal to someone whos not familiar with it . 
  thank you . 
  despite article being overly optimistic , i agree london will continue being a city of global value even after the brexit . 
  though i 'd rather read an article on how will smaller cities fare , the ones who 's appeal is n't as strong as london 's for companies to not move to the mainland . 
  how many businesses will be moved/closed/reduced in cities outside london would be a better indicator of the brexit 's aftermath . 
  i wonder what are these godlike telegraph 's business articles like so that they require subscription ... 
  faca is a slang word in serbian for face and/or hot shot . 
  pronounced as `` fatsa '', 
  [ every time ... ] ( https://youtu.be/vtvn-ffspxi?t=105 ), 
  are you thinking she 'd win more or less than that ? 
  men 's highest elo rated gm , magnus karlsen has close to 2900 , while women 's hou yifan ( the girl from the article ) is close to 2700 . 
  200 elo may not seem big of a deal , but it is , specifically in elo * that * high . 
  if i were to guess , hou would maybe win about 20 % of the times in that match - up . 
  and considering these tournaments are played by a handful of players , it would end up with male outlines ( like magnus ) dominating over the top women chess players . 
  why is this ? 
  well , chess is a sport played by men more often than women , so outliners like these happen more often for the male gender . 
  tldr : top 10 male players are better than top 10 female players due to high gender imbalance of the players, 
  alright . 
  weird seeing french people speaking serbian . 
  why ? 
  have fun . 
  ask for more if you need , i listen to every genre of serbian music so i might help ,, 
  well it 's not pop music . 
  not liking it is alright , handful of people do n't like it here as well , but calling it trashy , shit and picking 15k views genuinely shit song out of which 14k stumbled accidentally as a representative to back one 's claim like that guy did was just unfair , so i had to argue about it . 
  it 's quick , simple , catchy , has no great lyrical message , recycled melody - that 's for sure , but that does n't make it trash . 
  but as someone who is from serbia and who went to folk music , pop , rock , electro music , rnb/reagge/hiphop parties i must say i usually have the best time at the folk music ones . 
  rock comes in close 2nd but it 's not really comparable - each has their own perk , like comparing french and italian cuisine . 
  the other genres are just not as good at the parties . 
  you might also check these from lexington band which is in my opinion amazing : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btlcvfjwl78 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvtugjfwude https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e31bcpr2gr8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry1nngcsnuy, 
  her previous songs might 've been trash , sure , but these two are nice in my opinion . 
  also keep in mind i found the songs through youtube suggestions , so i probably skipped some better songs . 
  i might not the best person for the job , but here are some of the newer ones i like : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgvnmkxukus https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehlxodxgp-o https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om78qpf70zy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwd6vnaagyi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aya8o7ced_e i have no idea what these are , but i like them too : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysfcnudztsk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhpfrfhuiq8, 
  like in the most of the programming competitions for the past 20ish years : poland , russia or china . 
  thats not entirely correct , but whatever the case is , you cant take a random song with 15k views and more dislikes than likes and call it representative of the whole genre . 
  or even that stojas 20 year old trash song . 
  if you 're gon na trash the genre , at least put something representitive , not something garbage to empower your claim . 
  well i think the goal was to promote the working class , scholars and the government . 
  thats not how modern turbo folk looks `` most of the times '' . 
  the popularn songs , the ones ppl actually listen to , not the crap you linked , are far better to be honest . 
  i agree . 
  i even have the 500 one somewhere around the house . 
   \u2022 easyjet flies from gatwick and manchester to tivat ( until 27 october then starting again next spring )  \u2022 ryanair flies to plovdiv from stansted  \u2022 ryanair flies from stansted ( until 2 november then starting again next spring ) , thomson and jet2 both fly from various uk airports ( may-september only )  \u2022 ryanair flies from stansted and wizzair from luton  \u2022 wizzair flies from luton ( until 25 october ) is it just me or this seems to be more advertising than informative ? 
  i mean , if we `` never thought '' to travel there , there would n't be flights going just a bit after the article showed up . 
  and there happens to be a flight to every destination . 
  well im not entirely sure about english , but it can in serbian . 
  i used them to indicate relief is the name of the technique , not to indicate it was n't one . 
  may have misused the quotation mark . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/relief meant it as in  serbian `` vampir '' is the only word of serbian origin used in the english language . 
  considering the war in their most industrious area , it 's not that surprising to be honest . 
  oh well my bad it seems but still makes no sense, 
  interestingly enogu we 're pretty big compared zo you manlet spaniards lol, 
  yeah, 
   croats just ca n't feel comfortable when vu\u010di\u0107 and nikoli\u0107 are in power also to answer on this separetely , despite what kind of people they are , your officials have ignited far more tensions , provocations and conflicts between the two countries than ours have . 
  and i do n't believe i 'm being biased . 
  i 'm not offended , but i do n't feel like wasting time arguing with 3-4 people with kind of ego centric black and white political views simultaneously . 
  after sparking a war discussion themselves . 
  alright . 
  good day, 
  oh so you think serbia will attack the us , germany , uk and france backed croatia ? 
  you must be another one of those armchair tactical strategists . 
  you 're in nato , we 're not . 
  so it 's only problematic if we 're close but not the other way around ? 
   i do n't think that serbia being on a doorstep to dubrovnik and zagreb is a good idea . 
  we have croatia 25km away from novi sad so what 's the problem ? 
   not to mention that croatia would rather participate in a war for territorial integrity of b&h than have a serb state 50 km from its capital zagreb . 
  do n't be retarded, 
  actually neither of the countries has a claim on that pocket of territory . 
  lol that 's just not correct .
