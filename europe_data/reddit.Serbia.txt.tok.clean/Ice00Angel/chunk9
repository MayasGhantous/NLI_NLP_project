  similar stuff i just google translated : krv - krew smrt - smierc strmo - stromo, 
  trg is a square or a plaza . 
  i believe it 's rooted from the word ** trg ** ovina which means market/trade, 
  well that would even decrease revenue further . 
  from my experience , the biggest profit in infrastructural services come from cars . 
  for example tunnel and highway tolls are far more cheaper for buses per capita than cars . 
  well you seem even less knowledgeable about econ than him, 
  true , trump also plays on hard difficulty having to win the elections and having a longer border . 
  at least the usa is far richer relative to the border length . 
  though you 're confusing cars and people . 
  op calculated that it needs 1370 cars daily ( as tunnel passages are payed for the car , not for people ) while ferries have 8 mil passangers , which is a very different thing . 
  orban 2 trump 0, 
  glad you liked it . 
  the thing that sucks belgrade though are the building facades , as you may have noticed . 
  a big number of them are 40-50 years old so it does n't leave a good impression on a lot of people . 
  some are being fixed day by day , sure , but the most are n't because of the people 's financial situations . 
  we have [ these ] ( http://puu.sh/qp7dn/576f78f54d.jpg ) in belgrade , so i 'm not surprised at all !, 
  they 're great . 
  yugoslavia was established in 1918 , jasenovac was created in 1941 . 
  before you continue being stupid , use google . 
  also thanks for that insta downvote , appreciate it . 
  we were n't . 
   bosnjaks are too nice to monirties  / u/kulinban totally not diaspora bosniak, 
  please , this is really exaggerated and some of it is straight out incorrect . 
  poorer parts of montenegro are far more developed than poorer parts of serbia . 
  the wages are comparable . 
  the only parts of montenegro with tough internet accessibility are some parts of north where a few people live water outages happen only in 3 cities on the coast during the summer which are in a very dry area electricity outages are not far more common than in serbia . 
  i recently came back from montenegro and the roads are newer/better than serbian ones , but it 's true that there is no highway . 
  montenegro has other problems , but not the ones you listed . 
  regards , a belgradian who has actually been there and is n't a subject to travel agencies ' bots propagandas on news sites . 
  how is sdp compared to hdz ? 
  care to explain in short to someone who does n't follow croatian politics much ? 
  holy fuck that 's so cool, 
   this germany city and osijek are by far the smallest cities to use trams i think liepaja in latvia carries that title , though i 'm not really knowledgeable about it - can some latvian poster confirm ? 
  the prices would also go up , as there would be far more demand than before, 
  everything is possible , of course , but my post just reflects my impression of him paired with a few pictures i 've seen that indicated he 's russian . 
  serbian football federation is n't rotten solely because they werent organic to begin with . 
  they 're just trash . 
   federation is already far more developed than serb areas, 
  far more is an overstretch and you know it . 
  actually in his video about the estonian language he seemed to be unable to speak it , and refered to estonians as `` them '' . 
  he seems to be able to speak russian though e : also there 's this https://www.instagram.com/p/bjbjgofjjkt/?taken-by=the_life_of_boris https://www.instagram.com/p/bfjqn5wonwm/?taken-by=the_life_of_boris https://www.instagram.com/p/bcpyqnzunqc/?taken-by=the_life_of_boris, 
  so what there were large amounts of bosnians in yugoslavia ? 
  you were citizen of yugoslavia . 
  why did you have to split up ? 
  why not cyrilic what ? 
  it 's not that other countries are n't participating , they just ca n't get qualified , 
  we also took it from them and call vienna `` be\u010d '' ( \u010d being pronounced as ** ch ** air ), 
  she 's kinda average though, 
  yes . 
  michael phelps acquired 6 medals alone in this olympics , while football squad of germany for example , the whole ~ 20 of them acquired only 1 . katie ledecky 5 medals katinka hosszu 4 medals ryan murphy 3 simone manuel 4 etc etc usa has 33 medals only from swimming , out of which 16 are gold, 
  yup . 
  a single good swimmer can bring more medals to a country than if his country got medals in : tennis , football , basketball , volleyball , handball , badminton , ping pong ... 
  what a childish comment , and ignorant on top of it !, 
  have a nice evening . 
  i do n't like how some sports account for far more medals than the other . 
  gdp = / = wealth though . 
  even though bucharest has higher gdp than a region it does n't necessarily mean it has higher purchasing power . 
  damn ... from this subreddit i got the idea romania is doing alright , but those statistics are worse than in serbia ... 
  http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/214903/500-neo-nazis-march-in-lithuania-massacre-city/ http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/197769/neo-nazi-march-in-lithuania-in-memory-of-nationalist-heroes any plans for 2017 , lads ? 
  dumbest and the worst kind of people usually comment in the comment sections of media in serbia , so i doubt it 's any different in croatia . 
  the names are just coincidental , vlachs had been living in the region since before wallachia existed . 
  their identity is their own thing and should n't be forced onto them by neither serbia or romania . 
  the vlachs i know consider themselves to be vlachs and consider their country to be serbia, 
  to me this seems like he 's trying to achieve more popularity by showing the voters he can strong arm neighboring countries for his country 's interests . 
  vlachs have good rights here , and funnily enough they do n't even consider themselves to be romanians so romanians seem to want to force their identity onto them , by forcing our goverment to treat them as romanians . 
  thats of course not the whole story , but it 's a short version of it . 
  becasue of this news ? 
  damn you should reevaluate your life lol, 
  nato bombed belgrade because of kosovo . 
  this just goes to show youve no idea, 
   `` friends with russia '' , rather than `` enemies of the west '' . 
  and since when is n't this the case in serbia too ? 
  legend is actually so good that ive never thought of it being actually serbian . 
  by simpy not being under ussr influence i guess ? 
  do n't think so - ` commie rule ' in ex-yugoslavia was n't harsh at all , on the contrary it was pleasant at the time . 
  in the long run it fucked up our economies , yes , but people were happy . 
  dunno about the countries behind the iron curtain though, 
  the higher the gdp , the lower the growth, 
  us can be explained with : software industry  mechanical industry dunno about uk though, 
  well it is underrated on this subreddit , tbh, 
  corfu , greece . 
  oh wow you memed him so hard , friend . 
  get a load of that guy thinking he knows what hateful means hehe xd, 
  well , church is losing grasp here , so i think same will happen in croatia soon . 
   and hot women are . 
  clearly you 've not been there then, 
  it had me confused , paired with lithuanian phonetics and accents it definitely sounded russian - or at least slavic . 
  seems to me slavic people could learn lithuanian pronunciation rather easily, 
  i ca n't answer for both sides , but greek people 's mentality is similar to serbian one , to me . 
   ( anyone watched got season 6 finale ? ), 
  i have , but what does it have to do with this ? 
  it 's more related to smoking , drinking and fatty food consumption , really . 
  serbs are big smokers , yes . 
  but to you it seemed moreso because smoking here is allowed indoors - in cafes , clubs , bars etc. 
  and it 's allowed in public . 
  so , our smoking is somewhat more visible . 
  wait , is the 2nd vid language russian ? 
  that 's because these new mods are also newish to this subreddit . 
  this sub used to be more culture discussion threads like this and less about politics .
