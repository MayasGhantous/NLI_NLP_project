   no , just do n't make the deals that would break embargoes made by the political block you 're in ? 
  well , it would be nice if we could decide on our own , when we want embargoes against a country which did n't attacked a member country in our block . 
  it 's the same story as should be with immigration if some of the countries want the immigrants they should take in as much as they like but why should other countries that do n't want immigrants take in immigrants . 
  if someone does n't want them should deport them or don ' let them in . 
  so if we want to be friends it 's not enough that we like you and does n't do things that harm you .

    he was first saying that the original population was not happy when the hungarians came  nope , he did n't say that . 
  only mentioned migrations into here were of the slavs and avars . 
  he said this :   also at some point some of orbans ancestors migrated to hungary . 
    ignoring the fact that it 's a completely superficial point to make , do you think the slavs and avars around here were happy about the fact that they migrated here ? 
  because they were n't able to defend their territory centuries ago we should n't either ? 
  if orban is a hungarian and his ancestors migrated to hungary . 
  he is clearly speaking of the time when the hungarians came and the slavs and avars were unable to defend their territory . 
   so the sentence `` every german is a nazi '' is the shortcut for the combination of sentences `` every german of today has a nazi ancestor '' and `` if your people were nazis then you are a nazi too '' . 
  so what ? 
  if you say `` every terrorist is a migrant '' you 're not able to conclude that every migrant/muslim is a terrorist which would be the equal to `` if your people were nazis then you are a nazi too '' . 
   false logic again . 
  look the original sentence `` do you think the slavs and avars around here were happy '' and try to find logical expression that would comprehend it . 
  i do n't get what you are trying to say here . 
  he was first saying that the original population was not happy when the hungarians came , then you said that hungarians are not descended from the avars . 
  i said he was trying to say another thing . 
  now i do n't know what you 're trying to say . 
  maybe i am stupid or you are a little confused in the head or both . 
   they are using exactly the same form of logic : almost all germans had followed the nazi politics ( at least publicly ) just like almost all europe 's muslims came here as migrants ( except bosniaks , albanians , ... ) . 
   today 's european muslims are migrants just like today 's germans are nazis . 
  yes , germans are descended from the nazis and muslims are migrants in western europe . 
  but `` every terrorist is a migrant '' and `` every german is a nazi '' is still not similar . 
  `` every german is a nazi '' is similar to `` every migrant is a terrorist '' or `` every muslim is a migrant '' . 
   false logic : if he had intended to say that , he would have omitted the slavs from there ( or put illyrians instead of slavs ) . 
  slav people were living in the carpathian basin when hungarians arrived . 
   nope . 
  we 're talking about the form of identifying these days europe 's muslims as the descendants of the migrants from the past . 
  that form is clearly comparable to identifying these day germans as the descendants of the nazis prior to and during wwii . 
  some germans are descendants of nazis but that does not mean that a german is nazi whos grandpa was a nazi . 
  i do n't think the two quote is using the same form of logic . 
   what avars ? 
  you just assimilated them , not that you are offsprings ... 
  he was saying that avars was n't been able to stop the hungarians but that does not meen that we should n't stop the migration today . 
   btw , `` every terrorist is a migrant '' is a sentence completely the same in the form as `` every german is a nazi '' . 
  no , `` every migrant is a terrorist '' would be the same as `` every german is a nazi '' . 
  sorry , the name of the picture was a little confusing . 
  ( `` lisbon_riviera-portugal . jpg '' ) but my point was that portugal is a place where a lot of tourist goes and there is a lot of sun and beautiful beaches . 
  your economy is not like the german and there 's a crisis but it 's still not a poor country . 
  does not looks like a depressing place .
