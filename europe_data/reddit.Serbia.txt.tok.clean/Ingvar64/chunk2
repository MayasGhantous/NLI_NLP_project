  sorry , the name of the picture was a little confusing . 
  ( `` lisbon_riviera-portugal . jpg '' ), 
  [ portugal looks really depressing ] ( http://www.charmingasiatours.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/lisbon_riviera-portugal.jpg ) to me . 
  i think every book counts . 
  the question was not limited to novels . 
  good list . 
  i like to add [ korn\u00e9l esti ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8456447-korn-l-esti?from_search=true&amp;search_version=service ) by [ dezs\u0151 kosztol\u00e1nyi ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1202510.dezs_kosztol_nyi ) , [ one minute stories ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/166724.egyperces_novell_k ) by [ istv\u00e1n \u00d6rk\u00e9ny ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2872482.istv_n_rk_ny ) and anything from [ jen\u0151 rejt\u0151 ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/827677.jen_rejt_?from_search=true&amp;search_version=service ) . 
  yeah , but austrian chancellor was against every kind of fence . 
  i guess technically he is still against it . 
  `` technical barriers '' \u2260 fence, 
  ireland , estonia , finland , poland , iceland or because i am living in serbia , but i am hungarian i can just choose hungary . 
  muhaha, 
  do you mean when it had a german-speaking majority ? 
  i think hungary is interested but hungarians have their own problems too . 
  [ hungarian minorities ] ( http://www.hunsor.se/magyar1000ev/hungarians_incent_europe.jpg ), 
  i think [ mesano meso ] ( https://www.google.rs/search?q=mesano+meso&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cayq_auoawovchmiza3vu7c4yaivgxysch2aiwep ) is your thing . 
   the company owning the newspaper suspended the publication until they come up with a different business model . 
  but that would not fit the agenda , would it ? 
  and shut down their website which could bring profit standing as it is until they come up with the new business model ? 
  i 'm very curious about that new business model . 
  well , the habsburgs are freely available at the moment . 
  i did n't know it . 
  what does that mean ? 
  does she hate romanians ? 
  i thought in the communist era they tried to destroy the hungarian minority . 
  i mean i did n't hear much positive about ceausescu . 
  fun fact : did you knew that the infamous leader of the hvim toroczkai l\u00e1szl\u00f3 has a romanian wife ? 
  ethnic romanian not a hungarian from romania . 
  i 'm sure he 's planning to kill all the romanians he can . 
  i already admitted it . 
  it 's a terrorist organisation and the article is n't sensationalist at all . 
  sorry , there is an ** ongoing ** investigation against two members of the hvim . 
  i have to admit that this means that this is a terrorist organisation and all of it 's who knows how many thousand members are all terrorists . 
  how could i 've been so blind ? 
  now i 'm going to the police station and report that a few of my friends are terrorists because they are members of the feared hvim terrorist group and they illegally listened to k\u00e1rp\u00e1tia . 
  i 'm also praying to god that the police will arrest me too because i had a beer with them and who knows what building i 'm going to blow up next . 
  if they are so dangerous as an organisation then why are their two leaders who were planning the destruction of romania with 400 firecrackers in house arrest ? 
  knowing how paranoid romania considering hungarian separatism i would n't even rule out that they were framed . 
  but let 's say it 's is decided and they are guilty . 
  saying that hvim is a terrorist organisation as a whole because of these two idiots is like saying that all arabs are terrorist because some of them are blowing up stuff . 
  yes , i know that hungarians do n't like arabs but that does n't mean that this kind of rhetoric is true . 
  :d :d :d i know a few of them . 
  if drinking beer and listening to radical music is terrorism , then they are certainly terrorists . 
  hey , [ leave something for hungary . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian%e2%80%93hungarian_wars ), 
  i 'm hungarian . 
  i was just joking . 
  do n't take everything seriously , relax . 
  we 're killing their reputation before god . 
  romania can not into 100 % faith powers because of the bloody hungarian minority . 
  thanks . 
  could you share the list of names in a comment . 
  the pictures do n't say much for someone who 's from a different country . 
  hungarians will die out too . 
  everybody is moving to hungary or to england . 
   backi petrovac you forgot kova\u010dica . 
  yeah , there 's still a lot of slovakian in vajdas\u00e1g . 
  actually , i have some slovakian ancestry too . 
   as for slovakia , until year ago still believed that is some made up bullshit . 
  hungarians kept telling it and the world finally listened . 
  just kidding . 
  well , in the netherlands you got weed and eastern european prostitutes . 
  do irish people like to drink ? 
  ** yeah !, 
  ** eastern european origins are proved . 
  case closed . 
  i 'm devastated by your creativity . 
  yo , a bigger percentage is not always better . 
  ^ ^ ^ think ^ ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ your ^ ^ ^ national ^ ^ ^ debt !, 
  your username checks out . 
  unfortunately , there 's no hungarian equivalent for pasila . 
  the closest i can come up is [ ny\u00f3cker ( the district ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398237/?ref_=ttrel_rel_tt ) which has english sub according to [ subtitleseeker ] ( http://www.subtitleseeker.com/0398237/ny%f3cker%21/subtitles/english/ ) . 
  i think i saw that episode and if i remember correctly my first episode was called quite day but i 'm not sure . 
  there 's a hungarian site called [ nyelv \u00e9s tudom\u00e1ny ] ( http://www.nyest.hu/ ) ( language and science ) . 
  it 's made by linguists and hungarian is an uralic language so there are articles about related languages and cultures . 
  they wrote a few times about pasila and youtube had a lot of episodes in those days with english subs and i started watching them . 
  i really enjoyed it but the episodes got taken down shortly afterwards . 
  the site also introduced me to my favorite [ finnish song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=norgj0zivaa ) . 
  i heard you guys are played it for three months in viipori to prevent the soviet mines from blowing up . 
  the song sounds very funny to me , when i imagine that this comes from a frequency for three months i always smile . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdtrib4e0k ) you guys are really watching a lot of pasila . 
  i imagine they are going to cause a lot of trouble . 
  i was very surprised that more czech citizen is living abroad than hungarian . 
  you 're all about equal opportunities . 
  the government should start cheap flights to eesti from every finnish village . 
  everyone deserves cheap vodka . 
  just go over to tallinn and by your own . 
  the population of the village is 1812 . 
  the stadium can take in 3500 people . 
  i think this should be the standard . 
  they keep chinese kids in their basements for math purposes . 
  source : i know stuff . 
  terrifying ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ prettier , ^ ^ ^ than ^ ^ ^ nowadays . 
  well you already picked dubioza kolektiv so i do n't link to that again . 
  finland : [ kotiteollisuus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12cnbbw2n-m ) , [ elakelaiset ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9yyaknvx_o ) spain : [ ska-p ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqp4dybhnl8 ) germany : [ mista wicked ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtmrop2qq2y ) holland : [ the apers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzt40xw2skc ) france : [ les 3 fromages ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5snooi58cka ) czech republic : [ sto zv\u00ed\u0159at ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugj2a0efihc ) hungary : [ tankcsapda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyzwdrn_goc ) i can say this because i 'm minority hungarian from outside hungary . 
  hey , it could be boring if you are always the best in everything . 
  you are going to need switzerland in the eu so you can have proper competition . 
  a group of people who identifies themselves with a language even though it 's changed a lot . 
  this sounds like continuity to me . 
  the french people are identifying themselves with the french language , not with the latin etc.
