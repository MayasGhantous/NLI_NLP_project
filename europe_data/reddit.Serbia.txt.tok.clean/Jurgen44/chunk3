  why do the dutch makes these weird squiggly islands ? 
   inaccurate , one side of the history so , are you denying it happened as described ? 
  well , you should stand with your muslim brethren . 
  stop , you 're rambling . 
  throat-slitters *, 
  anyone know what that dot actually is ? 
  do n't come into eu tomorrow . 
  your problem germany , they 're draining your tax money . 
  please delete this mess . 
   in general rightwing terrorism in reunified modern germany absolutely dwarfs islamic terrorism . 
  care to provide a source for your claims ? 
  edit : did n't know asking for a source is down vote worthy ... 
   so again , there are people unemployed for years . 
  i assume they are able to work . 
  so are people still in education . 
  if they are claiming benefits because it is easier , that means they are not actively searching for a job . 
  which means that i obviously was n't talking about those actually looking for a job , or those in education , in my original comment . 
  any country is nice when you have money . 
  i thought it was clear i was referring to immigrants . 
  people still in education ca n't claim job seekers benefits and are clearly preparing for a job ( which is the ehole point of an education ) . 
  someone looking for a job is different from someone *** claiming benefits simply because it is easier *** ( made it clearer this time for you ) . 
  `` not working *** yet able *** '' and `` simply because claiming benefits is easier '' . 
  the answer to your question was always there . 
  yes . 
  if switzerland split their wealth with us , they would still be 5th . 
  pls gib . 
  the balkans are n't even marked on this map , that 's my point . 
  what is your point ? 
  balkans are n't even on this map ... 
  this is just a different way of splitting europe . 
  i thought it was pretty clear , they should be kicked out , as a final resort of course . 
  there is such thing as context . 
  he did n't include the `` as long as '' which implies i do n't care if it 's the criminals suffering , not the innocents . 
  if you are not working yet able , simply because claiming benefits is easier , you are scum and do n't deserve to live in a developed country . 
  so living off the hard work of others should be endorsed ? 
  obviously when you have so much idle jobless young men , you are going to a see a rise in crime . 
  once that cycle starts , it 's hard to get out of it . 
  i am saying that violence has already been normalised for them . 
  key word is `` can '' , a huge majority do n't have jobs in both germany and sweden . 
  refusing to integrate into society wo n't help either . 
  slovenia is part of the balkans on that map , regarding political groups . 
  a decent chunk of it is also part of the geographical map aswell , which follows sava , danube and so\u010da rivers . 
  although if we go by the geographical version , the whole of romania and vojvodina would n't be balkan ... 
  taxes . 
  providing essential services or products . 
  nothing influential really . 
  what benefit do they serve to society ? 
  they come from syria , i think they have seen enough violence by now ... 
  i await your response !, 
  you can twist it any way you like . 
  i simply stated that as long as those on the receiving end are criminals alike ( and not innocent people ) , then i could n't care less . 
  i assumed most of the crime was gamg violence . 
  ah i see , you trust google on most things , but not this . 
  if you google balkans , a nice google map shows up and it includes the whole of slovenia . 
  i thought so too . 
  did i say that ? 
  do you really think that immigrants do n't just go back to the echr ? 
  do you think that sweden made a good choice by letting all these immigrants into their country ? 
  you ca n't just cover your eyes and pretend that these issues do n't exist . 
  slippery slope fallacy . 
  rip europe . 
  wish we were more like japan . 
  as long as the benis is feminine . 
  it 's called realism . 
  a native swede did n't come from another country and has a full citizenship so you ca n't exactly deport him/her ... 
  that 'll teach 'em . 
  as long as criminals are killing other criminals , i do n't give a shit . 
  if they ca n't appreciate that they have been given a new life , then they can fuck off . 
  ladyboys are n't gay, 
  so who was fucking the thatched roof cottages ? 
  you can tell it is n't ireland because there is blue in the sky . 
  kek, 
  no , he is still alive and he is behind all current events . 
  the election of trump is just a step to his return to power . 
  what purpose does the term `` western '' even serve the ? 
  might aswell just call it `` developed europe '' and `` shithole europe '' because that appears to be more accurate based on your use of the terms . 
  wooo serbia !, 
  despite it being a logical fallacy , it does happen . 
  it 's the same in serbia . 
  it sounded a bit weird the first time i heard someone call their daughter `` son '' . 
  i believe it is used for grandchildren aswell , basically any descendant . 
  `` lay person '' ahahahahah , this is ridiculous . 
  would hate to go to this shithole of a university . 
  acts of homosexuality or bestiality were covered under one law in many countries . 
  know as `` buggery '' here in ireland , and i assume the same term is used in the british isles . 
  `` davies and wheatcroft '' i forgot those were russian names !, 
  false equivalent , but ok . 
  `` defense '' kek . 
  americans btfo . 
  when african countries are more peaceful than you ... 
  yea , it was the * excuse * that got him acquitted ... 
  i thought german was the most studied language in croatia . 
  there was a map of the most frequently studied languages in schools posted here a few days ago , maybe it excluded english though . 
  as a serb living in ireland , i can confirm there are too many croats here . 
  ( jk , love you guys ), 
  what area was that in ? 
  i would n't pay $ 4000/mo for an apartment in silicon valley ... how do banks expect us to save money for a mortgage with these prices . 
  especially with the ridiculous new requirements they have . 
  neo-nazi terrorists acts of this magnitude are extremely uncommon , neo-nazis in general are a lot harder to come by than muslims . 
  muslims are pouring into the continent in millions , so you can see how this is a reasonable concern .
