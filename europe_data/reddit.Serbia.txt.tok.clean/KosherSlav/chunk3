  really no point in arguing with uneducated , hot headed kid like you . 
  and what was the point of this conversation in the first place ? 
  ah yeah ... kosovo wo n't be a member of un and/or unesco , deal with it . 
   serbia was merely one part of a larger yugoslavia when the un and its agencies were established yes , that 's what i said . 
  not merely a part , it was one of the 6 states that formed federal country of yugoslavia . 
  do you know what a * federal * state is , how it works and how it is formed young man ? 
   there was no such country called `` serbia '' in a 1939 or 1945 ; it was yugoslavia first you say serbia was part of yugoslavia ( technically it was kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenes at first ) , then you say there was no country called serbia ? 
  do you know what a * federal * state is , how it works and how it is formed young man ? 
  all 6 states that formed yugoslavia have ** shared legal succession ** with yugoslavia . 
   serbia became an independent country only in 2006 serbia became independent country in 1835 . 
  if we discount everything before ottoman rule . 
   learn a difference ? 
  just one ? 
  at least one , that would be a step up for you . 
   serbia did not exist as a country when the un and its agencies were established . 
  serbia exists as a country since vi century ad . 
   and my sources are fine nah , actually they are not . 
  and again please learn a difference between nation , country and ethnicity . 
  i know it 's hard for someone blinded by hate to make that distinction , but you can try harder . 
  yeah , this point is invalid for sure . 
  but lithuanian team should n't allow them self to be tied in 4th quarther with fucking belgium . 
  where ? 
  edit : ok , found it . 
  how is it fair when 15-20 % of population was driven off based on their ethnicity and when all the voters and assembly are 100 % one ethnicty , without any representatives of other minorities living there . 
  if it was so `` fair '' and `` clear cut '' we would n't be in this situation that we are now . 
  the parallel stops working at `` fair elections '' part . 
  there were no fair elections in kosovo case . 
   but it 's just fine for serbia to join serbia is n't joining it , serbia ( under yugoslavia ) was one of the ** founding members ** of un and unesco . 
  you know , the countries that actually made un to begin with . 
  and please do 2 things : 1 . learn to make distinction between nation , country and ethnicity and 2 . find more relevant and respected sources . 
  tell me what would usa government do if all the mexicans living in the south decide that they do n't want to be part of usa anymore and organize para-military units ? 
  yes , you are 100 % correct . 
  but refugees are also only transiting through macedonia and hungary , and look how they handle it compared to serbia . 
  the op article talks about that . 
   maybe if the eu asked serbia to accept a quota for membership , things might change this is what pm said : `` what is it that we need to do ? 
  we want to act in a european manner , make our contribution and assume our part of responsibility . 
  we are not running away from the responsibility , but the eu needs to tell us what our responsibilities are . '', 
  the problem is eu still does n't have a solid plan on what to do . 
  now , i agree , that general sentiment in serbian population would change if refugees decide to stay in serbia . 
  but it would n't change drastically , the right wing organizations would get louder and that 's it . 
  i am 100 % sure we would n't see shock bombs , water cannons , huge anti-immigration rallies , burned refugee centers etc. 
  in serbia . 
  that was pretty impressive . 
   generation shift yeah , i know how that feels like . 
  but i 'm sure you 'll bounce back , you always had great players . 
  i know ... just joking mate . 
   lithuania 69:68 ukraine wow that 's unexpected . 
  i was expecting to see more from lithuania . 
  i guess they are not what they used to be ... or ukraine got really , really good .

  :p :d, 
  yep , seams a bit counter-intuitive ... i guess mr. orban is doing it for the votes of hard right . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tfjpo8tpiy ), 
   how is public opinion in your country ? 
  predominantly welcoming and empathic toward the refugees . 
   and how is the government responding ? 
  uh ... as best as it can really . 
  serbia is small and poor country , the big issue our government and population has is with the powerful european countries and eu and lack of action , strategy and help from their part . 
  edit : [ this artcile ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=03&amp;nav_id=95318 ) illustrates some of the points nicely . 
  it 's not about resources , it 's about strategic placement . 
  ever played risk ? 
   so this incident from 11 years ago is the reason ? 
  no , not only that , i 'll quote my self :  but on the other hand it is absurd , offensive and insulting for the albanian people who chopped the heads of orthodox christian monks , burned churches and monasteries that are on world heritage list and were built by serbian kings , emperors and monks from vi century onward , be declared protectors of said monuments . 
  and let 's not talk about the audacity of obviously orthodox christian , serbian culture , a country that existed in various forms since vi century a.d. be regarded as kosovo culture , a country that exists since 2008 and who 's majority population historically and culturally has nothing to do with said monuments and culture , except vandalising it , of course . 
  this is like calling alexander the great and hellenic culture `` macedonian culture '' , only 100 times more offensive or lets say , if african people living in france called eiffel tower part african culture . 
  maybe not the best comparisons , but that 's the gist of it . 
  if that suited them strategically - yep . 
  although his comparison is exaggerated , you ca n't really compare uck and isis , like they are the same . 
  but on the other hand it is absurd , offensive and insulting for the albanian people who [ chopped the heads of orthodox christian monks ] ( http://www.kosovo.net/hariton.html ) , burned churches and monasteries that are on ** world heritage ** list and were built by serbian kings , emperors and monks from vi century onward , be declared protectors of said monuments .

   turko-serbian slang lol ... which part ? 
  well ... i tried ... what have you done today except getting insulted for no good reason then trying to pick a verbal fight with me , also without a good reason ? 
  you should [ relax ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/relax ) young man . 
  i was just sharing a true [ anecdote ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anecdote ) in a [ humorous ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/humor ) manner , which was intended as a [ joke ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/joke ) . 
  [ no bigotry there , unless you want it to be there . 
  ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/paranoia ), 
  why ? 
  what have i said ? 
  nah , accent is def not serbian . 
  the most distinct part is when they say '' * pi\u010dka ti . . * '' and '' * ja ho\u0107u * '' . 
   starovlasi yeah i am sure vienna these days is full of old-slavic-celtic-illyrian-serbian shepherds from middle ages ... :p  montenegrins nah , \u0107 and \u010d sounds are very distinct . 
  but not in croatian way , if ya know what i mean . 
  and rest of the accent is very far from montenegrin . 
  so def bosnian . 
   sandzaklije could be . 
  obvious bosnian accent . 
  i was in vienna last year . 
  beautiful city , feels like bigger , cleaner , better preserved home . 
  intend to go there once a year , it 's not far away even by bus . 
  anyway , i was sleeping when suddenly loud shouting from the street wakes me up . 
  my half-asleep thought process : / hear shouting on the street , i understand the language / - god damn neighbours , god damn it , let me sleep , fuckshitfuck ... / more shouting / - wait , wait ... this is not serbian ... i am not in serbia ... - sounds like bos ... yep , definitely bosnian ... - . ^ - i am in bosnia . 
  o.o / i open my eyes / o.o - hotel room ? 
  - . o - oh riiiight ... i am in vienna !, 
   ... - why the fuck am i hearing bosnians shouting in vienna ?
