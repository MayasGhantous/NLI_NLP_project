  close to 40000 people applied for asylum in serbia and there will be over 60000 by the end of the year , where the hell do you think we are supposed to put them . 
  60000 is as much as kraljevo and that 's one of the bigger cities in serbia . 
  we did n't even house the refugees before them . 
  i do n't have problems with them being here but we do n't really have the money to secure them schooling , water , electricity and other things which every normal human being should have . 
  it is translated , you just need to activate subtitles . 
  can i work for that money ? 
  '' \u0414\u0430 '' for `` yes '' `` no '' does n't exist, 
  will probably be like you said , no doubt about it , they simply do n't want to stay in serbia . 
  then again , i am not really sure . 
  well , looking from a perspective of the law but it 's just mind-fuck , you can find justifications for both . 
  we can say that kosovo ( anti-bureaucratic revolution ) and crimea ( breaking of the 1992 crimean constitution ) were military occupied by the serbia and ukraine so that they were latter liberated by the russia and nato which is not far from truth . 
   also , if they 're not illegal why isnt everyone in the west accepting the annexation of crimea and why does n't your government and many others ( mine included ) accept the independence of kosovo ? 
  it mostly depends on the world support , if they give the right for independence . 
  do you have a source ? 
  it 's badly described in [ this text ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/22/kosovo-independence-un-ruling ) , actually not at all but  announcing the decision , the court of justice president , hisashi owada , said international law contains no `` prohibition on declarations of independence '' . 
  un does n't have laws for independence prohibition except in the case of external occupation . 
  it 's not . 
  there is only paragraph 3 . 
  ( i think ) that states that the regions can not be broken with external military occupation . 
  they are not under international laws because the laws about independence do n't exist in international law therefore are legal from the stance of the un . 
  it was uk and in a hand poland ( afghanistan ) that fucked their lives , it 's time for them to take the responsibility and accept all refugees . 
   and not that many apply in eastern european countries . 
  yeah , only 60 000 this year in serbia . 
  take it , 80 % of ipa funds are intended for vojvodina and 10 % are for presevo and sandzak . 
  these are all separatist regions , the amount serbs get is 20 millions a year . 
  fuck the eu and fuck nato !, 
   tzar was surely pissed off with the act that forced him into war . 
  oh , really ? 
  even if it was true , the bh was still an underground organization and serbian government ** warned ah about assassination attempt **, 
  nice history you have there but gavrilo was an anarchist . 
  young bosnia was an anarchist organization and only link to the serbian nationalism was that they could have been the secret part of the black hand ( but these are assumptions without evidence ) . 
  there is also no evidence that the target of the black hand was franz and there are even a lot of documents that the bh was against his murder , the target of the bh was potiorek . 
  and what does his ethnicity change , his ancestors are bosnians just as he is bosnian . 
  and while being culturally orthodox , gavrilo was an atheist . 
  this reminded me of [ ode to the yugoslavia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umcjv7ktvt4 ), 
  [ yes !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lthzgsdobus ), 
  because he 's the hero world deserves , but not the one it needs right now ... and so we 'll accuse him , because he can take it . 
  franz just got serb 'd, 
  he was not a serbian but a bosnian and monument is a present from the rs ( bosnia ) to serbia . 
  as a guy who really liked eating sandwiches/lepinje . 
  bad assholes these serbs are !, 
  who cares about lives when there is a delicious cake on the table . 
  do n't know , anglosaxon countries are perfectly fine with what turkey does . 
  [ related ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lthzgsdobus ), 
  but you do n't live in serbia, 
  [ euro faces existential threat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lthzgsdobus ), 
   at least they should have to drop the news-act and be honest . 
  the thing is that this kind of program does n't get popular , they will get more with the regular news . 
  in serbia it did n't get popularity simply because `` why should i watch that instead of the porn '' and in the second case `` why should i get informed from that instead of the regular news ? 
  in serbian a slang for the penis is `` budala '' / `` fool '' and it sounds like `` da vadim budalu '' `` to take out the fool '', 
  fuck you op , i thought that these are the albanian version of the gole vesti , i took the fool out for no reason . 
  because ceda snorts . 
  it 's just a game by the us . 
  us is playing good cop , they say how they tried to do anything but kosovo is a bastard so they give the right to the un . 
  however for kosovo politicians to get prosecuted by the un , serbia would need to recognize kosovo since kosovo does n't have a seat in the un . 
  edit : however if kosovo gets back into 1244 then it would be a win from serbia . 
  that 's haram !, 
   also , it 's a constant 28 degrees . 
  that 's pretty much true ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ summer . 
  good old eastern serbia , always with their witchcraft when they could have just used kandilo and 100 jevreja . 
  you were also the first which recognized our independence :(, 
   hr.wikipedia, 
  ` european values ' so , colonialism , genocide , ethnic cleansing , racism , etc. 
  i think it depends on the angle , i know that in serbia and germany you can show genitals but penis has to be in a flaccid form and vagina ca n't be shot from `` explicit angles '' to pass on the public television or as an ad . 
   so i am trying to figure out where to put my surplus money . 
  into the hookers it goes . 
  [ eh ] ( http://billkralovec.com/2012/12/03/serbia-smoking-capital-of-the-world/ ), 
  albanians and bosniaks did n't hear for the condoms . 
  visit !, 
  sve - all mir - earth as in planet earth svemir - all earths, 
  maybe for the croats . 
  serbia and vid j. earned a ton of money from that shit . 
  in yugoslav archives so it means in serbia but the dispute waits for the arbitrary or for the deal between serbia and croatia . 
  also the land is both croatia 's and serbia 's at the time . 
  switzerland and norway put serbia as the safe country so they do deport people to serbia . 
  there is no border checking between bulgaria and romania so it 's not like migrants risk something since there is checking between bulgaria and serbia . 
  actually it was called fr yugoslavia back then , it 's the same shit . 
  how come , serbia did n't exist up to may 2006 up till then it was fr yugoslavia . 
   based on an international warrant issued through interpol by serbia actually by fr yugoslavia , serbia did n't do anything , even haradinaj said that . 
   a shift in russian policy towards bosnia it 's not a shift , they were always saying that . 
  kosovo and bosnian politicians . 
  they were arrested by some arrest warrants from the fr yugoslavia , a country that does n't exist . 
   who allowed you to become this tall ? 
  do you have a cube head ? 
  it 's a joke . 
  still , do you know what is [ cocek ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0tylnn7ska ) being that you are a turk ? 
  laugh because we are neither ... 
   and those slavic beauties sorry to break it to you but they do n't really look slavic . 
   `` these migrants ? '', 
  ... `` like them '' ? 
  as in , all migrants are like syrian war refugees ? 
  as in , normal people in really shitty circumstances that have asylum rights under all kinds of national and international legislation ? 
  as someone who lives near these immigrants ( from syria and afghanistan ) , i 'd say they do n't look like you described but then again our government is only taking really bad cases ( cripples ), 
  these wall-borders already exist within eu so it 's nothing special . 
  then send them to your western neighbours . 
  ehehe , you guys fucked the lives of these people so it 's up for you to take them into your countries , serbia did n't participate in any campaign in the middle east or north africa . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq_j2c6hrz0 ), 
  ok but you guys pay for the cremation . 
  i meant we could shoot them from this side .
