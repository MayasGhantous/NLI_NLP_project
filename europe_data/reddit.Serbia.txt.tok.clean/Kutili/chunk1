they can be hilarious too . 
  today i saw , , ubi baliju da siptar nema avliju '' ( kill a bosniak so that albanian does n't have a backyard . 
  anything that rhymes eh ? 
  favourite : if we exclude montenegro ( serbian moldova ) and macedonia ( child of serbia and bulgaria ) then [ beautiful romania  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/payfabf.jpg ) . 
  i 'm still amazed how we never went to war with you guys . 
  least favourite : hard to pick , but croatia and albania are the top two, 
  hah , you crack up my joyless heart, 
  how much experience did you have with the serbian people ? 
  i suggest you visit serbia and meet them . 
  that 'll probably change your mind, 
  so much romanian love in this thread !, 
  why would you think that ? 
  because croatian army was superior , and their other adversaries were not as weak as the serbian army of krajina ( there are likely even more factors influencing this , warfare is anyting but simple ) . 
  krajina could have stood a chance with the help from srpska or fry , but both of them failed too give any . 
  they were betrayed and sacrificed, 
  i disagree . 
  i think the serbs were to blame for expulsion of croats from krajina , and croats and mpri are to blame for expulsion of serbs from croatia ( krajina as well as other parts of the country ) . 
  the idea is the same i think . 
  both poland and germany had their people inside czechoslovakia 's borders and both percieved it as wrongfu/unjust . 
  they both seized oportunity to take back those lands too . 
  yeah pretty dickish move from all three countries imo . 
  ah and now the eternal question : who was ( has ) the biggest dick ? 
  something to declare , croatia ? 
  i agree . 
  i just wanted to point out , that , when it suits them , great powers will allow or even legalize ethnic cleansing . 
  a more recent example would be expulsion of krajina serbs from croatia . 
  on both sides , serbian and bosniak . 
  it was no genocide , but a massacre of about 8000 bosniaks . 
  prior to that 3300 serbs of srebrenica and surrounding villages were killed, 
   i know that czechoslovakians occupied it i think that nazis said the same thing for sudety . 
  guess you were annexation buddies , briefly . 
  then the same thing happened to you, 
  as someone mentioned in the comments it had been decided on potsdam conference by allies, 
  simpsons are n't dubbed in serbia since they are mostly adolescent/adult oriented , altough kids watch them too . 
  same with south park . 
  only children cartoons and animated movies are dubbed . 
  if the translators are good and do n't translate jokes literrary , they can be pretty awsome and give a unique vibe to a cartoon . 
  sponge bob and tmnt ( 90s version ) are good examples . 
  in my opinion dubbing for younger audiences is ok , but for adolescents and older , well not really . 
  ah , i wrote the comment then saw the edit . 
  clearly not biased at all, 
  no , i mean write ( type , whatever ) your responses in a slavic language you use . 
  bellow write a translation of your response in english, 
  say that in slovakian . 
  in the first three rows i see nothing but squares . 
  angular glagolitic alphabet eh ? 
  this is more or less a known fact but i 'm gon na present it anyway : today the eastern orthodox churches celebrate saint cyril and methodius . 
  cyril did n't create cyrillic but the glagolitic alphabet . 
  cyrillic was created by his disciples saint clement and naum . 
  in old church slavonic the terminology used is different . 
  the glagolitic alphabet is called cyrillic and cyrillic is called climentic, 
  chicago too, 
  :p wazit y u no use slavic languages ? 
  you know at least three of them . 
  what does this one look like :p, 
  let 's try speaking slavic languages when we can understand each other :d, 
  nope , all cyrillic-using slavic countries celebrate it , and probably some non-cyrillic . 
  [ here 's the starting page of the google search in bulgaria today ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/128544/google+with+starting+page+in+cyrillic+for+bulgarian,+slavic+culture+day ), 
  yup , and there is historical basque country further south . 
  this is just the autonomous region . 
  i love editing maps , i can expand it in the morning if you wish . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/906pewk.png ) , have a revised iberia map i made, 
  i absolutely agree, 
  i see myself as serbian first ( national identity ) , then comes my town and province ( subnational ) identity , and after that supranational : european , slavic and balkan . 
  anti-christ ? 
  no , no , no , no you got it all wrong . 
  everyone knows putin is literary hitler, 
  [ gyros ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gyros ) ( or pork kebab if you will ) from greece of course , altough there are fine ones in serbia and in immigrant restaurants across europe, 
   i do n't see anything surprising in the fact that ethnies regrouped after there was a damn war between them ... 
  this was n't willing regruoping , it was in most cases violent forced relocation , in many cases people 's ancestral homes have been burned to the ground , so they have nowhere to come back to . 
   , but what it could do is make it harder for them to kill each other , and it did just that . 
  no it did n't . 
  kfor did nothing to prevent the organized murder , arson and ethnic cleansing in march of 2004 , and on numerous other occasions . 
  yup , just replace pro-russian with anti-russian, 
  have you noticed tons of anti-russian comments which are heavily voted up , which seems awfully suspicious . 
  oh wait , it does n't . 
  this is / r/europe of course, 
  the nato bombing ans subsequent occupation did stop the war , but it did n't stop ethnic conflict . 
  quite the contrary , it accelerated ethnic cleansing . 
  look at the ethnic maps of kosovo [ 1991 ] ( http://www.kosovo.net/ethnicmap_91.jpg ) and [ 2005 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:kosovo_ethnic_2005.png ), 
   you mean the un intervention that put a stop to the ethnic war ? 
  you mean a [ un non-authorised nato agression on a sovereign country ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_yugoslavia ) ? 
  stoping an ethnic war ? 
  that 's either naive , intentionaly misleading or just plain uninformed . 
  [ check this out ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_unrest_in_kosovo ), 
  smooth move ignoring my comment and instead rambling how i am brainwashed by the state . 
   why is war the health of the state ? 
  well , because war strengthens and emboldens the state in ways that are not possible without war . 
  in war , `` patriotism '' i.e. 
  reverence of the state flourishes , leadership decisions are not questioned , population is galvanized against a `` common enemy '' , the institutions of the state are free to tighten their grip on the productive output of its population through increased taxation and regulation , plights of the common people can be safely ignored in the name of `` national unity '' or `` national security '' and ideally , borders are not changed or they are extended . 
  i trust the second quote is self-explanatory . 
  i agree . 
  external threat can often serve as an unifying factor , history has showed this many times . 
   unfortunately , you seem to be heavily entangled in the propaganda of the state , in this case the serbian state which seeks to shift your anger from itself and instead deflect it towards `` the enemy '' . 
  i am not angry at the serbian state itself , but merely at it 's incompetent ruling class/politicians as well as economic hardship and deterioration of morals and values in serbian society . 
  everybody who denies operation storm was an ethnic cleansing is a neo-ustasha too me or ustasha apologetic . 
  same with srebrenica deniers/neochetniks . 
   the only way to move beyond what happened is to first start seeing your `` enemies '' as normal people , motivated by same everyday things as yourself , and not some genocidal maniacs nationalist propaganda would have you believe . 
  the only way to move beyond what happend is to remember what happaned and learn from previous mistakes . 
  ndh genocide was covered up by the communists and what was the result ?
