  just using your logic against you . 
   modern day croatia was built on the partisan movement in wwii , that started in croatia and for a large period has croats as a majority . 
  most of the croatian partisans were from dalmatia ( which pavelic gave to italy ) . 
  croats started forming a majority of croatian partisan units in 1943 after tito offered complete amnesty to collaborators from the croatian home guard and the ustasha if they switch sides and join partisans . 
  [ here 's a source in croatian ] ( http://www.tomislavjonjic.iz.hr/iii_komunisti_12.pdf )  republic of srpska never existed in any form republic of srpska is an entity of serbs living in bosnia and herzegovina . 
  so basically a serbian state within bosnia and herzegovina . 
  the serbs did n't just show up from nowhere in the 90s killed or expelled croats or bosniaks and created their own state . 
  serbs were living in bosnia and herzegovina continously since they arrived to the balkans in the 6th century and and from that time onwards formed various states on the territory of bosnia and herzegovina . 
  the first king of bosnia tvrtko i titled himself king of the serbs . 
  do you know the etymology of herzegovina ? 
  the early name of herzegovina was hum , but in the 15th century stephen vukcic change it 's nam to the duchy ( herzegovina ) of saint sava . 
  in case you do n't know your serbian history saint sava was the founder of the serbian orthodox church . 
  edit : typos, 
  by that logic croatia was built on genocide ( 1941-1945 ) and ethnic cleansing ( 1991-1995 ) . 
   kosovo was a un mandate for a transitional period , with a un task force ( kfor ) there to maintain peace . 
  [ and they did such a good job maintaining peace ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_unrest_in_kosovo ) . 
  let 's look what happend in [ podujevo for example ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybspn8fciqq ), 
  so you mean after russians and ukrainians start killing each other then crimea can deserve it 's independence ? 
   referendum in kosovo was held according to the guidelines of the osce and had observers from international organizations watching over it to be carried out fairly and legally . 
   the kosovo independence referendum was held in 1991 . and nobody except albania recognized it . 
  there was no referendum in 2008 , just an unilateral declaration of independence . 
   i just trust kosovo more to not trample the rights of its serbian minority . 
  i suggest you watch [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nhwswogtiw ) and [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt0eaobjvpa ) for starters, 
   crimea could be demilitarized and be russian speaking part of ukraine with large autonomy like \u00c5land is swedish speaking part of finland . 
  crimea is strategically the most important area on the black sea . 
  good luck with demilitarizing that . 
  my god that is true . 
  read [ this guy 's post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1znh5e/ukraine_how_and_why_we_ended_up_here_all_the/ ) . 
  it 's somewhat pro-yushchenko and very anti-yanukovich , but a great read nevertheless . 
  and i i thought serbia was lawless . 
   what america has done is absolutely irrelevant to what russia is doing . 
  actually , it is relevant . 
  usa along with most of it 's nato allies , from 1999 to the present day , has been infringing on the sovereignty of yugoslavia ( latter serbia ) through an illegal military intervention , and later set up a terrible precedent by recognizing the unilateral independence of kosovo in 2008 . 
  this recognition was illegal and violated the the un charter , the constitution of serbia , the helsinki final act , un security council resolution 1244 and the badinter commission . 
  when the majority of un security council members violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a nation , this gives the excuse to other nations to do so as well . 
  and that 's what happened in the russo-georgian war when russia violated georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity by recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia . 
  and vladimir putin can and [ is justifying his actions about russia 's interference in ukraine ] ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/transcript-putin-defends-russian-intervention-in-ukraine/2014/03/04/9cadcd1a-a3a9-11e3-a5fa-55f0c77bf39c_story.html ) the same way , precisely because of usa 's , britain 's , france 's etc. 
  actions regarding kosovo . 
   i do n't give a shit what america has done . 
  you were justifying american invasions of afghanistan and iraq in one of your previous comments , so i think you do give at least some if not a lot of your shit . 
   when america is doing something that is wrong you can be sure they 'll get shit for it . 
  i surely hope so . 
  actually america did it first to yugoslavia , and it was much bloodier and destructive . 
  but somehow , you fail to mention that . 
  [ * usa * has infringed on the sovereignty of * non - * neighbouring country without legal justification , and even worse they have done it through military intervention which is highly illegal . ], 
  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_yugoslavia ), 
   america invaded one country that was harbouring terrorists and another that had a long history of conflict with america that also mass murdered his own people and was committing genocide against the kurds . 
  and this is american apologism, 
  [ youth work actions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/youth_work_actions ), 
  we will give up kosovo and metohija when the english let go london and the brits abolish monarchy, 
   and with the 97 civil war ( to protect yourself ) there are still a lot of weapons available like the ak47 please , tell me more about this civil war . 
  it is true . 
  i just watched an interview with one of the assaulted reporters on serbian national tv, 
  i mean why did n't he just marry his sister , right ? 
  we also have a comparison , , in debt like greece '' . 
  as for '' he smokes like a turk '' nobody regards that idiom as anti-turkish , it 's more like a historical stereotype turned comparison kind a thing . 
  we also drink a lot of turkish coffee , and i thought you did too , but then i went to turkey and there was \u00e7ay everywhere, 
  turkey annexed [ hatay ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hatay_state ) from syria , that way, 
  they proved incosistent, 
  shame on you uefa , shame on you, 
  i guess because non-english brits are celts just like irish , and they too have been subjugated by the english . 
  an irishman told me once that scots are collaborators and there is a whiskey rivalry between the two nations, 
  imo we hate so many of our neighbours and hostile great powers that it is hard to say who do we hate the most . 
  by that definition , former yugoslavia is western europe, 
  russophobic retards if i may add, 
  i for one , welcome our new russian overlords, 
   dude , you 're all calling him here duke and that 's a title in fascist chetnik movement hierarchy . 
   chetniks were n't fascists . 
  quite the opposite . 
  they were the first to [ liberate a european town from nazi occupation in 1941 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_loznica_ ( 1941 ) . 
  their leader draza mihajlovic was awarded the military cross by the british , croix de guerre 1939 -- 1945 by the french , order wojenny virtuti militari by the polish , \u0158\u00e1d b\u00edl\u00e9ho lva by the czechs and the legion of merit by the americans . 
  he said that if he gets the money he will give most of it to his party , charity and cultural institutions of serbia ( e. g. matica srpska ), 
  happy revolution day greek bros !, 
  next year in constantinople , 
  what happened to turkey ? 
  it seemed rather safe until recently . 
  now there are terrorist attacks every now and then . 
  the thing is macedonia was the heartland of our ethnicity too . 
  it was a source of early slavic culture , clement and naum gave us the cyrillic script , ochrid archbishopric was the the center of orthodoxy until we gained our own autocephaly . 
  skoplje was the capital of the serbian empire , king marko mrnjavcevich which capital was prilep , is our most revered hero in serbian epic poetry etc. 
  in our historyography macedonia along with kosovo and rashka is reffered to as old serbia . 
  our king milan fucked up the relations with you bulgarians by instigating the unjust and needlesly agressive serbo-bulgarian war . 
  so instead of natural allies with macedonia as a uniting point , we became bitter enemies with macedonia as a point of contention . 
  go away greedy bulgar , you already have pirin macedonia . 
  you should worry about your own kebab and remove it from \u041e\u0434\u0440\u0438\u043d,

  you mean temporarily independent kebab infested southern serbia ? 
  what about latvia ? 
  potato famine ? 
  edit : now i see your oppressed heterosexual minority flair, 
   stalin and ** hitler ** together killed 14 millions if you count hitler and stalin together of course the number will skyrocket . 
  i am aware that belarus lost quarter of it 's population in wwii . 
  poland lost 17 % , yugoslavia 10 %, 
  stalin was a power-hungry murdering sociopath , but compared to the khmer rouge he seems almost benevolent . 
  during their four-year rule over cambodia they killed approximately 1.7 million , thus commiting genocide on their own people ( 21 % of the population of the country ) . 
  actually a referendum on remaining in yugoslavia was held in serbian areas . 
  it was approved by 98 % of voters , and republika srpska was subsequently established on 9 january 1992, 
  i wonder what denomination they chose, 
   in 1992 , 99.7 % voted for the independence of bosnia and herzegovina more then a third of the population , mostly serbs , boycotted the referendum,
