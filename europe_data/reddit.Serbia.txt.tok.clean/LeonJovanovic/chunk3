  who gives a shit about us , they are only activating sanctions when they arent gaining any money or influence . 
   that would help their economy, 
  i honestly belive it should be held in greece every time since that would help their economy and they have history on their side . 
  i ask because on the internet especially this sub people have stereotypes , and fall under the shadow of propaganda . 
  for example propaganda is that we are only one guilty in war in 90s , while croatia and albany are saints . 
  and while we do take big amount of guilty aspect , our neighbors do too . 
  we are considered murders , filthy nation , thiefs , terrorists etc. 
  our country had 0 lobby in our favor for last 20 years and even if you wanted to read about our side of story you ll need to try really hard to find such source . 
  therefore we tend to get angry because even tho we are perfectly normal even the least racist country in europe ( there was research if you google it you ll find it ) and really warm welcome people we tend to get labeled by western people . 
   france no longer sees the departure of president bashar al-assad as a priority in the syrian conflict maybe not whole eu but good chunk of most developed countries are . 
  sad to say neither us nor rusaia nor eu fight for moral reasons . 
  they only care for interest . 
  russia = assad which means us & eu = rebels . 
  its not ? 
  look at libya today , 1 of 3 people living in poverty and before france , us & friends it was among richest countries . 
  swedish house mafia, 
  ok i say its true claim you say its false . 
  why would your thinking be any more better than mine ? 
  tell me when were us right and rest of the world not ? 
  and for past 20 comments you once didnt said anything about wars you started in middle east . 
  go to google images and type city that you `` visited '' and type before and after us came . 
  just see those images , and if you still think it was good that us destroyed so many lives , homes , families than you are truly lost . 
  i am pretty sure you are in denial . 
  as sson as paper is against us it must be false claim . 
  i can bet you havent read 1/5 of that article . 
  and many other respectable websites shared his study . 
  stop reading only us papers only us websites and maybe you will stop living in a lie . 
  ** you killed people all over world for money , 37 interventions since ww2 , you ruined cities to the ground , destroyed so many economies . 
  i was in lybia before `` peace '' came . 
  beautiful country with beautiful people . 
  after us & co ? 
  ugly ruins with 0 progress . 
  most of the world hates you , but hey , stay delusional how you are the peacemaker , how you are strongest , you are best . 
  what goes around , comes around . 
  and you ll get yours soon enough . 
  and noone except yourself will be sad . 
  since you are avoiding it . 
  how do you justify this ? 
  you are so delusional . 
  even if this is true and i wont belive that number is 50 % because you did not provide single source , that still doesnt make excuse for killing all those people . 
  you say you want peace ? 
  how then most of the world thinks you are the main threat to world peace ? 
  wow , you lost 0.32 % of your entire population and that is the reason to kill 20 million people on middle esst ? 
  you t\u017erealised there sint neutrality so you were part pf modt big wars since ? 
  then where were europe countries ? 
  france and uk were with you to some extent , but rest ? 
  yugoslavia lost 7-11 % , poland lost 17 % , portugal 9-15 % , australia 15 % and you dont see them goimg to middle east killing everybody . 
  dont try to make an excuse for allowimg your gov to kill innocent people . 
  how fuvcking dare you ? 
  you think any of us wanted war ? 
  you think any young men wanted to go there to risk their lives ? 
  you think you are the only country that lost people ? 
  you have only lost 0.32 % of your population . 
  many countries lost so much more and you dont see them going around and killing and dedtroying countries ? 
  you killed 20 fucking million people in middle east in the name of the peace ( oil ) and you dare to say you wanted peace ? 
  fking ignorant americans, 
  first , idiot , one thing you need to learn is that history is always written by victorious and their side of story . 
  second if you wanted neutrality so bad how come went full 180 , never looked back and went full ham ? 
  that doesnt seem like true neutral country , it looks more like bubble that is going to burst , and it bursted during ww2 ( intentional or not ) . 
  and third , if you going to write  read and be enlightened dont link fucking wikipedia that can be edited by anyone . 
  oh here we go again . 
  japs attack on perl harbor was sole reason you entered ww2 . 
  so if that was all because of japs , you would try to go for neutrality again after ww2 , and wont create any military intervensions . 
   the us even stayed out of the league of nations to avoid being drawn into another war . 
  it was the only major power to do so . 
  oh jeez you expect me to believe that you went from unwilling to go to war to have major profitable wars just because someone else forced you ? 
  us wanted to go in wars so badly . 
  also you werent major force until something between 1880-1890 , so we need to praise you for keeping your dick in your pants for 30 years then fucking everybody so hard for next 100 years ? 
   that list is rather bullshit . 
  you have numerous un operations and defensive treaty obligations on it . 
  list has every single usage of your army , surely you can clearly see difference between un actions and wars in middle east & friends . 
  who gives a shit if you werent in any alliances 150 years ago . 
  i am talking about you saying that you want to be left alone when here is it list of military interventions of us since 1890 and if you check out last 60 years you ll see you did everything ** but ** sticking to your own problems . 
  http://imgur.com/a/ad839 yea i believe ** someone ** does not know their history . 
  since this map really reminds me of gdp one , what do you think , is gdp huge factor in innovation index ? 
  maybe people in more developed countries have more resources for innovation process ? 
  that said , i would love to see same index adjusted to bdp per country . 
  by left alone you mean sticking your nose in every conflict and playing international policemen for past 60 years ? 
  source of graph ? 
  then fuck you hypocrite . 
  you saying someone should be responsible and admit when they did wrong thing . 
  and you go around saying serbia did massacre in war where total casualties were 12k from which 40 % were serbs but in wars where you guys killed 20 fking million you wont comment ? 
  fucking ignorant americans ... 
  i said there is other part of the story and that besides serbia doing terrible things out neighboors did similar . 
  thats not justifying . 
  but you on contrary wont say killing 20 fucking million people is a massacre and becaose of that i wont reply to you anymore . 
  people dont understand that everybody cares about justice , democracy , right thing to do until that isnt in their personal interest anymore . 
  jesus christ , this isnt about which economy is bigger . 
  russian gas will always be cheaper than us gas . 
  us isnt sanctioning russia because they care about ukraine but rather because they want to seize the moment to make some serious buck . 
  germany and any other country wont do something that will hurt their country for `` justice '' ( and by justice i mean us getting richer ) ** politics are always about personal interest and nothing else **, 
  respect, 
  seriously i think i havent seen one good looking english chick in real life, 
  rarely you see weak country with true democracy , its usually election of us , eu and russia favourite candidate . 
  you really think vucic would be president if eu & russia dont support him ? 
  same was said about this years election :(, 
  we can exploit many stuff , but only if we have professionals who know what they are doing . 
  if you see resume of our people in charge you would understand everything . 
  i guess you only met online serbs ?
