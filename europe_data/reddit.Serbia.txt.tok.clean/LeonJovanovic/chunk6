  you butchered whole fking area . 
  millions people lost home , hundreds of thousands lost lives , you ruined several countries and just because of oil and money , so please hippocrates get the fuck out, 
  its wrong that everyone knows mostly only about srebrenica . 
  most of the people doesnt know anything besides sentence `` serbs did genocide '' and yes bbc documentaries arent objective , neither are cnn ones . 
  political documentaries are one morr type of propaganda . 
  just look what cnn is saying about trump or putin in their documentary while being silent about clintons . 
  totally objective . 
  i wont repeat myself , there is my reply here somewhere about current gov. 
  i dont ask them to bash him and to openly criticize him ( although lets be honest , if they really dont like aomeone in most cases they wont say it but from their actions you will see it ) , but also not to support him . 
  supporting him means they approve him and his actions . 
  now about his actions . 
  also huge amount of examples , i ll try to explain . 
  yes there was presidential election few months back and he won with 55 % . 
  now you need to understand few things . 
  campaign . 
  he has voters that doesnt have internet . 
  he controls all media with national freq . 
  example : during race he was 93 % of all political ads on tv while rest 10 candidates were 7 % . 
  every single media is praising him or spining news in his advantage . 
  before election he was our pm . 
  he also used his time as pm to promote himself as much as possible ( which is forbidden ofc ) . 
  opposition mainly used facebook for campaign , few of them had few billboards in belgrade . 
  so all voters in rural areas knew mostly only vucic . 
  suppression there were many ( i mean a lot ) of reprted cases where directors of state owned companies were forcing workers to vote for vucic or they will get fired . 
  this was really common among teachers and doctors . 
  if for example someone finds out you are for opposition , or you give statement against vucic you ll probably either get fired or downgraded . 
  bullying there were also cases of physical contacts where people would go from door to door and ask will you vote for vucic . 
  there were a lot of incidents where his bullies were stationed in front of voting place and check your vote . 
  bulgarian train . 
  expression that describes following situation . 
  how can be sure you voted for vucic and not just lie ? 
  well they give you ballot paper with circled vucic and you need to return brand new ballot that you got inside . 
  ofc they have official ballots in stash aince its vucic we are talking about . 
  700-800k missing votes . 
  in serbian records there are 700-800k more voters than it should be . 
  nobody knows what happend with them . 
  now since we are country where dead vote ( dead serious , couple of reports like this ) i would be surprised he took those 700k for himself . 
  since all that mess there , we cant count votes from there on the spot but rather we need to transport them to bigger city and count there . 
  security of those transports that carried boxes with votes were non existent . 
  this was confirmed that they switched whole vote boxes with boxes full with vucic 's votes . 
  old and stupid people . 
  on top of everything you have those people that are brainwashed by his constant lies on tv . 
  literally brainwashed . 
  also when they hear that eu and russia support him they are like who am i to say different . 
  8,9,10 ... , -  infinity but one of the most important things here is question : why dont you report all of this ? 
  to whom ? 
  he controls media , justice , courts , prosecution , police and military . 
  there was case with proven unedited video of vucic supporters putting circled vucic votes into sealed box . 
  police discarded video saying they were just joking . 
  and there are numerous irregularities in everyday contracts , money missing , forgeries ... and you cant do shit about it . 
  ** our president has fake degree . 
  our major of belgrade and minister of police have fake phd ** proven but prosecution simply wont open case . 
  we are under dictatorship and west and russia ** supports ** it . 
  i know they shouldnt interfere with local elections but atleast dont make it worse . 
  like nato gives a shit about some genocide . 
  if you guys care about human lifes you wouldnt kill hundreds of thousands innocent people in middle east . 
  collateral damage . 
  you dont give a shit about women in saudi arabia having as much human rights as that tissue you jerk into , but you do care about some dictator in north korea and omg he can kill us all , while all koreans in south korea are saying its just pr stunt . 
  arent you tired of using ** bringing peace ** phrase when simply you can say i want millitary base on kosovo , i wont your oil , your oil , oh you have it too ? 
  yes your oil too then !, 
  ah , the `` balkan '' specialty . 
  if you see some nationalistic news from any balkan country you know there are some elections coming up . 
  well your flag says eu , so i was refering to france and uk mostly no need to get emotional, 
  i did now waiting for you to do the same . 
  you are one of eu libtards it seems and this will be my last comment to you . 
  good affairs is having deals that benefit both parties . 
  good affairs is supporting each others economy . 
  good affairs is helping when asked to help . 
  good affairs is when you send congratulations letter/email/call after some good or sorry letter/email/call after some bad event . 
  good affairs is ** not ** condemning liers , thiefs and criminals and lying to people in serbia that those people are step forward when in fact our media is in worst shape in terms of free press . 
  our justice isnt independent as well as police and military . 
  that is ** not ** good affairs . 
  thats ** i 'm helping criminals so i can get what i want ** affairs . 
  good night . 
  exactly !, 
  so basically what i want is for merkel , putin us , sa , china and rest of the world to stay the fuck out of our country . 
  but sadly you arent correct and they love sticking their nose in other people business . 
  its huge story and i have to sleep . 
  in short , no one knows completly what happend . 
  when you are serb , most of us have someone or know someone who served there . 
  and from personal talks from trusted people i made that conclusion . 
  also we all know nobody is telling whole truth . 
  the ** truth ** is somewhere in the middle . 
  oh jeez , how sometimes i hate humanity . 
  1 alternative , leave country as most of us do as soon as we finish college . 
  alternative in 50 year ( when all these assholes die since they wont give up power so easy ) we finally get gov that cares about serbia , we play neutral as much as we can since we are surrounded by both nato and eu and improve our country . 
  huh i ll try to sum up everything . 
  basically vucic ( our ex pm now president ) owns country . 
  he was elected after fair and square after people lost fate in democrats since they also were stealing too much . 
  vucic is smart , asshole , lying and manipulitive egomaniac , but smart . 
  he knows how to control our media , old pople , uneducated people , people without internet . 
  on last election he had 93 % of all political showings on tv . 
  most opposition campaigns were on facebook or online . 
  he is also good boy . 
  merkel likes him becase god know what did he give her . 
  maybe accept more refugees or whatever but he ( aside from new french president ) was the only one she accepted to meet during election period . 
  he also got green light from russia , and he kinda always had good relationship with china . 
  he is selling us as low paid work force . 
  he is selling land cheap for foreign companies to come and pay him big , pay us nothing and make profit . 
  so to average voter he is almighty leader .
