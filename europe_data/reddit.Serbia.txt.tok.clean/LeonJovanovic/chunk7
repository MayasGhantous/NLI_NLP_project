  now you can ask , is it possible you dont see it . 
  he and his crew are worst of worst . 
  our ex president has fake degree . 
  our belgrade major has fake phd as well as minister of police . 
  all of this was proven but noone can take this to courts since he owns justice , police , military etc. 
  son of one of his men ran over a girl with his fansy car , killed her on spot and didnt served single day . 
  now , how is west making things harder , is by supporting him . 
  numerous times merkel said serbia is going to good direction where in fact we are standing firm in the spot . 
  also croatia that is really similar to us got into eu , and by talking to lots of them things arent much better than before joining . 
  eh , to their defense , most of us are realistic that we did some really bad stuff . 
  but when whole fking world ( atleast west part ) is pointing finger and saying killers , like only bad guys here are us , you get like fuck you all . 
  like when parents have favourite child and it aint you . 
  in movies we are bad guys , in news we are bad guys . 
  i remember going to movies to watch mission impossible 4 ( i think ) and one line was like , `` what is better excuse than x dead serbs '' i mean whole world is one big hipocrisy and we are on wrong end . 
  i dont need any empathy but imagine this picture . 
  in last 20 years we lost territory from which serbia was born like 1300 years ago . 
  thats a lot of history . 
  we also became only bad guys in balkans where everyone did their fair share ( proportionally to their size and strength ) . 
  we got bombed . 
  we had war that destroyed our economy . 
  and after all that we still have those assholes in our gov still ruining country . 
  do you know how many times i was asked , do you wear guns in streets , i was like noopee . 
  strength of propaganda . 
  oh so you know about srebrenica ? 
  what else can you tell me besides info on wikipedia ? 
  maybe link some unbiased bbc documentary ? 
  you dont know shit about events on kosovo . 
  99 % of both serbs and albanians dont know what happened . 
  we all know our sides and all of us are too afraid to research more . 
  everything we know are from media . 
  and media always writes side of story we want to hear . 
  yea yea serbs are bad guys , criminals , assholes , killers . 
  i have heard everything . 
  and yet we have lowest racial index in whole europe . 
  https://www.indy100.com/article/racism-europe-mapped-harvard-university-implicit-association-test-7717886 there are always two sides of every story and truth is somewhere in them middle . 
  for example women in saudi arabia have 0 rights , in fking 2017 but you people rather want to talk about bad dictator in north korea . 
  you eat whatever your media serve you . 
  how much innocent people did us killed not in serbia but in middle east in name of peace ( oil ) and you dont call them killers ? 
  has serbia committed crime . 
  yes . 
  whole fucking balkan was mess . 
  there was also mass killings of serbs , but you want hear that from western media . 
  have albaninas killed huge amount of serbs on kosovo . 
  yes . 
  but nobody reads about that since albany is ally with us and us has biggest military base on kosovo . 
  they used serbian kids as human shields . 
  but you wont read that anywhere . 
  but the ** most important thing ** ** west doesnt give a shit about genocide . 
  they dont give a crap about democracy . 
  ** if they do , they wouldnt support our current gov ( as they do , especially germany ) and describing it as step forward for serbia when those guys made huge profit and did terrible things in 1990s . 
  so dont get started with `` they did want to stop a freaking genocide '' . 
  spoiler alert . 
  they dont give a shit . 
  only interest . 
  honestly , i was pro eu always but last 3,4 years i realised they are same shit as everyone . 
  if eu really cared about keeping democracy they wouldnt support our whole government led by vucic since he and his boys are everything but democracy . 
  they lie , steal , manipulate , and even tho west and germany know this , they still are supporting them ( especially germany ), 
  honestly nobody knows what happend down there for sure . 
  but i guess people love to trust their media since they are always based on facts / s, 
  how many politicians or government officials died in those bombing runs ? 
  0 how many innocent people died in those bombing runs ? 
  several thousand . 
  i am amazed how can you even say that those people deserved every bomb . 
  nato never wanted to free serbia of political scum or to show justice . 
  or they have very sick view of justice . 
  innocent ~ ~ serbia ~ ~ serbs were ~ ~ invaded ~ ~ killed by terrorist . 
  those who were bad guys and those who needed to be locked away still rule here , but now as german puppy supported by germany and whole eu . 
  yea because killing totally innocent people is right thing to do . 
  would you not support a puppy that moves on your command ? 
   they were dicks in the 90 ' there is always two parts of same story . 
  in war its rare that only one side is 100 % guilty . 
  but none the less , truth is that we are only one to be blamed ( our gov more specific ) since they neglected kosovo for too long and albany took their chance . 
  in this whole story mostly i do n't like feeling that kosovo is being pushed to be independent no matter what by us . 
  they got football representation even tho they did n't get all votes in un . 
  politically we are `` neutral '' and personal we are more connected to russia ( in general ) . 
  we are in good political relationship with montenegro but as you can guess after separation it went to worse . 
  personally people like each other since we are very similar . 
  my concern is that when i was in mn very high % of people , to whom i spoke to , were against joining nato and those were young people . 
  there wasnt any nato referendum in montenegro that would decide should they join or not . 
  that isnt democratic way . 
  edit : last 5 polls were : may 2017 - for/against 55 45 ** +10.0 ** dec 2016 - for/against 49.88 50.12 ** -0.2 ** 26 jun 2016 - for/against 54.2 45.8 ** +8.4 ** 24 jun 2016 - for/against 50.5 49.5 ** -1 ** 28 may-5 jun 2016 - for/against 39.9 60.1 ** -20.2 ** so average during last year is ** -1 ** in my opinion in this case gov had obligation to call for referendum , but they were too afraid they would loose . 
  and you think this accusation isnt propaganda ? 
  most of the countries are involved in each others election , especially if its impprtant . 
  yea you are right , i confused those two . 
  non the less i saw them both in istambul , although burqas much more rare . 
  also its creepy af seeing couple of women walking in black burqa . 
  i ve never been to england , but finding women that wear burqas in istanbul isnt hard at all . 
  give me example then . 
  see venezuela , 2 million people were protesting in the capital city and what ? 
  they didnt achieve anything , because west isnt on their side . 
  there is no single successful protest/rebellion that is n't controlled by some 3rd party . 
  have you ever visited libya ? 
  you can always google before and now pictures . 
  ofcourse every country has problems and i am not picking sides , but do you think people from libya lived better then under `` terrible dictator '' or now , when they live in literally ruins . 
  there were protests before 2011 , but when west came libya turned to true war zone . 
  nobody there truly wanted civil war except leaders on rebel side . 
  people there lost everything . 
  and tell me one thing . 
  look venezuela . 
  there were protests much bigger than those in libya and us & eu are turning their blind eye to them .
