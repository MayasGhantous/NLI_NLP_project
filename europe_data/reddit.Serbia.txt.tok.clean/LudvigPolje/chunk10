  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_vojvodina ) , read more about it . 
  i heard in one greek song '' magazi '' , it resembled a lot to '' magaza '' , which is older word in bosnia for shop or storage room - it turned out that it has same meaning in greek , i assumed it 's a turkish - borrowed . 
  i sad clearly '' at the time '' . 
  look :  at the time, 
  actually at the time banat and whole today 's vojvodina had serbian majority , multiculturalism came only with austrians conquering it in 1718 . 
  banat for 166 years . 
  absolutely !, 
  i 've watched a movie some time ago with plot being situated in bosnia in late 30s , early 40s - and turkish words were much , much , much more often than in modern languages . 
  here provisional licence looks like [ this ] ( http://ltablice.com/images/stories/clanci/dozvola_korice.jpg ) , unlike [ normal ] ( http://www.kingstarsm.com/fotke/voz1.jpg ) one . 
  beginners are required to place [ this ] ( http://autoskolastop.rs/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/probna-vozacka.jpg ) - \u041f for \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a ( beginner ) - on glass both in front and behind . 
  5 yrs ??? 
  wow , too much . 
  in serbia it 's only 1 year . 
  i am sick of having a provisinial licence and having to place sign of a '' beginner '' every time i go somewhere by car , i think 6 months for a person who drives 2-3 times a week would be more than enough . 
  how it 's enforced ? 
  literally not at all , i drive normally though i would have to drive with 10 % less speed than maximum one . 
  okay , let 's put it this way : it 's interior , surrounding , even exterior looks way more humane and suitable for living than communist architecture most of us are living in . 
  the whole concept , of demolishing a house and raising a smaller building , is something we should stick to in the future , no need for dozens of flats in one entrance alone . 
  actually third building is kinda cool on this pic , it does n't look so cozy from the outside . 
  from my town , [ 1 ] ( https://srbija-nekretnine.org/oglasavanje/fotografije-2017/06/o824636-f1.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://panbaumax.rs/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160118_124544-640x400.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( http://panbaumax.rs/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/mg_6470-640x400.jpg ), 
  it 's always hilarious with blacks who are selling leather purses . 
  serbs who come on vaccation always teach them some idiotic phrases in serbian which they repeat all over again ( thinking it would boost sale ) , making fun of themselves while we laugh our asses out . 
  anyway i happened to be in thessaloniki in winter and a black guy with bracelets came to me ( i assume it 's same guys who sell leather during summer ) , anyway he approached me speaking something in greek , i was like : '' i do n't know greek '' , he said - and i had n't give him a fucken clue about it - '' aaa , foreigner . 
  where are you from , serbia ? '', 
  i was like : '' yeah ... ( wondering how he guessed , perhaps because i was wearing air max trainers lol ) '' - from where ? 
  i was about to hug him for telling banjaluka is in serbia , but he started putting me that bracelett around hand - i did n't wanted it because i knew he would ask for money later so he just went away . 
  not too many muslims around here, 
   wonderful not so long ago we also used to be a small country but very famous on global stage, 
   imposed by capitalism blame communism equally on destroying institution of arranged marriages - among other things i believe this is one of most important for sustaining long term high fertility rate , simply because people used to marry at early age and produce already several children by the age when modern people enter marriages today . 
  but individualism is gaining momentum today rapidly , earlier , a woman could have a number of children while still having time for herself , because her mother or her mother-in-law or her sisters or husband sisters could have looked after children , today there is n't any family who is n't in some sort of quarrel , meaning a lot of women need to be with kids almost all the time . 
  though , i think fertility rate is recovering , i have n't seen this many kids around for a lot of time . 
  were you participant of war against serbia in 1999 ? 
  ~ ~ cars ~ ~ fuel ftfy, 
  which branch were you in ? 
  we have our own currency , dinar - 1 euro is 119 dinars at the moment . 
   assuming housing will be rented depends if you live in countryside or in town . 
  if you pick countryside , which is way more idealistic for eldery couple , with greenery and peace , you can buy a house in rural serbia for up to 10k euros . 
  ( dinars are used for everyday things but euros are used for buying properties and cars ) . 
   what is the expected cost of living again depends where would you live , no more than 600-700 euros, 
  to receive pension from serbian state you need to pay into \u0420\u0424\u0417\u041e - retirement and medical insurance state fund , where both employees and employers pay equal contributions over the years . 
  of course you can come and live here with your own pension , it is more than encouraged . 
  old , miserable and looking like as they are about to colapse buildings from mid 19th century , in my area . 
  refugee crisis . 
  still seeing causes of it here on streets , even in my town . 
  not from dubliners but foggy dew is just awesome and inspiring one . 
   water polo non-southern european playing water polo detected . 
  i was keeper . 
  got bored from it - though i was a good one . 
  quit . 
  played basketball , volleyball , rowing and water polo also . 
  yea , i forgot that siding with russians brings many , many negative karma in every sub which has a '' europe '' word in it . 
  yea , after invading one country best thing to do is to tell in front of whole world he would invade another one . 
  so tactical . 
  i am more than well informed on mena conflicts , if you are talking about saddam crimes , america needed to have a majority at security council for going on a noble campaign to save people of iraq from him . 
  which they did n't . 
   who forced the ussr again i 'm talking about russian sfsr and ukrainian sfsr as * federal republics * , maybe you did n't get . 
   i do n't remember russian sfsr of all people you estonians really need to know that in totalitarian societies nobody had a word except a top person . 
  wow , what an oversimplification . 
  a federal republic at order of man who runs all of federal republics * gave * a territory to other federal republic . 
  more like - if a thug forces you to give a phone to his girlfriend , would you say no ? 
  and no , do n't come up with some argument in which yeltsin agreed to respect that desicion as final , yeltsin was n't in a clear state of a mind . 
   your country has a history of dickish moves that the us stopped since when is defending of territory a dickish move ? 
  since when a powerful country obey to * international law * ? 
  if it does , us troops would n't have a thing to do in iraq between 2003 and 2011 . 
  grow up . 
   land theft like in crimea are you speaking about kruschov and 1954 ? 
  i was learning , but i have n't learned them . 
  sigh . 
  i know only english because everything online is about it , plus my parents were pressing me from early age to study it - i started going on private classes when i was 4 . 
  otherwise , i was learning german in elementary and high school , but do n't know nothing more than a basic conversation . 
  i lived in greece for few months but only know a couple of phrases and some sentences in greek . 
  i know languages of surrounding countries because they are slavic and thus similar to serbian . 
  when i go abroad i speak in english edit : i saw people mentioning in previous thread latin : but do you seriously consider learning declinations , conjugations and latin sayings as learning tongue ? 
  football 2 . 
  basketball now third one is hard to place . 
  a lot of kids and teenagers train and practice water polo , beside it 's it is something we are top in it , but you can hardly play it outside - you can have some fun with friends on pools . 
  volleyball is mostly played by girls , and hardly properly . 
  i 've never seen people play handball anywhere . 
  tennis used to be a big thing for kids playing outside , with almost every space of asphalt outside of my home occupied by kids with rackets , now it has died down a lot . 
  so i 'm not sure quite . 
  montenegro . 
  1000 euros from shares per person - by minister of finance of party in power at the time . 
  it helped that party to win elections next year . 
  nobody has seen any of those 1000 euros til this day . 
   as an excuse to get all yugoslavia 's nations together ? 
  in terms of nationalism , more or less . 
  interwar kingdom was highly disfunctional because of ethnic divisions , so socialsm solved that problem - at least looking from surface . 
  thing is that many intelectuals and even some of leading politicians were expelled from party ( back then everybody had to be a member of communist party ) , their views were brutally attacked and many were pushed aside simply , because of their views about giving nations more autonomy . 
  after one particulary large incident where serbian and croatian republic branches of party rebeled against current state of affairs , a [ new consitution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_yugoslav_constitution ) was made . 
  you seem to forget that in case of yu it was n't about socialism , but that nations did n't had their states . 
  socialism was n't supportive of nationalistic ideas , but in this case it was even more evident , as to keep different nationalities at bay . 
  that 's why eruption of nationalism occured and it is still vivid . 
  southern and eastern serbia , outside of major towns , in remote villages and even some smaller municipalities . 
  region in very center of srb ( \u0160umadija ) is quickly depopulating in countryside . 
  essentially any area that has n't a major town as a junction or strong industry around is at risk of poverty . 
  it 's usually them ( family of deceased ) who make food for a meal after funeral and subsequent comemorations . 
  it is custom in some parts to have meal on graveyard ( weird ) , where i live it 's usually in houses or resturants . 
  [ what i think about that ] ( http://www.atvbl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/kikinda.jpg ), 
  you apply once you graduated . 
  graduation exams in high schools are in the first part of june .
