  do n't expect to see it nor hear about it , it 's bank intern thing . 
  all that processing of documentation of so many people is such a painstaicking and life-sucking work . 
  plus speaking and explaining to so many people about loans , a lot of whom do n't even have basic knowledge about finance . 
  over and over again . 
  i 've been on internship in retail sector and i concluded i would never work that job in my life . 
  in my country , it 's a calculation of a client 's previous loans , average salary , it 's credit limits on credit cards and interest rates for each banking product . 
  it is used to asses a client creditworthiness and ability to further burden a client with principal and new interest rate . 
  people who have refinancing credits or not so stabile mortgage/colateral will tend to have lower score . 
  i also have to mention that a commercial bank is doing it by strict rules of measurement issued by central bank , which in turn is complying to bazel ii or bazel iii . 
  when we are speaking about greeks . . 
  they have saying : '' nation without sibilings '' . 
  we should take it and start using it , though a bit remodeling into '' friends '' . 
  identical here . 
  i have seen on reddit somewhere that there were [ protests ] ( https://youtu.be/tlj4uov0jjc ) in gr in early 2000s due to some government measure to exclude religion from id ( i think ? 
  ) , how much public opinion has changed since then , in your opinion ? 
  that 's hard one . 
  i would n't be what i am today growing somewhere else - meaning , enviroment in which i grew up , time and issues and common opinions in the society ( serbia in the 2000s and early 2010s ) had a substantial impact on my personality . 
  hat which that guy wears is so similar to [ this one ] ( http://www.vijesti.me/media/slika/23/220901.jpg ) . 
  it is worn in montenegro , herzegovina and dalmatia . 
  you can see older people here and there with [ \u0161ajka\u010da ] ( http://www.malasrpskaprodavnica.com/user/include/etno/images/items/sajkaca_letnja.jpg ) on their heads . 
  [ my archive . 
  bosnian muslims would n't come here . 
  it 's arabs mostly , lybians i think . 
  since my town has oil refinery which had many oil fields in lybia and arabs were working for them there , so from 2011 onwards they get letters that they are granted to emigrate to serbia from bosses . 
  new , muslim , immigrant younger women and girls . 
  becoming more and more a thing in my town , women with hijabs ( more like scarfs though ) with children around them . 
  do n't know would that work anymore , patrols have camera filming their every move . 
  for what ? 
  drinking until last penny , been there . 
  drinking until i ca n't stand , been there . 
  though the easiest way to get drunk here is where you do n't have to pay the booze ( birthdays , weddings , baptisms ) . 
  but i rarely really drink until i pass out , it 's not a custom here . 
  furthermore it 's considered a bit low . 
  definitely not here . 
  [ belvile ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belville,_belgrade ) was constructed as a accomodation during 2009 universiade , now it 's [ luxurious residential area ] ( https://noviapartmani.com/public/upload/blog/2016/06/vodic-kroz-beograd-apartmani-u-belvilu-_blog_default.jpg ) . 
  it used to be gypsy slum before . 
  it used to be holiday in yugoslavia , when communist party passed a desicion to rebel against nazi occupation in 1941 . 
  it was a nationwide holiday , with republics having their own * uprising holidays * themselves too . 
  today is mostly observed by veterans with flowers on memorials of killed . 
  oh , you are the cyclist guy . 
  depends , do n't believe everything you see on websites . 
  more than once i witnessed eu nationals requested passports at both exiting eu country and entering serbia . 
  learned german for 8 years in elementary and high school and could n't go deeper than basic chat . 
  blame it more on me than educational system . 
  i really ca n't make myself learn a language if i 'm not in contact with it . 
   they never represent the true feelings of the population depends . 
  as soon as eu stop making problem about it . 
  hijacking 15 % of territory of a sovereign nation and make it admit would hardly go without problems , nor is any country in the world ready to go smootly over it . 
  i believe brussels will be cooperative as albanians need to join eu too . 
  leave it as it is and make it a frozen conflict , it will fell off scene as time pass . 
  do not sign anything with them . 
  ignore them as much as possible . 
  you never know what might happen in the future . 
  doubt that . 
  sns will make it pass , at least with a narrow margin , so as to show that majority wants accession . 
  but i think we would n't have a referendum any time soon , average sns voter will have hard time voting for accession while other people would n't vote simply because of vu\u010di\u0107 .

  i was about to post this two examples . 
   the orthodox church  this is all just so ridiculous especially this , given your flair . 
  [ ko to tamo peva . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwozslas8dm ), 
  you forgot to tell that serbia was brutally bombed so its forces could be forced to retreat . 
  none , not really . 
  our towns are quite atypical . 
  reason why ex - yu has so high owner without rent or mortgage rate is that state built many flats for labour to move into towns and than in early 90s people repurchased their flats , which were state - owned up to them , for super cheap prices . 
  i did n't knew so many people live in houses here . 
  though there are a lot of abandoned houses in countryside , maybe they counted that too . 
  not so easy . 
  speaking about house - it would most probably be rural / agricultural household with all members being involved more or less , though it depends does family have land and cattle . 
  in towns it is more expensive to live in house , as they tend to be larger than most flats - thus bigger bills etc. 
  for families in flats - often only one member is working ( husband ) while other spouse is sitting home taking care after kids . 
  of course bills stay same , but because of one salary it is difficult to sustain until next paycheck . 
  when both parents are working it often comes to grandparents to look after children , coming from nearby village to look after them or simply living with in that same house so that they can look after children , make a lunch ( because it is a bit difficult after 8 hour shift to think about all that ) and their pension is a good income as they would get it no matter what plus grandpa/grandma does n't have to work for it . 
  average pensions go around 200-250 euros , while average salaries tend to be around 200-500 euros . 
  tl : dr it is hard and very challenging . 
  late 1800s and early 1900s, 
  wow , i undestanded everything . 
  except it 's \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430 instead of \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 in serbian . 
  i went to elementary school in early and mid 2000s, 
  totally agree, 
  no * 90 days * rule ... 
  tbh food in general . 
  i never ate that well than in serbia ( i do n't speak about my home but about resturants and being guest ) . 
  in 3rd grade of elementary school . 
  we had to learn it by heart . 
  estonian ranting about russians checked . 
  flair of op checked . 
  russians muh dont wan na integrate checked . 
  i do n't see why would anybody of that age have any special reason or connection to those period , here are simply '' ah times were better then people lived nicer there was much more freedom '' types of ignorants, 
  special hell for yugonostalics younger than 26 . 
  i simply do not understand those people . 
  99 percent of those who liked him will pass away in matter of few years , middle aged people have witnessed his state crumbling because he was incapable to reform economis and was too narcistic to delegate power to lower levels , notorious example is eradicating communist branches after '74 protests, 
  you clearly do not come from ex yu . 
  honestly , those from roki vulovi\u0107 were quite unknown in serbia until cocayne promoted them , the first one i linked was one of the hits,
