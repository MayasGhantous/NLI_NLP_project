  i tip waiters - usualy when i 'm in company or with gf . 
  and that 's about with tipping . 
  rts . 
  licence fee is about 1.2 euros , i think . 
  and i do n't support it at all . 
  [ not quite famous person ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slobodan_jovanovi%c4%87 ) but still influencial writer . 
  smallest : [ 1 dinar ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/sr/e/ea/1dinar.jpg ) - 0.8 eurocents ( approx ) largest : [ 5000 dinar ] ( http://www.novosti.rs/upload/images/2011//12/2412/novcanica.jpg ) - 40 euros ( approx ), 
  i expected such response . 
  you know quite well what am i talking about . 
  that was a genocide ( oluja , if you are that dumb ) , not your where you pull bodies from all over bosnia every year to increase number . 
  you fire 2 rockets and get 35 years , or you can genocide quater of a milion people and get released . 
  yep , so relevant . 
  yep , hague is quite relevant court . 
  and of course nothing similiar ever happened , because you have magic powers , you can clap and serbs dissapear , am i right ? 
  that 's point . 
  they could stay , but nobody is idiotic enough to stay in an area where are n't any friendly forces to protect you . 
  you did n't packed them to leave , they left because they were afraid of you , not without reason . 
  they certainly did n't packed up and fled because they liked to begin their lifes all over again , especially if they had jobs , properties and friends in sarajevo , did they ? 
   why now ? 
  and why not ? 
  why should n't finally someone draw lines that might solve , in the long run , some of the divisions this region faces ? 
  why bothering in quarrels that can be solved , if only elites on both sides agree to a compromise given the situaton at the field . 
  living in past would n't make time better , it would n't timeclock things to way they were , things change and for most part you could n't return to what it was . 
  in the end , it 's not up to you to decide would they join us or not . 
  what happened to serbs in sarajevo ? 
  what happened to serbs anywhere in modern day federation ? 
  muslims can return to rep srpska , but serbs ca n't go back to their previous homes . 
  referendum could n't possibly have been conducted fairly as bosnia is n't a nation nor a country of a one nation , it 's too bad you guys had n't understood it nor you still understand that . 
  pretty often , paratroopers and engineers reside in my town . 
  it 's mostly jeeps and lorries , but sometimes even light armour . 
  you can see troops walking around , it used to be much more back in the days whan conscription was mandatory . 
  we used to salute conscripts when we were kids , they would laugh and salute back , hilarious . 
  [ pljeskavica ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2014/10/14/1413290143400/pljeskavica---street-food-010.jpg?w=700&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=71b9d02451df9075803506eb9126f5c3 ) and [ \u0107evapi ] ( http://web-tribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/cevapi.jpg ) . 
  i feel hungry now . 
  is it just me or women here are as attractive as women from anywhere else ? 
  well , the question asks about * whole * history , not only modern one . 
  medieval rulers were n't less patriotic than modern ones , for sure patriotism was perceived differently than today , yet serbia was for sure lead by people who were taking care for it , for most part . 
  afaiu , u said that medieval state has nothing to do with modern one , am i wrong ? 
  nonsence . 
  medieval serbia is the same thing as modern one , disclamating it means disclaiming everything that happened prior to turkish invasion . 
  here , if you attend state owned faculty and if you do your ee well , state will pay for your education , usually in the current school year . 
  however , if your grades are bad and you do not pass enough exam , you will most likely ( depends of how much people actually have good grades and good passing of exams ) lose that position and must pay for your next year at faculty . 
  it 's usually between 900-1300 euro . 
  exception is military academy , where absolutely everything is paid by the state , plus students ( cadets ) receive a salary . 
  you can receive a loan from the state ( i do n't know the procedure , never had it ) but interest is almost non existent , plus , again , if you have good grades and if you do your ee well ( and if you are n't from place where you study ) you can apply for dormitory . 
  there are also scholarships which country is paying for the best students and also for good students which attend master/phd programs abroad . 
  but we do n't have intention to merge kekekekekekekekekekeke, 
  you do n't hear often people in serbia chatting about jupiter 's moons . 
  also , here is more more common form * evropa * . 
  none , thanks . 
  i always though mackenzie 's is after that [ un general ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lewis_mackenzie ) who stood for serbian cause in the bosnia , do n't know why . 
  some other streets are : brothers grimm st. poincare st. nehru st. ( russian classics writers ) charlie chaplin etc. 
  though it is n't common in smaller towns for streets to bear names with foreign connotation , in my town not a single street has it ( okay there is bosnian and macedonian , but not * that foreign * ), 
  guess vojvodina , as it was quite little under turks than rest of the serbia , or , more precisely , long enough under the habsburgs to feel development and general cultural trends in europe at the time . 
  you might be asking why i am returning much back in to the past , yet , tbh , mentality takes a lot of time to change . 
  only people who hang on reddit and similar sites ( which are almost exclusively foreign ) know about it , most people , even youngers , do n't have a clue . 
  * pi\u010dka materina * vs belgrade, 
  never heard any . 
  depends actually . 
  i once said thanks to a taxi driver who drove me from belgrade to my town in the middle of the night for much lower fare than usual , it was really polite of him . 
  and i said quite a few * thank you * to van driver who drove me to my doorstep when i was returning to srb . 
  i usually say something that would be translated into english like * have a good day * to coach driver and conducter ( when i 'm exiting on front door ) , same to a cab driver . 
  but never in public buses in towns , here you do n't have any communication with them . 
  i think i only spoke once with a public bus driver . 
  what 's the point of them invading belarus , baltic states ? 
  what 's the point of exposing to an occupation expenditures while rapidly gaining wrath in western media ? 
  we already saw that with ukraine . 
  about nato invasions , i could talk for days . 
  and you never invaded russia ? 
  fear of russian invasion was created by somebody else , not by russians . 
  russia could never even possibly fight with whole nato , because combined , nato countries have much larger economies and resources than russia . 
  that 's why they turned to nuclear strategy . 
  plus , invasions were always going towards , not from russia . 
  have you inspected it so that you can know ? 
  i mean , they are conducting air operations in syria for 1 and a half year to the minimum losses of planes and personnel , outdated force could n't possibly do that . 
  russian army outdated ? 
  lol, 
  most notably dynasty in the middle ages were [ nemanjici ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nemanji%c4%87_dynasty ) , in the modern era , from 19 . century [ obrenovici ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/obrenovi%c4%87_dynasty ) and [ karadjordjevici ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kara%c4%91or%c4%91evi%c4%87_dynasty ) . 
  descendants of kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty are still alive today , though they have symbolic titles and are allowed to live in former court in belgrade . 
   germany , scandinavia we have gymnasium here too , i went to gymnasium, 
  nothing different than having a shore . 
  except that you have to travel abroad for summer vacation , which is n't a problem here . 
  they would have bale as a winger and ramsey as midfielder so i do n't know why they should n't . 
  we have * okrug * ( county ) which is administrative/statistical unit compromising of several municipalities ( usualy larger town and surrounding smaller ones with villages ) , without any importance . 
  we have one [ two ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autonomous_province_of_kosovo_and_metohija ) autonomous districts also composed of multiple okrugs , but , in the end , municipality ( op\u0161tina ) is basic level of local rule in serbia . 
  autonomous districts have some level of autonomy regarding to funding , education and usage of language , yet main obligations and powers are in the hands of the republic . 
  water polo , i think current team is the best ever , holding titles in all competitions ( olympics , world championship , european championship , world league etc ) . 
  i like to beep . 
  people here find it as a meaning of communication . 
  when somebody cuts you off , for example , you beep long at him and he beeps you back , something like an argument in real life . 
  regarding beeping , i do it mostly when i am approaching in second or third gear to a green light that has just opened , yet guy is still just putting into first and slowly starting to move . 
  so annoying . 
  [ authentic one ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zy1s8q3buec/tiq4_ou1sti/aaaaaaaab40/w6qp6a73kom/s640/dsc02670.jpg ), 
  at least you tried , belgium . 
  wake up ( around 8 am ) , make a coffee and a breakfast , go to gym around 10-10 .30 am , stay there for an hour , hour an half , make a lunch around 2 pm or wait for mother to come back home ( around 3 ) so we can have together and in the afternoon go to faculty lectures . 
  in the night usually being on laptop ( reddit or social networks or watching a movie ) , or going out with friends . 
  not every day is like this but this is usually timetable . 
  most could be either far right or leaning left , according to the current needs and mood among population . 
  there is one [ guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bo%c5%a1ko_obradovi%c4%87 ) who is seemingly right - oriented , yet he lack any political wisdom and ability to think on long term . 
  gyros :d,
