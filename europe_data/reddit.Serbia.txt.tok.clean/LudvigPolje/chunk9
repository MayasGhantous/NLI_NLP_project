  punching a pot with scoop is famous motive from protests in 1996-1997 ( in case u wondered why would anybody carry a pot and a scoop on protests ) . 
  first one has motive in that eldery mostly use state tv to get informed , so that 's why '' u ca n't see me '' . 
  '' pensioners are with you '' is about that a lot of eldery voted for vu\u010di\u0107 . 
  naah, 
  russia needs friendly turkey so that black sea fleet can exit through bosphorous , am i right ? 
  expelling turkey would only turn turkey completely towards russia , i believe . 
  also , with growing authoritarism , erdogan would be keen on making troubles abroad , presumebly in bosnia and russia looks like to gave up on balkans . 
  balkan countries should be aware of erdogan actions . 
  well , he had quite a persuasive tool in his hands . 
  brace ourselves , ottomans are coming yet again !, 
  execute order 66, 
  plus tax , so a couple thousand more . . 
  okay i will consider it . 
  days of fascination with bregovi\u0107 are long gone . 
  wait , i buy a property , pay a tax and instantly get passport ? 
  no permits ? 
  it is n't fair that two people which can only watch erdogan rants on tv have more power than a turk who knows about reddit . 
  would n't that get you a residence permit which you have to renew every 6 or 7 years until being able to obtain citizenship ? 
  if you think under new things such as buba coreli , jala brat , jack and johnny and similar , nah those things are just awful . 
  i ca n't sing that :d, 
  dunno , never listened to dubioza . 
  syndicate produced music which influenced a lot of childhoods and formed a lot of ways of thinking . 
  syndicate is awesome . 
  i grew up alongside those lyrics . 
  we have to agree that speaking about quality in terms of turbo-folk is quite debatable . 
  ceca is long on the scene but that talks only about public which listens to it . 
  personally , those things such as kiti\u0107 , ceca , keba and similar i can listen only when i am drunk . 
  ceca has gone into being commercial in the last few years but i have somewhat developed sence to music already . 
  kakav argument , zadivljen sam . 
  bulgarians have a thing after a lot of awful , low quality turbo folk musicians from serbia , dunno why . 
  [ relation with ceca ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwd6vnaagyi ) is truly deep and unexplainable . 
  i was once going back from thessaloniki and in somewhere close to sophia [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmlxgckws4y ) was going on a radio . 
  bulgarians have a thing after mile kiti\u0107 , anyway it 's about how fat girls can be hot too . 
  guys , stay safe there . 
  i feel solidarity with everybody who lives under oppresive one-man egomaniac rule . 
  except if you are from vara\u017edin, 
  you live in balkans ? 
  * scratch *, 
  i honestly expected a bulgarian to post [ something else ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuz9obiufrs ) from balkan music . 
  do you mean vo\u0107na salata ? 
  why cyprus is n't considered part of europe ? 
  it is inhabited by people who are by culture and religion identical to rest of europe , at least the eu part . 
  i mean , if azerbejan and kazahstan can be considered europe why cyprus ca n't ? 
   i was born in ussr, 
  ca n't really tell from your irish flair, 
  do u even know what does it mean ? 
  ca n't tell , as a paintings admirer i really have a lot of famous paintings on my mind . 
  look at us - pro-eu protesters are against pro-eu dictator . 
  lol , maybe only first one . 
  second is quite european styled , third resembles each and every royal coronation in the europe at the time . 
  fourth has nothing to do with serbia or balkans . 
  fencing lesson is from montenegro , they are n't albanians , man in the middle wears a black hat with a red top , which is a classic montenegrin hat at the time . 
  such a shame that gnjilane group got so low sentences . 
  in my opinion , they should have been hanged or executed . 
   serbia : the wounded montenegrin ; honestly , this is n't quite known artwork . 
  you really need to be into art to know about it . 
  there is much more famous things , even from paja jovanovi\u0107 , such as [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/sr/e/e5/paja_jovanovic%3bcas_macevanje.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://www.politika.rs/old/uploads/rubrike/305182/i/1/seoba-srba-pancevo.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://riznicasrpska.net/fotografije/umetnicke_slike/pavel_paja_jovanovic_-_krunisanje_cara_dusana,_1900._ulje_na_platnu,_390_x_590_cm.jpg ) . 
  [ this ] ( http://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/vbhktkpturbxy80nge3nwyyn2u5yjzmzjeynzizodg1odu1mduxmdiyyy5qcgetlqlnaxqawsovas0b1gdcw5uh2tivchvsc2ntcy9nrefflzfknzrjyjqxnza1otuwndm2nji5y2fizdywnmy1mgy2lnbuzwfcaa ) is most expensive painting , also from paja jovanovic . 
  also a fun read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nanking_massacre, 
   majority of serbs live  no incidents with ethnic background c'mon , use your head , admit it is the same because of same reason other way around . 
  in the end , it 's up to character . 
  you drop bombs in sea or finish in prison like that greek pilot , or you wait for passanger train to pass across targeted bridge . 
  i do n't consider tito our leader . 
  he would never have been in any sort of charge in serbia , he just happened to be a leader of something which included serbia at the point ( return to king alexander disastorous desicion to create that in the first place ) . 
  milo\u0161evi\u0107 was selfserving but totally out of context for foreign affairs , i mean , belorussia and iraq , lol . 
  romania , greece , cyprus , slovakia and spain, 
  kosovo albanians would very much like to be a part of eu serbia , in order to get eu passports . 
  we had , with 1 or 2 exceptions , really dumb leaders through history . 
  that 's our fault . 
  no long term , strategic plans and thinking . 
  we should really learn from bulgaria . 
  they knew precisely when to shift sides . 
  from what used to be biggest russian satelit in the balkans , they changed sides in 1914 to germans , 1919 to allies , 1941 to hitler , 1944 to russians and 1989 to west , avoiding massive casualties like we had in the both world wars and now they are in eu and we are considered trojan horse . 
  in an alternate universe where nato did n't intervene , that unborn baby would be turning 18 soon . 
  of course not , puppet western governments rule in every single ex yu country, 
  make serbia great again !, 
  no more '' republika srpska '' flair ? 
  pistol and hunting rifle , on several occations . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.novosti.rs/upload/images/2015//05/15n/draza%20 ( 2 ) . jpg ) , but it 's debatable at best . 
  i amazed that you pay so much for bus and cellphone yet so little for food , i believe that 250 pounds cover all of your food expences ? 
  will this obsession with trump eventually end ? 
  towns up to 50k inhabitants mostly do not have public transport . 
  towns up to 100k usually have some sort of , having 1-2 departures per hour during working days . 
  larger towns and belgrade have well developed public and commuter transports , with belgrade 's operating trams and trolleys beside buses . 
  in university towns students can receive large discounts , while most of costs of operating usually goes onto back of employeed people , as they pay highest monthly tickets . 
  on intertown level , coaches are mostly operated by private companies and thus prices are often subject to change . 
  occationaly , for children commuting to school from villages to towns local authorities may subside company . 
  also , lines which are non profitable and in rural areas without major center nearby are operated by state - owned transportation company . 
  still , there are villages where buses still go once a week or do n't go at all . 
  railways are notorious for their delays , yet commuting between belgrade and towns situated in north of the country is relatively okay . 
  trains are much cheaper than coaches on many routes . 
  fun fact is that traveling shorter and to closer destinations is actually easier and less stressful with train , unlike in europe where trains are used for longer routes . 
  lmao, 
  these questions are n't silly , westerners simply can not comperhend that goods and cost of living are so cheap on balkans . 
  american asked me do we use table cloth to clean area around mouth after meal and do we use cutlery when we eat . 
  ( it was during dinner ) i stood up and left . 
  if we stick to folk tale history . 
  thing is that historically , serbia was very much independent from ottoman rule after 1402 and much before 1878 , it 's okay to say that with agreements in 1830 serbia got ridded of turks , 1878 was only formal declaration . 
  serbians were clearly majority , if you do n't believe try to find some turkish censuses online about it - i know that i have seen in multiple serbian books that area was predominantly serbian . 
  hungarians moved en mass out during turkish invasions , serbs did not in so large numbers as they had nowhere to flee .
