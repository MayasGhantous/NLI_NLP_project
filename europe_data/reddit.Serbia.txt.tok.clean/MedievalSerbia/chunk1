** serbia ** the glorious prime minister is working hard to deny the insulting attacks of the weaker man against his politics , in a local tabloid , which go both towards russia and eu while rampant corruption and obvious denial of any respect towards institutions of democracy are galloping through the stormy winds of hard reformations . 
  the man that openly supported bombardment of serbia during '99 is now officially a consultant to a man that openly supported europhobia and was banned from entering european union at one point .

  you trigger by saying how dubrovnik was an awesome target practice . 
  you stole promaja from us !, 
  this is part of the christian holiday called [ epiphany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epiphany_\\ ( holiday \\ ) ) , in orthodox and eastern churches it commemorates the baptism of jesus , so every year priests and people flock to nearby river and swim for the cross to obtain it as memory to that . 
  in russia is particularly famous as many of the `` russians crazy swim ice water in winter '' comes also from this holiday . 
  ships are concentrated around the naval groups of serbian orthodoxy with jobs of protecting the shores of the true fate against the threats from heresy , schismatics and heathens . 
  aside from various mighty battleship , there are also dreadnought class destroyers concentrated in the first orthodox naval group , for example the joint russo/serbian varagnian subgroup slavjana . 
  blessings good friend , no the river is not polluted , it 's just that rare form of heretical disease known as anonymous has swept the faces of serbian youth , so the great cleansing ritual is taking place with the blessing of the bishop amfilohije a top his imperial battle ship with the same name . 
  ha ha , your navy is n't blessed at all , here check our amphibian squadron practice with the heavy support of [ holy imperial flagship amfilohion ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g5nizs8.jpg ) . 
  not really economically useless , kosovo has a pretty big chunk of coal reserves and some otter mineral stuff , but there is n't just anyone relevant to pick up the industry since people ... left ... mysteriously . 
  also , isnt it a strecth to call it the russian `` empire '' . ~ ~ that is sort of a retroactive assessment of a largely agricultural disconnected land . ~ ~ big ass siberian wilderness with no proletarian factories ai n't right comrade ? 
  engineering students are pretty close . 
  kind a hard since most characteristic parts for a european city got destroyed by the other states of europe in a huge european conflict that was a theater of a world war . 
  huh , for once having a good record in sportsmanship pays for something .

  many millions died because of the same errors in administrative decisions or inactivity to take any action , either by communist or the british , which led to famine . 
  party purges usually resulted in far fewer casualties . 
  poor management on distribution of food because of the lack of administrative initiative to take better control of the situation ? 
  churchill is synonymous with british politics in india , especially famines which took millions of lives . 
  when they look like funny uncles then you have to start being scared , for example milo djukanovic looks like that funny uncle that finished law school and does some shady business with selling cars . 
  they are still hanging around constantinople for the last five hundred years . 
  come to serbia . 
  propaganda at those times involved stuff like preaching about greater rights and more autonomy to southern slavic populations in austrian hungary , the empire was so rotten and politically distanced from national questions that any talk about recognizing political rights to slavic groups was deemed as propaganda against the habsburg . 
  main guy in montenegro , milo , was at one point a russian lover since he wanted to attract russian money and tourists to build montenegro as a tourist attraction for them . 
  then he realized that western tourists can offer more money then russians , also montenegro is n't in near proximity of russia , so he was able to double play on putin without too many consequences . 
  also montenegro managed to avoid bombing of nato ( they got hit still a couple of times in early days ) , by distancing from milosevic , so the whole controversy of joining a military alliance that destroyed your country is n't as bad as in serbia , but still there is a strong opposition in populace . 
  but serbia has nothing to do with the killing of the arch duke , i mean imagine if you are constantly bullied by some powerful empire just because you are standing on the doorstep of its expansion , people are gon na take actions into their own hands regardless what you preach . 
  use of the braveheart scream by the jolly english ... oh the irony . 
  short synopsis in english :  f-117a nighthawk on 27 . march 1999 . took off from the airbase aviano towards then federal republic of yugoslavia , flown by coronel dejl zelko , whom turned on the autopilot as a standard mission without expecting that the plane would not be coming back , just going on a regular mission of firing two laser guided missiles in a area around belgrade . 
   f-117a was first time used in panama in 1989 , when the airport rio hato was bombed , but it 's biggest succes came during the gulf war when the pilots made over 1.300 flights and thrown over 2.000 bombs . 
   legendary stealth plane was taken down by outdated soviet surface-to-air missile system s-125 neva , made in the 60 's , and the plane fell in the village of budjanovci . 
   zoltan dani , coronel in pension and commander of iii rocket battalion said `` we made a calculation that no more 20 seconds was allowed to cast light in airspace , with small technical innovation which allowed us in making easier to discover stealth technology , we were able on radar to locate our targets . '', 
   pilot catapulted and avoided capturing , while from pentagon tommorow was stated that the aircraft was indeed lost , without mentioning a reason . 
  when your biography is worse then turkish space program . 
  well yeah , hundreds of innocent people died because some american got a hard on for bombing balkans . 
  well yeah :  kosovo pogroms by albanians over serbs in 2004 . 
   macedonia almost fell into a civil war in 2001 . 
  serbian democratic establishment also suffered a brutal blow to the cause of joining e.u. 
  as now any third grade politician can point out to the west and say : ** they bombed us !, 
  why should we join them ? 
  they killed our people for laughs and destroyed our industry . 
  we should allow russia to build military bases in serbia now . 
  short synopsis in english :  nato bombardment begun on 24th of march lasting 11 weeks in which between 1.200 and 2.500 people were killed . 
   infrastructure was heavily damaged with schools , hospitals , industrial complexes , media houses , etc. 
  being bombarded . 
   attacks begun shortly before 20 hours by order of then general secretary of nato havier solana . 
   bombardment was the result of failed negotiations at rambouillet about the ending of the crisis on kosovo . 
   infrastructure damage was estimated by some as nearly as 100 billion dollars , while some experts from g17 + estimated at 29,6 billion . 
   aggression had ended on 10th of june with the withdrawal of yugoslav army from kosovo and acceptance of resolution 1244 of un safety council . 
  short synopsis in english :  in place of a mural , which was painted in center of novi sad in 2009 by french street artist remed , and which was suddenly painted over thursday afternoon , this morning a new massage was written to those who decided to remove remed 's work  no one knows who or why decided to paint over the mural , only that three construction workers without any logos , showed up one afternoon and painted over mural in one hour . 
  local authorities have n't provided any answers . 
   mural was painted alongside two artists from novi sad , dusan bljelac and mrdak luburica . 
  it represents one large human figure moving other smaller one like a puppet . 
  short synopsis in english :  4.000 serbs and other ethnic minorities had been expelled , 900 serbs , albanians , peacekeeping soldiers and ethnic minorities were injured , 800 serbian houses had been destroyed and 35 religious buildings had been burned . 
  the perpetrators have never been caught and the three day violence took 19 lives , of which 11 albanians and 8 serbs . 
   the excuse was the drowning of two albanian boys on 16 . march from serbian village zupce , which was then called by halit berany , chief of local board for protection of human rights on kosovo , as attack by `` serbian bandits '' which riled the albanians into frenzy which not even 19,000 members of kfor were n't able to contain . 
   the violence lasted for three days , with estimation of 60,000 albanians participating on 33 various locations , 100 members of kfor and un were injured and 72 vehicles of international peacekeeping troops were burned . 
  thankfully , proximity of balkans towards italy has allowed our soccer players to adopt more stylish western look , like in this picture : http://www.tarzanija.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/savo.jpg, 
  probably got replaced by different breeds whom were imported , it 's not official it 's extinct but last time they checked the number of animals it was less then 100 in 1993 . 
  and this is before domestic meat industry was collapsed and replaced with importing meat from other countries . 
  `` sir , serbs declared independence from kosovo . '', 
  `` i ai n't give a fuck . '', 
  that guy garry jonson seemed swell guy . 
  ussr before stalin had some really revolutionary attempts to change society , they almost banned inheritance laws at some point in attempt to create true social equality , but great number of eastern european states after wwii were first to adopt abortion laws namely because of necessity being at a frontline of a war that caused mass civilian terror . 
   in hungary , the termination of pregnancy had been prohibited by paragraphs 285 and 286 of statute no . 
  v of 1878 ; however , by a 1933 high court decision , justifiable medical interference in pregnancies ceased to be a criminal offence .4 gynaecologists in private clinics and offices performed these surgeries for which there was a demand among the more affluent . 
  at the same time , in rural areas people carried on with the centuries-old abortion techniques . 
  the change in law regulating termination was the result of the high number of rape cases committed by soldiers of the soviet army in 1945.5 at the time the government made abortions permissible at health care facilities free of charge , if authorized by a medical officer . 
  during this revamping of the abortion laws , in order to prevent unavoidable emotional outbursts in the domestic political arena , hungary 's rulers deliberately created a judicial uncertainty about the issue . 
  darker story behind these laws , is the fact that a lot of these abortion legalization laws were passed because most of the socialist countries in the 40 's suffered horrifying mass rapes during wwii and women did things to get rid of children made from such events , so governments had to pass these laws for safety of people i.e. 
  women going to the doctor instead of causing stillbirth or worse . 
  sai er wei ya - nailed serbia well . 
  next time i should aim for public health centers , because private hospitals in barcelona charged us 500 euros just for checking one of friends shoulder , even if we did took necessary traveling insurances , they flat out rejected those without explanation . 
  by 15th century turkish raids in medieval serbia had become so frequent that monasteries had to build additional walls around them in order to protect treasuries within .
