i 'll second that  and keep in mind that europe is not monolithic in opinion . 
  every country has the anti-immigration and pro-immigration opinions . 
  i 'd say in general that most people will be welcoming . 
  especially if , as someone above mentioned , you have a skill which is deficient in the country you choose to settle in . 
  good luck in any case !, 
  there is a ritual which is pretty similar in many balkan countries . 
  it takes place in winter , and is meant to usher in the new season . 
  it involves a masked procession and jumping over a fire . 
  there has been a kind of revival happening of this custom here in serbia . 
  and one of the most impressive ones takes place in macedonia . 
  it 's just insane . 
  supposedly , it 's been going strong for over 1 400 years .

  hey there , you 're wrong about serbia being a pro-russian country . 
  eu integrations are officially one of the most important goals of the current , and previous government . 
  it has been so since 2000 . 
  you 're right about it just being geopolitics though . 
  it 's totally ok to talk about at least some of these things you mention . 
  but to not be totally blunt about it , better to ask your hosts ' / new found friends ' / drinking buddies ' opinions about it , while withholding your own . 
  the balkans are super-friendly , even to americans !, 
  jokes aside , no one will have anything against you personally for being from the states . 
  it 's the government politics people generally disagree with . 
  travelling between some countries can be tricky , but if you find out about travel options ahead , you should have no problem . 
  trains are great imo . 
  cheap , but super slow . 
  there is also ride sharing , hitchhiking , buses , and cheap flights . 
  depending on what you like , some places to visit could be - thessaloniki in greece , as mentioned above , ( one of my all time favourite places anywhere , ever ) , ohrid lake in macedonia , boka kotorska in montenegro , ljubljana in slovenia , sarajevo in bih . 
  if you tell me what you 're into , i 'll give you more detailed tips . 
  enjoy the balkans !, 
  ah shit , now i see . 
  it 's kind of the same situation here , i was pretty surprised by the recent protests happening . 
  shitty balkan politics should have their own subreddit . 
  basically :p i just do n't get the part about croatia . 
  hold my beer . 
  we have a current , outgoing president with a fake college degree ( plus he does n't speak any english ) , and our prime minister is also our incoming president . 
  the minister of health is a [ former paid assassin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy3zyvi3hfq#variant=ew0kicaiawqiidogik1qnf9imjy0xzewodbqxzmwrlbtx0fbq18xmjhlqklux0rbu0gila0kicaizgf0ysigoiaie1xyxg4gifwiyujpdhjhdgvciia6ic0xlfxyxg4gifwiagvpz2h0xcigoiaxmdgwlfxyxg4gifwid2lkdghciia6ide5mjasxhjcbiagxcjmchnciia6idi1lfxyxg4gifwichjvamvjdglvblwiidogxcjot1jnquxcilxyxg59ig0kfq%3d%3d ) for one of the criminal clans . 
  the minister of interior affairs also has a fake college degree , as does the current mayor of the capital belgrade . 
  where did you get that info ? 
  serbian , croatian , bosnian and montenegrin may be the same language , but they are different dialects , not accents . 
  and even the dialect part is disputed , as there has just been a kind of new development , with the same language declaration published just recently . 
  ca n't dig it up now . 
  and macedonian and bulgarian are different languages . 
  any sources for that ? 
  macedonian and bulgarian are different languages . 
  do you mean the shared \u0161tokavski dijalekt ? 
  otherwise i find serbian and croatian are [ different dialects ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dialects_of_serbo-croatian ) . 
  haha , it would only have been worse if you said bulgarians trying to speak greek ... 
  serbian and croatian are the same language imo :p dialects of the same language . 
  edit : forgot to say , macedonian sounds awesome , i love it !, 
  hamburger is basically our national dish . 
  it 's called [ pljeskavica ] ( http://mojkontakt.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pljeskavica.jpg ) . 
  yeah , we 're pretty good at making those .

  welcome !, 
  [ macedonian :3 ] ( https://www.theflagshop.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/465x/17f82f742ffe127f42dca9de82fb58b1/m/a/macedonia-flag-std_1.jpg ), 
  you can still go back to serbia !, 
  i do n't know what you 've been told , but it 's wrong , 
  woodstock hostel in paris is quite cool . 
  close to montmartre , very cool atmosphere , a small garden/courtyard , a downstairs bar and free breakfast last i was there . 
  choose a room on one of the top floors to be away from the bar/street/courtyard noise . 
  on the other hand , the worst hostel i ever stayed at is also in paris , the blue planet . 
  i would be surprised if they are still open . 
  avoid at all costs !, 
  no one has to know ;-), 
  provence is lovely from what i 've seen of it , i liked the smaller cities but not the bigger ones , or the most famous ones . 
  nice was awful , so was cannes . 
  on the other hand , i loved arles . 
  carcassonne is awesome , just a bit further on west . 
  ca n't tell you anything about lyon , geneva or southwest germany . 
  the only glimpse of geneva i got was going around the lake on a train . 
  it looked like the most boring place on earth . 
  hi there , i do n't know what you have planned for your trip , what your interests are , and how much time you have ? 
  i think that based on what op said , they would do better to skip marseilles . 
  i worked there for a short while at a hostel , and did n't like the city much at all . 
  the center is very touristy/expensive , the beaches are completely unremarkable , small and dirty . 
  the city is dirty as well , and there was a general tense atmosphere that i could n't really put my finger on . 
  having already visited some wonderful smaller towns in the south of france , marseilles was a let down in comparison . 
  if you are really set on going there , there are some nice parts of the town to see . 
  one is the [ vallon des auffes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vallon_des_auffes ) , the [ fortress ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fort_saint-jean_ ( marseille ) ) and the [ vieux port ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_port_of_marseille ) . 
  just came to say the same thing , marseilles is not worth all that time , if any on this trip . 
  perhaps only for the calanques . 
  why not switch to arles as your base , and the camargue instead ? 
  also , might be out of your way , but do you know about carcassonne ? 
  there used to be a hostel in the cite , and all the daytime tourists would clear out at night , and leave the city empty on summer nights . 
  you can have barefoot walks on the smooth stones in the fortress , and go swimming in the river at the bottom of the hill . 
  really gorgeous place !, 
  nato bombing of serbia in 1999 . 
  and if you hit the downvote , comment and tell me which war you were swept up in against your choice . 
  in the balkans you 'll be a superstar . 
  everyone will assume you play for the nba , which is only natural if you 're black and from the us . 
  jokes aside , you 'll have no worries here . 
  while there are a handful of morons in any country you go to , you 're more likely to raise friendly curiosity here than anything else . 
  edit : and you 'll be just fine here speaking only english . 
  most young people speak it quite well , and much of the middle-aged generation too . 
  i live in belgrade , the capital of serbia , first established over 2000 years ago . 
  there are many celtic , roman and ottoman archeological remains here . 
  in the center of the city , there is a fortress called [ kalemegdan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belgrade_fortress ) . 
  it 's a place where people come to stroll around and drink beer on the city walls in summer evenings . 
  a burial mound .
