  unlike how many people portray it as , it 's not a country filled with monsters and people who wan na take over the world , but rather nice , warm-hearted people who are nice and respectful . 
  serbia is also really beautiful , with many sights to see ; kopaonik , djavola varos , kalemegdan , and so on . 
  there are a lot of activities to do in serbia too , with many concerts and other great events . 
  for those who are seeking a vacation , serbia may be a perfect spot for you !, 
  wow . 
  i was just in slovenia in august 2013 and now i go on r/europe and see that there are some mass protests in slovenia . 
  after i visited slovenia , i also went to venice . 
  one year later ( now ) , large seperatist movements are there . 
  i also visited greece exactly a year earlier ( in august 2012 ) and look at it now . 
  this is scary now . 
  it 's like in every country i go now there are some protests and other bad stuff !, 
  ah wait , yeah , sorta makes more sense, 
  i think amsterdam is the las vegas of europe, 
  holy ... crap . 
  ukraine is europe , but not eu, 
  now we know officially that turkey wo n't be in the eu . 
  i just ca n't believe how selfish , mean and zealous usa is acting . 
  they think they can normally invade anyone and do what they want , and think no one can criticize them ( which actually happened ) , and when russia just wants that little crimea , usa goes all `` omg russia put sanctions wreck rouble . 
  remove russian forces from crimea , destroy putin . 
  russia in fact just wants to help russians in ukraine , but no . 
  i probably did n't explain it well e_e we also paint eggs . 
  egg-hitting contest . 
  the egg which breaks ( a bit of it or not all same ) is eaten by the loser who owned that egg which broke . 
  if both are broken , its a tie . 
  i agree . 
  i could understand istanbul or even skopje , but ... baku . 
  after i read this post , i officially realized how a great , wise ruler the russians have . 
  gyros . 
  sweet greek gyros . 
  this country really needs some * freedom * . 
  sounds cool !, 
  is it a coincidence that her name is the first three letters in my username ? 
  i agree with you  _ , 
  america is bitchy and russia is right . 
  america has no moral right to behave on their behavior because of what they have done . 
   worries about russian human rights in estonia  bans lgbt from russia, 
  i am happy my country is n't in the eu ... yet . 
  athens , geneva , berne , paris , london, 
  before i entirely saw the comments , i was about to say that ; - ;, 
  i support you !, 
  ** serbia : ** * 15th anniversary of the [ nato bombing of yugoslavia in 1999 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_yugoslavia ) * serbian chetnik forces intervene in crimea to help russia * west wants serbia to join sanctions against russia * new cabinet and its members still unknown * [ serbs wo n't let bosnia join sanctions against russia ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=26&amp;nav_id=89781 ) * arrest of lawyers `` human rights violation '' * former minister arrested in corruption case * president : serbia will keep free trade agreement with russia : serbian president tomislav nikoli\u0107 talked in vienna on thursday afternoon with representatives of major austrian companies that are present in serbia . 
  * serbia wants trade ties with both russia and eu - pks president \u017deljko serti\u0107 says serbia has opted for the path to the european union , but will continue economic cooperation with other countries . 
  * world bank official : serbia has 9 months for reforms, 
  they meant a europe united as one single country . 
  switzerland is the lesotho of europe . 
  surrounded by the eu , to all sides . 
  even if serbia was in the eu ( the dream i have for my country actually is to join the eu ) , i would still not support a united states of europe or republic of europe . 
  my dream indeed is to join the eu , but not to join a use or roe . 
  never . 
  i support further corporation between the european nations , but never a one-country europe . 
  ah , alright . 
  united in racism, 
   in my country germans are a laughing stock . 
  any respect i had for germany is gone . 
  they just seem absolutely pathetic to me and i am actually embarrassed for them . 
  yeah you are right , he has an agenda, 
  obvious troll, 
  such european !, 
  he 's probably an american troll, 
  this question would be better suitable in r/explainlikeimfive or r/history . 
  probably cause americans would shout out whatever they want , no matter what it is, 
  not really crimes , but they tried to make us a puppet state in the 40s ; we refused and they threatened with an invasion , which did n't happen . 
  stalin himself tried to assassinate our president tito several times . 
  belgrade , 
  belgium = irrelevant seperated belgium = irrelevant x2 ^ ( just a joke ), 
  oh great , more bullshit . 
  polan big , mighty 1921 best day of life, 
   romania  part of the ussr ... 
  oh gee , i wonder why ... oh wait , most of the eu ( and the world ) recognizes kosovo as independent . 
  what 's a biatch, 
  lol , coming from a guy without a flair at all . 
  not again ... 
  i guess we will never have peace in the balkans, 
   think our own heads you mean think with russian heads ? 
  wow no serbia-hungary border news ok, 
  hey , the poem actually sounds catchy !, 
  ^ ( joke . ), 
  do n't forget who liberated you  ^ ( no , no , it was n't serbia , it was france ), 
  i do n't know , could be slovakia ... ^ ( just a joke ), 
  again , no sea access, 
  tyl belarus and kazakhstan have access to the sea, 
  our continent should not be defined by who follows what religion and who is what ethnicity . 
  you distrust uk but have neutral feelings about albania ? 
  ... well that is new, 
  vive la france !, 
  cough , armenia . 
  it sucks to be in a country with a government which refuses to accept the genocide in first place . 
  in the meantime , while everyone is talking about this , uefa reverses their decision to award the 3-0 win to serbia during the october 2014 [ serbia-albania match ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbia_v_albania_%28uefa_euro_2016_qualifying%29 ) , which was cancelled , and give the 3-0 win to albania instead . 
  haha . 
  not a joke . 
  bringing the balkans closer together !, 
  no , i think he is montenegrin , judging by his flair, 
   eubot you what, 
  get your nationalistic shit out of here . 
  you are only embarrassing us . 
  no , sorry , had to try something new :(, 
  i facepalmed myself with a burrito i was eating . 
  ... do you really think i did n't know there were already settlers in those areas before europeans ? 
  you clearly misunderstood what i said . 
  i meant europeans settled the americas and australia ( after the native americans and native australians of course ... ) , not that the latin americans were the ones who settled europe .
