  i hope you are a troll, 
  you sound like an islamic extremist , except christian . 
  ignore him , he is a bigger failed troll then one i met an hour and half ago, 
   russians , romanians , and moldovans have a nearly identical culture . 
  do you know literally nothing about the countries you are judging ? 
  romanians and moldovans are nearly identical , but russians are not even close . 
  i really congratulate you on how you pulled this troll out . 
  now get out and stay in your home and judge other countries without visiting them nor reading a few facts about them . 
  i am afraid you should do that first before judging other nations about their problems . 
   every single day you have protests like that in europe from the muslim population . 
  we do ? 
  yeah , you are right , the rest of the usa is completely crime free !, 
  safe society forever !, 
  europe is uncivilised and nobody there has rights and people shoot each other on every corner !, 
  both western and eastern media say otherwise . 
  and before you criticise other nations for their problems , please fix yours . 
  crime is way more abundant in your country than in pretty much anywhere in europe . 
   a country which is the perfect example of how a multi-cultural nation should operate lel `` perfect example '' not even close, 
  nobody should think about traveling to the usa at this point of time ( where daily 7 black people are killed ) . 
  better ? 
  independence to catalonia !, 
  of course you do n't , being serious sounds like your only personality, 
  you do realize it was a joke , right ? 
   bosna ( sometimes bosner ) is a spicy austrian fast food dish , said to have originated in either salzburg or linz . 
  it is now popular all over western austria and southern bavaria . 
  does n't sound even close to bosnia ?? 
  are you hiding something ? 
  10/10 would revise, 
  why do n't you invite us why are n't we in we need gas what is happening why are n't we in y u hate us, 
  kalemegdan fortress in belgrade , knez mihajlova street ( also ) in belgrade , djavola varos , fruska gora ... [ this site is pretty useful . 
  [ indeed !, 
  all this is in one of serbia 's most amazing fortresses !,

  [ claymore . 
  party at the fortress everybody, 
  you are right . 
  a few days ago i submitted links , the entire page in the `` new '' section ( with my link ) had under 10 votes , including my own too ( which got 0 but later got to just a bit bigger ) . 
  pls no 1999 again, 
  but they are completely innocent . 
  they probably want peace too , and it is not okay to have them hated and booed at because they are , in this case , russian . 
  maybe we should take a peaceful measure , but banning their people from entering a singing contest not related to politics is not a ` quite nice peaceful measure ' . 
  just because their government is acting like the ruler of the world does n't mean we should ban them from a friendly , family singing-contest show that is n't supposed to be related to anything political . 
  i heavily disagree with russia 's government 's actions but i do n't think they should be banned from a song contest . 
  yeah , the joke is so good i laughed 4 times, 
  you mean the opposite ? 
   and the russians who think that sweet baby jesus putin is the holy saviour of their plight are idiots . 
  this is literally how a majority of serbs here act as well ( take putin as if he was a `` holy creature '' ) , and it makes me sick : /, 
  the spanish government really wants to start a full-scale revolution ... 
  we need your vote !, 
  i like the dutch song . 
  too bad it did n't qualify ... 
  i thought finland was going to be the worst , but then moldova showed up ... 
  go estonians !, 
  ^ ( and my own country too ), 
  that was a spectacular night !!, 
  we are in the finals :d :d and so is my favorite ( estonia ) !, 
  there are so many good songs this year ... estonia 's , albania 's , denmark 's , and so on are all good ... finland 's is honestly the worst this year . 
  edit : and you are right , romania 's really looks like a tv chef ... 
  oh , alright . 
  by the way , nice summary !, 
  why do all links ( at least to me ) lead to the eurovision song `` warrior '' by georgia ? 
  edit : almost all links , only like 2 or 3 actually lead to where they are supposed to, 
  do you think germany today is exactly like germany in 1933-1945 ? 
  germany changed a lot since then and is nothing like it was 70 years ago . 
  he is too high, 
  why wonder ? 
  oh , come on , seriously , this is ridiculous . 
  that is sort of unrelated to the topic of this post . 
  i agree with you , and i do n't think it is in our interest to enter yet another series of deadly wars . 
  trust me , you not want into balkan . 
  even better : 1943 , 
  and why does this comment thread bother you so much ? 
  calm down . 
  people like to joke here . 
  we are n't all `` serious business '' . 
  same here in serbia . 
  how did you know ?!, 
  we want to proud ourselves from owning the end of our glorious river !, 
  edit : [ here , take a map !, 
  ... one does not simply park like that ... 
  ... what . 
  who needs those ? 
  not me !, 
  why would anyone ? 
  hopefully we will join the club as well !, 
  ^ ( who am i kidding we never will ), 
  that is the nicest thing an ex-yugoslav who is n't serbian ever said to us upvote !, 
  for some reason , ever since the latest update of chrome , it crashes 1/3 of the time whenever i open a page . 
  no , it suddenly stops loading , does n't respond then i have to restart my computer since not even the taskbar works , or minimizing ... so i switched to firefox . 
  i also use firefox . 
  no thank you . 
  they are horrible . 
  ok i am not listening to that,
