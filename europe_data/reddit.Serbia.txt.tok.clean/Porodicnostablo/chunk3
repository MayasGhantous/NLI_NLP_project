  however , worth mentioning is [ p\u00e1l teleki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/p%c3%a1l_teleki ) , the prime minister of hungary , who committed suicide on the eve of the invasion of yugoslavia , because he disagreed with it . 
   this kind of chant today would be attributed to turkey , in serbia . 
  \u0411\u0440\u043e , no it would n't . 
  i 've been to several churches in belgrade where during the liturgy they `` sing '' the `` byzantine '' melody , not the `` mokranjac '' which is the usual one . 
  my grandma in the countryside would recognize this as `` orthodox chants '' . 
  the correct translation is : europe defends its 3000-year-old culture against bolshevism . 
  traveling to montenegro tonight for a couple of days . 
  now he is minister of defense and arguing with croatia . 
  vucic ( the president ) knows no shame . 
  vulin ( defense minister ) is proud of his past , he still wears che guevara shirts and stuff like that . 
  stuffs crazy ... 
  btw , had i realized we share the same flair - ne bi te nikad cimo brate . 
  the average number of sunny hours in more than 50 % of serbia is more than 2000 . 
  we should be coloured in light-orange on this map to a far greater extent . 
  for example , for belgrade it 's 2025 hours . 
  probably both have to do with the natural landscape and boundaries . 
  perhaps malpolon monspessulanus ?

  i could n't find a better map , but yeah , i know * \u0161arka * - * ri\u0111ovka * is also present in croatia ... 
  yep , pretty common . 
  in my grandparents village just this spring i saw a big * poskok * ( vipera ammodytes ) nearby our house , and on several occasions we would find a snake in our very yard . 
  had trouble adding the photos for vipera nikolskii , not sure i succeeded in the end . 
  something like [ this ] ( https://storage.googleapis.com/mapio-net-pic/59788429.jpg ) or [ this ] ( https://www.google.rs/search?q=%d0%b3%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%81+%d0%ba%d1%83%d0%bb%d0%b0&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiq9zjy5e_uahvfuhqkhsyncnoq_auicigb&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=791#imgrc=ct0nje3yjtq8vm: ), 
  agreed . 
  oh the stupidity ... 
  my memory spans a few decades , and this is the hottest june in serbia that i remember ( although this is purely anecdotal ) . 
  yes , i believe 35 is slowly becoming the new 30 . 
  [ you know what would make it even more beautiful ? 
  i love that one . 
  also , the one where a man ( in ussr ) comes to a department store to buy a washing machine . 
  he enters the store and asks : `` can i take a look at your washing machines ? '', 
  the seller lady replies : `` this is the first floor , where we do n't have refrigerators . 
  the second floor does n't have washing machines '' .

  that 's why i posted mostly - trivia .

  yes , like that . 
  oh , lil ' nela , our justice minister ... at the tender age of 35 , the only thing that matters is that she 's pretty .

  ok , i see your point , even though i do n't agree . 
  franz ferdinand did n't distance himself from his uncle and the wrongdoings of his country . 
  the dark thing , on the smaller table in the front . 
  i would n't call a person a friend or an ally if he occupies my lands after the previous occupying force leaves . 
  was he not franz josef i ? 
  also , franz ferdinand was n't his son . 
  the emperor was his uncle . 
  is that an ashtray on the table ? 
  i have to agree with the albanian chap , a.a. and k.u. , great choice . 
  they do n't like it , but keep quiet mostly . 
  well , i do n't know about you czechs , but after centuries of occupation by the ottomans , bosnia was immediately occupied by austria-hungary . 
  princip was a murderer , no doubt about it , but who 's the main villain - princip ( who kills the leader of the occupying forces in his land ) or franz ( future head of state that occupied bosnia ) ? 
  princip may be the devil , but compared to the k&k monarchy he was a saint . 
  drop by belgrade ... 
  i would like more eu support first . 
  but 39 % percent , did n't expect that . 
  i was thinking it 's more like ~ 20 % maximum .

  [ gavrilo princip appreciate ] ( http://mladizaturizam.org.rs/wp-content/gallery/galerija/gavrilo-princip.jpg ), 
  thanks for reminding me of this clip / s, 
  movies can be propaganda . 
  and this one sure was . 
  very , very small . 
  the wast majority of people are against it . 
  personally , i 'd like to see it as a monarchy again . 
  we were always a monarchy until communism and 1945 . 
  both serbian dynasties after the liberation from the ottomans ( kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 and obrenovi\u0107 ) descend from two serb commoners , so they were n't foreigners ( like the neighboring bulgarians , romanians , greeks , or , one could argue , most of europe ) . 
  hahah , well in 1405 [ despot stefan the tall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stefan_lazarevi%c4%87 ) of serbia was in charge , so he did build these . 
  also , legend has it , the hobbit [ sang ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcsfwgklmsy ) a song about the one ring to the fellowship . 
  ( franco frattini and gerhard schr\u00f6der amused ), 
  the tall building on the right is the [ avaz twist tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/avaz_twist_tower ) , the tallest building in the states of the former yugoslavia . 
  ahahah , he sure was . 
  eli5 : from left to right : crown prince aleksandar kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 , head of the house of kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 and first in line to the throne if serbia ever reverts to being a monarchy again .
