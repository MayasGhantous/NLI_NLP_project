  ana brnabi\u0107 , serbia 's openly gay newly elected prime minister . 
  forgot to add the [ business districts of europe ] flair . 
  it 's not her inauguration , it 's the president vucic 's . 
   no idea how to fix this though . 
  sooner or latter someone is bound to have some sort of an [ idea ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-khek-jaginy/t_plrsaucmi/aaaaaaaandm/tjsc4eazywu/s1600/estado_popular_mundial.png ) how to fix it . 
  no one knows for sure . 
  the best estimate is that it represents an infant jesus , like some babies appear to be bald . 
  serbia can into eu ? 
  more from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cave_church,_rsovci ) . 
  i can imagine ... 
  it 's often like that . 
  ( also , for this particular case , bare in mind almost only muslims live in the area around the church for the last 250 years ), 
  unesco reference number : [ 96 ] ( http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/96/ ) it served as the ecclessiastical seat of the serbian church , and as the baptismal church and state council site of the nemanji\u0107 dynasty , until the last years of the 12th century . 
  i know that from her father 's side she is , that 's why i said partly , but i do n't know about the mother 's side , so i did n't say she 's fully croatian . 
  if you know it for a fact , than you 're right . 
  not only is she gay and a woman , but partly croatian also . 
  three things to trigger the serbs ? 
  do n't bet on it - she 's a member of vu\u010di\u0107 's team , and that 's the only thing that truly triggers everyone normal in serbia . 
  in the words of the late serbian patriarch pavle : [ you have no power here !, 
  we , the fourteen heads of the orthodox church , say [ never !, 
  yes , yes . 
  the seat of `` vojvoda triglavski '' ... 
  it gets me every time . 
  being a male line descendant of one of the montenegro clans , could i apply for citizenship ? 
  * on behalf half of serbia *, 
  yeah , the ones that are cool with the vatican . 
  hey , you 're better at this than i am . 
  great !, 
  the secret serb plan is well on it 's way . 
  we now have one serb country in nato , and one that 's officially on very good terms with russia . 
  * dreams in serbian *, 
  people are very much against nato bombing and , in general , hate nato . 
  they will say this between themselves in private and publicly . 
  that does n't mean anything in itself . 
  see : burning of nato flag in cetinje , historic capital of montenegro [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk2fg-2icfy ), 
  as a serbian , i 'd do the k&k girl anytime !, 
  on second thought , we did do her . 
  sigh ... 
  where are the gs of the cc of the cp of the ussr ? 
  i believe they do . 
  this one , however , i 'm positive he was informed about . 
  and even if he was n't , the people who organized this knew they can get away with it under vu\u010di\u0107 's rule ( because they 're his associates ) . 
  oh yes it does . 
   the buildings in hercegovacka st. were demolished in the night between april 24-25 . 
  according to witnesses , this was done by people wearing balaclavas and using excavators , who also locked some eyewitnesses in a hangar . 
   `` although people called the police , reporting mistreatment by the masked men , the police did not respond and told them instead to get in touch with the municipal police , '' beta said . 
   serbian ombudsman sasa jankovic on monday published his report on concerning the work of the police in that night , which states that police officers were ordered by the top police echelons to direct citizens to call the municipal police . 
   he on wednesday said that `` the interior ministry should apologize to the citizens for leaving them at the mercy of men in balaclavas . '', 
   overall , all three of them are scumbags . 
  this . 
  yesterday the new president swore oath . 
  his name is aleksandar vu\u010di\u0107 , and in this photo from 2012 he 's the pushed-aside-looking guy in the back . 
  his then boss , tomislav nikoli\u0107 had just won the election ( stripes tie ) and became the president , succeeding boris tadi\u0107 ( dark tie ) . 
  five years later , vu\u010di\u0107 won the presidential election with an unprecedented landslide victory in the first round and is the most powerful guy in the country . 
  so the photo 's a bit funny . 
  what is not funny is that vu\u010di\u0107 is a dangerous dictator-wannabe ( his role models are orban , erdogan and the type ) , endangering media and personal freedoms and pulling the strings in all three branches of government . 
  and the eu , usa and russia mostly support him . 
  bitch please : https://www.reddit.com/r/historyporn/comments/5xp266/serbian_soldier_milunka_savi%c4%87_18921973_possibly/, 
  pretty much , yes . 
  serbian women view the `` mature '' category ... interesting . 
  they got the `` too balkans '' part . 
  yes , exactly , diminutive form, 
  you have a rarer version , a last name from the name of a female , not a male , ancestor . 
  you are descended from a woman called mara . 
  when i typed `` why is serbia '' here from serbia , i got :  why is serbia the first in the chain why is it smallest wtf . 
  some wwi cartoon . 
  also , one of the suggestions is `` why is serbia so cold '' . 
  lol siberia ... 
  i like the us version more . 
  jovanovi\u0107 in serbian is n't merely `` son of john '' it 's more like `` the little son of john '' or `` the little ones of john '' like : mi\u0161 ( mouse ) - mi\u0161i\u010d ( little , small mouse ) petao ( rooster , archaic would be `` petal '' ) - petli\u0107 ( little rooster ) so : jovan - john jovanov - john 's ( son ) jovanovi\u0107 - the small son/whoever of john great post though !, 
  three levels , never mind the order : 1 : slovenia vs slovakia , ( ill-informed ) people mix them 2 : calling the czech republic - czechia , which triggers a lot of czechs 3 : saying no more czechia to `` hold you back '' when in reality it was slovakia the czechs said was holding them back in czsk ( mostly ) and also in sfry slovenes said about the other republics, 
  love it !, 
  it 's a poke in the eye on three different levels . 
  the serbian orthodox church of the ascension of god is right next to it in the photo . 
  greetings from a boring haplotype i2a  cts10228 ( so called i2a-dinaric ) serbian !, 
  also , these are not `` dna haplogroups '' but rather `` y chromosome haplogroups '' ( passed on from father to son ) because there are also mitochondrial dna haplogroups ( passed on from mother to children ) . 
  which france and which england in roman times ? 
  it would be the same if i drew a cartoon of serbia and croatia fighting against and learning from rome - absurd . 
  it 's a beast , eating those who have fallen from orthodoxy , even if they 're bishops and kings . 
  like , it may represent for example - arius , priest from baucalis in egypt ( 3/4th century ) , who 's teachings were condemned at the 1st ecumenical council of nicea - apollinaris , bishop of laodicea in syria ( 4th century ) , some of who 's teachings were condemned at the 2nd ecumenical council , in constantinople - emperor leo iii the iconoclast or other east roman emperors that fought against icons ( condemned at the 7th ecumenical council ) etc. . . 
  behind them - probably stalin and lenin . 
  as for serbian places that look game of thronesy , google if you wish `` golubac tvrdjava '' , it 's currently under reconstruction . 
  he 's not an american . 
  kek, 
  that explains it !, 
  in school from history we usually learned what was the most important endowment monastery for each late-medieval ruler , so manasija was despot stefan 's . 
  also , it was in the papers quite a bit when they found stefan 's or vuk 's grave inside ( dna proved ) cca 8 years ago . 
  funny you did n't now , at least from history , but ok , 
  yes , this exactly . 
  especially sites like manasija where serbia still had some control in the 15th century . 
  how old are you , bro ? 
  been there , it 's great to see and admire . 
  it 's not . 
  interestingly , serbs also commemorated yesterday , and also today , the genocide committed against the serbs by nazi puppet - croat usta\u0161as , especially around jasenovac concentration camp . 
  but i do n't suppose the world media will cover it . 
  potato = vodka, 
  well , in serbia this would be strictly forbidden , and it 's still on the map . 
  also , even it says so in e.g. 
  austria , it does not mean a person * is * a christian . 
  how the fuck do you know who was born or who died as a christian .
