as a neutral i can confirm that they indeed are not europeans . 
  to put things into perspective , 50000 people is 0.43 % of moscow 's population , assuming they 're all from the city . 
  and this is to honour the guy who got shot . 
  i 'm sure many of them never heard of him until two days ago . 
  he was [ a western agent ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bipse9t.jpg ) and thus largely unpopular . 
  now , you can stroke each others dicks in the unique / r/europe 's circlejerky fashion as much as you like but the fact is that he was no democratic messiah who was going to overthrow le putler and turn russia into your ~ ~ bitch ~ ~ `` partner '' any day now .

  you 're joking but it 's true , half the western turkey has serbian genes . 
  that 's how you got white . 
  [ this is our claim . 
  nah , that happened last year . 
  they let freaks and weirdos win only every few years ( lordi monsters in 2006 , lesbian \u0160erifovi\u0107 in 2007 , sjw loreen in 2012 , conchito in a dress in 2014 ) and i think it 's time for a `` normal '' singer again . 
  a nation that forgets its past is doomed to repeat it . 
  there is no expiry date when it comes to remembrance for our victims . 
  from kosovo in 1389 to bosnia in 1995 , they all died defending serbia and they will live in our memories forever and if god is just some day they will all be revenged . 
  especially the 750000 that died in [ jasenovac ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jasenovac_concentration_camp ) . 
  because they hate russia and its allies . 
  they 're hypocrites with double standards . 
  but * ni\u010dija nije gorela do zore * . 
  they will pay for all this bullshit one day . 
  the moscow times is worse than sputnik . 
  yes , those who converted were considered free men and did n't get sexually molested by the anatolian gypsies who had a lot of perverted practices . 
  just take a look at the woman in the article . 
  you think her gene pool is clean , that she 's an average slav with no middle eastern influence whatsoever ? 
  have you ever compared people from vojvodina , which was under hungarian rule and hence free from turks , and those from belgrade and souther serbia ? 
  it 's like two different nations . 
  they do but they 're very few . 
  unfortunately the genetic enrichment with turks went both ways , but that 's the price you pay for not betraying the faith of your forefathers . 
  better a curly haired orthodox gypsy than an aryan kebab . 
  * you * would love a rainbow flag , would n't you ? 
  there 's a serbian version as well : [ medo brundo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcbx5lh3hxi ), 
  ok , you understand why serbia had to command jna to start fighting in slovenia , croatia and bosnia . 
  same can be said about every prominent polish and baltic politician . 
  they keep talking about russia all the fucking time . 
  edit : [ downvote all you want ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iypxy4t.png ), 
  yeah , that 's when we tried to remove gulash in exchange for vojvodina ( which we did eventually steal from you ) but the austrians broke their promises . 
   at a crucial point during the war against the hungarian government , in late march 1849 when the austrians needed more serbian soldiers to fight the war , the austrian general georg rukavina baron von vidovgrad , who commanded the austrian troops in hungary , officially re-stated this promise of independence for vojvodina and conceded to all the demands of the patriarch regarding serbian nationhood . 
  followers of the idea of a `` greater serbia '' hoped that an independent vojvodina would sooner or later attach itself to the serbian nation . 
  that 's a bad arguing point as srebrenica [ was not a genocide ] ( https://sg.news.yahoo.com/srebrenica-massacre-not-genocide-serb-president-135252969.html ) , most western countries recognize the armenian one and turkey has been denying it long before 1995 . 
  looks like you did your homework , you filthy croatian agent , 
  http://i.imgur.com/lrcduqv.jpg [ reference ] ( http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-10-26-serb-stealth_x.htm ), 
   `` one alliance is going to be around germany , the baltic countries , maybe central european countries plus croatia and slovenia . 
  the other alliance is going to be around france and it might take mediterranean countries . 
  and the third is going to be great britain that will go with the united states , '' the official said . 
  `` the brits will always take the american side . 
  everything depends on paris and berlin . 
  i am counting on paris and on the german common sense and on the pragmatism of german foreign policy . '', 
   ivica dacic told the associated press in an interview that serbia 's close-knit relationship with traditional slavic ally russia `` most certainly is not a handicap '' when it comes to remaining unbiased in the ukrainian crisis . 
   dacic said `` even the ukrainian foreign minister told me ... they see it as an advantage if it is used for de-escalation '' of hostilities . 
  great job dude . 
  you just busted not one , not two , but * three * foreigners posing as serbs and trying to make you look bad . 
  ^ / s by the end of the day you 'll be the only serb left on this site haha . 
  i just do n't know whether we should be flattered or worried by the lengths you went to discover our `` true identities '' . 
  that 's fucked up . 
  haha interesting . 
  some of it even makes sense . 
  it 's not true but it makes sense , logical conclusions you have there . 
  / r/serbia is not a very welcoming place for anyone right of ds so i do n't write much there . 
  why did you rule out the possibility of me and crni being serbs from rs ? 
  hmm was n't i a croat the other day ? 
  well whatever i might be , please keep me updated on your conspiracy theory . 
  it 's interesting . 
  and it 's even starting to make sense . 
  just yesterday i realized that it 's practically impossible for a serbian patriot to discover this site . 
  by the laws of nature reddit is reserved for liberal cocksuckers from downtown belgrade who project their little nato , gay , eu-loving bubble on the rest of serbia . 
  http://i.imgur.com/kprj2w7.jpg http://i.imgur.com/uapkznj.jpg if you 're wondering why , read a history book . 
  swedes and the rest of the eu , fucking clickbait  the russian embassy suggested ** sweden and others ** had provoked russia into seizing part of its neighbour 's territory by offering ukraine a pathway to membership of the european union  `` the main tool turned out to be a state coup , a violent power takeover , which pushed ukraine into the abyss of civil war , '' the embassy wrote . 
  that 's exactly what happened . 
   i 'm not sure how well that would go with a lot of * accidental * friendly fire from both sides . 
  so it 's eu only ? 
  well screw you too , serbia and moldova will make their own military with rakija and hookers . 
  jokes aside , i really hope the eu will man up and turn itself into a true world superpower , instead of being america 's sidekick . 
  a united european army is crucial for that .

  the problem is that you doing `` good '' ( warmongering ) can put real people 's lives at risk . 
  you can sit all comfortably , stuffing yourself with pizza and coke , browsing dank memes , spreading * the real truth * about russia and whatnot but until the russian troops reach your town , you 'll be at no risk whatsoever . 
  you have very little to lose . 
  in the meanwhile , hundreds of thousands will be dying on the front line . 
  and for what ? 
  for a meaningless conflict ( partly ) overescalated by internet warriors like you . 
  and yes , being a live target for the russian army is a hundred times more useful than circlejerking on the internet . 
  you do n't win a war with upvotes . 
  as much as i like slutty western chicks , i think it would be very wise to ban the miniskirts as they 're bad for your health . 
  france already banned wearing curtains to wahhabi chicks so it would be cool to do a similar ban for the other side of the clothing spectre , to make things even . 
  also lol @ your logic . 
  i agree . 
  rip native americans edit : [ and bisons ] ( http://public.media.smithsonianmag.com/legacy_blog/767px-bison_skull_pile_edit.jpg ) , of course . 
  it 's 2015 , we should n't be taking orders from a 230 years old country . 
  https://i.imgur.com/re3r1hb.jpg there 's a russian flag on ops photo as well . 
  no dude that 's latvia . 
  nah , their blue is much ligher and they 're pretty cool . 
  and it ca n't be nato either because they obviously paid attention to details . 
  what 's that flag on the left , the one with the pig head ? 
  thanks for the links . 
  i was using the first one .
