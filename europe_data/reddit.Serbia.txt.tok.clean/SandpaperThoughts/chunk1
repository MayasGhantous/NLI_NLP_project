true . 
  by 2020 eu wo n't even exist . 
   if serbia did not slaughter bosniacs go ahead and link me ** one ** war crime committed by serbia against bosniaks . 
   and fomented hate in kosovo fomented hate by fighting armed separatist groups who wanted illegal secession ? 
  well maybe you should n't have been fascists at the first place . 
  then you 'd be a sovereign nation today , and not nato puppet . 
  it 's not like they had forcibly built that base and used it against your will . 
  reap -  sow . 
  a bulgarian dude who was guarding the beach moved our tent flap ( which we used to mark our territory ) next to the trash can . 
  then i offered him rakia . 
  since then we became buddies and he did n't touch our tent flap again . 
  someone should ban erdogan instead . 
  that 's from hybrid theory . 
  but i guess that in the end it does n't even matter . 
  http://siteresources.worldbank.org/intwdr2009/resources/4231006-1204741572978/vollmer.pdf it 's from 2008 , but it explains this phenomenon in detail . 
  it 's really worth reading . 
  come to serbia . 
  you do n't need visa , just vodka . 
  we have elections this sunday . 
  sure . 
  russia was in deep crisis in 90s and was literally falling apart . 
  gorbachev and yeltsin created a huge mess . 
  balance of powers is not restored back to cold war era level , but it 's much better what we have now with putin , that what we had in 90s with yeltsin . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_bombing_of_the_chinese_embassy_in_belgrade ) is probably the most embarrassing thing in the entire operation . 
  yugoslavia was under un arms embargo since 1998 . 
  there were talks between slobodan and lukashenko about s-300 before that , but the deal was never completed . 
  slobodan assumed that nato would have to seek unsc approval for bombing , like they did in 1995 , which could be vetoed . 
  he did n't believe that they will make such a dangerous precedent and bomb a country of their own accord . 
  yeltsin was a complete disaster for russia , but if there was no bombing of yugoslavia , i doubt that putin would step up and stop the destruction of russia . 
  he knew that they 're next if he does n't do anything . 
  it 's the first stealth aircraft to be taken down in the entire history . 
  wreckage was sold to either china or russia . 
  the us were the only user of f-117 , they never sold it to their allies and it was flying directly from the us during the bombing missions . 
  and now their opponents posses a piece of their multi-billion dollar worth technology . 
  in conclusion , it was n't just `` an aircraft '' , it was way more than that . 
  sure , if we would stop disposing them like [ this . 
  as long as she 's not caring about the number of instagram likes and the number of shoes in her shoe cabinet , everything 's fine . 
  i hope she did n't get spoiled by capitalism , like most women in former yugoslavia did . 
  yeah , they were shitty , but they were n't designed to be luxurious , but affordable . 
  well , if people need to buy a new washing machine every 30 years , that 's not really good for economy . 
  i prefer stuff made in ussr or yugoslavia . 
  they last forever . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a5ct7vvcgk ), 
   people got over the berlin wall , and escaped the ussr into finland , and that 's just a few examples . 
  but not * en masse * . 
  [ lukashenko learned from the best . 
  because it 's shitty weather , otherwise the city actually looks very nice . 
  i doubt that even they want them back . 
  one more asylum seeker in germoney . 
  asylum in germany . 
  i 'm sure he 'll seek it soon . 
  40 years sounds quite optimistic to be honest . 
  #the russians are coming !!, 
   japan still has the death penalty wow . 
  til . 
  yeah , and if those kids would act civilized and not like complete retards , it would be somewhat bearable . 
  nothing raises my blood pressure like when they flood the bus , and then 3 - 4 of them have to exit at every bus stop so people from the back can move and leave , and then they get back in . 
   sometimes they 're so full you ca n't even ~ ~ move ~ ~ ** breathe ** . 
  ftfy . 
  same thing with buses in serbia . 
  latvia has many russian speaking non-citizens , so the result is not a surprise - non-citizens can not vote . 
  latvia is super tolerant towards their russian minority . 
  [ they even held a referendum in 2012 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latvian_constitutional_referendum,_2012 ) whether to include russian as official language . 
  i used to spend some time in kuldiga , which has almost no russian minority , and i have n't met a single person that did n't speak russian language . 
  it 's pretty much de facto 2nd official language in latvia . 
  it 's also a compulsory subject in school ( or at least it was when i visited ) . 
  when a cell phone number is not available , you 'll hear a notification in english , latvian and russian . 
  or when a website is blocked for some reason , notification will be displayed in latvian and russian . 
  almost all classified ads in ethnically mixed areas ( like ventspils ) are written in both latvian and russian , especially those for apartment renting . 
  so it 's easy to survive in latvia with a combination of english and russian ( as long as you do n't have to do any paperwork ) . 
  in latvia they have their own version of gopnik called [ urla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fazpb99pcbg ) . 
  i 've heard stories that in riga they approach people telling them they have a sim card but no phone , and ask them to give them their phone in order to make a phone call , and after they get the phone - they run away . 
  anyway , i did n't get a feeling that russian minority is discriminated in any way in latvia and latvian people even in ethnically homogeneous towns learn russian language and do n't refrain to use it . 
  germoney good , germoney rich . 
  i 'm surprised that the government did n't scramble the radio signal . 
   it 's hard to go back to bujanovec or other villages in serbia which had thousands of albanians and now they 're counted by dozens , basically the same . 
  i have no idea what are you talking about . 
  there are 3.590 albanians in bujanovac . 
  and there are villages like dobrosin and veliki trnovac that have no serbs at all , only albanians . 
  they get education in their native language and have all the possible rights . 
  [ it worked well for kosovo albanians . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_albanians#demographics ), 
  let 's call them terrorists instead . 
  destroy capitalism . 
  another columbine copycat ? 
  lpt : do n't stick your dick in crazy . 
   nazi cows [ it 's actually a real thing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heck_cattle ) . 
  there was an interesting documentary about them on ngc . 
  it 's not a debate , it 's a fact . 
  see icty ruling and stop spreading false information . 
  serbian government had nothing to do with srebrenica . 
  slobodan never had any control over republika srpska army , or karadzic and mladic . 
  when politicians are incapable of fixing their country and improving lives of their citizens , they always start with nationalistic bullshit . 
  most likely yes . 
  erdogan is the constitution now . 
  i 'm sure erdogan will mention hitler and austria in the same sentence very soon . 
   interesting irrelevant detail : the mayor of rotterdam is a moroccan immigrant and a practicing muslim . 
  so he is an isis supporter that despises erdogan . 
  many serbs praise putin and despise merkel . 
  but if they could choose between living in russia or germany , they 'd choose germany .
