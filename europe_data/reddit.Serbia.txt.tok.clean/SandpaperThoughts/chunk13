  do you eat it with a fork or a spoon ? 
  ^ / jk too bad mobility is pretty much non-existent here . 
  well someone 's got ta do the victim blaming job . 
  the word terrorism is being thrown around like it has no meaning , and frankly it 's starting to lose its meaning . 
  i 'd make it 18 because current situation is heavily abused by old dudes ( when i say old i mean even up to 60 ) . 
  there are so many irresponsible parents who have absolutely no idea where their daughter is during the day and if she 's seeing anyone , which makes girls extremely vulnerable . 
  i really have no idea what they had in mind when they set age of consent to be 14 . 
  c'mon , girls are in 7th or 8th grade of elementary school at that age . 
  i felt like that during the nato bombing , and later during milosevic 's arrest . 
  super annoying stuff for me back then , but i did have cartoon network so i enjoyed when i had control of the remote . 
  and during 9/11 people celebrated here a lot . 
  i guess we could mail-order some . 
  plus single , aged 18 - 30 . 
  i wonder which percent of those claiming to be female are trolls . 
  if something bad would happen here , i 'd be the first one to escape and seek asylum in germany . 
  it 's time to change many constitutions , asylum laws and geneva refugee convention .

  ferry is n't a war vessel , they can not seek asylum there even though it 's british . 
  i 'm pretty sure they will be removed before it leaves the dock . 
  too weak and too disorganized . 
  it 's so much easier for australia to do whatever it wants since it 's one country . 
  it 's quite popular i guess . 
  but not as much as water polo . 
  also , people in refugee camps are genuine refugees . 
  two words  roma  ghetto, 
   if schengen falls would it will be like the disentegration of the ussr / ** yugoslavia ** ? 
  hopefully not . 
  sweden was granting permanent residence permits to syrians since 2013 . 
  if that was n't an open invitation , i do n't know what is . 
  here it 's grandmas and frogs . 
   it 's really a basic safety issue . 
  at this point i though you were about to mention pick pocketing . 
  i do not think that any syrian will be deported anytime soon . 
  situation there is just too unstable . 
   please have more kids guys ? 
  it kinda gets more and more difficult to find girls that want kids , and if they do , they want no more than 1 . 
   the world is overpopulated . 
  not really . 
  parts of africa and asia might be , but europe is generally underpopulated , especially eastern europe . 
  if you manage to convince people they should be happy because at least they 're not starving , everything is sustainable . 
  yeah , me neither . 
  my pension money is stolen long ago . 
  mouse wheel is usually either for ammo or bunny hop . 
  taser and pepper spray would be a much better option imho . 
  we could make panonian sea again . 
  but then my home would be flooded and i 'd have to move to germoney . 
   in the 1948 census there were about 33,000 albanians in serbia , while in 2011 there were only 5,000 . 
  * `` most albanians boycotted the 2011 census , which resulted in only 5,809 albanians being recorded as living in serbia .

  $ 9.99 per month for a hd plan . 
  for $ 9.99 i could buy snacks and drinks instead , while watching the exact same stuff downloaded from kat for $ 0.00 . 
  schengen * is * danger . 
  guilty or not , if you 're being questioned by the police , do n't say a thing until you have a good lawyer with you . 
  there 's always a cop that wants to use some dirty tricks on you to make you say something that can lead to self-incrimination , especially when he * knows * you 're guilty , but does n't have enough evidence . 
  so be careful when you 're asked with yes/no questions , as it can be easily taken out of context and used against you on the court . 
  you 're innocent until it 's proven you 're guilty , not the vice-versa . 
  here in serbia it 's 3 % , sometimes more . 
  majority of small shops do not accept cards for that reason . 
   denmark has had the worlds fastest drop in snail mail due to the internet , but it will happen everywhere eventually . 
  yeah , i 'm glad to see our government institutions here in serbia slowly introducing [ e-mail ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a5xtrfu.jpg ), 
   the czech secret service apparently has frozen v\u00edt jedli\u010dka 's assets too for fraud . 
  any more info about this ? 
  nah , if pharmacy is at least 50km away from my place ^ lol, 
  winter in 2012 was extremely snowy and cold here . 
   it is believed their wrongdoings costed the state more than 100 million euros . 
  it really sucks to be a tax payer here . 
   sadly , many of the well educated ones are too fucking lazy to vote yeah , that seems to be the problem everywhere . 
  educated people not interested in politics , while dumb ones vote for the party that gives the most fake promises . 
  the best thing he can do is to move back to his home country , where he has the citizenship . 
  even after taxes , he 'll have more than enough money to live comfortably for the rest of his life . 
  without a residence permit in europe , there is n't much he can do , and senegal is listed as a safe third country with no wars and political persecution . 
  still , there 's a huge problem with deportation of rejected asylum seekers , especially those with no documents . 
  their country of origin must agree to accept them back , otherwise they are free to roam around your country indefinitely . 
  3300 slackers sitting on their asses all day long and doing nothing productive . 
  i only had english as mandatory foreign language when i was in school , from 5th grade until the end of high school ( 12th grade ) . 
  i had option to learn hungarian as well , but i was too lazy , and it was too difficult for me . 
  other high schools ( gymnasiums ) had french language as mandatory from 9th grade until 12th grade , and latin language ( only in 9th grade ) . 
  well , teenagers are minors ( except those that are 18 and 19 ) , and therefore it would be very illegal to posses and spread those nude pics around . 
  plus , no website would ever host such material , except those on tor . 
  i was trying to say that nude pics where your face is clearly visible is an extremely bad idea , since it does n't give you any room to deny that it 's you on the pic . 
  it 's a common sense , imho . 
  very stupid , especially if the face is visible . 
  stalking , i assume . 
  we have no law regulating this activity . 
  ^ ^ hooray, 
  those in [ ni\u0161 ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bmyfcrbiyaecvyz.jpg:large ) are much uglier imo .

  kastrup airport . 
  it feels great actually . 
  no rain , no snow , just pure awesomeness . 
  that sounds like current serbian government . 
  it 's super weird . 
  fyr sparta, 
  i agree , this is a huge issue . 
  especially now when no girl wants to live in a house/apartment together with husband 's parents , which used to be a normal thing here in the previous century . 
  clay = = land, 
   buzzing by the border , looking out for little green men aliens in europe come in different color . 
  i agree . 
  only thing that i used to buy online are games via steam ( when i had time for gaming ) , and only when there was a discount . 
  playing on vac protected servers is more enjoyable than playing on pirated servers full of skids with cheats .
