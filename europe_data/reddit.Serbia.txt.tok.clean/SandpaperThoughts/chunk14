  til i live in a free country . 
  i thought that illegal guns have their serial numbers scratched out . 
   want to cross the norwegian-russian border ? 
  sorry , you need a schengen visa for that . 
  what 's that , you want to apply for asylum ? 
  sorry , you can only do that legally when on norwegian soil . 
  so they can just punch a cop and get dragged into jail ( norwegian soil ) and apply for asylum there . 
  unpatchable loophole !, 
  ^ lol, 
  yeah , that 's my favorite . 
   what about hungarian minority areas in central europe ? 
  [ vojvodina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vojvodina ) is one of them , marked as a separate country on this map . 
  it 's funny because most of the separatists here on north are actually ethnic serbs . 
  unfortunately , there 's a small chance that anyone will be prosecuted for this . 
  that 's a sad reality . 
  last month [ islamic state graffiti were sprayed on serb homes in kosovska mitrovica ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=27&amp;nav_id=96193 ) . 
  if crimes go unpunished , there 's nothing to prevent offenders from committing them . 
  wow . 
  but is n't it illegal for russians to deny entry for people with russian residence permit ? 
  ** serbia ** * [ german parliament 's ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=27&amp;nav_id=96192 ) committee for european affairs has given the green light for the opening of the first two chapters in serbia 's eu accession negotiations . 
  * [ islamic state ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=27&amp;nav_id=96193 ) graffiti have been sprayed on serb homes in ethnically mixed neighborhoods in northern kosovska mitrovica , the police have confirmed . 
  * [ labor minister ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=27&amp;nav_id=96181 ) : number of migrants falling . 
  aleksandar vulin stated on thursday that the number of migrants entering serbia from the direction of macedonia has fallen considerably . 
  * [ the government of japan ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=27&amp;nav_id=96187 ) has decided to grant around usd 2.7 million for protection of refugees in serbia and macedonia from cold weather . 
  * [ serbian president ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=27&amp;nav_id=96191 ) tomislav nikolic will partake in the cop21 un climate change conference in paris on november 30 , the president 's office announced on friday . 
  * [ november 25 ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_id=96160 ) , the day of vojvodina 's unification with serbia , has been marked in serbia 's northern province . 
  * [ the construction ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=24&amp;nav_id=96145 ) of a high-speed rail line between serbia and hungary will begin this year , chinese prime minister li keqiang said on tuesday . 
  * [ 700 members ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=23&amp;nav_id=96124 ) of security forces take part in exercise . 
  nope , they need visa for eu . 
  imho , poverty is not a reason why would a female get involved in prostitution , but an excuse . 
  and majority of street girls that do it for cheap are actually hard drugs addicts that want to get money fast and feed their addiction . 
  it 's extremely difficult for people from these countries to obtain a schengen visa , even a tourist one , because there 's a high risk of abuse ( terrorism , illegal immigration , illegal work , asylum etc. ) . 
  so they get rejected regularly . 
  it makes no sense for isps to block torrent websites , when anyone can just open tor browser and access all blocked sites with ease . 
  situation with somali pirates is quite better now , when private security contractors can shoot them dead on the spot . 
  box will be saved and will be given to some other friend/coworker/relative . 
  after a month or two , it will make a full circle and eventually come back to you . 
  they come by airplane to turkey , and then by boat to greece . 
  it makes me wonder why do n't they just obtain a tourist visa for serbia or macedonia and then continue their journey by bus/train , instead of paying 1000 - 2000 eur to smugglers and risk their lives in overcrowded boats . 
  [ do n't forget the bonus panel ] ( https://i.imgur.com/8ysqeuc.png ), 
  here in serbia situation is not any different than in croatia and other former yugoslav countries . 
  back then in yugoslavia it was very easy to get a loan from the bank and build a house on your own . 
  my grandpa was the only person employed in his family , and he managed to repay the loan in a short period of time and almost did n't feel it , went to seaside every year , plus bought a new car . 
  i guess that situation in estonia is n't much different than in latvia or lithuania . 
  i was surprised by the presence of commieblocks in latvia . 
  even towns with less than 8000 people have barely any houses , and many of those houses predate communism . 
  some predate tesla . 
  there 's still market for them , because if it managed to survive for so long , then it must be good . 
  [ brutalist architecture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brutalist_architecture ) was present everywhere in europe , but was extremely popular during the time of communism . 
  * `` brutalism as an architectural philosophy was often also associated with a socialist utopian ideology , which tended to be supported by its designers , especially alison and peter smithson , near the height of the style . 
  this style had a strong position in the architecture of european communist countries from the mid-1960s to the late 1980s ( bulgaria , czechoslovakia , gdr , ussr , yugoslavia [ 5 ] ) . 
  in czechoslovakia brutalism was presented as an attempt to create a `` national '' but also `` modern socialist '' architectural style . 
  true . 
  water polo . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/hronika/prevodioci-razvrstavaju-ratne-i-ekonomske-migrante.sr.html ) article , classification of people without documents is handled by translators . 
  it 's also stated that it 's difficult to determinate accurately on spot where is someone coming from . 
  * `` an excellent translator with extensive experience can hardly tell the difference in the dialects spoken in iraq , syria , jordan , let alone someone with no experience . 
  now that judgment is left to the translators who are often semi-skilled and sometimes subjective . 
  '' * also , any kind of classification and discrimination of migrants is unconstitutional and is against our asylum law , but it 's done because slovenia and croatia are not letting them to enter their countries . 
  meanwhile , [ thousands of migrants that are not allowed to enter macedonia ] ( http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=22&amp;nav_category=78&amp;nav_id=1066007 ) are blocking the international railway on greece - macedonia border 3rd day in a row and using railway sleepers as firewood . 
  probably 1 guy actually worked , while 49 were sitting on their asses doing nothing all day and waiting for the paycheck . 
  actually most of the websites were done in joomla and were hacked in the past . 
  real cost was few thousands of eur at most , rest of the money went to pockets of politicians . 
   yeah . 
  at moments like this i just want to leave this shithole thinking it will never get better . 
  they do whatever they want and people just feel helpless . 
  true . 
  elections are there to circle a political party that you want to rob you for the next few years and give you false hope that things will improve . 
  4.1 million eur ? 
  wow . 
  and i though that our government is robbing us by spending 30.000 - 40.000 eur per website . 
  ** serbia ** [ only people from war zones - iraq , syria and afghanistan are allowed to enter the country ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=19&amp;nav_id=96100 ) , while others are treated as `` economic migrants '' and turned back to macedonia . 
   all of eastern europe not all . 
  eu citizens can use their id instead of passport for identification . 
  albanian , montenegrin , macedonian , bosnian and serbian citizens must use their passport . 
  you can not get on the airplane without documents . 
  jail is not the happiest place to spend your retirement . 
   i 'd feel pretty weird enjoying a concert when i 'd know there had been a massacre there . 
  yeah . 
  reminds me of the columbine massacre , where school planned to re-open the library where the most of the kids died , but parents pressured them to build a new one . 
  i ca n't imagine how survivors would feel like going to the library every week where they almost lost their lives . 
  crazy drugged criminal with an ak47 roaming the city , i would n't find that hilarious . 
   then who 's problem are they ? 
  is it their fault because isis and corrupt governments are threatening their lives ? 
  imo , refugees from the middle east should be taken by all countries that signed 1951 refugee convention , some more , some less - depending on their size and economic strength . 
  europe is not separated from the middle east by ocean and can be reached on foot , and it 's unfair to expect that europe should accept every refugee just because refugees ca n't easily reach other countries . 
  but how can they tell who 's from syria , iraq and afghanistan , and who 's pretending to be from there when majority of migrants do n't have passport or id , and some of them have counterfeit passports . 
  macedonia started building a fence on southern border , and that means that migrants will be stuck in greece . 
  this is all chain reaction because slovenia stopped receiving economic migrants from croatia , which stopped receiving economic migrants from serbia . 
   i am surprised there are people living in the uk who do n't speak english ... 
  there are people born in serbia with serbian citizenship that do n't speak serbian . 
  someone should inform them that this is n't austro-hungarian empire anymore . 
  it 's not uncommon if they are studying in english and do n't plan to stay in france afterwards . 
  maybe they are just illegal migrants that want to discard their original passports and buy fake syrian passports somewhere in turkey and go to germany to seek asylum , but maybe they are isis terrorist that want to blend with migrants , and then go to germany or elsewhere to blow stuff up . 
  it 's impossible to tell at the first glance . 
  that dude that blew himself up in paris had a fake syrian passport and claimed everywhere where he was registered that he was syrian , but only fact that we know about him that he took a regular migrant route from turkey and then via balkans . 
  it 's currently impossible to tell what is his country of origin ( or even a continent ) . 
  it makes me wonder why did they attempt an attack now when cops are everywhere and everyone is on high alert . 
  if their country of origin wants them back , yes . 
  everyone that makes it to germany can seek asylum .
