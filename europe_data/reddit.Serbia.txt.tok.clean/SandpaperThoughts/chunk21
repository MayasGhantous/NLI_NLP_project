  i really fail to see any logic behind living in poland . 
  democratic as well . 
  it 's a good idea to have an internationally recognized id such is passport , even if you have to illegally cross the border . 
  it 's valid for a long time , 10 years should be a standard . 
  i 'd suggest you to delete all accounts on social media , encrypt your phone and hdd , use tor + vpn to browse internet , make sure your passport , money and a bag with the most essential stuff is ready , install cameras around your house , use telegram app as the only way of distance communication . 
  full paranoid mode . 
  but why ? 
  it should n't that be difficult to obtain it ( i think ) . 
  so reddit will forward info about a redditor whenever any government sends such request ? 
  here in serbia citizens are required to have ids with them all the time from age of 16 , or face $ 50 fine if caught without it . 
  you should always have a passport ready in case shit hits the fan . 
   we should just stand by and let them sort out things their way . 
  if turkey explodes , refugees will to go europe - not saudi arabia . 
  why is that sign written only in cyrillic ? 
  majority of bosniaks and bosnian croats ca n't read cyrillic script . 
  install tor , some linux distro and encrypt your hdd . 
  well , cyprus is an eu member state that has 1/3 of territory occupied by turkey for over 40 years . 
   the ambassador made the promise that the eight will have a fair and transparent trial in turkey sure . 
  transparent hanging in the town square . 
   and he added that `` this case must be closed very quickly . 
  i hope that case will not be closed very quickly and they 'll have regular asylum procedure and chance for appeal if 1st instance rejects their applications . 
  maybe it 's time to build the wall . 
  looks like admin set up `` maintenance '' mode on website , as it 's under attack . 
  once attack is over , no username or password will be required . 
  anyway , tl ; dr of the most important stuff would be nice . 
  jna did participate , but as i said , it was army of sfr yugoslavia which was consisted of all ethnicities of sfr yugoslavia and was controlled by sfr yugoslavia , not fr yugoslavia , serbia and montenegro , or serbia . 
  only conflict in which troops from fr yugoslavia ( serbia ) participated was kosovo war ( 98-99 ) . 
   but i 'm generally curious , what are some of the war crimes against jna ?

  jna was the military of sfry , not fry or serbia . 
  it was consisted of all ethnicities of sfry and was controlled by ** sfry ** . 
  its role in yugoslav wars ( 1991 - 1995 ) was insignificant as it was dissolved on 20th may 1992 . 
  also , jna never commit any war crimes , while on the other hand members of jna were victims of many . 
  guilty until proven innocent - erdogan 's logic . 
  i would if i could . 
  this is getting out of hand . 
   at least let them keep the `` remove kebab '' - thingy mang those guys in remove kebab video are bosnian serbs . 
  serbia ( former fr yugoslavia ) has nothing to do with them . 
  fry did n't even participate in wars in slovenia , croatia and bosnia and herzegovina . 
  only conflict where fry participated is war against kla terrorists in kosovo who wanted illegal secession . 
  not for erdogan . 
  wikipedia says `` justified use against humans as self-defense is allowed . 
  pepper spray is a very good self-defense weapon . 
  someone forgot to flush toilet . 
  damn , that 's an ancient account . 
  guess who 's sleeping with 72 virgins tonight . 
  of course , strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter . 
  and that 's how you get a full scale civil war . 
  true . 
  only around 10 % of all hungarian passports are issued to ethnic serbs in vojvodina . 
  rest are issued to ethnic hungarians and other minorities . 
  my ancestors are born in ottoman empire unfortunately . 
   and possibly transferring them to hague to be judged or something . 
  in that case , they can hire \u0160e\u0161elj as a lawyer . 
  erdogan is turkish constitution now . 
  they 're safe for now , they can not be deported since their asylum application are being processed , which will take several months i guess . 
  only fair decision is to grant them asylum , but who knows what will happen . 
  nah , i 'm 100 % serb unfortunately . 
  emigration ai n't so easy without eu passport . 
  if it was , i would be out of this shithole long ago . 
  how about capturing and deporting them back to greenland ? 
   the real problem is that the people who support him ( a big majority of them ) say `` i would die for you ! '', 
  regard him somewhat like a prophet . 
  for them , his word is always true , and anybody against him are traitors . 
  [ law 27 : play on people 's need to believe to create a cultlike following ] ( http://48laws-of-power.blogspot.rs/2011/05/law-27-play-on-peoples-need-to-believe.html ) . 
  this is basically also an answer to ops question . 
   how about hdz voters in croatia ? 
  hdz ( the party ) was sentenced in croatian court for stealing public funds and they vote for them because of patriotism ? 
  feelz  realz . 
  serbophobia is still a very powerful feelz in croatia , and those who know it can obtain a great power . 
  turkey is not considered as a safe country ( afaik ) , and they ( most likely ) wo n't be deported even if their asylum applications are rejected , as there 's a risk of torture or death in case they deport them . 
  law 42 : strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter, 
  yup , we 're not getting married . 
   just 30 years ago no one would 've thought of this happening . 
  yeah , imagine reading this title in 1986 . 
  `` closed '', 
  same reason why earth was not hit by a large asteroid in any recent past . 
  pure luck . 
  and we all know that it will happen sooner or later and that it 's inevitable . 
  yes . 
  very popular in syria and iraq . 
  damn . 
  at least truck was not loaded with explosives . 
  isis is notorious for their svbieds . 
   why is religion still a thing ? 
  it 's a way of life for many . 
  just see the middle east . 
  eastern orthodox church . 
  check out austria as well . 
  it 's like germany , but with not so many car factories . 
  bros before hoes . 
  more like appendix of europe . 
   for which yugoslavia got reparations from germany . 
  and that money was used to build [ kr\u0161ko nuclear power plant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kr%c5%a1ko_nuclear_power_plant ) in slovenia . 
  serbia and families of ethnic serbs killed in jasenovac got jack shit . 
   why do ngos keep inflaming the situation ? 
  because george soros is funding those ngos . 
  they do it for money , not because of ideology . 
   they do n't have their own calling code they do . 
  because they did n't win ww2 ?
