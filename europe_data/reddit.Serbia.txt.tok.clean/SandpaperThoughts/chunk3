  nah , they were considered goths . 
  only time will tell . 
  a lot of weird stuff happened regarding wikileaks in the past few months . 
  you can read a detailed timeline [ here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/wikileakstimeline/wiki/index ) . 
  for three months it was n't even certain whether assange is alive or not . 
  and at this point , i 'm personally unsure whether assange and wikileaks are compromised or not . 
  i do n't think assange is going anywhere . 
  if anything happens to him , keys for his insurance files will be released . 
  wikileaks recently published a series of tweets regarding `` vault 7 '' , you can read [ this very interesting theory ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/whereisassange/comments/5tc9wz/not_sure_if_you_guys_have_seen_my_vault_7_theory/ ) . 
  oh yes , because putting people who entered your country illegally in a fenced area makes you hitler . 
  unlike politicians who made the problem in the first place . 
  more like cold war yugoslavia . 
  say thanks to gorbachev . 
  you know the saying - one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter . 
  only when there 's nato support . 
  `` everyone does it '' is just too prevalent here . 
  instead of thinking `` what can i do to fight the corruption ? 
  '' , people usually think `` what can i do in order to become a part of the corruption ? '' . 
  i would say that majority of people do n't have huge ambitions , like buying a sports car or a yacht . 
  they just want a salary that would provide them a place to live away from the parents , 10 - 12 years old used car and a 10 day vacation in greece each year . 
  but unfortunately that became almost impossible without being corrupt . 
  and once you become corrupt , sure , you 'll feel good and satisfied in a short run , but what they do n't realize is that is fucking up the entire society in a long run , and our kids will hate us because of it . 
   damn !, 
  we are screwed no matter what . 
  u_u just form catalonia liberation army and call usaf to bomb the chinese embassy . 
  those parents should be jailed . 
   the ruling party has even used firewood as a means of bribing people for votes . 
  here they use flour , sugar and sunflower oil . 
  firewood prices went through the roof this winter , food is cheaper . 
  not at everything , latvia has bigger russian minority . 
  [ it reminded me of this ] ( https://gfycat.com/achingsadcoypu ), 
   that 's really something unheard of , since he has been always extremely supportive and friendly to russia and putin . 
  nah , [ this is not really something surprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belarus%e2%80%93russia_relations#diplomatic_tension ) . 
  lukasheko is leftist and a hardcore socialist . 
  all big companies in belarus are owned by the state . 
  he wants it to stay that way , and that 's why he keeps russian private money at arm 's length , since he does n't want oligarchs to rule his country . 
  of course , he is a smart guy and wo n't do anything stupid that will make putin mad , but it 's important for him to keep abundance mentality and show that he has other options . 
  unfortunately , i think that after lukashenko , belarus will be completely dragged under russian influence . 
  i always prefer reading articles in english . 
  people who ca n't read english and are limited to stuff typed in their native language are missing out a lot . 
  nice gravedig dude . 
  apparently , not wanting millions of illegal arabs in your country makes you a bad person . 
  yes , there were a lot of blue collar jobs in europe after ww2 , and import of workforce was limited to yugoslavia , turkey and north african countries . 
  some did move to slovenia , but majority moved to germany/switzerland/austria / sweden . 
  they 'd work and send money back to family . 
  they planned to return one day , some of them did , but majority did n't , since yugoslavia collapsed and war started . 
  bosnia was one of the poorest regions of yugoslavia even before the war . 
  a lot of people moved to germany in 70s ( gastarbaiters ) , since there were no jobs in bosnia . 
  but things got waaaay worse after the war , with $ 100 billion damage , tens of thousands of dead and hundreds of thousands of displaced , and country strangely divided by dayton agreement . 
  and there were no longer slovenia and croatia to provide financial assistance , like they did in yugoslavia . 
  french ca n't read english . 
  it is . 
  one man 's revolution , other man 's betrayal . 
  it all depends on viewers perspective . 
  see you again in april !, 
  i 'm not living with family , family is living with me . 
  public sector employees in serbia are basically regime 's personal army , each and every of them goes to vote , and will most likely fight ( if needed ) for the regime , just to keep their jobs . 
  they are cancer and the entire nation is suffering because of it . 
  romania : [ look at me , i 'm serbia now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/06uadnt.jpg ), 
  if you ca n't fight it ( corruption ) , legalize it . 
  ^ / jk ^ of ^ course, 
  and not paying back . 
  if you ca n't fight it , legalize it . 
  damn , this sounds a lot like serbia , tv channels owned by criminals which are used to spread government propaganda among rural uneducated population . 
  i guess we 'll feel consequences of communism for a very long time . 
  it was done by paramilitaries like arkan 's tigers , not yugoslav army or serbian police . 
  erdogan figured out on time that it 's smarter to be with putin than to be against putin , but ukrainians keep smashing and smashing their heads against the wall . 
   all power to the european people !, 
  make communism great again ? 
  this is still better than nothing . 
  belarus is right now practically invaded by outsourcing software companies , like many countries in `` other '' europe ( moldova , macedonia , serbia ... ) . 
  salaries are usually at least 2x or 3x higher than what school teacher gets ( senior developers get more ) . 
  combine that with cheap alcohol , food , drugs , cigarettes and prostitutes , and you can live a really good life if you do n't have any big ambitions . 
  of course , you could die from a stray bullet when local gangs start solving their territorial disputes , or from a brick that fell from a decrepit facade of your commieblock - but hey , what 's life without a little risk ? 
  i remember the story of my grandpa who worked as a waiter in germany during 70s , and one of the cooks in the hotel was a young greek guy . 
  he stayed only for a couple of months before he decided to return to greece . 
  when my grandpa asked him why , he said `` in greece , i can make a little less money than i make in germany , but for a lot less work '' . 
  pull the trigger, 
   russia , china , usa under trump https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_russians_are_coming cold war is over dude . 
  russians ai n't coming . 
  before refugee crisis there was greek crisis . 
  nice to meet you . 
  `` can i pet it ? '', 
  i think it 's now saudi arabia . 
  kosovo parliament can issue whatever declarations they want . 
  they can declare that earth is flat and that sun does n't exist . 
  icj would n't have anything against these declarations . 
  same goes for their independence declaration . 
  it simply has no legal effect , as unsc resolution 1244 is above it , and it confirms that kosovo is serbia . 
  unsc resolution 1244 is still in effect , and kosovo is serbia until unsc adopts a different resolution , and it wo n't happen . 
  1244 unsc resolutions are legally binding . 
  un sc is above all other institutions . 
  kosovo is serbia as long as un sc resolution 1244 is in effect . 
  kosovo is not a member of un and most likely will never become one . 
  un sc resolution 1244 is still in effect and it says that kosovo is serbia . 
  they would have to replace that resolution with a new one that does n't say that kosovo is serbia , but it wo n't happen as long as russia and china have veto powers . 
  also 5 members of eu do n't even recognize kosovo , and they can block its accession . 
  not to mention that kosovo is a completely dysfunctional place and will most likely never fulfill minimal requirements . 
  yugoslav army managed to shoot down a stealth aircraft with cold war technology . 
  i do n't think there are many 18-24 y.o.
