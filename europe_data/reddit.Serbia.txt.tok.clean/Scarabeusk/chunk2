  he is a puppet basically . 
  jankovic said he would give back awards he received from eu because they support vucic . 
  yesterday he brought the former german chancelor shredder ( not how its written ) to his election campaign rally on the day of comemorating nato bombing victims . 
  third one and from the end , seventh look like belgrade . 
  i made a mistake , i wrote the first verb infitive to be re\u0107i while it is actually kazati apperently . 
  and yeah , i found czech and slovak to be very similar to serbian and very easy to learn , to i never comitted . 
  slovak especially seems to me like an example of what to expect from a slavic language , like the best representative of the language group . 
  thanks , yeah i git them mixed up emberasingly ... always thought reknem was just a made up thing as a joke , like \u010dovek - \u010doveci . 
  re\u010d means word . 
  re\u0107i means to say . 
  slovo means letter . 
  osloviti , for example , means to adress ( someone ) . 
  govor means speech . 
  govoriti also means to say but it is a `` lasting '' verb . 
  ( i dont know the terms ) . 
  kazati means to say , too . 
  yeah , serbian empire was small and very short lived and after its short life all serbian lands fell to ottomans almost immediately ; polish-lithuanian was not an empire afaik ; bulgaria had 3 empires actually , which is kinda impressive ; moravia is kinda cool for being a first slavic state . 
  ( there is a ( non-ethnic serb ) historian claiming that moravia ` s core was along the river morava in serbia ) . 
  the bulgarian one doesn ` t only include the green but also the dark red that overlaps with serbian ( which consists of the two red shades ) . 
  you mean the european part ? 
  also this `` urban people and young people '' is a dirty generalisation . 
  thanks for information . 
  or maybe they gave the name to the river ... 
  the turks called the balkan peninsula - rumelia - land of romans . 
  from wiki : r\u016bm millet ( millet-i r\u00fbm ) , or `` roman nation '' , was the name of the orthodox christian community in the ottoman empire . 
  which were of course rich , and had best armor , and lives - training , and paid mercenaries . 
  do bulgarians get their name from river volga ? 
  b and v are mistaken all the time . 
  and they had a big `` country '' on the river . 
  volga , bolga , russians and ukrainians say `` o '' as `` a '' so : balgaria . 
  edit : or maybe they gave the name to the river ... 
  `` white serbia '' is where lusatian serbs aka sorbs live today approximately . 
  also there was a map a while ago here with most common last names in a country and in slovakia it was horvat , really interesting . 
  it adds up , i mean . 
  also , white used to mean northern right ? 
  maybe that is why belarusia is bela ( white ) , because they are north of kiev ? 
  ( as in kievan rus ), 
  i think he is talking about the origin or bosniaks , whose nationalists claim is not from islam-converted serbs and croats . 
  ey , she ` s italian . 
  i think she was smiling because of what she was saying , in case you didnt hear she said `` drago mi je da sam u zemlji u kojoj se osecam kao kod kuce '' if she wasnt a trained speaker she would have burst out laughing . 
  sorry for no translation , someone translated under me though . 
   of course we could n't cope no one wants to be someones else 's milking cow , we had every right to separate just like everyone else did . 
  tell that to the person i replied to , not me lol . 
  erm ... bosniaks declared independence , they were the ones who couldnt cope . 
   originated from kofte kebabs . 
  kebab can over time turn into cevap if mispronounced more and more over a century which is probably what happened . 
  so that is where the slovenes hid their nationalism ... cunning !, 
  they call themselves serby if im not mistaken . 
  its either lusatian serbs/sorbs/wends in english . 
  this is the first time i hear a kosovo albanian say something like that about tito . 
  or hear anything similar . 
  quite the countrary . 
  i mean , you can find albanians dancing with tito on youtube , tito is also known to have liked being a godfather/bestman on albanian weddings , among his other shenanigans . 
  did you live in kosovo during yugoslavia ? 
  before 98 ? 
  this is the first time i hear an albanian say something like that . 
  i think you misunderstood . 
  i meant i disagree with your sentence that all women and children were running from kosovo . 
  i agree that it did happen , but disagree with your exageration . 
   kosovo would have been completely invaded by serbia . . kosovo was serbia already . 
  i guess you are a younger one because independence comes to you so naturaly . 
   we are allowed now to speak and write freely in our language . 
  in yugoslavia , before albanian insurgency , this was already the situation . 
   people are not being put into prisons just because they are albanian . 
  we did not have these privileges before . 
  many of my family members were tortured in prisons just because they had albanian books , or were writers , or would simply not cooperate with the serbian government . 
  whoever accepted to speak only serbian and live under serbian control , had an ok-ish life , everyone else suffered . 
  this started after albanian insurgency btw , when the country fell into crisis . 
  and before that you could switch albanian and serbian in that sentence . 
   we have to intensively clean our government if we want to see any progress , we have to stop all the dirty money we 're getting from saudi arabia , which is used to indoctrinate the young and the poor , and we definitely have to work on our educational system . 
  unfortunately we are not going anywhere , serbia nor kosovo i ` m afraid . 
   you really should start to believe less in what your government tells you man why are albanians obsessed with the idea that serbians are taught in school about evil albanians or that we all listen to some government propaganda all the time about evil albanians ? 
   people were tortured and killed in prisons , all women and children were fleeing to albania and macedonia . 
  many who did not flee were raped and killed . 
  i disagree about ** all ** women and children . 
  agree otherwise . 
   i 'm not saying the albanians did n't do shit too , but the numbers were magnitudes different , as the majority of the population were albanians . 
  that is unknown , and will never be known . 
  for example kla used techniques such as cremating bodies to hide the evidence etc. 
   many of my friends and family members are still traumatized from what they 've seen . 
  irrelevant to the discussion , dont try to manipulate . 
   but without you guys , way more women and children would have been raped / killed in kosovo on the contrary , the usa interference made serbian merceneries even more psychopatic and the albanian mercenaries even more encoured by the support to continue the rape/killing . 
   without the us everyone in kosovo would be dead on the contrary . 
  without the us ( and russia ) the region would have been alive . 
  it is dead right now . 
   without the us everyone in kosovo would be dead  but without you guys , way more women and children would have been raped / killed in kosovo speechless . 
   yes , economically we are a shit hole , and our government is full of criminals , but you know what ? 
  we in kosovo appreciate this more than what we had to endure during serbia 's control . 
  what do you appreciate in your current situation , for example ? 
   i 'm quite sure you learned in school how the evil albanians stole your land , but the majority of historians simply do not agree with this . 
  you are ** quite ** sure ? 
  how could you be ** quite ** sure ? 
  and no , we are not taught that `` evil '' albanians ... anything !, 
  maybe you shouldnt compare the pretty liberal vision of your school histrory teachers to other countries , we dont make things up . 
  and also , we are taught ilyrians , thracians and celts lived here before the romans . 
  idk who started with the `` serbs think they lived here forever '' because we dont and are not taught that . 
  oh , i thought you meant by the yugoslav guards . 
  still , they were getting through to kosovo . 
  at one point my father was part of unit/operation/whatever that guarded the border and returned those who escaped through back to albania . 
  my dad served military time ( edit : in the 80s ! , not during the war ) in kosovo .
