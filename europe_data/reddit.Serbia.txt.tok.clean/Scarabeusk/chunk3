  plus kosovo albanians generally liked tito and yugoslavia until he died . 
   if you crossed the border with yugoslavia your whole family would be sentenced to forced labor . 
  if you were caught crossing the border then you would be shot . 
  albania itself . 
  at periods the border was open for imigrants/refugees of the system , at other times it was stricktly closed for reasons . 
  tito banned return of serbs that flew from the genocide in kosovo during ww2 , also albanians were allowed to settle in kosovo after ww2 as tito wanted to claim albania for his socialist balkan federation . 
  if you want souirces search for them yourself . 
  context man , read the previous comments and you might understand what i meant . 
  kosovo is rich with minerals . 
  also a large yugoslavian military base with built-into the mountain hangar for airplanes exists there . 
   in a proper manner and not by the result of an invasion this was the case with kosovo . 
  except it got anexed by usa , not albania . 
  besides , what does it matter if they declare independence or unification ? 
  then we should all recognise crimea as part of russia , according to you . 
  a lot of them were brought over from albania . 
  `` and they also caused much `` trouble '' with their own speratist movements in other countries which is maybe the reason for the hard nato offensive . '', 
  - so this is a valid reason ? 
  comon , listen to yourself . 
  im not against kosovo independence but that ^ doesnt make sense . 
  so you teach your kids to think for themselves , teach them how to thikn not what to think ( i know its an often used phrase , but apparently not used enough ) . 
  those are not in the eu . 
  just a sidenote . 
  from serbia with love . 
  koplje means spear in serbian . 
  `` its not a fucking protest against the government , its a protest against the fucking belgrade waterfront '' i was talking about the past ones , which were against vucic generaly , not just waterfront , but still called ne davimo beograd . 
  and calm down . 
   yes , all parts of serbia can afford to come to belgrade for night life/colledge i doubt people come from all over serbia for night life all the time / college is a great toll on the provincial family , and it is barely affordable . 
   500-1000 din ( 4-8e ) for a bus ticket or for fuel to come its not enough to just buy a ticket , you have to organise it , and that comes with other expenses , and 1000din is really not a small amount for us . 
  im just saying belgradians dont protest when its something that concerns the republic ( which the city is a part of ) just when something directly affects the city . 
  i mean , the main protest against government is always called `` dont choke belgrade '' . 
  besides , you are the elite , supposedly and like half the population of the country lives there . 
  we do that here too , not really effective . 
  they just give false promises . 
  ( croatian accent ) pravi si ... revolucionar !, 
  yes , and people here are trying to make it sound like it is similar to romanian protests ... 
  that is a good idea actually . 
  it would be the first thing in serbia to `` rally '' something and sound cheerful in a long time . 
  what we can protest is incomperable to what belgradians can do . 
  or did you mean we should come to belgrade ? 
  well , you see , we cant afford it . 
  besides , user `` prokleti '' made a parallel with the current romanian protests so i am just saying its not the same . 
  this is about the city , nothing else . 
  it doesnt translate well bro . 
  something about belgrade . 
  people from belgrade only protest when something happens in the city . 
  the rest of country has been a slum for 30 years ... but who gives a shit about plebs . 
  the protest is called `` ne davimo beograd '' `` lets not drown ( choke ) belgrade '' . 
  true . 
  though what should also be common knowledge is that balkan wars were the two wars before ww1 . 
  first serbia , montenegro , bulgaria and greece against ottomans , second the new balkan states among themselves , caused by world powers . 
  wars in the 90s are usually called yugoslavia breakup wars . 
  `` where i live this is not the official media angle . '', 
  what is an official media angle ? 
  well , its the subtle things that are harder to dismantle and reject than death camps and mass killings , actually . 
  what you sell to the rest of us . 
  romanian cars . 
  polish tech . 
  its a bit more different than the rest of us are different among each other . 
   i always wanted to learn polish . 
  tell me , is every dialect in poland mutually inteligible ? 
  he said `` does not really fit many slavic languages very well . '', 
  not all . 
  however i would say that having to combine letters like lj , nj , d\u017e , is a good example . 
  however there could be found alterantives for that , slavs dont have to use the same alphabet western europeans use . 
  for example \u0110 - i am sure there are other unused letters that would suit the lj , nj , d\u017e out there . 
  well , at the time , was there any real difference betwen middle-eastern christianity and islam , i mean , the local culture probably influenced christianity spontaneously so that when islam force arrived they didnt have to change many traditions , etc , so maybe they just didnt care about who ruled them . 
   are you forgetting that the inhabitants of north africa and the levant are coptic , assyrian , nestorian and jacobite christians , sects of christianity considered to be heretical by the catholic church , they had better treatment under the muslims than they did under the byzantines ' there was no catholic church yet . 
  no , i meant , they werent aware of the manipulation and brainwashing done on them ( them-people ) . 
  they were convinced the jews were to blame for all their problems . 
  that is an extreme example , but nazis are famous so its easy to make an example like that . 
  i meant that is how people vote for trump or whatever . 
   law : being stupid and not knowing the rules doesnt protect you from the rules being used on you . 
  which is not okay . 
   falling for populism is your own fault , no matter what . 
  if you elect a populist , you ( as in the society that elects the populist ) deserve what you get , no exceptions . 
  so you would say `` we deserved this , now shut up '' if germans elected a populist ? 
  yes , what it tells about them is that they are being manipulated and brainwashed . 
  take germans in nazi germany for example , they werent aware of it either . 
  alright . 
  then tell me how would you help people ? 
  oh you meant what can i do for it ? 
  what can i do to help people ? 
  show them that they are living in a corrupt country for starters . 
  and that the country doesnt matter , but that individuality matters - in other words what nation you are doesnt matter . 
  well , currently nothing , because governments were not created with that in mind . 
  * to govern * - so , to govern the people of ** the country ** , its all smoke and mirrors . 
  country comes first . 
  and until it is different you can do nothing for people in cases like this . 
  helping people in war - making sure they survive . 
  regardless of losing anything else . 
  i understand your emotionality , nationalism is easy to get under skin . 
  especially in a poor country such as ukraine , russia or ex-yugoslavia countries . 
  but dont let it control you so . 
  the war is being waged for resources , teritory , market and political points . 
  not for the people , from any side . 
  in any war . 
  ever . 
  it just doesnt make sense logically . 
  let me give you another example : aleppo , two idiotic factions destroying a city just to ... what ? , capture its rubbles ? 
  if one wanted to present themselves as the legitimate force and the good guys of the country they just had to withdraw and help people evacuate , show solidarity to the ** people ** .
