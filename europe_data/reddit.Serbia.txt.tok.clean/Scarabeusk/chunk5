  apparently , the serbians are terrified of them . 
  today one must ... chloroform the yugoslavians . 
  but later on one must adopt a politics of deep interest in kosovo . 
  this will help to keep alive in the balkans an irredentist problem which will polarize the attention of the albanians themselves and be a knife at the back of yugoslavia ... '' - galeazzo ciano , mussolini 's son-in-law , the italian minister of foreign affairs , speaking of albanian claims to kosovo as valuable to italy 's objectives . 
  oh , just search it up , its not even hidden , just ignored . 
  edit : `` we should endeavor to ensure that the serb population of kosovo should be removed as soon as possible ... all indigenous serbs who have been living here for centuries should be termed colonialists and as such , via the albanian and italian governments , should be sent to concentration camps in albania . 
  serbian settlers should be killed . '', 
  - mustafa kruja , the then prime minister of albania , june 1942 just a little quote . 
  edit2 : another quote : `` the kosovars are 850,000 albanians , strong of body , firm in spirit , and enthusiastic about the idea of a union with their homeland . 
  apparently , the serbians are terrified of them . 
  today one must ... chloroform the yugoslavians . 
  but later on one must adopt a politics of deep interest in kosovo .

   the albanian populace was extremely repressed for a time . 
  luckily , the belgrade government woke up and started hiring more albanians in public service sector , including the police force . 
  serbian population was repressed from the beginning of ww2 untill autonomy cuts . 
  after ww2 serbs were forbidden from returning to their homes in kosovo from which they escaped during ww2 in the genocide of serbs , jews and other non-albanians that went on there , comitted by albanians and italians . 
   nationalism is cancer . 
  its something the incapable fall back on . 
  what is so special about `` being born '' into a nominal ethnicity ? 
  no one cares , only the idiots , and those that want to slaughter . 
  `` look at me , i did nothing in life , i 'm so proud of my heritage '' try to think for yourself bud . 
  i wish people of yugoslavia who wanted to separate ( aka practicing nationalism ) knew this . 
   why else would milosevic get rid of kosovo 's autonomy in the late 1980s ? 
  how is this action contributing to greater serbia ? 
  all he was doing was getting voting points from the misinformation he spread beforehand . 
   why were places in croatia taken over by extremists ? 
  what extremists ? 
  and this has nothing to do with serbia . 
   why does that cancer known as the r.s. 
  exist today in bosnia ? 
  the world would be better without nationalists . 
  nationalism always leads to violence . 
  serbian nationalism is no exception . 
  you are right . 
  i really wish slovenians , croats and bosniaks didnt go full nationalist , because , just like you said , they caused violence . 
  it was done by special forces police/paramilitaries which were people from previous wars transfered into other organisations like milorad ulemek `` legion '' or just plain criminals like arkan ( their colleagues were fighting on the albanian side too ) . 
  they were mercenaries directed to throw out the illegal forced albanian settlement of kosovo pouring from albania . 
  in fact usa gave milosevic time to finish it , since it would be the end of yugoslavia breakup and its wars . 
  however the psychopaths down there ( both serbian and albanian mercenaries ) went out of control so the plan had to be scraped as the pipeline was planed and they ( usa ) wouldnt let this war disturb it so they went in to finish it themselves . 
  * there were just regular policemen/special forces fighting the terrorist kla though . 
  in this particular case , yeah . 
  i was talking about you having an impression , since it should be obvious to you that usa/russia benefit from these things . 
  i gave an extreme example . 
  you dont say ? 
  can you imagine a war fought for a century , with battles and death each day . 
  a dream come true for world power politicians . 
  all that money from guns !, 
  people in serbia know about this and dont deny it . 
   you give yourself too much credit you mean `` yourselves '' , and its not ourselves , its politicians who participated in the first world war . 
   history showed multiple times that you tried to take all you mentioned for yourself not to help anyone . 
  give me examples , i cant remember those attempts . 
  and again , its not `` us '' and `` you '' , its politicians . 
  i also sometimes use `` you '' , so , sorry about it . 
  it would be let in i guess if this normalisation took place . 
  basically serbia would behave like it does recognize kosovo , and would deal with it like with another country etc. 
  without official recognition on paper . 
  for helping croatia extend its borders to include dalmatia , dubrovnik , istria ( which all would have been taken by italy after ww1 ) , baranja , slavonia . 
  although croatian politicians tried to give it all back to italians by training ustashe in italy ... btw , krajina is named after `` vojna krajina '' the military frontier populated mostly by serbs to guard the border against turks . 
  serbs had a lot of autonomy there , im guessing that is where the hate from croatian side started . 
  they are not radical cetniks . 
  they dont propagate war ideology . 
   if nato removed them you would have some normal people in power . 
  so , who cares about democracy ? 
  though these guys do need to get off power asap :d, 
  it did have a border , and thanks to serbian liberation from austro-hungary , croatias border got extended to include dalmatia and slavonia too . 
  you are welcome . 
  you need help . 
  not joking . 
  just like all those other neonazis on this sub , damir , hrulj etc. 
  `` nato should have gone into srbia and clense it from this radical serb movement . '', 
  i see , the serb , movement . 
  what are the serbs doing in serbia anyway !, 
  `` of course it 's unpopular with serbs '' im not so sure . 
  i give it 50 % -50 % at least on a referendum to recognise kosovo . 
  also something to note , it says here serbia will have to recognise kosovo , which is something eu has repeatedly said will not be a condition for accession ( provided relations are normalised ) . 
  oh , a wikipedia page where it says coat of arms and a picture beneath it . 
  seems legit ... 
  but it didnt work like that . 
  there were no nation states where you were tricked into being proud of a sign of a plunderer from middle ages like everyone is today . 
  back then that was simply assured by feudal law . 
  its not a coat of arms of bosnian kingdom , its coat of arms of kotromanic family . 
  majority of population of bosnia had nothing to do with it , the peasants proably never knew it existed . 
  i find it hypocritical '' its not hypocritical , its stupid . 
  this is a great example of how people think and behave in the balkans . 
  a certain serbian noble family was blood related to the byzantine rulling family that used that cross . 
  i guess when the byzantines got to the edge of being wiped out and , the serb family wanted to be seen as succesors . 
  bulgaria was also devastated . 
  it was the time of turkish conquests of europe . 
  specifically targeting civilians , of course . 
  threat of violence , intimidation , coercion and instilling fear that war will affect the civilian ( `` you '' ) , its all about civilians and who they will vote for/support in a crisis . 
  '' terrorist act - the calculated use of violence ( or ** the threat of violence ** ) against civilians in order to attain goals that are political or religious or ideological in nature ; this is done through ** intimidation or coercion or instilling fear ** . '', 
  sounds like nato to me ... though also sounds like any army that ever existed . 
  specifically targeting civilians . 
  threat of violence , intimidation , coercion and instilling fear that war will affect the civilian ( `` you '' ) , its all about civilians and who they will vote for/support in a crisis . 
  `` i do n't think you have any idea how courts of law function . 
  they rely on evidence ( such as pictures , video clips , pieces of evidence such as skeleton bones , bullets , shell casings ) and on eyewitnesses who are heavily cross-examined to look for any inconsistency in their story and that time period . 
  based on that , this is weighed up with the stories of the defendant and examined another time . 
  upon that , the witness is asked to identify the suspect out of 5 who are chosen . '', 
  - these can all be manipulated .
