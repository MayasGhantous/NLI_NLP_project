  i mean , america doesnt even participate in it !, 
  didnt usa make them release some inmates ? 
  `` the court relies solely on facts and evidence , and has some of the highest qualified lawyers in europe working there . '', 
  none of this matters if a global power doesnt like it . 
  and this court is in the western sphere of influence . 
  `` one ** such ** fact is that the rs army committed the vast majority of war crimes '' - no , you said evidences are the facts , rs army thing is a `` presuda '' ? 
  ( how do you say it in english ? ) unimportant . 
  `` what 's `` blurry '' about 90s ? '', 
  - `` fact is that the rs army committed the vast majority of war crimes , ** which is probably why you dismiss it as political . 
  was it political when it freed seselj , may i ask ? 
  '' ** you still presume , like those young manipulated people in the 90s , that serbs worship chetniks , are chetniks etc. 
  judging from your other comments in the thread also . 
  a person who sees things clearly wouldnt do that . 
  `` one such fact is that the rs army committed the vast majority of war crimes , which is probably why you dismiss it as political . '', 
  - of course , im just a chetnik :d did you even doubt ? 
  the topic of the conversation between me and you is whether you were using whataboutism . 
  now you are using it for the 4th or 5th time . 
  so i guess this conversation is concluded . 
  `` i didnt , stop making things up '' - you said : - `` also lets also forget all those muslims killed in podrinje region by serb royalist chetnik bands . '', 
  - `` and that is excluding other crimes commited in montenegro . '', 
  he was talking about muslims/fake muslims attacking serbs and you started pulling out your papers with the list of serbs attacking muslims . 
  the way you described it doesnt suggest that whataboutism wasnt your primary goal . 
  even in another comment you say : `` so that absolves the serbs of their crimes in ww2 ? '', 
  whataboutism again , even when he is just stating facts , not excuses . 
  you can tell yourself that , repeat it for the rest of your life if you want . 
  but in your heart you know . 
  the court was a political one . 
  and even if we say the court is legit , still doesnt make 90s more than just blurry . 
  besides , a judge and his investigators are not time travelers to go and see what actually happened . 
  its all just guessing based on investigations . 
  so events and facts cant be '' confirmed at '' a court . 
  he was talking about serbian victims and you started saying `` but what about ... '' literally whataboutism . 
  typical for this kind of conversation . 
  `` what about what you did to us ? '', 
  that is actually how this comment chain started . 
  i cant , the amount of manipulation of historical documents in the last half of milenium of balkans is stupidly high . 
  nobody even knows what happened in the 90s !, 
  she is not considering ukraine a country obviously , just a region to be bargained with . 
  and she is not wrong unfortunately . 
  `` but nothing that happened to you is ever able to be questioned ? '', 
  - he never said that . 
  whataboutism . 
  `` one act does not justify the another . '', 
  - where did he say that that ? 
  `` what the croats did to the serbs in ww2 was the same what serbs did to the croats . '', 
  very wrong . 
  part of the indentity is freeing themselves from the slavery under turks , which i dont see anyting wrong with , but part of it is also from medieval `` information '' , for the most part it is neither though . 
  americans had their civil war , other countries had their struggles . 
  all part of their identities . 
  serbian `` nationalism '' ( you are talking about ethnicism ) is built upon being butthurt that their ancestors were too stupid to secure a better country for serbs , and allowed world powers and surounding peoples , like croats , to screw them over . 
  it has nothing to do with treating muslim population badly , in fact , this is proven by the fact that expulsion of albanian from southern serbia during ottoman collapse was all hush hush , and denied . 
  and that anyone today would be too ashamed of it to even consider it being true . 
  so treating bosniaks or albanians badly is certainly not part of serbian identity . 
  if it occurs naturally , then fine , but unfortunately , it is occuring because of bad economy , people want to stay but cant survive , and have easy acccess to hungarian passport , so why not leave , same with romanians , croatians etc. 
  and there are efforts from ( our ) hungarians , for example , to keep traditions alive and have people come back . 
  sorry , nothing then . 
  its late here . 
  and i wouldnt waste my time on a subject like yugoslav wars anyway . 
  i agree . 
  it is sad that people here are so primitive , but it is a fact . 
  so the borders should be rewritten : ** croatian ** majority parts of bosnia and montenegro to croatia , ** serbian ** majority parts of bosnia and montenegro to serbia , montenegro majority parts can choose to stay independent or join serbia . 
  ** bosniak ** majority parts of serbia , montenegro , croatia to bosnia - it would include exclaves , but if a proper agreement is made about free travel i dont see a problem . 
  ** albanian ** majority parts of montenegro , macedonia and serbia to albania ( with kosovo and maceodnian part as autonomous provinces just like vojvodina within albania or majority serbian and macedonian municipalities as exclaves to their countries . ) . 
  also have a free travel agreement among the countries , so people can visit their relatives , that are now in a different country and similar situations . 
  it would work like in the eu , which is where we are all headed anyway . 
  * vojvodina however not to be touched , there was never trouble here and we are not in the balkans . 
  unless we could gain bilaterally agreed independence , that would be neat , although kinda contradictory . 
  could you do a summary ? 
  `` but everyone just dismisses it as propaganda . '', 
  and downvotes it , it seems . 
  because there are serb enclaves deep into kosovo , not just the north . 
  im thinking , creating those special municipalities , recognising kosovo by serbia , some kind of free travel between kosovo and serbia would be the solution . 
  there are also gorani people who want to rejoin serbia but are at the very south part of kosovo . 
  ** also to be noted is that this is actually a fight for natural resources as kosovo is rich with all kinds of minerals and fuels . 
  this is actually the most important part . 
  `` i mean , i 've studied the work a few times over , and it explicitly states that those of the muslim faith are traitors to the montenegrin people and must be killed . '', 
  - that doesnt make it a manual for killing . 
  but yeah , its agressive , meant to rally the people against the sick man of europe , the ottoman empire . 
  '' ** other ** bosniak academics believe it played a key role in milosevic 's ideology . '', 
  other ? 
  are you one yourself ? 
  and it doesnt make sense that it played a role in milosevic ideology , his ideology was just keep yougoslavia as serbia , montenegro and if the bosnian winning side wanted to stay as well . 
  ( which he tried to help with supplies ) dont see much similarity . 
  in fact , milosevic was the only patriot in the whole conflict , every other leader was a nationalist . 
  those are not bad words . 
  just putting it into persperctive . 
  really ? 
  i dont remember a word from it . 
  could be , never read the damn thing . 
  it was not about genocide i would guess though , more about politics , montenegrins wanted the capital of serbia to be podgorica so they were rallying people on their side kinda , and vojvodina * / sumadija were doing their own lobbying for them to be the new center of serbia . 
  that is how petrovici were brakeing up into serbian and montenegrin ones . 
  ** vojvodina * was the actual centre of what could be considered serbia , all the serbian scientist and intelectuals came from here , until tito forbid us from doing anything other than farming . 
  i think you misunderstood what they told you and they are obviously biased . 
  from what i remember at school , gorski vijenac is not recited on school slava . 
  gorski vijenac does say something `` like you traitors of serbian kind blabla '' and when i went to school we analyzed it as any other poem ( or whatever the hell it is ? 
  ) , it was not sung in joy and celebrated . 
  just another poem saying whatever . 
  i guess to muslim children whose parents fill their ears with mythology and history ( which is common in this region for everyone ) it might be noticeable and make them feel bad because their parents made them feel like they are the same people as quoted in gorski vijenac . 
  however , `` ceremonies where orthodox priests call them bastards and filthy degenerates as they quote gorski vijenac at them . '', 
  this sounds like something not even a cheap hollywood movie scriptmaker would make up .
