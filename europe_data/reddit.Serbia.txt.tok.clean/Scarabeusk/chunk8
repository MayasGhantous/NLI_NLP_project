  `` seems pretty cool if you ask me . '', 
  - of course it seems pretty cool to you , you are a serb afterall . 
  ( wait , what the hell am i then ... ), 
  is this sarcasm ? 
  guns are definetly not big in serbia , only people who have them are those who kept it from the war to ... well , just because they could , you know the mentality . 
  `` you dont need to feed it '' . 
  some people have them in their house hidden away in a closet , but its rare , and the taxes are enormous ( personal experience ) . 
  nothing to do with `` military is fairly well embedded in their history/culture/identity due to obvious historical reasons . '', 
  which is also not true ... only ... half ... true ... 
  i was talking loosely , just to give you the idea what i mean , not my like , `` vision '' . 
  also , european union is a country already , so countries inside it dont matter . 
  its like moving to cities from rural areas , and since eu is one country , we all move to germany or france or austria ... 
  that is why the idea of a country is outdated now . 
  people should move where they feel better , if people in bosnia feel bad , push for eu so you get free movement so you can emigrate there , even if its 90 % of people that emigrate . 
  its a new world , countries and borders are an illusion , especially in europe . 
  if you want to not assimilate , you can protect your traditions by remembering them and practicing them . 
  you dont need a country for that . 
  individualism . 
  and why build a country from the ground up when you can move to your capital , which is germany . 
  just like moving from rural to city . 
  i agree with [ u/jtalin ] ( https://www.reddit.com/user/jtalin ) edit : added a sentence at the end . 
  how is america helping israeli apartheid the main reason that israel doesn ` t recognise kosovo ? 
  also , america seems to be going to the side of palestine from now on ... so they are going towards some consistency . 
  well , saying that its disgusting , means you havent gotten used to it yet and are surprised ... now that i hear myself actually ... . 
  i meant being disgusting is part of everyday politics , making up excuses to raise taxes , or take away rights etc. 
  why are you surprised when he says the excuse that he thinks jews would live better there and find out he actually wants them for economy . 
  edited some words . 
  i really cant understand how some of you people haven ` t gotten used to standard politics by now . 
  no offense , honestly wondering . 
  `` ethnic cleansing , the attempt to create ethnically homogeneous geographic areas through the deportation or forcible displacement of persons belonging to particular ethnic groups . 
  ethnic cleansing sometimes involves the removal of all physical vestiges of the targeted group through the destruction of monuments , cemeteries , and houses of worship . '', 
  israel most certainly has committed ethnic cleansing on a massive scale . 
  all dictionaries i could find online define it as so . 
  edit : in fact , the israeli are the true remove kebab meme protagonists . 
  he doesn ` t care where it is best for them , he wants them for economy reasons . 
  have a nice day too mate . 
  i mean ` t. 
  it felt kinda bad to `` rat out '' someone , you know , like tell the police , im sure you heard that phrase in a movie . 
  erm ... `` i ` m not a rat . '', 
  lol, 
  sure , but there are two on the front page right now , one of which was posted after mine . 
  maybe thats why romania didn ` t invade , royalty connections and agreements . 
  didn ` t we get western banat as a gift/sign of goodwill when one of our princes married a romanian princess ? 
  only romanian bros didn ` t annex < 3, 
  i would still have been born in serbia * cries *, 
  with respect , you are wrong imho , its not from old to the young . 
  some young people are like the ones you have in ukraine , you know the types , what the rest of the world knows as `` slavs '' , and i bet they would rather not let crimea go , even though its gone , or sign a deal to give autonomy to east ukraine , just like our young foolish persons . 
  old people just don ` t know what the heck is even going on and live in their imaginary world , they vote for personalities like tito , not policies , and current priminister is an eu personality who they love like russians love putin . 
  and as i can see , at least 40 % of people hate kosovo and metohija , the province , and would rather just hand it over officially and `` please develop serbia , not kosovo '' . 
  which i agree with , since , its starting to feel increasingly like living in kosovo over here ... also , it felt like 2015/2016 russia here for quite some time , yet the eu says there is no censorship or anyhing strangely ... stuff like that is what makes normal young ( not the ones listed above ) persons distrust eu . 
  russia ` s future borders . 
  russia ` s rightful borders - putin . 
  sorry , offtopic : in serbia when the cameras are on they just try to lobby the viewers , don ` t really do anything , just bicker over unimportant stuff like kosovo , nato , russia to get points with viewers . 
  i really wish we didnt have tv transmission . 
  journalists are of course . 
  i meant in the sense of it being part of russia now , under russian control , except illegaly . 
  like , you cant not recognise anexation , independence you can though . 
  i mean , im rambling i know . 
  if they are ukrainian posesions of the state , then to ukraine , of course . 
  although , maybe they should return it to crimean museums if they are part of crimean heritage i mean , yes they are at war , but our olympic main guy whatever , vlade divac , welcomed kosovo entry into olympics for example . 
  it wont change politics or course of war . 
  why wouldnt they be returned to the museums they were borrowed from ? 
  what does this have to do with countries and borders ? 
  crimea is not asking to be recognised as a sovereign state , but part of russia , and i think everyone recognises it as that , hence the `` crimean anexation '', 
  oh boy , you are in for a rude awakening my western friends . 
  unless there is a control mechanism , i am afraid even the `` westernest '' government is abusing everything it can to achieve its goals , you dont throw away profit in business . 
  imho . 
  principles ? 
  that sounds naive to me , but maybe in the west politicians really are not to be mistrusted as here idk ... 
  it was the same in serbia after milosevic , nah , the momentum will just slowly die off as young people leave , and middle aged become old , and the country falls asleep . 
  i ` m sure all the western media the western governments have control over have indeed been instructed . 
  it would be a missed opportunity strategically if not . 
  its because theyre in vojvodina , here the politicians gather ( or used to ) gather votes on multiple ethnicities living in peace . 
  we even have different signs for croatian language , like in the ... news in croatian language ... similar to bosnian three although one language system . 
  also , ijekavica seems to be forced upon them , although they are vojvodjani ... isn ` t ekavica native to croats from vojvodina . 
  just like forcing belgrade serbian to whole of serbia , even some montenegrins are speaking belgrade accent . 
  and ekavica in republika srpska . 
  well some parts of modern croatia were serbian , like southern dalmatia , or are of modern vojvodina was croatian ( although primary hungarian ) . 
  i guess the diferences werent that different in communities between orthodox and catholic , so a lot of croats , slovaks , hungarians accidently have their descendents today think they they were always orthodox serbs , while in dalmatia and herzegovina you have people claiming serbian heritage and celebrating slava , so they accidently found themselves cut off from rest of `` serbs '' and became `` croats '' , differences were still smaller between orthodox and catholic and the regular guy would choose the one with less pressure from the new local church . 
  if people just didn ` t have thus unbased pride in nation , and admited , `` yes my ancestor was albanian , i am serbian because i act like other people in this country , serbia , not because my ancestor was absolutely not an albanian '' but its too shamefull for balkanites . 
  so now saying `` cia '' is not a tin foil comment ... and of course they tried to help , they have a deal , that ` s how politics work , i ` m surprised at how shocked americans all were when hillary emails came out , in serbia , such things and worse abou politicians are common knowledge . 
   also , cultural mindset is no different in ukraine , belarus or romania than in russia . 
  no , ** the kingdom ** changed its name to yugoslavia , so , before the second world war ... 
  it was supposedly one of the reasons croats and slovenes wanted out , because everyone was supposed to become yugoslav instead of serb/croat/slovene . 
   then serbs trickrd croatians into so they tricked just the croatians ? 
  not the slovenes ? 
  were the slovenes part of the trick ? 
  so , what now ? 
  whats next ? 
  ` there has been leaks , where andrej babi\u0161 ( whos owning one of the biggest medias in czech republic ) dictate what those media should write about him and others . 
  ` this is pretty much a standard in eastern and south-eastern europe . 
  its just we rarely get these leaks to trigger people to protest . 
  this is literally the case in serbia , and the reason why there are ongoing protest here too . 
  regenerative/rejuvenative medicine will help ( help prevent ) this . 
  aka longevity/life-extension . 
   it is one thing ** to be pro-serbia ** , and ** it is completely different ** to suppress and persecute people ... . 
  but you told me in the previous comments that the pro-serbia people are the ones supressing and persecuting ( srbomani ) and here now you are telling me its two different things . 
   it is a well known fact in bulgaria . 
  great source . 
   the pro-serbia people in macedonia even have a name in bulgaria - they are referred to as \u0441\u044a\u0440\u0431\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438 .
