  someone does n't spend more than 2 trillion , and get unexpected results . 
  it played out exactly how they wanted it . 
  supporting rebels in syria confirms that they want that whole region unstable . 
  i agree that annexing crimea was illegal , but there were n't any casualties . 
  considering that iraq war was also illegal ( see un stance on that ) and had massive casualties , actions taken against us by international community are none , while towards russia they are enormous , it 's just crazy . 
  so by your standards , 500.000 iraqi deaths ( + funding terrorists in syria , libya etc. 
  etc. ), 
  are parking violation , and annexing crimea is murder ? 
  there certainly would n't be 250k deaths and 3 million refugees in syria alone . 
  it was n't the bombing that sped up the process . 
  in both cases , it 's major arms , logistic and financial support of the rebels . 
  if west did n't meddle at all in those 2 countries they would be fine . 
  yeah , most of them acquired higher education so they could work on the country side . 
  maybe greece should move it 's focus from providing free academic education to providing free courses for picking olives . 
  russian regeneration happened while focused was shifted to middle east . 
  it slowed down with the focus back on them . 
  i do n't see anything wrong with their statement . 
  after stuff like [ this ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/greek-debt-crisis-german-plan-for-greece-would-see-50bn-of-state-assets-managed-by-external-fund-10383276.html ) i do n't think that people should be worried with russia dealing with greece , as it seems that germany is soon to annex it . 
  although they disliked the englishmen for their ` stuck-upness ' , they surely reached similar levels of it . 
  yep , pretty good ultimatum if you ask me . 
  and there were un officers to back it up . 
  but they chose not to , and he took that pretty badly . 
  i 'm aware of that , but it 's a revenge of a group of people . 
  there is no mindset in serbia that called for such a thing , and was totally isolated incident . 
  serbia is getting a lot of labels , while it should n't . 
  people were unaware of what was going on there . 
  if city has 20 million tourists , i 'm sure they could find cash to build more public restrooms . 
  it 's a nice idea , but c'mon , just build those restrooms . 
  it was certain that they would be slaughtered . 
  bosniaks used guerrilla tactics , and they fought against much stronger force . 
  their numbers were large ( 110,000 troops + 100,000 reserves ) but weakly armed ( almost no heavy guns ) . 
  taking that into account , general mladic , because of those tactics and large numbers , was unable to resolve things differently ( with his abilities ) . 
  couple days before genocide he asked them to lay down their arms and he would let them go . 
  only requirement is for them to give up all their arms . 
  well , you know the rest . 
  they refused , and he found it suitable to enter srebrenica and to kill all men of military age . 
  exactly . 
  nazys for example , they had a clear agenda : kill all jews because they are like this and that . 
  and they had that agenda even before the war . 
  but in case of srebrenica , that was not the case . 
  it was a response after some crime . 
  it was n't a planned hatred , it was a isolated incident ( revenge ) . 
  you wo n't find ` credible ' source . 
  serbs are to blame , and no one else . 
  3500 ~ ~ thousand ~ ~ serb civilians around srebrenica killed themselves . 
  they [ were informed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81-2vkpitnm ) . 
  uk , us and france knew , and wanted it to happen so they could have public support and legal means to roll on serbia . 
  thanks, 
  i 'm not trying to justify , it was a genocide . 
  i 'm trying to point out that it was a response to bosniaks killing of serbian civilians . 
  meaning that both sides committed atrocities , while only one side is being prosecuted . 
  while only one side is to blame , we will never have conciliation . 
  there were around 3000 serb civilians killed around srebrenica . 
  is killing 3000 innocent farmers a genocide or not ? 
  yep , it 's meeting . 
  the fact that bosniak 's never killed 8,000 serbs is just because they did n't have means to do it , not because they did n't want to . 
  i 'm not justifying the genocide , it did take place , but if we want to live in peace one day , all sides have to be judged for their crimes . 
  again , i 'm not justifying , but pointing out that it was a reaction , meaning that bosniaks committed crimes too . 
  crimes they were never prosecuted for . 
  ( in my book , just because crimes against serbs were scattered around nearby villages does n't mean it was n't a genocide ) that way the conciliation will never be reached . 
  i did say it was a matter of revenge , revenge against civilians too . 
  do n't get me wrong , it was an execution . 
  ( though you confirm there were 20 % soldiers , in so called ` demilitarized zone ' , meaning the battle took place too ) . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that this is isolated incident , incident caused by bosniak actions . 
  this did n't happen because of some major view of serbs against bosniaks , not because us serbs being evil and whatnot . 
  this was purely action -  response . 
  bosniaks killed serb civilians -  serbs kill bosniak civilians . 
  but keep in mind that serbs attacked armed village , while bosniaks killed mostly unarmed farmers in their homes . 
  just take a [ look at what they did ] ( http://4international.me/2008/02/15/the-real-srebrenica-genocide-the-mass-murder-of-serbs-in-srebrenica-and-gorazde/ ) . 
  scroll to bottom if you have stomach for it . 
  [ just couple days before srebrenica ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81-2vkpitnm ), 
  if you knew you are surrounded , and you have many civilians with you , what would be your response to [ this proposal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81-2vkpitnm ) ? 
  there are more instances of bosniak actions against serbs . 
  [ link1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6smorhrzwpy ) [ link2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v36lhff-ni ) . 
  and many many more , so please do n't make it look like we had some national agenda to kill all muslims , it was never about that . 
  srebrenica was a response to muslims slaughtering serbs like [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oohdhm1mcc ) it 's not like we had agenda to kill all muslims like nazis had with jews and slavs . 
  you people make us worse than nazis , get a hold of yourselves . 
  it 's was a simple matter of revenge . 
  i never thought i 'll read something like this from a turk . 
  c'mon man , you have your own genocides to worry about . 
  i 'm sorry , but my brain froze after reading your comment . 
  so you 're condemning genocide , but openly call for action against serbs in ` next ' war ? 
  just remember that around 4000 serb civilians got killed in that war . 
  no one is talking about them . 
  but someone killed them for sure . 
  i guess you think bosniaks did n't do it ? 
  source is someone from [ bosniak ranks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ibran_mustafi%c4%87 ), 
  you know , default is not the end of the world . 
  greece certainly have lived through it 's share of defaults . 
  do n't forget that netherlands is bottomless pit too . 
  of course it is , only russia is imposing sanctions onto finland , but whole of eu and us are imposing sanctions onto russia . 
  but the point is that russia 's sanctions towards finland are not in vain . 
  it certainly seems that it 's [ working . 
  ] ( http://yle.fi/uutiset/russian_forestry_sanctions_a_severe_blow_to_finland_industry_warns/8128848 ), 
  do n't cut the info , average pension in western germany is 1,576 euros , and 1,303 euros in eastern germany . 
  it 's from the article you sent , do n't try to fool people . 
  also , you were under iron curtain , that 's why your gdp is low . 
  do n't compare romania with greece . 
  working population of greece is around 4 million . 
  saying that they hid 28 billion euros means , average greek evaded around 7000 euros a year .
