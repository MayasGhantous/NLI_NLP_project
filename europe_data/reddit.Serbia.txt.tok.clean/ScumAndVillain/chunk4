  that 's just ridiculous . 
  and please do n't believe those shock doctrine inventors from chicago . 
  take a look at [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_involvement_in_the_syrian_civil_war ) . 
  check who is supporting legitimate government , and who is arming the ` rebels ' . 
  you can do the same for tunis and libya . 
  iraq invasion is very well known as well as it 's legitimacy and success . 
  so what , most people there probably think `` good , we do n't need foreigners here ! '' . 
  15th century retards . 
  only zealot i 'm seeing here is you . 
  my street has more people walking on saturday . 
  i 'm sad seeing most people do n't realize that those people are running from a conflict west created . 
  one day it 's : `` poor syrians need our m16 's '' , other day is `` those scum syrian immigrants < insert action  '', 
  if some of you guys would like to die in balkans , at least die from head injury [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6g5q6y-r_a ) . 
  [ rafting ] ( http://www.raftingtara.com/ ), 
  something along the lines that it 's ` regular balkan thing ' . 
  [ lazarat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lazarat ) for example . 
  regular police ca n't do anything there . 
  if albania has to do something there , they have to deploy special forces . 
  just a week earlier , they killed albanian nato special forces solider . 
  albania is the only country in the region that is lawless and has militant gangs . 
  they even have villages where police ca n't show up without being fired upon with mortar shells and gunfire . 
  but do n't attribute that to whole of balkans , that 's just not true . 
  you can visit villages of serbia and montenegro , and you 'll be offered rakia and food . 
  yeah right . 
  when [ this ] ( http://www.english.rfi.fr/europe/20150314-three-french-citizens-held-kidnapping-girl-serbia ) happened i should 've blamed all french people ? 
  personally , raising retirement age to 67 and reducing pensions is not what i would call a reform . 
  is this your fault ? 
   sept. 15 ( bloomberg ) -- the netherlands will not reach its eu-deficit target in 2014 despite 6 billion euros ( $ 8 billion ) of additional austerity measures . 
  the budget deficit will hit 3.3 percent of gross domestic product in 2014 , the hague-based government 's planning agency cpb said today . 
  he wanted everything ? 
  what does that mean ? 
  i 'm starting to feel like that the best solution for `` yes - no '' is a game of `` eeny , meeny , miny , moe '' . 
  yep , it exists : `` bojkot '' . 
  yep , thanks . 
  their debt is around 177 % , it was 100 % less than 10 years ago . 
  [ timeline ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/government-debt-to-gdp ) . 
  whether we join eu or not , i think similar ~ ~ faith ~ ~ fate awaits us too . 
  just give us 8-12 years . 
  as our debt is around 80 % and raising every year , i do n't see how we 're going to have different faith than greeks . 
  goods find their way to russia . 
  for example , serbia do n't have a ban for exporting to russia , so many eu countries ( poland , france and spain that i heard of ) are exporting to russia through serbia . 
  i 'm not entirely sure what are you trying to say with that post . 
  your comment would be much appreciated . 
  as if someone wanted that horrible thing to happen . 
  more info on [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organ_theft_in_kosovo ) . 
  i really hope this case comes to some international court , and people involved get prosecuted . 
  this level of monstrosity should concern everyone , not just us serbs . 
  just a thought that those people are walking around freely is heartbreaking . 
  edit : gist is [ leaked documents part ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organ_theft_in_kosovo#leaked_documents ), 
   because of a civil war between sunni and shia muslims . 
  which us invasion did n't help in any way . 
  / s and invasion is based of what ? 
  saddam killing kurds ? 
  turkey plans to attack them , and they 're nato . 
  not to mention that there are now much greater threats than saddam was . 
  not calling it fiasco with a straight face is just ludacris . 
  depends which countries you look at . 
  bosnia and kosovo ( and to some extent macedonia ) are pretty much at the bottom . 
  serbia and montenegro are in better shape , but in free-fall too ( maybe a bit slower , with a half-opened parachute ) . 
  it 's interesting how russia is threat to nato , while russia is matching nato 's forces , not the other way around . 
  actually , i formed my opinion from the talk i had with your countryman . 
  i do n't have anything against turks , while you seem to have something against serbs , oh well , i 'm used to it , no hard feelings . 
  exactly , 3 million without visa-free travel . 
  imagine how many more with it . 
  and no , i 'm not being racist , just an observation . 
  time will tell , you 'll see . 
  good look with allowing turkey and kosovo people to travel freely . 
  humvees are built by same companies which produce arms , and i 'm implying that military complexes on both sides are the only ones profiting from ukrainian conflict . 
  not sure why you mention ` offensive ' weapons ? 
  are you throwing moral into context of international politics ? 
  i said through taxes , not individually . 
  there 's huge amount of arms involved in ukraine , so even if us/russia have n't sold them directly , someone did in fact payed for them . 
  depends how you look at it . 
  us citizens bought arms through taxes and gifted them to ukraine . 
  same on the russia 's side . 
  only ones gaining are military complexes . 
  yeez , it could easily pass as a graph of average temperatures . 
  looking at his bio and considering he worked at bbc , i think it 's better to check if he 's kiddie fiddler first . 
  is n't evil what makes us human ? 
  as in only humans are capable of it ? 
  that sums it up . 
  bitch please , serbs are oldest nation in the universe . 
  eh , got an iphone recently ? 
  my username is a star wars reference . 
  did i offended you somehow ? 
  worse !? 
  have you tried it ? 
  c'mon man , onion + kajmaj + 10 cevapi = = bliss , 
  kind of , we put kajmak , 
  there were thousands of people involved in a scheme , yet western media used putin 's image as cover for that news . 
  mr. cameron inserted his dick into pigs mouth , 
  montenegro has such a high sexual freedom only if 100k dutch tourists visit , these stats are a joke . 
  oh , my bad . 
  now , do you know what croatia lost after ww2 ? 
  they were allowed , but did n't want to lay down their weapons . 
  whoa , what an unbeatable proof you have there . 
  fyi germany was aggressor in ww2 , while serbia lost everything in ww1 and ww2 . 
  speaking of germany , i do n't see they lost anything . 
  they killed everyone that could 've been a * fighter * not a * muslim * . 
  there 's a big difference .
