just looked it up : their minimum wage ( 2570 dirhams/235 euro ) is actually higher than ours ( 21296 dinars/173 euro ) and they have a lower unemployment rate ( 10,1 vs 16,7 % ) . 
  370 $ is the official average salary severely inflated by public sector ( where you ca n't get a job without bribes , cousins or good friends already working there ) . 
   when asked about bad conditions that workers of the korean yura company in serbia are enduring , despite the company receiving fdi subsidies from our state , vu\u010di\u0107 [ prime minister ] said that the problem , if one exists , should be reported to the company 's management because talking about it in the media hurts the country 's image . 
  as he explained , these sort of things might scare off new investors , and he just recently asked korean ambassador to bring samsung and some other companies to serbia .

  i really do n't know if that 's the standard practice around the world or just a serbian thing . 
  but the media are starting to report about the one vote thing so the calculation above is correct . 
  total of all votes . 
  if they counted only the valid votes ( 3,659,804 ) , dveri would be at 5,15 % . 
  i have a feeling this is his personal `` fuck you , i can do whatever i want '' to the opposition . 
  for those who do n't speak serbian : number of votes in ballot boxes : 3,767,594 number of other votes : 3101 total : 3,770,695 dveri : 188,534 votes or 4.999980109767563 % dveri + 1 vote : 188,535 or 5.000006630077479 %, 
  and his pathetic monologues , and internet shills a la putin style , and changing definitions to lower the unemployment and raise the foreign investment rates , and additional 10 billion euros in debt in 4 years , and lowering the pensions , and treating the trashy pink tv as national service , and his media stunts where a little kid freezes in cold waiting for vucic to come in a helicopter together with photographers and save him ... 
  not everyone , just us on the internet and it 's mostly because [ his lips ] ( https://i.imgur.com/llmraho.jpg ) remind us of the pussy we ca n't get . 
  not really , no . 
  i think they 're somewhere in the center of political spectrum with a handful of right wingers , who are very well accepted . 
  radulovic is similar to bernie in the sense that they 're constantly circlejerking about him and he 's seen as an alternative to the establishment , but he 's not a leftist either . 
   they will affect whether serbia will lean towards eu membership or a closer cooperation with russia . 
  the current government coalition is expected to get more than 65 % of the votes , with prime minister 's party at 53 % . 
  also his head is perpetually stuck in merkel 's asshole ( he said something like he 'd defend her approach to refugee crisis even if he was the last man doing it ) so we definitely wo n't be changing the course . 
  pro-russian parties all combined wo n't get more than 20 % . 
  these are the least interesting elections ever that wo n't change anything except maybe push / r/serbia to organize a gay orgy if radule ( serbian bernie sanders ) gets 5 % of the votes . 
  no , it is n't . 
  no one 's talking about eu at all . 
  the focus is on god-king aleksandar vu\u010di\u0107 and ( failed ) attempts at forming a coallition to take him down . 
  what is it like being a gay over there ? 
  i know serbs from bosnia are a whole lot more ( socially ) conservative and we 're pretty bad as is . 
   number of people diagnosed with hiv infection during 2015 is 37 % larger than in 2014 ( 178 vs. 130 ) and the largest since 1987 . 
  among the newly discovered cases in 2015 , the majority were men ( 173 , and 5 women ) , while more than a third of all cases was found among younger population aged 15-29 ( 66 cases or 37 % ) . 
  like in the previous years the most common way of hiv transmission was unprotected anal sex between men ( 129 cases or 73 % ) followed by sexual intercourses with members of opposite gender ( 27 cases or 15 % ) . 
  i do n't know why is it so bad here . 
  no , the official minimum wage is a whopping 172 euros . 
  in croatia 413 and bosnia , country that had a fucking total war , 209 . 
  fuck this . 
  but then look at your northern neighbor former yugoslav republic and rightful bulgarian clay of macedonia with 131 . 
  i 'm surprised they 're not all over your country already . 
  hopefully not serbia . 
  that 's what i meant . 
  why is the electric part of the electricity price so high in the uk ? 
  why is electricity so expensive in gb and bvlgaria ? 
  it obviously has some relation with being an island but that does n't explain bulgaria , unless they 're paying gypsies to pedal bike electricity generators . 
  how come you guys never get bored of these news ? 
  i do n't see the fun in tracking every single habib heading to germany . 
  they 're wandering around , pissing , pooping , eating ajvar , waiting for bulgarians to let them through ... 
  same shit every day . 
  and same news every day . 
  austria will close this border , slovenia will close that border , croatia will react to previous closures , serbia repeats it wo n't be a dumping ground , macedonia talks some shit because they feel important , stage 12/1859 of calais camp deconstruction in progress , orban blabs about some cultural crap , poles say their hail marys and blab about some religious crap , estonia plays the soviet oppression card again ... bleh, 
  i do n't think death is something to joke about . 
  especially if it occurred 2 hours ago . 
  haha of course . 
   most condoms are sold in novi pazar where did you get that ? 
  they 're in every drug store and near the checkout in all bigger supermarkets . 
  i would n't know how much they cost because i 'm a redditor but sometimes when i 'm waiting for my turn in supermarket and need to awkwardly stare at something , i check the condoms and the standard pack ( 12 pcs ) seems to be generally between 600 and 800 dinars ( 5-7 euros ) which is a lot for irresponsible teenagers . 
  one condom costs the same as one ice cream . 
  would you rather lick a condom or an ice cream ? 
  [ the wolf changes his hair , but not his nature . 
  with the exception of londonistan , most of them got there because they opposed france , a country with a major empire complex that has to feel important . 
  because they mostly want to suck dick for euros . 
  perfect example why small countries with weak economies should n't be in the eu . 
  just like croatia and lithuania , we would n't have the right to our own opinion . 
  we would have to vote as the western overlords say . 
  what is you relation with them like ? 
  i know you have more russian speakers than we do and your cyrillic is more similar ( identical ? ), 
  to theirs . 
  you even have the backwards r. 
  me too . 
  i do n't want us to become german wage slaves . 
  economic success and high living standard are attainable without the eu . 
  it might take longer but freedom has no price . 
  exactly . 
  you 're worthy of my love . 
  i love you factual , punctual , mountain serbs . 
  yes , i 'm looking forward to the day when the rest of europe joins serbia . 
  [ `` unlike montenegro , serbia ca n't be played with '' ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=12&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_id=96489 )  the serbian president told sputnik that montenegro `` should not be compared to serbia - which has its own interests , rights and centuries-old friendships . '', 
   `` montenegro has opted for membership in eu and nato , but also for open conflicts and misunderstandings with everyone with whom these organizations are in conflict - that is , for membership without identity and autonomy , '' nikolic said of the neighboring country . 
  that 's why you moved to canada  but a lot of people living here have a strange obsession with russia . 
  according to a [ survey from october ] ( http://www.rtv.rs/sr_lat/politika/istrazivanje-podrska-vucicu-rusiji-i-ulasku-u-eu_650756.html ) this year 67 % hold a positive opinion of russia , 43 % of germany and 33 % eu ( but the support for joining the union is at 57 % ) . 
  the original title is hard to translate but here are the relevant quotes :  a man can have friends around the world , but [ in times of need ] he 'll always remember his mother first , and in the same way serbia , whenever it needs help , first remembers the russian federation , and throughout the history that help always arrived . 
  and  `` it is certain that we will cooperate with russia more than before because we 're against introducing sanctions and we want to show our friends from europe that being in the european union does n't equal being against russia and that being a friend of russia does n't equal being against the european union '' , said nikolic after a meeting with lavrov . 
  sorry bestonia but i do n't think he cares much about your feelings . 
  it 's uh . . nonsensical . 
  i submitted it for the silly dance but here are some lyrics : russia , mother , we do n't have it easy we 're of your blood and your heart putin is mother , putin is power putin is everything , putin is god on the east the day shines with happiness in peterburg a white bear has been born russia , the mother , chooses him the holy name of putin vladimir born when the mother needed him controls the land , as well as the sky _______ he shoots them all that is putin , air-land ... 
  he has the look of steel he parades from the red square he loves his mother with his lion heart with russia protecting orthodoxy every word of his shines his intellect crushes everything he wishes the world happiness and peace that is putin vladimir, 
  pr stunt by lord vucic , intended for the sheep who believe he 's jesus hristos ' reincarnation . 
  i think [ this quote ] ( http://bulevar.b92.net/srpska-posla.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=12&amp;dd=02&amp;nav_id=1069654 ) of his tells all about his reasons for the visit :  there 's a lot of people in america who do n't appreciate my friendship with vladimir putin , as well as that with serbia , but that wo n't change anything . 
  because of my friendship with the russian president i 've had , and still have , many problems '' i guess rubles and dinars are as good as dollars . 
   together with poland , the baltic trio -- estonia , latvia and lithuania -- are proponents of exercising the utmost firmness regarding the kremlin . 
  they also fear that the conflicts in syria and ukraine will be lumped together . 
  `` these are different crises and we must not link them , we must assess them separately , '' lithuanian foreign minister linas linkevicius told afp . 
  `` it is unacceptable to talk about some kind of trade , concessions or spheres of influence . '', 
   `` lithuania will not take part in any new coalition in which russia will participate or would like to participate , '' president dalia grybauskaite said friday . 
  `` to this day russia is occupying the territory of one country and committing acts of war in two countries , ukraine and georgia , '' she added in the western resort town of palanga after meeting with her baltic counterparts . 
   the latvian foreign ministry for its part said friday that `` the baltic countries should continue to constantly remind the world about the illegal annexation of crimea . '', 
  `` the fight against terrorists and resolving the conflict in syria should not be at the expense of ukraine . '', 
  it 's probably related to the [ dispute over carinthia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austro-slovene_conflict_in_carinthia ) :  in the aftermath of the first world war , there was an austro-slovene conflict in carinthia in which ethnic slovenes and ethnic germans ( austrians ) fought for control of the linguistically mixed region between styria and carinthia . 
  the slovenes were loyal to the newly formed kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenes ( later yugoslavia ) , while the austrians were loyal to the newly proclaimed republic of german austria . 
  the disputed territory had belonged to the austro-hungarian empire . 
  at the centre of conflict was the position of the border that separated the two new states . 
  since belgrade was the capital of the newly formed slavic kingdom , serbian soldiers most likely participated in that conflict and that 's probably where the austrians stopped them .
