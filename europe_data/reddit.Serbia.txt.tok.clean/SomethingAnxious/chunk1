montenegrin language ... lol , that 's a good one . 
  wahhabism has been on the rise in the balkans for a long time already . 
  nationalism has nothing to do with it . 
  it is actually , but only considering wages . 
  our unemployment rate is lower , so both countries are far from being paradise  on the other hand croatia is doing much better : [ http://www.dzs.hr/default_e.htm] ( http://www.dzs.hr/default_e.htm ) ` the average monthly paid off net earning per person in paid employment in legal entities of the republic of croatia for june 2016 amounted to 5 686 kuna ( 745.60 eur ) ', 
  if i go to the sources trading economics used ( statistical office of the republic of serbia ; federal office of statistics , federation of bosnia and herzegovina ) , the numbers are different : serbia : [ http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/website/public/pageview.aspx?pkey=2] ( http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/website/public/pageview.aspx?pkey=2 ) average net salary : 46 280 din = 368.32 euros bosnia : [ http://fzs.ba/] ( http://fzs.ba/ ) average net salary : 834 km = 418.67 euros,

  learn to check primary sources next time . 
  this thread would n't even have 50 replies if it was n't for all the bullshit he posted . 
  you are lying : [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) the difference is minimal . 
  as the person in charge of us foreign policy she had a key role in launching the intervention . 
  she openly stated that she has no regrets and that it was the right thing to do ... basically her opinion about the approach the us should take in that region remains unchanged which is why i 'm against her . 
  if she gets elected , every bad thing that happened back then will happen again and considering the complicated present day situation , the consequences will be much worse . 
  i was n't talking about that embassy incident ( quite a coincidence that you are mentioning this , since i wached the movie very recently ) , but about her pivotal role in inciting the totally unnecessary intervention which left the whole country in turmoil to this day and whose results facilitated even more chaos and terrorism in the entire middle east . 
  thousands of people died or were left without homes for nothing . 
  hillary already proved her ` skills ' in lybia and she was only a secratary of state back then . 
  with the situation in the middle east as tense as it is today , the last thing we need is somebody like her . 
  and i 'd endure a wall being built on one border than see the world plagued by even more war and destruction . 
  in stead of worrying about us serbs and downvoting my posts , you should probably look into your own affairs . 
  terrorists butcher your countrymen every month and you console yourself by trying to demonstrate superiority over a country and region you barely know anything about . 
  pathetic, 
  most people in these parts who go abroad and come back flaunting fancy cars and other stuff actually do work construction . 
  i was surprised too , but it seems too pay quite well . 
  then i 'd rather go with the side that does n't have arrogant douchebags such as yourself, 
  * hundreds of thousands * of people ? 
  it 's a miracle you did n't pin the extinction of the dinosaurs on us . 
  no matter , your crank scientist will surely find a way sooner or later . 
  we do n't want you or russia . 
  you should all stop interfering in balkan affairs already . 
  because voting for crooked hillary is such a smart move ... 
  do n't forget about king peter i, 
  we ca n't really do anything against him since he 's an american puppet . 
  only once they get tired of him , he 'll be overthrown . 
  so why the hell are you hypocritical cunts always denying that ? 
   the other opportunities are guys like seselj who would turn serbia into a nationalistic shithole . 
  thanks for worrying , but we wo n't turn into croatia , 
  in serbia 172 cm is the average for 13-year-old boys and living fossils . 
  this ` investigation ' makes 0 sense , even their source , wikipedia , shows completely different data . 
  makes you wonder whether these mistakes were intentional or not . 
  and ecauador as well , apparently . 
  unbelievable, 
  he is a troll . 
  he 's from bosnia and he knew what the slogan meant all along . 
  he 's just trying to shit on serbia some more . 
  there are protests in south africa too . 
  the were 800 000 more registered voters than the total amount of citizens eligable to vote and many sns activists went around literally buying votes . 
  he would 've won regardless , but if things were fair , there would have been a second round . 
  it 's the fifth day . 
  the protests started in belgrade on monday . 
  i 'm talking about the comments in this thread . 
  that 's what ` itt ' stands for ... 
  the hungarian foreign affairs minister was at his rally and has expressed his support to vucic many times as well . 
  oh well , at least he 's not on good terms with trump . 
  it reminds me of that south park episode . 
  the one with the annoying bikers , 
  it did n't seem that low to me neither when i was there . 
  you 're definitely shorter than us , but not by this much . 
  the medical exams here involve you basically stripping down to your underwear so the measurement of height and weight would be the most accurate . 
  every health center that performs check ups on school and uni students does that . 
  people tend to overestimate themselves , but i agree with you it would n't add more than 2 cm on average ( basically the diff between the measured and self rep. stats in some countries ) . 
  i 'm not sure what you wanted to say in the last paragraph . 
  the balkans , especially serbia and bosnia do n't get many tourists . 
  the ones that do usually describe the people here as very tall ( that 's actually how i first learned we were tall as a kid , lol ) . 
  not to mention all the successful athletes , especially basketball players that this small region always had . 
  also , the rich , germanic people like to visit more exotic locations , where people are obviously shorter than average , that 's why to them ( or you :p ) it seems they tower over the entire world . 
  nobody really knows anything about the balkans other than war and poverty . 
  that 's why it 's difficult for people to believe a bunch of ` barbarians ' are not actually physically inferior to them . 
  and the average in serbia is not 185 , it 's 182 and 180,6 in another , though older , measured survey, 
  that 's why i said samples are problematic . 
  they are n't far away from the truth , but there 's room for error . 
  and these numbers are n't collected from ` odd jobs ' . 
  for example , the balkan ones are based mostly on students . 
  it 's definitely more accurate than self-reported stats though , most people do n't know their exact height so they give an arbitrary number . 
  from what i can see , the only problem here is that the people measured in the netherlands for the data that was used here were teens , some of whom were n't done growing so the calculted average is not as high as the one in real life . 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  you germanic folk are n't the only tall people in the world , jesus ... 
  i ca n't find this anywhere . 
  where did you dig this up ? 
  he listed all the * measured * , not self-reported averages he could find . 
  though it probably is more like 182-183 , but that 's the problem with using samples . 
  he , not she . 
  and there 's no way he can get even 1 % , he barely got enough signatures to be even accepted as a candidate . 
  kanye 's an egoistic asshole , this guy is just mocking the corrupt political scene . 
  they were n't mercenaries . 
  emir umur of aydin was an old ally of kantakouzenos and he ( kantakouz . ), 
  struck an allegiance with orhan by sending his daughter to the sultan 's harem ( that 's a first too as far as i can telll ) . 
  kantekouzenos was simply too powerhungry and he did n't realise the implications his greed would have on the whole of history . 
  it was weakened quite a while ago actually . 
  serbs were just one of the factors . 
  there were also three other civil wars in the 20s ( and if i recally correctly there was one in the 70s as well when john v and manuel ii were overtrown ) which also contributed greatly to the latter serbian conquests . 
  not to mention that the turks already conquered all of asia minor other than a few cities . 
  epirus and thessaly were also unstable regions which were added to the empire as late as the 30s . 
  i did n't say he ordered them to take gallipoli , just that his actions led to that event . 
  he was the first person to invite a turkish army to cross the aegean and he allowed the ottomans to plunder thrace . 
  they even destoryed dusan 's army in battle . 
  all that made them realise that these territories were easy pickings . 
  incorrect . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantine_civil_war_of_1341%e2%80%931347 dusan and kantakouzenos simply parted ways . 
  and kantakouzenos was the one who originally sought dusan 's help in the first place . 
  though i agree constantinople was bound to fall .
