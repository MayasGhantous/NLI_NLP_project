[ balkan never disappoints !, 
  what 's that europe ? 
  wait , wait wait wait a minute ... europeans are using serbian 50 dinars bill for snorting cocaine ? 
  oh please ... people here are so friendly towards ( western ) foreigners and are trying so much to impress them - that i 'm sometimes almost annoyed by that , thinking `` why ca n't you assholes be like this to your own fellow people like you 're to foreigners that you see for the first time in your life ?! '', 
  there are many possible reasons for your situation that has happend . 
  most probable one : your host simply did n't know english language , and was irritated in conversation with you for not understanding each other or something in these lines . 
  that same thing happens in italy all the time for example , should i now say that italians are refusing service because i 'm ** x ** ? 
   we barely benefit from having an ally in kosovo . 
  except for a huge base - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/camp_bondsteel and [ natural resources ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural_resources_of_kosovo ) exploited by foreign western companies . 
  good luck . 
  lol k, 
  no they ca n't . 
  and not one is there to stay . 
  ahahahaha bro , in every possible situation we 're both trying our best to think of how to stick it to the other one as deepest as possible . 
  screw syrians , even if aliens have landed on earth , while the world would be in awe/shock , serbs would be like - ok , cool , but how can we spin this to fuck with the croats ? 
  and vice versa . 
  call me stupid , but is n't scarcity supposed to increase the value/price ? 
  nah , it 's fine , they 're eagles . 
  they could just fly their goods over the border , lol . 
  c'mon bro , do n't be like that . 
  you guys are eagles , you can handle it , lol . 
  you ca n't claim us , we live here !, 
   serbian minister of labor and social affairs , aleksandar vulin , is present on the border and is asking the migrants to get into buses that will take them to the serbian-croatian border . 
  a few hundred people started to walk away from the crossing point . 
  i like it that in every possible situation serbia is trying to figure out how to stick it to the croats as much as possible . 
  even if aliens land and attack the earth , serbs would be like ... [ * okay , cool , but how can we spin this to fuck with croats . 
  could you try not being butthurt all the time and take something as a joke ? 
  serbs are motherfucking starks . 
  wolf themes , stubborn and pumped with blinding honour and too stupid for foreign politics . 
  or any politics really . 
  ** edit : ** croatians are greyjoys , located on sea , when it 's cool they 're cool when it 's bad they turn to pussies and ca n't wait to fuck starks over and stab them in the back . 
  albanians are primitive wildlings , made from tribes , always stealing land and trying to take more of it from starks . 
  kosovo is the wall . 
  bosnians are baratheons obviously . 
  [ three constituent ethnic groups ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_groups_in_bosnia_and_herzegovina ) in bosnia are three baratheon brothers . 
  robert is a serb , he 's fat and loud , kinda stubborn and hedonistic . 
  renly is a croat , kinda faggy and thinks he 's better than else . 
  stannis is a bosniak , denounced his own religion and took a new one from the east . 
  montenegro is the vale of arryn , related to serbs/starks , high in mountains , unconquered , weird family relations , bird on a flag . 
  slovenians are tyrells , rich country with resources and everything , no one really gives a fuck about them . 
  macedonia is dorne , located on south , sun as a symbol , they 're here but no one notices them ever . 
  targaryens are kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty , they once rulled all of the [ balkan westeros ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_yugoslavia ) , now a royal family in exile . 
  and lastly . 
  europe is the lanisters . 
  morally corrupted capitalistic west , rich with all the money , incestuous and always trying to oppress serb starks :'( keeps them in hague as prisoners in dungeons and runs irregular fake-ass trials only to take power from serb starks , i cri evrytiem ... 
  i have higher hopes for the railway . 
   only 20 million people entered who knows how many were stopped because of that border . 
  we could be talking about hundreds of people here . 
  worth it . 
  this is so much fail . 
  it was made of serb cadres , because the bosnia itself was made of serbs and croats . 
  it would be really stupid if it was `` dominated regime '' made of tanzanian cadres and swahili people . 
  second , the people in cadre had serbian background , and that did n't mean shit . 
  it just happened that they do . 
  ( again , no tanzanian people were living there , serbs were your first choice ) no one really identified or expressed their nationality during those times , it was both forbiden by a communist party ( or at least shunned upon ) and unwanted by people itself ( otherwise , they would n't be in a governing party ) . 
  neither serbs , croats , or people that only in your retarded mind are for some reason now supposed to identify themselves as some term from a few centuries ago , bosniaks ( yes , again , the term itself existed , please stop linking me etymology websites as some huge discovery and revelation ) . 
  so if serbs did n't do it , if croats did n't do it , and they expresed themselves as yugoslavians ( you know , yugoslavia , the country they formed together , not some serbian terror oppressive regime , lol ) , why the hell would these people have such business , especially in those times ? 
  here you have 2 groups who are avoding previous nationalism at all cost , and you expect from a third group to discover and wave their so far nonexistent nationality . 
  ( mostly because they were simply serbs , or croats , with muslim religion , which brings us back to the roots of this thread and / u/crnaruka ) it 's like you have 2 people who are trying as best to keep a low profile , and a third guy next to them is having a huge rave party . 
  so , no . 
  it does n't have anything to do with serbs allowing anything . 
  it has to do with a communist party , ideology and political climate at the time . 
  third , the author of that book that you 're flashing , roland kosti\u0107 ( ?!, 
  i can only imagine what 's his agenda , lol ) has pretty much failed to provide a quality academic source . 
  in only one paragraph he 's talking about 1960s and 1990s like it 's 2 days apart , and not like 40-50 years and all the stuff that has changed in that time period . 
  really ? 
  who was n't allowing this ? 
  i 'm not familiar with serbian regime . 
  [ basically , how it all happened . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lexu2qx.png ) [ \\ [ turn on for dramatic reading \\ ] ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwug8kkipa0 ), 
  yes , the term bosniak itself existed before . 
  lol . 
  it was n't made over one drunken night . 
  also from your own sources :  islam was first brought to the balkans by the ottomans in the mid-to-late 15th century regarding your unrelated comment ( ?! ), 
   in serb-dominated yugoslavia , [ 56 ] unlike the preceding austro-hungarian empire , [ 57 ] the option to ethnically declare oneself bosniak was unrecognized throughout the existence of yugoslavia . 
  [ 58 ] as a political compromise , the constitution of yugoslavia was amended in 1968 to introduce `` muslims '' in a national ( as opposed to religious ) sense ; effectively recognizing a constitutive nation whilst avoiding the recognition of `` bosniak '' or `` bosnian '' as ethnic or national designations . 
  prior to this , the great majority of bosnian muslims had declared either ethnically undecided muslim or -- to a lesser extent -- undecided yugoslav in censuses pertaining to yugoslavia as the other available options were serb-muslim and croat-muslim . 
  [ 59 ] albeit achieving recognition as a distinct nation by an alternative name , the use of muslim as an ethnic designation was opposed early on as it sought to label bosniaks a religious group instead of an ethnic one . 
   upon bosnia and herzegovina 's declaration of independence from yugoslavia in the early 1990s , the great majority of bosnian muslims aligned themselves with the bosniak name . 
  regarding original comment . 
  which is * totally * in favor of vrisak 's comment . 
  he was n't a gravedigger . 
  he was a cemetery supervisor . 
  but , who knows , perhaps he dug a grave or two during his shift ... you know , just for fun . 
  thus the face he 's making, 
  it 's not fair that our minorities are shit at sport . 
  and only good at stealing copper . 
  we have those idiots as well . 
  that 's actually how we got this law . 
  just a few years ago , it was a common sense to vaccinate your kids , and specific law for that was unnecessary , but as the anti-vaccination trend started to grow in the world , number of those morons here have expanded as well . 
  and voila !, 
  now we have to have a law . 
   i do n't get # 2 this was during the april fools ' day , when a whole / r/serbia tranformed as a joke into / r/croatia . 
  css , content , everything . 
  because ... well , we hate the shit out of each other , since forever . 
  in croatian '' [ domobran ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_home_guard_\\ ( world_war_ii \\ ) ) '' means home guard . 
  and there 's a popular character in game of thrones called bran . 
  so you have bran , and you have a domobran . 
  that 's the joke . 
  and it 's a top post ( # 3 as well ) and upvoted this much because many subscribers from / r/croatia found the aprils fool 's day on / r/serbia funny/interesting , so , many of them were there that day .
