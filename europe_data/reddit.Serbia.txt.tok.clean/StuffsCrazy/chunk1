what rock have you been living under ? 
  just drawing a paralel , east wants to separate from ukraine cause it feels closer to russia than to ukraine . 
  you say russia has to make sure it is reintegrated . 
  i 'm just curious , why did n't you reintegrate kosovo to serbia , if territorial integrity is of such importance ? 
  actually , yugoslavs were forced to learn one of three : russian , french or german . 
  and those 3 are still being thought in serbia , you choose one of those , but guess what ? 
  english is mandatory . 
  yes , cause we all did n't learn english ? 
  / s not saying one or the other is better , but we , as europe , should not rely on anyone . 
  while technically true , please have some sympathy . 
  your country is hypocritical and has no respect for territorial integrity then . 
  the title asked for neighbour countries , not regions . 
  ** croatia ** beautiful vacation spots , we tolerate them , they do n't like us , our countries ( if you do n't read into either sides propaganda ) are getting along perfectly . 
  we like half of it , and get along marvelously with half of it . 
  ** montenegro ** little confused bros , ca n't really point up a bad thing , except maybe keeping milo in power . 
  we love them , we get along with them , always did , always have . 
  ** fyrom ** lake ohrid , good rest spots until you reach greece for your annual vacation . 
  ** albania ** some good musicians , do n't like them , do n't get along with them . 
  ** bulgaria ** everything , closest country to serbia in a cultural sense , good relations ( except recognizing kosovo * shakes fist * ) , we love them and they love us . 
  ** romania ** theres a reason we never had a squabble with them , great relations , no incidents , people like each other , everything is cool . 
  ** hungary ** the history , the arhitecture , pretty cities . 
  we are in good terms and relations with them . 
  yep , while staying in fyrom , was attacked , with my host and brother and his host by an angry mob of albanians , throwing rocks ( big ones ) at us and chasing us with chains and metal bars . 
  nordic languages , i have no idea why , they sound unique . 
  [ tsar dusan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stefan_du%c5%a1an ) generally favored among serbs , because he formed the serbian empire and elevated the serbian church to the patriarchal level , his reign was marked by prosperity and progress for the serbs , after him everything went to shit . 
  fun fact , only serbian king/tsar of the nemanjic dynasty to not be sainted , another interesting one is that his personal guard , and most trusted captain were germans . 
  can you elaborate on the lifestyle part ? 
  best integrated : hungarians , slovaks , or any minority in vojvodina . 
  most liked : any minority in vojvodina , probably hungarians . 
  most disliked : albanians , bosniaks in raska worst integrated : albanians , bosniaks in raska . 
  i guess ill be the first balkan answer : * romania theres a saying in romania that their best neighbours are the black sea and serbia , which i agree with , never had any problems between us , all is well , relations are cool , people are really cool with each other , you will never hear a serb say something bad about romania and romanians . 
  * hungary well , if you look at history , we should probably be at each others throats but again , no animosity between us , hungarian minority in serbia is well treated , so is the serbian minority in hungary , all is well , budapest is a popular weekend tour in serbia , and from what i hear a lot of hungarians come to belgrade to party . 
  * croatia even tho we had a few shitstorms in the past , i 'm relieved to say that relations are good now , at least between the people . 
  politicians will use old wounds to rouse political points , but nothing new . 
  serbs go to croatia for vacation , croats come here over the weekend , the youthful generations are okay with each other , economically we achieved a suficit ( do n't know the english translation of it ) this year , all in all good relations . 
  * bih well obviously we got great relations with rs , and okayish relations with fbih , a few donations and apologies were issued , but that did n't decrease the tensions much , even tho we are their highest economic partner after austria , i hope that will be fixed in the future . 
  * montengro basically our little brother , a lot of montenegrins ( and i mean a lot ... ... ) live in belgrade , serbs swarm their coast in the summer , never heard of anything bad happening between the two except maybe recognition of kosovo , but montenegro to us is what cyprus is to greece so to speak . 
  * albania well , heres the bad one , im not read into the economic side of our relations , but politcally its really bad , rama has a tendency to provocate , they support kosovo , we do n't , nationalistic jabbing is at the highest levels here . 
  people do n't mix much ( except in kosovo ) and their relations there are shitty , so i guess relations and opinions between us are pretty bad . 
  * bulgaria basically the closest country to our mentality , always enjoyed trips to bulgaria , and speaking to bulgarians , relations and opinions of each other are pretty positive and high , even tho we kinda waged war every other sunday during history , all is forgotten and well  . 
  it 's humour for you , reality for us . 
   well , it was mostly albania where they were concerned , but from what i learned , even montenegro is a bit divided in its approach towards serbia ( and also russia and the west ) , the independence did n't happen out of the thin air after all . 
  this is such bull lol, 
  apparently they are , since countries go out of their way to recognize them . 
   and such a small region is not viable on itself on the international scene . 
  you do know that region is both bigger and has more population than kosovo for example , so that argument is pointless . 
  never had a bad comment aimed toward me in the parts of europe i visited . 
  sure , there were some ignorant comments like : holy fuck youre from siberia it must be cold there ; ohhh serbia , is n't there a civil war there ? 
  ( american thinking serbia and syria are one and the same ) . 
  but ostricized and/or bigoted comments ? 
  never . 
  in fact , in most places i 've traveled to , i 've been welcomed . 
  regular people do n't give a shit about history mostly , and im young , so i guess people assume im too young to be involved in any nationalistic shit that went on . 
  to add , most people i talk to that have been in belgrade , are impressed by belgrade and serbia . 
  really ? 
  where ? 
  next time dont be a bully  :(, 
  surname is very rare , most people with my surname are related and know each other . 
  maidens name is not too comon but is n't rare either . 
  world war 2 and world war 1 . 
  im tied between the two , in the first one we lost ~ 30 % of our ** total population ** in the second one our neighbours decided to genocide the shit out of us , and then we formed a state with them that basically ( until tito died at least ) kept repressing everyone and divided serbia even further . 
  it does , i might be biased , but slav languages sound ` more rappy ' to me than most languages . 
  as the guy from cz said , growing up america was a dream . 
  now ? 
  not really . 
  the cost of living is ** insane ** , education is ludicrously expensive too , not to mention dental and healthcare . 
  foreign policy is hypocritical and too invasive , it 's borderline imperialism . 
  racism and religion being prevalent in such a number is also bad . 
  how hospitable and kind the people are , how good the night life and food is . 
  also , how um , close ? 
  people are , we greet each other with various handshakes/kisses/hugs that are seen as weird and too personal by foreigners . 
  white eagle grey wolf lynx yep , like 'em all . 
  the scene is pretty big , quality suffered a bit since more and more content is put out ( thanks youtube ) predominant language is serbian . 
  is \u0413\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430 really popular in russia ? 
  what i said is the definition of the crime , and what happend . 
  if you use your brain you will see the judgement doesnt ' fit the crime . 
  all men in the group ? 
  8k men out of 1.5 milion inhabitants are all men ? 
  as for how will they reporudce  the children who are evacuated are reproduction itself . 
  lol , hypocrisy , right . 
  thats revenge , not justice, 
   as to why it is n't a genocide , only some nonsense such as ` the numbers are n't enough ' . 
  genocide is intentionally wanting to annihilate the other people , moving women and children - the core of future reproduction denies it 's purpose to destroy the other ethnic group , or women and children would die first . 
  it was a horrible crime against humanity but not a genocide . 
  the numbers do n't matter , it 's the intention , and if the intention was to annihilate the bosniak ethnic group , why evacuate the 2 most valuable parts for reproduction ? 
  i do n't want to be dragged down to being a genocidal nation like croatia and bosnia , so keep your accusations to yourself . 
  one to talk , you are also being dicks to your local russians , but hey , who cares right . 
   with the difference that killing because you are a nutjob is n't justified , killing to liberate your people is well then , i certainly hope you get killed for someone elses ideals . 
  i do n't know , why do people defend and condone terrorist attacks carried out by the kla in 1999 in kosovo against the sovereign yugoslav government ? 
  people are against terrorism in their own backyard , they do n't give 2 flying fucks if it 's ` far ' from them . 
   one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter . 
  that all depends on the code of conduct tho , mostly a terrorist is a terrorist , and a freedom fighter is a freedom fighter . 
   i do , however , wish he was n't assassinated . 
  too easy for a man like him . 
  well , it was poetic justice , live by the sword , die by the sword ( sword being organized crime here ), 
  here you got an upvote xd, 
  and im downvotes lol anyway thanks i didnt know thats a thing, 
   in reality he tried to suppress nationalism as a whole which is the only reason yugoslavia was so successful under his leadership , he did n't specifically target a group . 
  you are really naive if you think thats the reason it was successful . 
  and even more laughably naive to think tito was fair .
