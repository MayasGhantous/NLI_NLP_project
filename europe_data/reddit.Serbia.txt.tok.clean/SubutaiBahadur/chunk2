  one that seems to have a really academic title !, 
  so it is proven that some people were antisemites in serbia ? 
  surprise !, 
  there were nazi supporters even in the usa , uk , and ussr !, 
  what does that have to do with the fact that the extermination of the jews started under the third reich occupation ? 
  some serbs colaborated with the nazis , so did some norwegians . 
  what is the point of this ? 
  who is trying to deceive history here ? 
  that proclamation was made in 1942 , after the occupation of belgrade , by a german ss officer . 
  in zemun , a part of belgrade under croatian ( ndh ) control !, 
  what do you precisely consider propaganda from what i wrote ? 
  these are facts , except maybe for the last two sentences which could * perhaps * be qualified as an opinion . 
  because it would be discriminatory to pass a law that only affects a certain demographic ? 
  most appropriate username i have seen so far . 
  unfortunately one can see that this opinion is getting more and more popular . 
  while right wingers like to blame the opposite side ( e.g. , serbs the croats , croats the serbs ) . 
  the ( quasi ) leftists have invented this new way of denying any responsibility within their own countries . 
  the truth is : yes there were a lot of foreign powers pushing for yugoslavia 's dissolution , but we 're fucking idiots ourselves . 
  he has some repressed feelings for serbia that just wo n't let him rest . 
  when he decides to come out of the closet i will send him a \u0161ajka\u010da . 
  my treat , of course . 
  yes , flag of america . 
  for wiping feet . 
  better hire an interior designer to deal with it . 
  before you start supporting assad too . 
  they are un-european , apparently . 
  funny thing is : if `` croman '' saw seselj say some * other * things he would be persuading us all he is a lunatic and a liar . 
  ( which i think he is ), 
  not to mention serbia was not even involved in bosnia . 
  croatia and kosovo - yes , bosnia ? 
  that was bosnian serbs who have their own state - republic of srpska . 
  i meant i hoped the idea of eu membership will nudge our politicians in that direction . 
  one of the few things i hoped eu membership will bring us is a decrease in corruption . 
  i am not under that illusion anymore , especially if they are willing to negotiate with this government . 
  yeah , i can not believe anyone speaking the language does n't get that this is a joke . 
  it 's funny , but not real . 
  learn to take a joke man, 
   apart of the albanian state freudian slip ?

  and at an increasing rate . 
  ca 5 $ is what i saw yesterday . 
  germany . 
  edit : i see now one can find for 3 $ in lidl . 
  which probably also supports the hypothesis of better documenting . 
  hunters are more likely to keep their weapons in accordance with the law in comparison to owners of `` war leftovers '' . 
  the reason the numbers are so high in serbia is probably because there were excessive sweeps in the beginning of 2000s after the assassination of the prime minister when a state of emergency was declared . 
  people had the choice to legalize or give up their weapons in a couple of weeks . 
  i doubt realistically the number of weapons in , e.g. , kosovo and bosnia is much lower ... 
  well , serbia has 37.8 * documented * weapons per 100 inhabitants . 
  i would n't bet on the numbers being correct in some of the surrounding countries either . 
  i would say the nordics are just probably good at documenting it in comparison . 
  shit , it gets worse than munich ? 
  much worse !, 
  oh , yeah , our reputation is awesome otherwise ... 
  i heard people say that the greatest success of austrians is making people think of beethoven as an austrian , and hitler as german . 
  `` vampire '' is a serbian word . 
  also one of the earliest [ `` confirmed '' vampires ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petar_blagojevich ) was ( is ? ), 
  from serbia . 
  do n't let the nordrhein-westfalians hear you say that ... 
  and no comment on kuroachia ? 
  edit : kurac = dick in bcs, 
  sometimes i get the impression that for some people `` the balkans '' starts around salzburg . 
  well , you guys are a better tourist destination , so ok ... 
  i am aware of that . 
  was in finland last year . 
  while hungarians and finns are definitely very different , it was interesting to hear a language sounding loosely similar to hungarian . 
  you guys have the estonians , saami , karelians , etc. 
  hungarians are 100 % surrounded by people to whom hungarian sounds as if it was from another planet . 
  finno-ugric brotherhood fails once again :'(, 
  is `` muovi '' related to the finnish word for `` artificial '' . 
  in hungarian it is `` m\u0171anyag '' with `` m\u0171 '' meaning artificial , and `` anyag '' being material . 
   also i found many researcher falling in love and getting married and keeping writing papers together that is not what i am talking about here . 
  yeah most of these families were active in the early 20th century when the academic system was significantly different . 
  did these people generally end up working on the same topic at the same university ? 
  is there ? 
  it is quite sad . 
  there are several highly respected spanish scientists in my field . 
  since my gf is spanish i was poking around a bit for positions in spain a while ago , and one of these famous professors told me to forget about it , in confidence but very directly . 
  he said they basically get around solely on research done by phd students which then almost without exception leave spain . 
  it 's a pity . 
  i live in denmark now and i miss the sun and wearing shorts . 
  it is generally strange that two closely related people end up in the same field , doing the same research and at the same institution . 
  lot of coincidences need to occur for this to happen . 
  it 's not impossible , but quite curious . 
  it kind of smells of nepotism . 
  these things often occur in countries like serbia ( where i am from ) as well , where people on leading positions simply employ their family , friends , people from their political party , etc. 
  therefore , you end up with papers with three authors with the same surname and more authors than pages . 
  it is indicative of a high level of nepotism . 
  check out this one : https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3bqlgk/when_science_is_just_not_fun_enough/ not a scientific paper , but a published book of abstracts . 
  not just that , but most journals ( at least the ones i have published in ) require confirmation of authorship per official university e-mail . 
  additionally , misusing someones name and manipulating authorship is a big no-no and you can get into serious trouble . 
  i kinda doubt the whole story . 
  every single politician . 
  but `` the trump of serbia '' has to be vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj . 
  [ he supports him too !, 
  ] ( http://static.mondo.rs/picture/537522/jpeg/protest-seselj-tramp-mondo-stefan-stojanovic-21.jpg ), 
  was thinking the same ... one of us !, 
  one of us !, 
  german speaking region in italy .
