[ this is kinda relevant ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3ygc1oi.png ), 
  welp all those things are true tho ^ truth ^ is ^ controversial, 
  who 's gon na keep russia in check if they abandon europe ? 
  that 's why they do n't like him, 
  why are n't there any in balkans ? 
  seeing that all neighboring countries have at least some bisons around how come there is none in serbia , slovenia or croatia ? 
  they are country in the alps , why should n't they participate ? 
  peppers do n't need to be dried , they can be cooked by various methods or even eaten raw . 
  yeah sun dries them, 
  peppers = / = tobacco, 
  and god is the serb and he will protect us, 
  too bad , seems like we have to bring genocide and mass killing back to the table, 
  sorry friend , but from which slavic region do you come from , that is strange black-red-blue-white flag you got there, 
  how can russians be real if our serbs are n't real, 
  you can stop pretending and believing that it was ` because ethnic cleansing ' usa attacked serbia cause they had interest there and got it . 
  now they got bondsteel base , a puppet state and closer connection to turkey which is nato country . 
  not to mention cheap minerals and ore that kosovo is rich of and that is sold at extremely low prices to usa . 
  um not only this thread . 
  every thread or comment i see posted by your name , which is * occupythekremlin * , that involves politics or russia , it 's always to show russia in negative light, 
  what happened to you that made you so angry at russia that you always try to negativize it ? 
  from kosovo, 
  shh bby let the burn heal, 
  so albanians built all those orthodox monasteries in xiii and xiv century on kosovo ? 
  oh yeah , you did n't even exist until 1912 . 
  seems like in russia history repeats itself . 
  ivan the terrible would be proud . 
  i have scarred memory because of german porn, 
  we have surnames like konjokrad that means horse-steal , popivoda that means drink water , guzine that means literally asses , and while not odd in my town we had one police officer called batinic , what is funny that batine is serbian for beating someone ( physically ) and batina is old word for police baton, 
  go commemorate holocaust by visiting major concentration camps, 
  so if german police accidentally stumbles onto 22 and 15 having sex they just politely ask forgiveness and leave ? 
  to give specific example of us soldiers not getting charges on the ` stuff ' , rape could have and probably had happened but swept under rug . 
  um i said nothing about comparison, 
  i specifically remember article or news story from about year ago where us military soldiers ( 5-6 guys ) urinated above the killed enemies somewhere in me , dont remember specifics . 
  as i said you can visit jadovno yourself if you do n't believe # 1 encyclopedia in the world , as i did in 2013 while visiting some genocide memorial centres, 
  check the wikipedia link , or even visit jadovno , i did in 2013 , concrete patches do exist, 
  what about so called ` theories ' about covering up ustashe crimes by communist government ? 
  do you have anything to add given the links ? 
  check the wikipedia link that i have linked above and which i will link again that states ' [ the camp site remained unexplored after the war due to the depth of the gorges where bodies were disposed and the fact that some of them had been filled with concrete by yugoslavia 's communist authorities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jadovno_concentration_camp ) ' as you do n't want to acknowledge census data , [ english wikipedia page on croatia 's demographics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_croatia#ethnic_groups ) states ( under the paragraph ` ethnic groups ' ) that in census that took place in 1991 number of serbs living in croatia was 581,663 which accounted for 12.2 % of the population , after break-up of yugoslavia and wars census for year 2001 stated that there are 201,631 serbs that accounts for 4.2 % of the population, 
  [ see jadovno ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jadovno_concentration_camp ) , many camps had been covered up to propagate ` brotherhood and unity ' if the maps are irrelevant are population check numbers inflated and fake ? 
  sfrj tried to hide and keep war victims low as possible , since they filled up jadovno corpse holes with concrete . 
  so with your above fact that there were ' 346.740 ' victims , of which 200.000 are croats you say that less serbs are killed in ww2 than croats ? 
  and again you dodge 1991 exodus and banishment numbers ? 
  are they fake and inflated ? 
   your source is not a legitimate source and it exaggerates figures [ yeah , israeli government wants to exaggerate figures ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yad_vashem ) can i have official document stating those 346,740 victims in whole yugoslavia ? 
  and who did shoot 200.000 croats , it was around 1/15 part of croatian population , as the all territories with croatian civilian populace was under control of ndh ? 
  and what about ethnic cleansing during breakup of yugoslavia ? 
  are those numbers inflated and exaggerated ? 
  re-read my comment as i have added more information from israeli holocaust memorial centre . 
  also in no possible ways there have been killed 1.2 millions of croats and bosnian muslims during war so nothing comes down to null [ also see croatian population count in 1991 and 2001 with adequate maps ] ( https://sr.wikipedia.org/sr/%d0%94%d0%b5%d0%bc%d0%be%d0%b3%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%84%d0%b8%d1%98%d0%b0_%d0%a5%d1%80%d0%b2%d0%b0%d1%82%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b5#.d0.bf.d0.be.d0.bf.d0.b8.d1.81_.d1.81.d1.82.d0.b0.d0.bd.d0.be.d0.b2.d0.bd.d0.b8.d1.88.d1.82.d0.b2.d0.b0_1991._.d0.b3.d0.be.d0.b4.d0.b8.d0.bd.d0.b5 ), 
  as you said yourself occupied , not defeated, 
   oh look , half of the territory on that map does n't even have a serb majority um well jasenovac happened , gospic happened , bljesak and oluja happened , that 's why we serbs do n't have majority in areas we had pre ww2 edit : to further elaborate my point , yad vashem center has estimated ( precise number unknown since ustasha government burned most of death camps concentration ) that more than 500,000 serbs were murdered in croatia in horribly sadistic ways , 250,000 were expelled , and another 200,000 were forced to convert to catholicism , you can further read it [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%205930.pdf ) add in another 200.000 serbs who fled into serbia during oluja . 
  ` death of one is tragedy , death of million is statistic ', 
   serbia was completely defeated by bulgaria wrong , serbia was defeated by combined efforts of austro-hungary and germany and bulgarian attack was focused later to cut off serbian army retreat . 
  they attacked after germany took belgrade , not before . 
   not at all . 
  they would have remained partitioned and under the rule of austria , hungary and italy . 
  they could have gotten independence in exchange of being de facto puppets of london and paris . 
  just like russia pushed bulgaria into existence little bit earlier, 
  '' all you members of hague tribunal , can onlt accept that you can only suck my dick '' - the duke, 
  prosecutors got rekt , big time, 
  so you are saying that students are to blame because they studied ? 
  and they should go to private tutor or pay for extra classes just cause they are proficient in science & technology class ? 
  i 'm too looking for this , from what i can understand from title : some students with knack for electronics performed better than some other students , and parents of other students instead of blaming children for not studying enough , they took issue to principle blaming other gifted students for knowing too much and thus classes were restructured . 
  `` genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such : ( a ) killing members of the group ; ( b ) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group ; ( c ) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ; ( d ) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group ; ( e ) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group . '' yellow house happened and by [ un 's convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/convention_on_the_prevention_and_punishment_of_the_crime_of_genocide ) classifies as genocide . 
  vucic and dacic did n't do any war crimes , they were just bandwagoners that jumped from one ideology to another for their own ass 's sake . 
  they are highly unpopular in certain demographics , and hopefully will be removed from government at elections soon to come . 
   and what genocide did thaci orchestrate ? 
  yellow house  tell me a similar systematic killing with the plan of exterminating a whole town similar to srebrenica carried on by thaci ? 
  you answer this yourself by your 2nd paragraph :  did thaci 's men kill inoccent serb civilians ? 
  sure they did . 
  is he illicit in those crimes ? 
  surely he is . 
  mine relatives were n't in any army , they were simple farmers that lived peacefully . 
  if the karadzic 's army came a day later , they would have been slaughtered like all many others serbian villages near srebrenica . 
  i view him as a hero , have his picture on the wall , and have a clear conscience . 
  from people that gave us gospic and jasenovac and killed/banished part of my family that lived in croatia , i expected nothing less, 
  nah , missed the point, 
  and hashim tha\u00e7i was never ever convicted, 
   this court is a joke at least on that you 're right, 
  he also saved 18 relatives of mine . 
  1 greatgrandpa , 1 grandpa , 4 uncles , 3 aunts and 9 cousins . 
  guy is a hero, 
  at thursday , 27th march in 1941 , in serbia , ruling three member regency that signed tripartite pact with nazi germany was overthrown . 
  group of royal officers ( bribed by british ) in early morning hours captured all radio stations and army barracks and rallied people into massive demonstrations where people said paroles like : `` better war than pact ( bolje rat nego pakt ) '' and `` better grave than slave ( bolje grob nego rob ) '' because of that axis powers began invasion of yugoslavia on april 6th . 
  historians perspective on the matter is divided : one side thinks that on that fateful march day , serbia showed that it was against hitler and for freedom , while others think that coup brought lot of misery and death to serbia . 
  yeah , it 's all because bosnian civil war and politics . 
  and also because this is balkan and we dont know any logic here, 
  republika srpska means `` serb republic '' . 
  it 's serbian half of bosnia . 
  [ here is wikipedia link if you want to know more ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republika_srpska ), 
  why , our flags are n't that hard . 
  red - blue - white with awesome white eagle = serbia red with gold eagle = montenegro red with orange/yellow sun = fyrom red - white - blue with ugly checkerboard = croatia red - blue - white = republic of srpska red - white - green = bulgaria white - blue - red with some petty mountains = slovenia white - blue - red = russia blue - yellow = ukraine red - green = belarus white - blue - red with awesome double cross - slovakia white - red = poland poland with blue triangle in left side = czech republic there are descriptions of slav flags , they 're so easy to learn, 
  jk that all tricolors have meaning ? 
  when kosovo rolled their referendum about seceding from serbia , no one complained about attack on territorial integrity . 
  crimea runs referendum to join russia , everybody go nuts , majority of people voted for joining to russia . 
  few days after that russia rolls some troops into crimea and black sea to protect civilians from ukrainian civil war and commits what article above words as : `` russia 's ongoing attack on the territorial integrity of ukraine and represents the most blatant violation in decades of the un charter '', 
  birthplace of my ancestors from my mothers side . 
  it 's such beauty, 
   it marked the beginning of russia 's ongoing attack on the territorial integrity of ukraine and represents the most blatant violation in decades of the un charter , international law and breach of the key documents that make up the european security order , such as the helsinki final act and the charter of paris .
