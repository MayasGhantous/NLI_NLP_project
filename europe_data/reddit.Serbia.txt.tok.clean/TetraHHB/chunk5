  i do n't see german priests holding masses for hitler in berlin . 
  besides , those masses are just one of the things i mentioned . 
  and do n't play naive dude , people like josipovic and mesic are also saying that nazi rethoric and nazi sentiments are on the rise in croatia . 
  come on man you know very well , better then me probablly , what kind of people attened that mass and with what background it was held and reactions it had on both sides of political spectrum in croatia . 
  it was pure political act . 
  just google `` misa za pavelica '' black uniforms , heil hitler salutes , u signes , flags of ndh . 
  but those are the things that happened . 
  you want links ? 
  hey man , just my opinion , both eddie and the pythons are kings of absurdist comedy . 
  pythons even call him `` the lost python '' . 
  yep , one the greatest comedians ever imho . 
  up there with the pythons . 
  you sound like a totally reasonable person that should be taken seriously . 
   i understand you 're somewhat intellectually challenged nice . 
  this makes your completely wrong arguments absolutely correct , just by saying that . 
  dude you are a boring , hatefull joke . 
  edit : oooh editing your childish insult . 
  nice , nice . 
  it 's sooo less childish now , now people can take you seriously . 
  you are a type of person that ca n't have calm , serious disscussin about anything . 
  stick your head deeper in that `` us vs. them '' sand and when you lack arguments start with the insults . 
  go away . 
   connecting the state to the religion , as is customary in orthodox tradition . 
  oh lol ... yeah christmas , easter , ascension etc. 
  are not state holidays in catholic countries . 
  only orthodox christians do it . 
   in fact it 's only about 80 % serb ah ** only ** 80 % serb . 
  yeah ** only ** 80 % . 
  like croatia was ** only ** around 70 % populated by croats , but got it 's own country or serbia being ** only ** around 80 % populated by serbs or germany being ** only ** around 80 % populated by ethnic germans ... so ... i di n't get your logic ? 
  it should be 100 % populated by serbs in order for them to have state holiday . 
  that 's how demicracy works ? 
  you need 100 % of votes for something ? 
  ** only ** 80 % wo n't cut it . 
  you are absolutely correct in every way . 
  with cool head and realistic assumptions . 
  and being selfaware . 
  you know shouting nazi slongans , building monuments to nazis , holding masses for ante pavelic , disrespecting victims of ww2 , discriminating serb minority and then being mad when serbs react is kinda opposite of cool headed , realistic and selfaware and kinda dickish . 
  being in nato and eu and being afraid of serbia , also not coolheaded , realistic and selfaware . 
  also not saying hyperbolic things like :  specially with the kind of rhetoric that 's coming from serbia right now , which is almost a carbon copy of the rhetoric from the 90s . 
  would also help . 
  and seriously you are boring with the fucking war and `` destroying of your country '' . 
  war ended quarter of century ago , it lasted for 4 years . 
  short fucking war and not especially bloody in croatia . 
  get over it ffs . 
  mesic had fascist remarks in the past , now he is the biggest antufascist ever . 
  who gives a fuck . 
  politicians on both sides dameged their own countries more then the war . 
  yet you want to tell me that croats should be afraid of one man who is dying of cancer and has 6 % support out of 30 % people . 
  while i reapeat croatia is in fucking nato . 
  seriously ... dude ... 
   nikolic made a statement about vukovar being a serbian city where croats should n't return as late as 2012 , when he was already the president of serbia . 
  really ? 
  well , do n't know what to tell you ... be scared , be very scared . 
  spread the hate and vote for right vingers , tolerate nazis and nazi rethoric . 
  always talk about the past . 
  do n't talk about the social and economic situatin in your country and blame as much as you can on serbs . 
  and especially mention seselj in threads totally unrelated to seselj and even serbia . 
  no other solution as far as i can see . 
  i understand about seselj , but he has only few seats in the parliament , not any real power . 
  for the rest , eh , if they are good enough for merkel and other world leaders ... what can you do ? 
  besides it 's a little unfair to judge vucic on what he said 25 years ago , when he was 20-something . 
  i am no vucic supporter , but these days he sounds more reasonable then most of croatian politicans ( exempting josipovic , too bad he lasted only 1 mandate ) . 
  nikolic is an old fart , nobody likes him , not even supporters of his own party . 
  and dacic was politically resurected in an act by strongly pro-western boris tadic and his democratic party . 
  such is politics . 
  time has changed significantly since the '90s . 
  seriously , you will go with the shittiest tabloid that costs 0,20 euro cents . 
  do n't have that much time . 
  but appart from the letters that you mentioned he did n't do much else . 
  especially in the beggining he was a fiery supporter of nazis and ante pavelic , he saw conversion of serbs to catholicism as `` freeing them from chains of byzantine '' , in his letters you can also see he downright despised orthodox christians , protestants and jews . 
  he also spread anti-semituc and freemasonery bullshit . 
  sure , those letters are not enough to condemn him , but they are also not enough for his redemption . 
  so , lets stick to what he did and not what he wrote . 
  and what he did is colaborate and support nazis , converted people to catholicism and did n't give any meaningfull resistance to do nazis . 
  a good intetion or good deed does n't redemp you from other crimes . 
  if you hit an inocent man and later buy food for a homless person , there is still a fact that you hit an inocent man and no amount of food for the homeless will help you in the court . 
  ya get what i am saying . 
  can you sum it up please ? 
  no , again you are not talking about what 's happening , but about whataboutism . 
  serbia as a legal successor of sr yugolavia and serbia and montenegro union is also obliged to respect the dayton agrement . 
  and as you can see serbia did n't support the referendum . 
  what people in republika srpska do is their will . 
  but i still do n't get it why they ca n't have the holiday when they want it . 
  that 's whats happening and not `` what if he does this , what if they do this . '', 
  i am not offended and my intention is not to offend . 
  i am pointing out my view that your view is incorrect . 
  as i am sick of the , unnecessary imho , paranoia on both sides that just creats disscord while pointing attention away from the real issues , furthering `` us vs. them '' mentality and generaly not being constructive and realistic . 
  and i am annoyed to see that seamigly inteligent people fall for it . 
  but why did n't they simply give them the holiday ? 
  bosnian side can also be acused od disregarding the will of 30 % of it 's population and creating instability . 
  i repeat there would be no referendum if they got their holiday . 
  but if they were allowed to get the holiday in the first place then there would be no referendum . 
  so your whole post is whataboutism sprinkeled with paranoia . 
  the problem is that holiday falls on orthodox christian st. stefan holiday and somehow that is dissmisseve towards muslims and catholics ... ??? 
  ya know like celebrating christmas or ascension day is dissmissive towards all non christians in christian majority countries . 
  that 's how multi-ethnic , multi-cultural states work . 
  do n't know if anybody told you but serbia and croatia already share a common border , also if republica srpska gets independance it wo n't get any closer or further away from croatia . 
  it will stay where it is , on `` the doorstep of dubrovnik and zagreb '' . 
  they are already there . 
  same way all the exyu republics stayed exactlly where they were before the break-up .
