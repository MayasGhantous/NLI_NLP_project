  so the only thing that can cause problems is global geo-political climate and not distance of borders of croatia and serbia , which let 's face it wo n't happen cause croatia is in nato and serbia is steadly going to the eu , and no amount of croatian paranoia will change that . 
  as far as i understand : serbs in bosnia want to have a state holiday on certain date and the governing bodies of bosnia wo n't let them , so they appealed to constitutional court who also said serbs ca n't have that holiday , so now serbs in bosnia want to hold a referendum to see if people want that holiday , but again central government and international representatives are against it . 
  someone correct me if i am wrong . 
  do n't tell me what do . 
  did you just link jutarnji.hr as some kind of a source ? 
  lol, 
  but the jews are n't the only ones who were persecuted in croatia during the ww2 . 
  do n't you think serbs and roma should also have a say in this regard , considering serbs were the no. 1 victims in concetration camps in ndh . 
  stepinac went with the whole `` kill one third , convert one third , expell one third '' politic just fine . 
  nah not really , srbislav popovic or like a dozen other name/surname combos are more serbian . 
  * cedo * would be serb from croatia or bosnia , in serbia not so much . 
  and first time i hear surname `` colovic '' . 
  i actually thought he was croatian . 
  yes in latin . 
  but in serbo-croatian * papar * and * biber * are * black pepper * . 
  in serbo-croatian * paprika * is a feminine deminutive of that and means * bell pepper * . 
  * papar * is masculine , * paprika * is feminine . 
  and that 's where hungarians got the word . 
  serbo-croatian also has words like * papreno * , * paprat * , * papricica * , * zapapriti * etc. 
  all coming from the same latin root . 
  so much for uralic origin and all other bullshit you so eloquently spewed . 
  now fuck off , you are boring , ignorant and meanspirited . 
  thank you . 
  also - relevant username . 
  it 's actually from latin * piper * , then entered hungarian as a diminutive from serbo-croatian * papar * and * papreno * . 
  it even has standard serbo-croatian feminine diminutive suffix * - ika * , * - ica * . 
  otherwise you are real fun guy .

  i 'll pretend i did n't read that ... - . -, 
  shit . 
  germans are so nice and diplomatic , i ca n't stay mad at them for too long . 
  alright , go , go little prince , claim slavic words and hindi symbols as your own .

  he is just drying those sassy paprika so he can put them in sausages later . 
  i am not even hungarian and i got trrigered . 
   if we can take this land that supposedly belongs to montenegro , why not ? 
  cause eu and usa is telling them not to and the visa liberation will be stalled and kosovo will continue to be isolated and stability of the region will be at risk etc. 
  is it really worth it ? 
  tear gas , bombs , molotovs and violence over some land that kosovo albanians do n't really need and everybody agrees is not theirs . 
  agree with rest of your post . 
  nope . 
  just saying that many of you guys have problems of understanding the concept of ownership with your : `` this is our land yadda yadda '' mythological-fascistic bullshit , that somehow seams to be mainstream among albanians . 
  nope . 
  albanians having problems understanding the concept of ownership .

  ahahahaha oh god oh ahahaha ... fell of my chair ... 
  ah i thought all of that happened in ww2 . 
  but yeah , still pretty crazy and tragic , thanks for sharing that . 
  yeah , sounds posibble . 
  ca n't imagine why would serbs shoot at cincari during ww2 . 
  they were always together with serbs . 
   they do n't seem to care too much they 're here lol actually they would rather be in germany , just like anyone else living here . 
   i 've lost family members to the croatian usta\u0161e in ww2 , to the germans , my family members were fired at by serbs and one was killed , and another was killed by bosnian muslims . 
  just curious , what ethnicity are you when everyone was after your familly ? 
  serbian-german , hungarian , jew , bunjevac , familly with bunch of mixed ethnicities and everyone was on different sides ? 
  what ? 
  ca n't imagine a single ethnicity that would be hated by germans , croats , muslims and serbs . 
   the idiots doing this arent `` everyone in kosovo '' hey man i never said `` everyone in kosovo '' . 
  do n't put quotation marks like i said that , cause i did n't . 
   dude just a few weeks ago there was a military coup attempt in turkey . 
  not powered by nationalism . 
  and not the same , not even in the same ball park . 
   in serbia people wake up in the morning only to find a building suddenly erected in place of their house do n't know of that . 
  maybe you are talking about illegal buildings being destroyed or illegal gypsy housings being removed ? 
  doubt that building can be erected over the night . 
  post link of what are you talking about , cause i 'm not sure . 
  but i doubt it was powered by nationalism . 
   you talk as the situation is better in any other balkan country . 
  yeah miles better . 
  romania , bulgaria , greece , montenegro , serbia , croatia anywhere else , except in kosovo and bosnia . 
  and even in bosnia it is better . 
   this kind of things is happening in every balkan state . 
  nope . 
  please post evidence where people are prevented from visiting church once a year or visiting their own home or going to schools with police escort or churches and monasteries being guarded by armed nato forces and barbed wire . 
  and then i will agree with you . 
   it 's hilarious that serbians talk about how `` shit '' kosovo is , when their state is just as crap situation . 
  yep serbia is a shitty country in many regards , still miles ahead of kosovo . 
  but i do n't see a point in comparing . 
   have you ever been to kosovo ? 
  i tried once , angry mob threw rocks at our bus , so whole group decided to go back to serbia . 
  do n't think i will try to go there ever again . 
   the only place where things seem to be as they should be is slovenia , croatia is also heading in the right direction . 
  slovenia is not a balkan country . 
  and shit in croatia , as far as nationalism and human rights are concerned is worse then in serbia at the moment . 
  economically croatia is ahead . 
  but i do n't see what all of that has to do with the simple question i asked . 
  seams you avoid to answer it . 
  still not the same as this . 
  especially with the football hooligans , they are retarded evrywhere , check poland , netherland , uk etc. 
  truth is , shit like this does n't happen anywhere else , but in kosovo . 
  also the thing about albanians in preshevo valley is not true . 
  they just ca n't import books for school from kosovo . 
  they can import it from albania or they can print it in serbia or wherever else . 
  there are schools and teachers that hold classes only in albanian . 
  they do n't even speak serbian down there and then they complain how they ca n't find a job , or get proper medical treatment or go to university .
