[ a great serbian ethno music mix . 
  ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=i0zlhzd33_g ), 
  kosovo is serbia confirmed, 
  i appreciate a man who can handle the banter, 
  `` there is something within me that might be illusion as it is often case with young delighted people , but if i would be fortunate to achieve some of my ideals , it would be on the behalf of the whole of humanity . 
  if those hopes would become fulfilled , the most exciting thought would be that it is a deed of a serb . '', 
  - at the train station , before leaving belgrade for america `` i was born in croatia . 
  the croatians and slovenes were never in a position to fight for their independence . 
  it was the serbians who fought the battles for freedom and the price of liberty was paid in serbian blood . 
  all true croatians and slovenes remember that gratefully . 
  they also know that the serbians have an unequaled aptitude and experience in warfare and are best qualified to direct the forces of the country in a crisis . '', 
  - from his [ tribute to king alexander ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/tribute_to_king_alexander ) `` i am equally proud of my serbian origin and croatian homeland . '', 
  - in a [ telegram to a croatian political leader ] ( http://predsjednik.hr/default.aspx?art=12900&amp;sec=810 ) and you say he was more american than serbian ? 
  you 're the one clutching at straws . 
  ** \u2626 kek \u2626 **, 
  haha well memed, 
  there 's this funny stereotype about one part of my country where everybody thinks it 's independent . 
  horrible , really . 
  u wot m8, 
   years of fake elections , economic policy based on $ 100/barrel oil prices that will bankrupt them , reduction in civil liberties , year upon year of lower real terms wages . 
  eeh , i feel like people do n't understand the russian mentality well enough . 
  putin is not a cause , he is a symptom . 
  most russians support him . 
  also , if anything , putin is viewed only as having increased living standards ( although obviously state-owned media plays a role in this ) . 
  he 's bad for europe but not necessarily for russia . 
  [ this article 's a bit old ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20100525073652/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article2994651.ece ) but i feel it is still relevant on many points . 
   plus , they do n't have their own blue cheese cultures so getting a nice stilton is near on impossible . 
  never mind lets go bolshevik revolution 2 baby class war now, 
  ... i may be dense , but can you list the reasons that russians would have to be angry/frustrated at the government ? 
  is it us is it us are we relevant, 
  people act according to two overarching factors : firstly , genetics ( that is , inherited behaviours ) and , secondly , conditioning . 
  the nature/nurture duality , so to speak . 
  i 've seen a lot of people criticize extreme ideologies by saying something along the lines of `` oh , ca n't they see that if they were born in different circumstances , they 'd be just like those they hate . '', 
  the problem is that , more often than not , this logic applies backwards as well ; in many cases , if an otherwise reasonable person swapped upbringings with an extremist * they too * would have a high chance of adopting extreme attitudes ( unless they were at heart a fundamentally different person ) . 
  many people lack the empathy to truly understand someone 's motives and background and prefer to think of them as idiots , cowards or subhuman monsters . 
  in reality , most of human history can be understood through a single basic premise : people need an identity , and will do horrible things to protect their identity . 
  with few exceptions , most people are kind of jerks . 
  ** \u2626 kek \u2626 **, 
  just a thought : if the eu were to federate completely , what state would it be the `` successor '' to ? 
   putting serbia next to bulgaria do you want a [ third balkan war ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkan_wars ) i kid of course . 
  well done op . 
  edit : although , why make a new version literally 8 hours after the first one ? 
  the roma population in serbia is basically split into two stereotypes . 
  for one there are the romani who do their best to integrate into society and contribute - and i wo n't say it 's all sunshine and rainbows for them , they 're still patronized and viewed like inferiors to some extent , but nobody 's that actively racist towards them . 
  the other stereotype is that of the homeless gypsy : those who settle on public land , pull cheap tricks to steal / hassle money away from you , and do their damned best to * not * integrate into wider society in any way . 
  their situation is comparable to the most ghettoized of african-americans , who basically hate the rest of their society , feel incredibly persecuted , and do n't * want * to lift themselves out of poverty . 
  there is tremendous racist sentiment towards them but it is n't entirely unjustified . 
  here 's what i mean . 
  at some point a short while ago , the government set aside a couple of high-rise buildings in the suburbs for the homeless romani living in the city itself . 
  they were given individual apartments and all that . 
  within a year they had stripped the buildings of paint , windows , wallpaper , furniture , flooring , and even pipes and wiring , sold it all , and left behind the bare concrete skeletons of the apartment buildings for the government to deal with . 
  so basically there 's a massive cultural problem with a small fraction of the roma population that wo n't participate in common society and hate everyone who does , including `` integrated '' roma . 
  and of course it 's a self-sustaining problem because the racist attitudes of the general public cause them to be that way in the first place . 
  edit : this is only really a problem in the large cities , most roma in the smaller towns have less trouble . 
  can we get a grexit already and be done with it ? 
  i 'll be that guy and point out that it 's not just serbs doing it . 
  i confirmed several flairless posters as croats by their posting histories and another as dutch . 
  it 's just the most abrasive people doing it in order to gain some credibility for an extreme stance . 
  whoah , look at this anti-semite nazi , guise / s that attitude is n't making you any friends , pal, 
  kosovo is serbia confirmed at last, 
  finally , a way to get the albanians out of kosovo !, 
  thanks , european commission !, 
  i do n't know what to tell you mate , the proportion of serbs fell from 23.5 % in 1961 to 13.2 % in 1981 ( alright , a 10 % drop rather than 15 % ) . 
  the serbs claimed they were being discriminated against , and that they were being specifically targeted as rape and murder victims . 
  furthermore - something i just found - albanians were invited into kosovo by tito himself , which further upset the balance . 
  by the way , why would you think it 's because you 're albanian rather than slavic ? 
  is there a particular reason ? 
  thanks fam , keep vetoing us please, 
   it was your government that decided to remove kosovan autonomy under `` kosovan autonomy '' the serb population in kosovo dropped another 15 % over 20 years , after a long period of stability after the withdrawal of the ottomans . 
  the albanians were abusing their power and that is why it was removed . 
   if we were slavs you guys would n't give one fucking shit . 
  yes , because we absolutely love the croats and the bosniaks . 
  absolutely no bad blood there whatsoever . 
  \\  look at username \\  [ `` domagoj the first is remembered '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/domagoj_of_croatia ) i wonder who could be behind this post, 
  oh , like our opinion generally on its status ? 
  i 'd say that most people are resigned to it being * de facto * independent , but we 're going to hold a grudge about it forever . 
  the [ ottoman tax census of 1455 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1455_defter_of_the_brankovi%c4%87_lands ) contradicts this , with a 95 % serb population recorded . 
  actually serbs were the massive majority in the region before the great turkish war between austria and the ottomans , at which point a bunch of them were expelled in 1699 because they sided against the turks . 
  after this estimates vary , with the earliest reliable albanian majority recorded 200 years later in 1899 by austrian statisticians , with 48 % albanians vs. 43 % serbs . 
  it 's also sort of disingenious to then say that the fact that they were different in the 7th century means that their status in the 18th century ca n't be translated to the modern day . 
  i have a coherent family tree in kosovo that can be drawn that far back . 
  comparing 3 centuries back is much more easily doable than 15 centuries back . 
  in most ways that you look at it ( culture , religion , etc. ), 
  serbs are not those people anymore . 
  this is true for albanians as well . 
  `` xd le seventh century '' does n't work as an argument . 
  and genetically speaking , serbs are mostly the same people that lived there previously ( thraco-celtic tribes ) , just the ruling culture changed . 
  again , something that goes for albanians as well . 
   you 're mad because were native europeans implying we were n't ? 
  or did i misunderstand this point, 
  good point actually, 
  i mean the belarus / muscovy region usually is counted as europe , and that 's where the serb tribes are from , so i would say we 're native europeans, 
  sorry friend , i do n't want to be a province . 
  the only reason anyone in our country supports joining the eu is because the economy 's down the toilet , a lingering effect partially caused by the nato bombing years ago and partially due to the massive corruption in parliament , both things that europe enabled ( for example , as long as our politicians make conciliatory gestures with regards to kosovo and privatization of public services they 're allowed to commit blatant vote fraud , which they did in the most recent election ) . 
  on a venn diagram of serbia 's satirical magazines and actual news sources , there would not be two circles . 
  kek but they 're not going to the uk though you need to work on that reading comprehension , friend, 
  that 's exactly what i mean . 
  20 years ago was n't long , in the balkans we hold grudges for shit that happened hundreds of years ago . 
  it 's easy for foreign agents to point at the civilian casualties of the wars and say `` look at what happened !,
