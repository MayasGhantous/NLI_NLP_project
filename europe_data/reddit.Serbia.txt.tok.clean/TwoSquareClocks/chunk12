  when the referendum results happened , my feed was full of serbs from all over , all saying how hopeful they were for a free rs . 
  vucic is a dirty politician who stays in power by promising free eu money . 
  it 's the only reason the populace puts up with him . 
   i also am not aware of any kind of attitude of bosnian serbs being peasants . 
  a lot of people in bosnia are peasants . 
  that 's the only sort of sentiment that could potentially fit the statement `` you guys do n't even want anything to do to them . '', 
  i assure you , public support is for a free rs . 
  nope . 
  if we 're going to use the argument that serbs should reclaim their historical lands , all serbs have a claim to that . 
  that 's how nation states work . 
  you people also think vojvodina is somehow going to ever separate from serbia . 
  you have no idea of what our cultural landscape really looks like . 
   you guys do n't even want anything to do to them . 
  what gave you that impression ? 
  the aid we gave them during the bosnian war ? 
  the help we gave refugees from parts of bosnia that were taken by the croats or bosniaks ? 
  the attitude that bosnian serbs are stupid peasants is only common among the haughty student class in belgrade , who nobody else likes in the country . 
  so if that 's the metric you 're going by , then belgrade serbs are n't real serbs . 
  you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  ah , the classic underhanded tactic of trying to balkanize serbs even further . 
  `` srbijanci '' and `` bosanci '' are not somehow magically different entities , friend . 
  bosnian ** serbs ** and serbian ** serbs ** have an important commonality , can you see what it is ? 
  sure , but if women do n't want to have kids that does n't mean men want to have kids . 
  in fact many men are quite opposed to sacrificing their own comfort to raise a child . 
  i blame it on individualism rather than anything else . 
  it 's not just the women , it 's a common trend within modern culture . 
  just look at reddit 's position on the matter in any thread where it comes up . 
  so many of these people going around enjoying their no kids / double income lifestyle , with no regard for the future of their country . 
  the economy 's been getting stronger year by year , i do n't know what you 're talking about . 
   salty about being poorer than the poorest eu country , and getting even poorer ? 
  that just is n't true at all . 
  first of all , i 'm not sure why you 're fixating so hard on the vegan point . 
  i feel like i 've sufficiently explained why that 's bad for us . 
  as to the rest of your post : as it is now : people with special skills leave serbia to work elsewhere . 
  as it would be with the eu : people with special skills leave serbia to work elsewhere . 
  your point is only relevant if eu accession would suddenly lead to the construction of advanced laboratories and factories throughout serbia , which would definitely never happen . 
  people would just leave more often , accelerating our demographic decline . 
  super !, 
  and i 'm from a country that was tyrannically subjugated for hundreds of years by a foreign power . 
  i do n't care how much i would get out of it , but i would never sell out that heritage . 
  the basis of the hungarian identity is great for you but i do n't see why i should base my own beliefs around someone else 's history . 
  as for the aero - portion of aerospace , [ we did have that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soko ) , until our economy collapsed after the wars . 
  now they make car parts . 
  disgraceful , but not something the eu would help with . 
  as for the - space portion of aerospace , we are not a large enough nation to gain any benefit from inclusion in the esa . 
  we would be sending funds and workers to europe and gaining minimal representation in proportion to investment . 
  frankly , i do n't give a damn about helping german and french and italian cosmonauts into space when the history books will have my country in there as a footnote at best . 
  we are a collectivist society and tend to look at foreign relations with regards to the group 's benefit , not the benefit of the individuals . 
  the fact that some small number of people might not get to do their dream jobs is too bad . 
  the whole society should n't have to bend over to accommodate this unfortunate minority of individuals . 
  yugoslavia made efforts in that sense , but even at its most secular , serbs were something like 60 % orthodox christian , with the rest being a split of nondenominational believers and atheists . 
  it never did go full-on state atheist like the ussr but religious people were occasionally persecuted , especially by the secret police right at the socialist regime 's inception . 
  there were families which hid their religious inclinations during the socialist rule , my mother 's family was like that . 
  we 're an ethnoreligious group . 
  it 's like how you can have secular jews - jews are defined by their religion and their heritage at the same time , but a jew who does n't follow judaism is still jewish . 
  much like that , an atheist serb is still a serb . 
  however , our identity is closely tied to our religion . 
  that 's what prevented all of us from getting assimilated by the turks - the muslim ottoman empire ruled all of serbia for 300 years , and some parts were theirs for 500 . 
  i had a long post addressing your points individually typed up and ready to go , but let 's just say you 're drastically underestimating certain aspects of my country . 
  that is besides the point . 
  let me address the basic issue at hand , and why i hold that position . 
  i have relatives in canada and they do n't have an easy life . 
  they 're overworked and overstressed . 
  this is how my uncle put it with regards to the difference between the systems : at the end of the day , you still have a house , a car , clothes , a phone , etc. , but in canada they are just of a higher quality . 
  rather than driving a vw golf you drive a midrange ford , rather than getting a two year old smartphone you get the newest model , and so on . 
  and you feel like you 're more stressed and overworked than ever to be able to afford this increase , and of course nobody in serbia believes you because they think you 're just ungrateful diaspora and they have it much harder than you . 
  i used to think that as well but i have now come to believe that it is a problem of attitude . 
  i do n't think serbia 's problem even is economy , though that is obviously not good - i think it is a general sense of jealousy and lack of satisfaction with what you have at any given moment , no matter what it is . 
  there are countries that are much worse off than we are , but they are much , much happier than us as well . 
  fix the economy all you like , that does n't fix the mindset . 
  statistically speaking , the economy has been getting better since 2008 specifically and since the end of the wars generally - but everyone thinks it 's getting worse !, 
  it 's a pessimistic mentality . 
  those fancy jobs ? 
  they are just ways to afford fancier things . 
  the vacations ? 
  even my poorest and most rural relatives go to montenegro to sunbathe every other year , and these people are honestly not too far above the poverty line . 
  it 's irrelevant , all of it . 
  if you need to be pampered to feel happy then that is unfortunate for you . 
  on the other hand , corruption is another problem entirely and a legitimate concern . 
  i just do n't feel it 's worth giving up our sovereignty and risking cultural assimilation to fix this one problem , serious as it is . 
  that ended up longer than i thought it would be . 
  huh, 
  `` living standards '' , given that serbia is n't some third-world hellhole where people die of hunger / thirst regularly , is essentially a codeword for materialism should take second place to moral strength . 
  enabling veganism is contrary to that goal . 
   oversensitive pathetic feel-good bullshit more directly , probably like 3/4 of our food has some combination of pork/beef/lamb in it , and the rest has dairy . 
  vegetarianism / veganism is an attack on our culture . 
  it would be like forcing the italians to stop eating grain products . 
  so are your migrants still rioting or what ? 
  see , this is how it starts . 
  everybody laughs that something like that could ever happen . 
  then , 50 years down the road , you 're [ seriously discussing decriminalization of pedophilia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daniel_cohn-bendit#on_paedophilia ) and [ legal prosecution of those who misgender transsexuals ] ( https://openparliament.ca/bills/42-1/c-16/ ) . 
  the slippery slope is not a fallacy , it is the worst-case scenario . 
  oh , sure , like letting bulgaria into the eu was anything other than political expedience . 
  glad to see you defend them even when they treat you like a second-class member . 
  of course it compromises the identity , how could it not ? 
  it allows the eu to push programs to raise some vague `` european '' identity above regional ones , as it is already doing in its member states and particularly in the west . 
  as i said , i do n't want to risk being in these conditions if at all possible . 
  notably this does n't require federalization to happen , it 's just that federalization is the ultimate step where we would become a province of a foreign power . 
  but of course even being in the eu as it stands now raises challenges . 
  the real problem there is the disappearance of sovereignty .
