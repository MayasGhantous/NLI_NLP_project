  and declining demographics should n't be sacrificing themselves in the name of burgeoning ones . 
  this is n't something a canadian would understand . 
  you can be an illiterate pakistani immigrant and still be considered a canadian , there 's no prerequisite to the identity aside from living there and feeling as though you 're canadian . 
  you can tell us our way is stupid , but it 's the way we do things . 
  serbs are the ones in charge of deciding who is serbian , and we do n't have any concept of civic nationalism . 
  `` organized religion is just another form of subjugation '' ... well yeah , but only if you consider * any form of moral limitations * to be subjugation . 
  we do n't see it as oppression , we see it as correct behaviour . 
  we owe our very existence to the orthodox church , and that 's not something that 's easily forgotten . 
  authority is n't a bad thing by default . 
  i did my undergraduate studies in toronto , so i have a feeling for the canadian mentality , and it 's simply not something that i can describe to you , you 've got a grudge against the concept that society should have any divisions at all , or that people should n't be able to behave however they please , or even that social cohesion is something to be concerned about . 
  serbs had enough of that mentality under the communists , it 's naive and unworkable in the long run . 
  serbs ca n't maintain their culture if they give up the practises and values associated with that culture . 
  that should be clear . 
  and do n't you dare compare the church to the muslims . 
  they stole our children and butchered us and incentivized cultural and religious conversion . 
  the church protected us then and it 's not doing anything like that now . 
  i ca n't speak to russia 's situation , but we have a similar problem . 
  the problem with the church lies in the fact that it can offer a job with a reliable income and automatic respect , so it attracts unsavoury characters , like law enforcement does in the us . 
  the communists period changed the church from the bastion of serbian identity and autonomy it had been under the ottomans and during the balkan wars to a very materialistic body , so now more than ever corruption is free to rule in the church hierarchy and as expected as it is in any other organization in serbia . 
  the actual faithful people tend to become monks and sequester themselves in distant monasteries , while the people who want a well-paying job tend to become preachers . 
  so the ones who give church services , like weddings and baptisms , to the general population tend to be the most corrupt . 
  when i was in belgrade i actually had a bit of trouble locating a respectable church to go to , which i had never encountered in rural serbia . 
  even atheist jews call themselves jewish . 
  just like that , the balkan ethnicities are basically all ethnoreligious groups . 
   you can also be macedonian if you 're an atheist ( perfectly acceptable ) , other type of christian ( acceptable but viewed with a bit of suspicion ) , from some exotic religion like hinduism or buddhism ( acceptable , but viewed as weird ) , etc. 
   however , you ca n't really be a macedonian if you 're muslim . 
  yes , this is basically how it is with serbs , except we ca n't really be catholic either , and anything aside from orthodoxy is suspect , even atheism . 
  but even most big-city leftist types would think that it is impossible to be a serbian muslim . 
  that said , we get along fairly well with the sandzak bosniaks ; but they 're clearly distinct from serbs . 
  atheists do n't have to be liberal , though , and can vote for policies like these regardless of religion , because they think it will combat degeneracy . 
  in fact , what 's happening in russia 's case is that conservatives are being pulled into religion because it is seen as the thing a proper traditionalist would do , the same way that liberals in the west were pulled out of religion it is a case of political views influencing religiosity as opposed to the opposite case . 
   yeah somehow interconnected economy is not deterrent from war this was literally one of the reasons given before wwi broke out as to why europe would never again see a massive war . 
  if it worked as a magical shield against conflict you 'd never see civil wars happen . 
  that said , military hegemony is n't a complete deterrent either , otherwise you 'd never see revolutions and insurgencies happen . 
  however it is unfair to underestimate the effect the presence of the american military has had - europe 's militaries would be bigger without it , and bigger militaries are investments that cry out to be used . 
  if anything , europe is at peace because wwii broke the west 's taste for war . 
  hey now , it 's alright , they can all be serbia if they want , 
  firstly , half of what you have mentioned is less relevant to eastern europe , and the colonialism aspect is completely absent . 
  secondly , it would still be a suicidal move , and therefore the crime is irrelevant because the `` punishment '' is inconceivable . 
  thirdly , as is demanded by these deeply-held beliefs of yours , in the name of ottoman imperialism in the balkans that has retarded the region 's development for the sake of turkish enrichment , ** gib reparations **, 
  wow , hey , i finally get to turn this one on someone else !, 
  * clears throat * ** whataboutism **, 
  better than [ europe united under german auspices ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/81/78/d0/8178d067dbf079f415921d3f8f417208.gif ), 
  so europe should accept responsibility for a continent of 1.2 billion people because we have higher living standards than them ? 
  * clears throat *, 
  the third government is the one that was involved in the civil war , and i would say that it is the relevant one in this discussion . 
  as far as i can tell , you are conflating the pre-war status of the republicans with the post-war status of the nationalists . 
  in reality the two sides radicalized over time , with the falange eclipsing the carlists ( who saw fascism as having socialist elements and actually opposed it as well ) , while stalinists became influential among the anti-fascists , as can be seen in orwell 's * homage to catalonia . 
  * because of the greater effectiveness of fascist support from germany and italy , as opposed to the aid sent by the international brigades and the ussr ( edit : not the only reason , but an important one ) , the nationalists won with the fascist element taking precedence . 
  but it is dishonest to compare the situation in the dictatorship with the situation in the preceding republic , because the radicalizing effect of the war itself had n't happened yet . 
  the popular front won the 1936 elections , and they were not right-wing , they were center-left at most . 
  they also had prominent factions spanning the whole spectrum of left-wing thought , from generic liberalism to communism . 
  the falange was only one nationalist faction , alongside generic conservatives and monarchists . 
  if their prominence means that all the nationalists can be labeled as fascists , then the central role of the workers ' union groups in the republican military effort means that all the republicans can be labeled as communists . 
  i do n't agree with that either , by the way , i think that it is too reductionist to label either side as one particular ideology . 
  i 'm not the one who is minimizing the influence of the cnt and ugt on the republican side , or the fact that the communist international specifically sent large amounts of volunteers to help them . 
   anti-communist propaganda as someone from an ex-communist state , please understand that nobody who lives in such countries wants communism to come back , and there is a reason for that . 
  i stand by the statement that fascism is still better than communism because it is more easily liberalized economically and it does n't promote entitlement and sloth . 
  spain is doing better than any european ex-communist country and chile and argentina are the most developed south american countries , despite their history of far-right rule . 
  it was a general left-wing vs. right-wing brawl . 
  and there were anarchocommunists on the republican side and fascists on the nationalist side , but neither side solely consisted of either ideology . 
  do n't shame others for being disinformed when you spread disinformation yourself . 
  until finally the continuous nature of society is lost and it all falls apart ? 
  really does make sense, 
  i hope socrealism never comes back to haunt us again, 
  and if you accept that the islamic civilization 's pressure on byzantium is the point at which christendom had to respond and unite to protect itself , then the crusades were defensive wars too . 
  by the way , the fourth crusade does n't erase the sociohistorical reality of * why * the crusades were a phenomenon in the first place . 
  wow , what a surprise to see an american defending interventionism . 
  of all the states that were affected by the arab spring , the only one that is any better off is tunisia . 
  syria is broken , libya is divided between three factions and rule of law is nonfunctional , egypt brought the muslim brotherhood to power and experienced a coup to remove them , and yemen is facing an islamic insurgency with saudi intervention . 
  the arab winter is in full swing because idealists in both the west and the middle east did not realize that western secular democracy is n't a one-size-fits-all utopian style of government suitable for all societies . 
   when he 's overthrown by radicals in twenty years because he 's locking up all the moderates now we 'll see how much good it does us . 
  the way these dictatorships work is that if you are opposed to the dictator , regardless of your political persuasion , you are put away . 
  it 's not because the moderates are all locked up that the radicals prevail , it 's because , in the power vacuum that arises after a dictator is weakened or removed , it is generally the extremists who have the will to take control . 
  iran is the way it is because the dictator failed , iraq is the way it is because the dictator failed , and syria is the way it is * because the dictator failed . 
  * iran has experienced a severe brain drain because of their theocratic flavour of government , the war in iraq only strengthened the anti-imperialist arguments of islamists , and syrian moderate rebels have either adopted extreme tenets or been overtaken by extremists themselves . 
  if international interest had been to actually maintain these regimes , the moderates would be much better off . 
  depending on your surroundings , that ship may have already sailed . 
  what ? 
  my experience is the converse , i 've never heard a single serb say that they were somehow mad at the annexation of crimea . 
  in fact everyone i 've talked to has been more angry at the west 's hypocrisy over crimea , because the situation is comparable to what they did in kosovo . 
  but realistically , most people here have n't trusted russia since they left us out to dry in the 90s . 
  we see them more as cultural compatriots if anything . 
  vucic has alleged multiple times that there will not even be a referendum , and we will simply join once we have closed all the chapters , though i 'm not sure whether that is actually possible . 
  but the fact of the matter remains that democracy is dead in serbia , the population is propagandized daily through state-controlled media outlets , and vote manipulation and voter apathy are rampant . 
  i think something like 700000 dead people were allowed to vote in the recent presidential election , and coincidentally they all voted for vucic . 
  he has used eu backing as a political bludgeon to tear down anyone who is n't part of his bloc . 
  while he is the leader , it is safe to assume that we will be entering europe when the time comes . 
  for some reason i have the impression that it is n't actually possible for slavs to not be eastern european, 
  because the bell tower is necessary for the church 's function , and the people who turned it back to a church were n't open-minded atheists like yourself ? 
  and the minaret is a sign of ottoman occupation ? 
  i sort of feel like my question is clearly more pertinent to the situation at hand, 
  well , `` monolithic constructions and walls made without mortar '' is n't quite the same thing as `` precision-engineered infrastructure that has lasted for thousands of years made without mortar '' . 
  that said , the chinese tomb of the first emperor is some amazing architecture . 
  apparently it had flowing mercury fountains . 
  the romans also had what was essentially a water-powered [ revolving restaurant . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/6243961/emperor-neros-rotating-dining-room-discovered.html ) fantastic culture . 
  so why keep the minaret ? 
  to be fair , minarets have to be tall to perform their function . 
  that said , for reasons aesthetic and acoustic , i * despise * minarets .
