  * ahem * whataboutism, 
  whataboutism does n't excuse anything , but it does mean you ca n't pretend to have the moral high ground when you yourself have blood on your hands , something i find americans are fond of doing loudly and often . 
  i know , right ? 
  how unreasonable to feel a connection to a country that prevented us from getting subjugated under the austrian heel in ~ ~ ww2 ~ ~ ww1 and that shares an ethnic , linguistic , cultural , and religious background with us . 
  absolutely insane . 
  edit : ww1 , not ww2, 
  if you look at trade figures , you realize serbia 's got a very close relationship with russia in terms of trade , amounting to billions of dollars per year . 
  not to mention the damages done during the bombing amount to 29.6 billion dollars , compared to which 643 million is pocket change . 
  \\  us bombs all our infrastructure \\  billions in damages \\  500 confirmed civilian casualties , between 1200-5700 speculated gee i wonder why anybody in serbia would hate the us, 
   there is no media censorship lmao, 
   serbia would be nothing but a leach and liability to the eu and nato shit , he guessed our plan, 
  yeah , because right after we sign a shitty agreement with nato basically * de jure * confirming the fact that we ca n't do anything about them violating our sovereignty , a serbian diplomat is killed in a us bombing . 
  people are being reminded of the `` accidental '' bombing of the chinese embassy during the kosovo intervention . 
  nobody in serbia likes nato anyways , i 'm surprised the government 's gotten away with this in the first place . 
  that said , russia is not the answer either . 
  i wish we could pull off switzerland-style neutrality , but unfortunately we do n't have the benefit of the alps . 
  i wish i could transplant serbia into the middle of the pacific ocean so everyone would leave us alone , i 'm tired of having to suck up to eu and nato, 
  \\ - your friendly local scot, 
  no we 're not fuck off ^ ^ / s, 
   today is all about feels  today as if anyone ever truly gave a shit about anything else, 
  trudoot trudoot thank mr. dank weed man, 
  serbs had an empire too . 
  for like 40 years , but i assure you we had one .

  dogs actually can not differentiate colour , so they literally do see in black-and-white . 
   djohan , kumar and latif no , not really, 
   do they know that the vlachs speak a language which is surprisingly similar to the romanian language ? 
  we do , we think they 're cool . 
  serbs like romanians and that extends to the vlachs . 
  serbian has the belgrade/beogradjanski accent , but that 's just snooty middle class . 
  all the other dialects are rural . 
  the closest you get to a posh accent is speaking with as close to no accent as possible . 
   load of broken crockery . 
  i just wanted to say i adore english phrases like this . 
  cultural relativism , as a concept , undermines the very foundations of any kind of moral system . 
  it gives outsiders a free pass out of punishment for actions natives would be apprehended for , discourages integration , and puts immigrants on a pedestal above natives , which clearly belies the concept of a just society . 
  it is an acceptable tool for objectively examining the past , but can not be used in the present without catastrophic consequences . 
  \\  implying that 's a bad thing, 
  of course , but they account for [ 29 % of the former yugoslavia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_socialist_federal_republic_of_yugoslavia#republics_by_population ) everywhere else , it 's worse . 
  well , my family actually held extensive properties in kosovo , including vineyards , farms and textile factories , during the prewar kingdoms of serbia and yugoslavia . 
  then the communists seized most of it after ww2 , and then after independence the the rest was vandalized ( arson by kosovar nationalists ) and we had to sell it off ( except for a little cottage near kamenica ) . 
  i take it personally . 
  edit : and that 's not even mentioning the destruction of serbian heritage in the region , nor the murders , beatings and other crimes committed against ethnic serbs . 
  and of course there 's the fact that kosovo was the heartland of serbia before the ethnic cleansing carried out by the ottoman regime turned it into a majority albanian area . 
  that last point 's pretty weak , i know - demographic shifts happen all the time - but it still bothers me . 
  thank you for your kind words  but the economy is pretty bad right now , and that 's what i was referring to . 
  migrants wo n't go somewhere where there 's no money for them . 
  oh no worries , i 'm currently studying in canada and it 's amazing to me how many people have this preconception and generally know very little about europe . 
  of course it 's a whole ocean away , so it 's understandable , but still . 
  it 's bad . 
  there 's a portion of the government that ca n't handle the fact that serbs are even 7 % of the population and basically screws with anything pro-conciliation leaders try to do , not to mention the kosovo serbs are still spiteful and doing their best to interfere in politics as well . 
  the government is corrupt and law enforcement outside of un zones and the major cities is basically nonexistent . 
  it 's better than it was right after the war but that does n't mean much ( the war ended in like 2000 but instability continues to this day ) . 
  this is almost exactly what i mean . 
  every country that used to be part of yugoslavia , except for slovenia and croatia , is worse off . 
  that 's the majority of the population of that former country now living in worse conditions . 
  / u/kuklachev is plainly incorrect . 
   better economical and political model of existence  same as what happened in yugoslavia sorry for the vulgarity but are you fucking high, 
   i think left-wing political thought will succeed in destroying any form of national identities , at least in western europe . 
  related to this i also believe whites will only make up around 50 % ( or less ) of the population in most countries , and most people will probably be mixed . 
  thank goodness my country is both too nationalistic and too shitty for this to happen, 
  i mean the balkans are at least a little bit better than syria . 
  right ? 
  serbia is third rome obviously,

   romanian  want the austro-hungarian back i think that 's where the confusion came from . 
  ahem, 
  they 're canadians who lie to themselves . 
  shitposting on reddit, 
   the crucial event in the destruction of rome was the concurrence of a rebellion in britannia and a german invasion of gaul . 
  not very similar to our situation in 2015 . 
  well , muslims are invading france and britain is rebelling again , so it actually is quite similar . 
  to clarify , i misunderstood what you said regarding her being decided against it . 
  i interpreted it as a claim that she was opposed to the charter , where in reality what was meant is that her appointment contradicts it . 
  i apologize , i am not a native speaker . 
  thanks for explaining what you meant . 
  however , what your point basically boils down to is that the minutiae of the royal succession prevent anyone who is n't part of the british royal family from becoming the canadian monarch , which should be self-evident - if anything , you would do better to argue about the unmeritocratic aspect of having a monarchy at all , rather than pinning your argument on this one inconsistency . 
  that said , in a country where the monarch is barely granted any influence , it does n't matter who 's the monarch ; in such a system , you could make an ashtray the head of state with no real repercussions . 
  besides , any canadian citizen can become the prime minister , who 's the real face of canada and actually holds power . 
  basically what i 'm asking is would the effort of changing the government actually be worth the result ? 
  since the * de facto * head of state is the prime minister , does the presence of the monarch - who , as a constitutional monarch , is actually subject to the will of the people rather than vice-versa ( the people are subjects of the crown , [ but the crown 's authority stems from the people ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monarchy_of_canada#federal_constitutional_role ) ) , and is a figurehead and plays a ceremonial role basically from birth - even really matter ? 
  why change something when the change wo n't have a practical effect ? 
  it seems like a waste of time and effort . 
  [ queen elizabeth ii signed that charter , and it was brought into effect under her rule . ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canadian_charter_of_rights_and_freedoms ) . 
  it 's ludicrous to say she 's against it . 
  can you give support for your claim that she 's `` decided against '' it ? 
   you give me a reason to keep the monarchy , because if getting rid of a dated system of discrimination is n't enough for you then what is ? 
  you have n't convinced me or provided any supporting evidence for the fact that the `` dated system of discrimination '' is real in any way , so i 'm having a hard time seeing a reason * not * to keep it . 
  i highly doubt your assertion that the system supports oppression , it seems to stem from a misunderstanding of what a monarchy is . 
  not all monarchies are founded on the idea that the leader is some perfect being who rules by divine decree ; [ wikipedia says that the canadian monarch has two personas , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monarchy_of_canada#personification_of_the_canadian_state ) one as the leader of the canadian state and another as a regular human being . 
  as for the citizenship thing , i understand the concern of wanting the head of state to have a canadian perspective if they are to rule the canadian people , but from what i understand , does n't the prime minister * de facto * rule the country ? 
  it does n't seem like it even matters , seeing as the monarch is more of a ceremonial role anyways . 
  ... are there any practical repercussions of the system being outdated , or is it just the spirit of the thing ? 
  your viewpoint comes off as wanting change for the sake of change , without much practical justification .
