  nobody calls it that because 1 . it 's basically dead and nobody outside the balkans even gives a shit and 2 . the us and uk , who armed and trained the organization , did not want to admit they were aiding terrorists , and did n't add it to their lists , [ though the un passed a resolution that described it as such . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_security_council_resolution_1160 ) france had it listed as a terrorist group and rescinded that status only after heavy lobbying . 
  more objective , less politically influential agencies still have it on their lists . 
  did they just assume that uav 's gender ?? 
   we need some unarmed dutch soldiers to prevent this ftfy, 
   it can and it did when it had 7 million serbs behind it backing it with police , military and government . 
  you keep trying to apply prewar conditions as justification for a postwar independence , after the situation had been entirely reversed . 
  this once again contradicts your stated desire to leave ethnic conflict in the past and embrace coexistence . 
  apparently this is only your opinion when the serbs are the ones who must acquiesce . 
   why are most doctors , judges , policemen , teachers and other officials in sandzak which is mostly bosniak - serbs ? 
  why are most people in the governmental apparatus of the serbian nation-state serbs ? 
  does this question need to be asked ? 
  i mean , judges , policemen and soldiers specifically sign up to enforce the government 's role , something that ethnic serbs would obviously be more likely to do . 
   why do bosniak children have to learn that they are `` cursed by god '' and `` filthy outcasts '' ? 
  can you link a source for this assertion that is n't from some nationalist bosniak news organization ? 
  the bosniaks had mujahideen fighting alongside them in the war , using [ this flag . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnian_mujahideen#/media/file:flag_of_jihad.svg ) the ustase literally have a grenade on [ their symbol . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usta%c5%a1e#/media/file:usta%c5%a1e_symbol.svg ) extremist groups do that kind of shit . 
  that 's patently ridiculous . 
  in fact it simply makes no sense from a practical standpoint . 
  how did the declaration of independence pass if the legislature was unjustly full of serbs ? 
  your allegations may have been true before the war , but they certainly were n't after it , when serbia gave up a lot of its effective sovereignty to the un mission and serbs were driven out by crime waves and reprisals . 
  no matter how you try and explain it , 2 % of the population can not control the other 98 % . 
  as for sandzak , bosniaks are currently 2 % of the country 's population but have 1.6 % of seats in parliament . 
  i think this is fair , considering that some bosniaks might support other parties for reasons unrelated to ethnicity . 
  in fact , having lived in bujanovac , i can tell you that albanians have had plenty of political rights even before the war broke out . 
  the kosovars seceded 10 years after the kosovo war , after any threat of extermination was long past , and they were the ones predominantly committing ethnic violence against serbs and serb heritage . 
  if you are against [ `` fanning the flames of ethnic hatred , '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/54s7zn/remember_the_republika_srpska_a_referendum_by/d84khcf ) how can you support kosovo 's independence ? 
  should n't they have tried to just get along , like you want the bosnian serbs to do ? 
  the thing is , it is n't that different from kosovo , and yet the west is treating it in almost the opposite manner . 
  the go-to argument is that ethnic cleansing should n't be legitimized , and since the non-serb inhabitants of republika srpska were displaced from their homes , granting the serbs independence would be tacitly approving of these methods . 
  the thing is , by this argument , very few ethnic groups have a real claim on their land , since violent displacement has been common throughout human history . 
  [ we have evidence of such actions dating back to 3500 bc . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prehistoric_warfare#bronze_age ) what 's more , serbs have lived there for centuries and were a majority as recently as 1965 , and they were also displaced in massive numbers from other areas of bosnia by the bosniak and croat forces . 
  they also have a claim on that land . 
  the formation of the current bosnia was defined by population exchanges and displacement among all three major ethnic groups . 
  kosovo itself witnessed a period of drastic serb emigration while it had an albanian-dominated legislature under the socialist government , in large part caused by discrimination against serbs by the albanian majority ( both of my grandmothers lived there as kids and had to relocate ) . 
  this does n't even mention the kla , an albanian terrorist group that committed violent acts against the local serbs [ and was funded and trained by the west ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_liberation_army#foreign_support ) ; their actions played a large role in inciting the kosovo war . 
  the traditional serbian defence for the atrocities committed by serb forces in that war is that they were acting against an illegal terrorist group , and serbs have argued against kosovo 's sovereignty on the grounds of it being an illegal act . 
  in the past the west has denounced this argument , stating that morals and democratic ideals are more important than the law - but when srpska has a referendum on a much less drastic measure ( having a national holiday specifically for bosnian serbs ) the [ us state department denounces the referendum as illegal and illegitimate  ( http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2016/09/262443.htm )  `` the united states condemns this illegal referendum and will support local institutions as they seek to hold the rs leadership accountable for undermining the rule of law and obstructing implementation of the dayton peace accords , '' toner said in the release on monday . 
  now more than ever it should be clear that the west is inconsistent and playing favourites in the balkans , despite the moral high ground they have claimed in the past . 
   mr putin 's backing for bosnian serb separatism is part of his strategy of sowing chaos in the eu this sentence is just funny to me . 
  last i checked , bosnia is n't part of the eu . 
  if kosovo 's independence was acceptable and desirable by the eu then why ca n't srpska do the same ? 
  hell , kosovo 's independence has probably caused more chaos due to all of the economic migrants that originate there . 
  * plays accordion *, 
  in all honesty i admit i probably should n't, 
  well , maybe if you make vaguely smug comments , people will be at a loss as to how they 're supposed to respond . 
  essentially if you do n't want people to project , do n't put up a blank screen . 
  excuse me , nobody asked for your privileged and frankly discriminatory opinion . 
  you 're benefiting from the fruits of bloody imperialism , while we were instead victims of it . 
  i find your statement intensely problematic and racist , and i really think you should stop this kind of xenophobic invective and victim-blaming . 
  all cultures are unique and equally beautiful . 
  i mean who are you , a white male , to tell me , a slav and a proud poc , what values i should be having ? 
  it 's very backwards , do n't you think ??? 
  ... that was me , behaving by the standard of 21st century europe . 
  at least 17th-century europe was n't a self-flagellating mess of fatalism and disgusting self-pity . 
  your religious wars [ killed eight million people . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty_years%27_war ) even with targeted policies of ethnic cleansing the yugoslav wars had maybe 150000 total casualties . 
  in places where people care about their national identity , without ethnically-based borders , you get constant ethnic friction . 
  in the balkans and in the middle east , for instance . 
  that 's the stated purpose , yes , but they 're great to eat just as candy . 
  everyone who tries them likes them - except a friend i have who 's hypersensitive to menthol . 
  the balkans have a lot of really delicious packaged candies , which do n't exist in the west , really . 
  in fact , that 's the chief reason i go to serb specialty stores . 
  it 's one of the worst ones possible . 
  although it 's not commonly used in angry invective so it sounds archaic if shouted in anger . 
  i get a kick out of giving [ negro candy ] ( http://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/n-ww20x/pqylo/products/236/images/461/negro_bombone__50637.1404698275.1280.1280.gif?c=2 ) to canadians and watching them get irrationally uncomfortable . 
   marriage fixers  serbian porn industry yep those are about as far from each other as you can get, 
  our younger generations are more conservative and euroskeptic than the older ones . 
  in serbia the cops have usually been way less dangerous to lgbt people than normal civilians . 
  without them this parade would have been attacked by rioters and broken down in violence or canceled altogether , as it has been in previous years . 
  this is the second year in a row things have gone off without a hitch , and it 's * entirely * due to the massive detachment of riot police surrounding them . 
  in this context , you have no basis for complaints . 
  be glad that lgbt people are even allowed this - if the political pendulum swings back towards euroskepticism ( highly possible , since our youth are more conservative and anti-eu than the older generations ) , you can expect this privilege to be discontinued . 
  maybe polan can not into space , but all space can into polan, 
  * beach view ??? 
  * finally serbia can into coastline !, 
  essentially , the only reason this went so well is because vucic wants the eu to like him . 
  so you 'd not just pretend to hold the new values , but also change your views and genuinely hold them ? 
  i 've had a pretty easy time with the former but i refuse to do the latter . 
  the point was to get a good education . 
  this was the only factor . 
   you are a prisoner of your own mind-set . 
  you ca n't rid yourselves of the ball and chain around your neck when you worship the very bloody thing . 
  `` haha just fit in and you wo n't be sad '' if you suddenly moved to the bible belt i bet you 'd become a born-again baptist , right ? 
  hockey players are not a significant proportion of the canadian population , friend . 
  this is about as spurious as my original post was . 
  i 've had no issues getting laid , but i do n't want to initiate a real relationship with canadian women . 
  i have friends as well , but they 're all slavs . 
  i do n't pursue relations with women on campus because , in today 's world , even if you behave perfectly properly some crazy woman might file a false rape accusation . 
  i could put in more effort and integrate more but that would go against my principles . 
  if this was saudi arabia or something you would n't expect it of me , would you ? 
  to be fair , the majority of my experience with canadian society has been within the bounds of the higher education system . 
  when i refer to canadian values i refer to strongly western values , which promote diversity , equality and fairness to the point of absurdity and compromising their own mission , and raising people 's feelings on an inviolable pedestal . 
  every year i 've been here , it 's been getting stronger . 
  that said , toronto is the real center of the country , and this kind of garbage has made it into parliament ( trudeau 's `` it 's 2015 '' comment and that shitty elbowing scandal ) so i now consider canadian values to be these , predominantly . 
  if i was talking about quebec or the maritimes or something i 'd be more specific . 
  i 've been living here for 3 years now , and as soon as i finish undergrad i 'm leaving . 
  it 's far too liberal for me .
