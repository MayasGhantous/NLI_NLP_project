no , he said he would go before anything in un was even being mentioned . 
  but then swiss authorities arrested naser oric , a bosnian muslim accused for war crimes and other criminal activities after the war . 
  both serbia and bosnia have cases against oric , but bosnian muslim president calls him a hero . 
  then bosnian muslim president of bosnia said that serbian pm is not welcome . 
  then swiss authorities extradited oric to bosnia , so bosnian muslim president said that serbian pm is again welcome to come . 
  and after all that this thing in un happened ... so it 's not that simple . 
  it 's never simple here . 
  alright , i am a dick and you are sincere . 
  i am sorry , i misunderstood you . 
  sincerely . 
  the issues are very complex and i am too tiered . 
  the fact is that being in a war and being exposed to propaganda 24/7 can mess you with your perception . 
  some things take time . 
  all sides in the region are working towards peace and normal relations and they are normal or almost normal for quite some time actually . 
  but what certainly wo n't bring peace and reconciliation to the region and what pisses me and probably most of the serbs off is generalization , collectivization of guilt and one-sided approach to victims and criminals . 
  that 's it , in short and without going into particulars . 
  i agree with you mostly . 
  i am not justifying anything . 
  all i am saying that victims on all sides should be treated with respect and not used for political reasons and criminals on all sides should be brought before the law . 
  you have a problem with that , not me . 
  it goes both ways . 
  i accept that karadzic and mladic are war criminals , just like oric . 
  you have a problem with it . 
  what ? 
  i am not denying anything ... 
  how people become so cynical like you ? 
  i do n't understand what are you trying to say . 
  when have i threatened to anyone , i do ' t understand ? 
  lol man you are seriously reaching and grasping for straws now . 
  first of all we started talking about present time , you said : `` there are many , many polls showing high levels of support . '', 
  that 's present tense , right ? 
  then you give me poll from 1995 . 
  are we talking about present time or what ? 
  and let 's take a look of that pool showing high support for milosevic in the year 1995 : `` the poll interviewed a sample of 2,000 people and its results are ' ** relatively reliable ** , ' suggested dragomir pantic , director of the social science institute of ** state-controlled belgrade university ** . '', 
  so director of a state controlled institute says that dictator of that state has the highest support among people in the war-time year of 1995 ? 
  yeah , i 'd trust him . 
  you do n't realize that milosevic and his regime controlled everything in serbia during the '90s , media , schools , police , you name it . 
  so this source is highly unreliable . 
  that ** one ** unreliable source does n't make anything `` clear '' as you stated . 
  and this goes to all those `` sources '' that you listed . 
  outdated and unreliable . 
  when you want to have serious discussion you can find me . 
  otherwise just arguing for arguing sake and being exposed to other peoples uninformed and cauvinistic views is not my thing , but thanks for trying . 
   was what happened at jasenovac genocide ? 
  no , the tragic truth is that what happened in jasenovac was n't officially declared as genocide . 
  do n't you see that as a problem ? 
  is n't that a bit fucked up ? 
  between 80 000 and 100 000 jews , serbs and roma killed in one camp along with thousands of others in other camps including women , children and elderly and it is n't officially declared a genocide . 
  and that 's what bothers most of the serbs . 
  so serbs from bosnia invaded bosnia ? 
  mladic , karadzic and oric are all monsters . 
  the difference here is that you call one of those monesters a hero , while i call them all monsters . 
   there are many , many polls showing high levels of support . 
  source please . 
  just saying `` many '' two times does n't make it more believable without sources . 
   it is clear that there has been widespread support for milosevic , mladic just saying something is `` clear '' does n't make it more believable without sources . 
  first define `` many '' . 
  secondly prove it buy reliable source , then we can talk . 
  also there are muslims that see naser oric as a hero or croats viewing ante pavelic as a hero ... so ? 
  that still does n't mean shit . 
  making general statement about one ethnicity based on what ** some ** people of particular ethnicity are doing or saying is just plain fucking wrong . 
  the important things is what governments and elected officials are doing at present time , not what kids write on the walls . 
   does labeling something a genocide make it worse than mass murder ? 
  i do n't care how it is called , i do care that he tried to defend it buy saying ndh killed only `` the enemies of the system '' . 
  like that makes it less horrible somehow . 
  that poll is from 2011 . 
  and here is a comment from head of cesid ( the organization that conducted the poll ) , commenting on the poeple who voted mladic as a hero : '' * but mr lucic says that experience shows that these people might be upset `` for a very short period : a day . '' * nice job omitting that quote . 
  maybe last elections held in serbia would be better indicator of general sentiment of serbian people , where the only party with radical views got 2.1 % of votes . 
  but eh who cares , let 's use selective source from 4 years ago , pull things out of the context and make conclusions . 
  anyway comparing wwii nazis and hitler with serbs and ratko mladic ( he is still on trial and officially not guilty of anything btw , not defending him , just saying . ), 
  is insulting to everyone . 
   they 're clearly supporting a war criminal . 
  they are minority and they have a freedom to wear and say whatever they like , unless it is call for violence . 
  there are people supporting all kinds of persons and ideologies all over the world . 
  what can you do ? 
  but explain please if serbs were killed only as enemies of the system , [ how were serbian children enemies of the system ? ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sisak_children's_concentration_camp ) . 
  and how that is n't a genocide and systematic killing ? 
   i hope you guys will join eu eventually . 
  how things are looking right now , i hope eu will still exist by the time we are ready to join . 
  yeah but in ndh serbs , jews and roma were treated equally horrible . 
  i can remove all quotes about jews from my above post and statements made buy ndh officials and it would still be obvious that there was systematic extermination of serbs conducted in ndh . 
  what 's tia ? 
  yours was hypothetical , mine was factual . 
  and mine had a point , what was the point of your comparison ? 
  that display of nazi symbols are banned in germany unless used in art and german state defines what 's art ? 
  we all know that , thanks . 
   is n't the same as wearing a t-shirt with someone 's face on , which is a clear act of approval . 
  some people aprove it , it still does n't prove shit . 
  there are neo-nazi and all kinds of radical organizations all around the world , with all kinds of hateful ideologies and it still does n't prove shit in regards to that particular nation , country , ethnicity , what have you . 
  yes , jews . 
  nazis killed jews all over europe , including croatia . 
  you did n't know that or what ? 
  yeah it 's good and it was really needed here . 
  they also said they will take care if something is considered `` street art '' , they will try to not remove it , but if it is something that instigates hate , they will remove it . 
  pretty awesome and pretty unexpected from our government . 
  :d the biggest problem here are stray dogs though . 
  : s we still do n't have proper services who take care of that ... 
   because those were selective killings of the system enemies ah sure and `` system enemies '' were jews and serbs , not selective at all ... * `` we will kill one third of all serbs . 
  we will deport another third , and the rest of them will be forced to convert to catholicism . 
  '' * * `` this country can only be a croatian country , and there is no method we would hesitate to use in order to make it truly croatian and cleanse it of serbs ... '' * '' * croatian people must be more alert than any other ethnic group to protect their racial purity ... we need to keep our blood clean of the jews '' * '' * judaism as one of the greatest enemies of the people '' .
