   would it be ironic if when putin goes we found out that he was actually the moderate . 
  this is what my nightmares are made of . 
  it 's a bloody disgrace that no one 's seen fit to at least put up some tents there . 
  if the current weather is anything to go by , these people are gon na freeze when autumn comes , let alone winter . 
  there are 1.8 million refugees in turkey . 
  how many more do you think they can handle ? 
  what about weed and wow ? 
  yes , obviously , that 's what they are paid for . 
  which leads to amusing things happening , like a very positive article about that cute russian girl that got the position of general prosecutor in crimea , followed the next day by a panicked article about putin 's spies everywhere controlling the whole world secretly for their own horrible fascist agenda , followed by an article glorifying some new russian military toy or something , followed by tits and clickbait stuff . 
  it 's amusing to watch , though not terribly informative . 
  we 've got a bunch of mercenaries with pens who write for the highest bidder and do n't really care either way , does that count as unbiased ? 
  well , no apocalypse today . 
  that 's about it . 
  100 $ says they do n't . 
  man , i know we 're marketed as a cheap labor force , but come on , this barely covers the cost of ammo . 
  it 's just not worth it . 
  i just say `` east of swaziland '' and let them have fun with it . 
  i always found it kinda hilarious that after centuries of ottoman rule , we sort of got up , drove them out , dusted off our jackets , looked at each other and said : `` right , now , what were we doing before these buggers invaded ? 
  oh , yeah , right . 
  to waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar ! '', 
  no , the 2nd story is actually number 1 . 
  forever , in any argument about anything , that story wins . 
  of course they 're unhappy , it 's summertime and they 're stuck in the uk . 
  i 'm sure some drones will fix that right up . 
  our parties do n't do solutions , only political points . 
  so far , the media i read have avoided going into any kind of frenzy , though i 'm sure the regular remove kebab papers have already declared this the end of our holy country and are expecting centuries of darkness and doom to come . 
  how about a dramatic voice saying : `` cars kill thousands of frenchmen each year . 
  but on this bastille day , it 's time for payback . '', 
  do n't quote me , but i think the pm said he would be resigning in january 2016 , with elections to follow, 
  it 's the full stop at the end . 
  increases the perceived seriousness of the comment by 53 % , scientifically proven . 
  yet . 
  neither did i , it was a joke . 
  you damn dirty racist . 
  edit : oh my god , it was a joke . 
  not really . 
  frequent exposure is important when learning a new language , and if there were any germans doing the same thing , i 'd certainly find it helpful . 
   retarded . 
  triggered !, 
  it 's also useful for people currently learning french . 
  yeah , convincing kids not to do something that feels good is really easy , cause they respond so well to rational arguments . 
  yeah , no . 
  man , that 's a good one . 
  right , but the target audience are hungarians worried about refugees . 
  i 'd say it 's because his political commentary is on the level of a 12-year old . 
  still , upvoted for being avdi\u0107 :d, 
  okay , so , that video is amazing and my life has been measurably improved with the simple act of watching it , unfortunately , drinking and doing stupid shit 's been overdone and overdone . 
  naked yelling or pitchforks , pick one . 
  well , apparently they won some bulgarian media abroad award in 2013 , so ... maybe ? 
  true , i suppose . 
  it occurs to me that estonians do n't really have a thing , should we let them have naked yelling and pitchforks ? 
  yeah , no brits managed to kill themselves by drunkenly falling off of petrovaradin during exit this year , so we 're auditioning other countries . 
  `` i hope you 've had a nice time here , but now please , be a good future collateral damage and go back to where you came from so we can watch your suffering from afar . '', 
  and soon after middle eastern !, 
  now that 's progress !,

  good at propaganda , great at marketing himself , useless at everything else . 
  i am supremely disappointed at the lack of epic lithuanian music to accompany this speech, 
  caught in a lamb sty, 
  i really need to start putting those / s , huh ? 
  nah , it 's the communists . 
  lucrative contracts ? 
   based in new york , eurasianet.org advocates open and informed discussion of issues that concern countries in the region . 
  technically , it is western media . 
  bah , sorceries and witchcrafts do n't count .

  a lot of people are going to earn a lot of money by pretending to be , though . 
  you know what the most tragic part is ? 
  the thing about killing muslims was just as much of a charade . 
  the man is the purest representation of a career politician , riding whichever wave he thinks will bring him popularity and keep him in power . 
  yeah , after `` takbir '' it 's pretty much just `` kill him !, 
  kill him ! '', 
  well , no one got killed , i 'd call that progress . 
  thank you people , that 's awesome . 
  great work , really . 
  now we get to listen to him whining about this for the rest of his life . 
  the policemen probably just figure they 're hopped up on shrooms , so they take appropriate action . 
  thanks !, 
  does the `` son '' suffix literally mean `` son '' ? 
  like , does johansson mean `` son of johan '' ? 
  last table : foo - bar . 
  love it . 
  he said he will . 
  then again , who the fuck knows , he might just decide to eat his own hair or climb on top of a city bus and lie face down or stay home and masturbate to ytong commercials while singing madonna 's material girl . 
  well , it 's from a book called `` signs by the roadside '' , a collection of general thoughts on life and the world , so , no real context . 
  considering a lot of his writing was about life under ottoman rule , it could be referring to that . 
  i 'd say he makes me want to cut myself , but really , i just want to cut him . 
  batty does n't cut it , he 's batshit fucking insane . 
   you got ta hand it to vucic , he 's good at controlling the media with 24h/day propaganda , while firmly steering serbia even deeper into the depths of hell itself . 
  ftfy . 
  i wish that one day , once i have a family , my feet too fuse together and form a giant scythe for reaping the souls of my enemies and sowing terror amongst the weak,

  because the commies could n't be bothered to actually gather evidence and do a fair trial , so they put on a show , took him out and shot him .
