  no one . 
  damn , nice to see the whole airforce in the air again . 
  * i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought , but world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones . 
  * apparently the answer is dank memes . 
  they did n't recognize kosovo and they 're buying stuff around here .

  that ended a lot better than i thought it would . 
  pls no, 
  i know man , i know , it was a joke . 
  something about you using the word `` nice '' just struck me as inherently funny . 
  cringe city . 
  thank you jack !, 
  but our princess is in another trench !, 
  stop crying , swords will be available in `` armaments of the east '' dlc, 
  is n't it ? 
  you 'll finally be able to relive the horrible death of tens of thousands of your countrymen in glorious first person hd !, 
  play through the greatest moments of the austro-hungarian military history in ww1 !, 
  experience the joy of getting lured into an enemy artillery training area and mauled to bits !, 
  starve to death in a besieged fortress while waiting for reinforcements that will never come !, 
  be amazed at our new physics engine as boulders crush your skulls in the endless expanse of the alps !, 
  what i meant to say is , i would n't use the word `` nice '' . 
  my nipples explode with delight !, 
  well how could they not ? 
  i mean it came from the west , the heart of all evil and darkness and the source of all the troubles in the world . 
  it 's just another form of demoncracy , after all . 
  * sent from my iphone 6 *,

  with this shipment in their hands , they probably can for another week or two . 
  unless imf decides to have a party . 
  other way around . 
  alright , thanks , now it makes a bit more sense . 
  i guess we 'll see how it turns out in the end .

  roman numerals do n't get a suffix when used as an ordinal number . 
  we were *, 
  that 's cause you 're not greek . 
  of course they do , but they 're like 2 or 3 months apart from each other . 
  plenty of time to recover from the last beating you got . 
  well how the hell are you supposed to lie to your parents when the schools pull shit like this ? 
  sure , you can blacklist the site on the router and on their phones when they fall asleep , but sneaking into their place of work and sabotaging the corporate network is far more work than any elementary school kid should be forced to do just to hide the fact they failed math . 
  willing to bet 20 euros there 's something a lot more nuts than a plagiarised dissertations market in russia .

  on a scale of 0 to 10 , how much do you feel a flat chart would have improved the appearance of data ?
