  it 'd be so nice to have a proper green party . 
  i think selling them without id is being phased out . 
  the politicians set goals and boundaries for the negotiating teams , though . 
  now , two months into the article 50 term , nobody still really knows what it is that the uk wants to achieve and where its red lines are . 
  the scottish independence is on hold until further notice , considering the result of the snp . 
  i do find this odd , as it 's not really a thing in serbia . 
  macedonia is not considered `` own '' in the way kosovo is . 
  a weird feeling , being in a full agreement with you . 
  in theory , denmark also has * something to do * with faroe islands . 
   i mean it 's not like i 'm going to buy a product just because it is .99 $ or .95 $ . 
  obviously they think a lot of people will . 
   we often talk about `` democracy by fax '' part of it do you also often talk about what you are getting in return ? 
  when you put it like that it sounds like a horribly shitty deal , but i assume it is not actually . 
  the attitude of the british seems to be that they regard losing any privilege that comes with membership as the eu punishing them . 
  would this also be the attitude of the norwegians in the case the eea gets renegotiated and both obligations and privileges become smaller ? 
  and another question , if i may , what could the eu do to start swinging the public opinion back ? 
   the change now is that when people are asked about eea or free-trade would you say people are aware of the difference , in a way most of the british seem not to be ? 
  nothing to excuse , i agree with your rant . 
  `` between hilltops '' would be a better translation then i guess . 
  me\u0111u is indeed between . 
  vr\u0161je seems to be archaic for `` hills '' , according to the other commenters . 
  so , between hills . 
  your guesswork is completely correct  while \u010d corresponds to dutch ` tsj ' . 
  your point here being ? 
  indeed . 
  good point . 
  fixed the parent comment . 
  i can see it being used as a teaching tool , for example . 
  a lot of foreigners do n't realise how easy serbian * cyrillic is to learn as there is always a corresponding latin letter , this might help . 
  well , it is a quote from a song ... 
  is it ? 
  not convinced . 
  let 's wait for the u/cookedpotato to resolve the mistery . 
   medjuvrsje it is actually me\u0111uvr\u0161je , but op is too lazy to set up keyboard settings properly , and thus scare good people of r/europe even more . 
  i think you misunderstood him . 
  he 's embarassed that he has never heard of the place * despite * being born in serbia . 
  well done . 
  seriously . 
  i do agree with that . 
  that 's a very * meh * way to enforce customs . 
  how would customs be enforced without a hard border ? 
  and it is the uk that wants separate customs . 
  there will be * an * fta . 
  it seems that we mostly agree while misunderstanding each other . 
  i specifically wrote * mass media and the internet * in my first comment . 
  tv is included there . 
  you do n't really have to be * for * something to spread awareness . 
  also , i doubt m\u00e9lenchon would be able to be this visible without the internet , for example . 
  hopefully they manage to get usher to change his mind . 
  thank mass media and the internet . 
  it would n't have been possible before , and it may be the one thing they are doing right . 
  why is that polishing the data ? 
  could it be that deteriorating relationship with russia might have contributed to that ? 
  or simply normal annual inflation ? 
  i 'm scrutinizing your claim due to there bing research that in other countries the introduction of the euro did n't actually cause higher food prices , as was widely believed , but there were other factors at play , [ page 236 ] ( https://books.google.nl/books?id=uhyhdaaaqbaj&amp;pg=pa236&amp;lpg=pa236&amp;dq=euro+higher+prices+research&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q0c0r9_iv2&amp;sig=rhkwloaxc4m6mqkrcqtpqdt-luk&amp;hl=sr&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewik_f3g5_htahvrc8akhwkdbiwq6aeiqzae#v=onepage&amp;q=euro%20higher%20prices%20research&amp;f=false ) . 
  anecdotally or actually ? 
   none done by our government . 
  because they know the results would require a change in politics which they really do n't want to do at the moment . 
  here is you implying that our government is pursuing eu membership . 
  not all sources are equal . 
  this one , however , is credible . 
   why would the government be really pro-eu when the people are n't ? 
  you implied that they are , not me . 
  when you do n't like the results , attack the source . 
  also , our government is n't really pro-eu , and they are doing exceptionally little to advance our membership . 
  again wrong . 
  there were multiple polls since 2012 , and they all return more or less the same result . 
  it is a dropping support , it 's not a steadily dropping one . 
  also taking 2003 as a start year is a bit misleading , the support is more or less the same since 2011 . 
  it 's not a thing to be proud of . 
  it is a thing that refutes your statement . 
  not a betting person , sorry . 
   a win-win-deal is always better than win-lose for everyone involved there is no win-win deal here . 
  both the eu and the uk will be worse off . 
  what can be attempted is minimising the damage , but that is all . 
  it 's a lose-lose in any case . 
   croats are not blocking us every chance they get ? 
  no they are not . 
  there are many things they could block us for , they choose not to . 
  the danube border , for example . 
   the support for eu has n't been steadily dropping since 2003 ? 
  no , the support had its ups and downs . 
  for example , in october 2011 it has [ been measured at 46 % ] ( http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=07&amp;nav_category=11&amp;nav_id=547726 ) . 
  there are many wrong things in that comment . 
  too many to even attempt a discussion . 
  less than 20 million even i think . 
  rounded to half-millions : * albania 3 * bosnia 3,5 * kosovo 2 * macedonia 2 * montenegro 0,5 * serbia 7 total : 18 million people . 
  slightly more than the netherlands , slightly fewer than romania . 
   a bit more effort from the eu on behalf of those who really wanted to stay ? 
  not exactly a big ask is it ? 
  actually it is a big ask . 
  i really want serbia to join the eu . 
  like , * really , really * . 
  should then i expect to be given a special treatment too ? 
  however , not all is lost and the proposal for the willing uk citizens to keep their eu rights is [ actually on the table ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-guy-verhofstadt-british-eu-citizenship-rights-europe-chief-negotiator-latest-a7621896.html ) . 
  it 's one of the many sad stories brexit will bring , and already is . 
  i know of a polish master 's graduate who decided against a phd path in england because she 's unsure what her status will be halfway during her studies . 
  except her story did n't get in papers . 
  i 'm sorry if this girl is angry at the eu , but maybe she should direct her anger at people at home , and maybe even try to do something about it . 
  it is the uk leaving the eu after all , not the other way round .
