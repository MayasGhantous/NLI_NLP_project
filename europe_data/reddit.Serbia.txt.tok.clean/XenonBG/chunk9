  programmers of all kinds are in demand .

  [ sigh ... ] ( http://ivinsvet.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/srbija-banana.gif ) thanks for the tip for the show , though . 
   well , he murderded thousands , and oppressed millions . 
  that he was better a murdered less than his contemporaries , does not make him a good guy . 
  it is important to note that the vast majority of people did not feel particularly oppressed . 
  they were aware that there was no free speech , but the relative well-being and freedoms they did enjoy ( free travel , for example ) , especially compared to the other eastern countries , were enough to compensate for that in people 's minds . 
  of course , this was before my time , i know only what my parents ' generation tells me . 
   how many of these are albanians though , considering that many of them get a serbian passport just to travel . 
  how does this work ? 
  afaik , serbian passports issued in kosovo are still not valid for schengen visa-free travel . 
  of course it is . 
  you can use english for much more things than serbian . 
  well , it 's not that secret anymore , is it now ? 
  indeed , i am aware of that . 
  but that is still 29 people making a decision about uranium production . 
  it is not difficult/expensive to lobby or buy 29 people . 
   15-14 majority in this looks like an awfully small amount of people to make such an important decision . 
  i usually do n't like joke parties , but there 's something different about this one . 
  i went through all the images on their fb page , they accent the education and youth of their members and candidates . 
  nothing wrong about that , i hope they are not in it fully just for lols . 
  also , for me personally it was very interesting to see * real * people of kosovo . 
  serbian media likes to ignore the fact that there are normal people living there . 
  the article was about germany , so i was curious . 
  just curious - do you include non-eu europeans in `` european immigrants '' group ? 
  does merkel ? 
  that depends on what you dislike about the eu . 
  if you are not a fan of the idea of european nations working together , then i am not sure that you belong here . 
  if you are not a fan of eu itself because of its many organizational flaws , then i think your voice should be heard here , on how things can be improved . 
  i 've seen people doing it , though , in porto . 
  i was left speechless . 
  you guys should market yourselves as a great place for * urban mountainbiking * , 
  i completely agree with you . 
  i see a state as a tool , a social construct that we have to make our lifes easier and achieving our goals more possible . 
  i believe in a united europe because i think that kind of state will achieve these goals better than all our tiny states crowded up and bickering on this continent . 
  but in the end , state is a tool . 
  it should not need grandiose ideals behind it , those are unnecessary and can even be dangerous . 
  it should just work . 
  they are very eager to make themselves heard of and known about . 
  with their oil money they financed the restoration of one of belgrade 's central parks . 
  caveat - the city was obliged to put a statue of their first leader in the park . 
  [ this is how it looks like . 
  ] ( http://gdb.rferl.org/cbfaac1f-8664-407f-a8e1-e85756510fa9_mw1024_n_s.jpg ) the caption says `` heydar aliev , national leader of azerbaijani people '' . 
   a lot of shops went bankrupt this year . 
  at this moment , in 2013 more shops went bankrupt than in all of 2012 . 
  online shops are , on the other hand , doing fine and are expected to increase their business in 2014 . 
  i am surprised , til . 
  i was in \u010cr last summer and it seemed to me like a place with a great wages vs. cost-of-living ratio . 
  it is even more surprising that slovakia is now doing better . 
  what are the reasons behind this ? 
  honestly , that is very hard to believe . 
  got some numbers to back it up ? 
  that depends on how you define iron curtain . 
  estonia , slovenia , czech republic, 
   thanks to non-citizen working-class migrants how can they vote if they 're not citizens ? 
  well it 's not like they 're insisting . 
  it 's your country 's policy to pursue accession . 
  you are joking , right ? 
  i ca n't really tell from the text . 
  it seems that they did hit a sweet spot with n9 and meego 1.2 . 
  if they kept pursuing that , maybe they would manage to remain afloat and prosper again . 
  maybe . 
  going with android would not have helped them . 
  samsung 's marketing is just too strong . 
   ( if i knew how to add an albanian flag i would ) on the top right of the page , under the subreddit name , there is a checkbox that says `` show my flair ... '' . 
  right under that , your user name is displayed , with ( edit ) after it . 
  click on that `` edit '' , select a flag . 
  that 's it  it means `` black mountain '' in ther language too . 
  montenegro is a place you want to visit . 
  it is the place about the size of flanders that has : * a [ beautiful seaside ] ( http://sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/282979_436902756380881_1649964898_n.jpg ) * wonderful [ mountains ] ( http://www.raftingmontenegro.com/slike/durmitor_001.jpg ) * some unique [ lakes ] ( http://www.durmitor.cz/media/durmitor/obrazky%20pro%20web/durmitor_crno_jezero.jpg ) * a fast [ river ] ( http://www.kompas-online.net/pages/individualtravel/sightseeingexcursions/balcan/images/tara_river.jpg ) that 's awesome for kayaking and rafting * ancient [ monasteries ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/ostrog01.jpg ) and [ monuments ] ( http://www.tif.co.me/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/lovcen.jpg ) * completely preserved [ historical town centres ] ( http://www.svevesti.com/images/sr/255555.jpg ) -- updated with pictures . 
  it is comparable to slovenia by the amount of touristic awesomeness cramped in a tiny territory . 
  some cons : * hard to reach ( two airports , but no low-cost airlines ) * hard to get around in ( dangerous roads , slow railroad , buses are the most viable option ) * if you are brave enough to opt for a train you get to see some really beautiful scenery , though * a very patriarchal society * intolerant , maybe even more than the rest of the balkans . 
  you really do n't want to be gay in montenegro * crime and mafia . 
  if a montenegrin has a large amount of money , chances are high that it is not completely legally obtained . 
   bosnia and herzegovina is eu candidate country . 
  in my opinion , this is very good . 
  this is , unfortunately , not true . 
  b&h is a * potential * candidate , and they still have some conditions to fulfill in order to be granted an actual candidate status . 
  currently their eu bid is basically on hold , due to their government 's ineptitude . 
  the interest seems to be so low , even here on / r/europe . 
  i wonder if it would make more sense to just use national elections to fill in europarliament seats as well . 
  nope , that is [ not true ] ( http://www.osjjzmaj.com/files/nastavni-program-za-1-i-2-razred.pdf ) . 
  latin script is taught in 2nd grade , like it has been for a long while now . 
  in [ serbia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbian_language#writing_system ) , for traditional reasons , cyrillic is the script of the administration and government . 
  however the standard language uses both cyrillic and latin . 
  in montenegro cyrillic and latin are completely equal and are both used . 
  how does one `` ban '' letters ? 
  eh , minsk is a city of 2 million , within a country with a functioning education system that produces people that can and want to do stuff . 
  if it is anything like belgrade during its time under dictator , there will always be * something * to do , events will be organized , activities will happen . 
  people are amazingly versatile . 
  and i would n't be surprised if a good number of belarussians ( sp ? ), 
  speak at least a basic english . 
  how would leaving europol help fight this ? 
  this sounds like a very definition of a problem that would be solved more easily with even tighter co-operation between european police forces . 
  i can send you one from serbia if you pm me the address . 
  add her name for a birthday wish in serbian , 
  the visa regime suggested would be for those officials only . 
  what an evil , marvelous idea , 
  and those digital pads are even worse . 
  what i scribble on those looks different every time , rendering it utterly pointless .
