  and there is no misunderstanding on who is who 's writer . 
  hope i answered your questions . 
  and sorry if i wrote too much . 
   and serbs have a balanced view ? 
  mostly . 
   you did n't mention any serb crimes commited towards albanians . 
  you and that other guy already did that like 7 times on this thread . 
  and this thread is about war criminal and terrorist hashim taci , and the involvement of kosovo political elite in war crimes and organ trafficking but somehow you guys always switch it to serbs ...  the un and eu insisted on establishing eulex in kosovo for dealing with war criminals , so any complain you have you can throw it at their direction . 
  oh it 's never your fault , it 's always someone else ... of course i blame the eu and usa , kosovo was a fuck up of gigantic proportions for everyone involved . 
  and they put few guys in prison ... and what about the 14 farmers who were killed 16 years ago on the fields , including a 17 year old boy ? 
  and the graves of those people keep being ruined each year ? 
  or the civillian bus full of passengers that was bombed 14 years ago and one of the victims being a 2 year old baby . 
  and other numerous crimes . 
  nobody arrested , nobody in jail . 
   that 's just you saying it , i have n't seen any denial . 
  i see it all the time . 
  even here and now . 
  what was the op and what we are talking about now ? 
  always changing the subject ...  yeah , how dare we try and stand against serbian propaganda . 
  again with the denial and blame serbs for everything ... seriously nobody buys this shit anymore ... what serbian propaganda ? 
  articles from wikipedia with relevant sources and article from regarded american and european news portals are serbian propaganda ? 
   century full of oppression lol , yeah ... yugoslavia was so oppressive that albanians fled from albania to yugoslavia . 
  the only oppression that was happening was from albanians to other ethnicities , just look at demograhpic hisotry of kosovo . 
  the number serbs , vlahs and roma just keeps falling since the world war 2 . 
  a bombed bus there and burned church here ... all while yugoslavia provided better living conditions to albanians , that they had them in albania . 
   punched from every direction by serbia . 
  again `` muh blame serbs '' ... how are you being punched by serbia ? 
  how ? 
  we just do n't recognize your independence . 
  serbia and half of the world does n't recognize it . 
  so what ? 
  you have your institutions , your politicians , your own foreign policy , your police , your economy , you have usa helping you , although truth be told they are kinda stopping , you have eulex ... you have a lot of stuff . 
  so how exactly is serbia preventing kosovo from not being a crime ridden piece of land with no economy except crime ? 
  and where only the rights of one ethnic group are respected , while everyone else lives in apartheid . 
   i live in south of mitrovica and if i dared to walk over the bridge to the north part i 'd be welcomed and beaten by a mob of serbs . 
  such would be the fate of any albanian walking into serb populated places in kosovo . 
  they are afraid that you will kill or rob someone then not go to jail . 
  like it already happened countless times before . 
  kosovo is a crime ridden ethnocracy whose population 's understanding of law is stuck in xv century kanun and is based on blood revenges and blood ties . 
  and you know it .

  the book is told as a collection of historical documents from various real and fictional characters about the secret organization that worships the bicycle and wants to shape the course of history . 
  in one chapter you have freud explaining the psychological significance of the bicycle , in next chapter you have sherlock holmes working on the bicycle case ... crazy book .

  my point is that most of the albanians here have unbalanced view , and tend to ignore the crimes commited by the people of their own ethnicity . 
  also while serbia , croatia and bosnia mostly put the war criminals in jail , albanians in kosovo did n't put a single person in jail for the war crimes . 
  also while most of the ex yu nations faced up with the crimes committed `` in their name '' and by the people of their ethnicity , albanians from kosovo did no such thing . 
  this constant state of denial and blaming serbs for everything lets the crimes against serbian civilians continue even to this day . 
  serbian elderly people get harassed , their homes broken into , farmers get terrorised on their farms , serbian churches and graves get desecrated and children of serbian ethnicity go to schools under police protection . 
  and nobody ever gets arrested and nobody ever goes to jail . 
  and then guys like you and your friends here dare to come here and talk about some kind of justice and `` racism '' towards albanians and have guts to compare your failed state of kosovo with other ex yu republics . 
  no children go to schools with police poretection in serbia , croatia and bosnia ... 
   cizma = boot ? 
  yep . 
   soba = fireplace ? 
  room . 
   tabla = metal sheet ? 
  more like a `` board '' . 
  but it can be used for few objects . 
  and how many of those were terrorist ? 
  how many civilians ? 
  did anyone in serbia went to prison for those war crimes ? 
  yes . 
  did any albanian went to prison for war crimes , ever ? 
  in the days after yugoslav forces withdrew from kosovo , over 200,000 homes that belonged to serbs were demolished by ethnic albanians with the help of the kla . 
  since the war ended , many graves containing the bodies of serbs have been desecrated by ethnic albanians . 
  ** no one has ever been brought to justice for these crimes . 
  ** during and after the kosovo conflict , a number of serbian orthodox churches have been destroyed at the hands of albanians . 
  during the kosovo war , over ** 90,000 ** serbian and other non-albanian refugees fled the war-torn province . 
  and in the days after the yugoslav army withdrew , over ** 200,000 ** serb and other non-albanians were forced from the province by kosovo albanians . 
  ** around 10 % of all kla insurgents engaged in fighting during the conflict were under the age of 18 , with some being as young as 13 ** . 
  the majority of them were 16 and 17 years old . 
  around 2 % were below the age of 16 . 
  these were mainly girls recruited to cook for the soldiers rather than to actually fight . 
  many non-albanians and albanians who collaborated with the yugoslavs were kidnapped by albanian militants and were taken across the border into albania where they were held , interrogated , tortured and in most cases killed . 
  several investigations into these camps have led to evidence detailing that several prisoners had their organs removed . 
   other regions were ignored by the west it seems . 
  ignored ? 
  poorly handled . 
  yep . 
  from that link : `` but the number of deaths continues to be disputed '' . 
  not sayin ' anything , just sayin ' ... and of course our friend forgot to mention [ this .

   when i buy electronics i always go to serbia because it is the cheapest .

  xd also clothes here are stupidly expensive , when on sale compared to western countries . 
  i was closesesest !, 
  what do i get ? 
  what do i get ? 
  do : \u0161argarepa , \u010dorba , bitanga , \u010dizma , ko\u010dija , lopta , pun\u0111a , soba , \u010dopor , tabla , \u0161ator or \u0161ogor sound familliar ? 
  but that still does n't show how overall the country is doing ?
