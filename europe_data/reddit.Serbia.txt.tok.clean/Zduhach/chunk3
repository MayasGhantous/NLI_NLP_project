  right ? 
  i mean look at greece . 
  i do n't know ... i make 2k euros and pay taxes for average wage , and when i get my tax it says average wage is around 430 euros ... but maybe that 's an average for the city , not for the whole country . 
  lol i suck at economy . 
   gdp ca n't be accurate because it is just an average but is n't average wage also average ? 
  you know if you have a person earning 2000 euros and other person earning 200 euros , their average is 1100 euros . 
  but that does n't tell you how rich or poor the country is , right ? 
  you have to look at the domestic product , external and internal debt etc. 
  i mean look at greece , they have big average wages compared to rest of the balkans , but their country is in total shit . 
  do n't mean to argue with you , i am seriously ignorant on this topic . 
  but i just think that average wage is not some kind of measure that determines how well the country is doing . 
  i also doubt that life is cheaper in serbia then in bosnia . 
  [ do n't know how accurate this is . 
  ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=serbia&amp;city1=belgrade&amp;country2=bosnia+and+herzegovina&amp;city2=sarajevo&amp;displaycurrency=eur ), 
  meh average wage does n't mean much . 
  it would be interesting to see if all those eulex paychecks were accounted in that average . 
  i guess you would probably want to look at gdp ppp per capita : kosovo - $ 9,570 albania - $ 11,700 macedonia - $ 10,718 bosnia - $ 9,800 serbia - $ 13,329 bulgaria - $ 17,869 but maybe that also is n't good measure ... 
  but they did n't put an end to it ... srebrenica happened and they did n't do anything for 4 years after that . 
  and accusing serbian government with the text that says this : `` republic of serbia officially denied any military engagement into bosnian war and croatian war for independence . '', 
  is pretty fucking funny . 
  i seriously doubt that albania and bulgaria are poorer then kosovo . 
  macedonia and bosnia maybe ... 
   he is imitating vucic . 
  how ? 
  [ vucic : bosniaks , serbs , croats should build common trust ] ( http://www.tanjug.rs/full-view_en.aspx?izb=190633 ) [ covic : past should be left to historians , we should look ahead ] ( http://www.tanjug.rs/full-view_en.aspx?izb=190641 ) [ izetbegovic : condemn all crimes , prosecute perpetrators ] ( http://www.tanjug.rs/full-view_en.aspx?izb=190647 ) [ vucic : serbia for closer economic cooperation with bih ] ( http://www.tanjug.rs/full-view_en.aspx?izb=190660 ), 
  yeah man ... in this region temperatures go that high now ... on sunday it was so hot i puked few times while being outside . 
  seriously . 
   the discussion . 
  what discussion ? 
  this spiral of insanity , irrationality , made-up words , unhinged sentence constructions that are hard to follow , metaphors that are understandable only to you and none else , historical revisions and ethnic stereotypes that you constantly display ? 
  you think that someone who uses words like : `` gayregional '' , `` political serb '' , compares young bosnia ( pan-slavic revolutionary movement ) with vojvodina ( fyi serbian voivodship , part of ah empire , recognized by the emperor ) , saying that both croatia and serbia statehood originated in 1943 ( yeah , there was nothing before 1943 ) and uses off the topic national stereotypes and `` insults '' deserves a serious discussion ? 
  no wonder you are banned from / r/croatia ... 
  oh no , a nationally colored remark based on a stereotype ... good jorb !, 
  you just broke the hearth of this gayregional nazi commie political serb . 
   what the crazy lousy fuck ?!?!?!?!, 
  what the crazy lousy fuck ? 
  your reply is best example of both crazy and lousy . 
  tito was `` politically serbian '' , andric was `` politically serbian '' and dezulovic is ** gayregional ** . 
  so every croat whose opinions you do n't share is either `` politically serbian '' or `` gayregional '' ? 
  and what the fuck do `` politically serbian ' and `` gayregional '' even mean ? 
  and that 's what my previous comment was all about . 
  the amount of denial in some poeple 's version of national identity is absurd . 
  you seriously do n't deserve any further discuision . 
   a central power could have provided the stability necessary to develop those traditions and civilization . 
  that was the point of kingdom of yugoslavia and later sfr yugoslavia . 
  after huge global power-shift , it stopped serving it 's purpose and the big powers that sponsored it 's formation and existence , then sponsored it 's break up . 
  and here we are . 
  same would happen if bulgaria was in it . 
  and i think it would be natural for bulgaria to be in , as it 's not fair calling something `` country of south slavs '' without bulgaria being a part of that country . 
   70 + years of serbia 's domination to the foreign policy of the balkans . 
  yeah with the dictator for life being a croat and with serbia being the only ex yugoslav republic that was split into autonomous provinces , just so balance would be made and serbia would n't dominate ... not to go even further back in time and mention how politics of the balkans were mostly determined by the relations of big empires austro-hungarian and ottoman , cause you know they actually ruled the balkan for a big chunk of millennium ... i am so sick of this `` muh serbian domination '' circlejerk , with no basis in reality . 
  and especially with some nations of former yugoslavia switching and twisting fact , historical context and doing mental gymnastics just so they can wash away and responsibility off of them selves and blame serbs . 
  even going so far as to call one of the greatest minds born in this region and a nobel prize winner `` politically serbian '' , even though he was a croat born in bosnia . 
  nah , the man who peered into south slavic soul and brought diamonds from the dark void , could n't be pan-slavic or yugoslav or serb by conviction , nah he was `` politically serbian '' . 
  all because among many things he said some thruts that are not pleasant to hear for some ears . 
  almost the same way `` young bosnia '' was a `` serbian terrorist organization '' even though it consisted of bosnian muslims , bosnian croats and bosnian serbs ... what 's next ? 
  are boris dezulovic and muharem bazdulj also `` politically serbian '' ? 
  i know there is no point in writing all of this , cause it is so ingrained in some peoples minds , that even now when yugoslavia does n't exist for 35 years , and when serbia does n't dominate it 's own fucking geographical space and foreign policy , that still does n't prevent some people to reject all personal responsibility and blame serbia for the current economical and political situation in their own independent countries ... grow the fuck up and learn to take some responsibility for your own fucking failures . 
  did you even watch the video ? 
  thank you . 
  really like paula rego 's works . 
  this year was phenomenal for serbian athletes : - under 20 football world champions . 
  - woman basketball european champions . 
  - men waterpolo world champions . 
  - men volleyball 2nd place in the world league . 
  - men under 20 basketball european champions . 
  - novak djokovic continuing his awesome performance on the tennis courts . 
  australian open and wimbledon titles this year and 55 consecutive weeks no . 
  1 in the world . 
  for such a small country this is pretty fucking impressive if i may say so my self . 
  i wish we could pay our external debts in medals . 
  thanks . 
  people here mentioned carlos paredes , he is already on my playlist . 
   news site ( youtube is shit in general ) . 
  on news sites and on youtube people are mostly either one of the two things : either very , very nationalistic or trolls who enjoy pissing people off . 
  here on reddit situation is a bit different . 
  for example , i do n't know if you visit / r/croatia and / r/serbia . 
  but if you visit you would notice that most of the regulars on those subs do n't post on / r/europe . 
  on / r/europe you mostly have diaspora and trolls . 
   thank you for taking the time to break it down in detail . 
  nice to see things are better than they appear . 
  sure man , you are welcome . 
  but you know what would be the best ? 
  do n't trust me on anyone else . 
  when you have time and money just come visit and see it for yourself . 
  peeew man thanks , there is some awesome music there . 
  you are right , i do n't really liked pimba and other lalala music . 
  but deolinda , dead combo and ornatos violeta are right up my alley . 
  and also tunas , could you please tell me are there some albums with this type of music or is it only performed live ? 
  few people here recommended me tunas , but they all posted youtube links with live performance and the sound quality is n't that great . 
  thanks once again man . 
   music : carlos paredes thanks man , this is awesome !, 
  thank you , will check it for sure . 
   i was actually under the impression that those movements were being reignited in the balkans as well during the 90 's , especialy in bosnia among the different etho groups there . 
  ah sure , sure there was that also . 
  but a lot of money and `` motivation '' came from abroad . 
   i am more interested in seeing , as an outsider , the southern slavs be more resilient force in modern day europe . 
  yes , me too . 
  and there is really a potential for that here . 
  a lot of awesome , smart , gifted people get born in these parts , but they all end up in canada , usa etc.
