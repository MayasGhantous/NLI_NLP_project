  what are the best portuguese traditional songs ? 
  how is portugal 's relationship to brazil and brazilian culture ? 
  lol sure ... i do n't care , you seem to be commenting only on the topics related to ex yu wars and you comment only in a hateful manner . 
  so whatever ... 
  he is bih/cro diaspora . 
  [ and having al-qaeda right in front of us , eu and un noses right there on the ground , and knowing how charity organizations were used to finance terrorism and not doing shit about it was also a very , very bad idea . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-qaeda_in_bosnia_and_herzegovina ), 
  sure , no problem . 
   do nazi serbs actually exist ? 
  yeah . 
  but there is so few of them and only in one city , that you can basically say they do n't exist . 
  there was some openly neo-nazi group few years ago here in serbia . 
  but the police busted them and the leader escaped from the country . 
  and i never heard of any neo-nazis since then . 
  but i do n't seriously understand these guys . 
  of course i do n't agree with their ideology , but just being a neo-nazi in serbia is very bad idea . 
  you are hated but everyone , by the liberals , by the serbian nationalist , by the fucking pensioners ... it 's not as being a neo-nazi in israel , but it is pretty fucking close . 
   croatian `` language purity '' yeah but croats do n't actually speak like that in everyday setting as i noticed . 
  and to clarify : i could understand it , but i could n't enjoy it . 
  :d you know , the sentence construction and choice of words was really different to what i am used to . 
  so i had to put some more mental power while reading . 
   tv and music you listened to - was it in official croatian or in a dialect ? 
  nedjeljom u dva , latinica , some sport events on hrt ... music : rundek , hladno pivo , edo maajka , tbf , dje\u010daci , vje\u0161tice ... so i guess a bit of standard and bit of dialect . 
  but i am sure i would n't understand a dude from dalmatia for example , while people from zagreb speak `` better serbian '' than people from ni\u0161 . 
  \u043do greek cyrillic ? 
   this really picks the most obscure words possible to replace words that are used in both languages . 
  yeah i notices this a lot . 
  while reading books and instructions in croatian the language sounds more strange . 
  but when i watch croatian tv or listen to the croatian music or when i go on / r/croatia the croatian language that is used sounds more natural to me . 
  i guess translators use the obscure words on purpose . 
   the croats do that to separate from serbs . 
  lol what are you talking about ? 
  latin alphabet is the same for croatian and serbian language . 
  and serbians uses both latin and cyrillic alphabets . 
  there are 3 constitutive ethnicities in bosnia : bosniak , croats and serbs . 
  there are also 3 official languages : bosnian , croatian and serbian . 
  ** o\u0161ve ** is in bosnian , croatian and serbian latin . 
  ** \u041e\u0448\u0432\u0435 ** is in serbian cyrillic . 
  the article has the name of the place in all three languages . 
  so what 's the point ? 
  this is like checking [ any city in switzerland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basel ) then being baffled why it has the name in german , french and italian ... 
   i think sensationalism should be avoided . 
  but it 's still a genuine security concern . 
  ah yeah completely agree . 
  bombastic headlines and unprofessional journalism wo n't help anyone and can just create serious problems . 
  i know huge majority of bosnian muslims are relaxed people . 
  but , on the other hand , these guys are not to be taken lightly , especially considering the economic situation and the recent wars , that is the perfect climate for fundamentalism . 
  and when you look at it , these people just make problems for other muslims in bosnia , more then to anyone else in the region . 
  i watched interview with belgrade mufti few months ago , and the interviewer asked him : `` these terrorists in bosnia pose the biggest threat to whom exactly ? 
  '' , and the mufti responds : `` to me and my people . '', 
   several terrorist attacks on the territory of bih . 
  there were several attacks in bosnia ? 
  i know only two : the guy in front of the us embassy ( not sure it was even an attack ? ), 
  and the guy that killed police officers recently ... were there more ? 
  i do n't get your point ? 
  meh ... to be fair : it goes both ways . 
  like one side being shitty more or less like the other side makes things alright , when actually it makes things double-shitty . 
  but anyway , a part from being a ridiculous argument , i sincerely do n't know what this guys is talking about . 
   sounds like perfect neighbors . 
  [ ah excellent , they can only get a bit loud when singin . 
  apart from that da bes neighbours eva . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_znvrk5kql4 ), 
  i guess it is probably a lot like when you hear your own recorded voice and you think : `` shit do i really sound like that ? 
  this is awful ! '', 
  anyway i ca n't rationally explain why i like finish accent . 
  i have watched a lot of interviews with sam lake and i follow youtube lper [ zemalaf ] ( https://youtu.be/4lkqkzfizcy?t=30 ) ... and i found it to be really relaxing , mellow and `` honest '' , all the weird pronunciation of the words , all those looooong vowels ... like a butter to my ears . 
   you have serbian nazis in such isolated regions as well . 
  lol ... 
  yaah finish also sounds the best to me too . 
  i would put it up there with portuguese on my list of languages i do n't understand but i like to hear . 
  maybe it just sounds nice to serbian ears ? 
  i also like [ finish accent ] ( https://youtu.be/ahdzuf-9ykm?t=28 ) while speaking english . 
  albanian farmer in bosnia ? ... well , yeah i guess at least one of those exists ... 
  i am not offended . 
  i 'm just joking . 
  after this ... i fear for all of us in that general area . 
  in theory : croatian , serbian and hungarian border patrols . 
  in practice : not much . 
   we 're rebuilding it again . 
  the contractors are happy . 
  ah the old do-one-thing-twice-throw-tax-money-down-the-hole-twice economy . 
  yeah we are running that program too . 
  ah yes , that was probably [ crazy maksa rokatanski ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9qyik5s.jpg?1 ) . 
  a local hero ... he does that sometimes . 
  meh on a second thought , nobody really needs or wants macedonia anymore . 
  macedonia is like a sexy girl from high school that everyone was crazy about . 
  then you meet her 10 years later and she is all trashy and has aids . 
  bulgaria , we should n't destroy [ what we have ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craiova_group ) over that whore . 
  ^ serbian ^ jew ^ doublebluff ^ mode ^ engaged, 
  we can split it 50/50 hellas brah ... just like the last time ^ o\u043fa !, 
  you get the half with the albanians ofc . 
  yellow wasp is haram :'(, 
  nah , most of them do n't speak a word of english . 
  heyhey novi sad ... well novi sad is a town built by serbian propaganda department just for tourists . 
  the rest of serbia is actually a war-torn wasteland full of angry tribes fighting over water and gassoline . 
  we wish we could accept all those refugees , but sadly we ca n't . 
   to transfer them to the serbian border as soon as possible . 
  why are you even trying to talk rationally with someone who uses phrases like : '' ** they ** are like this , ** they ** are like that '' ? 
  he is not even generalizing 1 nation , but 6 nations ... what 's the point talking to a bigot and a chauvinist . 
  especially the one coming from a little less shitty country and in some cases shittier country then the ones he is talking down to ?
