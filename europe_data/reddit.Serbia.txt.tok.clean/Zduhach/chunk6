  nah , serbia is not the ultimate goal for these poor people . 
  sure , some will stay , but big majority will just go around the fence ie . 
  trough bosnia and croatia , then to austria and beyond or alternative is through romania , then to hungary . 
  even if i do not agree , i can totally understand what and why hungarian government is doing this . 
  but this does n't change anything in the bigger picture . 
  and it looks very nice , finally i am able to see and feel wwii atmosphere irl . 
  oh please help us supreme romanian being .

  like in case of kosovo or croatia , slovenia etc. 
  before that ?

  ** little girl : ** frau merkel , frau merkel what will the santa claus bring me this year . 
  ** frau merkel : ** there is no santa claus , he does n't exist . 
  it is just a lie created by advertising companies to sell toys to little naive children like you . 
  also easter bunny does n't exist . 
  and one day your parents will die . 
  and then you will die too and everyone you love will also die . 
  and then you 'll rot in the ground and worms will eat your body . 
  ** little girl : ** buuuuuahhaaaaaaaa life is hell ... ** frau merkel : ** you speak german very , very well . 
  yeah almost like talking to a child ... 
   do n't know if i would like to eat a guy 's testicles , maybe they are tastier  just remember to hold them in marinade for 24 hours . 
  lol really ? 
  can you describe it ? 
  was it similar to anything else ? 
  i have never tried anything like that , but these guys from the video say testicles should be in the marinade for at least 24 hours . 
  probably to lose the nasty taste . 
  i also know when my mom prepares the liver she holds it few hours in milk , so it releases all the toxins and shit . 
  that 's probably the deal with those nastier parts ... maybe you just ate wrong guys testicles . 
  :p :d, 
  i do n't know , first start nice by complementing her on her goals and wishes . 
  saying that she totally understands the troubles her and her family and thousand of others are going trough then finishing of with something like `` situation is tough and complicated , but we are doing everything we can to help wonderful young people like you . 
  sometimes you ca n't help everyone , but you should n't give up on your hopes and goals . '', 
  there , telling the harsh truth while complimenting and encouraging that little girl . 
  i mean ffs merkel is a politician , bullshitting is in her job description . 
  this way it looked really awkward , insensitive , robotic and really ... i do n't know , inhuman ... and that attempt at consolation in the end ... jesus christ was that awkward ... edit : ffs a serbian dude explaining how to be sensitive and diplomatic ... europe what have you become ? 
  be more diplomatic and sensitive . 
  turn on the subtitles , watch till the end . . xd this sub is getting depressing ... 
   so you see it is not hypothetical . 
  he clerically says as response to karadzic `` either our way or you will disappear '' ... with `` because of this rhetoric we [ bosnian muslims ] do n't ; want maybe to be anymore in yugoslavia '' hey man please do n't think that i am defending karadzic or milosevic or anyone of those nationalistic retards . 
  but have in mind that not all serbs in serbia supported milosevic , there were huge anti-milosevic protests even before the war in serbia . 
  so simplifying and generalizing things like that : `` serbs wanted this '' is not fair , you know . 
   if serbia had support from western powers , surly it would end up differentl definitely , but i do n't think that would be the right solution either . 
  supporting any of the hotheaded nationalist that came to power in yugoslav republics was a wrong approach . 
  there would be war either way . 
   but in times when everyone was pushing their respective nationalistic agendas ; staying in federation made no sense yeah , fair point . 
   i assume you mean serbs here yes - . -  so the fact is that spc is opposing any attempt of autocephaly of both macedonians and montenigrians for no reason but because it clashes with their national interests . 
  eh ... i think there are historical reasons . 
  and it 's not like only serbian orthodox church does n't recognize montenegrin and macedonian churches , nobody else recognizes them . 
  but either way do n't want to go too deep into that as i am not too familiar with that subject . 
  ok , let 's say we basically agree on most points . 
   1989 - 90 % of albanians in kosovo wants independence  nope , ca n't do . 
   1991 - serbians in croatia ( 20 % ) and bosnia ( 33 % ) want independence hey man kosovo was not a republic in the same way as croatia and bosnia and it never was independent country . 
  so the correct formulation would be `` albanians in serbia '' , not `` albanians in kosovo '' . 
  and we get around 15 % of albanians in those days , not 90 % . 
  not saying anyone has or has n't the right for independence , just saying that your formulation is incorrect and that comparing kosovo and even bosnia to croatia makes no sense . 
  hey man i do n't want to argue with you as most of your points are hypothetical . 
  so i think there is really no point . 
  but that wo n't prevent me from expressing my hypothetical points :p . i think if there was a will for peaceful resolution there would be a way and there were already mechanisms to prevent one side from `` dominating '' , especially in case of croatia and slovenia staying in the union/confederation/whatever . 
  although i do n't even see that as problem with one side `` dominating '' , as this is normal in every country . 
  austria serves the intersts of majority austrians not of turks , serbs , albanians living there etc. 
  democracy is not balance , majority makes decisions . 
  but yeah i agree that what milosevic was doing was far from democracy , but i also think there were other solutions besides hasty declarations and recognitions of independencies that later led to war . 
  anyway basically what i want to say is the course of events that happened was the shittiest possible and that `` muh serb domination '' is just an excuse for abolishing democracy in the name of democracy , tribalism and general madness that happened . 
  i often hear how `` yugoslavia was serb dominated '' and how `` serbs made the majority of military elite '' etc. 
  well guess what ? 
  not only there were more military officers of serbian ethnicity , there was also more serbian bakers , more serbian hairdressers , more serbian shoemakers ... simply because there was more serbians then any other ethnicity in the former yugoslavia . 
  anyway i just want to address this as this is not hypothetical :  serbian orthodox church ( as voice of serbian national interest and staple of cultural identity ) does n't recognize both montenegrian and macedonian churches . 
  because ?? 
  because religion is not politics and church autonomy does n't have anything to do with state autonomy . 
  look for example vatican , all catholic churches are under jurisdiction of vatican , yet that does n't prevent american catholics , german catholics , spanish people , italians etc to have their own national identities . 
  so this argument is invalid . 
  religion is not democracy and various churches ca n't just `` declare independence '' based on geographical and political factors , there are canonical rules . 
  this is why you do n't have croatian orthodox church in croatia or serbian catholic church in serbia etc. 
  you are mixing apples and oranges , namely you are mixing rights and obligations . 
  using your logic we should abolish any kind of voting for anything as it is `` utterly stupid '' ... 
   because yugoslavia implied yugoslavia where it will only be the way serbia wanted while the will of other ethic groups are denied . 
  oh come on now ... 
  i 've read your comments , you sound like a cool , smart and funny dude .
