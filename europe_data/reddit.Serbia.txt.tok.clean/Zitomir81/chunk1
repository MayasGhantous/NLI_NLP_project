but you do n't have the [ flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/flag_of_the_serbian_empire%2c_byzantine_version.png ) or [ insignia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/serbian_cross.svg/2000px-serbian_cross.svg.png ), 
  there are two things you should n't do in serbia when you are on the power * ban pig meat because we will start a world war * ban smoking because we will overthrow the government, 
  i am getting bombed on the youtube , actually across the whole internet by the turkish tourist organization . 
  i think that croatia should ban the abortion and that it 's the good thing ^ ^ ^ more ^ ^ ^ money ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ us . 
  slobodan milosevic - free man gentle-fuck radovan karadzic - the one who `` happily scolds one '' , there is no really an english translation of grditi but scolds is probably the closest one , it 's in the sense of `` you fucked it up , you are a bad boy '' kind of scolding . 
  vladimir / putin - ruler of the world / roadwalker , in serbian he is `` peace owner '' but `` peace owner '' would be also true for more archaic russian . 
  edit : it could also be `` the one who controls the peace '', 
  well , even calling it serbo-croatian is wrong , eastern serbs , western bulgarians and macedonians speak same language . 
  just as kajkavian croats speak like slovenians . 
  montenegrins truly became the parody of the country . 
  we serbs , we are the strongest , you smrdijanci are pussies in the heart , you are all gypsies . 
  official language means learning one of them not all , knowing of serbian is not mandatory therefore documents are issued in one of the languages you know , the signs are also on the minority languages and television + radio . 
  also we plan on adding english as `` the lesser official language '' which means that documents could be issued on english but it 's not mandatory to have signs and other things on english too . 
   sava\u015f is also a given name ( male ) . 
  ratko mladic - young boy warrior, 
  we have similar `` god is far on the sky and russia is far on the east '' , it was about austrians and germans . 
  nothing will really happen , serbia will just stand as the same corrupted shithole it was . 
  this is much better drama than the hero of feketic, 
  based mirko, 
  pretty much this . 
   `` is the way putin walks part of his heritage from kgb days ? '', 
  those news came from the netherlands and were cited by the whole world , he is more popular in the west .

   who the fuck is this new guy ? 
  and sandzak and subotica, 
   does serbia need to exist ? 
  vojvodina given to hungary , sand\u017eak given to bosnia , pre\u0161evo to kosovo , ni\u0161 to bulgaria , and \u0160umadija and belgrade can throw a party . 
  do n't worry , the big ones already plan on breaking those regions from serbia . 
  hhaha , check out celebration in [ belgrade ] ( http://www.makabijada.com/images/bgdknez.jpg ), 
   and they are n't even here ( i see no montenegrin flags ) they just post under serbian flags .

  guess why [ -- ] official representative of the flemish people on / r/europejebusgobson 7 points an hour ago because they dislike the english too ? 
  i just gave you the explanation , on the balkans everyone hates everyone and the landscape scenery even through different is still completely the same from his text given that both are highlander places . 
   picturesque mountains balkan means `` mountains ''  beautiful scenery kinda  brave men our bravery comes from our stupidity , we are not brave  honest and stunning women do n't know about beauty but our bmi is among the lowest in the europe and that we are as tall as the dutch .

  well most of the bosniaks i think emigrate to slovenia , i think that slovenia is second next to serbia when it comes to the serbs . 
  look for their fathers . 
  they look for the jobs . 
  and what slovenians do in bosnia ? 
  to tell one joke i know , got told by some bosniak friend . 
  what bosnians do in slovenia ? 
   and in which hotel will you be staying ? 
  funny , that 's the joke about montenegrins here . 
  here is one multicultural from serbia 4 gypsies steal a bathtub , a cop sees that and pulls the gun shooting and killing one gypsy . 
  skinhead goes out of the bathtub `` you idiot , you blew my tire ! '',

   but there were no ( at least to my knowledge ) jokes about macedonians . 
  you could say the same thing about slovenians , i do n't know a single joke about slovenians . 
  on the other hand we do have jokes about torlakians ( this includes both , serbs and macedonians but excluding bulgarians , we have none about them ) . 
  edit : actually i know one joke about slovenians and that 's all . 
  during the 90s the croatian export was at all times high , their most successful products were tractors and white goods . 
  it was surpassed by serbia after 2000 , serbia 's main export became war criminals . 
  also this [ joke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys9oitzrktm ), 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ visibaba ^ ^ ^ ^ u ^ ^ ^ ^ wc-u, 
  well , we can put your picture on the poles and into newspaper politika . 
  when you buy meat in the balkans at the butcher-shop ( mesara ) seller usually asks you `` do you want with bones or without ? '' . 
  in srebrenica the landowners ask you the same question . 
  world health organization sent their medicine scientists to kosovo , they found that kosovo serbs almost never get one disease ^ ^ ^ ^ kidney ^ ^ ^ ^ stones . 
  nah , it 's just that her clit/clitoris got stuck in the chains . 
  here is something for you , why did grandma fell from the bicycle ? 
  they glow in the dark ... depleted uranium joke , since nato dropped a lot of it into kosovo fighting us . 
  why ca n't albanian children play hide & seek in the night ? 
  we do n't need to do that , their existence is the joke of nature . 
  we should kinda legalize that here too , it 's already happening since long time ago . 
  well , the next member that will join the eu is montenegro and i am pretty sure that milo is president for life and that he even assassinates people in the opposition from time to time . 
  eu is truly the bastion of democracy and morals . 
  imagine if we did that , we would be bombed again . 
  actually it 's much more complex than that . 
  while slovenia is generally more conservative in this question , serbia was rated the worst on the balkans when it comes to the `` acceptance of the foreigners '' but strangely was rated among the best in acceptance of gay people with bad thing having the most extreme political minority ( neo-nazis and ultra-nationalists ) so the chance of getting beaten is highest in serbia . 
  also the funny thing about serbia is that a good deal of neo-nazi organization leaders actually came out of the closet ( no , it 's not a joke ) . 
  eu once did the research of gay acceptance in the balkans ( not by the laws but by the general population ) , the results are kinda shocking , the slovenia was actually rated the worst . 
   milosevic and his legacy is long gone and well dead in montenegro . 
  milosevic 's legacy called milo is entering nato , you can also look that from different side . 
  it 's kinda the irony , is n't it , that the dps in montenegro and sps in serbia are actually the parties for the eu ? 
  enclaves are not protected . 
  i do n't get why this is a news , if you are too stupid to live with the albanians then you should be responsible for what happens to you . 
  milo will let him out in a couple of days , he is his man after-all . 
  it 's just that they are near nato and want to silence the opposition . 
  who gives a fuck . 
  the source is novi standard which means that the source of information come from belgrade, 
   living south of mitrovica are these people insane ? 
  than i mixed you with another slovak . 
  when i said what would happen you called me stupid , given that i am right and you are wrong i must say that you are pretty naive . 
  even worse thing is that you are a politician , a naive one . 
  i picked albania, 
  the reaction of pocuca wondering if he should help her is priceless . 
  [ check for yourself ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku6cxloup7c ), 
  their government already decided , it 's up to nato if they will accept them or not . 
  what 's funny is that i am dead serious . 
   firstly nato does n't have any duty to protect a country from itself and this is where the macedonians wonder `` then for what the fuck do we need nato ? 
  '' , the only ones who pose a real threat to them are albanians . 
  nato is telling macedonia to join nato so that they have the protection from the civil wars .
