  yup !,

  that militia is looking old , tired and out of shape , 
   we think a lot of fucked up shit is normal for you guys . 
  you can also say this about the people of the united states . 
  * god 's will *, 
  middle east would be a lot more peaceful if there was no israel . 
  i do n't mean if there was no jews there , but if state of israel did not exist .

  a few years ago i was in nessebar , bulgaria . 
  there i met a girl from slovakia . 
  she did not talk much about slovakia , she talked about a very nice plum brandy , which she brought with her to my room . 
  her dad gave her a bottle to take on the trip . 
  we drank a whole bottle and spent a beautiful night together . 
  since then , i love slovakia and everything about it !, 
  i hope edita sometimes think of me ... :') so , i know they make good homemade plum brandy , and have beautiful girls who love to drink . 
  \u0410lso , the language is remarkably similar to serbian .

  good point \u010cmaroje !, 
  thanks !, 
  not too many people can confirm or deny this because not to many people want to live there . 
  for many , all that is not food is a luxury . 
  since the nineties until now there is little change for the better , in terms of living standards . 
  in this sense , the global economy does not affect us . 
  sometimes it 's better , sometimes worse . 
  in serbia , it 's always worse . 
  [ thanks !, 
  here 's one in return !,

  collapsing of yugoslavia started in kosovo ... vojvodina lost her autonomy because of kosovo . 
  it 's heartland of the serbian nationalism . 
  but kosovo is slowly but surely getting forgotten , nobody in serbia really cares about kosovo . 
  yelling , writing graffiti and commenting online `` kosovo is serbia '' is only way majority of people fights for kosovo . 
  nobody will do anything else , especially people who speak loudly about serbian kosovo ... serbian nationalistic beast have new enemy - vojvodina . 
  and the beast is hungry !, 
  as a gypsy , i say none !, 
  everywhere is hard to assimilate . 
  world economy does n't have influence in serbia . 
  living conditions were always kinda shitty here . 
  we 're just happy when there 's a peace , but not all of us !, 
  their parents and `` community '' do n't give them chanse ... 
  majority of the gypsies in the balkans are just the way he described them . 
  even worse !, 
  no east european country would become member of the eu if the `` big boys '' do not have any interest ... 
  [ far away !,

  serbia do n't need minorities , minorities needs serbia !, 
  orthodox taliban think that in this way they defend the country and its `` traditional values '' . 
  i am against the parade . 
  state is unable and uninterested in protecting gays . 
  frustrated young people will just find a nice way to channel their anger and once again humiliate serbia in the eyes of the west .

  try to deliver outside urban areas next time . 
   shiraz tariq was supposedly being protected for years by the danish security and intelligence service known as pet . 
  why ? 
  [ belgrado today ] ( http://novosti.rs/upload/images/2013//02/04n/kult-generalstab.jpg ), 
  backbone would be nice ... :(, 
  no , not really . 
  because of weapons of mass destruction in iraq . 
  and for example , on the other side of the world we have north korea that has such a weapon , it has threatened to attack the united states and its allies , human rights are non-existent . 
  but , they do not have oil so they are safe from the us-led invasion . 
  that is why i do not believe that any invasion in iran has anything to do with weapons ... 
  its not popular here hate the united states , many people do not consider the u.s. the good guys . 
  hence the confusion ... 
  tensions between any country and the u.s. is largely due to the country 's oil . 
  it is also the case with iran . 
  only a naive person might think something else . 
  and those who hate the united states do not hate for no reason . 
  who does like bullies ? 
  also , the eu has a more aggressive sanctions . 
  but who is more aggressive than the u.s. in military terms ? 
  no one !, 
   the tensions with iran right now are not due to them accepting multiple currencies for their oil . 
  soon , iran is going to accept american freedom for their oil ... 
  they have biggest parlament building in the world . 
  edit : also , my favorite porn star is born there .

  serbs did not shot at eulex because of some rebellion , i bet that was an armed conflict between the criminals and customs .

  he did not receive the nobel peace prize . 
  he he he, 
  kosovo is serbia again !, 
  i think it 's all about toppling assad 's regime . 
  imagine if they find solid evidence of use of the chemical weapons . 
  only , it was the so called `` rebels '' using them . 
  i wonder would usa want to intervene in that case ? 
  yeah ... 
  i do n't think that there is some noble cause that usa and their lapdog countries want to accomplish . 
  it would be naive to believe so . 
  and `` intervention '' is not the right word , i would call it `` invasion '' and `` occupation '', 
  this is how you create terrorists . 
  they 're outnumbered and outgunned , only way for them to fight such strong enemy is detonating bomb in bus , train , marathon in enemy 's country . 
  usa and france should not be surprised when their citizens start dying . 
  also , i know that usa invading some country almost always have something to do with drugs and oil , but i do n't understand what is french interest in starting war . 
  it 's not human rights , if that 's the case , north korea and saudi arabia would be invaded long time ago ... 
  democracy is actually corporate monarchy .
