limes , my man !, 
  of course i was complaining . 
  of course nato made it all worse , because most of the war crimes happened * after * the bombing campaign started . 
  it was n't all roses before the war , but hey , you had a terrorist organization back then trying to break away from the country . 
  they were killing serbian police officers and soldiers , but also civilians and anyone who opposed to them ( lake radonji\u0107 massacre ) . 
  the serbian army retaliated , but there was no ethnic cleansing in , say , 1988 . 
  and you were inviting enlightened debate in that thread with your remarks ? 
  yes , i remember you were very civil . 
  yeah , go ahead and compare dresden with , say , novi sad , and therefore nazis with serbs . 
  that 's just inane , the amount of war crimes is simply incomparable between the two . 
  what ? 
  where did i downplay the actions of milosevic , or claimed that he did n't have to be stopped ? 
  since you took the time to reply to a couple of my comments ... 
  i 'm well aware that there were many crimes on our side , that 's why many serbian politicians and generals were sent to hague . 
  however , no one is talking shit about kla . 
  zmijojed provided a list of links , so let me ask you , who 's responsible for those massacres ? 
  you ca n't just let it slide . 
  and nato mission was a disgrace . 
  hell , they bombed [ civilian bridges ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varvarin#nato_attack ) , they bombed [ albanian convoys ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_albanian_refugees_near_%c4%90akovica ) , killing more than seventy people , but that was an accident ** lol ** , let 's move on , they used depleted uranium , cluster bombs , and if you still think s ` all good , get your head examined . 
  my head is fine , i know serbian paramilitary troops were acting like beasts in kosovo , i know milosevic was a nationalistic bastard , but that does n't mean we 're the only bad guys . 
  time will tell , i guess . 
  kosovo will have to deal with some pretty heavy accusations , like organ trafficking for example . 
  and they bombed a bridge in [ varvarin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varvarin#nato_attack ) , killing ten people . 
  what 's that you say , the risk of civilian death is low ? 
  are you questioning nato ?!?!?!, 
  do n't you know nato is like god , it moves in mysterious ways . 
  yes , in fact you do need the court . 
  the number of albanian victims is up to debate , because it is somewhere between 3,000 and 10,533 . 
  now , that 's a large scale , do n't you think ? 
  and before i forget , that information is from wikipedia , since y' all like to link from there . 
  no man , we do n't talk about casualties on the serbian side , it has to be black and white !, 
  bring on the downvotes . 
  pretend ? 
  i admitted there were crimes and atrocities , you moron . 
  so , you already know there 's been a genocide in croatia ? 
  there 's is an ongoing trial , still no results , but you already know it 's a genocide ? 
  as for kosovo , i only corrected you when it comes to labeling it a genocide , i never said there were no crimes . 
  as for your tone towards the end , wow . 
  you 're not really capable of having a discussion , are you ? 
  i wo n't get down to your level . 
  what genocide are you referring to ? 
  please provide a source . 
  yes , there was ethnic cleansing in kosovo , but there was no genocide . 
  do n't just throw that term around . 
  it 's logistics and what 's that other thing , prevention ? 
  that 's how the west sees it , right ? 
  i feel so better now . 
  novi sad is about 500 kilometers away from pristina , so there * must * be a flow of goods coming from that city , let 's destroy the bridges and refineries and radio television novi sad and everything that gets in the way !, 
  in that case , please explain why nato would bomb the whole country , when the army is based in the south and * the conflict is in kosovo , * not vojvodina or some place else . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/krw9o2l.jpg ) is rainbow bridge . 
  it looks decent enough , but it shames in comparison to [ varadin bridge ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pvlurdu.jpg ) . 
  [ liberty bridge ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0zvz9qc.jpg ) has been rebuilt . 
  and finally , zezelj bridge is expected to look something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bcqszbh.jpg ) . 
  at least 2,500 . 
  take a look at [ this article ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=24&amp;nav_id=89740 ) for more details . 
  i do n't know unfortunately . 
  with a weather girl like her , your chances of being annexed by monaco do n't look so grim . 
  surname of the weather girl , anyone ? 
   i ` ts like accusing the ally army for commiting crimes against the nazis . 
  what a stupid comparison . 
  i guess kla was the ally army here , right . 
  :') thank you for amusing me . 
   removal of almost a million people in an ethnic cleanisng operation that number is highly inflated . 
  still , we have taken our share of the blame , since many serbian officials were charged with crimes against humanity . 
  what about albanians in the hague , are they all completely innocent ? 
  haradinaj and the lot , they 're the good guys ? 
   albanians involved in the drug dealing business contributed their 3 % ( or more ) just like everyone else oh , so it 's ok then , it was for the right cause ? 
  drug money , organ trafficking , it does n't really matter as long as we 're fighting for independence ? 
  you say `` it 's easy to throw mud , '' like i 'm attacking something holy here , and not a terrorist organization kla really is . 
  i can only hope john clint williamson will come up with some results in his ongoing investigation about the crimes committed on the albanian side . 
  i 'm pretty sure there were some . 
  i 'm not denying that kosovo wanted to be independent for quite some time , but * it is a fact * that it was a province and a part of serbia before 2008 . 
  to be clear , i 'm not saying that kosovo and crimea are the same . 
  however , what troubles me here is this part :  there has been no ethnic cleansing , no mass murder or centralized and systematic violence [ in crimea ] indicating that such crimes only happened on serbian side . 
  how wrong you are . 
  kla was seen as a terrorist organization even by cia , funded by drug money and who knows what else . 
  there were crimes on both sides . 
  when albanians saw they were not getting their independence freely , they got violent . 
  many serbian police officers and civilians were killed at the time ( before ra\u010dak massacre ) . 
  and later on , when the west supported them , they started committing crimes against humanity . 
  why ca n't [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_unrest_in_kosovo ) be called ethnic cleansing ? 
  how do you explain that ? 
  was it the right thing to do from this perspective ? 
  let 's just wait and see . 
  i 'm kinda skeptical when it comes to that , because every time a province/country breaks away from serbia , everything 's fine , but when serbs demand equal rights , they are denied . 
  ergo , you can have an independent kosovo , but ca n't have an independent republika srpska . 
   kosovo followed slovenia , croatia , bosnia and fyrom 's examples in breaking away from a failed state you ca n't really compare federal republics with a province . 
  preach it , brother !, 
   then anybody can move and live where ever they want anyway . 
  i hope that applies to republika srpska . 
  equal rights for everyone . 
  u wot m8, 
  now that has to be one of the most stupid comments i read here . 
  what a moron you are . 
  let me make this clear : i 'm * not * pro-russian , but i am against one-sided opinions . 
  as far as i can see , people are being downvoted here just for having a different perspective . 
  i would like to see a more balanced discussion on this sub , that 's all i 'm saying . 
  i 'm from that very city , so i know what it 's like to try and cross the danube when every single bridge is bombed down . 
  and no , i 'm not trying to evoke sympathy here . 
   you release that depleted uranium means nothing ?
