  but my battle is more glorious than your battle !!, 
  i 'm kidding , i agree wholeheartedly with you . 
  you got us all figured out , did n't you ? 
  battle of kosovo is a big part of our identity , i 'm pretty sure we will always find a reason to talk about it . 
  we had been under the ottoman rule for nearly five centuries before we liberated the last parts of the country . 
  it 's not just any battle , it 's probably the most important one in our history . 
  however , i see your point , we do tend to live in the past . 
  i agree when it comes to albania or kosovo , visiting those places might have been a culture shock . 
  not so sure you could put serbia and croatia in the same basket though , but maybe i 'm mistaken . 
  you 're an outsider after all , with some first-hand experience . 
  just out of curiosity , where are you from ? 
  if i was n't a poor serb , i swear i would give you gold for this comment !, 
  it 's unbelievable how xenophobic and insulting you are !, 
  and to make it even worse , you come from a democratic paradise that is sweden . 
  well , what can i say ... once we join eu and start leeching off you magnificent bastards , i will be able to gild your comments . 
  until then !, 
  excuse me , i smoke weed every day and look at the stars , i know ** a lot ** about science . 
  and yes , you 're gon na pay for us , whether you like it or not . 
   we 're gon na get you bankrupt . 
   no one else in this thread seems to be unable to even spell the fucking word look at you go !, 
  frankly , i do n't give a shit either , i just want to read more of your comments , you 're hilarious . 
  hey , i have nothing to add to this discussion , just wanted to say that you are incredibly annoying . 
  do you think catalonia would n't want to secede if the people were economically better off ? 
  just curious , it 'd be great if someone from catalonia would share their thoughts . 
   albania did deliver on what we asked ... [ but ] if we decide to think it over and wait , it 's our right . 
  it 's that kind of attitude that drives me crazy , that 's why i 'm highly suspicious when it comes to eu integration . 
  i just ca n't understand , if the countries deliver , why would you deny them over and over again ? 
  write as you speak , read as you write . 
  also , lots of swear words , we 're very creative that way . 
  bosnia has always been a haven among turbulent winds of europe . 
  serbia * [ the biggest news in serbia this week is that the police detained hundreds of drug dealers . 
  ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes.php?yyyy=2013&amp;mm=12&amp;dd=06&amp;nav_id=88574 ) many of them turned out to be football clubs supporters , surprise surprise . 
  still , it 's nice to know that we 're finally addressing the issue , and we 've been pretty successful i 'd say . 
  * it gets better , more than 1.7 tons of narcotics have been destroyed in a thermal plant in obrenovac . 
  [ pic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/evgykav.jpg ) the prime minister pointed out that this is the first drugs destruction in 14 years . 
  [ source ] ( http://inserbia.info/news/2013/12/drugs-worth-15mln-euros-destroyed-in-obrenovac-near-belgrade/ ) * asylum seekers who got to serbia are not so happy with how they 're treated , to say the least . 
  however , there are notable exceptions . 
  four people from valjevo collected clothes , food and medical supplies and delivered them to more than 300 asylum seekers . 
  * [ it seems that the famous exit festival wo n't only be held in novi sad , but also in budva , montenegro . 
  ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society.php?yyyy=2013&amp;mm=12&amp;dd=06&amp;nav_id=88573 ) hope to see you next year !, 
  we owe it to 2pac whose aliv and real stronk wizard, 
  you should n't take those comments seriously , it 's more or less like the youtube comment section , you just kind of skim through . 
  and i agree with you , it 's hard to meet someone who can talk about the war without going all : `` but do you know what they did to us in the first place ?! '', 
  it 's sad really , we are not dealing with the past , just comparing the numbers of victims . 
  is that ... is that serbian 50 dinar note in the bottom left corner ? 
  serbia can into eu !, 
   all survey shows that russians do not think about serbs all that much that is actually true and [ here ] ( http://en.gazeta.ru/news/2012/06/14/a_4625705.shtml ) is an example . 
  in this poll , russians were asked to name the most friendly and most hostile countries and guess what , there is no mention of serbia . 
  it 's like they do n't care much about us . 
  i would like to be mistaken though . 
  on the other hand , if such a survey were to be conducted in serbia , russia would probably be considered as one of our closest allies . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5tq9gcpbz0 ) is from yesterday . 
  everything 's in ruins . 
   so every old woman who has had a hard life in serbia gets a state funeral ? 
  cool , i had no idea ... ... . 
  yes , every one . 
  i ca n't believe i 'm having this conversation with you !, 
   you are definitely honoring dictators mhm , most definitely . 
  it 's not important that i was n't even born when tito died . 
  it does n't matter if i think socialism is a relic of the past . 
  it does n't matter if i think that it 's respectful to bury a woman next to the man she respected , and in a way come full circle . 
  no , that means i 'm full of shit !, 
   what did she do , that was not connected with tito that made her the recipient of that honour . 
  i 'll say it again , she was connected to tito , she was his wife . 
  it was her wish in the first place to be buried next to tito , it 's not like the president or the prime minister picked the grave spot for her . 
  as i already told you , she had a hard life the last thirty years or so , so in a way , our politicians wanted to make it up to her . 
  that 's a little hypocritical of them , i agree , but how can you say that we honor dictators here ? 
  do you live here ? 
  have you visited serbia recently ? 
  the days of socialism are far behind us , the funeral is just an homage if you will . 
  we granted her the last wish she had , that does n't make us dictator-lovers , but respectful people . 
   they like dictators and communists . 
  i guess that is serbia . 
  what are you on about ? 
  serbia was one of yugoslav republics and that 's a part of our history , no one is honoring dictators here , kindly pay attention and you will see that tito 's widow died and this is a tribute to her . 
  she had a very hard life after tito died , no one cared about her so she was freezing in her home , alone and abandoned . 
  i do n't want to debate whether or not tito was a dictator , this post is dedicated to jovanka broz . 
  we are not honoring communists here in serbia , but acknowledging a part of our history , there 's a huge difference you know . 
  we are all just people in the end , no matter if we 're from s [ weed ] en or serbia . 
  result : iceland i can dig it . 
  if you ask me , it was an unnatural division in the first place , that 's why the term `` montenigrin language '' sounds unnatural to me . 
  but that 's the problem with balkans in general ... do n't get me wrong , i 'm not denying anyone the right to express themselves , if you say you speak montenigrin - that 's perfectly fine by me . 
  i 'm just trying to understand if there 's a real reason for claiming that , other than the pure nationalistic one . 
  another thing i wanted to add , in some parts of germany , `` ich '' is pronounced as `` ish , '' does that mean they should include another letter in the german alphabet ? 
  it is more a deviation of a rule , the same goes for the montenigrin letter '' \u015a . '', 
  i mean , i 'm from vojvodina and sometimes it 's even hard to understand people from the south of serbia , but that 's just richness of * one * language , nothing else . 
  sure it 's the same language , but whenever a serbian points that out , he gets accused of nationalism , the ever-long dream of great serbia and whatnot . 
  apparently , montenigrin language is a thing , they have two more letters in their alphabet when compared to the serbian one so there you go . 
  the cultures are the same , but in recent years , montenigrins have been trying to differentiate themselves more . 
  as a result , you will hardly find any serbian writers in modern montenigrin schoolbooks . 
  additionally , the montenegrin orthodox church is trying to break away from serbian orthodox church . 
  as for vojvodina , it is a serbian province , it used to be a part of austria-hungary , so there is a slight difference in mentality when compared to the rest of the country . 
  culturally , it is one of the most diverse regions in europe , with more than 26 ethnic groups . 
  serbia * more than 5 000 citizens of ni\u0161 formed a [ glowing cross ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xr6wbjf.jpg ) commemorating the 1 700th anniversary of the edict of milan . 
  * prime minister ivica da\u010di\u0107 is not allowed to visit kosovo , he warns the eu officials that serbia might terminate the negotiations as a result . 
  it is still not clear whether or not belgrade will support the elections that are held in kosovo in november .
