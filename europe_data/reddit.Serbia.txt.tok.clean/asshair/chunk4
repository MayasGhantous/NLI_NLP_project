  sign in subscribe france economy france on course to break eu budgetrules deficit at risk of breaching eurozone 's limit , says european commission france 's budget deficit is on course to hit 3.1 % of gdp in 2018 , according to european commission forecasts \u00a9 reuters 7 hours ago by : jim brunsden and mehreen khan france 's next president faces having to immediately implement austerity measures to avoid breaching eu budget rules , the european commission warned in its winter economic forecasts on monday . 
  in its last set of projections ahead of france ( https://www.ft.com/topics/places/france ) 's firstround presidential contest in april , brussels noted that the french budget deficit is on course to hit 3.1 per cent of gross domestic product in 2018 , just exceeding the euro area 's agreed 3 per cent limit . 
  there is also a risk that the deficit could breach the limit this year . 
  2/13/2017 france on course to break eu budget rules https://www.ft.com/content/ab4f1d98\u00adf1d4\u00ad11e6\u00ad8758\u00ad6876151821a6 2/6 public expenditure in france is set to be pushed up by measures including higher wage increases for civil servants and increased healthcare costs , the commission said . 
  french governments under former president nicolas sarkozy and successor fran\u00e7ois hollande have failed to stick to the deficit targets . 
  france , the largest economy in the eurozone after germany , last fell below the 3 per cent ceiling in 2007 . 
  in 2015 it was given extra flexibility to meet the eu 's accepted deficit ceiling by 2017 . 
  the question of whether paris should seek to stick to eu budget rules or instead fight to change them has become one of the big faultlines in the presidential race to succeed mr hollande . 
  while independent candidate emmanuel macron ( http://next.ft.com/content/a36b107a\u00addc a611e686acf253db7791c6 ) , a former economy minister , has defended the restrictions as a source of budgetary credibility , they are a b\u00eate noire for more radical candidates on the left . 
  meanwhile , the farright marine le pen ( http://next.ft.com/content/06deaa20\u00adeed8\u00ad11e6\u00ad 930f 061b01e23655 ) has vowed to rip up eu spending rules , taking france out of the eurozone and embarking on a huge spending programme . 
  the issue has fed into broader questions of how to transform the country 's economy . 
  fran\u00e7ois fillon , candidate for les r\u00e9publicains on the centreright , has made some of the boldest suggestions for spending cuts , advocating a `` thatcherite '' blitz of reforms that include $ 110bn of savings ( equivalent to 4.2 per cent of gdp ) by 2022 and a cap on unemployment benefits .

  `` my humble recommendation to the candidates is to continue [ the current trajectory ] '' , mr moscovici , a former french finance minister , said . 
  `` the economic and political credibility of the country will be reinforced . '' the forecasts also offered some worrying reading for italy , which is in the middle of difficult negotiations with brussels over steps to reduce its mountainous debt load . 
  the commission estimates italy 's public debt increased to a record 132.8 per cent of gdp in 2016 , and will increase again in 2017 . 
  failure by rome to make enough structural effort to rein in its debt would , under eu rules , limit the scope for brussels to be flexible in how it applies budget rules to the eurozone 's third largest country . 
  mr moscovici rejected any idea that an `` ultimatum '' had been given to rome over its growing debt pile . 
  brussels has the power to impose sanctions on member states in persistent breach of its framework . 
  ft view le pen 's siren call to the 2/13/2017 france on course to break eu budget rules https://www.ft.com/content/ab4f1d98\u00adf1d4\u00ad11e6\u00ad8758\u00ad6876151821a6 4/6 the eu also raised its estimate of the uk 's economic growth , acknowledging that its early estimates after june 's brexit vote had overestimated the economic hit . 
  the commission expects growth of 1.5 per cent this year , compared with a november estimate of 1 per cent . 
  mr moscovici said brussels `` must acknowledge '' that uk growth had been `` more resilient than was anticipated '' . 
  despite the better performance , brussels ' economists warned that the effects of the uk 's vote to leave the eu would kick in during the later part of 2017 , as higher inflation pinches consumer spending . 
  in the immediate aftermath of britain 's referendum the commission forecast that a `` mild '' brexit scenario would produce a 0.9 percentage point blow to gdp , reducing growth from 1.9 per cent to 1 per cent in 2017 . 
  the latest figures show those numbers were pessimistic . 
  growth is expected to reach 1.5 per cent in 2017 . 
  despite the upgrade , the eu 's figures remain far below those of the bank of england , which expects economic expansion to come in at 2 per cent . 
  the boe has also rowed back from its initial predictions of a sharp postbrexit slowdown , revising up uk growth twice in the last three months . 
  overall , eurozone growth ( http://next.ft.com/content/0bbc026a\u00adea12\u00ad11e6\u00ad967b\u00adc884522 63daf ) would come in at 1.6 per cent this year , slightly slower than 2016 's 1.7 per cent , said the commission , as the bloc 's recovery has remained resilient to several political and security shocks .

  watch the god damn news . 
  not the fake news btw . 
  the * actual * news . 
  putin 's bitch, 
  two words : donald trump . 
  the pretext for a ~ ~ russian ~ ~ defensive invasion of poland, 
  you will create them imperialist . 
  i did that exactly . 
  be careful - they are known to multiply very quickly and might try to secede one day, 
  would be hilarious if someone cut it down, 
  alexander the great ? 
   white vote not accounted for ? 
   the middle east is a land of xenophobia and tribalism . 
  yes it is we are who the bigots . 
  the tensions do not stem from racism or anti semitism . 
  they do not stem from the fact that israelis are jewish . 
  the tensions , and all palestinian hatred for israel in particular , comes from the massive land grab and the forceful theft of palestine land . 
  israel occupies 78 % if what was once palestine , of course there is resistance . 
  israel wants the rest of the world to think that all opposition must stem from anti semitism , but the resistance in palestine has nothing to do with anti jewishness and everything to do with territorial loss . 
  nice . 
  kinda like tramp, 
  how does serb speak such good english ? 
  are you really so naiive to think that russia makes ethnically provocative trains for countries simply out of the kindness of their heart ? 
  yeah shoulda just thrown them out of the airplane . 
  the argument is not whether or not crimea will ever be reunited with ukraine but whether or not it * should * be . 
  whether or not the annexation was morally wrong in the first place . 
  your argument on both counts seems to be no . 
  i know right ? 
  israel does n't recognize independence of kosovo because the reasons that you would recognize kosovo independence mean you should also recognize palestine independence . 
  48 % of british palestine belonged to the palestinians in 1948 , now down to the 22 % and ever-shrinking with settlements . 
  population may be up but living space is ever-shrinking . 
  it 's almost as if the palestinian people in palestine are being ` concentrated ' into some sort of open-air ` camps ' . 
  hmm ... 
  as serbs we are very familiar with the meaning of ethnic cleansing . 
  / s hypocritical how the us can both support kosovo independence due to the right of all people to self determination * and * support israeli apartheid of palestine due to israeli security concerns ( or whatever ) . 
  these 2 positions are fundamentally oppositional and it 's actually the main reason israel does not recognize kosovo independence . 
  and slovenia ? 
  also regular nazi . 
   palestine is n't shown as part of israel lol . 
  i wish . 
  the israelis have a much bigger propaganda budget than the palestinians, 
  no but the human rights violations are similar enough - palestinian refugee, 
  what a waste of time, 
  are u in my psych class ? 
  finnish girls are thicc, 
  world # 1 organ traffickers . 
  this is what happens when you artificially create a country that exists only for western geo-political purposes . 
  who are they saluting to ? 
  damn austrian chicks are nice is prostitution legal there ? 
  in america the shadow government are the un-elected heads of the cia and other intelligence agency who actually run the government , prevent the president from telling us the truth about aliens , and also did 9/11 . 
  or they themselves are aliens or lizard people . 
  it has such a nefarious connotation over here , lol . 
  do n't get offended uk bitch, 
   fyi , there are a lot of unique and tasty fruits that you 've never tried that are available in russia and not the u.s.  like what ? 
  a potato is not a fruit . 
  idk maybe they were milking me for the free papayas then ? 
  perhaps this proves another russian stereotype , that they are all scammers . 
  does anyone know why ladybugs have such religious or spiritual connotations to them ? 
  fuck you nick clegg !, 
  fuck you nick clegg !, 
  you reap what you sow , western imperialists . 
  this is what happens when you invade/create a country purely for imperialistic or political desires .
