  the guy was put on trial in serbia ( eventually ) and went to jail in serbia ( at least initially , i do n't know if he stayed there ) , and the family was given $ 900,000 ( not sure if exact figure ) of the serbian taxpayer 's money ... we 're not particularly happy to pay for this but the issue was that the consulate worker who gave him travel documents fucked up so it was our governments fault technically ... 
  it 's not like you said he should have gone free . 
  the american 's just do n't like non-american justice being applied . 
  like our laws do n't matter or are not good enough ... we did put him in jail like any other thug . 
  he just did n't go to jail in ` murica so i guess they are but-hurt ... 
   russia is the savior of europe from both sides of the political spectre . 
  nah , i 'd say china would be the savior . 
  they never much bugged anyone other than their immediate neighbors . 
  until they got their imperialistic desires they would be preferable to the already established imperialist ... 
  monopoly = really bad ( today ... ) duopoly = pretty bad ( cold war ) free market ? 
  ( many powerful players ) = should be good but vying for power takes us back to one of the previous two ... 
  hmm , but how do you say `` the land of the flying dildos '' in maori ? 
  hodor ? 
  usually without the flair so that you ca n't associate them with the patriotic ones ... 
  i am not at all skeptical that your trust or distrust in my skepticism of your trust in the statement made by / u/burek _ u_svemiru and my trust in your distrust of his statement is the sole reason so many skeptical votes are occurring on your trusty comment but trust me i am not distrustful or skeptical so here , have an upvote . 
  i think that you missed the _ '' ... seriously ... '' _ part . 
  you have n't proven that the guy was serious in the first place . 
  just because you ca n't figure out our humor does n't mean that we are serious . 
  even if our beliefs differ , your thoughts are appreciated . 
  ca n't deny that !, 
  let 's not forget their gulash and our paprikash ... 
  damn you !, 
  now i 'm hungry and thirsty !, 
  halfzies , like old times ? 
  though , i 'm probably screwed either way . 
  you 've conveniently left us out ... where do you class serbia then ? 
  southern ? 
  eastern ? 
  or somewhere in the middle ( which is usually where we naturally end up anyway , in the middle of everything ) ... 
  if it 's any consolation my grandpa always told me that if i had to choose between a croat and a shiptar to watch my back that i should always pick the shiptar . 
  same here , with noting the hungarians as less trustworthy than romanians , since their visits were n't always welcomed . 
  [ that acronym ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uskoks ), 
  yeah , and iirc they revoked ours ... 
  which brings us back to , let 's get the lube ready ... keeling or standing up do n't matter to the usa . 
  our very own braveheart !, 
  but seriously , i would like this too . 
  :'( fine , do n't ask us then !, 
  we did n't even want to tell you !, 
  i think it 's [ steven seagal ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105690/ ) .

  if the cop got on his high horse , maybe their weapons could n't reach . 
  it could cause a snowball effect . 
  from the sounds of it , i hope you never have to stop there . 
  at least in those suburbs . 
  true , but they are composed of citizens . 
  what i would do , if i was in a uk corporation , is to organize a discussion at the company and show the employees where the money they earn comes from . 
  they have a right to know how the brexit will affect their company and potentially their work . 
  provided that this is done _ honestly _ it would help them make an informed decision . 
  but the potential for abuse is too great . 
  so it probably would n't work . 
  uk/india comparison would be unfair . 
  a russian missile base in ireland would probably be fought with the same tenacity . 
  luckily we will never have to find out . 
  iirc georgia was about to join the eu or nato ( or both ) . 
  then russia got pissy . 
  i 'm not saying that they are right but they are sending a very clear message about how seriously they are taking the nato/eu expansion towards russia . 
  the same happened in ukraine too . 
  afaik usa also had defacto command of nato forces too . 
  iirc the us troops can not be commanded by any other nation , effectively meaning that when nato goes to war , us commands all troops . 
  i could be wrong though . 
  accurately depicted [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcpjgl2bals ) . 
   unlinking shit . 
  i read this while on the toilet ... 
  it made me _ unlink _ quicker . 
  just wait for us to get in , we 'll help you sort it out in a jiffy . 
  can you also post about that law that you have about items that are lent to someone for free for longer than 6 months becoming their property ? 
  i think that 's a pretty strange one too iirc . 
  not sure if it 's italy though ... somebody told me about it but i have no proof . 
  not all of us like turbofolk ... 
  clay aiken ? 
  i thought he was ` murican . 
  thanks in no small part to our american friends ... not that we needed your help to balkanize but it would n't have been the same without your help . 
  lol , first comment on imgur is :  upvote just to piss off the serbs :d, 
  good god !, 
  we told him not to provoke you ... we 're sorry !, 
  i 'm in . 
  all hail , the kingdom of nipples !, 
  what ? 
  i 'll have you know , i built many paper airplanes for my military !, 
  _ ^ they ^ were ^ out ^ of ^ potatoes ^ to ^ peel _ . 
  whoa , whoa , slow down , we 'll get to oceanic serbs soon but we do n't even have a coast yet ... 
  we do it just to confuse people . 
  does it not in croatian ? 
  also , i believe montenegrin is a language now ... 
  which is good for me since it turns out i speak a lot more languages by doing nothing . 
  literal translation of crna gora is black mountain so monte-negro makes sense ... 
  though i 'm not sure if it 's racist or not ... 
  only on tuesdays . 
  nothing !, 
  please do n't shoot !, 
  just move ? 
  you have to remember that people in those areas have lived in their villages/cities for generations . 
  why would they want to move ? 
  do n't get me wrong , a lot of people have moved since they do n't feel safe in kosovo . 
  a lot of them are still waiting to see if they will ever get their homes and property back . 
  but you would prefer a solution that does n't require you to move . 
  please , please do this !, 
  the nra of the eu ... 
  oh , you mean [ this ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-serbia-debt-kosovo-idusl2637230220080226 ) ? 
  i agree .
