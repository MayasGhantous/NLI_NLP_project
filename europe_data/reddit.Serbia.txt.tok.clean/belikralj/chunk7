  trust me , we wo n't trust you trusting us to trust you ... 
  he says a lot of things . 
  we do our best to ignore him these days ... 
  can we change our political system already ? 
  i mean , it 's clearly not working and is producing the same kind of politics but we all just kind of ignore it ... 
  yeah , i 'd be fine with that . 
  becoming a decent country and not join the eu would be a welcome outcome . 
  i ca n't speak for the majority but yes , i would be satisfied if serbia became a land of serbians and people of like minds . 
  we could then move on and deal with other issues that are currently obscured and overshadowed by kosovo . 
  if kosovo albanians are allowed to demonstrate self-determination and become independent , why can we not extend the same courtesy to the serbian minority in the north ? 
  they are conveniently located close to serbia and do n't want to live in a country as a minority . 
  how hard is it to just swap ? 
  similarly , why ca n't we let the albanians in the south-east of serbia go with kosovo ? 
  they clearly too do n't want to be a minority and have a different idea about what they want to do . 
  trading territory like this was explicitly forbidden by the eu . 
  though we would n't necessarily like it , we saw this as the most practical option . 
  but the eu says no ... additionally , why does it have to be independence ? 
  i mean , we can give them whatever rights and controls they want over kosovo so long as they simply do n't go that extra mile . 
  why is that so foreign to them ? 
  from my perspective , they are the ones who refuse to compromise and the eu and us are condoning this . 
  so we 're a little pissed and in the mood to drag this out and make it as uncomfortable for them as possible . 
  you know , we used to have a federation ... 
  this is the first article that i 've read that characterized the plane as a `` bomber '' which it actually is and not a `` fighter jet '' . 
  balkanization !, 
  i was guesstimating the actual value of trade with russia so both are mean to represent russia 's hypothetical share . 
  it would be stupid to lose eu trade for russia but if we can keep both that would be great and we should definitely try to keep both . 
  they are different but it would be interesting to see greece shoot down a turkish plane _ ( preferably not killing the pilot and over the sea ) _ for a violation since that 's how turkey does things ... 
  but it wo n't happen since the greeks are sensible . 
  i did not think cnn would take that angle ... 
  surprisingly even-handed . 
  oh , no wait , i was thinking of fox . 
  never mind . 
  that 's because they do n't eat pork . 
  yeah but 20 % and 10 % are not amounts you want to lose either ... 
  true . 
  but why do the europeans not want you to leave europe ? 
  i 'd be fine with that ... 
  it 's good to see that our montenegrin friends are n't as stubborn and prideful as we are . 
  we do n't want to join nato simply because you 've [ bombed us ( and montenegro ) ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/nato-yugoslavia-bombings-photos-737/ ) and we will never forget this . 
  even if this would be the best option for us right now our pride does n't allow us to take it . 
  [ putuj crna goro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w65koizz-wk ) . 
  edit : however , it may or may not be the * best * option if we consider who our [ trade partners are ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/srb/ ) . 
  russians are known to reprimand countries that join unfriendly alliances so we have to tread carefully . 
  edit 2 : personally , i would hate to join nato because i resent what it represents these days . 
  but i 'm not stupid , it is n't strategically possible for us to be surrounded by nato and not co-operate ... 
  who 's against you ? 
  i think it would be better for everyone if us butted out of the middle east . 
  from the asshole to the world ... 
  count us in ... no , wait !, 
  this is entrapment !, 
  link or it did n't happen . 
  the by population breakdown is very interesting . 
  thanks but no thanks . 
  [ what serbia wo n't get ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opt-outs_in_the_european_union ) . 
  [ what democracy looks like in the eu ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_legislative_procedure#principal_actors ) . 
  the commission is indirectly elected , which is what i disagree with the most . 
  it means that the faces there rarely change . 
  additionally the votes in the council of the eu are proportional to the population of a country . 
  this is great if eu was a single country but it means that serbia , should it ever join is putting its fate into the hands of other countries . 
  should the eu ever decide that germany is the primary place where we should spend resources for development that would happen simply by the fact that they have more people . 
  this entire structure favours countries with large populations . 
  why would we want to join something like that ? 
  you seem to be all talk and no evidence , please , write in some evidence as to why we should bother ? 
  we do n't want you remember ? 
  why would you want us ? 
  democracy !, 
  people often do n't say exactly what they want until they think they are able to attain it ... 
  joining schengen is now a required step of any new eu entrant , after a cool-off period afaik . 
  so it would be a valid reason . 
  additionally i have a problem with the way the eu parliament and the commission are elected . 
  it is n't all that democratic in some cases . 
  so for a small country like serbia to join what kind of a say would we have in any issues ? 
  we are late to the party and wo n't be given exactly equal rights and opportunities like some other members like uk ... why would we want to sell our right to self determination ? 
  not all eu law is great and there is quite a bit of controversy over copyright and internet laws recently ... we would be trading the incompetent government we know for one that is competent and driven by corporate interests and us policy ... 
   when so many serbs here are outright denying what they did i 'm sure everyone on this thread actually went to kosovo and personally participated ... 
  but never mind my classic strawman . 
  hundreds definitely , i do n't know about thousands . 
  the way you are portraying it sounds like it was hundreds of thousands and that 's simply not true . 
  i could be wrong , but i provided links where one could very easily sum things up . 
  i suppose that will be the only way to prove what i was trying to say . 
   do they still teach you to call kosovo albanians `` monkeys with tails '' ? 
  i thought they removed that . 
  they got told that it was n't a good idea to call them monkeys any more since it encouraged poo slinging . 
  but even after removing it the poo slinging continues ... also , i never said that kosovo albanians had tails , but you learn something new every day . 
   the kralj is angry and he wants revenge !, 
  revenge would be nice but there was enough of that . 
  the body count is n't exactly even anyway . 
   from his keyboard !, 
  a lot can be done behind a keyboard these days ... was that meant to be derogatory ? 
  edit : i apologize if i 've insulted you but the reason i called them monkeys is because [ they climb really well ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt0eaobjvpa ) and [ put poop where it do n't belong ] ( http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postview&amp;id=1043 ) ... is that not monkey-like behaviour ? 
  _ that second link does n't look unbiased , but i 'll leave it there for now _ . 
  edit 2 : one of the posted links was auto-removed by a moderator bot . 
  changing to a different article . 
  i 'll back / u/rectal _ smasher_2000 i too am against serbia in the eu . 
  staying out of the eu will be made more difficult if bosnia and montenegro join though ... what serbia needs to focus on is rebuilding serbia . 
  the only reason anyone is supporting eu integration is because they want some of those laws implemented and the quickest way to get our weasel politicians to do it is to make someone bigger make them do it . 
  once the question of joining comes up i will vote no . 
  sad but true . 
  this number seems to be constantly rising ... see the [ list of massacres ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_massacres_in_the_kosovo_war ) and the [ war crimes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_crimes_in_the_kosovo_war ) . 
  you were not the only victims .
