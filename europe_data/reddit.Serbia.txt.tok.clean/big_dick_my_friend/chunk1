it was n't really that good , as my mother tells me . 
  yugoslavia became similar to what is china today : politically connected people became large businessmen and sweatshop owners , where workers had little to no rights . 
  at least in serbia , which was already a bit of `` rust belt '' due to too much heavy industry being concentrated here . 
  things were better in slovenia , though . 
  what exactly does this mean ? 
  with an average salary in serbia i can buy approximately the same amount of goods as in czech republic or slovenia ? 
  well , yeah , but russkies do n't have anything to do with it ... 
  it 's a joint nato and serbia exercise . 
  this made my day . 
  i 've made a mistake while coloring the map . 
  the data is not mine , it is from an us site called globalfirepower.com , which seems very reliable and is often quoted in various news outlets . 
  it seems more reliable than the wikipedia page with the big , fat `` needs additional citations for verification '' on the top . 
  also , the sites claims that the data is from 2017 . 
  true , 
  a t-55 hit to the track could possibly disable the leo 2 , but it can still return fire and [ light the t-55 up ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7fujvhx46c ) . 
  i am not sure if t-55 could penetrate the front armor , though . 
  wikipedia says that leo 2 can withstand 125mm hits from the front , fired from 1500m , while t-55 has 100mm cannon . 
  that 's just armor though , let 's not mention the sighting and aiming systems in which leopard is almost 50 years ahead of t-55 . 
  and not to mention that most of the stuff written on wikipedia is bullshit . 
  it really is a military secret . 
  good comment . 
  advances in penetration are always countered by advances in armor , ever since the middle ages . 
  if all wars post 1500 proved anything , is that humans are n't that reliable against a bullet . 
  tanks are not to be used in urban areas , as they currently are in syria . 
  battles of [ vukovar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vukovar ) and [ grozny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_grozny ) proved that twenty years ago . 
  however , syrian desert is a perfect place for armored combat , if you know how to do it . 
  gulf war proved that . 
  `` i have china 's blessing ! '', 
  could be . 
  i assume that the leopard 1 is held in reserves . 
  gfp.com counts only active tanks . 
  almost  you can also say that an infantryman is obsolete because a 1 $ bullet will take him out . 
  i know an older man who had a saying : `` i am afraid of only snakes and tanks '' . 
  tanks still have large effect on enemy morale , and are important tool for gaining and holding ground . 
  usa still has about 6000 active tanks , and who knows how many more in reserves . 
  armored combat is shifting toward [ infantry fighting vehicles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infantry_fighting_vehicle ) ( which are , basically , smaller tanks that carry large infantry crew ) and mechanized infantry combat , but tanks still have an important place in modern warfare , though not nearly as important as they have had in ww2 . 
  number of main battle tanks ( mbt ) per 100k people in europe . 
  this map is made by me . 
  number of mbts is from [ globalfirepower ] ( http://www.globalfirepower.com/armor-tanks-total.asp ) and population data is from [ wikipedia ( un data ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_population_ ( united_nations ) ) . 
  i calculated the numbers for all the countries on earth , but i 've mapped it only for europe . 
  ask in comments if you want the number for your country . 
  formula used : mbts per 100k = ( no . 
  of mbts / population ) * 100 000 countries in grey have no data on gfp.com . 
  countries coloured in blue have no mbts as of 2017 . 
  remember that some of the balkan countries have large number of t-55 tanks ( and equivalent , such as m48 ) , which are mostly obsolete in modern tank vs. tank combat , but still have tactical value . 
  other interesting contenders from around the world : usa : 1.8 china : 0.47 india : 0.33 pakistan : 1.49 north korea : 19.78 syria : 24.54 israel : 31.48 jordan : 16.77 saudi arabia : 3.49, 
  yugoslav president tito was one of the founders of [ non-aligned movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-aligned_movement ) , and there was a lot of propaganda to support closer relationship with peoples of africa , asia , and caribbean and south america . 
  [ yugoslav variant of socialism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/titoism ) may not be the best choice from an economic standpoint , but it is very humanistic in nature , as it promotes brotherhood and equality for all nations , religions , and races . 
  i know a lot of yugoslav songs , books and films in which `` colored '' people are referred to as `` brothers '' . 
  yugoslav wars damaged the relations with arab people , and indian people were ( sadly ) always connected to the roma people , but the opinion on the black people remained positive in modern serbia . 
  i have a friend from nigeria , and we used to share an apartment in belgrade . 
  i 've asked him about racism , and he told me that he experienced a weird form of racism , almost exclusively in rural areas ( he was doing business in serbia , and traveled a lot through the country ) . 
  he said that it usually boiled down to some staring , people wanting to have a picture , etc. . none of that `` superiority '' racism , as we had no history of slavery . 
  he had no problem dating serbian girls , even in small towns , and no problems in frequenting serbian clubs ( he was always well-dressed though ) . 
  as he was doing business selling truck parts , he frequently visited truck stops and pubs in serbia , and never had any problems . 
  a bit sketchy history , though . . 
  lot of nationalist agenda , too . 
  calling pagania a serbian land is a bit of overstrech . 
  yes , i 've heard of constantine vii porphyrogenitus and i know that * de administrando imperio * mentions narentine people as serbs , but in my opinion ( and in opinion of many modern historians ) , they are just south slavs , and distinct from other south slavic tribes . 
  anyway , it 's medieval age . 
  no real nations , just common language and feudal obligations . 
  and claiming that 700 000 serbs died in jasenovac camp is very unlikely . 
  a lot of people died in the ndh , including some of my family members , but that much victims in jasenovac is mostly discretited as communist propaganda . 
  united states holocaust museum puts the number of victims ( serbs , jews and roma ) around 80\u00a0000-100\u00a0000 . 
  and 1990-present ? 
  it is too early to discuss that as history . 
  lot of things are unfolding just now . 
  even r/askhistorians does not allow discussion of events that are not at least 20 years old . 
  for balkan history , the limit should be around 100 years , in my opinion . 
  maps are mostly ok , though . 
  ok , i 'm obviously living under a stone . . 
  the posters are signed by srbska akcija . 
  never heard of them , but i did a google search , and i saw that they are connected to various other foreign neo-nazi groups . 
  that 's illegal , and i 'm sure you do n't think they are representing the whole serbian people , do you ? 
  algae thrive in dirty waters , and these waters do not seem dirty . 
  southwestern serbia is extraordinarily environmentally protected . 
  for example , [ prostorni plan republike srbije ] ( http://www.rapp.gov.rs/sr-latn-cs/content/cid310/prostorni-plan-republike-srbije ) ( serbian zoning plan ) prohibits the construction of chemical industry plants and stuff in uzice and surrounding areas ( i 'm an engineer-to-be , i do n't want to bragg , but i know this shit ) . 
  i would rather say that limestone is resposible for the green coloration of this river . 
  http://backyardblessings.com/limestone-causes-green-water-in-ponds/ i can personally witness that these waters are extremely clean , as i grew up swimming in the green rivers of western serbia ( especially drina river ) . 
  perhaps you can buy them on the street . 
  up to 2012 . you certainly could . 
  but today , and on every corner ? 
  i honestly doubt that . 
  i often take a walk through the city center , and especially the zeleni venac and terazije . 
  lots of serbian flags and shit for sale , but i do n't see mladic and karadzic anymore . 
  yes , that 's exactly what i thought . 
  a couple of years ago ( up to around 2012 ) you could easily buy those shirts on street . 
  now , not so easy , and especially not in city center . 
  can you , really ? 
  because i 've been living in belgrade for more than 5 years and i have never seen those shirts on sale . 
  i 'm sure you can buy them online , though . 
  edit : i guess you can . 
  i used to play a video game ( or better say simulation , as it was incredibly hard to learn and play ) [ lock on : modern air combat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lock_on:_modern_air_combat ) , that was about war in crimea and northern georgia . 
  the game was released in 2003 , before the wars in ukraine and ossetia . 
  when i heard of war in crimea from the news , i immediately thougth of that game . 
  great game , very realistic , learned a lot about modern air combat and aviation in general . 
  i recommend it . 
  edit : til that the game developers are russian . 
  i guess they are present , but pretty rare in the north of europe . 
  they are also very rare in urban areas .
