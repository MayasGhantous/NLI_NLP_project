  i can only hope my own nation will live to see the day its population is largely infested with a parasite ^ ^ ^ / ^ s, 
  through french , where it came from german , i believe , via austria-hungary . 
  but that 's beside the point , no ? 
  just like huszar came from our `` gusar '' which came from the latin `` corsarius '' and so on ... 
  oh yeah , forgot about that . 
  from the croatian ethnonym , no less . 
  `` vampire '' is the only truly international everyday word that came from serbian , i believe . 
  maybe `` paprika '' counts , but that is a hungarian word which was derived from a serbo-croatian word , but then came back into our language as `` paprika '' , that 's why i am not sure if it should count . 
  various terms in the field of physical geography are serbian too , such as : polje , uvala , vrta\u010da , ponor ... [ due to this guy ] ( https://www.google.rs/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/jovan_cviji%25c4%2587&amp;ved=0ahukewiurrqgz73tahxktrqkhuuqcpmqfgijatav&amp;usg=afqjcnfbfyypyoqhmjpaseab7dbzfsodca&amp;sig2=b5nworqlkeulwusvjrns8q ), 
  not trying to fight you there or anything , but how come you put serbian and croatian down as serbo-croatian , but added bosnian separately ? 
  why not only write serbo-croatian or write all three of them separately ? 
  just curious , i do n't mean any offense . 
  first time i 've heard of this , but it does sound plausible . 
  listen would be `` slu\u0161aj '' , so it 's likely not that . 
  '' \u010cuj '' ( chooy ) could be it , that 's like `` hear me out '' . 
  '' \u010cuje\u0161 '' ( choo-yesh ) resembles what you said the most . 
  it literally means `` you hear '' , but you could use it to end a sentence like `` do you get what i 'm saying ? 
  i have no issues with muslims or bosniaks or whatever , but a thousand years ? 
  i think it 's closer to half of that . 
  other than that , i fully agree with you . 
  enlighten me then , which part of my comment did you disagree with ? 
  instead of being condescending , we could have a conversation perhaps ? 
  in a sense , yes . 
  as long as there are people outside that do n't have acommodation and that do n't have meals , showers and beds the government pays for ( not to mention books and video games which are often seen as luxuries and pass-times ) i suppose certain people could look at those types of prisons as something unfair and unjust , despite the restriction of the inmates ' freedom . 
  not a reward per se , but something that they did not earn or deserve . 
  does n't it make sense for it to be like that ? 
  well , i suppose it 's up to norwegians to decide , i 'm sure the convicts do n't care either way ^ ^ / s, 
  excellent point , i 'll look into it, 
   plenty of people try to get into gaol for winter here ... that 's a great strategy !, 
  it ca n't be that bad if that 's a viable move to take . 
  well either that , or it 's just unbearable to be anywhere else, 
  are you saying you 're against treating prisoners that nicely , or are you simply explaining the people 's mindset ? 
  thank you for the insight !, 
  i understand what you 're saying , but i think the thing is that it 's easy , looking at facilites like halden and those with similar living standards , to feel like felons , murderers and criminals are getting rewarded for their crimes . 
  i 'd wager most people prefer to see them punished and isolated , instead of placed somewhere comfortable in an effort to rehabilitate them when a lot of innocents on the outside ca n't afford such acommodation . 
  i 'd even go so far as to say a lot of people do n't even believe in rehabilitation . 
  your thoughts ? 
  fair enough . 
  ca n't say i blame you, 
  hahahaha probably * the serbian movie * some people will argue it has a message , i think that if it does , it did n't communicate it properly . 
  its biggest acomplishment is getting us a bad rep. 
  the movie has some actors i think are great , i admit , but it really came out of nowhere , just like a kick in the nuts . 
  would not recommend , watch at your own peril . 
   just because you wan na save the eu does n't mean every country does have it 's own special culture and customs look , i 'm not against the idea of a european union , but , like ... every country ** does ** have it 's own culture , sometimes even smaller regions have unique things people there do , quite often , actually . 
  not to say that europe as a whole does n't have a spirit that 's different to the other continents , it definitely does . 
  the two things are n't mutually exclusive . 
  i get what you mean , and it 's really a damn shame that we do that to our own language ( s ) . 
  hearing someone in serbia speak ijekavian is fine , people will just say `` oh yeah , he probably comes from bosnia/croatia/montenegro '' and 99 % of the time it wo n't be a big deal . 
  but good luck getting a job here speaking like that , buddy !, 
  exactly . 
  vuk is responsible for the rather easy orthography , but you could say that the one-letter-one-sound rule applies only to the cyrillic , since the latin script still has * nj * , * lj * , * d\u017e * ... 
  i mean , the dialects of the language that differ most from the standard , like the croatian chakavian and kajkavian and the serbian prizren-timok dialect suffer the most , since they are now seen as * incorrect * and are even actively supressed in some cases , but all of the bcms regions have their own little linguistic flavour , yeah edit : to be fair about the first part of this comment , those ** are ** still individual letters , yes , but for some reason we use two letters to mark them instead of coming up with one , like \u0161 , \u010d , \u0107 , \u017e and \u0111 . 
  seeing as \u0111 was late to join the party , maybe some day we 'll use \u0141 and \u00d1 for lj and nj , who knows ? 
  sort of ... not exactly . 
  his thing was that he was a subscriber to the idea that people should use the common , simple man 's language to write and speak instead of the various language hybrids popular amongst the higher class serbs at the time , like slavenosrpski . 
  as well as that , vuk and most of the south slav linguist elite at the time agreed that serbs and croats inhabiting territories of what today is b&h , montenegro , serbia and croatia spoke variations of the same language ( see the novi sad declaration ) . 
  in order to craft a standard , he opted for the east-herzegovinian ijekavian dialect , among other reasons ( such as it being straight up in the middle of the linguistic region ) because he spoke that version himself . 
  this did have an enormous impact on the standards in each of those countries today , but it is important to note that it was n't the only variation that influenced the standards . 
  soon after serbia even switched to the ekavian version , seeing as most of the people in serbia spoke ekavian already , as opposed to the ijekavian east herzegovinian dialect that vuk was brought up in , and the \u0160umadija-vojvodina dialect became the main basis for the serbian standard instead . 
  honestly not a huge stretch from the eh dialect , the main difference between eh and \u0160v is the ekavian-ijekavian thing . 
  kolodrk mi je nekako zvonkije edit : forgot i should probably write it in english : i think that * kolodrk * ( referring to ` circlejerk ' ) has a slightly better ring to it somehow, 
  basically the same here , with certain exceptions . 
  for example , there 's a church in my hometown dedicated to saint nicholas that we can refer to as - crkva svetog ( sv . ), 
  when i was a little whippersnapper playing counter strike 1.6 , lots of serbian dudes used the cz tag , i still come across some in league of legends , though it 's been a while since i 've played . 
  no corelation to the czechs though , rather to the crvena zvezda football team . 
  * cries in serbian *, 
  i believe sanu ( the serbian science and arts academy ) is in charge of that , however , in my opinion they 're incompetent twats . 
  linguists are supposed to observe the changes in a language , document them , maybe explain them , but what sanu is doing is policing the language in the most trivial ways - playing with the verb * trebati * , saying you ca n't say * sla\u017eem se * ( `` i agree '' , because slagati can also mean to stack or assemble ) but should use * saglasan sam * ( i 'm in accordance ) instead . 
  unimportant , irrelevant things like that do n't contribute anywhere , they only make us conscious of the way we speak in fear of having some know-it-all correcting us for saying something that had been said that way for ages until these people decided it was no longer acceptable , instead of letting us speak our language and accepting that language changes over time , and that one word can , in fact , have multiple meanings . 
  edit : ironically , spelling, 
  [ `` bluz u parku '' ] ( https://youtu.be/2k2vmwou2hm ) by smak . 
  one of my favourite sad songs , by one of my favourite bands . 
  we used to say `` pec '' when i was younger . 
  the consequences varied , you could owe someone a drink , the `` pec '' - ed person could become moldy , or they could be obligated to stay quiet , depends on the crowd, 
   papir koji je izazvao \u0161ok i vjevericu lol thanks for the article , seems to check out , very interesting indeed . 
  all in all , thanks for educating me , i learned something new today atleast . 
  do you have a source on the first one ? 
  i 'd love to read something about it , as i 'm quite suspicious of that , to be frank . 
  and the museum you mention was founded in 1893 . officially . 
  the case might be that it depended on the place . 
  i know that songs like `` tamo daleko '' and `` igrale se delije '' were banned because of their serbian character . 
  the songs `` marjane , marjane '' and `` vila velebita '' as well , in croatia . 
  however , and this is hearsay , so take ot with a grain of salt , i 've heard that in yugoslav croatia what is today their anthem , `` lijepa na\u0161a '' was taught to kids prior to `` hej , sloveni '' , the yu anthem , the source here being my mother 's neighbour who had moved there from croatia . 
  this may sound perfectly normal , but kids in yugoslav serbia had no such experience . 
  again , grain of salt !, 
  i 'm no historian . 
  very , very true , but the policy he led was a very short-sighted one, 
  milo\u0161 crnjanski was also an officer in the ah army , that does n't mean anything . 
  they did n't choose where they were born . 
  plenty of other serbs , croats and slovenes born on austrohungarian soil had to fight serbs from serbia as well . 
  not really . 
  plenty of other trigger words , not tito though , i do n't think . 
  was he successful ? 
  yes . 
  did he promote cooperation between the yugoslav peoples ? 
  he did . 
  was he a great man ? 
  absolutely . 
  the problem arises when you actually realize by which means he did what he did . 
  brotherhood and unity were often promoted through silencing and outright banning traditions tied to a specific nationality , usually songs and things like that , pieces of our various cultural heritages that all yugoslavs could now be proud they were connected to could n't be promoted .
