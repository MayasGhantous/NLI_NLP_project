  you are not a croat , you are a yugoslav , so why are you singing songs that sing of how great croatia is ? 
  it 's like if a bavarian was forced to only be a german , not a bavarian . 
  as a consequence , you get ethnic tensions ( i realize that this is n't the only factor , but it certainly is one of them ) because people felt like they were not allowed to be who they were . 
  he did build a lot of the country up from almost nothing . 
  where did he get the means to do this ? 
  he borrowed like hell . 
  a great diplomat , a very influential and charismatic man , but old joe gave 0 fucks about the future of the country after his death . 
  i do consider it european . 
  frankly , i do n't see what their politics and the fact that they do n't match up with the politics of most european countries has to do with it . 
  history and , well , geography over all are what matters . 
  if you want to bring politics and their national character into this , not getting along with europeans is sort of the most european thing ever, 
  glava ili pismo . 
  okay , so glava is definitely head , but i think pismo is used in an older sense , to mean `` anything written down '' , not in the sense of `` letter '' ( like an envelope and everything ) it has today . 
  but you 'd pronounce it the same either way . 
  not to mention that in casual written conversation ( on facebook itself , for example ) not all serbs follow that rule . 
  it only came about because you ca n't write \u0444\u0430\u0446\u0435\u0431\u043e\u043e\u043a or \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0435 instead of the name george in cyrillic , it has to be completely phonetic . 
  ever heard quebec french for example ? 
  their disputes with the real french remind me so much of our two languages . 
  quebecois usually translates foreign words , calcs them , that is , just like croatian , and uses some older french words , but has no problem using the verb fucker or the adjective cute in conversational language . 
  all in all , i do n't think we 're different enough to be considered separate languages , but hey , that 's life , my opinion is just as valid as yours , neither of us are linguistic authorities ( i assume :d ), 
  honestly , i see them as one , or dialects of one . 
  of course , if someone asked me what my native language was , i 'd say serbian , but if i were asked if i spoke serbocroatian i 'd say yes . 
  you know , even when it was officially called serbocroatian way back when , it was quadruply recognized , as croatian , as serbian , as croatoserbian and as serbocroatian , neither would be incorrect to say . 
  of course there 's differences in vocabulary and nuances in grammar , but if british english and american english , quebecois french and french french , austrian german and german german who have the same amount of differences ( if not more sometimes ) can agree they speak the same languages , so should we . 
  this is just politics . 
  gvozden - * iron * , or maybe ognjen - * fiery * , strahinja - derived from the word for fear , perhaps even vojislav or ratislav , ratomir , all denoting someone who 's supposed to be good at war . 
  but that 's not mistaking him for another nationality , quite the opposite . 
  i do realise that you were just trying to start shit .

  we 're not even in the eu , but i hope you 'll allow me to chime in . 
  since other people have answered your questions from the post description , let me just answer that one about the appeal . 
  now look , i 'm not saying i support it , or that i 'm against it , i 'm just saying that there is a certain appeal to it . 
  why unite into one country ? 
  because , simply , that 's a way to ensure europeans remain relevant , have some sort of power , instead of being usa 's and russias playtoys . 
  i try to, 
  this 'll be fun ** romania ** , thanks for not fighting us ever ( your meme war attempt is forgiven ) ** bulgariaaaa ** my maaan , we share custody over ajvar , we 've been bitter frienemies over the centuries , i think it 's something to raise a glass to !, 
  ** macedonia ** ( or fyrom , not looking to offend ) , you have some of the nicest , tamest , most polite people of our little corner of the world . 
  cheers to them !, 
  ** albania ** , i appreciate ... 
  i appreciate ... .

  i appreciate the peaceful divorce , i suppose ? 
  i appreciate bar , and that plavi jadran icecream they sell there .

  now that one i , albeit sadly , get . 
  are you famous for stealing ? 
  i 'm not a nationalist , that 's the thing . 
  of course i 'd be nice to you guys , why would n't i be , and i 'd even use the term `` makedonci '' because it 's shorter , everyone uses it , and also because fyromian or ( bjrmac , i guess ) is n't an actual word , atleast not to my knowledge , so whatever the country 's name is , your ethnonym is still macedonian . 
  as i said , i am not nationalistic , and i have no issue with your country 's sovereignty . 
  none at all . 
  but i guess you already know the name 's history ( the way the rest of the world sees it ) . 
  there 's messing with history a bit to fit your national plan ( which , cmon , everyone does ) and there 's completely overwriting it , which always kicks up dust and never goes unnoticed . 
  well technically we ** are ** the former yugoslav republic of serbia , but you can feel free to just call us serbia . 
  we went ahead and made that our official name , you know , since it was n't like , already taken by other people and places or anything . 
  it just felt right . 
  edit : and i 'm actually a southerner . 
  not remove them , my croat friend ... *** transcend ***, 
  depends on the region . 
  vojvodina here and slavonia in croatia are pretty close culturally , but so are ra\u0161ka and montenegro , people from both sides of the drina are close , ni\u0161ava and p\u010dinja are close culturally to west bulgaria and fyrom ... people may disagree , and a lot definitely do , but i see this region as a continuum , not exactly defined by borders . 
  it 's just a spectrum , cultures subtly and gradually changing into one another from the slovenian alps to the black sea . 
  neutrally , i 'd say . 
  we 're taught the same as everyone , his military prowess , strategic expertise , worldchanging achievements and eventual blunder . 
  the thing is he had more of a direct impact on our history than most serbs realise . 
  during our first uprising against the ottomans , which went really well up until the very end ( we won our freedom only after the second uprising ) , we had a lot of help from russia , since the balkans were a zone they wanted to get their foot in . 
  then , our `` slavic brethren '' suddenly pulled out from the war and left us to the mercy of the turks . 
  why ? 
  it 's actually a very simple game of interest . 
  napoleon was nearing russia , but also fighting the turks . 
  war between russia and the ottomans was n't paying off for neither the tsar nor the sultan . 
  they had a common enemy , after all . 
  the under-the-table support of the habsburgs towards our rebels had to cease too for a while when napoleon came riding eastwards , iirc . 
  on the other hand , i hear napoleon had great admiration towards kara\u0111or\u0111e , our leader during the uprising , for doing what he did with only an army of peasants and a few cherry wood cannons . 
  so there 's that .
