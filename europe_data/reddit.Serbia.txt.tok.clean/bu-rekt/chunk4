  sure , let 's group the south slav countries together first ... oh wait . 
  1st-5th grade : u\u010ditelj / u\u010diteljica 5th-8th : nastavnik/nastavnica highschool : profesor/profesorka college : same as highschool , though some are more lax and let you call them by their name , or you can use `` kolega '' / `` kolegenica '' , literally `` colleague '' . 
  visited both ( albeit for 2 days each ) and can honestly , sincerely , truthfully say that budapest is far prettier , in my opinion . 
  unless you were talking about something other than looks ? 
  most people i know that are close to my age either say they 're atheists , agnostic , or something along those lines , as in they are n't necessarily religious , but do n't give it enough thought to declare themselves as anything . 
  there are quite a bit of religous people here too , and the worst kind too - the `` i do n't go to church or observe any tradition unless there 's food involved , i 've never seen a bible , but i know god is on our side , he loves us best '' kind . 
  they tend , they ** tend ** to be older though , emphasis on `` tend '' . 
  wow , i 've heard the joke about the selfie-stick being `` motka za svojka '' :d i suppose you are right though , they are n't really recycled in most cases , i feel like one is on the tip of my tongue , but i probably wo n't remember . 
  honestly i like most of what you are doing with the language , calcing foreign words and things like that , atleast you seem to give a shit about it , which ca n't be said for us . 
  but dude , you got ta understand why people from this side of the river sometimes rip on the neocroatian vocabulary . 
  if you are n't aware of that type of joke , and i fully understand why you might not be , i am at your service , 
  we also lack the `` ya '' , `` yo '' , `` scht `` and `` yu '' symbols bulgarian and russian alphabets have . 
  i 'm too lazy to find them or switch to cyrillic so here 's a picturesque description : one 's a mirrored `` r '' , the other 's a '' \u00eb '' ( possibly only ukrainian ) , i think then we have an `` o '' with a sideways `` t '' attached and an `` e '' lying on it 's back with a little thingy hanging off it 's right edge . 
  you say that about us ? 
  funny , it seems to me like we are the most melodic and easily pronounceable out of our whole merry family . 
  you guys are somewhere in the middle , not too difficult to pronounce polish , but fuck me if you do n't have a horrendous writing system with a `` z `` following every goddamn letter !, 
  lol , basically the croatian language in a nutshell, 
  makes absolutely 0 difference to me . 
  there may as well be hunnic hordes in our hillsides and streets - if they behave , i could n't care less . 
  honestly i have nothing against roma people , their history or them living in my country , but you have to realize how they self-isolate through their own culture , they make it hard for others to see them as fellow countrymen wherever they may live . 
  i was about to make a comment , maybe even mention something on the topic of the origin of the cyrillic script , but then i remembered who you were  and even as i am writing this i ask myself why did n't i just scroll on and leave you to it , why did i even give you the time of day but it might be too late to back out now , send help i do n't know what to do cyka blyaaat i feel it . 
  i feel the russophilia coursing through my slavic veins . 
  yeah , same here , and it fucking gets on my nerves , but i do n't wan na be like a stick in the mud and make a big deal of someone speaking srbglish , so my unexpressed rage goes on to slowly devour me from the inside . 
  older people are , but most of them do n't put it into perspective . 
  the only reason they were prosperous is because the big t borrowed money like no tomorrow . 
  like what they say about drinking `` when you drink you are just borrowing happiness from the next day '' . 
  we 're having the hangover of our lives . 
  car is literally emperor . 
  they have the word just do n't use that way . 
  croats use it sometimes in a derogatory manner , montenegrins and bosnians , even montenegrin and bosnian serbs , sometimes refer to serbs from serbia as `` serbians '' ( srbijanci ) which is not flattering at all imho, 
  fuckin ' join , greater serbia ai n't gon na create itself, 
  we could say `` zafrknuti '' , `` zeznuti '' , you know , things that would be acceptable to say in a broader crowd . 
  but i get what you mean now , it 's like `` nuts '' ( or rather jaja = eggs , here ) being testicles , things like that . 
  vulgar only in context . 
  - ancient civs - messopotamia , egypt , greece , rome - who are the slavs , how they settled in the balkans , founding of south slavic states - serbia in the middle ages , from principality ( vlastimirovi\u0107 , vojislavljevi\u0107 ) to kingdom to empire ( nemanji\u0107 ) to losing to the ottomans - serbia under turkish and habsburg rule ; basically how we managed to keep our culture and identity and thanks to who - who are the absolutist monarchies of europe and how they function - american and french revolutions and all the documents that came out of them - first and second serbian uprising , the fight for autonomy and independence , kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 and obrenovi\u0107 royal dynasties and their national plans - annexation crisis , the pig war , the first and second balkan war - wwi - kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenes / yugoslavia mk .1 - wwii - yugoslavia during the tito era - homeland wars ( '90s ) - assassination of \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 ( 2003 ) that 's about it , as you can see we focus much more on europe and our region itself , but if there 's a huge event with global effects we discuss it too . 
  well ... yeah ? 
  it 's not like we do n't have watered down versions of `` to fuck '' or `` to screw over '' , but you said it yourself , that ** is ** what it meant, 
  that makes a whole lot more sense than the standard french . 
  though it 's kinda grown on me now , y' know ? 
  like a family dog that learns to jump and twist the knob to open the door instead of passing through the doggy door . 
  it 's stupid but likeable . 
  wow , really ? 
  how do they do numbers from 70 upwards then ? 
  the founder of real aikido , vra\u010darevi\u0107 learned the classic techniques in japan , then adjusted them to his body type and culture , developing a specific style altogether . 
  he wrote many books on self defence , received countless awards , taught a plethora of presidential bodyguards from around the world , and also a guy you might have heard of ... ** steven seagal **, 
  i suppose so . 
  that 's why we get all these documentaries , what led up to , what was the cause of , see the build up for the first world war . 
  it was just a pot waiting to boil over , tension building for decades . 
  as wars go , this was a pretty not pointless one . 
  not one , not two , not three , but four empires fell as a result of it one way or another , not to mention the colonies dissolving , then it 's more . 
  the us military was somewhere around the size of romania 's military , but we 'll be damned if wwi did n't help them get a foot in the door of the big boy room . 
  the idea of `` you got a nation , you get a country '' was finally put into practice . 
  not to mention it more or less being the precursor and indirect cause of the next world war , which extinguished millions of lives and boosted our understanding of many technologies . 
  far from meaningless . 
  basically it began here . 
  we were a tiny newly independent country that had just come out of a series of wars since the liberation ( uprisings all throughout the 19th century , liberation in 1878 . 
  we fought not only for ourselves , but for our brothers in the neighbouring countries . 
  our military held their ground fiercely , but were ultimately forced to pull back when bulgaria entered the ring . 
  forced into retreat all through the craggy , unacommodating mountains of montenegro and albania , losing many to famine , sickness and attacks by the mountain tribes and central forces bombings . 
  the eventual triumph and charge north from greece back to serbia is seen as a sort of a phoenix rising moment . 
  the end of wwi is remembered as one of the most glorious moments in our history , not only did we defend our honour , but earned freedom for other countries still in shackles of foreign empires . 
  that 's the way it 's seen . 
  my opinion is that that `` glorious moment '' , might have very well been the last truly glorious moment we had . 
  we were n't our best in the second world war , and god knows it 's been downhill since the '80s . 
  i know crockett by his trademark hat , what he actually did in life , i have no clue . 
  the others are completely anonymous to me . 
  buses everywhere . 
  city-wise and intercity-wise , got ta say , the system works ** surprisingly ** well . 
  that 's it for the most part . 
  the capital has got trams too , and some also use trains to go from city to city , but buses are indubitably 1 #, 
  no need to worry , nothing actually distressing really happened . 
  when news like this rise up usually it 's a smokescreen or a distraction from something else though . 
  the pm is not a good person in my opinion , but i do n't think he 's in real danger of assassination , these are probably publicity stunts for us to be alarmed for the safety of our leader , or they 're pulling wool over our eyes . 
  however weird it might sound with serbia in mind , if the prospect of war is what 's worrying you , you need not worry . 
  it 's like ... 
  if someone poured honey into music notes , and then they were sung with vocal chords of gold and pearl , the sound echoing throughout a chamber of ivory and onyx , designed by the lord himself using the most virtuous of the cherubs to construct it . 
  probably [ the hymn of saint sava ] ( https://youtu.be/9xxuuppxklo ) , if that can qualify . 
  it 's the most well known song i can think of with religious motifs throughout . 
  it 's dedicated to st.sava , or rastko nemanji\u0107 by his birthname , a 12th century serbian prince who , as the story goes , ran away to the monasteries of mount athos in greece to become a monk . 
  he spent the rest of his life traveling the three continents ( near east , north africa , the balkans and italy afaik ) , educating himself , founding churches and monasteries with his father ( who later also became a monk ) doing minor political things in serbia , before he finally died of illness in bulgaria . 
  being the first archbishop of our church , sava 's accomplishments earned him a place in many folk tales and songs like this one . 
  basically the serbian st. patrick , but with royalty instead of slavery and no trademark colour . 
  he even had a cool [ scepter ] ( http://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/we2ktkqturbxy9jm2vmztuymjq0ytkxmtyzowjjzmzlognjyjy1ytc2ns5qcgvnk5uczqmuamldlqlnadyawsovb9kyl3b1bhnjbxmvturbxy8xzdc0y2i0mtcwntk1mdqznjyyownhymq2mdzmntbmni5wbmchwga ) , and now has a huge temple named after him [ dominating the belgrade skyline ] ( http://www.serbia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hram-svetog-save1.jpg ) edit : picture was shit , now it 's the shit, 
  `` yogurt '' implies it 's drinkable here , we use other words for thicker dairy that 's eaten , but yeah i 'm aware yogurt is something to be spooned up or mixed up with pieces of other food in other countries . 
  we do n't do that . 
  nobody accents more or less , simply every word inherently has an accent . 
  yours is just slower and more winding , while ours is quick and more striking . 
  though to be fair , you do use all 4 accents in our standard system while we just use two , i believe . 
  true , when it 's liquid yogurt like we - and i assume you too , have . 
  the bulgarian , greek and , as far as i 've heard turkish , are different , we usually have them sold in plastic cups of a sort . 
  drawn out and overly accentuated . 
  south side represent !, 
  i remember there was a brand that distributed some very good bagged milk and yogurt from some 10 years ago maybe , but i do n't remember specifics . 
  nowadays it 's mostly carton or plastic bottle . 
  not that weird a thing for it to be in a bag imo . 
  now i 'm yearning for it so thanks . 
  just what the fuck are you on about mate ? 
  ca n't say i did . 
  learning poetry by heart is part of our native language classes , foreign poetry too sometimes , but not in the original foreign language . 
  elementary ( 1st -8 th grade ) school touches very little , if at all on literature during foreign language classes , highschool does more in that respect , but i 've never been tasked with learning a poem in english or french ( those are the ones i 've studied in school ) by heart .
