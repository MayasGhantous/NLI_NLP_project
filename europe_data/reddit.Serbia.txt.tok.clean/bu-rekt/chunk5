  for all my commies out there !, 
  [ you can count on us !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/ge7kojxsgsc ) * they say we are carried by the wrong flow * * for playing our records and our rock n ' roll * * but in us the battles ' blaze 's not at rest * * and i 'm telling you what i know best * * you can count on us !, 
  * that 's what you get when you mix a socialist country with the groundshaking force that is rock 'n roll . 
  are we some sort of ... rakija rangers now ? 
  well like half of b&h has a huge boner for the ol' ottoman blokes , but the other half ... not so much . 
  yeah , most of them are household names , even if some people do n't know anything about when they wrote or what , most people atleast recognize the name as the name of a poet . 
  they are an unavoidable part of education , generally well known , but rarely anyone knows anything about our contemporary poets , with a few exceptions , nobody pays any mind to them . 
  he was ... a breath of fresh air so to say . 
  after the nineties , arguably the worst period in our modern history , he was someone that was clearly alligned with the west , a kind of a novelty here at the time , since politicians were either pro-russian nationalists , or still living in the delusion that we can walk the fine line between the east and west like we were still as relevant as yugoslavia once was . 
  i 'm inclined to say the young liked him much more . 
  his thing was that he wanted to cut ties with and turn against the criminals , some of which most likely got him the position he was in , which got him killed . 
  white bread eggs ajvar & ljutenica ( usually autumn and winter ) yogurt is a must , along with cheeses and other dairies peppers and paprikas , despite having ajvar too , hot peppers ~ ~ are appetizers ~ ~ open up your appetite some cold cut meat usually pickled veggies in the winter months pork for festivities, 
   serbian is taught in some schools wow that 's quite a stretch , is it generally a class kids struggle with ? 
  ( p.s. 
  civ v : france is probably my favourite , greece is my least favourite , so there 's no real life bias . 
  i also enjoy germany , poland and russia , in that order . 
  ah , the gospel of rambo . 
  an exquisite piece , though not quite as poignant in it 's anglified variant . 
  i do n't personally , but i know a lot of households here do the same thing you described , icons and crosses in cars and everything . 
  we were actually offered to join a bunch of times ( got ta check my sources tho . 
  and i realize that 's not a big deal , just saying ) . 
  we just wo n't out of principle . 
  good point . 
  the article did n't specify , just that he was taken in . 
  i think it 's perfectly reasonable to be allowed to defend yourself when your home is intruded , i actually thought that was the norm everywhere until fairly recently when i read than a very old man ( 85 + ) got arrested for shooting a burglar who was about to attack him . 
  i 'll link the article if i can manage to find it . 
  edit : could n't find it in english , but i made a couple of mistakes . 
  the man was 77 and it was 3 years ago , near banja luka , in bosnia . 
  that blonde she-devil !, 
  * like regular hell , but with lots of draft, 
  jesus christ , never realized things were that bad across the river ... 
  i know it 's dogshit here , but i figured you were doing atleast a bit better . 
  idk what else to say , good luck sorting that out then . 
  yeah . 
  three times , left-right-left or right-left-right . 
  among young people it 'd probably be once , but family and long time friends always kiss in threes when meeting , it 's a literal tradition . 
  our prez even embarrassed us by forcing a third kiss on the croatian president once which would be fine i guess if they were atleast meeting here , but he was on their home court . 
  ca n't be croatia ... really ? 
  i am honestly , unsarcasticaly surprised . 
  i mean , i know that the region 's corrupted af , but i 'd never imagine you 'd take the cake . 
  i 'd even put you near the bottom . 
  we kinda walk a thin line , because serbs generally like russians , but we also have a great relationship with you , yet you ca n't stand the russkies . 
  how i wish that were true, 
  here it 's usually a word used to refer to an ugly person , but as i understand , it 's the hungarian form of `` gabriel '', 
  wow , we have both those words in our language ( divan is used rarer nowadays ) , but it 's funny to see them in russian , seeing as they came from the turks , right ? 
  unless kebab what ? 
  the cros are n't kebabs , dude !, 
  europe has been very polarized in the usa/russia sort of way ever since the end of wwii . 
  nowadays usa has a major lead though ( eu + ) , but just because the denizens of a country can sometimes be anti-refugee or `` anti-muslim '' as you put it , does not mean that usa had anything to do with it . 
  oh and also i do n't think anyone is `` pro-turkey '' . 
  bosnia might be , but that 's about it . 
  happy independence , bros. . let 's hope for another couple of millenia of peacetime between us . 
  well both us , and you used to have different names for the months , we just accepted the christian nomenclature while croats reverted to the slavic one . 
  i 've read that we have around 4000 turkish loanwords , though honestly i think that number is either exagerated or takes into account a lot of words not used anymore . 
  if i had to guess how many turkish words have integrated themselves into our language so that they are still used on a regular basis , i 'd say 30 , 50 at most ( not counting food names ) . 
  the others i might recognize , but far from them being an essential unavoidable part of our language . 
  for example '' \u0107uprija '' in the name of the recommended novel is a turkish word for bridge , deliberately used here because of the story 's atmosphere , and the history of the vi\u0161egrad bridge itself , but nobody would ever use that word outside of that . 
  `` most '' is used in both day to day communication and official business . 
  like andri\u0107 's other novel , `` prokleta avlija '' , would n't sound as spooky if it were `` prokleto dvori\u0161te '' . 
  edit : oh yeah , and keep in mind that there 's more turcisms the further south you go , people from vojvodina would not use as much as someones from vranje . 
  the number i mentioned is probably an average . 
  imo it 's not to difficult to understand . 
  i come from the south though , so i have much less trouble understanding macedonians and bulgarians , but slovene is n't too big of a problem either . 
  wow thanks for the suggestions . 
  might take me a while , but i will read them . 
  and i totally forgot about cankar , reading atleast an exerpt from his `` desetica '' is mandatory in elementary school . 
  yeah but we kinda like that , cause we 're kinda like that . 
  bring a deagle and a strapon , if you come unprepared you have to use the [ serbomatic 1389 ] ( http://www.thehistoryblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/steampoweredvibrator.jpg ) . 
  i know it must seem fairly uncomfortable , but believe me , it feels much more cozy when you are at gunpoint and your face is full of some gangster 's k\u00e4sewurst . 
  it 's a shame we ca n't find a balance . 
  on the one hand , when you look at croats , they can go overboard with calcing and translating words and creating their own to keep the language pure , but on the other , fuck me if all these loanwords are n't annoying . 
  btw komp is a common slangword for it here too . 
  pozdrav !, 
  that 's how you improve your serbian though , by reading , is n't it ? 
  well we do touch on some ex-yu stuff . 
  to be precise , plenty of croats , mostly poetry . 
  the only slovenian thing i read was france pre\u0161erns `` sonetni venac '' , however it was translated . 
  you know how it is , i can understand you pretty well , but could n't say a thing in slovenian . 
  care to recommend some other piece ? 
  maybe i 'll put in the effort and even read it untranslated . 
  i am very glad i 've managed to get someone interested . 
  you will ** not ** regret the decision , i promise you . 
  take care stranger !, 
  whenever they seem to go out of use these days , it 's usually in favour of anglicisms , which i do n't particularly enjoy tbh . 
  things like upravnik / \u0161ef sale - menad\u017eer / manager ( when referring to restaurants , companies and stuff like that , not celebs then it 's always manager ) people sometimes use `` edukacija '' instead of `` obrazovanje '' , same meaning . 
  though this one is n't official . 
  there used to be a school subject called `` zemljopis '' , a direct calc of the word `` geography '' . 
  now it 's `` geografija '' . 
  in a coupled of books i 've noticed the words `` tvornica '' and `` fabrika '' were used side by side by serbs to mean `` factory '' . 
  nowadays the slavic calc `` tvornica '' is used in the purist language croatia , while the loanword `` fabrika '' is used here . 
  ra\u010dunar is rarer and rarer to hear these days . 
  `` kompjuter '' is used more often - computer . 
  ooooh like in the scandinavian languages !, 
  that 's so cool . 
  usually i do n't even think about it 's existence . 
  then i 'm reminded of it from time to time , and i chuckle . 
  `` gorski vijenac '' - ( ` the mountain wreath ' i suppose would be my off the top of my head translation of the title-petar petrovi\u0107 njego\u0161 ) an epic about serbs from montenegro ( the area which resisted and defied the turkish rule the longest ) and their struggle . 
  it 's rife with philosophical themes , every other verse could be a proverb . 
  `` hazarski re\u010dnik '' - ( `` the khazar dictionary '' - milorad pavi\u0107 ) a mindboggling novel written entirely through symbols , really needs to be read more than once to be sort of understood .
