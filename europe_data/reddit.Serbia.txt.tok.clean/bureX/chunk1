eastern europe so , following that logic , is greece a part of eastern europe ? 
  there are no croatian migrants . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_movement_for_workers not until 2018 . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partitions_of_luxembourg you know what to do . 
   just because they were part of austria ? 
  i do n't think we view that as a primary reason ... 
   did any of those countries offer anybody a chance for a united country and then soon after formation removed rights of all citizens that were n't of their nationality so they could dominate power ? 
  i know one country that did : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/independent_state_of_croatia :p, 
   backstabbing you right in the back it would n't be backstabbing if i backstabbed you in the forehead , now would it ? 
  and no , they 're not any more special in `` backstabbing '' than any other nation . 
  thanks oba ... er ... putin . 
  nope , no inhabitants , that 's why the whole thing is hush-hush . 
  there is another dispute : https://www.google.com/maps/@45.6016786,18.9366371,12z?hl=en actually , the whole border between croatia and serbia is fucked up , because serbia considers the danube to be a border , while croatia references old property/land books and draws out lines according to that . 
  nobody cares , to be honest , but most of the world accepts croatia 's version , while de facto the serbian version is the one in power . 
  ( i mean ... who the fuck is going to cross the danube to police a teeny tiny patch of land ?! ), 
  because of all this , there are some weird places like here : https://www.google.com/maps/@45.7777107,18.8782723,12z?hl=en a piece of land in croatia that 's technically serbia , but because neither serbia nor croatia claim it as their own , it 's technically no mans land . 
  serbia actually has quite good relations with both palestine and israel . 
  that twitter feed looks like a feed of some conspiracy nut , not of a diplomatic mission . 
  i do n't like today 's use of the word `` islamophobia '' ( because it 's used as a smear against those who criticize extremists ) , but this really is a clear case of pure , no-punches-pulled islamophobia . 
  i really do think israel can do better than this . 
  you 've got ta be fucking kidding me ... 
  so you 're gon na partition yourself off from a huge entity and stand shoulder to shoulder next to other global markets ... alone ? 
  good luck . 
  nice flair you have there . 
  w. . . why do you dislike us , ukraina-san ? 
  [ i know that feel bro . 
  when football turns into politics , the magic of the game is lost . 
  well , the intro alone was terrifying . 
  the mastermind : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llene7npjiu, 
  the wiki page on the bbc states that it 's owned by `` her majesty 's government '' . 
  is n't that it ? 
  bbc * world * . 
  and `` does n't '' implies that they censor themselves completely . 
  they do broadcast negative views , but in a biased ( sometimes `` washed out '' ) manner . 
  for example : http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-29196912 http://rt.com/uk/187344-bbc-scottish-independence-bias/ as far as state owned media goes , bbc is still usually the most neutral of them all . 
  bbc world ( not uk 's regional bbc programming ) will broadcast relevant news to former uk colonies , but uk 's influence in any of those issues is left out . 
  it 's like voa , rt , nhk : news from around the world , feelgood news from our broadcasting vicinity . 
  just not on us politics , as expected . 
  for uk and former uk colony issues - do n't watch the bbc . 
  for japanese issues - do n't watch nhk . 
  for us issues , do n't watch voa . 
  cnn , fox ... infotainment drek . 
  taking a dump on journalism , one load at a time . 
  cnn does have some good documentaries and reports , though , but they 're really not the norm . 
  for russian issues , do n't watch rt. 
  obviously do n't read ria nor watch rtr planeta . 
  cctv ... just do n't watch cctv . 
  voa ( voice of america ) has some nice reporting , but will gladly leave out us related news or issues behind , maybe include a few easily digested official statements . 
  rt is good at criticizing certain aspects of the us domestic and foreign policy , and they should , but god help you if you want to hear any news critical to russia and it 's actions . 
  nhk was all `` nothing 's going on here ... all is well '' after that fukushima business . 
  bbc will devote a hefty portion of their world news to the royal fucking wedding , conveniently leave out any mention of issues in the uk , and will often broadcast completely irrelevant random clips as breaking news . 
   siding with serbian terrorists ww1 was caused by serbian terrorists !!, 
  ! 1 wake up sheeple !, 
   serbia apparently , most of those asylum seekers are of romani and albanian origin ( most news agencies and european officials are shy to confirm this outright ) . 
  and no , they wo n't get their asylum papers , but while they 're waiting to be processed , they will get housed , fed and ** will receive some sum of money ** . 
  http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=26&amp;nav_category=12&amp;nav_id=663358 plenty of albanians from kosovo have crossed the kosovo-serbia administrative line and applied for serbian ids and passports ( since they were technically citizens of the former yugoslavia ) . 
  the kosovar passport is not visa-free for europe , and is very much useless most of the time ( other than to travel to macedonia , albania , montenegro and turkey ) , so this counts as a pretty neat hack . 
  eventually , these people get refused and come back to serbia/kosovo where they spend their money . 
  if they need more , the bravest of the bunch will change their name , take out a new passport and go right back in . 
  i believe germany and other eu countries have implemented a speedy asylum resolution system for certain european countries , so this problem is due to go away . 
  unfortunately , some people simply `` lose '' all their documentation , claim to be victims of all sorts of weird things , and game the system even more . 
  the result of so many asylum seekers brought forth the possibility of the reintroduction of the visa regime in serbia again , and this has made the anti-roma sentiment even greater because the average joe could lose their ability to travel freely because of false asylum seekers . 
  further pressures from the eu on serbia to `` cut down '' on these people ( how !? ), 
  was a subtle wink for border officials to do racial profiling on the roma and on albanians from the south when crossing the border : `` how long will you be staying for ? 
  do you have enough funding to sustain yourself during that time ? 
  can i see those funds ? 
  do you have enough luggage ? 
  '' , etc. 
   have you got any links for these threats ? 
  they were visible mostly on twitter , and were written in albanian . 
  ca n't speak a word of it . 
  regional news outlets said the police was on stand by because of claims that at least 100 fans have made it across the border and are heading for the stadium to attend : http://www.b92.net/sport/fudbal/vesti.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=14&amp;nav_id=911304 http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/sport.294.html:514642-albanski-navijaci-se-oglasavaju-iz-beograda-neka-nas-hapse-kupili-smo-ulaznice-i-bicemo-na-stadionu for days i 've read crap like `` they 're coming !, 
  '' , `` they 're not coming '' , `` they 're actually coming this time !, 
  '' , etc. 
  consider yourself lucky that you do n't understand either serbian nor albanian , because browsing through youtube or twitter right now is soul shattering . 
  if you dare use google translate , you 'll see what i mean when i say * threats * . 
  such hatred is something very few have ever experienced . 
  hell , the granddaughter of the former albanian pm , dasara maltezi , criticized the albanian players for acting like they did on the field , and got numerous threats before deleting her account : http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=15&amp;nav_category=167&amp;nav_id=912130 in albanian ( translated ) : https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sq&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2flajmifundit.al%2f2014%2f10%2fmbesa-e-berishes-pse-te-jemi-krenare-se-u-zume-me-grushta-ne-serbi%2f&amp;edit-text= ( the comments are even worse )  serbia is to blame here and i really do n't blame albania for refusing to play , for the safety of their players . 
  i believe both sides are to blame , but mostly the hooligans which we ca n't curb even after so many years . 
  we 've gone to the point where the stadiums are practically empty unless the raging fans arrive and pay the cost of a ticket , because regular folks , older fans and children do n't dare risk going to the game . 
  it 's a cycle . 
  you ca n't really give them a piece of your mind because they pay the bills . 
  the serbian football association did offer the albanian delegation to continue with the match on an empty stadium , which was refused . 
  safety was n't really an issue at that point , i believe , it 's just that the game has already been ruined . 
  you ca n't really play good football after such a hard incident . 
   however , really uefa should have seen this coming honestly , i thought there was going to be some brawling , but nothing to write home about . 
  this is really an exception . 
   one idiot with a provocative drone it was n't * one * idiot , surely ... and besides that , the fans were very much active . 
  especially online - twitter , online discussion forums , facebook were filled with insults and really bad threats for days from both sides . 
  to think that such hate pops up out of a simple football game is mind-boggling . 
  they acted like true dicks they are . 
   we can hardly say that both sides were atrocious if you actually require the fans to be present in their seats on the stadium to see how `` atrocious '' they can be , fine . 
  wait until we get to see a rematch in albania . 
  a vip spot for `` special '' albanian fans was present , and it did not fall under this agreement . 
  aside from that , the away fans were present , but possibly not on the stadium that evening . 
  they made threats online that they 'll be there anyway , despite the agreement between the two sides , and eventually they did organize themselves and they did fly the drone in . 
  genocidal chants ? 
  that 's just a normal tuesday for them . 
  try `` mafia ties '' , `` extortion '' , `` larceny '' and `` vandalism '' . 
  we have plenty of football fans , they just stay home and watch the game on tv , otherwise they have to deal with this shit .
