  but they do n't want our asylum , they want to reach an asylum center and claim asylum when they 're caught , and then they flee again for the border with hungary . 
  what does this say about them ? 
  what i also hate is the fact that they do n't give two shits about the countries they 're going to . 
  most of them do n't know any other language other than their own ... they do n't have any marketable skills . 
  what are they expecting to do with their life ? 
   it really sounds like you dont know a lot about what you are talking about i could put on my shoes and be at the hungarian border within 5 minutes by car , or 20-30 minutes by bike . 
  i live in a border town , i know what i 'm talking about . 
  it 's been a while , ever since shit started in syria ... we 've been seeing a few middle-eastern , tanned & short people walking around with backpacks . 
  we mostly had nothing against them , because we too were refugees once during the wars of the 90s . 
  however , people from all around are starting to arrive , white , brown , black , and they have to go through turkey ( which is not good enough for them ) , greece ( also not good enough for them ) , macedonia ( still not good enough ) , serbia ( nope , not good enough either ) ... and then they reach hungary , which they do n't wish to stay in , but it 's in the schengen zone and they get to travel freely to other european countries without any border checks . 
  because of all this , hungary is building a border with serbia as we speak . 
  serbs can travel freely in the eu ( which was n't the case until recently ) , but they can not work nor live in the eu , even though they wish they did . 
  if the eu grants these people free passage and gives them a shortcut , how will that be fair to all those who are going through legal channels to obtain a work visa and whatnot ? 
  again : what has been promised to these refugees ? 
  who is promising what ? 
  also : paranoid people in my vicinity are scared because most of the refugees are men , and they believe many of them are terrorists and whatnot . 
  there have been clashes near the border where i live . 
  the biggest issue i have with this kind of immigration is that there is no way to identify the people who are crossing the border - they could be anybody , a student or a murderer . 
  anyways , the migrants are coming from various african countries , algeria , syria , afghanistan , pakistan ( !? 
  ) , iraq , etc. 
  this is making me nervous . 
  i can understand people fleeing syria , but what about the rest ( especially pakistan ) ? 
  it appears there are widespread rumors going around these regions that europe is a safe haven for them . 
  i do n't like the sound of this . 
  also , why do n't the big oil-rich countries of the middle east help their neighbors ? 
  even bernie sanders said the us should make rich middle eastern countries step up and do something about wars in the middle east , instead of western nations constantly having to clean up all that mess ... 
  `` 95 % of children under the age of 14 caught for stealing are romanian gypsies '' ... wow, 
   there is a physicial difference . 
  does n't have to be . 
  at least where i live , most of the time you ca n't tell the difference until you notice their clothes and the way they talk . 
  oh shit ... hah , it 's still there !, 
  if it was made out of tin , they would have used it for a bbq , i guess . 
   i am not sure why he was there in the first place he was invited . 
  he would have gotten even more shit for not appearing . 
  he 's a dickhead who i hate with a passion , but he should n't have had stones thrown at him . 
  now he 's pretty much won this round . 
   none of the non-serbs you listed did anything wrong . 
  [ ** oric ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naser_ori%c4%87 )  the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia ( icty ) convicted naser ori\u0107 for failing to prevent the murder and inhumane treatment of serb prisoners . 
  ...  naser ori\u0107 was arrested on 3 october 2008 by bosnian police . 
  he was charged in november 2008 with ** extorting ** 240,000 bosnian marks ( $ 157,000 ) and ** illegal possession of weapons and ammunition ** . 
  [ ** thaci ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hashim_tha%c3%a7i )  tha\u00e7i is alleged to have extensive criminal links . 
  during the period of time when he was head of the kosovo liberation army , ** the washington times reported that the kla was financing its activities by trafficking the illegal drugs of heroin and cocaine into western europe ** . 
  kla supporters say that the kla received funds from the albanian diaspora in the us and the albanian , united kingdom , and united states governments . 
  wonderful , wonderful people !, 
  there are plenty of serbs who have got out from the icty without a scratch , and they 're still crooks and evildoers in my eyes . 
  seselj could potentially get out of there too ... does that mean i would suddenly like the guy ? 
  hell no . 
  just because some people managed to tuck their balls in and flee the icty does n't mean they did n't do anything wrong . 
  also , the organizers of the srebrenica memorial event said they would postpone everything if naser oric is not released from custody . 
  yes , the convicted war criminal and extortioner . 
  at the same time , the government of the republic of srpska in bosnia keep downplaying ratko mladic 's crimes and the like . 
  in case you have n't noticed , ** bosnia is fucked up ** , and the balkans in general do n't fare much better . 
  whether you decide to label it a genocide or not is irrelevant in my eyes ... 
  i really , really do n't care . 
  i personally view it as a genocide , but who gives a fuck . 
  what i do care about is the perpetrators getting caught , and people living in peace once again . 
  what i do have issues with is this : - the bosnian war is being condensed into `` srebrenica '' . 
  this is a fucked up thing to do . 
  over 100000 people have been killed in this war , and ignoring them all in favor of only the srebrenica massacre is very much dumb . 
  - srebrenica is being used for political gains . 
  the last few weeks were brutal in the news . 
  - it 's been 20 years , it 's time to let a few things go . 
  serbs usually refuse to call srebrenica genocide because it 's directly connected to them emotionally . 
  if someone calls it `` genocide '' , they feel like somebody is blaming them personally for what has happened . 
  there are also people who have lost friends and family members in the war , and when their deaths are ignored constantly in favor of the srebrenica massacre , they get angry : `` what about the serb casualties ? '', 
  - they say , `` thousands of serbs were killed too '' . 
  what 's that supposed to mean ? 
  but that 's different because i do that , damn it !, 
   and that it will be his country that will be stuck with the immigrants instead of hungary the immigrants are already dumped on us from kosovo , macedonia , greece , bulgaria , etc. 
  i live in a border town , and the police chase down black and brown people every damn day . 
  just a few days ago , they were beating an african man with a baton in front of me , prompting me to yell at them until they noticed me and stopped . 
  vucic is a shitlord , but pleace notice that we already provide asylum services and housing to immigrants , but they just do n't want to stay here at all !, 
  they pick up their asylum papers and run off to hungary . 
  also , eu officials have condemned the idea of building a fence . 
   forcibly fingerprinting gypsies comes with its own set of problems . 
  at least in serbia , once you turn 18 , you are obliged to carry a national id card . 
  before receiving an id card , you need to give a fingerprint of your index finger . 
  if you end up with a criminal record , you will need to give prints for all of your fingers . 
  help , i 'm being oppressed !, 
  it 's in my flair - serbia . 
  any kind of religious extremism is a threat to european culture . 
  the kind of islam that is being practiced in the middle east is a threat . 
  islam from parts of my country is not . 
  i live just below the hungarian border , and i would n't be affected that much even if they planted a huge wall . 
  maybe then we 'd stop being constantly monitored by our border guards whenever we go hiking near the border . 
  i 've noticed plenty of syrians , afghanis and people from various african countries strolling around , and we have no qualms with them . 
  nobody will rat them out to the police , for three reasons : 1 . 
  we empathize with them . 
  they 're running from a conflict and are seeking a better life . 
  we hate our police . 
  we do n't want to become ultra-racist asswipes who call in the police on any sign of a slightly darker person waltzing around in our border town . 
  so ... hungary 's demands are downright silly . 
  oh , really ? 
  and at this moment , the southern border is * open * to migrants ? 
  both hungarian and serbian border guards fly around in choppers and sweep the area with heat-sensing devices constantly . 
  but all of this is happening because kosovo , macedonia and greece ca n't keep their shit together . 
  neither was anyone in yugoslavia . 
  serbia here ... yes . 
  i 'm not kidding , it 's not a stereotype . 
  you will get stabbed .
