  szabadka here ... there wo n't be any hungarians here soon , they 're all leaving for greener pastures in austria , germany , canada , sweden , etc. 
  i would n't say they 're superior ... http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/no-job-pay-up-belarus-imposes-fines-for-being-unemployed/518581.html wiki :  official unemployment rate is lower than 1 % . 
  methods of international labour organization ( international standard ) also include job-seekers who are not registered officially . 
  ** many unemployed people in belarus are trying to avoid registration , because of obligatory public works , while unemployment benefits are very low ( ~ 70,000 byr per month , or less than $ 10 ) **, 
  belarus should n't be on that list ... it 's methods of dealing with unemployment are pretty weird . 
   the thing on bottom right of `` 2 '' looks like a piece of gruesome propaganda to me . 
  you can thank the `` russian baddies '' for that ... anything written in cyrillic makes you think it comes from the claws of kgb . 
  it says : `` the first afroamerican elected as president of the us '' `` obama for change '' '' - whole world expects big changes for the better '' - '' - serbian politicians hope for better relations with the us '', 
  objection : it looks like a floppy dick, 
  we unite and fight our oppressors . 
  afterwards , we fight amongst ourselves .

   other serbian commentators might disagree with you ... https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/35ukmk/serbians_unveil_russian_flag_and_sing_katyusha_in/cr88ct7, 
  the banner in the back says `` glory to russia , ukraine and serbia '' . 
  option a : albanian ultranationalists are attacking a sovereign state and are performing acts of terrorism . 
  option b : these attacks have been orchestrated by the government to gather support for their cause . 
  i do n't know about you , but both option a and b sound like macedonia 's in for a wild ride . 
  either macedonia 's in a war , or it 's being run by a government so evil and corrupt that it needs to fake attacks and incite death to gather support . 
  first of all , you 've chosen `` gazetaexpress '' as a source , which is obviously biased and does n't mention the 3 macedonian policemen who got killed . 
  it does n't also mention that there 's a goddamn firefight going on in kumanovo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lpbytoyp-0 ... it 's not a simple case of police brutality for pete 's sake . 
  also , the picture in the article you 've posted has graffiti '' \u0413\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0440\u0438 , \u0442\u043e \u0441\u043c\u043e \u043c\u0438 '' , which is a football hooligan group made out of fans of the belgrade football club partizan . 
  are you sure that picture was taken in kumanovo ? 
   statues should be built to honor the genocide victims of serbs . 
  you 're not being serious , surely ? 
  every damn ww2 statue i know was dedicated to the victims of fascism , not to the victims of `` the germans '' ... now you 're gon na brand a whole nationality as being responsible for a genocide ? 
  http://apps.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/results.aspx?perpetrator=720  need i remind anyone that kla were qualified by nato as `` freedom fighters '' ? 
  big deal , so were the taliban by the us . 
  and milosevic was a `` factor of peace and stability '' too . 
  they had to pick a side between dung and poo , and they picked one . 
  they sided with the smaller one after yugoslavian authorities utilized excessive force to civilians as repercussions to kla activities . 
  the same kla had it 's branch u\u00c7pmb and was left to rot in the presevo valley , unlike in kosovo : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insurgency_in_the_pre%c5%a1evo_valley ... which was followed by : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insurgency_in_the_republic_of_macedonia my point being ... acting like a constant victim of serb persecution is getting really , really old , and is used as a neat way to cover up economical and social issues in politics . 
  while we 're at it , the kosovo government should apologize to thousands of roma who fled kosovo after being branded as `` serb collaborators '' . 
  which should immediately be followed by an apology from kosovo . 
  need i remind anyone that the kla was considered to be a terrorist organization by the world before 1999 ? 
  this just shows how much data has google maps gathered in certain countries . 
  http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=21&amp;nav_category=167&amp;nav_id=983398 this recent article ( in serbian ) claims the kla has assumed responsibility , as reported by certain media outlets in pristina .

   ** a ** burned church ? 
  it was a little more than a burned church ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/march_2004_unrest_in_kosovo, 
  yeah , but keeping said heritage in good condition is easier said than done . 
  http://i.imgur.com/mfildbp.png i really like how you can celebrate the declaration of independence of kosovo with an ** albanian ** flag . 
   its about getting equal oppurtunities . 
  we are the only people in europe that can not travel without visa not true . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_ukrainian_citizens http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_belarusian_citizens http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_turkish_citizens even so , you are able to seek employment in the eu if you follow the proper procedures . 
  it 's hard as fuck , i 'll give you that , but you can . 
  if you achieve visa liberalization , you will not have a right to live and work in the eu . 
  you are only free to travel and leave your money in the eu . 
  unless you 're talking about working in the eu off the books , well ... that 's a different story . 
  the eu believes that granting you visa-free travel within it 's borders will either pose a security risk ( doubtful ) , or ( more likely ) will lead to a great deal of labor of kosovo citizens on the black market . 
  the latter is constantly a threat for our visa-free travel arrangements . 
   if we want to unite with albania , why shouldnt we be allowed to ? 
  because kosovo did not lobby for such a thing . 
  when kosovo 's leaders turned their eyes to the leaders of the western world , they did not present them with a greater albania project ... they presented them with a `` free country '' called kosovo , with albanian and serbian as it 's official languages , with immense rights ( on paper , at least ) for the ever shrinking serbian minority , with a safe haven from belgrade . 
  while serbia does not recognize you as a country , you have made a promise . 
  if you wish to ditch that promise and join albania , you wo n't find any takers for such a country ( other than maybe turkey ) . 
  edi rama is currently just testing the waters and is waiting for a reaction , but i believe he 's pushing his luck . 
   why was east germany allowed to unite with west germany ? 
  because it was always germany , for hundreds of years , and it was divided unwillingly and occupied by foreign powers during the cold war . 
  when they eventually reunited , they did so by convincing others that their new country wo n't be a third reich for the german lebensraum or whatever ...  the eu is not needed here . 
  the nato is needed . 
  if any country in the balkans tries to solve a political conflict by military means the nato should put a quick halt to it . 
  why does n't nato allow ukraine to join ? 
  because then , nato will actually risk a conflict right from the get go . 
  the same goes for kosovo . 
  nato will keep out of this one ... they 're dealing with russia , not our petty balkan squabbles . 
   the eu is creating complete political standstill i see this excuse often in my country as well ... 
  the eu is not doing much of anything . 
  if the eu has that much of an influence that it can create a complete political standstill , ask yourself how much of a independent country you really are . 
  we often blame the eu for many things , and if we 're down on our luck , we turn to the eu and curse their stupid plans and promises . 
   if that means zero development , complete standstill , then so be it it 's all up to you . 
  if you ca n't stand on your own two feet , the eu does n't want to carry you . 
  and they 're right ; why should some salary man in spain , latvia , germany or bulgaria work and pay taxes so that you could get out of the gutter ? 
  the best thing the eu may want to do is to make sure kosovo is stable enough to not be a constant source of refugees , that you 're `` safe '' to the point where they can deny you asylum . 
  ultimately , the eu does n't own you anything . 
  then again , you have declared yourselves to be independent - why are you looking at the eu for constant aid ? 
  that goes for serbia , bosnia , albania , macedonia and montenegro as well . 
  the question of eu membership in serbia is now in the hole of apathy , and that hole has just now begun to engulf kosovo as well . 
  you 're slowly realizing the hard truth : the eu is a partnership , not a charity , and you 're on your own . 
  edi rama knows that , and will gladly grab attention from kosovo or the presevo valley for his own political gains . 
  that 's why he comes up with these wacky speeches about unification . 
   corn http://www.indexmundi.com/agriculture/?commodity=corn more like the 68th largest producer of corn . 
  serbia is 15th . 
   wheat http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_wheat_production_statistics serbia 's on there near the bottom , but i ca n't see albania even register on the list . 
   tobacco does it matter ? 
  http://www.who.int/tobacco/communications/events/wntd/2004/tobaccofacts_nations/en/  figs around 10th place . 
  this is correct . 
  albania produces a lot of figs , and has the right climate for them , obviously . 
  `` kosovo is serbia '' - a nationalistic chant which was mostly popular a few years ago when kosovo declared itself independent . 
  nowadays , it can be used as a joke , since mostly only patriotic youtubers spew it . 
  you may wan na learn the difference between serbia and republika srpska . 
  republika srpska ( a part of bosnia and herzegovina ) did not have anything to do with kosovo , the kosovo war or the 1999 . bombing of yugoslavia/serbia . 
   and is there something so essential in serbian dependence on russia agricultural exports . 
  and yes , i 'm being serious . 
   like the rest of the civilized world did it ?
