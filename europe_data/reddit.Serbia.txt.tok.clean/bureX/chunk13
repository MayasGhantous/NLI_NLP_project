  as far as i know , the greek pm will visit , and so will the czech president . 
   channelnewsasia.com to remember cause rt.com moves mysterious ways . 
  okay . 
  http://ca.reuters.com/article/topnews/idcakbn0my18l20150407  ** the unification of albania and serbia 's majority-albanian former province of kosovo is `` inevitable '' ** , whether it happens through membership of the european union or not , albania 's prime minister said on tuesday . 
   serbia should decide if it supports irredentist russia or the european order/international law . 
  now imagine russians asking if you support a `` just russia '' or the `` fascist ukrainians '' ... then re-read your question again . 
  you ca n't phrase questions like that . 
  if serbia would support `` irredentist russia '' , it would have recognized crimea as it 's part a long time ago , along with afghanistan , cuba , nicaragua , north korea , syria and venezuela . 
   european order/international law do n't talk to serbs about international law ... 
  resolution 1244 is still echoing in their ears . 
  it 's not a charade ... serbia 's acting like nothing has happened , as it considers that to be in it 's best interest . 
  it does not accept crimea 's secession just like it does n't accept kosovo 's secession . 
  business as usual . 
  not going to this military parade risks more for serbia than you can imagine . 
  unlike other people from various eu countries here who consider this treason or something , they have to realize serbia has to survive economically and politically for ( at least ) the next 10 years . 
  pat on the backs for boycotting a simple military parade wo n't cut it . 
  no encouragement came from the eu about any further ascensions ; serbia will be on it 's own for some time . 
  same for serbia . 
  i was drafted , but did not serve at the last moment because conscription was abolished in 2011 . 
  i would have wasted 6 months to a year basically doing nothing . 
  maybe i could stand behind a basic military training , in which you could serve on weekends or in the afternoons so you do n't get sacked from your job , and after you 've mastered the basics - that 's that . 
   instead of rewarding serbia 's efforts , european commission president jean-claude juncker , as one of his first actions in office , ** halted eu enlargement until at least 2020 ** . 
   although , realistically speaking , serbia 's accession to the eu before 2020 would have come as a surprise , juncker has sent a clear message : eu enlargement - and ** the accession of serbia ** , in particular - ** is not a high priority for the new commission ** . 
  well , i guess that 's that . 
  just try not to use cluster bombs . 
  those little shits fail to blow up all the time , and just hang around for people to find them years later . 
  you seem upset . 
   is there a sense of competition between you guys mostly between croatia and serbia . 
  slovenia is out of our zone of competition , bosnia and macedonia are not really doing all that well and do not present any competition and all , montenegro is far too small . 
  yeah , mostly croatia . 
  however , croatia is now in the eu , so ... it would appear we 're kinda stuck in apathy . 
  this is a very good wikipedia article , and i usually link it to others because people generally have no clue about what our obligations and goals are . 
  we just do n't know what needs to be done , and our politicians gladly hide that info from us because it 's ** their ** responsibility , after all !, 
  instead , they try to play the `` we 're heading towards the eu '' card constantly , without ever giving a true progress report of any kind . 
  to add a bit of perspective ; in serbia , either in the public or in the media , accession to the eu is looked at as if it 's a `` yes/no '' question . 
  it 's dealt with one issue at a time . 
  in one news piece or article , one politician from germany , france , italy , essentially any eu country says serbia needs to recognize kosovo for it to become a member . 
  the public is upset . 
  all of their work , all of these reforms , all these savings measures ... and it all boils down to * fucking kosovo * ? 
  a few days later , another politician states that recognizing kosovo as a country is not in any way a condition that serbia needs to fulfill , adding that only good relations are required . 
  rinse and repeat . 
  it used to be that way for our war criminals in hiding . 
  an atmosphere of misinformation has spread ... apparently all serbia needed to do is to somehow arrest these people , and all will be well . 
  after a while , these people were apprehended , much to the delight to all involved , as serbia has finally done it 's duties related to the hague . 
  however , eu officials just came straight with new demands about kosovo . 
  so , yeah , we have good cops and bad cops reigning on us , one telling us `` the reality of the situation '' , the other telling us `` serbia 's doing very well and will be in the eu in no time '' . 
  it 's been this way since 2000 . 
  i remember in 2001 . there were analysis which stated that serbia should become an eu member in the distant year of 2012 . 
  `` no , that 's too long ! '', 
  - i said . 
  well , look at us now . 
  because of this , there is hardcore pessimism present in the general public regarding the eu . 
  i 'm scared we 'll go the way of turkey , where on one hand we have an active process of eu integration , and on the other we have a country full of shit . 
  ( no offense meant , turkey , but internet censorship in europe in the 21st century ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  you 're turning into some weird hurkadurkistan or something ... ) many eu laws found their way into serbia , and i applaud that , because without them , serbia would still have old-ass laws and shitty legislations . 
  it sounds like we 're being forced to adopt them in order to slurp the sweet ooze that are eu funds and privileges , but damn it , if that 's the only way , i 'll take it . 
  i just hope that these chapters are opened and actually worked on , not just chucked in the drawer ... 
   petty imperialism wut no ... 
  seriously ... what ? 
  serbia supports a unified bosnia and does n't plan on joining up with republic of srpska any time soon . 
  albania/kosovo should take a lesson from that instead of dancing around with `` national unity '' and whatnot . 
  while most of the balkans have completely done away with territorial qualms , albania/kosovo are still at it with great albania or whatever it 's called , which includes parts of serbia , montenegro , macedonia and greece . 
  i live in a region with serbs , croats , hungarians , slovaks , etc. 
  and never ever have we had any noise like the albanians from southern serbia are able to produce . 
  i do n't know if it 's the high unemployment rates , or just a weird mentality , but i really dislike this greater albania bullshit . 
  we all had our greater serbia , croatia and albania projects during the 90s , sure , but that time has passed and we need to move on . 
   vojislav seselj so ... what else is new ? 
  ahhh , / r/europe ... never change ... 
  look at all these ethnic cleansers ... http://i.imgur.com/1mggvie.jpg, 
   `` in order not to forget - no to nato , '' was organized by the belgrade forum for the world of equals and the club of generals and admirals . 
  who the hell are these people ? 
  and what a time it was ... to add salt to the wound , my grandfather died in an accident in neighboring croatia , and only my mom could smuggle herself across the border to attend her father 's funeral . 
  my dad could n't go because he 's an able bodied male . 
  one good thing is that eventually there was no power anywhere , so from the immense dark you could see a clear starry night . 
  it was beautiful , until you could hear the jets buzzing around ... 
  from the very link you 've posted :  the only united nations member who recognised the republic of kosova was albania , with a resolution recognising the country passed in the parliament of albania on 21 october, 
  no country exists unless the animaniacs say it does : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x88z5txbc7w thank you and goodnight !, 
   1991 surely you must be joking ... 
  i 'm not saying there 's not a majority for independence , but those elections are n't recognized by anybody . 
  pretty much all of our airforce is made out of russian ordinance . 
  if we hold good relations with russia , we * may * get some more [ mig batteries ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=02&amp;nav_id=91478 ) !, 
  tl ; dr : we 've got migs , we need parts , and serbs do n't really like nato that much . 
  quite accurate . 
  can vojvodina into poland ? 
   who do n't like each other we like each other , just give us enough alcohol . 
  man , i constantly order tomato and pepper seeds from the netherlands , and this is the thanks i get !, 
  get hype until 14h , 29.7 % of registered voters turned out to vote .

  borderlessinternet or playmo.tv work for the time being . 
  i 've got netflix and i dick around with dns proxies to get the us library . 
  without the us library , netflix simply is n't worth it . 
  actually ... yes !, 
  it 's important to notice that plenty of refugees were writing `` merkel , help ! '', 
  and `` we want germany '' signs only a few weeks ago when dealing with closed borders . 
  this propagated belief is engraved in the minds of many , and it needs to be shattered . 
  does n't matter if merkel actually said it . 
  does n't matter , the word is out there : http://i.imgur.com/sdw504e.jpg, 
  i want my human rights to free lodging and citizenship to any country i see fit . 
  apparently there are ( or were ? ),
