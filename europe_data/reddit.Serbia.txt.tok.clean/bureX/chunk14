  some issues regarding exporting these magnificent peppers to the eu . 
  something about rigorous safety standards or something ... do n't know if that 's resolved or not . 
  he is a harmless joker nationalist - now . 
  20-30 years ago , it was a different story . 
  lol , he actually lost his shit over a youtube video !, 
  turkey is ripe for the eu , i say !, 
  i was in 4th grade . 
  do n't compare a dog to their families , dude ... 
   that has not been my experience with serbians . 
  perhaps the serbian diaspora , as they are ... well ... a bit more on the nationalistic side . 
  and when i say `` a bit '' , i mean `` a fuckton '' . 
  my experience is more like 50/50 . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4br9cb/serbia_marks_anniversary_of_start_of_nato_bombing/ and to answer your question ... yes , things could have been solved differently . 
  milosevic had overstayed his welcome , but this outcome has permanently severed certain ties of serbia with the west , and now y' all have a potential russian hotspot in the middle of europe . 
  because nationalism . 
  try to look any american in the face and say the war in vietnam/iraq was wrong . 
  you 'll either get told you 're right , or you 'll get branded as a commie or some other pejorative . 
  it 's the same in serbia . 
  `` sure , this guy and that guy did kill a bunch of people , but they 're serbs , so let 's find out how we can whitewash the whole thing . '', 
  if novak djokovic would pull a gun on murray and shoot him point blank in the face , you 'll find people claiming that murray had it coming and that it was his fault . 
  why ? 
  because djokovic is serbian . 
  i always thought it was a modified awacs for some reason ... thanks for the correction !, 
   we will as soon as you can point them out . 
  you 're getting a special court for war crimes in kosovo , it 's all over the news . 
  you would n't be getting one if there were n't any war crimes . 
   the end of the day you said yourself that the serb military was killing women and children yes , we all know that and we 're ready to admit it . 
  it 's up to you to admit that the kla killed women and children as well . 
   adem jashari was one of the few who could defend the helpless so in that sense he absolutely is a hero i swear , the balkans are a huge shithole . 
  the croats are praising gotovina , the serbs in rsk are naming schools after radovan karadzic , and the albanians are naming their airport after jashari . 
  all `` heroes '' . 
  first of all , it was pretty weird that a bunch of kosovo albanians voted for milosevic , is it not ? 
  the elections were rigged every time . 
  go ask international transparency groups about that , and they 'll confirm . 
  but yes , milosevic had tons of support ... but have you ever wondered why ? 
  have you ever heard milosevic speak ? 
  not once did he utter `` death to the croats '' or `` death to the albanians '' ... he was a man who has spoken the word `` peace '' more than freakin ' ghandi . 
  what he said , what he presented on tv , what he said he was gon na do , it was all completely different than what he actually did . 
  he was a liar . 
  `` we want you to keep your money in serbian banks '' = `` we want to steal your money '' `` we want to protect the serbs in croatia '' = `` let 's fuck up croatia so bad not even a single brick is left standing '' `` peace in bosnia is paramount '' = `` we 'll just throw in a bunch of weapons over there to the serbs and , oooh , what 's that ? 
  a civil war ? 
  gee ... '' `` we want to keep peace in kosovo '' = `` let 's throw in a bunch of notorious paramilitary forces and see what happens '' an average joe in serbia had no reason not to vote for him . 
  slovenian is much more different , but if they speak simply and slowly , we can understand them somewhat . 
  slovenia did enter the war only for a short time : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ten-day_war the yugoslavian ( majority serbian ) government decided it was too much trouble to go against the grain and attack slovenia with full force , so it was let go to do it 's own thing . 
  if you have the time , there is a very good bbc documentary about the dissolution of yugoslavia : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oodjsdlosyo, 
  croats and serbs understand each other perfectly , it 's pretty much the same language . 
  hungarians usually spoke good serbian , they were born here , if not , they would learn the basics quickly . 
  my hungarian friend was drafted in the military in 1999 . 
  one day , they evacuated every last person from the army barracks where they were staying ... after a few days , it was bombed . 
  phew . 
  they 've spent countless nights in ditches with old run down ak47s in their arms . 
  he 's in the uk as of a few months ago . 
  one interesting thing he told me : `` my superiors yelled at me and gave me shit for any reason ... but after the war started and we all got to carry around loaded weapons , they were very polite and understanding '' . 
  here 's a map of vojvodina ( northern serbia ) : http://i.imgur.com/tepsgcw.jpg blue = serb majority , green = hungarian majority , red = croatian majority , yellow = romanian majority , etc. 
  oh boy ... let me tell you , they were n't in the capital . 
  they fled elsewhere and did just fine . 
  milosevic 's home was bombed , and obviously he was n't home at the time . 
   why would kosovar albanians not be proud of him because he was an uneducated idiot . 
   according to the journalist tim judah , jashari `` hated the serbs , and although he was one of the kla 's early recruits , he was no ideological guerrilla . '', 
  another source recounted : `` he liked to get drunk and go out and shoot serbs . '' blinded by propaganda ? 
  reevaluate your position . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_liberation_army  the kosovo liberation army was an ethnic-albanian paramilitary organisation that sought the separation of kosovo from the federal republic of yugoslavia ( fry ) during the 1990s ** and the eventual creation of a greater albania ** it was about political influence and territory . 
  similar organizations have existed since 1982 , during yugoslavia , even . 
  it takes two to tango ... the albanian side wanted independence and the creation of greater albania , the serbian side wanted a creation of a greater serbia . 
  you 're both wrong and you 're both idiots . 
   like . . holy shit man leave now before armageddon hits you from the sky you ca n't . 
  first of all , the state tv stations made it sound like that would n't happen . 
  there was no panic . 
  as soon as the bombing started , all borders were closed . 
  no one was to get out or in . 
   serbian military did n't fight armed men yes , they did . 
  for pete 's sake , even your renamed airport in pristina is named after adem jashari , an * armed * guerilla soldier , a hero of kosovo of which you are proud of . 
  yes , the paramilitaries did enter villages `` suspected of aiding the kla '' and cause havoc , killing women and children , but do n't simplify all of this ... 
  2 inches , you say ? 
   fringe regions kosovo was not a fringe region , it was specifically a region where things were happening . 
  i was coming back home from karate practice , when me and my friends heard sirens in the distance ... we were scared shitless . 
  i hurried home , and asked an older man `` sir , has the war begun ? '' ... 
  the man looked at me as if he has seen a ghost , `` i heard sirens in the distance '' , i said . 
  the man , too , became scared shitless and offered to drive me home , but i refused as i was within walking distance . 
  i came home , telling my mom and dad about the things i 've heard , but there was nothing on the news ... dad tried to use some old antenna to receive croatian tv - hrt so we could actually see and hear what was going on . 
  as he was doing that , nearby sirens went off ... 
  i picked up the phone and immediately got a busy signal . 
  we went down as soon as we could only to find that the local bomb shelter left from the cold war was closed . 
  people gathered , many were crying , it was n't fun . 
  we watched tv until the early morning , hoping to see something , but the state rts tv only stated that the fascist nato aggressors have begun their attacks . 
  the sirens blurted out an `` all clear '' command in the early morning , and i asked my dad if i could go to school . 
  my dad , confused and worried , still allowed me to do so . 
  nevertheless , the school locked us in and called our parents to come for us . 
  after a few days , the first time my town was attacked , i saw 3 `` mushrooms '' from my balcony . 
  they simply appeared one by one , followed by a deathly silence , followed by a detonation ... the whole building shook . 
  much like in a lightning storm , you see a flash , then only after a few seconds do you hear the thunder . 
  the second time i woke up at 4am to see my parents looking out the window in the direction of [ pali\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pali%c4%87 ) , and the sky on the horizon suddenly became red and yellow - the weather station in pali\u0107 was bombed . 
  oftentimes nato planes were riding the skies at low altitudes , letting out a really scary sound . 
  horror movie shit . 
  leaflets were thrown out of these planes , telling us that nato is our friend and that milosevic is a war criminal . 
  kids collected these for fun . 
  here is a gallery of them : http://www.psywarrior.com/bosniaherb.html after fucking up most of our tv infrastructure , [ awacs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airborne_early_warning_and_control ) planes circled around , broadcasting over ( now very low powered ) tv channels , they broadcasted nato tv : http://i.imgur.com/jtbe6dd.jpg after nato saw that yugoslavia ai n't budging from it 's position , they used carbon based bombs to disable the power grid . 
  one night the lights went out came back on for a faint second , then went out again ... this time for good . 
  the sky was clear as fuck , i never saw so many stars . 
  water processing plants stopped functioning due to the lack of electricity , so we had no water .
