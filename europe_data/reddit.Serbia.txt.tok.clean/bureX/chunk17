  `` rule britannia '' and whatnot , sure ... but the new reality is that only a united eu can survive in this economy . 
  it was either on a bbc presentation or maybe i saw it elsewhere on youtube , but this does happen . 
  not in serbia , though ... which is fortunate , but lifting of the skirt or displaying a vagina is a sort of crude `` fuck you '' . 
  not here . 
  if a `` white '' person did n't send their kids to school and sent them to beg in front of a mall instead , they would get their asses arrested and their kids taken from them . 
  there would be outrage . 
  but if a romani person does it , then we see it as something that `` just is '' . 
  this is socially acceptable racism . 
  what about the opposition in kosovo ? 
  they claim they want to have the right to unify with albania . 
  i agree that the eu should be strong with their sanction policy , but i was expecting more progress from ukraine , to be honest . 
  if sanctions start to drop , i 'm guessing we 'll see one huge surge of disappointment in ukraine . 
  #all of them . 
  i have no idea why anyone thought that would be a nice thing to have . 
  servicing a smart car like that , especially in croatia , is a freaking nightmare . 
  if i remember correctly , you 're supposed to dismantle the whole thing just to get to the battery !, 
  okay , let me try ...  dmitri rogozin announced moscow 's intention to arm serbia with sophisticated weaponry , including s-300 surface-to-air missiles that 's because croatia will be receiving some outdated nato long range missiles , and obviously serbia is throwing a fit about it . 
  `` we thought this was peacetime !, 
  if you 're going to acquire assault weapons , we 're going to acquire defense weapons '' . 
  russia will sell their older s300 model for quite a bit of money to serbia , ka ching . 
   but serbia 's refusal to impose sanctions on russia serbia refuses to impose sanctions on russia because we 're dirt poor and broke . 
  we would get nothing in return other than a pat on the back . 
  if serbia were to impose sanctions , the people would view it as pure ass-kissing . 
   and right-wing political leaders ' open support for crimea 's re-incorporation with russia they 're mostly dveri , dss and srs , which make up less than 10 % in total of the overall voting body . 
   this normative synergy caused belgrade to implicitly support russian conduct towards ukraine and turkey . 
  there was no formal support for russia 's actions , but instead we were comparing crimea to kosovo . 
  `` why is crimea not ok , but kosovo is ok ? '' . 
  serbia does not recognize crimea as a part of russia . 
  turkey is not seen favorably by serbia because it 's trying to establish it 's old ottoman presence in bosnia , kosovo and serbia . 
  erdogan even went so far as to state `` kosovo is turkey '' when he was on his tour in kosovo . 
  oh , and there 's also that 500 years of ottoman torture the balkans have endured under turkish rule . 
  anyway , in 1999. , serbia was ostracized and bombed by nato , thus fueling huge anti-western sentiment , and russia feeds on that . 
  after 2000. , when milosevic was ousted , there was a growing pro-eu sentiment , ** over 70 % of the population was pro eu in 2003 ** . 
  after the declaration of kosovo 's independence , anti eu feelings swept all over . 
  and after all that , russia lends a helping hand with `` support and understanding '' ( even though no monetary gain is acquired ) . 
  that 's actually quite a smart move ... sell old stuff to collectors , buy new equipment .

   a man said he sexually assaulted the 10-year-old boy in a cubicle because he had not had sex for four months and he had `` followed his desires '' no , no ... you see , you did that because you 're a pedophilic homosexual , but you can tell allah whatever the fuck you want if that makes you happy . 
  god damn that sound ... 
   what are the smugglers telling these guys ? 
  everything they want to hear . 
  it 's their business model . 
  here 's how i would decide which new language to learn : - how many people will i be able to speak to - will it be worth speaking to those people - what will i learn from the language ? 
  - how many articles , movies , plays , scientific papers , etc. 
  are published in this language ? 
  arabic ? 
  not even close . 
  i 've lived during sanctions in serbia ... only the usual idiots are happy ... those who need folk music on their old tv , a bit of alcohol and a touch of greasy food . 
  those who yearn for more , they 're in for some hard shit . 
  well , technically , this means they 'll only afford to buy domestic russian products . 
  foreign merchandise , such as cars and electronics will be harder to acquire , but local produce , food and services will still be available . 
  \\* eastern polan, 
  gib clay, 
  1 ) serbia 2 ) very few , usually none . 
  `` danas '' ( `` today '' ) is the least biased , though . 
  b92 is n't a newspaper , but it has reliable news in english regarding serbia . 
  this is a big turn from her former stance on refugees . 
  now the main issue : what will the refugees think of this ? 
  tell any refugee he is here only temporarily and that he will be sent back eventually ... what will his or her reaction be ? 
  `` dorcol-manhattan '' i 've never seen , fortunately , but i 've seen `` hajde da se volimo 3 '' ( let 's love each other 3 ) , which is a yugoslavian movie , and boy oh boy is that a bad movie ... high production values , but everything else is shit . 
  * they * are n't the brightest minds in the bunch . 
  they are nationalistic idiots . 
  they are religious lunatics . 
  they are ass-backwards and closed-minded . 
  and what are you supposed to do in response ? 
  become religious lunatics yourselves ? 
  just because they 're fucking nuts does n't mean israel gets to follow their footsteps and act cool about it . 
  building further settlements in palestine does not constitute `` defending from terrorists '' . 
  jesus fucking christ ... while the jewish people have been wronged many times in history , that does not give israel the right to continue fucking shit up with palestine . 
  it is legitimate advice , but the last time i 've seen posters like this in serbia were in old buildings - they were cold war posters , instructing what public sirens sound like and what to do when you hear them ( air raid , fire , nuclear , etc. ) . 
  hence , i feel a bit creeped out by posters like this . 
  more clear version : http://www.gouvernement.fr/reagir-attaque-terroriste, 
  `` hurr durr , i 'm a fucking eugenicist idiot !, 
  please pee on my face ! '', 
  - our president, 
   albania is set to join in a few years hah . 
  the same goes for serbia and macedonia . 
  we 're all way , way back . 
  what makes you think greece wo n't ask for frontex to intervene in larger numbers ? 
  they 're currently letting everyone in , and are naysaing on eu assistance for border controls . 
  in hungary it 's also a jailable offense to breach the wire fence on the border . 
  immediate punishment + deportation back to serbia/croatia/romania is what i think it 's the best cause . 
  then if croatia , serbia and romania start deporting them back to bulgaria , macedonia , etc. , then greece , bulgaria will follow . 
  hungary did fine with their method , i 'm surprised to say . 
  i do n't know for sure ... during the bosnian war , my close relatives fled for european countries , but due to the fact that they knew only english well enough , they applied for asylum in canada and got it . 
  they did so while they worked simple labor jobs in germany : mostly cleaning , packing , etc. 
  also , canada took in it 's piece of syrian refugees , and i 'm sure these people never saw canadian soil in their life . 
  i 'm not really asking them to fight isis themselves , i was more referring to us and our fight with isis . 
  it 's a more interventionist policy , but the alternative is to have tons of refugees on various borders around the world , and plenty of terrorist attacks . 
  enforce current border laws . 
  but i guess that 's too much to ask . 
  first of all , retract all of merkel 's welcoming calls towards migrants . 
  the new message should be `` stay in your camps . 
  apply for asylum there . 
  any and all who make it across the border illegally will be deported back . 
  only those from affected areas have a chance of being granted asylum . 
  economic migrants should apply for permanent residency through already established proper channels . '' . 
  make sure there 's a lottery in place which will place asylum seekers in all eu countries . 
  you do n't get to go to germany or sweden or the uk because the money 's good . 
  you 're running from death and persecution , are you not ?
