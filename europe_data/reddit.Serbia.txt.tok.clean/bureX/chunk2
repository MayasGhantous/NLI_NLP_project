  i believe both sides agreed not to have any away fans present , due to security concerns . 
   no albanians on this game bud check your stats . 
  chances are drone was flown from outside the stadium , setting it up and running it inside would be seen . 
  there was a vip lounge specifically for the albanian delegation , and there were shoutouts from various albanian `` fan '' groups who said they 'll be in belgrade today . 
  whether the latter group made it or not is unclear , but if the whole thing was set up from outside the stadium , i believe that constitutes as an even bigger dick-move . 
  disrupting the game * from outside * ? 
  damn , that 's a new one for me !, 
   ivan bogdanov ahhh there he is again ... 
  i swear , that idiot 's everywhere . 
  he 's gon na pop out of my toilet one day with his trademarked hooligan mask . 
  how the hell does he squeeze in on every single event like this is beyond me . 
  putting more numbers in does not make your point more valid . 
  there were * some * albanian fans on the game , otherwise who flew the damn drone ? 
  there was also a vip lounge present for the albanian delegation . 
  serbian fans did throw crap , and this is well known , and in no way did i or anybody else condone such behavior . 
  a few `` fans '' obviously found a hole to squeeze in away from the security when the drone incident occurred , i 'm not even a little bit surprised . 
  and i 'm gon na need a citation for no9 , although i would n't be surprised with that one either . 
  as for no . 
  11 , it 's still unconfirmed news . 
  will see how things develop . 
  i would rather have olsi rama not have anything to do with this , since the albanian pm is visiting serbia soon and nobody needs these diplomatic incidents . 
   he just thought the serbian player was going to rip the flag apart ( judging by the motion of his hands - he roughed it up ) who gives a flying fuck ? 
  it 's a flag that directly takes a dump on the sovereignty of all of albania 's neighboring countries - montenegro , serbia , macedonia and greece !, 
  it 's a disgrace to albania itself !, 
  it 's flying around on a remote controlled device !, 
  it has no place being there and deserves no respect whatsoever !, 
  like i said ... the fans i could n't care less about . 
  they 're pond scum with tickets for a football match . 
  it 's the behavior of the players i 'm worried about . 
   ( do n't upvote me too fast , serbians . 
  i still think he was a handsome serbian man as well ...  ) . 
  we are a nation of people who kiss each other 3 times in the cheek as part of a formal traditional greeting . 
  so ... um ... hello . 
  i think we misunderstood . 
  the * fans * are dicks . 
  serbian players behaved very well , * surprisingly well * , in fact . 
  had no issues with the albanian players either ( other than the obvious stalling ) until the drone incident . 
  citing myself :  the fans on both sides were atrocious ( as usual ) the fans are always dicks ( mostly the serbs , since there were next-to-none albanian fans in the crowd ) , and i was n't expecting anything better from them . 
  i still do n't know which came first , the stuff on the field or the drone , but it matters little - as soon as they started throwing their smuggled pyrotechnics on the field , serbian players rushed to calm things down . 
  the fans are not technically representing their country , the players are . 
  i expected the fans behaving like dicks , and the same will happen in albania as well , it 's the players i 'm worried about . 
  like i said , the players are supposed to be better than this . 
   ~ 800 $ http://i.imgur.com/fm4lcvq.gif ... rest assured , we 'll be finding an adequate replacement for payback !, 
  we will strike swiftly . 
  beware : http://www.dx.com/p/2-ch-remote-controll-helicopter-blue-299058, 
  a drone was flying over carrying not a state flag , but a stupid provocation ( not to mention the dangers of flying such a thing over a stadium ) ... one serbian player tries to take it down , and the albanian players intervene violently . 
  what . 
  the . 
  the fans on both sides were atrocious ( as usual ) , but i 'm very surprised and disappointed at the albanian players and their reaction . 
  if * that 's * the flag you 're willing to defend , if that 's the kind of behavior you condone , then there should n't be any room for you in any sports tournament or other event . 
  stay the fuck home and jerk off to your petty nationalist shite alone . 
  you 're supposed to be better than this : http://i.imgur.com/0f2k0lf.jpg http://i.imgur.com/rlqpywl.jpg ** edit : ** unconfirmed news : olsi rama , who is the brother of albania 's pm , has been arrested in the vip booth on the stadium , for ( allegedly ) organizing this drone incident . 
  he has presented the serbian authorities his us passport . 
  http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=14&amp;nav_category=16&amp;nav_id=911679 ( in serbian ) this is getting ridiculous . 
  ** edit2 : ** olsi rama apparently * was * arrested , but after some interrogation was let go , along with 4 other albanian spectators ( with us passports ) . 
  this is supposed to be a statement made by the albanian embassy in belgrade . 
  they were suspected of having ties with the drone . 
  ( oh god this sounds so cyberpunk ) the football association of serbia claims that an agreement to proceed with the match has been made with uefa , but the albanian side backed away and refused to play due to the surrounding atmosphere . 
  uefa has no additional statements to make , says they will do a thorough investigation . 
  ** edit3 : ** aftermath : the us embassy has denied that it had anything to do with this ( alluding to the albanian us passport holders on the game ) , and that they were disappointed about the game being interrupted . 
  mr. wilhelm , germany 's ambassador to serbia , said he did n't watch the game , but that he hopes that both sides show restraint and that albanian pm 's visit to belgrade goes through as planned . 
  catherine ashton ( * high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy * ) said the eu is disappointed with this political provocation , that the serbian government has acted professionally , and has emphasized the value of the forthcoming albanian pm 's visit to serbia . 
  pristina 's mayor - shpend ahmeni , has sent a message to albania 's pm , stating once again that he should n't go to belgrade . 
  shots fired from automatic weapons in the southern/albanian part of mitrovica in kosovo , along with usual chants and post-game noise . 
  in the town of presevo ( in serbia ) , a group of 100 albanian hooligans proceeded to harass a few remaining serb families in their homes . 
  seeking logic in crowd chants ... there 's your problem . 
  if it barely rhymes , it 's good enough for them . 
  the southern parts . 
  and yes , that includes kosovo . 
  but he 's completely right . 
   jovic said the vote was not liberal because there `` was not enough freedom so that everyone , without justifiable fear of drastic consequences , could express exactly what he/she thought '' . 
  try being openly against independence in that time ... not a smart thing to do . 
  nationalistic tensions were really , really high . 
  likewise , try being for an independent croatia in serb controlled territories at the time , and count the seconds it takes for you to get bricked in the head . 
  the referendum was , however , the best that croatia could do at the time . 
  do n't romanticize it . 
  tl ; dr : just another knee-jerk reaction in the balkans , nothing to see here ... 
  not even close . 
  you do * not * speak about religion here , it 's considered to be bad etiquette . 
  i dare anyone to form a prayer circle at the start of a work day . 
  i 'll try : your spineless `` we do n't want any trouble '' country is based solely on stolen jewish wealth from ww2 . 
  and your watches are replaceable with more accurate 2 $ quartz watches . 
  no we 're not fuck you !!, 
  yeah , agreed . 
  to properly piss off a croatian , you call them a `` catholicized serb '' . 
  something for everyone !, 
  i personally dig `` new colorado '' . 
  what the holy fuck ... 
   why do you want to join so hard ? 
  honestly , because we need eu protection from our politicians . 
  our politicians have full control over what 's going on and can screw around with laws as they see fit . 
  they can skip over stuff they do n't like , they can ignore stuff they do n't like , and they have the border to protect us from fleeing so easily elsewhere . 
  not so under the eu . 
  if in the eu , they ca n't make shitty laws willy-nilly . 
  they also do n't have the border to box us in . 
  if they fuck up , they know we can leave at any time . 
   we can no longer forbid rich foreigners to buy up agricultural land . 
  under current vucic leadership , we 're selling our valuable agricultural land to the arabs . 
  we 're still screwed either way . 
   we can no longer make laws that treat local businesses preferentially .
