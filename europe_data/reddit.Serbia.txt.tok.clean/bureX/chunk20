  it all depends on the country ... there may be a point system in place , or whatever . 
  fund refugee camps across the globe , and create a system where refugees can apply for permanent residency from there . 
  have a good education ? 
  have family already in the eu ? 
  have a vouching letter ? 
  have some language ability ? 
  have work experience ? 
  good !, 
  you 're at the top of the list !, 
  this is how it works for most immigrants today . 
  why are these people getting left out of this system is beyond me . 
  i know plenty of refugees from bosnia who had to jump through hoops to get permanent residency , and they could n't just jump borders and get a warm welcome , and they 're european , for fuck 's sake . 
  yugoslavia has been in a state of war for at least 10 years , serbia has been bombed for months in 1999 , croatia is still a minefield . 
  how many terrorist attacks have been executed by a serb or a croat ? 
  * sigh * alright fine damn cute children and their sneaky ways ... 
  and the us got pretty pissed about that . 
  so , yeah , you 've got a mini cold-war going on , and it 's not fun at all . 
   m\u00e4mmi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s-8gf9gfjo&amp;t=42s, 
   shitty interior ...  brand new pvc windows at least you 're energy efficient . 
  point being ? 
  i know plenty of serbs hate the eu because of it 's various demands , and have declared it a `` failed attempt '' , and yet , thousands and thousands flee to said eu to seek a better future . 
  in serbia , at least , we can tell the president to fuck off any time . 
  turkey is ranked # 149 on the press freedom index ( 149 out of 180 ) , serbia is # 67 . 
  sour grapes . 
  ... you 're living in a country which forbids insulting the president . 
  start with that , for your sake .

   viva oh god , i 've watched so many shitty german music videos on this channel ... 
   those who do n't find jobs seek asylum and hope to stay by living off social benefits from the german government . 
  the great majority of them , up to 90 percent , belong to the roma ethnic group who are subjected to systemic and institutional discrimination , not to mention poverty . 
  yup , this is in line with what i 've heard . 
  most work low-level jobs for cash under the table without a work permit , living collectively in rented apartments , keeping a low profile . 
  roma either live off welfare ( how the hell do they manage to get it , i have no idea ) and possibly resell old stuff . 
  in poorer locations in serbia , you can find tons of old-as-fuck laptops , washing machines , ovens , furniture , etc. 
  being sold . 
  my god , butthurt is in the air ... 
  here 's a different version , with a soundtrack : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3egpc62kuc, 
   and i do n't even think it was allowed back then to wear them . 
  it was . 
  grandmas usually wore them , very few others . 
  it was n't prohibited , not by a long shot . 
  it 's just that the youth did n't really care about religious burdens and listened to rock music instead . 
  my cousin came to visit his home town in bosnia from canada ... was kinda shocked to see all the hijabs on young people . 
   what the hell are you even saying ? 
  what 's the problem with it ? 
  they choose to wear it . 
  i 'm not very much concerned with what they choose to wear ... ** i 'm more concerned with what happens when they choose not to . 
   it 's not an excuse to leave these people in a war zone . 
  i 'm gon na be that bastard and say that even if they did n't come from a war zone , ** they deserve to be sent to one ** . 
  my family ran from the pits of hell when bosnia was burning over and they would be grateful for a cardboard box under a tree if it meant being away from bullets and shelling . 
  these people are not the people anyone wants in any country . 
  so can i. 
  but i ca n't get benefits and free housing . 
  they should n't either . 
  ask your parents what the popularity of hijabs was during tito and what 's it like now . 
  in bosnia , there were practically no women wearing it , and now there 's tons . 
  with an appropriate amount of wahhabi sponsored mosques , of course : http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/is-saudi-funded-mosque-in-sarajevo-threat-to-bosnias-moderate-muslims/ keep alert for the saudis , they have tons of money and no brains , a killer combo . 
  we 've done it for millennia . 
  accept the good parts of one 's culture , ignore the rest . 
  the issue is ... other than the occasional food , i 'm having a hard time finding what 's great about these people . 
  they rarely bring anything good to the table . 
  i do n't know if anime was a mistake or not , but holy shit ... 
  what about hijabs ? 
  man , i 've always had access to tv2 , dunatv and m1/2 , and their dubbing always sucked . 
  i knew english , always wanted to watch a movie , and then i hear these idiots trying to `` act '' without any passion ... same goes for germany . 
  not only does hungary suck with english because of this , but most of us in the north of serbia could n't learn hungarian because there were no hungarian subtitles on english shows and movies . 
   furthermore , excavations are still going on as it is believed that that several women 's bodies are buried in a mass grave somewhere around the church . 
  this was news months ago ... they 've found nothing . 
   this particular church was started as a bunker by the serbin army ...  the churches cross was set in place the day the largest catholic massacre happened in kosovo . 
  go back to your kafana , tavern , bar , or whatever and continue this discussion there , i 'm sure it will all be clear after a few beers . 
  we 're talking about ** russia ** . 
  they 'll eat roots and drink toilet vodka if the motherland says so . 
  sanctions against yugoslavia were somewhat effective because it was a small , war-torn country in europe , but russia can be somewhat self-sustainable , and it also has china in the neighborhood for its technology needs . 
  nevertheless , it 's a matter of principle . 
  what kind of message does russia send if they return crimea ? 
  if they do so , they 'll be showing their belly . 
  and what of the crimeans ( who mostly identify as russian ) ? 
  what will become of them if they 're returned to ukraine ? 
  it 's not just yt comments ... a local activist in crimea was arrested and the prosecutor had this to say :  crimean prosecutor natalia poklonskaya announced that they were judging `` not just kostenko , but the very idea of ** fascism and nazism ** , which are trying to raise their head once again . 
  an old veteran who was against russian meddling in crimea was arrested :  in early march , igor andreyev , a 75-year-old survivor of the siege of leningrad , attended an anti-war rally against the russian intervention in crimea and was holding a sign that read `` peace to the world '' . 
  the riot police arrested him and ** a local pro-government lawyer then accused him of being a supporter of `` fascism '' ** . 
  the retiree , who lived on a 6,500-ruble monthly pension , was fined 10,000 rubles . 
  ... hell , just google `` ukrainian fascists '' in russian and see for yourself what most news outlets think : [ click ] ( https://www.google.rs/search?q=%d1%83%d0%ba%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b8%d0%bd%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%b5+%d1%84%d0%b0%d1%88%d0%b8%d1%81%d1%82%d1%8b&amp;oq=%d0%a3%d0%ba%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b8%d0%bd%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%b5+%d1%84%d0%b0%d1%88%d0%b8%d1%81%d1%82%d1%8b&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0l6.246j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8 ) in the eyes of the russian people , ukrainians are dangerous fascists who are trying to eradicate russians from ukraine . 
  ... and regarding the kosovo comparison : `` russian president vladimir putin made a comparison between crimea and kosovo in a phone call with us president barack obama '' http://cnsnews.com/news/article/patrick-goodenough/crimea-vote-putin-cites-kosovo-precedent, 
  try browsing some russian websites or reading a few yt comments and see what their opinions are . 
  not saying they 're right , i 'm just saying that they feel their actions in crimea were completely justified and that the us , eu and nato are out to get russia . 
  try watching vice 's dispatches from ukraine . 
  the russians actually call the ukrainans fascists !, 
  the independence of crimea is a liberation for them . 
  crimeans really believe russia saved them from the ukrainian fascists . 
  and yes , russia does use kosovo as an example of why crimea should be able to decide its own faith . 
  this is the part where i would post an rt [ dot ] com link , but the automoderator deletes any posts containing rt links . 
  jesus fucking christ , / r/europe ... 
   crimea and donbas were not driven by stopping a genocide underway . 
  subjective . 
  ask any russian , and there would be a claim that the ukrainians were pacifying the russian populace and denying them their right to be in their homeland . 
  croatian from serbia , with family in croatia and bosnia . 
  croats were killed by the usta\u0161e ( for non compliance ) and germans in ww2 , maybe even by the partisans sometimes . 
  tons of my family in bosnia got lost in ww2 . 
  moving on to the 90s , family members in bosnia got shot at by serb snipers , while another family member from serbia got drafted and sent to bosnia where he got shot by the bosniaks .
