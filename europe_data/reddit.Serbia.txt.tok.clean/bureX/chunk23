  otherwise , improve your police and rule of law first , also the economy . 
  unless you just want to do a rename and dick around with different terminologies of your armed forces . 
   vetevendosje , an upstart opposition party is polling at 29-32 % currently so ... 
  i 'm guessing there will be no visa-free travel for kosovo in the near future :\\, 
  oh hey , an acquaintance lived in [ b\u00e9la bart\u00f3k ] ( https://www.google.rs/maps/place/bele+bartoka,+subotica/@46.1091409,19.6909064,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4743614e490ed9e5:0xa19336a9f34f9cf7!8m2!3d46.1091372!4d19.6930951?hl=en ) street near me ... never really thought about who he was , doing some reading now . 
  \\* * clears throat * \\*, 
   it has never been legally proven that genocide or ethnic cleansing was committed by albanians in kosovo there 's a misunderstanding here ... 
  i will not wait for some 3rd party court to decide whether genocide was committed or not in order to point the finger at serious atrocities and acts of ethnic cleansing or intimidation . 
  let 's not act like srebrenica was the sole atrocity which came out of the bosnian wars - this is disrespectful even to those bosniaks who died outside of srebrenica . 
   yet a majority of serbs , according to opinion polls in rs , support mladic and others continue to discriminate against returnees . 
  they support mladic because most of them think he 's innocent and that he 's a protector of the serbs ... not because he murdered people . 
  big difference . 
  still , most are bitter at their neighbor bosniaks which is why , like i said , i would n't support independence until their way of thinking changes from `` i do n't want to live with these dirty bosniaks '' to `` i think we can do better on our own because x and y , let 's shake hands and see where our separate ways take us '' . 
  only a division in peace and understanding can work , which would mean the rs from the 90s is no more . 
   but rs has ( had ) a significant portion of bosniaks . 
  foca , bratunac , srebrenica , these areas have never been historically serb ( ian ) . 
  again , `` cough kosovo '' . 
  there are many regions in kosovo which have been serbian for ages , does n't mean they 're serbian now . 
   i do n't think so . 
  independence would show that their crimes in the war paid off . 
  so , what do you suggest ? 
  let them live against their will in a dysfunctional country , constantly fighting , bickering and including 3rd parties to calm things down ? 
  either bosnia will enter the eu in the near future , which will annul any borders currently present , or tensions will continue to rise because both sides still refuse to budge . 
   this sets a dangerous precedent that you can achieve self-determination or territorial expansion by killing everyone of another ethnic group in a certain area . 
  \\* *** cough *** \\* kosovo \\* *** cough *** \\* genocide was committed by a certain group of people , led by few . 
  it 's like saying croatia does n't deserve to have it 's own country because of ndh . 
  if serbs in rs find that their cultural values , their politics and their overall direction in life is not compatible with the rest of bosnia , i fully support their departure from the federation . 
  however , their extremism , their stubbornness and their politics are absolutely the same as the rest of bosnia , the only difference is religion and their flag . 
  this is why i can only dismiss the politics of rs as typical nationalistic bullshit . 
  like i said , if rs were to be mature about all of this and show that indeed the rest of bosnia is dragging them down , western and eastern countries would easily support their independence . 
  but since that 's not the case , they 're all stuck together and are going to stay that way until the signatories of the dayton accords say otherwise . 
  i do n't agree ... 
  the yugoslavian education system has bombarded every young mind with anti-fascist ideologies . 
  everyone knew of nazi atrocities , concentration camps , mass executions , the works . 
  everyone grew up with an idea of self-reliance , brotherhood and unity and non interventionism ( especially not taking sides in the cold war ) . 
  and what happens 40-50 years later ? 
  a fucking civil war , ethnic cleansing and genocide . 
  all it takes is to label someone an enemy . 
  all croats were the ustashe , all serbs were the chetniks , and all muslims were dirty turks/arabs which had to be removed . 
  one ` good ' reason why genocides are denied these days is ... reparations !, 
  genocide did n't happen ? 
  no money for you . 
   refuses to explicitly refer to the events in srebrenica as a genocide . 
  that 's typical political speak , they know what they 're doing . 
  if they do refer to it directly , like i said , they 'll be in a world of shit with people who have lost their friends , family or homes in the past wars ... and those people can vote . 
  a person who has lost someone in bosnia gets to hear their state representative apologizing to *** them *** , and then they obviously want to know `` what about *** me *** ? '' . 
  same goes for other entities or countries in the balkans . 
  tl ; dr : very few can apologize for anything because there 's tons of `` but what about '' questions coming their way . 
  republika srpska is a whole different story . 
  if there 's anything that separate bosnian entities have proven in the previous two decades is that they 're not capable of self-governing . 
  they need serbia , croatia and the eu to wipe their asses and calm them down . 
  i would be all-in for an independent republika srpska if they would come to terms with srebrenica , toned down nationalism and accepted all their citizens as proper citizens , regardless of their religion , as well as provided a proper reason why they ca n't remain in a unified bosnia . 
  but as that 's not happening any time soon , i 'm not going to tolerate a \u0160e\u0161elj-like country . 
  dodik is already pissed as he 's not getting proper support from belgrade , so he established ties with moscow , which is just fantastic as moscow could n't care less about him nor his political entities, 
  i do n't deny a genocide has occurred , but i really do n't care what you call it ... people were killed en masse . 
  the serbian government has referenced an icty ruling which called srebrenica a genocide , and that is pretty much the end of that story in my book . 
  the reason why many governments are hesitant to offer apologies is because many of their voters were also victims in these wars , and they feel defeated when their own government is doing more to appease somebody else other than them . 
  decidedly pro-russian parties such as srs ( the serbian radical party ) and `` dveri '' got 22 and 13 seats , respectfully . 
  so ... 35 seats , out of 250 . 
  but 35 people can yell pretty loud , so there 's that . 
   serbian alternative facts guess you 've already made up your mind and there 's no point in talking to you . 
  all the best . 
   how their government denies that genocide took place http://edition.cnn.com/2010/world/europe/03/31/serbia.srebrenica/, 
  our politics are not retarded , but merely * special * in their own way . 
  okay , so ... yes , retarded . 
  more like on an eternal seesaw between the east and the west . 
  russia has un veto power , which is why good relations are kept and maintained . 
  1999 . was a shitstorm , for sure , but the real standstill came after plenty of western countries recognized kosovo . 
  nothing has ever been the same since then ... trust in the eu plummeted , and guess who stepped in as a knight in shining armor ? 
   serbian politicians actually said this : what a weird statement . 
  i mean ... `` serbian politicians '' ? 
  there are thousands of them . 
  which one ? 
  welcome to bosnia ... where even if you work , you work off the books . 
  god is a serb , and so are you now . 
  enjoy the company of these wonderful people : http://i.imgur.com/06ch7v1.jpg, 
  i ca n't get that stupid song out of my head now , thx . 
   you guys are all speaking the same language and share a cultural heritage this is exactly why we hate each other . 
  period . 
  i keep saying this and people refuse to listen and instead opt in for conspiracy theories and religious differences . 
  waltz down to a village in thailand ... you can barely say `` hello '' because you understand the language or the culture so little . 
  you 're not going to get into any fights over anything . 
  most likely you 'll drink some local hooch , chow down on some local food and oogle the ladies . 
  now take yugoslavia , for example : `` oh no , we do n't speak the same language !, 
  there 's serbian , croatian , bosnian , montenegrin , * bosniak * ... all different ! '' . 
  the someone shouts `` jebem ti mater '' and all hell breaks loose because they understand each other fucking perfectly . 
  take a look at various youtube comments ... the glory that is the butthurt which emanates from such an online cesspool is enough to stump any sociologist . 
  they act the same , they look the same , they speak basically the same language , they drink the same drinks , they eat the same food , and yet they want to grab each other 's throats . 
  it would be hilarious to look at if not for so many victims of this bullshit . 
  as a poor bloke from the balkans ... looking at northern ireland from this perspective is giving me the shivers . 
   not including vojvodina/vajdasag [ dissapointed . 
   kosovo  serbia sorry , but we do n't have a spine . 
  maybe [ kesi\u0107 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1mipi1lgao&amp;t=22s ) makes something , it 's possible . 
  but kosovo ? 
  i really , really doubt it . 
  their pm has ditched any speck of hillary support he had and is already inviting trump over to ~ ~ suck his orange cock ~ ~ visit . 
   liberalism , multiculturalism and globalisation has failed i 'd say globalization has succeeded pretty well . 
  if there 's one thing that people like trump will try to do , is to convince you they 're anti-globalist while enjoying said globalism themselves . 
   and you say it is all bullshit ? 
  hell no , that 's all true .
