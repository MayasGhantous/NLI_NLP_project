  they 're idiots and political opportunists . 
  but do n't you dare even imply that serbia is the only cause of media bullshit and war cries in the balkans . 
  even so , in no way , shape or form is anyone buying this crap , not even the kosovo serbs : http://rs.n1info.com/a222135/vesti/vesti/srbi-sa-kosova-o-vozu.html president nikolic 's ratings are dropping faster than my deuce after 3 plates of spicy goulash , so i suggest you keep an eye on what will happen when the elections come along . 
  he 's buried so deep , he 's trying to grasp on to some ultranationalist votes . 
  there 's no one preparing for war here , we 're mostly preparing for an economic shitstorm . 
  when the solar system sends their people , they 're not sending their best !!, 
  at the time of ascension ? 
  yeah , it kinda was . 
  but romania and bulgaria were n't plagued by wars and other ghosts of the past , and that counts as well . 
   because serb are just looking for excuse how to preform genocide again on this poor people at this point , you 're just making dumb shit up as you usually do . 
  if milosevic could n't get the yugoslav army to deal with kosovo the way he wanted to and sent in shady paramilitaries instead , i do n't see how you 're gon na get `` serbs to perform genocide '' in 2017 . 
  this is n't the 90s . 
  people are n't getting their information from one state tv channel anymore . 
  yeah , we 're laughing at `` serbia stronk '' and `` remove kebab '' online , but other than some shitty youtube comments , there 's really no way anyone 's willing to go and do any sort of genocide . 
  albanians from kosovo traveled through serbia to try to join the refugees a while ago , and they were completely safe . 
  meanwhile , buses carrying  60yr old serb grandmas travelling to kosovo to tend to their loved one 's graves get regularly stoned by the locals . 
  just google the term `` bus stoned kosovo '' , it 's actually not even funny anymore . 
   nato should have gone into srbia and clense it from this radical serb movement . 
  this is pretty much how a 9 year old thinks things are done . 
  just stop . 
   other country 's on balkans seek peace and do n't propagate hate . 
  i do n't even ... 
  the level of dishonesty you 're displaying here can mean only two things : a ) you 're completely clueless and have n't turned on the tv or read a newspaper/news website in ages b ) you 're pushing an agenda i 'm leaning towards b , there 's no way anyone can be this effed in the head . 
  this is an interesting article which popped up on my google news feed . 
  a bit of context : with feuds going on between serbs and albanians in kosovo for decades , the romani people seem to have drawn the short straw . 
  many serbs have been expelled from kosovo , or have left `` voluntarily '' after 1999 , but very few talk about the romani people/gypsies who sought refuge in serbia , due to being seen as `` serb collaborators '' ... many tried their luck in european countries as well , usually without the proper paperwork . 
  this means that after a decade or so after living in an eu country , some roma are deported back to kosovo , and they usually try their best to go back to serbia instead of kosovo , because , well : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24603384 the european roma rights centre has pointed this out in 2004 : http://www.errc.org/article/five-years-of-ethnic-cleansing-of-gypsies-from-kosovo/1924 4/5 of roma from kosovo seem to have been expelled . 
  it seems like roma/gypsies/whatever are not welcome in kosovo , and i ca n't say they 're particularly welcome in serbia either , but it seems they 're sure as hell not welcome in the eu as well due to all the deportations . 
  kosovo , serbia , bosnia , etc. 
  have all been labelled as `` safe countries '' , and any romani person is just seen as a kosovo/serbian/bosnian national and is deported back . 
  yes , and i 'm saying it does n't matter if he knows where we all are . 
  he does n't care . 
   kosovo and serbia should be invited at the same time then we 're both fucked . 
  if serbia is dependent on kosovo entering the eu and vice versa ... shit will go down . 
  yeah , and trump 's wife is slovenian . 
   bosnia getting less so by the day , unfortunately . 
  yeah , but no bullets and war ... right ? 
  right ? 
   it 's not legal requirement , no , but disgraceful that a very wealthy country with a long standing budget surplus is not meeting spending guidelines imho , i believe it 's an issue with germany 's ... well ... you know ... * history * ... 
  hey now !, 
  do n't be rude !, 
  sounds like you need some anxiolytic medication ... why do n't you pop by the local doctor to prescribe you some ? 
  that 'll be 600 # , + 40 # for the pills . 
  money . 
  `` are you sick and tired of those lazy bums mooching off the nhs !? 
  you have n't been sick for the past few years , why should * you * pay so much ?!, 
  we need a proper system ! '', 
  basically this : http://i.imgur.com/c78rk9p.gifv they 'll try to turn the `` peasants '' against each other like in the us . 
  people will blame poverty stricken people , the sick and homeless for the poor economy , while the guys on top laugh it out and take the lion 's share . 
  freedom fries, 
  weirdly enough , most of those companies are like ... really , really diverse , and they also have tons of branches and outposts around the world . 
  i drive a ford ... made in germany and designed by ford europe !, 
   no more android which is based on linux . 
  which is open source . 
  i thought trump 's presidency would be entertaining , at least somewhat , but that asshat is really fucking the world up big time . 
  i refuse to believe these people come from a war ravaged country ... they could also acquire croatian citizenship eventually and move wherever the hell they want after that , but i guess that 's a bit too much planning for someone that stupid . 
   izba\u010deni iz eu croatia is in the eu . 
  i have no idea what they are trying to say with this title . 
   one academic told me : `` the home office is hedging its bets because we non-uk [ academics ] are now effectively hostages ... '' . 
  a neuroscientist from the eu at a top uk university reacted with defiance : `` for what is worth , i refuse to apply for a piece of paper [ leave to remain ] that i do n't need and wo n't be valid after brexit -- when current law says i do n't need it . 
  it 's just a certificate . 
  ** they can stick their 85-page form up their arses . 
  ** '' my god ... he 's already turned into a brit !, 
  that 's because english is the new lingua franca . 
  you 're in the eea . 
  the only thing i would be asking in that moment is ... `` how long is that cord ? '', 
  well , it would n't be fine , but at least they would pick * something * ... 
  i have only one name for them : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj6wimylz7i, 
   `` we have had many cases ... of even carcinogenic [ substances in them ] . 
  for that reason , because of the hostility [ to these products ] and due to the damages they caused us , we have definitively decided to say ` no ' to them , '' bytyqi said , appealing to citizens to join the boycott . 
  what the fuck is wrong with this guy ? 
  yeah , sure , be a nationalistic prick , who gives a shit ... but calling them * carcinogenic * ? 
  yes , i 'm sure there are special production lines injecting our junk food with cesium-137 before they 're sent to kosovo . 
  oh , and here 's that prick \u0160e\u0161elj eating croatian chocolates : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i8mrddrcsm even he does n't give a fuck . 
  you should have seen yugoslavia during communism . 
  guaranteed seats for women in worker 's meetings , [ 8th of march ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_women's_day ) , reproduction and contraception/family planning rights , right to vote ( obviously , since the king did n't think it was important ) , employment opportunities , etc. 
  imagine a picture of an oldsmobile parked in the driveway ... coming out of it is a suited man , off from work . 
  his v8 gas guzzler death machine turns silent . 
  from the depths of a white ( almost too white ) house comes out a barbiturate-junky stay at home wife with a fake smile , with kids on the side , of course ... well , we had none of that . 
  at least here , we made women into actual equals . 
  communism shat in many people 's faces , but at least it did women 's rights right . 
  which is why i 'm disappointed to see former communist states fall so low in this chart . 
  it all depends on what 's the situation like . 
  nobody currently knows what 's going to happen , and this is why i 'm hating this whole ordeal . 
  leave the eu but stay in the eea , hang around or something ? 
  fine . 
  leave the eu , kick all eu citizens out , close off borders ? 
  fine . 
  but fucking pick something . 
  and yet they have things like `` social services '' , and yet their boomers who vote against health care reform use medicare . 
  `` vote remain or vote leave ? '', 
  `` i dunno ... what 's the difference ? '', 
  `` no idea , but you have to pick one and it 's very important and you 'll have to live with it for the next 20-50 years or so . '', 
  maybe things would have gone a bit smoother if someone actually had a plan for both scenarios . 
  i 'm guessing youtube would remove this quicker than you could say paradi\u017enik . 
  they both use `` shite '' , so they 're 100 % the same . 
   2/3rds of montenegro already lives in ~ ~ the eu ~ ~ belgrade anyhow  fixed . 
  you run away after you sober up , not while drunk . 
  source : liquid courage tastes nice . 
  wait ... were n't they liberated by serbia of the ottomans ?
