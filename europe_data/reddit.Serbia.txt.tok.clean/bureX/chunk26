  the candidates who are facing sns at this time are : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sa%c5%a1a_jankovi%c4%87 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vuk_jeremi%c4%87 more are yet to come . 
  hold that thought , mr. \u0160e\u0161elj . 
  would you like me to uproot your ass from your home , job , friends , connections , etc. 
  and move you elsewhere based on your nationality ? 
  this is n't the 18th century . 
  yes . 
  and it has more active personnel than slovenia , croatia and bosnia combined . 
  the airforce is better than any other in ex-yu . 
  this is not especially scary nor superb ( objectively , it 's shit ) , but this is : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country the amount of arms people have `` borrowed '' from the military during the 90s is astounding . 
  although the stats do n't show it , bosnia is filled with people who have some weaponry buried in their backyard . 
  do n't fucking say shit like that ... `` oh no you wo n't `` s were all over the place in the 90s , and then look what happened . 
  balkan stubbornness and `` pride '' is something that ca n't be easily dealt with . 
   serbia is a russian puppet not really . 
  that 's just nikolic being a stooge . 
  he 's constantly being all pro-russian with stupid chants ... `` i 'll do it , i 'll do it , just watch me ! '' . 
  meanwhile , most of serbia 's diaspora is in the west , most of our trade is with the eu , most of our culture is connected to the west . 
  serbia ca n't export a few tons of apples to russia without getting them back because they apparently were n't up to snuff . 
  what do you think most of serbia feels about * the train * ? 
  olsi rama ( brother of albanian pm edi rama ) got arrested immediately after the game , but was later let go by the police for lack of evidence . 
  http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/10619402/albanian-pms-brother-arrested-over-drone http://www.espnfc.com/european-championship-qualifying/story/2089164/albania-prime-minister-edi-ramas-brother-olsi-arrested-after-drone-stunt-sees-serbia-match-abandoned-according-to-report-from-serbian-state-broadcaster the official story to this day is that this person did the deed : ismail morina . 
  he was arrested in albania , because he had an illegally obtained weapon on his person : https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/07/albania-serbia-alleged-drone-pilot-arrested spent 3 months in jail and was released to serve the rest of his sentence under house arrest . 
  so , yeah , i doubt the albanian government had any hand in this . 
  however , edi rama and albanian nationalists gladly took their time to remind serbia that kosovo is indeed independent ( from the wiki article on the match ) , while some stated that a greater albania is indeed coming . 
  whoever orchestrated it , he/she was very good at it . 
  serbian-albanian relations took a nosedive to new lows . 
  this was in late 2008 , though . 
  if us and uk ambassadors support the idea , there may be a chance for proper diplomatic relations . 
  i do n't know what the republic of srpska will do about this , though . 
  boris tadic , former serbian president has suggested something akin to a partitioning deal ... actually , he did n't have the balls to suggest it , he merely hinted at the idea . 
  it was struck down by the eu and the us . 
  chrome : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/herp-derp-for-youtube/ioomnmgjblnnolpdgdhebainmfbipjoh firefox : https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/herp-derp-for-youtube/, 
   if i lost my sanity and for some bizarre reason wanted to go live in serbia for example heeeey :( ^ ^ just ^ ^ kidding , ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ come ^ ^ over , ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ shit, 
  yeah , those roads are what we call `` from the tito days '' . 
  i hope the other roads were n't as dreadful . 
  what uk citizens will be facing from me is most certainly `` deliberate hostility '' if they try to pay me in pounds again . 
  convert that shit to euros , i 'm not gon na get brexited in the ass again on the currency rates like last time . 
  yeah , just be careful with that . 
  if it gets too bureaucratic and expensive , they 'll just pack up and leave . 
   [ eastern roman empire ] ( http://imgur.com/sj6sre2 ) and now it 's a part of serbia 's coat of arms and flag : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:coat_of_arms_of_serbia.svg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:flag_of_serbia.svg, 
  i wish serbia would join the eu at least for a few months so i can actually * see some motherfucking graphs once in a while * . 
  not bad . 
  can you drive one of those in the cities without getting shit for it ? 
  we have our own share of electric bikes here ... mostly used by old folks who get scared shitless when they enter an intersection and just fuck everything up . 
  what i would like is for bike conversion kits to start appearing more over here in these parts : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xttoeep5s7g at least you can use a reliable , good bicycle and drive it on electric power if you want , and they 're cheap , compared to these new electric hipster bikes which cost 3000eur . 
  the fiesta was born and bred in ford europe . 
  it became so popular , it started appearing in the us as well . 
  bosnia does n't steal vws from europe . 
  they all drive tas vw golfs 1s and barebone diesel golf 2s . 
  i hate to admit it , and while i 'm not fond of some of their shitty design choices ( like not being able to replace your own bulbs ) , the new renaults look space age . 
  the captur , clio are really nice . 
   8 year warranty okay , what 's the catch ? 
   can any serbs here tell me if that makes the car comparably cheaper than other cars ? 
  you could trade in your old shitbucket for a discount , and there were special financing options . 
  otherwise , you wo n't be seeing many new cars on serbia 's streets , especially the 500l . 
  what you will be seeing : fiat punto  2000 - cheap as fuck , no thrills ( other than that weird city mode button ) tons of available parts , some do n't even come with a/c ford focus  2000 - mostly the station-wagon/caravan versions opel astra g  1999 - `` look mom , i 'm driving a sedan !, 
  '' , also called `` propel '' because the bodywork is shit opel corsa c  2000 - small as fuck , no features , but it works . 
  yugo 45 or zastava 101  1980s - mostly in the backwoods because they 're unsuitable for driving in the city ( a regular police stop would get you off the road because the cars are in such bad shape , usually ) mercedes a class w168  1998 - `` look , it 's a mercedes !, 
  no , really ! '', 
  alfa romeo 147  2000 - because sometimes you want a small family car and still think you 've got a racing machine ... after you 've spent a fortune replacing the weird twinspark sparkplugs . 
  newer ford fiestas for some reason are really popular as delivery cars for small companies . 
  you 'll also find vw golfs and passats , renault meganes , a few clios and old scenics . 
  `` trying to be rich '' folks go with an audi a4 , usually . 
  well , you * can * kinda survive without a car in denmark . 
  what about electric powered cars ? 
  also , have you `` regulated '' electric powered bicycles yet ? 
  nigga i own the 2003 model , it 's tight . 
  1.3 l of chain driven madness . 
  yeah , back to the 60s !, 
  borders !, 
  customs !, 
  every country with a different standard !, 
  import/trade nightmares !, 
  isolation !, 
  well , to be fair , if trump keeps licking putin 's balls the way he is now , i 'm sure people in the eu will just * love * breaking away . 
  yeah , and my problem is when a person named `` vojnik_ndh '' gets upvoted . 
  check out hrulj 's post history ... holy crap . 
  they all should get downvoted to hell . 
  but apparently * some * nationalistic bullshit is acceptable here . 
  i do n't stand for either . 
  in this thread ? 
  guess i have n't been looking hard enough ... to be fair , / r/europe is n't a very friendly place when it comes to balkan politics , and only the bravest of the brave come here to fling poo at each other ... 
  i 'm not surprised threads such as these attract the worst people and bring out the worst in people . 
   european subreddit should be screaming to exterminate albanians bosniaks and croats and give moral if not other support to poor innocent serbs this . 
  nobody has ever said this . 
  nobody has ever implied this . 
  it 's circlejerk material and you know it . 
  they were mostly corporate banks from this list ... https://thebanks.eu/banks-by-country/ireland was seeking business banking info , but most of them are corporate and some are brandishing a brexit banner . 
  ca n't search by image in my history , and some were enclosed inside pdfs , so i 'm kinda useless at this point . 
  click away . 
  they kinda look like this : http://i.imgur.com/b2wqnjo.png ( this one is from a law firm ) anyway , company incorporation agencies are already at it : http://www.irelandcompanyformation.com/blog/2016/08/moving-a-business-from-uk-to-ireland-post-brexit http://parfreymurphy.ie/business-start-ups/free-company-formation/ http://www.philiplee.ie/im-an-entrepreneur-post-brexit-how-can-i-relocate-to-ireland/ however , some uk company incorporation agencies are trying to calm their customers down : https://www.1stformations.co.uk/blog/impact-brexit-uk-limited-companies/ ... which may be counterproductive if a hard brexit happens .

  bull . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatia%e2%80%93slovenia_border_disputes#eu_blockade_background croatia got blocked from entering the eu , and there were plenty of tensions ( i remember watching the news during those days , it really was a shitshow ) . 
  fortunately , you 're more civilized than our bunch , so there was no threat of larger conflicts , but as far as the balkan kindergarten games go , you were a part of them , oh yes . 
   decree no . 
  680 stipulates that individuals who are under investigation from one of eight different articles of the turkish penal code could be stripped of their citizenship if they fail to return to turkey in 90 days okay , so ... \u2714 talk shit about erdogan : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3czad9gyfy \u2714 get stripped of turkish citizenship \u2714 host country has no way of deporting you as a stateless person , so you have to receive asylum i 'm guessing erdogan is trying to shoo away his critics , but he does n't understand that in the world of internet and video calls , he 'll still be shat on and nothing will change . 
  was seeking some financial info on the websites of irish banks and financial institutions ... plenty of them had `` brexit '' banners on them , calling upon you to move your business to ireland . 
  the plucking has begun .
