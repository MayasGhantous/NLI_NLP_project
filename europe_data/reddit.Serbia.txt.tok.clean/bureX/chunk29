  you 'll be learning how to read or write forever . 
  even native chinese have issues with remembering which symbol says what . 
  there are other languages you should learn first ( english , german , french , spanish ) which contain way more useful information and opportunities for you than mandarin . 
  the industry still does n't demand knowledge of chinese . 
  you ( almost ) ca n't move to china and live there as a citizen . 
  it simply does n't happen because their government is so conservative . 
  even if you manage to do so via marriage , you will never be considered to be chinese . 
  if you wan na learn something new , learn cyrilic . 
  it 's very easy and it 'll take from one afternoon to a few days to do so , then you 'll be able to read this and impress your friends : \u0444\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0435 \u0445\u0430\u0432\u0435 \u043d\u043e \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0435 \u043e\u0444 \u0445\u0443\u043c\u043e\u0440 . 
  i 'm gon na have to say this ... most of the immigrants from serbia are romani families with serbian passports who have been driven out of kosovo by the albanians , and have left serbia due to poverty or persecution . 
  http://www.dw.com/en/roma-discriminated-in-serbia-unwanted-in-germany/a-18639037 http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/germany-remains-promised-land-for-roma-in-serbia-and-macedonia-a-866760.html anecdotally , many romani families in my vicinity have simply vanished . 
  their neighbors state that they 've `` left for germany '' . 
  this does n't mean there are n't many serbian fuckfaces in various european countries , poor or rich : like this lovely lady yelling at her phone in the bus in switzerland , while simultaneously threatening to `` beat up a swiss because he 's botherhing her '' : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4y2adrwgte or this lovely young chap who got a ferrari for his birthday by his father in denmark , and then proceeded to hire a shitty folk singer to sing a song about the ordeal : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hguk8acd1tu, 
  do n't learn mandarin . 
  i wo n't go into details , but you can just google the term and you 'll see why . 
  guess it 's time to post this again : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ckfv39x3s long live erdogan . 
  it did n't ? 
  romania , croatia , serbia ... yada yada ... ? 
  and the austrohungarian occupation of bosnia ? 
  nope , not expansionist at all . 
  100 years ago ? 
  probably , but only due to hungarian ** rule ** and the monarchy , accompanied by the usual lack of freedoms from that time . 
  yes , the country was multicultural , but it was ruled by a minority with expansionist policies . 
  well , it did ... a bit ... until the 90s ... now i 'm buying shitty smuggled magyar pulykamell csemege from my local flea market . 
  use this map : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:magyarorszag_1920.png the kingdom of hungary ... with 48 % hungarians . 
  you can get all the money out as quick as you want , but if hyperinflation hits , like the one in 1993 yugoslavia , you 're just plainly fucked . 
  do n't you have pig trailers : http://i.imgur.com/c91hcb0.jpg ? 
  bro , we have rows of pensioners waiting in line at 6am in front of their favorite bank every 15 days or so to get their money out . 
  the money is there , they can pick it up at 10am , 3pm , tomorrow , or whenever ... they even have tons of atms nearby , but refuse ( or do n't know ) how to use them . 
  i 'm just guessing some of these folks love queuing or are terribly misguided . 
  communism means the absence of money , social classes , and eventually the state . 
  soviet-influenced countries and the ussr itself had money , plenty of social classes and a hardcore state . 
  even so , `` true '' communism probably would n't work that well either . 
  i 'm just saying this because people tend to grab onto the story of the iron curtain , rightfully dismiss communism , and then use `` socialism '' as a dirty word , even though it has many uses in modern civilization . 
  do n't use our plight as an argument for killing off various social services in the west . 
  the laissez faire free market does n't give a shit about your well being , nor the well being of your family , nor the well being of the environment , and it needs a dash of socialism in order to function properly . 
  also , you also have to realize , communism in europe and asia was mostly a hard response to centuries of rule from the wealthy elite , kings and czars . 
  think `` french revolution '' , but on steroids . 
  for a good reason . 
  people will skimp out on the mandatory vet check . 
  over here in serbia , we have vet stations in loads of places , and you 're supposed to cut out a piece of meat near the diaphragm , take it to the vet , pay ... like ... 3-4 eur and wait for 15 minutes for the results , or go home and let the veterinarian send you an sms or call you if everything 's ok . ( it usually is ) if everything is * not * okay , oh , you 'll know . 
  they 'll be coming over . 
  but still , people skimp out on those 3-4eur and a 10 minute drive , so once in a while we rarely get contained trichinellosis outbreaks , but that happens when some fuck-o decides it 's a good idea to let his pigs roam around every-fucking-where and eat every-fucking-thing . 
  that 's pretty much the only thing they have left , for some reason . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/media_freedom_in_serbia  four popular political talk tv programmes were cancelled in 2014 . 
  in october 2014 , b92 cancelled the renowned political talk show by olja be\u0107kovi\u0107 , running since 24 years and well known for its critical scrutiny of all governments since . 
  this came after be\u010dkovi\u0107 had thoroughly interviewed the prime minister aleksandar vu\u010di\u0107 in october 2013 . 
  the anchorwoman recalls having received an angry call from vucic afterwards , and having been boycotted by sns politicians since . 
  ** b92 later decided to shift to entertainment , and announced it would start broadcasting from the same studio as the public broadcaster . 
  ** there was also b92 radio , which featured news and pretty good comedy morning talk shows ( which parodied government actions and poked a bit of fun ) . 
  the talk shows were eventually cancelled . 
  well , not cancelled , but ... `` the new program scheme does n't include them '' . 
  soon after , b92 radio , the legendary opposition radio that started it all , was renamed to play radio and features mostly generic music and nothing else . 
  there are plenty of former b92 journalists now working for n1 . 
  iridium supports data packets , but at really slow speeds ( 2,4 kbps , but they claim it 's up to 10kbps with compression ) . 
  and the call rates are really expensive . 
  there 's also thuraya , with less coverage , they claim they have speeds up to 384kbps . 
  i 'd reply , but you 're getting angry calling me an idiot and whatnot , so ... yeah , we disagree . 
  not offended or anything , just think that further discussion about this would be unproductive . 
   ( latency wise ) yeah , pings are huge , and shit 's expensive : https://www.europasat.com/satellite-broadband-tariffs/germany/ but , elon musk says they may be working on a low-earth-orbit solution which would reduce latencies to 20ms . 
  current satellites used for broadband internet access are in geostationary orbit , which is really far away from earth . 
  ... but they utilize kosovo as a trading card when talking about crimea . 
  not cool . 
  while this is true , the china of today is nothing in comparison to what it was 40 years ago . 
  does n't it eventually even out ? 
  now , i 'm not saying these countries will do invasions and proxy wars like during the cold war , but they will do their best to exert their influence . 
   over 60 % of our state firms were `` privatized '' after milosevic . 
  yes , but what state were they in ? 
  take zastava for example , they were still producing a car from the 70s ... badly !, 
  overloaded with needless employees , constantly being looted by the workers . 
  ei ni\u0161 ... what could they produce ? 
  many factories had extremely talented researchers and experts who have fled the country during the 90s brain drain . 
  many privatizations were botched , but thinking we could get more money for them is wishful thinking . 
  any factory which has been put on halt for 10 whole years in every way possible is going to struggle surviving . 
   it 's bullshit , you really think milosevic could n't assassinate him inside montenegro montenegro had a tradition of housing draft dodgers : http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-07-28/news/9907280172_1_yugoslav-republic-montenegro-serbia he did n't specifically escape serbia , but rather - belgrade . 
  milosevic did n't have the resources to scour the serbian/vojvodinian/montenegrin countryside in search for dissidents . 
   be realistic please , among nations there are no friends , just interests . 
  russians are n't going to care for us , we do n't even care for us . 
  correct . 
  this is why i detest forms of russophilia we currently experience here . 
  they wo n't help us unless we help ourselves . 
   since you mention the french , what did the french do ? 
  did they at least protest the bombing ? 
  they 've never claimed to be our butt-buddies in the first place , so i have n't expected them to intervene . 
  russia , on the other hand , was always giving out messages of friendship and support , but failed to act on them . 
  this is my pet peeve with them ... dnevnik 2 was bragging on about how russian icbms were pointed towards the us in february 1999 , but none of that was true ... they just did n't care . 
   and no people do n't do what vucic says . 
  people do n't care what vucic says . 
  people follow vucic because party connections get them jobs . 
  it 's survival nothing else . 
  tomato , tom * a * to ... 
  he controls them either way . 
  i did n't want to believe it , but the amount of control he has is staggering , and the only field of experience he has was control and censorship during the 90s . 
   no , holding a referendum is not mandatory to join the eu . 
  just one more thing were you are wrong  first of all , do n't be condescending . 
  it was mandatory in croatia recently , by the constitution , and most countries ascending to eu membership did hold a referendum : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/referendums_related_to_the_european_union , which is why i assumed so . 
  eu rules state that the accession treaty is ratified `` by the candidate country and every individual eu country , according to their constitutional rules ( parliamentary vote , referendum , etc. ) '' . 
  i do n't see why serbia should n't do the same . 
   third , diaspora ? 
  they bring in a fuckton of liquid currency here , so shhh , they might hear us :|,
