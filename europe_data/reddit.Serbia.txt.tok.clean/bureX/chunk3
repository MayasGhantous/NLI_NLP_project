  that would be the point of the eu . 
  imagine if you wanted to export your product to e.g. 
  spain , but spain has imposed preferential treatment for their products ... yours simply ca n't make it . 
  what chance do you have ? 
  this is an issue we have in serbia . 
  low quality domestic products make it to the shelves , while quality imports are taxed and burdened to the point where it 's not feasible to buy them anymore . 
  some of our companies are such dicks that you can even buy some of their products cheaper in montenegro , macedonia , the eu or even canada than here at home in serbia !, 
  how about that ? 
  sure , you get much more competition , but you also get a huge eu market to sell your product . 
  if the locals do n't want it , surely somebody else in this huge market will ? 
  there are plenty of drawbacks , but it ca n't be all sunshine and rainbows , unfortunately . 
   overally the country is not becoming any richer or better organized due to it i do n't know how old you are , but if i ask my dad on how hungary loked like before 2000s and even before 1990s , he just laughs . 
  you were pretty much a joke , comparable to a washed out african country . 
  trust me , you 're doing better . 
  today 's news : http://www.rferl.org/content/eu-hahn-serbia-sanctions-russia-accession/26613971.html  serbia needs to carefully consider its refusal to support eu sanctions against russia if belgrade hopes to join the european union . 
   hahn said ** there wo n't be any eu enlargement during his five-year mandate ** if he becomes the eu commissioner responsible for the portfolio . 
  yeah , here 's the thing ... ** you are n't helping either . 
  ** eu spokesmen/spokeswomen are one of the most obtuse people on the planet . 
  instead of talking to serbia directly , they talk behind closed doors with a few select people . 
  but when they do talk to us , we get these little gems called `` you do n't have a chance with the eu any time soon , but make sure you screw your economy even more by imposing sanctions to russia !, 
  y' know , cuz ' we 're friends ! '' . 
  listen , dipshits , we 're confused as fuck here . 
  plenty of eu countries recognize kosovo , but ukraine and russia do not . 
  nobody recognizes crimea as a part of russia except russia . 
  so , on one hand we agree with the eu in recognizing ukraine 's territorial integrity , but we do n't agree with them in any form of recognition for kosovo . 
  on the other side of the coin , we agree with russia on it 's stance on kosovo , but we do n't agree with it 's stance on crimea . 
  it 's confusing as fuck and we 're too small to take any part in this shitfest . 
  please leave us out of it . 
  so , it appears we have hardcore international politics in the speeches of these nutjobs , instead of them telling us about [ relevant chapters which need fixing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_serbia_to_the_european_union ) , they keep quiet . 
  when they do talk about it , they only blurt out a morsel of info or two , and it sounds to us like they 're completely uninterested . 
  please , for the love of all that is holy , tell us what 's wrong directly !, 
  i do n't want to hear encouragement on one day , and let downs on the next . 
  tell us what needs to be fixed !, 
  we need to know what our government is up to and what they 're fucking up . 
  the average citizen is concerned with what 's on that list , not about russia 's bickering with western nations !, 
  serbia has finished with all forms of cooperation with the icty . 
  our press freedom index is 54/180 ( better than hungary , croatia , bosnia , albania , greece , bulgaria , montenegro , macedonia , etc. ) . 
  our homicide rate is 1.2 , on par with portugal , croatia , ireland and poland , better than finland , belgium , romania , greece , slovakia , etc. 
  our diaspora is situated in [ mostly western countries ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/serb_diaspora.png ) . 
  we 're tied with south korea in the world peace index ( 52/162 ) . 
  our corruption perception index is not great , but it 's 3 spots behind italy . 
  our birth rate is not anything special , it 's on par with italy . 
  what i 'm saying is ... we 're not that different nor are we that much of an asshole of europe . 
  we 're also tiny . 
  at 7-8mil people , we 're not exactly a threat nor an influence to anything . 
  serbia is also very pissed that it 's being treated with different standards , since bulgaria and romania joined the eu . 
  it 's the opinion of many that the eu has burned it 's tongue with these two countries , and now we 're getting the rough end of the stick . 
  if there was light at the end of the tunnel , this 78 % rate would dramatically drop . 
  serbia is encircled by the eu . 
  very few are willing to invest here unless they 're heavily subsidized to do so since there is no eu to act as a safety net here . 
  hence - we 're cut off . 
  if there were visible changes in how we live , travel or do business , the youth of serbia would n't get scared into leaving . 
  give us a chance , tell us what 's wrong , or tell us to fuck off . 
  please , no more beating around the bush . 
  oh , and by the way , we 're in southern europe . 
  i would guess he 's trolling you . 
  most prefer austria or germany . 
   coach-warriors couch . 
   serbia is heavily pro-russian and feels `` slavic brotherhood '' with russia . 
  yeaahh ... about that ... some things are really just for show . 
  i 'm not trying to be a dick or anything , but is it that hard to include the non-eu balkan countries and switzerland ? 
  just look how easy it is : http://i.imgur.com/zbk6nxg.png, 
   most of the time , they are full of rich kids whose parents got money in the 90s through some questionable means and now the kids are full of themselves and feel invincible . 
  you just described serbia and it 's private universities . 
  no , i did not . 
  check the usernames again . 
   i hate you i wuv you . 
  william montgomery ( ambassador to serbia ) screwed up quite a bit , remained controversial and had ( or still has ) very murky ties to some murky people . 
  also was involved in fucking around and meddling in internal politics to the point where he dissed the assassination of our pm - zoran djindjic . 
  he managed to do some good business here in the balkans for himself , so there 's that ... oddly enough , he does speak serbian , croatian , etc. , but our current ambassador does not , which brings me to :  all of our ambassadors have to speak the language i do n't believe that to be the case . 
  is it really a requirement ? 
  i have n't noticed , really , since many us ambassadors to serbia barely knew a few words of the local language . 
  notice i said `` diplomats who deal with foreign affairs '' , not specifically `` ambassadors '' . 
   a dick who 's just trying to be `` edgy '' in a community he knows will support him just because he 's putting down the usa nah , i do not partake in any yurop fuck-the-usa circlejerks . 
   romania is an independent and indivisible nation itself . 
  you can not simply have a referendum to secede . 
  psst , hey , bro ... [ wan na build separatism ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo ), 
  but seriously ... many of your diplomats who deal with foreign affairs really need to get out of their bubble and learn a thing or two . 
  agreed . 
  they 're preparing for future eurozone members . 
  also , they need to be ready for serbia when it enters the eu . 
  any added feature has to satisfy every eu member , and that 's pretty hard to do . 
  it could be worse , the us has really ugly money : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hzkimzafpk, 
  ... now it 's a tourist attraction . 
  oh god ... 
   if europe can cope with slavs oh , would you look at that : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavs#mediaviewer/file:slavic_europe.svg, 
  http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/?page=2,9,4452  government of the republic of kosovo considers that the decision is in favour of maintaining international order and ** it is an effort to punish the violation of the sovereignty of an independent state ** , and the aggression of the russian federation against ukraine . 
  err ... 
  i wonder [ which nation 's sovereignty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_kosova ) [ has also been hurt recently ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_kosovo_declaration_of_independence ), 
   which is hillariously ironic . 
  you know what else is hilariously ironic ? 
  you recognizing kosovo when you have your own breakaway state ( s ) . 
  serbia has repeatedly stated that it respects ukraine 's territorial integrity , while crimea has actually cited kosovo as a justification for it 's independence : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_independence_precedent#influence_to_similar_conflicts  solidarity with the serbs against the evil west we 're shooting for eu membership . 
  we 're a eu candidate country . 
  solidarity against the evil west ... ? 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
   with the whole serbs fighting in crimea/donbass on the side of russians thing . 
  we also have serbian nationals illegally fighting in syria , if that makes you feel any better . 
  there are no russian owned assets there .
