   dude , what the hell do you know about eastern serbia ? 
  first of all , what does eastern serbia have to do with any of this ? 
  second , fyi , i 've spent months in eastern serbia , specifically the timok krajina region . 
  calm your tits . 
  they 're not bogeymen to me either , they 're real and they 're scary . 
   i see b92 and what lies they spew on the rest of the balkans , i can ; take them seriously on anything internal to serbia either . 
  in kosovo there 's at least some english speaking blogs and news organizations such as prishtinainsight and kosovo 2.0 . 
  anything similar in serbia ? 
  b92 has become clickbait , as well as blic.rs . 
  http://rs.n1info.com actually has news , as well as danas.rs . 
  for alternative media , we have pe\u0161\u010danik , birn , istinomer ... 
   after 2000 is where most of `` privatisation '' robberies have taken after . 
  during kostunica and djindjic , not during milosevic . 
  i see this argument often , but it 's not something i agree with . 
  milosevic completely destroyed all but a few factories . 
  due to embargoes and wars , for 10 full years our factories did absolutely nothing and were mostly looted and run into the ground . 
  during the privatization efforts , it was actually a miracle that the crap we had was actually sold at a certain price at all . 
  the factory of 29 . 
  november in subotica still has n't been sold at all because it has been plucked clean during the 90s . 
   while serbia was getting bombed in 99 he was safely in montenegro , and what more supported and called publicly for his country to be bombed . 
  i would n't call that being `` safe '' . 
  montenegro was yugoslavia , he was still in the country . 
  he fled because of a series of political assassinations carried out by the milosevic regime . 
  these are the interviews which are being cited by the hard right in serbia : http://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/08/opinion/after-the-war-in-serbia-is-over.html http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13398569.html none of these contains an outright call for the bombing of yugoslavia , but he did state in a separate occasion that the bombing should n't cease until milosevic leaves , because otherwise everything that 's been done so far will be in vain . 
   djinjic was also a conservative party https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_party_ ( serbia ) #re - establishment i see nothing conservative about his party , or the democratic party in general . 
   russophilia existed way before this . 
  why do you think majority expected russia to support us if it did n't exist ? 
  why were there russian volunteers in bosnia , croatia , kosovo ? 
  greek ones ? 
  clearly love between both nations existed way before assassination of djindjic , portraying it like it 's a new thing is so wrong . 
  there was a time where serbia introduced a new constitution . 
  you may have heard of it , it 's called sretenjski ustav : http://i.imgur.com/3j3ewxl.jpg it was pretty liberal for it 's time , based on the french model . 
  it was quickly struck down by the ottoman empire , austria and ** russia ** . 
  russia has had rather large ties with serbia for centuries due to similar religious views , but russia has rarely , truly ever given a fuck about serbia , but at the same time wanted to keep it close in order to have at least some influence in europe . 
  russia just `` protested '' the war . 
  1992 sanctions against yugoslavia ? 
  what did russia do ? 
  oh , right , nada . 
  so , yeah , the love for this mythical mother russia has only come about recently due to milosevic 's influence . 
  traditional support for russia was always there , no doubt about it , but in this magnitude ? 
  no freakin ' way . 
  people in kosovo are actually asking to be * russian * , for pete 's sake !, 
   more to the point you have to realise even if ever we get the go ahead to join eu , without a referendum there will be mass protests . 
  majority here do n't want to join the eu . 
  on reddit you hear a one-sided story , because as you already said reddit is a small and irrelevant community in serbia . 
  on every bigger popular sites , people are against eu . 
  first of all , holding a referendum is mandatory to join the eu , if i remember correctly . 
  second , people do what vucic says they should do . 
  and vucic is currently telling serbia that the eu is good for them . 
  with his coalition government he holds more than 50 % of all seats in parliament , people listen to his bullshit . 
  third , it 's highly hypocritical to be against the eu while at the same time most of our diaspora is in the eu and other western nations . 
  like i said , this is why the eu adores vucic . 
  he keeps things in check , even if he does it in a sinister way . 
  [ it shows , huh ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfwyl-9mzcq ), 
   hope the net contributors are happy funding another poor eastern european nation . 
  it 's called an investment . 
  also , if the eu does n't side with eastern european nations , * guess who else will * ? 
  did you guess ? 
  china ? 
  well ... them and everyone else . 
  as soon as serbia falters in it 's road towards the eu , russia and china are there to lend a hand with a cheesy smile , along with rich nations from the middle east such as uae and the surrounding countries . 
  the controversial belgrade waterfront is being built by an abu dhabi company , for example . 
  bosnia is being eyed by turkey and many other muslim nations . 
  how about that chinese influence in africa , huh ? 
  yeah , close yourselves off from the world , build a new british leyland and take a sip of bovril , the world is gon na sort itself out in the meantime , is n't it ? 
  at least polish politicians , as well as politicians from any eu country ( such as croatia ) get to fear emigration . 
  if you do n't like the situation in poland , you can leave . 
  the croatian region of slavonia is being emptied because people are in search of better living conditions and more work . 
  this means the croatian political establishment needs to do something , otherwise they 'll get fucked in the a. 
  nobody will be around to pay taxes or to endure their bullshit . 
  they 're in a state of panic , and it 's wonderful to watch . 
  now , compare this to serbia , where *** you ca n't leave *** . 
  unless you 're highly educated and very , very much wanted for your skills in some other part of the world , you will stay here and have to watch vucic on the big screen every single day . 
  vucic will say stuff like `` it 's getting better '' , he 'll spout crap about our gdp rising , about our public debt falling , about new relations and new factories ... he 'll bullshit about people not wanting to work at a fast food place for 350-450eur ( which is a damn lie , since such jobs pay 200eur barely after taxes and all that ) . 
  and the people of serbia will just have to either listen or tune out , but they wo n't be able to leave . 
  you can at least die and leave , which is a plus . 
   do you know anything about the new russian military base which is being planned to be build right at the border with kosovo ? 
  is that being discussed in the public ? 
  honestly , i have n't heard of it yet . 
  i know about that one near ni\u0161 , which is supposedly there to aid in humanitarian missions and to curb forest fires ( and has been dubbed `` a spy center '' by many ) . 
  that base is there to `` equalize '' both western and eastern presence in serbia , since serbia is a self-declared `` neutral country '' since the government of vojislav kostunica ( which is a laughable notion considering his love for russia , but still ) . 
  kosovo has bondsteel , serbia has that . 
  ever since the declaration of independence of kosovo , serbia has been leaning towards china and russia . 
  some politicians have been openly stating that they aim for serbia to become a hole in the carpet of the eu because of kosovo . 
  as for this supposed military base near kosovo , i have n't heard of such a thing , nor has there been anything like that on the news here . 
  in fact , i find that notion to be quite unbelievable , since : a ) the russians have left kosovo ages ago , and they did n't give two shits about it until recently b ) residents of north mitrovica ( serbs ) have asked for russian citizenship and russian passports . 
  they 've signed one huge petition ( http://www.worldcrunch.com/world-affairs/blood-brothers-ethnic-serbs-in-kosovo-see-russian-citizenship-as-shield-against-eu ) asking the russian government to allow them to become russian . 
  russia refused to do so and has instead sent some messily amount of aid as a consolation prize ... if they did grant them russian citizenship , this would mean russia would have a new enclave of russians in serbia/kosovo and would be obliged to protect them and look out for their interests . 
  they obviously were n't even close to engaging in a shitshow like that . 
  c ) russia has repeatedly used the independence of kosovo as a justification for the independence of crimea , meaning they do n't give two shits about serbia nor kosovo unless the narrative suits their agenda do you have any sources for this base which is being built ? 
   what do you think will happen with serbia 's political scene if/once the eu destabilizes ? 
  shit will hit the fan . 
  i keep hearing plenty of sour-grapes talk from people in serbia who adore the idea of the eu dissolving , which means they 'll be able to bathe in other people 's misfortune , and plainly shout `` see , we did n't need those eu fascists ! '' ... 
  brexit is just an approval of their way of thinking . 
  `` why should we open eu chapters and do all this work for nothing when the eu is dissolving anyway ? '', 
  - pretty much that . 
  what they do n't know is that serbia exports more goods to romania than it does to russia !, 
  most of our trade is with the eu : http://globaledge.msu.edu/countries/serbia/tradestats if the 2008 . financial crisis fucked us up good all the way from the us , what do you think will happen if the eu collapses or goes into a recession ? 
  furthermore , even though brexit may happen , the uk will most likely stay in the eea or at least have some form of a union with the eu .
