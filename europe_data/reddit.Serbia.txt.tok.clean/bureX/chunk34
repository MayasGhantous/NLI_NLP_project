  we really do n't have that many police officers on the beat . 
  it 's been 3 weeks since i 've last seen actual police on the streets . 
  the only thing you 'll notice are the traffic cops . 
  is n't it election season ? 
  kornischong is the word we use in the balkans to describe those little cucumbers which are usually used for pickleing . 
  stealing is not a culture . 
  almost every religion , every tribe or group , every nation had laws against stealing . 
  when a person `` takes '' a job , he or she still needs to spend money to actually live . 
  taxes , food , clothing , entertainment , lodging , etc. 
  it all goes back to the economy . 
  you ca n't just take a job . 
  un membership is n't really what 's holding you back ... it 's just you . 
  yeah , sorry , i know it 's easier to blame other orgs or serbia for that , but it 's your fault . 
  serbia has been doing this `` only if we ... '' routine for decades , and it 's not working . 
  we need to change , not just a few laws or our list of memberships . 
  around 6.5 eur per mb when you visit any eu country from serbia . 
  10eur per mb if you visit north america . 
  it 's basically highway robbery . 
  uhm ... yes . 
  the serbian sea looks like a nice tourist destination . 
  electrified tractors !, 
  think of the carbon footprint !, 
  https://twitter.com/seawatchcrew https://sea-watch.org/en/ these people ? 
  looks like a german org . 
   in the same year , more than 5.000 refugees and migrants drowned in the mediterranean or are still missing according to the international organisation for migration ( iom ) . 
  ** these people are not victims of a natural disaster , they are dying because of a political decision to let them drown at sea . 
  ** i do n't even ... 
  i also find it disgusting how they 're willing to essentially take these people , promise them a better future and then dump them on the shores of europe like cattle !, 
  `` here , we brought them over , now you do the rest ... '' . 
  yeah , sorry , but semi-functionally literate folks who know not one word of the languages of europe , probably without proper vaccinations , no background history and with little schooling are really gon na fit in here !, 
  and why these people , specifically ? 
  why not north korea , china , russia ? 
  why not any other country or region with many hardships ? 
  why are we evacuating people from morocco and bangladesh !? 
  and where will these people end up ? 
  spain ? 
  portugal , estonia , finland , bulgaria , greece , serbia , croatia ? 
  yeah , i 'm assuming they wo n't be picky , right ? 
  they wo n't insist on going to germany or sweden , right ? 
  and this whole shitstorm will end up like the story of the boy who cried wolf . 
  everyone seems to be coming from a warzone or something , and eventually when a real warzone pops up , we wo n't be willing take anyone in !, 
   i fail to see why so many ukrainians would rush to pay for a biometric passport just so they could go on a holiday in europe when they can hardly afford it . 
  in serbia we too have a shitty wage , but that does n't mean we do n't want to drive around a bit and see the rest of our continent . 
  no , it 's trash . 
  the government does n't have the leverage to negotiate better prices : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsjgoubmo0m see : http://i.imgur.com/uivqgfh.png, 
  northern serbia ... sunday mornings were always filled with the noise of meat tenderizers and then everyone breaded their cuts of pork for sunday lunch just like this . 
  fucking austro-hungarian influence ... it 's not i like you or anything , baka, 
   1 ) immigrants can learn a new job this is n't the 18th century . 
  most of us in europe are/were in the process of educating ourselves for 12 to 16-18 years . 
  we learn different values and different ways of thinking . 
  immigration can happen , but not at this rate . 
  immigration of a moderate amount of people is fine because it gives them the ability to adjust . 
  having thousands upon thousands if immigrants land in europe without any control nor selection process will just create ghettos and division . 
  regarding these `` genocide denial '' laws ... will denying them their freedom of speech give them more media attention ? 
  some old fart getting together with 20 of his followers in some shack to discuss western imperialism and lies about srebrenica wo n't do much damage , but arresting him will give him all the media attention he craves . 
  furthermore , could the serbian state declare other actions of bosnian muslims and croats during the 90s as war crimes , then punish people for debating those ? 
  then again , will the srebrenica shitstorm ever fade ? 
  there are nazis marching in the us under the veil of free speech ... will it come to that if this law does not pass ? 
  by the way , we already have laws in place against propagating violence and such , we can use those all the time , but we do n't . 
  also , i 'm kinda tired of srebrenica being used as a propaganda tool . 
  just like erdogan and many russian politicians like to play the fascist card against germany whenever there 's a conflict , i 'm afraid the `` srebrenica card '' is making its debut these days , a relegation of such an event to a mere bargaining chip . 
  the goal for some is apparently that the very first word to come up when someone mentions bosnia is `` oh , srebrenica ? 
  '' , and that 's bullshit . 
  100000 people died in the bosnian war , countless have been wounded , displaced , driven away ... and i get that srebrenica is a big deal , but are n't we leaving the rest of the victims out ? 
  and why are n't we learning any lessons from the whole ordeal ?

  op is a phony !, 
  we mostly drank ourselves stupid , ate bbqed meats , slept off the food-alcohol haze in the afternoon , watched tv on the 2nd and went back to work on the 3rd . 
  due to him and the ussr in general , socialist principles have become a `` dirty word '' in many parts of the world and any mentions of workers ' rights are equated to communism , collectivism and the ideologies of weird dictators .

  am i missing something ? 
  is soros suing hungary for its immigration policy , or is it about that soros university ? 
  also , what 's funny is that hungarian minority parties in the north of serbia have stood out against building of public housing for asylum claimants , but have supported vucic on the 2017 presidential elections . 
  why oh why do i have to choose between the far left and the far right like this ? 
  what about replacing every third word with bazdmeg ? 
  it 's shit ... ... because we 're not in it . 
  private rescue organizations ? 
   some mp singing the albanian anthem is really irrelevant to the main issues here . 
  actually , it is kinda relevant . 
  you do n't get to sing a foreign nation 's anthem in a public institution when you 're a public representative . 
  and yes , the whole thing is a mess and gruevski is vucic v2 . 
   serbian propagana apparently there 's no shitstorm in macedonia right now and there are no interethnic conflicts , i 'm being lied to . 
   since the small balkan country ** won independence ** from then-yugoslavia in 1991 ... won ? 
  they had a referendum and peacefully went on their way . 
  there were n't any conflicts . 
  mom has two of them , containing mostly sewing stuff . 
  at this point i doubt they ever contained anything edible . 
   serbian propaganda yeah , and milosevic and the serbs only wanted to remain in a unified yugoslavia , nothing more . 
  this wo n't backfire at all . 
   a russian built train and gift serbia bought tons of these because they were cheaper . 
  russia meddles in tons of stuff , but it had nothing to do with this . 
  this is true , however , rama , thaci and that dude from presevo valley have been making the exact same `` unification '' statements in the recent weeks . 
  this makes vucic stronger , and stirs shit up quite nicely . 
  i have no idea where these statements are coming from , but my guess is that they 're aimed at the eu . 
  `` look at me , look at me , mom ! '', 
  guess vetevendosje does n't exist , then . 
  anyway ... you could n't make them leave even if you wanted to , this is my point . 
  he assumed the position , he was not specifically elected or anything . 
  if he would spew the shit he spewed in the yugoslav people 's army , there 's no way he would even be fit for the position of a gardener . 
  as was the goal of most warring factions in bosnia .
