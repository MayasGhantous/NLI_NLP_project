  ** the real ` reason ' ( in quotes ) ** for slaying so many people is because ( mladic claims ) they were being attacked from the vicinity of srebrenica . 
  while that may be true , he went apeshit about it and proceeded to gather up ablebodied men ( and some children , because why not , being crazy gives you some good decision making skills , obviously ) and `` contain them '' . 
  he made promises to everyone that everything was going to be ok and that he wo n't harm anybody . 
  he mingled with the children and gave out chocolates . 
  keep in mind , mladic is ** nuts ** . 
  he had this idea that everyone of muslim faith in bosnia is a turk , and turks need to be eliminated as they have killed and subjugated the serbian people for centuries . 
  his daughter even committed suicide : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ratko_mladi%c4%87#daughter.27s_suicide, 
  once again , great analysis and predictions . 
  i think reuters wants to sign you up . 
  there are foreign us troops in germany because germany wants them there . 
  kosovo could n't make eulex , kfor and others leave even if it wanted to . 
   modern countries negotiate with one another all the time , so not sure what 's your point with that argument . 
  the point is that you 're negotiating with a country which does n't recognize you and does n't plan on doing so . 
   serbia is like the north korea of europe they just talk they wont do anything you 've got ta be kidding me ... 
  even our current `` beloved dictator '' vucic does n't spew out threats of any kind . 
  where are you getting this from ? 
   croatia would assist albanians . 
  nice analysis there , but croatia is a part of nato and will do what nato does . 
   but kosovo is an independent country now yes , of course ... is that why there 's foreign troops of many nations on it 's soil still keeping peace ? 
  or why you 're negotiating with serbia ? 
  i do n't know if you 're trolling or are you really that walled in in your way of thinking . 
  do n't be so dramatic ... you glared at a braindead old man . 
  the guy had untreateed strokes while he was in hiding , he is incoherent and fucked up more than he 's ever been before . 
  i doubt he can feel anything anymore . 
   dude that happened in 2004 churches and monasteries are still protected by international forces , and there is no organized travel of serbs to places of worship or cemeteries without a police escort , otherwise they usually get stoned or attacked . 
  i would assume incidents like these would be more prevalent , but honestly , there are really no serbs left in kosovo to be hostile to anymore . 
   if we are so hateful toward other religions then why havent we removed it since 18 years after the war ? 
  nourishing a multicultural view of a country in order for it to be presentable towards the us and eu . 
  outside of pristina , however , churches and monasteries were desecrated a few years ago , and many are under police protection these days . 
  serb cemeteries are n't left alone either . 
  no matter who built it , the motion to remove it is usually fueled by religious hatred , not by reason and rule of law . 
  and even though i do n't believe in god ( s ) , the fact that many use that church as a toilet is depressing . 
  it has also been used to make a music video : http://www.telegraf.rs/jetset/1126568-skrnave-srpske-svetinje-gola-albanka-snimila-spot-u-crkvi-hrista-spasa-u-pristini-video, 
  threatening the eu at this point is ... probably counterproductive , but hell , let 's see how it plays out . 
  yeah , thaci is a fucktard , but this is n't something i expected from rama ... or should i have ? 
   and the serbians are scared shitless and posting stuff like this i was asking a question in order to prevent the spread of government propaganda , but apparently there 's no need , you 're already neck deep in it . 
  `` albanian unification '' paves the way towards a new shitstorm in bosnia , and this is what i actually care about . 
  the turnout for the presidential elections this year were just barely above 50 % in serbia . 
  so , yeah , 47.21 % in the diaspora is massive to us . 
  wore nothing more than a t-shirt as of a week or so ago , and today it was fucking snowing . 
  that 's a pretty good turnout , to be honest . 
  i remember a few years ago , my sister has completed her university courses and had graduated ... she wanted to go from subotica/szabadka ( serbia ) to szeged ( hungary ) , which is an hour or so drive away , to have a walk around szeged and visit abroad for the first time in years . 
  the serbian passport was pretty much useless at that time , and you needed visas to enter the eu , and thus hungary . 
  she headed to the hungarian consulate , paid all applicable fees , got asked about her background , had to write down tons of shit , and ... she got rejected . 
  she has just finished uni , so she was a `` prime candidate to enter the eu , find a job which pays under the table , and never come back '' . 
  what i 'm saying is ... 
  i have no idea where these people came from all of a sudden . 
  there were always borders , and while we do n't like them , there 's a reason why they exist . 
  and yes , we were stuck behind them as well , but we lived our lives and did n't make a huge fuss . 
  and claiming that these refugees are somehow `` stuck '' in serbia in 2017 is offensive to me . 
  it 's not like they 're persecuted here , nor is there a reason why they could n't claim asylum here , or in a eu countru like greece or bulgaria , which they have trekked through . 
  also , i 'm sick of antifascist ideas and ideologies being abused this way . 
  having a border does not equal instituting fascism . 
  k u l e n u l e n, 
  meddling with montenegro when it decided it would become a part of nato , financing anti-western/anti-eu fractions in serbia , being in bed with dodik , etc. . . 
  i 'm talking about putin and his tendency to throw a wrench in the machine that is the balkans . 
  depends on how we react as a whole . 
   but back then nobody gave shit about it , it was pointless thing and nobody tried to argue about that . 
  back then everyone had enough money to live comfortably , so war was out of the question . 
  brotherhood and unity , unless your currency value is shit . 
  so ... you 're saying no serbs were forced out of their homes during the bosnian war ? 
  you 're trollbaiting again ... and by the way , the jna had plenty of muslims , croats and hungarians amongst their ranks . 
  being multicultural does n't make you right by default . 
  did n't you used to have a croatian flag next to your name , by the way ? 
  oh , right , we are talking about the past now ... 
  i 'm sure that some serbs could have stayed in larger cities in certain circumstances , but to imply that they were n't cast out just like everyone else was , or even killed for their ethnicity or religion is just outright deceiving . 
   stop trying to relativise war crimes stop trying to trollbait . 
  the current government does n't have to do anything , there are no more serbs left in kosovo outside of the north and within maybe a few enclaves . 
  throwing rocks at serb buses , wrecking havoc at serb cemeteries and blocking roads is all done by the local populace , and the government just goes `` oh , that 's bad , you should n't do that '' . 
   no one is forcing them leave nobody is publicly forcing anyone to leave in bosnia . 
  but people want to leave because they are shunned , threatened , isolated , etc. 
   perpetrators : army of republika srpska , scorpions paramilitary group so ... not serbia . 
   as many as chose to stay . 
  cut that shit out . 
  my croatian cousins despise bosniak-run parts of bosnia and want to leave asap , let alone serbs . 
  the same applies for bosniaks in serb-controlled rural areas . 
  i 'll always remember him from er ... 
  but his latest movie ( you know the one ) is going to be dead on arrival , is n't it ? 
  can confirm , were soviet all along , even when we were preparing for soviet invasion after the tito-stalin split . 
  ahh , astra ... where the germans get their quality programming from . 
  afghans and kurds ? 
  funny ... most of the time , we have knife fights between the afghans and the pakistanis for some reason . 
  a ) nothing will happen because of this statement b ) everyone in kosovo kept quiet until the us embassy , various eu offices and unmik reacted and strongly condemned the statement . 
  then thaci followed suit like the good boy he is and condemned it as well , then haradinaj saw that threats like that are kinda bad pr so he said his words were `` taken out of context '' . 
  why yes , i have posted about killing the infidels in the past 24hrs !, 
  why do you ask ? 
  well , nobody 's drinking arany \u00c1szok ... 
  it 's also fairly neutral . 
  and just how many came back ? 
  `` greater serbia '' also includes macedonia , yet the macedonians got out easy . 
   the entire war was a quagmire of shifting alliances and atrocities , in each case pushed on by radical nationalist leaders and perpetuated on a platform of hate towards the other you just described that perfectly . 
  as a resident of the balkan peninsula , you have my thumbs up . 
  god fucking damn it , thank you !, 
  finally , some common sense !, 
  i 've been reading major news websites , both serbian and croatian , this morning and have been feeling sick to my stomach . 
  the nationalist celebrations with anti-serb propaganda , the anti-croatian feelings and protests oozing from serbia ... this is disgusting , and the churches ringing their bells in zagreb is even more so . 
  i can guarantee exactly something like this will happen when that retard seselj is released too . 
  on this day , 100 years ago , gavrilo princip assassinated the austro-hungarian archduke franz ferdinand . 
  due to various shifts in the political climate and the disproportion of power balances on the continent , europe was a powder keg , and this assassinations was the fuse . 
  most historians agree with this fact .
