  russia does n't even recognize kosovo . 
  a certain british official ( ca n't find the article from a few days ago ) has recently frowned on the idea of republika srpska seceding from bosnia and becoming independent , denying that such an event will ever take place . 
  i 'm fairly neutral on the subject , but that 's freakin ' hillarious . 
   i did n't know serbia was good at basketball err ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbia_national_basketball_team, 
  it did ... for a few nanoseconds before joining the russian federation . 
  oh , and ukraine has n't recognized kosovo yet , adding even more oomph to this weird situation . 
  in serbia ? 
  almost nobody . 
  but i can make an exception for [ mr. \u017darko kora\u0107 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%bdarko_kora%c4%87 ) . 
  never used harsh words , was always realistic , and is a joy to listen to . 
  due to his lack of a big mouth , he will rarely get elected for anything . 
  with kosovo as it 's own breakaway territory , do you really think serbia would support crimean independence and back russia ? 
  then again , russia has n't recognized kosovo as independent ... western countries : * kosovo independence goood , crimean independence baaad . 
  * russia and it 's allies : * kosovo independence baaad , crimean independence goooood . 
  * it 's one gigantic clusterfuck , hence , serbia is sitting this one out . 
  have fun . 
  so , neighbor , how are things ? 
  oh shut up ... it 's a few bearded idiots who went over there to either jack off to their weird ideas or to just loot . 
  there are discussions about what to do with them if they come back . 
  maybe a slight increase in exports , but people are certainly overestimating serbia 's export capabilities to russia . 
   gotovina was acquitted of all charges . 
  just barely . 
  both of them can go burn in hell . 
  greetings from serbia : http://i.imgur.com/7abcw92.jpg greetings from serbia , with love : http://i.imgur.com/56rsqjy.jpg, 
  serbia : the romans are quite chill , building stuff and whatnot . 
  we 're building walls in [ singidunum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/singidunum ) , so there 's plenty of jobs for the time being ... let 's just hope those guys in pannonia up north hold their ground against the barbaric tribes . 
  i hear there 's plenty of sand up there . 
  also , some dude down south drew some tits : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:gamzigrad.jpg awww yeah . 
   it 's 2014 , people !, 
  a website that ca n't be used without javascript is not a website . 
  errr ... 
  it 's the exact opposite . 
  good , dynamic content on the internet is made possible by javascript . 
  depends on which one ... 
  it was all about scapegoating . 
  jews did n't have anybody to back them , nor did the romani , nor did homosexuals , secret societies , the disabled , etc. , so they were pretty much an easy target for the nazi regime . 
  who 's at fault for x ? 
  point the finger at the unprotected people - problem solved . 
  also : free slave labor , grabbing all of their belongings , doing medical experiments , murdering them when they are all used up ... when you 're a crazed nazi , hellbent on taking over the continent , what 's not to like ? 
  `` genetic inferiority '' did plenty of backbreaking labor for these sickos in their clean , pressed uniforms ; and since there was nobody to stand up to the aggressors , it was an apparent win win . 
  fortunately , things have changed , and we do stand up for these people nowadays . 
  most european countries are protectors of all of their citizens , no matter their ethnic background . 
  even if there are plenty of hiccups , it 's not a * standard * anymore to openly discriminate against any ethnic group based on their ethnicity alone . 
  i 'm glad we 've come so far . 
  due to a lower education rate and general isolationist tendencies among the romani people , i 'm saddened to say many stories from this holocaust will remain untold , and many secrets will be and have already been taken to the grave . 
  i do n't know if we can change that in any way , but gathering testimonies and writing down any story , no matter how small , will contribute to the world not making the same mistakes ever again . 
  i see plenty of people talking about `` assimilating '' of the romani , but in the eu , even a nomadic lifestyle is acceptable if it 's within the means of the law ... the only thing the romani need , just like anybody else , is a proper education . 
  an expansion of one 's horizons , teaching a man `` how to fish '' , is a sure way out of isolation and poverty . 
  the more they can explore the world on their own , the more we will see the best of the romani people , hear their stories and feel what they feel . 
  even though they may roam the lands freely , many romani are still in their own little prison . 
  neat fact for me : one commemoration event is being held in ni\u0161 , serbia :  ** red cross concentration camp , crveski krst , ni\u0161 , serbia **  organiser : reconstruction women 's fund  reconstruction women 's fund runs a programme entitled \u201e mirror `` that aims at supporting associated young women to actively participate in decision making that affects their lives . 
  as part of this programme , \u201e indigo `` group for children and youth in partnership with terra del fuoco organises the project \u201e step in -- step out `` , a summer camp with 30 youth , roma and non-roma from italy and serbia , in ni\u0161 ( 2-6 august 2014 ) . 
  within the summer camp , participants will commemorate 2 august at the red cross concentration camp , they will also visit the roma and jewish cemetery , roma cult place zajdebaca , and bubanj , and will learn about the project ` train of memory ' organized by terra del fuoco for italian students to learn about the holocaust . 
  the jews or the masons . 
  most of nazi propaganda in ww2 included a snake as a representation of the jewish or ( for some reason ) masonic conspiracy . 
  i watched the broadcast on hrt1 ... somehow brought a smile to my face , knowing that you 've made it . 
  if anything , you 're now shielded from ultra-extremist politicians and rash economists . 
  i wish we had that kind of luxury . 
   on the internet it 's the serbs who seem to moan so much ** about not being allowed to commit genocide ** . 
  i 'm not even going to try ... you 've obviously conjured up your own tale and you 're not going to let go anytime soon . 
  feeling superior must have a musky smell to it , enjoy . 
  generalizations are awesome ... but you know what , go ahead and tell your neighbors how disgusting they are for not taking the blame for colonial atrocities , apartheid , crap in iraq and everything in between . 
  it 's pretty much the same deal . 
  these people are trying to tell you it 's not their fault . 
  and you know what , it 's not , but when you keep telling them they 're responsible for a genocide , they tend to be freakin ' defensive about it . 
  you find the thread funny because you enjoy drama . 
  i do n't hold that against you , but if that 's your thing , enjoy : http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/218gig/drama_in_reurope_when_a_very_defensive_serbian/, 
   the muh bridges thread got weird pretty fast , swinging between depressing and funny , in a gallows humour kind of way . 
  i still have lots of people tagged from then . 
  please do n't let this one be a `` classic '' ... it brought up / r/europe 's occasional tendencies to put reality aside and switch to / int / - like discussions . 
  also i got aggressive pms for days after that . 
  i can take any joke and have a good laugh , especially polandball-like ones ... there 's plenty of dark humor to laugh about , but this was n't a funny thread , it was just plain mean . 
  how is this news ? 
  non-eu citizens need different , lengthy and costly procedures to gain employment inside the eu . 
  yeah , it appears you ca n't just exchange fire for years and , after plenty of dead bodies , form a country and expect everything to go just fine . 
  not a single balkan country can prosper until they let go of the notion that * their * army was infallible and just . 
  guess it 's time to post memes and start flamewars ... as is tradition ... 
   many europeans still see us as an enemy not you specifically , but your government sure is whack . 
  banning websites and officially clinging on to the cult of ataturk ... seriously ? 
  with that kind of crap , i 'm surprised the eu is even showing signs of good will . 
  this is n't the 60s anymore . 
  also , `` turkish cyprus '' - take care of that . 
   as long as their mentality towards us does n't change what about the mentality of turkish citizens in the eu ? 
  are current eu citizens the only ones at fault here ? 
   i do n't trust the eu . 
  i have the feeling that they would try to use us for their own benefit . 
  who is `` they '' ? 
  and ca n't eu citizens pretty much say the same : `` the turks are using our system for their benefit '' ? 
  it 's supposed to be a mutually beneficial process , is it not ? 
  yeah , but that 's the exception . 
  also , once you get indoors , you take your scarf off . 
  technically , the boston tea party was also a crime . 
   it 's having some fucking sense in realising that something like that leads to repercussions on your people , and as it turned out , people all over the world hindsight is 20/20 . 
  under any other circumstance , the murder of a monarch would lead to instability and unrest , but eventually things would die down since ferdinand was n't really the most important person in austro-hungary at the time . 
  but they were looking for a war , and that has been established . 
  i 'm pretty sure princip would keep the gun in his pants if he had known a full blown world military conflict would come about . 
  oh , and the repercussions came , and they came hard : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-serb_riots_in_sarajevo  * encouraged by the austro-hungarian government , the violent demonstrations assumed the characteristics of a pogrom , leading to ethnic divisions unprecedented in the city 's history . 
  * like always , the people of bosnia were treated as second-class citizens in their own land and were used as toys . 
  how great of a nation that was . 
   has the last 50 years of instability and infighting in the balkan area been worth it ?
