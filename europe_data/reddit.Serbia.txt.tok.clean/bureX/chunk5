  oh , now it 's princip 's fault for ww2 and the civil wars in the balkans ? 
  guess every balkan nation should have just bent over . 
  `` shut up . 
  put up . 
  ask any other nation if thousands upon thousands of dead were worth it for the establishment of their state ... it does n't really work that way . 
  every current nation is the end-result of inconceivable amounts of spilt blood . 
   is it that inconceivable that it would n't have been worse under austro-hungarian rule ? 
  yes , it is inconceivable . 
  why ? 
  because a majority population of muslims , serbs and croats ca n't be conquered and ruled by foreign powers forever . 
  unless you consider them to be subhuman , as some do . 
  i have numerous accounts of what it was like under austria-hungary . 
  not under bosnia though , but in more peaceful vojvodina . 
  and , like expected , non hungarians , non austrians and non germans were treated like second class citizens . 
  they could n't use their own names formally , they were insulted , they had less rights , they could n't express their culture as much as others , and they were there pretty much only to grow food as necessary and fight the ottomans as necessary . 
  these rebellions did n't come out of nowhere , they had a reason for existing . 
  but cut it out with this `` oh why oh why wo n't the balkans just submit to the will of foreign powers ? '', 
  first the ottomans , and then the aus . 
  people get tired of being treated like shit . 
  these days due to the fact that this certain part of the balkans is not doing so well , many are holding on to this notion of imaginary nostalgia , where everything would have been just hunky-dory if austria-hungary would have remained in power , when in fact , there is not a single shred of evidence for this . 
  this is just another case of `` if only '' , used in hard times , with the serbs responding in their own nationalistic way when confronted with this . 
  although it is pretty stupid to be cheering for tito for decades , and then deciding 20 yrs later `` austria-hungarian rule was better '' . 
   i guess you could say that we started our own involvement in that war , by not trusting the germans at their word . 
  how can you trust the germans at their word , when they did not trust and respect belgium 's neutrality ? 
  they lied about france engaging them in the first place . 
  you were a spat out speck on their map : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_rape_of_belgium . 
  was this princip 's fault ? 
   we 're still a kingdom and doing pretty well for ourselves except you 're not , at least not the kingdom in the sense we 're talking about , like the one 100yrs ago . 
  you 're a parliamentary , constitutional monarchy , where your royalty is no more than a historical decoration centerpiece . 
  you wo n't get thrown in jail or murdered for insulting royalty , nor will you get in huge trouble for having a simple protest . 
  the difference is immense . 
  there is no comparison . 
  yeah , he should have expressed his pan-slavism and yugoslav patriotism by shaking ferdinand 's hand and asking him for bosnian autonomy . 
  under a freakin ' monarchy . 
  yeah , but that 's not how it works . 
  that 's how revolutions happen - one man 's murderer is another man 's hero . 
  if you ask me , i do n't care if any blue-blooded son of a bitch was shot in the face during those times . 
  franz ferdinand , peter the 1st of serbia , i really do n't care . 
  they 're relics of the past and should have died off , and they will die off if they have n't already . 
  we will pick and choose our governments , not be dictated by some pseudo-sophisticated tight-wearing silver spoon dickwads , who are in power only based on their blood . 
  because we can vote and voice our opinion , we do n't have to grab arms every time we wish to express ourselves . 
  in today 's world , princip would have been just another student on a soapbox voicing his opinions , not a killer . 
  germany had no issues with invading belgium during ww1 , even though it was neutral . 
  what would you have done if you were constantly living under the shadow of some german kaiser ? 
  yeah , due to the 100 year anniversary since the shooting in sarajevo . 
  but that 's not what i meant . 
  it has been established time and time again that ww1 was bound to happen , whether princip fired the shot or not . 
   that started one of the worst wars in human history can we let this go already ? 
  royalty does n't really mingle with the locals , other than on those very few occasions , such as that one . 
  i 'm pretty sure their sole intention was to hurt the ferdinands . 
  they were inexperienced and were provided with weapons just like that , expecting them to be rational in that circumstance is a bit too much . 
   when you throw a bomb near innocent bystanders you ca n't say i 'm doing this because i ca n't vote . 
  well , you * can * ... does n't mean you 'd be right , though . 
  but i stand by my premise . 
  try and find how many monarchs were peacefully disbanded , and how many were either threatened , overthrown , deposed , killed , etc. 
  it 's stupid , it 's horrific , but it 's standard practice . 
  i mean , it 's not like the austro-hungarians came into bosnia with milk and cookies in the first place : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/storming_of_the_castle_of_sarajevo_1878.jpg, 
  no , i understand and i agree with your premise . 
  i was just following the thread . 
  i am disputing the `` terrorist '' epithet . 
  yeah , these days in most european countries , you can hold referendums , vote for other parties and other people , you can protest and you can pretty much voice your opinion . 
  you can publish almost whatever you want , and you can share your thoughts with the world . 
  even though franz ferdinand was fairly liberal , to my understanding , a * monarchy * calling princip a terrorist sounds pretty damn stupid . 
  what else could have one done to further his goals , or the goals of those who thought like him ? 
  hold a protest ? 
  run for office ? 
  what did empires do when they felt threatened even a little bit ? 
  did they not lock up/main/kill the `` offender '' outright ? 
  i 'm not saying shooting ferdinand and his wife is n't a dick move , but i feel it 's quite unfair to apply today 's standards to something that happened 100 years ago under a tightly controlled monarchy . 
  you 're utilizing a recently created concept in a 100 year old setting . 
  i do n't like the fact that everyone 's using this image of princip : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:gavrilo_princip_cropped.jpg it 's a picture from his jail cell after being roughed up . 
  this one shows him as is : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:gavrilo_princip_young.jpg, 
  yup , first time i 've seen that , i was blown away . 
  imagine reading a whole different language , and realizing you understand every word of it . 
  it 's not esperanto , it 's much more brilliant than that . 
  there 's also [ pupin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mihajlo_pupin ) , but he does n't get too much attention ... even though he was the founding member of fucking nasa ( then called [ naca ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_advisory_committee_for_aeronautics ) ) . 
  also : in 2014 , serbia has a better press freedom index than it 's neighboring countries on the balkans : hungary ( eu ) , croatia ( eu ) , bosnia , montenegro , albania , macedonia , greece ( eu ) , bulgaria ( eu ) http://rsf.org/index2014/en-eu.php serbia also has vojvodina as it 's ambassador ... vojvodina is a very peaceful and tolerant multi cultural region with 6 official languages and immense cultural values . 
  there are thousands of eu citizens ( hungarians , romanians , croats ) living in vojvodina at this very moment . 
  our roads may not be the greatest , but they 're plentiful : http://i.imgur.com/4lfst1l.png, 
  fuck , [ we have those ] ( http://nasisrbija.org/index.php/category/international/english/ ) in serbia ... do n't know if they 're banned yet , but they 're under close watch due to recently releasing a [ list of public figures ] ( http://nasisrbija.org/index.php/2014/03/28/spisak-30-najvecih-srbomrzaca-i-izdajnika-medju-javnim-licnostima/ ) who are `` enemies of serbia '' . 
  most of their activities are ultranationalist , anti-gay , anti-eu , pro-russian , etc. 
  ( they do n't have camps or a paramilitary , or anything similar ), 
   the goal was to sneak into an open garage , steal some beer or other items and slip away into the night . 
  it was dumb and clearly illegal . 
  it was not supposed to be deadly . 
  oh , right ... of course it was n't . 
  `` tee hee , i 'm just gon na go about stealing shit from others and expect a slap on the wrist ! '' . 
  there is n't a country in the world where this is acceptable . 
   inside the house , motion sensors alerted markus kaarma , 29 , to an intruder 's presence . 
  two recent burglaries had put mr. kaarma and his young family on edge , his lawyer said , and he grabbed a shotgun from the dining room and rushed outside . 
  he aimed into the garage and , according to court documents , fired four blasts into the dark . 
  tell you what , based on the violence that happened to people i know in their own homes by burglars , i ca n't in any way condemn the use of force to prevent burglaries in their own homes . 
  though i ca n't say i 'm really satisfied with the hasty reaction by the homeowner , it 's obvious gun control has very little to do with this , unless you 're aiming to ban every weapon in existence in the us . 
  similar : http://i.imgur.com/0cpn68b.jpg ... but still the `` fuck you kids '' version . 
  nevertheless , we gave each other boosts to climb it . 
  fuck the police !, 
  serbia/yugoslavia too ... just without the middle bar , usually . 
  that 's what some in serbia also thought , but as it turns out , it 's not a bad deal . 
  the way we 've been treated just to cross a border that 's within walking distance for one day is atrocious . 
  `` we did n't invade anybody !,
