  this is the voice of the people you 're trying to suppress !, 
  usa go home !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cunvwbp_jsa&amp;t=2m ) '', 
  and russians respond with : `` how can there be mutual understanding between two sides , of which one would completely assimilate it 's member countries into debt , slavery and fascism , while the other is successfully leading a long battle against imperialist forces and powerful interest groups while striving for unity and freedom for over sixty years now ? '', 
  have you seen anti-government protests in ukraine by the russian ethnic minority ? 
  they 're calling the other side * fascists * !, 
  putin is their liberator , `` america '' and the eu are only seeking to divide them and rob them of their natural resources . 
  we can either tell them they 're plainly wrong and that they 're terrorists , or we can try to understand their position and try to counter it with forms of compromise . 
  i prefer an untouched , whole , peaceful ukraine . 
  possibly with eu aspirations , since i 'm not satisfied with russia as a country nor am i satisfied with how they treat their citizens or enforce the laws . 
  that does n't mean i 'm willing to accept any article without a healthy dose of skepticism . 
  `` jews are being told to register with authorities '' , `` 100000000000 russian troops are just on the ukrainian border '' , etc. 
  this also does n't mean i do n't accept the fact that crimea is strongly pro-russia and there is very little one can do to get it back under ukrainian influence , especially since the government started calling people `` terrorists '' . 
  / r/europe sucks when it comes to the recent ukrainian discussions . 
  / r/worldnews is not much better . 
  it 's become an usa/europe vs russia flamewar without either side striving towards understanding each other . 
  you do n't need to defend russia to accumulate downvotes , just try and have a discussion that does n't follow the circlejerk and you 're all set . 
   this is by no means a clean-hand approach oh ? 
  well , go ahead and ask russia have they sent any troops in ... they 'll outright deny it . 
  you 're claiming they 've sent some ? 
  prove it . 
  if you question these masked men , they 'll probably hit you in the face with the butt of their gun , or they 'll just say they 're here because they support their russian brothers , or something along those lines , and even if they admit who they are , the russian government will deny any involvement . 
  russia , ** officially ** , is not involved in any of this with their own troops . 
  unofficially , i know they 're involved , you know they 're involved , the eu knows , the us knows , my dead grandma knows . 
  but in order to deny their involvement and wash their hands of this , they ca n't weasel in thousands of troops over the border and say `` was n't us '' , they need advisers , weapon procurers , undocumented soldiers in smaller numbers which will form a resistance from the locals and stir shit up . 
  this is a tried and true recipe that was used by the russians and the us for decades . 
   a separatist movement has no legitimacy and can never succeed , if they are not suppressed in their country . 
  oh , where have i heard * this * before ... 
  this is wishful thinking . 
  anyone can make all sorts of demands and push their people 's agenda to the limit , until the government says `` no , no further '' ... then the cries of `` suppression '' come along . 
  ukraine 's government has just issued an ultimatum , the protesters will claim they 're being suppressed and that their rights are being infringed . 
   i 'm struggling to understand what 's stopping the ukrainian military from marching in and eliminating these clearly violent individuals . 
  because you ca n't expect those violent individuals to tuck their tails between their legs and scurry off , never to be seen again . 
  you 're giving them a platform , they 'll be able to cry `` suppression ! '', 
  and recruit more likeminded individuals to their cause . 
   russian brothers r. . . right ... 
  here in serbia we had a grand opening of the south stream . 
  but all work has been halted for the time being . 
  i do n't really know what 's going on . 
  and russia in turn will work towards screwing ukraine so they can gloat in a `` we told you so '' way . 
  first these squabbles in pro-russian regions , then withdrawal of aid , then the rise in price of gas . 
  russia 's economy depends heavily on the west . 
  they 'll nibble only on the parts of ukraine which ooze russian support , and they 'll do so very carefully . 
  if bickering like this continues , those `` independent regions '' will most likely look and function like the rogue state of transistria . 
   what ??? 
  how would it not matter ? 
  crimea has a russian majority . 
  donetsk does not . 
  donetsk itself does have a 48.15 % population of russians and a 46.65 % population of ukrainians . 
  * if * hostilities continue , i 'm guessing there is to be a drop in the ukrainian population rates , which will only aid the separatists even further . 
  this is what they 're seeking to do . 
   no , but i would expect them to realize that they are in ukraine , not russia . 
  oh , they do realize that , i 'm sure of it . 
  it 's just that they want to fight against that realization . 
  * does n't really matter if it 's crimea or donetsk , the point stands - russian locals are leading a separatist movement in russian-populated regions of ukraine , and russia will aid them with military advisers , weaponry and other supplies covertly . 
  that does n't mean they are willing to invade anybody since they have others to do their bidding - a clean-hand approach . 
   i would expect them to get the hell out of eastern ukraine . 
  and the local russian population will just say `` well , okay '' ? 
  probably not . 
  kla - once considered a terrorist organization , was somewhat supported during the kosovo war in 1999 by western forces . 
  goal : separation of kosovo ( and all albanian-populated regions in serbia ) from serbia . 
  `` crimean self-defense forces '' , or whatever they 're called - considered to be a legitimate `` voice of the people '' by russia , or a `` destabilizing separatist group '' by others . 
  goal : crimean independence , integration into russia jso - specop forces of serbia with plenty of influencing power ... went rogue and killed serbian pm zoran djindjic in 2003. , subsequently disbanded and it 's members arrested . 
  goal : getting shitfaced and terrorizing the local populace and their legitimate representatives . 
  he 's trying to point out that water is wet and that russians are obviously going to support everything that goes in their favor , just like western nations are . 
  i 'm trying to have a conversation , but it appears you 're merely trying to pick a fight . 
  edit : since you 've edited your post ...  apparently they know the language of st. petersburg even better ( ** some ** of the troops raiding police stations in donetsk were identified as speaking russian with a st. petersburg accent ) !, 
  how might that have happened ? 
  that 's right - some . 
  emphasis mine . 
  i never said there is absolutely no russian military presence in crimea . 
   obviously you would n't find it odd if some armed men from ljubljana came to liberate the slovenes of serbia ? 
  and now you 're just being a dick and putting words in my mouth . 
   are you just joking now ? 
  no , i 'm not . 
  russia/ussr has a long tradition of placing political pressure , making threats , sending military aid , forming guerrillas and militias , but direct invasions are always their last resort and is certainly not something they even need in crimea . 
  they have a huge part of the crimean population supporting russian integration whether we like it or not , they do n't need to invade anybody , the jobs is already done for them and they have a plethora of willing men to serve them from crimea whenever they snap their fingers . 
  in fact , let 's just put aside any and all russian military personnel you claim are present in crimea . 
  hypothetically , they 're beamed up to the iss and are no longer present . 
  what are you expecting to happen ? 
  a peaceful reintegration of crimea in the ukraine ? 
  a pro-eu sentiment in crimea ? 
  a declaration of crimean independence from russia ? 
  i do n't believe that 's what would happen . 
  i 'm assuming he 's referring to the kla : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_liberation_army the jso in his username is a reference to this : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jso_ ( special_operations_unit ), 
   because the equipment he 's wearing costs more than what the average ukrainian can dream of earning in decades . 
  and what makes you think they * bought * that for themselves ? 
  it 's probably covert russian military aid , like i said . 
   and because the photos and videos i have seen of them show them to be acting professional . 
  and just how many former ukranian military personnel has defected in the crimean region ? 
  there 's your answer . 
   it can , but it is n't and i 'm not naive enough to give russia the benefit of the doubt . 
  so , we have crimea , an overwhelmingly pro-russian region , with heaps of ex-ukranian military members who have defected , know the people , know the region , know the language , and russia still sends only it 's own troops to invade ? 
  no , i 'm not buying it . 
  especially given russia/ussr 's reputation of avoiding full blown invasions and more often opting in for internal destabilization of their opponents and giving military aid in secrecy . 
  why do you think it 's a foreign militia ? 
  why ca n't it simply be a foreign equipped local militia ? 
  the local pro-russian populace will know every inch of the region , it will know where `` threats '' may be , and * who * they may be . 
  they have connections and acquaintances and know proper ukranian . 
   if armed and disguised men came to my country i know i would n't really be comforted by your response that `` not all of them are paid by that enemy country '' .
