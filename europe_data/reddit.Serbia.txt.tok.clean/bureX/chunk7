  i was n't trying to comfort anybody . 
  if anything , i 'd be more concerned for fuck 's sake ... 
  this means that it 's not a clear 1 on 1 case of `` us vs the russians '' but that ukraine has an internal threat , and it 's very own citizens are forming well equipped militias which may lead to a civil war outbreak . 
  those guns , pants , uniforms , pouches are made in the thousands . 
  they do n't come in many different fashion choices . 
  russian presence is there , but it does n't mean every `` concerned citizen '' in uniform is a russian spetznas agent . 
  probably just some mercenaries or mercenary-wannabees who got an `` anonymous aid package '' . 
  do you think the russians are exempt from the age of the internet ? 
  various news aggregators , google , and similar services provide you with news of interest based on your browsing habits . 
  the keyword `` russia '' is bound to attract , well , russians . 
  and they are quite defensive . 
  cold war villains ? 
  russians . 
  movie villains ? 
  russians . 
  video game villains ? 
  russians . 
  they know they have a bad rep , they know they 're viewed as the villains yet again , and they want to say something in response to that , even though you , me or anybody else may disagree with that . 
  furthermore , once we skim through the news and move on to other activities , our life is pretty much the way it was 5 minutes ago and nothing is bound to change any time soon . 
  not true for ukranians and the russians ... news related to their current situation influences their feelings in a way we ca n't understand . 
  they live in the area where the `` news is happening '' , and some journalist who has heard of ukraine a grand total of 3 times before wrote an article about how their lives look like and what they may expect - disagreements and heated debates are bound to happen . 
  try posting a youtube clip related to any kosovo topic . 
  serbs and albanians , ahoy !, 
  one thing i 've noticed ... any article that uses the term `` kosov ** a ** '' is usually quite biased . 
  calling one version of events a `` liberation '' , while the other one seems to be an `` annexation '' . 
  ask a different party what they think , and they 'll think that one is an `` occupation '' , while the other is a `` liberation from the clutches of angela merkel '' . 
  if that 's how you want to play this game , you might as well stop now , because a short-order rt article will come out tomorrow that will rebut this person 's view of events . 
  emotional responses are not really helping when it comes to these articles , but that 's to be expected , since it originates from here : http://www.islamicpluralism.org/2371/balkan-lessons , and the main contact figure for the center for islamic pluralism is indeed the author of this article , stephen suleyman schwartz . 
  russia is playing the nationalist card and their leaders know exactly what they 're doing . 
  calling the opposing party `` fascist '' is a common tactic and they 'll use it numerous times to their advantage . 
  [ but what makes you think the other side is n't using it as well ? 
  ] ( https://www.google.rs/search?q=putin+hitler&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=_-9fu4avasm8oyorgyak&amp;ved=0cagq_auoaq&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=949 ) also , when will that time come where we stop blaming every single thing in the 90s balkan conflicts on milosevic ? 
  the guy was a dick , i should know , and i would gladly put 3 bullets in his face if i had the chance , but he could n't have singlehandedly caused all that ruckus . 
  the fucker chatted on a regular basis with tudjman about the partitioning of bosnia . 
  they 're doing the same thing with putin these days . 
  putin is just the head of a system , but the system itself is there and it 's chugging along independently , and western pressure will just fuel it more . 
  why do you think germany and other eu countries are against cold war tactics , sanctions , and a decline in diplomacy ? 
  continue to push russia and take wrong turns , and the thin diplomacy line the west has with putin will break and even more hardcore nationalists will emerge to take putin 's place . 
  no matter how much generalizations and parallels one must draw , i know one similarity that will hit both sides : despair . 
  living in a country that 's partially recognized creates constant tension , difficulties in diplomatic relations , more border disputes , slowed transport and customs , and will result in ever more dicking around in the un . 
  a lowered quality of life is expected in kosovo and crimea , but it will impact serbia and russia as well and already is . 
  it 's worth noting , though , ukraine has not recognized kosovo , nor has russia . 
  how 's that for a clusterfuck ? 
  thanks for sharing . 
  the reason why i 'm weirded out by that story is because even the most hardcore nationalistic prick over here would gladly take money from his most dire enemy . 
  guess this one was either the exception , or just pants-on-head retarded . 
  this is very odd . 
  usually you 'd get better service because they sense you 'll buy more stuff . 
  i 'd like to know how were you refused service , exactly ... 
   at the hands of a government your parents supported my parents have n't supported the regime . 
  they voted against milosevic every single time . 
  the votes you saw overwhelmingly in favor of milosevic were real , but also partly stolen , partly blackmailed . 
  you voted for sps in order to keep your job , or because state tv told you your pension would be extinguished if you vote for anybody else . 
  if you 're a kosovo albanian , there was a high chance of your vote going directly to milosevic , even though you have n't even voted . 
  in the internet era this is kinda silly to discuss , but during those days we could n't watch anything other than rts tv ( the official state channel ) , and you could get in trouble for owning a satellite dish . 
  the huge anti-milosevic protests were recorded in such a way to present them as a `` tiny group of hooligans '' , while any pro-milosevic protest was gloriously presented for a full 15 minutes when the news lasted only for 30 minutes . 
  that , and due to the fact that cameras were very expensive back then , there are n't many recordings to be found online of anti-milosevic protests . 
  if you had a camera , it was huge and probably vhs based , and the police would gladly smash it for you , along with your ribs : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khanbqjvqni even so , protests were a regular sight . 
  if you were a bit more vocal , your family would get threatened , and you could very well end up like [ slavko \u0106uruvija ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavko_%c4%86uruvija ) . 
   if the serbian people had risen up against the government at any point and at least shown some sign that they wanted peace ** 1991 ** - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shkbds-upfq ** 1992 ** - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-vz0qh9g24 ** 1993 and 1994 ** : few protests , usually just a state of falling apart : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3r6shofj1m ** 1995-1997 ** - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h6mvftycse ** 1998 ** - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdvp-8le3ue ** 1999 ** - well , you know ... staging an anti-milosevic protest at this time could very well get you shot . 
  ** 2000 ** ( finally ) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l16nrxs1rxs i clearly remember regular protests in my hometown ... especially around 19:30 , when the state news starts broadcasting . 
  pots and pans were the weapon of choice , along with anything that could draw attention . 
  i saw people turning their lights on and off constantly in nearby buildings , really awesome sight of defiance . 
  my cousin ran off from the military police routinely to avoid being drafted , even though he had two kids at the time . 
  my dad was demoted at his place of work because he was n't a milosevic sympathizer , my other cousin was n't so lucky and he got drafted and got his chest shot off . 
  this is from wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbia_in_the_yugoslav_wars  the high number of casualties incurred in the battle of vukovar caused serious popular discontent in serbia and montenegro , where tens of thousands of those receiving draft papers went into hiding or left the country . 
  a near-mutiny broke out in some reservist units , and mass demonstrations against the war were held in the serbian towns of valjevo , \u010ca\u010dak and kragujevac . 
  ** in one famous incident , a tank driver named vladimir \u017divkovi\u0107 drove his tank all the way from the front line at vukovar to the federal parliament in belgrade . 
  ** many serbs simply did not identify with the croatian serb cause and were unwilling to see their lives , or those of their children , sacrificed at vukovar . 
  the serbian government wants us to see albanians as natural enemies in the same way the kosovo government wants to see serbs as natural enemies . 
  this fuels their election campaigns very nicely . 
  to add : i remember milosevic 's speeches on tv . 
  the things he said vs the things he had done are completely separate . 
  not once did he call for offensive wars publicly . 
  he spoke only of peace and defense of `` our centuries old homeland '' . 
  every single speech of his had the word `` peace '' in it . 
  to this day i do n't know if he was outright lying , or has he deluded himself into believing his own patriotic speeches . 
  ** edit : if you have anything to say , say it here . 
  stop sending me passive aggressive pms . 
   now simoutaneousely imagine that the bridges in the hometown of the people doing these things to you are being destroyed and somewhere in that city there is a kid that can not play with his toys , and please come back here and tell me you would genuinely care about those bridges . 
  you completely trivialized what i wrote , misunderstood what i was saying , and obviously replaced any arguments i had with a `` playing the victim '' card . 
  you do not realize the vast scope of the anti-milosevic protests , you are not aware of the huge draft evasion that was active during the 90s , you have no idea about the dangers of being in the opposition until after 1999 . when milosevic 's forces were weakened and his ability to steal votes from kosovo albanians was hindered . 
  you seem to think that the first attempt to get rid of milosevic was the one in 2000 . 
  it was not . 
  50 years of communism with tito as a head-of-state with a cult of personality ... a well organized secret service and secret police force ... corrupt courts and state officials ... and you expect people born in this era to simply oust milosevic ? 
  milosevic was just one man , a whole system stood behind him . 
  after that system collapsed due to the lack of funds and major internal conflicts , only then could milosevic himself be toppled . 
  your attempts to make me seem like a kid crying for his toys and a few bridges are intellectually dishonest and probably stem from a personal level of hatred you are not willing to let go . 
  like i said - you completely ignored what i said and replaced my grief with yours . 
  i 'm not also comfortable in discussing anything with you as long as you utilize the terms like `` the serbian people '' when throwing accusations . 
  you make up your own facts , which are basically stereotypes , and then proceed to mock them to make yourself feel better . 
   most of the orthodox churches were even built by albanians and most local albanians know this very well . 
  this was not religious , it was purely ethnic from the albanian perspective . 
  i do n't buy this for one second . 
  accept the fact that those hooligans acted in the same manner like all 3 forces did in bosnia - burning churches , monasteries and mosques was common ... reprisal attacks against places of worship is standard in the balkans . 
  the comments here are freakin ' horrible . 
  '' , `` the serbs were asking for it ! '' ... 
  what would you like to do , exactly ? 
  lodge a bullet in the skull of every single man , woman and child in serbia ? 
  how many of you are jacking off to this idea right now ?
