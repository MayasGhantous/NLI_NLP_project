  my family in bosnia was being shot at during the 90s . 
  my cousin almost got picked by a serb sniper when going out to pick up some milk , he was just a kid !, 
  his sister got a metal shard stuck in her head . 
  their dad got killed later on during the bosnian wars by a mortar shell , probably a serbian one ... ironically , my other cousin got drafted in serbia to fight in bosnia . 
  got shot just after leaving the bus by a sniper , was dead on the spot . 
  my dad was almost drafted as well here in serbia , but he was in cd so he managed to squeeze through . 
  my family in croatia was in the middle of a crossfire in their village . 
  shells were coming down constantly , guns were a blazin ' ... my uncle 's son got shot one time in his arm , the other time in his chest . 
  barely lived , still lives in constant pain today . 
  plenty of their neighbors got killed before they could reach the basement in time to hide from the stray mortars . 
  i was just a scared kid running with my parents throughout nato 's intervention during 1999 . 
  as a 12 year old , i got `` the talk '' from my father about the possibility of him going away and me probably never seeing him again . 
  sleepless nights , going numb to the sound of air raid sirens , listening to jets flying over , looking at explosions from my balcony before running down to hide ... no electricity or running water ... trying to get some information from an old am radio ... not being able to contact anybody to see if they 're alright . 
  tanks were being dug in near my aunt 's farm . 
  i was just a kid though , so i had it alright . 
  my hungarian friend had to sleep in a ditch for months with his rifle , expecting an invasion which , thankfully , never came . 
  his army barracks got blasted away just after he had left it with his battalion ... 
  most of you here are armchair war analysts who talk in terms of `` croatia did that '' , `` serbia did this '' , `` bosnia did that '' ... well , newsflash !, 
  that 's not how this game is played !, 
  you are talking about entities consisting of millions of people , each with their own opinions and their own story !, 
  every single part of my family has suffered throughout these wars , and if any of you dipshits even think you can comprehend how this all went down , you might as well stop now because you have no clue , and at least have the common courtesy to shut up and give your respect to those who are now rotting away in the ground for no reason whatsoever , while the politicians got away with it yet again . 
  this is n't a disney movie , y' know , the one with a pretty princess and a wicked witch , nor is it a rambo movie where the gap between the baddies and the goodies is perfectly clear . 
  on this day i 'm very tired of hearing the same nationalistic bullshit over and over again , but it seems i ca n't escape such retarded behavior even here on reddit . 
  ** we could n't oust milosevic . 
  i was just a kid . 
  i killed nobody . 
  i did not deserve this , my family did n't deserve this !, 
  stop telling me i 'm responsible for a goddamn genocide !, 
  i just wanted to play my poorly made chinese nes ripoff , watch tmnt and have a normal childhood !, 
   you should have removed milosevich , you had plenty of chances . 
  yeah , that 's exactly what i wanted to do , but y' know ... police state , rigged elections , killing of journalists and `` enemies of the state '' , protest busting , extremely limited freedom of speech , state sponsored media , etc. 
  we barely did it on the 5th of october during the bulldozer revolution . 
  * those stupid north koreans , why do n't they just remove kim jong un , amirite ? 
  i 've been reading some comments on here and ... apparently none of you have any clue where novi sad even is . 
  novi sad 's bridges had tactical importance leveling that of a slingshot . 
   albania has beautiful , progressive laws . 
   but  albania does not enforce laws . 
  the main gripes the eu usually has with potential candidates , including mine - serbia . 
  a friend sent me this a few days ago ... he saw it on his fb feed from a slightly racist acquaintance , but nevertheless , it 's relevant : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6i87tkuz4k ( very nsfw ) this is not a justification , but i can see why some `` lists '' are being made . 
  plenty of these people are probably lacking proper documentation and do n't look like the cooperative-tolerant type . 
  i believe the title is in hungarian and is about norway , but my point is ... the romani people will continue to get a bad rap because of people depicted in the video , and tolerant societies like those in scandinavian lands will get their fuses tested to the limit . 
  edit : and i just saw in the video 's description that it 's from a hungarian white power website , so take it with a huge grain of salt . 
   smaller markets ( nl , dk , etc ) : the movies get subbed i ca n't stand dubbing . 
  in the balkans , [ only the cartoons get dubbed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybb45wz0xmm&amp;t=4m49s ) , so i 'm guessing it 's not * that * expensive . 
   / pol / if any poor soul lurks there for hours and eventually finds some lone coherent content , i doubt it will form their opinion . 
  it physically hurts to read / pol / . 
  the croatians neatly adopted `` raj\u010dica '' ( diminutive of `` heaven '' ... 
  do you really want us to not vote for you in the eurovision contest !, 
  just got home , i 'm going to write this and then i 'm going to bed ... you can claim you 're not justifying anything , but you are . 
  when presented with a wrongdoing such as this , and you 're immediately resorting to throwing causes and reasons for this at everybody without a hint of compassion - then it 's a clear case of justification , whether direct or indirect in it 's nature . 
  `` how humans are ; people get irrational when they are angry '' - are your words . 
  this sounds pretty much like justification to me . 
  you claim they have every right to be angry . 
  well , why are n't any cemeteries desecrated these days in croatia or serbia ? 
  i know plenty of people who 've lost their friends or family in this war ... mixed marriages exist in my family as well , so who 's gon na wreck who 's grave now ? 
  you sound like the serbs i 've seen here who , after presented with the facts from srebrenica , pretty quickly jump to justifying it or downplaying it by saying it was a bosnian muslim provocation ... well , whether that 's true or not , mladic did what he did and he was wrong when he did it , no matter the reasons behind it . 
  the way you refer to these old folks in the pictures as serbs immediately and start justifying the reasons why they are standing in front of a pile of wrecked marble is nationalistic in nature . 
  they are just some old geezers who are visiting their deceased loved ones and are n't looking to stir up any trouble . 
  the way you feel about us being completely responsible for what happened in kosovo is nationalistic in nature . 
  `` the serbs did it '' is not really a proper term for this . 
  like i said before , you really like to act like you 're the only victim of the dissolution of yugoslavia . 
  you seem to think that we were sipping cheap beer over here up north while we sent some special forces down there in your homes , well think again . 
  i 've lost family members , i 've seen plenty of my family disappear in the diaspora because of milosevic and his crap ... we could n't vote him out , he had all the strings in his hands and he had the tv stations . 
  my family , friends and neighbors were drafted to fight in wars they did n't support , hungarians , serbs and croats alike . 
  we were starved , we were kicked around and we were dictated to by those in power . 
  you had it no worse than my family did in croatia and bosnia , i assure you , even though it 's not ( and should n't be ) a contest . 
  as for the churches , i 'm assuming there are n't many left to be burnt . 
  the population of serbs in kosovo has dwindled to minuscule percentages . 
  some think peace has come to kosovo , but i think it 's just the fact that there is n't anybody left for kosovar nationalists to have conflicts with , other than the few tombstones they have on their disposal to have skirmishes with on occasions . 
  whatever you may say , in vojvodina we have peace & tolerance levels up the wazoo . 
  serbs , bosniaks and the croats have been in war for a long time , so have albanians , and we 've had conflicts with montenegrins too . 
  and yet , lo and behold , we all live together without any major conflicts . 
  no ethnically motivated attacks as standard , no religious conflicts , no desecration of religious structures or grave sites . 
  hell , we even have a state regional tv station that broadcats in over 10 languages , some of which include [ serbian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo0iwhlaatc ) , [ hungarian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziddg1acfvs ) , [ romani ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=harpyrcvh3s ) , [ romanian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvjnwcdewbk ) , [ rusynian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uix4p8267u ) , [ slovakian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olrcgjntcve ) , [ croatian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8mvycxcqxw ) , etc. 
  and we 're pretty proud of that . 
  many of your countrymen could learn from this and maybe they could find a way to separate the state/government from the people . 
  the graveyard which has been bombed and subsequently repaired somewhat was the one in pristina , not in mitrovica , as stated in the news article . 
  the graveyard in mitrovica has been constantly targeted for years and every year it 's in more ruins . 
  every year when these people are allowed a police escort to come down find that there is even more damage done to the tombstones and surrounding areas . 
  this did not happen overnight , but it accumulates for a full year ... and when visitors come by , they are met with a sharp blow - which is worse because it 's obviously not a deed done by a few vandals in a drunken fit of rage , it 's done `` casually '' and on a regular basis . 
  this was the case in pristina as well until recently , but somebody decided to be smart about it and made repairs to the tombstones , pathways and the chapel , and improved security . 
  the main issue is that it 's very difficult for families , other relatives and friends to come down and tend to those graves themselves . 
  they are intimidated and are justifiably scared to visit . 
  being scared to visit the grave site of one 's family member is not what one would expect in an european country . 
  tl ; dr : the title of the article says `` ponovo oskrnavljeni spomenici u km '' ( `` tombstones in mitrovica have been desecrated ** again ** '' ), 
   okay , so you think it 's more decent to preserve cemeteries than people 's life no , i do n't . 
  i have no idea how did you come up with that conclusion . 
  i have n't even begun to imply such a thing . 
   how hard is it rebuild some fucking tombstones ? 
  obviously pretty damn hard , since they ca n't move around [ without getting stoned ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/several-serbs-injured-in-attack-in-kosovo ) , and that cemetery is obviously a go-to station for nationalistic vandalism . 
  it 's not about the damn tombstones , it 's about basic principles and freedoms . 
  the leaders in pristina claim they 're working their way towards the eu , nato , whatnot and are presenting themselves as a westernized nation worthy of european values ... and yet they breathe in an atmosphere where this kind of behavior is acceptable , whitewashed and justified . 
  i 'm failing to comprehend what is it you 're trying to state here . 
  but , but , ** the serbs ** !, 
  there is no justification for shit like this . 
  you ca n't justify a wrongdoing with another wrongdoing . 
  not only that , but you ca n't point the finger at some old geezers and tell them `` fuck your loved ones and fuck your tombstones , this is payback for what you did to us '' . 
  serbs have burned their fair share of mosques and have gotten some of their fair share of churches burned , this does n't make any of this okay . 
  i 'm the first to stand up and give the finger to mladic , karadzic and any other smug airhead who thinks ethnic cleansing is fun . 
  however , in vojvodina , for example , no mosques , churches , synagogues were fucked over even during the war , even though many could find a `` justification '' like you did .
