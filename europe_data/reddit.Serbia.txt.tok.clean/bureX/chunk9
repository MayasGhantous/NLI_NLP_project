  anyway , after the wars came to a halt , all of that stopped . 
  most of those church/mosque burnings were done during the war . 
  the war in kosovo is long over , there are n't almost any serbs left , kosovo has `` eu aspirations '' and yet that did n't stop vandals from destroying tons of churches and monasteries in kosovo : http://imgur.com/a/acwkm there are barely any serbs left down there , why are n't things subsiding ? 
  why is hatred like this still rampant ? 
  i just bought some burek from a kosovar albanian bakery and i could n't care less . 
  i was born and i live in serbia , and my family in croatia has been shot at by serbian forces . 
  am i crazy ? 
  or am i just not buying into a nationalistic way of thinking like you are ? 
  being an ethnic croat myself , i do n't see many serbian cemeteries being desecrated in croatia , nor croatian ( catholic , actually ) cemeteries being desecrated in serbia . 
  we also have plenty of albanian names in our local cemetery , and nobody ever thought to lay a finger on them . 
  a few tombstones got knocked down in a jewish cemetery a year ago , and everybody lost their shit until the culprits ( a couple of drunk kids ) were found . 
  the only time our cemeteries are under attack is when petty thieves break in to steal metal objects for scrap . 
  this is why i 'm having a hard time buying any justifications from mendi926 . 
  i also like the fact that he 's acting as if none of us balkan dwellers have seen the effects war in our own backyard . 
  there is no justification for disturbing the dead , and i say that even though i 'm not religious . 
  there needs to be at least some level of common decency and respect in this regard . 
  these people ca n't even visit these graves without a police escort , which is beyond disgusting . 
  i do n't know what 's worse , the witch hunt or the fact that they were * right * about the girl not being legally adopted . 
  the fact remains : you ca n't just `` swap '' children around when you feel like it , there has to be a proper adoption procedure and child protection laws have to be followed . 
  this incident has fueled a bit of neonazi strays in serbia , and there has been one attack on a romani family in novi sad where two ( alleged ) skinheads stopped a father with his daughter on the street , accusing him of stealing a `` white kid '' . 
  the father threatened to call the police so they ran off ... 
  i 'm assuming this was more intimidation than anything else , but it 's interesting how stuff like this can lure out certain emptyheaded fanatics out of the woodworks . 
  it was n't my intention to be misleading in any way , but i have to refrain from posting a direct news story because it 's in a non-english language . 
  new submission : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1pr90n/more_than_97_of_orthodox_christian_tombstones/, 
  http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2013&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=02&amp;nav_category=640&amp;nav_id=772734 ( it 's in serbian , ca n't find a suitable article in english ) . 
  the nothern part of mitrovica is inhabited by serbs , while the southern part is inhabited mostly by albanians . 
  the pictures show a graveyard with mostly serbian orthodox christians buried there . 
  today is `` zadu\u0161nice '' , according to the orthodox christian calendar , so people traditionally visit their deceased loved ones and take some time to tend to their family members ' or friends ' gravesites . 
  these folks , however , have to be escorted by security forces to the south , only so they could see that most tombstones have been desecrated and stomped in the ground by various hooligans . 
  the previous submission was labeled as `` non-neutral '' , so here it is again with the basically same title and a few extra words , no astroturfing intended , just showing the consequences of rampant nationalism . 
  i 'm not sure i understand . 
  mitrovica is a small town , and i 'm pretty sure that 's the only serbian cemetery in that area : https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d2099!2d20.8829322!3d42.8906178!2m1!1e3&amp;fid=7, 
  the very fact that you 're trying to rationalize and indirectly justify such actions is proof enough that shit like this will happen in the future . 
  there are some pretty old graves there ... when have those deceased ever done harm to anybody ? 
  or maybe this is some weird plot to erase other people 's legacies ? 
  like i said : dumb nationalism . 
  nationalism , spite , lack of respect and common decency . 
  this is not a big news story , just a blurb from here : http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2013&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=02&amp;nav_category=640&amp;nav_id=772734 ( it 's in serbian , but i think the pictures say a lot for themselves ) . 
  the nothern part of mitrovica is inhabited by serbs , while the southern part is inhabited mostly by albanians . 
  the pictures show a graveyard with mostly serbian orthodox christians buried there . 
  today is `` zadu\u0161nice '' , according to the orthodox christian calendar , so people traditionally visit their deceased loved ones and take some time to tend to their family members ' or friends ' gravesites . 
  these folks , however , have to be escorted by security forces to the south , only so they could see that most tombstones have been desecrated and stomped in the ground by various hooligans . 
  in the northern part of mitrovica , there is also a cemetery . 
  it is even host to plenty of muslim graves , but the townspeople claim there have been no attacks or vandalism from any side and most religious ceremonies are done safely without any interference . 
  yup , even the dead are n't spared from dumb nationalism . 
  whatever you believe or whichever end of the political spectrum you may inhabit , this kind of behavior is just disgusting . 
  you called ? 
   and i think is almost the same as croatian it is , even though plenty of people will take every chance to say that 's not the case . 
  it 's sometimes referred to as [ `` bcs '' ( bosnian , croatian , serbian ) ] ( http://www.amazon.com/bosnian-croatian-serbian-textbook-exercises/dp/0299236544/ref=sr_1_3?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1373034122&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=learn+serbian ) . 
   they were at war with us and that did n't end so well for them as if it went well for anybody , ffs ... 
  for some reason , i read this as `` expect us '' . 
  ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ watching ^ ^ ^ you ... 
  * according to a survey conducted in 2011 , about 2.000.000 people in serbia have regular access to the internet . 
  99 % of businesses and 62 % of households have internet access . 
  an interesting statistic is that as high as 99.5 % of students in serbia regularly use internet . 
  * dial-up ( pstn and isdn ) : 6,2 % mobile access ( 3g , hdspa ) : 26,1 % cable internet : 35,6 % ( a ) dsl : 32,1 % * http://www.reddit.com/r/serbia/comments/1hcxhw/s_obzirom_na_procenat_korisnika_interneta_u/, 
  even in southern europe , winter is usually < 0c , with cold bursts of -15 c occasionally . 
  gib gastarbeiter papers, 
   smaller border crossings were not , but as far as i know only vehicles registered in serbia could go through those . 
  nope , those border crossings are open until 19h , and can be used by eu+eea passport holders and serbian passport holders . 
  lol ... 
  it 's typical , though ; quite similar things are done in serbia by right wing parties . 
  it 's their way of grabbing a few stray votes by people who do n't know any better . 
  how did they find out about his job application in the first place ? 
  oh good , now we 're down to 16 % ...  half are kosovars , syrians or afghans kosovo ? 
  for fuck 's sake ... 
  still ? 
  a few years ago they were going to war to establish their own country , and they 're still leaving it en masse ? 
  come on ... 
   there are 5-10 greater albanian flags now being waived amongst the crowd of men and they are yelling ( chanting ? ), 
  things i can not understand . 
  what the hell ... where do these people even come from ? 
  what were they there for ? 
   dude , they lost everything . 
  does n't have to be so . 
  not saying it ca n't be true , but there are plenty of those who left to avoid being drafted , jobless and whatnot .

  `` low quality content '' i was in hungary yesterday and i just about missed the conflicts on the border . 
  if this is considered low quality to you , then i guess you 've got other moderation issues which need addressing ... 
  yeah yeah , you can go all `` remove kebab '' and whatnot ... but it 's not all black and white . 
  even the most ultranationalistic nutjobs in the 90s had no issues with muslims , but with `` turkish traitors '' ( aka bosnian muslims , muslims from the sandzak region of serbia , and albanians who wanted autonomy/independence ... also croats ) . 
  take , for example , vojislav seselj - the nutjob of all nutjobs , who 's party held tons of parliamentary seats in serbia . 
  the man writes books like `` the whore from the hague - carla del ponte '' ... he 's smart , but he 's nuts . 
  and yet , he was full of praise for saddam [ hussein , assad and gadaffi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnr7bjjwmue ) . 
  he even wrote a book about hussein , and has made friends with him : http://i.imgur.com/6fcz88p.jpg yup , that 's one of the greatest `` kebab removers '' you 're looking at on the left !, 
  the former yugoslavia was great friends with plenty of muslim countries , and many students from libya , palestine , syria etc. 
  came to belgrade to study . 
   serbian authorities will keep bussing migrants i do n't know what you 've heard , but we do n't bus anyone around . 
  the migrants have freedom of movement in our country , because even if they are caught , they 'll seek asylum and we ca n't lock them up anywhere legally . 
  they board in regular bus lines and arrive at the border , it 's not like our authorities are doing so . 
  in fact , * the hungarian authorities * have sent buses for the migrants on their way to austria , while we have n't done anything similar . 
  what i would n't give to see them deported back to their home country ... just to see how much longer their patriotism lasts . 
  what 's wrong with serbia you little shits !? 
  are we not good enough for you !? 
  is that what people usually expect when coming to the uk ? 
  free housing ? 
  sink ships !? 
  what the hell is he smoking ? 
  do what australia does : https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/is-the-australian-navy-turning-back-asylum-seeker-boats tow them back .
