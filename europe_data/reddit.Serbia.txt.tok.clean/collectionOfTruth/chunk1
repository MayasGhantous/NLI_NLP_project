here 's [ another ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq_j2c6hrz0 ) one . 
  i think it 's because of the whole serbian uprising and ottoman empire that gives the idea , but that was centuries ago . 
  i 'm not sure about that , but i think the whole anti-american sentiment has been blown out of proportion . 
  it 's still present because of the nato bombing , but no one will bat an eye if you 're an american and walking through belgrade , for example . 
  it 's more the american government people have a problem with , than the american people . 
  serbia : we do n't hate muslims and we do n't play accordion every single day , more like every other day . 
  through law and not through murder . 
  i 'm pretty shocked by some of the comments in this thread , really . 
  people seem to be forgetting we are talking about a human life here . 
  he probably wrote that from prison while cutting garlic with a razorblade . 
   now , i do realise that our pm wanted to force serbia to spread out the refugees well , about [ that ] ( http://www.blic.rs/data/files/2015-09-24/11712_blicstrip2498cmyk.jpg ) ... 
  not until he called us barbarians for one final time . 
  people are blowing it out of proportion . 
  itt : bunch of people going at each other 's throats over a flag . 
  russian version [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pu0e0czzug ) . 
  yeah , pretty much . 
  most websites here are filled with comments written by people hired by the government to praise their actions , and they downvote everything down to the ground which even slightly critiques them . 
  i agree about the border nonsense , it 's quite shameful . 
  it 's in republika srpska entity of bosnia and herzegovina , so he is n't completely wrong . 
  well , b92 is n't as bad as some other newspapers here , tbh . 
  it 's also one of the rare ones which posts in english . 
  that 's nice , they will learn how to say `` der mann trinkt das wasser '' ... 
  hahahaha yeah it 's awful, 
  yeah , my dad is one ... 
  what are we meant to do instead ? 
  close borders and hope mother merkel looks the other way ? 
   yugoslavia was the crowning achievement of balkan politics that we were one large country , yes ... but we did n't get anything out of it . 
  move out from the balkans i guess . 
  that 's the thing , balkans need new politicians . 
  it 's the same people being elected over and over again . 
  at least we make fun of our politician . 
  :d https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eqdmvtplro, 
  i do n't know how much this will impact it , but it will be sad if it does since this is the first year we marked a positive growth in a long time ...

  absolutely beautiful . 
  i wish europe would continue building things which fit quite nicely with the rest of the cities , instead of more skyscrapers . 
  or is it perhaps , one of those things which is swept away with time ? 
  i do n't think it 's very relevant about the time difference between the two , although i can see how that could make one think differently . 
  i wonder how will the future generations look back on hitler . 
  what i meant more was that i believe they should n't be mentioned together and compared , simply because of hitler 's twisted views and ideals . 
  i do n't think it 's fair to compare hitler with napoleon . 
  napoleon was a general who fought for his country , whereas hitler although did the same , his killings were focused on exterminating a certain group of people , which to me at least is alone not to compare the two . 
  if hitler had won , my people would n't exist today . 
  damn straight !, 
  all of us had our own empires before the ottomans , and then people wonder how the balkans are so messed up in modern times , as if centuries spent under ottoman 's harsh rule and then years spent through awful communism never happened . 
  excuse i see often being written here is that the christians in the balkans could rise up high in the sultan 's army when the children 's parents were forced to otherwise pay the blood tax , as if that justifies centuries spent under their ruthless occupation !,

  nice to see that some people on this sub still understand how harsh and ruthless the ottomans were !, 
  i was getting quite tired of seeing people here praising them and calling them `` understanding '' . 
  they were some of the worst colonizers . 
  good !, 
  ottoman empire was the worst plague which happened to the balkans . 
  that wo n't work out very well ... 
  it 's russian , they annexed it . 
  should have they done it ? 
  of course not . 
  but it 's what happened , and we are fooling ourselves thinking that it 's ever becoming ukraine 's territory again . 
  i think it was the one before the last one . 
  yeah , he could have just written balkans instead of every country separately . 
  let 's do this shit !, 
  second , actually . 
  we managed to hold it fine last year , but this is the first time there was a `` double '' parade , which entailed both , transexual and gay people . 
  as someone wanting to move , reading that is quite disheartening . 
  balkans are pretty much the same . 
  yeah , i know the feeling . 
  i thought about unflairing for a while to see if there would be any difference , but i doubt there would be any since people can just check the post history . 
  i agree as well , being on this subreddit and on the internet in general , made me care a lot less about personal attacks . 
  it was , and it still is . 
  i do n't see any problems with discussing immigration as it 's the hot issue of europe , but the problem is the group of people it attracts . 
  seven comments in this thread and all they 've done is prove the mod 's point further . 
  former will do nicely after last night . 
  that 's the problem though . 
  it was n't necessary to phrase it in such an awful way , especially since we are neighbors . 
  i was really disappointed how we played considering we were undefeated until now , but still i got to hand it to you lithuania , you played very very well . 
  grats for the deserved win . 
  no idea . 
  i was confused because i did n't know that :  most eu countries agree with germany it makes sense then . 
   milanovi\u0107 said `` an eagle does n't catch flies . 
  we are the eagle . ' '', 
  completely unnecessary . 
   how is croatia better ? 
  well , when it comes to living in , croatia is in the eu and croats generally make much more money than we do . 
  politics wise , i do n't know much about croatia to comment if they are better , the same , or worse than our current government . 
  for what it 's worth , i 'm with you on this one . 
  people who are defending the comment saying immigrants should walk into the landmines are just as bad as the person who posted it . 
  i 'm confused by this as well . 
  it 's just good old balkan competitiveness , all in good spirits . 
  solves it for the individual . 
  he has one life , why would he waste it by getting shot somewhere instead of searching to live somewhere better ? 
  i honestly do n't see any issue with hungarian policemen in serbia . 
  world wars were a long time ago , after all . 
  there are already a lot of hungarians living here , and there are n't any problems . 
  our government ? 
  half of the population ? 
  except balkans are european just like the rest , and nobody would kill and get everything paid for . 
  people who are born and grow up here . 
  europe should spend a few millions on buying everyone a ticket to the us . 
  difference being though , is that you and other countries are already in the eu , whereas serbia is still trying to join , which entails listening to germany and what merkel has to say . 
  yeah idgi , i 've been reading often during these past few days how people think the balkans and eastern europe in general is racist as hell , but that 's really not the case .
