  if anything , i think we are much less racist than our western neighbours . 
  we can split macedonia . 
  good luck to everyone !, 
  first we were siberia , now we are syria - what 's next ? 
  serbia ? 
  praise the sun !, 
  how do you not know that as an european though ? 
  i think you 're not the first brit i met which ca n't locate many countries on the map . 
  i think they would have settled in the ottoman empire . 
  brb moving to bucharest, 
  if we were yugoslavia , they would have one clear pass into austria and germany . 
  nice , so not much would change . 
  does this mean the land where bulgaria used to be is now free ? 
  does this mean ... that there is a chance for serbia getting sea ? 
  watching with great interest . 
  we are trying to join the eu , doing the opposite of what eu wants is no go . 
  thanks for the advice !, 
  i think what made me most upset about duolingo is the lack of typing in the target language you are learning . 
  most practice i had on the website was 80 % spent translating and typing in english , compared to german . 
  i do like the grammar notes they have though , they are excellent . 
  i 'll give the resources a shot , thanks again . 
  i think i 'll stick with memrise for now and get a grammar book or something . 
  i tried studying with duolingo a while ago , but i did n't find it to be that useful . 
  after those a1/a2 courses , i 'll probably do the 5000 words one and start reading books in german .

  did you finish the course ( s ) ? 
  if you did , how much did they help you in the end ? 
  he takes their home address instead . 
  how are we pushing anyone to a different country ? 
  these people are simply passing through serbia towards germany . 
  we are n't pushing anyone , and by this you most likely are thinking that we are doing nothing to stop them . 
  you are of course right , but we do so not because of spite towards hungary or whatever , but because we are following the official politics of the eu , that is germany 's which so far has been welcoming towards the refugees . 
  until we 've been told to do otherwise , as a candidate country we see no alternative . 
  uk is probably the most [ gay-friendly ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article9375623.ece/binary/original/rainbow-map.jpg ) country in europe , you will be fine . 
  i would n't be that concerned about middle eastern refugees . 
  they are moving to another continent and it 's expected of them to assimilate . 
  uk is looking towards leaving the eu anyway , so i doubt they will be taking many of those refugees as they are surrounded by water as well . 
  czech and poland because they are slavic and beautiful . 
  germany and france because they are rich and beautiful .

  not visiting one historically important and culturally rich country with many sights to see and experience , solely because of the language seems like a weak reason . 
  dominant international language can always change . 
  i see nothing wrong with the french taking pride in their language and culture . 
  europe after all , is one large continent with all kinds of different languages and cultures . 
  with translators existing , i see no reason why one should feel forced to speak a specific language . 
  there 's an idea for papers please dlc . 
  finland is taken care of , now it 's your turn czech !, 
  did n't expect croatia to lose . 
  yes , because one random serbian dude who posts on the internet is a clear representation of a country which consists of millions of people . 
  this subreddit went from `` refugee crisis is bad '' to `` everyone who is n't white is bad '' fairly quickly . 
  this was printed * during * the war , i think . 
  regardless , having a moment of triumph during a shitstorm is something worth remembering . 
  it 's not about deaths but more that a stealth aircraft was successfully shot down ... and then some of the parts were sent to russia and china in order for them to develop anti-stealth technologies . 
  another interesting thing is that the pilot and the guy that shot him , have developed a friendship later on . 
   zolt\u00e1n dani , now running a bakery , and dale zelko , now retired from the us air force , have met and developed a friendship in recent years . 
  `` we will fuck nato , my bro ! '', 
  it rhymes when it 's not written in english .

  serbia : [ ** underground ** ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114787/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) ( 1995 )  the story follows an underground weapons manufacturer in belgrade during wwii and evolves into fairly surreal situations . 
  a black marketeer who smuggles the weapons to partisans does n't mention to the workers that the war is over , and they keep producing . 
  years later , they break out of their underground `` shelter '' -- only to convince themselves that the war is still going on . 
  [ ** pretty village , pretty flame ** ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116860/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl ) ( 1996 )  at the belgrade army hospital , casualties of bosnian civil war are treated . 
  in the hospital they remember their youth and the war . 
  two young boys , halil , a muslim , and milan , a serb , have grown up together near a deserted tunnel linking the yugoslav cities of belgrade and zagreb . 
  they never dare go inside , as they believe an ogre resides there . 
  twelve years later , during the bosnian civil war , milan , who is trapped in the tunnel with his troop , and halil , find themselves on opposing sides , fatefully heading toward confrontation . 
  what do you think we listen to when we head to bed ? 
  oh nice , nothing like a strong breakfast to start your day . 
  i 'm known as a wurst guy myself , as i had cevapi for breakfast while playing the accordion .

  i 'll see you in the finals , my dear garcon !, 
  what do the spaniards think of catalans wanting independance ? 
  `` stuck '' ... 
  a likely story ... 
  you forgot the part where someone from germany or northern europe comes up and writes `` oh just balkan things '' . 
  well , it 's kind of expected of us to follow germany 's politics when we are trying to join the eu .

  maybe , though i would n't say living in turkey would be bad . 
  you know better about this than me , though . 
  - checks flair - :d, 
  you would n't do that to a fellow yugo . 
  phew , at least we avoided the red line of shame . 
  what do you consider under `` the truth about refugees '' ? 
  most serbs from kosovo that i 've met have been kind of weird . 
  europe should help as much as possible . 
  however , of course it 's not as simple as that . 
  economic migrants are happening together with these refugee waves , but that 's not even the concerning thing for me . 
  what 's the biggest concern for me is that isis can easily mask people as refugees and suddenly surprise europe with a large scale attack . 
  because of these migrant waves and the way media is handling them , a lot of people are losing their minds and thinking in different ways . 
  if such an attack orchestrated by isis does happen , then riots would most likely break out shortly after . 
  czech , poland , france , austria , or germany . 
  looks like you were right . 
  lol sputniknews, 
  yup , most people i know are pro-eu , and i am too . 
  as you said , it all depends on where you live and the people you hang out with . 
  looking forward today for serbia vs turkey . 
  if we lose , i 'll use turkish flair for a week . 
  of course it was .
