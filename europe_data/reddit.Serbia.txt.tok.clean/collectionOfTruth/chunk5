  i meant the wall hungary built on the borders with serbia in an attempt to stop the flow of immigrants taking the route towards other eu countries . 
  cocteau 's `` beauty and the beast '' sounds like something i would love , thanks for the recommendation !, 
  i 've seen la cit\u00e9 des enfants perdus a few days ago which i loved , and i was going to see delicatessen next , but i 'll make way for beauty and the beast to be next !, 
  i think the whole look on it will keep on changing as more and more people keep on coming . 
  positively , i believe !, 
  from what i gathered through reading most comments on websites and speaking with people , they seem to be supporting orban 's decision to raise the fence , going as far as saying that we should do the same thing with kosovo and macedonia . 
  others feel the complete opposite , so i guess it 's kind of split with more going towards the first opinion . 
  i planned to watch this film when i was on my german cinema binge watch , but never got around to it in the end . 
  instead , i 've been watching french films lately which have been pretty entertaining , and there are so many of them . 
  hungarians and montenegrins , i believe . 
  hungarians are mostly in vojvodina and montenegrins are in belgrade . 
  does n't merci mean thank you ? 
  so i suppose the literal translation would be , thank you for using the megathread ? 
  [ migrants fight `` with knives '' to get on train to serbia ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=08&amp;dd=14&amp;nav_id=95103 ), 
  but but eu told us not to profit off this . 
  catalonia ? 
  it 's possible , like romania and bulgaria both joined at the same time . 
   united states of europe hopefully not with that name ... simply `` european union '' , or `` european federation '' sounds much better imo . 
   turkey ha ha ha . 
  i believe iceland canceled its candidature , so the next one to join will be either montenegro or serbia . 
  never thought a day would come when soviet and nazi crimes would be treated as equally bad . 
  fluctuating . 
  there are times when people are in support of the eu and serbia 's path towards it , and then there are completely opposite times when the people are against it . 
  for an example , today in the newspaper people have read about the possibility of germany re-adding visa requirements to serbia because of the massive amount of immigrants coming from the country . 
  then there were also talks of how serbia should build a massive migrant center which would hold about 400,000 immigrants . 
  it sounds as if serbia should hold all the immigrants away from the rest of europe , and that 's something which the average citizen is n't in support of . 
  it shows you how the eu treats its candidate states , which is n't well at all . 
  oh , not at all . 
  i do n't see kosovo ever becoming a part of serbia again , considering how little serbs actually live there anymore . 
  rs getting independence is much higher than kosovo reuniting , but then again the chances of kosovo 's reunion with serbia is close to zero . 
  difference is , and i noticed this mostly lately , is that the majority of those posts are made by either new accounts or flairless posters . 
  whenever you mention this subreddit being brigaded by racists , you end up being downvoted to hell . 
   i would use the kosovo independence as the excuse to get the rs ( like majority of the serbs ) . 
  that would n't happen in a million years though . 
  i doubt the croats and bosniaks would look nicely towards rs becoming a part of serbia . 
  however , i do n't even know the possible outcome for the future of rs anymore . 
  dodik is promising referendums , but will they really ever happen , and will even they be accepted ? 
  i should stop reading blic then . 
  out of curiosity , how would you solve the kosovo problem ? 
  so what ? 
  that does n't change the fact that the newspapers here often blow things out of proportion with their click bait headlines . 
  there are two types of serbian readers : those who keep an open mind and do n't buy into everything the newspapers are selling , and those who blindly swallow everything printed . 
  about the article however , kosovo has been nothing but pain in our backs for the past twenty years . 
  i believe that splitting it between albania and serbia would be the best outcome , but that will never happen . 
  siberia . 
  * scrolls * `` so far so good ... 
  in belgrade , i always loved that the [ ** prince mihailo monument ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince_mihailo_monument ) in republic square is pointing towards constantinople , showing the way for the turks to leave . 
  because we need another country in the balkans , right ? 
  how harsh are the tensions between albanians and macedonians anyway ? 
  do n't let your dreams be dreams . 
  i do n't think they read any books at all . 
  because people from the balkans are mostly migrating to germany . 
  magical . 
  * than . 
  ** example : serbia is better in water polo ** than ** croatia . 
  after winning the match , serbia got drunk and ** then ** removed some kebab . 
  we 're really on fire this year . 
  great year for sports . 
  [ belgrade ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flkxsgxnl8w ), 
  a president 's young son from a fellow european nation passed away . 
  it might not be important news to some , but i do think it 's quite noteworthy and far from being `` propaganda '' and i 'm still baffled in which way you see this being portrayed in such light . 
  you are also overestimating the `` development and intelligence of this sub '' - as if this sub is meant to be some serious , holy ground for political debates , instead of a place for europeans to feel united and share their opinions , their griefs . 
  no one is being manipulated , people are simply sharing their condolences , and there is nothing wrong with doing that . 
  serbia opens the negotiation chapters . 
  how he 's the prime minister of our country is a mystery to me . 
  i am not going to deny that russia does hold a considerable amount of support with serbs , but you also have to understand the reasoning behind that . 
  russia and serbia both share tight history , and the people strongly remember russia 's defense of serbia from the first world war . 
  not only that , but the whole reasoning behind the `` western imperialism '' you 've came across being very popular among the serbs you 've talked to is mostly due to the breakup of yugoslavia . 
  the bombings of serbia made a lot of citizens hold the west in bad light , compared to other nations such as russia or greece . 
  holding the parade in front of putin was a bad decision , as i ultimately think that the current government 's plan of sitting on both chairs is being a destructive way to lead politics . 
  however , what i wish to say is , that in modern times i believe serbia is quite far from being a russia 's lapdog , especially with the current , active government which is for the first time being heavily eu oriented . 
  so that makes my country russia 's lapdog ? 
  i guess countries are n't allowed to have allies - or perhaps better said , they are allowed to have allies as long as those allies are not russians . 
  especially considering today your statement is quite ridiculous , considering serbia is pursuing closer ties with the west and membership to the eu . 
  oh please !, 
   4 ) ** russian ** ( if you want to work in russia/baltics / ** balkans ** / belarus ) huh ? 
  [ migrants cut through hungary 's border fence ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=08&amp;dd=07&amp;nav_id=95025 ), 
  so ... how 's the film ? 
  wow , i knew there were tensions between romanians and hungarians , but i never guessed they were on that level . 
  although , i suppose it 's still a small number of people who do chant such things , how would you say the relationship between the two people are in general ? 
  there would be one man speaking french and everyone giving him weird looks while nodding their heads , making him think everyone understands what he 's saying . 
  there 's no doubt that we are all related , but calling everyone from ex-yugoslavia traitor serbs does n't help the relationship between our nations at all . 
  i think you mean bosniaks during ottoman period . 
   if russia backs us up this time around , oh boi you will be fucked for 70 years of shit that nobody have to understand or you to aknowledge or admit it . 
  ehh ??? 
  backs us up on what ? 
   if these idiots get on power it will be one of saddest day for croatia . 
  what are the chances of that happening though ? 
   tl ; dr : been to the balkans , got back alive !, 
  that 's the thing , though . 
  many people imagine the balkans to be this war-torn part of europe , but the fact is that all balkan countries are incredibly beautiful and cheap to visit . 
  croatia especially is famous for its tourism . 
  albania also has a lot of tourism potential , and it 's quite cheap to visit too . 
  there is , but the politicians are still being petty and scoring points by berating the neighbouring countries . 
  neither have i , and i also have no reason to . 
  i 'm a young person , i was n't involved in the war and i have no reason to hate any country . 
  it 's kind of sad since those same power-hungry idiots who are spreading hate are having children , and raising them to be hateful just like they are . 
  but eventually , i believe , as younger generations flourish , the whole hatred between nations will fade away with time . 
  it 's sad since it just keeps on diminishing the chances for peace in the region . 
  i guess that ultimately , the only chance for peace in the balkans is for the older generations to be gone , as harsh as it sounds .
