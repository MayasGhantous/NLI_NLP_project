  he probably has a basement full of them . 
  it 's embarrassing , it would be for the best if he was arrested . 
  well , not everyone knows english very well , so reading the comments in their language would help - which i guess , is n't a very big number since most posters do know english on this website . 
  i suppose it helps people like me who are learning another foreign language . 
  i do agree that it should be posted in english first though . 
  how ? 
  one of them is in english . 
   i ca n't wait to leave the shithole and to live in a civilized country without hatred , nationalism and propaganda . 
  that makes two of us ... 
  thank you for taking your time to write back to me , i truly appreciate it . 
  although i was aware that catalonia 's culture is different from spain 's , i 've never imagined it to be very drastically different , but more somewhere similar to how balkan states share their culture , or the scandinavians . 
  i was also unaware of the treatment catalonia is receiving from madrid , although i also see why they are so strongly against your independence , considering how much money you bring to them through tourism . 
  barcelona after all , is one of the most beautiful cities in europe . 
  i always hear about catalonia 's independence , but i 've never understood the reasoning why . 
  is it mainly because you believe that you would be better off without the rest of spain , or is there more to it ? 
  we had the coolest flag ... 
  french grammar . 
   the mods of r/europe are n't european so they have a vested interest in banning comments like this . 
  elaborate , please . 
  why did n't you send a pm to one of the moderators ? 
  these witch-hunt threads aimed at mods are getting tiresome . 
   lol you mention that guy all the time . 
  hahaha , i just checked his post history , he really does mention him all the time . 
  haha yeah right , like i am going to believe snoop dogg would do something like this !, 
  it was a peaceful parade , and i believe the first one to actually finish without any violence . 
  of course , together with a lot of police patrolling the streets , but still . 
  out of curiosity , how hard is the process ?

  if you do his idea , will you bless me with an austrian citizenship ? 
  run . 
  ww1 is the first thing which comes to my mind when it comes to serbia-russia relations . 
  other than that , shared culture and history mostly . 
  you being downvoted , and suggestions of / r/european as a good alternative to this subreddit being upvoted , only further proves your point . 
  ~ ~ careful , you do n't want to end up like that [ facebook guy ] ( http://www.blic.rs/vesti/hronika/573940/aleksincanin-uhapsen-jer-je-vredjao-vucica ) ... ~ ~ what facebook guy would have the courage to insult his magnificence ? 
  it 's good , yes . 
  i do n't think it 's political trickery , since we 've grown [ 0.5 % ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_serbia ) this year so far already . 
  if napoleon had actually won the war , how would you imagine europe to look like today ? 
  although putin 's politics are often questionable , i believe he is right when he says that europe should n't be dependent on the us as much as it is .

  yes , pretty much . 
  this subreddit became a nest for people who enjoy slamming their keyboards at every chance they get to spit over immigrants , muslims , the swiss , greeks , and russians . 
  edit : i also forgot the need to bash the moderators of this sub at every chance they get with no reason whatsoever . 
  it 's equivalent to ** \u0107 ** . 
  i 'd consider moving to denmark , but learning danish seems like an impossible task . 
  speaking part of it , anyway . 
   `` serbia lately made a series of incomprehensible moves , exerting pressure in the european union to settle the ( macedonian ) name issue . '', 
   according to this , athens is also troubled by `` information about the alleged pressure on greece to recognize kosovo . '', 
   the article said that `` due to recent provocative moves of belgrade related to kosovo and the fyrom ( former yugoslav republic of macedonian ) name issue , athens has already lodged official protests . '', 
   the greek foreign ministry officials `` pointed out with dissatisfaction that athens has for seven years supported serbia 's candidacy for eu membership , while belgrade was quick to recognize fyrom based on narrow interests . '', 
  it 's all because franz ferdinand got lost in the slovenian mountains . 
  then he come across a bunch of sheep and a slovenian disguised as one of them , but before he managed to bite into his sandwich , the sheep shot him out of nowhere . 
  it was a wild sheep chase , really . 
  some say that it was a sheep which possessed gavrilo princip all along . 
  it 's always slovenia stirring things up in the balkans !, 
  give us a break , guys !, 
  do n't worry my romanian friend , we shall hold a great feast in craiova to celebrate !, 
   with the eu trade sanctions , there 's a gap to be filled . 
  if i recall correctly , i remember there were talks of eu warning serbia against doing so , so i do n't believe we 've made any profit from the whole sanctions thing . 
  edit : i 've found the source over [ here ] ( http://www.freshplaza.com/article/125953/eu-warns-candidate-members-turkey-and-serbia ) . 
   additionally , russian agriculture needs a financial injection of 13.3 billion . 
  meanwhile , the eu is trying to prevent non-boycotted countries to become russia 's main suppliers . 
  the union threatens that this may have consequences for candidate eu states . 
  although i can see why you think so , i believe that you are forgetting that the rest of the balkans ( or at least the majority of it through ex-yugoslavia ) went through the war as well , some of them i would say suffered far more than kosovo did . 
  in the end , i believe that the problem with kosovo are its politicians . 
  kosovo desperately needs better politicians , same with the rest of the balkans , as the people currently leading our countries are the same ones back from the war . 
  i believe that new faces are needed . 
  although there 's corruption in the balkans , it ca n't be compared to the situation in kosovo . 
  haha , / u/slyratchet ended up learning most of balkan history by having to moderate this subreddit . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_cigarette_consumption_per_capita at least the balkans are # 1 in one thing !, 
  what 's the guy on the left doing ? 
  nice , i 'm liking this . 
  i 'm enjoying the trend coming from romania , and now to bulgaria - perhaps serbia is next ? 
  it would be a perfect cooperation for our [ craiova group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craiova_group ) !, 
  i think balkans should have their own name . 
  we are like eastern europe , only poorer . 
  i 'm as confused as you are , but i suppose it 's because there is really no opposition . 
  at least he 's eu oriented , i guess . 
  stoning people without allahu ackbar is like going to a barbecue without any beer , or starting your day without a cup of coffee . 
  completely unnatural . 
   `` there are fools in every nation , there is no deficit here either , '' he added , stressing that he `` knows that a majority of bosniaks do not agree with what happened today . '', 
  yeah , i do n't get this either . 
  not just this thread , but this subreddit in general lately has a trend with flairless posters . 
  or changing their flair in the middle of a post , i 've noticed an american doing this earlier . 
  i 'm wondering this as well , security is awfully organised from bosnia 's side to allow something like this to happen . 
  and put it in the middle of two pljeskavica . 
   20 years later comes to their funeral just to play the victim how is he playing the victim ? 
  he is n't denying what happened in srebrenica , and the reason why he came today was to pay respects in the hope of a better tomorrow . 
  i am not denying the things he did in the 90s , and it 's also probably the reason for what happened today , but you ca n't deny the fact that he changed politically and is the first time that serbia got an eu/western oriented government in a while .

  oh , they 're a founding member .
