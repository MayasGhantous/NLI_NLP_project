  how about belgium or other countries which were involved in slavery and colonialism ? 
  should they be allowed into eu ? 
  your message does n't make any sense . 
  if you dig into any country 's history , chances are that they 've done something awful at one point or another . 
  serbia has arrested and delivered almost all of the war criminals , but i guess to your logic the country should n't have any right to prosperity , as well as the 99 % of the people living there that did n't have anything to do with any of it . 
  i am genuinely surprised by the amount of 16 year olds . 
   you 're probably some 16 year old diaspora born after the war , really pathetic . 
  somehow i do n't doubt this , a single glance at the message you are responding to is enough to realise this . 
  i 've also been noticing lately that people from diaspora are way more nationalistic than the people living here . 
  what i meant more was that if the drone did n't fly off , the thing would n't get as massive as it did . 
  i thought their exchange was just banter . 
  yeah , i do n't get it either . 
  obviously there were loads of hooligans from both sides , but that flag pretty much sparked the whole thing . 
  i think the mistake was to even place the two countries against one another . 
  a little sun never hurt anybody . 
   is n't serbia trying to get closer to the eu ? 
  yes it is . 
   ( without counting that if you stay a long time in a country there may be a possibility to take that country citizenship , depend on the country though ) this is my current goal though , beats waiting for retirement until my country joins the eu in a decade or so , possibly . 
  i was actually considering poland quite a lot !, 
  i suppose the language also would n't be too hard to learn , as all slavic languages have some similarities to an extent . 
  well , that completely killed my motivation . 
   but then again if your goal is to get drunk , just drink tomislav until you drop . 
  this is a good idea , you can get drunk like [ ** this ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mspqgu5jfs ) guy . 
  would n't mind , romania is a beautiful country . 
  :-) how hard is romanian to learn anyway ? 
  i know almost next to nothing about the language . 
  thanks , that 's encouraging !, 
  i guess until i get a degree , the best thing i can do is get fluent in german/french or to at least a b2 level . 
  perfect time to migrate !, 
  out of curiosity , how hard is it for a software engineer to migrate to a different country , while coming from a country that 's not a part of the eu ? 
  that is , how in demand is the position currently ? 
  you can see the difference between the two on [ ** this ** ] ( http://www.goeuro.com/beer-price-index ) website , as well as the comparison between the rest of the european cities . 
   a study by a price comparison website suggests that thirsty - and thrifty - beer drinkers might like to head for the balkans where - in belgrade especially - the drinking is cheap . 
  the average price for a 33 cl beer goes for a bargain price of only ** 1.97 $ ** in belgrade compared to ** $ 2.58 ** in berlin , ** $ 3.85 ** in barcelona and a thumping ** $ 4.52 ** in london . 
   beer lovers with small wallets might wish to avoid geneva in switzerland , where a small bottle of beer costs around ** $ 6.32 ** . 
   other cities in the balkans are also cheap spots for beer lovers . 
  the overall average price is ** $ 2.29 ** in sofia , ** $ 2.62 ** in dubrovnik , ** $ 2.83 ** in bucharest or ** $ 3.81 ** in athens . 
  thanks !, 
  out of curiosity , you guys have already joined the eu - would you say that the situation in your country has improved positively from since then ? 
  wow , i 'll have to use that one from now on . 
  ha ha ha , do n't accidentally misplace your clay again . 
  i feel the same way . 
  i have one life and i 'm not throwing it away for a piece of land . 
  macedonia is full of mafia ? 
  because eeu is so great , right ? 
  there 's not a lot of alternative , really . 
  with everything awful about the government being considered , at least they are eu oriented . 
  or so i comfort myself . 
  it 's because of the heavy squatting . 
  we also suffered the heaviest losses in ww1 , with 27 % of the total population dead , 60 % of the male population , and 25 % of the army . 
  nothing like some accidental annexation . 
  even though he might be `` terrible '' to some , he is not so much to others . 
  a lot of people are appreciative of his posts . 
  that 's irrelevant however , because witch-hunt threads like these are incredibly petty . 
  i firmly believe that if anyone has a problem with one of the moderators , or a poster in general , should take it in private with the mods . 
  how would you feel if this thread was about you ? 
  not very pleasant , i 'd imagine . 
  i think it 's a great idea . 
  it would be incredibly helpful for the people who are studying another language , as it opens up an opportunity for the native speakers to correct them , especially considering that this subreddit is quite active compared to some linguistics ones . 
  why would they want out , when our economy is as fresh and healthy as these [ ** apples ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fqldesu.jpg ) ? 
  wow , an entire thread full of comments aimed at insulting one poster . 
  how is this even remotely acceptable ? 
  i 'm the same , i hope to move to either france , germany , or czech eventually . 
   they want to seem good yeah , because we serbs are evil genocidal maniacs !, 
  i do n't know w ** h ** o you meant by `` h ** e ** '' . 
  if anything e ** l ** se , tsargrad as a new name for constani ** p ** ole sounds like a ** m ** agnificent alternativ ** e ** . 
  there is no tsar in russia . 
  russia is an open democratic country where the people value each other 's views , and are not afraid to express them . 
  how will this affect the whole belgrade-budapest railway china is financing ? 
  wow , colour me impressed !, 
  it looks much better than the previous design , although the header could use some more work - and yet , i ca n't think of an alternative . 
  i 've just listed three things and probably more , or have you not read my post ? 
  i think this is a much better option than starting public threads aimed at a specific user ( s ) . 
  although what the particular poster did might be questionable , it 's still probably an unpleasant feeling for them to open a thread full of comments ( some unfriendly ) directed at them . 
  faster eu accession , did n't get bombed by nato , croatia 's outstanding tourism . 
  probably more things . 
   `` fight them over there . 
  if you can , put explosives under their cars , in their houses , all of them . 
  if you can , take some poison , put in it their drink , in their food , let them die . 
  kill them in every place and wherever you can . 
  in bosnia , in serbia , in sandzak . 
  you can do it , allah will help you , '' salahudding al bosni is heard saying . 
  influence religion has over people never fails to amaze me . 
  i always secretly wondered about something , and this looks like the perfect thread to grasp the opportunity and inquire about it . 
  current header of / r/europe , what is it meant to represent exactly ? 
  is there a meaning behind it - because half of europe is missing from it , or is it just placed like that in lack of a better alternative ? 
  on topic of flairs , i quite like them but they stand out too much - a more somber colour might be better , or perhaps make them look less bold and more blending in with the rest of the layout . 
  holy shit , you 're the croatian version of / u/crnaruka . 
  give it a rest . 
  how can you live with such hatred in your heart ? 
  everyone lost someone in the war , even serbs which you paint as 98 % of us being bloodthirsty maniacs . 
  stop exaggerating and find something better to do with your time . 
  your average croat , bosnian , and serb , do n't care about each other as much as you make it to be . 
  he 's also moldovan [ falsely representing himself ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ywm42/serbia_set_to_hold_joint_tactical_air_force/cpe20vf ) under the wrong flair . 
  * small edit * : i do n't think his intention is to paint serbs in a bad light , even though his posts show otherwise . 
  i believe his love for serbian , and balkan culture in general , is quite genuine . 
  it 's just unfortunate that he is more obsessed with the awful side of our history , instead of all the great things we once had and still have in our similar and shared culture . 
  i think he 's pretending to be ignorant on purpose , you can spot his unfriendliness towards the police officer right from the beginning of the video . 
  i guess that his aim was to film an `` evil corruption '' video for his channel , but instead he just made himself look like a fool . 
  favourite game of the majority of / r/europe posters : eu4/ck2 !,
