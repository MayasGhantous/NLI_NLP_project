   dr is gone ? 
  hell bring back crnaruka on one condition that he proves he is indeed a serb from bosnia via teamspeak or skype to a few other / r/europe [ 1 ] redditors . 
  honestly , this wo n't prove anything . 
  it 's very easy to lie on the internet , and nothing stops him from finding help through a native serbian speaker . 
  i believe that he 's from moldova while now living in the us . 
  it 's quite nice that he likes the balkans , the sad part is that he only likes talking about the bad side of it . 
  i do n't think so , it looks like all new mods have been removed . 
  * shhh !, 
  * a book just fell from my bookshelf . 
  i am more shocked to see / u/dclauzel not using french on the private subreddit . 
  here 's an entirely opposite opinion : i love your posts and they help my french a lot . 
  please continue writing in two languages , after all europe is a continent of many different cultures , and languages make an important part of them . 
  i 've bought from bookdepository a few days ago , it was completely shipping free . 
  time to move to czech . 
  there 's been a lot of hatred from both sides , give it a few years and the tension will lower itself just like it always does after a war . 
  i 'm not going to deny that there 's been blatant fear mongering being done by the media in my country , i guess in a way it 's to turn the people 's attention away from how poorly our country is doing . 
  i would like to believe that the average albanian and serb do n't have hatred for each other , and that they just wish to continue on with their everyday life . 
  this sub desperately needs different posts than the usual `` russia , brexit/grexit , immigrants '' . 
  it 's slowly turning into / r/worldnews . 
  what happened to the `` what do you know about ... '' series ? 
  we need those kinds of threads again , instead of the same politics being spun 24/7 . 
  not quite my tempo . 
  we need more songs in different languages . 
  i liked it , it 's a nice change from mostly slow songs of the other night . 
  :d best song so far though , imo . 
  it 's not that bad honestly , it 's catchy . 
  your time to shine . 
  armenia on the other hand has some beautiful girls . 
  do you think they are going to get many boos from the crowd just like last year ? 
   there are some bike tracks in skopje , macedonia , but they 're often blocked by parked vehicles . 
  you have just given hundreds of dutchmen browsing / r/europe a heart attack . 
  [ pink panthers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pink_panthers ) , consisting of former yugoslavs . 
  and then it becomes europe year . 
  if i recall correctly , croatia withdrew the ambassador due to seselj 's actions - a man whose political party is n't even in the parliament , and the amount of people that do follow him is incredibly small . 
  if anything , i thought the relationship between the two countries started improving . 
  seselj is a lunatic , but i believe that your average serb and your average croat probably do n't even care that much about each other , definitely not to the point of hate . 
  or am i being too optimistic ? 
   in light of recent raise of nationalism from both sides huh ? 
  i agree , if we are going by the whole `` brotherly nations '' debate that many people enjoy using , ukrainians should be our brothers as much as russians . 
   before we get to the `` we should n't let you into eu '' bandwagon again . 
  that is most likely op 's intention , just look at his post history . 
  yahoo answers are more credible than the un !, 
  thanks , good to know !, 
   the 30-year-old is the founder of the french ngo solidarity for kosovo , and first arrived in serbia after the march 2004 anti-serb violence in kosovo . 
   since then , gouillon and his organization delivered humanitarian assistance worth over eur 1.5 million in more than 30 convoys . 
    he also the author of the book , `` all my roads lead to serbia . '', 
  one of my personal favourites , it always seems to be overshadowed by crime and punishment and the brothers karamazov , of which both are rather amazing . 
   also , how is serbia involved in this whole albania-macedonia thing from last week ? 
  we are n't really , we just placed troops to guard our borders . 
  what 's your alternative ? 
  i believe that a big part about `` greater albania '' is played by blatant fear mongering done by our media and macedonia 's government . 
  a terrible thing happened yesterday in kumanovo , but i do n't believe it 's connected to albania 's government . 
  think of it this way - if albania attempts its alleged plans , it will immediately get struck down by the neighbouring countries ( our military might be bad these days , but theirs is nowhere better , plus we would outnumber them drastically ) , their eu plans would fall into water , and i believe that 's something albania would n't want , as just like the rest of the balkans , they are n't doing very well . 
  there 's obviously plans of `` greater albania '' - but i believe they are just nationalistic chants done by a minority , something not to worry about . 
  * serbian * english * spanish ( i 'm only able to read and understand some ) * french ( learning ) * german ( learning , on hold for now ) after studying german for a few months , my motivation completely dropped to the point where i replaced it with learning french , which so far for me was an interesting and fun journey . 
  however , spoken and written french seem almost like completely two different things , so my journey might be much longer than anticipated . 
  i have plans to achieve fluency in french eventually . 
  you forgot the part where germany takes most of the blame for the damages . 
  it 's hard to find a source in english , but if my assumption that you are from croatia is correct , then you will easily be able to read about it from [ ** here ** ] ( http://www.blic.rs/vesti/hronika/557679/priveden-predsednik-drzave-liberland-on-demantuje ) . 
  it 's also on their official ( ? ), 
  [ ** twitter ** ] ( https://twitter.com/liberland_org/status/597159216927940609 ) account . 
  it will make a good chapter in liberland 's history book . 
  '' * just two weeks after forming , its president was arrested trying to reach it . 
  i support your decision , and out of curiosity where have you moved to ? 
  albania would n't have a bright and prosperous future if it goes ahead with these alleged plans , so i do n't see it happening . 
   before the introduction of routine childhood vaccination , infectious diseases were the leading cause of childhood death globally . 
  every year , 10.6 million children die before the age of 5 , with 1.4 million of these deaths are due to diseases that could have been prevented by vaccines , said sedl\u00e1kov\u00e1 . 
  they should make vaccination mandatory like they have in my country , it 's crazy not to get vaccinated in this day and age . 
   does n't matter , does it ? 
  he 's giving me the opportunity to freshen up my french !, 
  as someone who is learning french currently , his comments have been very helpful . 
  it 's true , bulgaria keeps on trying to usurp it from us ... there 's even an old prophecy which says that the next balkan wars will be fought not over clay , but over cuisine . 
  please do n't involve us , thanks . 
  [ kumanovo : shooting intensifies , reinforcement arrives ] ( http://www.independent.mk/articles/17290/kumanovo+shooting+intensifies%2c+reinforcement+arrives ), 
  they got arrested . 
  why is this newsworthy ? 
  i think before anything else , it 's important to note that the things our president says should n't always be taken seriously . 
  he 's often considered a comical figure in our country , and his opinion always seems to contradict the opinion of our pm . 
  with that out of the way , there is n't any reason for serbia to accept kosovo 's independence when there are still countries in the eu ( and the rest of the world ) which have n't done so , regardless of what might be their reasons for choosing so . 
  even though majority serbs wish to join the eu and i believe that there is n't a political party which is anti-eu , or at least one that is in the parliament ( i might be wrong about this - and if i am , then the number is probably as low as one ) , it 's important to understand how much people here even know about serbia 's accession to eu . 
  every now and then in the papers the people would read how recognising kosovo is a must before joining the eu , and then people would get upset just to later read the same papers to see that it 's not necessary to recognise kosovo at all . 
  i am pretty sure same thing was printed about sanctioning russia , one of our largest trading partners . 
  this is why people get upset , many of them are completely oblivious of the process and the rules that need to get implemented . 
   the same eu you hate so much this is a loud minority of the posters , usually those on the nationalistic side which aim for closer ties with russia , believing in some slavic brotherhood , even though the history taught us opposite . 
  do n't understand me wrong however , i do love russia 's culture and the country is incredibly beautiful , but facts are that chasing after russia in today 's age would n't help my country nearly as much as joining eu would , which all the neighbouring nations have , or already plan to . 
  of course , there are also people who are anti-eu that should n't be considered nationalistic and not necessarily linking themselves to russia . 
   why is kosovo so important to you serbs anyway ? 
  because it 's an incredibly important part of our country 's history and culture . 
  this might be considered in many people 's eyes as something completely irrelevant from the past , but many of us hold that province close to our hearts . 
  we even proposed to split it with albania already in the past , taking the northern serb-dominated part of it and leaving the rest to albania , but this was declined . 
  slave to what ? 
  i 'm not recognising kosovo 's independence but that does n't mean that i 'm not supporting serbia 's path towards eu . 
  speak for yourself please . 
  at least we are rich on shopska salad , which bulgaria tried to usurp from us . 
  * english is useful and everyone should know it . 
  thing with serbian flairs on this subreddit is that many posters using them are n't actually from serbia at all . 
  of course , there are some of them that are actually from serbia and are posting idiotic things , but very frequent posters you would see on this subreddit that appear to be nationalistic are n't even serbian . 
  famous poster that always spews nonsense here which i wo n't name is actually from moldova . 
  i wo n't disagree with you about our president , but then again hardly anyone takes him here seriously . 
  i 'm pretty sure everyone stopped taking him seriously when the chinese pm arrived to our country and he started telling him how `` yellow people will come from the east and take over the world '' .
