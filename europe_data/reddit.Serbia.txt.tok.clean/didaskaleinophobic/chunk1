lol !, 
  the whole idea of `` church officials/clerics/imams / popes/ministers '' is absolutely mind numbing . 
  spend 4 years at at an institute reading some books and suddenly your bullshit has credence . 
  this will make a lot of gay europeans very happy . 
  so happy it hurts . 
  kazakhstan because of the beautiful blue , macedonia because it looks like kamikaze , and estonia because black + blue is just perfect together . 
  there was also a nice landscape photo of estonia where the scene actually looks like the flag . 
  nermin padez ... hehe ( ca n't find a word to translate ` padez ' into english . 
  pls halp . ), 
  they 're the glue . 
  you should get your father to do an ama !, 
  it would be epic, 
  slavoj zizek talks about this in depth , good times . 
  im paraphrasing but it 's along the lines of : `` spare me your politically correct bullshit , when i come to a country , i want to hear the dirty jokes . 
  the vile and evil jokes , because they 're more honest than any of the facades that are propped up '', 
  you shall self-assemble !, 
  ca n't blame ya , they 're so nicely and comfortably tucked in there having lullabies whispered in their ears by neighbours . 
  argh ... 
  i know i know ... and concede . 
  not only was i really young at the time , but the otpor/gotov je graffiti stencil fists were the most prevalent symbols for me at the time . 
  my visual memory prevailed : /, 
  70 % for me . 
  did n't know the bulldozer thing and albania 's leader question ... also thought dubrovnik was brod ( ship ) since it 's on the shore ... 
  awaiting the `` war on continental drift '', 
  zizek is awesome . 
  dude is my pick for balkan ambassador . 
  god and the intern . 
  monotheism is waaaaay more pretentious than polytheism . 
  i 'm pretty sure it was from that n'sync video from back when justin had ramen hair . 
  yeah !, 
  too many fuckin ' burger kings in germany !, 
  there i said it !, 
  edit : despite / r/polandball having a chuckle , i was actually quite serious . 
  on my first visit to germany i saw way too many burger kings . 
  i managed to shrug it off in munich , and a few other smaller cities , but when i got to [ nuremberg ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9yceurw.jpg ) there were 2 fuckin ' burger kings with their ugly-ass neon logo [ within 200 meters of each other ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o7frslq.png ) coming out of the train station . 
  i find it hard to beleive that this chain can be so popular in germany amidst all the amazing food . 
  but hey , free market whatever . 
  what is happening at italy 's northern border ? 
  the weather is amazing , the women are beautiful , the air smells wonderful and the nights are full of stars . 
  * disclaimer : i have never been to malta . 
  as in wolfgang amadeus ? 
  yeah kosovo is gone , and if russia wanted to spite the eu they would just raise the gas prices by 50 %, 
  yeah fuck those russian guys , who are ** they ** to question * freedom and democracy bases ^ \u00ae \u00a9 * . 
  good . 
  the us bought kosovo in exchange for beefed-up military bases and no-one blinked an eye , or gave half a fuck . 
  why is it suddenly a problem to have russia chilling in serbia with their own arsenal ? 
  is it any different ? 
   they appear arrogant and like to look down on people while telling them what 's wrong with their lifestyle . 
  see i only partly agree with this . 
  people there have turned bitching into a national sport . 
  the entire population is bitching and complaining about everything , while at the same time being the cause of 95 % of the things they are bitching about . 
  bitching about corruption while being corrupt . 
  bitching about being poor while using any means necessary to gain profits at the expense and helplessness/illiteracy of others . 
  bitching about lawlessness while expecting no repercussions when they bash someone 's face in with an ashtray after a night of drinking , and being happy that their crimes can be written off because `` they know some people in high places '' . 
  bitching about the ` evil western influences ' while destroying their own country any chance they get . 
  so naturally , they project . 
  if i 'm a skinny nerd with a small dick , i 'm gon na project my hate onto the buff dudes picking up chicks because it 's much easier to deal with the problem that way . 
  if bosnia is swimming in a pond of shit , they will naturally hate and write off anyone that tells them the truth about the world they are living in . 
  they are content with keeping the status-quo and bitching about it at the same time so long as they do n't have to change their behaviour or consciousness . 
  you should see how it is in bosnia . 
  muslim prayers playing loudly off the minarets several times a day mixed in with church bells ringing several times a day . 
  it 's like a back-to-back dj party for the sheeple . 
  after a while you do n't even have a need for a wristwatch . 
  everything there is a clusterfuck . 
  no-one knows how the government works . 
  no-one knows who is in charge of what . 
  no-one knows if they will keep their jobs if the ` ruling party ' changes . 
  there 's no jobs unless you 're affiliated with a political party . 
  noone has money yet they are drunk and partying 90 % of the time . 
  the economy is shit . 
  the justice system is even bigger shit . 
  the cops are in on everything . 
  everyone is pretty much employed in the public sector . 
  an honest person there can not make a living . 
  it is a deeply divided country with almost zero production that will face big challenges moving into the future . 
  things in bosnia can only get worse . 
  making them late for something, 
  exit festival in serbia - http://www.exitfest.org/en lots of techno , psy , drum 'n' bass , house ( though there are other stages ), 
  why ? 
  you mean because of the beer ? 
  [ how ireland saved the economy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i8jgf.png ), 
  my comment was a brave pun attempt . 
  i 'm moving to poland , for better or worse ... , 
  it 's unfortunate that the 2 words are basically complete opposites ( at least in my language ) : in that ` slava ' means celebration and slave os everything but celebration ... 
  slaves ? 
  did you mean slavs ? 
  i 'm moving to poland , for b\u0119dzin or warsaw . 
  prolly because belgrade was the capitol of yugoslavia . 
  there was a pretty cool post about him over on / r/documentaries recently . 
  i have no respect for women like her . 
  how do you feel about the [ serbian pentagon ] ( http://x.vukajlija.com/var/products/posters/201108/207719/srpski.jpg ) ? 
  dat froth ... is surprisingly hard to master . 
  true story . 
  my friends ordered sushi one night for me to try for the first time . 
  there was rice sure , but nope , ca n't eat fish without bread - the look of disgust on their faces was priceless . 
   when it 's a french drinking wine in your pub . 
  i lol 'd, 
  tough shit . 
  neither srs or trolls can get in the way of a good religion bashing , especially when the topic is evolution ... in 2012 * facepalm . 
   it 's pretty clear that they are doing it in the name of their god .
