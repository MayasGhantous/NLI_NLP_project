i loved olomouc . 
  been there last year and i really liked it . 
  was n't really a fan of prague , too much tourists for my taste . 
  the funny thing is , that policeman was rafik ahmetovic , bosnian . 
  i jedno i drugo su generalizacije . 
  well , it went better than expected , that 's for sure . 
  yet, 
  alan ford was great . 
  but only with croatian translation . 
  i 've tried reading new ones , in serbian and it 's just not the same . 
  yep , even i know these songs . 
   a doctor reported obama to the police for crimes against humanity . 
  doctor who ? 
  [ stefan nemanja ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stefan_nemanja ) - founder of the powerful serbian state that would evolve into the serbian empire , and the national church . 
  he was the father of stefan nemanji\u0107 , the first king of serbia , and of saint sava , the first archbishop of the serbian orthodox church [ du\u0161an the mighty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stephen_uro%c5%a1_iv_du%c5%a1an_of_serbia ) - emperor of the serbs and greeks ( from 16 april 1346 ) until his death on 20 december 1355 . 
  du\u0161an managed to conquer a large part of southeast europe , becoming one of the most powerful monarchs in his time . 
  he enacted the constitution of the serbian empire in du\u0161an 's code , one of , if not the most important work of medieval serbia . 
  du\u0161an promoted the serbian church from an archbishopric to a patriarchate . 
  if you end up in novi sad again pm me if you want to share a beer or two , three , nine , eleven . 
   it makes you think , what is going in their minds ? 
  unfortunately we and our neighbors had to find that out the hard way . 
   i know just one romanian of partial serb ancestry : her serbian grandfather was part of the waffen ss and she said that when she was a child , he told her stories about the war crimes he committed . 
  are you sure that her grandfather was serbian and not volksdeutche from vojvodina ? 
  because sometimes they were in the ss . 
   lol , the serbs complaining about being driven away . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_storm http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4747379.stm not that i 'm defending dodik , i ca n't stand the guy , but come on , serbs certainly do know how is it to be driven away . 
  they play in the last league of bosnia and herzegovina . 
  although i 'm not from there , when i saw those guys and how they try to have fun and help their local community i just fell in love with their whole '' project '' . 
  if anyone is interested here is a documentary movie about them . 
  it has english subs . 
  and even i 'm in it , heh .

  source ? 
  my hair is black probably because some turkish lord used his droit du seigneur and humped my great great great great great grandmother . 
  so , there 's that . 
  holy fucking shit there is vojvodina flair ? 
  welp , i 'm in . 
  zdravko and veselin are also names in serbia . 
  same probably goes for kamen , except in serbian is kamenko ( meaning '' of stone '' ) . 
  male - nemanja , strahinja ... 
  studied sociology for four years before deciding that i 'm not interested in it at all . 
  i 'm now studying to be preschool ( kindergarten ? ), 
  teacher and i 'm finally happy with my choice . 
  novi sad , serbia . 
  and i 'm male , if that 's somehow relevant . 
  in other news - water is wet , the sky is blue , women have secrets . 
  well , it 's not like they 're eating healthy food anyway . 
   i think i 've always been level-headed that 's impossible . 
  you 're serbian . 
  college , not collage , my fellow countryman . 
  monument has been moved to private land already if i 'm not mistaken . 
  yeah , i realized that shortly after . 
  you 're right . 
  my mistake then . 
   the name `` vojvodina '' ( \u0412\u043e\u0458\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 ) in the serbian language simply means `` voivodship '' or `` duchy '' . 
  its original historical name ( from 1848 ) was `` serbian voivodship '' ( serbian vojvodina ) . 
  the serbian language uses two more varieties of the word vojvodina . 
  these varieties are vojvodovina ( \u0412\u043e\u0458\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430 ) , and vojvodstvo ( \u0412\u043e\u0458\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e ) , the latter being an equivalent to the polish word for province , wojew\u00f3dztwo ( voivodship ) . 
  vojvodina - land of the army leader ? 
  no way . 
  in serbian vojvoda means duke , so vojvodina is land of the duke . 
  if you can get your hands on anything written by [ milorad pavi\u0107 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milorad_pavi%c4%87_ ( writer ) ) or by [ danilo ki\u0161 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danilo_ki%c5%a1 ) you 'll probably be pleasantly surprised . 
  they 're not recent authors but , dictionary of the khazars and encyclopedia of the dead are great . 
  borislav pekic is also not too bad . 
  also milorad pavi\u0107 - [ dictionary of the khazars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dictionary_of_the_khazars ) and borislav peki\u0107 - [ how to quiet a vampire ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1101366.how_to_quiet_a_vampire ), 
  as i 've said , i feel that people were orchestrated into war . 
  there was clearly some ethnic tensions before , but not as strong as after the war . 
  to me , it 's funny that we were united , and , then - war . 
  every nation to it 's side . 
  and now look at us . 
  every nation wants to be a part of eu . 
  to be united again . 
  come on man , do n't tell me you 're spending your free time with tycoons and politicians . 
  i do n't think that there is a single person which thinks that we 're all better now than before . 
  also , i 'm still convinced that breakup of yugoslavia and that bloody war were somehow orchestrated . 
  i declared myself as yugoslav in recent census . 
  i probably am . 
  i 'm afraid to answer this . 
   french - \u017dabari ( froggers ) woah now , we call italians like that . 
  ne smeta mi . 
  well , brother , you have a couple of drinks on me if we ever meet . 
  why romania ? 
  i 've lived nearly whole my life near serbian-romanian border and i still do n't have opinion of them one way or another . 
  but thank you for not mentioning russia . 
  well , if you ask me ... 
  i kid , i kid . 
  fiiiine , i 'm coming ... 
  they were not , but they sure as hell are now . 
  just enormously discouraged . 
  well i was n't planing on walking to zagreb , that 's sure . 
  of course they were allowed to have kids , why would n't they ? 
  and it was common , wherever serbian people were , there was always at least one priest and his family . 
  why not ? 
  if you were a priest 500 years ago it was well possible that your son would follow in your footsteps . 
  he would get free education and , well , it was a stable job , so to speak . 
  same in serbia . 
  actually i think that in order for you to get your own parish you have to get married after you finish theology studies . 
  no , you can write serbian in both alphabets without context and content changing . 
  serbian is practically the only european standard language with complete synchronic digraphia . 
   i know only one serb who does n't like russia and putin  uzice :d well that answers that .
