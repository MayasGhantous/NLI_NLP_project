  when a few years later kosovo declared independence anyway , most nato countries decided to ignore the resolution and recognize kosovo anyway . 
  how are ukrainan referendums any better ? 
  see the 1991 referendum mentioned above , why was it not recognized ? 
  yeah but after serbia was illegally bombed into submission there was a un resolution which made everything ok . and when kosovo broke that resolution too by declaring independence it was still cool and totally legal , and can not at all be compared to the crimea because ... 
  i dunno , because russians do n't have cnn/bbc to wash some brains out ? 
  they also did n't recognize abkhazia when it declared independence , so what do you think will happen now ... ? 
  crimea should open new george bush and obama boulevards and send love letters to americans , maybe then they will get `` international '' recognition . 
  the law was abolished , i do n't know what you 're talking about ( or why people are upvoting you ) . 
  it does n't matter if crimea had constitutional protection or not , the people on the crimea just saw the legally elected president being overthrown by a government whose first order of business was reducing minority rights . 
  who says such a government would respect any constitution ? 
  it was n't exactly unilateral , since the decision to abolish kosovo 's economy could only be brought by the presidency of yugoslavia , consisting of all 6 republics . 
  you had at least 4 republics in favor of doing it ( i have n't found sources but i 'm guessing croatia and slovenia were opposed ) . 
  they are called tatars , not tartars . 
  i wo n't vote at all , in any country . 
  my knowledge on this subject transcends your miserable existence . 
  check my flag asshole, 
  why was russia for resolution 1244 ? 
  are you going to dance around the reason or answer it ? 
  thanks , i have n't meant it to be a provocation and was hoping people would respond like you did . 
  it 's just my opinion and of course i 'm a nobody and ca n't influence world opinion , but i think if a population takes up arms to gain independence , then `` that '' is the threshold where you need to consider international recognition . 
  i know examples like eta and ira are counter-examples , but those happened a long time ago and i think new standards need to apply since the kosovo independence . 
  how did one gain said mandate ? 
   20 thousand foreign troops in unbadged uniforms ( that is already a violation of the geneva convention ) source ? 
   via the national referendum which would get rejected by the rest of the ukraine, 
  i do n't see the difference , other than the severity of the repression . 
  what other difference is there ? 
  what did your brilliant post say jeff ? 
  share your wisdom with us morons . 
  so ... the crimea needs to be brutally ethnically cleansed for it to gain the * right * to secede ? 
  what else , if the woman sinks in the lake then she 's not a witch ? 
  i think voting should be decided by residence . 
  if you live in a country you should vote , even if you 're not a citizen , because it affects you . 
  if you 're a citizen but are n't living in the country , you should n't be able to vote since you do n't have to face the consequence of your vote . 
  also , residence should be checked ( for example by tax records ) , so for example migrants who live in a different country for 10 years but still are registered as living at their mom 's should n't be able to vote . 
  we could move people around so they 're evenly distributed . 
  i 'm sure the eu is more than capable of establishing an expensive commission that would investigate the means and possibilities . 
  you mean if you oppress them just a little bit then they ca n't separate ? 
  which amount of oppression is required for fulfilling your criteria ? 
  makes sense , if kosovo 's independence is legal according to icj then any region may declare independence legally . 
  europe is overpopulated , why do we need 100 people/km ^ 2 anyway ? 
  it 's crowded , you 're forced to live in a small and expensive flat , with annoying neighbors , you travel in full buses or trams or sit in your car for hours . 
  now if we lower that to 50 people/km ^ 2 then maybe everyone could get a house and a normal environment for children to grow up in . 
  there was a similar joke during the nato bombing of serbia . 
  they repeatedly bombed a factory for which the government said it produced only washing machines and vacuum cleaners , not weapons , while nato claimed the opposite . 
  so the joke goes like : a guy was working at that factory and then it got bombed so now he 's out of work . 
  his friend asks `` why did n't you steal parts while you were still working , at least now you 'd have a vacuum cleaner or a washing machine ? '' . 
  '' - i did , but whenever i put the parts together it came out a tank '', 
   changing your constitution is generally dangerous . 
  nah , all countries do it all the time and most manage to survive . 
  and your civil war was like 200 years ago so you ca n't justify today 's decisions with what happened in a completely different environment and mindset back then . 
  what are the chances of erdogan getting elected again ? 
  i 'm guessing if the clerics are now going against him , and also the liberals , then he does n't have much support left other than his cronies ? 
  hungarians : that we 're depressive and suicidal . 
  i mean it 's true but there 's no need to rub it in !, 
   there are 25 % more hungarians living in germany than in 2012 , now 135.000 are registered [ 19 ] ( and surely many more others live there who do not appear in these numbers ) i 'm wondering about this and no one seems to have researched this so far . 
  there have been what , 300 thousand people who have taken hungarian citizenship so far from across the border ? 
  let 's say that out of 10 people i know , all from serbia , 6 have moved to the eu in the last 10 years , and all of them have taken the hungarian citizenship ( since it 's convenient ) . 
  if my personal example is anywhere close to how it 's elsewhere , then out of those 300 thousand at least 180 thousand are living in western europe . 
  so my theory is , the sudden increase of hungarians everywhere could be attributed to these people getting registered as hungarians , while previously they were counted as romanians , serbs etc. 
  again , too bad no one looked into this so far ... 
  sorry about what happened to your gf btw . 
  are you saying the elections in may wo n't count because the setting in ukraine is anything but neutral right now ? 
   how weak yanukovych really was that 's the point . 
  he was n't weak . 
  after he gave in to the demands he was overthrown , not before . 
  just a day prior to the coup there were reports of reinforcement trucks from the east heading to kiev . 
  you and billy are playing in the sand . 
  * billy punches you * you : billy punched me !, 
  me : he was just joking , go play with him . 
  * billy punches you again * you : billy punched me again !, 
  me : aww he 's just playing * you punch him back * me : do n't be a bad boy , ro4ers !, 
  now appologize to billy and continue playing with him !, 
  the ukranian government signed a deal with russia , which caused the protests . 
  the protesters were getting their asses kicked . 
  the eu meddled in and made the government sign a deal which agreed to most of the protesters demands . 
  after this show of weakness the government was overthrown the next day . 
  had the eu not meddled in , the violent protesters would be in prison right now and russia would still have a deal worth billions with ukraine . 
  they have effectively lost a lot of money because the eu tricked the ukrainan government into signing its own death warrant . 
  right now , the eu has no right to demand the russians sit down and talk with the same people who broke their word once . 
   nevertheless dmitry peskov ridiculed western demands for direct talks between the kremlin and the new kiev government , claiming that the loss of credibility involved `` puts a smile on our face '' . 
  this is not `` mocking the west '' . 
  the last time moscow sat down for talks they were tricked by the same west , and now the west , instead of demanding the reinstatement of the democratically elected president , it asks russia to accept the illegal government and continue talks ? 
  you know that saying ? 
  `` fool me once , shame on you . 
  fool me twice , shame on me '', 
  i think it was pretty good journalism . 
  you need to understand the russian/ukrainan mentality , if an ordinary citizen faces a soldier and the soldier tells him to `` go away '' or issues some other command , the citizen will most likely do that . 
  in this case the soldiers in both cases were surprised when he did n't go away , you can see this since they did n't have a prepared answer to his provocation , meaning he was likely the first one there that did n't obey commands . 
  whether his approach was appropriate or not , he managed to interview the ship 's captain , which is something you can not say the cnn , bbc or others have managed to do . 
  [ in ** august ** chechnya invades russia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jz7r0hp.jpg ), 
  if it 's widespread then i 'm sure we can see at least 5 pictures , just 5 , in this digital age where everyone has cameras ... 
  the article offers 0 . 
   damn . 
  i saw allegations of this on twitter yesterday and really hoped it would turn out to be some sort of mistake or exaggeration . 
  it makes the blood run cold . 
  i saw no evidence that this is happening , no pictures or anything . 
  just because rustem kadyrov is saying he has an x on his door does n't mean anything , and in the worst case he could 've painted it himself for propaganda effect . 
  if this is not happening on a massive scale , it is not organized and clearly ca n't be blamed on the russians . 
  this happened like 10 years ago so do n't talk to me like i do n't remember how things happened . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_dagestan_%281999%29  the invasion of dagestan began , when chechnya invaded the neighbouring russian republic of dagestan on ** august ** 2 , 1999 .
