  the war ended with a major russian victory . 
  the invasion of dagestan served as the casus belli for the second chechen war the housing block bombing happened * after * the counter-attack , as a revenge . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_apartment_bombings  the russian apartment bombings were a series of explosions in the russian cities , killing 293 people and injuring 651 . 
  the explosions occurred in buynaksk on 4 ** september ** , moscow on 9 and 13 september , and volgodonsk on 16 september . 
  if you 're too young to remember what chechnya was like before the second war , i suggest you search some x-rated websites for chechen ransom videos ... 
  as far as i remember , when chechnya was de facto independent ( just at the start of putin 's ascent to power ) , they invaded russia , so the second war started as a defense and then counter-attack . 
  if you grant them independence , who says the same thing wo n't happen again ? 
  are you linguistically challenged ? 
   ** the people in the crimea ** ... ** they ** can only use force, 
   he said that according to article 73 of the constitution of ukraine , the issues of territories and borders could be discussed only at a nationwide referendum . 
  and that 's the whole point . 
  the people in the crimea have no democratic options to separate if the rest of the country wo n't let them . 
  they can only use force . 
   this is clearly russia just hoping in and getting access to the black sea . 
  they already have access to the black sea . 
  you should read his memoirs he explains his every action . 
  it 's horrible what happened in vietnam but it is no way kissinger 's fault . 
  the pro-ukrainan propaganda on this subreddit is disgusting . 
  can the mods please move all this crap under one topic , like it was a week ago ? 
  well ok but you have to agree that it was n't genocide ... again , croatia , pop . 
  4 million . 
  let 's say that vukovar was 100 % croatian , which it was n't , and that the serbs murdered every living thing in the city , which they did n't , that would be like 25 thousand people , or 0,6 % even in such a scenario you could n't say that the serbs committed genocide because they did n't even endanger the survival of your people . 
  maybe if they murdered all your women or all your children or somehow tried to destroy your possibility to exist in the future ... 
  instead , they killed several hundred wounded fighters , men who were shooting at them a few days earlier . 
  yes it 's a horrible war crime since they were defenseless and in need of care , but the people that killed them did n't do it because they thought it would destroy all croatians . 
  they did it probably because they were criminals and this was the situation they enjoyed . 
  please do n't report me to the hague tribunal , i promise i wo n't genocide anymore :(, 
   the suit ranges from genocide tell me of one case of genocide in croatia . 
  i 'll be surprised if you do n't get downvoted . 
  who cares what the people want when russia is evil, 
   population went from 36 % to 7 % those people were murdered or * expelled * ? 
  read the definition of genocide again and then we can talk more ... 
  actually i agree with him . 
  what would be justice for you ? 
  maybe have serbia pay 1 million euros to every victim 's family ? 
  so that would be like 100 billion euros and the debt would not be paid in 100 years . 
  would that make the victims happy ? 
  today the people in their 20 ` es were n't even born or were very young when the fighting took place , why should they suffer just because their ancestors were idiots ? 
  some of my ancestors were murdered by x , do you think the no. 1 priority in my life is finding someone to blame ? 
  my point is , to the outside world this looks exactly what it is , two immature nations bickering over an event everyone agrees was everyone 's fault , while `` on the inside '' , this is just a confirmation that the other side is evil and genetically genocidal and we should never trust them blablabla . 
  * nothing good will come out of this . 
  and then there are the mirvs which were specifically invented to counter anti-missile defenses . 
  one warhead contains hundreds of nuclear warheads that disperse like cluster bombs . 
  because we 're idiots . 
  and you want to prove that you 're even bigger idiots and you 're doing great !, 
  stop this holocaust or i 'll sue !, 
  give it to lichtenstein, 
  stop genociding me you monster !!, 
  some of the damage done was committed by people born and living in croatia , are you going to sue yourself ? 
  how is 300 killed out of a population of 4 million considered genocide ? 
  yes it was a crime but people like you take a tragedy and turn it into mindfuck, 
  the ukrainan pravda says it 's false news , the ship is under repair in greece : [ source ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=uk&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.pravda.com.ua%2fnews%2f2014%2f03%2f1%2f7016834%2f&amp;act=url ), 
  yes , that 's why i said `` here '' . 
  the planes that bombed my city came from aviano . 
  from what i understood from ukrainan posters on this forum , the ukrainan constitution would not allow a referendum for independence of crimea . 
  so those people do n't have any democratic options . 
  i guess the air shows stopped when there was no more need for air shows over ` here ', 
  so was belgium but they defended it nonetheless . 
  they are poorer than * kosovo * . 
  why would we want ukraine in the nato ? 
  what 's in it for us ? 
  the opposition is free to defeat you at the next election , if they can . 
  the situation in crimea now clearly shows the coup was not supported by everyone and that had there been a proper election the protesters might 've been left in the minority . 
  i do n't think this is `` ukraine '' pleading , it 's more like the illegitimate coup government that is afraid it might have to return power to the legally elected people . 
  i do n't get it - who cares what the icelanders demand ? 
  who said they could join the eu anyway ? 
  if they want to join then stand in line and wait for 10-15 years , just like everyone else . 
  let me [ quote myself ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ypauv/a_not_so_democratic_step_ukrainian_parliament/cfmroz0 ) from yesterday ... 
   criminal crime is n't your country one of the most corrupted in europe , and you just recently had a violent mob overthrow your legally elected president ? 
  since when have you started respecting your own laws ? 
  what hipocracy !, 
  you people have violently overthrown the legally elected government . 
  do you think in such an atmosphere anyone would dare oppose you ? 
  for any validity in this situation you would need a referendum . 
  in short , the people currently occupying the territory can leave , but the territory stays ? 
  is that what you think of your fellow citizens of different ethnicity ? 
  maybe you just need to give the territory where the russians live to russia , that way they do n't have to leave anywhere ? 
   it 's was not a first-order decision , the parliament works 3 days non-stop to back off the most controversial decisions of yanukovich . 
  was the russian minority consulted in those 3 days whether they want the law repelled ? 
   no it 's not , stop spreading this already . 
  [ these people ] ( http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=ad2_1393083985 ) do n't seem to like your ethnic ukrainan `` revolution '', 
  [ that was also ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-jewish_pogroms_in_the_russian_empire ), 
  the fact that the first order of business for the `` new '' government was to limit the rights of non-ukrainans shows what i 've been otherwise telling on this forum before ( and getting downvoted for it ) , that this is n't a revolution against corruption , it 's an inter-ethnic dispute between russians and ukrainans . 
  the russian minority now see that their rights are being infringed upon by the violent ukrainans . 
  we will see if this will lead to more violence . 
  i would n't be surprised if the cities in the east and south go into open revolt and seccede from the country . 
  that 's how things should work in a fair society ( except the killing part ) . 
  what 's your point ? 
  they need at least 1 million supporters right ? 
  it says they started this on 20/11/2013 so that 's 3 months ago and so far they 've gathered only 15 thousand votes ? 
  luckily real money is guaranteed by 1 ) the institution 2 ) the state so no one other than the bank actually lost money ( and there 's a chance they 'll get it back ) . 
  with bitcoin , if it 's gone then it 's gone for good . 
   perhaps he does n't speak turkish . 
  perhaps he should learn it then . 
   a concern of many educated refugees is not just to get to safety , but to get to safety in a country where they can work with the skills they already have , where they can feel they are paying their own way and contributing instead of just languishing in camps or menial jobs . 
  him being a refugee does not give him the right to pick whichever country he wants to live in . 
  what about educated russians who would like to live in britain but * ca n't * apply for asylum because they are not in danger and are automatically rejected ? 
  if they have to take the legal , long , painful and expensive path to migration , then so must everyone else . 
  or , if they really are above-average , then they can make a good living anywhere , including in a country whose language they do n't yet know . 
  this is why minorities should be given autonomy , otherwise they will be assimilated and disappear over time ( looking at you slovakia/romania/serbia ) .
