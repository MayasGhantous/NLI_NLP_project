   onerichbastard 's comments exemplify the fear held by many romanians of hungarian revisionism and what is seen as attempts by hungary to middle in its neighbouring country 's internal affairs . 
  you have hungarians in romania enduring insults , they go over the border and tell their relatives what assholes you guys are ... those relatives will vote for parties that promiss to do something about it . 
  do you see the solution to the problem ? 
  in the future it should be the eu who should interfere in romania 's internal affairs , but i think that will only happen once the economic crisis is definitely over . 
   a lot of romanians believe the hungarian minority wants to declare its independence , similar to what happened with kosovo . 
  i do n't see it happening since the two communities are too much integrated . 
  in kosovo the serb and albanian community was very segregated , as in if you 're a serb you 're never going to have albanian friends , neither communities speak each others ' language , and girls are escorted so they would n't get attacked . 
  but let 's assume that the situation is the same , that hungarians and romanians hate each other so much you would n't even enter a shop if you knew it was owned by a hungarian . 
  in this situation - which would lead to a genuine desire for separation - why would it be a problem if the hungarian region wanted to go independent now , in the 21st century ? 
   as i 've pointed out to you before , the two situations are not comparable . 
  i do n't remember and i still disagree , it 's the exact same situation . 
  do you think the hungarians in romania feel it 's great that moldovans are getting romanian citizenship ? 
  i think they do n't care , and this is what romanians should do about hungary 's citizenship law : not care . 
  fine look , i 'm going to answer your question :  have they done something to you ? 
  no so this discussion is i guess finished because you say i hate romanians - i say i do n't , and you refuse to back up your claims . 
  that makes you a liar , and probably paranoid too . 
   if you think i 'm going to go through my post history and dig up the previous discussions i 've had with you then you 're sorely mistaken . 
  you * assume * that i hate romanians without knowing what my post history is ? 
   why should i tell him to fuck off ? 
  because of this :  they pulled ** this shit ** with the ethnic hungarian minority in romania . 
   the issue is you calling yourself hungarian even-though you were born in romania . 
  ( wtf ?? ), 
   all of which would be 100 % a-ok . ** if it was n't for hungary . 
  **  l ; dr - hungary awarding citizenship to people who speak hungarian across countries ** is a dick move ** clearly he has deep hatred towards hungarians , he even says it himself , the only reason why he cares about this issue is because one side is hungarian , so he naturally supports the other side . 
  he does n't even care that romania does this exact same thing with romanians , if it 's hungary that 's doing it , then it 's a dick move . 
  and you 're probably blinded by something , i 'm not sure what , perhaps it 's paranoia , perhaps you 're a nationalist yourself , but you ca n't tell him to fuck off , and instead here you are arguing with me and making up claims about how i hate romanians . 
  yeah but he was ethnic georgian , he even spoke russian with a georgian accent . 
  stalin was motivated by power while hitler was motivated by hatred . 
  they 're different personalities , you ca n't say that one cancels the other one because although they both left mass graves behind , their influence on the living and their legacy is different . 
   you 're a very bitter person and judging from your posts you seem to harbour some very strong feelings of hatred towards romanians . 
  have they done something to you ? 
  that 's a strong claim , can you back it up ? 
  please quote me my posts from which you got the idea that i have very strong feelings of hatred towards romanians . 
  please quote at least one such post of mine . 
  and i still do n't see you telling that romanian nationalist to fuck off . 
  i ca n't find anything about this in the serbian news sites ... 
  he was ethnic german and had a german citizenship . 
  omfg that 's so funny !, 
  hahaha evil gays, 
   and i 'd much prefer it if nationalists on both sides would just shut the fuck up . 
  as soon as you start telling * your * nationalists to shut the fuck up maybe things will start to change . 
  i do n't see you replying to onerichbastard anywhere ...  i 'm guessing you 're familiar with the situation of the vlach minority in serbia i know they consider themselves to be vlachs and not romanians , which is why i do n't see what 's romania trying to do except play the tough guy when their neighbour is down . 
  the romanians in banat have their rights protected , they can go to school etc. 
  and can go to university in their own language if they have at least the minimum number of students . 
  the slovak constitution has similar protections afaik . 
  the slovaks themselves gave citizenship to every slovak in the world , but they did this in the 1990 ` es before they joined the eu . 
  i have several slovak friends born in serbia and they all got their citizenship in the late 90 ` es . 
  after slovakia joined the eu they revoked the law but by that time everyone that wanted could 've gotten their citizenship ( including , for example , slovaks living in romania ) . 
  at that time , i did n't hear anyone complaining about this slovak law . 
  romania also has a similar law right now giving citizenship to moldovans , and there 's a clear tendency for the two countries to join sometime in the future . 
  i do n't hear anyone caring what the hungarians of romania , or the russians of moldova think about this . 
  and we can continue , there are similar laws in croatia , italy , ireland ... you 're just pissed because you 're a dirty romanian nationalist who hates hungarians . 
  you could 've just written that you hate hungarians and not waste everyone 's time with your long monologues . 
  i 'll vote against since i disagree with some of their populist moves ( eg . 
  the latest bank taxes , saving swiss franc debtors with my tax money ) but i have n't yet found a party i would vote for . 
  the rest of my family wo n't vote since they do n't live in hungary and do n't care . 
  but i do hear a lot of people including serbs will vote for fidesz as a thank you , and also because they 're afraid if the socialists come back to power they 'll take away the citizenship . 
  i 'm hungarian and i 'd like to learn arabic , maybe we can work something out ? 
  that 's yellow , not golden . 
  yeah but there 's no gold [ on the flag itself ] ( http://www.ultimateflags.com/images/p/albania-flag.gif ), 
  [ in 1942 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novi_sad_raid ) - so during his rule - several thousand jews and serbs were killed in one instance . 
  the jews were also living under severe repression even before 1944 , but i admit this was better treatment than they were getting in the rest of german-controlled europe . 
  well he was authoritarian , nationalist , clerical and royalist , but he was n't socialist , so that one ingredient is missing from being fully fascist . 
  he was thus only 4/5 fascist . 
  he also brought anti-jewish laws which is a trait of nazism , so you can say he was 5/6 nazi . 
   you answered 19 of 20 questions correctly for a total score of 95 % . 
  i did n't know the last question ( the albanian eagle ) . 
  i knew that it 's an eagle and that it 's black , so i was surprised when the correct answer was that it 's the * golden * eagle . 
  how can it be golden if it 's black ? 
   meanwhile , the reformed church initiated disciplinary proceedings against lorant hegedus , pastor of the church , where the monument was erected . 
  so maybe the statue will be removed soon ... http://www.politics.hu/20131104/govt-declines-to-comment-on-horthy-monument/, 
  well [ the square where that statue was revealed ] ( https://maps.google.com/maps?q=budapest,+szabads%c3%a1g+t%c3%a9r,+hungary&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;ll=47.504816,19.049563&amp;spn=0.004718,0.013078&amp;sll=47.482432,19.129542&amp;sspn=0.302093,0.837021&amp;oq=szabadsag+&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=1054+budapest,+szabads%c3%a1g+t%c3%a9r,+hungary&amp;z=17&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=47.504905,19.049636&amp;panoid=x7pocxjxdumkfn0htlvypg&amp;cbp=12,116.47,,0,8.27 ) already has a monument for the soviet liberators and another one for ronald reagan , i guess someone thought if there are already communists and capitalists then the fascists should get a place too . 
  btw . 
  this is n't the first horthy statue in hungary , there were several built before but i guess this one got attention since it 's in budapest and it 's like 5mins walk from the parliament . 
  budapest does n't have a negative growth but the rest of the country does . 
  in 2010 the city produced 40 % of the country 's gdp . 
  hungary is not correct . 
  we have a flat tax of 16 % , there 's an additional 6 % `` healthcare contribution '' on some securities under certain conditions , and the vat is 27 %, 
  do n't want a logo on your flag , russia ? 
  perhaps give your athletes some fucking money so they could train properly and would n't have to chase corporations to buy new skates . 
  i ca n't have sympathy for serbs while at the same time they are destroying hungarian statues in vojvodina , where * they * have the upper hand . 
  [ this is from two weeks ago ] ( http://www.politics.hu/20131021/foreign-ministry-condemns-statue-theft/ ) because of this i think if serbs were in control of kosovo today , then we would be reading about 98 % of albanian monuments desecrated . 
  as someone who speaks hungarian , serbian , slovenian and english - i would n't say the uk/american press is more free than the serbian , hungarian or slovene . 
  i 'm sure that the experts who made this map know what they are talking about , but i just do n't understand it . 
  there is nothing that is being kept quiet in the hungarian-serbian-slovenian press . 
  you want to know about some politician accepting a bribe ? 
  the prime minister getting drunk ? 
  tycoons working with the mafia to monopolize the market ? 
  you can read about all that stuff in our newspapers . 
  there are pro and anti-government tv , radio and newspapers . 
  and the internet is not at all restricted , in fact , it 's more free than in france , for example . 
  so what is it exactly that makes us less free than the us or uk ? 
  interesting ... so how many of you are planning to quit reddit ? 
  in mikko 's words , to `` make a small wave '' ? 
  i know but we did n't have that in serbia during the 90 ` es . 
  it 's made in slovenia i think ? 
  when cockta returned then apa kola disappeared again :(, 
   cant beleive no one has said this yet , but football sticker books those do n't exist anymore ? 
  born in yugoslavia in what is now serbia , started school in '88 ( we were the last pioneer generation , after us communism was abolished ) .
