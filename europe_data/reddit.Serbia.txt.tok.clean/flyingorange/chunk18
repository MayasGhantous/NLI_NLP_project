  you actually had to use glue , they were n't self-gluing like nowadays . 
  the animals were drawn , they were n't photographs .

  edit : added some more, 
  that translation is horrible so i did it myself  according to the resolution accepted on the udmr ( democratic alliance of hungarians in romania ) congress , the party will create a draft bill for the autonomy of szeklerland . 
  for its basis they will take the south-tyrolian autonomy as the model - said hunor kelemen , the party president , on the tuesday morning radio program on kossuth radio . 
   `` the south-tyrolean autonomy is a working , feasible model for szeklerland too . 
  within it the hungarians , romanians and other ethnicities will find the necessary institutional and economic conditions . 
  the government in rome handed over a number of jurisdictions to the south-tyrolean authorities . 
  because of this the local community can decide its own fate and it has developed models for all levels of government where an ethnic principle is used , such as the use of language , among others for applications . 
  these actions prevent assimilation , and the german community living there has a vision of the future where they may remain in their homeland without the threat of assimilation '' - the udmr statement quotes kelemen . 
   he added that convincing the romanian majority is the top priority . 
  the udmr 's draft for cultural autonomy has been in parliament for years , but so far it failed to have the majority stand behind it . 
  any form of autonomy has to be accepted through the romanian parliament , and with the romanian society as well . 
  it is very important that there is an opening towards the romanians living in szeklerland . 
  ok in that case , why is the south of kosovo richer than most of western europe ? 
  i do n't think that area in kosovo is particularly rich or has a dense population ... 
  very interesting but what does this map show ? 
  what does `` below 0,2 '' mean ? 
  that in the given km ^ 2 the sum of all people 's money is less than 200k euros ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/avram_iancu  in the fall of 1848 , instead of fighting the regular armies , his units killed more thousands of unarmed hungarian civilians in aiud ( formerly nagyenyed / srassburg ) and nearby villages , considered ethnic cleansing or genocide that is why hungarians ( and not just nationalists ) will consider him a murderer . 
  because he murdered civilians . 
  just like arkan . 
  avram iancu is the same kind of person as arkan was during the yugoslav wars . 
  some people think arkan was a hero , other that he was a monster , the truth is he murdered civilians , plundered entire regions for his own profit and saved a few serb villages from being captured . 
  the question is , do you think murdering innocent civilians and ruining the relationship between two peoples for decades is excusable if your side gaining a little . 
   how many people came out to protest does n't really matter at this point . 
  it matters when it 's a high number . 
  when it 's just 100 people protesting then you can dismiss them as loonies . 
  when it 's a significant portion of the population then it means serious business . 
  people do n't just go out and waste their sunday on a political issue they do n't care about . 
   you make it seem as if romania is discriminating against its hungarian minority when this is not the case . 
  no , i said : `` they are obviously not satisfied with whatever rights romania is currently guaranteeing . '', 
  maybe romania is showering them with candies and everyone gets a golden balloon but it does n't matter , because these people want autonomy and they say it out clearly . 
  you can continue to claim that they have perfect rights and that romania follows all conventions and everyone is guaranteed everything but that is obviously not true if you have people demanding more rights . 
   the only way to solve this issue is by holding a referendum that 's a false policy because the referendum would obviously be held on the territory of the whole country and the majority will reject it . 
  and i believe a referendum about territorial change would be illegal anyway , according to the current constitution ... more than a decade ago there was a referendum in serbia about whether kosovo should get autonomy and it was rejected with 99 % i believe . 
  the kosovo albanians did n't even go out to vote because they knew it was a farce . 
  there was no austria-hungary in 1300 , for example . 
   i doubt there was a country named `` hungary '' that existed from 900 until 1900 & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;, 
  i 've read it somewhere a few days ago . 
  it is estimated that today 120 thousand people went out to protest . 
  there are around 1,2 million hungarians in romania . 
  that means 10 % of all hungarians went out to demand autonomy . 
  they are obviously not satisfied with whatever rights romania is currently guaranteeing . 
  if the romanian politicians continue to ignore these demands and continue as if nothing is happening then it 's going to radicalize the people and they will sympathize with extremist parties . 
  the problem is the regions are planned to be drawn so that the hungarians are a minority in all of them . 
  the hungarians here are demanding a single region where they would be the majority . 
  so if an extremist political party exists in hungary then it 's `` not the right time '' ? 
  are you saying there never will be a right time ? 
  because extremist parties will * always * exist . 
  edit : and they gain popularity thanks to the romanians, 
  why is this not the right time ? 
  result : france interesting . 
  i did like the french countryside , the food , the wine , but i do n't think i would like the french if i learned to speak their language . 
  i was worried when i looked at that chart but then i saw it 's not adjusted for ppp . 
  it makes the rankings a little more balances . 
   luckily , because we 're in austria everything is just a little bit corrupt and not done by the book , so when she missed hers the dude backdated it . 
  that 's news to me . 
  i thought austrians are uncorruptable . 
  i could be wrong here but i think nik\u0161i\u0107 was the first capital of montenegro . 
  in case of hungary , although sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r literally means `` white capital city '' , i think the real capital was in esztergom . 
  in those days you did n't have capital cities in the modern sense and the capital was wherever the king was located . 
  the first christian king was born in esztergom and spent most of his time there so perhaps that should be considered the first capital . 
  did n't you read my post beyond the first sentence ? 
  there are many laws that are morally wrong . 
  laws do not have to follow a sense of morality . 
  instead , they have to be made to be enforcable , which means they have to fit the mentality of the majority population . 
  it 's a deterrent . 
  this is why in some countries you have laws that the death of someone does not cancel his debt and his family will have to pay for it - so that it reduces the number of suicides . 
  again , you have to look at the profile of suicide bombers . 
  they are very family-oriented people so they will kill themselves because they think it will help their family . 
  if this incentive is taken away then they wo n't do it , and there 's no need for punishing anyone . 
  i know that this sort of law is unfair in theory but we write laws to suit human nature , and not to suit a set of abstract rules about morality . 
  this is a good idea if you look into the causes of terrorist or suicide attacks . 
  most of these men are poor , with poor families , and are often unmarried . 
  in traditional societies you can not get married if you 're too poor because the father of the bride wo n't allow it . 
  if they get killed then most often their families will get some reward from the terrorist organization , which will allow the terrorist 's brothers to find wives . 
  so it 's considered a noble thing . 
  i do n't like chrome 's dominance in europe . 
  this is what i meant when i wrote  which lead to hatred that is still visible today [ some horrible things ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1848%e2%80%9349_massacres_in_transylvania ) happened between the hungarians and romanians in 1848 and the people who did it are still celebrated ( for example , avram iancu ) . 
  if instead of a war we had a slow and boring democratization then we probably would n't be arguing now . 
   good on them for imposing the exact same regime after the compromise . 
  romanians did the same shit after trianon ... 
  there was an article a few weeks ago that in germany they changed the name from `` cigany snitzel '' to `` ungarische snitzel '' because the local roma community complained . 
  the irony is that it 's not called a cigany ( gipsy ) snitzel because it has anything to do with gipsies , but because the recipe was invented by a guy named b\u00e9la cig\u00e1ny , so it was named after his last name . 
  it 's the same irony as with the [ negro ] ( http://www.szeretlekmagyarorszag.hu/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/negroall.jpg ) candies , invented by pietro negro . 
  and then 50 cent travels to hungary , sees these sold everywhere and thinks it 's racism . 
   will the european union still exist ? 
  the capital of the eu will be moved to the faroe islands , far from the nuclear wasteland that is the benelux . 
  vice-president philippe continues to hold his grip on the power by bringing the mummified remains of eternal president van rompuy with him . 
  the european council at this point has only 83 members as the rest were either executed or died in the nuclear holocaust . 
  the americans and chinese have vowed not to stop the bombing until the european union ceased to exist . 
  little do they know , a secret mini-eu is being built on the dark side of the moon ...  what about the economy , is there any reason to think that the depression in the south will get to an end ? 
  after most of the industry was moved to the south the economy there has gone to even worse , despite some expectations . 
  since most of the population moved to germany in the previous decade - which got nuked - what remained are the politicians and the immigrants that are treated as slaves .
