   2 : so you 're suggesting we become a society where the poor are left to die ? 
  no , we become a society where the poor are not enjoying an advantage over the non-poor in taxation , education , healthcare etc. 
  there should be incentives for coming out of poverty . 
   3 : ` just lower taxes = better for all ' is ridiculous , trickle-down reaganomics nonsense that has been proved not to work . 
  the us you 're idolising so hard is a great example of this . 
  are you saying the us economy is in worse shape than the eu ? 
  do you see the us having serious trouble in the future because of its increasingly senior population , or is this instead more true for the eu ? 
   4 : calling young people who are leftist ` maoist ' ? 
  seriously ? 
  i was referring to the political background of the currently incumbent president of the european council , but you obviously did n't catch my reference . 
  you do n't seem to know much do you ? 
  i mean , other than empty slogans ...  5 : this - is due to the things that you are advocating . 
  rightist policies such as lowering taxes for the rich , mass privatisation and the gutting of society into ` me me me ' is what has created a system where the people of today will not be able to enjoy the same standard their parents did . 
  no ... the economy is in such bad shape because the socialist governments spent all money and the future generation 's money and the future generation 's children 's money on stupid shit like 13th salaries and crippled any hope of growth by making in impossible to fire people . 
  this is why europe is becoming less competitive while the us is becoming better and more efficient all the time , not to mention china and other developing countries . 
  the reason why today 's youth is investing into private pension funds is because they hope the government ca n't take it from them . 
  in 40 years when it 's time for them to retire , there wo n't be any money left because of a 200 % gdp debt ... 
  so they ( = we ) can either continue to work when we 're 80 years old , or die , or live from the money we saved ourselves . 
  let 's hope those incompetent parties are gone for good . 
  europe has been spending too much money on shit it does n't need and this is why it has n't had a decent gdp growth in the last 5 years ( while the us , for example , has ) . 
  the young people realize that they will have to work all their lives to maintain a system they will probably not enjoy , * because * of a system set up by their parents . 
  so it 's natural that they will turn more to taking care of themselves and not letting the government do it for them . 
  for example , private pension funds [ are becoming more popular ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/social/blobservlet?docid=4853&amp;langid=en ) . 
  most of europe 's growth nowadays comes not from manufacturing but from research and technology , and people working in those sectors are , by nature of their job , not unionized . 
  this means less support for the left , which is traditionally a blue collar , collectivist party . 
  the people who are earning more do n't always agree that they should be taxed more so that the poor could continue living on welfare . 
  for this reason they will vote for parties that encourage lower taxes and less support for the poorest . 
  i think europe 's left needs to reform itself , get rid of its current cadre made up of maoist youth and start working in the interest of the largest political group , which is the white collar , educated class . 
  oh no it 's not that horrible  ) it 's something more [ like this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6pd4yhxram ) , but very very loud . 
  as in , no one is talking in the cafes because you ca n't . 
  sewer goes directly to the beaches , i went there maybe 10-15 times in my life ( blame my parents ) and every year someone got sick . 
  extremely loud serb country music in all cafes , sometimes you can find one cafe where they have different music but even if you sit down you will hear the neighbors ' ~ ~ screams ~ ~ music . 
  many beaches are `` private '' so you have to pay to go there . 
  because of this at some places it 's almost impossible to go to the beach for free . 
  montenegrins are not really famous for being good in the service sector . 
  waiting 1 hour for a coffee , or getting yelled at by the waiter is not unusual . 
  well maybe that has changed , i have n't been there since 2003 and i never intend to go ever again . 
  yes , unless it 's trick-or-treat time . 
  then i even turn off the lights . 
  finally i learn something useful on this stupid forum !, 
  c'mon be open minded a little . 
  after the slavic invasion all of macedonia became slavic-speaking . 
  this means there were pockets of `` original '' macedonians here and there . 
  after a few hundred years they forgot their language and were absorbed into the majority population . 
  that does n't mean they have lost their culture , only that they 've switched language . 
  i 'm not saying that you 're wrong and i know that the ancient macedonians were essentially greeks . 
  i 'm just saying you can not prove that today 's macedonians are not related to the ancient macedonians . 
  you have to prove that modern macedonian culture is 100 % non-greek and that the people living there are 100 % not-genetically-descendants of macedonians , and you ca n't do that . 
  so it is entirely possible that they are descendants of alexander or pyrrhos . 
  and also it 's possible that they are not . 
  it ca n't be proven . 
  what , we were playing ? 
  those losers were probably just happy to get a free trip to the netherlands . 
  i still do n't see any proof that today 's macedonians are not direct relatives of the ancient macedonians . 
  it 's perfectly normal that they have lost their language , just like for example the bulgarians have . 
  that does n't mean they are n't the direct descendants of the ancient macedonians . 
  the `` evil eye '' , as far as i know , is an italian custom . 
  perhaps you got it from the venetians . 
  or modern greeks thinking they have anything in common with the ancient greeks . 
  compared to the total world population it 's less than ever before in history, 
  ah cool , then all is well . 
  i think it 's incredibly useful that kids learn two writing systems . 
  i see that dz is missing . 
  if you 're going to include zh , ch , sh or two kinds of th , then why not go all the way ? 
  afaik latin is not thought in schools anymore , so newer generations will probably not learn it . 
  pretty sad ... 
  alt gr does n't work for me , it just tries to open menus and stuff :(, 
  well the case against the croatian pm has been around for years but they never managed to prove any involvement of mol . 
  i did n't think they would actually go into a political fight , but now it seems obvious that they were just waiting to get in the eu . 
  mol bought the share of the croatian ina back when that company was on the verge of bankruptcy , it invested billions into renewing old equipment etc. , and now when it 's healthy again the croats want to take it back . 
  no problem , just pay for it and i 'll be the happiest person . 
  it 's estimated that a buyback would increase the share price by 30 % instead of doing this , they start a political smear campaign against the ceo probably with the goal of reducing the share price so low that they can actually afford to buy it back . 
  how they managed to pull interpol into this is a surprise for me . 
  no he 's a genocidal monster !, 
  is n't he nominated like every year ? 
  i 'm pissed because i have mol shares and this news made the price hit a year low . 
  i lost almost 100 euros in the past few days . 
  fucking croats and their corrupt politicians , ** they could n't even prove that their prime minister was guilty for accepting a bribe ** , and ** there is no evidence at all that the ceo of mol is guilty for bribery ** , and ** he is n't even charged for anything ** . 
  they just want him in for questioning . 
  so how can you post an international arrest warrant and have him among al qaeda terrorists , when he is n't even charged ? 
  if this is n't a politically motivated witch hunt then i do n't know what it is , perhaps the croats feel they can behave any way they want now that they 're in the eu . 
  they basically destroyed this guy 's career , imagine if bill gates was charged by bhutan for bribing some minister , and then the interpol issued an arrest warrant ? 
  i would give a shit how they behave in their own country but when they make me lose money it 's difficult to not get angry ... 
  in this specific case the ceo is not accused of anything , the croatian court only wants him in for questioning . 
  it 's weird that you can have an international arrest warrant on your head if you 're not even charged for anything . 
  i lived in slovenia for a while and it was easy to integrate . 
  i speak serbian and the languages are similar , i started speaking pretty good after about a year , without going to a language school . 
  the culture is a little bit different but not that much . 
  what 's sad is that hungary and romania are building roads to reconnect the border villages and towns , something like 200 new crossings are planned i think , some are already built ... and you ca n't have these crossings opened while romania is not in schengen because you would have to put a ramp and border office on every one of them . 
  france ( and before them , the netherlands ) is deliberately hurting the integration and economy of this region because of their own racist hipocracy . 
  last month a hungarian company named docler ( which operates porn sites but that 's irrelevant ) announced that it is moving its staff and headquarters to luxemburg to avoid hungarian taxes . 
  it 's a huge company which last year paid more than 1 billion forints in taxes . 
  since they moved now , that 's around 3,5 million euros of lost tax revenues to hungary . 
  my point is simply that companies move in the other direction as well . 
  http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dutch_sandwich many companies are opening representations in the netherlands only to avoid higher taxation in other eu countries . 
  in this way the netherlands is exploiting its eu membership to siphon away funds from other eu countries . 
  if some companies moved to the czech republic the revenue lost is miniscule compared to the damage your country is causing to ireland for example . 
  thank you , 
  you can live more than comfortably in budapest for that money . 
  average salary is around 700 eur , an apartment + expenses is 300 euros , the rest you can spend on food and boose .
