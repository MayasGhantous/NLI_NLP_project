  so far i only saw something like this in thailand where everybody stops and starts singing the national anthem at 6 pm . 
  it 's really weird if you 're an outsider , 
  ** hungary ** * pretty hot all week , yesterday it was 40 \u00b0 c but thank god for swimming pools * hungary won the world championship in waterpolo * hungarian swimmer daniel gyurta won his 3rd gold medal * new taxes kicked in starting august 1 , now we have to pay 6 % ( in addition to 16 % ) on the profit made on bonds , stocks or bank account * the ozora festival was banned in the last minute possibly because last year the police found massive amounts of drugs, 
  i was living in slovenia for several years . 
  it 's beautiful , but exactly because of the mountains it can get very cold . 
  for example in the trenta valley some days it was 10 degrees in august . 
  last year though serbia won in the `` best hungarian paprika '' contest . 
  i 'm still surprised no one knows about that but then again who cares ... 
  2nd biggest synagogue in the world and 2nd longest word in the world  and most nobel prize winners per capita . 
  i think the similarity between hungarian and turkish can be seen in the following sentence : zsebemben sok kicsi alma van . 
  it 's not just that the words are the same , but also the suffixes ( - em / - en , - ben / - de ) are the same , and the grammar rules work exactly the same . 
  van ( = `` exists '' ) works the same way as var . 
  when you go to a store in the uk you ca n't ask the clerk `` does apple exist ? 
  '' , while in hungarian and turkish that 's exactly what you would say `` elma var ? 
  '' , in the sense that it means `` do you have any apples ? '', 
  vowel harmony works the same way . 
  when i learned that the plural in turkish is - lar/ler , it was natural to me to pronounce * any * noun in plural in turkish , because i knew when i should use - lar and when - ler . 
  because there 's so many similarities i find it hard to believe there is n't some common ancestor . 
  they get electricity that they pay for . 
  the deal was that there will be one nuclear plant built in slovenia and another in croatia , and both republics will finance it . 
  after the one in slovenia was built , slovenia decided to seccede from yugoslavia . 
  your power plant was built with croatian money and you make croatian households pay for the electricity , 
  there 's a wikipedia entry about it . 
  the word is of romanian origin , it means placenta . 
  the food is of hungarian origin where it 's called palacsinta , it was taken over by the czechs who called it palachinke and the austrians got it from them and named it palatschinke . 
  there are palacsinta shops on every 50 meters in hungary in lots of varieties . 
  you 've never been to hungary ? 
  cheer up , at least you screwed those croats over with the nuclear power plant in krsko which both republics financed but only the slovenians got to use , 
  he hunted rhinos with dynamite, 
  i see , so this statement of yours  we have n't conquered/enslaved/colonise ... anyone ... anyone , except you conquered the germans in marburg , the hungarians in prekmurje ... oh and germans and hungarians could n't vote by law in the 1920s so that 's kind of enslavement . 
  and then you colonized those areas so today they 're almost 100 % ethnic slovenian . 
  hmm hmm and you committed war crimes against yugoslav soldiers at holmec , and stripped tens of thousands of serbs of their citizenship . 
  when will the shamefest finally begin ? 
  i 'm not saying you 're worse than your neighbors , only that you 're not better than them at all . 
  it 's a self-delusion that you 're small and thus automatically innocent . 
  you also conquered marburg and its majority german population ... which went down from 82 % to 0 % in less than a hundred years . 
   inventing the palatschinke does that word sound german to you ? 
  we have n't conquered/enslaved/colonise ... anyone . 
  so , no need for slovenian post-colonial shamefest . 
  yay !, 
  you took prekmurje from hungary and colonized it with slovenians from triest . 
  not fighting against the foreign invaders in 1918-19 . 
  fighting with the foreign invaders in 1941-44, 
   you are very much wrong , i do n't want to see people wiped off the map . 
  i do n't agree israel should have been forced into creation . 
  you have n't answered my question . 
  israel has been created and that 's the situation we have today . 
  now what ? 
   i 'd guess from your region that 's only because i put out my region why you 're hiding behind anonymity . 
  in this thread i defended muslims too , so you guessed wrong . 
   i am an anti-zionist zionism advocates the establishment of israel in the holy land ( ie . 
  where today 's israel is ) . 
  if you 're an anti-zionist , then you advocate ... the destruction of israel and the `` disappearance '' of its population ? 
  or what is anti-zionism for you ? 
  i 'm just asking because it seems to be acceptable today to be an anti-zionist . 
  for me that 's just a nice way of saying you want israel wiped off the map but maybe i 'm wrong ...  israeli expansion into palestinian territories uninhabited desert  it threatens all of our safety . 
  it most certainly does n't threaten my safety . 
   it mocks the un the un has more arab member states than israeli member states . 
  if we would allow for the rule of majority then i guess your anti-zionist dreams would quickly become true and we could have a nice final solution for the jews . 
  but luckily , the founders of the un were wiser than that and added veto votes to a few states . 
  the arab dictatorships need to redirect their people 's rage at an outside enemy and israel is like the christmas tree . 
  they can claim that there 's nothing they can do cause america is preventing them from doing it , so they stay in power forever and even get some naive european sympathizers . 
  the palestinians in israel had the choice of staying in israel and share the state with the jews , instead they decided to fight in an all-or-nothing war , and they lost . 
  after that , they moved over to jordan from where they launched attacks and convinced the other arabs to hate the jews too . 
  however , after some time the palestinians decided they do n't like the jordanian king and tried to depose him , so the jordanian king had to expel them . 
  the palestinians then went to lebanon where the muslims were a relative minority , and turned that country into a civil war hellhole which today has a muslim majority . 
  some questions : 1 . when will jordan stop the occupation of palestinian territories 2 . when will the palestinians stop the occupation of lebanese territories 3 . why do n't they all just get a job instead of living in refugee camps for 50 years ( and who finances those camps anyway ? ), 
   look i know we 've been bad ... but we 're not the only one as long as the eu takes it in the ass from the us and russia i do n't care what israel is doing . 
  the jews are a too easy target , which is why pussy europeans are hating them . 
  it 's difficult to stand up to the us , russia , and probably china too , so let 's try and bully a small , democratic country of 7 million that is economically mostly dependent on europe and needs us . 
  so you 're like an atheist jew ? 
  ah you detected the words `` jews '' and `` rats '' close to each other and suddenly you remember that lesson from political correctness class that you 're not allowed to do that otherwise people might think that you 're racist . 
  so you make the words more spread apart , so everyone understands what you 're saying but they ca n't call you out because you can just call the other person crazy and play the innocent . 
  and then go home and masturbate to photos of auschwitz . 
  but let me get back to this `` point '' you were trying to make :  disagreeing with the foreign policy of israel ! = badmouthing jews . 
  who in this thread has disagreed with the foreign policy of israel ? 
  of course i am , just look at some of the comments in this thread . 
  no , let 's not . 
  just look at ** how many ** comments there are in this thread , which is barely a few hours old . 
  the closet-racists felt provoked and had to unleash their hatred of the jews , but they ca n't say what they really think since they think of themselves as highly cultural and obviously superior to those dirty jews and niggers . 
  so they silk-wrap their words in stuff like `` i have nothing against jews but ... '' and `` israel is great however ... '', 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cat-burning  cat burning was a form of zoosadistic entertainment in france prior to the 1800s this shows you 're not really 19th century french :  what ? 
  you have more in common with jews today than french from 100 years ago . 
  my grandfather was in the kassa concentration camp so that probably makes me a 2g or 3g holocaust survivor too . 
  and i want the flag up there . 
  yeah but egypt ceased being european after the 7th century . 
  closet-nazi scum by definition badmouth jews without using any curse words . 
  they have to do that because if they said what they really think , that jews are rats , that they should be exterminated , then they would get banned . 
  this is why i hate political correctness , it makes it too easy for racists to hide . 
  i would n't know , i do n't see anything wrong about israel . 
  you should probably lay open your thoughts here but i suspect the mods would probably delete your posts if you did that . 
  hmm and / r/niggers has been locked too ... where can people like you find safe harbor from zionist terror ? 
  current local identities did n't exist 100-150 years ago so there 's not much to threaten . 
  your ancestors burned cats for fun and genocided religious minorities . 
  do you identify with them ? 
  it 's weird to me that you find that weird . 
  it 's just a flag , who cares ? 
  woo i 'm part of a meme !, 
  maybe i oppose the polish flag because of my closet-hatred for poland . 
  maybe next time there 's a polish flag up there i 'll argue that we should use a belgian flag because it 's the belgian king 's daughter 's causin 's uncle 's birthday .
