  i did n't see one good argument in this thread which would explain why people are bothered by the israeli flag . 
  the continent argument is bullshit . 
  the occupied territories argument is weak since there are plenty of other occupied territories that no one cares about . 
  until someone makes a rational argument why the israeli flag is not appropriate for / r/europe i have no doubt that everyone arguing against it is a closet-racist . 
  it was historically part of europe until at least the 7th century , a few hundred years in the 12-13th century , and then again since 1948 . 
  if i wanted to be offensive i could say it was on european maps longer than sweden . 
  turks took over the byzantine empire and they did n't assimilate it in a day . 
  eastern roman culture remained there for the next 1000 years , greeks and armenians were living there until 1918 . 
  after 1918 turkey changed to a secular country . 
  so you can say that there was never a period when turkey was a uniform country with a single heritage . 
  hmm proof that ** parts ** of turkey is more european than ** parts ** of france ? 
  easy .

  they come out when it 's full moon . 
   ever has been and never will be , by any definition that 's ever been in common use . 
  you 're one of those people that still think europe and asia are not the same continent ? 
   i do n't support it . 
  why do you oppose discussion ? 
  would you throw a nazi-fit-of-rage if it was ? 
  i think istanbul is a very mixed city , so you have atheists and fanatics too ... but tekirdag , izmir or trabzon felt very eastern european to me . 
  the people are nationalists and not religious ( in izmir they even laughed at islam being nonsense when talking to me ) . 
  the buildings look like belgrade . 
  the people dress like in eastern europe ( including girls in tight jeans or miniskirts ) . 
  they drink raki which tastes almost like metaxa . 
  of course in eastern turkey it 's like an arab country . 
  my point is it 's a large country and you ca n't define them as `` a muslim country '' . 
  too much birthmarks , otherwise hot, 
  turks on the other hand have a lot in common with greeks , which is not surprising since they assimilated a lot of greek culture . 
  the turks in western turkey are culturally 100 % europeans . 
  you on the other hand seem to be part of the proud 19th century european culture of racism . 
  some parts of turkey are more european culturally than france is . 
  you should travel more , maybe you 'll lose some of that racist hatered you seem to cultivate . 
   they are not on the european continent ** you 're ** not on the european continent . 
  who the fuck allowed you to use that flag in / r/europe ? 
  interesting thread , gathers all the closet-racists in one place . 
  keep on hating you disgusting worms . 
  i disagree, 
  wrong . 
   please do not try and hang a certain twisted logic on to me . 
  it was you who brought up norway in the first place , and what i said about norway is rather simple and true : the point is ** i ** do n't know that because i have n't read on the subject . 
  i 'm trying to point out that * even less * people know what 's happening in hungary which is why someone can claim that hungarians do n't care and then you have this whole thread with people crying how gypsies are living like the jews in ww2 . 
  that post has been deleted btw . 
  the thread starter has deleted his account as well . 
  i suspect this was just a one-off trolling attempt and / r/europe is just eager to badmouth hungary so you all took the bait . 
  i think this is because the government is particularly anti-liberal so it conflicts with the philosophi of most ( young ) people on this forum . 
  but that does n't mean they 're right * or * that they 're the majority . 
  they are only the majority on this forum . 
  and although i do n't particularly agree with the fidesz government i still hate listening to * lies * about my country . 
  i do n't care what the dutch government is doing , it has no power in hungary . 
  the us however does . 
  russia has played the divide and conquer game in eastern europe , we now pay more for gas than western europe . 
  where 's the united european front when you need it ? 
  true , but in this video they mostly used words that are of latin origin in english . 
  for example , they could 've used words like belief , fatherlike or hardship and then suddenly the video would n't be funny anymore . 
  `` compared to ** latin ** languages '', 
  the less the better . 
  prism . 
  gas deals . 
  the added flavor to this issue is that i personally do n't agree with discriminating products that come from the west bank . 
  so this law was pushed by a pro-palestinian lobby with whom not everyone agrees with . 
  i think we can agree that the us and russia are more damaging to the eu than israel is . 
  however , they actually have the muscles to fight back . 
  there are n't enough ( competent ) programmers . 
  my company has a plan to hire ~ 100 developers this year and i think they managed less than 30 so far . 
  there are tonnes of outsourcing companies in eastern europe, 
  autonomy is owned by hp . 
  there was a scandal about it , the ceo of hp got sacked for paying too much for it . 
  there 's lots of stuff made in israel , like tooth paste , soap and sticking bandages ( hansaplast i think ? ), 
  i discovered this when i traveled to syria and they sometimes check if you have anything in your bag that 's `` made in israel '' . 
  it 's remarkable how quickly society changes . 
  i know ~ 15 years ago i wrote on some forum how gay people should be beaten up in school so they would turn out straight ... cause that 's what everyone thought ... and today i ca n't believe that it was me writing that . 
  but the post is still there online ... :(, 
   most of the drug dealers are white hungarians proof or you 're racist . 
  did it ? 
  you know i do n't know about that , cause i have n't heard anything on the news . 
  which according to your logic means that they have n't stood up for the victims and they are evil and ignorant . 
  here are some articles about hungarians expressing their grief for the victims and/or outrage towards the purpotrators : [ remembering the roma murders ( 2013/02/24 ) ] ( http://ujszo.com/online/kulfold/2013/02/24/a-romagyilkossagok-aldozataira-emlekeztek ) [ remembering the roma victims ( 2013/02/23 ) ] ( http://mno.hu/belfold/a-tatarszentgyorgyi-gyilkossag-aldozataira-emlekezett-az-emmi-1140879 ) [ paintings in remembrance of the victims ( 2012/02/23 ) ] ( http://www.bodvalenke.eu/emlekezes-cigany-sorozatgyilkossag-aldozataira ) [ former pm shows up during trial to show his support ( 2011/04/05 ) ] ( http://ujszo.com/online/kulfold/2011/04/05/gyurcsany-ferenc-is-megjelent-a-romagyilkossagok-targyalasan ) [ roma and non-roma organisations remembering the victims at the cemetary ( 2010/02/23 ) ] ( http://www.romnet.hu/hirek/2010/02/23/tatarszentgyorgyi_gyilkossag_-_emlekezes_az_aldozatokra_az_evfordulon ) [ gypsies are part of this nation 's body - former president ( 2009/02/28 ) ] ( http://c-press.hu/200902284375/belfold/solyom-nyilatkozott-a-roma-ugyben.html ) [ this wikipedia article ] ( http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_tat%c3%a1rszentgy%c3%b6rgyi_gyilkoss%c3%a1g ) i wo n't translate them . 
  really , i 'm getting tired of this shit and anti-hungarian hatred on this subreddit . 
  i 've been on this subreddit for almost 2 years and the only positive thread i 've read about hungary was the one that i posted myself . 
  you people wo n't check any facts , so just downvote away ... 
  to be specific , they were charged with 5 counts : premeditated murder , mass homicide , endangering many people , murdering people younger than 14 years and `` evil intent '' ( not sure what a better translation would be ) . 
  a few of these charges carries a life sentence . 
  but no , they were n't charged with terrorism . 
  you should probably ask the prosecutor why not . 
  perhaps it 's more difficult to prove ? 
  my bad . 
  let 's rephrase : since this incident , has there been any other ? 
  if yes then it could be a larger problem . 
  if not then it could be a one-off incident . 
  breivik murdered 69 teenagers but i do n't see anyone calling the norvegians names . 
  i wrote civilized * environment * which is a completely different thing than a whole country . 
  an environment can , for example , mean a single family . 
  a family where the mother is an alcoholic whore and the father is in jail and the kids are sniffing glue while avoiding school is not what i 'd call civilized in the 21st century , but maybe you have a different definition so i wo n't go further with this . 
   why the relatives of these dead apparently have n't been able to claim such compensation is , of course , a different question ... you should probably ask them why they have n't filed the required forms . 
  i see , and countries that do n't have victim compensation are not ** civilized ** ? 
   you seem to have a good crack at it , though . 
  now you 're just becoming personal . 
  did i hurt your feelings ? 
  it might seem strange now but 20 years ago gay people were afraid to `` come out of the closet '' in the us too . 
  you can say that montenegro is `` just '' 20 years behind the us .
