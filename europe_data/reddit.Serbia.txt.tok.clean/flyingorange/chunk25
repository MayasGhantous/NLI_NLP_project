  that 's great , now stand up to russia or the us you pussies . 
  fidesz was in power in 2008 ? 
  til, 
   in many countries , you will , as a matter of fact which countries ? 
  the pdf you linked to says a country * proposed * that victims should get financial support . 
  i can also * propose * that they should get golden balloons , that does n't mean anything . 
  let 's put a few shades into this black-white case . 
  the principal target of the attack was a known drunkard and violent man . 
  the murderers were vigilantes , they wanted to make an example of what happens when gypsies behave out of control . 
  i do n't want to defend their actions cause it ca n't be done , but this is most certainly not a `` pure '' hate crime . 
  events happened prior to the murder that should 've been dealt with in a more civilized manner , had the victims lived in a more civilized environment . 
  i do n't think anyone is denying that this is a hate crime . 
  the murderers are being tried for hate crime induced murder , they will most likely spend the rest of their life in prison ( the highest punishment under hungarian law ) for killing people for being what they are . 
  this is why i said the title and article are sensationalist , because it make it seem like hungarians are roma-hating monsters that do n't care about what happened . 
  i mean c'mon there 's a [ wikipedia article about it on the hungarian wiki ] ( http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_tat%c3%a1rszentgy%c3%b6rgyi_gyilkoss%c3%a1g ) , you think people would invest their time if they did n't think this was n't important ? 
  no more terror attacks . 
  i remember someone posting about this a few days ago , back when there were only 45k votes . 
  good job !, 
  who says there 's no public sympathy ? 
  i 'm not sure what is it that you expect , the pm to fall on his knees and appologise to the family of the victims ? 
  since i 've already received a lot of downvotes i do n't care , let me put this into context for you : people get killed . 
  sometimes because of their skin color , sometimes their ethnicity , sometimes because of the way they walk and sometimes cause they 're in the bad place at the wrong time . 
  just because the victims in this case happen to be a minority does n't mean that all minorities are treated like the jews in nazi germany ( which the thread starter implies ) . 
  if some guy gets killed in a car accident will you claim car drivers are endangered in hungary ? 
  the victims got as much sympathy as any other victims , perhaps even more . 
  they certainly got more media attention . 
   and the family has not received any significant financial aid . 
  let 's say someone from my family got killed , and we 're not roma . 
  will i get money ? 
  other than the angry mob , is the majority of the population against the current government ? 
  you mean 2008 ? 
  did you read the article ? 
  how about that part where the criminals got arrested and tried ? 
  the article itself is sensationalist . 
   debt-to-gdp ratio unfortunately for slovenia , this ratio will not be different from greece in the near future . 
  greece is reducing its debt while slovenia is only at the beginning of its own financial crisis . 
  the szekelys are definitely more nationally conscious since they actually have to fight for their culture . 
  * excellent beer ( the best beer i 've ever tried was german but overall 70 % of the best beers in the world are belgian ) * expensive chocolate * `` french '' fries * tintin , spirou , asterix , lucky luke , isnogoud , umpah pah * crazy molecule building * piss-boy * they have red-white license plates and not black-white like the rest of the world * some cool train stations from the 19th century * jews with beards and sideburns running with suitcases full of diamonds * sunflowers growing in the center of antwerp * congo free state * telex, 
  that 's what i figured . 
  if most hungarians do n't care then i guess it 's not a big issue . 
  no i hear enough angry nationalism on tv already . 
  i 'd just like to know the truth . 
  you have n't even read what i wrote . 
  fine , i 'll answer your questions * one more time * , even though i 've already answered them . 
   ** for how long are we going to give rural development aid to individual areas ? 
  forever . 
   ** have we evaluated the rural development aid ? 
  for many more years are italy going to receive it ? 
  they are going to receive rural development aid as long as they need it , or as long as the eu exists , whichever ends first . 
   ** when are spain , greece , portugal , ireland etc going to be net donors , not recipients . 
  when they start contributing more than they receive . 
   may i ask , and i really like for you to answer this - what do you have against goal , planning and evaluation ? 
  give me several good reason why the eu should not have plans , set goals and the evaluate the result . 
  why do you dislike it ? 
  i think it would be a lot better if we had it . 
  ** i have nothing against goals , planning and evaluations . 
  the eu does have plans , goals and it does evaluate the results . 
  you should note that it 's a huge organisation so it sometimes takes time for all the evaluations to come in , but they do . 
  if they did n't , then we would have a [ list of wasteful projects ] ( http://www.openeurope.org.uk/content/documents/pdfs/top50euwaste2010.pdf ) . 
  someone evaluated those projects too ... to turn back to what i 've already said but i probably should 've emphasised cause you did n't read it or did n't notice it 's importance . 
  ** sweden is benefitting immensely from other eu countries ** , not only financially but also through other means . 
  spanish oranges may be expensive but your grandparents did n't even know what oranges were . 
  not to mention the high-tech project in lund which employs hundreds of physicists ( = educated and paid for by other countries ) from all over europe and is financed by the eu ( = greece among others ) . 
  as i said , this is a positive-sum game . 
  everyone benefits . 
  spain gets money to build roads . 
  sweden gets smart people to build an accelerator . 
  ** this great thing should never end ** and the plan is that it ** never will ** . 
  this is why your question asking for a date when `` italy will become a net contributor '' does n't make sense , because it 's not set by a date , nor is it in anyone 's interest to have a set date . 
  i 'm not really convinced that you 're genuinely interested in knowing the answers for your questions . 
  you have already been given links by a few people in this thread , to documents that would be a good starting point to finding out where your money is going and what they 're planning to do with it . 
  the eu is very transparent with regards to how it spends the taxpayer 's money so you can always find this out by your own research . 
  and there are other ngos that specifically look at the money being spent and highlight those that are wasteful . 
  i can remember , for example , that one such organisation discovered 500 euros being spent on drinks for no apparent reason . 
  yes there are billions being wasted for example on sicilian railroads , but even small amounts are noted . 
  my point is , the information is there , you just have to look for it . 
  but i do n't think you really want to look for the information and instead you just want to argue with people here . 
  unless someone on this forum is a professional eu budget controller , i do n't think you will get a good answer to your question ie . 
  you 're wasting your time . 
  i personally think that the eu 's budget is too complicated for you to get single-sentence answers or even single-page answers . 
  why is it good that greece is getting more money that it gives to the common budget ? 
  perhaps because the fact that the eu wo n't let one of its members fail gives reassurance to investors who wo n't take their money someplace else . 
  the improved infrastructure in spain allows spanish fruit to be delivered to your swedish supermarket at a much reduced cost compared to 30 years ago . 
  if you ask your parents or grandparents they will probably think of a few fruits and vegetables that did n't exist ( in sweden ) when they were young . 
  now you have that , and you get a more diverse diet = healthier = you live longer . 
  there are many other reasons i could think of , like being poor increases the chance of being a failed state which increases the change of war which negatively affects the whole continent in more ways than just economically , so it pays off to keep everyone happy . 
  since spanish , greek people have a relatively similar standard of living and education to swedes , they are free to move to sweden and work on some highly profitable ventures ( like the spallation source in lund funded by the eu ) , while had they been living a 3rd world lifestyle they probably would 've struggled to learn how to use escalators let alone learn nuclear physics . 
  the question you 're really asking is when will there be a date when all of this will end . 
  in my opinion it should never end , poor countries should always receive money from rich countries in order to balance the world out and make everyone more equal . 
  there is direct and indirect benefit for all parties , this is not a zero-sum game . 
  serbia has no serious industry and everything is owned by monopolies connected with the government . 
  this is why , for example , there is no lidl or tesco in serbia , and people are forced to buy low quality products for higher price than higher quality products in the eu . 
  so i do n't feel sorry at all for any `` businesses '' that may go bankrupt if serbia ever joins the eu , because almost all of those businesses were established unfairly or through crime . 
  member for less than a month and you already oppose other countries joining ? 
  we need cash crops to sustain the 80 + average lifetime expectancy with quality food . 
  you can go back to bread and water but then say goodbye to 30 years of your life . 
  how much are you personally giving , igelkotten ? 
  where 's / u/metaleks now ? 
  i saw him posting a dozen times that the majority of serbia is against eu based on latest polls , and now we can see that the latest latest poll shows he 's full of shit . 
  yeah i bet he 'll posthumously care that the government feels sorry for castrating him,
