  today there is a `` danger '' sign on that road : https://maps.google.com/?ll=46.429013,16.714368&amp;spn=0.017304,0.027595&amp;t=h&amp;z=15&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=46.42924,16.706017&amp;panoid=liuptjxhqkkmxiqmoexv6g&amp;cbp=12,341.58,,0,3.55 ( see in street view ), 
  montenegro mountains + romanian drivers = deadly combination i was going once with a romanian bus from slovenia to hungary , but the bus started in madrid and was already 2 days on the road . 
  the driver was driving like mad , bypassing cars in tunnels etc. 
  i arrived safe but a few days later heard there was a large accident on the slovenian/hungarian border where many people died . 
  the driver was coming from spain and when he arrived to romania , they did n't let him sleep and just ordered him to drive the return trip as well . 
  serbia is pretty much devoid of tourists since everyone just goes to see belgrade . 
  if you like camping i recommend that you go to the area between tara and zlatibor , here are some pictures : uvac river canyon : [ pic1 ] ( http://zlatiborsmestaj.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/283uvac.jpg ) , [ pic2 ] ( http://www.blic.rs/data/images/2011-01-02/104704_rezervat-uvac02_f.jpg?ver=1294001168 ) tara mountain & river : [ pic1 ] ( http://opusteno.rs/slike/2012/06/nacionalni-park-14999/srbija-planina-tara-16.jpg ) , [ pic2 ] ( http://sinisastevovic.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/rafting-tara-kanjon.jpg ) mokra gora : [ pic1 ] ( http://www.apartmanibozovic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mokra_gora_01.jpg ) , [ pic2 ] ( http://www.penmorfa.com/jz/83-052%20jatare%20-%20mg%20061005.jpg ) you can find other pictures by typing in `` tara '' or `` zlatibor '' into google . 
  generally that area is touristic but only tourists from serbia go there so it 's not at all flooded , prices are very cheap ( rafting etc. ) . 
  one of those rivers ( not sure which , tara perhaps ) is flowing through a tectonic break so it 's like 500m deep . 
  the locals are generally very friendly but perhaps not everyone will speak english . 
  another 2-3 day trip would be [ djerdap ] ( http://www.srbija.travel/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/djerdap_golubac.jpg ) , that 's the danube bordering serbia and romania and the national park stretches from golubac to donji milanovac . 
  it 's very beautiful and there 's also an archaeological site of a 10000 year old culture in vin\u010da , and a stone inscription by emperor trajan when he crossed the river to conquer dacia . 
  actually , as someone who travels between hungary and serbia , the food prices in serbia are * higher * than in hungary . 
  which leads me to doubt the accuracy of this data . 
  of the top of my head , a 0,4 kg bread in serbia costs 42 cents , while a 1 kg bread in hungary costs 53 cents . 
  some things are cheaper in serbia , like milk and sugar , but almost everything else ( cheese , meat , salt , flour , eggs ) is more expensive . 
  does marxism give you a good erection , ginjeet ? 
  that was a nice article . 
  anyway my take on why italian small businesses may go bankrupt is my experience with italian small businesses over ebay : they do n't speak english . 
  there were sometime some cool stuff that i wanted to buy , i see that the country of origin is italy , i write a message in english and i get back a reply 3 months later , not even related to my question . 
  nowadays when i see something on ebay is from italy , i just ignore it , no matter the price . 
  i 'm convinced that they will not deliver . 
  if italian small businesses want to survive in a * globalized * market today , then they need to do at least as good as the chinese and learn fucking english . 
  the czech president is a fuck asshole . 
  i did n't like him from the moment he made his nationalist comments on albania . 
  it 's a shame that he got elected , i really hoped the other guy would win . 
  wars are n't started that lightly nowadays , especially not between allies . 
  though i ca n't remember ever in history that an ally arrested another ally 's head of state ( it did happen i guess ), 
  i do n't really know what that proves , that the average hungarian is intolerant or stupid or both ? 
  is there a similar research done in the neighboring countries so that we could compare the results or is this just so we could laugh at the hungarians ? 
  btw . 
  is that photoshopped ? 
  this is why i never joined the intelligence service . 
  imagine that every day you have to listen to boring phone calls . 
  meh you do n't need to take everything seriously in life . 
  that picture looks like something out of the simpsons , with nelson and the other bullies kicking someone . 
  if that does n't make you laugh then i do n't want your upvote , 
  what grace ? 
  btw . 
  watched the video , it 's just a rehashing of the old propaganda . 
  * orban 's government quickly passed 600 laws and changed the constitution - yeah that 's why the people voted for them ; they 're doing what they promised to do * they put their own people everywhere in power - that 's what governments tend to do , no ? 
  the people that got replaced were similarly put into their seats by the previous government so where 's the misunderstanding here ? 
  * economic policy really messy and orban will lose a lot of votes because people feel this - the economy is actually doing better than most eu countries i think i 'll stop at this point , these posts always get downvoted so no need to put more effort into it . 
  it 's a bot . 
  it searches for posts with wrong $ signs and replies the same message everywhere . 
  and then dollarsignbottroll replies with the `` your mom costs 5 $ '' message  ) ), 
  yeah , this forum is full of nervous people . 
  boys will be boys ... \u2661, 
  * police is very strict ( 1000 eur fine if you do n't wear a helmet while driving a bike ) * not a good place for hitchhiking, 
  how does that work for other , more white-collar companies ? 
  in my company we need to dress `` business casual '' which has a predefined set of items that men and women can wear . 
  women do get to wear skirts which i guess is more comfortable for them than it is for me during summer cause i have to wear long trousers all the time . 
  if i wear a skirt to work then can i also claim to be able to do that based on anti-discrimination laws , or will i get fired for not following the sexist dresscode ? 
  i 'm actually surprised that he was so young . 
  i thought he was the same generation as philip k dick . 
  rip . 
  the ec complained about 3 things in the constitution : 1 . something about judges moving their case to another judge under some conditions , not really clear 2 . political ads during election campaigns can only be shown on public tv 3 . special tax on telecommunication companies that go against eu regulations i do n't really know which two out of these three are going to be modified but i think it 's # 1 and # 3, 
  yeah i generally do n't like flags with complicated symbols on them . 
  i imagine children in schools have to draw then for homework and if the flag is easy then it means less homework . 
  i love these comments :  )  kriso13  mr. ponta , do not be worried , our leader umi\u0142wany already six years doing everything to poland caught up with romania . 
  you no longer have to do . 
  for anyone interested , here 's orban viktor 's youtube channel where you can see his heroics  http://www.youtube.com/user/1orbanviktor?feature=watch edit : oooh i see his latest video shows him spending the night with the common people , 
  afaik poland is pretty ethnically homogeneous thanks to uncle stalin . 
   an amendment to romania 's new constitution , defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman alone , effectively banning gay marriage copying hungary i see ? 
  i thought ponta was on the opposite side of the political spectrum to orban . 
   although the comission rejected a very pro-church midification to the article regarding religious denominations , the text will probably be included in the new preamble of the constitution . 
  ugh that 's sick  the concept of \u201e regions '' has been introduced , besides the existing counties and communes . 
  anything about the szekely autonomy ? 
  it seems like a very conservative constitutional change . 
  it 's surprising for me cause i thought the liberals were in charge in romania ? 
  is there anything being prepared about the floods ? 
  i asked my family down there and they say no one is talking about it , no sandbags are being prepared ... 
  in hungary there are sandbags for 800 km along the danube and the river is almost 9 meters high in budapest ( max capacity is 9,3 m so if shit breaks loose there will be massive floods ) ... there 's no way that the water will go down when it reaches novi sad or belgrade . 
  i really hope that the authorities wo n't get `` surprised '' this time . 
  like i said , read the rest of the thread . 
  i already explained why i think this video is racist . 
  you 're obviously not interested in what i think so no need `` to be honest '' since you 're not . 
  read the whole thread . 
  i explained my point elsewhere already . 
  read the subthread in this thread where i argue with the thread author . 
  the video itself is racist , posting and defending it makes the author racist himself . 
   it is 100 % neutral `` the germans are teh best '' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upd7g1wkw28&amp;feature=player_detailpage&amp;t=136s `` but immigrants do n't bother learning german '' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upd7g1wkw28&amp;feature=player_detailpage&amp;t=158s `` they take our hard-earned money '' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upd7g1wkw28&amp;feature=player_detailpage&amp;t=243s those are just some excerpts . 
  the whole video , starting with a depiction of how in romania they still use the horse and live in dirty villages , and ending with a message that these horsemen will all come over to the german paradise , is a not-so-covert example of germany 's politically correct racism . 
  it 's smart enough that perhaps people who are not targeted by it ( western europeans ) wo n't notice . 
  it does when you 're arguing with a stereotypical racist like the thread author . 
  i think i hit his nerve by pointing that the germans were doing the exact same thing they 're complaining about right now . 
  also , there were other similar threads in this forum lately so i got a bit annoyed by them . 
  because `` kettle calling the pot black '', 
  no , you already fit my racist expectations based on your original post . 
  i was just wondering if you 're also coward enough to hide behind the `` i do n't have any strong feelings about this issue '' curtain . 
  you performed well . 
  yeah that 's the politically correct answer . 
  i 'm sure you 're a super-tolerant treehugger , you just post videos that portray immigrants [ in a negative light ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upd7g1wkw28&amp;feature=player_detailpage&amp;t=243s ) because that 's a karma goldmine in this forum , right ? 
  in case of hungary , they were invited by the habsburg emperor who thought ethnic hungarians were too rebellious . 
  the hungarians did n't have proper representation so you ca n't say they invited or wanted the germans to settle in the best lands , leaving the shitty lands to everyone else . 
  ok i guessed that you 're shocked . 
  i obviously ca n't know what is your emotional reaction . 
  what is it ? 
  amusement ? 
  shock ?
