  joy ? 
  you find them amusing ? 
  yeah that was my reaction to your thread as well . 
  i 'm waiting for the next one where germans will get `` shocked '' by the filthy subhumans from eastern europe . 
  too bad you could n't extend the moratorium on employment beyond 2011 eh ? 
  enjoy it when doctors cut your leg off . 
  this is what i 'm doing too . 
  every month i 'm putting away 10 % of my net salary and buying bonds or stocks . 
  hungary has something even better than the 401k : you put assets in an account and after 5 years it becomes tax free ( unless you remove money of course ) . 
  there are also private pension and health funds , you contribute a few % of your gross salary ( your net salary wo n't be affected ) and they invest it in bonds , after 10-15 years it also becomes tax free . 
  these funds are n't super profitable but they do beat the inflation . 
  at current rate and unless my salary increases , by the time i 'm 60 i 'll have the equivalent of 300k euros ( or around 500k with inflation counted in ) , which is a very nice sum in eastern europe . 
  and i 'll also get the regular pension from the government ( unless they cancel it as some doomsayers will think ) . 
  remember when the germans moved to eastern europe in millions ? 
  why does malta have a flipped-poland flag ? 
  maltese is very similar to arabic so it can be considered the only `` arabic '' language that is written with latin characters . 
  this was interesting for me cause i always wanted to know what arabic sounds like and i could n't read the letters . 
  i also know they have some porn software company cause they wanted to recruit me once , 
  exactly . 
  imagine how much easier it would be to just write j\u00e9\u00e9rse k\u00fa\u00farija t\u0151\u0151 , 
  hungarian has 40 ( not including x , y , q and w ) . 
  for me what does n't make sense is how the finns ( and perhaps estonians ) write everything with double letters . 
  for example : `` mit\u00e4 kuuluu '' in hungarian would be `` mite k\u00fal\u00fa '' . 
  saves space , 
  so since the last 3 words are in plural it should be urrssss no ? 
  so the ussr was uussssrr ? 
  ok , estados unidos , what about the second e and u ? 
  yeah , if you own a flat in london and rent it out , you can move to se asia and live there without ever having to work again in your life . 
  at least that 's what some folks do ... 
  notice how places with significant turkish populations have the best economies . 
  us is eeuu in spanish ? 
  welcome to eastern europe . 
  if you do n't want to understand then of course it wo n't be familiar . 
  well `` j\u00f5vv\u00f5 '' would be `` j\u00f3 '' , and the way '' \u016bom\u00f5gt '' ends with a - t tells me the noun is the target of the action , or whatever that means in grammartalk . 
  i could also be wrong about the - t because other words do n't end with it . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livonian_language ) :  enjoy your meal !, 
   good morning !, 
  - j\u00f5v\u0101 \u016bom\u00f5g !, 
  / j\u00f5vv\u00f5 \u016bom\u00f5gt !, 
   good day !, 
  - j\u00f5v\u0101 p\u01dfva !, 
  / j\u00f5vv\u00f5 p\u00e4uv\u00f5 !, 
   one -- ik\u0161  two -- kak\u0161  three -- kuolm  four -- n\u0113\u013ca awww that all sounds familiar to my hungarian ear . 
  sad that this language does n't exist anymore ... :(, 
  yeah me too . 
  i did n't think someone would actually do it . 
  there is no 1kg of potato :(, 
  sad what happened to one of the heroes of slovenia 's independence movement . 
  same for me but it was supaplex , 
  i agree that it 's nothing special ... but why would a baguette be special ? 
  it 's just bread ... has no special taste , no special smell . 
  you use it to fill you up . 
  whoa i pay 200 $ in budapest but my flat is half the size !, 
  if i was swedish now would be the time to invest in appartments in greece . 
  cool , that 's the actress from hair !, 
  which movie is that ? 
  is french bread the one that is long ? 
  in that case the hungarian bread tastes the same , except it 's not long . 
  [ here 's a picture ] ( https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-g42xsmpejge/tnzjsc4gw-i/aaaaaaaabyg/xxxr1hgqmqy/w800-h800/2010.10.22.kenyer.jpg ) , nothing special as you can see . 
  wonderful people , awful history . 
  first the bad stuff : they appeared on hungary 's border at around 1390 and we ( hungary ) were in constant war with them until 1526 . 
  their strategy was basically to settle * akanji * soldiers on the border , these were light horsemen who avoided all military confrontation and instead just burned and pillaged the land . 
  most of southern hungary became depopulated because of this . 
  in 1526 they won a great battle near mohacs where the hungarian-czech king died as well . 
  as a consequence , the habsburgs inherited the throne and never let go . 
  in the next 150 years there were constant wars between the habsburg and ottomans , the central part of hungary ( = today 's hungary + some areas around ) became totally depopulated , think the 30 years war in germany but for 150 years . 
  take any city in today 's hungary and between 1526-1700 it probably did n't exist at some point . 
  the ottomans destroyed every city , every village in their path , they burnt down the greatest library at szekesfehervar so now the hungarians only have a patchy knowledge of their history prior to that time , they dug out the graves of our kings etc. 
  the good thing is they introduced bathing to our filthy people and some of these baths still exist today . 
  i 've been to turkey and they 're wonderful people , they consider hungarians to be a related people . 
  it 's true that their language is similar to ours , the grammar is similar and there are lots of common words . 
  they are also very friendly and hospitable , have great food and in general i think they 're better persons than most europeans . 
  too bad we were on the opposing sides of history . 
  a record amount of water is approaching budapest right now , water levels have n't been this high for 50 years . 
  here 's the article in hungarian : http://www.origo.hu/itthon/percrolpercre/20130603-nyakunkba-zudul-a-duna-percrol-percre.html, 
  i sell you a submarine for $ 105 and you promise to pay for it within a year . 
  a year goes by and you only have $ 100 . 
  where 's the $ 5 going to come from ? 
  i want my $ 105 and i want it * now * !, 
  i think they actually want to make spain more * competitive * against countries like china and brazil , it wo n't necessarily create more jobs . 
   it is not `` borrowed '' money -- it is taxpayer money do you know how a deficit gets financed ? 
  you 're trying to suggest socialism does n't work ?? 
  is this your first day here ? 
  ctrl + f `` kim lane scheppele '' left-wing propaganda found . 
  was not disappointed almodozo !, 
  keep up the good work comrade !, 
  tropico was made in bulgaria ? 
  cool !, 
  yeah but your homeless and unemployed people now must resort to violence and other methods to get their money . 
  in serbia at least there 's an industry ( standing in line ) where they can make a decent living . 
  that 's normal in serbia . 
  if you want to get an id card ( which is an obligation and it also expires every 5-10 years so you 'll do this many times in your life ) you need to either : a ) bribe someone b ) have a relative or friend working at the police station c ) stand in line at midnight and wait till 7 am when they hand out the numbers ... i ) you can then return later to do your id card ... ii ) or you can sell your number to someone who 's more desperate d ) you can buy the number from someone who was standing there all night ( or ask a friend or relative to stand for you ) the wonders of bureocracy . 
  i went with a ) because i did n't have the time . 
  no , that 's not `` by my logic '' at all . 
  what about the remaining 8 numbers ? 
  are they also similar between german and japanese ? 
  if there 's only a 10 % match then the two languages are n't related . 
  if there 's at least a 50 % match then some relationship exists . 
  troll somewhere else with better arguments ... 
  ein indeed does n't sound like yek , but then you have other dialects of german where you 'd say en , and from there it 's easy to make ein -  en -  yen -  yek zwei -  twei -  two -  du it does n't have to be a direct link .
