  you just have to use your imagination a little . 
  but i agree that it 's closer to slavic than to germanic languages . 
  one interesting thing about persian is that they also like to combine their words into really long ones , using the same logic as german . 
  hahaha this guy is great , i sometimes read pages of his collected quotes  he told a british tourist who was visiting budapest , hungary : '' you ca n't have been here that long -- you have n't got a pot belly . '', 
  there are some clues that can be used to find languages that belong to the same group . 
  some words change very little , for example numbers . 
  ett tv\u00e5 tre fyra fem sex sju \u00e5tta nio tio that sounds familiar , does n't it ? 
  to prove i 'm not making this up - hungarian and finnish are in the same group . 
  i ca n't understand finnish at all , it 's like chinese to me , but if you look at the numbers : | | * hungarian * | * finnish * | | : -- | ------------- | ---------- :| | 1 | egy | yksi | | 2 | kett\u0151 | kaksi | | 3 | h\u00e1rom | kolme | | 4 | n\u00e9gy | nelj\u00e4 | | 5 | \u00f6t | viisi | | 6 | hat | kuusi | | 7 | h\u00e9t | seitsem\u00e4n | | 8 | nyolc | kahdeksan | | 9 | kilenc | yhdeks\u00e4n | if you take into consideration the h -  k change which appears in other words as well , then you can see that 1,2,3,4,6 are the same . 
  in hungarian 7-9 are of unknown origin . 
  so there 's a 50 % match between languages that ca n't understand each other . 
  or check this out : | | * german * | * iranian * | | : -- | ---------- | --------- :| | 1 | ein | yek | | 2 | zwei | du | | 3 | drei | se | | 4 | vier | chvar | | 5 | f\u00fcnf | penj | | 6 | sechs | shesh | | 7 | sieben | heft | | 8 | acht | hesht | | 9 | neun | neh | 1,2,4,6,8,9 are kind-of the same . 
  a 50-60 % match . 
  and now let 's see turkish and mongolian : | | * mongolian * | * turkish * | | : -- | ----------- | ---------- :| | 1 | neg | bir | | 2 | khoyor | iki | | 3 | gurav | \u00fc\u00e7 | | 4 | dorov | d\u00f6rt | | 5 | tav | be\u015f | | 6 | zurgaa | alt\u0131 | | 7 | doloo | yedi | | 8 | naim | sekiz | | 9 | es | dokuz | | 10 | arav | on | only dorov is similar to d\u00f6rt , so it 's a 10 % match . 
  i 'm not a linguist but there are other such tests which all fail in the case of mongolian and turkish . 
  as others have said , the theory that they 're the same group came from the racist 19th century when saying `` they came from the same place '' was counted as a valid proof . 
  korean for example also comes from that same place , and is recognized as a language isolate not related to either chinese or mongolian . 
  how can people accept that korean is different from mongolian but ca n't accept the same for turkish ? 
  i 've talked to an uyghur guy ( turkic minority in china ) who says he can understand turkey-turkish but mongolian not at all . 
  one reason why some scholars confuse uyghurs with mongols is that the mongolians conquered the territory where the uyghurs lived and they took over the uyghur alphabet , so that when europeans look at an uyghur or mongol book they think it 's the same thing . 
  kind of like how many people think persian and arabic are the same . 
  and also historically saying that you 're `` the mongols '' was cool cause it instilled fear in your enemies . 
  so some turkic tribes did that . 
  kind of how the hungarians like to identify with the huns although they 're completely different people/languages . 
  just because you 're not trying does n't mean you do n't understand swedish . 
  the huns were turkic-speakers ... and the seljuq turks were in asia minor after manzikert 1071, 
  turks say they ca n't understand mongolic at all, 
  this is more of an ethnic map than a language map . 
  read the book [ the better angels of our nature ] ( http://www.amazon.com/dp/1455883115 ) , it deals exactly with this issue . 
  it seems that before the invention of cities , violence was around 150 times greater than right now . 
  same was observable with native indians and some isolated tribes in the amazonas and indian ocean today . 
  hmmm you 're right , looks like this light blue one is the flag : http://static.rtv.rs/slike/2013/03/20/novi-sad-kej-tvrdjava-petrovaradin-zastave-zastava-vojvodina-tanjug-jaroslav-pap_660x330.jpg but i do remember there was some chess championship and the flag they used was the same as the cot of arms . 
  or maybe that was just my imagination . 
  i wo n't rest until my city flag is accepted here  http://www.novisad.rs/sites/default/files/imagecache/800xxxx/images/novi-sad-grb.png, 
  as far as i understand it 's not decided yet . 
  i hope this does n't happen , romania was on a good track to become a clean energy leader . 
  `` erd\u0151 '' means forrest in hungarian . 
  even today transylvania is a relatively wild , forrested part of europe , and was much more so a thousand years ago when the hungarians arrived . 
  if there were any romanians living there at the time they probably would 've called it dacia . 
  the link given above by milquero affirms the hungarian origin of the word , while the romanian origin makes some dubious claims ( barber of romanian origin ?? ), 
  transylvania itself means `` land beyond the forest '' ie . 
  if you observe it from budapest , then there is indeed some forests to pass through before arriving there . 
  had it been of romanian origin it probably would be `` beyond the mountain '' ( as observed from bucharest ) . 
  there are other geographical names , for example : rivers k\u00f6r\u00f6s ( meaning it 's curvy ) -  cris ( does n't mean anything ) mountain zar\u00e1nd ( meaning pilgrimage ) -  zarandul ( no meaning ) city nagyv\u00e1rad ( great castle ) -  oradea ( no meaning ) etc. 
  of course there are many places in transylvania that are of non-hungarian origin such as satu mare , carpathians , dej , jiu ... 
  i thought he was catalan, 
  which country ? 
  in usa you have people named coca cola , pepsi , nike etc. 
  i think that 's pretty unique , 
  but you also have wladimir ? 
  and they were black too !, 
  you must feel really superior today i bet . 
   it 's difficult to find something unique as most names either originate from christianity , the latin language , other languages , or are pan-slavic . 
  it does n't have to be perfect . 
  for example the hungarian b\u00e9la obviously is of slavic origin ( although it 's a male name ) , and zolt\u00e1n comes from turkic sultan ... 
  i think yan is used in english ( and also ian ) , which is pronounced the same way as the czech jan. 
   come on spain , please be more memorable . 
  have you heard about the spanish inquisition ? 
  this is off the top of my head . 
  i apologize if i wrote some names wrong ... romania : ceausescu , gheorge gheorgiu-dej , victor ponta slovakia : ludevit stur czech : safarik , tomas masarik , jan hus austria : bach , mozart , metternich germany : goethe , hitler , adenauer poland : donald tusk , karol wojtyla , marie curie lithuania : jogaila denmark : hans christian andersen , lars von trier sweden : alfred nobel , carl x gustavson , wallenberg norway : quisling netherlands : spinoza , van gogh , mercator belgium : leopold ii france : napoleon , gerard depardieu , sarkozy uk : tony blair , queen victoria , shakespeare ireland : james joyce , jon swifth portugal : henry the navigator , magellan spain : carlos ( habsburg ) , salvadore dali , gaudi italy : mussolini , berlusconi , leonardo da vinci slovenia : janez jansa , jakub aljaz , franc preseren croatia : tudjman , nenad brixy , severina bosnia : izetbegovic , nele karajlic , dodik serbia : milosevic , zoran djindjic , vuk draskovic montenegro : petar petrovic njegos , momir bulatovic , milo djikanovic macedonia : tose proeski kosovo : hashim tachi , ibrahim rugova bulgaria : samuel , asparuh greece : jorgos papandreu , socrates , plato russia : catherine the great , putin , lenin belorussia : lukashenko ukraine : aleksandra tymoshenko i left out hungary since i 'm hungarian . 
  sorry finland , estonia , latvia , malta but i could n't remember anyone famous from your country . 
  edit : finland : linus torvalds ugh how could i forget about him !, 
  usa = country eu = not a country notice the pattern . 
  that 's just your view of the world . 
  the americans i know do indeed pick on other americans ( texas vs california ) , and the democrat/republican divide is more ferocious than most political divides in europe . 
  just because in your experience the europeans pick on each other more than americans do does n't mean that 's the general rule ( and in * my * experience the opposite is more true ) . 
   if the usa californians think texans are gun-firing and backwards , texans hate liberal newyorkers , in west virginia everyone is an inbread hillbiliy etc. 
  you 're not so much different than the europeans you criticize . 
  wow sweden is fucking poor ... 
  not really , this is something that i read years ago . 
  by googling i did find some sources : [ this excel file ] ( https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0ceeqfjae&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ggdc.net%2fmaddison%2fhistorical_statistics%2fhorizontal-file_03-2007.xls&amp;ei=qzgauynzlm-vswbc_ygiag&amp;usg=afqjcnho2idevcj3r216gelvrdpi6dbtvw&amp;sig2=tzq9adjcni4mhrjrsf4hlw&amp;bvm=bv.46751780,d.yms ) says that italy 's gdp/capita in 1910 was 2332 , while austria 's was 3290 . 
  according to [ another source ] ( http://books.google.hu/books?id=vgijmuyjqawc&amp;pg=pa130&amp;lpg=pa130&amp;dq=czech+gdp+per+capita+1910&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yy8kuzhwxh&amp;sig=9uuiyjcfnkmtzam_h1al9qh-pfi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=qzgauynzlm-vswbc_ygiag&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=czech%20gdp%20per%20capita%201910&amp;f=false ) the czech gdp/capita was 120 % of the austrian average , which would make 3948\u00a03948/2332 = 1.69 so it 's less than i remember , but still the point remains . 
  to go further with this claim , hungary 's gdp/capita was 80 % of austria 's so that 's 2632 . 
  even that 's higher than italy , so the east/west divide was n't exactly how people imagine it today . 
  before ww1 the czech gdp/capita was around 8 times higher than in italy, 
  slovakia was poorer than hungary 10 years ago . 
  they 've been doing very well since the 2000s . 
  i remember when i got downvoted to -20 for claiming that turkey is richer than its neighbors . 
  here 's this map in your face , muslim-hating fuckers !, 
  greenland has more light than north korea . 
  \\ #you 're welcome, 
  i loled at the sign, 
  yeah everyone can speak at least shitty english , only the bitch from belgium insisted on her french . 
  thanks for the 12 points germany !, 
  ^ ( ( not sure if germans really liked our shitty song or if it was hungarian immigrants voting ) ), 
  looks like i wasted my money . 
  hungary awarded 0 points to dracula :(, 
  they did n't get enough points so far . 
  i do n't think they can win anymore ... :(, 
  let 's see them votes ... 
  were there men or women ? 
  netherlands was depressing and boring . 
  i think she was singing about dead birds ? 
  tbh malta was pretty good , but you ca n't compete against vampires or free alcohol . 
  i voted for the vampire lady , but they 're also our neighbors . 
  195 forints , that 's 66 cents in hungary, 
  14 right ? 
  ireland to go and then the voting can start . 
  the songs were pretty boring this year , it looks like most teams have some managers and producers who design songs that are statistically the most popular , so they all sound alike and are all forgettable . 
  i liked romania , greece , azerbaijan and moldova .
