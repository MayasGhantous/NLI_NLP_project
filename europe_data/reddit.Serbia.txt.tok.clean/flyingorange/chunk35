  i pity his students who are probably brainwashed marxists themselves , most of them .

  pay your debts , \u017di\u017eek !, 
  why are crazy people given space in newspapers ? 
  i can also write crazy stuff and blame x on y. 
  so this guy has a degree in philosophy , so what ? 
  does that make him an expert in financial crises ? 
  this guy is a self-admitted marxist , a follower of a theory that was proven wrong in the 19th century , only a decade after it was formed . 
  i 've noticed articles by \u017di\u017eek posted on / r/europe several times already . 
  why are people even paying attention to this charlatan ? 
  they 'll do it , if not now then in a couple of decades . 
  the generation that fought the wars in yugoslavia is now 40 years old , so another 30 years till they die , and perhaps serbia can join the eu . 
  where 's opera ? 
  in hungary a portion from your gross salary goes to healthcare , a portion goes to pension fund . 
  there are also options to send some of that money to a private healthcare or pension fund . 
  if you lose your job you may apply for social security and i 'm not sure how it works but i think you 'd get only 80 % of the minimum wage for no more than 12 months . 
  you would also need to pay for your own healthcare , which is around 20 euros/month . 
  if you do n't pay for healthcare you 'll still get free treatment at the doctor/hospital , but eventually you 'll get fined through taxes . 
  even if you 're employed , you wo n't pay for the healthcare benefits of your spouse . 
  she has to pay for herself in case she 's unemployed . 
  your children are covered until they finish university or begin to work . 
  also , a woman will get some benefits if she 's pregnant , it 's around 100 eur/month . 
  i 'd go with amsterdam because i hate northern cities due to the weather . 
  there was a danger of romania going `` yugoslav style '' and if i remember correctly the hungarian and romanian parties sat down and decided that it 's best to talk and settle things so they would avoid a bloody conflict . 
  this was in 1990 or 1991 , when the war already started in croatia , so everyone could see how horrible inter-ethnic conflict can be . 
  so you see at that time neither hungary or romania were in nato/eu etc. 
  and war was very much possible because there were wars everywhere in the former soviet block so it would n't be a big deal . 
  but it did n't happen . 
  why do you think anything like yugoslavia can happen now when both countries are in so many common organizations ? 
  you just do n't like hungarians , do you ? 
  just admit you 're a nationalist and you do n't care about valid argument so that i wo n't have to waste my time with you in the future . 
  yeah just like how the czech republic can put pressure on britain for oppressing its citizens living in the uk . 
  totally valid argument . 
  slovakia * right now * is discriminating its citizens , hungary complained to the eu , and the eu said it 's a sovereign matter . 
  how do you think hungary can put pressure on anyone if the eu wo n't even protect basic human rights ? 
  if you do n't like this news source then pick one of the other ones that are also reporting the same : * http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/130401/cyprus-did-president-urge-laws-withdraw-bank-deposits-bailout * http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/23036/52/ * http://news.gather.com/viewarticle.action?articleid=281474981865228 * http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/04/02/cyprus-controls-idindee93108r20130402 * http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2013/04/02/18734576.php * http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-rt-us-cyprus-bailoutbre9310dm-20130402,0,4643880.story and according to google there are 504 other news websites reporting the same thing . 
   as an anecdote , my 50-year old mother always brings up how the government gave young families interest-free loans on apartments , but she has nothing to say when i ask her if she thinks people right across the border in austria were homeless all this time since they did n't have the glorious party to give them housing . 
  my mother ( who was born and grew up in yugoslavia ) also says this same thing , how everyone got housing for free , while today the reality is there are many homeless people . 
  in this matter communism was indeed better than the current system . 
   49 % of romanians state that life before december 1989 was better in romania , while only 23 % think it was worst , and 14 % think it was the same . 
  is this serious ? 
  i was only 7 at the time but i do remember my parents talking about romanians like today we talk about north koreans . 
  no way people can seriously say it was better under ceausescu than now . 
  i do n't know much about the internal affairs of russia but i do remember 2 cases which proved that it 's not a democracy : 1 . 
  putin won in chechnya with 110 % of the votes 2 . exile.ru was shut down by the government regarding # 2 , they did n't silence them by arresting the editors and throwing them to jail , but by harassing their creditors . 
  they soon ran out of money and had to shut down . 
  you can read more about this [ on their website ] ( http://exile.ru/blog/detail.php?blog_id=19265&amp;author_id= ) . 
  it 's debatable if the slovak government had the right to bring a law which discriminates based on ethnicity 10 % of the population . 
  i do n't think it 's prevailing , perhaps the view is dominant among some old people . 
  their view is also biased because the system they lived in did n't provide for their old age , so if they live in a bad situation now they blame it on the current system , which is just stupid . 
  they had elk lasagna ? 
  all i could see is swedish meatballs . 
  are you romanian ? 
  does n't romania have this exact same law too , and is giving citizenship to moldavians ? 
  you should stay quiet , you 're embarrassing yourself . 
  more like , the socialist government did everything they could so that the hungarians outside the borders of hungary would not get citizenship . 
  the new citizens remember this very well , it has nothing to do with them being more/less nationalist . 
  s\u00e1rk\u00f6zy means something like `` area of mud '' , perhaps a swamp . 
  szark\u00f6zy would mean `` area of shit ''  so yeah , originally it 's pronounced sharkeuzee . 
  you can vote in the elections ? 
  the slovak law is special and is meant to target hungarians living in slovakia . 
  [ if you 're a slovak citizen living in the uk and you apply for british citizenship , you 're not going to lose your slovak citizenship ] ( http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/slovakia-hungary.8jz ) because you have a residency in the uk as well . 
  in case of hungarians living in slovakia , their only residency is in slovakia . 
  if they move over to hungary , establish residency and apply for citizenship , then they wo n't lose their citizenship . 
  this law was specifically introduced as a * response * to the hungarian citizenship law . 
  they introduced it i think only 24 hours after the law was voted in at the hungarian parliament . 
  what 's hypocritical and discriminatory in my opinion is that [ people with slovak ancestry * not * living in slovakia may still apply for permanent residency visa ] ( http://www.diyexpat.com/immigration/slovakia.html ) , which is just a stepping stone away from gaining slovak citizenship . 
  for example , there are ethnic slovaks living in serbia , and most of them have slovak citizenship since the 1990 ` es . 
  is n't it s\u00e1rk\u00f6zy ? 
  like i said , the logic is similar to turkish or indonesian , so they do n't have trouble understanding this . 
  it 's only weird if your native language is different . 
  i myself am fascinated by arabic , i tried learning it a bit but it 's just too different . 
  it 's more different than chinese is . 
  imagine a language with no words , just a series of patterns . 
  what i 'm trying to say is , the troika is n't some shadow organization of evil aristocratic bankers drinking champagne in their castle and laughing at poor people 's misery - yes there are probably some people like that in the crowd but there are also people like me who bought sovereign bonds for whatever reason . 
  we bought the bond , we knew the risk , that does n't mean we 'll just give up our money without a fight . 
  the troika is not pressuring greece because it wants power but because they are under pressure as well , for example by investors and the general public . 
  if they do n't represent my interests then there will be some consequences , i 'm not sure about all the details but the management of the imf can probably be sued for mishandling funds , and they might end up in jail . 
  the eu politicians would only suffer politically . 
  this all would n't have happened if they just let greece fail right at the start . 
  but once they loaned them money , they became liable for the return of that money . 
  like i said , i do n't hold greek bonds , but as part of the whole deal i did pay , like everyone else , around 500 euros through taxes that went to greece . 
  if that money does n't get returned then it means a lower level of development for me and my country ( spread out over a long period of time so it 's not noticeable but it 's nonetheless there , for example displayed by a road not being built ) . 
  but then it 's a question of whether we really need more development if the people in greece are suffering , and since the eu is supposed to be all about solidarity etc. 
  ben_je_gek said it perfectly . 
  you hijacked a really nice story with your nazi bullshit , and your posts will most likely be deleted once the mods wake up ( i 've reported your posts do n't worry ) . 
  like i said , take your nazi provocations to a subreddit that cares . 
  before the crisis every eurozone bond was of the same grade . 
  they can of course go bankrupt and suffer the consequences . 
  there 's also that scenario which is happening with argentina right now , where they went bankrupt in 2001 and then some vulture fund bought the worthless debt from the creditors and sued argentina at a us court . 
  now a decade later they demand the money back again + interest , if they do n't pay the us could freeze argentina 's assets in us banks which would cause another bankruptcy . 
  not sure how that will play out , but anyway that is another possible scenario if greece decides that it wo n't pay its debts . 
  the troika is just a bunny rabbit compared to vulture funds . 
   and why all this hate for greece ? 
  i love the macedonian people . 
  i do n't hate greeks , i hate people that offend macedonians . 
  just because you 're a moron it does n't mean i hate all greeks . 
  no i do n't hold greek bonds ( i never buy below-investment grade bonds ) . 
  but if i did own greek bonds , i would want my government to pressure greece to pay up its debts . 
  they live in a territory called macedonia .
