  a better example is south slovakia where everyone is dual lingual and slovaks speak hungarian just as well . 
  this is why the hungarians there are n't asking for autonomy . 
  well textile can be made from plants too, 
  looks like someone did n't want to pay for a geological survey before building his house . 
  it seems the whole region is growing : hungary 3.5 % , slovakia 2.4 % , czech 2 % http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-05-15/east-european-gdp-growth-quickens-as-spending-exports-increase, 
  those neighbors also happen to include 2 million ethnic hungarians whose calls for autonomy have been ignored , and who are n't `` upset '' by this call . 
  so how about someone pay some attention to them as well ? 
  instead of acting like upset children , why not work on a solution to solve this problem ? 
  edit : and instead of downvoting , how about contributing to the discussion ? 
   a widely-popular voluntary agreement with the eu it was widely popular in the west of ukraine , not in crimea or the east . 
  there were videos posted here of how the euromaidan representatives were booed and beaten even before any fighting or russian involvement started . 
  i 'd rather have it like this , otherwise the block voting would kill all the fun in the show, 
  if you look at other countries in europe , ethnic minorities almost always have some form of autonomy . 
  for example catalonia , basque country , south tyrol , friesland , not to mention the various countries that make up the uk . 
  it 's sad that the countries where hungarians make up a considerable minority wo n't even consider holding a referendum to decide on an autonomy , and the eu does nothing about it since it considers it to be outside its jurisdiction . 
   they already have almost everything translated in hungarian in the counties where they are a large % of the population they do n't even have street signs translated in places where they make up 45 % of the population . 
  check [ a thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2556wt/petition_to_have_multilanguage_street_signs_in_a/ ) i posted 2 days ago . 
  i 've read an article a few years back that singing in english wins more points for you , because it feels more familiar to the masses . 
  i also prefer to hear songs in the native language but unfortunately if you want to win , you have to do what it takes to win . 
  cry me a river, 
  this is probably how the greeks invented to word barbarian in the first place . 
   orban 's party relies on hate of roma and other minorities to get some votes cute , but totally wrong . 
  the roma are one of the main groups of fidesz voters . 
  [ here 's a pretty picture ] ( http://static.origos.hu/s/img/i/1401/20140110valasztoi-csoportok.jpg?w=666&amp;h=674 ) which shows the groups that each party relies on . 
  notice `` rom\u00e1k '' in the orange circle . 
  now why would they possibly vote for a party that has  occasional slurs by fidesz leaders against the roma ? 
  unless you just made that up or possibly confused fidesz with jobbik . 
  i would recommend [ ca blues ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3551237-ca-blues ) from milan oklopd\u017ei\u0107 , which is in my opinion the greatest modern serbian/yugoslavian novel , but after googling i do n't think that it has actually been translated to any other language . 
  it was published in the early 1980 's and is about an artist who moves to california in the 70 ` es , the people he meets and his relationships , it 's truly fascinating to read . 
   and russia , unlike the west , is willing to lie we 've been at war with the west and i can assure you the bbc and cnn can lie just as ruthlessly as any media . 
  as the old saying goes , in war the truth is the first thing that goes out the window . 
  i like the friedrich-wants-helmet square, 
  ah yes , criticizing without checking the facts first . 
  [ lehel ] ( http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/lehel_%28keresztn%c3%a9v%29 ) is an old hungarian name , it probably means `` soul '' . 
  [ \u00c1rp\u00e1d ] ( http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%81rp%c3%a1d_%28keresztn%c3%a9v%29 ) is an old hungarian name , it is a diminutive of barley . 
  in this case , - d means small ( in archaic hungarian ) . 
  astoria is on the map where it should be , next to it is blaha lujza . 
  blaha is a slovak family name , [ according to google translate ] ( http://translate.google.com/#sk/en/blaha ) it means `` wellfare '' , although i guess it could be wrong . 
   pope john paul 2 square also does n't exist . 
  you have n't been to budapest recently have n't you ? 
  [ check google maps ] ( https://maps.google.com/maps?q=budapest,+ii.+j%c3%a1nos+p%c3%a1l+p%c3%a1pa+t%c3%a9r,+hungary&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;sll=47.481213,19.130303&amp;sspn=0.303029,0.837021&amp;oq=ii.+j&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=1081+budapest,+ii.+j%c3%a1nos+p%c3%a1l+p%c3%a1pa+t%c3%a9r,+hungary&amp;z=16 ) . 
  n\u00e9pszinh\u00e1z is a little to the left . 
  notice `` literal '' in the title . 
  what about golden john or red martin , that was ok ? 
   map featured in the german wikipedia : cool , ww1 borders, 
  because the polish were under german and russian occupation for over a century and the church was what kept their identity alive . 
  it worked similarly under soviet occupation . 
  czechs on the other hand were protestants who were force-catholicized by the habsburgs , so of course they 're not very enthusiastic about religion . 
  so what you 're saying is that the eu sucks ? 
   gruy\u00e8re http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gruy%c3%a8re_cheese seems to me gruy\u00e8re is ** located ** in switzerland , so the french had no right to take the name in the first place . 
  on the other hand , pro\u0161ek was made in dalmatia - not italy - centuries before italy existed as a country . 
  it is the eu 's fault for banning centuries old wines like pro\u0161ek because the word is similar to the italian word prosecco , and of course italy joined the eu first so they have the upper hand . 
  what about nord , sud , est and whatever you call west ? 
   if they commit a crime , punish them . 
  explain how . 
  let me set up the framework first . 
  if you give them a fine , they wo n't pay ; there are no bank accounts from which you may forcibly withdraw or freeze . 
  if you send two policemen to arrest them , you 'll have 20 armed men waiting for them . 
  if you send a squad , they 'll pack up and go elsewhere . 
  now , how would you `` punish them '' when they commit a crime ? 
   everything ends with a vowel yeah , like juventus and milan, 
  yeah finnish does n't have any `` rough '' sounds like sh , ch , or j , i 've no idea how did this happen since hungarian is supposed to be related and it 's 90 % these rough sounds . 
  what was the point of that ? 
  does sayonara sound mexican in spanish ? 
  so what you 're saying is turkish sounds like peasant hungarian ? 
   ) turkish is also one of my favorite languages , i just love their vowel harmony which produces sentences like t\u00fcr\u00fcm\u00fcnc\u00fcr\u00fcz m\u00fcl\u00fcnk\u00fcr\u00fck\u00fcd\u00fc b\u00fcl\u00fcnd\u00fcz ( not an actual sentence , that 's just what i hear ) . 
  i also like the dutch language and i bet it comes in handy when you need to clear your throat , 
  a friend of mine asked a slovenian once if he watched [ robotek ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robotech ) as a kid . 
  the slovenian was confused and asked , what robotek ? 
  ( little robot ), 
  homeless people are an unresolved issue in the city . 
  some homeless shelters and psychiatric hospitals were shut down so these people got out on the street . 
  also , beggars from all over the region go to budapest because it 's seen as the easiest place to get money from people , at least that 's what a homeless guy told me . 
  so in other cities you might see less beggars because they moved ( i 'm not saying of course that the beggars in bucharest went to budapest ) . 
   for example , the way media licences and fines are handled are very fishy ( vaguely written laws that can easily be used to make life very hard for oponents ) the media license issue you 're talking about was around 2 years ago i think , when an opposition radio lost its frequency on a tender because another company was offering more money for the same frequency . 
  they went to court and they managed to keep their frequency : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klubr%c3%a1di%c3%b3#2013:_klubradio_wins you 're wrong about the consitutional court thing as well , they changed it only that really old judges ca n't get reelected . 
  you can look this up on wikipedia too . 
   ( hungary is a prime example of that at the moment ) can you show some examples or are you just talking out of your ass ? 
  if getting a car for free is so horrible then why do n't you sell it and take the money ? 
  it 's not just that posts get downvoted , it 's that shitty posts belonging to one camp get undeservingly upvoted . 
  in the ukraine discussion i once complained about getting downvoted because i criticised ukraine , and was told by someone that this is because my posts do n't contribute to the discussion . 
  fine , so the next day i wrote some really long post with links and stuff and even if someone might disagree with what i wrote there , i did contribute to the discussion since i did generate a nice little subtree under my post . 
  in the end , my karma score was something like 80 upvotes , 78 downvotes . 
  the top comment under my post was a one-liner , something to the effect of `` yeah that 's what she said '' which did n't contirbute at all to the discussion , did n't get any replies , and was something like 50 upvotes , 10 downvotes . 
  the only pattern here is that you need to be pro-ukraine , and no matter how shitty your posts are , you 'll get upvoted . 
  and since the pro-russian posts get downvoted , you 'll end up with a low quality subreddit full of ukrainan propaganda . 
  following the advice of another guy here , i filtered out the words `` ukraine '' , `` russia '' and `` putin '' , and suddenly like 50 % of all posts are gone , and this forum feels much better . 
  [ this is what i see now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0dpiwee.jpg ) . 
  and just look at that , does n't it feel like a better forum ? 
  there 's something about spain , finland , switzerland , easter ... all interesting topics with relatively few upvotes/downvotes , and i 'd rather read these than another propaganda piece about the evils of russia . 
  hungary : if you 're just a regular worker then you need to report your taxes once a year by filling out an overcomplicated form . 
  basically you need to write how much you earned in 5 different fields , and then the taxes in 5 other fields , and you 're done . 
  you can also submit this with an e-application which is great since you do n't have to stand in lines , and it also helps you a bit with filling out the forms . 
  your company may do your tax forms for you by hiring a tax agency ( in my case , my company does n't offer this ) . 
  if you have stocks , pension schemes , bough/sold a house or done anything that 's not part of `` normal boring worker 's life '' , then you need to fill out additional forms , and this is where the gates of hell open . 
  this year i have it additionally complicated by having paid some taxes in austria so i have to demand that back , but also pay 10 % of the return money to hungary based on some agreement from 1973 ... it 's awful . 
  hungary : with all the taxes , insurance , pension fund etc. 
  36 % of my salary goes to the state . 
  which i think is pretty good compared to some other countries that like to take half . 
  yeah we 're # 1 b ),
