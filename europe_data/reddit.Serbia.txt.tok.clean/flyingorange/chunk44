  they certainly have more power than romania does . 
  this is because the netherlands has a larger economy than poland and so has more weight . 
  devaluation damages those that are n't unemployed , typically the middle class . 
  if i earn 100k forints but it 's worth 50k compared to the euro then the unemployed can go f * ck themselves . 
  i buy a lot over the internet and pay with euros and do n't want the forint to be devalued . 
  you know that 's really bullshit . 
  they want self-rule in the territory where they live , and somehow some guy in moldova is threatened ? 
  give me a break ... 
  i think it 's more of an issue of a bureocracy of a centralized state not wanted to give away power and money , and they 're using nationalist rhetoric so that the dumb masses fight amongst each other while they get to watch and smirk . 
  typical ceausescu tactics . 
  i 'm saying that the flag should be used on public buildings if the people in those public buildings decide that this is what they want . 
  in the article you quoted it was said that the president of the local council decided that the flag should be placed on the public building . 
  in my opinion , when it comes to local issues local president  country president i 've made the parallel with the catalan flag in spain because the catalan issue is `` popular '' at the moment and so other people may have an opinion on it . 
  however , we can go to more regional ( and less known ) examples like the [ flag of vojvodina ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_vojvodina ) in serbia . 
  yes there are extremists who like to burn it from time to time , but still , the flag is standing there on public buildings , next to the serbian flag . 
  the romanians do n't have to look to western europe to learn how to deal with local issues . 
  note also that the vojvodina flag is not the hungarian flag , just like how the szekely flag is not the hungarian flag . 
  this is not an issue of separatism , it 's an issue with an over-controlling central government micromanaging things , and is doing a bad job at it and pissing off locals . 
  there is no `` romanian side '' here since it 's not an ethnic issue , i 'm sure many romanians do n't give a fuck about one more flag on a building . 
  btw . 
  if it 's illegal to have non-romanian flags on public buildings , then [ why is there an eu flag flying on the romanian parliament ] ( http://epochtimes-romania.com/news_images/2011/11/2011_11_02_dsc_0080_rsz.jpg ) ? 
  i lived in an euro country and now i live in a non-euro country . 
  in my experience , the cons are : * more expensive food ( as mentioned in the article ) * loss of monetary independence ( average citizen has less influence on monetary policies ) the pros are : * you 're part of a world-level currency , everyone in the world will exchange it , you 'll never have any problems * cheaper exchanges to other currencies ( for example , right now if i want to change eur to usd , i have to do eur -  huf , huf -  usd , which is very expensive ) * bank transactions between eurozone countries are for ** free ** ( [ sepa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_euro_payments_area ) ) * low inflation ( this year it was 2,1 % i think ) * no need to calculate in your head when buying on amazon or ebay * banknotes are of good quality material , they 're almost never ripped and do n't fall apart after years of use, 
  what has this got to do with spain exiting the eurozone ? 
  the article says it 's about rajoy 's associates receiving bribe money , it 's nothing to do with the economy . 
  when i was in turkey i saw that almost every house and building there has those water canisters where the water is heated by solar energy . 
  this was true even for [ trabzon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trabzon ) which is in that pale yellow area of northern turkey . 
  so obviously if they can do it that all european countries that are yellow or red can as well . 
  imagine not having to spend money on heating water . 
  i think i spend like 20 euros/month just for that . 
   genocide on romanians til is this what romanians learn in history class ? 
  i 've opened [ another thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/182y7b/question_to_catalonians_how_would_you_feel_if_the ) where i asked how would catalans feel if the spanish government did with their flag what the romanians actually did here in january . 
  here are some responses :  if the central goverment sends the police to change that choice i do consider it oppression . 
   basque here our flag the ikurri\u00f1a was illegal during francoist times it 's nice that people here want to have a dialogue and discuss where szekelys come from etc. 
  but it does n't change the fact that the romanian side is simply * wrong * on this issue . 
  if local people , may them be tunguzians or peruvians , want to fly their own flag in an area where they 're a local majority , and the central government oppresses it , then that 's oppression , plain and simple . 
  again , the only reason why this issue is n't as widely known as the catalan one is that : 1 . the szekelys are not rich and connected enough to push this internationally ( most people do n't even know they exist ) 2 . it 's happenning in eastern europe which is a hellhole anyway in the eyes of western europe , so no one cares but it still does n't change the fact that this is oppression of the will of an ethnic minority , in an eu country . 
  i 'm not saying the romanian flag should be completely removed , let 's have both flags next to one another , why is that a problem ? 
  yeah but i 'm interested in what would be the reaction to a bully central government that does n't allow the local flag and sends the police to remove it if the local government places it on some buildings . 
  the flag the catalans use dates back to the 9th century and was used back when aragon was independent and spain did n't exist . 
  the `` senyera estelada '' flag was never used officially . 
  and the szekelys want to fly their flag with the star and the moon , not the hungarian flag which would suggest secession . 
   in january 2013 , the president of the covasna county council , tamas sandor , asked mayors in sfantu gheorghe and targu secuiesc to fly the unofficial sz\u00e9kely land flag in front of their city halls , `` because the sz\u00e9kely land is our heart , '' said sandor . 
  obviously the local community wants this , and the central government is suppressing the wishes of the locals . 
  this would make sense if the locals decided to do something criminal , but flying a flag is n't that . 
  how about you suck my cock and pay for the privilege ? 
   the sz\u00e9kely land flag was recently flown at the investiture ceremony for the new covasna county prefect , but was taken out of the room by romanian authorities . 
   romania asked hungary to stop engaging in practices that give the false impression that romania does not respect the norms in protecting the rights of national minorities . 
  if the minorities do n't have the right to their own flag then what kind of `` protection '' is this that we 're talking about ? 
  hey everyone , catalonia ca n't use its own flag cause they 're spanish !, 
  imagine the outroar ... 
  but then this is eastern europe and no one gives a shit when human rights are violated . 
  as a friend of mine would say : how come they never put drugs in my drinks ? 
  you hate giving money for agriculture buy you love to shove cheap french food into your mouth , which you import toll-free . 
  the whole eu pays for the food you eat you fat bastards . 
  if it were like room 101 he would * genuinely * have to feel the way the court wants him to feel . 
  that probably means psychiatrists would examine his reports and decide if he 's lying or not . 
  however i do n't know anything about the process so i wo n't comment further . 
  i think it 's related to soil quality . 
  agricultural nations such as hungary , france or the netherlands get more money cause they grow more food per hectare than say spain , which is half-desert . 
  i do n't know about latvia but i 'm guessing they similarly have poor soil . 
  slovenia and austria do n't have much farmland , but what they do they have on extremely fertile soil , so again they get more subsidies . 
  greece is an anomaly though , i do n't think anything grows there but olive bushes . 
  it should be in the same category as spain . 
   is n't going to change anything . 
  he needs to write reports how the visit made him feel . 
  i 'm guessing that if he does n't genuinely change then the court can extend his punishment . 
   something that should hold the same contempt and illegality of claiming the earth is flat something like 6 % of hungary 's population ended up in auschwitz , i think it 's more serious than that . 
  like i said , i think he should be punished ... but on the other hand this makes me wonder if there are other things that are forbidden . 
  i have n't been to a political rally in almost a decade , but if i do decide to go once will i have to think twice before holding up a banner ? 
  the possibility that something like this can be criminalized means that a future government may extend the ban to other public statements as well . 
  i 'm actually surprised this is n't against the constitution ... 
  [ as far as i can see ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/content/20111107mun30717/html/eu-budget-at-glance ) the uk is now contributing 11bn , and it would contribute 3bn more without the rebate . 
  it also received 6bn back . 
  so basically , right now you 're giving 5bn , and without the rebate you 'd be giving 8bn . 
  is that really such a large sum for a $ 2,3 trillion economy ? 
  honestly , i think you 're just being dicks . 
  i think it 's good that people like this are thought a lesson ... but this is also a direct infringement of freedom of speech so it has a bad after taste . 
   hedegaard , ** 70 ** , said the gunman beaten up by a 70 year old lol, 
  i laughed so hard at [ this picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hiugdoc.jpg )  ) ) ), 
  what are you , a 2 years old ? 
  of course it makes sense , why else would she do it ? 
  why do you think people go into politics ? 
  she 's currently the most powerful woman in europe ( and possibly the world ) , do you think anyone would trade that for some cash ? 
  she 's obviously not doing it for money but for power . 
  why is this surprising anyone ? 
  specifically for yugoslavia , it had one of the strongest textile industries of the world . 
  during the war the chinese took over that share of the market . 
  but the `` good '' thing is that very soon the chinese labour costs will be higher than in serbia , meaning it will be competitive again . 
  that 's like 1,6 % of the population . 
  in the us that would be 5 million people . 
  in germany , 1,3 million . 
  uk 1 million romania 300 thousand slovenia 32 thousand malta 7232, 
  i 'm guessing because it 's unprofitable and causes pollution . 
  the uk , france , germany shut down their coal mines more than a decade ago . 
  they also switched to alternative energy sources , which i 'm really hoping the hungarian government also intends to do . 
  he did not explicitly say what the title of this thread says , but the article he wrote is so full of hate i simply do n't understand how is it not classified as hate speech . 
  reading him literally feels like reading a hitler speech , and i 'm not trying to overreact here . 
  an organization already went to court to sue bayer zsolt but the court dismissed it on some grounds that i ca n't remember right now ( this case is from the first week of january ) . 
  the background of the story is that a group of gypsies attacked some people during new year and one guy almost died .
