  omg how unbearable all of this is , how much it destroys everything that is humane . 
  and how much there 's no place here for any explaining and tolerance . 
  and animals should be no more . 
  in any way . 
  this needs to be solved -- but right now and regardless of how !,

  hungarian goes through periods of making everything native and then periods of accepting everything in its original form . 
  for example , when they were changing everything to native , they even translated stuff like jules verne into `` verne gyula ''  similarly words like republic , parliament , and a lot of latin words got translated into k\u00f6zt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g , orsz\u00e1gh\u00e1za ... 
  but nowadays i think we 're in a period of accepting foreign words without changing them . 
  the last modification of the language happenned in ~ 1980 and a lot of words entered everyday usage since . 
  regarding computer science we have : software - szoftver hardware - hardver memory - mem\u00f3ria but also computer - sz\u00e1m\u00edt\u00f3g\u00e9p taskbar - t\u00e1lca node - csom\u00f3 stack - verem,

  the hungarian government made extra effort to get as much money as possible from the eu , since the previous government had a very low `` retrieval rate '' . 
  bad choice . 
  from his comments he seems to be an arrogant nationalist/populist . 
  also vaclav klaus is supporting him , which is another clue that he 's an asshole .

  canada already [ introduced visas for czech visitors ] ( http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-notebook/visa-feud-clouds-harpers-free-trade-dream-with-europe/article4102974/ ) because there were too many roma asylum seekers coming from there . 
  they were threatening to do the same for hungarians but for some reason did n't so far . 
  another fun fact : the [ eu is itself threatening ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/12/us-germany-balkans-asylum-idusbre89b0wz20121012 ) to reintroduce visas for serbia because too many gypsies from there are traveling to belgium and requesting asylum ( which they 'll get denied but in the meantime they 'll get some $ $ $ as social help ) . 
  they still have time till 2020 to add the extra 880 chairs . 
  good thing it 's for 2020 when the economy might be completely different , even reverse of what is today . 
  i 'm tired of every big event being hosted in expensive european countries , where you have to pay expensive hotels and eat expensive food and drink expensive beer . 
  it excludes half the continent that can not afford those prices . 
  that 's why poland/ukraine was such a great thing ... and funny , those countries did n't go bankrupt . 
  y u no click my link ? 
  :(  the stadium , which is all-seater , has a capacity of 69,120 , though its original capacity exceeded 100,000 . 
  no , the germans hosted too much lately . 
  time for other places to get the spotlight . 
  hooray , the finals will be [ in budapest ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferenc_pusk%c3%a1s_stadium ) and i live just 150 meters from it !, 
  why , is merkelabad better perhaps ? 
  plastic is expensive yo, 
  yeah i get that but why a smoking paper ? 
  i reported you to the mods because of your offensive username . 
  the parliament of hungary is in romania ... , 
  poor jan\u0161a , i do n't know why he 's hated so much . 
  yes he probably did steal but so did the other guy , so why is the other guy more popular ? 
  [ here 's a video that compares jan\u0161a with hitler ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pus1apx7c4a ) , 
  the army of presevo-bujanovac-medvedje ( to whom the monument in presevo was built ) is not the same as the uck , and legally they are not regarded as terrorists by the serb state , as according to the amnesty law issued in 2001 . 
   it was removed because it was built there illegally , without any permissions it was built by the society of veterans of the army of b-p-m while the location was allocated by the municipality of presevo , which participated in the financing of the monument . 
  tell me , since when is it illegal to build something if the city where it 's built says that it 's ok ? 
  and where 's your proof that its building was illegal ? 
   what i find ironic is that you hate serbia with such a passion and continually bash on it , yet you still live in it ... that 's something i do n't get . 
  here 's a clue . 
  it makes my stomach turn to think some of my tax money may have been spent on murdering those albanians that were later found in ice trucks in the danube . 
  where 's the monument for those victims ? 
  when will the serb president do what willy brandt did in warsaw ? 
  when will the fucking denazification happen in serbia ? 
  since you seem to be somehow personally interested in my motives , [ read this ] ( http://pescanik.net/2012/12/srce-tame-3/ ) if you have n't already . 
  that letter could 've been written by me , i agree with it completely . 
  that depends on the point of view . 
  for the albanians those people were freedom fighters , while the serb partisans were the terrorists . 
  i do n't think it 's too hard to understand this . 
  to show the double-standards of serbia , [ one of the residents of pre\u0161evo pointed out ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=22&amp;nav_id=83296 ) that they 've built a statue in lu\u010dani for the members of the serbian special forces that died during the kosovo war in ' 99 . 
  these are the same people that murdered at least 10 thousand innocent albanian civilians . 
  how is it ok for that monument to stand , while you tear down those that fought for albanians ? 
  it 's ironic that the army of presevo-bujanovac-medvedje was created when nikolic and his buddies were in power , and the army disbanded only when they got removed . 
  and now when nikolic got back , we suddenly have these incidents . 
  coincidence , right ? 
  i really do n't see why they could n't just let the whole thing remain in peace , let them have their statue , who cares ... 
  they were n't causing anyone any harm , and now you see what kind of mess is going on in kosovo . 
  it 's really not worth it . 
  and everyone builds statues for `` heroes '' that just happened to murder a shitton of innocent people from the eternal_enemy 's tribe . 
  the [ article that jednorog posted ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2013/01/war-memorials-balkans ) is really interesting and shows other similar examples . 
  vitina was a town with a majority albanian population and when ww2 came the serbs lost and the albanians - allies of the italians - took control of the town . 
  it 's quite possible that the partisans that fought there were none other than the people who moved to vitina earlier as part of the serbian colonization program to make kosovo majority serb . 
  according to [ this table ] ( http://sq.wikipedia.org/wiki/lista_e_ardhacak%c3%abve_-_viti ) , 25 serb families were settled in that town between 1918-41 . 
  these people were obviously going to lose everything in any case , so they probably just chose to put up a fight . 
  then later the communist propaganda proclaimed them to be partisans . 
  does n't change the fact that vitina was back then as it is now a majority albanian town . 
  map of yugoslavia during ww2 : http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/246/map123.jpg/ vitina always was a majority albanian town , and the partisans that fought there most likely did n't have the support of the local populace . 
  that monument was erected for people that fought against a kosovo united with albania . 
  why should the albanians like it ? 
  i 'm not saying that destroying statues is right , i 'm saying the serbs did this same thing in presevo a few days ago . 
  it 's just that from their viewpoint , they are the victims , and do n't care how the albanians may feel . 
  / r/europe is really turning ridiculous . 
  at this moment you have the biggest hostage crisis with europeans involved * in decades * , and yet you write about fucking horse meat that was found in irrelevantly small quanitities in some burgers ??? 
  edit : read this you assholes : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/algeria/9812922/algeria-hostage-crisis-latest-as-10-britons-remain-missing-in-desert.html, 
  that 's not how you check if she 's a witch . 
   there wo n't be enough people in productive age and there wo n't be anybody to pay old people 's pensions and that 's exactly the flaw in the system . 
  why should young people pay for older people 's pensions ? 
  why not make the system such that the money people pay is invested , like private pension funds do it now , and once you retire you get to withdraw the money from the fund and enjoy it ? 
  this way you 're not taking money from anyone else , and it does n't matter if there are too many or too few young people , the amount of money you get is the amount you saved . 
  this is good news !, 
  right now , maple syrup is so expensive ... :(, 
  it 's `` ombudsman '' in hungarian too . 
  the weird thing is , had it been assimilated into the grammar , it would 've been written as `` ombudszm\u00e1n '' , but for some reason they keep writing it with the original swedish spelling . 
  perhaps the academy in charge of the spelling has n't made up its mind yet ... 
  the sea somehow magically appears in hungary ? 
  i just found a shop here in budapest that sells kangaroo meat !, 
  they do n't say how much it is though :( anyway , here 's something i should put on my todo list . 
  thanks for the idea !, 
  i see , so if those 4 countries decide so , iran can join efta and gain access to the eu free market , and there 's nothing the eu can do about it ? 
  are n't both of those wild animals ( meaning they have a `` wild '' taste instead of the neutral flavor that most domesticated animals have ) ? 
  i do n't think the general public will adopt anything that has a strong flavor .
