  i would be interested in eating kangaroo meat . 
  i wonder how different does it taste from mammals . 
  all right , it 's a moral issue for some people , but you have european cultures ( such as my own ) where eating a horse is not morally wrong . 
  with this i want to say that eating horse meat is not so much `` distant '' from the english or american cultures either , you just need to be persuaded a bit . 
  if you have more advertising telling you that it 's healthier than beef while it tastes the same , then probably it 'll spread among people that eat healthy food and eventually into the general public . 
  imagine mchorseburger , as part of the mchealth menu . 
  well i 've tried crickets but they 're not very tasty , that could be one reason why i 'm not eating them regularly . 
  compared to that , horse meat tastes almost exactly the same as beef , so you ca n't say you wo n't eat it because of the taste . 
  according to [ this page ] ( http://voices.yahoo.com/eating-bugs-healthy-you-572319.html?cat=5 ) most cereals we eat already contain from 10 % to 30 % insects and i do n't see people complaining about it . 
  why complain about a little horse meat ? 
  which bugs ? 
  would n't it be just hilarious if the uk used its veto power to prevent scotland from joining the un ? 
  i guess it wo n't happen but it would still make me chuckle ... 
  who says spain wo n't block your efta candidacy ? 
  who says you 'll get admitted into the un ? 
  kosovo ca n't , why should you ? 
   the group says hostages will be freed if france ends its operations in mali . 
  i 'm sure france will destroy the islamists in a few weeks and so end its operations in mali . 
  kick france out of the eu . 
  i wo n't give money so they could satisfy their ww2 frustrations . 
  if you buy a chicken for # 5 then you are eating what i just said , water and growth hormone . 
  chickens that are raised `` free roaming '' have to follow some special rules , for example no more than 4 chickens per square meter , they must be able to walk around in an area not smaller than an acre and it has to be 40 % forrested , 10 % pond etc. 
  the chicken that lives this way needs more than two times the average time to become `` ready '' for slaughter , and is generally smaller ( however , although smaller , it weighs the same as the larger broiler chicken , since its meat does n't contain as much water ) . 
  tl ; dr ; to buy a `` real '' chicken , you 'd have to pay at least # 10 for half the size of a # 5 `` tesco '' chicken . 
  when the packet says chicken but it 's actually 50 % water and 30 % growth hormone , is it still a chicken ? 
  seems to me pretty retarded that people are complaining about getting healthier food than they paid for . 
  hey everyone , ireland single handedly saved us all from doom !, 
  i do n't understand this guy . 
  he has more money he can ever spend . 
  he can have unlimited sex till the end of his life . 
  he has already been prime minister and has been recorded in history . 
  he 's also famous and can remain popular for the rest of his life thanks to his media empire . 
  he can make a tv channel and show his face there 24/7 . 
  what more does he want ? 
  why risk losing it all because of some stupid politics ? 
  what 's wrong with horsemeat ? 
  it 's healthier than beef and more expensive . 
  eat it you morons !, 
  your people ? 
  the spanish ? 
  oh wait , why wo n't my tears flow for the poor serb gravestones ? 
  is it because i 'm somehow reminded of [ this ] ( http://archiv.magyarszo.com/arhiva/epbizottsag/hhrf3.htm ) ? 
  2 million ) there are over 150 chinese restaurants , that 's 1 per 13k . 
  they 're also incredibly cheap , like you can get a full meal for 2,5-3 eur . 
  i 'm not sure how they do it , i 've tried making my own chinese food and it never gets less than 5 eur ( chicken , vegetables , rice ... ), 
  did you mean [ this ] ( http://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%94%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%be%d1%82%d0%b5%d0%ba%d0%b0:zimbabwe_$100_trillion_2009_obverse.jpg ) ? 
  yeah i agree , zimbabwe can join the club , byelorussia is still in the amateur league . 
  timis and arad are in the top 10 , and bihor is # 14 . 
  my point is , if you travel 100 km west of timis , arad or bihor , you will be in the poorest areas of those countries . 
  this is caused because all the large cities are on the romanian side , so the small cities and villages in hungary and serbia have no access to a `` hub '' where they could trade . 
  they must go to budapest or belgrade which are far away . 
  hungary and romania recently signed an agreement to build ~ 50 new border crossings , this will have a real effect when romania enters the schengen area . 
  hopefully when the poor areas in hungary have better access to the cities on the other side of the border , the whole region will become rich ( er ) . 
  one bubble gum is 5 cents ? 
  either portugal is very cheap or your government is subsidizing bubble gums . 
  do these kids account for being employed in a normal way ? 
  do they pay tax , healthcare , pension fund ? 
  i also delivered ads when i was ~ 12 years old but i was paid in cash , without the government knowing about it , so in theory i would also be accounted as unemployed . 
  who buys newspapers ? 
  it 's interesting that the eastern part of hungary and serbia ( those bordering romania ) are the poorest parts of those countries , while just across the border in romania it 's the richest . 
  why would anyone hire a 15 year old ? 
  pfff as someone who lived through the yugoslav hyperinflation , this is nothing . 
  come back when your smallest note ( one you ca n't even buy a bubble gum with ) is a billion . 
  no hungary yet ? 
  i 'm not a great reader and i mostly read sci-fi , but here are a few of the more popular books from hungarian writers : * [ g\u00e1rdonyi g\u00e9za - egri csillagok ( eclipse of the crescent moon ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eclipse_of_the_crescent_moon ) it 's a two part novel , the first deals with teenagers living through the devastation brought by the ottoman wars , the second ( more exciting ) is about the siege of eger . 
  this siege actually happened and many of the characters are historical figures . 
  * [ moln\u00e1r ferenc - a p\u00e1l utcai fi\u00fak ( the paul street boys ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_paul_street_boys ) , pretty interesting book about kids fighting wars between each other * arany j\u00e1nos - toldi , it 's a rather long poem ( something like 50 pages long ? ), 
  about a hero named toldi and his adventures , set in the xiv century there are other books which i like but they 're not really recognized as being `` among the best '' . 
  one is '' [ the invisible man ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slave_of_the_huns ) '' by g\u00e1rdonyi g\u00e9za , it 's about a greek/roman slave that goes to live with the huns during attila 's reign , how he falls in love with a girl and then the hunnic lifestyle etc. 
  something like dances with wolves except this was written a 100 years before the movie . 
  the weirdest short stories i 've ever read in any language were by [ cs\u00e1th g\u00e9za ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%a9za_cs%c3%a1th ) , he was a morphium addict , shot his wife , then tried to run away but eventually died . 
  reading his stories is like watching eraserhead , enough said . 
  hungarians have some very nice , very passionate poetry , it 's because the language is agglutinative ie . 
  it uses a lot of suffixes , so it 's not difficult to make words rhyme . 
  unfortunately also because of this many poems are untranslatable . 
  you have to learn the language to appreciate how beautiful some of the poems are . 
  what about the people and organizations that financed the exploration of the oil , the initial investment , building , setting up trade lines and relationships ? 
  that oil would still be in the ground if it was up to the venezuelans . 
  i think budapest hungarians are n't askers , they 're just rude , 
  yes , [ ljubelj pass ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loibl_pass ) , built by slave labour under ss supervision during ww2, 
  to change this into a more real-world discussion , how about that bayezid statue ? 
  he 's not very popular in serbian history but i think the bosniaks view him positively . 
  should they be denied to build statues for their heroes ? 
  it would make sense if there were any germans left in the tolerant paradise of vojvodina , and they demanded it . 
  we have to work with what 's left ; for example , maybe the people of novi pazar would like a nice statue of bayezid sultan ? 
  when you 're old enough you might rediscover this post of yours and think what a fool you once were . 
  i encourage you to use reddit 's save function . 
   armed conflicts between major superpowers are a thing of the past lulz, 
  before ww2 every country had a humongous army and everyone was serving like 3 years . 
  when it became apparent that europe has no real influence on world events , they started reducing the number of years , then eventually conscription was abandoned and now the eu is a beacon of peace . 
  best decision ever . 
  europe was a horrible place to live in back when it ruled the world . 
  you do n't seem to be reading what i wrote . 
  let 's try with pictures . 
  in super-tolerant vojvodina with 6 official languages , [ here 's a statue of svetozar miletic ] ( http://srbija.superodmor.rs/data/images/2011-04-20/79715_novi-sad-trg---d.bosnic_gf.jpg?ver=1303359650 ) , seemingly * cursing the catholic church in front of him . 
  do you think the catholic minorities feel good about this ? 
  do you even care ? 
  why does n't nikolic order the destruction of the statue ? 
  ^ ( * - of course if you look further into the story , you 'll see that miletic was originally cursing a statue of the holy trinity . 
  this statue has been destroyed when the communists took over , so now only the church is cursed . ),
