   it creates the same type of negative feelings non-serb villages in vojvodina and sandzak are filled with statues of serb heroes that imposed serb rule on the locals . 
  what about their feelings ? 
  that 's not the same , the zagreb thing is just a tv show . 
  the guys in bol sell cups and t-shirts , much more serious . 
  no there are no separatist groups but most of the map features regions that have a `` potential '' for separation , not active groups . 
  like someone mentioned here , there are no separatist groups in normandy either , only some people that like to put on viking hats , 
  i was on bol a few years ago and they were selling t-shirts and cups with `` bol republic '' and `` we want independence even if we 'll starve '' . 
  i guess it 's just a joke but then so are most of the separatists on that map . 
  by googling i [ quickly found ] ( http://forum.net.hr/forums/t/344010.aspx ) some discussion about an independent dalmatia ... , 
  on dec. 26 after christmas ^ 1 this same guy [ made some comments ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=sr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.blic.rs%2fvesti%2fpolitika%2f360107%2fnikolic-srusiti-spomenik-u-presevu-u-sred-bela-dana&amp;act=url ) about how albanian statues ^ 2 should be demolished by force if the locals wo n't do it themselves . 
  1 - albanians celebrate christmas on dec. 25 , serbs on jan. 7 2 - there still are some albanians left in serbia and one village built a statue in honor of the fighters that fought against serbia, 
  not a fully accurate map as usual . 
  to add a few more : separatists of the island of bol in croatia , hungarians in the south of slovakia , hungarians in the west of romania , albanians in the west of macedonia ( there was a civil war just 10 years because of it , unlike these other quasi-separatists in germany ) , serbian albanians east of kosovo ... 
  interesting sunny spot at the tri-border between hungary , serbia and romania, 
  italy and san marino . 
  you can call me racist but they look the same to me . 
  it 's nice to be wanted . 
  how about no ? 
  if europe remilitarizes i 'm getting the fuck out of here . 
  war is just awful and letting the us and others deal with it was the smartest thing the post-ww2 generation did for us . 
  haha stupid hippies . 
  they probably wish now they made more children instead of saving money for lsd . 
  in serbia there were elections last year where a huge number of voters drew penises on the voting paper , wrote `` fuck you you 're all the same '' etc. 
  do you know what was the outcome ? 
  the far right took power , and the `` spoiled ballots '' got uploaded to facebook for people to have some laughs . 
  no offense but your advice is just as bad as telling people not to vote . 
  btw . 
  if you 're interested , [ here are some pictures of those spoiled ballots ] ( http://www.ludidokumenti.com/izbori-2012-u-srbiji-glasacki-listici-galerija-crteza-dopisanih-kandidata-pirata-betmena-i-svacega.html ) . 
  i like [ this one ] ( http://www.ludidokumenti.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ludidokumenti-izbori-srbija-2012-listic-pas-kenja-govno.jpg ) and [ this one ] ( http://www.ludidokumenti.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ludidokumenti-izbori-srbija-2012-listic-lupajte-glavom-ovde.jpg ) ( says : bang your head here to relieve stress ) , 
  no eastern europe as usual ? 
  fuck you , here 's a downvote . 
  you make it on bbq , it 's basically 2/3 pork and 1/3 beef ( ratios vary and muslims probably use something else instead of pork ) . 
  it 's no less healthy than your average hamburger . 
  if you 're considering of moving to some place you should see what fits you and not other people . 
  for example , i could probably get a job in it in london but i like warm weather . 
  on the other hand , spain has great weather but no it jobs . 
  so i took the choice in between ( see flag ) . 
  we : best everyone else : stupid assholes, 
  i could imagine living in berlin since it 's a very exciting , functional , cheap and cool place . 
  totally broke every stereotype i had about germans being boring and inflexible . 
  the best `` western europeans '' i 've met are the spanish , they are simply the friendliest and nicest i 've met . 
  in seville it was raining and an old man gave us his umbrella , barcelona has some very pretty girls , in bilbao i 've met some of the most interesting folks ever and generally i 've met a lot of spanish people in my life and they never disappointed me . 
  too bad about their economic situation , they definitely did n't deserve it and hope they 'll get out of it soon . 
  czech republic would also be a country i could live in especially since they have a lot of large it firms , except that i 've already lived in 2 slavic countries and if i ever moved again i would want something `` different '' ( like , vietnamese ) . 
  you can avoid transactional fees if you pick the right bank ( my bank has no fees if you pay with your bank card , so if i avoid cash i 'll avoid the tax ) . 
  the telecommunication special tax expired on jan 1st 2013 so maybe your next bill will be lower ? 
  anyway i pay around 20 eur per month which i think is fair . 
  i admit that i have n't been following what 's going on with higher education , i only agree that students who study in hungary for free should work in hungary for a period of time , because they get paid by my taxes . 
  i think they also introduced mandatory gym class every day in elementary and high schools ? 
  which is great considering we 're the fattest nation in europe . 
  yes fidesz rhetorics is a bit disgusting but i value their actions more . 
  like in this case , they said how election registration is great , but when the constitutional court said no , they agreed . 
  that 's what counts , what they do , not what they say . 
  and let 's look at their recent actions . 
  they helped people in foreign currency debt . 
  changed tax system so people in middle class ( like myself ) get more money from their salary . 
  at this moment they have a program `` teach 100 thousand people '' where my wife can attend english course for free . 
  reduced price of heating during winter . 
  please tell me , why should i bite the hand that feeds me ? 
  i joined their facebook page and was thinking of attending a meeting in november , but then i saw they declaired themselves a `` pirate party with national feelings '' and thought `` meh fuck off '' . 
  this year my net salary will go up 50 eur thanks to tax reforms by the guy the op calls a `` lunatic '' . 
  have you ever had a government that reduced * your * taxes ? 
  you should tone down the propaganda a little bit , 40 % of posts in this thread is yours . 
  it 's nice that you hate fidesz etc. 
  and somehow think socialism is the cure for all evil but notice how you 're just talking with yourself . 
  the hungarian pirate party is a joke , i 'm so jealous of the czechs who seem to have managed to create a serious party that might actually win votes in their next election . 
  an embarrassingly tiny 18x14 pixel penis . 
  islam as a religion is nice as any other mainstream religion . 
  islamist ideology is what 's fucked up , and it 's more pervasive in europe than any christian fundamentalist movement . 
  to put it simply : a muslim living in a muslim country like jordan [ looks like this ] ( http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6159/6138431135_807d11e6bc_z.jpg ) , an islamist living in london [ looks like this ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/06/article-2169657-13f10f15000005dc-139_634x367.jpg ) . 
  christianity is not an ideology . 
  the tv says that it 's tradition to eat hotdogs and lentils but i never did any of these . 
  almost every new year went the same way as yesterday , so i guess it can be called my tradition . 
  on new year 's eve you get shitfaced and party ( countdown till 0 then kiss everyone ) , after some time you go home and puke . 
  this year i managed to wake up at 13h just in time for the vienna concert . 
  the concert is good because it 's calm music , good for hangover , and you do n't have to open your eyes to listen to it . 
  after some time i manage to stand on my feet and warm up the [ sarma ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarma_\\ ( food \\ ) ) that my wife cooked on dec. 31 . 
  this is the perfect food for january 1st , because it 's sour ( good for reducing the alcohol content in your body ) and also fills you up so you do n't have to eat anymore for the rest of the day . 
  the rest of the day is spent watching movies , trying to contact relatives to wish them happy new year ... 
  i also put my clothes in the washing machine cause tomorrow is working day :(, 
  where 's the one where the european eagle is grabbing the earth with its claws ? 
  we 're talking about gross ( before taxes ) salary here . 
  in hungary a university professor gets minimum 17k ,, 
  31k is not that much , it 's just a bit more than what i get here in hungary . 
  is n't britain supposed to be super rich ? 
  i think if you 're very ill then it 's common for your family to give presents to nurses to take extra care of you . 
  doctors can receive whiskey after a very serious operation like treating cancer . 
  it 's not really a bribe , more like a thank you . 
  if you visit your doctor often enough you two will know each other well enough to almost be friends , and it 's normal to pay a friend a beer after he did a good job for you , right ? 
  there are cases where nurses or doctors demand `` presents '' or money . 
  sometimes you can hear in the newspaper that a doctor refused to treat a patient unless she paid 500 euros , so she went to the police station , they wrote down the numbers , she gave the doctor the money and he was subsequently arrested . 
  hopefully this discourages these vultures somewhat . 
  i do n't think so . 
  an angry voice should scare them , dogs get scared the same way . 
  anyway , my dad has two dogs , i can test this when i visit him next time , i 'm sure they will react the same way . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  the dog will look down sad if your voice is angry , regardless of whether it just took a dump or saved your life . 
  yes but not this specific one thing that is so easy for humans . 
  how do you ask a dog if it 's hungry ? 
  yes , asdifhasdufhsdufysdf , apologize immediately !,
