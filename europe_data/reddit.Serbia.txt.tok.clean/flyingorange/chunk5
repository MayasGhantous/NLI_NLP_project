  yeah i also fucking hated it when i had a net 900 euro/month in slovenia , my wife was unemployed , and i paid the highest bracket tax because the limit was set at 800 euros i believe . 
  the two of us together had a lower living standard than people who did n't reach the highest bracket . 
  hungary : * better/faster train service , * at least * 150 km/h speed * better e-government , i want to be able to vote over the internet , to do my electric/gas/water contracts over the internet , instead of having to go to each provider personally and provide a shittone of papers , signatures , and two witness signatures * i wish i could eat the food that we produce , instead of exporting the best food to western europe and feeding us the shit that is left * sea * mountains * large theme park ( the nearest one is gardaland , 800 km ), 
  i was n't aware that they changed the flag , i thought op got it wrong . 
  when did they change the flag ? 
  you probably reduced your life expectancy by 10 years if that 's what you ate all the time :p, 
  i do n't know about romania but what they sell in budapest is not gyros but d\u00f6ner kebab . 
  gyros is made with french fries and tzatziki sauce , while kebab is meat with a spicy - and a yoghurt sauce . 
  and i have n't seen a greek person sell gyros yet , it 's all turkish immigrants . 
  so i 've no idea how this whole confusion happened ... 
  what about free language courses ? 
  i think slovenia has the same rules as austria , except you do n't get free language courses either . 
  there are these things called homeless shelters where they can live with drug addicts , prostitutes and similar people . 
  or they can * try ** to get a job . 
  ^ ( * i mean if one can prove that s/he is actively searching for employment then getting welfare should not be denied ), 
  not to mention they already live in the netherlands , so they are `` imersed '' into the language , and that is the easiest way to learn a language . 
  some people pay thousands of euros to go on such courses . 
  turkey is a huge country , for comparison it 's larger than france . 
  it is also very diverse : in izmir the people are very secular and modern , it 's like visiting a wealthier serbia or bulgaria . 
  in urfa on the other side of the country you can only buy alcohol in special shops and the people are extremely friendly to foreigners . 
  in trabzon it feels like you 're in georgia , or perhaps russia . 
  in kas it 's like you 're in greece . 
  in antakya it feels like a more developed syria/jordan . 
  and istanbul is a huge metropolis . 
  turkish highways are more developed than in some eu countries , and their buses easily beat * any * european bus in comfort . 
  so you ca n't compare them to the arabic world at all . 
  some parts of it feels arabic , but others feel completely different . 
  izmir is the most secular city in turkey , they are more secular than many european countries . 
  at least you could 've said you have a brother from konya or urfa then i would 've believed you . 
  no , i think you need like 500 signatures per representative , so if a party wants to send 100 meps to the parliament , they need 50 thousand signatures . 
  that 's relatively easy to do , and since parties receive support from the budget , there were many tiny parties that gathered the required signatures , collected the money , and then during the elections they failed to gather as much votes as they initially had signatures . 
  [ here 's a translated article ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=hu&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.origo.hu%2fvalasztas2014%2f20140409-kis-partok-kampanykoltesei-2014-ben.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) about that , not sure if it 's understandable . 
  by that criteria , turkey is also part of europe . 
  i mean they are of the wrong religion , but their culture and mentality is closer to the balkans/europe than georgia is . 
  ** hungary ** hungarians were pagans that conquered the carpathian basin in the 9th century . 
  some time after that , the political elite realized that joining catholic christianity ( the eu at the time ) was the only way to survive , and they were proved to be right since all the peoples before them ( huns , gepides , avars ) failed and disappeared . 
  hungary will likely end to exist as a nation after ww3 . 
  they will side with the losing side and will get nuked to non-existence . 
  the remaining 500 survivors will get deported to siberia and will get assimilated into the tatar majority . 
  how are they `` european '' ? 
  the philipines are christian too and we do n't consider them to be europeans . 
  so what is it that makes georgians so special ? 
  i 've read that as `` google to sign eu pack '', 
  i 've been to trapani and palermo and actually found it more interesting than the north of italy . 
  trapani does look somewhat ugly , but generally the people are a lot more friendlier , the food is cheap and tasty , the architecture in palermo was great ... we went with a train and yes it was a bit slow , but the train conductor invited us to the driver 's cabin to take pictures !!!, 
  compared to that , in venice we were n't allowed to sit down to rest because some tourist officials chased us away . 
  we got fined in the train because , we had tickets , but did n't validate them ( no english signs anywhere telling us we had to do this ) . 
  in every city we had fake bag salesman chasing us , sometimes even shouting across the bridge . 
  and the food was expensive and not as tasty as what you can eat at home in italian restaurants . 
  so let all the tourists go to the soulless north , i want the south to remain the gem it is now . 
  you 're kind-of right , but then you may look at other subreddits ( like r/worldnews ) where you * do * have more balanced articles and comments , and you do n't get as many downvotes as here if you express an opinion that is n't anti-russian . 
  so it 's not just balance-for-balance 's sake , balanced articles should be posted here because they do exist , and currently this forum is very one-sided . 
  just look at my posts in this thread . 
  not counting this one , i have 3 other posts . 
  let me quote them here :  i did n't say it was pro-russia , read my posts again . 
  i do n't want to read pro-russian propaganda , i want to read balanced news . 
  4 upvotes , 3 downvotes  how about a balanced article ? 
  i see on / r/worldnews this thread about how ukraine is not paying its gas bills and russia might turn off the gas because of that , but putin is warning that ukraine might steal the gas ( like they did before ) which would mean no gas for the rest of europe . 
   http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/22q559/president_vladimir_putin_warned_european_leaders/  can you imagine someone on / r/europe condemning ukraine for doing this ? 
  10 upvotes , 9 downvotes  have you noticed the anti-russian circlejerk that / r/europe has turned into ? 
  i 'm serious , find me one article posted in the past few weeks that was n't critical of russia . 
  58 upvotes , 50 downvotes -- now please , explain why would anyone downvote any of these posts ? 
  was i not contributing to the discussion ? 
  did i write something that is false ? 
  it 's not the karma loss that is my problem , it 's the fact that posts which are blatantly anti-russian ** and often false ** get upvoted as the top comments in the thread . 
  so when i open a thread on this forum , the first thing i 'll read will be propaganda , lies , and misinformation . 
  again , let 's look at the current thread . 
  this thread is suggesting that there is a russian propaganda machine running in the background of reddit , upvoting russian posts , downvoting ukrainan posts . 
  no proof is offered , it 's just a question if everyone else feels paranoid too . 
  so obviously the most-upvoted comment should be someone asking for proofs and examples . 
  you need to have a really twisted sense of reality to not notice how the opposite is actually true , but anyway ... the first 5-6 top posts are those that agree there is a russian astroturfing happening here . 
   however even i noticed that ... at some point there was a sudden pike on pro-russian side 22 upvotes , 5 downvotes , this is the top post  yeah , a lot of textbook `` whataboutism '' examples regarding russia vs. the us in comments , in most cases aimed to change debate focus to the us , or a `` debate about the debate '' . 
  49 upvotes , 13 downvotes  from the rhetorics some of these obviously astroturfing commenters use 8 upvotes , 1 downvote  but what is most laughable are the comments made regarding an `` anti-russian circlejerk '' . 
  47 upvotes , 13 downvotes  yes , we do . 
  i think we were one of the first where they tested out their new bot 's . 
   of course as estonian language is quite complicated it 's very easy to notice things that are just wrong . 
  ( votes still hidden but it 's near the top ) -- and * this * post will have a near-0 karma in the future , or possibly a negative one . 
  i believe that i have again contributed to the discussion , and as the rules say , you only downvote if you think a post does n't contribute , not if you disagree . 
  despite this , i will get downvoted because i went against the general circlejerkery of this subreddit . 
  [ relevant video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siabenr_q0u ), 
   i have filtered the keywords `` russia '' , `` ukraine '' and `` putin '' in res for this subreddit that 's actually a good idea , i 'll do that too !, 
  edit : wow , suddenly this subreddit does n't feel like shit anymore !, 
   and how is that exactly `` pro-russia '' ? 
  i did n't say it was pro-russia , read my posts again . 
  i do n't want to read pro-russian propaganda , i want to read balanced news . 
  how about a balanced article ?

  i 'm serious , find me one article posted in the past few weeks that was n't critical of russia . 
  i 'm waiting for a map showing the % of the population being orcs and goblins . 
  i expect the east of ukraine to be very high in the dark force . 
  as it was said before , had we used the british system , fidesz would 've won 90 % of the seats . 
  roughly half of the seats in the parliament are elected by voting for a person , the other half by voting for a party . 
  for the personal voting , the person that gets the most votes wins the seats , so for example winning 45 % vs. 44 % means the guy with 45 % gets the seat . 
  the other half , the party voting is proportional . 
  it just happened so that in the personal voting the socialists won like 5-6 districts , while fidesz won in all the remaining 90 . 
  i 'm not a financial expert , but my understanding is that this is a case of redistributing the money . 
  for example , previously the utility companies made large profits , now those profits will be ( significantly ) lower . 
  the companies are not actually losing money , they 're just not making as much as they used to .
