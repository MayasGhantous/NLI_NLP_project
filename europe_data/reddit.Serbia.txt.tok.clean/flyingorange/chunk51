  you can not `` process '' them as you are suggesting , because they do n't want to do it . 
  they literally break out of buses and camps so they would n't get finger stamped , they run into the corn fields , the police tries to catch them but it 's not really effective ... 
  so the only solution is to build a wall ( which is happening ) or use military force ( which is n't yet an option ) . 
  i think hungary did the right thing . 
  after merkel 's announcement last week the refugees have stopped being peaceful refugees and have basically turned into a horde . 
  to tell you a few real life examples of what they did : * because of them causing problems at the keleti rail station , my parents canceled their visit this week since they were supposed to come by train * because of them walking on the highway to austria , my coworkers who live in that direction had trouble traveling home and had to wait in traffic jams * other than polluting just the keleti rail station , they also live in other parks in the city and slowly turning them to dumpsters . 
  i walk along the danube every day and it 's disgusting what it turned into . 
  i understand that they are normal people and i have nothing against them , let them go to germany . 
  but their behavior turned pretty bad in the past week so they should either : * go back to `` normal mode '' * go to germany * or we send the riot police in and deport them back to serbia, 
  i 've been at keleti several times in the past month and they are mostly polite and normal people , they do n't cause any trouble . 
  there are always idiots in every crowd however . 
  ngos, 
  the list looks a little bit different when you consider the population size of the countries they apply to . 
  | country | population | asylum applications ( 2014 ) | applications / population ratio | | : -------- | ------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------------- :| | sweden | 9,801,616 | 75,090 | 0.77 % | | hungary | 9,877,365 | 41,370 | 0.42 % | | austria | 8,602,112 | 28,060 | 0.33 % | | germany | 81,083,600 | 173,070 | 0.21 % | | turkey | 77,695,904 | 87,820 | 0.11 % | | italy | 60,795,612 | 63,660 | 0.10 % | | france | 66,616,416 | 59,030 | 0.09 % | | uk | 64,511,000 | 31,260 | 0.05 % |, 
  luckily nato got involved in time and prevented it . 
  only 10 thousand albanians were killed . 
  hungarian immigrants from outside hungary ( who last time voted 90 % for fidesz ) can read them , 
  yes they can . 
  had the fuckers not resisted the germans would 've marched through belgium and defeated the french and the british as per schedule and the war would 've been over by christmas . 
  instead , we have 17 million dead . 
  thanks again , belgium !, 
  it 's probably the same word ... als\u00f3 - lower ( thing ) alatt - under ( something ) alul - beneath alf\u00f6ld - lowland , netherlands , 
  does `` al '' in that word mean low , the same as in hungarian ? 
  omg finnougric theory proven !, 
  thanks to orban 's economic genius hungary will be the richest country in the world , with 0 % immigrants :d, 
  what 's cool is that this is a recursive word so technically you can make it infinite long , 
  i think americans have some special visa agreement with germany and the netherlands , so it would be easier for you to move there . 
  who are those buddhists in kazakhstan ? 
  well , if america says so , then it must be true . 
  i would n't be surprised if they found wmds next to the bodies as well . 
  the circlejerk never stops in this forum, 
   the uk is n't an authoritarian dictatorship though . 
  why does that matter ? 
  suddenly only dictatorships do propaganda ? 
   on air who cares if they resigned on air or if they wrote an angry email after drinking too much ? 
  i do n't see why you think that your propaganda outlets are somehow better than russia 's . 
   but is independent by law i 'm pretty sure that rt is independent by law as well . 
  also , googling for `` bbc resign '' results in quite a few cases of journalists resigning over controversial issues . 
  so deep, 
  cnn or bbc, 
  holy shit , you probably got yourself on some cia terrorist suspect list for buying that much !, 
   and this is unfair . 
  there are prolly other eu companies with good nuclear technology who could make an offer it is unfair because there was no public tender . 
  however , from what i understand the russians are the best in this area . 
  they built the reactor and know everything about it . 
  other non-russian companies would probably do a second-rate job . 
  i 'm assuming / u/limitlessltd is not a russian citizen , yet he seems to fail to see the difference . 
  it makes them seem worse because they probably have no problem cooperating with us or british propaganda news services . 
  in theory you ca n't . 
  today i overtook an asshole driving 60 on a highway . 
  people like that should stick to mass transit . 
  is there any chance that romanians will start self-examination any time soon ? 
  your example of how russia took some territory and you 're being mad at them is a good one - do you think the hungarians and bulgarians should be mad at you because you took their territory ? 
  it 's not hard to describe the fidesz economic policy . 
  it 's pretty well summarized here : http://444.hu/2016/04/07/miert-lopnak-ilyen-hihetetlenul-sokat in brief , they change the laws and regulations so that their friends and allies win all the tenders , buy all the land , get all the eu financing . 
  some might call this corruption , but they call it patriotism , since their friends and allies are hungarians . 
  so if they steal from the eu , make it impossible for non-hungarian companies to compete , and divide all the arable land so it 's all owned by hungarian oligarchs , then that 's good for the hungarian economy , because the money does n't get siphoned out by the foreign companies . 
  it 's unfortunate that their hungarian opponents also lose out . 
  it 's also unfortunate that this creates a feudal system where you need to suck up to one of the oligarchs or you 'll get totally screwed . 
  and of course the population as a whole gets fucked , but they do so in either case , so it does n't matter . 
  one example , [ from today ] ( http://444.hu/2016/04/08/meszaros-lorinc-cege-nyer-hirtelen-huszmilliarddal-no-az-ar ) : they 're building a totally not needed railway line from orban viktor 's home town to budapest . 
  nevermind the fact that this line wo n't be used and it 's a waste of money , it will be financed by the eu anyway . 
  so it 's initial price was 53 billion ( 170 million euro ) , they put out a tender , meszaros lorinc , one of orban 's best friends won it , and suddenly the price goes out to 72 billion ( 230 million euros ) . 
  no one questions this , the relevant ministry already approved it and does not want to comment . 
  now , this is good for hungary , because it will be financed by the eu , the money will go into the pockets of hungarian oligarchs who will trickle-down some of it to the people doing the work . 
  it 's good as long as the eu does n't get fed up with this bullshit . 
  as expected , you hate the people you actually border with , and you like those you do n't have direct contact with . 
  it 's not fast by the time it reaches romania . 
  i swam across it many times ( during summer ), 
  to quote the austrian chancelor when he criticized hungary : this reminds me of the holocaust, 
  for all those doctors , scientists and other skilled people that western europe received , i think paying 100-200 euros/capita is a good deal, 
  are you a teenager ? 
   act of aggression on a country , croatia was n't independent back then , and many people considered it an act of defending the country from the croatian nationalist hordes . 
  i 'm not saying that 's what the conscripts believed , they probably just wanted to get the fuck out of there , but the majority of the people in serbia believed in this . 
  also , serbs in vukovar were in real danger of being killed by croat paramillitaries . 
  the only reason why they were n't killed was because the serbs won in ' 91 . 
  history could have been very different if they did n't . 
  what 's your point ? 
  people live in siberia quite safely . 
  also turkey does n't really have the ambitions to go conquer beyond its borders . 
  there are ( practically ) no turks living outside turkey . 
  why must erdogan build such a camp ? 
  why ca n't we build it in kazakhstan or some other remote place ? 
  anyone knows the name of the band ? 
  he has a facebook profile with millions of followers, 
  you probably ca n't use eu money for such a nazi-fascist endeavour . 
  hungary built its fence with its own money , probably not because we have so much of it , but because we could n't get it from elsewhere . 
  there 's already a fence on the bulgarian side . 
  the greeks ca n't do it because they 're `` in crisis '', 
  so ordinary austrians will probably never realize what hypocrites their government has been ... what 's worse , hungarians will , in time , accept their opinion as the truth . 
  because austrians are always doing everything better than we do , right , so if they say we 're racist nazis , then it 's probably true . 
  it reminds me of the joke when a hungarian husband finds his wife in bed with another man , and she says `` pista who do you believe : me , or your eyes ?! '', 
  wow , austria is so much better than hungary . 
  you guys are literally disneyland for the refugees ^ ( let 's not discuss that they are sleeping outside in the rain ) if you had any personal integrity you would come back in a few months , when austria has built 100s of kms of fence , and appologize for your hypocrisy . 
  oh wow , if there ever was such a raw display of hipocracy as in the last few months , i do n't remember it . 
   i have just trouble seeing how these registrations that transit countries go through with provide a benefit to anyone involved . 
  it 's the law . 
   our pm is already asking about where to get enough barbed wire [ not from mutanox ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-companies-refuse-to-sell-razor-wire-for-hungarys-anti-refugee-fence-a6668296.html ), 
  hey it was failing to do it for almost a year now . 
  you 're only complaining because it hit your doorstep .
