  any news from hungary ? 
  i do n't want to spend my easter waiting on the border . 
  evil deeds . 
  here are the questions in english : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/639k7i/lets_stop_brussels_government_poster_in_hungary/dft07zs/, 
  if i manage to find who won the grant then i can tell you which friend of orban 's . 
  it 's probably good for functional integration-supporting infrastructure , though, 
  `` investment into infrastructure that supports functional integration '' ~ 3 million euros you do n't even need to look at the worn down hospital . 
  just read the title of the project to figure out this money was stolen . 
  no , buy them from fabrika vagona kraljevo !, 
  good that i converted all my euros to dollars them b ), 
  pieces inhabited by kurds ... 
  i read that as obama and was thinking hmm , cia agent ? 
  this campaign is very small compared to the anti-immigrant one from last year , where everywhere in the country you had huge billboards next to each other with propaganda , and there was no place left for actual commercial advertisement . 
  i think the whole campaign cost the same price as 3 hospitals . 
  anyway , it was all paid by the government , or in other words , with my tax money . 
  here 's another long line on the staircases built with eu funds  http://24.p3k.hu/app/uploads/2017/04/brusszel-e1491416138279.jpg, 
  it says at the bottom with small letters `` made by the government of hungary '', 
  i understand that , but if there are 800.000 more voters than adult people , then that only means it 's more difficult to get 50 % + 1 , no ? 
  since you need more votes . 
  why would this help vucic ? 
  any proof about those 800.000 fake votes ? 
  why do you think it was n't democratic ? 
  because the guy you do n't like won ? 
  awesome !, 
  yep , no one is denying that . 
  read my sentence again , i said the people exercising their right to protest do n't understand how democracy works . 
  there 's nothing wrong with them protesting , the problem is only in their heads . 
  you either do n't live in serbia or you 're too young to remember the 90 's . 
  serbia was a shithole long before nato dropped a few bombs . 
  they 're not the majority . 
  the people protesting outside do n't understand the basic concept of democracy . 
  good thing they did this just before easter , so now when i visit my relatives i can wait in my fucking car for hours . 
  yes and you just had an election to see if the people care about those things or not . 
  the majority of voters said they are happy with the corruption , control of the media etc. 
  so yeah you can protest , but still you are not important . 
  it 's a popular fad , we saw this in the us when trump got elected . 
  they 're not happy with the results of democratic elections and think that protests will somehow change the status . 
   orb\u00e1n sent his daughter hungary 's president ader 's daughter is also going to the same type of school as ceu , and the list goes on ... 
  so then you do n't really know anything about the matter and you 're just making shit up ? 
   no doubt you seem awfully sure in this . 
  are you a disgruntled former ceu employee/student ? 
  women could survive by being girlfriends to ss officers . 
  ... and that exhausts my knowledge on the subject . 
  maybe i should take that course to learn more ? 
  oh wait , the uni just got banned , looks like i 'm out of luck !, 
  the economy is doing great , although people do n't agree whether it 's due to orban or due to eu grants . 
   the holocaust was an indiscriminate mass murder of millions of people . 
  there 's nothing a gender lens can add to it i 'm not an expert at all on this subject , but even i know that men and women were treated differently in auschwitz . 
  not better or worse , just differently . 
  which is why you * can * apply a gender lense on studying the subject . 
  and let 's not get into the subject of how transgender people got treated ... 
  no one wants to shut down any universities !, 
  it 's just that they made a law which will make it difficult for ceu to continue to operate in hungary . 
  as long as they follow the law , we 're good ... until they change the law again mwhahaa, 
  when the robots take over , all countries will have an anthem title similar to bosnia 's, 
  i want that free poster !, 
  i do n't think this is blaming the education system at all . 
  if you want your child to have the best possible education and you can afford it , then there 's no way a public school will be able to match that . 
  even if the public school pays for all the equipment and provides the best possible environment , you still ca n't have all the teachers be the best . 
  brilliant teachers are not found around every corner , and those that do exist usually work for a school which pays them well ( better than the public school system ) . 
  foreigners exchanging their money at the budapest railway station , where the fx rate is up to 30 % worse than 100 meters down the street . 
  it 's always weird to see tourists standing in line to get 1/3 of their money stolen from them . 
  are you telling me your dutch keyboard has both the \u00e9 and \u00e8 keys ? 
  yeah that 's pretty cool , in western europe . 
  and then you arrive to hungary : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs-sqhoi9hy, 
  if the migrants start arriving to greece at 10.000 / day rate then those tourists will go elsewhere . 
  i visited turkey in 2009 , 2010 and 2011 and stayed over 2 months in around 10 different cities . 
  it is ( was ) an amazing , rich and friendly country , i do n't understand what 's happening to it lately . 
  seriously , this is just one guy killing a cop , why make such a big deal out of it ? 
  people get killed all the time and cities do n't put out a lightshow for them . 
  the melodrama is really becoming painful lately ... 
  finno-ugric-turk connection confirmed !, 
  why are they in different colors on this map btw ? 
   ; ah yes , i recognize the greek question mark from [ the worst programming language ever ] ( https://www.infoq.com/presentations/worst-programming-language ) ( 23rd minute ), 
  in serbian it 's `` vukojebina '' , which means place where wolves fuck, 
  so they 'll get to slovenia where there is some resistance . 
   greece are front line defense lol, 
  you mean those migrants will get through two walls of barbed wire , armed vehicles and helicopters ? 
  how ? 
  photoshopped . 
  proof : no rain . 
  german politicians said that most of the benefits that eastern europeans get are actually grants that usually german companies win , since ee companies ca n't compete . 
  not saying it has n't done a whole lot in eastern europe , only that the germans benefited a lot from it as well . 
   issues like the cyprus dispute one example is the dispute between hungary and romania . 
  yet the two countries managed to sign a peace treaty and the issue was settled . 
  https://www.jstor.org/stable/20698661?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents so it 's not true eastern europeans did n't have similar ethnic/territorial issues . 
  they just managed to settle it . 
  yeah but those were mostly empty areas no one else wanted . 
  when you take a look at places that actually mattered ( cities in germany ) , sweden kept those for only a few years . 
  let 's hope we 'll see a refreshed edition of this picture soon . 
  serbia or macedonia are neither eu nor schengen . 
  eu citizens can enter serbia with an id card . 
  serb citizens require a passport to enter the eu . 
  i would guess a similar scheme would be set up for britain as well . 
  i do n't think the eu ever wanted to become a military power , and without military power projection it can never replace the usa . 
  the whole purpose of the eu is to * not * be a military power . 
  they also need carrots in order to remain yellow . 
  i was in se asia for about 4 months and of course i ate the food they had .
