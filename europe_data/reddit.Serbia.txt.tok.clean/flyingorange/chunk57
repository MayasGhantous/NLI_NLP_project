  i wanted to see more from that dog, 
  the american * people * did n't go through the same horrors the europeans did during the two world wars . 
  it seems noble to quote some wise sayings about war and armament , but your ancestors were not in concentration camps , or massacred , you are n't the grandchild of the only survivor of a family of 15 , you did n't have your entire ancestral wealth destroyed over and over by various invading powers , or puppet regimes installed by those powers . 
  i might add , those massacres and destructions could 've been avoided had my ancestors just bended over . 
  this is something they realized themselves , since * fighting * did n't achieve a better life for themselves , it had only gotten worse . 
  let 's also not forget that the ukraine thing started when the us and eu staged a coup to overthrow the democratically elected president , who happened to be a russian ally , and installed a government of ukrainan nationalists that instilled fear in every ethnic minority in ukraine ( not just the russians , but hungarians too ) . 
  so saying that you need an army `` because of russia '' is kind of stupid , since `` russia '' happened exactly because you were fucking around with him in the first place . 
  europe went through some of the worst wars in human history and several generations grew up denouncing war forever . 
  the same goes for me , i 'm totally opposed to any military spending , i wish they 'd just abolish it altogether . 
  or we can build a gigantic wall and make mexico pay for it !, 
  smog map : https://www.idokep.hu/szmog it 's not as bad now . 
  on monday some parts had over 400 ( beijing on its worst days has 600 ), 
  hair styles in the past 100 years : https://youtu.be/dqyh7gjxfeu, 
  holy shit there 's also a video of all the regions of russia !, 
  in between the lines you can hear the video saying `` kill me please '', 
  you still have that in most countries . 
  for example , you pay yaxes , the yax money is being spent on schools . 
  you do n't have kids so you gain no benefit ie . 
  you 're subsidizing other people 's children . 
  novi sad also has a hill and a fortress on the other side of the danube, 
  they should give nintendo playstations to prisoners like in sweden , maybe then the ecthr will be less critical . 
  earth is also changing all the time , for example from the photons we receive from the sun , or the water we receive from meteorites . 
  [ this website ] ( https://www.quora.com/if-energy-is-always-conserved-are-we-sharing-a-finite-amount-of-energy-with-an-infinite-amount-of-universe ) says that energy is infinite as long as the universe is infinite . 
  yeah but forests regrow too . 
  brazil 's area is 27x that of poland , so in theory tgey shoukd 've cut out all trees in the past 3 decades ... but it did n't happen . 
  as for europe , it has more forests now than 100 years ago . 
  so this resource is n't finite either in practical terms . 
  the universe is finite ? 
  the greek people need to start paying taxes before they `` deserve '' anything . 
  no , everyone agrees that it 's your right to leave the gym whenever you want . 
  the issue is you want to keep on being fit by using the gym 's facilities , while at the same time not paying membership fees anymore , and saying it 's * practical * for the gym to keep you in as a member . 
  who is this `` we '' ? 
  sooner or later the politically correct establishment will need to admit that it set up a coup against a democratically elected pro-russian president and installed fascists in his place , which lead to widespread fear among the monorities and eventually triggered the separation of the crimea and harkov . 
  until that happens , the extremists will be able to use truth for their own goals . 
  we can expect more trumps as long as the establishment bases its power on lies . 
  how is it * practical * for * us * to follow * your * interest instead of * ours * ? 
  but we do n't want to change freedom of movement . 
  why do n't * you * change ? 
  i 've read about the women 's rights movement in the uk and they were being oppressed more and more as the years went by . 
  if it had n't been for ww1 , it might 've become brutal . 
  that war brought more than just technological advance ... 
   so we should just do what the big guys in the neighbourhood want us to do ? 
  just bend over as soon as they raise their voices ? 
  that 's a gross oversimplification of the events of ' 98-99 . 
  but ok , even if we assume that nato was a 2-dimensional villain , then yes , serbia should 've bended over and accepted the treaty . 
  you know why ? 
  because later it accepted it anyway + a lot more + dead people + billions in damages . 
  a guy with some brains would 've figured out it 's better to retreat now and fight another day when the stacks are in your favor . 
  a moron will go and fight - let me repeat - the biggest military coalition on the planet , lose badly , and ruin any chance of a favorable resolution later on . 
  if serbia had accepted rambuillet , kosovo later might not have the international support for its independence . 
  maybe 5-10 years later serbia could push to get it incorporated back . 
  however , instead it chose to fight a battle it can not possibly win and lose everything playing a romantic 19th century macho man . 
   well , except for ottoman repression and blablabla ... oh it 's so tough !, 
  are you saying the cambodians or the tutsi or the thousands of other people in the world who had it ** worse ** than the serbs in their history are entitled to even more `` justice '' than the serbs ? 
  well apples and pears are sort of similar , i think they 're in the same family . 
  return sudetenland to germans !, 
  oh cry me a river  rambouillet is not a document that an angelic serb could have accepted they accepted much more than rambuillet after the bombing . 
  could n't we have just skipped the bombing and not go to war against the strongest coalition on the planet ? 
  also , serbs are human beings just like any other normal human being . 
  fuck that shit about what `` angelic '' serbs should or should not have accepted . 
  that sort of bullshit how serbs are different/better than everyone else is the reason why serbia is the poorest ( or 2nd poorest ) country in europe right now . 
  what 's the romanian government 's position on bringing in immigrants from asia or africa ? 
  this is what france did when they faced a similar position . 
  in hungary there is also a great shortage of workers and the unemployment is like 3 % , but the government said it will never allow dirty immigrants from a foreign culture to settle on our sacred soil . 
  as usual , they send a clean and expensive train which probably no one uses to kosovo . 
  at the same time , the budapest-belgrade train , which is regularly overcrowded , has only two cars that were built in the 1950s , smell horribly , are dirty , go at a whopping speed of 40 km/h and have no heating during winter . 
  why spend money on something people actually use when you can spend it on fucking kosovo ? 
  that map is so \u00fcber awesome !, 
  austria received some hungarian clay after ww1 so there 's certainty a precedent ... 
  teachers need to supervise a snowball fight ?? 
  what for ? 
  what 's the point if everything is tightly supervised and controlled ? 
  these supervised kids will happily put a chip in their arm when they grow up and let big brother watch over them 24/7 . 
  i ca n't believe someone actually wants to raise people like these . 
  how is a snowball fight risky ? 
  it 's snow !, 
  just because someone * may * but gravel in the snow and * may * hurt someone does n't mean it should be banned for all . 
  with the same logic you should ban all cars because they * may * kill you , in fact i think it 's much more likely that you 'll die in a car accident than lose your eye sight from someone mixing gravel in a snowball and managing to hit your eyes and not some other part of your body . 
  snowball fights teach kids many social skills like cooperation , betrayal , victory , dealing with losing etc. 
  what other activity do you suggest that is equivalent to a snowball fight ? 
  how does one post `` violently '' ? 
  thread about muslims and austria ? 
  ctrl + f `` hitler '' , was not disappointed !, 
  seriously , i 'm not on anyone 's side in that conflict , but if france is so concerned about oppressed people then when will it start labeling products from muslim myanmar or kurdish turkey or tibet or the other 200 + similar regions of the world ? 
  this is just hypocrisy . 
  [ this article ] ( https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/zala_ ( keresztn % c3 % a9v \\ ) ) ( in hungarian ) says that it 's an old hungarian personal name , which originally came from slovenian . 
  [ this article ] ( https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/zala_ ( ime \\ ) ) ( in slovenian ) says that zala is a nickname for rozalija . 
  i lived in slovenia for several years and never heard of anyone named zala , but i guess it 's possible . 
  does this mean government propaganda like [ this ] ( http://24.p3k.hu/app/uploads/2016/08/tudta-e1471094522279.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://sztarklikk.hu/image/fb_og/294053.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.mrm.kormany.hu/attachment/thumbnail/1200x525x-1/00/00/illegalis-bevandorlok.2.jpg ) or [ even this website ] ( http://nepszavazas2016.kormany.hu/ ) are illegal now ? 
  translation : * did you know ? 
  more than 1.5 million illegal immigrants entered europe last year * brussels wants to plant a whole city of illegal immigrants into hungary * we do n't want illegal immigrants !, 
  who would watch this shit ? 
  90 % of the people ( who actually own a tv ) only watch big brother and soap operas . 
  portuguese pastry is awesome !!!, 
  i gained a few kg this summer when visiting portugal only because of them . 
  most of those are n't really slavic food . 
  shashlyk is turkish . 
  prekmurska gibanica is hungarian/jewish ( see : flodni ) . 
  sarma is turkish . 
  i 'd say only borsht is slavic cousine , if there is such a thing .
