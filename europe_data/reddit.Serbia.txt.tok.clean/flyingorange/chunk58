  i 'd actually call it russian/ukrainan . 
  even if the hungarians themselves did n't mix with the local population ( which they did ) , there was this thing called the mongol invasion which killed 1/3 of the population ( and i guess most women got raped ) , and then there was an ottoman invasion which killed 1/2 of the population ( and i guess most women got raped ) , and a few other people passed through as well over the centuries ... 
  so it 's not easy keeping your genetics pure when everyone 's trying to murder & rape you . 
  and he became prime minister in 1999 . 
  what a coincidence ... 
  czechs and slovaks hate everybody  ), 
   have a nice day . 
  why thank you !, 
  have a nice day yourself as well , 
  link to the official decision ? 
  [ sure , why not .

   former warsaw pact yugoslavia was not in warsaw pact . 
  now what ? 
  because if you look at the map , the sava river + danube cuts off the balkans from the rest of europe . 
  you mean lvov which used to be an austro-hungarian fort . 
  harkov or sevastopol are definitely noy central european . 
  everything south of sava is balkans , which is why slovenia and croatia are included . 
  wikipedia says in 1910 there were 10k slovaks and 32 +31 germans and hungarians . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_bratislava in 1930 , there were 60k slovaks and 32 +18 germans + hungarians . 
  was n't ww2 in 1940 ? 
  where did the 13k hungarians disappear ? 
  where did the 50k slovaks come from ? 
  what happened in just 10 years of peaceful cohabitation in this democratic paradise ? 
  and somehow in this multicultural paradise the city of pozsony/pressburg turned from a hungarian-german city into bratislava with 95 % slovaks . 
  what happened ? 
  previous government did the same , except * worse *, 
  no joke about split ? 
  the bridge looks like ottoman architecture, 
  i hate charts like this . 
  when i did n't have money i just hitchhiked , couchsurfed and found ways to travel , and i 've been to a lot of places . 
  people who complain they ca n't travel because they ca n't afford 5-start luxury hotels should n't count in tourist statistics . 
  policemen and military are turks . 
  i was in urfa . 
  very nice place . 
  i loved the huge sacred fish and abraham 's cave . 
  i think the local metal bands from the middle east gather in greece , where they have more freedom and resources to publish their music . 
  my favorite egyptian black metal band published their album in greece , for example , since satanism is banned in egypt . 
  well yeah , they had cannons back when this castle was functional , so it did n't require a prolonged siege . 
  however i think it was never captured by the turks . 
  not brussels but charleroi . 
  it 's important , because the flight from budapest to brussels costs 14 eur , and the bus ticket from charleroi to brussels costs another 16 eur . 
  so the actual cost is 30 eurs . 
  how many horthy statues exist in romanian cities or cities with significant romanian populations ? 
  which hungarian war criminals have streets named after them in romania , * examples * please ? 
  i think you are just talking bullshit and trying to justify the ethnic cleansing of hungarians . 
  it 's like germans trying to defend gebels . 
  too bad he could n't produce an heir . 
  too bad he could n't produce an heir . 
  was n't avram iancu a mass murderer that tried to ethnically cleanse hungarians ? 
  why a statue for him ? 
  i always thought scandinavian countries are known for their collectivist culture . 
  it was my idea so i ca n't be picked !, 
  exactly . 
  when i go on my summer vacation or to a concert or anywhere thete are always masses of noisy people . 
  their numbers should be cut by over 60 %, 
  the germans did n't want to live in czechoslovakia , they were forced to by greedy benes . 
  the same guy that wanted a corridor to connect with yugoslavia . 
  that 's the point , does n't matter how you try to explain the situation with side-facts . 
  `` czechs and slovaks '' are not one people but two separate ones . 
  for example , there were more germans than slovaks . 
  croatia is so expensive . 
  in dubrovnik parking is 10 $ / hour . 
  tbh the czechs and slovaks were a minority in their own country . 
  perhaps if benes was less greedy during the ww1 peace talks then they would have neighbors that did n't want to liberate their fellow nationalities . 
  the byzantine empire was n't really a fairyrale to live in tho . 
  there 's a reason why many christian territories surrendered without a fight . 
  there are graffiti 's here and there saying `` i 'm not paying taxes for this '' . 
  like op said , what can you do ? 
  i agree . 
  there have been many complaints by ngos not just in hungary but elsewhere , saying that eu funds are distorting the market and moving countries into a direction they would n't otherwise go . 
  the current oligarchy in hungary did not exist in 2010 and they 've all been made rich by eu funds . 
  even if eu stops the funding right now , these people will still have money and they will still influence hungarian politics for years . 
  that money gives them so much power that they can make hungary look like a conservative christian country that hates refugees , when in reality the people are more like elsewhere , some care , some do n't ... technically the problem is n't that an oligarchy was created , but that it was built based on inefficient usage of eu funds . 
  lots of waste companies were created ( owned by family members of orban and friends ) that have 0 productivity but they syphon away all the money that might 've been used elsewhere . 
  the people and companies that are actually efficient and innovative do n't get a chance to compete , so they go broke and/or move to w.europe . 
  if you still want to stay and survive , you need to either belong to a sector of the economy that the government does n't care about ( like it ) or follow the official line . 
  in the 2nd case it 's dangerous to fight against the government because you will lose all funding or , in the worst case , they will write a law specifically targetting you . 
  your company will get destroyed or banned and then a government buddy will buy it for cents . 
  yeah but that 's just because you 're catholic serbs , and serbs have good humor . 
  they broke up with the soviets because the soviets were too soft . 
  later they also broke up with the chinese after mao died . 
  i 'll be there next week , so i 'll let you know, 
  reptilians . 
  accord to law , these rune signs can actually be used for official city name signs ( next to the latin sign ) . 
  here 's a list of all the cities that use it : https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/rov%c3%a1st%c3%a1bl%c3%a1s_telep%c3%bcl%c3%a9sek_list%c3%a1ja, 
  we had parody posters [ like this ] ( http://galeria.cdn.index.hu/belfold/2017/05/03/a_ketfarku_kutya_part_plakatokon_parodizalja_a_nemzeti_konzultaciot/16866820_cd1865fd66be5208b7b74b91e2b3e72b_y.jpg ) last month , 
  it 's flour , sugar and water , so it was probably invented by cavemen . 
  back when everyone knew that k\u00fcrt\u00f6skal\u00e1cs was hungarian and not thief-czech/slovak/romanian, 
  maybe in 50 years it will catch up with w.europe, 
  what about croatia ? 
  serbia beacon of democracy !, 
  without that green box on the map , slovenia effectively has no access to the adriatic sea and the rest of the world . 
  every sea that enters slovenia needs to first register with italian or croatian authorities . 
  now this is n't such a big problem since they 're all in the eu , but the added bureaucracy makes transportation companies prefer trieste or rijeka over the port of koper . 
  there are huge moneys involved here , and it 's not the size of the territory that matters . 
  when the potatos take over , statues like this will be mandatory everywhere . 
  pretty sure the romans invented cement , which that aqueduct has . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oracle_america,_inc._v._google,_inc . 
  well of course oracle will say this , they 've been butthurt ever since they lost their lawsuit regarding java .
