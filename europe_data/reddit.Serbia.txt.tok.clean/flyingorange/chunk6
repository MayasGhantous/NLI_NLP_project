  this is part of a general plan to make all utilities non-profit , since they are essential for living a modern life . 
  similarly the banks used to make lots of money and were exporting it outside the country to support their `` home base '' , now they do n't make that much money and their home base has to sometimes support them . 
  previously there was a proportional tax where the rich paid more , now there 's a flat tax so the rich pay less and the poor pay more . 
  the `` rich '' should be understood more as above-average . 
  for example i as a software developer make around 100 euros more than i used to , while my wife makes 50 euros less . 
  in the end it does n't balance itself out so some additional sources of funding was needed , and i think they solved that by raising the vat from 25 % to 27 % well there are many other aspects . 
  for example , previously the unemployed were receiving benefits just for sitting at home , now they have to do public works like cleaning the streets . 
  the state can save money by not having to pay a street cleaning company , while the people working also are n't falling into unemployment apathy . 
  i 'm not saying it 's all great and wonderful but we 're living in capitalism and within the existing framework i think the overall message that you have to work for a living and everyone should get the fruit of his labor is a positive thing . 
  the point is they did n't solve these problems by getting more into debt , and the deficit was under 3 % for three years in a row . 
  the socialist government never managed to do this . 
  hungary might actually qualify for adopting the euro since the deficit criterium is fulfilled , except that the country 's debt is at 80 % of the gdp while the requirement is 50 % i think . 
  back when the socialists took power in 2002 the public debt was 55 % , so they basically left us no chance of joining for years to come . 
  the short answer is yes , because the constitutional court said so , and the eu did n't oppose it either . 
  i think what you 're asking is was it moral to make such a decision . 
  the problem was these people took their loans back when 1 chf was like 120 forints , without realizing the risks . 
  recent court rulings also said the banks mislead their clients so currently there 's a court process going on ( due in may ) to decide if the contracts are valid at all . 
  one of the reasons why the socialists received such bad results in the elections is because they were the ones who fucked up and did nothing to inform the public . 
  other countries in the region also have these problems with swiss frank loans ( croatia for example ) , but none of them are as bad as in hungary . 
  i do n't remember correctly but i think something like 20 % of the gdp went just on paying the monthly rate . 
  one typical example was a person who bought his car for 1 million forints , already paid back half of that sum , and still owed another 1 million . 
  you might remember this was the time when the swiss government said it will not allow the franc to go above 1.3 euros . 
  this calmed things down a bit . 
  since the customers bought at 120 ft and the law decreed a fixed rate of 170 ft , the banks were still profitting those 50 ft , the customers were also punished for their stupidity , basically everyone got the stick . 
  at least now both sides learned not to do it again . 
  there are extremist parties that demand the abolishon of the loans completely ie . 
  the state would pay for those people 's houses , but luckily they did n't come to power . 
  the stuff you ( and i ) listed , you 'll have to explain why any of them is bad and what would in your opinion be a better alternative . 
  i do n't know what a ` putin model ' is , from my point of view putin did a lot of good things as well ( do n't crucify me ) , but the problems with his rule are agressive nationalism , massive corruption , no freedom of the press , changing the laws to stay in power for more than a decade and the opression of gay and other minorities . 
  the hungarian government did none of these things ( there 's corruption but on a much lower scale and it was part of the system since forever ) . 
  as i wrote , the people voted for the better choice . 
  there was a high turnout , in budapest it was over 70 % , so it 's not like people did n't feel there 's no good choice . 
  some reasons for their popularity : * flat tax , which favors the well-off and educated * reduced utility costs by ~ 20 % , which is great for the poor * opposed the banks which were squeezing those in debt ( moratorium on taking away the house if you ca n't pay , converting swiss frank loans to forint at an unfavorable rate ( should be 1 chf = 240 huf , but they introduced a law saying the bank has to exchange it at 1 chf = 180 huf ) , special tax on the banks * tough on crime ( many new policemen , harsher crime laws , you may now kill an intruder in your house if he poses a life threat while previously you could choose between getting killed or going to jail ) * supporting families ( more money for more children , support for women to easily go back to work after pregnancy ) there were many bad moves as well and also corruption scandals , but these did n't seem to matter that much it seems . 
  even without the gerrmandering they 've won 44 % of the votes and , in numbers , 1 million more than the socialists who are the 2nd place . 
  the no. 1 reason i think is there 's no party that can offer a better solution than what the fidesz government can ( which is a twisted way of saying they 've won because they were the best ) . 
  torrents are an illegal source ? 
  what 's illegal about them ? 
  that 's true , but that goes against him claiming stockholm to be an innovation center . 
  the innovation happened in estonia , stockholm only happened to be the financing center . 
  skype was developed by estonians , the swedish guy only provided the money . 
  because of this :  what liberties will orb\u00e1n take next ? 
  and what if others in the eu start following his example ? '', 
  orban has not taken any liberties so far , so it 's ridiculous to ask what will he take `` next '' . 
  please , no propaganda articles . 
  finally swedish public workers are adopting the working hours of eastern european bureaucracies . 
  eli5 why is it significant ? 
  the map is missing the huge bondsteel base in kosovo , which leads me to believe this is not really researched well . 
  trash propaganda and lies . 
   orb\u00e1n opened gas pipeline with croatia last week . 
  that was actually slovakia ( [ article ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/energy/hungary-and-slovakia-link-their-gas-grids-301208 ) ) . 
   500 thousand left hungary last year * since * 2010 , 335 thousand have left the country , so that 's the * total * of 4 years . 
  if you remember , we had an economic crisis back then . 
  also , it was never explained if those hundreds of thousands are actually hungarians that used to live in hungary , or newly registered citizens from outside the country , who gained the citizenship in order to be able to work in countries like germany . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=hu&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fhataratkelo.blog.hu%2f2013%2f07%2f12%2fhanyan_is_vagyunk_hataratkelok&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) an article with some more details . 
   250 thousand are cleaning the streets in december 2013 there were 203 thousand workers doing public works ( [ article ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=hu&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fnol.hu%2fgazdasag%2f20140222-csucson_a_kozmunkasok_szama-1446441 ) ) . 
  these people used to be out of work and receiving social handouts , now they are forced to work and receive minimum salary . 
  at least they are doing something and are n't falling into unemployment apathy . 
   also , is orby really trying to take credit for the general eu recovery ? 
  i do n't see why not . 
  back when the economy was doing bad ( together with the rest of europe ) , the leftist media had no problem blaming it on the government 's actions . 
  interesting , i wonder if we 'll see something similar in hungary next week , where fidesz also would like to retain a 2/3 majority needed to change the constitution . 
  maybe people will vote just so they would n't get it . 
  in an article i 've read says that the two countries use the same methodology for predicting election results , and if they failed to predict the winner in slovakia , then it means the current hungarian estimates might be inaccurate too . 
  this is a surprise for me who does n't follow slovak politics at all . 
  was n't fico supposed to win ? 
  hungary is a bigger player than estonia and still the russians retaliated . 
  let 's not assume the russians are morons and they wo n't care if you diss them . 
  you are not looking at the whole picture , and some cia statistics certainly wo n't tell you what is happening . 
  you should understand that a democratic country does not make decisions on the whim of its leader . 
  hungary does not oppose sanctions against russia because it loves russians , or because its prime minister fancies putin . 
  just like any government , they are being lobbied by businesses to do something . 
  the current attitude towards russia tells us that those businesses are significant enough for the government to do what it did now . 
  before i continue , you should understand that all the countries in the visegrad group are in the same situation , so this is not a unilateral decision . 
  other than poland , these are all export-driven countries , their markets are not big enough to support growth through domestic consumption . 
  also , these three pronged sanctions as you mentioned do not mean the russians wo n't retaliate in other ways that would hurt us , as they have shown with estonia recently . 
  the ** first ** and most obvious problem is that hungary imports most of its energy needs from russia . 
  if they would retaliate , then it 's possible the next winter will be cold . 
  the ** second ** problem is the deal the government signed with rossatom before this crisis started . 
  the hungarian government wants to modernize its nuclear power plant to reduce its energy dependency in a decade , but until then it needs russian loan to pay for the work . 
  the loan is estimated to be at around 10 % of the gdp , and will be paid over 30 years . 
  the ** third ** problem is that exports to russia would suffer . 
  hungary has a large agricultural sector which employs more % of the population than the % of gdp they produce . 
  it is at around 6 % of the gdp and employs 8 % of the population ( in some regions it 's 6 % , in others 12 % ) . 
  there are in total 4.053.000 people employed in hungary , that means 486.360 are employed in agriculture . 
  coincidentally , most of hungarian exports to russia are agricultural products . 
  for example , more than 50 % of all meat exports goes to russia . 
  meat makes 25 % of all agricultural exports . 
  so let 's say the russians decide to retaliate by not importing meat anymore . 
  suddenly meat export falls by 50 % and total agricultural exports fall 12,5 % . 
  since 486.360 people work in agriculture , this means that perhaps 50 thousand people will have their jobs endangered . 
  the ** fourth ** problem is that hungary has a relatively significant pharmaceutical industry . 
  for example , 30 % of richter gedeon 's exports go to russia . 
  since richter is one of the 3 companies that make up the `` msci hungary stock index '' , if its profits get damaged then that could mean serious problems for the hungarian stock exchange . 
  finally , the [ latest hungarian government statistics from march 2014 ] ( https://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xftp/gyor/kul/kul21312.pdf ) say that 10,9 % of all exports go to `` non-eu european countries '' . 
  this could of course mean moldova or azerbaijan too , but most likely it 's mostly russia . 
  the exports to `` non-eu european countries '' rose 7,1 % compared to the previous year , must faster than to the eu countries . 
  this leads to the ** fifth ** problem . 
  the eu market is `` saturated '' and competition is much higher than in other markets ( someone here said they demand much higher quality goods than what we can produce ) . 
  it is the job of the hungarian government to find markets where hungarian companies may export to . 
  in recent years russia ( and china ) became the fastest growing export markets .
