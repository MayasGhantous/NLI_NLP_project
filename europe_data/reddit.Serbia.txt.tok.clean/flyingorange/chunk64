  and now imagine hungary blocking romania 's eu access because of this and in 2012 you 're still not in the eu . 
  or more currently , let 's say hungary blocks croatia today because they claim the [ zrinyi family ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_zrinski ) as their own and even print them on their money . 
  it 's so ridiculous it 's ridiculous even by eastern european standards !, 
  if the french started claiming william the conqueror as their own would that bother you ? 
  seriously . 
  because i ca n't see why anyone would give a fuck . 
  those people are from 1000 + years in the past . 
  the `` culture '' that they 're stealing is not even yours anymore , it 's some medieval culture of a medieval people you might not even genetically or linguistically be related with . 
   macedonia is also claiming many bulgarian heroes including tsar samue and you block eu access ** for that ? 
  ** sorry , but that is just r e t a r d e d . in the case of the multi-ethnic hungarian kingdom , some of the greatest , * most important * ( as in , they 're printed on our moneys ) national heros are claimed by hungarians , romanians , slovaks , croats , serbs and probably a few others . 
  no one gives a fuck . 
  it does n't make modern national policy . 
  really , how did bulgaria get into the eu ? 
  is n't there some pre-condition that first you must settle all disputes with your neighbors , ie . 
  get your act together ? 
  it boggles the mind ... 
  ok let 's assume there was one british military advisor that was flying over the territory once and we count that as an invasion ; what about countries like slovenia that did n't exist before 1991 ? 
  they never got invaded ... 
  is n't brussels already supposed to be the common enemy ? 
  this is why i 'm mad at the bulgarians , they 're sabotaging a great plan by not letting the macedonians join the circlejerk . 
  they may have fought against the kuk but there were no british invasion troops on austria-hungarian territory . 
  the french were in charge there , the british concentrated more on the ottoman empire . 
  in this case , the bulgarians think they liberated macedonia in 1904 or something , while the macedonians think they got invaded by the bulgarians . 
  the bulgarians blocked macedonia cause they wo n't admit they got liberated !, 
  damn those ungrateful macedonians !, 
  what is considered an invasion ? 
  imo they need to have troops on the ground of a foreign country before they can say they have invaded a country . 
  for example , when have they invaded any of the following countries : hungary , romania , slovakia , slovenia , croatia ? 
  why the fuck is bulgaria in the eu ? 
  blocking another country because they see their own history differently than you is not at all acceptable . 
  how can you distinguish a hungarian doctor from a non-hungarian ? 
  that 's * exactly * what german headhunters are doing in hungary . 
  that 's a bit contradictory . 
  i just checked the [ canadian migration website ] ( http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/apply-who.asp ) and it says  as of july 1 , 2012 , citizenship and immigration canada ( cic ) has temporarily stopped accepting applications for the federal skilled worker program there 's also that thing with the pre-existing job offer ...  for your application to be eligible for processing , you must : have a valid offer of arranged employment so even if they had n't temporarily stopped their skilled migrants program , those people would still not be eligible unless they already have a job offer , which i find unlikely . 
  like i said , i have n't been to the uk so i only met them when they were abroad . 
  holy shit !, 
  and here i am , complaining that they have n't answered my emails ... 
  brits move out , hungarians move in, 
  have n't been to either the uk or australia , but after meeting people from both countries i rather like british people ( funny , outgoing ) and rather hate australians ( stupid , materialistic ) . 
  of course they 're both horrid when they 're drunk , but i 'm talking about what they 're like when they 're not , 
  well that 's just wonderful !, 
  that 's very interesting , thank you for the post . 
  i 'm surprised that slovenia scored so high , though . 
  and neither is poland hyper-religious or extremely right wing . 
  well no , kind of like this : + [ + + if you call that writing then i do n't see why we do n't go further and call them an advanced culture of [ brainfuck programmers ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brainfuck ) , 
  that does n't look like writing , more like someone accidentally scribed a + on the wall ... 
  `` not fucking up '' would be a positive thing had he been reigning during a time of peace and growth . 
  since he became president during a depression and the us fighting 2,5 wars , his minimum responsibility would be to fix those things , and i 'm not sure if he did . 
  it 's a democracy but it has [ flaws ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/language_policy_in_france#opposition_to_language_policy ) . 
  i do n't really follow american politics so i 've no idea what romney stands for , but obama was a really shitty president so far , i ca n't remember anything memorable he did in the past 4 years . 
  in that sense he would n't get my vote . 
  why would i , someone who always kept his balance above 0 for the past year and a half , risk losing my job and getting banned from entering any eu country for minimum 5 years , over 500 $ ? 
  not even a loan of 500 $ , a minus !, 
  let me explain how a minus works . 
  your monthly paycheck is 1500 $ and you receive it each month on the 15th . 
  on september 16th you go -650 on your bank account and run away to south america , never to be seen again . 
  your employer is furious , but on novermber 15th he still has to pay you for the work you 've done till the 16th , that is , 50 % . 
  1500 x 0,5 = 750 $ -650 + 750 = 100 $ the bank is 100 $ in plus . 
  ** there is no way for the bank to lose money on this . 
  ** they basically rejected me just because . 
  also , like i said , bank # 4 did issue me a credit card , i just had to go through 3 other banks to find one that does n't suck . 
  oh and bank # 1 , i forgot to close the bank account/didn ' t have time , when i stopped using them i had around 33 $ left . 
  a year or so later i go and close the account , i 'm in -10 $ . 
  i never received any notice or anything , i 'm guessing that they were just waiting for me to go into -100000 and then put me in jail . 
  really ? 
  is it like this ? 
  in slovenia i needed 500 $ quickly , for something important . 
  i went to the bank , they said i as a foreigner can not get a loan , cause i 'll run away . 
  i need to find a citizen to guarantee for me . 
  the other solution is to increase my minus from 150 to 650 $ ( i would have to go above 0 after each paycheck ) . 
  i said yeah , let 's do it . 
  a week later they inform me that my request has been denied and they charged me 20 $ for the service !, 
  needless to say that `` important thing '' i mentioned failed awfully ... 
  i wanted a credit card to be able to order over the internets . 
  i ca n't get a credit card , i 'm a foreigner . 
  they gave me an `` internet card '' and a little calculator , without batteries ( had to buy them myself  ) . 
  i went to a website and made an order , i get redirected to a bank page telling me to type in my bank number into the calculator . 
  i do that , and it gives me another number , to type into the website . 
  i do that too , and it tells me it 's the wrong number . 
  two attempts more and the card is blocked . 
  the bank tells me i need to buy another one for 20-30 $ i had to manage some bureocracy and i need a paper stating how much money i have . 
  the bank charges me 10 $ for this `` service '' . 
  and let 's not even mention that they charged me 1 $ for every bill that i paid ( 1 for electricity , 1 for water , 1 for internet etc. 
  etc. ), 
  and that i had to wait in line for half an hour even though there were only 2 people in front of me . 
  even the clerk 's name was ridiculous : roman fister . 
  i kept thinking about a guy fisting romans  ) i tried to take a photo of his name card once but he returned too quickly . 
  god i never knew how good i had it in non-eu serbia before i moved over . 
  only after changing 3 banks did a colleague recommend a bank that does everything electronically , so i never had to see their ugly faces again . 
  no i think you 're just trolling . 
  that other post about poland is a sure sign . 
  while couchsurfing i spent time with 6 different people , 4 of them listened to some form of metal . 
  the other 2 did n't , but they did drink raki ( even the guy in the holy city of urfa ) . 
  from my viewpoint turks are totally european . 
  it 's just disgusting that the serbian president involves himself with church issues . 
  first of all , serbia is a secular country and second , not everyone in serbia is orthodox . 
  this is one of the reasons why i 'm happy i 'm not a taxpayer there anymore , i do n't want 1 cent of my taxes to go to any church , especially one that [ refuses to deal with pedophiles ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/insight/opinions.php?nav_id=70774 ) and actually supports them . 
  maybe not to you . 
  as someone who lived in slovenia , you do get to feel it on your paycheck though . 
  also slovenian banking system is a nightmare , in * serbia * i had better experience with banks than in slovenia .
