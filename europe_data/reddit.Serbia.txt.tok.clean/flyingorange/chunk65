  i remember that , and also that lichtenstein was suing slovakia because the commies nationalized some lichtensteinian property 60 years ago and they do n't want to return it . 
  all these hostilities will have to be resolved before lichtenstein is allowed in . 
  i suggested to a japanese colleague of mine that japan should join and adopt the euro , but he just smiled and said no :(, 
   also switzerland , norway and iceland can join anytime . 
  iceland ca n't join . 
  the eu is not a charity and we should n't accept bankrupt countries . 
  i do n't think they use european power outlets . 
  it ca n't happen till they change to our superior technology . 
  what about those turks that listen to black metal and drink beer/raki ? 
  no , turks are far more industrious . 
  i could imagine living in turkey because everything just works there , while in greece i had trouble getting from one village to another because there 's just one taxi covering the whole area ( ie . 
  people do n't see a business oportunity even when it 's so obvious ) . 
  they also differ in mentality . 
  greeks are just greeks , ~ ~ everyone ~ ~ every guy has a beard , has an orthodox cross , complains about not having a job . 
  turks in izmir are very atheist , in kayseri they 're very religious , in trabzon they 're almost eastern european , in alanya they 're like italians ... 
  it will make more sense after the cloning vats are built . 
  i agree . 
  they should get the same status as norway or switzerland . 
  turkey gets economic benefits , eu gets nice beaches and does n't have to border iraq and syria . 
  what about lichtenstein ? 
  for too long have they been a torn in both austria 's and switzerland 's eyes . 
   we have one of the lowest ( if not the lowest ) eu fund absorption rates i 've heard romania takes so little money that this year it will become a net contributor to the eu budget ( just like sweden , denmark etc. ), 
  what germany really is saying they do n't want another sweden in the eu  ), 
  for a quick read , select a language and then click on its `` executive summary '' . 
  there 's also a [ comparison of languages ] ( http://www.meta-net.eu/whitepapers/key-results-and-cross-language-comparison ) page . 
  i never understood the russia thing . 
  all the other countries in europe fight bloody wars over some cities or tiny territories , while russia wins/loses a billion km ^ 2 in each war . 
  how is that even possible ? 
  conspiracy !, 
  quite creepy . 
  he literally stepped on the toes of the most powerful people in the country , and now they 're out to get him . 
  it was a `` czech problem '' but [ 8 people were poisoned in slovakia ] ( http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-09/17/c_131853967.htm ) and a few more in poland and hungary . 
  countries are not isolated from each other ... 
  that 's the thing with german highways that they do n't want you to know about  yes , there 's no speed limit , and yes , you do n't have to pay tolls or vignette , but if you look at how the 4 of us paid maybe 12 euros for toilet fees just to cross germany , it would actually be cheaper to buy a vignette and get free toilets  in hungary and slovenia you have to have a vignette , but the toilets are free . 
  yeah of course , there always has to be a minimum level of services that every person should have , in order to not violate their human rights . 
  i see now that we 're only disagreeing on where that level is . 
  i think people should be fed , clothed , educated and given basic healthcare , for free if they ca n't afford any of those things , while you would in addition want to give them some pocket money to buy a tv . 
  also , i would n't want them to be fed with quality food , or to wear quality clothes , i 'd want people to have to work for such things . 
  if they are disabled or elderly , then as i said before , it 's a different category , then they should get higher quality services because they ca n't help themselves . 
  uhhh i 'm not denying that croatia was the weaker side at the beginning of this conflict . 
  i do n't think anyone will deny this . 
  but you still had more than a few broken ak-47 and civilian trucks . 
  this is just the first link i found on google , you can probably find more if searching in local language : http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1743360/posts  october 4 , 1991 : a convoy of three truckloads of anti-tank weapons and 40,000 military uniforms arrived in the croatian capital , zagreb  late october 1991 : four mobile workshops , six 155mm howitzers , and a number of 120mm mortars , along with70 us-made general dynamics stinger advanced , manportable surface-to-air missiles ( sams ) , reached the port of zadar , from german sources . 
  and this is what your own minister said : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7fd-3jxteu&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=1097s also , it 's not fair to overestimate the strength of the serb army . 
  the jna was falling apart with everyone deserting it , and anti-war protesters , hungarians , yugoslavs , were forcibly conscripted and sent to vukovar . 
  you can guess how high their morale was . 
  this is why the paramilitaries were sent in eventually , since they did want to fight . 
   no , you do pay more , if you earn more . 
  10 % of 10 is 1 whereas 10 % of 20 is 2 . 
  you just have the same tax rate . 
  well yeah , i meant the rate . 
  if i pay 40 % while the other guy pays 10 % , then it 's not fair . 
   they might buy a big tv no , they ca n't buy a big tv , they 're poor . 
  if they could afford a big tv ( over 500 eur ? ), 
  then they would be middle class . 
  well i have n't been to the uk but they also want money in slovenia , thailand ... maybe other places that i ca n't remember now . 
  you 're missing the point here . 
  i 'm not saying the croats fired the first shot ( i believe they did but that 's not relevant ) , i 'm saying the croats were armed with more than just ak-47 as you claimed several posts above . 
   * barely * managed to get few ak-47 's lol , you should stop the self-pity ( which you earlier attributed to serbs ) , it 's similarly annoying . 
  what i hated the most was paying for toilet at gas stations on the highway , even if we purchased fuel . 
  each time it cost like 50 cents . 
  we were going from the netherlands to slovenia and we stopped every 2 hours , so it cost something like 6x0 ,5 = 3 euros per person !!, 
  you need to buy something first and the code to enter the toilet is printed on the bill and you can use it only once !!, 
  will this nuclear program also allow it to create nuclear weapons ? 
  i like this quote from the comments section :  can someone please explain to me how anyone can establish a company trading in food products with no checks , monitoring etc and then just disappear when the crap hits the fan . 
  no business registration documentation , no health and hygiene inspections , no details on the property lease agreement , no police records of vehicles registered to the company , what about info from insurance companies -- do n't tell me , they were not insured . 
  sorry i just do n't understand how this can happen . 
  something needs to be done , quickly , these cowboys could be the cause of a huge body count through their criminal actions and the chances are it will be the very young and very old who would die first . 
  first the poisonous alcohol and now this . 
  i think slovakia has some serious health safety problems . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  those 12 policemen were sent to borovo ** after ** the incident i linked to . 
  if you do n't understand what i 'm talking about , go to 19:07 , i 'm talking about this moment . 
  let me write it out in chronological order : 1 . 
  serbs in borovo are afraid the croats will `` kill them all '' so they set up barricades 2 . 
  croats fire rockets at those barricades 3 . 
  serbs invite volunteers to protect them from croats 4 . 
  croats send armed policemen to borovo 5 . 
  serbs kill armed policemen point # 2 is when a weapon was first shot in the war , it was 3 rockets fired by the croats . 
  what you quoted was point # 4 , it happenned only later . 
  and rockets ! = ak-47 . 
  where did those rockets come from if the croats were unarmed ? 
  according to you the croats were defending themselves , so why did they fire the first shot ? 
  here , from the article you linked yourself :  in an effort to defuse the situation , the area 's moderate police chief , josip reihl-kir , agreed that the croatian police would not try to enter serb villages without the explicit permission of the local serb authorities ; in return , the serbs agreed to dismantle barricades . 
  [ 9 ] [ 10 ] however , as he later complained , his efforts were seriously undermined by the actions of croatian nationalists who stoked the tension . 
  one particularly notorious incident occurred at borovo selo in ** april 1991 ** . 
  several members of croatia 's ruling hdz party , possibly including gojko \u0160u\u0161ak , who later became croatia 's defence minister , fired three armbrust anti-tank rockets into the village . 
  the attack caused no casualties , but became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in relations between the two republics . 
  [ here 's the poor croats defending themselves with broken ak-47s :\\ ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=4nfmiczasac#t=1104s ) . 
  please watch for at least 1 minute to get the whole story . 
  this was before the fighting began , in fact this is the first time that a weapon was used . 
  watch for 5 minutes to see the first moments of the war in croatia ... 
  i 'm talking about personal experience , of course i 'm maybe wrong . 
  i can speak serbian and slovenian , and have been to the czech republic ~ 5 times and also talked with czechs and slovaks in many different occasions . 
  slovaks also live in serbia and a friend of mine told me a few things . 
  so whenever people ask me where i 'm from , i say serbia since this is true , and i really do n't like explaining history . 
  in perhaps 70 % situation i got a friendly response ( the other 30 % were neutral ) , and by this i mean they told me `` hello my slavic brother '' , `` kosovo is serbia '' and `` hooray we 're all slavs here '' . 
  of course , in these situations i did n't want to confuse them and explain myself . 
  my family name sounds slavic so i can give that if they ask my name . 
  once while hitchhiking i had a really ridiculous situation with a slovak truck driver telling me how it would be great if serbs and slovaks bordered each other , and it 's too bad there are those pesky hungarians in between .
