  now really , i never heard any such talk from serbs . 
  they do n't care so much about panslavism . 
  now again , i only have a personal opinion and no scientific proof , but by looking at some of the ( 19th century ) stuff kids read in czech-slovak schools , it 's not hard to understand why they feel they are connected to other slavs more than to other nations ( when really , they culturally have more in common with hungarians and germans than with serbs ) . 
  in comparison to this , serb schoolbooks mainly feature russia as the friendly ally , there 's no such thing as `` slavic brotherhood '' . 
  maybe read a book by [ ludovit stur ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u013dudov\u00edt_\u0160t\u00far ) , the guy who invented the modern slovak language ? 
  his books are required reading in elementary school . 
  panslavism is at the core of czech ( and slovak ) nationalism . 
  it 's too bad they do n't realize the serb nationalists do n't really care about them as much and are n't really panslavists but pro-russians . 
  as someone who was unemployed for 8 months and living off his savings , yes , i would indeed enjoy not having to work . 
  i could spend my time on the beach , traveling , partying , playing games all day etc. 
  i used to think that when this period of unemployment starts ( it was planned ) that i 'll be bored pretty soon , but it never happenned . 
  you should try it sometimes  one of the reasons why i moved to hungary was its flat tax . 
  here i pay as much tax as everyone else , and still the system works . 
  as someone who earns above average , i get to keep more money than someone who earns below average . 
  and i think this is fair , since i worked hard to get to where i am . 
  let me write this in bold , ** i worked hard , i 'm not earning more because i 'm `` above average '' by birth , my skills had to be developed through hard work ** . 
  the extra money i earn will be put to good use . 
  there was , i think , a video just a few weeks ago , which explained that it is the middle class which creates the most jobs , contributes the most to the economy , and not the upper or the lower classes . 
  if you tax me to give money to the poor , that money will be less useful than had it stayed with me . 
  they will probably spend it on food , which is already subsidised ( meaning if you spend more on food , more money will be spent by the society ) . 
  i will spend it on a new washing machine . 
  the washing machine industry , which is n't subsidised , will keep on runing , new jobs may be created etc. 
  btw . 
  please do n't turn this around saying that the poor should starve because of my washing machine , no they should not , of course they should have money for food . 
  but let 's say , instead of eating meat every other day , they would afford to buy it only once a week . 
  and if they want a better quality of life , they should work for it and teach their kids valuable lessons , like do n't expect money to fall from the sky . 
  also , the sick and elderly are a completely separate category , they should of course get help just as they do now . 
  the whole society should contribute to their well-being . 
  your childhood must 've sucked :p, 
  this seems to be a common thing . 
  my grandfather-in-law is building a family tree and collecting artifacts from all our relatives . 
  so far the results are depressing , it seems everyone in our family has been a serf since forever ( except one guy from 300 years ago who * might 've * been a low ranking officer ) , 
  did n't you have a commodore 64 or atari ? 
  um , we had a private telephone & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; not the sssr but still ... we were n't rich or members of the party . 
  also all our friends had phones . 
  and in the late 80 ` es you did n't have the internets but had to call other people on the phone and join their bbs network . 
  maybe he was a bully and while in school he beat up this poor sivak guy and stole his emo notebook , 
  just a question , did he write this when he was a child ? 
  there are many of these small grammar errors that look like stuff kids make in early elementary school . 
  i 'm not trying to make fun of course , it 's cool that he knew how to write at a time when most people were illiterate , 
  that 's a really cool writing style . 
  i wonder how difficult it is to learn it . 
  and that was n't thanks to the eu , but thanks to technological improvements . 
  if we had the political realities now with 1980s technology , things would cost the same . 
   yeah , telephone ( mobile or land ) , internet and even good old letter services are out of the reach of said folk . 
  these things were n't available during the iron curtain ? 
   that 's true for any localities bordering/straddling not really , many eu mobile phone companies have very low prices for other eu countries . 
  as soon as you leave the eu it becomes more expensive . 
  what worries me is that i have 10 + years of experience as a project manager , and my salary makes me one of those rich people . 
  why should i pay more taxes just because i 'm so good at what i do ? 
  should i perhaps suck , get a low paycheck and enjoy it ? 
  and these ** hundreds ** of thousands come from ... ? 
   how is it any more difficult than on any other national border between countries that do not have some form of agreement ? 
  before hungary joined the schengen area , i could travel there from serbia visa-free . 
  later as they prepared to join they introduced hu visas , and finally they introduced schengen visas . 
  so let 's see . 
  before , i needed : a passport . 
  after , i needed : passport , birth certificate , citizenship certificate , bank account statement from last 3 month and the amount must exceed 1000 eur , proof of permanent employment or if there 's no such thing then other guarantees , such as house mortgage , or proof that you study ( last year on uni means you get rejected for the visa ) . 
  what else ? 
  right , sometimes they want an autobiography , written either in english or the local language , sometimes a police certificate that you have n't committed a crime ... 
  some of these papers usually have to have an international stamp called an apostille ( 1 apostille = 20 eur ) , they need to be translated , a photocopy must be made ... 
  so yes , it is several orders of magnitude more difficult to get a schengen visa than to just pass a national border . 
  we are talking about two countries here that used to have very easy travel , ** and because of the schengen treaty ** , things got worse . 
  there 's more . 
  trade virtually died out . 
  the south of hungary used to have these huge shoping areas that people from serbia visited , they mostly died out in the period between 2005-2010 . 
  now there 's some recovery as the region is adjusting itself to the new reality , and since 2010 visa requirements were lifted for serbia . 
  in case of belorussia , however , no such thing happenned . 
   most employed people would receive as much back as they put in , or more ok so i earn 1200 eur/month and i give 200 eur to this fund , and according to you i would get back 200 + eur . 
  so the fund received 0 - euros . 
  where does the money for the unemployed come from ? 
  the solution that the eu was proposing so far was for the serbian border guards to limit the freedom of movement for its own citizens . 
  basically the serbian border guard had to ask for guarantees that the citizen would return to the country . 
  this is against the constitution , because citizens ca n't be prevented from leaving their own country ( unless they 're criminals , of course ) . 
  in my opinion , the eu should be doing this instead , because in that case they would n't be violating human rights , they would just deny access to suspicious people . 
  the eu also seems to ignore how easy it is to bribe hungarian border guards . 
  it 's well known and almost a habbit that , when passing the border , the bus driver would collect 5-10 eur from each passenger and hand over that money to the border guard . 
  you can see this with your own eyes if you sit on a bus from belgrade to vienna , or you can find out by reading any random serbian forum . 
  also , the eu should take lessons how canada solved its problem with czech ( and hungarian ) gypsies . 
  http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1270708--roma-in-hungary-feel-persecuted-but-they-have-nowhere-to-turn  ministry has been working on a so-called safe list - which would include hungary and other nations that have n't historically produced large numbers of refugees . 
   would-be refugees from those countries would have only 15 days to file a personal information form outlining their claim instead of the current 30 days . 
  and they would have to prepare for a hearing in 30 days , instead of the several months they now have . 
  and i think there 's also something like , if you get rejected , you ca n't apply anymore . 
  right now in the eu , these people get deported , they leave the airplane and sit on a bus going back to the eu . 
  the main point remains . 
  people living on one side of the iron curtain had a really hard time traveling to the other side , or communicating with people there . 
  people living on one side ( the non-eu side ) of the schengen treaty have a really hard time traveling to the other ( eu ) side , or communicating with people there . 
  i think i 've read in another article that if someone from this village wants to call someone on the other side , he would have to pay international tariffs . 
  yes , it 's more humane , people do n't get shot anymore , and the borders are demilitarized . 
  it still does n't matter , because people are not getting across . 
  this is a horrible idea . 
  where would money come from ? 
  those that actually work . 
  why should they work if their hard earned money goes to those that do n't ? 
  you should live in that tiny border village and then tell me what the difference is . 
  things were bad even before the schengen treaty moved to the new members . 
  i remember in 2005 when i ( from serbia ) wanted to travel to amsterdam for a week as a tourist . 
  first i went to belgrade to obtain the dutch visa . 
  the woman at the counter was extremely rude and basically treated us like dogs , but we did meet all the requirements ( i kid you not , i handed over 2 kg of papers ) and a week or two later we got our dutch/schengen visas , valid for one week . 
  the airport to fly to amsterdam was in budapest , of course , so we needed hungarian visas too .
