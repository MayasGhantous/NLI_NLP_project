  we went to subotica to the hungarian consulate . 
  they required fewer papers , but they did want a paper saying that i had ** permanent ** employment . 
  since i had a temporary contract ( on 12 months ) , this was not good enough . 
  i also happenned to be a student at the time , so we completely backtracked , i called my mom to fax the consulate my university papers , it was a complete mess , but eventually , in the last minute , we managed to get it fixed and so i got my transit visa for hungary . 
  this also cost a lot of money , time ( at least 3 days completely spent on running for papers , photocopies , translations , stamps ) , there was a lot of stress , all just so we could visit amsterdam for a week . 
  we did n't steal anything , we did n't violate our visa dates , did n't ask for asylum ... 
  roma and albanians from the south of serbia . 
  reintroducing visas to serbia would be entirely unfair imho . 
  traveling to other countries for a week or two each year is one of the few luxuries that liberal minded people can afford to do in that country . 
  the eu would basically lock them all up in a country completely surrounded by the eu , in effect isolating it from the rest of the world ( no , people there can not afford expensive plane tickets to `` jump over '' the eu , they could only fly with cheap airlines that only fly to eu countries ) . 
  also , cheap airline companies would lose a lot of money if they had to retreat from serbia . 
  i 'm willing to bet that this money is greater than that given to a few thousand fake asylum seekers . 
  and also , there was a similar case where the czech republic had its visa free travel revoked by canada because a lot of czech roma were seeking asylum in canada , well knowing that they wo n't get it , and were just exploiting the system . 
  the whole eu in this case threatened to impose visa restrictions on canada because of what it was doing to one of its members . 
  now , when the exact same thing that was done to canada is being done to the eu , it also wants to impose visas . 
  now that is hipocracy if i 've ever seen one right there !, 
  i 'm from 8th germany and i find that to be offensive !, 
   i randomly chose latvia first you steal their [ flag ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/graphics/flags/large/lg-lgflag.gif ) and now this !, 
  if you 're not against us , you 're with us !, 
  this is a highway from diyarbakir to van : http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/48231351.jpg east turkey is not at all poor . 
  it 's more conservative than eastern turkey , but by financial wealth they 're wealthier than bulgaria . 
  i 've been there 2 years ago , it looks very developed , not just the roads , but the shops , buildings , cars , are all clean and new . 
  they have better highways than spain . 
  that eu member country [ voted in referendum to not include the other half ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3656753.stm ) . 
  i 've no idea why greek cyprus was accepted at all when they so openly showed hatered towards their neighbors . 
  i seriously hope the cpj did n't use china 's or iran 's official numbers , 
  while i was in turkey 2 years ago i felt very free . 
  their news is very sensationalist , like it starts with a man shouting `` 10 people killed in road accident !!!! '', 
  and then there 's a woman screaming and another man talking very quickly etc. 
  i mentioned this to turks and they agreed and said this is why turks have high blood pressure , 
  i like this guy . 
  i think he should be the next eu commissioner . 
  the first candidate that i do n't have any bad feelings about . 
  wait a minute , this transaction tax was implemented by hungary first , and [ then it was criticised by the eu ] ( http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2012/07/10/hungarys-financial-transaction-tax-is-latest-snub-to-eu-and-imf/#axzz2a9e5xb8t ) . 
  now other countries are adopting it as well , and suddenly barroso is `` delighted '' ?? 
  ok , fine , but why is hungary not included in that list of 10 countries ? 
  also these guys : http://www.rave-cruitment.com/, 
  i do n't really understand what you 're saying . 
  if someone wants to work in amsterdam , he will search for jobs in amsterdam . 
  if i search for jobs in london , i do n't want to see jobs that are located in amsterdam . 
  if it 's remote work , and the person can be located anywhere in the world , then set the location to `` worldwide '' . 
  [ here 's an example ] ( http://www.jobpilot.hu/search.aspx?jt=&amp;cy=&amp;fn=&amp;image.x=18&amp;image.y=3 ) how it looks on a hungarian job site . 
  while most jobs are in budapest , there are also some that are located in fej\u00e9r county , or in norway etc. 
  anyway , i do n't really use job sites to look for work , but when i did , i usually searched for `` java '' or by similar keywords . 
  then i would get all the java jobs , and i would also see the location , and would pick those that i liked . 
  but i never got a job this way , so i started searching for company directories ( like all software companies in amsterdam area ) and applied directly . 
  it 's also good to use linkedin and join various groups . 
  there are like 20 + java groups where you can advertise . 
  i bet there 's also an `` amsterdam software developers '' group . 
  if you pay for a premium account , then you can search for candidates and ask them directly if they 're interested . 
  which country ? 
  a finnish guy once told me all finns wear a pocket knife . 
  looks like he was right , 
  interesting . 
  i never knew this !, 
  i always thought hungary was among the oldest nations , since couples usually have just one child . 
  looks like i was wrong : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/europe_population_over_65.png, 
  you have no idea about their banking system , or that of the eu , and somehow you assume that they are doing better because they do n't riot on the streets unlike the greeks . 
  did you know their average salaries went down 50 % since the crisis ? 
  that 's like you earn 3000 eur/month , and then the next month it 's 1500 . 
  far worse than in greece . 
  also , had you put your money in a greek bank , you would still have that money . 
  unlike those people that put their savings in icelandic banks . 
  please think before speaking nonsense about investing in their banks . 
  both start when someone mentions the word `` gipsy '' . 
  i do n't understand why is hungary spending 2,5 % of its gdp with 14 % of people in `` lost generation '' , while spain only spends 1,5 % with 21 % . 
  in this regard hungary spends the most money after greece and bulgaria . 
  actually in real life i 've met british people that introduced themselves as british , and added `` not too proud '' . 
  that was unusual , i never heard before that people are not proud of what they are . 
  of course , nationalism is retarded but it seems so natural in europe . 
   for example we have very car-centric cultures i do n't have a drivers license and do n't plan on having it . 
  trains , buses , plains , hitchhiking , car sharing , worked pretty well so far . 
   we stopped trusting in the welfare state since they pay so low not really , i think millions of old people trust in the welfare state . 
  the younger people may think that they 'll never reach pension age , but that 's different . 
  also , regarding healthcare you can pay for additional private health insurance and then you 're pretty much covered ( this is same as in the us ) . 
  problem is most people would rather lose an eye than give 20 eur/month . 
  i hope this happens in hungary soon . 
  stop the gipsy circlejerk already !, 
   since blah blah blah , i would go ahead , do it !, 
  do n't be brave only on the internets !, 
  put your life savings in an icelandic bank , i dare you . 
  hey , go and put your money in an icelandic bank if you 're so brave !, 
  is n't iceland one of those insignificant countries that will never have foreigners invest in their banking sector ever again ? 
  you mean there are no things like this in paris ?

  [ link to the article ] ( http://www.kyivpost.com/content/world/racist-graffiti-on-french-mosque-for-sixth-time.html?flavour=mobile ), 
  before the wars , yugoslavia had a policy of allowing criminals `` escape '' to foreign countries , so that they would n't have to deal with them . 
  arkan is one such famous example , and you can look up the biographies of many war criminals to find this common pattern . 
  the lowest scum of society returned to yugoslavia just before the wars started . 
  when the wars started , people from serbia were leaving for many reason , some because they did n't think they 'll have a future there anymore , some to avoid the draft ( however , since 1992 , the borders were closed for most males ) and some for economic reasons . 
  there are also millions of serbs living outside serbia , and many became refugees . 
  these are the sort of people that loved living where they lived and only left because they were forced to , and after moving to another country they do n't want to integrate and hate the society they found themselves in ( and so they became the most radical nationalists ) . 
  many could n't return even today , because , for example , their village does n't exist anymore or is taken over by a hostile nation . 
  deusdies is mostly right about what he says . 
  it does n't matter if someone is super-smart , he can still be emotional and hate other nations because they ruined his life or childhood . 
  [ slovenia also had a black mayor . 
  ] ( http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-26/world/slovenia.black.mayor_1_first-black-mayor-mayor-ends-new-mayor?_s=pm:world ), 
   in wwi , serbia lost 60 % of its male population most from disease and starvation , because the serbian army did n't give shit about its own soldiers . 
   the many serbians i 've encountered in london , are the most nationalistic people i 've ever met this is true . 
  i moved from serbia to slovenia and was amazed how nationalist some of the serbs are there ( not all , of course ) .
