  if hungary does n't pamper these two countries then there 's basically no other place to expand into . 
  germany already takes up 25 % of the exports but they 're mostly interested in cars and machinery . 
  the government now tries to open up arab markets and we 'll see what happens with that in the future , but it would be stupid to stop the growth of exports to the russian market . 
  -- so you know , if lithuania or poland want to shoot themselves in the foot because they have bad relations with russia they are welcome to do so . 
  also , western europeans may enjoy sitting far away from the zone of conflict . 
  but if a country like hungary decides that its economic interest is more significant than supporting one side in a conflict it does n't want to be a part of at all , then i think the decision should be respected . 
  hungary is actually acting similarly to other countries in the visegrad group ( [ slovakia ] ( http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/53413/10/fico_opposes_broad_economic_sanctions_against_russia.html ) and [ czech republic ] ( http://inthesenewtimes.com/2014/03/26/czech-republic-opposes-sanctions-against-russia/ ) are also opposed to sanctions ) . 
  i guess poland supports sanctions due to historical reasons . 
  it 's actually 7 % and since the exports to eu countries is/was falling due to the recession , hungary has to find other partners in the world to sell its goods to . 
  calling a country `` cowards '' just because it 's following its interests is offensive to say the least . 
  russia is a significant trading partner for hungary . 
  i know it 's easy for france , germany , uk or sweden to ask for sanctions since their trade with russia is only 1-4 % of total trading , but for most eastern european countries this is 7-20 % and would seriously hurt the economy . 
  rode the metro yesterday , some positive impressions : * it 's nice and shiny and the air also smells good * my home-to-work time is 10 minutes shorter and some negative ones : * the doors close too fast , in two occasions people almost got caught and had to force-open the door * the speakers are too loud ( obvious sign that they did n't test the cars with people inside ? ), 
  * it 's cool that the moving stairs are brand new and shiny , but when you transfer to a different line , you immediately notice how * old * the other line 's stairs are ( previously this did n't caught my eye since there was nothing to compare it to ) . 
  i understand it 's very expensive to replace the older lines cars and tracks , but they could 've at least done the stairs at the transfer stations . 
  you 're not looking at the counter-examples like hong kong and singapore , city state dictatorships . 
  then there 's also [ equatorial guinea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/equatorial_guinea ) which ties with north korea for having the worst human rights abuses . 
  the maldives , another city-state , just recently abolished slavery and is currently ruled by a dictator ... then there are `` baltic state class '' countries like georgia , azerbeijan , nicaragua , well i think i 've made my point . 
  state size does not influence the level of democracy i think . 
  yes i agree the likelyhood of going to school with a future president is more likely in a small country , but so what ? 
  we all went to school with someone famous , be that a singer , a sportsman , or a serial killer . 
  the us is a continent and europe is many countries . 
  if you want to view europe the same way as the us , look at the fact a dish washer at mcdonald 's in the uk earns more than a doctor in poland . 
  similarly , incomes are different in california and montana . 
  looks like 9 other people as well ( was n't me ) , 
  this is what i like to hear from you and this is what i used to hear on this forum . 
  unfortunately nowadays it 's less often . 
  good night , 
  you 're a known troll , i wo n't reply to you . 
  here 's a video though for your effort : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc1pprq-ccm, 
  for the sake of amusement i 'll reply to that the legitimate serb government was overthrown by a [ cia-sponsored coup ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otpor!#revelation_of_u.s._involvement ) , and the puppet government later dropped the charges against its american masters . 
  i do n't agree with the above statement since i also participated in that overthrow and never received any money , but that is what i would write for the sake of discussion . 
  but now it 's bedtime so the discussion is over ... 
   i do n't remember us ethnically cleansing iraqis and afghans ... but i do remember saddam ethnically cleansing kurds and the taliban doing some pretty fucked up shit in the 90s ... . let 's not talk about the monstrosities you did to the vietnamese ... let 's just keep it simple and legal . 
  war against serbia was not sanctioned by the un --  illegal illegal war = crime people who perpetrated crime = criminals criminals should answer to a court . 
  serbia sued nato but the case never got to court , and eventually it was dropped in exchange for $ $ $, 
  the last 4 posts were obviously trolls , or posted by demented people , of course no one would agree with them . 
   well then shut up if you ca n't think of anything that you think is constructive to say . 
  i think my comment was constructive enough . 
  i do n't mind it being -13 , if this is how a forum should work then so be it . 
  i mind however that the stupid comment that i replied to has more upvotes than downvotes . 
  this kind of situation is what makes me have a bad opinion of people here . 
  here 's another example : [ i posted the same comment twice with only a few minutes difference ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0xjz63m.jpg ) . 
  are you telling me i should take this forum seriously ? 
  btw . 
  to remark on your comment in that `` lol '' thread :  they sure as hell were n't hungarians either prove it . 
  i do n't say i think they were hungarians , in fact i think they were n't . 
  but you seem to be sure as hell , so you must have some concrete evidence . 
  if not then your comment was just a waste of everyone 's time ... 
   add to the discussion what is there to discuss ? 
  guy posts an unproved theory that 's even somewhat offensive , how am i supposed to react ? 
  how do you think people would react if i claimed in all seriousness that the aliens kidnapped elvis ? 
   how do you know who downvoted you ? 
  you remember me , i do n't remember you . 
  i 'm assuming you remember me by something , and from your comment i guess that something is n't in your opinion positive . 
   one guy and those other two ( ukr and us ) in that same branch . 
  and the fact that this thread is burried down to the second page in / r/europe despite it being pretty significant news . 
   stop acting like you 're better than the rest of us . 
  i 'm not saying i 'm better than you guys , only that you guys are worse than the average humanity . 
  unfortunatelly this forum has downvoted most of the intelligent people `` out of existence '' , and they 've moved to other places . 
  btw . 
  i can see my comment i linked to is now at -13  ) ), 
  that 's amazing , thanks for the heads up , kind stranger !, 
  i have him tagged as well now . 
  maybe you 're confusing him with me ? 
  i have you at -28 so i guess we had some differences in opinions . 
  responsibility to pomb ? 
  one romanian guy boldly claimes romanians inhabited transylvania before the hungarians , [ i laugh at his stupid comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20npfh/romania_nominates_4_hungarian_extremists_bans/cg5i9qe ) , boom , -10 , and i even get remembered ( by your kind ) . 
  it works similarly for ukraine/russia , israel/palestine , etc. 
  the people here used to be smart and nice ( 2 years ago ) ... well not very nice , but at least it was n't a ukrainan circlejerk like now . 
  now i visit this place for the same reason people visit the zoo . 
  like that thread where people tried to [ justify the eu supporting ukraine despite its anti-gay laws ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/21ei93/eu_drops_required_protection_for_lgbti_people_for/cgcbq4j ) ... really , monkeys ca n't be this amusing . 
  dude , do n't take it personally and do n't appologize . 
  this forum is a fucking toilet of the internet , some of the worst morons come here and get upvoted . 
  just take any , and i mean any thread , about * israel/palestine - pro-israeli comments will be downvoted to hell * russia/ukraine - pro-russian comments will be downvoted * politics in general - conservatives will get downvoted i mean ** of course ** serb comments will be downvoted . 
  the people that post here were 10 years old when the kosovo bombing happened , they only remember the images on cnn/bbc ( if they remember at all ) , they do n't know anything at all about the war the way we do ( because we experienced it personally ) . 
  the majority on this forum saw the `` remove kebab '' video on youtube and think they know everything . 
  but ... but ... the peaceful/brave/sexy ukrainan revolutionaries would never hurt anyone , right ? 
  russia is teh evul !!, 
  it 's definitely easier to read it in slovak . 
  i think polish language is not so difficult after all , they only make it look like so with their spelling , 
  where 's that downvote button ? 
  oh there it is ... 
  it 's too bad that you 're mixing an otherwise quality report with your own liberal propaganda . 
  but i guess you 're a product of this forum . 
  there used to be other excellent hungarian commentators that were pro-fidesz and they got downvoted too many times so i do n't see them commenting anymore . 
   and sadly , people are buying this shit . 
  do you really , really think that a party can win 2/3 majority in the parliament because people are stupid ? 
  and you think you 're somehow above-average smart and can see the situation much clearer ? 
  to be clear , i hope they do n't win 2/3 majority this time . 
  there needs to be some checks and balances which do n't exist right now . 
  but they will definitely win by a majority , and this is not because people are stupid and easily influenced by propaganda , but because they can see what the situation is and will decide that fidesz is the better party in these elections . 
  what is it that the opposition parties propose ? 
  mszp - abolish the flat tax , meaning it will punish everyone earning above the average ; their leaders are the exact same that almost bankrupted hungary lmp - against the nuclear power plant expansion , they want hungary to be dependent on russian gas forever jobbik - nazis why do you think anyone would vote for any of these guys ? 
  i could be wrong but i think they pronounce \u00f3w as uf . 
  so it would be p\u00e4\u0165desiatgro\u0161ufka it means 50 grosh coin , right ? 
  those bridges were 500 km north of kosovo and the army that acted in kosovo was based in the south of serbia , not north . 
  it 's like bombing a bridge in frankfurt and saying it helps the war effort in stalingrad . 
  the child in me died, 
  yes , if turks were eating pork then it would be the same .
