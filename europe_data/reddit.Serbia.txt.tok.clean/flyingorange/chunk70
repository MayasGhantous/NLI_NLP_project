   okay you 're becoming quite nationalistic that 's a low punch , especially since i have n't said anything offensive about serbs . 
  i have my reasons why i care . 
  what is sns if it 's not an anti-eu party ? 
  or did you actually believe them when they said they changed ? 
   ) ) also , you should pay more attention to what kacin says , since it 's his job to tell you when you fuck up . 
  the other eu ministers that come and go can tell you nice things because they do n't bear responsibility , while kacin would probably lose his job if serbia became completely hostile to the eu . 
  one prison costs 500 million euros ? 
  do they make the bars from gold ? 
  i think you 're overestimating it by at least one zero , if not more . 
  ask the eu for help . 
  like i mentioned in a previous post , they donate around 1,4 billion euros , spend that 0,4 billions on prisons . 
  or sell telekom and instead of wasting the money on pensions and government salaries , spend it on prisons . 
  there is money to be found if you really want it . 
  i believe the new belgrade bridge cost some 400 million , right ? 
  that 's like 8 prisons !, 
  what do you mean he does n't have an education because his parents were n't wealthy ? 
  is n't education free in portugal ? 
  there 's a muslim minister of culture ? 
  is this like a muslim shadow government ? 
  the government . 
  do i have to draw this for you ? 
   the benefits of a pride parade are negligible in the following weeks you will get the reaction of the eu , and then tell me if it 's negligible . 
  here 's the first reaction : http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/content/kacin-srbija-ce-dobiti-sta-je-trazila/24728140.html you are aware that the eu is giving millions of euros as donation to serbia ? 
  for example , between 2000-2006 they gave 1,39 billion eur and between 2007-2013 they predict 1,4 billion . 
  that 's money you never have to give back , unlike the money you get from russia . 
  that same money is also more than the costs of this parade .

  http://www.emins.org/sr/aktivnosti/projekti/apsorpcioni-kapaciteti/100917_policy_paper.pdf ( page 7 ) http://serbianna.com/news/archives/3296 so you just keep on fucking with the eu and voting for anti-eu parties and then wonder why is your country going bankrupt . 
  you will have to turn to your old pals cuba , north korea and china for help ( unfortunately iraq and lybia are not available anymore ) , just like during milosevic , and i hope you 're old enough to remember how `` useful '' their help was . 
  i see , more prisons should be built , regardless of this gay pride issue . 
  when is the minister of interior going to start ? 
  there is no logic in it , because the government should show its power through the existing mechanisms of opression . 
  meaning , everyone that protests violently gets immediately arrested and the courts sentence them to a few decades in prison ( as an example ) . 
  what 's happening here is that the people in power do n't care about gay rights , so they make up dumb excuses . 
  and you 're agreeing with them . 
  because you have two groups , one is preaching love and tolerance , the other is a bunch of evil thugs that want to hurt or kill innocent people , and you need to pick which side you 're on . 
  your tax money would be put to good use . 
  it 's actually surprising to see how suddenly money is so important , why was there never such great concern about the money that gets lost in the many corrupt government agencies ? 
  i think you 're just looking for an excuse , because you know yourself that this is the wrong thing that happenned . 
  uhhh , you missed that whole us embassy burning thing from two weeks ago ? 
  according to your or metaleks ' comments they caused damage of hundreds of millions in 2010 . 
  so the cost of keeping them in prison is less than having them outside . 
  btw . 
  i was reading an article how the fascist obraz movement finally got banned . 
  that 's a good move , now they just need to ban the 1389 , nasi and dveri , and should they appear on the protest , bang , another 10 years on top of the 20 . 
  i know a lot of housewives speak spanish because of the spanish soap operas , 
  syria is already supplying the pkk with weapons , just look up how many pkk attacks there have been recently in turkey . 
  this belongs to / r/europe how ? 
  while i understand what you 're saying , you do n't want to propose a solution because you think there is no solution . 
  the march should be allowed . 
  the hooligans should be arrested ** and sentenced to 20 years in prison ** . 
  then next year there will be less people that want to beat up gay people . 
  unfortunately this will not happen because , as you said it , 80 % of serbia does n't like gay people . 
  the right thing to do in this situation is to just ** come out clean , bring a law that says homosexuality is illegal in serbia ** , and everyone will understood what 's going on . 
  especially now that your president says that serbia wo n't hurry into the eu , there 's really no reason why you could n't do this . 
  russia will probably even applaud the decision . 
   if no one cared , why would they continue to pursue it ? 
  etc etc. 
  look , the fact is , kosovo gained independence in 1999 , and gained legality for its independence after the icj decision . 
  case closed . 
  i know you could probably talk forever about this , bring up various links which would , in your opinion , prove that you 're right , but it wo n't change the fact on the ground that kosovo is independent and recognized as such by the international community . 
  since it 's independent , it has the right to decide whether it wants to give some territory to serbia or not . 
  so far the kosovo government does n't want this . 
   i 'm passionate about the land , and its people -- more specifically , the serbs but kosovo is 90 % albanian , so you ca n't say you 're passionate about kosovo . 
  maybe about northern kosovo ? 
  and let 's be more specific about this , how is it that you express this passion ? 
  for example , i 'm passionate about cooking , so i spend a significant amount of my monthly income on various spices and foodstuffs , i spend a lot of time learning about how to make food ... how much % of your monthly income do you give to kosovo serbs ? 
  do you spend your time on issues related to kosovo , for example by learning albanian so you could understand the other side ? 
  or do you just like to talk how you 're passionate and argue with strangers on the internet about it ? 
   there is now , more than ever , a growing sentiment that is anti-eu in serbia . 
  [ oh no , whatever will the world do now ... zzz ] ( http://www.blic.rs/strip/1284/marko-somborac )  and i , and a lot of other people are just fine with that . 
  a lot of people are n't , that 's why we left that hellhole of a country . 
  kosovo is just a story your elite uses to manipulate the masses while they fill their pockets . 
  it 's not even such a good story , you need to be especially blinded to not see it [ \\ ( another relevant cartoon \\ ) ] ( http://www.blic.rs/strip/1496/marko-somborac ) . 
   milosevic has been dead for almost a decade when kosovo decided to split . 
  that 's not a valid reason anymore . 
  kosovo became independent in 1999 , they probably forgot to notify you . 
  this is the de-facto case on the ground ever since . 
  all that followed afterwards was a silly game of paperwork , bureocracy and shit no one in the world cared about . 
  and eventually that game ended , again , with serbia 's defeat , when the icj declared that kosovo 's declaration of independence was indeed legal . 
  btw . 
  serbs are not a homogenous entity , just because you 're passionate about kosovo ( the territory , not its people ) does n't mean everyone else is . 
  as the '99 war has shown , serbs would rather have peace than die for kosovo . 
  as the elections in 2008 have shown , serbs would rather have a normal life than risk isolation from the international community because of kosovo . 
  i do n't know what makes you think that `` every man in serbia would rise up '' if kosovo joined albania . 
  based on past experiences , in my opinion , if such a thing happens , the only consequence would be some street riots in belgrade , perhaps an embassy or two would be burned , that 's it . 
  in eastern europe there are `` almost '' no black people , there are more asians though ( chinese , vietnamese ) and i like to think they are tolerated . 
  of course there are random graffiti against them but i do n't think i 've ever seen people shouting at asians ( or perhaps i subconsciously forgot about such cases ) . 
  the hungarian word for a black person is `` n\u00e9ger '' , which is not at all a racist word , unlike in english . 
  i 'm guessing it has n't become a racist word because there never were enough people to be offended by it . 
  on the other hand my wife was waiting for the bus just the other week and some black french guy ( he had a french accent ) asked some kids for directions and they started offending him like `` go back to africa '' etc. 
  which is really embarassing . 
  i like to think that the huge majority of people are n't racist though , at least i never think in racial terms . 
  who 's ron swanson ? 
  no i wo n't search the internet , i 'll allow the information to come to me b ), 
  not really , kosovo gained the right to independence because of the cruel way the serbs treated its inhabitants . 
  the kosovo serbs are not being murdered by the kosovo government , so they do n't get to separate . 
  separate the north region , and let it reunite back with the country it belongs with . 
  the majority of kosovo does n't want that , so no . 
  what about the stars ?
