  the religion , attitudes , values , goals , institutions and practices of the romanians are more similar to the slavs , greeks , albanians that live on the balkans than , for example , the french , germans or japanese . 
  as such the cultural ancestors of the romanians were all those people that lived on the balkans in the past 2000 years . 
  you did n't understand the sentence correctly . 
  it says the thracians were the primary ancestors of the romanians . 
  the sentence can be rephrased as : `` along with slavs , [ the thracians are ] a primary ancestor of the modern romanians '' if it wanted to say that the slavs are the primary ancestors , then the sentence would 've been : `` along with slavs , ** the ** primary ancestor ** s ** of the modern romanians '', 
  as usual , the hungarian borders are not shown correctly in so many cases . 
  it was also funny to read how the ottomans conquered hungary in 1521 , shows how the author ( s ) did n't give a shit about checking the dates for this region . 
  i used to watch ** foliranti ** when i was a kid , the problem is they speak in serbian so you ca n't understand the joke . 
  here 's a funny sketch without text : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmpq4mm4hle however i think you 'd still need an explanation of the context why is it funny , and explanation ruins the joke ... ** top lista nadrealista ** were like the yugoslavian monty pythons . 
  again , you ca n't understand most of the jokes , but i think you will understand this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfjhdquvuse, 
  wait a minute , did he put an ** ox tail ** in that soup ? 
  they also eat a shitton of salads in georgia which is on the other side of the black sea , so it 's probably related to the weather or i dunno . 
  i do n't know if you in bulgaria have what we in serbia call djuve\u010d , it 's a thick mass of tomatos , paprika and rice , and you eat it with some meat . 
  it looks [ like this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:djuvec.jpg ) . 
  anyway , yesterday i thought about having an `` african day '' and found some recipes . 
  [ this ] ( http://allrecipes.com/recipe/african-peanut-soup/detail.aspx ) is apparently a soup they eat in kenya . 
  so i started making the soup by the recipe as it says on that site , and when i was done with it , i realized it tastes exactly the same as a djuve\u010d , except instead of meat it has peanut butter ( so it tastes like shit ) . 
  i 've no idea what genius called this a soup when it 's not liquidy at all , it 's more like a thick \u010dorba . 
  anyway it 's interesting that even in kenya they eat the exact same food as we do here , but they consider it theirs and call it not only by a different name but they also call it a soup when it 's actually a main meal . 
  good user name  ) ), 
  i do n't think the cuisines were that homogeneous to begin with , for example what most people call italian food can also be found in the neighboring countries ( slovenia , croatia , austria , maybe switzerland ) , and you ca n't say that those people are eating italian food because they consider their food to be theirs . 
  maybe if you go further away to scandinavia or the us , then the food becomes more `` focused '' on italy . 
  i do n't know why , maybe italians are better at marketing their food as distinctly theirs . 
  similarly for hungarian food , `` everyone '' in the world knows that goulash is hungarian , but if you go to one of the neighboring countries then you discover that they also eat the same thing , but sometimes under a different name . 
  i 've cooked to some french people a traditional fish paprikash with a fish from the tisza river , and they loved it , but said that it tastes the same as some xy food from france . 
  so i do n't think you can really claim that any food is unique to a region . 
  if sicilians eat sea food because they live next to the sea , then so do the mexicans that live near the gulf of mexico . 
  yet mexican food is more associated with spice and corn . 
  if they have insurance they 'll get their money back . 
  if not : ha ha !, 
  and ryanair immediately [ announces ] ( http://www.ryanair.com/en/news/ryanair-to-open-budapest-base-in-two-weeks-with-31-new-routes ) an establishment of a base in budapest and 31 new lines from it !, 
  also wizzair establishes new lines and opens 700 new jobs . 
  looks like the struggle now is which company will get the best people who 've worked at malev . 
  wizzair can do the job instead of malev , and without government subsidies . 
  as far as i know the eu court case started when wizzair sued the government for subsidising malev and creating unfair competition . 
  it says there will be a protest in ljubljana on 4.2 but there is no link to any event page . 
  anyone knows more about this event ? 
  edit : got it !, 
  it 's not just religion , they also need to do something about their nationalistic attitude which basically divides nations into people we 've conquered and people we almost managed to conquer . 
  they 're awfully proud of their achievements such as keeping the people of the balkans 500 years under slavery , reducing hungary 's population by half , destroying greek communities that were thousands of years old etc. 
  it 's similar to a spaniard bragging to an indian about how great cortez and the centuries of slavery were . 
  i do n't think the european nations that were conquered by the ottomans are ready to forgive without the turks changing their attitude . 
  you can kind of expect that it 'll be some post about the evils of the eu if the poster has a british flag . 
  i guess it makes sense for finns to write to finnish meps , italians to write to italian meps . 
  for example , if a finnish mep receives an email written in finnish language , then he/she can assume that it was written by a citizen of finland , since there are n't that many people outside the country who speak the language . 
  i guess it becomes complicated when you come from a more popular language . 
  you should reply to her with this : 12 , 13 or 14 june : final ratification vote by eu plenary, 
  today i 've sent emails to 26 hungarian-speaking meps ( from hungary , slovakia and romania ) , so far i received one reply saying my concern will be taken into account . 
  i personalized each email by writing their names in the email , and addressing the older people with `` respected '' and younger people with `` dear '' . 
  that 's a great text , thanks !, 
  i made a text that 's somewhat similar to yours and now i 'll send it to all hungarian meps i can find . 
  i 've sent one email so far , did n't receive a reply . 
  could some of you that did receive a reply post here what you wrote ? 
  i felt my email sounded too amateurish so maybe that 's why i did n't get a reply . 
  i like that part where they describe hungary as a country much more evil than germany . 
  interesting to see that denmark gives the most money per person and belgium received the most . 
  thanks for the link !, 
  looks like these two : [ first ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/28150/kinga_g\u00c1l.html ) and [ second ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/23813/zolt\u00e1n_bag\u00d3.html ) , might be the right persons . 
  one has something to do with civil liberties and the other is a substitute for `` petitions '' , so i guess i could send a petition to him . 
  stop spreading lies , mr tulip . 
   which it uses to systematically limit basic rights , like freedom of the press . 
  this has prompted the european commission to initiate three proceedings the three proceedings have nothing to do with the freedom of the press . 
  this article by spiegel is pure socialist propaganda . 
  horses still pollute the air with methane gas, 
  why do you hate the environment so much ? 
  everyone is happy including the losers , what kind of election is this ? 
  where 's the blood ? 
  in almost every single point . 
  search this subreddit for his previous articles which have been disproved , it just does n't make sense to keep disproving every single time if people keep posting his shit on and on . 
  not him again , this idiot with `` the conscience of a liberal '' became boring when he started spewing his ( actually , her ) lies months ago , now she 's just rehashing the same old stuff . 
  actually most world travelers i 've met were working in it so i think there 's something in the mentality that makes these people travel . 
  perhaps it 's the stress , or the thought that there must be life outside the cubicle ? 
  the prices in europe vary dramatically . 
  what costs 5 euros in france may cost 8 euros in denmark , and 50 cents in hungary . 
  most people say that in western europe you need 50 eur/day for a reasonably comfortable travel . 
  in eastern europe this goes down to 30 eur/day . 
  myself i 've been using couchsurfing , have n't been going to restaurants , tried to hitchhike as much as possible , and spent around 20 eur/day in western europe and about the same in the east . 
  but this is not what most people would call comfortable travel . 
  i just want you to know that this is possible . 
  the schengen area covers most of europe and you can travel within this area on the same visa . 
  the visa is valid for 90 days , after it expires you must leave the area and not come back for another 90 days . 
  this is a simple explanation , it becomes more complicated if you enter and exit the area frequently , then you should actually calculate your days , but i 'm not going to go into that . 
  the uk , ireland , romania , balkan countries are not part of the schengen treaty , but i do n't think you need visas to enter these countries . 
  you should check your state department website just to be sure . 
  many countries use the euro for currency , but not all of them . 
  the uk , denmark , sweden and most of eastern europe do n't . 
  there are atms everywhere so getting the local currency should n't be a problem , unless you end up in some village of 500 people that does n't have an atm . 
  note that if you travel by train , it can actually happen that you must change trains in a small village . 
  try to avoid using taxis as much as possible . 
  in western europe they 're outrageously expensive , in eastern europe they 're cheap , but they might try to scam you if they see you 're a tourist . 
  if you have an ics card then use it !, 
  most museums , churches and exhibitions can be entered for very cheap if you have an ics card . 
  regarding scams , europe is not exactly india , but you should still keep your guard up . 
  at train stations never lose sight of your luggage . 
  whenever someone comes to you wanting to help , without you asking for help , assume that he 's trying to scam you . 
  whenever you see some people playing some game on the street that involves money , assume that it 's a scam . 
  when exchanging money always use an atm , and if there really is n't one to be found then ask the bank clerk to write down on a piece of paper how much money you will get , * before * you give them your money . 
  if they refuse to do this then get out of there fast !, 
  if you get stopped on the street by a man asking if you want to have sex with beautiful girls assume that it 's a scam . 
  when someone offers to clean your shoes assume it 's a scam .
