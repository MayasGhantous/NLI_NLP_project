  oh and look out for pickpocketers on every large square with lots of tourists , such as the vatican , the louvre etc. 
  regarding languages , most of the `` germanic speaking '' countries will know english , and most of the `` romance speaking '' countries wo n't . 
  so it would be useful to learn the basics of , for example , spanish , and it will help you out in france , italy etc. 
  in eastern europe more people speak english but it 's not 100 % . 
  if you pick up some basic slavic it will help you a lot . 
   if you want to be a part of the european community , you have to abide by european values and rules . 
  who said that this is not the case ? 
  the government agreed to modify all laws that the eu commission has objected against with arguments . 
  so france and switzerland are the best places to be ? 
  ( i 'm not counting norway cause it 's freezing cold up there ) . 
  i think that this demonstration will soon be labeled by the leftist media as `` nationalist '' , `` anti-eu '' , `` evil '' etc. 
  so i 'd like to quote this from the article :  bayer stressed that they do not wish to appear together with the extreme right , and they will not burn any flags . 
  he added : i would like to dispel the misconception that no one supports the present government in hungary . 
  also note that a group of 500 roma minorities joined the demonstration , saying that the current policies are helping the integration of their community into the general society . 
  so this is not a group of raving anti-minority nationalists . 
  ok you want your voices to be heard , but what 's the issue ? 
  why are they protesting ? 
  because of the privatization of the medicare ? 
  that sounds really amazing . 
  i wish i had an mp to write to . 
  i wonder if something will actually come out of your mail . 
   the alphabet is phonetic \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  because your ancestors were cheap bastards and did n't want to pay for the extra letters in the printing press . 
  the same goes for the french . 
   there is a growing sentiment and racism in some parts of the hungarian population i disagree . 
  there always has been racism in some parts of the hungarian population , but i think that it has been declining in the last 50 or so years . 
  i do n't really have scientific proof for this other than general conversations with people . 
  the older generation is usually more racist than the younger generation . 
  the roma problem is a region-wide problem and i think hungary has been handling it better than its neighbors have . 
   the situation with the pkk is very similar to spains issue with eta there have been what , 40 thousand deaths since the war with the pkk started ? 
  compare that with less than 1000 deaths related to eta and you should understand why they 're not in the same league . 
  i know about the basque and catalonian demand for autonomy , but they are not even close to being opressed as much as the kurds . 
  go to urfa , batman , van or diyarbakir , and find me a multilingual street sing . 
  these are all cities with a majority kurd population !, 
   he is the synonym for stupidity . 
  so your aristocratic friends laugh at him while drinking champagne ? 
    why would `` knjiga '' be of a female gender ? 
  because it ends with an `` a '' ? 
  i think that , because of the media campaign against hungary in the past few weeks , hungary has became a country to poke your finger at when you want to talk about fascism , authoritarianism and the like , even despite the fact that most of this media campaign was basically founded on lies , and despite the promise of the prime minister this week to fix the issues that the eu has proven with arguments to be wrong . 
  note that the eu commission had no arguments about the laws concerning civil rights and media freedoms . 
  i will however indulge you and answer the links that you have posted . 
  i hope that you will appreciate this effort and stop your smear campaign against a country you 're not familiar with . 
  your first link claims that the hungaian government tolerates paramilitary organizations that are anti-roma . 
  i will quote from that same article :  the first move [ of the minister of interior ] was against the defense force . 
  they arrested eight members , including tam\u00e1s eszes , the head of the organization , shown being led away on the photo . 
  moreover , the government published an ordinance : from here on any person who appears in uniform will be fined 100,000 forints . 
  your second link is about the * only * major protest the orban government had since it came to power . 
  it seems to represent this one protest as if the majority of the people is dissatisfied , when in fact most of these people were sympathizers of the opposition socialist party . 
  note that there has n't been any such protests since , for the simple reason because the socialist party can not afford to bring all of its sympathizers out on the streets , and the population is not outraged enough to do it on their own . 
  compare this to the ows protests which are n't organized by any of the major parties of the us . 
  about your third article , unfortunately i do n't speak german , but from what i can understand from google translate , this is a journalist complaining about the `` long arms '' of the ruling party . 
  ironically this guy works for the state radio , and he 's being allowed to write these kind of stuff by the same `` oppressive '' party without getting fired . 
  in any case , if he feels he 's being oppressed , then that 's his personal opinion and it does n't prove anything regarding the general state of affairs in the country . 
  your last link is by the same guy that made that factual error about the roma people . 
  in his first sentence he reveals himself to be a supporter of the socialists and the former prime minister . 
  if you then look at his other articles you 'll see that he attacks everything that is `` right '' ( as opposed to the political left ) , so by this time i 'm not sure if i should continue reading what is obviously a political propaganda , but anyways ... 
  it 's an article restating old news , that the eu commission is n't happy about a few issues ( that orban has since promised to amend ) . 
  and then i got to this part  up to now viktor orb\u00e1n has n't tried to organize a pro-government demonstration because apparently the administration fears that the crowd might not be as big as they would like . 
  c'mon , you really expect me to take this kind of garbage as argument ? 
  -- right , so it seems to be you 've been misled by some leftist bloggers and a protest that happened a few weeks ago . 
  contrary to this , turkey does actually have a miniature insurgency in kurdistan ( and it 's prohibited to name that area with that name ) , the kurds can not go to schools in their own language etc. 
  i 'm not familiar with the turkish media freedom but it looked fairly free when i was in turkey . 
  * izmir is so secular it puts the czech republic to shame * the holy city of urfa is mini-iran ( and is filled with iranian tourists ) so it 's a country with huge contrasts , i do n't think there 's anything similar in the eu . 
  wtf ? 
  what kind of problems with freedom of expression and minorities hungary has that are worse than turkey 's ? 
  that was a great explanation , thanks . 
  i always thought pinyin was supposed to be a spelling out of chinese words , but if it 's not then i guess it makes sense . 
   and remember , `` e '' is distinct from `` en '' that 's what i 'm saying !, 
  if e is pronounced as e ( like german e ) , then en should be pronounce as e-n and not some other way . 
  i found these examples to prove my point . 
  you can listen to how they 're pronounced [ on this website ] ( http://www.chinese-tools.com/learn/chinese/01-phonetics-hello.html ) . 
  n\u01d0 h\u01ceo - nyi ha z\u00e0i ji\u00e0n - cay jy-en why is * n * pronounced as * ny * when it 's followed by * i * ? 
  why is * a * pronounced as * e * in `` ji\u00e0n '' ? 
  this is why i 'm saying they should 've taken some other system . 
  if they pronounce * n * as * ny * then they should 've used the spanish \u00f1 character and everyone would understand what 's going on . 
  if they pronounce `` an '' as `` en '' then they should write it as `` en '' , not as `` an '' . 
   this is bullcrap . 
  average serbs use all the cases all the time ummm ... no ? 
  maybe you hang out with highly educated people only but an average person does not use all the cases . 
  i can even remember a [ quote ] ( http://starisajt.nspm.rs/prenetitekstovi/2005_evropa_karic_feb.htm ) from the talk between dinki\u0107 and bogoljub kari\u0107 , where kari\u0107 said that `` maybe he uses only 5 articles and not all of them like mr.dinki\u0107 , but ... '' . 
  the examples you 've given above can be expressed with other words , for example i do n't remember when i 've heard someone say `` idem iz prodavnice '' . 
  when put into context it can be said as `` bio sam u prodavnici '' ( the answer to the question `` where are you ? '' ), 
  which is lokativ . 
  of course you can pass elementary school by learning all the cases , but that does n't mean you 'll use all of them in real life ( just like how i learned the names of all the stations of the beograd-bar train line , but never needed that information in my life ) . 
   yes , but you do n't have to memorize a trillion other words and their genders . 
  when i was learning german , german is different because the gender of the word is not obvious , but in serbian/slavic you can usually determine it from the ending letter . 
  it 's very logical and there 's no need to memorize anything . 
   what specific coffee ? 
  there 's no such thing as a specific coffee . 
  yes there is . 
  there 's * the * coffee that we 're talking about and there 's coffee which exists in nature . 
  in serbian you have to use a word to make up for the lack of the article . 
  like in your example , you specified that you drank either nescafe or `` this '' specific coffee . 
  you can not express the meaning of the sentence without adding these `` fake articles '' . 
  i speak serbian and english as non-native languages , so maybe you 'd be interested in my opinion . 
  i 'm not arguing for or against englsh or serbian , for me they 're both of the same difficulty . 
   they seldom use cases but an average serbian also uses like 3-4 cases most of the time , the rest is for literaly works . 
  also , english has a lot of grammatical stuff that you can only read about in `` higher literature '' and not on tv , so maybe you do n't know that these things exist . 
  for example ulysses from james joyce , according to wikipedia it uses 30.030 different words . 
   the nonexistence of gender but then you have to memorize that words like ship and country are feminine .
