  except that they do n't ... 
  it 's the best food in the world, 
  is this a restaurant for millionaires ? 
   nope , it was n't top priority , no clue where did you find that information . 
  they brought the law 1 day after removing yanukovich from power . 
  do you see the `` occupied '' people protesting against the `` occupation '' ? 
  where did they find this idiot moderator ? 
  `` despite his accent , he 's the president of estonia '' ? 
  you were n't born and raised in europe so your mentality is as foreign as that of a vietnamese national . 
  instead of meddling in our affairs you should look into going back to your country , founded on genocide by convicts . 
  you 're not one of us , jeff , and you never will be , no matter how long you claim you 've been in europe . 
  and quoting an american source does n't prove shit in this case . 
  exactly , too bad we ca n't have a un resolution condemning israel , because the us will veto it . 
  i agree with you , the eu should do more to stop israel violating human rights . 
  the palestinians are the victims in this conflict . 
  those assholes should be court marshalled !, 
  i just hate injustice and hope an independent palestine will be a reality soon . 
  i actually agree with you , we should impose sanctions on israel and their friends in washington . 
  the eu and japan built that airport for the peaceful palestinians and the israelis bombed it to the ground . 
  i think that 's enough proof . 
  i hope israel returns the territory it stole from the palestinians and then repays all the damage it has done . 
  it happened due to israeli provocations and the oppression of the palestinian people . 
  am i right ? 
  thanks for that article , to sum it up : israel attacked palestinian civilian infrastructure for no reason at all . 
  that 's the israeli logic for you ... some people just do n't make sense . 
  i agree , the eu should do something to stop israel violating human rights . 
  i do n't understand why is the world tolerating this !, 
  we should impose sanctions on israel and recognize an independent palestine asap !, 
  i wonder how will this reflect on the russians living in the baltic states . 
  afaik they were also stripped of their citizenship since they did n't take the language test ... 
  this is a bad idea , somebody might send offensive postcards or pictures of penises . 
  no , i 'm angry because relevant news is getting downvoted in this forum , which means it 's not the best medium to follow the news . 
  one attraction of reddit is that you can get news faster than any other website . 
  if my posts are getting downvoted this way , then it 's happening to others as well . 
  [ meta ] [ i posted this same news a day ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20tzvm/ukrainan_mps_assault_and_physically_force_the/ ) and it got downvoted into invisibility . 
  it 's disgusting what this forum has turned into . 
  it 's a sad day when even slovenians recognize the illegal annexation of trst :(, 
  you 're the reason i pay for my internet subscription . 
  and just recently they had a statue to the albanian fighters removed by the serb state , while at the same time a statue to the serb fighters is being built elsewhere . 
  i do n't think they are completely free even today ... 
  where 's our resident expect jeff to tell you you 're a retard for even thinking of comparing kosovo to crimea ? 
  the truth is out ? 
  when has it been not out ? 
  they 've been telling this same shit back in the roman republic , with the added benefit that back then you could get killed for speaking too much bullshit . 
   was first inhabited by romanians lol, 
  your general attitude and your post history shows it, 
  you seem to have a really sad obsession disparaging russia , too bad you know so little about the region . 
  [ wikipedia disagrees with you ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia#economy ) :  despite higher energy prices , oil and gas only contribute to 5.7 % of russia 's gdp, 
  because they have been falling for several weeks now and traders thought the stocks became cheap enough to jump in, 
  pravda.ua is probably a very reliable source / s, 
  that would make sense in some cases , but not when this same video has been reposted a shittonne of times http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/e5xo6/1000_years_of_european_history/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/e6zpj/1000_years_of_europe_in_5_minutes/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/liyus/time_lapse_of_europe_10_centuries_in_5_minutes/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/tobaj/timelapse_map_of_europe_from_1000ad_to_2005_ad/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/bpr3f/repost_from_rhistory_video_of_european_borders/ http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/bpr3f/repost_from_rhistory_video_of_european_borders/ this video has been reposted on this forum for 3 years on and on ... 
  no i 'm replying to you in the same manner you did to me , except without all the asslicking wording . 
  is this the youtube video when the national borders and country colors change as time goes by ? 
  it 's been posted on this forum at least 693921760003356331 times, 
  and then you have people on this forum defending the freedom party and saying how it 's not at all like golden dawn and jobbik, 
   however considering possible `` iranian '' sanctions against russia ( prohibition of `` luxury '' export into the country - including cars ) i wonder how will this affect serbia 's economy . 
  i think exporting cars to russia is one of the big parts of the gdp , and it comes from the fiat factory . 
  although serbia is not part of the eu , fiat is an italian company , so who knows ... 
  well i expected a more interesting presentation :(, 
  nice but useless , unfortunately . 
  the epp is the largest party in the eu parliament while here it came out 4th , so based on that these results can not be used for any useful extrapolation . 
  yes i think it 's probably the rural areas . 
  in budapest it 's suicide to drive a bicycle . 
  that 's the point . 
  i was replying to suicidemachine 's comment about how the nato war games are justified because poland is afraid russia will attack . 
  when in fact there 's 0 chance that 's going to happen . 
   which is worse than someone close to an ex-kgb spy close to a neighbouring militaristic , authoritarian country how ? 
  the kgb spy was elected , the nazi thug got his chair through violence . 
  that 's basically my answer to the rest of your comments . 
  these people are * worse * than the old government in that the old guys won the elections fair and square , the new guys only manage to come to power through force . 
  and btw . 
  these `` new '' guys previously came to power through the orange revolution , another violent affair . 
  they never managed to win democratically . 
  which sets the question , if these guys lose the elections again in 2018 , and a yanukovich-party guy comes back to power , then will there be another `` revolution '' in 2022 ? 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budapest_memorandum_on_security_assurances  the memorandum was originally signed by three nuclear-powers , the russian federation , the united states of america , and the united kingdom . 
  china and france later gave individual statements of assurance as well these are the states which should matter in this case, 
  can swiss citizens come and work in the eu without being restricted by any quotas ? 
   the only one who was placed in power by an angry mob read this article please , it 's fascinating . 
  tells you just who exactly got the power : http://www.novinite.com/articles/158543/kyiv+post%3a+the+not-so-revolutionary+new+ukraine+government  his appointment is frowned upon as it 's considered one of the `` rewards '' to maidan activists . 
   one of his legal initiatives was an attempt to ban all abortions , even for pregnancies that occurred during rape  she financed restoration of radomysl , a small castle in zhytomyr oblast , but had been accused of illegally taking over it . 
   he is disliked by many local diplomats for his arrogance . 
   was under criminal investigation  formerly an investigative journalist , she ran for parliament in 2012 and lost . 
  and lots more ... edit : i 'm getting downvoted for providing a source to an opposing view ? 
  the elections will be in may , until then we have a nazi simpathiser running the justice ministry and the greatest oponents to yanukovich in charge of the whole government . 
  in a corrupted country like ukraine do you think these people will leave any chance of them not winning the elections ? 
  do you think criminals like yulia timoshenko will want to get back to prison , or will they fight tooth and nail to not return there ? 
  elections were agreed between yanukovich and the protesters . 
  it was all going fine . 
  then the violent mob took over and overthrew the government . 
  everything they 've done after that is illegal . 
  i hate lazy trolls like you . 
  you 're interested in facts but you ca n't visit the fucking websites yourself ? 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26546083 read the first paragraph . 
  do you trust the bbc ? 
  here 's some more about protests being banned . 
  do you trust the ny times ? 
  this is all western media so of course it 's slightly skewed against russia , but you can get the facts between the lines . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/08/world/europe/ukrainian-officials-in-east-move-to-blunt-pro-russia-forces.html really you only need like 5 minutes of googling to find all this . 
  the legally elected president was elected by the majority of the people . 
  in a modern democracy that means the majority in general agrees with his actions .
