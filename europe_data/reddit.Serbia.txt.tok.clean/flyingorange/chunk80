   plural construction is easier - simply adding s or es at the end of the word , forum - fora , child - children , scissors - scissors forums , childs and scissor is not correct  independence of words with regards to the rest of the sentence . 
  true , but in english the word order is much more important , and just by moving around the words in the sentence you can change its meaning . 
  so it 's more difficult to understand the meaning of the sentence if you do n't understand the role of each word in it . 
  in serbian , i can just look at the suffix/pade \u017e and see what the role of the word is ( * who * is doing * what * to * whom * )  a clear , precise , and short syntax . 
  `` we are loading the people on the boat '' . 
  the serbian version is shorter and more precise : `` ukrcavamo ljude na brod '' . 
   you moved , i had moved , we have moved but then consider that you use the word `` have '' , which means possession . 
  so you said that `` i am possessing movement '' which makes no sense to someone just learning english . 
  and you see that have/has * does * change based on the person and time , similar to serbian grammar . 
   the few annoying things about english imho is the existence of the article hungarian has articles and it makes things a lot easier . 
  i think in this regard serbian is more difficult because you can have double-meanings without an article . 
  `` i drank the coffee '' . 
  `` i drank a coffee '' . 
  did you drink * the * specific coffee , or just any other coffee ? 
   serbian follows the always-one-letter-one-sound rule . 
  but serbian is also a partially tonal language and the tone of a letter can change the meaning of the word . 
  here 's an example you learn in school : `` gore gore gore gore no\u0161to gore gore dole '' ( translated : the hills burn worse high-up than they burn below '', 
  my problem with pinyin is that it 's strongly based on english spelling , which is quite different from the spelling of other languages that use latin characters . 
  for example , i understand that you do n't pronounce the final e ? 
  so is `` he '' pronounced as `` h\u00e9 '' or `` h\u00f6 '' or `` h '' or something else ... ? 
  they should 've taken some better system , like a combination of german and croatian , and added tonal marks like the vietnamese did . 
  that would 've made the whole thing a lot easier for non-english speakers since that way more sounds would be covered ( for example , write \u010di instead of chi ) . 
  downvoted for the sensationalist title . 
  orban went to the eu parliament to answer the accusations personally , if nothing else that shows him to be a brave politician . 
  it 's not hard to `` denounce him in his face '' when he comes to you . 
  maybe it 's hard but nowadays english is everywhere and people learn some of it from childhood , so it 's not that difficult to learn . 
  maybe a 100 years ago it was more difficult . 
  for me i remember the most difficult part was learning when to pronounce c as k and when as s. i think there is no good rule for it , you need to memorize which words come from latin/french and which do n't . 
  yes but it 's always above a letter , not between two . 
  there 's a separate button for \u00e9 , you do n't have to press \u00b4 and e, 
  soon the croatian egg market will be in our clutches !!, 
  what 's the difference between \u00b4 and ` ? 
   close with 5.4 million people ... who want to work but can not you know , i 'm sure i 'll get downvoted for this because i 'm not `` showing enough pity '' for these poor people , but ...

  the spanish are wonderful people but i do n't think they really `` want to work '' as the article says . 
  they all want a high-paying job in some nice office and leave the shitty jobs to romanian immigrants . 
  this is a small number of idiots putting the rest of us in shame . 
  i 've downvoted the thread cause i want to hide the shame .

  languages and religions ? 
  make sure you break up the protestant and orthodox religions to get higher diversity , and do n't forget to include the atheists cause they make a significant % in many countries . 
  there you have it , the prime minister said the same thing i just said moments ago . 
  maybe he 's reading reddit and stealing my ideas  http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/markets/hungarys-prime-minister-asks-eu-imf-to-explain-their-opposition-to-new-laws/2012/01/12/giqaefrftp_story.html  ... what we need is not political opinion , but arguments . 
  when the arguments on behalf of the european union are convincing then there is no reason not to [ accept ], 
  would you not agree that the right thing to do is for them to publish their legal analysis , wait for hungary to analize it , and if they do n't comply in , let 's say two weeks , then the eu commission starts the procedure ? 
  because technically this analysis that the commission is doing has also started just about a week ago . 
  the laws in question were brought on the last days of december , it took about a week for them to get translated , so the commission got their law some time in the previous week . 
  they said they 'll publish their analysis next tuesday , so that 's two weeks of work since they got the translated version of the law . 
  it would only be fair to allow the equal amount of time for the hungarian government to react . 
  i did read the statement on the commission 's website and i did a little search too and could n't find any explanation of those three points . 
  like you mentioned , they said they 'll have the detailed analysis on tuesday , * but then they 'll sue . 
  * i do n't see how can they expect a country to comply with their demands if they do n't say which eu law is being broken , but threaten that if they do have to explain their points then hungary 's screwed . 
  they basically say `` do it now on a `` yes , master '' basis , or else we 'll sue you and * only then * we 'll actually point out why we think what you 're doing is wrong '' . 
  the fair thing would be to at least point out the sections of the eu laws that are being broken , and if the hungarian side does n't react then they should go ahead and sue . 
  ... without saying which rules have been broken . 
  they just expressed concerns over 3 things , and did n't mention which eu laws are those things breaking . 
  i just love the whole tone of the message . 
  `` do what we say or else ... ! '', 
  they probably copied it from austria , which also requires 10 years of continuous , unbroken residence .

  gyurcsany 's party to save hungary ? 
  to quote his words , maybe if he `` lies every morning , evening and night '' even more than so far , he 'll manage to win back this `` whore of a country '' .

  i was in warsaw 15 years ago and absolutely loved it , it was one of the best times in my life . 
  as you said a lot has changed since so maybe it 's not the same as i remember it anymore . 
  i 've met a lot of polish people through couchsurfing or during hitchhiking ( polish hitchhikers are * everywhere * ) , and in my view the people are more reserved/colder than how i imagine them in my stereotype . 
  i did make a few friends but it took longer than , for example , with a spanish . 
  most people from poland described the country as a dark and dangerous place , but i do n't believe it . 
  for example , it was funny when a guy from lublin said people usually avoid streets with no lights during the night cause wild dogs attack them  ) he made it sound like wild dogs are roaming the streets , which i do n't think is true . 
  it 's also amazing that every polish person i 've met knew about `` polak wegier dwa bratanki ... '' , 
  the word `` hungary '' came up a lot in this subforum in the past 2 weeks , just looks for any of the older posts in r/europe . 
  this issue has already been explained earlier . 
  fake edit : [ read this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/o1gn6/please_write_to_your_meps_concerning_hungary/c3dvamg ), 
  actually slovenia has just two brands of beer and they both taste the same so i 'm not sure why you mentioned beer . 
  slovenian wine is a different story though . 
  this newspaper is not meant to be read by the eu but by brainwashed nationalist grandpas . 
  that someone actually took an article and translated it to english is just bad luck . 
  `` politika '' is and always was the populist mouthspeak of the government . 
  even in serbia only old people read it ( some say they get it for free , otherwise they would n't bother either ) . 
  i see the old bulgaria is left uninhabited , can hungary move in ? 
   also , if it 's simply a technicality , why ca n't you just let them have it ? 
  for the same reason we do n't allow people to fuck on the streets . 
  they 're not hurting anyone , but the streets were not meant to be places for people to have sex . 
  is this really so difficult to understand ? 
  it 's not a question of right but technicality . 
  if they ca n't make children even in theory then they ca n't join in marriage . 
  that 's the same thing as if a guy claims he 's discriminated cause he can not go on a pregnancy leave , it 's physically not possible . 
  this is nothing new , the newspapers have been complaining about these issues for some time now . 
  i think it 's best to wait what the european commission will say . 
   i do think that the man and woman part is an accidental bad wording well then you 're wrong , the un has never adopted a resolution in support of gay marriage because a lot of countries oppose it . 
  read something [ on wikipedia about it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexual_orientation_and_gender_identity_at_the_united_nations ) .
