  they usually had to go back because they lost their job in germany/austria/netherlands etc. 
  and could n't find another job . 
  serbia is a different case , you can actually live a good life there . 
  this is why so many bosnian students come to serbia every year and never go back . 
  i do n't really understand this whole bonds issue and interest rates , so i was wondering if anyone could clarify if what this article is saying is true , or it 's just some anti-eu propaganda . 
  it had the highest number of multiethnic marriages in the country . 
  i guess when all that was ruined then the older generation just gave up , and the younger generation never knew what it was like to live in a rich country so they do n't care . 
   do you see me celebrating italy ? 
  i was n't talking about you , i was trying to explain the situation in a way that you might understand through your own history . 
  if italians had been living in poverty for a long time while their neighbors prospered , then why ca n't other people do the same ? 
  everyone that could , has gotten out of that country since . 
  those that remain prefer the status quo , or wait till nato falls apart so they could unite with the motherland . 
  when you and your family have suffered a lot then you 're not going to just forget about it . 
  most people do n't hate the other nationalities because of some minor difference as you see it , but because the other nationality forced their family to walk through minefields . 
  to turn it around , italy also had its share of concentrating too much on fascism and conquering neighboring peoples , instead of improving the economy of what was then one of the poorest european countries . 
  you became `` enlightened '' only after the americans occupied you and invested into your industry . 
  the difference with bosnia is that it 's strategically not important so no one is investing in it . 
  you 're right , however , you 're seeing things from an italian perspective . 
  in bosnia there never was economic prosperity , and this financial doom you 're talking about , it 's been a constant thing ever since the wars . 
  just because italians or european countries in general have a hard time due to the economic downturn , it does n't mean that the bosnians did n't have an equally hard time before this economic crisis started . 
  to put it simply , there 's been a crisis here for 20 years . 
  nothing new has happened recently , so why should any things get higher priority than before . 
  i 'm a hungarian that was born and lived most of my life in serbia , and this post from facebook is pure bullshit . 
  hungarians from hungary have no idea what life under milosevic was , and just because some radio lost its frequency it does n't mean you 're having it worse than serbia in the 90 ` es . 
  come back when the owner of klubradio gets shot by the secret police , until then quit this endless whining about dictatorship . 
  hungarian commies are so annoying , they can suffer the greatest election defeat in modern hungary 's history and they still do n't get a clue that no one wants them around . 
  the greek crisis small rant : it 's amazing that people totally forgot a number of countries were involved this year in several months of bombing lybia , i.e. 
  these countries were at war . 
  it 's so not important to europeans that it is n't even on the list above ( and i had to think for a while to remember it ) . 
  i would stay away 50 meters from that bank at all times if i saw this ad . 
  maybe they are embarrassed , was the event commented in any way by any representative of the fidesz party ? 
  i 'm sorry but i do n't know anything about this case , and from c5rr 's comments it seems to me like it 's just a case of some old grandpas being overly patriotic . 
  i do n't see what representatives of the ruling party have got to do with a country 's official position . 
  hungary is not a single-party state and the currently ruling party also has internal divisions on a number of topics . 
  just because some people came in , said that they 're from the ruling party , and then tried to disrupt the seminar , it does n't mean that their actions were planned or even supported by the hungarian government . 
  what if tomorrow i trash some lbgt organization and claim that i 'm doing it in the name of whatever party rules sweden at the moment ? 
  does it mean sweden hates gays ? 
  http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/constitution_of_hungary but i do n't think this is the newest version . 
  [ this pdf ] ( http://www.mkab.hu/admin/data/file/1140_magyarorszag_alaptorvenye.pdf ) is from the website of the constitutional court and will become official from january 1 , 2012 , but it 's in hungarian and i could n't find an english version . 
  edit : just started reading the google translated version and it 's a joke . 
   we are proud of the hungarian people of great intellectual . 
  it sounds like we 're proud that we 're so smart , when in fact the original says we 're proud of the hungarian people that created intellectual creations . 
  the problem with a centralized european union would be that , in my opinion , most of the leadership would come from the `` old members '' , who would n't care about the problems in central and eastern europe . 
  it 's estimated that more than 100 thousand people turned up to defend the government 's policies against international pressure . 
  this protest may turn out to be much larger than the anti-government one a few weeks ago , which all the foreign media talked about . 
  and surprise surprise , this news is nowhere to be found on any of the foreign language media . 
  so [ here 's a google-translated one ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=hu&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.hirado.hu%2fhirek%2f2012%2f01%2f21%2f14%2felindultak_a_videkiek_a_budapesti_bekemenetre__fotok.aspx&amp;act=url ) from hungarian . 
  i saw on this subreddit that a few british people contacted their meps regarding the acta issue . 
  i was wondering if i can do something similar as a hungarian citizen ? 
  do i have an mep too in the european parliament that 's supposed to read my mails , or is this just a british thing ? 
  considering there is a neverending flood of posts about how hard the greeks ( and recently the spanish ) live , i thought it would be interesting to translate [ an article ] ( http://www.blic.rs/vesti/hronika/345223/nastradali-radeci-za-1000-dinara-i-kilogram-pasulja ) of what 's life like in serbia ( specifically the poor south ) . 
  i 'm interested if there 's a similar situation elsewhere in europe . 
  so here goes ... my uncle radomir , the poor guy , died for a daily wage of 1000 dinars ( 8,7 eur ) . 
  no one works in the family , they 're all poor , like most people here in the south - tells us boban , nephew of radomir dejkovi\u0107 ( 65 ) from gornja trebi\u0161nja , one of the three laborers that died yesterday in bzovik . 
  radomir dejkovi\u0107 , aleksandar begovi\u0107 ( 55 ) and dobrila ko\u010di\u0107 ( 56 ) died when their truck accidentally switched into reverse and fell down a cliff . 
  poverty forced them to work as laborers at an old age , far from their home . 
  - because of that poverty he left to golija to pick potatoes . 
  he hoped to make money so his family could survive . 
  he worked there for three weeks , and before that he worked as a laborer in vranje for 500-1000 dinars a day , or sometimes even a bag of beans or some cheese , just so he could feed his family - radomir 's nephew tells us . 
  dobrila 's husband died four years ago . 
  they did n't have children or close relatives in the village . 
  during winter she sometimes got social welfare , and during summer she worked as a laborer . 
  she went to pick cherries , raspberries , plums ... all day she worked for 500-1000 dinars . 
  from the money she made from picking cherries she fixed her shed , so that her firewood would n't get wet during the winter , and from this last wage she planned to fix her ceiling , which recently collapsed over her bed and injured her leg . 
  she was afraid the snow might destroy her weathered house since she had nowhere else to go - milena ra\u0161i\u0107 , one of the neighbors tells us . 
  milena 's uncle is aleksandar , one of the people that died in the accident . 
  another neighbor , zorica \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 , tells us that her electricity was cut because of unpaid bills , so she lived in the dark . 
  she planned to pay the bills when she got money from social welfare . 
  vesna milo\u0161evi\u0107 , a far cousin says that dobrila was refused for social help for the next three months . 
  - aleksandar first went to pick potatoes . 
  during summer we picked apples in kelebia . 
  seasonal work was our only income - says bojana mustafi\u0107 , the wife of the deceised who lives with her daughter and two grandsons in a small house . 
  aleksandar used to work in the factories `` merima '' , `` fabrika ulja '' and in the kru\u0161evac municipality , and in the last few years he was doing seasonal jobs . 
  inspired by [ another thread ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h38ga.png ) , can you tell me what the colors of your national flag repesent ? 
  and to make it more interesting , do it without looking it up on wikipedia !, 
  for example , i 've no idea what the hungarian flag means , i 'm guessing the green is for green fields but that 's about it . 
  i also seem to remember someone mentioning that france 's flag is just the dutch flag rotated by 90 degrees , because during the french revolution the dutch represented freedom . 
  but where does the + in the swiss flag come from , or why do all scandianian countries have that + -- in their flags ? 
  http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2012&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=08&amp;nav_id=83058 tldr : hardcore criminals will be set free to continue their life of crime . 
  some examples are [ miladin kova\u010devi\u0107 ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/nyregion/28serb.html ) , who beat his fellow american student to coma while living in the us and [ uro\u0161 mi\u0161i\u0107 ] ( http://www.theoffside.com/europe/cop-attacked-at-red-star-match.html ) , who tried to murder a policeman by sticking a torch in his mouth . 
  others , such as sretenu joci\u0107 who was involved in the murder of french football fan , will only get their sentence reduced by 10 % . 
  and then the police proceeded to remove all catalan flags from government buildings . 
  would you consider that to be oppression , or would you agree that only the spanish flag should be used ? 
  in hungarian we used to call every people a name that 's not the same as what they called themselves . 
  this changed in the last century when the language was reformed , but the names still exist in family and street names . 
  here 's a list austrian - osztr\u00e1k - probably obvious slovak - t\u00f3th - probably originates from `` teuton '' , not used anymore polish - lengyel - initially there were two polish tribes , the poles and the lendzians , and eventually the poles won ; however , the hungarians continued to use the name of the other tribe romanians - ol\u00e1h - comes from slavic vlach , not used anymore serbs - r\u00e1c - comes from ra\u0161ka , the medieval name of the serb kingdom , not used anymore slovenes - vend - comes from german wend , not used anymore germans - n\u00e9met - comes from slavic nemec , it means `` mute '' ( they do n't know how to speak ) italians - olasz - still used today , the italians are called this way because their language sounds the same as romanian , which used to be called ol\u00e1h ( see above ) is there some special name you have/had for your neighbors ? 
  for example , i know that the germans are allemagne in french , or that austrians are called rakusko in czech ...

  http://news.sky.com/story/1068504/horsemeat-found-in-beef-from-hungary  he said he had bought 20 1kg bags of what he thought was diced beef from hungarian food ltd ** in may last year ** , rather than import it directly , but it sold so badly that he took four or five bags home for his family . 
   `` i did n't know about it , '' he said . 
   `` it tasted like beef , it looked like beef . 
   `` i was shocked today when environmental health told what happened exactly . '', 
   he said they sold 12 or so bags of the horsemeat , and there were still three bags in the freezer which were taken away today for tests . 
   he said the shop had ceased trading with hungarian food ltd after they `` fell out '' in july last year . 
  is it usual to buy beef and then sell it one year later ? 
  would n't it go bad ? 
  according to a decision made by the government , up to 1 billion forints ( 3 million eur ) will be spent on remembering the 100 year anniversary of the first world war .
