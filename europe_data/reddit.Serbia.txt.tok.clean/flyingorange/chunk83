  the decision says : `` one of the most important events in the 20th century , defining for both hungarian and world history , with lasting consequences '' was the world war which startd 100 years ago . 
  the conflict which lasted for four years started on july 28th , 1914 , with the declaration of war by austria-hungary against serbia . 
  austria-hungary asked for armistice on november 3rd , 1918 , but the so called paris peace accords were signed by the states established after its dissolution . 
  hungary signed the peace treaty on june 4th , 1920 .

  since january 1st 2011 , more than 420 thousand applications were submitted for receiving hungarian citizenship under the relaxed procedure and by april 3 , 2013 , 341.447 individuals have received the citizenship . 
  applications were received from countries all over the world , including 149.449 from romania , 46.400 from serbia , 10.437 from the ukraine , 161 from slovakia , 1060 from israel , 1289 from croatia , 1472 from germany , 139 from brazil , 1 from somalia , 1 from vietnam etc. 
  the numbers can be seen on the [ allampolgarsag.gov.hu ] ( http://allampolgarsag.gov.hu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=251:hirek1304042&amp;catid=1:friss-hirek&amp;itemid=50 ) website . 
  people can apply for hungarian citizenship under the relaxed procedure since january 3rd , 2011 . 
  according to the law , people that had hungarian citizenship before 1920 or between 1938 and 1945 , or their descendents , may be eligeable for citizenship if they can speak hungarian and do n't have a criminal record . 
  the applications do n't need to have a residence in hungary , they do n't need to provide proof of funds or knowledge of the constitution , which are conditions for those applying through the regular procedure . 
  the new procedure has caused some tensions in the neighboring countries fearing separatism among their ethnic hungarian minorities . 
  the most extreme case is slovakia where those who receive hungarian citizenship are automatically stripped of their slovakian one . 
  this explains the very low number of applications from slovakia , compared to the minority population in that country ( 458 thousand ) . 
  gaining hungarian citizenship is a symbolic act for most minority hungarians . 
  however , applicants from serbia or the ukraine have economic gains as well , since receiving hungarian citizenship lets them work and study in the eu . 
  the leader of sns and vice-premier of serbia aleksandar vu\u010di\u0107 received several death threats on his mobile phone during the day . 
  the threats are being sent by members of the radical party , and even nemanja \u0160arovi\u0107 the vice-president of the radical party sent him a threat from his personal phone . 
  the threats are coming in since this morning , and the senders are even signing them with their real first and last name . 
  the messages threaten vu\u010di\u0107 personally , but also members of his family . 
  the members of the radical party were handing out leaflets today , containing the phone numbers of vu\u010di\u0107 and da\u010di\u0107 ( the prime minister ) . 
   from 062144xxxx :  13:46 : `` bit . . you 've betrayed kosovo . 
  you 'll be murdered , just like zoran [ djindjic ] from ds ''  14:05 : `` and realize something , i know that others are writing to you too , but i really mean it ... ''  13,49 : `` traitor , you deserve a bullet . 
  to not live anymore . '', 
   from 062\u00a08354205 : `` just so you know , we 're preparing to topple the government . 
  better run , we 've got a sniper ''  from 065209xxxx :  `` damn you piece of shit ... 
  i hope the shiptars slaughter your kin and family '' the ministry of interior affairs has consulted the prosecutor 's office regarding the leaflets being handed out containing the phone numbers of prime minister ivica da\u010di\u0107 and vice premier aleksandar vu\u010di\u0107 , which the members of the radical party have been handing out today to supporters and citizens throughout serbia . 
  according to the ministry , the police will deal as per instructions from the prosecutor . 
  activists of srs are calling on the citizens to send sms to da\u010di\u0107 and vu\u010di\u0107 and in that way express their dissatisfaction regarding the brussels treaty draft . 
  the leaflets were being handed out in belgrade , smederevo , kikinda , novi sad , leskovac , po\u017earevac , kosovska mitrovica and other cities in serbia . 
  hi / r/europe !, 
  in my opinion whenever some news comes up on hungary it 's always bad news , and to my disappointment whenever something good happens , it 's never available in english . 
  because of this i decided to translate this article myself , hope you 'll find it interesting . 
  you should note that i took this article from [ a left-centrist news site ] ( http://www.origo.hu/gazdasag/gazdasag-plusz/20130419-no-a-realber-tobbet-er-a-nyugdij-csokken-a-gyogyszerek.html ) , which rarely says anything positive about the current government . 
  so i hope you 'll keep that in mind before accusing me of spreading propaganda . 
  i guess some people might also chuckle at the thought of an increase of * only * 20 euros per month ... but that 's minimum wage . 
  my earnings for instance went up a lot more . 
  note : 1 euro = 300 forints ** hungarians today live better than a year ago ** the success of the government 's measures can be valued in several thousand forints . 
  real wages have gone up , utility costs and inflation have gone down , which means more money is left in people 's pockets . 
  today the money that hungarians have is worth more , whether they 're employed or retired , and even the medicines became cheaper . 
  last week the country 's statistics office ( ksh ) published its latest data on wages . 
  according to this , real wages have gone up yet again , or in other words , taking inflation into count , the money that people were paid in the first two months of 2013 is worth more compared to the same period the year before . 
  a person who has an 8-hour , legal employment , earns on average 223 thousand forints , after taxes he can take home 146 thousand ( 487 eur ) . 
  last year in january-february the average gross salary was 217 thousand , which was worth 140 thousand after taxes . 
  that means an added 6 thousand ( 20 eur ) , or yearly 72 thousand forints . 
  http://static6.origos.hu/i/1304/20130419-realber-es-a-netto-atlagber.jpg blue = average salary after taxes red = increase in real value this increase in wages only matters if people can buy more when going to the store , that is , if the difference is n't lost due to inflation . 
  the annual inflation is between 2-3 % , which turns the 6000 forints into 3000 in real value ( yearly 36 thousand ) . 
  the increase in wages is n't affecting only the wealthy , since according to the ksh , the wages of laborers have also beaten the inflation . 
  the increase in real wages was caused by two measures by the government . 
  the minimum wage was increased to 98 thousand forints , while those with qualifications were guaranteed to earn no less than 114 thousand . 
  this is not the first time that the minimum wage was raised ; however , previous measures were nullified by increased taxes . 
  because of this , the minimum wage after taxes usually stayed around 60 thousand forints . 
  this year is the first time in a long period that it has increased to 64 thousand . 
  the other measure was the removal of the salary ceiling , which taxed those earning above 202 thousand after taxes . 
  with the removal of the ceiling and the introduction of a flat tax rate , those earning above 202 thousand now earn even more . 
  http://static8.origos.hu/i/1304/20130419-inflacio-20122013.jpg inflation ** reducing utility bills : +11 thousand forints ** the inflation hit a 36 year record low this year mostly thanks to a decree that reduced the price of utilities , although the price of food also went up only 3.6 % , less than last year when we had severe droughts . 
  the government decree slashed energy prices by 10 % . 
  according to an earlier calculation , this meant an average annual saving of 11 thousand forints per household . 
  government politicians since have promised to reduce prices for water and trash delivery as well . 
  when these measures were introduced , gy\u00f6rgy matolcsy , then finance minister , hoped that consumer demand will increase . 
  according to the ministry , consumer spending would 've gone down 0.5 % this year without the decree , however , now they expect it to go up . 
  so far this has n't yet materialized , however , the consumer confidence index shows some improvement . 
  by itself the yearly 11 thousand forints are n't enough to kick-start consumer spending , but combined with lower inflation , increased real wages and real pensions , there may actually be a positive effect . 
  ** retirement pensions : +24 thousand forints ** retired people should look forward to the reduced inflation . 
  the government plans pensions based on inflation , and last year they expected it to be 5 % , which means the pensions went up 5.2 % on average . 
  however , later it turned out that the inflation was lower , somewhere around 3.1 % . 
  the market is more optimistic than the government statisticians : reuters analysts expect the inflation in march to be 2.9 % , but there were even some analysts that forecast a 2 % inflation . 
  the inflation forecast last year proved to be wrong , however the government left the pensions intact . 
  average pensions in december amounted to 106550 forints - and after the increase in january it became 112090 . 
  if the inflation remains at 3.1 % as forecast , then an average retired person will receive 2000 forints per month in real added value . 
  if the more optimistic analysts get it right , it could be even 3000 forints . 
  ** medicines : +700 forints ** the government changed the way that medical subsidies are given to producers - this was in planning since 2011 . 
  one of the changes was the introduction of blind bidding , which means that producers will compete for government subsidies without knowing what their competitors offer . 
  the national health service ( oep ) picks the cheapest medicine among a range of equal ones , and because of the blind bidding , producers do n't know what prices their competitors are offering , so they 're forced to lower their prices . 
  according to oep the price of medicine went down 35 % since the new rule was introduced , and more than half of all medicines experienced some kind of price reduction . 
  as a consequence , the population spent 7 billion forints less on medicine than the previous year , and the government also saved 28 billion . 
  7 billion means just 700 per capita , but those who need to buy more medicine obviously save more than they used to . 
  ** always a good thing ** according to j\u00e1nos bencsik , an mp from the governing fidesz party , it 's no surprise than things worked out this way . 
  `` as an ordinary member of the parliament i do n't have insight into the daily decision making , however it can be said that this is the nature of politics : we tried to do our work so that the positive effects of our measures become tangible at the end of the cycle '' - he said . 
  two other fidesz mps also claimed that there 's no special reason why things turned out so well just now , with less than a year till elections . 
  `` this is not an election issue , this is how things normally happen : we had to build the foundation first which later made people 's lives easier '' - said gy\u00f6rgy balla . 
  he says people `` can get suspicious '' because of the coming elections , since `` it 's obviously every government 's goal to stay in power '' , but `` if we 're improving people 's lives without taking up new loans , then it 's always a good thing '' . 
  name personal names that you think exists only for your people . 
  this means christian and muslim names are excluded since they exist everywhere . 
  i 'd like to hear names like dagobert , ram\u00f3n , alja\u017e or mojca . 
  i 'll start with hungarian . 
  so inspired by a recent thread here i decided to make danish rye bread . 
  i bought rye flour and found a recipe on the internet which basically goes like : day 1 : mix rye with water and dry yeast day 2 : mix day 3 : mix day 4 : add more rye etc. 
  and you can bake it what happened for me is : day 1 : mix rye with water and dry yeast day 2 : starts to smell funny day 3 : fungae starts appearing and i throw it out could some dane/finn/swede / etc. 
  please to tell me how a real , good rye bread is made ? 
  i did n't find any articles in english so here 's a crappy translation from google : http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=hu&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fitthon.transindex.ro%2f%3fhir%3d33559&amp;act=url in brief : hungarians are demanding that they should get a national autonomy in the historical region of szekelyland . 
  the current government plans to divide the country into regions without taking into account the ethnic makeup . 
  question from people actually living in romania : how big were these protests ? 
  it 's very hard to find anything about this that is n't written by hungarian media , so perhaps they 're really small ? 
  i was just looking at [ the thread about a pro-eu demonstration ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1rcgef/massive_attendance_at_a_proeu_demonstration_going/ ) in ukraine and was about to leave a comment , but then i saw that absolutely everyone that did n't support the protest got massively downvoted . 
  as in , yannanth got -18 downvotes for no reason i can think of , linrubio got -16 downvotes for saying it 's not a big crowd etc. 
  i would suggest the mods here make some css changes so that they either hide the downvote button , or put a little caption next to it saying `` do not downvote if you disagree '' . 
  this is not the first time i 'm seeing this thing and i understand that / r/europe is mostly a pro-eu circlejerk , but that does n't mean we should keep it that way and the mods should do more to allow the other side have a say . 
  [ here ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=hu&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2findex.hu%2fkulfold%2f2013%2f12%2f08%2fmi_vagyunk_a_leggazdagabb_szenvedok%2f&amp;act=url ) is the translated article , it basically says that if you take gdp into account , hungarians feel they are living worse than haiti , had both countries have the same level of development . 
  bulgarians feel their lives suck the most in the world but they are also more poor , so poverty could explain some of the unhappiness .
