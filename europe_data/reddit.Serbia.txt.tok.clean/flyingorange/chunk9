  that he was ousted by an angry mob of west ukrainans does n't mean the whole country suddenly turned pro-eu . 
  in fact , the demonstrations in the crimea ( prior to the invasion ) and donetsk clearly show they do n't . 
  the eu could n't even handle tiny switzerland , why would anyone think they could deal with a major power ? 
   the ** western ** ukrainian people , without crimea , prefer fixed that for you, 
  that 's racist !, 
  and they got a nobel prize for being such a good boy ... maybe if russia does n't fight a war in the end , they should get one too ? 
  i remember in 1999 just before the kosovo war started , there were talks of ww3 breaking out , the russians broke off some important talks etc. 
  and the un security council clearly did not allow nato to bomb serbia . 
  back then , there was a lot of concern of a `` catastrophe '' happening ... nato did n't give shit and went ahead with its illegal war . 
  under nato i mean germany also participated , which is now so concerned about what is happening in ukraine . 
  i bet poland is shitting its pants because they think the possibility of russia attacking nato is huuuge . 
  what nato is doing is classical sable rattling , it has nothing to do with fears . 
  when the us just invaded another country several times in the past decade , was that a `` catastrophe '' ? 
  this subreddit is really getting on my nerves ... why are you people downvoting someone who is pointing you the obvious hypocrisy in merkel 's statement ? 
  why is it ok for [ poland and the us to hold war games ] ( http://www.voanews.com/content/reu-us-polish-war-games-start-bad-weather-delays-naval-drills/1868889.html ) but when russia does it , it 's a `` catastrophe '' ? 
  the dax , ftse and euro stoxx 50 indexes also fell 5-10 % in the past week so this is more than just related to russia . 
  that 's hilarious, 
  cool , but as i understand they are only talk about building a pipeline ? 
  so that would take another decade until it 's realized . 
  ukraine is as big as france and has a pop . 
  of like 40 million , hungary is a tiny pop . 
  9 million country . 
  i do n't think they 're afraid , they 're probably just vandals who live out their frustrations , and since the russians would actually fight back , they only have ... 
  i do n't think they can ban people , only officials . 
  so if they come as ordinary eu citizens they have the right for free movement . 
  what 's that $ 1 bag there ? 
  american help ? 
  clearly the whole building needs to be demolished but i never was arguing that it should n't . 
  my point was we need to look at how the building got into the state it is now , and maybe learn something from it . 
  just blaming it on `` the authorities '' means actually that no one is responsible . 
   and have them reimburse me for the purchase . 
  that 's weird ... 
  i agree about fixing the pipes and the roof , that is the landlord 's responsibility . 
  but the stuff that ** you ** break should be paid/fixed by ** you ** . 
  in that sense , if you live in a white room for a year and the walls become yellow , then you need to pay for them to get painted . 
  if you 're showering and the water is leaking on the apartment below you , then you fix their ceiling ( or pay for it ) , not the administration . 
  if you break the pipes intentionally then you should pay for it . 
  if they break themselves then it 's not your responsibility . 
  mould happens . 
  i had it in my current apartment where i live as a subtenant . 
  guess what i did : a ) waited for the landlord to clean the walls b ) paid 3 euros for the fucking spray and cleaned it myself it 's not rocket science . 
  it takes just 30 minutes . 
  i have no idea how some of the serious damage happened , and i wo n't make theories because that would lead to another discussion ... let 's just say that someone who studies 12-14 hours a day , like what people on this thread are claiming , wo n't rip out a pipe from the wall . 
   and that totally exempts the people that own this building and who are responsible for them of everything ? 
  i have lived as a subtenant in many people 's apartments . 
  if the toilet is dirty i clean it . 
  if i break something , i fix it . 
  if the walls are dirty when i leave , i 'll pay for them to get painted . 
  of course major works like fixing the pipes or the roof , that are n't caused by me , are paid by the landlord . 
  you know what would happen if i just said `` fuck it it 's not my responsibility '' ? 
  well i do n't know , maybe the landlord would kick my ass . 
  do you think what i 'm saying here is wrong ? 
  i agree , yes , there should be some basic service here , perhaps a cleaning lady to mop up the floors every weekend . 
  we do n't know , maybe there * is * a cleaning lady . 
  but a building can not get ruined this much without the active participation of the tenants . 
  if the general attitude is that `` someone else will fix it '' and `` i 'm not going to pay for it if it will help someone else too '' , then you get the result on these pictures . 
   55 euros per month where do i sign up ? 
  you forgot about the 65 euros you get back as food . 
  you 're effectively paying -10 euros . 
  paying ? 
  they 're paying 55 euros/month and receive 65 euros of food stamps in return . 
  it seems to me they 're paying -10 euros . 
  well then they obviously failed at that because the dorm rooms look miserable . 
  maybe they just were n't responsible . 
  as people . 
  let me ask you a question : you are studying in your room and it 's night , the light bulb burns out . 
  what do you do ? 
  wait for the `` administration '' to fix it or buy the damn lamp yourself ? 
  now extrapolate the situation to washing floors and fixing pipes . 
  in the rest of your life you will have situations when you are * working * 15-16 hours for months , every day , on weekends too , and you 'll be living in your own apartment . 
  who will fix your apartment for you ? 
  this building is beyond repair , i 'm not denying that . 
  i 'm trying to point to the cause of its current state . 
  back when the * first * pipe broke , they * should have * spent their daddy 's allowance on fixing it . 
  then it would 've cost a lot less . 
  now it 's too late . 
   buildings like this explain to me how is a building like this different from an ordinary high rise building , where people live ? 
  if your kitchen is rotting are you going to complain about the `` institutions '' or will you fix it ? 
  if the pipes are broken then do you fix it , or you leave it broken ? 
  i mean it 's obvious that in this situation it was like `` oh the pipe is broken ? 
  fuck it i 'll be out of this room in 4 months anyway . 
  i 'm not going to spend 10 euros of * my own money * to fix it ! '', 
   that is why that norwegian prisons look how they do or maybe because the prisoners clean up after themselves . 
   these students are lazy if the skin color of these students was just a little bit darker then we 'd have people on this forum saying how the state of the building is typical because they are genetically lazy , and others would say that it 's because they are victims of opression . 
  since i 'm guessing most of these students are not roma , they do n't have that `` excuse '' : they are just lazy as shit . 
  sorry i had a fucked up day, 
  clearly the building did n't turn into what it is over night . 
  it 's decades of `` i do n't give a fuck '' and `` it 's not my job '' attitude that happened here . 
  i 'm not saying it 's fixable now , only that there 's a reason why a norwegian prison looks better than this dorm , and it 's not aliens or jews . 
  and perhaps you 're a proponent of the `` no one can pay me so little as little i can work '' work ethic ? 
  the `` acting '' president , you mean the guy that came to power through the coup ? 
  he has as much legitimacy as moamer ghaddafi . 
  how is a student prevented from spending 1 hour a day from cleaning up the place he lives in ? 
  it 's what he/she will have to do anyway for the rest of the life , unless they can afford to pay a housekeeper . 
  it 's not a shame to do house work . 
  you know what these health , able-bodied young boys and girls could do ? 
  get off their asses and clean up the place where they live !, 
  it 's not that hard , get one of those 0.2 eur sponges , an 1 eur detergent , kneel down and clean . 
  wikipedia says tartar is used for the sauce :  nowadays tatar is usually used to refer to the people , but tartar is still almost always used for derived terms such as tartar sauce or steak tartare, 
   there was a un sanctioned nato-led multinational force that was legal in all respects of international law except the un resolution was brought after serbia was bombed into submission , and it was signed ( and approved by russia ) only because it guaranteed that kosovo will remain part of serbia .
