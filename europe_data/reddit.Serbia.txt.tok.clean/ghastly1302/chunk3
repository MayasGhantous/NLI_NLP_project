  none that i know off . 
  seems like an american thing . 
   erm , that 's not how international law works , dear serb . 
  i am a realist , i do not believe in fairy tales . 
  `` international law '' does not work at all . 
  or rather , it `` works '' only when it 's in favor of the great powers . 
   the fact that your country has a history of dickish moves that the us stopped , does n't mean there is some international conspiracy in favor of the us . 
  i love how you immediately bring up kosovo even thought i did n't . 
  everyone here knows that butchering muslims is our national pastime , am i right ? 
  as far as i am concerned , milosevic was a traitor and he deserved the death penalty for what he did to this country . 
  not only him , but his entire ruling clique and their allies . 
  but let 's talk about kosovo , if you insist ... 
  the entire kosovo affair is one giant middle finger to `` international law '' . 
  nato , members of the united nations , bombed a sovereign country without security council authorization . 
  regime in pristina declared independence in direct violation of serbian law , and dozens of members of the united nations recognized this , in direct violation of the security council resolution 1244 . 
  because geopolitics . 
  in the current world order , america sits at the top . 
  they can not be wrong - they fight for freedom and democracy . 
  their wars are not wars , but `` humanitarian interventions '' . 
  their satellites are not their satellites , but their `` partners '' . 
  republicans somehow worship him even though he tripled the national debt . 
  avoid them like the plague . 
  i do n't even want to think about such a colossal waste of money and time . 
  [ me_irl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocw3fbqpqku ), 
  immigration is a non-issue here because no one wants to immigrate . 
  okay that 's a joke , but only partially . 
  nah , we 've just been raising and training them like that for a long time . 
   now i think that too many people are influenced far too easily . 
  because they are raised and trained to be like that . 
  social media was a horrendous mistake . 
   i also support . 
  i think amateurism and opportunism are the greatest weaknesses of present day western democracies the system demands it . 
  liberal democracy demands demagoguery and deception because it treats government as just another product . 
  mass media chases profit , not truth . 
  politicians seek to satisfy the temporary whims of the crowds , because that 's their job . 
  on top of this , the large holders of capital have an enormous amount of influence on the liberal government . 
  i am becoming an isolationist . 
  not a xenophobe or a racist , just isolationist . 
  i am increasingly supportive of mandatory military education in schools . 
  i 've been contemplating a new system of democratic government . 
  let 's call it `` rational democracy '' . 
  a council of elected professionals enacting the will of a citizen legislature presiding over a decentralized system of autonomous regions . 
  there is only one real party here . 
  the ** serbian progressive party ( sns ) ** . 
  it 's not a party though but a personality cult and a jobs program . 
  every tenth serb is a member , just like in the old days of the league of communists . 
  back then , you needed to be a party member to reach the top , but now , you need to be a party member to become a janitor . 
  it has no real supporters because it has no real principles . 
  its voters are the impoverished , the deluded , and the opportunistic . 
  everything revolves around the dear leader , his majesty , president-prime minister alexandar vucic . 
  there are also a few minor parties around it , but they are too worthless to be mentioned . 
  sns directly holds 131 out 250 seats in the legislature . 
  they originally seized power by courting the ** socialist party of serbia ( sps ) ** , who are actually right-wing populists and notable turncoats . 
  they are the second largest party . 
  they are the last remaining shadow of milosevic 's regime . 
  it is only logical that they would side with milosevic 's disciple and former minister of propaganda . 
  since the rise of sns-sps regime , vucic worked to marginalize them . 
  and he succeeded . 
  in the five years since the takeover , sps is a non-factor in decision-making . 
  they know where the power lies now . 
  still , any eventual fall of vucic must involve courting these hyenas , since they still have a seizable voting block . 
  do n't ask me how , i have no idea . 
  sps directly holds 29 seats in the legislature . 
  the third largest party are actually the former comrades of our president-prime minister . 
  the ** serbian radical party ( srs ) ** . 
  this was when our president was calling for the murder of a 100 muslims for every dead serb . 
  the radicals are the old ultranationalists and old accomplices of milosevic . 
  but they are largely toothless these days . 
  when their leader was sent to the hague , they largely faded away . 
  but since he returned , they experienced a small but sizable surge in popularity and were able to become the largest opposition party . 
  srs directly holds 22 seats in the legislature . 
  the fourth and fifth place are largely occupied by remnants of the old regime - disparate leftovers the ** democratic party ( ds ) ** , which collapsed when sns-sps regime took power . 
  these are europhiles , neoliberals , social democrats and such . 
  there is also an anti-corruption movement led by a former sns minister who fell out of favor . 
  they all collectively hold 45 seats in the legislature . 
  and finally , the last notable grouping is ** dveri and dss ** . 
  dveri are a relatively new nationalist and conservative movement . 
  they are the only party in parliament which never held power , so it is quite probable they are the only ones with some principles . 
  they are anti-lgbt , want to subsidize large families , and like everyone else in the opposition , they claim they want to end corruption , nepotism and cronyism . 
  dss , or democratic party of serbia , was once the ruling party , in the early days of post-milosevic era , but they largely fell into obscurity when their long-time leader resigned after sns-sps takeover . 
  that is pretty much it . 
  no problem . 
  i would like to add that legal immunity would be abolished . 
  i was truly stunned when i realized that elected politicians are literally above the law . 
  unless they are caught in flagrante by the police , they can not be investigated or persecuted . 
   why is the hatred for the nato operations in serbia directed at nato and the west , rather than at milo\u0161evi\u0107 ? 
  multiple reasons , including but not limited to the fact that nato bombed , not milosevic , and they did it without un authorization , but also milosevic 's own propaganda . 
  for example , people still think that the bombing ( operation allied force/noble anvil ) was called `` merciful angel '' , and that is a complete fabrication which came from milosevic 's propaganda machine . 
   my personal experience has been that milo\u0161evi\u0107 is quite widely despised ... and rightly so . 
  the man was a bastard and quite frankly , a traitor . 
   second , you reference `` renouncing liberal ` democracy ' and party rule '' - would you mind elaborating a bit on where you would like to see things go ? 
  that 's difficult . 
  there is so much i would like to address . 
  for starters , there should be no such thing as a `` politician '' . 
  that is a non-profession . 
  the republic ( central government ) should be governed by a council of elected professionals enacting the will of a citizen legislature and under the eye of an impartial and skilled judiciary . 
  the republic itself would preside over a decentralized system of regions which govern themselves with minimal interference from the center . 
  in this system , there is no place for political parties , since power is no longer treated as a prize to be won , nor can it be seized by one individual or one organization because it is distributed . 
  elections are no longer a vain spectacle and governing is no longer a way to enrich yourself and your pals . 
  economically , the main role of the republic is to keep the economy in the hands of the people - to allow the economy to organize itself .
