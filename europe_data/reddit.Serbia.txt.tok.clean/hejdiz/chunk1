donkey cheese !!, 
  also the word `` vampire '' is the only serbian word in english so that 's cool . 
  we 're no1 in raspberry production ( 30 % of the world 's raspberries ) . 
  exit festival . 
  the way our language sounds like italian and russian had a baby and it got fucking kidnapped by turkey for 5 centuries i mean cooome oooon [ removed ] . 
  no but seriously we 're over it now . 
  as for europe , proud of our collective history , the learning and evolving of ideas , peace ( kind of ) . 
  to clarify further at first they said in like a 30 second segment that there were only 100 drunk and drugged out hooligans ( a lie ) then when numbers in belgrade reached 80k they had to do a full report . 
  but they still do n't want to do it ... they were forced to . 
  wth hingary we were protesting first - . - thunder-thieves i am shooketh, 
  these people need to be tailed 24/7 . 
  by many cops . 
  when they start being shady , couple of rubber bullets ( to not kill them if they 're innocent ) but i would rather just lock them in solitary confindment . 
  and no i do n't think all `` brown people '' or all muslims , just these guys `` known '' by security forces . 
  everyone needs to be protected from this kind of mental behavior . 
  yes bitch !, 
  the week serbia said `` no more '', 
  couple of articles and images ( in serbian tho ) about threats to people with their jobs if they do n't give a vote to sns candidate : http://www.danas.rs/izbori.1180.html?news_id=342278&amp;title=%26quot%3btra\u017eili+im+da+potpi\u0161u+glas+za+vu\u010di\u0107a%26quot%3b sixth day of protests in belgrade and all over serbia against the election results ( today with the military and police unions joining students and other citizens ) numbering 80 000 people according to reports ( https://www.face book.com/digitalnarevolucijasrbija/posts/197703374066796 ) protest u beogradu - vojni i policijski sindikat i gra\u0111ani http://rs.n1info.com/a240789/foto/protest-u-beogradu-vojni-i-policijski-sindikat-i-gradjani.html counter protest today in novi sad . 
  numbering 8 ( eight ) people , you can count for yourself : na kontraprotest u novom sadu do\u0161lo osmoro ljudi http://rs.n1info.com/a240806/vesti/vesti/kontraprotest-u-novom-sadu.html a sign from the protest after the msm `` reported '' the protesters as drunk drug addicts with no jobs . 
  translation ( paraphrased ofc ) : `` your mom is a lazy drunk drug addict '' https://i.imgur.com/prpp3n7.jpg the msm also reported there were maybe 100 protesters , along with the insults . 
  here are pics i myself took on the 2nd day of protests . 
  ( one sign reads `` kid 's , pensioners are with you '' ) https://i.imgur.com/fu7xswi.jpg https://i.imgur.com/oduc8bw.jpg https://i.imgur.com/yg0zddi.jpg https://i.imgur.com/nzpc9kb.jpg there are constantly reports over the facebook group `` protesti protiv diktature 2017 '' of infiltrators trying to cause ruckuss , start fights , break windows . 
  bots , as we call them , sent by sns , to disrupt and discredit the efforts of citizens for a fair and non-corrupt government and elections . 
  if you want to research more go to noizz , n1 news , danas online newspaper , http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/ . 
  the msm of europe or serbia wo n't talk about this ... 
  the eu is a good idea , the execution is horrible, 
  was refering to the comments and the eu in general not the post itself per s\u00e9, 
  yes , and the eu could grumble on about how we are n't pulling our weight from their ever high horse ... 
  vote how ??? 
  there was no referendum and even if there was , sns has a monopoly on voting with controlled media , threats to people ( if you get a job through them you have to vote ( they check ) or you 're fired , and the poor get their social checks cut ) , and giving sandwiches and 1000rsd ( $ 10 ) to the poorest for a vote . 
  i did vote in the pres election but again , monopoly . 
  that 's just one of the reasons why we 're not ready to join but of course since vu\u010di\u0107 is pro-eu the eu officials do n't care about corruption ... 
  microstates have low populations and thriving economies . 
  it 's not about having tons of people , it 's about what those people do ... 
  how did you get that from what i said ? 
  yes , education is important , but skilled workers are just as valuable . 
  you can have 100 engineers but if you do n't have techs the factory does n't run . 
  i 'm saying we should deal with the problems first then join . 
  and we have a lot of work to do ... 
  yeah i agree spending tax money on propaganda is n't the way to go . 
  but the eu would never listen to hungary 's requests or ideas . 
  130 new pillow laws are more important ( brexit joke * ba dum tshh * ), 
  i believe in quality over quantity . 
  30k highly educated serbs leave for the eu ( mostly germany , austria and switzerland ( i know not the eu but it might as well be the eu ) . 
  and the serbian government is doing nothing to stop that . 
  our polititians are stealing from taxpayers , making more and more businesses work on black , because they ca n't afford to pay for eu regulations put in place . 
  if serbia is going to be in the eu we need a lot of reform . 
  political , economic , cultural , educational , health-wise . 
  hurling a still developing country into a `` developed coutries club '' is not smart . 
  i 'd love for us to play with the big dogs but i 'm against it because we are n't ready . 
  and playing a puppet show for eu bosses is not smart ( looking at you , greece ), 
  i 'd much rather work for dinars and encourage serbian businesses to be smarter and inovative rather than copy pasting the eu . 
  and vu\u010di\u0107 is in no way a putin puppet . 
  he 's just everyone 's bitch trying to gain political points from an organisation we are n't a part of and countries in which few serbs live . 
  nope ... though i think he is a hilarious character ... 
  i 'm not against a united europe . 
  but the eu right now more than ever is an elitist club which looks down upon anyone who slightly dissagrees ... much as you did just now ... 
  so are we a european team or are we all merkel 's employees ? 
  i 'm not a populist i just do n't agree with the way the eu is run . 
  it should be representative of all it 's members , not just the richest ones ... 
  `` we gave you a train how dare you question anything we do ? '', 
  this kind of authoritarian bullshit from pro-eu people is why i 'm against serbia joining . 
  we ca n't ... this guy has a monopoly on the voting . 
  bribes , threats , media manipulation ... but we also do n't have a trump for our clinton ... it 's all clintons in serbian politics ... 
  vu\u010di\u0107 is a manipulative mini-dictator puppet of the west . 
  our public debt is up 200 % since he got in office . 
  the income tax is 42 fucking percent . 
  salaries are stagnant and medical insuranse is dreadful . 
  we 're basically sending text messages to send kids abroad for treatments . 
  party affiliated employment is at an all time high . 
  emigration is also at an all time high . 
  30k highly educated people leave each year . 
  he won the presidency with elderly people he fooled with his false sence of improvement , threatening people with their jobs and their social checks . 
  also the controlled media which he was on 92 % of the time during the pres election season ( only 10 seconds painted him badly ) . 
  that 's why citizens ( no not drunk and drugged out students , which the media has painted us ) are protesting this unfairness . 
  we want serbia and it 's government to work for the people not for the polititians . 
  for serbia it 's samo sloga srbina spasava ( \u0421\u0430\u043c\u043e \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0430 ) `` only unity saves a serb '' the four c 's on the twoheaded eagle are actually s 's in the cyrilic alphabet . 
  tl ; dr - presidential election sunday . 
  corruption and memes are abbundant . 
  hoping for the best for all our people . 
  best regards to everyone on this thread . 
  the serbian presidential elections are being held today ( the first round anyway ) , and 11 guys are competing . 
  most notable are : - jankovi\u0107 at no1 ( on the balot ) for the democratic party . 
  he 's the 2nd in the polls with about 15 % . 
  i 'm voting for him and hoping he at least gets to the second round . 
  - ljubi\u0161a preleta\u010devi\u0107 beli for no5 . 
  he 's basically a satiric performance of a corrupt serbian politican promising hills and mountains and when he gets to the office delivers nothing and starts stealing from taxpayers . 
  he 's 3rd in the polls with about 12 % . 
  he 's important because his campaign was solely funded by the public and his popularity was due to the internet and mostly very young voters are behind him and going to the polls whereas if not for him they would n't even vote . 
  - vu\u010di\u0107 at the devilish no6 . 
  he 's currently the pm . 
  said he would n't run for pres. 
  whoops . 
  he 's from the `` progressive '' serbian party but is more regressive in my and opinion of many others . 
  always colluding with foreign agents who were responsible for the nato bombing of belgrade in 1999 . 
  he raised the public debt by 150 % , fired all government employees who oppose him and put his people in . 
  he wants us to join the eu but most people agree we 're not ready , politically , economically , socially ... also he 's doing a lot of voter fraud , from his bots taking peoples balots and voting for him without their consent , ordering the national bus agency to drive his supporters ( mostly older folk he buys sandwiches , oil and flour for ) to the polling station , so having people call and text citizens to encourage them to not vote for other candidates . 
  so yeah that 's the situation in serbia this week . 
  should be crni i \u017duti sok for serbia . 
  knjaz milo\u0161 is sparkling water .
