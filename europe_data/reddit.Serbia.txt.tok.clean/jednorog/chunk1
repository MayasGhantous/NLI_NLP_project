presumably / u/embicek just hit the button twice or something by accident . 
  but also , in case you have n't heard , czech and slovak languages are mutually intelligible . 
  it makes very little effort to speak the other language . 
  english is taught in every czech school yet only fraction of people have enough of courage ( and opportunity ) to use it in practice . 
  sorry , i guess we should have been using a less biased source , like maybe rt. . . 
  also , according to russia , they have officially incorporated crimea into the russian federation . 
  which is the definition of of annexation . 
  it 's also being occupied by russian troops , but annexed is more precise . 
  the cases are n't even that hard if you 've taken latin or anything . 
  i 'm trying to get the movement going to call it bcsm . 
  any other takers ? 
  what 's the general public opinion on the new minister of finance ? 
  i 'm curious because he seems vastly underqualified to help run a country . 
  no offense to him or his yale undergrad degree . 
  oh man also `` miting '' ( `` meeting '' ) as a public rally/gathering . 
  one of my friends used to describe good/cool things as `` ekstra . '', 
  i always wondered , `` extra what ? '', 
  until i figured it out . 
  american here , we have `` light '' and `` lite '' beverages , or at least have in the past . 
  croatia 's been really excited lately about joining the eu . 
  i have a feeling they 'll calm down . 
  i do n't think that the two entities could agree to have a single twitter account without un-mediated talks . 
  edit : i was actually joking , but [ here 's the twitter for republika srpska ] ( https://twitter.com/rsrpska ) and [ here 's the one for federacija bih ] ( https://twitter.com/vladafbih ) . 
  the two entities maintain their own accounts , and do n't seem to have a central official one . 
  i can verify that / u/djunta is a good guy to get a beer/several beers with !, 
  / u/whiteguy88 's username betrays him as a white supremacist -- 88 is often neonazi code for hh ( 8th letter ) or heil hitler . 
  / u/whiteguy88 is either a troll or a neonazi ... and in either case not worth responding to . 
  just downvote and move on . 
  keep in mind that many on both sides were forced into the military . 
  it 's entirely possible that this man was himself forced at gunpoint to attack . 
  also keep in mind that he thought he was defending yugoslavia , or at least the serbs in croatia . 
  operation storm ( 1995 ) sorta justified this line of thinking . 
  not saying that serbia 's role in the croatian independence war was okay . 
  just saying that they saw it pretty differently . 
  edit : not really sure what i did to piss off the hivemind , but uh , sorry ? 
  lay off of it , the english was clearly good enough for you to understand . 
  not to contradict nemanyami but there are a few sponsored by foreign ngos . 
  i know of at least one in novi sad that 's run by the mennonite central committee . 
  nemanyami is right that the various governments of serbia have done a piss-poor job of handling ptsd and other war-related trauman . 
  / u/khthon [ seems to be a pretty strong islamophobe ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1bxdfp/serbia_rejects_eubrokered_deal_on_kosovo/c9bahdy ) , not sure whether the portuguese flag is sincere . 
  it 's okay , it seems like he 's not targeting you specifically , just anyone who is n't western/christian enough . 
  just to add on , there 's precedent to what ben_je_gek is hypothesizing . 
  there was a terrorist campaign along the kosovo border in 2001 led by albanian nationalists . 
  you start dividing up kosovo and you 've got ta revisit the borders in all the rest of the balkans . 
  bosnian serbs and croats would each immediately demand to join their respective `` mother '' country , macedonia would fall entirely , montenegro 's statebuilding program would fall apart , hungarians in northern serbia might try to join with their `` mother '' country , presevo valley would start up its terrorist campaign again ... further , if you start changing international borders to fit the current ethnic composition of these lands , you 've justified ethnic cleansing and set a global precedent that all you have to do to `` legally '' acquire lands is kill or kick out all the former inhabitants . 
  the international community 's insistance on keeping to previously established borders , not only in the balkans but worldwide , has probably saved millions of lives overall . 
  my point is n't that either time period is all good or all bad . 
  my point is that nostalgia inherently involves forgetting the bad parts of the past in order to remember it more gloriously than it actually was . 
  and i 'm sure they 're forgetting political oppression and long lines for consumer goods . 
  nostalgia is one of the strongest ideological forces . 
  the `` memory '' of communism is in fact imagination . 
  it 's pure nostalgia -- literally every generation believes that things were better way back when . 
  i agree , so let 's let the croatians in then , eh ? 
  but now you 've got one country being kept out for what two others are allowed to do with impunity . 
  either the uk and france shape up to your standards , or you apply your standards fairly to all member states and allow croatia to join . 
  you 've already named two pretty huge exceptions . 
  on your logic , kick the french and the british out too . 
  some groups of the native population call themselves indians . 
  i do n't think that counts as pejorative . 
  obviously not all do , but the article does an alright job at making that distinction . 
  this is simultaneously sad and hilarious . 
  does `` all of europe '' include non-eu countries ? 
  not that it covers the entire peninsula , but i recommend tim judah 's * the serbs * . 
  he 's the same guy who wrote that article . 
  the other commenters explained the immediate cause for the events in this particular video but i think it 's worth pointing out that this removal and the removal of the monument in presevo are both part of a larger trend . 
  see [ this economist article ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2013/01/war-memorials-balkans ) for more detail . 
  yeah , but the submission has them look more like ukraine . 
  i 'm not from the region myself , but i thought that * the tiger 's wife * by belgrade-born tea obreht was fantastic . 
  she 's an american now , but her style is clearly influenced by andri\u0107 and * the tiger 's wife * feels very much like a piece from the western balkans . 
  i read something about a b92 show from the early 2000s called mile protiv tranzicije . 
  any knowledge of it ? 
  i think that flyingorange meant that 1/3 of serbia 's population as a whole would be non-serb . 
  it 's actually a pretty interesting parallel that he 's found . 
  if you believe in the serbian national mythology , the serbs were defeated by the invading turks on kosovo field in 1389 , which resulted in a serb exodus from kosovo , their homeland at the time . 
  the rhetoric in the 1990s talked of reclaiming this serbian homeland from the albanians , who were fused with the turks in the national imaginary . 
  sounds quite a bit like * the hobbit * if you ask me . 
  now , that does n't excuse calling kosovo albanians orcs . 
  and this sort of comment definitely should n't come from the president of the unga . 
  i find this whole ordeal kinda funny , but i imagine i would n't if i lived in the region . 
  true ... and bosnian and montenegrin while we 're at it . 
  that may be the case in the croatian dialect ( s ) but in serbia there 's an actual difference between \u010d and \u0107 , and between \u0111 and d\u017e . 
  mind you , i ca n't say it myself , since i 'm not a serb , but i can hear it . 
  and serbo-croatian . 
  i 'm not sure , but it looks that way from the map . 
  many montenegrins have dual serbian citizenship . 
  i imagine that the best mathematicians moved to ( / stayed in ) belgrade . 
  look at the huge difference between mne 's and srb 's scores . 
  are you a uk citizen and can you pass a background check ? 
  are you committed to working for the uk government for several years ? 
  it 's not quite as easy as just hiring more people . 
  though obviously this level of language prep is unexcusably low . 
  except by user crnaruka 's posting history it 's pretty clear that ( s ) he 's intentionally using the rs flag to provoke this sort of reaction . 
  sultanahmet square is most certainly in europe by most every definition . 
  i 'm not the same as diegoami , just for the record . 
  i have n't claimed anything except that it 's not really fair to blame serbia for wwi . 
  sorry , but * that 's * just bullshit . 
  the first world war started because of a number of huge systematic problems and geopolitical changes among the great powers of europe . 
  one serb fired one gun , but that has virtually nothing to do with germany invading france . 
  if wwi had n't started in bosnia , it would have started somewhere else . 
  i 'd just like to counter your anecdotes with a few of my own .
