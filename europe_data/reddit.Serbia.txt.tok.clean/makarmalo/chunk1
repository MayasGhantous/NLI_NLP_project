  wtf is movement for serbia ? 
  i fuck his mother again grows . 
  cent/evrocent . 
  serbia . 
  edit : plural - evri , centi , evrocenti . 
  well then you 're separatists as well . 
  except you separate us from * our money * . 
   i 'm not a separatist , but i do n't feel serbia is my homeland . 
  i do n't feel i 'm not part of serbia , i just do n't feel it 's my homeland , i. e. i do n't have a connection to serbia but i have connection to vojvodina , though . 
  i do n't feel like i 'm part of any nationality , because i was never raised as a part of one community . 
  neither were my parents . 
  my maternal grandparents were serbian and rusyn , paternal were german and grandmother , who was hungarian and german . 
  so yeah , i 'm pretty much kazakh . 
  why do you dislike montenegro ? 
  well there are separatists . 
  not many though . 
  i 'm not a separatist , but i do n't feel serbia is my homeland . 
  this is the general opinion in vojvodina . 
  it 's like ... your ex is your room-mate . 
  you do n't like him too much but he 's not that bad . 
  he likes to party ( shooting civilians in neighbouring countries ) and he 's a slob but it 's not that bad that you have to move . 
  netherlands , sea level , hatred . 
  connect the dots yourself . 
  [ here 's mine ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yqhnsyt.png ) edit : kurds - like, 
  so ... you like enver hoxha bunkeri ? 
  no need to turn it to govpissdec , it 's bad enough as it is ( govno - crap ; pizda - pussy ) ... heh ... 
  * raises * fears ?!, 
  i really wish eu reacted to vu\u010di\u0107 's increasing dictatorship . 
  [ this ] ( http://wiwibloggs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/conchita-wurst-sausage0.jpeg ) is clearly european , for instance . 
  for me , something european is something that is clearly from europe and is meant for europe , and above all , it has an obvious european mark or quality ( like the conchita wurst shown above :d ) - sure , you can sell it in namibia and east timor but it loses its point . 
  this , on the other hand , is europe - * based * ; if it had an obvious european quality it would be european for me . 
  i mean it 's european , but so is [ lada ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/lada_niva_1991_brazil.jpg ) and so is erste bank , so i made the distinction between european and europe - * based *, 
   redditor for three days sorry for that , i just assumed you were a promoter of this stuff . 
  but in my opinion , this sub would be pretty depressing if there were promotions of random products and services that are * provided * in europe . 
  i mean , it 's not like hubic is something revolutionary . 
  and it 's not really european , it 's just hosted in europe . 
  is being european-based enough to be promoted on this subreddit , redditor for three days ? 
  budem bio is n't standalone , so it 's not counted as a tense . 
  it 's just called future ii . 
  all of those three are past tenses . 
  it seems serbia 's moved on from its past . 
  oh , thanks . 
  i 'm not really good with tenses in english ; in my native language there are six , three of which are not used . 
  this exists for quite a while , does n't it ? 
  heh , i 'm one of those 1-2 % of vojvodina . 
  we 're pretty rare around here . 
  if you say so . 
  i do n't actually know russian but i speak serbian so i instantly thought of it . 
  i 'm guessing that 's a play on \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0448 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438 ( sorry , do n't have russian keyboard ), 
  the big sign : `` no to war in ukraine '' . 
  they are saying : `` to ukraine : peace . 
  to russia : freedom '', 
  i guess vojvodina hungarians who want to secede would be pretty disappointed here :d, 
  whoosh e : wow , all the downvotes , now look at oc 's user name . 
  i just hope it does n't become rostock-2014 . 
  in 2016 , i think . 
  because of some anniversary , i think . 
  sorry , never mind . 
  i thought you said '' the sun * is * a star `` edit : wait , what ? 
  this does n't make any sense . 
   the sun is n't a star . 
  i do n't know much about rts ( radio-television of serbia ) but my regional television ( rtv , radio-television of vojvodina ) often broadcasts italian , french , danish and swedish serials and all are subbed . 
  on the other hand , documentaries are usually dubbed . 
   there 's not exactly anything to dub other than anime . 
  you never watch foreign content ( except anime ) ? 
  to be honest , i had no idea that dubbing is so common in the rest of europe . 
  in serbia we never dub anything . 
  ` ip ` ip ` uraaaaaaaaaa, 
  hey , what 's that freckle on renzi 's face ? 
  oh , it 's [ this ] ( http://www.dumpaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/funny-pope-pictures-13.jpg ), 
  no , office will die before him . 
  i wish i lived in estonia . 
  vu\u010di\u0107 has a mouth full of kosovo . 
  your stance on this is way too simple . 
  trust me . 
   basically a mafia state that 's true . 
   it looks like serbian have a part of their land kidnapped by albanian mafia it 's our fault . 
   if albanian in kosovo did n't want to be in serbia , they should have gone to albania instead of declare independence . 
  also our fault . 
  if we treated them properly , they would n't have a reason to declare independence . 
  and if you do n't agree with a country 's policies , you should n't move out , you should change them . 
  but if you 're treated like junk and penniless and illiterate , you ca n't do much . 
  i am generally against all these independences , but kosovo has been repressed by us in the past , so i have to say i 'm fine with it , as long as it does n't create a nationalist paradise . 
  i 'm generally against these independences because i believe countries should n't be based on nation or religion like many today are . 
  us definitely * is * a very important ally , however , a natural ally does not spy on its natural allies . 
  i know , i know . 
  when did i say i was exact ? 
  and the british speak english because of the invasion which happened 950 years ago . 
  checkmate . 
  not true in serbia . 
  ottoman , austro-hungarian ( not really , but had a lot of problems with insurgencies ) . 
  in serbian `` milujem te '' means `` i caress you '' and `` ljubim te '' means `` i kiss you '' . 
  hahaha i thought the same :d, 
  hahahaha on what planet is britain , remind me again ? 
  gib ~ ~ monies ~ ~ pathetic subsidies plox, 
   my proposed treatment of the russian is not so much fueled by dislike of said russian , but more by the survival of the european . 
   if i could move russians to a different geographical location where they could continue to exist in whichever way they desired , i 'd much prefer that and hope for them all the happiness in the world , but alas it is not possible , hence the annihilation . 
  that 's very ... european ?
