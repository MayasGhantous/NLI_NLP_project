in that case , catalonia may end up in a limbo , regarding the un and international relationships , just as kosovo , if they do not get the blessing of the country they are seccesing from . 
  it has not been recognised just because of the fact that spain has a problem with catalonia . 
  anyway , there is no international law which forbids seccession , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  it was legal in kosovo case . 
  but , that 's just a special case made for non-eu states , i guess . 
  can confirm , parent is lazy . 
  i have explained that serbia is n't responsible for wwi ** and ** that the comment made by / u/catenamundi is false . 
  if someone with a same flair as me makes a comment about something , it does n't mean that i think the same . 
  again , what irony ? 
  edit : i 've just looked at your comment history . 
  dude ... 
  what irony ? 
  maybe it was but i 've encountered a lot of people who think that serbia really was responsible for wwi . 
  i just try to do my part in educating others . 
  i understand that you got insulted but you should n't allow your emotions to make you tell things that simply are n't true . 
   so was his own country - partially responsible for starting ww1 gavrilo princip was born in [ obljaj ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/obljaj ) ( today that 's muslim part of bosnia and herzegovina ) which makes him a citizen of austro-hungary . 
  a citizen of austro-hungary kills an austro-hungarian archduke , in austro-hungary . 
  and serbia is partially responsible . 
  by defending itself and by not surrendering immideately , after receiving it 's ultimatum , i pressume ? 
  pure insults are not an opionion . 
  actually , no . 
  austro-hungary started the war and as a reason for that they stated that serbia was responsible for killing archduke although yugoslav nationalist princip did that on his own . 
  every historian knows that that was n't the real reason . 
  tension betwen austro-hungary and serbia existed before and austro-hungary looked into attacking serbia since serbia won independence from the ottoman empire . 
  also , your comment bellow is a spot on . 
  my countryman comment is disgraceful . 
  it was a joke . 
  jeez . 
  highly unlikely . 
  why ? 
  simple . 
  they do n't want to stay where . 
  they want to go to germany and to sweden . 
  i say , good luck to them . 
  we have enough problems of our own anyways . 
  get back for another round . 
  nah , it 's the truth . 
  when we are n't united . . well , you can see today what is happening . 
  it 's not legal .

   serbian ** raid ** ical party nice translation op . 
   democratic party - serious contender . 
  pro-eu , somewhat liberal , has some decent politicians , has corrupt bastards . 
  not really . 
  democratic party was essentially disolved after losing last elections from the progressive party . 
   so i 'm guessing the next parliament will be pretty pro-european ? 
  all of them since 2000 ~ ~ where ~ ~ were pro-european . 
  nothing new . 
   [ . . ] when only one side was allowed to speak , it was rushed , and it was conducted at gunpoint after an invasion . 
  seriously enough , are there any links where i can see that this really happened ? 
  i 'm truly interested to see . 
  could you , please , provide me that ? 
  i 'm unable to find anything on google . 
   there is a huge difference between the referendum in scotland and the one in crimea . 
  that is correct . 
  but what about the referendum in kosovo ? 
  what 's the difference there ? 
  but there is . 
  you just need to post me some link where there are evidence that crimeans did n't want to seccede from ukraine . 
  i 'm not upset . 
  i 'm entertained that noone in the whole thread linked me any article where there are information that crimeans did n't want to seccede . 
  more so that my honest question is downvoted to hell . 
  you have replied to my comment in which i have asked for move evidence with `` that is completely irrelevant '' . 
  i have asked for more evidence . 
  asking for a more evidence about something someone told is irrelevant ? 
  that does n't really answer my question . 
   supposedly because crimea wanted to separate from ukraine i did n't really follow the crimea situation properly but i have heard that the majority of people in crimea are russian and that they wanted to seccede . 
  are those facts not true ? 
  can you link me some contrarian arguments ? 
  thanks . 
  these pictures are wonderful . 
  pictures from the yugoslavian kingdom are very interesting ( and not so much discussed and posted , in contrast to the pictures from the communist yugoslavia ) . 
  your comment does n't really encourage the discussion about the article . 
  sorry neighbours . 
  on the bright side , you 'll have more than enough chapters where you can block us . 
  really ? 
  interesting . 
  he may have flaired after / u/berzelus made his comment . 
  first ever serbian state 's name ( [ duklja ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbia_in_the_middle_ages#early_middle_ages ) , 1040 . ), 
  is n't used anymore if i 'm not mistaken so we could use that . 
  or use the name of the second state called rashka/rascia so we could trigger / r/europe ( because rashka sounds similar to russia ) . 
  first thought : `` this user runs outdated browser , sigh ... '' . 
  second thought : `` ah , a joke !, 
  haha . 
  history . 
  do you even ? 
  proof that learning from history and not repeating it should be taken seriously . 
   there 's no applicable situation to use `` yckpc '' term as there are no people who would celebrate the holiday under that name and who would in the same time use the cyrillic alphabet . 
  i still ca n't follow you . 
  serbs do celebrate ~ ~ christmas ~ ~ easter and they do call it uskrs and vaskrs . 
   that 's opposite to `` vaskrs '' as no matter official alphabet of serb orthodox has been cyrillic , the usual alphabet of orthodox in croatia has been latin so both `` backpc '' and `` vaskrs '' surely are taking place . 
  official scripts for serbian are both cyrillic and latin . 
  does n't really matter what religion you are . 
  serbs use both . 
  edit : brainfart . 
   nobody uses `` yckpc '' - as contrary to `` vaskrs '' as the latin alphabet has been used by orthodox serbs . 
  [ what ] ( https://translate.google.com/#sr/hr/%d1%83%d1%81%d0%ba%d1%80%d1%81 ) ? 
  there was a poll 5 months ago about / r/europe visitors . 
  half of the visitors are americans .
