  after them , most visitors are from germany . 
  you should n't really be surprised . 
  it took you that long to forsee that ? 
  did you really beleive that we stood a chance again military union of all western states ? 
  sounds like kusturica took inspiration from real life . 
   bringing former adversaries together and coming to a comprehensive lasting peace requires concessions to both sides , it will happen eventually . 
  look at france and germany . 
  it took them 70 years . 
  [ a language is a dialect with an army and navy . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_language_is_a_dialect_with_an_army_and_navy ) , 
  i understood this . 
  / me silently adds macedonian to his linkedin . 
  i think i 've linked to you a link to a movie where you can hear southern accent spoken ( rarely now but more often in the past ) around ni\u0161 . 
  although i can understand it , i ca n't understand macedonian very well . 
  [ that 's why ] ( https://youtu.be/joqfi8cg6d0?t=3102 ) . 
  how understandable is it for you ? 
  edit : you may want to skip to relevant parts . 
  tl ; dr : southeastern accent is like a transition language betwen croatian/serbian and macedonian/bulgarian . 
   serbia and montenegro are closer to macedonia so possibly they understand macedonian much better not really . 
  macedonian and slovenian are very different from our `` different '' serbian/montenegrian/bosnian / croatian languages ... 
  yep . 
  i also think that all the other slavic languages could adopt our system of using one letter for one voice and writing/reading as it is spoken/written without much hassle . 
  they could even choose the script since our cyrillic variant has direct equivalent chars in the latin variant . 
  well , that 's not really the case when using latin . 
   you pronounce one voice ( d\u017e ) yet you use two letters to describe it which is a bit weird . 
  where when using cyrillic there 's a single letter \u045f for this voice . 
  to bad latin script does n't have one letter for nj , lj , and d\u017e as does the cyrillic one have . 
   i 'm not fighting it , but latin alphabet is very logical why ? 
  i do actually consider it more complex than the ( serbian ) cyrillic because latin has more letters if we count them by their shapes ( uppercase and lowercases ones ) . 
  where for cyrillic letters uppercase and lowercase is determined by it 's size , not shape . 
  a quick example : latin -  cyrillic k k -  \u041a \u043a m m -  \u041c \u043c l l -  \u041b \u043b g g -  \u0413 \u0433 granted , there are uppercase/lowercase pairs of cyrillic letters that are different in shape but the number of those is much smaller than the number of those in the latin alphabet . 
  what i would argue is that the latin alphabet is very ** practical ** in this era due to english having the lingua franca status in the world . 
  \u010c is pronounced as in ** ch ** ina ( in english ) and \u0106 is pronounced as ** c ** iao ( in italian ) . 
  they are * quite * different sounds . 
  i think you overestimate how many people heard about them . 
   i find it interesting when english commentators just refuse to pronounce \u0107 at the end of our names as if they 're hearing it for the first time i do not think it 's refusal but they simply do not know how to pronounce it . 
  we have one macedonian in my company who always uses \u010d when there 's \u0107 . 
  it 's hillarious . 
  fine by me , if you ask me . 
  sorry bulgaria , it 's for the greater good . / s, 
   and the balkans and ee was under water at that time . 
  so that 's why our government is building belgrade waterfront ( belgrade on water , on serbian ) . 
  read that as name.js for some reason ... 
  there would be no uss balkan . 
  only [ battlestar balkanika ] ( http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/m3it2ywzteicfojkcyni.jpg ) . 
  beaten up but still a fine ship . 
  european union is just a beggining . 
  soon , we will unite the whole world . 
  except turkey . 
   on the other hand , your national press agency is still called tanjug ( telegraphic agency of the new yugoslavia ) . 
  are there any plans to change that name too ? 
  that agency has been [ shut down ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/serbia-media-idusl8n12z2kn20151104 ) . 
  yet , it still works . 
  such is life in serbia . 
  the new name was long overdue . 
  yugoslavian avio transport was getting a bit weird ... 
  did n't you know that `` where the serbian graves are , that 's where the serbian land is '' . 
   gavrilo was strictly speaking also not a serb , but a bosnian serb . 
  gavrilo considered himself a yugoslav and everything he did was to `` unite all brotherly yugoslav nations into one state '' . 
  first recorded case of a vampire was in serbia . 
  it was recorded by some austrian officer . 
  edit :  after austria gained control of northern serbia and oltenia with the treaty of passarowitz in 1718 , officials noted the local practice of exhuming bodies and `` killing vampires '' . 
  [ 5 ] these reports , prepared between 1725 and 1732 , received widespread publicity . 
  [ 5 ] the english term was derived ( possibly via french vampyre ) from the german vampir , in turn derived in the early 18th century from the serbian vampir ( cyrillic : \u0432\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0438\u0440 ) , [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] when arnold paole , a purported vampire in serbia was described during the time when northern serbia was part of the austrian empire . 
  just because some obviously pro-russia people protested does n't mean we all love russia ... 
   what is the serbian alternative to kosovo ? 
  lets say kosovo je srbjia , then what would happen the albanian population there ? 
  they obviously have zero desire to live under serbs , nothing would happen to the albanians . 
  they would continue to live there as they lived in yugoslavia . 
  economic aid would be given to kosovo as it was in yugoslavia . 
  greater autonomy ( which would be on the level of almost having an independence ) and benefits of having a better economy because of the faster asscension to the eu and having less corrupt politicians . 
   they obviously have zero desire to live under serbs , why under ? 
  albanians would represent a significant political party ( a third of the population of serbia are albanians , if we count kosovo ) in serbian parliament . 
  it 's not under but beside . 
   the two populations have a monumental hatred of one another , i do not know how the feelings towards serbs are in kosovo and albania but here people do not hate albanians as much . 
  hell , i even buy weekly sweets from an ethnic albanian who lives here . 
  because unstable borders cause wars and destabilize economies . 
  i would rather have stable borders and more open and easy trading betwen countries ( a la eu ) than everyday map changes . 
   i heard that bosniaks used to refer to serbs as vlachs . 
  as an insult , yes . 
   to appease whoever . 
  maybe a certain country who has a military base there . 
  just a speculation . 
  yea , just start trading territories like it 's a civ game . 
  just this time . 
  that will go well and noone will start getting silly ideas in the future . 
  i am not even sure that there are vlachs in bih . 
  a noticable percentage of vlachs are located in eastern serbia , not bih . 
  yea , custom compiling to get more speed from your hardware was very nice in 2005 . 
  nowdays , you wo n't notice it . 
  just do n't forget to give him 1l of rakija every day and a roasted pig from time to time ... 
  you mean '' ** \u010c ** etvrtak '' ? 
  typo perhaps ? 
  this article creeped me out . 
  it 's too familliar ... 
  you should be . 
  things do not bode well in europe . 
  just see how much pesimism is on the first page of this subreddit . 
  sadly , our state is just started to recover economically and i do not think it will have time to recover and strengthen in time before something major . 
  if by gorad you mean grad / \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 ( city ) then yes .
