   moldovan 75.8 % majority . 
   ukrainian 8.4 % , russian 5.9 % , gagauz 4.4 % , romanian 2.2 % , bulgarian 1.9 % , other 1 % , unspecified 0.4 % minorities . 
  for programmers , it 's easy . 
  bad programmers can be spotted relatively quickly . 
  well , it 's kinda hard to work `` towards further integration between the countries '' when you were in a war not long ago where you were disintegrating from each other . 
  but i understand what you want to say . 
  in time ... 
  my guesstimate is 50 years . 
  until the generations , who were babies during the wars , do n't start dying . 
  that fact gives me hope for the balkans . 
  if you guys managed to start doing your business peacefully , sure we will manage to have such relations . 
  your language is truly diverse . 
  turks [ want to invade ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/41ifrf/what_if_the_largest_countries_had_the_biggest/cz2tpai ) again . 
  probably will need to form centraloslavia . 
  maybe later . 
   netherlands , sweden niiice ...  bulgaria , albania , croatia , montenegro you blew it op . 
  both latin and cyrillic scripts were derived from the greek alphabet . 
  that 's actually a good thing . 
  because we serbs know both cyrillic and latin , i kinda can read it without much trouble . 
  names ending with slav ( glory ) and ljub ( to love , kiss ) are slavic in nature and they are common in serbia . 
  it really is funny to think of an atheist called bogoljub ( the one who loves god ) . 
  do n't assume that . 
  he may also be croato-serbian . 
  may you live 1000 years . 
  germany : [ ~ 5 million ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_casualties#holocaust_deaths ) . 
  belgium : [ one million to fifteen million ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopold_ii_of_belgium#exploitation.2c_atrocities.2c_and_death_toll ) . 
  serbia : [ 8 thousands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnian_genocide ) and [ 25 thousands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_albanians_in_the_balkan_wars ) . 
  croatia : [ 320 thousands to 340 thousands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_persecution_of_serbs ) . 
  bulgaria : [ 2 thousands ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surdulica_massacre ) . 
  ** note ** that these numbers are probably ** quite off the mark ** because it 's hard to calculate all the loses . 
  what is certain is that western europe is better in genocides . 
  and in everything else . 
  by issuing fines . 
  nothing scares a serb more than a promaja and a fine . 
  excellent . 
  in serbian spokoj / \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0458 means serenity . 
  there is also a word pokojnik / \u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0458\u043d\u0438\u043a which is used to mark someone who died . 
  peace is mir / \u043c\u0438\u0440 . 
  simillarities between slavic languages are quite interesting . 
  ah , glorious serbo-croato-bosnio-montenegrian language . 
  and a hell of a lot harder to acquire . 
  yugoslavia is a flat circle . 
  was there even a doubt ? 
  please , do yourself a favor [ and read this wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnia_and_herzegovina#demographics ) first . 
  not everyone in bosnia is bosnian . 
  a third of population of bosnia are serbs . 
   how can kosova be serbian while we were all under ottoman rule . 
  because serbian built their cities and monasteries there . 
  also , it was under serbian governance always except during the ottoman occupation . 
   you mean like b92.com or some other serbian propaganda website ? 
  nope . 
  i mean wikipedia . 
   also on 2 july , 114 ethnic albanian delegates of the 180-member kosovo assembly declared kosovo an independent republic within yugoslavia . 
  [ 90 ] [ 88 ] on 5 july the serbian assembly dissolved the kosovo assembly . 
  [ 90 ] [ 88 ] serbia also dissolved the provincial executive council and assumed full and direct control of the province . 
  [ 93 ] serbia took over management of kosovo 's principal albanian-language media , halting albanian-language broadcasts . 
  [ 93 ] of course it was dissassembled when you decided to unilaterally declare independence inside another country . 
  you were directly violating the constitution of the country you lived in . 
  what was supposed to happen ? 
  just allow you to brake off like that ? 
   it 's not about syntax nor grammar . 
  it 's about arrogance . 
  you had the nerve to insult my english and then repeatedly misspell the word `` hypothetical '' . 
  there 's a famous english saying for what you 've done : no , it 's about the meaning , as i 've already said . 
  you intentionally take my words out of context to serve your illusion better . 
  i 've first assumed you made an error while reading but i see now that you intentionally do that . 
   do you really think the eu or us gives a fuck about igniting a conflict between us ? 
  if us means kosovo and serbia , then yes . 
  eu wants stability in this region and us wants kosovo as it is today because they have a military base there . 
   we 're a member of nato and a lot closer to eu than you guys so i do n't think either of them will be defending you . 
  what does that have to have with kosovo ? 
  also , why would they defend us and from who ? 
  who 's closer to the eu is debatable , i will leave that to the future . 
  eu and us wo n't allow the alliance betwen kosovo and albania except when the two countries joint the eu . 
  but when that happens , we all will be in the eu and we will all be a big happy family . 
  serbia has had control of kosova for a grand total of 3 centuries since dardania was first mentioned by king bardylis in 4th century bce . 
  much more that the albanians . 
  any source that says something you do n't like is biased . 
  nope . 
  i accept wikipedia as the valid source . 
  english is not your strong suit . 
  again ? 
  dude , give it a rest . 
  you tried taking my words out of context and you were being willfully ignorant . 
  the downfall of yugoslavia was serbian arrogance and i 'm glad to see it 's still alive and well . 
  blaming one nation for the downfall of yugoslavia is ridiculous . 
  it 's not that simple . 
  the downfall of yugoslavia was largely the result of corrupt politicians without a vision and the collapsing economy that followed . 
  instead of making people cooperate and live together , side by side and improve economy , politicians from every nation in yugoslavia decided to grab more power , more money to themselves and make people hate each other . 
  hell , politicians in the croatia and kosovo today still win elections based on the amount of hatred expressed towards serbs during the election period . 
  but that wo n't last for long . 
  hatred does n't feed hungry mouths . 
   if you did you would know this was the real albanian state declared in 1912 : you are aware that the kosovo was the part of serbia since the late 12th century ? 
   http://www.refworld.org/docid/469f38f51e.html here is what it says :  [ after the constitutional changes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_kosovo#the_1990s ) , the parliaments of all yugoslavian republics and provinces , which until then had mps only from the communist party of yugoslavia , were dissolved and multi-party elections were held for them . 
  kosovo albanians ** refused to participate in the elections and held their own ** , unsanctioned elections instead . 
  as election laws required turnout higher than 50 % , the parliament of kosovo could not be established . 
  find a better source . 
   again i just want to reiterate that it 's no surprise a union consisting of 5-6 countries all backed by the soviet union those countries were also backed by the us . 
   followed by this trying to correct me for correcting you : it 's not about the syntax but about the meaning of the words . 
  you are unable to understand my words or you are not willing to understand me because you know that you are wrong and you need to take the words out of the context ( probably later because of the following ) .
