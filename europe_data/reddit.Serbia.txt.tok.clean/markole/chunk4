   at least you know who you belong with  i 've wrote `` we and gypsies and any other who are not albanians '' which means any other minorities . 
  but it 's hard to argue when you know that what i 've said it 's the truth ( no minority rights in kosovo ) so it 's easier to insult . 
   could not care less hahaha , keep on dreaming . 
  us and eu would never allow this to happen because this would just ignite more confilct . 
  kosovo and metohija will have alliance with albania only when they both join the eu . 
  but , this means that kosovo and serbia will also have the same alliance in eu . 
  $ user ! = everyone else . 
   and ? 
  you were intrigued why serb minorities expect such strong rights in kosovo , in a land which was historically theirs . 
   actually , the language was banned from school and they were n't allowed seats in parliament despite being a vast majority . 
  source ? 
   so so far you 've told me how much you value the rights of dead serbs over living albanians i value the right of the living serbs , not the dead ones . 
  i do not understand how you were able to even understand it in a way simillar to this . 
  maybe english is n't so well taught in albania . 
   congrats a super state consisting of multiple nations had higher living standards than that era 's version of north korea . 
  the fact that the living standards were so much higher yet everyone left the union should tell you enough about how little rights `` minorities '' had . 
  yet those minorities had a better living standard than in their own homeland , at a time . 
  interesting . 
   * hypothetical yep , hypotetical . 
  you made a hypotetical situation about germans , englishmen and frenchmen . 
   i think the parallel was along the fact that when you try to ethnically cleanse entire groups of people do n't expect any sympathy or start demanding rights . 
  the fact that you guys are still allowed in kosova is a privilege not a right , do n't take it for granted . 
  yep , we and gypsies and any other who are not albanians . 
  such rights in kosovo . 
  in the end , it does n't matter . 
  you government will have to obey the international deals it made or your semistate will suffer in terms of accession to the eu . 
  it 's too bad that the world is still in a point of history where there are sides . 
  if only we were able to put our differences aside and start working onto something greater ( such as getting some people from this rock to some other rock , preferably a neighbouring red one ) , that would be so nice . 
  moving away from serbia and to join west ? 
  you are aware that serbia is [ soon opening ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=27&amp;nav_id=96192 ) the first two chapters in eu accession negotiations ? 
   sudo sh - c ` echo `` $ user all = nopasswd : / path/to/wash _ hands.sh ''   / etc/sudoers ' it 's not that hard ... 
   i do n't understand how serb minorities honestly are expecting such strong rights in kosovo . 
  we expect them because of our cultural heritage in kosovo and metohija . 
  a lot of our churches and monasteries . 
  our emperor dusan is buried there , among other our kings . 
   you guys did n't give the majority kosovar albanians any of these same rights during the yugoslav era . 
  that 's false . 
  kosovo and metohija gained autonomy in yugoslavia , in 1963 . 
  also , albanians in kosovo enjoyed much greater living standard than albanians in albania , during the yugoslav era . 
   furthermore , serb minorities do n't deserve these rights unless the albanian minorities in serbia get the exact same ones . 
  albanian minorities already enjoy all the rights all other minorities in serbia enjoy . 
  and those rights are much , much greater than those provided to minorities in kosovo . 
   this is like germans crying to the french and english in the 50/60 's as to why their minorities are n't being protected ... 
  except there is no parallel to be made there because french and english living in one part of germany did n't decide to declare independence , burn down german churches and expel majority of german population living in said , hypotetical part of germany .

  you can see turkmen rebels celebrating over the dead body of one pilot and then you can see them firing at the other pilot while he was parachuting down . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the other guy is dead also . 
  next you can see how rebels blew up a russian rescue helicopter . 
  i have never spinned facts that milosevic did n't commit genocide . 
  i have just disputed the parent who said how milosevic was convicted for commiting genocide in the hague trial . 
  i did n't say that . 
  do you posses basic reading comprenhension ? 
  srebrenica genocide has nothing to do with the start of nato bombing . 
  please , follow the thread properly . 
  how am i defending the genocide by stating the facts ? 
  both sides did hideous things . 
  that 's war for you . 
  i just hope that the future will be better . 
   technically milosevic was n't convinced of anything because he died before the end of the trial . 
  then why do you go around and tell people how he was convicted of genocide ? 
  that * technicallity * is a pretty big thing . 
   however he was being tried for the genocide , and for all intents and purposes , he would have been found guilty if not for his death . 
  you and i do not know how that process would end . 
   pretending that it did n't happen , purely on this technicality , is disgusting and an insult to the thousands who died . 
  stating the facts is disgusting ? 
  no , it 's not . 
  we both know that milosevic regime did terrible things but you do not need to outright lie about the facts to express that . 
  my brave leader ? 
  i was a child during the milosevic regime . 
  please , do not assume things . 
  also , milosevic was n't convicted for genocide at the hague . 
  edit : the parent changed his post . 
  he wrote how milosevic was convicted at the hague for genocide and i replied to that , false , fact . 
  those things were done by bosnian serb forces , not by the official serbian military . 
  that does not make it right but nato did n't bomb serbia because of that . 
  why ca n't i find any information about said `` little genocide '' on wikipedia ? 
  really ? 
  why ca n't i find any information about supposed genocide ? 
  nothing on wikipedia ... 
  loled irl . 
  username checks out . 
  there is this little thing called vpns . 
  edit : it seems that turkey 's blocking is at the dns level . 
  if that 's the case , then you just simply need to point your device to use some other , non-turkey , dns server ( such as google 's dns servers located at `` ` 8.8.8.8 `` ` and `` ` 8.8.4.4 `` ` ) . 
  what does syria have to do with africa ? 
  at least , you do n't need to construct additional pylo \\ ^ wtowers . 
  i agree . 
  the survey is biased . 
  although i mostly drink beer and coffee , not mentioning \u0448\u0459\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0446\u0430 is just mean . 
  so sad ... yea kid , you * won * . 
  whatever makes you feel better . 
  also , it would n't hurt to visit a library or read a history book . 
   first you say that you ca n't have a factual opinion on anything that happened more than 50 years ago ahahaha . 
  i ca n't beleive it . 
  no , i 've said that you ca n't have factual opinion on anything that happened * in less * than 50 years ago . 
  that means the last 50 years . 
  not anything before last 50 years . 
  you should study english language more . 
  i 've just had a look at your comment history to see if you are really a troll or just ignorant . 
  i see that you are a turk living in sweden .
