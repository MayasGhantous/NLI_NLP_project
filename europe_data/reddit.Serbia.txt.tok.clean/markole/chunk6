  he deserves a subreddit of his own . 
  :d edit : holy cow , [ it exists ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/tomadiploma ) !, 
   well , the whole veto thing was useless since they just went ahead and voted it in the european parliament . 
  i guess that depends though , how much you value europe and the us compared to china and russia . 
  i forgot about the eu parliament . 
  :( i value slighly more un than eu . 
  also , i think that having china as an ally may be even more beneficial than having russia or eu on our side . 
  do you consider vetoing of resolutions in un that do not benefit us and supporting us in not recongising kosovo as `` not doing to much '' ? 
  i agree about the gas project and about the 90s . 
  but it 's not like greece and romania did greater things for serbia than russia , in last 100 years . 
  you forgot largest one , russia . 
  also , china is quite friendly . 
  yea , i saw that . 
  i did n't really give any signifance to it . 
  but he did live to his name , until he deleted his comments . 
  heh , at least [ the defacing of three us government ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/tech/computing/9905/10/hack.attack.02/index.html?_s=pm:tech ) websites afterwards was fun . 
   organisation which bombed and killed our citizens does not mean  nato bombing is the same as armenian genocide how many times do i have to repeat myself ? 
  i am ** not ** comparing the number of killed in nato bombing of yugoslavia to a armenian genocide . 
  i am saying that a lot of people in serbia ** would feel like ** the armenians would feel if they started joining turkish army , if the serbia joined nato . 
  that is , very sad . 
  a lot of civilian objects were hit `` due to outdates maps '' , sadly . 
  the building of radio television of serbia was [ hit by a nato bomb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nato_bombing_of_the_radio_television_of_serbia_headquarters ) . 
  sixteen people died . 
  although the place was used for spreading milosevic 's propaganda , i have mixed feelings about killing civillians . 
  well , war is an ugly thing . 
  in war , there is n't a good side . 
   ** join ** an organisation which bombed and killed our citizens ? 
  ... that 's like asking armenians to ** join ** turkish army . 
  is not the same as  bombing of serbia by nato is the same as turkish genocide on armenians . 
  go back to blic.rs if you wish to troll . 
  first of all , you should n't insult me . 
  second , i do not compare bombing with the genocide . 
  i am comapring the feeling of joining an organisation which killed a lot of my citizens to a something that would an armenian feel if he joined a turkish army . 
  and that is how a majority of people would feel if serbia would join nato . 
  as if armenians were joining turkish army . 
  it 's a very sensitive thing . 
  join an organisation which bombed and killed our citizens ? 
  yea , excellent idea ... that 's like asking armenians to join turkish army . 
  i agree that it was ilegal for me because i am from serbia and because my constitution says so . 
  it may be the same case with spanish constitution . 
  international law does n't say that seccesion is illegal , sadly . 
   the adoption of the declaration of independence of the 17 february 2008 did not violate general international law because international law contains no ` prohibition on declarations of independence ^ [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_court_of_justice_advisory_opinion_on_kosovo's_declaration_of_independence ) . 
  serbia is n't so much an ally to putin as it is to russia . 
  putin is just current president . 
  serbia is an ally for russia because of the historical reasons , long before putin . 
  but , i agree . 
  us , uk and many other western states were prompt in recognising kosovo as a mean of futher weaking serbia because it was a center of power in former communist yugoslavia . 
   we did n't enter in that match because it 's illegal . 
  maybe . 
  i 'm a bit sceptical that that would be a case if it was n't for catalonia . 
  i think that spain would fall under pressure of other western allies , to recognise kosovo , if it was n't for catalonia . 
  anyway , i 'm grateful to your government for honouring my country . 
  [ here 's a `` short '' list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_united_states_military_operations ) . 
  those damn rebels fighting for freedom ... 
  i think that half a year ago someone posted here a link to a neonazi looking forum where forum members talked about `` raising awarness '' ( read as spreading hate without facts ) on many european `` liberal '' forums such as tihs one . 
  serbia holds the drills with nato all the time but that does n't `` sell the news papers '' so you do n't see it that much in the news media . 
  holy crap , i understood like 90 % of it !, 
  interesting how he is pronouncing sounds the same way a serbian would pronounce them . 
  can you please write it in english . 
   i can not understand why serbs started using latin alphabet . 
  communist yugoslavia is one reason ( to make us and croats closer ) , the second one is the internet and computers where it would be easier to use latin alphabet for communication and that 's mostly because of the third reason which is very bad education in serbia regarding the usage of cyrillic on computers because no one cares enough . 
  btw , i agree that cyrillic is prettier . 
  \u0413\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438 / grozni means ghastly in serbian . 
  works fine on my end . 
  try [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/doe40et.jpg ) instead . 
  i hope well arrive to a `` star trek '' reality where money does n't exist anymore and people work to self-improve , learn and create . 
  can this really be called a cartoon and attributed when he only used an [ existing picture ] ( https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%94%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%be%d1%82%d0%b5%d0%ba%d0%b0:seoba_srba.jpg ) and added an wired fence over it ? 
  yea , that 's a crappy ssd . 
  it should handle 500/500mb without a hitch . 
  novi sad or neo planta . 
  novi means new in serbian . 
  that make sense but i was n't sure about the planting part . 
  nice to have an confirmation . 
  also , i did n't see his flag so i thought i was talking to a foreigner . 
  sad / \u0421\u0430\u0434 can also be translated as something into which you plant ( \u0441\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0438 / saditi - to plant something ) . 
  edit : i responded from the `` received messages '' page so i did n't see the flag so my explanation seems pointless now . 
  mileva maric einstein was born in titel but she [ did spent time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mileva_mari%c4%87#biography ) in novi sad also . 
  i would be satisfied even with herceg novi winning . 
  i enjoy herceg novi every summer . 
  both cities are great . 
  yea , create an union inside the union . 
  many auto-correct systems learn from the messages user writes so if bordel means in polish what it means in serbian , probably the user has a kinky mind . 
   the eu is not europe . 
  yet every map that lists an x thing in europe does n't have my country on it because op thought eu when writing europe . 
  how much tuna did you eat ? 
  sadly , no . 
  i hope that the ownership issue will be resolved properly soon and that we will see who is the proper owner . 
  well , i guess that international law should then matter . 
  yes . 
  there are also many albanian workers . 
  my logic applies to a mine which is an commercial entity , not a town . 
  the mine should be in the hands of those who can prove they have ownership on it . 
  ownership is disputed . 
  serbian government claims that republic of serbia has 55 % ownership in the mines and paperwork to prove it . 
  i hope that we will see those papers and that this forcefull takeover wo n't happen because it demolishes the eu 's ownership principle . 
  what dimitrovgrad has to do with trepca ? 
  a couple of months ago there was rumors in our news media that albanians in kosovo will try to nationalize trepca mine . 
  there was also a rumor that brussel will support this decission by stopping eu ascending procedure for serbia if serbia does n't accept and give trepca to albanians . 
  we will see if that rumor was also true . 
  hopefully not .
