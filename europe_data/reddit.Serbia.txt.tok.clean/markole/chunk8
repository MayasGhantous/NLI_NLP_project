  also , evro is written in cyrillic . 
  euro in cyrillic is \u0415\u0423\u0420\u041e . 
  subtle difference . 
  yep but their intentions are known now . 
  if i go around my company saying how i 'm quitting , nobody is going to start a new project with me . 
  posted already . 
  that does n't make any sense . 
  it may be legal but it certainly is n't logical . 
  are n't you all nato buddies ? 
  how would a nato country battle another nato country ? 
  actually , it is . 
  when you kill 300k out of 1.8 m people , it is ... 
  [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_holocaust_in_the_independent_state_of_croatia#serbs ) . 
  we also got china . 
  and you have vatican . 
  not to shabby . 
  serbians attacking romanians ... now i 've heard everything . 
  that is correct . 
  four s letters are the starting letters of a national saying \u201e \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0432\u0430 `` which can roughly be translated into `` only harmony can save the serb '' . 
   i guess your standard language is moving towards north serbian speech not really . 
  most people are actually starting to use the standard , `` belgradian '' speech because it 's the official dialect and because it 's mostly used on the television etc. 
   but just compare the language in newspapers from 60 's and from now that 's to be expected . 
  languages evolve all the time . 
  i 'm pretty sure croatian today is n't the same as the croatian in the 60s . 
  like we are going to listen to your silly sience and reason ... / s, 
   on the other hand , serbian language is moving towards croatian how exactly ? 
  croats invent new words all the time while we just embrace english ones , without any thought . 
  * budu\u0107nost / budu\u0107nost / \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u045b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 / \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u045b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 ( croatian , bosnian , serbian , montenegrian ) ... be politically correct . / s, 
  there is no inherent value ( except the historic one ) to any of those two scripts . 
  hell , we could be writing/reading serbian using the arabic script and nothing of value would be lost ( if the history was different and arabs became dominant country yada , yada , yada ) . 
  in eastern and south-eastern serbia the term karanje still is used as the word for ` arguing/having a ( verbal ) fight ' . 
  i have n't yet to encounter any school where german is teached as the second foreign language . 
  that would be the best choice since most people in this region use it . 
  me too but that wo n't happen because we are a small audience plus we kinda shoot ourselves in the foot by having multiple languages instead of one mega-language for serbia/croatia/bosnia / montenegro . 
  in serbia french is quite common as a second foreign language to learn . 
  for example , when i was a kid i started learning english in school since i was nine and i 've started learning french i got 11 years old . 
  brain drain . 
  correct . 
  as does the name holy roman empire . / s it 's ** roman ** ia , not ** roma ** ia . 
  she should have taught you about principles and integrity . 
  more like embracing kebab 's money . 
  \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / crna gora ( cyrillic text could be interesting to the cyrillic using / r/europe visitors ) . 
  i do not think that \u201e \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0446 `` marks a citizen of serbia in serbian language , as does `` serbian '' in the english language . 
  uhm . 
  forgive my cynicism but the region was already interconnected economically and politically not so long ago and that did n't ensure a lasting peace . 
  i hope your prediction becomes reality . 
   you almost never need to spell anything get on our level . 
  we * never * need to spell anything . 
  there is a letter for every unique sound in the serbian language . 
  hell , we even have two scripts , cyrillic and latin . 
   also , how far is croat and serb from czech ? 
  i 've never heard or read the language . 
  [ play this ] ( http://www.rts.rs/upload/storyboxfiledata/2017/02/21/29405020/dnevnik%20210217.mp4 ) and see for yourself . 
  standard news from tv . 
  if you do n't take the meaning in the account , then yes . 
  actually , skot is more like bastard . 
  ah ... meme is strong with this one . 
  would read it out as dee-ya-wat-rio . 
  was i close ? 
  erm , serbia was n't a part of austro-hungarian empire . 
  it was a part in the destruction of it but not a part of it . 
  we call czechia \u0427\u0435\u0448\u043a\u0430 / \u010ce\u0161ka in serbian . 
  [ here ] ( http://cdn.timesofisrael.com/uploads/2016/11/15110261_10209507936608588_4074372119233309036_o-e1480201423583.jpg ) . 
  the script literally does n't make a big difference . 
  for every letter in latin , there is a corresponding letter in cyrillic . 
  there is a 1:1 mapping . 
  you can read/write croatian in cyrillic and have it be 100 % functional . 
  actually , it works the other way around . 
  serbo-croatian is the language . 
  serbian , croatian , bosnian and montenegrian are all standards of that language . 
  op is many things but troll ? 
  hardly . 
   so quit pretending like ww2 is any sort of excuse i do not think / u/ihmed wanted to present ww2 croatian and bosnian attrocities as an excuse but as one of the reasons for serbian attrocities during the 90 's . 
   joined/annexed , isto sranje , drugo pakovanje well , it 's a bit different . 
  annexation implies force and i was taught that serbian and montenegrin people wanted the unification . 
   i meant , they do n't need to downvote you . 
  do n't worry about the silly internet points . 
  i 'm here just for civil and intelectually challenging conversations . 
   interestingly , though , wikipedia mentions this that wikipedia page was edited ( harshly ) 16 days ago . 
  you can see the [ diff here ( line 84 ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=kingdom_of_montenegro&amp;diff=747425485&amp;oldid=747422670 ) . 
  i would take it with a grain of salt , without enough references which would explain such large edit . 
   also : no need to downvote markole . 
  i did n't downvote you . 
  1918 was the year when montenegro unified with kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenians . 
  that 's what our historians say . 
  what do your historians say ? 
  to annex again , you first need to annex it once . 
  your knowledge of history is lacking . 
  not that much . 
  dialect spoken in south ( nis and places around nis , torlakian dialect ) are somewhat less understandable but you can understand it still if you listen a bit more carefully . 
  regarding croatian dialects , kajkavian dialect is indeed hard to understand . 
  it 's a lot easier for croat , who was n't exposed to kajkavian , to understand standard serbian than kajkavian dialect . 
  difference between `` monenegrin '' and serbian are the same as differences between english spoken in new zealand and english spoken in australia . 
  i would say that that differences are even smaller . 
  i never had any problems while i was in montenegro . 
  where did you hear that ? 
  that is correct . 
  nikolic is the president and vucic is the prime minister . 
  also , vucic is ** very ** vocal and pro-west . 
  yep , that 's why i wrote ` usually ` .
