great in theory . 
  but hard to implement when you 're trying to appease two great powers . 
   pays to be russia 's lap dog , heh ? 
  serbia is hardly russia 's lapdog . 
  we 're more like the guy in one of those medieval stretchy torture chambers . 
  the eu is pulling really hard on one side , and russia on the other . 
  serbia wants both to be happy , but that 's kind of impossible . 
  d'awww . 
  this was done when we had around 35k users , just so you know . 
  also , it 's tough getting people to participate . 
  updated to include the calculation method everyone expects by default . 
   enjoy !, 
  updated !, 
  i hope you like it . 
  i 've updated the calculation methods . 
  you now how a choice . 
   edit : stats are weird though , they do n't really make sense the stats are correct , just calculated across all of europe !, 
   in any case , i have added a new feature that calculates stats per-country , the way everyone here expects it to . 
  enjoy !, 
   i understood that way too late , and yeah , very unintuitive the intuition was for it be european-wide , to see the percentage of / r/europe 's users , not per-country . 
  however , since enough people are asking for this , i 'll add it over the weekend . 
  as for intuition , it 's also pretty intuitive to see * where * / r/europe 's userbase is based on a series of questions , which is what this current method of calculation shows . 
  anyway , expect a radio button soon , to give you the option to decide what you want to look at !, 
   tl ; dr op fucked up the displaying of the stats . 
  it 's a european-wide representation . 
  i can add a separate calculation * per country * if people really want something like that . 
  i 'll add individual calculations for the next annual survey , or if people * really * want it for this one , this one . 
  edit : added !, 
   it seems that the percentages do n't show the number of people within a certain country that fit a certain filter , ** but rather how many people that fit that filter come from a certain country in contrast to the rest of europe . 
  ** yes , this is exactly the way it 's [ intended to work ] ( https://github.com/aleksandarmicovic/aleks.rs/blob/master/extra/2014-10-12-europe-subreddit-results-2013/europe_survey.js#l936 ) . 
   we 're comparing across all of europe , what with this being / r/europe and all !, 
  perhaps for the upcoming annual 2014/2015 survey , i will include individual countries , as well . 
  thanks for letting me know someone wants something like this . 
   ** edit : ** i 've updated stuff . 
  there 's now a radiobox to choose the calculation method you prefer . 
  oh , you . 
  yoouuuu !, 
  you 're good , you . 
  all good things must come to an end . 
  there are lots of students , expats , and people who only speak english around the world . 
  only self-posts can be stickied . 
   did n't know that i live in serbia . 
  i guess we are learning everyday . 
  you do n't . 
  you live in `` serb . '', 
  i 'm very pleasantly surprised by our list . 
  after the social and news stuff , wikipedia , and after more social and news-y stuff ( including imdb and linkedin ) queue the piratebay . 
  internet penetration in our country may not be as high as it is for everyone else , but this sure makes us look tech savvy . 
  it 's standard to have international observers . 
  it 's okay . 
  the number would be 100 % if they asked us about you . 
  pretty sure most people in the balkans do . 
  what 's weird is that even people who were born * after * the fact miss it too . 
  yeah , that 's really weird . 
  well , like you said , it 's a small minority . 
  smaller even than the secessionist movement in vojvodina , which is practically non-existent . 
  so , perhaps that 's why . 
  or uncharted !, 
  yeah , sorry about the edit . 
  i was trying to formulate what exactly i wanted you to answer because i was genuinely curious about a linguist 's take on things . 
  thanks once again for the replies . 
  thank you for your thoughtful reply . 
  thank you for the explanation . 
  while i have you , and if you feel like answering , is kordic 's assessment that the main features of language policy in croatia were purism and prescriptivism since the 90s ? 
  is it fair to refer to everything as a polycentric language with 4 variants instead ? 
  perhaps i did n't use the correct terminology . 
  instead of attacking my intentions , can you be productive and explain it to me ? 
  that kind of tone is n't really conducive to a discussion . 
  i looked up the definition , and this is the one i was using :  a variety of a language that is distinguished from other varieties of the same language by features of phonology , grammar , and vocabulary , and by its use by a group of speakers who are set off from others geographically or socially . 
  croatian and serbian seem to fit that mold . 
  can you describe what you 're talking about ? 
  i genuinely want to learn . 
  oh , i was n't disagreeing with him . 
  i just was n't being explicit enough . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/language_secessionism#in_serbo-croatian both serbian and croatian were never thought of as different languages , and even today , most linguists would agree that they are , in fact , the same language ... as would most serbs and croats . 
  the only difference is dialect , and regional minutiae . 
   the thing is , russia 's leverage was the threat to cut of gas . 
  now it 's cut off , that threat is gone . 
  not all of it . 
  just some of it . 
  i fully expect more cuts around winter , as that would hit the hardest . 
   it 's estimated that that slovenian separated from other western southslavic languages somewhere in the 10th century ( innovative accentuation ) , while croatian and serbian had their split in the 11th century ** or later ** . 
  much much later . 
  i do n't care about his post history . 
  he can post on / r/niggers for all i care . 
  all i care about is the content posted here , because that 's what i 'm responding to . 
  nope . 
  pretend that you 've never entered into an argument with me and pretend you have no idea what i 'm talking about . 
  it 's cute . 
  i choose not to argue . 
  deep down i know you 're thanking me , so no need to say it out loud . 
  of course they 'd boycott an unfavourable referendum , serbs wanted to stay with yugoslavia as a whole . 
  and lost the war ? 
  are you sure ? 
  firstly , there are no winners and losers in any war , and this is doubly true for the balkans . 
  secondly , i seem to recall there being this large area called republika srpska , almost half of bosnia actually , with a very serbian population and its own president , and own-everything really . 
  what loss are you talking about ? 
  they 've got their recognition . 
  they 're the most autonomous region that 's part of another country , in the world . 
  never said they were in the same boat .
