   do n't play stupid . 
  i 'm referring to the '99 kosovo war . 
  i was n't playing stupid , i was just making sure since you like to embellish numbers , so i figured you had to have been referring to something that did n't exist . 
  we 're a fairly new country , and we 're heading into the right direction . 
  even though serbia does n't want that and is trying actively to interrupt our progress . 
  no one is trying to interrupt anything . 
  last i heard diplomatic relations were still ongoing . 
  the illegality we 'll have to agree to disagree on . 
   i do not support that . 
  because the north is n't going to be discriminated or oppressed by the kosovo government or people , like kosovo was by serbia . 
  and if that will be the case , then sure , no one should live in under oppression . 
  milosevic was not only in the hague , he was * dead * . 
  who was oppressing you for that missing decade , again ? 
  the only reason for splitting is a strong majority , and if kosovo did n't have that , it would n't have split . 
  plain and simple . 
  and oppression is n't even a requirement for a secessionist state to succeed : see catalonia . 
  in my opinion , the only thing that 's going to resolve this is a king solomon-like solution . 
  what do i mean by this ? 
  a solution where serbia is n't happy and one where kosovo is n't happy . 
  and that solution is splitting the north . 
   it seems like everybody is using the part of history that suits them best for their cause . 
  just like you and your `` righteous '' claims , am i right ? 
   fact is , or to be fair , my opinion is , albanians were here before serbs . 
  well , your opinion is n't grounded in fact then . 
  modern-day albanians are * not * illyrians . 
  my op had a link with genetic markers backing this up , you 'd do yourself a favour looking at them . 
  we 're all practically the same . 
  besides , the land itself * all over europe * does n't belong to anyone if you look back far enough . 
   serbia started an ethnic cleansing campaign in kosovo . 
  thousands were killed and more than 800 000 albanians were driven out of kosovo . 
  holy embellishment batman . 
  just to be clear here , what are you referring to ? 
  as for your second point , i love how you say , * serbs did bad stuff . 
  * all of a sudden , albanian majority . 
  i wonder what happened in between ? 
  you say you 're not a nationalist , but honestly , your argument reads exactly like the rationale of a racist when he starts saying , * i 'm not a racist but ... *  but i guess my point is that kosovo is independent , serbia has no control over it , stop clinging to something you 've irrevocably lost . 
  interesting choice of language . 
  why do you say `` you '' ? 
  i have no stake in the matter . 
  and some `` independence '' kosovo , a drug-ridden land with a split population and a made-up nationality is enjoying . 
  sure , on paper many nations say you 're independent , so if that 's all independence means to you , then i hope you enjoy it . 
  just a thought experiment going forward , no need to respond to me : imagine if catalonia ( or any other separatist region , really ) illegally split the way kosovo did . 
  do you think the international community 's response would be the same ? 
  do you support northern kosovo splitting off , much in the same way kosovo did ? 
  why , or why not ? 
  i meant after the sudden colouring of blue in the video . 
  but yes , you 're right . 
  i like how the map shows us as this little blob that held out as long as it could before [ being swallowed ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_persecution_of_serbs ) . 
  and i also love how slowly but surely hitler began losing in the east . 
  massive props to whoever sat down and actually looked at the battles and points of control for * every single day * during the war , and then put them onto this map . 
   do you see that he 's implying that serbs settled in kosovo before albanians ? 
  he never said such a thing ( true or not ) -- he was only referring to recent history . 
   history or the present , either way albanians have righteous claim to this territory . 
  ah , and there it is , your true colours . 
  * righteous . 
  * spoken like a true nationalistic dickhead . 
  kindly take your nationalistic bullshit elsewhere . 
  [ we 're more similar than not ] ( http://www.bosniafacts.info/science-and-geography/genetic-makeup-of-the-balkans ) and it 's people like you who spew the garbage that you do who hamper peace . 
  honestly , i do n't know why , but news like this makes me strangely happy . 
  humans , and the quirks we have and what we do to support them , are * awesome * . 
  absolutely right . 
  living in belgrade , and rent is around 200-250 euros ( and it 's usually cheaper ) , and with other costs and everything you wo n't be going over 350 euros max a month . 
  you can live * very * well here if you have a decent-paying job . 
  a public gay bar is hardly `` in the closet '' if it 's public . 
  i do n't know which belgrade you visited , but the vast majority of people truly do n't care . 
  like i said , such places would have burned to the ground long ago . 
  and no , because of this minorities are * not * silenced . 
  only the parade is . 
   the fact that minorities can be bullied into silence is reprehensible . 
  except you 're implying that the gays are bullied into silence only if they do n't have the parade , which just is n't the case here . 
  the truth of the matter is that nobody really cares if you 're gay in belgrade , and that 's evidenced by the pockets of gay culture in the city , like gay bars , etc. 
  if violence were really that big of an issue , these places would have burned to the ground a long time ago . 
   if they had to provide 50,000 officers to make sure it could happen , it would be worth it . 
  no , it would n't . 
  this is an extremely naive view , and if you stepped off of your golden high horse for just a second , you would see that turning your city into a war zone is not worth it . 
  the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few . 
  eh , same thing happened last year . 
  unlike last year , though , the hooligans seemed more organized in advance this year , which is probably what prompted this . 
  plus when i read stuff like this ,  according to reports , the police was also prepared , with 6,500 officers set to provide security for the event - which would have been the largest deployment of the police in the history of belgrade . 
  at that point it 's not really a parade , but a walk that puts your safety at risk . 
  i 'd be lying if i said a part of me is n't relieved that the parade is n't happening . 
  similar , more like `` what europe !? '', 
  or after a particularly good piece of news comes out about serbia , or something bad about europe , you add it at the end and it can mean , `` and yeah , that 's europe ! '', 
  or `` we do n't need europe at all ! '', 
  you can substitute `` europe '' for virtually anything , though . 
  for example , say you walked across vienna without a cab/taxi and you wanted to brag when friends asked you why you did this , you can say , `` ma kakav taksi ! '', 
  no , it 's usually added onto sentences to emphasize that sentence . 
  something in between * i 'm telling you * and * brother * . 
  i 'm not a linguist , but my guess is that it probably comes from * brate * , though admittedly i never really thought about it before . 
  say that to my face . 
  i 'll get us started with something pretty controversial . 
  you can have things besides meat or cheese inside a burek and still call it a burek . 
  yes , in belgrado we had a few buildings that were hit by nato bombs and remained standing . 
  geographically , yeah . 
  but he 's probably referring to the rainfall that the canadian west and uk get . 
  this is brilliant . 
  the op article was off slightly , it 's most definitely [ considered to be a scientific journal ] ( http://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=5800179619&amp;tip=sid ) . 
  [ link to actual paper .

  just a single * major * headline from the `` world '' or `` european '' section of online sites ( and main page ) .
