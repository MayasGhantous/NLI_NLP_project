  the reaction of everyone is by and large apathy , though . 
  fascinating bit of information : if trends continue , i do n't think scotland will vote in favour of independence :  * in february 2013 , a university of glasgow poll returned ** 62 % against ** independence with 2,518 votes cast  * in april 2013 , an edinburgh napier university survey returned ** 70 % against ** independence with 569 respondents  * in september 2013 , a survey of over 11,000 aberdeenshire schoolchildren eligible to vote in the referendum found ** 75.5 % against ** independence [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scottish_independence_referendum,_2014#school_and_university_surveys ) . 
  adults may swing the other way , but the way children are raised to think is often a reflection of their parents . 
   since the fall of communism , the countries of eastern europe have not put any effort into keeping their rail net in state or even modernizing it . 
  the same thing has happened with regional railways in western europe , but in western europe we saw massive improvements on the main lines . 
  nearly all infrastructure investments in eastern europe went into motorways it 's not an `` either or '' thing . 
  either railways , or motorways . 
  the latter of which also is n't up to snuff in many areas , but that 's neither here nor there . 
  it also is n't fair to say that eastern europe has n't put in any effort , simply because of $ $ $ . 
  as things get financially better and better here , railways will improve , but until then we ca n't really make a half-decent effort to do anything regarding them . 
  with the speed at which some of the tracks are crossed here , the death in `` death trap '' refers to dying of boredom . 
  sorry , but this * really * is n't a quality post : it adds nothing of value to / r/europe , and falls under the umbrella of being a meme ... something that 's frowned upon here . 
  removed . 
  smells so fishy that i can smell it all the way here . 
  no matter what your opinion on farage is , how incredibly convenient and almost * contrived * it must seem to have something like this surface before a party conference . 
  and not just that , but at the point at which the ukip has never been more popular , and showing no signs of slowing down . 
  let the attacks on character begin !, 
  because attacking character is much easier than attacking his points . 
  take this piece of news with a grain of salt . 
  it 's a thriller about a man who wakes up with amnesia , and is told that his family has been killed . 
  slowly he begins piecing his life together again , but the more he finds out , the more things start looking like a nightmare . 
  racism is n't tolerated here . 
   forgive my uneducated guess , but is n't it more likely that the crime was commited by ethinc serbs ? 
  besides , mitrovica has a large population of both sides . 
  in any case , it 's far more likely customs got engaged with some criminals and the victim was caught in the cross-fire . 
  and just so you know , most albanians in kosovo do n't like eulex much either . 
  if you 're going to cuss someone out , at least have some arguments in your post . 
  say that to my face . 
   serbia is a country that was born from the remains of yugoslavia it has existed way before yugoslavia . 
  you 're absolutely correct , and i agree wholeheartedly . 
  one group 's freedom fighters are another group 's terrorists . 
  it 's interesting to note that the same state that protected them , also willingly gave them up later on , but that 's neither here nor there . 
  as for why they 're still such popular figures , it 's probably because of the overall goal that they were fighting for was , and * still * is noble . 
  bosnia , under its constitution was not allowed to secede without a vote from the muslims * and * the very large serb population . 
  the muslims wanted their own country , but the serbs did not , and wanted to stay . 
  so , when bosnia illegally declared itself independent by ignoring its own constitution , tensions went from being high , to just broken ... and war naturally broke out . 
  if it was n't for those people sitting in the hague right now , there would n't be a republika srpska . 
  and despite their crimes against humanity , they 're also credited with saving the serbian people in bosnia , and giving them their rightful sovereignty that the muslims ca n't take away anymore . 
  there is no loving or hating on the international stage . 
  only interests . 
  and unfortunately because of the interests of more powerful nations , we get swept under the rug very often . 
  this is n't something unique to serbia . 
   other thing that no one in europe knows , serbian soldier 's that were trapped by kosovo 's `` army '' were taken to clinic , from there albanian 's would take they 're organs !, 
  after that they would sell them . 
  actually independent investigations are now proving that this really happened , so i would n't say no one knows about it . 
  what 's more interesting is that thaci seems to be linked to all of it . 
  probably because of the scorpions , a paramilitary group made up of mostly bosnian serbs and greeks , and the little known thing they did in srebrenica . 
  still , you are right in that serbia , as a state itself , has been cleared of all wrong-doing during the war by the icty . 
  yet people seem to love to ignore this fact while parading around other icty decisions against war criminals of serbian descent , like serbia is guilty of something . 
  a frequent argument brought up is that serbia could have made more of an effort to stop what happened in bosnia , but so could have the un , which did absolutely nothing until it was too late . 
  you may be interested in [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1hoc3f/series_what_do_you_know_about_serbia/ ) . 
   the parties in government have suggested to half the population of the nations wild bears and lynxs . 
  ... why ? 
  the serbian wikipedia is doing just fine , thanks . 
  in fact , [ we even host contests to improve all sorts of articles about a topic ] ( https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%92%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b8%d0%bf%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b8%d1%98%d0%b0:%d0%a2%d0%b0%d0%ba%d0%bc%d0%b8%d1%87%d0%b5%d1%9a%d0%b5_%d1%83_%d0%bf%d0%b8%d1%81%d0%b0%d1%9a%d1%83_%d1%87%d0%bb%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%ba%d0%b0/%d0%a4%d0%b8%d0%b7%d0%b8%d1%87%d0%ba%d0%b8_%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%82%d0%b8 ) , from biology to physics , to what-have-you . 
  we 're very neutral and very active . 
  i would say our wikipedia works just fine . 
  the vast majority of serbs have still not returned to this day , and it 's not clear if they ever will . 
  i 'm talking out of my ass here , but with london ( and new york ? ), 
  gone , would n't tokyo take that title ? 
  it would seem that the croatians fighting against it are in the right . 
  like that small article says , two prominent figures have spoken out it seems , both warning their fellow croatians * to avoid * the croatian wikipedia . 
  that 's pretty unprecedented and crazy . 
   as two particularly prominent examples he listed croatian wikipedia 's coverage of the term istrijanstvo ( istrian regionalism ) , defined as a `` movement fabricated to reduce the number of croats '' , and antifa\u0161izam ( anti-fascism ) , which is according to him defined opposite of what it really means . 
  it 'd be nice if we could have someone who is familiar with the situation to follow up here . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liac7pqdefg ), 
  looks delicious . 
  no one said it was an eu problem . 
  that 's the main difference , but there are others such as dialect and different words . 
  you can definitely make a case for putting up both cyrillic and latin . 
  serbia does this in many areas , and vukovar is trying to as well despite nationalistic fervor . 
  it 's part of croatia 's law anyway , and as an eu member , i 'm quite surprised the eu wo n't even give an opinion ... but that 's the eu for you . 
  i recommend doing what most people in the balkans who are n't involved are doing -- grab some popcorn , and enjoy the show . 
  this will resolve itself . 
   it 's sad that serbia is looking to the east instead of the west , think the country 's political leaders are still stuck in the past . 
  first of all , the opposite is quite true . 
  our political leaders are chasing after the eu , and have been for the past few years , even when the majority of the population did n't support the idea . 
  also ,  peace for the former yugoslav republics will come much faster if they all join the eu . 
  do n't you think there 's something wrong with this statement ? 
  it 's almost akin to saying , `` for there to be peace everyone must be in the eu . '', 
  and just so you know , the balkans are a pretty peaceful place as it is right now . 
  \u010cevapi with a hot lepinja , onions , kajmak , and a side of pasulj . 
  by the way , sharing food is a great idea for tomorrow 's melting pot friday . 
  so , to follow up on this thread tomorrow , that 's what we 'll do !, 
  the un through resolution 1244 also said that about kosovo . 
  the un is going to have zero influence on catalonia . 
  you 're blowing things out of proportion . 
  race was only introduced in the context of him guessing who and where you 're from :  i tag people specifically based on comments they made themselves and you mentioned some time ago that you 're a jew living in the us . 
  he 's not throwing insults at you , so stop reporting him . 
  if you do n't like online arguments , do n't engage in them . 
  and do n't play the race card . 
   no , it lies with the people who did the actual killing . 
  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 i 'm talking about the supposed `` payment '' this thread is about . 
  if the un wanted to take responsibility by coming in and setting rules , which it did , then they should be held accountable for their failures as well . 
   the most obvious guilty party would be the republika srpska . 
  that 's not obvious at all . 
  if you want to get really technical , the group that did the massacre was a split faction called the `` scorpions '' made of up of serbs and greeks . 
  they 're the guilty party , not the people of republika srpska . 
  well if you 're implying the state of serbia has to , the icty has cleared serbia of any wrong-doing . 
  the majority of the blame lies with the un anyway .
