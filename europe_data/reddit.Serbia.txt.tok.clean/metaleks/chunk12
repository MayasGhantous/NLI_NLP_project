  when muslims attacked serbian villages and retreated to their safehold of srebrenica , which was guaranteed un protection , the un ignored the bosnian serbs ' complaints . 
  time and time again . 
  i 'm a firm believer in that had the un stepped in right there and then , the srebrenica massacre never would have happened . 
  yup !, 
  as did bosnia with bosnian , and to a greater extent today montenegro with montenegrin . 
  do n't use `` they '' . 
  most serbs will tell you that we absolutely speak the same language ( in fact , kids are taught this in school , and in language/grammar books here it says as much as well ) . 
  because of this , most people here just simply do n't care . 
  the same can not be said for the croat side , though . 
  croatia 's ministry starting from the 90s during the breakup , in a nationalistic fervor really tried to distinguish themselves and make their language `` different '' as much as possible by adding new words , etc. 
  it 's often the subject of jokes here in serbia . 
   but thank you for completely ingoring the nuances that i wrote about in the second part of my post . 
  you caught my post 1 minute too early , before the edit . 
  i did n't ignore your history tidbit , as i acknowledged it when i mentioned vojvodina and its history . 
   as far as novi sad is concerned , roman script signs have been defaced numerous times in novi sad , to my knowledge . 
  it goes both ways . 
  hooligans gon na hooligan ' . 
  the difference here is that you ca n't compare what happened in vukovar to some street urchin with spray paint in novi sad . 
   but i found your remark that this is solely about nationalism rather insulting . 
  well , my apologies then . 
  but you said it yourself that the reasons for what happened were largely historical , and therefore cyrillic in vukovar would promote a strong emotional response . 
  that emotional response is rooted in nationalism because of that very history . 
  ** edit : ** saw your edit and thought i 'd respond . 
   what do vukovar serbs use as an excuse for burning the croatian flag and disrespecting the memorial day of their own city ( when it was razed to the ground ) ? 
  again , while not nice and clearly nationalistic from the * few * serbs who do that in vukovar , it 's completely irrelevant to the topic at hand . 
  ( side note : i 'm not sure if this happens all the time either , by the way . 
  i 've tried looking it up in the news , and it seems to me that the flag was burned only on days of note , like the icty ruling . 
  if you have other sources , i 'd like to see them . ), 
  you 're right that preference is irrelevant , however , it 's also irrelevant that it does n't matter what serbs have been using for years in croatia , and it 's also irrelevant at what year the serbian constitution was finalized . 
  only two things are relevant here : croatian law to use a minority 's officially recognized script in areas like this , and the fact that cyrillic is the official script . 
  also , let 's not forget that despite the two languages being virtually identical , there are certain words and phrases that are not , along with croatian jekavian . 
  so , there is certainly a clear cut case for having two languages being displayed . 
  perhaps the protesters should use the serbian city of [ novi sad ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/novi_sad_mayor_office.jpg ) as an example of how to be accepting and tolerant of minorities . 
  vojvodina also has a `` history '' but people there wo n't use it as an excuse the way the croats in vukovar do . 
  well put . 
  not if you speak english with a north-american accent , it is n't . 
   when i see that my comment is hidden ** because i have different fucking opinion ** than the majority of the subreddit , i just lose the will to discuss anything in that thread . 
  i just checked your comments , and you were downvoted because the * vast majority * of your countrymen told you why you were * wrong * and yet you persisted . 
  just having an opinion does n't make it valid . 
  some opinions are more correct than others , and some are just wrong . 
   still you are kindoff right . 
  most serbs are quite used to it . 
  unfortunately , it does nothing but add fuel to anti-serbian conspiracies . 
  yes , but cyrillic is the only constitutionally recognized script . 
  many , including myself , prefer it to latin . 
  the protest are nothing but croatian nationalism in effect . 
  so , this is actually a great idea . 
  the way it 'll probably work is if it 's the theme for one week . 
  maybe not this one , since this week is `` insults '' , but perhaps the next . 
  then-macedonia , yes . 
  not today 's slavic macedonia . 
  no , you must eat * healthy !,

  since you forgot to link it , people can find the map [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wdgv1wb.jpg ) . 
   in any case , i think you did a good job . 
   republika srpska oh , * you !, 
  most of these are made by the roma population . 
  agreed . 
  i 'm going to be putting up a wiki page with all series , their schedules , and archives relatively soon . 
  it would be nice in the future if someone wanted to start a new thing , they would have all of this information at their fingertips . 
  you 're absolutely correct , but if english borrowed it from latin , then serbian borrowed it from english . 
  it comes from seeing `` extra '' labeled on all sorts of products and/or services that are n't quite completely translated -- so the thought process is `` more is better '' , and that 's how `` extra '' became `` better '' or `` good '' . 
  the most widely used pseudo-anglicism in serbian is the english word `` extra '' , or in serbian , `` ekstra '' . 
  it basically means good/awesome/recommended / etc. 
  for example , `` film je bio ekstra '' means `` the movie was great '' . 
  ugh , i 'm in one of the screenshots ... 
  okay , so for the record , before this entire thing hits the fan ( if it does at all ) , i approved * one * of his comments , not * some * , so bad choice of words by me . 
  secondly , if we 're going by his comments alone , then i agree that he should n't have been banned . 
  * however * , if we wanted to fish for reasons , his username could be grounds for one . 
  we are n't 4chan . 
  cool , edgy and obscene usernames that show how far you can push `` freedom of speech '' are stupid . 
  have you heard of [ tox ] ( http://tox.im/ ) ? 
  i think once it takes off it could very well replace skype since one of its aims is to be convenient and easy to use . 
   may i make a suggestion that for a topic such as this one , a short summary would be useful , i.e. 
  what the eu has done so far with regards to israel . 
  thanks for the suggestion and i agree . 
  i would even take it one step further and say that all round tables in the future have some sort of short summary . 
  not everyone can be expected to follow * everything * . 
  ko ih jebe . 
  a very apt description . 
  it 's only useless if you said eu and then did n't list some eu countries , but since you said europe , i was expecting to see a lot more countries . 
  ... does that count ? 
  i 'm going to get the ball rolling and make a prediction : a lot of people will support scotland 's independence partly for spite . 
  i know i do . 
  it 's nothing but morbid curiosity to want to to see how a nuclear war would play out . 
  and scotland is much the same way . 
  i obviously do n't wish a nuclear winter on us all , but scotland separating is n't as dangerous , and i 'm * very curious * to see how things will play out if it happens . 
  so why not ? 
  that 's part of my reason . 
  the other ( more sensible ) part is that i believe in the scottish and their right to choose . 
  cool , i guess we 're famous now . 
   there were no blindly mass bombing of cities as far as i know . 
  there were . 
  uzice and the surrounding villages got hit randomly . 
  my uncle had a bomb land on his farm as well . 
  the entire operation was a botched job . 
  i mean , they even managed to bomb the chinese embassy . 
  hello , i 'm here . 
  calm down , my friend . 
  things change ?
