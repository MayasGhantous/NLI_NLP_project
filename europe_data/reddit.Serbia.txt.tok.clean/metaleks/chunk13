  i do n't know what you want me to say . 
   does this surprise you ? 
  no , it * interests * me . 
  it 's a google form , so it 's all automatic . 
  the pretty charts and maps people are generating is done from the raw csv data that 's been posted . 
   ... starting next week ... \\ ^_^, 
  no such feature exists . 
  i just looked it up , and it would appear that the c in csv is n't a catch-all for all delimiters like i thought ... my bad !, 
  clearly , the number of reddit users should be the metric for everything . 
  you did a good job regardless . 
  it would have been cool to see the percentage of support from each country , though . 
  for example , it 's interesting that every country in balkans seems to be overwhelmingly in supportive of independence . 
  all right , i 'll put it on one of those . 
  thanks . 
  please give me an alternative and i 'll gladly do it . 
  it 's usually a vocal minority that does all the complaining . 
  but if it matters at all , i 've never seen a mod do the things you describe . 
  with that said , no two mods will always mod the same thing the same way . 
  personally , i only remove comments that are outright xenophobic ... 
  i do n't care for foul language . 
  i moderate content , not tone , and i think most mods feel the same way . 
  interesting idea . 
  maybe . 
  you must be german . 
  this is also one of the suggestions and will be considered . 
  no worries . 
  it 's becoming painfully clear that a lot of people are overlooking the banner at the top of the subreddit . 
  it 's on the todo list , and you wo n't miss the next one . 
  i 'm glad to hear it !, 
  i 'm sorry to hear that , though i suspect you 're not alone . 
  what could have been done differently to make those of you who missed it , aware ? 
  the majority of outright xenophobic comments do n't result in a ban , but instead the removal of the comment . 
  from what i 've seen , constant racist trolling and affiliation with a xenophobic subreddit combined with xenophobic comments will get you banned . 
  it would appear to be a suggestion ... 
  it too , will be considered . 
  this is only the beginning . 
  well , it 's a good thing then that scotland 's independence will be discussed in finer detail in the first round table , this monday . 
  sure , but what makes you think a united states of europe is the solution ? 
  nope , it ai n't . 
  definitely against . 
  if it ai n't broken , why fix it ? 
  i said that the rate of growth was accelerating , which means that if we got 1500 subscribers one month , to use your example , then the next month will be even bigger . 
  instead of having the survey tied to subscribers , having it every 6 months or so is probably what 's going to end up happening . 
  because the rate of growth of the subreddit is accelerating . 
  we 're already at 31.5 k !, 
  people do n't like facts when it does n't suit them . 
  yes , the numbers have dwindled since then , but people have still been submitting responses . 
  i was a bit naive with the scheduling , but now i know for the future ( which wo n't happen at the next 10k mark -- but much later ) . 
  however , to ensure that there is a consistent number of responses every day the next time we do a survey , we 're going to be a lot more forward with the news item at the top of the page . 
  making the font bigger , more annoying , whatever works . 
  that way , we only have to run things for about a week , and maybe even less . 
  you 're # 1 in my heart . 
  which raises the question , how could the eu overlook something like this ? 
  i suppose the eu does n't really care about these sorts of things since ~ 200,000 serbs in croatia have also not returned , and they too , were allowed to join the eu . 
  serbian rights there are [ still a bit hazy ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region.php?yyyy=2013&amp;mm=07&amp;dd=08&amp;nav_id=86877 ) . 
  belgrade has long been the `` silicon valley '' of the balkans . 
  new belgrade especially , and the surrounding area , is full of software companies . 
  and of the five microsoft development centres in the world , one of them is in belgrade . 
  talent is cheap , available , and very competent . 
  despite the 2008 recession , for the last 10 years serbia 's economy has been experiencing a steady growth , and it 's in large part to software . 
  andric is a serbian writer the same way many americans consider tesla to be an american scientist as well . 
  in any case , the nobel prize is currently listed as belonging to serbia , so your reality is n't a substitute for the real thing . 
  enjoy your victim complex . 
  ** serbia ** - we have a date for further eu talks . 
  - we have guideline for further eu talks . 
  - actually it 's more of a timeframe . 
  - `` january '' is being thrown around . 
  - okay , so we do n't actually have date . 
  - nobody knows what 's happening . 
  - in other news there 's a 10km line of trucks trying to enter croatia . 
  this seems to have died down today , which means they finally fixed things and started processing everyone . 
  fair enough . 
   what does `` wrote in a serbian style '' even mean ? 
   he was born in bosnia to croat parents , wrote mostly about life in bosnia under the ottoman empire , studied in sarajevo , zagreb , vienna , krakow and graz , was a member of bosnian parliament , etc. 
  i never disputed this , nor claimed he was an ethnic serb . 
  only that he was a serbian writer . 
   the only argument for him being a serb is that he lived a part of his life in belgrade . 
  i guess you glossed over him being declared a serb in 1958 and a bunch of other things i said in my response to you . 
  maybe you 're not familiar with / u/flyingorange , but he is a very big serb-hater and all-around general tool . 
  this is n't the first time we 've butt heads , and he 's claimed many times that vojvodina should n't be in serbia . 
  that 's why the flair is relevant , and i apologize for not making my op a little more clearer . 
  i 'm not denying and manipulating anything . 
  what is false about what i said ? 
  the icj cleared serbia of all wrongdoings regarding srebrenica . 
  yes , absolutely . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_serbia ) is the wikipedia article on it . 
  the state of serbia did no such thing . 
  you 're probably thinking of srebrenica , and that was a separate bosnian serb and greek volunteering organization called the scorpions that carried it out . 
  and it was in response to being provoked , and not unmediated murder , though it was murder nonetheless . 
  seems a bit silly to pin this on the state of serbia , does n't it ? 
  i mean , you can make an argument for serbia allowing it to happen , but then again , the un was in a better position to prevent it from happening than serbia was . 
  cool story . 
  you 're more correct than you know . 
  yugoslavia is more than just `` like '' serbia . 
  serbia is actually yugoslavia 's successor state . 
  so , all awards , debts , olympic victories , etc. 
  almost anything you can imagine , are now serbian . 
   ... by any ** stretch of imagination ** . 
  he wrote in a serbian style , was declared a serb in 1958 , joined the serbian academy of science and arts , married a serb , believed in the yugoslav cause , and lived and died in belgrade ( buried there as well ) . 
  it does n't take much stretching of the imagination to see why he is considered a serbian author .
