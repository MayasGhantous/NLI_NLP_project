  if by `` full speed '' you mean too laid back for their own good , then i agree with you . 
  otherwise , the only speed the serbs care about is the one when they drive ( nobody follows the limits , especially the farther you move away from a town ) . 
  as a general rule of thumb : no matter what the video , avoid youtube comments . 
   i probably forgot to add that i 'm from serbia so my view of the country is probably more accurate than those who 've been there once and were thrilled with the hamburgers . 
  who cares ? 
  you clearly have an agenda and an axe to grind as evidenced by your vojvodina flair . 
  most evil country in europe ? 
  serbia has some of the loveliest and laid back people anywhere . 
  everyone wants to leave ? 
  haha , i was born in canada and * moved * to serbia . 
   tesla was supposedly serbian . 
  more than supposedly . 
  he was a very proud serb ever since he was young , leading the serbian culture club in school . 
  later in life , he was quoted as saying :  there is something within me that might be illusion as it is often case with young delighted people , but if i would be fortunate to achieve some of my ideals , it would be on the behalf of the whole of humanity . 
  if those hopes would become fulfilled , the most exciting thought would be that it is a deed of a serb . 
   we used to own vojvodina and belgrade for some time . 
  i think everyone and their brother had control over belgrade at one point in time . 
  yes , the arms race , dreadnoughts , and growing tensions and nationalism across europe had nothing to do with it . 
   the women are incredibly beautiful . 
  as someone who grew up mostly outside of serbia , this surprised me too . 
  not only this , but most of those women can drink the average european under the table . 
  i grew up mostly in north america , so i hope i 'm still allowed to share some stuff . 
   hopefully most of it is interesting and less-known . 
  - belgrade was sieged in over 115 wars and razed to the ground 44 times . 
  - if you 're a gamer , the overwatch nexus in half-life 2 was modelled after the serbian parliament building in belgrade . 
  - and while we 're on the topic of games , niko bellic of the gta series , is also serbian . 
  - the [ exit festival ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exit_%28festival%29 ) and [ gu\u010da festival ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gu%c4%8da_trumpet_festival ) are some of the largest festivals in the world , both held in serbia . 
  the former was awarded the `` best european festival '' award one year , while the latter is the largest trumpet festival in the world . 
  miles davis was even quoted saying , `` i did n't know you could play the trumpet that way . '', 
  - serbia has a history of producing great inventors , scientists , and thinkers . 
  the most famous is probably nikola tesla . 
  however , pupin , milankovi\u0107 , and gop\u010devi\u0107 were also serbian . 
  - even albert einstein 's wife , mileva einstein , was not only serbian , but a mathematician , as well . 
  - ivo andri\u0107 , a prominent serbian author , won a nobel prize in literature . 
  he donated all of the money to improve libraries . 
  i strongly recommend the book to anyone who has a passing interest in the balkans . 
  - serbia 's also very good at sports . 
  from tennis ( the world # 1 in the world is currently serbian ) , handball , waterpolo , volleyball to basktetball ... ( but everyone here still cares more about soccer . 
  our soccer team is like communism . 
  it only looks good on paper . ), 
  - this probably has something to do with serbia having the second-tallest people in all of europe . 
  - a third of the world 's raspberries come from serbia !, 
   - of the five microsoft development centres in the world , one of them is in belgrade . 
  - despite a high unemployment rate , serbia 's economy has been seeing steady growth for the last 10 years , and 2013 is projected to be another good year . 
  ** subjective stuff : ** - i 'm a firm believer that serbia is probably the most ice-cream accessible country in the world . 
  it 's pretty rare to find a city block that does n't sell ice cream . 
  the two dominating brands are delta ( nestle ) and frikom . 
   i 'm curious , is gavrilo princip considered some sort of a national hero ? 
  absolutely , yes . 
  you have to take things into context here . 
  serbia finally rid itself of the ottoman empire , and what happens ? 
  it trades a set of shackles for another . 
  let 's not forget that the archduke decided to parade around on [ * vidovdan * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vidovdan ) . 
  you could not have picked a worse day to prance around in front of serbs . 
  not only is it an extreme insult given the state of things at the time , but you would think a ruler would know better about the customs of his subjects ... 
  in any case , even though i do n't condone violence or any sort of killing , i ca n't help but shake my head at the foolishness of archduke . 
  he really should have known better , and because he did n't , he got exactly what he deserved . 
   nor are serbs who live in croatia oppressed or anything , at least to my knowledge . 
  while i 'm sure this is mostly true , i have gotten my car keyed in croatia before . 
  as have a bunch of other friends for their serbian license plates . 
  but you can toss that up to hooligans , so whatever . 
  i also hear from/talk to some families i know ( who were among the 200,000 serbs who were forced to leave their homes in croatia ) and they constantly tell me how hard it is to come back and the vitriol they would deal with . 
  so things are n't as peachy as you make them out to be . 
  i believe that most croatians are kind-hearted people , but because hating serbs is tied strongly with nationalistic beliefs , and as another croat put it in this thread that the average croat is a nationalist , i think it 's going to be a while before things are returned to normalcy . 
  to be perfectly honest , and a little mean ... 
  i kind of wish both of our older generations would just hurry up and die out , so we can go back to being brothers . 
   i just hope this time we are not left by other europeans to fend them off for a few centuries . 
  oh , the irony . 
  you are not alone in your thoughts , as / u/deusdies is a minority among serbs that want to join the eu . 
  you sound like you 're from here , so you know that what our politicians want and what the people want are two different things . 
  were they to hold a referendum about the eu today , there would be a resounding ** no ** from serbia . 
  most serbs do n't want serbia in the eu , let alone what other countries think about this . 
   ... but it 's the truth and the opinion of the majority of this subreddit . 
  actually , that 's factually wrong . 
  i 'm going to be releasing the survey results for / r/europe relatively soon , but here 's a spoiler : the majority are for scotland 's independence . 
  out of curiosity , in what way is it doctored ? 
  [ an actual serbian folk song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liac7pqdefg ) , if anyone is n't interested in memes . 
   if a question asks ` nationality ' then it 's better to list the nationality rather than the country . 
  :p i agree but it screws with data collection and table joins when we want to display pretty things . 
  so many non-standard transformations like `` dutch '' to `` netherlands '' and so on ...  also ; dialects . 
  they are not officially languages , but i am often sorely tempted to include mine in ` how many do you speak ' questions . 
  the balkans would have everyone here beat if that were the case . 
  agreed , and a justified addition then . 
  i would assume that the previous mod 's logic who made the list was that greek was large enough to be its own category . 
  but since this bothers you so much , i 've explicitely added for you . 
  the old survey had an option for two , but some people then began talking about their 3 citizenships . 
  so , you ca n't please or accomodate everyone . 
  in your case , i would just pick one you identify with most and/or mostly belong to . 
  i 'm also in the same boat as you and could have chosen two , but clearly belonged to one more than the other . 
  none of the ethnicities listed are modern-day countries ( with the exception of greek , which has a pretty long developmental history ) . 
  a lot of other minor ethnicities are n't listed , and to list them all would take pages . 
  just use the `` other '' field , and type `` albanian '' . 
  fair point about prism . 
  those questions were generally meant as a test for [ things to come ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1gsyku/the_official_reurope_30k_subscribers_survey/cani1pz ) which will have the detail you want . 
  you know nothing , jon snow . 
  oh god , please no drama , haha . 
  the list of countries was actually copied from the previous survey . 
  fantastic suggestion . 
  will keep this in mind , thanks !, 
  sure .
