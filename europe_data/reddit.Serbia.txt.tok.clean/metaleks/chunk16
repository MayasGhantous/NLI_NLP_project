   the stalling is one of those idiotic things politics is doing in the balkans . 
  i do n't think you can just `` oh , there go the balkans again ! '', 
  for that . 
  multiple nations , agencies and organizations like the un wanted something , and albania did n't provide it . 
  that is n't those silly balkan countries at it again , that 's albania and only albania . 
  everyone else has been on the ball and timely on the case . 
   they guy is a straight out criminal , but too much has been made up in this case . 
  while yes , he 's a criminal , so far things are n't looking like they 're made up , especially with the conviction of these 5 . 
  but , only time will tell what happens next . 
  i have no idea what case you 're talking about . 
  you are talking about some corrupt judge , a * single * witness who commited suicide , and a bunch of documents from wikileaks that are n't confirmed . 
  i have n't mentioned any of those things . 
  what i 'm talking about is : 12 + testimonies , and leaked documents that are * being taken as truth by the un * and used to advance the investigations into this whole debacle . 
   thaci is a criminal . 
  there are more than enough shit the guy did to get him life sentences . 
  he pocketed after the war tens of millions , is entire close circle who he himself calls `` his gang '' are now party heads . 
  his family is known to beat people up in the street , inlcuding police officers . 
  he is above the law . 
  but the porgan harvesting story simply is completly made up . 
  sounds like your regular run-off-the-mill politician to me . 
  however , it 's becoming increasingly clear that the organ harvesting of serbs in kosovo * is n't made up * . 
  of course , thaci did n't pick up a scalpel and do it himself , but as one of the kla 's ringleaders at the time , he should be held responsible . 
  in any case , as more evidence against the kla keeps piling up , keep your eye out on the un 's 2014 report which will no doubt shed even more light on kla 's trafficking of organs . 
  yes , but that does n't mean anything at this point in time . 
  it 's pretty obvious even to the layperson that the kla is behind this . 
  just read some of the testimony from ex-kla members and the leaked documents * showing * their guilt . 
  like i said before , check out my other reply to you . 
   not a single serbian case was found out of the 20 + cases documented . 
  everything regarding this case is fishy . 
  from the [ albanian stalling of investigations ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8531289.stm ) to the misinformation flying everywhere . 
  however , for someone so well-informed you seem to have overlooked the leaked documents and new testimony from ex-kla members . 
  [ most victims from june to october 1999 were serbs ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=02&amp;dd=17&amp;nav_id=72766 ) . 
  in fact , there is [ no debate ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=02&amp;dd=20&amp;nav_id=72830 ) about the serb victims who had their organs harvested . 
  from that link , the traffickers made an estimated $ 45,000 per body . 
  in addition to the ever-growing pile of evidence , another report is due out next year ( 2014 ) which will include more testimonies and investigations into the smoking gun that are the leaked documents . 
   there were some pretty bad manipulations going on behind the scene in that case . 
  are you for real ? 
  if things do n't go the way you want , they 're `` manipulations behind the scenes '' ? 
  really ? 
   i hate thaci as much as the next guy ( there 's enough idiotic stuf he and his gang did ) but this organ harvesting stuff is just a straight up lie . 
  your word against dozens of testimonies , leaked documents and just in general the ever-growing pile of evidence against him and the kla . 
  no one is facing trials ? 
  i guess the title of the post was n't clear enough :  five ** convicted ** in kosovo ** organ trafficking ** case as far as the kla link is concerned , check out my other reply to you . 
   if that were the case someone would 've been sentenced by now , but the actual case is on the contrary , there 's only lack of evidence . 
  that would be true had the report in 2004 been followed through . 
  now that a few have in 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 , and combined with the fact that we have leaked documents , people are starting to face trials ... as per op 's submission . 
   if the allegations are true though , keep in mind that the albanians are on the same side as the others on this , we want the criminals punished just like anyone else . 
  that may be true for * you * but not your leader , who is linked to these accusations . 
  actually , a lot of the victims are believed to be serbs . 
  there are dozens of testimonies ( some from ex-kla members ) , leaked documents , and investigations ( early not-so-conclusive , and later conclusive ) , where it 's reasonable enough to say , `` yes , this did happen . '', 
  here is a [ small article ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=02&amp;dd=20&amp;nav_id=72830 ) about it , and [ another one ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=02&amp;dd=17&amp;nav_id=72766 ) . 
  and since this is such a heated topic , the [ wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organ_theft_in_kosovo ) is pretty well sourced . 
  also , no need to be a condescending douchebag , linking me to the dictionary definition of the word `` allegation '' . 
  i speak the english language just as well as you do . 
  cheers . 
  yes , and it also says :  ... had extracted and sold organs from captives , some of them serbs , at sites in neighbouring albania . 
  i apologize for not making myself clear enough . 
  of course , the kla harvested organs from more than just serbs . 
  it 's just that the serbian people have been talking about this for a while , and after having been ignored for more than a decade it feels good to finally have everyone know the truth . 
  the real travesty here is that this all happened under the un and nato 's watchful eye . 
  it 's great to see all of this finally coming to light . 
   thaci has dismissed the allegations as nonsense . 
  and yet , there is tonne of evidence against the kla , and * him * -- one of the ring leaders at the time . 
  methinks he 's worried about his political career , and rightfully so , especially after the independent investigation a few years back linking thaci to the organ harvesting of serbs in kosovo . 
  keep the evidence coming !, 
  why are you making this about me ? 
  take a step off your moral high horse and relax on the twitch-responses . 
  like i said in my op ,  just to be clear , before people jump on my back : i 'm not condoning violence of any kind , just explaining why i think nikolic did n't refer to it as a genocide . 
  the `` people '' i 'm talking about is you . 
  agreed . 
  the past should n't be dwelled upon , and i 'm also glad he apologized . 
   to say that was not premeditated to say it is a doing of few drunk individuals wielding a knife and a gun , like most people imagine war in balkans is an illusion . 
  this is a blatant strawman . 
  just because it was n't premeditated does n't mean that it was a few drunk individuals wielding knives either . 
  the bosnian serb army was much , much bigger than the muslim one . 
  it is entirely conceivable to think how such an army can do almost anything when compared to its counterpart . 
  most people agree that had oric not done the things he did , that srebrenica never would have happened . 
  that may be hard for you to believe , but i do n't see you defending the logistics of a smaller army pillaging and killing serbs in 50 nearby villages , which seems much more amazing to me than the cool armchair military statistics you have up there . 
  the logistics on both sides are completely believable , and just because srebrenica 's seem extraordinary , does n't mean it was n't a response . 
  he probably did n't call it a genocide because it was n't premeditated . 
  it was n't as if the bosnain serb army decided , `` k , guys , let 's kill all muslims in srebrenica today . '', 
  what happened there was a response to the very same thing srebrenica 's oric did to ~ 50 serb villages and towns around srebrenica , pillaging and raping them and its people . 
  two wrongs do n't make a right , yet only the bosnian serb army 's wrong is the one most people know about today . 
  just to be clear , before people jump on my back : i 'm not condoning violence of any kind , just explaining why i think nikolic did n't refer to it as a genocide . 
  that 's kind of my point . 
  culturally inferior ? 
  economically inferior ? 
  yes . 
  i agree !, 
  this is the first time in a while that i 've been interested in the happenings of a politician in europe . 
  farage seems like such a class act and his face at the last question pretty much says it all . 
  i ca n't wait to see what else she asked him . 
   the point is that farage opposes all immigration to the uk while he himself is a descendent of immigrants . 
  that 's just simply not true . 
  i 'm a neutral observer here , and even i know this is n't the ukip 's or farage 's stance on immigration . 
  i think it 's over the top , and just plain incorrect , but you can feel free to keep it . 
  freedom of speech , and all that jazz . 
  dude , siberia is cold . 
  are n't you cold , bro ? 
  in serbia , many gypsies work and lead fulfulling lives .
