  the vast majority do prefer their own community , however . 
  in any case , had you not painted with such broad strokes , your comment would still be standing today . 
  in the future , here 's a test : if you can replace every instance of the thing you 're talking about with another group of people , like black people , chinese , indians , etc. , and it comes off sounding racist , it probably is . 
  i generally do n't say anything when i remove people 's comments , but i believe that being racist outright was n't your intention , and that you were genuinely contributing to the discussion here . 
  like deusdies said , a minority do n't like what was signed , but on the whole , there were a lot of good things for serbia . 
  the saying `` you ca n't take if you do n't give '' is lost on this minority . 
  as for travelling freely between kosovo and serbia , it 's still a little complicated . 
  i would n't say `` without a hitch '' , but it 's getting there .

  well , sinko , then i hope you post more to balance things out . 
  i 've removed it . 
  to make things faster next time , though , just report it and a mod will pick it up and deal with it . 
  please do n't post stupid image captions . 
  memes are not content . 
  removed . 
  you know , if the balkans were made up of a bunch of siths that would explain a lot of things . 
  i think deusdies is by far the most left-leaning serb on / r/europe ( from what i 've seen ) . 
  for everyone else that posts here , we 're a mixed bag , but if you do n't like something he says call him out on it . 
  have an actual discussion instead of `` fuck off '' . 
  actually , i mod two subreddits . 
  my first love was / r/romance ... but i 've had a hard time promoting it . 
  :( ( shameless plug ! ), 
  i 'm using `` rhetoric '' correctly , but thank you for first assuming that english is n't my first language . 
  that 's awfully kind of you . 
  you 're most definitely using it for persuasive effect , since the `` i 'm not x but ... '' is meant to deflect any criticisms of you being x. secondly , yes you did make blanket generalizations . 
  allow me to point them out for you :  ** they 're ** moving here and then ...  i 'm not racist , but seriously fuck ** these ** people ... 
  if you ca n't see why those are blanket generalizations , then you ca n't be helped . 
  in any case , i 'm not asking you to change your opinion . 
  i 'm asking you to be mindful of the language you choose to use . 
  i do n't think it 's an unreasonable request and it will go a long way toward helping your argument . 
  and at vidovdan . 
  okay , so this comment has been reported and lots of people seem to take issue with it ... 
  here 's my take : you have points to make , ones that are controversial , and that 's fine . 
  keep going . 
  this stuff * should * be talked about . 
  however , you generalize far too much , and use disengenuous rhetoric like :  i 'm not racist , but seriously fuck these people . 
  and for that , people are reporting you , and you can see why . 
  the `` i 'm not x , but fuck y '' is bullshit , and like i said , disengenuous rhetoric . 
  if you 're going to make an argument , actually make one instead of resorting to hateful blanket generalizations . 
  you are correct . 
  i 'm referring to the second-last one . 
  it 's hard to tell the intention , but the graffiti is very clearly talking about serbs . 
  except for the last one that 's calling for the death of vucic . 
  well , perhaps you should have explained yourself in this much detail in your post before , because i now see where you 're coming from . 
  in fact i feel a little silly because i agree 100 % of what you say . 
  we are indeed more corrupt than the western half of europe . 
  but to answer your question of why ... well ... you answered it yourself with :  i do n't give two shits if nikoli\u0107 steals 200000eur from some project that costs 10 million . 
  you 're right about the people being corrupt . 
  however , feel free to toss yourself into that group because you 're part of the reason we ca n't have the checks and balances that other countries have . 
  in canada , there was a prime minister by the name of paul martin who was * suspected * ( i do n't know if he was ever conclusively proven ) of being part of a sponsorship scandal . 
  it ruined his career . 
  most serbian politicians would n't last a day in canada . 
  until we start caring about how our country is run , you can expect to keep bribing those very same people , because like our politicians , they think they 're above the law . 
  and we just seem to be too damn apathetic to do anything about it . 
  do n't get me wrong , though , it 's the pot calling the kettle black because i must admit that i have a certain apathy towards the government as well . 
  personally , i do n't see any solution except time . 
  things get better through natural human progression . 
  i do n't see how a serbia 20 years from now can be any worse than the one today . 
  i really hope you 're joking , on both accounts . 
  the bribing and that the government is just a bunch of regular joes , like you and i. i was in a hospital a few years ago and never experienced any bribing . 
  everyone was quite kind , and very nice . 
  i travel a lot between canada and serbia , and the `` service '' is much better in serbia than canada . 
  as for city hall , my brother loves the political sphere in serbia for some reason , and he 's never experienced anything like that around city hall or * anywhere * really . 
  what part of serbia do you live in ? 
   so saying `` government is corrupt , not the people '' is really stupid , since the two are practically the same . 
  no , i 'm afraid this is really stupid . 
  the saying `` absolute power corrupts absolutely '' immediately comes to mind . 
  and for a very good reason !, 
  serbia is such a gradient of wealth and poverty that those on the top share absolutely nothing with those on the bottom , or in the middle even . 
  i do n't know how you can say that the two are practically the same when they 're objectively not . 
  i can think of dozens of corrupt governments around the world -- would you argue that those governments are the exact same as their people ? 
  it 's a silly argument . 
  why ? 
  our government and political system is what 's corrupt right now , not the people . 
  besides , these are a very small minority in vojvodina -- hooligans -- that spray this kind of stuff . 
  most rational people just want to carry on living their lives in peace . 
  early on in his life you could have debated that , but there really is no debate today . 
  combined with the fact that he mostly wrote in serbian ekavian , became a member of the serbian academy of science and arts ( under which he received the nobel prize ) , and last but not least , that he declard himself to be a serb in 1958 , he is serbian . 
  so , according to andric himself , he is a serb . 
  i recommend ivo andric 's `` the bridge on the drina '' ( unoriginal choice , i know -- cut me some slack ) . 
  it won a nobel prize and is quite an unusual , but interesting read . 
  i recommend it to anyone who has any interest at all in the balkans , or loves myths , legends and folklore . 
  you can have sex with me , if it helps . 
   got chased through the city for being a `` german potato '' my apologies for my ignorance , but is this an actual thing ? 
  calling people potatoes , i mean . 
  is that offensive in germany ? 
  clearly , they must fight to the death . 
  last man standing is president . 
  or they could wait for the official count . 
  that works too . 
  that 's what i said , but perhaps i should have phrased it better . 
  when i say `` close cousin '' , i 'm referring to the fact that they 're both slavic languages who share a developmental history ( see also the [ torlakian group ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torlakian ) of languages ) . 
  i do n't dispute the fact that macedonian is closer to bulgarian than serbian , because it is . 
  only your snarky top-level comment was removed . 
  everything else is okay . 
  i 've removed his top-level comment as the implication was racist ; but taking his other comments to stand on their own , there is nothing inherently racist about them . 
  for example , stuff like :  `` macedonian '' is a slavic dialect with serbian and bulgarian elements . 
  it has nothing to do with the ancient macedonians that spoke greek . 
  is technically correct . 
  macedonian is a close cousin of serbian and shares many similarities with bulgarian .
