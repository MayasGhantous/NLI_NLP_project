  you can only come to that conclusion if you take what i said our of context . 
  also , hello mr. apologist !, 
  been a while . 
  i 'm not defending anyone . 
  i 'm participating in a conversation . 
   now that makes sense , serbians of bosnia wanted to be part of a yugoslavia controlled by serbia while the others did n't . 
  precisely . 
   splitting lands does n't sound like a good idea . 
  i think the land belongs to those who inhabit it and they should try to coexist . 
  scotland is having a referendum . 
  catalonia would like one as well . 
  sometimes coexisting is nice , but not when others want to leave . 
  bosniaks should have let serbs living in bosnia have their land , instead of forcefully taking serbs with them . 
  because they did n't , bosnia is now a failed state . 
   you made it sound as if their religious beliefs are the reasons you guys are separated while you were the ones who wanted to separate in the first place . 
  incorrect . 
  serbs in bosnia did not want to separate , they wanted to stay with yugoslavia . 
  however , since no one was letting up , serbs in bosnia decided to say , * fine , separate , but we 're not coming with you . 
  * this is rather reasonable , is it not ? 
  i think most people would agree . 
  especially with such a large serbian population . 
  the problem was ( and always is in these situations ) what land belonged to the serbs , and what belonged to the bosniaks ? 
  cue , everything else that happened . 
  fair point . 
  perhaps we should re-introduce the mega-threads every now and then after breaking stories . 
  no no , i 've been misunderstood . 
  my fault . 
  i meant that the country that 'd supposed to be depicted is either serbia or italy . 
  the flag there is yugoslavia , though . 
  there is no doubt about it . 
  it ca n't because the colours are blue-white-red not red-white-blue . 
  it 's most likely serbia or italy . 
  looks like yugoslavia . 
  montenegro does n't want to hurt anybody 's feelings and loves us all . 
  irrelevant . 
  you can bring up the exact same argument only reversed . 
  and there was no milo\u0161evic for almost a decade before secession . 
  that 's like having an indigenous north american group declare independence because of transgressions in the past . 
  from the article :  toward evening they went a step further by considering an appeal to moscow and kiev to allow crimea to move toward rejoining russia , the interfax news agency reported . 
  it would appear that rejoining russia is a common thread . 
  i 'm not saying that moscow was n't involved in some capacity , because i do n't pretend to understand geopolitics . 
  however , the term `` annexation '' is clearly forced , and the only reason people throw it around is because of western media . 
   of course , they `` forgot '' that it was actually a historic part of estonia and they were actually immigrants there , despite being a majority now . 
  this logic did not work with kosovo , which used to have a serbian majority . 
  who needs good cheese when you 've got [ the world 's most expensive cheese ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pule_cheese ) ? 
  just kidding . 
  fear not !, 
  when it comes to cheese , [ we 've got your back ] ( http://en.itar-tass.com/economy/746124 ) . 
  why has n't anyone thought of this before ? 
  let 's do it !, 
  flattenning a town implies completely destroying it . 
  i do n't see a single picture , or confirmation of this anywhere . 
  it 'd be very silly for russia to completely destroy a town , so i 'm taking this with a boulder of salt . 
  do n't forget serbia . 
  and http://macedonia.travel, 
  and when he does , you turn into a magnet and always reply to him . 
  if he 's as you say , a troll , then you always get trolled . 
  i 'll try to find a source , but for all i know it could be patriotic blabber . 
  still , it 's very likely . 
  and i did n't list every country because a lot of countries make the stuff . 
  i was trying to get the essence of my comment across . 
  as for the drink being used when someone dies , and that not making a difference ... 
  i 'm sorry but it does . 
  this is what i meant by it being a facet of every part of serbian culture and why some people will consider it a serbian drink . 
   its not serbian though . 
  lolwat plums are serbia 's national fruit , and the damned drink is serbia 's national drink . 
  in fact , serbia is the largest exporter in the world . 
  it has a place in every serbian rite of passage , and you have the audacity to say :  its not serbian though . 
  get out . 
  everyone makes the stuff in slavic/south-east europe , and no one is claiming that serbia invented the stuff . 
  `` slivovitz '' belongs to everyone and anyone -- it 's cross-cultural and a very slavic drink . 
  it 's as much serbian as it is czech , or polish , or what-have-you . 
  however , it 's culturally more important to serbs , than it is to , say , the czechs . 
  i think this is why some people are very elitist about the stuff . 
  thanks to the eu , `` slivovitz '' is now the generic name , and you 'll be able to buy `` serbian '' style or `` czech '' style soon enough . 
  people can then decide what they like better . 
  most people here see it as part of serbia , or at least northern kosovo . 
  even if most people accepted the entirety of kosovo as an independent state , it would still not be the least favourite country for serbia . 
  the foundations of serbian culture were laid there so it 's very hard to hate it . 
  ** favourite : ** montenegro , a.k.a little serbia \u2122 . 
  ** least favourite : ** the majority would vote for albania , probably . 
  fun fact : our parliament building was used as a model for the nexus overwatch building in half-life 2 .

  oh i know . 
  but this thread is about operation storm , and the mass exodus of hundreds of thousands of people . 
  cool links . 
  here 's [ your counterpart ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbs_of_croatia#demographics ) , or in chart form , comparing the two : year | croats in serbia | serbs in croatia -- | --------- | ---------- 1931 | -- | 16.81 % 1948 | 2.6 % | 14.47 2011 | 0.8 % | 4.36 % just stop , okay ? 
  there really is no comparison . 
  oh , i completely agree . 
  i love visiting croatia , but i 'm smart enough to avoid hot spots . 
  we have our own when our meatheads come out of the woodwork , sure , but our larger cities are safe . 
  belgrade , especially . 
  i have two croatian colleagues that have n't had any problems whatsoever . 
  i 'd assume the same is true in zagreb , but even without sporting events , i 've had my car keyed twice , so perhaps i 'm a bit biased . 
  my goal in talking about `` easiness '' was to give an idea of how uncomfortable people actually are with returning to their homes . 
   do n't know where i heard that though . 
  there was a croatian news portal that covered it , and interviewed a few people on it . 
  it was a story on / r/europe a few months ago . 
  croatia 's minister of science and education actually recommended people stay away from the croatian wikipedia .
