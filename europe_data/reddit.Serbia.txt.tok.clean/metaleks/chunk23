  it spurs conspiracy theories when mods fail the community this badly . 
  you 're being downvoted , but this is correct . 
  if someone thinks they 've wrongly been shadowbanned , please contact the team , and we 'll get it sorted out . 
   the mods here are applying for a job with guardian . 
  they commonly censor any article or comment showing islam in a negative light . 
  actually , it was mostly a heavy handed way of dealing with racist posts originally . 
  i do n't agree with the way it was done , as i 'm for removing comments that break the rules instead of entire threads . 
  but as mods , we do n't need to have consensus all the time . 
  and i say originally , because the more legitimate reason was that it was also filling up the front page pretty fast , and every subreddit has a rule against that kind of thing , so we 've consolidated everything into one thread and stickied it here : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/32vw8x/migrants_killed_in_religious_clash_on/ i hope that dispels some of the conspiracy crap . 
   if you think it 's some sort of purgatory on the way to heavenly greater serbia then you are mistaken . 
  greater serbia , lol ? 
  it 's infinitely better than nothing if rs wants to rejoin . 
   yeah how is dayton working out for the rs ? 
  great , actually , from an independence point of view , which was the whole point . 
  the question should be , however , `` how is dayton working out for bosnia ? '', 
  to which , the answer is it 's not , and that bosnia is a failed state because of it . 
  it 's representative of the serbs who did n't want to split from yugoslavia . 
  sounds like a pretty strong case for independence from bosnia , no ? 
   you seem to be misinformed if you think that belgrade had no control in bih during the war . 
  sounds like you 've got a bit of cognitive dissonance going on here . 
  i 'm just going by the icty 's ruling . 
  we ca n't cherry pick and say all serbs are criminals when the icty rules that way , and ignore the icty when they say something else . 
  also , lol , \u0160e\u0161elj . 
   they wanted bosnia to be part of a serb led yugoslavia , which was working out just great . 
  heaven forbid the serbs have a muslim president rule over them , might trigger there ottoman empire ptsd . 
  cool trivialization , bro . 
  however , people have a right to decide their rulers , and if they did n't want a muslim government , then there is nothing wrong with that . 
  just like there is nothing wrong with wanting to continue being a part of yugoslavia . 
  this is plain common sense , and apparently everyone else agrees with this sentiment too , hence the dayton accord , and rs 's existence . 
   his fair points are flawed . 
  nobody is taking away there land . 
  and what i said :  serbs in bosnia did not want bosnia to split from yugoslavia . 
  this is pretty much the definition of taking away land . 
  also , you say ,  there was a referendum held but bosnian serbs largely boycotted the referendum or were prevented by bosnian serb authorities from participating . 
  holy moly misinformation !, 
  the referendum was a joke and completely ignored the ** first ** referendum in which ** serbs voted to stay within yugoslavia with a result of 98 % ** . 
  rs came from this referendum !, 
  [ source . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnian_serb_referendum,_1991 ) the second referendum , and the one you 're referring to , was boycotted by serbs because it completely ignored the serbs ' wish to stay within yugoslavia , and would have overrode the first referendum bringing rs back into bosnia . 
  i 'm sorry , but that 's joke , and anybody in that position would have boycotted it . 
  with a situation like this , this is exactly what i 'm talking about when i say that the international community should have stepped in , and moderated things . 
  instead , things were left to the balkans instead , until the west came to their senses and granted independence to rs , and ended the issue ... kind of . 
  the icty cleared the state of serbia of any wrongdoing , so i do n't know what you 're going on about . 
  besides , since you keep alluding to the srebrenica genocide , you do realize that it was a separate and independent paramilitary group that did that right ? 
  the first paragraph from [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/srebrenica_massacre ) :  ... a paramilitary unit from serbia known as the scorpions , officially part of the serbian interior ministry ** until 1991 ** , participated in the massacre , along with several hundred ukrainian and russian volunteers . 
  the massacre happened in ** 1995 ** . 
  you seem to be misinformed by western media , and falling for the `` herp derp serbia is evil '' story . 
  so tell me again , what bosnian genocide is serbia responsible for exactly ? 
  i took some time to write this up . 
  see my comment [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/31qvuh/albania_and_kosovo_to_unite_inside_eu_or_not/cq4e1s0 ) . 
  things are n't nearly as black and white as you make them . 
  serbs in bosnia did not want bosnia to split from yugoslavia . 
  they pleaded with them over and over not to do that , and that we 'd fight for land if that were the case . 
  bosnia 's constitution at the time dictated ( and still dictates ) that decisions like this need the bosnian vote , croatian vote , and serbian vote . 
  yet , this was ignored , the serbian population was ignored , laws were broken , and the civil way to handle bosnia splitting from yugoslavia went out the window . 
  the question could have been how much land to give yugoslavia , but bosnia wanted it all . 
  you could argue that serbia also wanted more than bosnia was willing to give , but the point is that there was _ still _ a chance of dialogue . 
  would it have been fair for serbia to take the majority of land ? 
  probably not . 
  then why the hell is it fair for bosnia to take everything ? 
  it 's not . 
  hence , the reason for rs 's existence . 
  we * really * could have used some help from the international community before things went to shit , but oh well . 
  if kosovo sets a precedent joining albania , there is no reason why rs should n't join back with serbia . 
  ( in fact , there is no reason now , and rs 's politicians talk about it all the time . ), 
  i 'm just tired of having serbia painted as the bad guy when in reality everyone was pretty shitty during the wars . 
  you do n't need to be serbian to see the truth in that . 
   i 'm not the well read on why is it that his trial out of all trials that ever occured went on for so long . 
  why he is such a major catch is beyond me . 
  he intimidated all of his witnesses . 
  that 's literally it . 
  almost every single expert was * literally * discredited in some way against him , by * him * . 
  he 's fiercely intelligent . 
  as for why he 's a `` big deal '' ... he is n't . 
  media loves to stir shit up . 
  nobody in serbia cares . 
   there would have been no justice at all . 
  just for reference , who were some that you feel were worse than seselj and were not indicted from croatian side ? 
  i 'm sure there were some , just are there any in particular ? 
  the ones most recently `` released '' . 
  croatian leaders have done much worse than him and gotten off the hook . 
  seselj has done much less , even though , sure , if you want to put _ some _ blame on him , go ahead . 
  the courts are a joke anyway . 
  because i 'd argue that he was n't a reason for things turning to shit anywhere . 
  you 're using him as a scapegoat , which he should n't be . 
   correct me if i misinterperated , but those three words leave little else to conclude . 
  you misinterpreted . 
   if you call him making obscene remarks involving sucking cock intelligent , well ... 
  he has his moments , sure . 
  he 's said a lot more than just that , though , and you know it . 
   but he did help create a breeding ground for hatred and nationalism that led to expulsion of croats and other non-serbs from parts of vojvodina and croatia . 
  oh , the irony ... 
  pretty much . 
  all these years , and still not a single indictment proven . 
  and there never will be . 
  he has some amazing videos on youtube of him completely dressing down his accusers . 
  i wish a lot of it was subbed so more people can see just how fiercely intelligent he is , and how he 's been able to defend himself this long . 
  criticize if you want , just do n't be a douchebag with insults and no substance . 
  with that said , i wo n't remove any of your comments because the community has spoken and made an example out of you , / u/jms3r . 
  thanks for making / r/europe a better place !,
