  cool story , but we are n't talking about \u0160e\u0161elj . 
  bosnia wanted to separate . 
  serbs in bosnia did n't . 
  today , we have republika srpska . 
  by the same token , croatia wanted to separate , and the serbs in croatia did n't want to . 
  rinse and repeat . 
  this was n't an opportunistic land grab . 
   what i am trying to say is . 
  out of a family of let 's say 5 people 4 did not participate in any looting of other crimes . 
  source ? 
  oh wait , there is none . 
  you want to know the real reason people are n't coming back ? 
  for the same reason [ ** a black guy got beat up in croatia for wearing a shirt with an eagle on it , mistaken for a serbian symbol . 
  when brought to the attention of the police , the police said it was * their fault *** . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/27sf1p/attacked_in_split/ ) this is the reason . 
  as someone who travels a fare bit , i can tell you , * in general * , that it 's easier being a croat in serbia , than it is a serb in croatia . 
  that 's the way the cookie crumbles . 
  they were civlians like you and i , living there since the 15th century . 
  i 'd be willing to bet that 99 % of them have never even picked up a gun . 
  the serbs in krajina were only interested in their territory ; to even suggest they were triying to `` completely obliterate '' the other group is laughable , but i 'll concede everything else you say , because you 're right . 
   the only difference is that it is within croatia 's borders ( as defined in 1941 ) and the croat forces did it second/last and by that time , most of the serb population had evacuated . 
  and as long as we 're listing differences , here 's one more : in today 's krajina , the majority of the 200,000 people who have been living there for genereations since the 15th century , have still not come back . 
  borders from 1941 be damned , as they 're irrelevant in this context . 
  they * lived * there . 
  yay , all those ** 200,000 + ** serb civilians who had to leave * and still * have n't come back !, 
  of course , on paper , they 're welcome to return , but everyone should ask themselves why they are n't . 
   i am getting the feeling you think rs deserves more territory . 
  i never said such a thing . 
  stop projecting . 
   would bih be a more stable and united country ? 
  no , it would n't . 
  the balkans are a cluserfuck . 
  i 'm telling you that the current borders did n't come from thin air . 
  no , they did n't shoot themselves but they also had nothing to do with the territory . 
  these are the pre-dayton territorial claims and post-dayton results for the bosnian serbs . 
  the borders are based on previous territorial claims . 
  rs was n't carved out of genocide . 
  you 're croatian , you should know this . 
  rs would merge with serbia , not exist as a microstate . 
   is it really something that is being discussed ? 
  ever since the dayton accord . 
   would an independent rs have any interest in just merging with serbia ? 
  rs would merge with serbia . 
  there would be no separate republic . 
  aside from being the birthplace of a bunch of roman emperors , serbia was also home of the vin\u010da culture around 6000-4000 bc . 
  there are also signs of settlement in and [ around belgrade from that time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vin%c4%8da-belo_brdo ) , which makes belgrade pretty old . 
  thanks for sharing , and for including all of europe . 
   why not ? 
  just a bit of dark serbian humour . 
  do n't take the op too seriously . 
   [ i love belgrade too . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zu_tkk9be0 ), 
  geographically speaking , anyone that 's a citizen of a european country is by definition european . 
  so yes , i would . 
  what 's the problem with being , say , scottish first , and european second ? 
  we had a previous thread from the guardian [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2c15o1/senior_kosovo_figures_face_prosecution_for_crimes/ ) , but the more press the better . 
  serbs have been saying these things for years ; it 's nice to get independent validation . 
  this , however  former leaders of the k.l.a. 
  occupy high posts in the government , and the extent to which they will cooperate with investigations remains unclear . 
  remains a travesty . 
  i ca n't think of a more joyous people . 
  i mean , for crying out loud , people were out dancing in the streets during the nato bombing . 
  not only are we joyous , but our resolve is pretty unbreakable ( read : really stubborn ) . 
  the constitutional script is cyrillic in serbia , but latin letters can be used too , interchangeably . 
  croatia 's constitutional script is latin , but in areas with a large serbian population , cyrillic is also used . 
  [ kind of ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_anti-cyrillic_protests_in_croatia ) . 
  i said it was not guilty with regards to a very specific thing . 
  yes . 
   the op is right when he says there 's still a `` we did nothing wrong '' mentality among serbs . 
  never said he was n't . 
  but he was n't explicit either which is why i assumed he was talking about the state . 
   also , what you said regarding the court is false . 
  it 's a mixed bag . 
  what you 're referring to is :  serbia has violated the obligation to prevent the srebrenica genocide ; serbia has violated its obligations under the genocide convention by having failed to transfer ratko mladi\u0107 to icty ; serbia has violated its obligation to comply with the provisional measures ordered by the court however , the court also found the following :  the court affirms that it has jurisdiction ; serbia has not committed genocide ; serbia has not conspired to commit genocide , nor incited the commission of genocide ; serbia has not been complicit in genocide ; [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnian_genocide_case ), 
   no im not holding the state of serbia responsible , because it did not exist at the time . 
  im holding the serb leadership of the yna and yugoslavia responsible for what they have done in the name of the serb people . 
  that very same government has been cleared by the icj , so if you want to continue holding grudges feel free . 
   the discussion was about republika srpska and it 's right to leave the federation look at this map and tell yeah it 's fair to succeed . 
  how many of the people have returned to there former homes , or even had change to return ? 
  you can say the exact same thing about serbs that used to live in croatia or parts that are n't part of republika srpska . 
  by your logic , i sure hope you were also against kosovo seceding . 
  op talked about serbs , and not bosnian serbs . 
  you 're obviously alluding to srebrenica , in which case you should realize that the icj * absolved the state of serbia of any crimes * . 
  so why exactly are * you * holding the state of serbia responsible if the world is n't ? 
  the bosnian serbs have lived in bosnia for generations as well , so i 'm not sure what you 're getting at . 
  perhaps , but you should know that many people hold his opinion , actually . 
  i quite like ours because it 's very melodical . 
  however , by far the most ** evil and powerful ** sounding anthem in the world is [ montenegro 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ic-3mmekym ) . 
  it sounds awesome . 
  are you seriously trying to define someone else 's identity ? 
  something serbs have been saying for * years * now . 
  i 'm glad that it 's all coming to light now . 
  57 % of our male population lost in ww1 . 
  i never knew that the white house recognized serbia in such a fashion . 
  what an incredibly kind gesture . 
   r/europe should be a club for people living in nations within the european union . 
  in reality its a club for people who support federalization , closer eonomic integration and support neoliberal policy . 
   ... you 're advocating an echo chamber ... there is no easier way to slip into intellectual decadence . 
  i 'd rather / r/europe not stagnate , thanks .
