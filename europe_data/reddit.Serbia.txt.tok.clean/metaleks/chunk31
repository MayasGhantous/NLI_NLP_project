  however , with that said , three recent pieces of news : * you can now see / r/europe 's traffic stats [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/about/traffic/ ) . 
  * thanks to some of your suggestions , starting next week we are introducing two new weekly series . 
  the first one , round table , is a weekly poll and serious discussion on a relevent topic of interest . 
  the polls will always be very short , just asking for nationality and your stance on the topic at hand . 
  but more importantly , while the discussion is happening , the poll 's results will always be viewable and hopefully this will add some flair to the discussion . 
  this thread will run every monday , and the first topic will be scotland 's independence . 
  topics are chosen by users in / r/europe 's irc channel ( information in the sidebar ) . 
  * the second one , melting pot friday , is silly and just for fun . 
  posted every friday , it 's a light-hearted and general discussion thread where you are encouraged to post in your native tongue . 
  for those of you studying another language , it could be a good way to practice what you know !, 
  thanks once again to everyone who participated !, 
  greetings , and welcome to the first ever / r/europe round table !, 
  every monday , a new topic of interest is debated and discussed in detail . 
  while this is happening , users can vote in a very short poll about that topic . 
  the polls remain open for about a week , and close shortly before the next round table topic . 
  all results are live , and viewable at any time . 
  the idea is to paint the community 's opinion on a particular topic . 
  if the discourse in the thread changes your mind about something , it 's encouraged that you update your thoughts accordingly on the poll . 
  while the goal is to see what the community thinks , it 's also a great opportunity to learn . 
  topics are selected by the good folks over in / r/europe 's irc channel ( information in the sidebar ) . 
  if you have an idea for a topic , feel free to drop by and let us know !, 
  this week 's topic is scotland 's independence .

  welcome to the first melting pot friday !, 
  a fun and silly weekly thread . 
  every friday , we post in our native tongues or in any other language that is n't english . 
  there is no overall topic , so feel free to talk about whatever you want !, 
  it 's also a pretty good opportunity to see how well you know another language . 
  and if you only know english , well , then i suppose that 's what you 'll have to use . 
  this week 's round table topic , as chosen by the irc users of #europe , will be eu foreign policy regarding israel . 
  if you have an idea for a topic next week , feel free to drop by and let us know !, 
  if you are new to the round table , every monday we discuss a relevant and interesting topic , while also polling the users of / r/europe for their opinion . 
  the idea is to paint the community 's opinion on a particular topic . 
  if the discourse in the thread changes your mind about something , it 's encouraged that you update your thoughts accordingly on the poll . 
  while the goal is to see what the community thinks , it 's also a great opportunity to learn . 
  ** most recent piece of news : ** * [ israel blocks eu aid to west bank palestinians ] ( http://www.voanews.com/content/reuters-israel-blocks-eu-aid-to-west-bank-palestinians/1710759.html ) [ take the poll ] ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1geo9lke_paendy1_oobi4c4g84mit7urqnikbumaytw/viewform ) | [ view results ] ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1geo9lke_paendy1_oobi4c4g84mit7urqnikbumaytw/viewanalytics ) | [ csv ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0aper9ltkdyh-ddhnvmnsvwxavg1wtwfydvcxohbhugc#gid=0 ), 
  same rules like last time . 
  talk about whatever you want using any language you want ... although a language other than english is encouraged . 
  hello , and welcome to this week 's round table !, 
  this week , as chosen by you , the uk and its ban on online porn . 
  recently , prime minister david cameron has come under fire for his stance on online pornography . 
  the majority of uk-based isps that provide internet access to almost 90 % of uk homes , have agreed on having `` family-friendly '' internet filters . 
  when asked for his reasoning , he was quoted saying , `` this is , quite simply , about how we protect children and their innocence . '', 
  he further went on to say , `` put simply -- what you ca n't get in a shop , you will no longer be able to get online . '', 
  the filters , while optional , still have privacy-oriented groups such as the org ( open rights group ) worried . 
  in addition to the filters , it will be illegal to possess rape porn , and according to the org , the filters will [ likely be extended to include ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/29/uk-internet-filter-block-more-than-porn_n_3670771.html ) `` violent material '' , `` extremist and terrorist related content '' , `` anorexia and eating disorder websites , '' and `` suicide related websites . '', 
  websites that mention alcohol or smoking , and other esoteric material will also be censored . 
  whether or not you live in the uk , is this something to be concerned about ? 
  is this the start of a heavily government-controlled internet , or are we just being paranoid ? 
  after all , apparently this will all have an off switch .

  welcome to another melting pot friday !, 
  same rules like last time -- talk about whatever you want in whatever language you want ( although something other than english is preferred ) . 
  it 's that time of week again !, 
  where we pretend you 're on your country 's subreddit , and not on / r/europe by only posting in your native tongue . 
  ... and if english is all you know , well , that 'll have to do . 
  while discussions are usually free-form ( they 'll stay that way ) , this week if you have a * funny commercial * to share , please do !, 
  it 's that time of week again , where nobody uses english and the thread reads like someone nuked the tower of babel . 
  it 's melting pot friday !, 
  same rules like last time , you 're encouraged to post in your native tongue * but * if english is all you know , it 'll have to do . 
  every week we try to have a theme . 
  you do n't have to talk about it , but if you do n't know what else to say , it could be a good start . 
  last week 's was funny commercials , ** this week it 's jokes ** . 
  looking forward to some really good ones . 
   have fun !, 
  it 's that time of week again , where nobody uses english and the thread reads like someone nuked the tower of babel . 
  it 's melting pot friday !, 
  same rules like last time , you 're encouraged to post in your native tongue but if english is all you know , it 'll have to do . 
  this week 's theme is all about ** cursing ** . 
  so , get out there and give me your country 's worst . 
  ^ ^ ^ alternative ^ ^ ^ theme ^ ^ ^ title : ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ serbian ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ romanian ^ ^ ^ language . 
  it 's that time of week again , where nobody uses english and the thread reads like someone nuked the tower of babel . 
  it 's melting pot friday !, 
  same rules like last time , you 're encouraged to post in your native tongue but if english is all you know , it 'll have to do . 
  this week 's theme , is ** music ** !, 
  so , share the best of what your country has to offer . 
   it would be nice if we could avoid anything that 's sung in english ( unless you 're british ) . 
  so anything from traditional songs everybody in your country knows , to some obscure pop song you love is game !, 
  ( note : i 'm also going to make a request due to the nature of this particular topic : if you see that someone with your country 's flair already posted a song , hit reply instead of posting normally . 
  this way we can group languages , and it 'll make things easier to browse . 
  you do n't have to follow this , but it would make everyone 's life a lot easier . ), 
  it 's that time of week again , where nobody uses english and the thread reads like someone nuked the tower of babel . 
  it 's melting pot friday !, 
  same rules like last time , you 're encouraged to post in your native tongue , but feel free to use english too . 
  this week 's theme , is ** movies/films from your country !, 
  ** due to the nature of this particular topic , try not to recommend something for which you know * no subtitles * exist . 
  if you 're not sure , a cursory glance at any online subtitle database will give you an idea . 
  contest mode is enabled for this topic , so everyone 's recommendations get equal exposure . 
  ( side note : i 've been receiving a few pms with people liking the one country per top-level comment , so while it 's not enforced , if you could follow that , it would be great . 
  * a whole bunch * of you also complained about american top-level comments `` sharing '' their culture , and i 'm inclined to agree to an extent . 
  reddit is american and we 're all exposed to american culture on a regular basis . 
  this series is supposed to be a nice break from all that while learning something about our fellow neighbours . 
  with that said , it would be appreciated if our american friends could be a little more mindful of this fact . 
  if i get more pms or it becomes a huge issue , then barring a huge backlash , i will be removing top-level american comments in all future threads . ), 
  cheers !, 
  it 's that time of week again , where nobody uses english and the thread reads like someone nuked the tower of babel . 
  it 's melting pot friday !, 
  same rules like last time : it 's * strongly encouraged * to post in your native tongue but if english is all you know , it 'll have to do . 
  this week 's theme is ** shit your countrymen say ** . 
  whether good , bad , or just downright hilarious , share some of your country 's more common sentiments !,
