  here 's a crazy thought , how about / r/europe be for * europeans * , and that includes every pro-eu opinion and negative eu opinion . 
  it 's a shame you did n't include serbia in your comparison !, 
  we 've [ effectively doubled our gdp in the last 10 years ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_serbia#macroeconomic_trends ) . 
  thanks so much for sharing this . 
  not only because of the lovely paintings , but for that site , which i had no idea existed . 
  it also kind of makes me sad because slavic mythology is just so chock full of interesting and unique things , that i wish more media would draw inspiration from it . 
  do n't get me wrong , i love our current western dragons and knights tropes , but how cool would it be to have more books and movies be about those paintings ? 
  many things . 
  * the pillaging and destruction of dozens serbian villages . 
  * the raping and killing of many serbs in said villages . 
  * the un designation that srebrenica was a safe zone , something both sides agreed to , both the bosnian serbs and bosniaks ... but that the latter abused , retreating to every time they commited an atrocity , because they knew they could n't be touched there . 
  * the way the un ignored the cries of the bosnian serbs and bosnian serb army every single time this happened . 
  i should n't have to say that i do n't condone killing -- * no matter what the reason * -- but it 's not farfetched to see how a group ( the scorpions , in this case ) would take things into their own hands after a while , and do the things they did in srebrenica . 
  the bosnian war is n't nearly as black and white as some people would have us believe . 
  if you 're interested in this topic , there is a fantastic movie called izdani grad ( betrayed city ) , that an independent norwegian journalist directed . 
  highly recommended . 
  i wish that logic was true for us . 
  we lost over 25 % of our population in wwi . 
  no , it 's also happening in serbia . 
   a new monument to princip is also due to go up in the serbian capital , belgrade , where children are taught that he was struggling for a just cause . 
  serbia will be minting a silver coin with his face on it to mark the centenary , and the government will stage exhibitions . 
  just a heads up to op . 
  since , someone has posted the article behind the paywall in the comments , this post can stay up . 
  but in the future , try not to submit them . 
  the first one 's tone is crude and a tad offensive , so there 's that . 
  the second one shows a disregard for human life , and suggests that as a possible solution . 
  if you 're ever in doubt when writing a comment , imagine what would happen to a politician 's career if he read what you wrote . 
  in both of these instances , he would n't have one anymore , or would be resigned to the fringes . 
  you really can rephrase each of these to get your point across in a nicer way . 
  this is a valid concern , however let me assuage your fears . 
  the method being incorporated does n't solely rely on what people say , so much as how new they are to reddit along with other factors . 
  i believe / u/aschebescher is going to make a post about this soon . 
  i 've had a nice discussion with you in pms so i think you get it now . 
  but since you want an example , i already linked one earlier with [ the link here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25is4z/italy_demands_help_threatens_to_release_refugees/chibgbu ) in my last post . 
  those are actually some of the things you 've said . 
  some of my ideas can be considered `` right wing '' , but i do n't like labels as i 'm generally all over the place . 
  all fair points . 
  fyi there is something really `` proactive '' being brewed right now . 
  i wo n't go into the details , but it 's very heavy handed and should cut down on the racism significantly . 
  i need to ask , so for all of your apparent outrage , it 's never occurred to you to click the report button ? 
  those posts have been removed now , but you 'd save time and effort on everyone 's part if you just clicked `` report '' . 
  the deleted comment you linked i removed a long time ago because * someone clicked the report button * . 
  perhaps it was you ? 
  also , the reason he has n't been banned was because i gave him a warning [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25is4z/italy_demands_help_threatens_to_release_refugees/chibgbu ) about a week ago . 
  so yes , we 're well aware of him . 
  i 've sent him a pm , and if he continues , he 's gone . 
   now , i do n't know why the moderators have n't been throwing out bans left , right , and centre ( and often do n't even delete such comments ) given they 're explicitly against the rules . 
  we do . 
  report what you see , and not only will the comment get removed , but they might also get banned . 
  there 's more than 50k people on this subreddit right now , and unless the community takes an active part , those comments are n't going to go away so easily . 
  the same way [ most european countries ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alveolar_trill ) do . 
  however , what 's unique here is that while it 's not a vowel , it carries some vowel-like properties . 
  it 's why words like * smrtnik * ^ \\ [ mortal \\ ] are very easy to say , and why it seems like gymnastics for your tongue for everyone else . 
  i think the majority of serbs think of russia in a positive light . 
  they might not agree with everything russia does , but they most certainly hold them in high regard . 
  i know all of these things , as i 'm canadian as well as serbian . 
   you 're right , my argument was mostly that of identity . 
  this is n't unique to the balkans , this applies to all of humanity . 
  herzegovina is significant , the way acadia is to acadians . 
  you ca n't take that away from them and call it `` just '' quebec . 
  absolutely correct , and with good reason . 
  the russians were the first to respond sending rescuers . 
  there is no justice in people losing lives . 
  congratulations , you 're a tool . 
  post removed . 
  there is a link the header that also has this information , now . 
  this seems to be confirmation bias more than anything else . 
  farage began listing off idiots in other parties twice in that interview before he was cut off . 
  every party in * every country * has them . 
  seeing more in the ukip is nothing but confirmation bias . 
  also , maybe it 's just me , but i found the interviewer to be extremely rude and fishing for `` victories '' . 
  for example , farage clearly meant that he felt a little uncomfortable being on a train where he could n't understand anything or anyone , because there was no english . 
  and the guy asks if he had a problem with other languages ? 
  please . 
  if he was put in the middle of a slovak village or wherever else , the interviewer would have felt the same agitation . 
  this is not racist . 
  farage brilliantly counters that his kids speak german so this truly does n't bother him , and yet , the interviewer does n't get it and asks if his kids make him feel uncomfortable . 
  this interview is absolutely ridiculous . 
  all of the interrupting , and inane bullshit talked about made this really hard to watch . 
  if you 're going to interview/debate farage , at least talk about what he/his party intends to do or his stances on topics of interest , not irrelevant minutiae . 
  most villages are poor , and have houses built sporadically across hilly landscapes . 
  completely agree . 
  it 's certainly rude , but if anyone is actually curious , the [ linked image from the op ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f9c2yub.jpg ) is actually what villages ( \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430 ) look like in serbia . 
  i think it 's nice having them here every now and then . 
  hu-mons just do n't understand . 
  just a heads up ... you 're flirting with xenophobia . 
  most of your comments can stay , as differences in opinion are encouraged . 
  but when you write shit like this ,  one day you 'll wake up with a kebab sticking out of your ass and be like `` why are you doing this to me '' . 
  or  no we 'll shoot their damn raft to kingdom come and we wo n't need prisons . 
  it 's going to get removed . 
  continue posting this garbage , and you might get banned . 
  consider this a fair warning . 
  please do n't drag us into this because of op . 
  when it comes to gdp , and average wage , we literally have nowhere to go but up . 
  the last [ 15 years or so ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_serbia ) have been very kind to us ( even if you take the recession into account ) , and i think if you take the last 10 years or so , next to poland , serbia has experienced the most growth in europe . 
  yes and no . 
  yes , in that we have our own set of crazy people , no in that there is no geographic separation . 
  they 're evenly spread out . 
  you 're just as likely to find a nutjob in belgrade as you are in ni\u0161 . 
  big business is n't conducted in a small currency like us dollars , or euros .
