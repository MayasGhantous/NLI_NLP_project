  not sure if the latter is true ... 
  it 's really more of an indifference . 
  i have met very few people who actually * dislike * russia . 
  i never denied collaborations . 
  i only denied the level of comparison , let me quote :  to claim that the chetniks were nazi collaborators ** like the ** ustase ... meaning on the same level . 
  yes , i know all of this . 
  i only really had issues with you equivocating the level of nazi collaboration between the two groups . 
  i 'm not supporting any side . 
  i 'm just pointing out a very big false comparison . 
  you make it sound very one-sided when it was anything but . 
  and yes , i expected international law to be followed , but * geopolitics * . 
   like usta\u0161e in croatia , chetniks were nazi collaborators , and as such are historically `` on the wrong side '' . 
  what ... you 're kidding right ? 
  to claim that the chetniks were nazi collaborators like the ustase , is laughable . 
  only one of the groups were aligned with the nazis . 
  stop being a revisionist . 
  for anybody that 's curious , [ here is the wikipedia article for ustase ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usta%c5%a1e ) for your perusal . 
  and [ here is the one for chetniks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chetniks ) . 
  even a simple search for `` nazi '' on either page will show you that / u/huntruder38 is full of it . 
  that 's incorrect . 
  `` crimes against humanity '' took place against both sides , ** years ago ** . 
  when kosovo declared independence , nothing of the sort was going on , and had n't been for years . 
  everything will be okay , i promise . 
  i think it 's almost a winter olympics tradition now for something to break during the opening . 
   regardless , absolutely stunning intro . 
  i was floored . 
  ... i 'm so sorry . 
  yes , it can actually take 5 minutes , but i gave a very good reason for the delay , and hopefully an even better one soon .

  it will be added in 5 months time . 
  poor / u/raerth . 
  that 's not too much of a problem because we also ask where they 're more active : / r/europe , or their country 's subreddit . 
  so we can weigh answers based on that . 
  last survey it was the belgians , this survey , the poles ... 
  the former had the survey linked on / r/belgium , the latter ... well , i 'm not sure what 's up with poland this time around . 
  in any case , we 'll probably end up involving sister subreddits , / r/sweden , / r/greece , etc. 
  in the next survey . 
  bigger sample size , and unless it gets posted on uk 's subreddit , it wo n't be really dominated by any one group . 
   hi chris , i am a siamese triplet with three heads . 
  now we 've got a hair on the genitals . 
  whose is it ? 
  i do n't even ... 
  thanks , that means a lot . 
  i 'll make sure to credit you tomorrow in particular , friend . 
  you ca n't use that . 
  i 've copyrighted it . 
  make sure to always add a ^ \\ ( c \\ ) ^ / u/metaleks ^ 2014 . 
  thanks . 
  it was stickied for a little over two weeks . 
  it ran from the last week of december and ended january 7th/8th . 
  you 're right , however , i only have to do this thing once : i can just copy and paste it for future surveys . 
  although , you have my word that if i do n't release it tomorrow , i 'll just release the the regular results instead . 
  tomorrow . 
  sorry for the delay . 
  i should have just done that instead of delaying 3 weeks , dammit . 
  i can always release pretty stuff later . 
  live and learn . 
  what a nice little tour you put together . 
  [ jooooooojjjjj !,

  the large serb population did n't want to split when bosnian secession began becoming more and more a thing that was going to happen . 
  international powers should have been brought in there and then . 
  sure . 
  i intentionally cleared all plans this weekend to get this thing out . 
  sure . 
  i intentionally cleared all plans this weekend to get this thing out . 
  i 'm putting you in the credits . 
  i 'm serious . 
  1.9 % is massive . 
  this is n't some paltry amount : 1.9 % growth of * billions of pounds * is quite a lot . 
  i like the motivation you give me . 
  keep going . 
  i 'm well-aware of that . 
  we have a thread [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1vyaa6/euromaidan_thread_1_discussionslinks_regarding/ ) for updates of this kind . 
   why do the serbs want back a province with a huge majority of albanians ? 
  would an acceptable compromise to serbians perhaps be , like in our history , a plebiscite which would return the serb majority areas to serbia ? 
  or a greater deal of autonomy for kosovo-serbs ? 
  it 's more complicated . 
  kosovo was already an autonomous province . 
  but i think as time goes on , the compromise you mention at the end is probably the way things will happen . 
  the problem is that the current government in kosovo does n't want this to happen for some reason . 
  in my mind , this is the * only * solution . 
  also , thanks for the small history lesson for denmark . 
  it 's actually good to know . 
  nuh-uh , you started it !, 
  it is n't a debate because you 're the biggest icj parrot i 've ever witnessed . 
  i shudder to think if the icj should vanish , how you would stumble through the dark , afraid now that someone is n't telling you what to think . 
  the thought of having holding your own opinion must frighten you . 
  there , there . 
  cheers . 
   that is your statement in this debate . 
  hardly in line with you being for kosovo 's independence ... 
  please try to keep your train of thought at least somewhat coherent . 
  this is n't a debate and that was said in context with the consistency thing i brought up . 
  things are n't going to seem coherent if you take them out of context . 
   nato  serbia never going to happen . 
   could you tell us what proof was actually provided and some things about op 's position ? 
  it 's not that i do n't trust you / u/metaleks , but i have no idea who you are . 
  for all intents and purposes you 're just as alien to me as op is . 
  fair enough .
