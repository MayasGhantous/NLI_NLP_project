i find this post quite ironic considering it was posted by an american . 
  croatia cereal !, 
  wow , i did n't know about this spot . 
  i 'll be there next time i visit tara for sure . 
  thanks op for the beautiful picture !, 
  this is cool . 
  as a matter of fact , i 'll put this on my to-do-before-i-die list . 
  you are a sick bastard , sir . 
  she 's cute, 
  i am offensive and i find this serbian . 
  that sounds awfully like something that a croatian ultranationalist would claim . 
  to say that jasenovac is an insane theory speaks for itself . 
  but what do i know . 
  downvote me all you want , but that does n't change the fact that the only reason croatia even exists in a form that it does today , is because of its nazi roots . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jasenovac_concentration_camp sadly that happened . 
  thanks , but is n't it a bit early for easter ? 
  or am i missing something ? 
  there is really no need for me to refute anything , as you are obviously arguing against something that has been established as factual . 
  good day to you sir . 
  genius . 
  you are a special kind of stupid , ai n't ya . 
  `` serbia , officially the republic of serbia , is a sovereign state situated at the crossroads between central and southeast europe , covering the southern part of the pannonian plain and the central balkans . '', 
  google harder , i guess ? 
  no , it is not . 
  it 's south -- east europe . 
  not really looking to debate over something that is a fact, 
  it is as much as us is south america, 
  eastern europe ? 
  lol, 
  yes and it sucks big time . 
  but at least horror movies enthusiasts get an appropriate atmosphere, 
  more like winter in 99 % of european countries . 
  with bombs ? 
  umm , no . 
  but she was around 11 when the war started and she was married that young o_o ? 
  so what , sh * t happens ya know :d, 
  and here we are in serbia complaining about our pm who somehow managed to take 51 % of all of the votes , magically i assume . 
  nice, 
  the only way to achieve our political goals is through comedy , just look at israel . 
  you know you want it , 
  good for you guys . 
  serbia led block *, 
  is he talking about the berlin wall ? 
  do n't beat yourself up too much buddy . 
  you 'll get it right next time . 
  i would have preferred if you said `` end of speech '' as opposed to `` end of rant '' . 
  would have been epic !, 
  but . . you blew it . . end of speech, 
  for some i read that comment in the voice of [ csgo tr ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cit3kh3-zpk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6m48s ) . 
  yeah exactly . 
  ca n't be a nazi without a classy uniform made by hugo boss . 
  i 'm actually mirko_s . 
  oh i should have been more obvious . 
  most of that comment was me being sarcastic . 
  i honestly ca n't influence or change views of some people from my country and they are a vocal minority , so it 's not much of a concern for me . 
  i honestly hope that you 'll be able to meet normal and average people from my country and realize that we do n't really hate anyone ( except for croats , bosniaks , albanians , americans , brits , the french , belgians , swedes , turks , italians and perhaps slovenians ? 
  i 'm not sure about that one ) ^ obviously . 
  ^ ^ ^ pls . 
  ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ take . 
  ^ ^ ^ that . 
  ^ ^ ^ comment . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ too . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ seriously . 
  aww . 
  i love you . 
  do n't worry , papa mirko_s will protect you from the internet meanies from serbia . 
   on a more serious note , you do n't have to believe me . 
  as you 've said , your comment is just that - a single comment . 
  your opinion is essentially meaningless and has no influence on my or any of my fellow countrymen 's lives . 
  statistically speaking , most people that converge to * those * types of videos and leave * those * comments are either physically 12 year old ( meaning they are literally 12 year old turdballs ) or they are mentally 12 year old . 
  either way , they are not representative of the popular opinion in serbia . 
   well slovenia did very well in the eu . 
  i think croatia is more comparable to slovakia , hungary and so on ... 
  the economy is not horrible but far from being as good as the eu average . 
  slovenia is not a balkan state . 
  secondly , i do n't really think it 's fair to say that croatia is comparable to say hungary or even slovenia . 
  i do agree that croatia is better off than serbia economically though . 
  as for us serbs , i do n't see us joining the eu any time soon and i 'd hope it would stay that way , now that most of the founding members are either leaving or planning to leave . 
  you ca n't seriously judge a country by comments made by 12 year olds , now can you ? 
  i mean if that was the case , i 'd think us was the new third reich . 
  well i assure you that nobody in serbia says that bullshit . 
  the only type of people i can think of saying that kind of stuff would be football hooligans . 
  oddly enough i agree with you completely , as a matter of fact , i 'm actually surprised that bulgaria , romania and croatia are even part of the eu , or even were considered to be invited to join in the first place . 
  i think most , if not all of balkan countries have a mentality that completely and utterly clashes with that of the west . 
  i very much doubt that , given that you 're a croatian and i do n't really see many croatians in serbia . 
  also , citation needed . 
  we 're coming for ya !, 
  that is n't really true . 
  i never heard anyone say that kind of nonsense here . 
  alan turing is the only british chap i can stand . 
  yeah , i 'm not too fond of nazi and fascist glorification , but the song has an eerie and and somewhat melancholic feel to it that suits the melody and the overall theme it 's trying to paint . 
  * lyrics * : this is europa my innermost sun my state of redemption of fire and of water to come swastikas rising in times of expand this is europa where all will come to an end, 
  make holy roman empire great again !, 
  gim me them sweet sweet downvotes butthurt albinos !, 
  when in doubt , unnecessarily shit all over serbia to sway the conversation from the topic . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijutthiyd2u ) . 
  of course it had to be turkey . 
  i think my maths ' prof favorite word by now is cauchy . 
  you are obviously mistaken , sir . 
  who the hell is dragana mirkovic ?
