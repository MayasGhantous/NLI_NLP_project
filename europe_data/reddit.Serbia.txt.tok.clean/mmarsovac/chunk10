  see how ridiculous and nonsensical it is now ? 
  * this does n't make me any less european , i was born in europe and my ancestors were here since god knows when , that is what makes me european . 
  * you ca n't argue someone else 's crimes as my own hypocrisy , which you did . 
   i 'm stating that europeans are n't really in a place to criticize those actions and act as if they 're historically above that behavior * and here is that tu quoque argument i previously mentioned . 
  my people were indeed historically well above that behavior ( and were until the 90s ) . 
  *  russians in world war two were so brutal to germans and german women in particular that there were mass suicide events prior to soviet `` liberation '' in order to avoid being actually raped to death . 
  whole towns . 
  history is not clean for anyone . 
  if you look up i mentioned ( up until 20th century ) , the world wars happened well after the ottomans took hold in europe ... sigh . 
  and its brutality does n't downplay the brutality of the ottomans for the love of god . 
  yes the russians raped germans , but guess what the germans raped the russians too , oh also jews , serbs , poles , roma etc etc etc. 
  funny how they remind me of american commercials ... 
  which are everywhere as well !, 
  wow they really teach you some false history down there . 
  did you even read what i wrote ? 
  europeans did n't do as horrible shit to ** each other ** as did the ottomans and moors to them . 
  i know what happened to africans and native americans but they are neither european nor in europe ... europeans did genocide and etc * but not in europe * is the key word here , at least not until the 20th century and not nearly on the level of ottomans ... and ** we are talking about europe here ** not the rest of the world . 
  ottomans were conquerors and of course we do n't like them , just as you do n't like us . 
  i really ca n't comprehend that you do n't understand such a simple sentence . 
  yes crimes done by europeans need to be discussed but this is n't where , and the fact that some western euros or whoever traded with blacks does n't discount that the ottomans are seen unfavorably , especially by us who actually got their treatment . 
  in what way would it ? 
   ottoman enslaving a serb and elevating him into a position of power this is really precious . 
  i in fact am serbian . 
  this is probably the ** biggest bullshit ** i heard my entire life on the matter . 
  i do n't recommend ever saying it in a serbians face or you will be getting serious blows to it . 
  this is honest advice . 
  before the ottoman invasion serbs had an [ empire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbian_empire ) . 
  talk about getting a better status . 
  is [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dev%c5%9firme ) how you mean ottomans `` elevated '' serbs into positions of power ? 
  by blood tax ? 
  taking 7 year old children and making them into whores and their slaves and soldiers who were bound to never marry or have land , to be their meat shield for more conquest ? 
  making them forget their names , culture and religion . 
  well i 'm so thankful to the ottomans . 
  what a wonderful practice . 
  ah yes , i [ remember ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skull_tower ) how positive the ottoman rule was in the balkans !!, 
  it only kept us in that blissful 14th century level of prosperity for 500 years !, 
  i mean look at that fine piece of ** skull tower ** architecture !, 
  they are really the best when it comes to this , they also [ impaled ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/had%c5%bei_prodan%27s_revolt ) people who wanted them gone on roads , so everyone knew how mighty and powerful serbs were under them !, 
  we really prospered , because ottomans would [ kill ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slaughter_of_the_knezes ) any of those pesky lords who wanted freedom and rights for serbs , ha , how silly of them !, 
  in fact how does one even `` enslave '' then `` elevate into power '' ?!, 
  if you are talking about janissaries getting positions in the government , then yes , you could happen to be * born * serbian and get to work for the people who enslaved you indeed . 
  but after the treatment of brainwashing and changing of your name your religion you are no longer serbian , but turkish . 
  none of there viziers ever did good to serbia , they were simply ** too young ** to even remember it . 
  and btw ... why the fuck should i talk about crimes that * western europeans * committed when i had no part whatsoever in it , as did n't most of eastern/central europe . 
  to me the ottomans are the single worst occurrence in my history who did ** indeed partake in mass rape/murder and enslaving ** and of course i would have loved if they had never existed or set up on my country . 
  this is n't to say that i hate the turks of today , but their empire was the death of my country in many ways , the remnants of those days are still felt today and will be for god knows how long . 
  edit : format , grammar . 
  europeans did n't enslave europeans , at least not on the level of the ottoman empire . 
  especially if you are freezing somewhere in the russian steppes , then an ushanka is sure asf awesome !, 
  the root of the word yes , but google rakija and raki , other than alcohol ( which you did n't bring to the balkans lol ) they have nothing in common lol . 
  even though the name is yours , there is n't any connection between the two , there are theories which say that it was a case of a turkish word replacing the original word , which happened a lot of times . 
  raki is made from twice distilling grape pomace and adding some herbs , while rakija is a fruit brandy ( most common are plums , pears , quince , cranberry , apples , apricot . . etc ) . 
  they are as similar as whiskey is to tequila . 
  that is an originally serbian dish , but the word was loaned from turkish and further back apparently from latin . 
  edit : its what google says, 
  yeah but your raki and ours are n't the same thing at all , just the name is . 
  i 've tasted both . 
  hehe so are you . 
  bro do you even / r/conspiracy ? 
  well that is n't completely false to be fair . 
  i 'm simply explaining why we dislike the west and like russia . 
  the future ? 
  we have none . 
   had it not been the west that weakened the ottoman filth yes . 
  also [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourth_crusade ) which is how the west was also the one who allowed the ottomans to rise up in byzantium by making a crusade on a christian city . 
  pure genius . 
  it is a bit of a stretch the argument you 're making there . 
  the west acted for its own good , russian soldiers actually volontiered to help us . 
   additionally , even though i suppose it is impopular , serbia owns its freedom to some extent to austria-hungary . 
  ah yes of course we have to `` own '' our freedom to you . 
  typical arrogance of the west . 
  both russia and autria-hungary profited from a weak ottoman empire and used us to achieve that . 
  but my grandfathers lives ( and russian lives ) are what got us our independence , nothing else . 
  then i have to remind you how it is also true that the same austria-hungary would later try to take away the freedom which we `` owe '' to them , annexing bosnia ( half serbian at the time ) and later trying to do the same to serbia . 
  then they proceed to kill 60 % of male population of serbia while chanting `` serbien muss sterben '' . 
  an almost completely successful genocide . 
  so yeah , fuck them and their `` help '' . 
  this is how the west treated us . 
  russia never did any such thing , and as long as it does n't i will continue `` liking '' them more . 
  in the eu we will be a vassal and nothing more . 
  they will give us loans to conveniently build railways from our mines to their factories and tell us how they graciously saved us by giving us nato bombing and `` freedom '' . 
   its your choice . 
  i wish it were . 
  but sadly it is n't , nor is it the choice of any one in serbia . 
  still better than being bombed in my book . 
  i know russians are n't the benevolent protector of serbia , no one here thinks that . 
  still we like them more than the eu . 
  as russians helped us greatly to achieve independence from the ottoman empire . 
  with volontier soldiers and supplies . 
  then they helped us in ww1 , again in ww2 . 
  today they do n't recognize kosovo . 
  meanwhile , germans and their allies tried to wipe us off the planet , and almost succeeded in doing so . 
  the brits are nobody 's friend . 
  french had to be forced to send ships to save our soldiers in ww1 . 
  and basically everyone is convinced that we are a beastial evil `` people '' who like to commit war crimes . 
  even tho that is more of a west european `` tradition '' then it has ever been ours . 
  and you wonder that we like russians more ? 
  other than that unfavourable loan and a few things here and there ( that everyone who can does to us anyways ) they did nothing but good for us . 
  i would n't call any of those `` being fucked in the ass '' . 
  and by no means is it any worse than what the west has `` offered '' us .
