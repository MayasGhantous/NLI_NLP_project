  oh there is some of that still , everywhere , houses of people that did n't want to or could n't return after the war . 
  usually isolated villages that had a `` minority '' ethnicity , or those of people that had to get away in the exoduses . 
  and someone who has the ability to do what this guy did , will do it regardless of his origin and nationality . 
  the balkans as a whole is n't the war wasteland people imagine . 
  man we beat ourselves up way too much . 
  thank you for telling me . 
  now i 'm curious , what did he say if its fine to ask ? 
  come on man how is he responsible for anything ? 
  / u/zurfer75 out of all people too ... 
  so what should he do ? 
  go to prison ? 
  mildly interesting , there was a black general in russia 's army in the 18th century * . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abram_petrovich_gannibal edit : and he is pushkin 's great-grandfather . 
  what do you know about me to say that ? 
  not in a million years ( nato i mean ) . 
  generally no one cares when it is about slavs/eastern europeans . 
  let alone russians/serbs . 
  our gdp is some 45ish billions , one more or less , i would n't mind . 
  and it goes to ( among other things ) `` developing democracy '' , or better said `` getting a new car for the president and his lackeys '' . 
  i get your point tho , we do n't get to play around with money and refuse it . 
  for a country . 
  well fine , that is also an opinion . 
  generally you are right , but i 'd just like to add one thing , serbs are actually weak-willed bosnians who betrayed islam for christianity and then split from the other croat christians and imagined their own identity . 
  i for one admit that i am a bosnian as i have a dozen ancient kurans in the basement of my great grandma 's stone house that prove my ancestors ' faith . 
  ehh look my point is just that there is no such thing as * clean * and * just * war . 
  calm down wub_wub , you know how it is here . 
  \\* gives a shot of sljivovica *, 
  i think war is simply war , i do n't believe in any rightfulness about it . 
  but thats just like my opinion . 
  i am thinking maybe that is among the minorities . 
  we already know how to live on bare bread crumbs , a meatless bone like those 1,5 billion wo n't change much . 
   just wars that is a very simplistic and intellectually dishonest way of looking at war . 
  well not like we need them anyways . 
  who 's gon na attack us that we would need nato to protect ? 
  going against the whole west alone proved to be a bit too brash of us before , now we should just stay low and neutral , and not ~ ~ give ~ ~ send * our men to die in nato 's wars . 
  ohh right , do n't know what to tell you , maybe its picking the lesser of the evils kind of situation so they still support the gov. 
  i am joking , oh you superior being who ca n't comprehend sarcasm and lame polandball jokes . 
  the government = / = the president perhaps ? 
  yeah , we need more homogay and western decadence !, 
  nato ca n't kill you if you kill yourself first !, 
  wait you mean there are 12 % who voted * for * nato membership ? 
  kek, 
  aaand they 've fucked up our flag ... whats up with hungarians ? 
  first they want to build a wall between us and now this . 
  and european basketball championship for women . 
  t'was a good evening for us . 
  the ones in the balkans are pretty brown , and definitely darker than a spanish person . 
   rowing , equestrian sports , cycling , fencing how yuropean . 
  yep same here , i was n't even aware it was going on . 
  wait does studying/working in america immediately mean you are american ? 
  and you can always say `` stotinu '' if you want to avoid confusion , but those kindergarden `` sto '' jokes never get old !, 
   \u0437\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e thank you , i will try to import this fine word to serbian , our loanword collection is still hungry . 
  of course , its your * linguistic freedom * !, 
  i think `` taman '' is a turkish loanword ( if some tur\u010din would be so nice to confirm and spare me the googlework * ? ) . 
  you just mistranslated knap , it also means when something fits just barely , so it can be connected with the actual german meaning ( barely/scarcely any space left ) like those guys said . 
  i say it will be 10 days before they want out . 
  i bet he is all like : `` oh stop it you ! '', 
  * blushes *, 
  gee this is surprising !, 
   ~ ~ sky ~ ~ heavenly people please ... 
  yeah , i 'm a big fan btw . 
  they must have learned that trick from us !, 
  dunno how spread out the whole aleksandar the great thing actually is tho . 
  hmm did n't know anything about that . 
  ca n't understand the documentary tho :\\ i have some relatives in macedonia , from the north . 
  they ( the great-grandparents ) used to declare themselves as serbs , then as yugoslavs , today the younger ones are macedonian and full of pride for aleksandar greatski , its a whole mess . 
  oh snap so we fucked that one up too , did n't we ? 
  lol, 
  i 've always wondered do you still have a grudge on us over macedonia and the second balkan war ? 
  there are people that would do that ? 
  damn . 
  what tourists ? 
  yeah it is montenegrin tradition , those tourists were obviously being culturally insensitive . 
  well yeah if russians were as uh , war frenzied , as the balkans was back then , it maybe would escalate . 
   it took them some time to decide what they want and by the time they decided we managed to get some weapons ... mostly from barracks we took . 
  haha exactly . 
  what a shitty decision to have to make . 
  a cherry grenade on top here and there , to mix things up a bit !, 
  yes jna officers were lacking definitely , it was like a half-assed war in some ways . 
  yeah that was my point , because you know , * there still are n't any russian soldiers there * !, 
  only vacation !, 
  if russia was to go full on with ukraine like serbia ( or yugoslavia ) was with you , it would be much worse i reckon . 
  oh its complicated even for us who live here . 
  so should now the russian population be expelled ? 
  i do n't understand this `` rightfully ours '' narrative , its always either ethnicity or `` historical belonging '' its never one thing constantly , its used the way it suits the speaker . 
  but comrade , when i was on vacation , half the signs were in russian !, 
  and the ladies renting apartments were all olyas and natalyas . 
  this is clear and not at all silly proof of my claim !, 
  jk aside , it is a popular vacation destination for russians , right ? 
  i think russians maybe prefer montenegro , as they own half of it . 
  did you go between the walls inside and try and climb that shaky metal ladder to the top ? 
  :d man i have such memories at that place . 
  well perhaps , we ca n't get into their minds , but since sculptures that had nothing to do with stuff like that were also destroyed ( like those busts ) , i think there was some other reason as well . 
  do n't get me wrong i 'm not all `` boo hoo look at what they did '' , or making some conspiracy conclusions , i just translated what i read . 
  nor am i judging croatians , some really intense ` rvatine probably did it , ca n't be hypocritical and say we do n't have those too . 
  well thats great actually because those concrete buildings have a positive effect on your studying and concentration as they wo n't distract you with pretty colors and windows . 
  so look on the bright side !, 
  ` tis a fact proven by scientists of course . 
  i 'm just saying what i read in that article that his works were targeted specifically , as there are other monuments that were n't attacked . 
  also some of those had nothing to do with either partisans , socialism , or * anything * political .
