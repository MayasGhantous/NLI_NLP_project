  namely , ~ ~ bists ~ ~ * busts of two croatian writers and a scientist . 
  among the destroyed was a sculpture of a man in a serbian graveyard in bjelovar that honored the partizans from that town that were killed by the ustasa , today it is repaired thankfully . 
  one was a tablet in a memorial place where ustase murdered 7k antifascists from zagreb ( only 2k of whom were actual communists ) , of all ethnicities , only vojin 's work there was damaged . 
  among the ones i cited as `` damaged '' was like a memorial tablet on a house , to note that a famous person was born in that home ( vojin himself ) , it was removed and the street in that town ( bjelovar ) that was named after him was renamed . 
  he also was n't a socialist/communist but a apolitical person , so i think being serbian * did * have a bit to do with it after all . 
  and those are n't symbols of socialism per se , but of victory over nazism , and of victims of nazism , but i understand that to a nationalist monument-destroying type of guy that nuance did n't really matter much . 
  no problem , i 'm glad you asked !, 
  yeah i get that and its hard to see some of the symbols of these monuments without knowing the details of history behind them too , i wish i knew more about the others as well , but sadly i could n't find good sources on the internet :\\ yugoslavia had a few prominent architects and masons/sculptors ( if those are the correct words ) but as you see we do n't really take good care of their works . 
  i think it is more correct to say that this is [ brutalist architecture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brutalist_architecture ) , not soviet , which happened to be used in many soviet and other communist countries , and is usually associated with them . 
  but it has its examples in the west as well . 
  now , the question is how do we get it to wake up ? ... 
  thank you i 'll try it !, 
  got a few napkins ready too just in case !, 
  looks like some primordial transformer without any limbs to me !, 
  did n't know we had those in the balkans . 
  or , mir - world , mir - peace . 
  all peace !, 
  no i mean some are destroyed and some are overgrown with bushes . 
  thats not architectural style , its neglect . 
  that building is so imposing , i like it . 
  yugoslavia was n't soviet . 
  we were stronk and independent third world represent . 
  link to thread ? 
  what are they doing ? 
  edit : `` joga2.jpg '' ... * facepalm *, 
  yeah , there were worse massacres as far as numbers go but that one feels especially heartbreaking . 
   i have a friend who lived in dresden , and he told me that the city of dresden has established a scholarship for children of kragujevac after the war , since the commanding officer responsible for the massacre was from dresden ( i was n't able to verify that ) i did n't know that , its touching :')  bilo je to u nekoj zemlji seljaka  na brdovitom balkanu  umrla je juna\u010dkom smr\u0107u  \u010deta \u0111aka  u istom danu . 
  [ apparently ] ( https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/spomenik_pobjedi_naroda_slavonije#ru.c5.a1enje_spomenika ) it was destroyed by croatians for being made by a [ serbian guy ] ( https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/vojin_baki\u0107 ) whose [ 6 other monuments ] ( https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/vojin_baki\u0107#ru.c5.a1enje_baki.c4.87evih_spomenika ) were also destroyed and 5 were damaged . 
  i know some of them do . 
  the one from kragujevac http://www.master-holidays.com/uploaded/izleti/kragujevac/kragujevac-v3.jpg is meant to look like broken wings , to represent the cut `` flight '' of the schoolboys and teachers slaughtered there . 
  at the [ kozara ] ( http://imgur.com/a/8io4q#ctstyyr ) the cavities in the vertical walls represent death and the bumps represent life . 
  i could describe it much better in serbian , but you have to see that one in person and now a bit of history to understand its point . 
  this place is on a mountain where the whole of krajina 's serbian population basically fled to when ustase and germans were taking people to concentration camps , thats the only place where they could defend themselves . 
  the horizontal blocks represent the brute force of enemies crowding in at kozara but the monument , life and victory , stands tall and defiant to them , rising to the sky . 
  thats paraphrasing the designer . 
  [ the jasenovac one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yb4w4qg.jpg ) is called the stone flower . 
  the ~ ~ author ~ ~ architect did n't want to create a monument that one would immediately associate with suffering and death , as the swamps and `` heavy '' air surrounding the place already took care of that feeling , instead he chose a gentle and ( purposefully ) blank concrete flower . 
  apparently it is made so that it gets very very hot in the middle of it on a sunny day there , to create the impression of being in hell , that the camp was for many people . 
  edit : some wording . 
  a bit of depth and meaning . 
  yeah nothing can make plain concrete look interesting but a few cracks and vines , and some graying at the sides from the weather . 
  ah i can smell the fresh mountain air on kozara already . 
  i only see victory over nazism . 
  its sad that most of them are in such a bad shape . 
  its `` tooth '' , i just end up spitting everywhere around me `` tssuuuthshs '', 
  its not nearly as funny in english as it is in croatian tho , ca n't translate that `` style '' simply . 
  oysters clams and cockles !, 
  i think he meant `` you '' as if he was speaking about ukraine , not bulgaria . 
  he probably meant land was gained by '' * croats * '' after '' * serbs * '' left , not that the country itself acquired new land . 
  let them separate ? 
  man i understand you maybe lost some relatives in the war and whatnot and that is hard , i experienced it myself , but i do n't hate an entire nation for the acts of few , in the war my family was first evicted by bosnians and then sheltered by bosnians in another city , there are good and bad people everywhere , so i 'd still recommend you to relax a little . 
  most serbs , the regular folk , did n't do war crimes after all . 
  hate on the criminals , not the entire nation , that is just well unfair and no good for anyone . 
  you see you 're just making everything worse by that attitude . 
   why are serbians not also being prosecuted for their crimes ? 
  * mostly * everyone that was caught and that had an inkling of war crime responsibility is in prison or dead . 
  yeah serbs had the same reasons and more for ww2 , yet they still lived with you in yugoslavia . 
  so cut down on the drama a little bit , this is sports after all . 
  that explains it !, 
  are you possibly an expat ? 
  those were the days . 
  except the war !, 
  haha, 
   but i think the majority of croatians would rather never win a sports competition ever again than live with those genocidal sobs . 
  heh unrelated to sports but this is exactly the balkan mentality , we 'd rather never be good at anything and have shitty countries than live with * them * . 
  or as that joke says `` da komsiji crkne krava '' . 
  `` let my cow die , if the neighbors ' cow will too '' . 
  yeah replace jasenovac with serbia 's 90s war crimes and croatian nazis with serb nationalists and there you go , same argument , and it still wo n't make any sense . 
  this is about football , remember ? 
  but we 're pretty good at sports , its just that we 're tiny and forgettable :3, 
  oh i have no doubt that `` getting funds '' is all he 's ever been about regardless of what he says , if you know what i mean . 
  i laughed the saddest laugh right now . 
   just like this thread topic , i do n't want to convince or undeceive anybody of using `` genocide '' term , i 'm just sure that would be the frame if a politician wants to be in the `` reconciliation picture '' . 
  yeah i agree with that . 
  i 'm not a serb nationalist , i do n't have a nation i feel like i belong to truly , i 'm mixed ethnicity , but as i was raised in my serbian parent 's homeland i do gravitate towards them more , born in bosnia , moved to serbia . 
  i have this flair because i live here , but if i could choose the one i wanted it would be yugoslavia just like both my parents declare themselves to be . 
  my point was , what does the fact that civilians died in a siege by serbian artillery have to do with is using uranium justifiable or not , and i disliked how it was immediately brought out as if it was serbian `` hypocrisy '' ( serb civilians died by the bosnian army too you know ) , when the original commenter did n't mention or * discredit serbian involvement in sarajevo * , i thought it was uncalled for , and as well that frankly its not the serbs that will have to deal with consequences of uranium effects in sarajevo anyway as there are n't many left either way . 
  but i got the points out rather badly . 
  lol well alright man , whatever floats your boat  but i do n't think you have a lot to worry about , yugoslavia or anything similar is nowhere to be found on the serious political radar . 
  it is just a dream for sad mixed ethnicity fucks like me that wish we were a big nation of 30 million yugoslavs instead of a couple million `` different '' nations . 
  its not the type of music i listen to . 
  but `` bratstvo i jedinstvo '' will always have a place of nostalgia in my heart , even if it did n't work out . 
   sorry for `` overuse '' of that term reconcilliation , i did n't find better words to describe that major policy that is ( almost ) describable as `` pro-eu '' . 
  i do n't know does that `` pro-reconcilliation '' policy represent only posssible `` pro-eu '' policy , but i 'm sure those political streams which are using it as political agenda act as it surely is `` the only way '' . 
  you mean reconciliation as in `` establishing reasonable relations '' i assume ? 
  well that much is expected of them , so you are right , if this resolution does pass and it makes a bit of sound , maybe serbian politicians will be effectively `` forced '' to call it genocide if they want to be on eu 's good side . 
  well they should anyways , i think . 
   damir avdi\u0107 ' approach i 'm afraid i 'm not familiar with him , he is a musician right ? 
  is that quote from a song or something ? 
   i was talking only about the consequence , about the future when ( imo ... ) politicians could n't be anymore presented as pro-reconciliation if they are avoiding to name the events in srebrenica in july 1991 . as genocide . 
  yeah i get that , good point , that however already is the case kind of , no bosnian will listen to you if you say srebrenica was n't a genocide , and on the serbian side well its 50-50 , some say it was a massacre , others that it was genocide , but one thing is for sure , our politicians have never , not since tito managed to represent us truly . 
  who in the balkans is * truly * pro-reconcilliation ? 
  everyone will say as much as is thought they think is outside of controversy , but then the next day they will go back to their daily business of not doing anything substantial for that `` reconcilliation '' . 
   this is the good time to emphasize one more thing : why he should be doing that ? 
  i 'm not talking everybody after un resolution must using the `` srebrenica genocide '' phrase in their political talks , i 'm just saying there would be no other way if someone wants to be recognized as a pro-reconciliation politician . 
  yeah i understand your point !, 
  dodik will be sweating a bit if this succeeds . 
  but the regular serbs that actually go to vote wo n't care what he calls it as long as he is there to `` protect republika srpska '' and hold our `` independence '' from the federation . 
   i 'm not saying his words are obviously bad , just that his words are the same as anyone else 's . 
   let me explain that this way : whole op 's article text could be swapped with a tiny sentence with the `` srebrenica genocide '' syntagm in it .
