  oh i was joking on australia being in the eurovision , i do n't know how hated they are . 
   liberate serbia , or , if not just serbia , then all the south slavic lands . 
  no not serbia , he was by his own words a yugoslav nationalist , not a serbian one . 
   helping europe show its bad side since 1914 . 
  that is the same as : `` she was asking for it . '', 
   true city of sarajevo ... 
  how can a person have internet access and still spout shit like you do ? 
  oh what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  mlada bosna was not a serbian nationalistic movement . 
  serbian nationalists were opposed to them , they fought each other . 
  mlada bosna wanted yugoslavia , a united country of southern slavs * and nothing else . 
  jesus can you at least read a wiki page ? 
  if committing genocide on serbs is something croatians are proud of , go ahead make one . 
  ridiculous comparison . 
  i was surprised i did n't get downvoted to oblivion honestly . 
   i really wonder whether the people who downvoted you support european colonialism in africa . 
  yeah but explain it to them . 
  close minded people , nothing you can do , they 've been taught to react that way . 
  canadian , american . . when it comes to knowledge and prejudice of serbia , its all the same . 
  and pavelic is your hero , just go fuck yourself if you stereotype like that . 
  reminds me of a video i saw a long time ago that an american made about the 5 things that will surprise you when visiting europe . 
  one of them was `` they all speak different languages ! '' . 
  but this guy is actually canadian it seems . 
  well if they are anything similar to this guy no wonder . 
  maybe his accent got influenced while spending time in serbia or something . 
  but his name is williams , could that be a german name too ? 
  edit : he is canadian from quebec . 
  his name is williams . 
  is that common for hungarians ? 
  edit : apparently he is a canadian from quebec . 
  well they are more modern , but the process is n't that less complicated there . 
  i mean you sign a check and give the cop money , he gives you a document/copy of the check that confirms you paid it and thats it . 
  if you do n't / ca n't pay on spot then you likewise get a ticket and pay it at the bank/post office . 
  it is just the online payment that we lack . 
  yeah he is all `` sir '' this `` sir '' that but as soon as they leave he says `` is this your monthly pay ? '', 
  laughs and mocks them all around ... really disrespectful and arrogant . 
  i get what you mean , but the new cops do speak english , it is just that this guy is a lot older . 
  and he did appear to know a bit of german , which is more reasonable as germans are more often coming here than any americans or just any native english speakers do . 
  edit : grammar . 
  it kinda looks like they wanted the cop to slip up , i mean that is what they came for . 
  but so sad how smug they acted about it and the cop did no mistake at all , he proceeded according to law . . 
  but what kind of `` journalist '' goes to a foreign country to report about `` corruption '' and ** not know its basic laws ** ? 
  yeah he was veeery patient with him considering that , he tried to explain it , but that guy was almost wanting to pin `` corruption '' on him . 
  he would have tried speaking hungarian then , a lot of them live in subotica ( where they were pulled over ) , it would n't be unusual that a couple of policemen speak it . 
  rip, 
  we do n't get a lot of foreign traffic and especially not american/english . 
  those `` foreign '' cars you see are i bet at least 80 % our own people that are coming back for holidays or whatever from whichever one of those countries they work in . 
  besides that guy is old , back in his day english was n't even studied in many schools here , so of course he does n't know it . 
  and to take these old cops to language courses because of a couple of guys like this one is kinda , well , wasting money we do n't have . 
  the woman is younger and knows english . 
  yeah i agree with you completely , it was a misunderstanding , 
  i did n't say it did , i just said they are chechens , which they are , to point out to that guy how ridiculous his hatred is , when he does n't even know who is he talking about . 
  `` russian culture '' ... 
  what do you mean by `` common '' chechens ? 
  if you mean not everyone of them agrees with these guys , then of course , but they are chechens nevertheless . 
  the people are n't russian . 
  yep that is what it is . 
  the only kind of corruption with traffic control officers here is the kind when you do a mistake and they instead of reporting it , take some dinars and let you go , and it only ever happens in smaller roads . 
  they do n't just stop you and ask for money outright , i mean we are a corrupt country but that is straight out ridiculous . . 
  if you respect the rules you are safe . 
  the cops have some kind of radars ( do n't know what they are called ) that check if you are speeding and video everything , so the guy has proof for something like this . 
  well yeah he is reporting on `` corruption in serbia '' , i just ca n't comprehend what idiots they are , the policewoman explained to him perfectly ( and the guy before did too except he does n't know english ) . 
  and what the heck is he getting angry that its * illegal * to take euros as payment for fines in serbia ... next time they come they should n't speed ... edit : `` civilized robbers and thieves '' `` i spent a lot of money in your country these last few days and then i get penalised '' ... man i want to give him all his money back myself just as long as he never comes back to `` report on corruption '' . 
  ugh god how pompous and condescending , i have no words . 
  he goes to a foreign country and assumes he knows its laws better than the policeman ... 
  if you go abroad you should learn stuff like this beforehand . 
  a journalist even ... he thinks that because of that he does n't have to obey laws . 
  to demand the chief of the police to regulate something simple like this . . 
  he should have just called the embassy and gotten them to explain him . 
  there is a saying in the balkans - `` sto juznije to tuznije '' means the more south you go the sadder it gets , and its true somewhat . 
  but corruption and kleptomania is just balkan tm not south exclusive . 
  no such thing . 
  ask greece ^ ^ i ^ ^ get ^ ^ what ^ ^ you ^ ^ mean ^ ^ tho, 
  i know that , but there are nationalists parties everywhere in europe , i do n't see any dictatorship tho . 
  i mean nationalism does n't equate to that but it does go hand in hand . 
   also a democratic achievement to overcome nationalism in favor of minorities of all kinds . 
  like in communism . 
  that wo n't come in bosnia for decades , and it wo n't be because of democracy but because the war narrative and victimhood is used as a tactic by our politicians 24h/day making sure the nations are still hateful towards each other . 
  it is always `` oh this ( insert serb/bosnian/croatian ) did ( whatever in the war/history ) , i vow to protect our identity , vote me ! '' . 
  it should just split up , this way it is like an abomination that struggles to stay alive . 
  it is n't ? 
  that is a very simplistic way of looking at things . 
  those bastards are in power because people voted for them , and people vote for them as long as they give dreamy promises and show how big of a ~ ~ patriot ~ ~ nationalist they are . 
  and ~ ~ the ~ ~ that equals good economy ? 
  lol, 
  yes this , it is mostly only the people who work in government institutions that are `` counted '' , others work as we say `` na crno '' , illegally , without social insurance , pensions , contract etc. 
  it is really shitty , you work long hours for little money , the pay sometimes does n't even come for months ( this goes for the `` legal '' employees too tho ) , your boss can do whatever the fuck he wants with you , if you get sick you get fired , if you get a kid and ca n't come to work you get fired ... and there is nothing you can do about it , no law protects you as you are working illegally . 
  no i know those are different obviously , but the `` independence '' that i was speaking of is more than just nominal independence . 
  i expanded the term to include those other things . 
  i did ' t equate them , just added . 
   there 's plenty of this in the european history , and russia is no exception . 
  and yes , but as you said those things happened in history . 
  but i specifically said my point referred to russia of * today * , the * recent * history of europe and its atmosphere again * today * . 
  the west does n't even feel its independence is endangered , whereas in russia it is different , without including the countries that border russia lol . 
  this is the `` nature '' of todays people there , that is what is common to them all . 
  look man you 're under the assumption that i make russia be the unique snowflake ... 
  i 'm not . 
  it just an observation of mine of russians today and in recent history not some claim of genetic bullshit or `` in their blood '' mentality . 
   it 's an behaviour you 'll find in every leader well that is untrue , leaders have always surrendered parts of their power to stronger opponents , from ancient times . 
  hehe well conquering is n't the same as defending .
