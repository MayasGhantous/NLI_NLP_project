  they would be slaughtered , not for liquidating differences between classes or some other communist ideal but for simply being ' * untermensch * ' as some nazi said they were . 
  if the nazis had won then it would have made a difference . 
  * some entire ethnicities might have been wiped out . 
  * the thing is they lost and that is when their ` kill count ' was stopped , ussr continued to kill people over a century . 
  kulak is however not an ethnicity . 
  when i said `` for being born '' i mean because you belonged to a certain ethnicity . 
  i understand and really feel sad for those people , but still it is n't the same . 
  i think the soviet and nazi regimes need to be thought of as different and not compared so often as they are today . 
  they were both horrible , there is no need or point in arguing which was worse . 
  today the victory over nazism is celebrated , not the beginning of the soviet regime . 
  the former ussr republics have their independence days to celebrate for their own victories . 
  it just needs separation . 
  that is my honest opinion . 
   far-right serb lol , ok if you say so . 
  yes , and for the nazis you were an enemy for being born . 
  small difference from your perspective perhaps , but not from mine . 
  edit : i mean that as in , i am \\* insert one of the ethnicities nazis genocided \\* and therefore need to be killed . 
  there is one difference , nazis killed people for their race , ethnicity . 
  soviets did it to political enemies . 
  if the nazis won , my country and my people would be no more . 
  and how much coverage did it get in croatia ? 
  as much as seselj did ? 
  and how much coverage it got in the west ? 
  zero . 
  it would n't be her first time saying stuff like this . 
  i ca n't believe that you are trying to excuse a statement like that . 
   quote from you : while in croatia the actions which lead to ethnic cleansing of serbs are considered a victory and are celebrated . 
  that means pretty much that . 
  did i celebrated * because * of that ? 
  is it considered a victory and celebrated ? 
  yes . 
  did it lead to ethnic cleansing of serbs ? 
  it did . 
  that is all i said , do n't put words in my mouth it is pointless . 
  even when she `` corrected '' herself later on . 
  she said she '' * would n't change anything except say chetniks instead of serbs * '' which is still ridiculous . 
   representing croats as `` evil ustashas '' or some shit . 
  i think this argument is over , i did n't say nor intend to say that , you are paranoid . 
  i merely translated and posted something that a croatian politician said . 
  if you think it was n't worthy of being reported , i 've nothing more to say to you . 
  and those statements were n't dubious , they were at most as dubious as the statements from croatian politicians which prompted them . 
  think of it as what jerusalem is to jews , kosovo is to us . 
  to put it simply . 
  i think it is a good translation , but `` certain '' can do as well , since it is also non particular actually and still referes to serbs in general , you know how our language works . 
  she meant to characterize an ethnicity while still restraining from going fully into hate speech , that is how i see it . 
  even if it * was * a handful of serbs who actually did `` not care for croatia '' it would still be * wrong * and hate speech to threaten you will * cleanse * them ... 
  i did n't build my ` narrative ' around that . 
  i 'll change it if you want . 
  there was n't any bias , i only translated what was said . 
  yes it led to the end of the war and i did n't say they celebrated it because of ethnic cleansing , but it also led to a lot of serbs having to leave their homes , again perspective is the key word here , and if you think they do n't / should n't remember that , well what can i say then . 
  edit : i changed it . 
  or you know , maybe someone left a gold rolex on their beloved grandpa 's hand ... would be a shame to let such a beautiful piece of art go to the ground to rot ... 
  i ca n't fully read whatever it is you posted , i guess it is about evacuation . 
  yes , a lot of serbs left croatia on their own , and their lives were n't in immediate danger as it is actually said in the source i gave for the number which left . 
  but tell me , is that normal ? 
  it is only a more passive sort of ` cleansing ' if you will . 
  they could n't stay * because * they were in danger . 
  and the fact that 2/3 of them left and ca n't return still stands . 
  and i know serbs did ethnic cleansing themselves i 'm not saying they did n't . 
  exactly , only russia is huge and we are tiny . 
  might makes right in these matters . 
  lol , its like you are arguing with an ex-girlfriend and not about politics . 
  and not to offend you , but you are kind of a pompous meanie . 
  duuuuuude you did n't mention the best thing about him !, 
  he was a gravedigger before he went into politics !, 
  you can kinda tell from his complexion . 
  ( to be fair he was a ` manager ' of some sort of a graveyard , not an actual gravedigger ), 
  [ ahem excuse me !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_fiba_world_championship#awards ) but yeah the title is a little misleading , i wanted to change it to something better but the ` rule ' or whatever apparently says no no to that , and since it is my first post i was too scared to ignore it :3, 
  if you read the full article in bcs , sadly there is n't a translation in english , she actually goes on to say  oni dr\u017ee ovu dr\u017eavu za blagajnu i samoposlugu , a ni\u0161ta joj ne daju '' . . they consider this country to be a cash register and a supermarket ( i 've no idea what the f she meant by that either ) , and they contribute nothing to it . '', 
  now that does n't sound like you are talking about * war criminals * does it ? 
  `` i 'm sick and tired of certain serbs who are born in croatia , and they do n't care about croatia ( ah yes she identified them all , she is n't talking about a whole ethnicity at all ) . 
  they live at the expense of croatian citizens ( so she does n't consider them croatian citizens at all , and apparently croatians hand feed these serbs , they do n't work for their own bread at all ) , they traversed the world at the expense of croatia and they gave nothing back . 
  ( maybe the eu passport idk ) this statement is well horrifying on its own at multiple levels . 
  i hope i do n't have to explain every one of them . 
  `` they abuse their function and are making ( i ca n't think of a better word ) politics which has turned into ` ethnobusiness ' , and the talk about rising ethnic and political intolerance is used by those who are losing positions as * monopolists * on serbhood . '', 
  well what can i say ? 
  she also mentions how this is `` what everyone feels but no one says '' so that whole ` serbs who did war crimes ' was said in a * later statement * and it stinks of a cheap cover up . 
  to give any sort of excuse to this sentence  ** let them pray to god that we do not clean up our yard , because if we start to clean up our yard , there will be a lot of croatian serbs who will have to go to serbia ** is pure madness . 
  saying that `` it sounds like a threat '' is true because it * is * a threat !, 
  you ca n't say you will * cleanse * an ethnicity for the love of god . 
  it is n't even subtle ... she is n't even trying to mask it . 
  if a serbian said anything remotely similar we would be bombed again . 
  a few months ago when seselj burned their flag the whole country was talking about it and so was the west , but this even worse statement imho is completely ignored , both by croats and western media . 
  * which is sad , disappointing , and pretty revealing . 
  * the post is ignored and i have to explain why this is a horrifying statement . 
  but the worst is that a eu parlamentarian feels completely safe to say such things and face no repercussion ... and she probably wo n't . 
  *** ** edit ** : to address your other points , belgrade * is * prosecuting war criminals , almost all of them have been found and are in hague on trial , the ` big ' guys are all in prison . 
  to clarify this ` whataboutism ' . 
  president of croatia kolinda said how `` justice still has n't reached were creating the idea of ` greater serbia ' '' . 
  even though it definitely has . 
  then a minister of theirs , ranko ostoji\u0107 , claimed how serbia needs to `` prove its european path '' by prosecuting some unidentified soldiers who apparently killed 12 policemen in borovo selo in the war . 
  to that a serbian minister , vulin , replied  `` prije nego \u0161to spomenu srbiju , hrvatski du\u017enosnici trebaju pogledati u svoje dvori\u0161te i vidjet \u0107e da imaju puno razloga baviti se sobom i svojom sudskom praksom , a srbiju neka ostave na miru '' `` before they mention serbia , croatian officers need to look in their own yard and they will see that they have a lot of reasons to deal with their own jurisprudence ( not sure if correct term ) , and serbia they should leave alone '' he later also mentioned how to croatia there does n't seem to be a bigger topic than serbia and suggested that they mind their own business and how serbia * is * on the eu path . 
  he also mentioned a couple of massacres of serbs which happened in croatia and have n't been answered . 
  now serbia has found and prosecuted * most * of its war criminals , while in croatia the actions which lead to ethnic cleansing of serbs are considered a victory and are celebrated . 
  it is i think understandable from these peoples perspectives that this ` whataboutism ' * is not a jab but an actual problem * . 
  the serbian minister basically said `` do n't lecture us on something we are obviously committed to while you continue to ignore your own crimes '' . 
   the last time they did that was during wwii well that is n't entirely true , they did their share in the 90s . 
  from ~ 500 000 serbs 2/3 had to leave croatia , today there are ~ 180 000 of them left , http://www.minorityrights.org/download.php@id=100 many ca n't return , and many simply do n't want to as they will have no rights there . 
   relatively small faction of nazi puppets [ ustase ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usta\u0161e ) edit2 : but of course i agree that they do n't love ethnic cleansing ... that is just stupid to say .
