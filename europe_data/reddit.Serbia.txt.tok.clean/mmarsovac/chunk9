  well it is the balkan national sport after all !, 
  not a king but a prince , [ kraljevic marko ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prince_marko ) , who is kind of a ( sometimes comical ) medieval serbian superman . 
  he has a mustachio the size of a 6-month old lamb , rides a black destrier called \u0160arac . 
  he carries a spear , a sabre and a 80 kg mace that hung on the left side of his saddle and to balance it out he had an equally heavy wineskin on the other side . 
  whenever he drinks , he gives his horse the same amount . 
  he was exiled by his father for not looking like him and was then nursed and raised by fairies lol . 
  in various epic songs he appears as a protector of the people , fighter against turks and injustice . 
  he is short-tempered , humorous and sometimes cruel but more than anything honest and just . 
   marko , age 300 , rode the 160-year-old \u0160arac by the seashore towards mount urvina when a vila ( ** edit ** : similar to a fairy ) told him that he was going to die . 
  marko then leaned over a well and saw no reflection of his face on the water ; hydromancy confirmed the vila ' s words . 
  he killed \u0160arac so the turks would not use him for menial labor , and gave his beloved companion an elaborate burial . 
  marko broke his sword and spear , throwing his mace far out to sea before lying down to die . 
  his body was found seven days later by abbot vaso and his deacon , isaija . 
  vaso took marko to mount athos and buried him at the hilandar monastery in an unmarked grave . 
  now he sleeps and will rise when we are in danger . 
  so i guess it can be said with no doubt that * he is fake * :(, 
  it was for a while, 
  yes , yes we are . 
  oh come on , heh maybe the average serbian * redditor * wants serbia to join eu and is fully excited about it , but * most of us * ( not everyone of course , but the majority yes ) just see it as an unavoidable necessity and kinda out of our hands , not something we really want and * ca n't wait to see happen * . 
   if you do n't believe the contents of your own link , why even post it ? 
  it is a bloody wikipedia article , i have no control over every single little detail written there . 
  i know of a different history , one where in mothers would disguise and hide their male children so that they would n't be taken away from them not one where they open handedly waited with a smile to see their kids become tools of their enemies . 
   but to deny that there were many cases of enslaved europeans rising to great places in ottoman society would be disingenuous and simply false . 
  but please , more strawman . 
  ** when did i deny it ?!, 
  ** i said i know there are cases of it , but they are rare and ** unimportant ** !, 
  and certainly are n't proof of some `` good '' treatment serbs got in the ottoman empire !, 
  this tracks back to your first comment when you sarcastically said how this policy is horrible , my point is well yes fucker , ** it fucking is horrible ** . 
   being chosen for high governance oh yes , any non-muslim could n't hold government power . 
  those janisaries were muslim . 
  that is the difference . 
   that 's not specific to you . 
  then why even bring it up ? 
   lmfao , you think that serbs would have behaved any differently than the rest of human beings if they were n't the ones under someone else 's boot ? 
  it only took a decade of independence to get an ethnic cleansing under your belt , what makes you think that the serbian people are any exception ? 
  americans , brits , frenchmen , germans , czechs , russians , canadians , italians , portuguese , spanish . . all have done some fucked up shit because they had the power to do so . 
  believing that your people are any different is next level na\u00efvet\u00e9 , and it 's shown . 
  serbians did behave differently until the 90s . 
  i agree with you absolutely that people are n't different when it comes to their `` ability '' to commit crimes ( which we proved in the 90s ) but i said that serbians ** did n't commit crimes of that sort until the 90s ** which is a correct and historical fact . 
  so since you assessed that there is such a thing as historically above , then yes at that point we were . 
   cleanse territory of other ethnicities oh yes , you must be an expert on the subject . 
  let me guess , you also think that we commited genocide in kosovo ? 
  what you do n't know is that the same exact shit was done to us in the same exact manner in the same war by those who claim to be the only victims of it . 
  this ethnic cleansing you speak of , was n't even spread to the majority of serbs . 
  there are to this day bosniaks and croats who live in belgrade and no one touched them . 
  i guess you 've never heard of kravica and the massacres that went on in serbian villages around srebrenica by the bosnian army before the serbian army got there and committed the genocide . 
  and the ethnic cleansing of 150.000 serbs from sarajevo , and 200.000 more from knin . 
  those refugees have made entire new neighboorhoods in our other cities now . 
  yeah fucking never heard of it . 
   y point in saying that is that this level of barbarism as shown in ottoman treatment of the balkan peoples is not unique i did n't say it was unique , but my whole point through this entire discussion which seems to have flown right over your head is that * `` serbians and other europeans that got the ottoman treatment have all the right to wish it never happened '' * . 
  that is it . 
  it sucked , it was horrible , it would 've been better for us if they never conquered constantinople . 
  this whole discussion was pointless because you were mistaken in the first post you wrote . 
  no one here said that `` europeans are above ottomans '' and there is no point in bringing up european crimes to the table , when the whole question is about * europe * and not colonies . 
  and than somehow you do n't understand that people generally dislike those who would conquer and enslave them and have full right to that sentiment . 
  this is also my last reply as well . 
   and why does it matter that europeans did n't enslave each other ? 
  ... i do n't know what pills you are on man . 
  because this is n't about moral standpoints , this is about us getting fucked by them . 
  understand now ? 
  people generally dislike invaders and conquerors . 
  read my comment again , i did n't say it was less of a crime what europeans did to non-europeans . 
  i have no strength really to explain anymore . 
  lets put it this way , you would want the person , who intended to rape you , gone right ? 
  this is talking about position , from our perspective the ottoman empire was death . 
  when i said you , i meant african americans , native americans and whoever else some europeans did wrong to . 
   i 'm quite familiar with the affinity of the balkan states to hate the turks . 
  if you were aware of actual history , you would understand it . 
  it is easy to be the morality princess when its not happening to you and you are far away in you safe home . 
   bosnians turks did n't take children from muslims by force ( if by bosnians you mean muslims ) . 
  and this `` bribing officials '' i do n't believe for one second . 
  but to argue that * forceful * taking of children to be ** slaves ** is something positive ... is nothing short of disgusting . 
  yes as i said , they could rise in government , but by then ** they were n't serbian anymore ** ( or any other nation enslaved by them ) they were now ** turks ** . 
  they were servants . 
  sure its better than being a peasant on the level of animal back in serbia ( and this status is thanks to ** ottomans ** in the first place ) , but that does n't mean that it was a good practice . 
  it is inhumane to take a child from a mother , and there is no arguments to say otherwise . 
  the point is , that the ottomans took smart and capable young boys to bolster their strength , they did n't do it to benefit us , nor did it ever benefit us . 
  serbians in serbia proper were `` lesser humans '' and conquered , a few would get to be a little less stinky slaves in the ottoman courts but to say that this is worth giving up your freedom is insane . 
  if you ca n't understand this i do n't know what to say ...  tragic indeed , but that 's war . 
  hahaha so now the argument it `` thats war '' . 
  ok then lol ... the taking of slaves from africa and killing natives was also war . 
  stronger beats the weaker , suck it i guess . 
  the skull tower is just one example of how ottomans `` enslaved to elevate to power '' and how great it was to be serbian back then . 
   as a serb , you should know that . 
  oh yes i know , given that genocides happened upon my people continuously for the last 700 years . 
  i know quite a bit about that . 
  but interesting how you compare a genocide of 2000 people to 500 years of the same . 
  interesting indeed . 
  and great ad hominem there , beautiful . 
  you probably think we eat babies as well !, 
   well , you pretty much just answered your own question , although the article you posted earlier did a good enough job of that . 
  just because they did n't hold onto their serbian tradition in doing so does not mean that they 're any less in positions of power , despite how tragic it is that they lost that identity . 
  nor does it mean that ** serbs ** were in positions of power . 
  ** janissaries ** were not serbs they were ** ottoman servants ** . 
  notice the fucking gigantic difference there . 
   i guess european identity is only a valid concept when it 's convenient ** european identity is not synonymous with the crimes in the colonies . 
  ** i am european but i did n't nor did ** any of my ancestors ** have part in those happenings , to say that they did would be idiotic and ridiculous . 
  we simply * did n't * do it so why should we feel * guilty * about it ? 
  i feel sad that it happened but not guilty . 
  this is like a chinese feeling guilty about the rape of korean women by japanesse simply because he is asian .
