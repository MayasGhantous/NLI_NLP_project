same . 
  what ? 
  in serbia some people think that standard serbian is the proper way of speaking . 
  if someone speaks a dialect that does n't have all the cases , then he 's `` uneducated '' . 
  do they get textbooks in written in kajkavian dialect ? 
  [ this one ?

  the reason for the inferior quality could be the result of hypothetical uk regulations . 
  and the price could be ( it is ) the fault of distributors . 
  alright , but there might a different cause , such as distributors upping the price or adjustment made in order to pass uk 's regulations . 
  what 's quality in this case ? 
  and you base this on taste ? 
  the same brand ? 
  there 's a difference between importing products from shitty brands and importing shitty products from good brands that actually sell the superior product in some other market . 
   ... vows never again to visit czech shops for the hipp baby food he feeds to the son clinging to his chest . 
  why ? 
  because on the one occasion they bought locally he instantly ** spat the stuff out ** ... 
  yes , that 's what babies do . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/61xx2b/romania_has_launched_an_investigation_into_the/ ) was the last thread about this . 
  and eastern european distributors are n't innocent for buying it , though it does n't justify companies making two different products in the first place . 
  regional taste difference ? 
  and bulgaria did n't support the serbian claim on the adriatic , this was also dishonouring the agreement . 
  i think every balkan state had their share of such leaders ( 1885 for example ) . 
  but let 's just watch croatia vs. slovenia today . 
  you did it first in this case . 
  or another balkan war , bulgaria . 
  i wish we had sea territories . 
  at least you have that sea to help you out :( we 're stuck with this quatro staggioni bullshit here . 
  as for our extreme place , [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pe%c5%a1ter ) area is the coldest . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sjenica#geography_and_climate ) is a city from there . 
   edit : holy shit , you guys get a lot of rain in june . 
  [ tell me about it . 
  i do n't know if it 's really a thing , seen it online several times , but some scandinavians think that they live in the coldest habitable region , and that nobody south of them has experienced `` real '' winter . 
  latitude is n't that much of a factor , sven !, 
  oil refinery , fiat automobiles and metal industry . 
  hey there , belarus , we have so much in common . 
  maybe we should go out for drinks sometime . 
  hello there . 
  depends . 
  there are some companies that offer jobs to our citizens , which is nice since opening local businesses is not easy to do ( which is bad but still not the fault of foreign companies ) . 
  then there are companies that came for the free money basically . 
  sign the contract that is very much in their favour , get all the money they can in the short time , pay the workers miserably , maybe demean them a bit ( make them wear diapers , sing songs , ... ) , sell that little bit of product to get additional profit , bail . 
  that i do n't like so much . 
  albania has no say in it , kosovo albanians declared independence and that 's what this dispute is about . 
  when they achieve it , they can do whatever they want e.g. 
  join albania , which i do n't think they will . 
  these last few weeks it 's become apparent that vu\u010di\u0107 is getting ready to acknowledge kosovo as an independent state , so you can expect that to happen in 2018 , once the belgrade elections are done . 
  as for northern municipalities rejoining serbia , while that would be great , i doubt it 's gon na happen . 
  there 's * protivnik * for `` opponent '' , but * neprijatelj * is used just like the english `` enemy '' . 
  just `` neprijatelj '' . 
  i hate belgrade , crowded and unfinished suburban housing , non-maintained facades , overgrown weeds and who the fuck builds a city on top of a hill * / s * ? 
  * vrag * means `` devil '' just so you know . 
  i do n't really get what you 're asking me here . 
  * du\u0161man * can be substituted with * krvni ( zakleti , smrtni , etc. ), 
  neprijatelj * , but neither is more common since neither is in common use ; it 's not like one is the archaic version of the other . 
  my dog does n't let me on the sofa . 
  in all of europe , i 'm gon na say krakow although i 've never been , nor have i a wide experience of other european cities . 
  i mean , both are , as / u/eurovisionist7 said , too dramatic to use in everyday speech , so they 're used either jokingly or by a nationalistic politicians . 
  and i would say that * du\u0161man / du\u0161manin * is used more often because it has that archaic sound to it , which some nationalists like . 
  true , while many more of them were used during the ottoman rule ( again depending on location and people ) , but fell out of use . 
  i ninja edited that to `` legally '' , because it was n't under serbian rule and most of them came over during the ottoman rule . 
  it was n't serbian , though . 
  that 's something like * '' \u043a\u0440\u0432\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0459 '' * , like nemesis , at least that 's how it 's used most of the time . 
  * du\u0161man ( in ) * is originally from persian although it did come via turkish and is classified as a turkish loanword . 
  old serbia was till the balkan wars . 
  / u/tonygaze - the dane / u/idkfa _ cz - czech in germany , mod / u/h2ppyme - the estonian , although i knew him from / r/etymologymaps before i found this subreddit / u/eurovisionist7 - the croat i like / u/mbtiandchill - the croat that does n't / would n't like me / u/liliputput - the slovene that likes weird names / u/werkstadt - the swede i always mistake for a german / u/rafarealness - the portuguese living in netherlands + some users that i know from / r/serbia, 
  [ this ] ( https://redditenhancementsuite.com/ ) shows me the karma count [ i have given you . 
  res says i have upvoted you five times , there 's hope !, 
  yep . 
  yeah , that one looks good . 
  and i 'm sure that this style ( pic 1 and 2 ) is practical , that the buildings are ( supposed to be ) well built , and that the interior is normal , but i just really dislike the exterior . 
   i have to ask about north korea . 
  our country keeps stating how big of a threat it is and that leader kim jong-il is a lunatic that ca n't be reasoned with . 
  kim jong - ** un *** and is n't he on china 's leash ? 
  otherwise , i do n't know or care much . 
  i agree on other points with most people in this thread . 
  most are patronymic ( originally ) , while some are occupational , geographical , etc. 
  the common suffix is '' - i\u0107 '' , sometimes with something in between like `` ov/ev '' so that you get `` ovi\u0107 / evi\u0107 '' . 
  top 10 ( with english equivalents if possible ) : 1 . 
  jovanovi\u0107 - johnson , means that you are a gypsy 2 . 
  ili\u0107 - son of elliot 5 . 
  popovi\u0107 - son of the priest 9 . 
  man , i 'm really not a fan of this style . 
  i 've heard a few stories about english hooligans doing that , yeah . 
  when you ca n't bring anything into the stadium , coins will do . 
  it 's not very economic though . 
  that 's why hooligans use them . 
  and serbs will tell you tito did everything for croats , while croats will tell you he did everything for serbs . 
  that shows what a great man he was , helping everybody without discrimination .

  tako je . 
  surprise test !, 
  mark the accent of the words in the following sentence : \u201e gore gore gore gore '' . 
  yes , it 's called '' \u0161ato '' ( from french * chateau * , i presume ) but the eggwhite is also used . 
  but it 's not popular , salmonella risk probably . 
  here `` nazdravlje '' is said when someone sneezes . 
  yes , plenty . 
  serbo-croatian actually has several different * standard languages * . 
  the difference between the standard and local dialects can be significant , depending on the dialect and depending on the country .
