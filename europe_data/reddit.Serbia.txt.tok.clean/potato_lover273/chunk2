  croatia is where the difference can be the most apparent . 
  the general attitude is that the standard is the correct way of speaking , which is stupid and a shame . 
  in serbia , for example , southern dialects are `` seen '' as uneducated and bumpkinish ( `` we have seven cases , they have only four . '' ), 
  and when people from the south come to a university in belgrade they change to standard . 
  not that they would be bullied , but jokes would be made and they would n't quite fit in . 
  maybe / u/bu-rekt can say more about it , as he is from the south and is a linguist . 
  the dialects are getting more similar , afaik they 're not really being taken care of , but they 're not gon na disappear or something . 
  serbia has two standard languages , both based on actual dialects rather than being a combination of different features like some other standards . 
  one is more widely used than the other , and it 's based on is the \u0160umadija-vojvodina dialect which i 'm a native of . 
  and the accent in my area is pretty close to the standard , so not much to say . 
  there 's one joke i know , it 's not very funny , a bit long and explaining it would kill it . 
  you just insulted everyone on my mother 's side of the family . 
  * - '' [ may we ] live ! '', 
  * - `` to health ! '', 
  * \u0106in \u0106in . 
  * someone being whimsical . 
  oh , so like `` gif '' . 
  yeah , about everyday things , nothing of a serious matter . 
  what !? 
  link me . 
  but hosts tell their guests they do n't have to take the shoes off , and then the guest decides . 
  if nobody told you to keep them on and you still did , you 're a prick . 
  that 's for people you do n't know , acquaintances or people who 've never been to your home , while friends who come over often do n't need to be told anything , they just take their shoes off . 
  at least in serbia it 's like that . 
  then , no . 
  8 * nautical * schillings . 
  defo not a thing here . 
  natural gas , centralised heating . 
  do the azores count ? 
  if not , then nz or canada , maybe even somewhere in the caribbean . 
  i do n't care what people think of my country . 
  if they think * people * from my country are bad and treat them as if they were , then i would call them bigots . 
  and since they probably do n't even know one thing about the yugoslav wars , they would be bigots basing their opinions without actually `` doing the research '' * themselves * . 
  i did n't travel much and did n't tell anybody i was from serbia , did n't come up . 
   do not ask for ice in your wine people do that ? 
  i 'm not being a snob here , that 's genuinely weird . 
  besides good answers , you 'll get a few jokes and maybe one or two angry people . 
   the serbs in vojvodina , they ( in-laws ) feel that even the serbs in vojvodina do not want to be part of serbia based upon years of being mislead by the government , etc. 
  a minority . 
  most people would n't want to secede . 
  you should ask this question in / r/serbia, 
  standard languages are in relation to institutions , so if more than one country uses that language officially , you 'll have a different standard for each of those countries . 
  thus , you ca n't say `` the standard of your ** language ** '' , you should say `` which variety of your language is the standard one in your ** country ** '' . 
  in serbia that would be the \u0160umadija-vojvodina and the eastern herzegovinian * dialect * of the serbo-croatian language . 
  the specific * accents * that are standard are n't specific to towns , they are codified and only change when revised by linguists , unlike nonstandard accents that change naturally . 
  i doubt that 's true , was thinking more along the `` najbolje \u010dke '' line . 
  ma jok . 
  does n't happen . 
  i thought it was rijeka . 
  yeah , but that 's not going to make it `` the new croatia '' . 
  how about a map ? 
  the answer is history ( and geography ) . 
  countries with better economies had better circumstances and used them better than the countries that have worse economies . 
  same as what 's been said in this thread . 
  also , western as a genre was very popular , both movies and comics . 
  the protagonists of these are friends with the natives and if a character is seen saying talking shit about them , scamming them , selling them `` firewater '' , you know they 'll be getting their ass beaten . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tex_willer ) guy for example , is a chieftain of a navajo tribe . 
  the new years party . 
  the tree , santa and presents are a new years thing here , not christmas . 
  only children get the presents , though . 
  well , in order to work there the farm already has to exist . 
  that was all paid for by the owner . 
  bottom line , you would to transfer ownership of the farm to the worker . 
  why would people with capital invest into building farms if they 're not going to profit ( as much ) from it ? 
  now you have no farms or a small number of farms where the person who payed for all of it is doing the physical work and getting every penny . 
  either way people who ca n't muster up the money to buy a farm are left jobless . 
  the owner has the capital which he invests into building the farm , has to pay for maintenance , tax , has to have money for unexpected problems , etc. 
  what are you saying should be done ? 
  should they split the profit ( after paying for the expenses ) equally ? 
  but most of the work is done by the physical worker , why should he be paid only half ? 
   insurance is n't going to heal a leg , or return a finger . 
  what kind of a statement is this ? 
  more money to the worker wo n't do that either . 
   would n't you say labour is worth something ? 
  it 's worth their wage . 
  if you think it 's not enough , then you do n't have a problem with `` absentee ownership '' , you have a problem with private business regulations . 
   those able to establish absentee ownership often are n't either , and contrary to the workers , the owners are n't at a physical risk either . 
  i phrased that wrong . 
  i meant that they 're the ones who paid for everything and the ones who will continue doing that . 
  as for physical risk , there 's insurance . 
  if you think it 's not satisfactory , then again you have a problem with regulations , take it up to the parliament . 
  yes . 
  they just work there , did n't pay for anything and are n't at a financial risk . 
  there are more people with * my * surname in the netherlands than there are those with yours . 
  hide yo clogs , hide yo tulips , we 're taking over the dykes !, 
  neither , regular relations . 
  both are in the top 20 . 
  i do n't know . 
  what happened in the country after the army left would be more `` tragic '' , but the whole string of events should be looked at , not just separate episodes . 
  wwi , which is not a single event i guess , but i ca n't really break that one down and pick just one . 
  ... for now . 
  it 's full of electrolytes !, 
  after checking it seems to be about being ignorant , naive , but i 've heard it used for not closing doors , i guess incorrectly . 
  because the lord does n't close his door on anyone :p, 
  that one 's used here as well , also `` in a flowerpot '' . 
  lithuanian and slovak . 
  i might actually pick up the basics of gothic , thanks for mentioning it . 
  romania and russia would be in the same group , but not black sea countries . 
  the green bit is just a small fraction of romania , so romania would belong to continental europe . 
  going by my rules there would be no black sea europe , except for maybe georgia .
