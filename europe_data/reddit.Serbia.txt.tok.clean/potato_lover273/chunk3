  [ and here 's a little song i wrote . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo4onqpwjkc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=32 ), 
  too many factors give us inconsistent division with one region named after a cardinal direction , another named after a historical region , etc. 
  that 's why i decided to go with seas . 
  [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/2fmis ) 's a little map i made . 
  and [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/mrmut ) 's the same map in its original proportion . 
  if the coloured area is larger than the rest of the country , then the country belongs to that particular region . 
  other things should also be considered ( population size of the region , location of the capital , ... ) and that country 's status adjusted accordingly . 
  which one do you speak ? ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ [ joking ], 
  that 's why english is better , you kill two birds with one stone . 
  as for idioms , that was in relation to art and entertainment which can suffer because of it . 
  do n't reply to this comment . 
  taxation as a concept is accepted , how it 's done in serbia and how the funds are handled is disliked . 
   1 ) there 's still a majority against it have n't seen a proper poll made about this recently . 
  you say `` still '' , as if that 's always been the case . 
  at the beginning of the century `` for eu '' was the absolute majority , it has been waning over years . 
  but does esperanto have hollywood ? 
  what about idioms , puns and all the little nuances that are easily overlooked ? 
  i know , but it 's already working to a degree . 
  artificial lingua franca would be a logistical nightmare and so would n't be achieved fully either , actually it would n't even reach the level of english today . 
  i do n't feel slighted because some other language was chosen . 
  english is the best option . 
  why use an artificial language when there 's a pre-existing one that not only lets you communicate with others but also has movies , books , music , ... made in it ? 
  i meant like [ this ] ( http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/programevaluation/files/2015/08/got-idea.jpg ) . 
   * lambist v\u00f5tma * - `` to take something out of a lamp '' - to come up with something very randomly the light bulb ? 
  yeah , that too . 
  - `` to look through someone 's fingers . 
  '' , letting someone off easy . 
  - `` knows about x as much as mary knows about dick . 
  '' , which is jack shit . 
  - `` force does n't plead with god . 
  '' , there 's no helping it , the powerful do as they please . 
   ** la mama naibii ** which literally translates to ** at the devil 's mother ** and is a vulgar way of saying something is far away . 
  we have something similar , `` mother 's pussy '' . 
  hijacking !, 
  - `` good morning , columbus !, 
  '' , when someone * finally * understands a point , gets to a conclusion . 
  - `` thinks he 's invented hot water . 
  '' , when someone comes up with something that 's actually common knowledge . 
  - `` sleeping as if his throat was slit . 
  '' , self-explanatory . 
  [ here 's a skit about it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjvaxni-dbi ), 
  yes , with [ these ] ( http://www.worldstandards.eu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/electricity-tiles-type-f-200-px.jpg ) . 
  the outlets are not loose , but doing this keeps them safe from wear . 
  in serbian dialects it 's easier . 
  some croats afaik do n't pronounce them differently , some do but slightly . 
  these are serbian [ '' \u010d '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:voiceless_retroflex_affricate.ogg ) and [ '' \u0107 '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:voiceless_alveolo-palatal_affricate.ogg ) . 
  they differ from slovene and croatian [ '' \u010d '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:voiceless_palato-alveolar_affricate.ogg ) , which is the same as the english `` ch '' . 
  croatian '' \u0107 '' , where existent , is a bit softer and i could n't find an ipa recording . 
  i made [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/gkklb ) visual representation of their closeness . 
  not really , but almost nobody has 0 knowledge . 
  those who speak bad english are not stigmatised , because you ca n't stigmatise a big number of people . 
  and it 's just a school subject , if you slack off while studying serbian , history , geography , ... , you 'll do the same thing with english . 
  yeah , but on its own i think `` lj '' is the hardest for them . 
  they kind of get '' \u010d , \u0107 , d\u017e , \u0111 , \u0161 , \u017e '' , more so in croatian than in serbian dialects , but still . 
  as for `` r '' , when anglos learn to `` roll '' it , they ca n't stop and keep stressing it , like `` look what i can do !, 
  hot dog 's retarded brother . 
  culinary elitism . 
  burek is a pastry with filling . 
  in bosnia they use meat , if anything else is used they refuse ( vehemently ) to call it `` burek '' and istead say e.g. 
  `` cheese pie '' . 
  in other ( ex-yu ) countries it 's `` burek with x '' , in bosnia it 's just `` burek '' . 
  that in the photo is a cheese burek . 
  local ? 
  nope . 
  [ pljeskavica ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/3f/bd/eb/calimero-food-bar.jpg ) is the most iconic , but there 's plenty of other stuff : [ \u0107evapi ] ( http://www.femina.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/sarajevski-cevapi-u-lepinji.jpg ) ( u lepinji ) , [ kara\u0111or\u0111eva \u0161nicla ] ( http://static.mondo.rs/picture/368094/jpeg/karadjordjeva-snicla.jpg ) with its variations , [ burek ] ( http://pekara-brankovic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/burek-sa-sirom.jpg ) ( bosnians , fuck off . 
  ) , etc. 
  european comic scene is different and superheroes definitely are n't the focus . 
  there might be a comic or two by a european author but that 's it . 
  23 \u00b0 c with 57 % humidity . 
  aircon turned on . 
  one in spain . 
  this guy is american , should i downvote him ? 
  it 's to do with the whole smoked meat tradition we have going on . 
  we eat bacon raw here . 
  for sure , brovis . 
  i loved the [ big in kirgistan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2esslnp4ulu ) special they did . 
  eh , do n't worry about it . 
  there 's a restaurant or two in bigger cities , but it 's not popular . 
  yeah , my bad . 
  [ \u0110avolja varo\u0161 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%90avolja_varo%c5%a1 ) , [ uvac canyon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uvac ) with its [ ice cave ] ( https://www.tripadvisor.com/locationphotodirectlink-g2362531-d4114841-i110031969-special_nature_reserve_uvac-nova_varos_central_serbia.html ) - these two are more mainstream , together with our national parks . 
  two lakes with ** floating islands ** , how cool is that ? 
  [ vlasina lake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vlasina_lake ) and [ semete\u0161 lake ] ( https://sr.wikipedia.org/sr-el/%d0%a1%d0%b5%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%82%d0%b5%d1%88%d0%ba%d0%be_%d1%98%d0%b5%d0%b7%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%be ) . 
  a neat little [ vrelo river ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vrelo_ ( river \\ ) ) , 365 meters long , nicknamed godina ( `` year '' ) . 
  what i would recommend is food and drink festivals . 
  there 's plenty of those all over the country and that 's a fun way of experiencing the local cuisine . 
  maybe the most famous one is the [ leskovac grill fest ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leskovac_grill_festival ) , great for people who do n't have access to this type of fast food ( most europeans ) . 
  it 's the only surviving [ paleo-balkan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paleo-balkan_languages ) language . 
  when and whence it came can not really be known , since that happened long ago with no written records . 
  it is an indo-european language though , meaning it has a shared origin with most european languages . 
   how did it resist external influence ? 
  mountains . 
   my mother gets very hot at night . 
  common here and just as you said : if you can afford it , you 'll install it . 
  those who ca n't , at least get an electric fan . 
  then every beach in serbia will have locals . 
  greece . 
  no specific beach afaik . 
  hmm ... then , do you often die in the mountains ?
