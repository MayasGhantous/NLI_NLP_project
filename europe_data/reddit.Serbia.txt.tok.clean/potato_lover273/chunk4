  no , but it means you 'll be having guests that day . 
  same thing here , with two written papers per semester covering these books . 
  oh , you get to choose . 
  i do n't know if we 're misunderstanding op 's question , but do other countries not have a curriculum where you 're supposed to read a book per month and later be questioned on it ? 
  i doubt it 's just a yugo thing . 
  same , but definitely did n't happen to me . 
  i doubt i was absent during the time . 
  really ? 
  that did n't happen to me . 
  better than nazis . 
  not that i 'm a special snowflake , but no . 
  lithuania . 
  a spoof on chat room handles , specifically on fan clubs hence the `` lover '' part . 
  the underscore and number are random , but still go with the handle theme . 
  `` potato '' because some chats have censorship that replaces the bad word with some other , and i 've seen some that do it with `` potato '' . 
  what it 's censoring when it comes to my username is up to interpretation . 
  not really common . 
   only in serbia they use fyrom nope . 
  it 's the official stance of our government , but nobody calls it that , not even tv presenters . 
  it has n't . 
  the exact same thing here . 
  we shallow fry , in pans and stuff . 
  not at all . 
  depends on the phonology only . 
  and the only ones close enough to have the same accent , are ukrainian and belarusian . 
  not really . 
   non - ~ ~ slavic ~ ~ ** russian ** accent the same for every eastern european country . 
  not gaber ? 
  football . 
  exactly as you say . 
  here it is in serbo-croatian : pas jede \u010doveka . 
  183 , average . 
  see , here we have different words for two types and i thought it was the same with english ( soup vs stew ) , but apparently not . 
  here soup is broth with noodles or dumplings . 
  well til . 
  even so , my favourite soup is ~ ~ chicken ~ ~ noodle soup , which i 'm actually eating right now . 
  ** edit : ** apparently `` chicken soup '' has meat chunks in it . 
  so , basically broth that was cooked with chicken and vegetables , strained + homemade noodles . 
  you can make it with a bouillion cube and store bought noodles , but it 's much better homemade . 
  [ social liberalism . 
  ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=67.1&amp;d=67.6&amp;g=66.5&amp;s=73.7 ), 
  it 's too far , too expensive , not really thought of as a tourist location . 
  a killer and a war profiteer . 
  do n't know what 's controversial about that . 
  no let 3 ? 
  i 'm disappointed . 
  depends , since it 's completely illegal . 
  there are some i like , there are many i do n't like and probably none i dislike . 
  in the whole world , not just europe . 
  i agree with you about the culture but is n't there the aspect of animal psychology to think about ? 
  to what extent do different animals bond with humans ? 
  i think that would be a significant ethical issue , especially with humane treatment in mind . 
  how would you nurture them without mutual bonding ? . 
  see , in serbo-croatian ( and other slavic languages ) it 's similar , tuesday , thursday and friday are `` second , fourth and fifth '' respectively . 
  what i 've read though , is that it could be `` second [ after sunday ] '' and it makes sense since monday is `` after sunday '' here . 
  furthermore , wednesday means `` middle '' and if what i 've said here is correct , then it would be the fourth day , exactly the middle instead of the third day it is now . 
  someone could say it 's in the middle now since it 's in the middle of the workdays , but weekend is imported from the anglosphere and was n't a thing back when people thought of these names . 
  why would i care about america giving classified information to russia and not about america having it in the first place ? 
  peter i of serbia , he ascended the throne when he was [ quite old ] ( http://www.pokimica.com/katalog/image_large/krunisanje1_large.jpg ) ( still banging imo ) , but here 's a couple of photos of his younger self : [ 1 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/petar_karadjordjevic_1875.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/sr/e/e9/petar_a._karadjordjevic%2c_tj._petar_mrkonjic_-_1875.jpg ) . 
  ujedinjeno kraljevstvo - uk velika britanija ( or just britanija ) - great britain engleska - england all used , with `` uk '' used the least . 
  when people use `` engleska '' for it they do n't really think that the whole country is just england , they know about scotland , wales and northern ireland , but it 's still used because england is the main player . 
  they might not know what 's the difference between great britain and uk though . 
  but my sweat would bother me more that of those nearby . 
  what about sweating or the sun ? 
  some people mix it with spaghetti . 
  `` dear god , did you see how he looks ? 
  i bet he 's a druggie . '', 
  said by old people whenever they see someone who looks `` alternative '' ( piercings , tattoos , brightly coloured hair , ... ) . 
  you 're rambling . 
  almost every country is multi-ethnic . 
  the numbers do n't matter . 
  you said it does n't represent ** all ** the citizens . 
  and there 's albanians , turks , macedonians , aromanians , ... in greece . 
  i guess you need to change your name . 
  and 100 % of the [ former yugoslav ] republic of macedonia is in the modern geographical macedonia . 
  i do n't see the problem . 
  and you can see the grey line . 
  so , you should n't call that piece you have just `` macedonia '' and forbid other countries from doing the same thing . 
  i do n't help children . 
  no , that 's not all of macedonia . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_ ( region ), 
  alright , they did n't copy the symbol * from * hittites , they copied the symbol that was of hittite origin . 
  byzantines took the image from hittites . 
  serbian ruling dynasty took it from the byzantines . 
  modern serbian state decided to go with that . 
  why did they copy hittites ? 
  no problem . 
  yes , in serbian dialects the tip of the tongue touches the upper front teeth , while in slovene the tip touches the ridge above those teeth . 
  in croatia , it depends on the dialect really . 
  kajkavian ( language actually ) has it ( think tito ) and i think even chakavian , but do n't take my word for it . 
  you can read more [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dental,_alveolar_and_postalveolar_lateral_approximants#velarized_alveolar_lateral_approximant ) . 
  you can actually see that the dental variation is actually the odd one out when it comes to the slavic languages , same with the way \u010c is pronounced in most serbian dialects . 
  a white double-headed eagle . 
  sign me up for kajkavian . 
  i know it 's a joke , but it 's not the same thing . 
  both macedonia and styria are divided between countries and its parts are called macedonia/styria by those countries . 
  but when one country denies the other its name for some reason and still calls its own territory by the same name , then it 's a problem . 
  like if the austrian styria seceded only to find itself denied the name because there 's another styria inside slovenian borders saying `` you ca n't be called that because you 're only a part of the greater region of styria . 
  also , op , what you 're talking about would just be called a market here . 
  flea markets are different , more wild and selling everything and anything .
