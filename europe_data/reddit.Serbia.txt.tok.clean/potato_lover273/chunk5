   ** aegean ** macedonia ftfy, 
  haha , right . 
  as rivals ? 
  bulgarians and , in the recent history , croats . 
  with bulgarians things do n't go further than backstabbing jokes , and with croats it 's tabloids and populist scares on both sides . 
  some serbs hate croats ( and vice versa ) while the rest do n't give two hoots about their neighbours . 
  if someone from anywhere in serbia even knows about sikhs , they 'll think of them as an ethnic group in india . 
  means `` stiff '' in serbo-croatian . 
  oh yeah , that 's common . 
  to have a blend of features from different dialects act as the standard language . 
  they are counted as separate dialects , as long as they 're still in use . 
  not as diverse as italy , but yeah . 
   the standard croatian languages has actually 0 dialects . 
  of course not . 
  standard language is the variety ( dialect ) of a language chosen to be in official use . 
  it 's cool , i got you . 
  there 's plenty of `` small '' animals that are indigenous to europe , many species of birds , fish , insects , etc. 
  ca n't really look through all that and check if they 're unique to europe , though . 
  so , here 's a few of the `` big ones '' you might find interesting . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mouflon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_jackal https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fallow_deer, 
  hey , man . 
  thanks for this , looks very interesting . 
  how could you not mention [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olm ) ? 
  bulgarian , macedonian , slovenian and slovakian . 
  these racist terms op heard might not be offensive at all in those languages . 
  maybe he heard `` neger '' or whatever in hungary and connected that to the american slurs . 
  and bacon . 
  not getting involved was n't really an option for serbia . 
  it 's viewed as a war in which the good guys won . 
  as serbs fighting to protect their homeland . 
  no , but it 's probably been used for centuries and people back then knew why that would be a good name for a human being . 
  hey , mine too !, 
  well , ash is a hardwood and was used extensively for making weapons and stuff , while roses are one the the most recognisable flowers + all the love stuff . 
  wait ... is that your name ? 
  or potato . 
  sounds similar to * gabor * , which means '' [ a very ] ugly person '' . 
  over here it is on the street view , but [ blurred ] ( https://www.google.rs/maps/place/embassy+of+the+united+states+of+america/@44.7723998,20.4546224,3a,75y,290.6h,84.37t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sbrdo3lpacsdsox-vomm-8w!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo0.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dbrdo3lpacsdsox-vomm-8w%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d186.41705%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x475a704985514103:0xeca0aba8444d1040!8m2!3d44.77249!4d20.453249 ) . 
  [ from a different point of view . 
  ] ( http://photos.state.gov/libraries/serbia/432416/2013/nec-belgrade-1.jpg ), 
  vuk - wolf golub - pigeon goran - a person who likes mountains or something like that vera - faith ( although i do n't know if this is the origin ) vi\u0161nja - cherry ( [ this sort ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prunus_cerasus ) ) divna - wonderful dunja - quince jagoda - strawberry jasna - clear , as in `` your intentions are clear enough . '', 
  mila - dear nada - hope ru\u017ea - rose there are some more , but they might be homophones or homographs . 
  [ it 's okay i guess ] ( http://www.betonplus.co.rs/upload/images/zoom/americk2.jpg ) , but yeah other nations ' embassies fit nicely into the environment . 
  one other thing is that i 've seen armed guards in front of the american one , that 's a bit standoffish . 
  here ? 
  probably . 
  / r/europe ? 
  camping with barbecue and beer . 
  yeah , i had the idea that they 're all relatively closely related but that huchen and trout were much closer to each other than to salmon . 
  not that i 've given it much thought . 
  learn something every day . 
  never eaten one . 
  you mention the huchen which i thought was a trout , thanks for enlightening me . 
  just give it time , you 'll love it . 
  alexander graham bell, 
  around 24 \u00b0 c for both . 
  i meant not all expressions are the same . 
  op 's question :  does your country have similar idioms mentioning other nationalities ? 
  ( self.askeurope ) my country is not croatia but the same idiom is used . 
  it 's not always the same . 
  same . 
  it is universal but it 's shit , corruption , bad conditions ( both for workers and patients ) , long waiting times , bad treatment options ... do n't know how much per month , i do n't work . 
  the surname is one of the most common , the name is not but it sounds `` better '' in this case . 
  it 's not common to name your child after your surname . 
  early middle ages with those tribal migrations , forming kingdoms , dwindling paganism . 
  mangulicu . 
  the design looks byzantine/serbian medieval enough , minus the eagles who are still better than the parrots . 
  the crown i do n't think is needed , while the cross could be added . 
  do n't know about that but i 'll say that i would love our flag carrier 's logo to be our national flag . 
  compare : [ current flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/flag_of_serbia.svg/2000px-flag_of_serbia.svg.png ) and [ air serbia logo ] ( https://stocklogos.com/sites/default/files/air-serbia-2.jpg ) . 
   what do you like about this sub ? 
  what makes you stick around ? 
  this sub is about cultural exchange , people learn about other countries . 
  it 's not like / r/europe with all the politics and day by day news articles that lead to heated arguments . 
  that 's why i like this sub . 
   what could use an improvement ? 
  this one ties in with the next question . 
  a lot of comments are left alone , no further discussion . 
  certain threads make it look like people do n't look at other answers ( `` i said what i had k bye '' ) . 
  i know this is up to the users and mods can not do much . 
  people here who say that the traffic is very good and that more would make the sub worse . 
  i agree with that but only when it comes to the number of top level comments , as i said i would n't mind more comment chains . 
  questions here vary from those related to countries to those about personal opinions of users . 
  the number of top level comments in the latter can not be influenced , but it can with the former . 
  because europe has a limited amount of countries we should have a limited amount of top level comments , but that 's not always the case and sometimes we get a couple of answers from the same country . 
  this can be fixed and prevent problems some users would have if the traffic increased . 
  push those comments into the same comment chain to make threads more readable . 
   would you say your country has a strong enough presence here ? 
  yeah . 
  mods , you are great . 
  thank you . 
  users here could help make the list of all these subreddits , if a user knows about / r/askeurope , chances are he knows the situation of his national subreddit . 
  in the end it benefits everyone , the one who wants the answers will get more of those on a national subreddit and people here wo n't be `` blocked '' from threads about a specific country . 
  yes , from time to time a person will come here with a loaded question looking for confirmation and acceptance of their political views . 
  sort of `` funny '' , because it 's fast with all the `` ta '' sounds . 
  specify which orthodox church . 
  this does not happen here . 
  some old women in rural areas wear them , because that was the tradition when they were young . 
  how do the us soldiers fight for nato ? 
  are they that convicted to saving the lives of french , british , turkish , etc. 
  citizens ?
