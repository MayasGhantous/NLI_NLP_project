  no , it 's an alliance formed by mutual interests . 
  same shit with eu . 
  not for aligning with germany but for the occupation of yugoslavia 's territories . 
  take a look at [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_federal_republic_of_yugoslavia#federal_subjects ) , slovenes adjusted their design . 
  we can but not always , and i think i was n't clear . 
   best you can get is `` politics is a whore '' by this i meant that the best meaning someone could extract from `` kurva politika . '', 
  is `` politics is a whore . '', 
  and worst `` whore . 
  politics . '', 
  * kurva * just means `` whore '' and it 's not used as an exclamation like in english `` fuck ! '', 
  saying `` kurva '' in serbo-croatian is similar to saying `` whore '' in english , just an insult . 
  in serbo-croatian best you can get is `` politics is a whore '' , otherwise it 's just two nouns next to each other without any meaning to it . 
  nyet , is not horse . 
  war criminals , can not into eu , generic eastern european workers and what i 've found out on reddit is that serbia is a russian trojan horse . 
  makes me feel trusted and welcome . 
  shit , and i clearly remember saying it in my head . 
  fixed now .

  i do n't think anything 's that bad . 
  maybe [ pihtije ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aspic#pihtije ) , i personally do n't like it but maybe they would . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novak_djokovic ), 
  serb = ethnicity serbian = should be `` any person from serbia '' , but means `` a serb from ( central ) serbia '' so , all serbians are serbs but not all serbs are serbians . 
  serbians do n't live in bosnia , serbs do . 
  bosnia and herzegovina did n't not secede from serbia , but from yugoslavia . 
   ... did not want to seceed from ~ ~ serbia ~ ~ yugoslavia that is too tangled to discuss , at least for me . 
  serbs in bosnia and herzegovina never were a part of a serbian nation state , why now ? 
  if they want to , i do n't see why i would want them to join . 
  chose what ? 
  no , national states are sooo 19th century . 
  seriosuly though , if serbs in bosnia ca n't get along with bosniaks , why would i want to live in the same country ? 
  another thing is economy , neither one is very good at it and joining would strain this even more . 
  i do n't agree fully . 
  let 's leave it at that . 
  no , i meant to say that [ the history of ] the modern state began in the 19th century and so medieval rulers would * technically * not fit op 's requirement ( '' ... leader in your country 's history '' ) . 
  are you joking ? 
   `` a lie has short legs ''  `` the morning is wiser than the evening '' we have these two word for word . 
  and you can freely change the order of these words . 
  i would n't really count our medieval rulers as good leaders , at least by modern standards . 
  also , technically since this country did n't exist in that time period , it 's not a part of its history . 
  the worst was [ slobodan milo\u0161evi\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slobodan_milo%c5%a1evi%c4%87 ) . 
  the greatest , i honestly do n't know . 
  as long as you do n't touch serbian yogurt , we 're cool . 
  friendly ? 
  with us it 's either friendly or a rival . 
  presidential elections in april . 
  i 'll be voting for our ( now ) former ombudsman . 
  finland , because finns are awesome !, 
  i `` shot '' a shotgun when i was little while my hunter uncle held it and pointed it into a ditch . 
  basically just pulled a trigger and that 's why i checked `` i have no experience with firearms '' . 
  there are occasional spurts of interest , where i binge watch hickok45 and read up on stuff . 
  however , do n't plan on getting them at any in the future . 
  laws are restrictive here and i 'm * not in the least * political about them as i only appreciate guns for their designs , the technology , history , etc. 
  and do n't think of them as self-defence weapons . 
  archer fx . 
  so , serbs are represented as either war criminals or just generic eastern europeans with a russian accent . 
  do n't have anything to say about it really , we 're not very important so we do n't catch much attention . 
  * ma\u010dkica * , diminutive of `` cat '' and * ribica * , diminutive of `` fish '' . 
  it 's not common to say this though , and the second one is used by parents when teaching their daughters . 
  feeling a bit sleazy writing this because of the second one . 
  this sounds like a pre-internet times rumour . 
  not in serbia , it 's adjusted to our phonology . 
  [ ukrainian flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_ukraine ) + their sweet [ coat of arms ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_ukraine ) . 
  baltic trio has pretty nice flags and slovakia has one of the few where i do n't mind the coat of arms being on the actual flag . 
  bird people , unite !, 
  same stuff in several other languages , and exact same situation in serbo-croatian with * kurac * . 
  and it 's appropriate since `` eggs '' is used for testicles . 
  in serbo-croatian it 's `` coward '' . 
  just piggybacking , it 's the same deal all over the place ( balkans and the ex-k . und k. ) . 
  but speaking about serbia , it 's legal and does n't have the negative connotation at all , because it 's not made of shoes and sugar by a redneck in the mountains . 
  it 's actually been raised as negative of the eu , `` if we join , the west will forbid us from making rakija !, 
  i 'm racking my brain but ca n't think of anything . 
  there 's no such expression in serbian i guess . 
  `` is there a bear dancing ? '', 
  meaning : `` what are you looking at ? '', 
  `` to release a flea . '', 
  to start a rumour . 
  `` bangs like maxim on the division . '', 
  speaks nonsense . 
  `` i did n't suck on oars . '', 
  similar to `` i was n't born yesterday '' . 
  `` carry yourself . '', 
  polite `` fuck you '' . 
  `` does n't have a hair on his tongue . '', 
  will speak his mind . 
  similar thing in serbian , `` what which dick ? 
  because they 're all south of italian northern border or ... ? 
  somersby 's what happened in serbia , but it died down not long after . 
  was it somersby ? 
  oooh , interesting . 
  cabbage is more popular here , i 've only eaten the other kind twice . 
  so it 's pretty similar to [ sarma ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarma_ ( food ) ) . 
  what do you put in those rolls in finland ? 
  [ bad copy - esi mi dobar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ovy7mmssys ) [ bad copy - reperske fore ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15rtbv3isvc ) [ bad copy - uno , due , tre ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9stnj0ocuew ) ( love seeing italians react to this one ) [ bdat d\u017eutim - nazad u danu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d11u7cbkyva ) [ dje\u010daci - bile starke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyhweu-qasg ) [ dubioza kolektiv - walter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdz3jub0c1m ) [ dubioza kolektiv - blam blam ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkctopui8fw ), 
  whatsapp ( pronounced as `` what 's up '' ) , viber and facebook messenger . 
  books were in be , different teachers had different pronunciation . 
  initially i was doing the ae but a year or two i noticed how i had developed a problem with the r sound , so i switched ( not received pronunciation though ) . 
  i see nobody mentioned italian comics , bonelli and essegesse . 
  as for real superheroes i know of [ cat claw ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cat_claw ) by bane kerac . 
  that should be a thing here . 
   weekends the time you have to yourself ?
