  i do n't and have never watched baseball but i think it 's a very interesting sport . 
  i do n't really mind , just saying that other slavic languages do n't use it that way ( as far as i know ) . 
  as far as i know it 's only used in polish that way . 
  * ko\u0161mar * ( `` nightmare '' ) is from french , * cauchemar * . 
  makes me glad we 're landlocked ... no , it does n't . 
  and became a judge of the dead , together with his brothers . 
  thank you , kindred soul !, 
  just remove the coat of arms and we 're [ cool .

  yes . 
  banat would be ^ ^ ^ almost whole again . 
  i guess i would have to learn romanian . 
  this new position would not be bad at all , eu while still being able to go shopping in serbia . 
   serbia , for pljeskavica maybe visit the leskovac ro\u0161tiljijada ( lit . 
  barbecuefest ) . 
  what if i am the bull ? 
  ... they lie in romanian , keep silent in greek , count in aromanian , in church sing in russian , that they 're most wise in turkish and only when they intend to kill , they speak out in their native - serbian language . 
  reasonable . 
  nah , that 's just because it 's finnish . 
  too hard , man . 
  the custom here is that you pay for the knife to circumvent the superstition . 
  this ... calls for a change of plans . 
   happy to leave here freudian slip ? 
   bitch got slain by milo\u0161 obili\u0107 . 
  just read what the frenchman said , honestly . 
  you said `` fuck russia . 
  terrorists are responsible for terrorism . 
  i fucked up writing . 
  then i suggest the new name be czechiania . 
  named after its people , the czechians . 
  ** edit : ** wrote `` ch '' instead of `` cz '' . 
  yeah , but after the change some would call them czechians , as they do with other '' - ia countries '' . 
  same edit as down there . 
  then call it bohemia and be done with it . 
  moravia can pout but it would n't be the first time calling a country `` incorrectly '' . 
  one more thing . 
  you anglophones make things worse :d . what would you call chech people after that ? 
  it does n't sound right , just as you would say cr ( like uk/usa ) does n't . 
  ninja edit : also fyrom, 
  not every `` eastern european '' country needs to end in '' - ia '' . 
  is chech republic really that hard to say ? 
  we call it \u010ce\u0161ka . 
  serbia 's south so it 's not that dark . 
  i live in the northern part and it snowed couple of times here , but only the lightest amount . 
  below zero for the last five or six days . 
  [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ddn7a ) was on sunday . 
  you should try doing this in a hall . 
  [ relevant . 
  always loved turul , awesome creature . 
  `` that 70s show '' was broadcast here ten years ago and i watched it eventually . 
  never heard of `` veggietales '' , that would n't fly here . 
  nah , * boja * comes from turkish . 
  * `` two guys and a girl are walking , one is hitting on her , the other one is a bee . '', 
  the joke is that * je muva * can mean both `` is hitting on her '' and `` is a fly '' . 
  * `` a man visits a doctor and says - `` doctor , my eye is welling up '' , and the doctor tapers it . '', 
  here the joke is that `` suzi '' can mean both `` is welling up '' and `` taper it/make it narrower '' , albeit with different stressing . 
  kurac na \u010delo . 
  * `` what do you get when you ask for a poached egg ? 
  dick on the forehead . '', 
  poached egg is , word for word , `` egg on [ the ] ~ ~ forehead ~ ~ ** eye ** '' , but egg is also used for balls ( testicles ) . 
  both bogdan and bo\u017eidar are used . 
  bogdan as a surname , too . 
  j is read as y. 
  yeah , i know . 
  `` iron '' probably came from `` nail '' here . 
  we have * \u017eelezo * , too but it 's archaic . 
  `` railway '' ( system ) is * \u017eeleznica * . 
  nothing like * hvozd * , though . 
  haha , yeah that could be true . 
  `` was n't hoping '' can have the meaning of `` was n't expecting '' . 
  yeah , there 's bojana for girls , though . 
  gvozden was never a child . 
  gvozden spawns as a 40-50 year old geezer with old man strength . 
  there 's slavic vesna , the goddess of spring . 
  common name in serbia . 
  that 's cool . 
  gu\u0161a - throat, 
  yeah , svetlana but stress on the first syllable . 
  tyler and lee . 
  bojan would be the slavic equivalent of gun . 
  there 's nade\u017eda in serbo-croatian , but it would be shortened to nada . 
  na\u0111a ( nadya ) is also in use but as a given name rather than as a nickname . 
  i do n't have that problem . 
  * gu\u0161iti * is `` to choke '' here , so ... 
  cute . 
  oh , loads of them . 
  these are just some interesting examples : * gvozden - literally `` iron '' ( adj. ), 
  * jugoslav - `` yugoslav '' = `` south '' + `` glory '' / `` celebrate '' / `` slav ? '', 
  * miodrag - sort of a pleonasm , `` dear-darling '' * neboj\u0161a - `` does n't fear '' * nenad - `` does n't / no hope '' * puni\u0161a - root is `` full '' * slobodan - literally `` free '' * strahinja - root is `` fear '' * vuk - literally `` wolf '' a weird one is ma\u0161inka which apparently comes from marija ( mary ) , but that would n't be your first thought . 
  your first thought would be `` machine-ka '' or even better `` automatic rifle '' . 
  ** ninja edit : ** just noticed all of them are male names . 
  someone should add girl names . 
  ** edit 2 : ** how could i forget srboljub - `` serb-lover '' . 
  we also du\u0161an but its meaning ( probably ) comes from * du\u0161a * or * duh * , meaning `` soul '' and `` spirit '' respectively . 
  is that a language ? 
  or danish people . 
  * gospodin * ( mr ) , * gospo\u0111a * ( mrs ) and * gospo\u0111ica * ( ms ) . 
  there are abbreviations , * g. * , * g\u0111a * and * g\u0111ica * but almost nobody uses those . 
  meaning was `` master , lord '' , but nowadays you would use * gospodar * for that . 
  lord , as in god , is * gospod * , but in the middle ages * gospodin * was used ( , too ?
