  aw , i wanted to brag about the music fountain we 'll have soon . 
  anyway , we have drinking fountains . 
  most do n't shoot up a stream like the one in the picture , but have a classic faucet . 
  some are small , some are big . 
  not in schools , though . 
  the name is serbo-croatian . 
  whether he was a serb or a croat does n't matter . 
  no , from south slavs in hungary . 
  one has to die , ca n't keep adding new surnames to infinity . 
  but with a new meaning , so it counts . 
  also paprika . 
  and craic . 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/spruce#etymology i did n't know this . 
  i thought `` mammoth '' was estonian . 
  if someone is talking on the bus it 's : a ) people who know each other b ) a drunkard c ) people grumbling about driving , bus being crowded , open windows , etc. 
  older people might strike up a conversation even if they do n't know each other , but that 's rare . 
  i do the same thing as you . 
  nobody has tried to converse with me while i was wearing headphones but if they had , i would 've told them to quit it . 
  lawyers do n't just sue . 
  top comment says it 's called olivier salad . 
  i doubt it spread from macedonia to everywhere in europe . 
  google gives me results that make me think french and russian salad are the same , at least in ex-yu cuisine . 
  but these are not religious customs . 
  going to mass on christmas and other ( i do n't know how it works with protestants ) is what you as a christian are supposed to do . 
  getting a christmas tree , presents , etc. , have nothing to do with faith and are folk traditions . 
  but why did you say it 's macedonian ? 
  religion has a huge influence on a culture . 
  this does n't mean that danish people are religious . 
  yeah , that 's definitely it . 
  they may be christian traditions , but only because they were started by christian people , not because they have something to do with god . 
  a special cake you eat for christmas has nothing to do with the birth of christ except that you eat it on the day you celebrate that event . 
  eating that cake will not make you a christian , and not eating it will not make you an atheist . 
  not op , but i think he meant [ \u0161opska salata ] ( http://static.mondo.rs/picture/347116/jpeg/sopska-salata.jpg ) which , as far as i know , does n't contain mayo that the french poster mentioned . 
  russian salad . 
  japanese wind , it 's [ this ] ( http://tatypolitan.com/wp-content/themes/yamidoo/scripts/timthumb.php?src=http://tatypolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/japanski-vetar.jpg&amp;w=310&amp;h=225&amp;zc=1 ) cake . 
  [ bavarian rolls ] ( http://www.agropress.org.rs/media/k2/items/cache/5b74e738223d177a4030153c35f64896_xl.jpg ) , i do n't know if these are known as such in germany . 
   this makes it very hard to be an atheist in denmark , because if you want to be an atheist you have to not celebrate any obviously religious holidays i do n't think so . 
  as long as you do n't believe in a deity you 're an atheist . 
  you do n't spend the whole year thinking there 's no god and then believe in him on christmas . 
  it 's a part of your culture , why not celebrate it . 
  many traditions around these holidays have a pagan/folk origin anyway . 
  this term is not used in my country , although many are something similar . 
  and apparently dying in the mountains . 
  sapunjara . 
  [ damn straight . 
  ] ( http://zivotnimagazin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hleb-mast-i-aleva-paprika.jpg ), 
  netherlands is * holandija * , that 's the official name . 
  there 's * nizozemska * , which is a calque of netherlands , but that 's used in croatia . 
  i doubt people know the difference . 
  oh and the people are * holan\u0111ani * . 
  if you 're talking about football , you 're talking about the premier league , so it 's england . 
  if you 're talking about politics you 're talking about the country whose capital is london , so it 's england / [ great ] britain , does n't matter which word you use . 
  uk is rarely used americans - * amerikanci * , slang is * ameri * . 
  yankee is definitely not common . 
  i would like milder summers , the rest i like . 
  hungary has the best military , so them . 
  sorry , romanians . 
  yeah , who has money for whips ? 
  and by conjecture , disabled grandmas . 
  i guess it would be hungarians , stressing the first syllable . 
  no strippers , no euros . 
  in preschool it 's * vaspita\u010dica * ( i do n't know if there are any men in this position ) , means `` the one who brings you up / teaches you manners '' . 
  first four grades in elementary school you use * u\u010ditelj / u\u010diteljica * , meaning `` teacher '' . 
  other four grades it 's * nastavnik/nastavnica * , lit . 
  `` the one who holds the classes '' in highschool and university you use * profesor/profesorka * . 
  in university there other titles as well , assistant , docent , doctor ... 
  in serbo-croatian there 's a t-v distinction , meaning you use the plural second person pronoun , * vi * , when you intend to be polite . 
  it 's used for all of the above , always . 
  cool . 
  get someone who speaks to language to talk to . 
  i actually got a few calls this week . 
  it 's not a big thing , happens a few times a year . 
  not `` quartz-parchment-shears '' ? 
  now i 'm disappointed . 
  `` paper-rock-scissors '' , you sway your arm with the open palm while chanting those 3 words . 
  nope , either he did n't explain it properly or i was wrong , ca n't be both . 
  if he wanted to know which accent , then i would be in the wrong , but he botched it with the description so i 'm not . 
  yes , that means my answer was good . 
  op said americans like english accents , so same thing . 
  and we do n't know anyone who would have an atractive accent . 
  croatian , i 'm talking about girls . 
  only ones i know are [ mali london ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mali_london ) and [ \u0160angaj ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%a0angaj ) , but those are n't proper towns . 
  i 'm doing fine after meeting you . 
  wan na go on a date ? 
  spoken , ca n't distinguish it from russian . 
  sounds soft ( kinda cute ) , somehow overemphasized pronunciation . 
  i read that the hundred years ' war origin was false . 
  what 's the wanker sign ? 
  thanks and is there a name for it ? 
  or 5 in rome . 
  is that backwards peace sign really a serious insult in britain ? 
  is it only england or ... ? 
  hahah , it might look complicated , but it 's not that hard to pronounce . 
  by the way if you missed the joke , hrvoje is to croats what francois is to the french . 
  in vojvodina , the northern part of serbia , some traditional male names end with '' - ica '' ( - itsa ) , which is a generally a diminutive suffix . 
  so you have jovica , \u0110urica , ivica , novica , nikica ... derived from jovan , \u0110ura , iva ( n ) , novak , nikola ... ca n't be bothered to look through all the other names , because ex-yugo countries share many of those . 
  english speakers find the name dragan interesting because it sounds like `` dragon '' , while it actually means `` dear '' . 
  srboljub, 
  yes , this is exactly true . 
  that 's not what was he said .
