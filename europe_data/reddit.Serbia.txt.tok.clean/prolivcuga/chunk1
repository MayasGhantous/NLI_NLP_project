if you gaze long into an abyss , the abyss will gaze back into you . 
   serbians who still believe this are stuck a century in the past . 
  russia stopped giving a fuck about serbia a long time ago . 
  they still have the veto power and they buy our shit so we wo n't do anything to them without the compensation . 
  i do n't really know, 
  yes , russians are coming , the evil mongols from the east are invading , they are climbing our windows , they try to rape us so hide yo kids , hide yo wife ... 
  4 enemies of the serbian people and their wrongdoings . 
  written by the the government of national salvation ( nazis ) in ww2, 
  that is fdr but it was meant as england is not the friend of the small people , [ this poster ] ( http://www1.picturepush.com/photo/a/8811744/img/anonymous/48.jpg ) is drawn better, 
  that 's uk , not usa, 
  we do n't have russians , a little bit of western ukrainians but not much russians . 
  [ these guys ] ( http://www4.picturepush.com/photo/a/8811712/img/anonymous/13.jpg ), 
  compared to our main ally , russians were golden . 
  it 's not funny translated : how do people sell land in srebrenica ? 
  with or without bones ( usually when you buy meat on the balkans they ask you if you want with bones or without ) what are serbian children doing in sisak ? 
  sleeping like they are butchered ( kao zaklani - `` like butchered '' is usually used to say how deep some children sleep and that you need a lot of time to wake them up ), 
  i like domaci the most sta pita prodavac zemljista kupca u srebrenici ? 
  their tight uniforms got my dick really hard . 
  i feel like raping them . 
   maybe you just need a critical mass of tourists ? 
  god no , we 'd start shooting them . 
  tourists are annoying . 
  when it comes to rubbish , belgrade is definitely the worst in serbia , not sure how the other stuff compares . 
   so the government army fires back . 
  ... towards cities populated by civilian population . 
  if you think i am joking just check it on google street view . 
  that movie is far from reality , we do n't fuck our sons . 
  we do fuck our daughters from time to time . 
  movie is brainfuck ... like for real, 
  rubbish , rude people , general dislike for the tourists , big chance to get robbed , should i continue ... 
  i 'd answer but there is no point in arguing with balkan diaspora , all of them/you still think it 's war here . 
   republika srpska is not a country [ neither is bosnia ] ( http://www.oslobodjenje.ba/portal/images/articles/dodik-najveci-saljivdzija.jpg ), 
  ** do n't ** come to serbia ** do ** nothing, 
  well they sure did n't show of in srebrenica edit : also we are taller, 
  but they are not bombing troops in the west . 
  yes and ukrainians blocked all of our refrigerated trucks going to russia, 
  you can keep them !, 
  no , it 's not the same as in israel , rebels in the eastern ukraine do n't fire their missiles at the western ukraine so it does n't need such hard answer . 
  shelling cities looks like as if ukraine government is equalizing protesters and rebels . 
  and it just leads to bigger hate , it wo n't bring anything good . 
  yes and haradinaj 's case was the most funniest with i think 12 people commiting suicide for half a month . 
  i imagine them being too lazy to go to japan to sign the declaration that the war is over . 
  just because russians acted like animals does n't excuse ukrainians acting like that even if the size of the destruction is smaller . 
  we have free-trade with russia too also we are not participating in the sanctions against russia . 
  that probably means that our export towards russia will grow ( could happen to slow down a little because we had bad floods and it destroyed our infrastrucure and big part of agricultural sector ) . 
  russia is already our 3rd biggest export partner and 3rd biggest import partner . 
  hahaha , chance for our paori to get richer . 
  except some military power , the political thing they want wo n't live very long because not even russia can accept that because of the west . 
  i do n't really know what weapon killed them . 
   yes , it 's not good for artillery to be used in places where civilians might be , but the rebels should n't try to fight a high-intensity war from places civilians might be . 
  and this is the reason what westerners fail to realize , you do n't target heavily populated areas . 
  it looks like as if ukraine army cares more about land than it 's population , just to fight some rebels which seriously do n't have any power to pull any shit , they just use military force to provoke ukraine army . 
  ah , sorry , just saw now what i wrote . 
  heavy arillery shells are also not precise if implemented in the populated area . 
  there is no excuse for it using it in such circumstances let alone rocket artillery . 
  [ a few days ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/morbidreality/comments/2c39tv/gorlovka_mother_child_victims_ukraine_artillery/ ), 
  this is about us not alienating from the eu but it wo n't made me think different . 
  muresan ( 231cm ) has 43 years , serb player vranes ( 230cm ) has 31 years and he is healty , yao ming ( 229cm ) has 33 years . 
  edit : numbers, 
  [ one more popular picture from the border ] ( http://oi51.tinypic.com/5yi5mu.jpg ), 
  i know about [ gorlovka ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncdwju9id6c ) a few days ago but not about this , are there any videos ? 
  is he going to be taller than legendary george muresan ? 
  that kid would probably go into guinness wrb as the tallest basketball player , maybe even as human . 
  holy fuck , the tallest guy from my class in elementary school was exactly 2m , this one is damn tall . 
  nothing will happen . 
  that 's just song for serbs not to alienate themselves from the eu but in the end they will do nothing . 
  that 's austrian thing not eastern slavic , serbian also had `` morphing '' alphabet like rus , ukr and bul ... but vuk later reformed that thing . 
  smaras !, 
  how come they integrate well in the balkans ? 
  they are on the brink of the civil war since the 92 , nothing new here . 
  it does n't say explicitly that they wanted to ethnically cleanse bosnia and croatia but it 's full of implications . 
  france , russia and italy did n't believe that serbia could make yugoslavia yet they believed that croats and bosniaks should be serbs ( they probably planed to do it through oppresion and cleansing ) . 
  sazanov spoke about `` reminding '' croats and bosniaks of serbian blood and subjecting them to our rule . 
  our militarry leaders ( and generally local population ) were for the options of greater serbia instead of yugoslavia but not that big serbia because they thought of parts with croatian majority as not worth the fight . 
  some of the borderous seceeded parts do have hungarian majority and i agree about those parts but not the others because hungarians are clearly a minority there . 
  the treaty of london in the 1915, 
  the only other plan back then was ethnic cleansing of the muslims and croats as proposed by the italia , france and russia . 
  they thought of yugoslavia as an impossible project which was doomed to end with a war . 
  edit : this thing did n't happen by a number of coincidences, 
  their leadership was against the war with serbia in ww2 too and then germany said that they either invade yugoslavia or they would be marked as enemy too . 
  that 's not a documentary , that 's a movie but a pretty good movie . 
  i liked the part about the eyesocket joke the most , it made me burst into a laughter . 
  no i do n't, 
  i like germany ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ^ to ^ be ^ nuked !, 
  english speakers also use the term faggot to insult someone , it 's not that uncommon in the west either . 
  actually all the `` volunteers '' back then which i know told me that they felt the same way driving through there , going through the meadows sensing the aroma of squashed apricots and plums and then driving through the sparsely populated bosnian mountains full of evergreen trees , a place full of life . 
  try `` danish '' instead of `` denmark '', 
  why does the girl from the denmark look like gvineth paltrow ? 
  edit : oh shit , that 's because it is her, 
  i know which country we are going to invade next , belarus , and steal all of their babes . 
  or the one from lichtenstein , slovenia , san marino , vatikan , etc. 
  what about jews who support palestine ? 
  are they allowed to enter ? 
   particularly those who buy into the idea of pan-arabism we actually do have them , not really a big number . 
  but they have extremely negative stance towards `` slav version of islam '' ( even through they are slavs ) and we actually had to intervene once when muftija called but not much except that and nothing really happened , anti-western stance , and they did participate in the terrorist acts around europe . 
  they do n't really care about srebrenica , neither the extremist identify themselves as bosniaks . 
  the thing that is mystery to me is that we had a lot of serbian muslim extremists doing shit in usa , germany , switzerland , etc. 
  but not single one of them did anything in serbia . 
  but no matter what we are still have more muslims , and also our country does n't have borders as secured as norway . 
  edit : i mean schengen borders .
