`` pretending '' , not `` mafia '' . 
  indeed . 
  the hungarian '' \u00e1 '' is also not the same as `` a '' ( it 's not an accented a ) . 
  it 's a different sound . 
  the second is pretty much like a mix of ( `` international '' ) a and o sounds , and \u00e1 is the `` regular '' a sound . 
  it also brought a lot of positivity . 
  you ca n't just ignore that . 
  just because somebody is a refugee ( fled a warzone ) does n't mean they do n't have some cash with them or that they did n't have a life , a job , savings etc before the war . 
  at the same time , i do n't deny that some of them are n't refugees and are just economic migrants tho . 
  i 'm sure some are . 
  uhhh , i really do n't know what russia has to do with any of this ( also , we 're acting according to eu 's i.e. 
  germany 's wishes here , and letting them through , unlike hungary for example ) . 
  what a useless comment . 
  i do n't doubt it , i just could n't remember the name . 
  hagia sophia is a museum now , not a mosque ( it was originally a byzantine church , then an ottoman mosque , and now a turkish museum ) . 
  although there 's an equally sized mosque built right across hagia sophia in a mostly similar style , not sure how it 's called ( edit : it 's called the blue mosque ) . 
  maybe that one is the biggest , maybe the russian one , dunno . 
  edit : well , according to [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_largest_mosques ) , this turkish mosque is definitely a strong contender , the list does n't put mosques in any specific order . 
  yeah , i figured it 's probably that . 
   i understand what you mean , despite the comments being hidden , i also pretty much always read them ( you just click on the + next to it ) , because those are usually the juiciest/most controversial comments . 
  sometimes it 's just spam , stupid stuff etc tho . 
  maybe i should deactivate the feature , huh . 
  it would save me some clicking . 
  lol , talk about being a paranoid conspiracy person . 
  :p his comment was hidden when i commented , so it must have had at least -5 do you even reddit :p ? 
  edit : maybe you have that feature turned off in the reddit preferences ? 
  man , you got downvoted . 
  i remember when this sub 's slogan was basically `` let 's federalize '' . 
  we do indeed . 
  in fact most of our newspapers ( to give an example ) are in latin . 
  [ alexa - top domestic sites/newspapers ] ( http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/rs ) are in latin . 
  this is true for tv too ( prvatv , b92 , pink and so on ) . 
  our state television is in cyrillic tho . 
  but since the 2006 constitution ( the one that made kosovo an integral part of serbia , legally speaking , enshrined in the constitution ) all government paperwork has to be written in cyrillic ( this is n't always respected nor is it enforced ) . 
  this has been done mostly because , y' know 90s an so on , to distinguish ourselves from the croats ( just balkan stuff ) and in order to preserve cyrillic considering its usage is in decline ( somewhat ) . 
  we still learn both in school from grade one , and are perfectly capable and allowed to use both whenever we want ( even when filling in paperwork ) . 
  switching between the two is like switching between fonts . 
  generally speaking , let 's say they 're both in equal use , but i actually think latin is used more often ( particularly on the internet , it 's easier to just use latin then constantly switch between the two when you use english as much as serbian on the net ) . 
  just check a couple pages of / r/serbia . 
  personally , i like we learn and use both , it 's very useful to be honest , and i definitely do n't want to change the fact we learn/use/know cyrillic , but i 'd prefer if that silly clause of the constitution was amended . 
  let people write the way they want .

  you 're looking for / r/sakartvelo ( < -- that 's the georgian subreddit , it 's the name of the country in the georgian language ) also there 's / r/tbilisi ( capital ), 
  that 's the joke.jpg did you even read the title of the post ? 
  it 's true but not because older ships were prettier , it 's just that there 's less adventure in modern ships . 
  when you paint a sailboat ( whether you live now or lived back in the day ) it meant rough seas , travel to unimaginable lands far away , being at the mercy of the sea , wind and all alone in the middle of the ocean . 
  and modern ships just do n't grab the imagination in that same way ( sturdy , safe , clinical , gps , you 've seen the world already via the internet , can travel in less than a day to the other side of the earth etc ) . 
  modern ships are very interesting from an engineering perspective , but are n't a good subject for artsy emotional paintings . 
  walking speed basically . 
  yup . 
  these is even higher than spy planes . 
  so , well above everyone else ( for anyone who might be reading this and also might not be in the know , most airliners fly at around 10 \u00b1 2 km or so ) . 
  the view from this plane would be pretty nice . 
  at what altitude would it fly ? 
  til usa is not an independent country . 
  ( mexican migrants ? 
  check . 
  check . ), 
  exactly !, 
  and what 's your source for the opposite claim ? 
  feels . 
  at least i have common sense on my side . 
  i could also dig for some interview but i 'm too lazy . . 
  i do n't know how you imagine people in the middle east live , but they 're still human . 
  sure , they ( some ) do n't respect gender equality etc. . . but of course they care about their families . 
  do you even understand how human psychology works ? 
  why would n't they want their families to come over ? 
  jeezus . 
  well , it makes sense . 
  if the women/kids do n't have to go , they wo n't . 
  males once here obviously want their wives/kids/parents with them so if they can bring them then , they will . 
  what 's the other option ? 
  they wo n't bring their families once here ? 
  why would n't they ? 
  i do n't understand what do you think is the other option . 
  as for why they want asylum , some are refugees from war-torn areas , some economic migrants from pakistan/bangladesh . 
  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:32003l0086 http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/handbook-law-asylum-migration-borders-2nded_en.pdf ^ search in second link : family reunification . 
  buses everywhere . 
   but fact is : no . 
  they go to europe so they could later have their families sent over ( eu allows that , reuniting families like that , they all get asylum then ) . 
  the trip is too dangerous/stressful for the kids , so women and kids ( most at least ) stay back while the healthiest strongest male goes to seek asylum . 
  that 's the cause of the male/female disparity between refugees that stay in turkey and the ones that come here . 
  this is a fact . 
  for you guys it 's a bigger achievement and takes a special kind of talent not understanding your neighbors than understanding them . 
  :p and adding to the language thing , i 've lived in four countries and i did n't even have to move . 
  yeah , but for you guys they 're really not a problem . 
  us does n't exactly give handouts/benefits and it 's not like they have any extreme beliefs or anything . 
  free growth . 
  only downside you 're gon na have to learn spanish ( and learning another language could only be useful for americans , considering many of you anglophones are monolingual ) . 
  but you know what 's best for yourselves , what do i know from over here , just saying . 
  / r/middleeasternhotties for those who feel in a mood for bettering their understanding of our current migrant problem . 
  making porn , not consuming . 
  ah , ok . you 're right then , indeed . 
  thanks for responding . 
  hi , / u/dclauzel , i appreciate your hard work and all , but . 
  you sure it 's a doublon ? 
  i checked , like , the last 7 pages of / new and found nothing , plus there 's nothing here either : [ other discussions ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/duplicates/3lfzza/a_migrant_father_who_was_tripped_by_a_hungarian/ ) can you link me the double ? 
  thanks . 
  this happened at a checkpoint . 
  i never said you should adjust to their ( immigrants ' ) culture , but you should try to understand it and why it 's the way it is .
