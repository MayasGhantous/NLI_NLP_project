  you have a duty ( towards yourself ) to understand it because it will help you ( by making it easier to integrate them/help them integrate ) . 
   why should we even attempt to understand it ? 
  that 's a bad attitude to have in life . 
  while it might be a criminal offense it does n't warrant the use of excessive force ( breaking equipment and beating up ) . 
  that 's also a part of hungarian law ( and serbian law ) . 
  also , we do n't know who crossed the border ( literally by a couple meters ... one of the journalists was pushed onto the side of the fence , it happened near the fence ) , the police or the journalists . 
  also , i 'm sure there 's some minor leeway at the crossing in regards to this . 
  it 's not like it 's the iron curtain , serbia and hungary have friendly relations ( maybe they got some temporary permit ) . 
  i understand it was almost a war-zone over there at the moment , hyperbolically speaking , and things can get heated up , and even innocent people can get hurt in the heat of the moment and all that , but police should get ( and they do get ) training to differentiate between nonthreatening bystanders and `` suspects '' . 
  either the journalists got in the way and it was an accident or some of the police went on a beating rampage , or both actually . 
  either way the journalists should get an official apology ( the camera was definitely not a threat ) . 
  all in all an unfortunate incident . 
   yep , might be . 
  still , she claims they were carrying their equipment . 
  heh , i never said the police was being rational by any meaning of the word . 
  disgusting behaviour by the police either way , whatever their `` motivation '' might have been . 
  maybe just some thugs looking for some excuse to beat up people . 
   the only new information is that she claims there were other journalists at the place where the crew was attacked , but only they were attacked . 
  she 's kinda darker skinned/tan ( photo [ 1 ] ( http://www.prva.rs/upload/boximagedata/2012/11/09/13580/img-20121109-00192.jpg ) and [ 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kffld9w.jpg ) ) , maybe it was some classic racial profiling by the police . 
  this has nothing to do with `` race '' . 
  do n't do that . 
  pls . 
  those are n't government buses , they 're private buses , private companies ' . 
  once the migrants enter the country they get a permit for freedom of movement within the country ( for three days ) , so they could go to an asylum center , but instead they go to the next border . 
  people with buses have figured this out so they just offer bus rides directly to the next border . 
  it just `` happens to be '' that all the passengers are migrants . 
  yup . 
  the north/south position is alright , but in a east/west sense it should be in the middle not in the corner . 
  in fact it should be in the center of that bump in the middle of the border . 
  well , the thing is , they ca n't deport people across the sea to libya . 
  it 's easier for hungary to send people back to serbia/romania . 
  well , `` vlad '' does have slavic etymology tho . 
  just saying . 
  :p also , `` during his life , vlad wrote his name in latin documents as wladislaus dragwlya , vaivoda partium transalpinarum '' . 
  maybe you are n't , but i assumed you 're nationalist because you immediately assumed/jumped to yell it was fake because you did n't like it , and because you think we forbid the building of mosques . 
   delusional like your flair nothing delusional about my flair . 
  and at least now i know you are indeed a nationalist . 
  but , yes , blic is n't the best of sources . 
  lol , you 're ridiculous . 
  this was posted in / r/serbia awhile ago ( this link in [ fact ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/serbia/comments/3k0gdq/zukorli%c4%87_gradi_najve%c4%87u_d%c5%beamiju_u_evropi/ ) ) . 
  just google `` zukorlic dzamija najveca/u '' you 'll get pleeenty of results . 
  you 're just a butthurt nationalist . 
  [ not really . 
  ] ( http://www.blic.rs/vesti/drustvo/588686/zukorlic-gradi-najvecu-dzamiju-u-evropi ) for those who do n't read serbian : we 'll have the tallest mosque in europe ( 100m ) in a couple of years . 
  we do have a native muslim population y' know . 
  i think it 's mostly just semantics . 
  once you have that many people in one place you have to have some way of giving them aid/food/water . 
  my objection was to the idea they were built for the sole purpose of encouraging the migrants/refugees to cross the hungarian border . 
  i do n't think they need encouragement from the serbian authorities for that . 
  you are using hyperbole ( just in case somebody ends up thinking we 're really building refreshment camps ... we do have refugee centers tho ) but you are indeed right , i slightly edited my comment to rephrase some things slightly . 
  we wo n't do that , the dude 's just rambling . 
  my assumption is we 'll `` unofficially '' just direct the migrants to croatia/romania ( or they 'll do that themselves anyway , to be more precise ) . 
  now , if croatia/romania close their borders too and we end up stuck with them all , i.e. 
  really too much to handle , i think we might end up building our own fence down below ( macedonia/greece ) . 
  so far we 've indeed been welcoming . 
  but then again if the migrants ca n't pass into the eu they wo n't even come here to serbia so i doubt we 'll be needing to build a fence ( the few that come wo n't be a problem ) . 
  the ones here that ca n't go further will just willingly leave back for greece . 
  as for the current batch of migrants , doubt we have the man power or desire to ship them to macedonia . 
  this is all of course if they do n't ask for asylum in serbia , which most of them wo n't . 
  if you 're a refugee , does n't mean you do n't have a phone or some cash ... how do you think they managed to travel this far ? 
  i like your mix of cyrillic , latin , english and russian . 
  well , greeks could say the same thing ( even more so , we all know what 's the situation like in greece nowadays ) . 
  that 's why i think redistributing within the eu is the best solution . 
  although it does n't exactly seem to be popular among the v4 citizens . 
  : shrug :, 
  as / u/burex said , the migrants have freedom of movement within the country . 
  to be a trafficker i think you have to transport them across the border . 
  and what exactly is the government supposed to do ? 
  let them pass , turn a blind eye , or ship them back to macedonia ( if they do n't ask for asylum after they 've been approached ) . 
  and anyway , that 's what everyone 's been doing so far , let them pass to the next country ( to be more precise , hungary and macedonia put them on trains and shipped them to austria/serbia ) . 
  i do n't see a reason to single serbia out . 
  i guess what you want is for serbia to close of its border with macedonia and put the currently present migrants in closed camps . 
  as we know , that so far has n't worked for hungary ( for example ) . 
  generally speaking , the migrants should either end up in the first safe country ( greece ) or be redistributed within the eu , or all end up in germany/sweden ( the richest countries ) . 
  not sure why serbia should take the brunt of the migrants . 
  those are not the authorities . 
  those are private buses ( private companies ) . 
  even your link says so . 
  this was linked upthread ( for what it 's worth ) : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kt6yg/two_topless_feminists_storm_muslim_conference/cv0fz4v, 
  this has to be a parody tho , right ? 
  you eat rotten sharks ? 
  [ for the uninitiated ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h%c3%a1karl ), 
  they 're listed in alphabetical order . 
  yes . 
  on that note , [ ostrog monastery in montenegro ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostrog_monastery ) . 
  he 's just joking/trolling i think/hope . 
  novi sad . 
  you ? 
  btw , i do n't doubt for a second there 's lots of pro-russia people around me in the street , i was mostly talking about the people i socialize with and talk about politics with . 
  also , i was n't trying to be factual , i was trying to make a point . 
  logical fallacies and all that . 
  well that 's certainly possible , i do n't deny that . 
  nikolic is irrelevant . 
  he has no power . 
  the presidential position is mostly a ceremonial one . 
  he himself is indeed mostly russophillic , bit his current main political purpose is to give meaningless lip service to the right wingers in serbia 's populace ( in order to keep them calm ) , while the country in practice moves towards the eu . 
  he 's best buds with our pm , a relatively recent ( a couple years now tho ) mega pro eu convert . 
  serbia 's current political establishment is silly . 
  but , yes , the country is kinda split , but still mostly pro-eu , with an inclination of increase in this attitude . 
  that 's totally scientific evidence , mate .
