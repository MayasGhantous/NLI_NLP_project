  i personally know no serbs who are pro russia . 
  it 's all about the people you hang out with , where you live , etc. 
  see how that works ? 
  polls say what the polls say , end of discussion . 
  half of serbs . 
  the country is very split on this issue . 
  there is n't a lot of anti-refugee sentiment here tho , not even the right wingers . 
  i mean , in the sense , of being directed towards the refugees themselves . 
  right wingers tho complain about the refugees in a wider european sense ( they 've found a way to blame it on the eu ) . 
  they complain about having to take care of the refugees , but they do n't complain to the refugees , but to the eu . 
  at least , that 's what i 've figured from what little of our media i 've been following lately . 
  ok , so if i got you right , if i as a european ( cet ) wanted to post something on a random sub ( us dominated i guess ) in the `` ideal time '' slot i should actually post it in the evening ? 
  early afternoon +7 ish hours . 
  sorry to bother you , i just find this interesting . 
  what timezones ( early afternoon ) ? 
  american or european ? 
  considering you said on reddit not on / r/europe specifically . 
  where have you been living for the last couple decades ? 
  sanctions are a perfectly standard legal mechanism within the eu when a country does n't follow through with the agreed laws/treaties . 
  they have been applied numerous times over the years , even for way trivial matters . 
  this is n't something new . 
  the lack of knowledge on the inner workings of the eu , and the additional obliviousness about that lack of knowledge , on this sub lately astounds me . 
  well , to be fair , all ethnicities are a social construct , by definition . 
   an ethnic group or ethnicity is a socially defined category of people who ... blah blah ... 
  it should say or . 
  you either were n't paying attention or you have some mild case of colorblindness . 
  they 're nowhere near each other . 
   `` shit skins '' go back to stormfront . 
  although this is n't true for milan specifically . 
  it 's well known as the least touristy of all major italian cities . 
  it 's the industrial/economic hub with not too much to see ( for italian standards ) . 
  or so i 've heard from italians . 
  true about the czechs * , but that seems more like `` 2nd or possibly 1st best '' to me , not `` 2nd or possibly 3rd best '' , especially when the gap between 1st and second is a lot smaller ( basically tiny ) compared to the gap between 2nd and 3rd , but ok . ** although this stuff usually varies a little between different sources ( according to [ one of three ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita ) sources slovenia is still better ) . 
  that 's why they 're waving afghanistan flags . 
   it 's not famous enough , clearly . 
  apparently so . 
  or i 'm just out of the loop . 
  not sure if you 're trying to make a joke or an american ( or both ) . 
  those are two different cities , capitals of romania and hungary . 
  and snow in the west is somehow magically different ? 
  people would n't complain about your comment if you complained about something legitimate in it . 
  i mean , you 'd still be an unnecessary downer that does n't offer any solutions but at least you 'd have a legitimate claim and would just be venting ( in the wrong thread tho ) . 
  well , sort of ( not really ) . 
  the suffix '' - ska/sko '' is a typical country suffix but it 's more like '' - ian '' than '' - land '' . 
  ma\u0111arska , if we 're being literal , means hungarian , or more like hungarian ( land/country ) , the `` land/country '' part being implied . 
  it 's like if sweden were called swedish . 
  but you 're right , it 's not really `` land '' like '' - stan '' . 
  `` ma\u0111ar '' is pronounced the same way as `` magyar '' btw . 
  ( the `` a '' - s are slightly different , but that 's because the hungarian `` a '' is slightly different to the `` international '' / usual `` a '' ), 
  is it that hard to [ google ] ( https://www.google.rs/search?q=scientists+religion&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-us:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=sb&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=fcyzvrffg4uesahdjleaaq ) this ? 
  the numbers definitely qualify as `` many '' .

  hey , what happened to this ? 
  you guys forgot about this or what ? 
  the church of cheesus crust . 
  yup , i did some googling after posting that . 
  i knew you guys are oriental orthodox and one of the oldest christians , first country to officially adopt christianity and all that , but did n't know it was the sixth tho ( and you do n't use the julian calendar for this and for most things or at all , you have your own calendar , similar but different ) . 
  still in the same general time of year in the end tho , just a day difference , not much ( compared to 25th gregorian ) . 
  i also forgot to mention montenegrins in my first comment , but yeah , did n't feel like editing . 
  also ukrainians , macedonians , georgians , armenians and copts . 
  [ source ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rgrpddp.jpg ) also , merry christmas to those who celebrate . 
  in most european languages `` j '' is pronounced like `` y '' in `` yes '' , not like `` j '' in `` just '' . 
  slavic languages fall under this group , among other languages , such as danish or swedish or german . 
  in fact , english is the oddball ( other oddballs are spanish [ h ] and french [ zh ] ) . 
  `` y '' pronunciation of `` j '' is in fact so common that the ipa ( international phonetic alphabet ) / j / symbol is used for the `` y '' sound or in other words [ / j / ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/palatal_approximant ) is read as `` y '' . 
  so , the various slavic words are pronounced like `` voyna '' not `` vogna '' . 
  montenegro has 2 chapters closed ( out of 35 ) , serbia 0 ( out of 35 ) . 
  serbia has a significantly better `` current situation '' column ( and a better `` assessment at start '' too ) . 
  if things go smoothly ( ? ), 
  i see serbia and montenegro ready to join at the same time ( kosovo might be a problem/short delay tho for serbia ) . 
   it still seems rather silly to me , since whatever you call it , i still see a letter with some extra bits floating nearby and/or attached to it . 
  you could apply the same logic to e and f or p and r or o and q. 
  [ edgar allan poe ] ( https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/edgar_allan_poe ) [ poe 's law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poe%27s_law ) [ this guy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ye3md/bosnia_to_apply_for_eu_membership_in_january/cycoxjk ), 
  i 'm aware they were in a civil war , did n't know their gdp plummeted that much during it tho . 
  til yugoslavia was richer ( ppp ) than spain in 1938 . 
  it 's not that i do n't believe you , i do , i do n't think you 're lying , but that 's anecdotal . 
  the people you hang out with do n't reflect the country 's view . 
  all the [ polls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_serbia_to_the_european_union#public_opinion ) show support . 
  and that 's been my experience with comment sections on various big sites too . 
  maybe reluctant support by some , but still support in the end . 
  also , my friend circle is pro-eu , but as i said that 's irrelevant . 
  disclaimer : i ca n't read the article ( wo n't load for some reason ) so i took all the context from the thread . 
  what i do n't understand is , if he really did rape her why did he go with such a farfetched ridiculous story instead of just saying `` yeah we had sex , she consented '' . 
  and then it really is `` he said , she said '' . 
  what possible reason could he have to come up with such an outlandish story for his defense ? 
  only three options that make some sense are : they had consensual sex and he 's dumb so he made it up on the spot , in his first statement to the police , without consulting his lawyer , so they had to go with it . 
  or his story really did happen . 
  or he raped her and then lied this stupid lie to his lawyer/police . 
  i do n't understand why would any lawyer go with this story otherwise . 
  unless of course he 's reaaally that dumb and even though they had consensual sex he decided to tell this story even to his lawyer and stick with it . 
  to sum up , it 's either : a. 
  they had consensual sex , and he 's really dumb b. 
  he raped her , and is really dumb ( and a horrible person ) c. his story happened . 
  that 's what i took from this . 
  he 's either dumb ( guilty or not ) or unlucky . 
  can anybody be that dumb ? 
  maybe he has a phd , so that 's why they let him go lol . 
  he mentioned macedonia because of the albanians that [ live there ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/makedonija_-_etnicki_sastav_po_naseljima_2002.gif ) .
