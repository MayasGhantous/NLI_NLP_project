  btw , the capital skopje is surrounded by albanian populated territory . 
  redrawing borders might cause instability there . 
  i 'm not saying it would , but it might . 
   srs never been to power . 
  um , yes they have . 
  do n't you remember when vucic was the infamous minister of information ( media ) ? 
  during his reign vu\u010di\u0107 introduced fines for journalists who criticized the government and banned foreign tv networks . 
  also a prominent journalist was murdered . 
  vucic was such a swell lad back then . 
  he 's changed his tune since then ... but you know the saying : a fox may change its skin , but never its character . 
  i mostly wrote that because i see a lot of people complain when , for example , associated press is written as aso\u0161iejted pres , or stuff like that . 
  there are perceived drawbacks to complete insistence on phonetic transcribing in all instances . 
  i do n't necessarily share the sentiment , but felt like i should acknowledge it even tho i love our phonemic orthography . 
  i understand that , but according to our spelling rules ( maybe dumb ) even though we have all the letters in george ( g , e , o , r ) we 'd still write it as d\u017eord\u017e ( the phonetic version in serbian ) , those are the rules of the official standard of the language ( as i said , maybe dumb , but those are the rules ) . 
  as for official documents , i did some googling and the rules do n't apply at least not anymore for minorities ( although i did n't find anything for the state level yet ) , and that 's good imo , i understand your concerns . 
  anyway , more importantly , speaking about the case of berat xhimshiti we do n't actually , technically , have [ x in the script ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaj%27s_latin_alphabet#letters ) . 
  nor q. :p, 
  it 's not an evil plan to hide anyone 's identity ( their names are still recognizable as albanian names ) it 's just how our spelling rules works . 
  go to any serbian newspapers website and george bush will be d\u017eord\u017e bu\u0161 . 
  look , same with the brits : [ `` vidi\u0107 's manchester jersey '' ] ( https://www.gogoalshop.com/html/upload/item_img/201108/1/0131412597135cd22ce1112manchesterunitedhomejersey15.jpg ) says vidic not vidi\u0107 . 
  it 's not an evil plot to oppress anyone . 
  sure , maybe the spelling rules for official documents for recognized minorities should be changed ( and they are changed in vojvodina , maybe in the rest of serbia too dunno ) , but you 're mistaken about their motivation . 
  if you were a woman would you enter that mob kerfuffle ?

  edit : i should 've reloaded , treehaggis already answered . 
  those are all good points . 
  although . 
  does fusion research really eat up that much money ? 
  i must admit i 'm not familiar with the numbers . 
  would those numbers really be noticeable in regards to the money being spent ( or that should be spent ) on switching to already existing eco-friendly renewables ? 
  every euro counts , considering we 're already behind the schedule on fighting global warming , but would n't this be closer to a rounding error ? 
  are you for cutting funding to other currently unnecessary research ( cern or space exploration for example ) ? 
  and directing all funding to switching to existing green techs ? 
  what makes fusion research stand out ( as i said , i 'm not familiar with the number of zeros , is it that ) ? 
  edit : or maybe you 're not for cutting funding , but against increasing funding to fusion research . 
  i 'd google the numbers myself but i 'm on my phone , sorry . 
  greens love fusion ( as opposed to fission ) reactors , or at least they should . 
  they 're completely non-polluting/safe ( compared to other energy sources we use ... 
  i mean , making the thing required energy and whatnot ) . 
  yeah , i 'm not convinced . 
  i imagined something more like '' ` allo ` allo !, 
  a lot of what you said here is n't really correct ( or at least ... you have the wrong approach ) . 
  hungarians were n't cleansed from vojvodina ( germans were tho , sadly , after ww2 . 
  it was a [ pan-european phenomenon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flight_and_expulsion_of_germans_%281944%e2%80%9350%29 ) ) . 
  here 's a [ gif ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yntjiur.gif ) ( red - german , yellow - hu ) . 
  there * were * incidents during the world wars , but they were mutual . 
  as you can tell there 's a very slight change in hungarians , and it mostly happened because a lot of serbs came from bosnia after ww2 and later after and during the 90s ( plus what i call `` social entropy '' ... if a minority is treated well it assimilates ... mixed marriages lead to kids who lean towards the larger group ) . 
  hungarians did n't really leave from 1945 to 2005 . 
  yugoslavia was better than the soviet influenced hungary . 
  a lot of hungarians are leaving now because of the bad economic situation in serbia , and they can easily become eu citizens ( they can get hu passports ) . 
  also , not all serbs subscribe to the polandball-esque stereotypical `` nationalistic serbian thought '' and `` greater serbia '' . 
  there are n't that many nationalistic ethnic serbs in vojvodina . 
  and of course not all serbs in central serbia subscribe to that ideology either . 
  it 's a very very tiny number who want to actually secede , most just want greater autonomy ( from belgrade ) . 
  the reasons for both are mostly economic ( there are some cultural difference maybe ... for example the big left wing party is in power in vojvodina now , and the big right wing party in serbia as a whole ) . 
  considering the balkans are balkanized enough already , the only reason i can come up with why vojvodina would actually secede is if , once serbia is ready to join the eu , there 's a `` kosovo or eu '' referendum in serbia and serbia as a whole chooses kosovo and vojvodina chooses eu . 
  other than that nobody wants to secede really . 
  it would probably only bring more problems . 
  and you know , solidarity and all , if we do n't help the south who will . 
  hopefully serbia as a whole will join the eu and we can focus on real work/problems . 
  edit : as for why there are differences between the north and the south , austria-hungary was nicer than the ottomans , plus the typical north/south due to climate like in any country ( italy , germany , us , spain etc ) , north is flat/south mountainous , north more diverse etc. . . 
  a sitcom in ancient rome ( or greece ) . 
  those were the croats tho , for the record . 
  now we only need bosniaks to destroy a unesco heritage site and we 're good to go !, 
  ah , the 90s in the balkans ... tons of fun . 
  dang , that 's a nice video . 
  one impression for every kilometer , nice . 
  [ your linguists do n't agree . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikvht3lovl0 ) :p but i know what you mean . 
  in some croatian dialects ( maybe even most , but definitely not all ) you do n't really make a difference between the two . 
  you can hear the difference in this video . 
  listen to the entire first minute ( or the whole thing , it 's informative ) . 
  [ croatian letters : \u010c and \u0106 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikvht3lovl0 ), 
  this is nikoli\u0107 ( the president ) not vu\u010di\u0107 ( the prime minister ) tho . 
  but yeah . 
  they 're a duo anyway . 
   has as main trading partner russia ? 
  well , for one [ it 's not true ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cjtzi1b.jpg ) . 
  we trade with the eu far more than with russia . 
  just italy and germany combined are way more than twice as relevant as russia , not even counting other smaller eu states . 
  so , there 's that . 
  short scale btw ( just in case you 're not aware ) . 
  no offense man , but that 's the dumbest strawman i 've seen in years . 
  you 're equating refugees ( people in need ) to cigarettes . 
  there 's a rover planned too , neat . 
  ah , so it really is those dastardly romanians . 
  curse you romania !, 
  we shall get our revenge . 
  no more sarma sharing with you . 
  thanks for the answer . 
  i was n't sure if switzerland etc were excluded too . 
  so is it just the eu minus the uk ? 
  in that case the site being anglophone could explain the uk ( although i totally understand your desire for defaulting the uk too ) . 
  that would sort of make sense . 
  in that case maybe then romania really did lock its wifi ? 
  curse you romania !, 
  `` shakes fist '' but jokes aside , do you remember if bosnia or iceland etc are included too , in which case it really is a random collection ? 
  maybe it 's just the eea ( european economic area ) plus eu minus uk or something . 
  silly either way , random or not . 
  having said that , with your new information i understand keeping the default status with the current situation .
