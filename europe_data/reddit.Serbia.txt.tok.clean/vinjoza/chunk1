every day you learn something new . 
  i thought that was a german stereotype : /, 
  i think he 's trolling , i hope . . damir on the other hand is just plain retard . 
  yugoslavia minus slovenia , minus northwestern croatia and minus part of dalmatia which supposed to go to italy . 
  it 's actually not a good thing because we had a chance to make a bigger serbia . 
  if that happened then we probably would have avoided massacres during wwii and wars during the 90 's . 
  `` the kingdom of serbia lost more than 1,100,000 inhabitants during the war ( both army and civilian losses ) , which represented over 27 % of its overall population and 60 % of its male population '' [ serbian campaign of world war i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbian_campaign_of_world_war_i#casualties ), 
  try to find it at / r/mapporn, 
  i do n't know , i did n't make this map . 
  it does seem a bit inaccurate really , at least for yugoslavia an soviet union which both had more casualties . 
  [ thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/3ldbvx/world_war_2_deaths_by_percentage_of_population_oc/ ), 
  you 're absolutely right , i could n't agree more . 
  like you said , it 'll take time for them to be fully accepted , i just do n't understand why are they making it harder for themselves ... 
  [ how 're we gunna convince 'em ... ] ( http://imgur.com/hnerimm ), 
  sad day , sad month , sad year , sad millennium ... 
  it 's not that simple , at least not in serbia . 
  i think here it 's more a political question , hate caused more by their constant provoking of serbian church and serbian historical figures , then then their sexual preference . 
  then how is it the same ? 
  are there elections coming soon ? 
  i 'm afraid it 's still nobody , and that also applies to you . 
  bravo, 
  the answer is nobody . 
  nice to know, 
  where ? 
  i 'm just pointing out that you made a mistake so you could fix it . 
  there 's no need to whine about it . 
  haha who are you to tell is it gone or not ? 
  how is czech rep. bigger than serbia ? 
  are they bullying you ? 
  he 's just a classical / r/europe retard . 
  only mentioning serbia or russia is enough to trigger them , do n't even try to be rational with them . . 
  in serbia it 's [ normal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country#list_of_countries_by_number_of_guns_per_capita ) . 
  my father owns a gun legally , but there 's also many illegal firearm , especially in the countryside . 
  i 'm thinking between these two [ 1 ] ( http://imgur.com/fjnzza2 ) [ 2 ] ( http://imgur.com/ue7kljw ) but i like your 's also . 
  serbs sided with hitler , wtf ? 
  did russians also side with hitler , it was only `` land of free '' who was against nazis ? 
  i hate generalizing , but if this is what majority of american `` know '' then you 're really bunch of imbeciles . 
  not all serbs are being judged in the hague , but almost everyone who is being judged is a serb . 
  67 out of 89 people who are sentenced there are serbs , only two albanians . 
  serbs were sentenced for 1125 years in prison while all the others for 245 years . 
  only five people were sentenced for crimes against serbs . 
  and you say it 's not a political tribunal ? 
  wtf is your point ? 
  there is someone who is portrayed worse than us ? 
  that 's great . 
  thanks hollywood for making us look awesome compared to russians !, 
  we got that image far before niko belic and hollywood movies . 
  during the 90s exclusively serbs were portrayed as racist , xenophobic barbarians while the rest were good guys . 
  if still some morons want to believe in that stereotype i do n't mind . 
  why would you think that ? 
  oh yes . 
  totally unbiased report from andras riedlmayer and andrew herscher , main expert witnesses against serbs in hague . 
  very relevant !, 
  what the hell is seat of the prizren league . 
  a religious site ? 
  whatever it is , prizren league was a subversive and terrorist organization , which main goal was persecution of serbs . 
  i do n't think destruction of their seat is some cultural loss . 
  i want a list of mosques destroyed by serbs , not nato . 
  you know very well that majority of destruction was caused by bombing , do n't play dumb . 
  and what catholic churches did serbs destroy ? 
  serbs have been accused for many things , but this ... lol, 
  can you provide me some source my goat-loving friend ? 
  i do n't want to live in denial anymore !, 
  in what alternate reality did that destruction took place ? 
  see , if america tried to stop ethnic cleansing of serbs with same determination i would ' t hate them . 
  that 's the whole point . 
  this way they just showed how hypocritical they are . 
  now please continue with your life , you are annoying . 
  again , where was i complaining , where ? 
  i asked you few questions and of course you ignored because you know you 're wrong . 
  what the hell is wrong with your logic ? 
  i 'm done with you , educate yourself , or just grow up . 
  honestly it 's disturbing if you 're older that 15 . 
   you still did n't answer , and i assume you wo n't because you 're an ignorant murican/imbecile aaand i was correct . 
  no it 's not , i did n't say it is . 
  1 ) where did i complain ? 
  2 ) what persecution of croats and what do you know about it ? 
  persecution from where ? 
  enlighten me , please . 
  3 ) you still did n't answer , and i assume you wo n't because you 're an ignorant murican/imbecile , is it justified to expel serbs ? 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  i 'm referring to ethnic cleansing of serbs in croatia and bosnia . 
  how can you expel serbs from serbia , seriously wtf ? 
  unless of course if you commit ethnic cleansing of serbs , that 's totally a different thing , right ? 
  eh , we hate everyone , you 're not that special . 
  [ u wot m8 ?

  you love him so much so you decided to steal his watch ? 
  yeah , we should totally like them even though they bombed us 16 years ago . 
  what a retard you truly are . 
  i 'm not concerned about eu , i do n't care about that . 
  i 'm just pointing out that this protests in serbia should n't bring us anti-immigrant/refugees violence unlike slovakia or germany . 
  this protest is more anti-eu than anti-immigrant . 
  i seriously doubt anyone would attack them . 
  what about serbs ? 
  explain please . 
  it did n't go well for who ? 
  when lithuanians ( or any other baltic shithole ) make fun of serbia . 
  damn . . you 're known for ... ? 
  nothing , correct .
