   to continue the ills of unsustainable societies as western capitalist ones with the help of migration is crazy . 
  this is very true as well , but afaik germany has a serious demographic issue , they 're not even at replacement rate levels and have the lowest fertility rate in the entire world . 
  maybe germany should start some kind of fertility-boosting policies ? 
  i know denmark does something similar . 
   that is because fortunately also the nazis do n't produce offspring very well . 
  alright but the statement is still kind of creepy to be honest i do n't really see the difference between the subtitles say and what he actually said, 
   it reminds me of that gysi ( former head of the german leftist party ) video last month with the misleading subtitles that made it look like he relishes in the low birth rates of all germans/nazis . 
  oh man i remember that video , it was quite fucked up . 
  so it was fake ? 
  thank goodness what was he actually saying though ? 
  from my cursory knowledge of german i thought the subtitles were accurate . 
  malta seems like a very unique and great little country . 
  hope i get to visit your islands one day , 
  this is from the [ europe according to ... ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/news/europe-according ) series of images which are 50/50 bullshit/funny i 'm pretty sure no one in serbia sees belarus as `` slobodan 2.0 '' and turkey as `` non-suicidal muslims '', 
  vice ai n't really indie anymore though , maybe in the early 2000s it still was . 
  i agree though they produce quality , albeit slightly edgy sometimes , content . 
  great response , thank you for taking the time i had no idea malta liked the uk so much , though it 's not unheard of for former british colonies to admire their rulers ( i know some jamaicans are nostalgic for british rule ) . 
  are you guys being hit harder by immigrants/refugees from africa recently ? 
  you 're * really * close to the african coast so i can only imagine you get a lot of boat people . 
   swedes swedes in malta ? 
  how come ? 
  how about religion ? 
  is the stereotype about malta being an ultra-catholic still true ? 
  i know you guys just recently legalized divorce but do most people actually participate actively in the church ( e.g attend mass , follow rules , etc. ), 
  i actually laughed clever, 
   hungary greedy/cheap scot jokes i guess here are some scot jokes from hungary i found on a 2013 posting of this image : in a dark corner a scottish guy got stopped by a mugger . 
  `` 100 pounds or your life ! '', 
  `` here 's 50 . 
  i 'm already half dead from the scare . '', 
  _ the scot and his son are walking in the market . 
  suddenly the son asks : `` dad , can i get an orange ? '', 
  `` but dad !, 
  i 'd really like one ! '', 
  `` alright son , then spit on a vendor and maybe he 'll throw one at you ! '', 
  _ a scottish kid asks his dad : `` daddy , what will be under the christmas tree this year ? '', 
  `` floor . '', 
  _ the scot is cutting the grass in the garden , when his wife shouts out the window : `` john !, 
  there 're two guys here . 
  they asking for donations for the new public swimming pool . 
  what should i give them ? '', 
  `` two baskets of water ! '', 
  _ the scot is in terrible pain , because of his teeth . 
  he goes to the dentist , and in the dentist chair he starts nervously checking his pockets . 
  `` do n't worry , you do n't have to pay in advance ! '', 
  - says the doctor `` i 'm not worried about that . 
  just want to count my money before the anastesia ! '', 
  _ two scottish guys meet at the caf\u00e9 . 
  one of them tells the other that he 'll have a date there today . 
  `` and ? 
  she 's not here yet ? '', 
  `` yeah , she 's here . 
  the girl at the corner table . '', 
  `` and what 's the matter ? '', 
  `` i asked her , that she should eat donuts so i can recognise her . 
  she 's eating the fifth one , but i 'm waiting for her to become full , so i do n't have to buy dinner for her . '', 
   i meant that it is beneath the modern western adult to glorify and celebrate beheadings . 
   you 're simply stating the obvious : that violence is sometimes justified . 
  i 've already said that . 
  yeah , maybe we misunderstood each other a little , i thought you were entirely against any kind of violent resistance . 
  i just think the flag looks badass and the `` gosh we 're in the 21st century '' argument against it is kind of stupid . 
   you 're confusing the ends and the means again . 
  no i 'm not . 
  violence is not always bad . 
  violence simply is . 
  if you 're defending your land or your people against invaders , or defending yourself against an attacker/rapist/thief the violence you 're using to get there is not immoral . 
   it should n't come to that well tough shit we live on a planet where some people will kidnap children to rape them for years on end , non-violent disruption wo n't change anything about that . 
  are we supposed to stay on the sidelines and hold a sit-in ? 
   21st century europe is inexcusable . 
  does the date change the fact that the sardinians successfully defended their land from invading imperialists ? 
  does the date change the fact that people to this day still use violence to defend noble causes when there is no other option ? 
  the date is completely irrelevant . 
   violence is never worth celebrating i respectfully disagree . 
  plenty of completely justified violent uprisings and rebellions . 
  i 've always been fascinated by how malta differs from most of europe by its pretty strict catholicism and traditionalism . 
  is it still like that ? 
   massive `` foreigners are better than us '' complex what do you mean by that ? 
  they like immigration ? 
  `` i 'm from finland/ireland/any other european country that did n't colonize and was colonized itself '' -  `` yeah but you still benefited from economic growth of colonialism '' ??? 
  top argument 10/10 really fantastic logic, 
   how is that still allowed in the 21st century ? 
  it 's celebrating their liberation from imperialists . 
  i think that 's a pretty good thing to display on your flag . 
  most gypsies i 've met in serbia do n't mind calling themselves/their group * cigani * in an informal context . 
  roma is the formal word though . 
  [ this is you . 
  : / that sucks hopefully people are a little bit more open-minded here, 
   i am an atheist , before you jump on me fucking sad to see this disclaimer everywhere on reddit but i get why you would say it, 
  or pro and anti life see how that frames the debate in one direction ? 
  no i was n't : / what term do you think should be used ? 
  pro-abortion is n't really an accurate representation of the pro-choice side 's idea , and nobody wants to be anti-something , but rather pro-something . 
   applies to the removal of a cluster of cells in my books . 
  so does it apply when the cluster of cells gets bigger , or grows limbs ? 
   in all seriousness though it 's just a name that both sides of the argument can use without anyone getting their panties in a bunch . 
  it 'd be pretty unproductive in debates if each side called the other anti-life/anti-choice . 
   we europeans are n't prudes and can handle the reality of life . 
  what 's that got to do with the use of the term pro-life ? 
  i know man i loathe downvotes most of the time such a shit hivemind system , prevents any real discussion from taking place . 
  alright , it 's quite sensible . 
  i do n't necessarily agree but i can respect your opinion . 
  do you have any specific opinions on how to deal with the immigration issues happening these days in europe ?
