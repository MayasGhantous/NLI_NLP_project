   voting booth voting and parliamentary democracy are bourgeois institutions that serve only to consolidate the aforementioned class ' power agree to disagree, 
  fair point , i just think it 'd be a pretty intense rivalry and not just two bullies having a go, 
  and what makes you think any future secessionist wars would n't receive external support as well ? 
  none of this precludes a rebel/secessionist victory though , as evidenced by countless historical examples . 
  yes war is shit , civil war even shittier , but sometimes it 's necessary .

  as if warfare has always been symmetrical , and as if the only way to win in an armed conflict is to overpower your adversary . 
  besides , you honestly think soldiers are going to listen to those orders ? 
  `` wipe out your fellow countrymen because we said so '' ? 
  large-scale mutinies would happen .

  i think it 's fascinating to see the juxtaposition between how similar the world stays throughout the ages and the radically different ways people thought of themselves , of their fellow humans , of the universe , etc, 
  ok , just explain to me in what way would a second cold war be `` like 2 bullies fighting each other 's '' and not the same as the first one, 
  no problem and yes soviets are not famous for their flawless decisions all the time ... 
  well the cold war was n't `` the world split in two '' , you seem to be forgetting the sizeable nam contingent ( which contained literally most countries on earth ) . 
  nato pretty much englobes every country that fought on the us/capitalist/western side in the cold war and more , now that most ex-ussr republics have joined nato . 
  so a war between the two would be even bigger than the last one . 
  pola ovih stvari su eksluzivno u ratu se desavale but okay, 
  what is nato , alex. 
  yes it is, 
  tru romania takes the prize for that, 
  yes , and ? 
   consuming any resources is capitalism since when ? 
  check this guy 's post history even more obsessed with serbia than that panonia guy, 
   rivers of carp blood running through the snow . 
  poetic, 
  orthodox fasts are pretty varied though , some are fish allowed , some are oil allowed , some are even dairy allowed etc. 
  monks and other very pious people are basically vegans though i grant you that lmao, 
  i know , i 'm pretty sure it has adverse effects on iq to watch the same story over and over again for decades, 
  damn your post history is pathetic, 
  yep if cop21 's final report does n't read like the communist manifesto it 'll turn out to be just another grandiose diplomatic farce, 
  source ? 
  even if true he still has a huge point , ussr was state capitalism as well, 
  that 's because it is n't `` the serbs '' that tried to commit genocide it was paramilitary groups and certain elements of a dictatorial regime 's police force, 
  catholic serb ? 
  you mean croat ? 
  is joke pls no attack, 
  it was so weird at family reunions seeing 12 babas in one room watching esmeralda or some other telenovela like it was the most fascinating shit now she watches some turkish and indian ones ? 
  both pretty dreadful looking tbh, 
  right ? 
  you can really pinpoint when the climate changes , macedonia 's landscape reminds me much more of greece than anything north of the border, 
  war and its dehumanizing effect is a central theme so i 'd say it 's not patriotic but then again it 's impossible to make an entirely anti war film as truffaut said, 
  this if anyone would like an even more in-depth look at the issue , https://placesjournal.org/article/history-of-the-present-belgrade/, 
  battle of vienna movie w h e n, 
  full metal jacket is pretty cynical though, 
  this is offensive to me, 
  this also happens in montenegro https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrug5eszmq another cultural similarity between albania and montenegro are sworn virgins ( existed elsewhere in the balkans before but now only a few are still alive in those countries : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkan_sworn_virgins, 
  unrelated but macedonia is a nice little country , drove through it once real nice landscapes, 
   erdogans new palace . 
  knock on wood, 
  idk , of all the speeches i 've listened to from him , he sounded quite normal , mind linking a few where he is talking like a gopnik ? 
  then again i do n't know what a gopnik sounds like but i 'd assume it 's easy to assess, 
  that kind of multiculturalism , no , because that 's essentially letting yourself be conquered by reactionary outside forces and not doing shit about it the vast , vast majority are able to live in peace with different religions and ethnicities though, 
  haha well tbh that is a pretty cool sculpture even without the lasers ( where is that anyway , kiev ? ), 
  i was talking about commieblocks like [ this ] ( http://www.napred.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/stambenaizgradnja10-velika.jpg ), 
  as another commenter mentioned , whether a president is `` classy '' has nothing to do with why they do what they actions . 
  you think obama did a buzzfeed feature and used 15 memes in it because he is a `` cool guy '' ? 
  no he is acting in a way that he knows will help him consolidate his support in the voter base mentalities are different across regions of the world . 
  what works in sweden would probably bomb very fucking hard in russia or another country that belongs to a similar cultural group ( old-fashioned , traditional , patriarchal , etc. ), 
  lmao ? 
  it really happened , the pilot even became friends with zoltan i think they made a documentary, 
  eh it 's not that bad , lot of much worse communist architecture in the world still standing, 
  nice !, 
  in serbia , slavic pagan rituals like burning of oaks on the winter solstice were totally incorporated into christmas rituals but at least we still have them in that form https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/badnjak_ ( serbian ), 
  why 'd they only leave now though , assad 's been in power for years ? 
  because of conscription ? 
  this guy god bless, 
   albania 's favorite holiday is pagan . 
  what holiday would that be ? 
  and is it illyrian paganism or something else ? 
  just in case you are n't aware why https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman_hungary, 
   i do n't think we really have ottoman influence . 
  makes sense , as you were n't conquered by them :p, 
  do you use any turkisms ? 
  my family over there uses a lot of italian words and cooks with a lot of italian influence but i do n't remember a lot of ottoman influence either linguistically or culinarily , maybe it 's just not present in the littoral region ? 
  slovenia is kind of like nebraska or wyoming with a coast because of its obscurity best country in europe tbh, 
  yep most people do n't know that the largest beneficiary of us int ' l aid by far is israel, 
  lib\u00e9ration does n't fall into the same category as meekly denouncing political correctness from a liberal perspective though ... another league than huffpost or vox or guardian, 
  i 'm just saying it 's not tacit . 
  a lot of politcians pay explicit lip service to israel `` our great allies '', 
  idk about the round table , but at the first assembl\u00e9e , you would sit in a very specific spot according to what you believed ( google montagnards , jacobins , for more info ), 
  western ( and especially american ) support for israel is not tacit . 
  they 're all derivative of the french national assembly , whose hemicyclical shape was more used as a way to situate people on the newfangled left/right political spectrum than just to make everyone feel equal , though that probably influenced the shape as well . 
  is guernesey also a tax haven ? 
  if so , how has it directly affected people 's lives ? 
  i recently listened to a talk where the speaker was railing against jersey 's tax haven status as being totally at the mercy of corporate and financial interest and having significantly diminished quality of life for the island 's population , is that accurate in your experience ? 
  what the fuck kind of headline is this , on politico of all places i thought they were legit `` look at what this croatian dude did '', 
  exactly , but a welfare state whose benefits are exclusively available to those that are part of a pseudoscientific racial category ( also the government was imperialist , racist , genocidal , and that the means of production were still privately owned ) does not make for a socialist society . 
  maybe by some twisted american definition ( where * obama * gets called a socialist ) yeah , but not in reality . 
  mussolini was different from hitler in that he was part of italy 's socialist movements and was influenced to a certain degree by certain marxist thinkers before becoming a fascist , so * maybe * you can detect some elements that are similar between leftist movements and italian fascism but that still does n't make mussolini 's italy socialist . 
   massive public works projects to employ the masses as did fdr fdr was also not a socialist, 
  if it is your opinion , well then  support the right people , the free syrian army them being the right people is just one opinion and , i ca n't for the life of me find the source now but it 's somewhere on / r/syriancivilwar , factions like ypg have expressed much gratitude towards airstrikes ( i do n't know whose , both russian and coalition ones ) so i do n't think we can say that they are as effective as fliers, 
  is that your opinion , or the british opposition 's ? 
  whatever hitler said is 100 % hot air and populism , a hallmark of fascism . 
  even hillary clinton could say that without endangering her campaign and she is a liberal capitalist . 
  nazis literally purged their party of all elements of socialism and communism , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/night_of_the_long_knives i 'm not a historian but you could go on / r/askhistorians or / r/socialism _ 101 and ask whether he was a socialist and you 'd get a fuller response, 
  once again , i just ask what are the alternate proposals by the opposition in this debate ? 
  nothing ? 
  distribute flyers in syria ?
