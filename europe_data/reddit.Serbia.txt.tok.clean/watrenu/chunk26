   national socialist nazis were not socialists , they were fascists . 
  corporatists , communist-killing , and leftist-killing , fascists . 
  out of curiosity , what are the anti-strikes british politicians proposing as alternatives in the fight against is ? 
  i definitely agree that bombing * can * be a pretty shit strategy , but it but it can also greatly help the ground forces that are fighting is ( certain kurdish factions have already said that it 's really helpful , afaik ), 
  maybe , we ca n't really know in which direction they 'd make the media machine run and what narrative they 'd craft for western audiences if there was simply a referendum . 
  i 'm not a part of american top brass but i think it 's pretty obvious to see that america strategically profits from kosovo 's existence and does n't from crimea 's , which is why the narratives are different . 
  disclaimer : i generally support both crimea 's independance/annexation as well as kosovo 's independance, 
   ok , the referendum was after russia invaded . 
  the events around the referendum were definitely very sketchy but there is no doubt in my , or most people 's ( even very anti-putin ones ) , mind that crimea would have voted in overwhelming numbers to join russian anyway . 
  do n't do the clauzel pls, 
   i would remove the stupid idea of `` srpska '' . 
  why ? 
  dislike the idea of a separatist republic based on ethnicity ? 
  do you support kosovo 's existence ? 
   any serb who refuses should do what the croatian serbs did and go to serbia . 
  once again , this would be a huge humanitarian disaster because it would be , literally , ethnic cleansing . 
  you want another humanitarian disaster ? 
  i know i do n't , i know they do n't . 
  the serbs in bosnia have been there , literally , for hundreds and hundreds of years , and 99.99 % had absolutely * nothing * to do with the genocide and ethnic cleansing . 
  the ones responsible have already been tried and sentenced . 
  bosnia is fucked but you ca n't really do anything about it without making an even bigger mess . 
   let 's just hope this was a simple lunatic . 
  for all intents and purposes , those do n't really exist anymore . 
  the bomber 's actions will invariably be added to the great quilt of 21th terrorism whether he wanted that or not . 
  serbs existed in bosnia * long * before the genocide, 
  when i was a kid in canada a lot of muslim parents opted their kids out of religious education classes . 
  religious education , like these are the world 's religions etc. 
  not catechism classes . 
  nowadays they ca n't do that anymore, 
  weeew friend hit the brakes on that anti-serb sentiment will you get flair too so we can call you out based on the actions of extremists plz, 
  for all the animosity that is directed towards them by neighboring countries , it 's a miracle they still have n't been vaporized * and * are successfully running one of the most open colonization policies in the modern world . 
  so i 'd say she has a bit of a point . 
  though israel is literally an american military outpost so unless you want to turn you country into that there 's no chance in hell you can attain that level of success in matters of security and military . 
  edit : lmao zionist brigade ? 
   11 . young muslim women are really , really , really ambitious . 
  i do n't know in which context the author meant this , but i confirm . 
  some of the absolute smartest , most ambitious people i know are young muslim women . 
  a , though i take care to remove the stem from both halves with two oblique incisions once i make that first , sagittal cut, 
   even in the last war there were serbs fighting in croatian army and croats in yugoslav army . 
  former minister \u017deljko jovanovi\u0107 is an ethnic serb who served in croatian army during the war . 
  damn did n't know that , just goes to show you how identity is as malleable as play-doh . 
  i 'd go so far as to say that the ex-yugoslav region is * the * area with the most bizarre identity crises in europe . 
  well i was being a tiny tiny bit facetious with my comment , because i know these switches happened . 
  a man from my granddad 's village was a cetnik in wwii and in his biography , he calls my granddad ( who fought for partizans from the start ) a great man and freedom fighter , so obviously the motivations of individuals in joining these movements might have been varied ( like a more religious individual would probably have joined the ndh army or the cetniks without knowing the full extent of their genocide/collaboration ) , which does not diminish the fact that the goals of these organizations were misguided at best genocidal at worst the gist of my comment was , serb = / = cetnik nazi collaborator the same way that croat = / = ustasa genocide-loving nazi , it 's much better to judge people by actions than by whether they spoke this or that dialect or went to orthodox/catholic church, 
  which is why it is much easier to just class everyone into two categories not based on nationality , ethnicity , etc. 
  but on action and membership : 1 ) nazis and other human excrement ( cetnik , ustasa , all collaborators , quislings , and other scum ) 2 ) fighters for liberty and freedom ( partizan forces and allied forces ), 
  i agree . 
  that 's your experience ... 
  i 've been ( and still am ) a part of it and do n't feel the same way at all, 
  out of curiosity what is the 88 in your username referring to ? 
  not trying to start a debate about anything ok i am half croat just curious, 
  relevant username lmao, 
  fair point , but smaller towns with closer communities being more religious than bigger towns with looser communities being less religious certainly does n't disprove anything that i said . 
  it 's just insufficient data for a satisfactory response . 
  here you go , more imperial rhetoric from russia http://www.dw.com/en/russia-ratchets-up-war-rhetoric-and-not-just-in-syria/a-18896274, 
   how does russia expand like an empire ? 
  well for one , it is * right now * desperately trying to keep its only med sea base by fighting on the side of its ally in syria . 
  ukraine ripped forever ? 
  once again , crimea and eastern ukraine are still battlegrounds of russian imperialism . 
  yea you could make the case that crimea is legitimately russian territory due to its majority russian population but it was n't done without russian intervention ... whether they 're in a recession does n't change the fact that russia has imperial ambitions , and its foreign policy/military expansion policies of the last few years are proof of this . 
  let me remind you that russia still has interests in moldova https://news.vice.com/article/moldova-arrests-13-accused-of-plotting-to-establish-russian-separatist-republic wan na bet these guys got a few $ $ $ from kremlin ? 
  just like american `` democracy '' spreading . 
  russia expands like an empire , and has imperial ambitions . 
  its military is the second most powerful on earth . 
  if that 's not empire-level i do n't know what is . 
   multipolarity is a myth of idealistic anti-americans ... why though ? 
   religion had an oppressive role , not social . 
  what ? 
  of course the church had a social role , even the most rabid antitheist would admit that . 
  that 's even the only positive point atheists usually agree on saying exists in religion . 
  keep in mind that smaller towns with closer communities are also ( surprise ) more religious on average . 
  i do n't think that could ever happen . 
  both russia and usa are empire-level powers and empires clash by design . 
  changing rulers wo n't do much to change political systems . 
  hmm true , they did try though !, 
  say what you will about russia , but one thing they 're really good at is staying out of america 's sphere of influence, 
  the ex-yugoslav region , and the entirety of the balkans for that matter , has been a playground for various empires and colonialists for hundreds of years until we finally rid ourselves of foreign domination towards the 20th century . 
  saying that our problems stem from many causes , division being a very big one , is not a controversial or historically unsupported idea . 
  let 's not pretend that any of the republics are now more powerful or sovereign than we were when we were united . 
  all those other problems you mention are very real ( save for the bullshit about backwards culture , which is pretty much just racism you 've internalized ) , but are linked in many ways to our legacy of colonial exploitation . 
  a great man once said : `` nijedna nasa republika nebi bila niko i nista da nismo svi zajedno . '', 
  one of the most well-known serbian songs , * tamo daleko * or * there , far away * , was written about this , it 's a really great solemn song about a homesick soldier yearning for his hometown while in exile on corfu . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njtmtsxts_i [ instrumental version ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj9hd733v-8 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/there,_far_away fun fact it was played at tesla 's funeral, 
  most white americans are at least partly , if not overwhelmingly , of german heritage , so your bizarro world scenario is true at least in some way . 
  les russes , eux , finissent avec un '' \u010d '' , donc un tch grave , peut-etre pour ca que ca te semble plus naturel  [ un video ou on prononce vu\u010di\u0107 , autour de 0:20 ] ( https://youtu.be/xghhw5uyahg?t=20 ), 
  point taken , but even rights of man and republicanism ( especially republicanism ) are distinctly bourgeois institutions and ideas , not proletarian . 
  for an example of an actually proletarian revolution in france look no further than the commune . 
  the french revolution was not a working class revolution , it was a bourgeois revolution from beginning to end . 
  yeah well both play this game tbh , though vu\u010di\u0107 is the one that goes on eu visits while nikoli\u0107 mostly plays the russian side, 
  absolutely . 
  milosevic and all the other nationalist traitors really , * really * fucked us up ( in a lot of ways more important than eu membership as well ) . 
  if only tito was alive at the time he 'd have tucked them away for an extended vacation on goli otok but he was n't immortal , unfortunately . 
  voutch ( like in ** ch ** urch ) itch ( comme dans [ ** tch ** in-tchin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdjcfirp_te ) ) le deuxieme '' \u0107 '' est plus aigu que le premier '' \u010d '', 
  keep in mind that serbs are basically 99 % the same as croats and the countries/nationalists of both sides have a. . . tense national relationship to say the least . 
  the only reason why we are literally ( literally ! ), 
  the only country in europe still majority pro-russia is because a ) no stalin/warsaw pact that made us fear the russians b ) historical ally and still helps out on the international stage c ) did n't bomb us in the 90s and constantly defies `` the west '' which did so yeah remove any of these and the whole `` russia is our mother '' thing would quickly crumble . 
  i 'm pretty sure lithuanians did n't hate russia until they experienced what being next to them is like , and france was a huge ally to serbia until the 90s . 
  1 ) i can not speak for all serbs , south slavs , slavs , balkanites , or any other group i am a part of 2 ) `` people '' can mean many , many things . 
  obviously russians are not the same ethnic group as serbs so what do you mean , other than that ? 
  eh `` hate '' is big word for that .
