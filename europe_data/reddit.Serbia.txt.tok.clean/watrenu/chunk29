  every day that goes by i understand why these kind of people were treated the way they were in sfrj, 
  no i just did n't understand the logic behind that statement , `` this is what people in syria live every day '' , because the people that are causing the suffering in syria are ... the same kind of jihadist this terrorist was anyway best not dwell too much on it, 
   of course the same logic should apply for them yeah , of course not . 
  isis and other jihadists kill for the glory of god/because we are kufar and need to be punished/because we live a haram lifestyle/etc . 
  to them all of europe and many muslims are a target . 
  what europe and other civilized parts of the world need to do is take a firm stance and eliminate the problem of jihadism at its root , when it starts . 
  simply being a muslim does n't count as wearing isis 's uniform , of course not that is too vague and large a category to make a good judgement . 
  but calling for death of infidels and praising terrorism ? 
  that 's an act of war and we should act accordingly . 
  that 's wearing a uniform of isis and that 's being a target . 
  how you can compare this to isis that wants to kill everyone who is n't a radical islamist is beyond me, 
  i ca n't fucking believe this shit ever happened . 
  i ca n't imagine all these people that i know , friends family and neighbours , being barbaric to that point . 
  what the fuck prompted this sudden outburst of pure hatred between brotherly nations ? 
  i mean even my croatian and serbian relatives that lean to the nationalist side would never dream of systematically executing children , least i hope so . 
  what do you mean ? 
  isis has no legitimate targets but isis and other jihadist groups definitely are a legitimate target for us, 
   `` this is what people in syria live every day '' ... yeah and it 's because of scum that are exactly the same as they were ? 
  i do n't understand the terrorist logic at play here, 
  good response , do you think it 'd hold up in a human rights court or something like that though ? 
  gavrilo princip is a hero and freedom fighter as are all anti-imperialist nationalists in history, 
  fair enough , but a syrian not knowing does n't change the fact that germany is not a christian country in the way that isis is a `` muslim '' / semi-islamic inspired islamist state . 
  the cdu is n't really a christian party in the same way that an islamist party/political contingent is muslim germany is one of the most irreligious countries in europe, 
  powerful western *** country germany is not really a christian country except in an anachronistic way, 
  the quote said muslims in europe ( who do not appear out of thin air , but are either born in or descended from people born in muslim countries ) have views that are n't easily reconciled with the values of european liberal democracies that are the standard in the eu ( and even in pretty much all non-eu countries in europe ) . 
  birdlover then said `` yeah well quite a few european countries do n't share these values either '' to which i replied that i can not fathom which european country compares with most majority muslim countries in terms of systematic and endemic sexism . 
  according to the world economic forum 2013 global gender gap report , ** 10 of the top 10 most sexist countries on the planet are muslim-majority countries ** . 
  even albania or russia ( which i imagine are the `` kind '' of countries this person had in mind when writing their comment ) are nowhere near as bad ( montenegro , a country i 'd personally consider to have one of the most sexist societies in europe is n't even on the list , but i 'd bet it 's in the same range as the aforementioned two ) . 
  http://www3.weforum.org/docs/wef_gendergap_report_2013.pdf http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/top-10-unfair-countries-women-yemen-pakistan-519682, 
  did i say anything about that ? 
  pushed what ? 
  yes but coming from a croat it could have been a jab . 
  which is why i found it funny . 
  it was n't a very serious conversation, 
  as you said , while illegal . 
  there is plenty of inequality but at least governments in europe are expected and pressured to do something about it . 
  once again , i agree , but the quote was talking about the rift between non-european muslim countries and european countries , which is why i only responded about that, 
  yeah absolutely , but i was really just talking about islam here because that was the subject of the quote did n't downvote you btw, 
  oh it is but he implied serbia was not white ( or maybe he did n't , but i doubt he stuck to strict boolean logic with his statement ) which is why i said that, 
  women have pretty much the same legal status as men in all countries on the european continent afaik . 
  yes , sure , some countries have restrictions on abortion , contraception , gay marriage , etc. 
  but nothing comparable with many muslim countries which is what the quote was referring to . 
   rich and * white * lol nice jab, 
  like which ? 
  genuinely asking because even the most sexist countries in europe are miles ahead from countries like sa and somalia . 
  if that is n't * terror * - inducing , then i do n't know what is almost rivals american * shock and awe * on the terrorism scale, 
   there are no local conflicts any more scary  thinking that random lines out of the quran lead people to blow themselves up is like claiming that they ira was fighting a catholic war . 
  thank you, 
  wtf are those supposed to be lmao, 
  [ competition ] ( http://www.tportal.hr/resourcemanager/getimage.aspx?imgid=526547&amp;shotid=1&amp;width=630&amp;height=360 ) is [ tight ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/aleksandar_vu%c4%8di%c4%87.jpg ) , i admit . 
  wow i thought we were friends, 
  karamarko looks almost as stupid as vu\u010di\u0107 , congratulations !, 
  makes sense , thanks for answering . 
  why are msm so much more at risk ? 
  is it just because of anal sex ? 
  or less condom use ? 
  ca n't the blood be tested for hiv beforehand , why make a sweeping ban on all msm who donate blood ? 
  i do n't really understand all of this, 
  this is a very cozy video of [ finns building a log house . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3j5wkjfjze ), 
  i guess i just personally dislike the modernist style really , it 's not objectively bad, 
  that chq building is nice , i googled dublin docklands and [ this ] ( http://newinireland.com/images/users/image175.jpg ) shit and [ this ] ( http://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.1987638.1415116751!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_620_330/image.jpg ) shit appeared . 
  good to know that the restoration is n't all bad . 
  the reason why i care so much is because right now , the biggest controversy in belgrade is a huge development project called belgrade waterfront , financed by the uae , and they want to build some kind of mini dubai shit that does n't respect the surroundings at all . 
  [ look at this ] ( http://www.pravda.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beogradnavodi-beobuildrs.jpg ) . 
  they did restore a nice old building , and props to them for that ( [ image ] ( http://www.failedarchitecture.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/belgrade-cooperative-building-830x679.jpg ) ) , but the plan just seems like it 's going to fuck up belgrade 's architecture even more than it is now because of the [ commieblocks ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/18256288.jpg ) we have . 
  if you care you can read more about the issue here http://www.failedarchitecture.com/belgrade-waterfront/, 
  certainly , i guess i just have an aversion to this kind of property development . 
  if i was the main architect , i 'd have renovated the run-down industrial area but kept the facades distinctive look ( i personally enjoy the facades of old urban factories ) for an example of the renovation of run-down areas in a city done right , i think marseille 's dock renovation is an example of what we should do : keep the architectural spirit of the area intact and renew at the same time . 
  looks gaudy as all hell , as expected, 
   i think it 's really important for both poland and romania to see a lot of our people working abroad , return home . 
  absolutely this is priority one for serbia as well , and other countries in the region, 
  thank you !, 
  will be useful, 
  from the looks of it the buildings are all going to be ugly postmodern blocks of glass and steel i hope to live to see the day when beautiful architecture starts being the norm once again, 
  do you know of any sources to back these statements up ( like the lack of food and money , esp compared to ethnic romanians , or even interviews with roma ) ? 
  i believe you but i need to learn more about this subject for a project . 
   now , they are not forced so they just do n't go . 
  since they can only live from subsistence agriculture , they make more kids to help out with the work . 
  they dont go to the city-hall to make ids for their kids , so they ca n't receive any kind of aid - they do n't exist from a bureaucracy point of view . 
  do you have any sources for this ? 
  i entirely believe you but i am working on a project that relates closely to this and need to find more info on how romania is progressing in its roma inclusion programs , and in what ways the system can be ameliorated . 
  roma , as expected , unfortunately . 
  does anyone know where i can find data on poverty in romanian roma vs general romanian population/romanians ( ethnically ) ? 
  nah , i do n't think he celebrated his family 's slava , but he was a weird dude overall , as geniuses tend to be . 
  celibate for life , called pigeons his best friends , etc. 
  no he is georgian nikola teshvili, 
  wow true , see even i am confused and i 've been trying to remember this for years, 
  he was a ) ethnically serb b ) born on current croatian land c ) which was at the time part of austria-hungary i mean it certainly is confusing so i do n't hold it against people . 
  a lot of the times the only people who care about this are serbs and croats tbh, 
  sounds like hungarian propaganda tbh lmao, 
  aah my bad , i just assumed it was turkish in origin due to its similarity to other distinctly turkish loanwords used in serbo-croatian ( eg kajmak for instance ), 
  interesting , in serbian * zamak * means castle , and i always thought it was of turkish origin . 
  do you have many turkish words in czech ? 
  not an invention but nikola tesla croat , serb , austrian , austro-hungarian ( ? 
  ) , etc my current physics textbook says he is a croat which is n't that bad , when i 've heard people say he was hungarian ... 
  tru also turkey needs to get rid of the neo-ottomanist wannabe sultan fuck you just elected asap, 
  wow i had no idea warsawa was this nice !, 
  beautiful city, 
  good riddance continue ridding your country of this scum bosnia , wish you luck,
