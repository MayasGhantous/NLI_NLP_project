  sick man of europe round 2 , 
   says he has stayed faithful to his vow of celibacy because he has `` never touched a woman '' lmao nice try father, 
  laudable , i see they 're going to accept more by the end of next year . 
  good job !, 
   chances of serbia joining nato are incredibly slim . 
  and rightly so , i do n't see it happening in a few decades , if ever . 
  absolutely . 
  public opinion against nato is still widespread , and russian media really pushes that angle as much as they can because not only is it in their interest , it is what a lot of serbs feel themselves . 
  [ see this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj8s46r7udy ) . 
  i 'd put the possibility nato membership * at the very least * a generation in the future , a few decades after eu membership . 
  i must admit i am puzzled at the high support this `` great chance '' of montenegro receiving a nato invitation is getting . 
  43 % is pretty high , montenegrins have never had any big historic animosity with serbia and many consider themselves very close to serbs , if not fully serbs . 
  this is very important news , but the real tipping point when it comes to russia 's influence in south-eastern europe/west balkans will be when/if serbia joins nato . 
  russia may be reluctant to go full-on information war/ukraine-style situation on serbia ( or montenegro ) , even when we eventually do join the eu , due to the significant distance between the two countries . 
  i would give a lot to be able to see the kremlin 's contingency plans for serbian eu , nato , etc. 
  memberships and further distancing from russia . 
  at one point we 'll have to jump over one side of the fence , and as much as my nationalist srs type friends might deny it , election/polling results already show which side that is ... http://www.cepolicy.org/publications/serbias-relations-nato-other-quieter-game-town, 
  lmao but come on bro bratstvo i jedinstvo and all that, 
  the mapmaker missed a fantastic opportunity for marking serbia as siberia, 
  no tbh serbian is most powerful language of europe pricaj srpski da te ceo svet razume zar te nije niko to naucio, 
  i can see how it sound be like that like a more nasal dutch with more extended vowels, 
   to their mind wearing a headscarf was almost automatically the same as going to syria lmao and their suspicion comes with reason . 
  native european converts to islam are often some of the most extreme muslims , one of the biggest islamic extremists in germany is a native . 
  likewise with the `` sharia for uk '' activists , their leader is a native englishman afaik . 
  convert 's zeal is a thing . 
  this is a very bad argument for your side because if we follow your line of reasoning then * clearly * the better option is to not let any muslims in . 
  cheap kebab is not worth 500 years of religious warring . 
  you really think that aside from a few military expeditions poor euros were `` invading '' na ? 
  they were just looking for a better life man why the double standards, 
  priests driving expensive cars always looks so wrong to me ... 
  i do n't know about you but i never actually touch a cross/icon with my lips if it is n't mine , i hover above for that reason . 
  care to explain why ? 
  lmao i must admit this is hilarious, 
  oh i thought ypg was the armed wing of the pkk , the `` people '' and red star confused me . 
  who are peshmerga then ? 
  yeah i know i was actually sincerely asking who the western coalition considers moderate rebels , beyond fsa . 
  i just read the usa is going to arm ypg/pkk , but they 're far-left ( afaik ) and i find it intriguing that the usa is supporting leftist rebels . 
  maybe i 'm stuck looking at the situation from a 20th century pov where the usa was better dead than red lol, 
  i do n't think i get your point fully , and i do n't think people like lord rose make any distinction between refugees or migrants from eu and outside of the eu . 
  to his class it 's just more desperate labor . 
  http://diepresse.com/layout/diepresse/files/wahlen/201510gmwien/gm-presse/data/9.jsp spo 39.44 % fpo 32.23 % not what i would call a `` total smash '' , especially not in `` red vienna '', 
   who supported low wages for migrants it 's like they do n't even want to hide their true goal . 
  i support accepting refugees but lowering wages are exactly why the rich want as many desperate immigrants possible . 
  i must admit i am not too familiar with belarus ' politics , aside from the fact that it is an authoritarian regime , so i do n't know in which way it is a lost cause , save for its lack of democracy . 
  i recently met a guy from belarus and he seemed to support lukashenko , so yeah people like him seem to be common , but why are they wrong ? 
  are al-nusra considered `` moderate rebels '' ? 
  are the pkk/ypg considered `` moderate rebels '' ? 
   and i believe that 's equally dishonest that 's good , but unfortunately people will always twist definitions to make the opposite side seem evil and theirs the most virtuous . 
  in a world where politics were a neutral affair it 'd be much easier to have rational conversation about democratic and more authoritarian forms of government . 
   yet china and saudi are doing just fine . 
  i believe that the western world has been hypocritical regarding belarus because of geographic proximity . 
  as you say yourself , europeans have higher expectations of belarus and russia because they 're close and european to a certain extent . 
  if the global standard for political legitimacy was something other than democractic elections , then govt 's around the world that care about europe 's perception would be faking that standard . 
  there 's no way around it , and until people stop attacking belarus and other undemocratic countries solely for being undemocratic , they 'll continue to hold sham elections . 
  if you want to criticize belarus criticize lukashenko and co. 's policies , not the fact that he 's been prez for 5 terms . 
  not enough people care over there for that to be a serious issue . 
   amd trying to associate the word `` democracy '' with something else is unethical in my opinion . 
  you do realize that democracy has already been associated with something other than a specific form of government , do you ? 
  american imperialism is founded on the very concept of `` spreading democracy '' , countries call themselves democratic because it is associated on the world political stage with good , virtuous , ** legitimate ** , etc. 
  what lukashenko is saying is quite clear to me : they prefer swift results to democracy , him saying `` less death in childbirth is our democracy '' is not tricking belarussians it 's just rhetoric . 
  i 'm sure that if you had a conversation with him , he would have no problem admitting that his country is not very democratic . 
  hell , i 'm pretty sure no one in belarus is being fooled by the elections or the `` 5th term presidency '' , they just know it 's the only way for their country 's government to appear to be legitimate in world politics . 
  just like kings used to insist they had the divine right to rule , now presidents and chancellors must insist they are entrusted by the people 's will through votes and elections , or else they look illegitimate . 
   maybe serbia not even lmao yeah people like russia for various historical/political reasons but it 's far from a lingua franca . 
  if anything serbo-croatian is a kind of lingua franca for the ex-yu region , especially among older generations . 
  no i have n't , i 'm open to reading any i 'm not too versed in the subject , and where i live people have been saying it 's fucking terrible and will ruin our water and all that so i have n't exactly had an unbiased look at the issue, 
  interesting , i 'm a very mixed yugoslav ( and other ethnicities ) so that might explain why the way i refer to stuff is n't strictly serbian . 
  in my experience pita is the whole layered pastry filled with something meal , we 'd say burek ( cheese is implied ) , pita zeljanica for spinach , krompiru\u0161a for potato ( my grandma calls it kartofel pita ) , pita s mesom for meat , etc. 
  interesting , you have a link to that study ? 
  pull a cameron is a good euphemism, 
  i know which is why i said i do n't think it captures the whole concept very well . 
  i mean both mean some kind of defiance out of a less than pragmatic urge but it 's not the same , as you say . 
   stuff with the cheese is called sirnica ? 
  never in my life have i heard sirnica , always burek sa sirom . 
  burek was automatically assumed to be with cheese in my household . 
   i have n't seen any conclusive evidence that fracking is dangerous . 
  why is it destroying water supplies in america then ? 
  serious question , also have you seen gasland ? 
  ye my croatian relatives in dalmatia say tvrdoglav but i feel like it does n't capture the whole idea that well, 
  lmao shots fired at op, 
  the word inat ? 
  do you have another word for spite ? 
  yeah true, 
  just leave him in a wired room with a pig and 200 g of peruvian cocaine for 6 hours and you 'll be fine, 
  me too it 's the best source on the internet i 've found to explain inat `` defiance for the sake of defiance rather than to achieve a long-term goal '' is literally what these peasants are doing and anyone from the region can automatically sense it, 
  i would n't take their `` threat '' too seriously . 
  they 're probably threatening the patriarch to do it out of spite , as ex-yu country bumpkins ( and city dwellers albeit to a lesser extent ) usually like to do . 
  yeah i 've really only been following eu politics since this summer so i am not aware of how trends in eu public opinion wax and wane , how each member state usually answers each question , etc. 
  thanks for the links in any case, 
  thank you !, 
  i must say i am surprised at the nordics ' disagreement ( and belgium 's lukewarmness ) towards federalization . 
  also pretty big disparities between men and women in certain countries !, 
  i do think that the stance in eastern europe ( and western ) will have changed considerably following this whole migration debacle . 
  do you happen to know if these reports are annual , biennial , etc ? 
  i 'd like to see some stats , ca n't imagine support for a federation being high anywhere except in like belgium, 
   asking him to back their campaign for the building to be restored and not demolished , the congregation said : `` if we do not receive your support , we will be forced to collectively go over to islam ** in order to get better protection for our facilities under serbian law ** '' . 
  it goes on to compare the step to `` martyrdom '' , although it ** stresses that the converts would `` keep jesus christ in their heart '' . 
  ** yeah , this sounds more like a jab at their perception of the serbian gov ` ts supposed better treatment of islam than christianity than a true threat lmao at this comment on the serbian article :  \u041d\u0435 \u0431\u0438 \u0441\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 , \u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u0437 \u0438\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0431\u0438 . 
  `` they would n't turkify ( convert to islam ) for all the money in the world , but they would out of [ * inat * ] ( http://wwword.com/2685/words/untranslatable/inat/ ) '', 
   90 % of the people arriving in germany at the moment are from syria literally every source , check eurostat , says that it 's 20 % of migrants to europe that are from syria .
