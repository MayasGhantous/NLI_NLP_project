  usually they have to prove it , and also prove that they ca n't live anywhere else in the country i guess ? 
  lot of the current rules come from the 1951 un convention so you could check that out if you want yeah i agree about syrians , they should absolutely have the right to apply for asylum in eu . 
  i 'm just shocked that apparently the eu does n't let you apply for asylum in an embassy . 
  none of them are fleeing directly from syria , it 's not like eu embassies in turkey and jordan ca n't allow them to be processed or something . 
  the uk is doing the best thing in the whole crisis . 
  [ like this lol ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=sudtirol&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cakq_auoa2ovchmi7-snold_xwivcocsch0q-qtp&amp;biw=1408&amp;bih=670#imgrc=_ ) actually idk maybe there 's a mountain pass somewhere but it 's definitely not as easy as pannonian plain serbia/hungary, 
   yeah , but ** europeans are priviledged ** by and large , it 's the refugees / ** whatever reactionist term ** you want to call them that are desperate and willing to do anything . 
   they want money and prestige and were willing to put up with transborder trek to get it . 
  ** if you give them ways to distract themselves into getting the rat race you escape the risk of them converging in groups of dissatisfied young men . 
  ** definitely troll outright false and very bizarre reasoning actually 9/10 tricked me and many others, 
  i think it really works on a case-by-case basis , you can apply for asylum from literally any country you just have to prove that you are in danger for your life or something similar . 
  thing is sometimes entire countries get declared unsafe for lives so instead of having to justify yourself you can just say `` i 'm from [ unsafe country ] '' and get your asylum application approved . 
  right now syria is entirely unsafe afaik, 
  yes i see where this is going but i want to see it unravel, 
  it went ahead peacefully this year , try and check your dates before embarrassing yourself, 
   that way germany can get their 500k , sweden their 300k and spread the other 200k over the rest of the eu on a voluntary basis . 
  lol btw completely agree with that idea . 
  why the * fuck * is eu not taking refugees from neighboring countries ? 
  why are we encouraging the breakdown of european border protection ? 
  why are refugees not applying for asylum at eu embassies in the countries that they are in before paying smugglers ? 
  is eu so incompetent that they 've made illegal intrusions and ignoring dublin the only options for these people ? 
  so many questions, 
  have n't met one that is currently trying to get to germany and others plenty of interviews with them though if you 're asking if i know someone who has migrated : i 'm an immigrant to canada and one of my best friends is son of bosnian serb refugee . 
  a lot of my family had to move to serbia from croatia post-war . 
  unfortunately my community does not consist of various european villages , towns , and cities stretching from greece to sk\u00e5ne so that is not really actionable advice my neighbours and community are also a few thousands miles away from the crisis so they are n't much help if footage reports and interviews from literally every single major european news outlet does n't convince you that people are trying to get to germany and company ... idk how to help you understand, 
  lol where do you recommend i get my news on the migration crisis then ? 
  afaik yeah there are a lot of people that were internally displaced and moved to assad strongholds but do you think germany is going to reject their asylum applications due to them coming from the coast ? 
  you asked for sources and i told you where you could find them , not telling you to take everything you read in the comments to heart, 
  yeah this sub check the front page right now, 
  exactly , german insular communites moving back to germany is n't really comparable to today 's situation, 
   i mean , the people that complain about the country , the politicians and corruption are the same ones that were employed by their cousins in various institutions and then proceed to ` go to business trips ' , ` buy office equipment ' ( aka stealing from the country . ), 
  seeing serbia rid itself of mafia and corruption is my dream . 
  if it ever happens i can die happy . 
  do n't remember it was a while ago , might have been this sub why though ? 
  is there something wrong with the phrase ? 
  i could have said `` word that 's used to dismiss someone 's opinions without really discussing '' or non-central fallacy just as much but i thought of that phrase first, 
  nah why read it somewhere and thought it was an interesting concept . 
   i do n't really watch tv , that 's why i prefer blue over black ah , understandable , but you could lurk on this sub for a few days and you 'll see sources for every single thing i mentioned . 
  googling them will show a wealth of info too i 'm not lying man, 
   other posters from eu probably wo n't understand us , but since ever kosovo thing started , whatever wrong or was perceived wrong we did was met with huge repercussions so now we can not defend our own country 's interests . 
  word man i 've been thinking a lot about serbia 's future , and we 're really in a checkmate so to speak . 
  a future with russia seems hopeless , but we 'll always be pawns in europe ( and we 'll have to be friendly with america , and you know how much serbia likes america ... ) , and that union does n't seem like it 's as solid nowadays ( what with internal rifts revealing the incredibly flimsy nature of eu bureaucracy , and uk threatening to leave , etc. ), 
  as it was before . 
  people are sick of being poor for 20 straight years , especially when they know how good it * can * be ( glorious yugoslavia u know ) . 
   i love the irony where would that be ? 
  i ca n't make out if you 're making a jab at me or something else haha, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clich%c3%a9#thought-terminating_clich.c3.a9 basically a dirty rhetorical trick, 
  yeah we 're heeding the eu 's words because we have something to prove , unlike croatia and hungary, 
   serbia received a bunch of fire-trucks from russia . 
  most were promptly moved to its southern border . 
  source ? 
  crazy if true, 
  i usually humor these requests but i 'm on mobile and i literally can not believe that you 've not seen these things . 
  they 've been in the media 24/7 for the past 2 months you can google eurostat statistics , you could watch videos of border situations in hungary and croatia and their arrival in the promised land of germany why is hungary making a border ? 
  because they want to go through hungary to get to germany . 
  serbia is safe !, 
  we 're offering asylum to those who ask , but * none * ask . 
  why were so many migrants trying to pass thru the channel tunnel ? 
  is france a war zone ? 
  if you even have a cursory interest in this you 've already seen countless sources for all these things . 
  literally turn on the telly or go on france24 or reuters or something it 's all there, 
   yes , what 's yours ? 
  the fact that they are n't applying for asylum in greece , macedonia , serbia , croatia , hungary , or even austria . 
  some are even going all the way to sweden , and * complaining * when they get settled up north and not in malmo or something . 
  you think nord-pas-de-calais is a warzone ? 
  why the fuck were they so desperate to get to the uk , if not simply shopping for the best country to apply for asylum in . 
  the danger is * far * behind them at any of those points , they 're just people who did n't have the luck of being born in europe , and want to better themselves economically . 
  that 's a great desire and all but you do n't get to guilt-trip europe into seeing all of them as people that have just escaped death and famine a few minutes ago . 
  it 's on the news * every single day * just watch it you 'll have all the sources you need, 
   germany will benefit from adding these people to the workforce ; plain and simple it 's an investment . 
  the indigenous populations of these european countries are all aged and shrinking ( or at very least stagnant ) . 
  the bourgeoisie in germany will benefit from it . 
  ask the german working class whether they agree and you 'll get a * resounding * no . 
  why do you think the left is losing its worker votes to anti-immigrant parties all across europe ? 
  indigenous europeans need to start making more babies and stamp out the capitalist vultures that are responsible for the war in syria and the subsequent refugee crisis . 
   you have no choice . 
  statements like this wo n't make it better back an animal into a corner and it 'll bite harder than you 've ever thought it could  after the resultant pressure turns the large refugee camps in the middle east into extensions of the war zone they were fleeing thank you for acknowledging the reality of what could happen if we let everyone come in at least, 
   and so what if people call you racist ? 
  it 's a thought-terminating clich\u00e9 and eliminates any chance you may have of being seen as a `` legitimate '' position . 
  try deporting 8 000 angry migrants a day, 
  the point i 'm trying to make is that if the mainstream media wanted to push that angle , there 's already a ton of videos of migrants behaving badly . 
   what i would do is pay turkey ( or another poor country ) money to take in asylum seekers the risk of creating a perverse incentive seems to high for this to be a viable option . 
  agree entirely with the rest of your points . 
  i do n't understand why syrians are n't applying for eu asylum in places where they 're already safe ( albeit not as rich as europe ) . 
  is a system not in place ? 
  do embassies not allow it ? 
  oh absolutely !, 
  serbia will do as the eu tells her to , the trick is getting populist merkel ( and juncker ) to make a ( gasp ) unpopular decision and firmly state that this shit can not stand , that it undermines the rule of law and the entire eu , and support hungary in its effort to protect schengen borders, 
  slovenian littoral best littoral, 
  true , that 's the next step , but if they start losing passports and saying they sailed to lesbos from syria ... what do you do ? 
   at what stage do they close their own border with macedonia ? 
  not likely , our pm is very pro-eu and thus listens carefully to the recommendations merkel and juncker give us, 
  when they 'll be passing through muslim parts it might make for interesting interactions between migrants and locals, 
  you 'd need to get the media to push that video/image 24/7 for a while in order to create a mass reaction ( like the drowned child event ) good luck getting a bunch of leftist journalists to do that, 
  greece ca n't close its coast serbia probably wo n't do because our current gov ' t loves to the eu i think it 's more plausible for the migrants to start walking through bosnia or romania to bypass protected borders ( or even start sailing to italy ), 
  i 'm not equating it , but i am not blind and neither is anybody who makes comments about the culture of the roma community . 
  ethnic groups correlate extremely closely with cultures . 
  would you prefer it if i said `` rome culture is dysfunctional '' ? 
  because that 's what i meant . 
  how fortified is the border ?
