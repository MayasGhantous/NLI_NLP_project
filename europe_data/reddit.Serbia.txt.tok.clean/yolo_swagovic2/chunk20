  credible news source, 
  well those who do n't like serbia can deal with it, 
  troll god, 
  murcia, 
  not sure where people are getting this idea either, 
  never said yugoslavia was serbia i just showed that our borders became part of yugoslavia , you made that claim that serbia is yugoslavia not me . 
  serbia * [ 1918 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/kingdom_of_serbia_%281914%29.svg/450px-kingdom_of_serbia_%281914%29.svg.png ) * [ 1918 later ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/kingdom_of_yugoslavia_1930.svg/450px-kingdom_of_yugoslavia_1930.svg.png ) * [ 1941 nazi occupied ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/serbia_1942.svg/450px-serbia_1942.svg.png ) * [ 1945-1991 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/razbijanje_sfrj.gif/758px-razbijanje_sfrj.gif ) * [ 1992 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/serbia_and_montenegro_%281992-2006%29.png ) * [ 2006 ] ( https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gctgsx5uozafve7sej8vfxgx20bpiufwaqowrewy3uvrvd3iycab ) * [ 2008-2015 depending on how you look at it ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/europe-serbia.svg/800px-europe-serbia.svg.png ) we still here doeeeeeeee, 
  no cellphone camera is small enough, 
  yeah would have been a dope country m8000, 
  stop tryna show off your swags, 
  what an odd place to put 100 billion barrels m8000, 
  ahhh germany in 1939 , lol jk, 
  you mean rhodesia, 
   hundreds of years of conquest and opression is not bad at all . 
  that wasnt the austrians , that was the turks m80, 
  would make sense, 
  who would recognize it though ? 
  quiet, 
  you just want everything handed to you , dont ya, 
  yeee agreed , deff would have been nice thats for sure, 
  well territory doesnt = larger population . 
  whereas bosniaks make up 40 % of the population they 're probably more condensed . 
  they make up the majority in urban centres like sarajevo where the population is like 600,000 . 
  serbs are more spread out and their largest city in rs , banja luka is barely 200,000 . 
  it makes sense when you think about it really . 
  haha thanks, 
  well rs is 49 % of the land mass so thats what i mean by half derp, 
  holy fuck if she was fired in russia because of her support for ukrainian kiev government people would be calling this the return of the soviet union . 
  have there been atrocities committed against russian ukrainians ? 
  can anyone confirm this because i 've heard nothing about it ? 
  haha i think this was posted before and the best comment was `` fight to the last american '', 
  i hate that man so damn much, 
  probably true i onno, 
  montenegro , well not province but lost the union i guess, 
  right cause so much athletic talent comes out of kosovo ...  being a partially recognized state has it 's many economical disadvantages . 
  what about the billions in aid dollars you were promised ... oh right no one delivered . 
  seems like youve awoken from the dream . 
  no one said your independence was going to be easy and we never agreed to recognize you so dont blame it on serbia . 
  you made your bed . 
   what has serbia for example done in 7 years ? 
  well we 've rebuilt since the 99 ' bombings mostly . 
  we 've gotten a major investment from fiat in serbia , gotten ethiad airways to buy out our aging airline . 
  so there are some major investemnts in a former international pariah . 
  captured karadzic and mladic and gave everyone wanted by the hague and completely worked with the tribunal . 
  reached tennis and basketball fame . 
  so not much . 
   if i remember correctly your countrymen are leaving serbia in thousands too yeah by the thousands not by tens of thousands . 
  also theyre doing it through legal means and not by rampaging at the border like mexicans in california . 
  i think that was a running gag or joke from that movie . 
  some retards actually believed it haha, 
  oh god here we go again ... 
  romanian education system here folks, 
  in a few years ? 
  man its been 7 years since independence and not much has changed . 
  your countrymen are leaving kosovo by the tens of thousands and there isnt even a war !, 
  can confirm, 
  would make sense , yes but what about all the yugoslav state owned assets in kosovo ? 
  who takes those ?? 
  makes sense to me, 
  look at the facts yourself then, 
  i 'd be happy with that ye, 
  aside from the obvious , boris tadic . 
  the man loses 2 provinces in less then a decade . 
  i mean how incompetent can you get . 
  yeah but republicans are being especially uncooperative with him . 
  i mean did n't the republicans shut down the entire federal government over one of his passed initiatives lol ? 
  srbo srboljub ? 
   manage foreign policies they ca n't even handle domestic ones lol, 
  depends on the person really, 
  dodik mentions it all the time, 
  nothing we 're perfect lol jk, 
  i hope not but there are massive saudi mosques in bosnia and nothing good ever comes out of saudi money ... 
  i wonder that myself tbh, 
  no its a poor place and any other place their minorities touch , ie kosovo , also become poor . 
  thatssssss not good ... 
  no ones saying anything about touching the bih federation . 
  no of course not and you are right hooligans do n't represent a country . 
  but i 'm curious as to why there is anti-sometimes among bosniaks . 
  when i went to sarajevo this past summer there were anti-israel flyers everywhere around the city . 
  curious as to where all this comes from . 
  ca n't say i 'm surprised really . 
  but if they do achieve this then we get half of bosnia . 
  only fair really ...
