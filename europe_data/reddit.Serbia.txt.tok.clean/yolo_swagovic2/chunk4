   victorian britain 200 years ago sure whatever but for this shit to still be happening today ... 
  sure but its unfair to impsoe such high interest rates on these states . 
  in that way they cant ever hope to pay off their actual loans and can only manage to pay off the interest rates . 
  in some cases these countries have actually paid off their loans but because of the ridiculously high interest rates they havnt actually been able to pay off the lump sum , just the interest every month . 
  oh thats what that is, 
  yeah but africa mannnn , theyve basically been in a complete state of anarchy since independence . 
  and besides most african states have paid back their loans but havnt been able to pay it off completely due to the ridicilous interest rates applied onto them , derp . 
  this is really upsetting, 
  penagoneee, 
  maybe because ukraine is on the verge of complete collapse ? 
  by cutting off their clit ? 
  fucks wrong with muslims ???
