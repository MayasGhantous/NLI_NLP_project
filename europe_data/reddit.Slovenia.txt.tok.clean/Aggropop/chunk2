  it 's a self imposed limitation . 
  well , locally we did go through a little [ war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ten-day_war ) in 91 , but the 90s truly were a time of global optimism . 
  there 's no comparison with the post-9 / 11-post-2008-clustefuck era . 
  yeah , the 90s were awesome . 
  i think you are making a distinction where none exists . 
  a political party is nothing without voters . 
  at the very least there is something about the fpo that attracts right-wing extremists , that in and of itself should be a huge warning sign , particularly in a country that is so closely tied to the origin of modern fascism . 
  and by making excuses for the inexcusable you are allowing them to continue their practices . 
  they ( the party ) can always fall back to the old `` was n't us , just some random hooligan '' defense , for as long as you let them get away with it . 
  and let me remind people , that this rise of fpo mirrors quite closely how the nsdap rose to power . 
  they were considered outsiders with no real chance in politics , but they quickly grew ( completely democratically btw , nsdap legitimately won the 1932 federal elections ) until they could block the german parliament from doing any real work . 
  after that , von hindenburg had no choice but to make hitler chancellor . 
  after that ... 
  i never said they were equal , but they definitely are related . 
  and as far as `` real '' fascism is concerned , burning signs felt pretty goddamn real , and it definitely reminded people of times when a ** lot ** more stuff went up in flames because it was slovenian ( or slavic ) , not just signs . 
  perhaps i should remind readers that nazi oppression in slovenia started out in much the same way : by banning public use of the slovenian language and any display of slovenian national imagery ( signs , flags , symbols , place names , personal names ... ) so i ask you to make up your mind . 
  does the fp\u00d6 matter ( as you seem to imply by saying you protested against it ) or does n't it ( since you said it 's just `` a few idiots '' ) ? 
  pretending things do n't matter wo n't make things not matter . 
  the kind of mentality you are showing is exactly what allows toxic ideologies to take hold . 
  look , if you want to flail at straw men , fine , go ahead . 
  reasonable people are just trying to prevent a greater tragedy . 
  i remember that time , it was when haider supporters repeatedly burned down slovenian language signs in bilingual areas and assaulted journalists when they came to investigate . 
  nice . 
  ( for the uninformed : slovenians are n't even migrants in austria , instead a small minority that has been there for centuries ) really surprised you havent heard of [ jo cox ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/18/jo-cox-mp-shot-thomas-mair-arrives-at-court-following-murder-cha/ ), 
  cry me a referendum . 
  democracy is not an excuse to deny reality . 
  you say that , but there are people literally being killed in broad daylight on behalf of far-right policies . 
  we are dangerously close to repeating past mistakes , the closest we 've ever been since the 30s . 
  tl ; dr : you ca n't make me eat my greens , it 's undemocratic . 
  that 's like saying : i 'm gon na burn down my garage , just to see how my neighbors react . 
  i 'm not too keen on any of those things either , but a europe run by the far right ... because things went so fantastically the last time that was tried . 
  uhhh , what ? 
  because actions have consequences , and the consequences of this referendum could be far reaching , going well beyond british borders . 
  i really do n't see much of hong-kong or singapore outside of hong-kong and singapore respectively . 
  the same could be said for timur , genghis khan and attila , that does n't make any of them european . 
  i do n't think it matters how deep an occupation goes , geographically . 
  the british did n't become more asian as they occupied more of asia . 
  no , it 's cultural . 
  a director of one of their ministries had a virtually identical setup outside his home . 
  he also had the largest 4k screen i 've ever seen , a vertu phone and a brand new top of the line range rover . 
  i take it you have n't been to any predominantly muslim countries ? 
  [ this ] ( https://insideotherplaces.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/p1010518.jpg ) is a typical toilet in azerbaijan . 
  not the worst by a long stretch since the walls are solid and the ground is n't shitmud . 
  you can be damn sure everyone who uses it washes their hands . 
  muslim countries do n't have western toilets with bowls and toilet paper . 
  you are expected to use a shower ( or bowl of water ) , your hand and a towel ( if you 're really lucky ) 2 . 
  middle eastern cuisine often includes dishes that are eaten by hand , no cutlery . 
  if you put 1 and 2 together , you bet they wash their hands . 
  nobody wants freaking cholera . 
  and thank fuck for tp . 
  yeah , i 'm arguing against it . 
  you have to argue your own point . 
  and definitions exist for a reason : it 's so people ca n't go around and interpret them however they like , like you 're doing . 
  no , experience does not . 
  the environment does . 
  if a certain gene makes you more adapted to your environment , you will have a greater chance of surviving long enough to mate and pass on your genes to the next generation . 
  this is called natural selection . 
  i encourage you to check that wiki link , you are clearly confused . 
  that 's not how evolution/heredity works either . 
  experience does n't affect the dna of a being and so ca n't be passed down through generations . 
  and i 'm not [ strawmanning ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/straw_man ) you , i 'm making you look like a fool . 
  stop being a fool . 
  that 's not how evolution works . 
  nothing is the `` result '' of evolution , evolution is an ongoing unguided process , things change over time , but they do n't `` graduate '' into something more . 
  instinct is still just trial and error , mostly error . 
  instinct is not magic !, 
  if i 'm unaware of something and ca n't even imagine it then i ca n't take it into account and neither can my instinct !, 
  opposition to immigration based on personal feelings ** is ** irrational , by definition . 
  there are plenty of reasonable reasons to oppose migration though , and plenty of people have warned that destabilizing the middle east would result in a humanitarian crisis that europe will ultimately have to sort out , myself included . 
  i personally protested against the 2004 invasion of iraq on this basis , but nobody cared at the time . 
  people were angry and ready to lash out , reason did n't come into it at any point . 
  instinct is incapable of taking consequences into account , any consequence will be unintended . 
  the current crisis is the unintended result of overly emotional politicians and an angry , irrational populace . 
  i do n't think letting them repeat their mistake is a step forward . 
  such as ? 
  mind you , we are talking about politics here . 
  evolution and natural selection have nothing to do with whether an action is rational or not . 
  rational ( in this context ) is not the opposite of random , its the opposite of thoughtless . 
  a stopped clock may or may not be correct , depending on the situation . 
  the word rational means to apply logic and critical thinking , to analyze a situation beyond the obvious . 
  instinct is the first natural response , it does n't involve reason or thinking at all . 
  because of this instinct ** can not ** be rational . 
  if the two result in the same action it is purely by chance , not because of instincts qualities . 
  are you implying that instincts are rational ? 
  because they 're not , quite the opposite . 
  or are you confusing '' [ rational ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/rational ) '' and '' [ rationale ] ( http://www.dictionary.com/browse/rational ) '' ? 
  true , but i do n't see the eu agreeing to free movement of capital , but not people . 
  it would go against everything the eu stands for and it would be harmful to eu economies . 
  no deal would be the preferred outcome in that case . 
  ceta was passed with a razor thin margin and plenty of people are still pissed over it . 
  v2 .0 has no chance . 
  brexit does n't guarantee an end to fom , though . 
  i think it 's very likely that it will be reinstated as part of a free trade deal , the eu is certainly going to push for that . 
  which will leave you just as `` vulnerable '' , but with less leverage . 
  fom is non-negotiable , that should be obvious to anyone . 
  might as well ask the eu to declare war on argentina . 
  the amount of lies and misrepresentations that were circulated to support brexit is staggering . 
  since it was done intentionally with a specific goal in mind , i think `` dishonest '' is putting it pretty mildly . 
  regarding honor , i would point you towards the hornets story . 
  do you think the person who poked is acting honorably ?
