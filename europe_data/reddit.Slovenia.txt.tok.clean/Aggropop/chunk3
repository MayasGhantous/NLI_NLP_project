  feel free to replace `` honorably '' with `` morally '' , if that helps . 
  i really did n't expect much from you , it 's not as if this is the first time you 've had issues with the eu . 
  previously these things were negotiated out , the eu gave the uk leeway on some pet project and the uk in return stopped obstructing eu processes . 
  i certainly did n't expect you to react so recklessly . 
  i never said you should n't be allowed to leave , but i do think your exit was dishonest and dishonorable . 
  there 's a hornet 's nest in your neighborhood . 
  everyone knows it 's been a pain in the ass for as long as it 's been there , but someone had to go and poke it ( because their bigger brother said to ) . 
  now there 's hornets all over the place , but the person who did the poking is washing their hands and telling everyone else to deal with it , because otherwise they might be inconvenienced . 
  even a voluntary agreement has weight and you are now reneging . 
  the fact that 1 euro member ( above all others ) spent the better part of a decade destabilizing the middle east is a joke . 
  that same country now refuses to acknowledge any responsibility and is using the cost of the consequences as an excuse to wash its hands of the whole matter . 
  because you contributed and are still contributing to the situation being what it is . 
  the club is ** ours ** , if it is failing as you say , it is with britain included . 
  like it or not . 
  and if it is failing , how is letting everyone else in the club deal with the fallout not a stab in the back ? 
  obviously it is n't working if its breeding murderers . 
  why do you think that is so ? 
  did you intend to paint swiss kids as murderers in the making , or was that accidental ? 
  if not , it makes your other points completely moot , because no gun law could possibly be as damaging as having a population ready ( and just waiting for the right equipment ) to start murdering each other . 
  are you saying current gun owners would be ok with their ( legal atm ) guns going onto the black market ? 
  because that does n't sound very responsible . 
  maybe they should n't have had guns in the first place . 
   just because i write some text that nobody ever said , does not make it any less relevent . 
  that is literally exactly what it does . 
  your fantasy is not as good as someone elses facts , regardless of how strongly you believe in it . 
   women and the west at large ... did i say that ? 
  or is that you projecting ? 
  she went to their residence of her own volition . 
  not all women , not all the west , just her . 
  because she ** wanted ** to . 
  you are an opinionated and ignorant fool . 
  you have a superiority complex that is not backed up by your behavior . 
  you exhibit none of the virtues you claim to support , and still expect others , who are not bound in any way to your position , to live up to your standards . 
  get over yourself . 
  you are not the standard up to which others should measure themselves . 
  if you insist on claiming that you are some superior authority i expect you to behave as such . 
  until you are beyond reproach in this matter , i have no more words to waste on you . 
  it 's a barely cogent rant , quoted ravings included . 
  calling it verbal diarrhoea would be an understatement . 
  that 's exactly how a reasonable person would interpret willingness to show respect . 
  not something i expect you to understand . 
  i 'm rubber you 're glue ? 
  truly the words of a well travelled and cultured individual with years of experience . 
  pathetic . 
  clearly we 're not , since she did n't wear anything she did n't want to . 
  we 're not entitled to their time if we do n't respect their customs , like it or not . 
  no shoes , no shirt , no service ring a bell , world traveller ? 
  are you even listening to yourself ? 
  she was meeting the grand mufti , not some oil baron . 
  do you think the pope discuses italian parmezan cheese exports too ? 
  also , did you mean donald rumsfeld ? 
  pretty silly mistake for a towering intellect like yourself . 
  i find it particularly ironic that you call her `` broad '' too . 
  all it took for you to descend to , as you call it , barbarism , is a reddit comment . 
  wall of text crits for 400 damage . 
  nobody is that pompous outside of reddit . 
  not even religious officials . 
  religious property ? 
  what the hell are you smoking ? 
  if i agree to follow someone else 's rules , i do n't become their property . 
  throwing around words like `` barbaric '' makes you look like a tool , clearly you have no idea what actual barbarity looks like . 
  i would suggest you visit other countries to get some perspective , but i suspect you would have trouble finding any that live up to your lofty standards . 
  we made these rules ** for ourselves ** . 
  they are under no obligation to follow them . 
  you are nauseated by the act of befriending an enemy ? 
  do i really need to explain to you how fucked up that is ? 
  or are you just trying to portray yourself as a fairy tale villain ? 
  it 's not that difficult of a judgment call . 
  is the diplomatic objective more important , or are the diplomat 's personal feelings more important ? 
  i think putting on a veil for a few hours is pretty trivial . 
  also , do you think a diplomat that refuses to give courtesy is going to be taken seriously ? 
  how do you negotiate concessions ( for example ) with someone in that mind set ? 
  that 's awesome , love it . 
   europe ... `` europe '' has only had a position as a whole for a few decades . 
  before that , influence was divided among many nations who were at war with each other most of the time . 
   today ... yeah , morals are a bitch . 
  that 's fine , and you are free to take that position when you run for office . 
  the thing about diplomacy is that little concessions can go a long way to building a better relationship , and we will be in a far better position to influence their behavior when we are on friendly terms . 
  i get what you 're saying , but hijabs technically are n't clerical vestments ( what priests wear ) , they 're just traditional . 
  the koran does n't specify what clothes exactly women should wear , only that they should cover themselves ( this is also why there is disagreement over the degree of coverage : hijab/burqa/etc ) . 
  it 's not as if this is unique to saudi arabia , virtually all politicians have to give lip service to the majority religion in their country , or they would alienate a huge voter block . 
  imagine what it would take to get an openly atheist person elected president in the us for example . 
  the civil war happened 10 years after the plant was completed and it was n't between croats and slovenes anyway . 
  technology is definitely an issue , the adriatic is far deeper overall than the skagerrak and the line would have to make much longer undersea hops . 
  it could be done , but it 's not a ready made solution as some are implying . 
  it is also very hard to justify , since an overland alternative is possible . 
  that is not the case in the baltic . 
  politics would be a much bigger problem though , that 's for sure . 
  this is the balkans we 're talking about . 
  it 's hilarious that you think an undersea cable is in any way feasible . 
  power plants are situated near large consumers for a reason . 
  a totally reasonable and level headed response . 
  well done . 
  this law bothers me deeply . 
  first , it implies that turings sentence was just , since pardons can only be given to those proven guilty . 
  a better option would be an annulment or just a simple apology . 
  secondly , it 's disgustingly pandering . 
  the only people affected by this law are dead , they literally could n't care less . 
  if you want to do something nice for the lgbt community , why not start with the ones that are still alive ? 
  and finally , it smells a whole lot like whitewashing .
