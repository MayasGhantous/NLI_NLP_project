  britain has a bloody and gruesome past , people would do well to learn from it . 
  maybe next time they can issue a pardon for the thousands of people executed for participating in rebellions against british colonial rule . 
  before the euro , slovenia had tolar as it 's currency . 
  the smallest denomination bank note was 10 tolar , or roughly 4 euro cents . 
  it was n't very useful other than to buy candy , but i remember playing with those notes as a child and liking them a lot . 
  basically it was like fake monopoly money , but it could theoretically buy you real candy . 
  a 100 stack of them looked pretty serious too and was n't hard to collect even for a child . 
  when i worked at a kids summer camp more recently , we also used 1 , 2 and 5 cent coins as tokens for the kids to collect by participating in activities . 
  the smart kids started trading for them and could by themselves a nice sugary treat if they stuck to it . 
  those courts would not be part of the regular judiciary of any country , but would be under the purview of one of the many super-national legal systems , like the icc or the lcia . 
  those courts have a long history of favoring big players to the detriment of small countries ( the us , for example , has never lost a case in either court ) , so it 's no surprise that most small eu countries are against any agreement that pushes courts like those . 
  hate to break your bubble , but lutetia ( the predecessor of paris ) was a roman settlement . 
  firebomb anchorage in the fall and watch as the population starves during the winter . 
   ... except the opportunity to demonstrate to them which they will refuse ( which is their right ) if it happens to come up . 
  life is n't a philosophical debate and every day lives wo n't be improved by applying scientifically rigorous methods . 
  if i say i had a sandwich on wednesday , i should n't need to back that up by going back all the way to fist principles . 
  and the holocaust is far less disputed than my lunch . 
   warzones , mobsters and oligarchs 2 of the 3 are present in the kremlin . 
  makes sense that reporting on the kremlin would be about two thirds as lethal . 
  it 's a war crime according to the geneva convention , how is that not our problem ? 
   their citizens lol , if anyone could determine with certainty what citizenship they have the problem would n't even exist . 
  not to mention that exiling people to a freshly war torn country is a big no-no . 
  right , as if the government was trying to immigrate to europe . 
  it 's the afghani people that are coming over , and starting another war would only make them want to leave more . 
  do you want to destabilize the country and create more refugees ? 
  because that 's how you destabilize a country and create more refugees . 
  no way to know for sure unless the make and model of bus are identified , though pneumatic doors are ( apparently , i do n't actually work with buses ) more common because all buses already have an air compressor built in to power the air brakes . 
  the method of operation is basically the same in either case and both systems would need a manual release valve for emergencies . 
  the doors are hydraulically operated and hydraulic fluid is still a liquid , so cock is perfectly accurate . 
  the control in question is just a valve that releases pressure from the piston , allowing the doors to be opened . 
  ** noun ** [ cock ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cock ) ( plural cocks ) a valve or tap for controlling flow in plumbing . 
  i read it , did a quick once-over of the www.total-croatia-news.com host , just to make sure it 's not some viral aggregator , even read their website ( https://meridda.com ) before posting . 
  it 's a `` stress measuring '' bracelet which uses galvanic skin response ( a notoriously unreliable and inaccurate measurement technology with a history of abuse by unscrupulous peddlers of panacea ) and a diet/exercise app . 
  edit : a word, 
  maybe i missed something , care to enlighten me ? 
  tl ; dr : it 's a glorified mood ring . 
  how this got awards is beyond me . 
  official figures are 7k to 12k , in a country of 2 million . 
  a lot of those wo n't be `` practicing '' roma , though they still identify as roma . 
  the majority of them are perfectly well-adjusted and basically indistinguishable . 
  hell , one of our most famous pop-singers is roma . 
  you have to go outside the big cities to get the `` authentic '' roma experience too . 
  i live in ljubljana , and rarely see any of them here . 
  roma story time : me and my friend were on our way home from a camping trip , fairly late at night ( around 10pm ) , driving past a roma village , when suddenly a dog appeared from the bushes just ahead of the car . 
  my friend hit the brakes hard but could n't stop in time . 
  the weird thing was that the dog did n't walk or run in front by accident , it was looking straight at us and it seemed like it was trying to stay off the road , but something was pushing it . 
  when my friend reversed the car a few feet , i noticed a wire going from the dogs collar towards the nearest house in the village . 
  seconds later a bunch of roma appeared from where the wire was leading and started shouting at us for killing `` their kids '' dog , that we need to get out and pay for it , etc. 
  they must have intentionally pulled the dog onto the road . 
  they were coming towards the car , so my friend floored it , but the car still got hit by rocks as we drove away . 
  we got out fine , but the car had a few dents and a smashed rear window ( all covered by insurance ) . 
  this is n't an isolated case btw , i know quite a few people who have similar stories . 
  that 's just `` their way '' . 
  we tried building them proper houses , but they just completely destroy them in the span of a year . 
  they sell any wiring , pipes , roofing they can and let their animals sleep inside . 
  houses that had every modern convenience turn into uninhabitable shells , with no running water , power or basic sanitation . 
  how are you supposed to help people like that ? 
  i wo n't even start with how many times they 've tried to scam me , or how many times my friend was assaulted by them ( verbally and physically ) when literally all he wanted to do was help them . 
  ( he 's a social worker employed by our governments roma outreach agency , and has a degree in `` working with special needs children '' ( translation ?? ) . ), 
  pilatus , not pilates . 
  would be nice if we could defend our airspace with second rate yoga . 
  i shudder to think about what melania could come up with . 
  she just might be the least representative slovenian out there . 
  only if the stuff they import is actually from the eu . 
  anyone got numbers on that ? 
  neither were `` crises '' in a russian context before putin got involved , so yes , he did instigate them as russian crises . 
  the economic and social issues having no effect still is n't explained either . 
  true . 
  but while his popularity in the past can be explained with him actually living up to his promises of a wealthier , stable russia , his continuing ( and even rising ) popularity as russia stagnates is more mysterious . 
  because they wanted to build weapons . 
  ever heard of the hezbollah ? 
  they are funded by iran and are all over the place . 
  [ no , i meant iran . 
  we are n't telling them what to do in their country , just saying that we generally do n't like to trade with people who mistreat their own population . 
  sorry , but 300.000 barrels of deficit trump any kind of `` could be `` s . if you wan na back up your claim i await that gladly . 
  nuclear program 2 . it 's in a de-facto state of war with israel for the last 40 years . 
  3 . yes , the kurds , with whom it is currently at war . 
  also lgbt , liberals and women . 
  you 're right , i forgot about that . 
  they export [ 282.000 barrels ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gr.html ) which only leaves them with a deficit of about 220.000 per day . 
  and they also import another 80.000 barrels of refined petroleum per day . 
  i ca n't be sure , you clearly live in a different reality than i do , perhaps there are multiple obamas in yours . 
  i mean , unemployment was 10 % when he took office and is 5 % now , so for you to be correct reality must clearly be wrong . 
  math ? 
  500000  8000 therefore exporting oil wo n't help ? 
  what makes you think the eu wants to bomb iran ? 
  and what makes you think the eu is capable of bombing anyone ? 
  and it uses about 500.000 barrels per day , 496.000 of which have to be imported . 
  is that a yes ? 
  it ** is ** a weakness for a politician . 
  but people did n't vote for a politician , they voted for a reality tv host . 
  and those do n't have to worry about little things like integrity or consistency . 
  when you degrade an election to a shouting match , the shoutiest person wins . 
  unfortunately the reality of the situation is that the us has a gang problem and it makes perfect sense to take that into account when discussing gun laws . 
  i wish it was only `` normal '' people who want guns , but at least in slovenia , the only people you hear advocating for less gun control are the prepper-survivalist conspiracy theorists and neo-nazis . 
  i 'm fine with not having a gun if it means they do n't get to have one either . 
  i think all of those fall comfortably under `` false predictions '' and not outright , verifiable-at-the-time , lies . 
  except for the armageddon thing , everyone knows that can only take place in megiddo , israel .
