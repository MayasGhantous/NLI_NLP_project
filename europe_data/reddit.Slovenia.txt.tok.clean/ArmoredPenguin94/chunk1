i will for the regions i 've never been : molise well obviously , it does n't exist . 
  its only racist if you miss the point entirely . 
  its meant to make fun of everyone and everything with no qualms about it being inappropriate . 
  it comes from krautchan afterall . 
  you have no idea what a traffic jam is unless you 've done the strunjan - piran road in summer . 
  there needs to be a decent alternative road made because shit is just ridiculous . 
  considering most of the traffic is causing by the germans , austrians & italians driving to croatia , if more of those tourists actually stuck around it would be better . 
  this way they do n't just buy the vignette and that 's their only interaction with our economy . 
  basically all slovenian news outlets use it as a source . 
  i 'll have you know we put all three of our soldiers on high alert after this vile act against our serbian brothers . 
  winning the special olympics still counts as winning , right ? 
  there 's also a small amount of oil in prekmurje iirc , although its unlikely it has much of an impact on that  oil : $ 1.4 billion ( 5.3 % ), 
  chinese taipei *, 
  there 's a crapton of ex-yu people there and the locals love \u0107evapi & la\u0161ko pivo . 
  its very balkan . 
   people who do n't want to work  montenegro checks out, 
  good luck communicating with your weird russian-polish mix ( which are very different so idk how it would even sound like ) with anyone in the south slav language group . 
  aside from some basic words that are pretty much the same across all slavic languages , you would n't be able to go far . 
  i 've never seen it spelt `` giudo '' . 
  always judo . 
  case in point : http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/topnews/2016/08/07/rio-judo-basile-doro.-e-n.200-italia_24a277a2-1d24-47f3-b750-b95c7112890b.html, 
  [ piran ] ( http://www.portoroz.si/si/imagelib/12-land/default/images/piran/piranska_modrina.jpg ) surely deserves a mention , for the sake of variety if not anything else . 
  ethnically ? 
  sure , could be . 
  but he still plays for your national team . 
  played for koper some years ago . 
  was pretty good . 
  also probably only estonian we know . 
  how could we ignore you . 
  you ( & kosovars ) are like our go-to guys for construction work or bakeries . 
  too many references no one knows outside for it not to be . 
  montenegro thing is most likely intentionally backwards . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/top_gear_ ( 2002_tv_series ), 
   not that i think its like you people skipped reading comprehension classes, 
  only if they go in the mountains, 
  i 'm sorry , but did we read/watch the same sources ? 
   http://4d.rtvslo.si/arhiv/tednik/174457467 in this we see a bunch of albanian students learning and speaking ( not amazingly , but one of the kids speaking has only been there a year ) slovenian , we see a bunch of older albanians speaking close to perfect ( if not perfect ) slovenian and one of them even won an award for her volunteer work . 
  there 's even a pie chart at 5:17 that shows the foreign population of velenje being two thirds bosnian . 
  ( kosovo just on 5 % ) hell this piece of news is the perfect counter-argument to your point . 
  we see them integrating , helping others integrate , or already integrated . 
   http://www.mnz.gov.si/si/novinarsko_sredisce/novica/browse/1/article/12208/10011/  http://www.vlada.si/fileadmin/dokumenti/si/projekti/2015/begunci/aktivno_za_strpnost_publikacija.pdf these are government publications that tackle the `` how to help people integrate '' questions . 
  nothing about albanians causing problems . 
   http://www.rtvslo.si/zdravje/novice/zdravstvo-je-dobilo-novo-orodje-za-boljse-komuniciranje/412195 again , nothing about them causing problems . 
  just a piece of news about the doctors & co. getting some help with interacting with people from different cultures . 
   http://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/zahtevali-znanje-albanscine.html a piece of news on velenje 's hospital looking for a nurse & a doctor that speak albanian . 
  while you and others surely see something wrong with this , its a completely reasonable request given the kosovar community that is there . 
  in the video we saw them learning but this is not a fast process , and having multi-lingual medical staff is always a plus . 
  nobody is forcing the rest of the staff to speak it , mind . 
  oh , and it says nowhere that albanians are causing problems . 
   yes , slovenes first and have absolutely no issues curbing some people 's rights . 
  it 's our homeland , they have their own and are free to move out . 
  slovenes first huh ? 
  what about our ethnic minorities ? 
  the italians and the hungarians ? 
  do they not count ? 
  what about our fellow slovenes over the border ? 
  should they go back to `` our country '' just because its `` their homeland '' and the italians or austrians or hungarians or croatians decided that they do n't have rights anymore ? 
  so that is why they insist on getting sunburned . 
  red orkz go fastah, 
   do you even read the news ? 
  i work in a news station . 
  i do n't exactly go out and seek all the news there are when i 'm not at work , but when i am , i kinda ca n't escape it . 
  in the past three months i 've never seen a news article about albanians causing problem even close to making the evening news . 
  the most i 've heard was from a friend that works as an elementary school teacher that his \u0161iptar students are undisciplined and do n't want to learn . 
  this is an issue , sure . 
  but then i remember that half my class back in the day was lazy and unmotivated and not exactly disciplined either . 
  and the only two kosovars were actually quite chill . 
  kids gon na kid . 
  as for your articles , what issues do you see ? 
  its mostly about preparing medical personnel to deal with people that do not speak slovene ( and not only albanians , from what i could see , since it mentions the refugees ) . 
  which is a very good idea , you save lives this way . 
  our language is retardedly complex ( for a slavic one anyway ) and we ca n't expect newcomers to immediately speak it . 
  they 'll learn eventually because you ca n't really function in slovenia without speaking slovene ( or serbo-croatian , but that 's another story ) . 
   and there 's always the question , why do n't we improve the economic conditions for our people to have more kids instead of subsidizing albanian ones with our welfare system . 
  ah yes , the age-old question . 
  first slovenes , then the rest , right ? 
  not like they live in the same country and are citizens with the same rights ( or becoming , anyway ) , right ? 
  `` now '' ? 
  they 've been coming since the late '90s / early ' 00s . 
  most of the bakeries & kebab shops are owned and ran by them . 
  what problems are they causing ? 
  if you edit in under a minute or two , no * will ever show up . 
  not if they are the religious types . 
  then you just pay them in \u0107evapi and burek . 
  we did learn a little bit about it in elementary school and during schooltrips ( you ca n't go near the triglav and not talk about where the name is from and & the zlatorog/goldhord legend ) , but that 's about it . 
  vast majority of them yea . 
  although i 've come across a couple that were from albania proper . 
  our bakeries too . 
  and construction workers . 
  or , the shorter version : slavic tribes started migrating towards the west & the balkans only around the 6th century , a bit after ol' aleksandar makedonski 's exploits , 
  yes please , i 'd like to actually be able to cross the border in summer in a reasonable timeframe . 
   it 's in the ugliest place on earth what about biella ? 
  and sheep . 
  when i was in high school , the girls were the ones drinking more than everyone . 
  they would down those fruit-flavoured vodkas like it was apple juice . 
  and , well , eventually puke but that 's another story . 
  columbus landed in lisbon first * when returning from the first voyage , not italy . 
  later on they continued towards spain . 
  * in mainland europe , he landed at the azores before that . 
  city centre is pretty nice tbh , op just took the pic from a less nice part .
