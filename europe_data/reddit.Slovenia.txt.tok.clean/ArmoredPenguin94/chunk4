  i work as a tour guide and today i had a group from a cruise ship . 
  some bought wine/beer at a degustation event that was included in the tour , others asked me where to go shopping or what beer is the local one so they know what to order in the bar , etc. 
  you underestimate how much the average tourist loves to buy souvenirs , and you ca n't find those on the ship . 
  do n't forget the complaining about the neighbour !, 
  ( applies to both nation and the average janez ), 
  guess you are the second one then, 
  yes . 
  thanks to based spyleader and his broken english, 
  yogurt 500 years a slave etc. 
  the `` is this happens because we are from bulgaria ??? '', 
  neither , it does n't exist . 
  they just banished people to arezzo instead . 
  heresy, 
  nah , it makes perfect sense . 
  mussolini tried to fight the mafia a lot , and some fled to the us , reinforcing the ranks of the mob that was already present there . 
  plus this , as you said  allies actively cooperated with the mafia during the invasion of sicily . 
  and it 's much easier to portray an american as evil if you associate him with something the local population is very familiar with , in a negative way mainly . 
  by `` americans involved '' i meant with actual troops . 
  not any financial or other kind of support . 
  no , the french got sent home in 1954 . 
  vietnam war was after . 
  technically started a year after the geneva conference but the americans only really started to get involved in the '60s .

  look at this guy talking shit about barcola and its glorious `` pineta della scimmie '' in the summer you find trieste 's entrire working population there !, 
  during working hours no less . 
  please , / r/croatia has come up with better these past few days : [ exhibit 1 ] ( https://i.redd.it/9u45eb8pp76z.png ) [ exhibit 2 ] ( https://i.redd.it/jvyameujtd6z.png ) [ exhibit 3 ] ( https://i.redd.it/yfrlk32e5e6z.png ), 
   cerar really is so awkward especially considering his parents . 
  boots too big to fill maybe ? 
  aside from being ass at driving on the roads ` round here , nothing , no . 
  in the trash where it belongs probably . 
  or in the garden keeping the snails away . 
  there 's been a wildfire in croatia too these past few days , so the picture could also be from there . 
  eh , the yugowar videos are kinda funny because of the poor quality and general absurdity of some of the lyrics . 
  [ plus some songs are actually quite catchy . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4sqmnhzxji ) but yes , when you know what the lyrics mean they may be a bit off-putting to some . 
  muslim or not , you do n't separate a balkanian ( ? ), 
  from his/her drink . 
   ... is that joining a organization that could only carry advantages let 's not glorify the mafia/camorra / ` ndrangheta and all the rest please . 
  you are very likely to die there as well , you just do it for the bosses instead of a god . 
   \u0160tefan \u010cerneti\u0107 oh shit he 's one of ours . 
  probably from the kras/carso , people there have a reputation for being a bit * odd * they claim venice is rightfully theirs , for one !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ andtheywouldberight , sortof, 
  franco-provencal & occitan are recognized in italy as minority languages tho , by this law : legge 15 dicembre 1999 , n. 482 , art . 
  2 , comma 1 [ see here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_italy#legal_status ), 
  until you mention the m word . 
  from reuters 's feed :  man attacked police officer with hammer in paris , shot and injured by police officers - police source  paris police confirms officer injured by a man who was shot and injured by police officers, 
  burja does come in gusts as well ( forgot the word earlier ) so it 's not like we are constantly walking around with those winds . 
  not going to lie , walking around is pretty hard when the wind gets stronger . 
  and you do n't want to walk near the sea , but otherwise its just one step at a time . 
  [ or you can use a skateboard for some street windsurfing if you want ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xwv74endlm ), 
  bura/burja/bora is a wind that comes from the north-east , so in the context of these areas it will always blow towards the sea , not from it . 
  it is weak in summer and more common/stronger in winter . 
  kids get used to it . 
  now , when it goes over 170 km/h you probably let them stay home , but lower than that they can manage just fine . 
  note that it is n't a constant wind , but rather it comes in `` waves '' . 
  i ca n't remember how many times i walked to school with over 100 km/h burja outside . 
  you just get used to it . 
  you put stones on the roof so the wind does n't blow it away . 
  can also be seen in slovenia in our part of istria and the [ vipava valley ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xndvlakfzss ) . 
  kek . 
  the slovenian press agency does have an unfortunate acronym when paired with the slovenian domain name . 
  you must have missed our mentality of complaining about the state , hating on the neighbour , tax evasion , general `` omg i ca n't believe i have to do this '' attitude at work , incompetence , `` eh , bomo na roko pla\u010dali '' and so on . 
  it 's more common than you 'd think, 
  not really , half the country is balkan-lite . 
  half the time kp means : ajde brate idemo brzo * balkan music intensifies *, 
   it 's sea guys he recognised that slovenia has sea mission accomplished, 
  naturally , for every slovenian that thinks x , there is one that thinks y , usually his/her neighbour . 
  it 's the 3rd law of janezdynamics . 
  plus , you know , you got bigger beaches and cheaper stuff ( you know how we are when it comes to money ) , soo ... 
  it might not be much water , but [ pls ] ( http://kraji.eu/pictures/obalno_notranjska/obala/strunjan/mesecev_zaliv/dsc_8486_strunjan_mesecev_zaliv_big.jpg ), 
  so they can blend in with the water . 
  camouflage 101, 
  yea but you have [ these guys ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jj9rhck.gif ), 
   no one bothered to write it . 
  of course , that would be work . 
  depends on who you ask . 
  in slovenia he 's either a hero or a villain , the opinion varies wildly depending on who you are talking to . 
  or that \u0107evapi are better 50/50 pork & beef instead of just beef, 
  we say we are n't balkan and then half the country is obsessed with ceca , severina , turbofolk etc. 
  something does n't add up if you ask me ... 
  alright sheesh buddy . 
  relax a bit with the attitude , nobody attacked you or your life choices . 
  i do n't see what this has to do with my point ? 
  it 's not like a `` large '' beer takes a long time to finish . 
  the only positive for small beers is that in case the beer sucks , there 's less of it . 
  \\  needing an hour to finish a 0.5 l beer pls, 
  drink more booze pekka everyone becomes proficient in slav after a few drinks . 
  you might not realize it but its true, 
   and 2 out of a 142 is already a huge amount percentage wise while true , there is also the counter-argument of a small sample size . 
  you said ~ 30 left , no ? 
  probably too cold in bestonia . 
  anyway , on a serious note , i do n't exactly like the welfare hunters either , but you ca n't put them in the same category as the actual wifeburners . 
  for all you know they could have just joined their family in germany/sweden and started working in the family bakery . 
  it 's a shame , but its really hard to tell who is a refugee and who is n't , but i believe once the math will be done , the lives saved will be worth it . 
  it 's horrible what happened , but we are talking 2 bad cases out of 142 . 
  trieste is getting more & more appreciated lately . 
  i 've had led quite a few polish tourist groups there in the past two years . 
  now if only dipiazza would close down the ferriera like he promised ... 
  it is pretty fun to see how it works from the inside . 
  and how much they cut down on the bullshit by limiting speakers to about 2 minutes .
