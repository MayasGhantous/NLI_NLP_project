  [ https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/traveling_with_a_criminal_history] ( https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/traveling_with_a_criminal_history )  although citizens of the eu , eea and switzerland are usually allowed to live and work in the uk indefinitely with only a valid id card , they can still be denied entry on the basis of character concerns . 
  why would leaving the eu give more border control autonomy ? 
  the uk is n't in schengen , they can already do whatever they want with their borders . 
  what i meant to say is that even if you had boarders , it 's hard or near impossible to stop the danger anyway . 
   you have no border because if you had borders , you could just deny all muslims and brown people . 
  of course they could lie , that 's why they should have the letter 'm ' stamped on their passports . 
  how would closing the borders help , when you do n't know who it was ? 
   they changed the measuring definitions and the numbers to avoid the statistics showing what the people feared . 
  got a source for that from a reliable source ? 
  it can also be in dutch . 
   after the adoption of the euro not anymore due to our prices rising massively . 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  i checked the dutch inflation around that time and there was n't anything unusual . 
   the conflicts of interest we see between the regions of europe are n't there to the same extent . 
  well but that 's not true , which is clear from the scottish independence referendum . 
  and brussels could be this new central government in a federal europe . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , how is that different form sharing sovereignty with scotland , wales and north ireland ? 
  i recently talked about this with a belgian friend . 
  both slovenia and belgium have a history of foreign rule , and we are distrusting of our national governments , since we see them as immature . 
  slovenians are in general big fans of germany . 
  germany and it 's laws are often portrayed as `` the proper way to do things '' . 
  i guess it depends on your perspective . 
  the uk used to be a strong colonial power back in the day . 
  by contrast slovenia has for most of its history been ruled by some foreign power , so joining a federal europe gives us more influence than we usually had . 
  that clearly does n't seem to influence you , so why leave ? 
  they 're not broke , they pay thousands of euros to get here . 
  china is in the business of cheap manufacturing exports , they want to be as cheap as possible . 
  the uk is a net importer and wants to import stuff as cheaply as possible by having a strong currency . 
   we need to focus on looking at how to organize trading of goods to/from europe . 
  according to [ this article ] ( http://uk.businessinsider.com/these-are-the-biggest-uk-eu-exports-according-to-the-government-leaflet-2016-4/#2-financial-services-5 ) financial services are the uk 's second largest export . 
  number one also being it services , which also would n't be covered by a conventional trade agreement . 
  you would be surprised . 
  many slovenes were strongly convinced we should get the land with his house . 
  many are also very disappointed that we did n't . 
  no , you wanted land , now you have to deal with the consequences !, 
  / s i do n't know what 'll happen now . 
  i guess he can stay in the house , but he 'll have to pay croatian taxes . 
   land that they really did n't care . 
  riiiight , because we have so much land . 
  also , jo\u0161ko joras 's house is now officially on croatian soil . 
  we did n't bribe them , we tried to convince ( with words ) the panel members to rule in our favor . 
  the panel members have been replaced after this came out . 
  i know that croatia decided to not abide by the verdict , but i was under the impression that the whole point of this was that neither slovenia nor croatia can opt out . 
  i 'm not sure how it worked for slovakia , but we had a competition where artists could submit their flag proposals and this one won . 
  even when someone makes us new flags we still get confused with slovakia . 
  i 'm pretty sure that you do n't . 
  dobro jutro !, 
  what 's the weather like during the winter ? 
  i would consider going in the winter if it 's warm enough . 
   the year we voted was ( purely by coincidence , i 'm sure ) the only year we were ever a net recipient of funds from the eec or eu . 
  implying you do n't benefit from the eu in other ways . 
  germany is the largest net contributor by far , and they are trying hard to keep in that way . 
  the germans benefit by having access to a large market that they can sell their manufactured goods to . 
  the uk benefits by having a large market that you can sell your services to . 
   a post-it note with train times and speeds i think this guy wanted to commit suicide . 
  expensive cars and houses ai n't free . 
  they were n't arrested , just detained and the police seized some documents . 
  nor is this unexpected since jankovi\u0107 invited the police to check the documents . 
  no one has been arrested . 
  which translator was used ? 
  i just tried using google translate and the grammar is almost completely wrong . 
  [ they stopped doing that because of the nazis . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bellamy_salute ), 
  that 's why i welcome our european overlords . 
  there was a poll once , which i ca n't find , that was asking if we 'd be ok with another country controlling slovenia . 
  the majority was ok with that . 
  here 's another way to look at this : we earn slightly more than you , but our prices are the same as in austria . 
  austria 's average net wage is 2484 $ , ours is apparently 1227 $ and croatia 's is 912 $ . 
  i said apparently , because 60-70 % earn less than average . 
  is n't croatia cheaper in the non-touristy parts ? 
   go over to bosnia , fill a tank of gas , buy cigarettes and pack of beer that 's cheap . 
  i need to spend over 50 $ just to fill my tank . 
  a good t-shirt 20l of coca-cola 3 movie tickets 12.7 l of petrol 6 red bulls in a night club 10/10 internet ( if you can get fiber ) 4 mac menus, 
   finland or slovenia the article mentioned slovakia , but ok . 
  i was there for a week . 
  did n't see a single cloud . 
  economic left/right : -4.88 social libertarian/authoritarian : -3.08, 
  seems to be somewhere between $ 2,000 and $ 3,100 . 
  [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://download.ei-ie.org/docs/webdepot/teachers%20pay%202008%20report.pdf ), 
  the price of petrol itself is about the same in every country around the world . 
  the difference is in taxation . 
  [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/2007_fcvt_fotw492.html ), 
  try posting it in / r/funny . 
  slovenia demands recognition !, 
  that 's korrekt . 
  das ist a good way to spread fremdsprachenknowledge . 
  he was referring to reddit . 
  since everyone here knows english , we should just stick to that . 
  traffic jams for one . 
  especially since politicians are worth more than you and can force you to the side of the road so they can pass in comfort . 
  why is it always a competition between two candidates ? 
  are n't there more candidates than just two ? 
  no , i think we 're somewhere in the middle right now . 
  the main season ends in august , but there are still quite a few tourists till the end of september . 
  but that 's the problem . 
  it 's a good place to go on holidays during summer , but working there is completely different . 
  croatia is n't known for it 's high wages and job opportunities . 
  and since op wants to work in tourism , he 'll need to earn enough money to get trough the year in 2-4 months during the high season . 
  same for slovenia . 
  the average net salary for 2010 was 1003 $ , but 63,3 % had below average salary .
