  the median average net salary ( where half have more and half have less ) is about 770 $ . 
  i have n't found a very credible source , but this will have to do : [ link ] ( http://24ur.com/novice/slovenija/povprecna-mesecna-placa-2010-je-bila-1003-evre.html ), 
  i 'm not saying that it 's unpleasant or anything like that , just pointlessly expensive . 
  you should also be careful where you eat your cremeschnitte . 
  the \u0160mon restaurant is very famous for it , but it 's the wrong place to get it . 
  in real cremeschnittes , the cream is made with eggs , but i 've heard that \u0160mon uses pudding . 
  park hotel is regarded among the locals as the place where you can get * real * cremeschnittes . 
  the problem is that the uk is always stalling and wants to be given some special treatment . 
  bled : the island do n't pay for the boat ride to the island . 
  they cost 12 $ / person . 
  why would you even want to go to the island ? 
  it 's just a very small island with some stairs , a church and a souvenir shop . 
  and the church is n't worth it . 
  it 's small , barely decorated , costs 3 $ to get inside and the wishing bell does n't fulfill your wishes . 
  welfare is assigned by the government , so the question is not if we trust the receivers , but the governments which are giving it . 
  i checked the circumcision rate of the us , it 's about 79 % . 
  [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www.circs.org/index.php/reviews/rates/global ) i just find it odd that diseases , which require circumcision , are so much more common in the us than in europe . 
  muslims and jews are circumcising the penises of their children because of their religion , not because `` your researchers '' told them to . 
  and besides , circumcision because of medical issues is still legal . 
  circumcision is a permanent act and ca n't be undone . 
  what if the child later in life decides that he would n't like to have a circumcised penis ? 
  it would be ok if it was a decision , which he made himself when he was old enough ( like a tattoo ) , but it 's something the parents decided when he was born . 
  because mutilating a child 's penis because an invisible man told you to is civilized . 
  what kind of medical problems do you have that 60-80 % must be circumcised ? 
  if van rompuy should or should not grow a pair is not important . 
  do you think it 's ok that the members of the eu parliament behave like children ? 
  are they actually saying anything or are they just saying gibberish that sounds like danish ? 
  a video of a video . 
  so did they actually make it obligatory in all primary schools ? 
   `` the ban is there to protect children in general , whether it is real children depicted or not , '' she said in court . 
  oh no , please protect the imaginary children !, 
  ca n't they go to azerbaijan and change their names ? 
  that 's not exactly right . 
  zoran jankovi\u0107 was elected for prime minister , but was n't able to form a coalition because he did n't get enough supporters from the newly elected parliament . 
  if the opposition had more votes than the coalition , the government would n't have been able to pass most laws . 
  the president then chose the man who was second , janez jan\u0161a . 
  if you want to have a gun for a sport , then that 's fine . 
  you should get yourself a shooting range , license to have a shooting range and a license to own guns at your shooting range . 
  however , you should n't be allowed to carry those guns on your person or use them outside of a shooting range . 
  considering how eurosceptical brits are , they sure were in favor of this legislation . 
  39 for and 21 against . 
   the majority of the respondents , around 65 per cent , believe that the prosecutions were not fair to serbs , croats , bosniaks or albanians . 
   90 per cent of the respondents have never read any judgment issued by the icty . 
  seems like they do n't even know what 's going on , they just know that they ( or more exactly their fellow serbs ) are being prosecuted , which they do n't agree with . 
  [ i see . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_naming_dispute ), 
  why do you need to be the * former yugoslav republic of * macedonia ? 
  why not just macedonia ? 
  it seems like many of them do n't have latvian citizenship and ca n't vote . 
  as i understand it , the catholic church will have to pay taxes for their property/land in italy . 
   we must only say nice things about our country . 
  it 's been a long time since i 've last heard a slovene say a nice thing about slovenia . 
  i 've seen one too once . 
   `` using croatian extensive natural resources and it 's well educated population to become a new switzerland and norway . '', 
  makes me think it 's a joke since we do n't have those if croatia had those , it would already be a new switzerland or norway . 
  i can confirm that takeitlikeaditch really represents our country . 
  i have n't been able to find any credible source for that , but i heard that once on the radio . 
  i do n't regard this article as news . 
  it 's just a british euroskeptic circle-jerk . 
  well , we 're not rich , but at least we 're well fed . 
  i doubt they would keep quiet about a leak . 
  they would lose a lot more from a scandal . 
  the post with a link to iaea 's site is much better than this . 
  this is the slovene version : [ slovenske novice ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dlogv.jpg ) the middle section is missing because i 'm not that skilled with a scanner , but trust me , you did n't miss anything important . 
  ironically , `` slovenske novice '' means `` slovenian news '' . 
  it 's like fox news , but in newspaper form . 
  the bottom 30 % are ads , the name of the tabloid is huge and there is also an ad next to it . 
  in the top left it says that it 's read by 330.000 people each day ( 16 % of the population ) . 
  the cut off portion contains two lines of text describing the article , the font is the same size as the green article 's description . 
  this means that there are more pictures than there is written content . 
  yay , we 're part of something !, 
  was n't one of the reasons for splitting off from yugoslavia the fact that yugoslavia was n't listening to us ? 
  bulgaria , romania and greece really lower the average . 
  i 'm not sure if that 's because of the recession or because of corporate corruption . 
  there are companies that have too much work and ca n't find workers , but most are in professions which are n't desired ( like plumbing ) . 
  [ if someone 's salary is paid for by tax money , why should a part of their salary be taken to pay taxes ? 
  it would be pretty stupid if a government would have to pay itself taxes . 
  he needs to learn how to behave . 
  also , he talks like [ hitler in his hate speeches . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eghdx1si3ky#t=1m40s ), 
  corruption and the inability to stop corruption . 
  there 's a huge difference between taking advantage of a bombing and organizing a bombing . 
  we use wills , but i do n't know about portugal . 
  i love the euro , because we do n't need to exchange our small country 's currency for another small country 's currency when we go shopping abroad . 
  so is it time to invest in the usd ? 
  these are only popular names for newborns , not the most common names in general . 
  the ending - ia makes it sound less developed . 
  nah , it 's ok . we constantly get confused for slovakia , people who do n't know us think that we 're somewhere in africa , etc. 
  our pm looks kinda sad . 
  our only real issue was the border dispute with croatia . 
  we 're cool now , since both countries signed an arbitration agreement . 
  nuclear is better than coal and oil , but worse than solar , wind and other renewable energies . 
  corruption is nothing new in less developed eu countries . 
  i can guarantee that for slovenia . 
  once you get 10 cents , invest them in gold .

  haha . 
  we get many bosnians , macedonians and serbs . 
  we 're not against immigrants . 
  we 're against illegal immigrants and immigrants who do n't want to integrate into the countries society .
