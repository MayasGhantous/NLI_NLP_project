  great britain, 
  shit haircut , tho, 
  and yet , we still have clowns among us , who say communism is good . 
  apparently the swiss do n't like to follow bilateral agreements they signed . 
  i find it absolutely staggering how many people here think `` single market '' and `` free trade agreement '' are basically the same . 
  i would n't have thought that , considering the bullshit comments i read on our news websites . 
  cause shit , get hit . 
  in 10 years they should make a tv mini-series about this clusterfuck . 
  it 's not $ 560 billion , but $ 400 billion . 
   italian banks , hurt by 360 billion euros of non-performing loans , sluggish economic growth and record-low interest rates , are under pressure to clean up their balance sheets and restore investor confidence . 
  zl is eurosceptic , no ? 
  we 're gon na make eu great again !, 
  i can not imagine what will this news cause on the markets tomorrow . 
  was ? 
  thanks obama . 
  [ this one fits your comment even better .

  pope must really be against brexit .

  i have this feeling that in the end they are going to remain . 
  and honestly , i do n't like it . 
  more like stepkid . 
  zero . 
  according to ukip , turkey will also be in the eu . 
  my mistake . 
  i had in mind a guy that was on bbc . 
  he said the same thing . 
  he probably expected that mi5 would change his vote later . 
   switserland is an extremely socially conservative country , in fact it was only very recent that they even allowed all women to vote . 
  ( 1991 ) you 're off by 20 years , mate . 
  probably because romania is not oecd member . 
  apparently canada is also thinking about introducing it . 
  that makes 3 of the five eyes countries . 
  well , nutella is definitely not the same . 
  considering various factors , i imagine my quality of life would decrease if i moved to germany for example . 
  i 'd bet on # 1 . 
  what does tim pool have to do with breitbart ? 
   pool 's coverage has been carried and syndicated by multiple mainstream outlets such as nbc , reuters , al jazeera , rt , and time . 
  he has also been featured in fast company , wired , and time . 
   in 2013 pool joined vice media producing and hosting content as well as developing new methods of reporting . 
   in 2014 , he joined fusion tv as director of media innovation and senior correspondent . 
  this was already known , was n't it ? 
  i remember hearing about this on qi years ago . 
  i bet this is going to make her even more popular . 
   defence minister of slovenia : we are close to reaching nato target  wales treaty states each member country has to spend 2 % of it 's gdp on defence . 
   the agreement which was accepted in december also predicts for military spendings to reach 1,2 % of bdp in next decade . 
  so either i 'm a moron or they are ... 
   like `` this school is fking auschwitz . '', 
  you should do stand-up . 
  hopefully it will pass on national level as well . 
  source ? 
  i know `` allegedly '' le pen and fillon did that , but have n't heard anything about macron . 
  i like him . 
  any idea why fillon is against ceta ? 
  of course they are . 
  it just makes so much sense ... 
   i agree with that tho . 
  why shoud russians live under a anti russian goverment ? 
  ** also check out how corrupt fillon is . 
  ** did n't le pen do basically the same thing as fillon ? 
  she just used eu funds . 
  `` i will drop out of france president race if investigated '' - francis fillon http://www.bbc.com/news/world-38769136, 
  no alternative ? 
  i can tell you right away , eu investors will not like that . 
  you know , since they are the biggest users of the dispute settlement procedures . 
  anyway , how will then investors be able to deal with a country that discriminates against foreign companies ? 
  true . 
  it was actually ennio flaiano that said something similar to this quote . 
   in italia i fascisti si dividono in due categorie : i fascisti e gli antifascisti . 
  translation : in italy the fascists are divided in two categories : the fascists and anti-fascists . 
  green frog before the plebiscite, 
   francois fillon , the former french prime minister who is in a strong position to be elected president next year , believes brexit must be `` fast '' and leave britain without its crucial financial passport . 
  they could have built a giant wall on mexican border with that kind of money . 
   free trade is not on the table - may rejected common rules on trade and freedom of movement . 
  both of these are required if you want actual free trade . 
  why would ceta-like agreement between uk and eu require fom ? 
  let me guess . 
  you have never lived in communist state . 
  san escobar, 
  eu is going to be divided on every single issue even when uk leaves . 
  do n't worry . 
  only negative things will come from this for eu as well . 
  i do n't know ... where does it say so ? 
  i do n't know how accurate this is for the rest of the countries , but for slovenia it 's very wrong . 
  unless nepal somehow managed to double their gdp in 2016 . 
  nepal gdp : ** 21.195 billion dollars ** ( 2015 ) slovenia gdp : ** 42.775 billion dollars ** ( 2015 ) * source : world bank *, 
  dimitrij rupel , one of the founding fathers of european empire . 
  200 years from now , his face will be on 100 $ bill . 
  she 's no merkel , thats for sure . 
  usually 3,00-3 ,50 $ . 
  good job . 
  cats are assholes . 
  what was the turnout ? 
   slovenia : $ 20.2 yeah , that 's probably bullshit . 
   average gross earnings per hour for february 2015 amounted to eur 9.68 . 
  [ stat.si ] ( http://www.stat.si/statweb/en/news/index/5119 ), 
   ** i would have understood if the court had ruled on a concession to use a narrow strip without registration ** , but to bend international law like that does n't seem fair at all . 
  and exactly this happened . 
  those are still croatian waters .
