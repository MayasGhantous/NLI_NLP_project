that feeling on the autobahn , when you 're going 160km/h and a car passes you as though you were standing still and it was going 160km/h ... well and then 5 minutes later you 're at the next large town and the traffic allows you to go 40 at most , but hey , it was fun while it lasted . 
  sure they are , but writing rules differ . 
  there 's a rule in serbian , implemented by [ vuk karad\u017ei\u0107 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vuk_stefanovi%c4%87_karad%c5%bei%c4%87 ) , which says that words should be written like they are spoken and read like they are written . 
  this means that foreign words are written exactly like they sound using serbian phonetic rules i.e. 
  the english name michael is spelled majkl , or new york is spelled [ njujork ] ( http://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_york_%28savezna_dr%c5%beava%29 ) . 
  this rule does not exist in croatian . 
  in croatian new york is spelled exactly like in english -- new york . 
  [ article on new york from the croatian wikipedia for comparison . ] ( http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_york_%28savezna_dr%c5%beava%29 ) . 
  if you examine the articles further , you will see , that croatian also uses the ljekavian form whereas serbian does n't . 
  edit : croatia also spells using their own geographical names if they exist ( for example canada is kanada , but that 's because kanada is a proper word in croatian . ), 
  this is perfekt though , not konjuktiv , 
  yeah , but german has die see and der see . 
  one is lake , the other is sea , i ca n't remember which is which though ... 
  oh , do n't get me started !, 
  every time i mess up an article . 
  i once got points deducted for using apartment instead of flat in a gap fill exercise ... 
  it does . 
  written dutch makes a lot of sense . 
  spoken , however ... 
  nor do croats for that matter . 
  serbs do , though . 
  urajt lajk it is spouken . 
  yeah well he worded it rather poorly ... 
  quite a few . 
  square of the french revolution , beethoven street , then all the big roads into ljubljana are named after the large cities they used to go to ( dunajska ( vienna ) , tr\u017ea\u0161ka ( trieste ) , celov\u0161ka ( klagenfurt ) . 
  and a bunch of streets are named after countries . 
   i do n't know the numbers man , i do n't even think there are albanians in slovenia . 
  there are . 
  the wealthy ones are either involved in organized crime or they own the bakeries and 24/7 fast food shops in which the poorer albanians work , or both . 
  the derogatory term is not \u010cefur , but \u0160iptar or \u0160ipac just like in the rest of ex-yugoslavia . 
   all people who live in ex yu countries and albania are called \u010cefur , you know ? 
  not just immigrants to slovenia , but people who live in those countries . 
  serb in serbia and serb in slovenia are both \u010cefur for slovenians . 
  no , this is simply not true . 
  a serb living in serbia is a serb . 
  infact it 's the other way around ... 
  it 's the slovene serbs who do n't really fit in when they visit family in serbia . 
  there 's a saying among them here : `` bolje \u010defur v ljubljani nego janez v bosni . '', 
  ( better a \u010cefur in ljubljana than janez in bosnia . ), 
   and that word '' \u010cefur '' came from the derogatory slovenian term for jews '' \u010civut '' . 
  so for slovenians , all people east of them are jews , and that 's an insult in slovenia . 
  okay , this is n't really true either . 
  the word \u010cefur is used exclusively for slavic immigrants from other republics of the former yugoslavia . 
  no one else . 
  and the fact it comes from the turkish word for a jew does n't really mean anyone is being called a ` jew ' , whatever that means . 
  i 've never heard anyone call anyone a \u010divut . 
  also -- the younger generation have taken up the name \u010defur as their own . 
  they reffer to eachother as such . 
  the only people who really use it in a derogatory manner are middle-aged rightwingers who hate everything to do with yugoslavia anyway ... 
  maybe also fitting would be the movie [ \u0160i\u0161anje ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1129437/ ), 
  [ full movie on youtube ( slovene and serbian , croatian , bosnian ... ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_03w4ja_f2m ) no english subs unfortunatelly . 
  edit : [ subtitled trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=039ijkgqz14 ), 
  no , i think it 's because we all use the same central european qwertz layout , which is then further altered to fit south slavic languages . 
  ehm . . slovene and no , it did n't . 
  it did use to be written like german though , with z being read as c and s like z etc , but this was in the early 1800 's . 
  also \u0141 , \u00df , \u0110 and \u0106 which we do n't even use !, 
  \u0160 is not an accented s. 
  it 's not like a billion dollars is much to a country of 200 million . 
  seems fake , but i 'm not a brit so not sure , but people make ` ghetto ' parodies here too . 
  this seems highly likely to be incorrect . 
  slovenes are generally very pro-eu . 
  i will be in krakow in a month and will also be checking this out . 
  did you just say that greece is in eastern europe * geographically * ? 
  [ tushek supercars . 
  they do n't contribute much to this metric , though . 
  ah okay , i was unaware of that fact , i thought there was more to this , seeing as how em drive has been theorized about for quite a while . 
  i guess we 're discussing this on / r/europe because quite a lot of people with many different interests live in europe and some of those interests include science :d, 
  nevertheless , it tells us the science is sound and it could eventually be used . 
  whether we can use this science as functional technology today , however , remains to be seen . 
  those idiots probably just ruined the whole thing ... 
  this is , incidently , considered the most played instrumental tune in the world . 
  we are quite good at those debates though . 
  i think on of the finals this year was slovenia vs slovenia , actually . 
  honestly , i 'm pretty sure there are many in sds , who are fed up with jan\u0161a , but he 's the `` national hero , who liberated slovenia from the communists '' , that attracts the 20-something per cent of voters that always vote for the party just because of him . 
  there are no real right wing options in slovenia which i , as a rather left-leaning individual , find rather dissapointing , because it means the left does n't have to be the left , since there is no right to balance it out . 
  sure , but half the countries mentioned were not behind the iron curtain . 
  austria , greece and yugoslavia come to mind . 
  i 'm pretty sure austria , greece and turkey would argue they 're not in eastern europe as well , with the rest of the balkan countries making a fair point at the same claim . 
  this is the weirdest definition of `` eastern europe '' i 've seen to date . 
  legally it 's still water , so special precautions have to take place ... 
  if the letter r is not followed by a vowel the ` uh ' sound is always before the r . so words like srna , smrt , prst , vrt , trg , grd , odprt etc , are all pronounced with an \u0259 sound before the r , though we do not write it down . 
  it is the same in serbian/croatian/bosnian / ... 
   at trg republike this is highly confusing at first . 
  it 's not just that ... 
  when you have 50 % unemployment , average wage really does n't tell you how much money the average person has . 
  exactly . 
  we all know cannabis is not dangerous in and of itself ... 
  but god knows what the hell those people lace it with to maximize profits and strength . 
  legalizing and making an open market would allow for quality control . 
  [ central europe stronk .

  i 'm not sure what it was , but if you look at this chart , you can see a huge jump in gdp/capita in most eu nations who then had , or did n't have the euro . 
  [ chart ] ( http://www.google.de/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:grc&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false&amp;icfg&amp;iconsize=0.5#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:svn:svk:nld:hun:grc:deu&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ), 
  exactly ... 
  while german influence is a very real thing in the both the eu and individual member states , it is far from being the only deciding factor . 
  our economy , for example , has just started to pick up again after 2008 and it would be a huge hit if greece were to not repay its debts , since we now hold one of the highest per cents of gdp as loans to greece in the eu , which means that our government will protect its interests and vote against countries we generally agree with on most matters . 
  do we not matter to greece , because there 's just 2 million of us , despite the fact we 've literally risked our own economic well-being so they could avoid bankruptcy ? 
  are we not worth negotiating with , just because the amount we lent is just a drop in what is a sea of debt , even if , to us , it is money we could have spent in other , for us , more productive ways ? 
  not to mention , that the catholic church as an institution probably has more child abuse associated with it than any other organization in the western world . 
  `` for children '' indeed .
