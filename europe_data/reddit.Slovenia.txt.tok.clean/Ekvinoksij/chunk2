  yes , but you guys are rather new to the currency . 
  i used to convert all the time as well , but the prices have changed so much since the switch , that it has no meaning anymore to say that something would cost 500 sit , because in 2006 the same article was was probably more like 200 sit anyway . 
  on a slightly irrelevant note ; the name janez , while very stereotypically slovene , has been decreasing in popularity over the last 50 or so years to the point , where , today , i only know 2 people named janez under the age of 30 and everyone calls them johny , anyway . 
  the long nights take a toll on people . 
  hell , i get annoyed , when i get home at 4 in december and it 's dark outside and slovenia is quite a bit to the south compared to , say , bergen . 
  one of the other candidates is the former slovene president danilo t\u00fcrk . 
  it 's not about the relevancy of the country when it comes to posts in the un . 
  many , many bosnian muslims drink . 
  rakija is life . 
  when they grow up and the area has since boomed , bringing huge return on all investments . 
  longest word : dialekti\u010dnomaterialisti\u010den --  to do with dialectic materialism , whatever that means ... shortest word : v/a/s / z , which are all used to link stuff to other stuff in a sentence . 
  we do n't really have long words . . 
  i 'm still waiting for that verb forms competition ... or maybe amount of declension exceptions ...

  how many huge bodybuilders do you see per week on average ? 
  and by huge i mean arnold-in-his-prime size , his bmi was slightly under 32 then . 
  i doubt it . 
  people who are considered obese by bmi , but are actually not , are well aware of how bmi works . 
  it takes amateur bodybuilders several years to even get to a bmi of 25 with a low bodyfat % . 
  being active and doing all sorts of physical activites is a very big part of slovene culture . 
  so is eating massive amounts of meat and potatoes though and drinking wine/beer ... too bad exercise is not that effective at burning calories . 
  then again a huge amont of young people are very health-conscious , so i 'm actually fairly optimistic about obesity rates over the next 20 years . 
  just fyi , the last one ( slovenia 2009 ) is actually slovakian . 
  while `` slovensko '' does mean the land of slovenes in slovene it is never used in this context . 
  the slovene coins always say slovenija . 
  and sloboda is the slovak word for freedom as opposed to the slovene svoboda . 
  honestly people say that german is hard , but here it 's seen as the easy language , because most of its grammar follows well defined rules with very few exceptions ... 
  the only annoying thing is having to memorize genders ... 
  it 's one of their arguments , actually . 
  that the uk complains , but then follow the rules of the eu , whereas the other bash the uk for complaining , but then ignore the rules themselves anyway ... 
  they mixed up slovakia for slovenia . 
  the second slovenia should say slovakia . 
  maybe slavs were considered white , but not aryan on the level of germanic people . 
  slavs were to be used as cheap labour in the post-war nazi-led europe . 
  when yugoslavia capitulated in 1941 hitler visited maribor , the second largest city in slovenia , and said : `` machen sie mir dieses land wieder deutsch . '', 
  ( make this land german again ) . 
  this was followed by a massive wave of forced relocations of slovenes to serbia and other places as well as other measures of removing the slovene population . 
  2 million . 
  today roughly 15 % are ex-yugoslav immigrants . 
  what ? 
  the combined european part of nato dwarfs russia in military expenditure . 
  you just linked a google search with some results of some amateurishly made maps which mean nothing . 
  there 's a [ map ] ( http://www.mapsnworld.com/political-world-map/eastern-europe.jpg ) of `` eastern europe '' there which depicts belgium and the netherlands . 
  not to mention , that the geographical centre of europe is in belarus . 
  because germans do n't like nuclear energy and it takes a lot of coal to power such a large economy . 
  brussels is officially bilingual , it 's also the capital of the dutch speaking region , but most people who live there speak french . 
  [ oh , you laugh now . 
  brno in the czech republic is another great pick . 
  excellent czech beer for 60 cents/half liter . 
  and the cheapest beer i could find was 8 kr ( 0.3 $ ) for half a liter and it was n't even that bad . 
  well , on track in this case means potential candidate in 10 years ... 
  it 's a joke . 
  croats do n't make this mistake .

  i do n't know ... 
  this map predicts our population density to increase by at least 2,5 times ( which is absurd ) while all other projections predict our population to stay roughly the same . 
  i suppose most of these dishes are typical for the area relatively close to zagreb and to the north-east ? 
  becuase practically all of the listed dishes are typical for slovenian cuisine around \u0160tajerska and prekmurje ( i.e. 
  the thinnest strip of slovenia between austria and croatia closest to hungary ) . 
  [ \u0160truklji ] ( http://www.pekarna-pecjak.si/sites/pecjak/files/struklji,%20sirovi_0.png ) [ blejska krem\u0161nita ] ( http://www.vitafit.si/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/krem%c5%a1nita.jpg ) ( okay , this one comes from bled , which is a whole different region ) the slovene name btw , though nobody uses is kremna rezina , everyone sticks with the german loanword . 
  [ mi\u0161ke ( mice ) ] ( http://www.kulinarika.net/slikerecepti/3232/1.jpg ) good ole [ \u0160pricer ] ( http://beta2.finance.si//pics/cache_pw/pwe08_skropec_spricer_br.1343152141.jpg ) the famous , seven-layered [ prekmurska gibanica ] ( http://www.delo.si/assets/media/picture/20080609/prekmurska_gibanica.jpg?rev=1 ) and [ \u0161tajerska gibanica ] ( http://www.kuhajmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/stajerska-gibanica.png ) and of course , [ orehova potica ] ( http://www.blejskiotok.si/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/o/r/orehova_potica.jpg ) , [ makova potica ] ( http://s3.mojalbum.com/4114153_4132528_7309496/kulinarika/makova-potica.jpg ) and [ pehtranova potica ] ( http://www.dnevnikich.si/slike_prica_2/potica_2_303_1364377362.jpg ) ( made with tarragon filling ), 
  probably not , since the rocks given to yugoslavia are , afaik , kept in serbia . 
  oh boy , so as to avoid confusion between slovenia and slovakia it 's easiest to simply not include us . 
  how ? 
  the exchange rate is fixed . 
  [ relevant . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbzcecvoata ), 
  honestly , people here were rather shocked . 
  these were the people we 've lived with for almost 80 years . 
  everyone knew at least someone from each of the republics , practically everyone , who was an adult then , knows someone who has died in the wars . 
  my father often speaks of the people he 's met while serving his mandatory service and wonders aloud , how many of them have died in the war and where the rest are today . 
  of course it was blatanly obivous that there were nationalistic tensions , but people could not believe what was going on , and had had a hard time processing that tragedies like srebrenica could happen so close to home . 
  nowadays we avoid the subject and spend our time debating whose grandfather was on which side during the nazi occupation and whose father was a spy for the communist government ... 
  ah , i guess i should 've thought of that ... 
  should 've been bijela ruka , though , should n't it ... also / u/crnaruka is serbian . 
  serbs spell bijela as [ bela ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_hand_%28military_organization%29 ) , so maybe a croatian equal-opposite . 
  hey , whatever floats your boat . 
  the balkans do n't have a uniform culture , now , do they ? 
  would you consider serbian culture very similar to romanian or greek ? 
  just because our languages are similar does n't mean our cultures are . 
  besides , what i said is true . 
  there are immigrants here , who refuse to assimilate , people who have lived here for over 50 years and still ca n't speak the language . 
  and milan ku\u010dan . 
  obviously , my point was , that our cultures are not similar enough to not require assimilation when a person of one nationality moves to the area of the other nationality . 
  [ quite . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/srbija_do_tokija#/media/file:graffiti_ljubljana_64.jpg ), 
  because the french gave more rights to the slovene language in the illyrian province as opposed to the habsburgs , slovenes generally thought of the new regime as an improvement . 
  in fact , there 's still a french revolution square in ljubljana ( the capital of illyrian province ) and afaik the only [ statue/memorial of napoleon ] ( http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3034/3015614242_ab5fdc4123.jpg ) outside france . 
  this is what i was taught as well . 
  that the royal white is surrounded by the colours of paris to show the control of the people over the king . 
  oh , they were notorious for their protruding jaw/chin . 
  if you look at paintings of habsburgs you will notice , that they 're not particularly good looking . 
  well , this is what they looked like after being `` beautified '' by the artist . 
  correct . 
  countries do n't extradite their own citizens . 
  edit : apparently i was wrong . 
  some do , others do n't .
