and dealing with disobliging civil servants who do n't speak english . 
  taste of their own medicine ? 
  i too have stepped outside my house in the capital . 
  that 's what i 'm saying . 
  not because it was n't a good country , but because of rampant nationalism among every nation in said country . 
  i know what you mean but you could , like , tone it down a bit yeah ? 
  especially after all this time . 
  we 've been fucked out of trieste and probably other stuff , but by now that 's a joke here . 
  i mean fuck , what do borders even mean now ? 
  who cares how much land your country has ? 
  i do n't . 
  i guess that would mean more gbp for social projects , since you 're not in the eu , so that 's beneficial , but i just do n't understand the rampant nationalism . 
  if you 're a serb , living in an area mostly populated by serbs , that happens to lie in croatia , what does it matter ? 
  so you use kunas instead of dinars . 
  even the language is vastly similar . 
  or , you can move back to serbia if you wish to connect your ethnicity and nationality . 
  my joke at how the balkans are a clusterfuck where everyone hates each other , and that that 's the reason yugoslavia failed , and you reply with an insult , confirming that the balkans are a clusterfuck . 
  that 's not my opinion , it 's just what i think / u/kartoffelvampir was trying to say in his original comment before being downvoted to hell and , admittedly , ridiculed by me . 
  i mean , it 's not about nazis in any case , it 's about the attitude . 
  my point stands . 
  yeah i understand what you mean i think . 
  he 's basically saying `` we 're better than you because we 're right and you 're wrong , we 're the _ true _ germans by the virtue of our own definition '' not entirely unlike a certain someone saying `` jews and cripples and slavs and gays are not real humans '' . 
  what would you think if the lyrics said `` we 're the * proper * germans '' instead ? 
  because i think that 's more what it meant but it is n't poetic enough for a song . 
  this is why we ca n't have nice things like yugoslavia . 
  i know you 're low hanging fruit here but  because that who ever made this is a douchbag is really the only message i am getting from it . 
  are you literally retarded ? 
  incoming right l\u00fcgenpresse comments too . 
  on reddit as a whole , i 've noticed that about 50 % of all news links have top comments that explain how the title is clickbait or the article is bullshit . 
  it 's just the current state of online journalism . 
  and it 's pretty sad . 
  fuck , we almost exclusively use the `` german '' `` ja '' now . 
  reading the comments this entire map seems wrong , or rather , there is a lot of discrepancy between the formal words and what people actually say . 
  i am pretty sure that 99.9 % of reddit will never get this username joke . 
  makes me proud and sad at the same time . 
  usually with a lowered voice . 
  maybe with a russian accent , but that really depends on the situation . 
  yes but does it prove it ? 
  also , regardless of how much of the article is true , that headline _ is _ unnecessarily sensationalistic , controversial and panic-inducing . 
  if anything , it 's implied that the vocal right wing minorities make it seem like germans are n't capable of compassion . 
  not what / u/kenpatchirama-sama said . 
  and it was all going so well, 
  well i mean , you actually had an answer . 
  good on you , although i do n't agree with that comment 100 % , or rather , some parts of the definition are pushing it when it comes to putin . 
  mostly things like the fear of difference or contempt for the weak . 
  putin does n't really seem to have this idea of `` the great russian man '' and that the inferior ukrainian/chechnyan/westerner must be exterminated . 
  okay , okay , _ i _ admit i do n't know . 
  can you please now explain ? 
  do n't cut yourself on that edge, 
  where do the brigades come from ? 
  oh that 's totally right . 
  i 'm talking about what gets upvoted . 
  go to a thread about some crime a refugee did and / u/kasingabimga 's comment would be at -22 and top voted comment would be about how it 's `` not worth trying to argue with the far left , every immigrant who comes here obviously contributes great academical knowledge and makes it their sole purpose in life to spread peace and prosperity '' or something like that . 
  this subreddit switches popular opinion like an economic immigrant switches countries . 
  but that 's good , i guess . 
   that 's why the other thread about this event has been deleted duplicate posts get deleted . 
  not because `` nazi mods ( anti-nazi mods ? ) '', 
  but to keep it clean . 
  i 've had totally non-inflamatory links deleted because someone has simply posted it before . 
  that is a fact . 
  i was just thinking recently about how long it will take until a white woman is removed from `` the black side of the bus '' at some or other campus . 
  well i guess we 're all migrants from africa or something , then . 
  well does n't it ? 
  the whole post slanders the immigrants , and the last paragraph is the `` proof '' that they 're uneducated barbarians that should be barred from entering the country forever . 
  and if they 're not , there 's no point to the post . 
  it 's just becomes hatemongering without any factual basis . 
  why ? 
  is n't it just as valid of a word ? 
  policeman/woman i mean . 
  yep . 
  you guys are the chillest . 
  i think that besides ljubljana prague is my favourite capital , because it never feels like a giant city ( although it is very big ) , it 's filled with old architecture , small alleys and squares and things , and people are n't cold or aloof , i feel very at home there and visit frequently . 
  or just be a tiny on the way to germany country nobody really cares about . 
  i love your username . 
  it seems that the multipla [ got a face lift ] ( http://www.theaa.com/images/allaboutcars/testreports/2004086_fiat_multipla_main.jpg ) so the newest model is n't butt ugly anymore , but man did the guy designing the 1998 version screw up big time . 
  it competes with fiat multipla if you ask me . 
  not that anyone would want to win that competition . . 
  do we count as east or the west ? 
  with the way our government goes out of it 's way to bend over for germany i 'm interested to see what happens , will we be included in the shut off borders or not ? 
  but would n't you say some people actually hold these opinions ? 
  `` fucking invade isis already and crucify every fucking is fighter . 
  cowardly pigs . '', 
  yes i see what a nuanced and thought out comment presented in a manner that encourages discussion . 
  this place has been / r/xenophobia for a while , but recently it turned into 4chan 's / pol / but whatcha gon na do, 
  people who think socialism = communism = bad . 
  hey hey hey . 
  not everyone has watched it . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ could n't ^ ^ be ^ ^ bothered ^ ^ to ^ ^ find ^ ^ a ^ ^ link, 
  i perceived it in more of a `` i have a black friend so it 's not racist '' sort of way , maybe i 'm just jaded by all the rampant xenophobia on this sub recently, 
   i love my country and i do truly think that those who need help should get it but not at the expense of quality of life for germans . 
  i will get downvoted of course but this is a `` not in my back yard '' if i ever heard one . 
  and some xenophobia later too . 
  while nothing is wrong with that , we 're all prejudiced people , it 's always a bullshit move to say something politically correct to excuse something that 's not , after that . 
  upvote for voice of reason among devastated jerked knees . 
  yeah dairy is pretty long ( if we combine all the cheeses and milk and yoghurt ) but for a single type of item , i think pasta . 
  there are two sides of a semi-isle in a larger shopping centre near me , if i recall correctly . 
  i agree . 
  monsanto should n't be let on european fields and the approval and safety system should be reformed . 
  i 'm all for gmos but obviously with some control on it . 
  `` this is where it gets fucking hard '' to paraphrase .
