  english is becoming a big part of youth 's vernacular . 
  the better they know english the better for tourists . 
  i hate it when i go to france and ca n't even order bread in english . 
  [ pankrti - lepi in prazni ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmsm1ymbfd0 ) [ otroci socializma - vojak ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0lblh0l4ec ) this one is n't as punky but all members are from former punk bands and they also did punk . 
  that 's an opinion for sure . 
  oh please . 
  who gives a shit ? 
  [ n'toko ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq8ngcwt2lu ) is quite known . 
   one serbian woman on facebook was threatening that she better not see anymore americans in her country i mean you would n't really hold a country that bombed your home in high regard . 
  it would honestly be called `` huge american car '' but what it would legally be considered as depends on it 's weight ( 3.5 tons , over or under ) , and of course it 's classification in the registration papers . 
  it would most probably fall under `` terenec '' which translates to `` suv '' but usually means large off road vehicles ( think 4runner ) . 
  typical car engine displacement is , 1.2 l ( subcompact ) , 1.4 ( econobox ) , 1.6 l , 1.8 l and 2.0 l ( all sorts of vehicles , 1.8 , 1.9 and 2.0 usually being turbodiesels ) , with 2.0 and 2.2 turbodiesels being used in larger cars . 
  older cars also have 3.0 engines when straight 6es were used in normal bmws . 
  of course there are larger displacements of all sorts , but those are reserved for luxury vehicles ( mercs ) or sporty cars with egines with more than 4 cylinders . 
  as far as the `` typical car '' is concerned , it 's a 1.6 l 4 cylinder hatch . 
  pretty much the volkswagen golf . 
  it 's an ok flag , but makes confusion with slovakia easy . 
  i would n't have it changed , but if they were going to change it i 'd submit [ this ] ( https://images.encyclopediadramatica.se/f/f4/slovenia_flag_00001.png ) as the replacement :p, 
  nobody uses it , or if someone does , meaning you call them and it goes to voicemail , i usually curse and hang up because it 's stupid . 
  the [ freising manuscripts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freising_manuscripts ) are the oldest recorded use of slovenian . 
  i am cheering for our team . 
  but i think like , denmark will win this time or something . 
  i disagree !, 
  there we go , both sides from our country are now represented here . 
  what do you think will happen ? 
  i am getting this ultra conservationist vibe from you , it seems like you think that when this generation dies al `` true slovenians '' are gone , or what ? 
  a slovenian is someone born here that speaks the language . 
  and there are many other more likely threats to this definition than a few brown people getting into the mix . 
  no , cultures and ethnicities die all the fucking time . 
  i do n't think i 'll live long enough for it to be a super huge shift anyway . 
  holy shit i was at tegernsee last year in summer . 
  i think it was the lake festival ? 
  literally everyone was in traditional dress , it was beautiful . 
  also , everyone was in a 70 's porsche , which was also beautiful . 
  also , since i was in a band , beer was free . 
  and that was most beautiful of all . 
  but that wo n't deter low effort baiting though . 
  they 'll just hop on their troll account and off they go , does n't matter that it has -1000 comment karma from being recognised as a troll all the time . 
  it is super convenient . 
  everything is cheap when i go on vacation and i do n't even have to convert currency . 
  i think the mods have to put a minimum account age and karma limit for posting . 
  if you mean like amateur aircraft from one small airport to another , okay popular . 
  if you mean proper airplane transport , i do n't know why bother you can drive across our country in 3 hours :d, 
  literally never . 
  i do n't play it often in person even , but i 've never played it online . 
  maybe i should try . 
  think of articles like simplified cases . 
  you most definitely do n't say `` i saw cat . 
  cat was black '' in croatian . 
  that 's just how it translates to english directly because english has lost it 's case system . 
  you say `` vidio sam ma\u010dk * u * . 
  i think . 
  first example the noun `` ma\u010dka '' is in accusative , second it is in nominative . 
  it works similarly in english , just that there are articles to help you form a sentence because without a case system a noun stays the same in all cases . 
  i do n't know the dates or any eurovision performances but even i know exactly what the 1990 yugo one is ** hajde da ludujemo ove no\u010ci **, 
  half a litre ( that 's a bit less than a pint right ) of staropramen or tuborg is 1.5 $ at the bar i like most , but that 's 0.5 $ cheaper than just about anywhere else so i 'd say average it 's 2 $ per half litre of beer . 
  the only team sport i play at least semi regularly is flunkyball . 
  otherwise i prefer sports like biking , hiking and skiing . 
   i notice you do n't include andorra yeah i fucked up when i copied and paste . 
  i have no idea how rare any of these coins are . 
  i 'd guess vatican ones are pretty rare . 
  [ on the right side all the coins ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/html/index.en.html ) so , austria belgium cyprus estonia finland france germany greece ireland italy latvia lithuania luxembourg malta monaco netherlands portugal san marino slovakia slovenia spain vatican city, 
  have you came across them on the internet ? 
  literally never . 
  why would anyone who 's not slovenian speak this language , let alone on the internet ? 
  i do n't know if there is a specific song played every time , but _ the _ new year song has to be silvestrski poljub ( new year 's kiss ) by alfi nipi\u010d . 
  ~ ~ czech republic ~ ~ czechia : czechland . 
  sounds so much better imo, 
  i always rooted for `` czechland '' it rolls off the tongue really well, 
  no , that 's what you 're shitposting here . 
  europe is not lebanon . 
  that 's entirely up to how it 's handled . 
  probably not , but we ca n't know until it happens . 
  there would probably be like the us , with different states with different county equivalents . 
  celsius just makes way more sense throughout . 
  it is , for one , clearly defined , boiling and freezing point for water does n't change ( at atmospheric pressure ) . 
  however fahrenheit was defined with 0 being a brine solution temperature , 32 being the melting points of ice and 96 being the best estimate of human body temperature . 
  like , what ? 
  it introduced needlessly propietary values from the start . 
  and to add , f is now also defined with the boiling and freezing point of water ( 212 and 32 respectively ) . 
  but , all of this is kind of irrelevant for everyday use , it comes down to what you 're used to using . 
  is n't that what the sub is about it would seem like it judging by the posts . 
  to be honest that does n't sound half bad . 
  or i am too used to it because it 's pretty much the same here . 
  there are reforms `` on way '' to make things faster but i am too jaded to get my hopes up . 
  i do n't care who who voted for , people are people . 
  i think america is a 1st world country with 3rd world country elements , like lack of democracy , partial police state , poor healthcare , poverty issues , insane conservativism ( anti abortion campaigns etc ) , no employment safety etc. 
  i do n't know how you did it . 
  the country is prosperous for corporations but horrible for the people , and i ca n't pinpoint a single event that lead to this . 
  i am baffled . 
  i think it 's your stupid political system with only two relevant parties and no actual direct democracy from the people at least in terms of electing the president , problem is the president holds a ton of power , not just a bit like in most of europe . 
  i think we can all agree tax evasion is bad and has to be abolished , right ? 
  favourite ? 
  ca n't say i really , like , enjoy his work . 
  he is culturally important and all but his literature is just depressing . 
  but maybe i am missing something , i do n't know . 
  hey our police just bought two rubber patrol boats fear us, 
  is this satire or ? 
  yeah i thought it was `` 6 foot pole '' not 10 . 
  apparently i was wrong .
