  what ? 
  islam currently has almost no geopolitical power . 
  no major superpower is islamic . 
  in fact currently all three major `` sabre-rattling '' powers ( usa , russia , china ) have big problems with muslim extremists . 
  any more info on the location of deradicalisazion sizes , their effectiveness and the size of these programs ? 
  you severly underestimate the desperation of some people , and seriously overestimate the capability of european nations to stop immigrants , even by force . 
  with kissinger you never know . 
  which is exactly what i 'm doing . 
  shit . 
  i want you to know that thanks to your remark that the destroyers in the `` destroyers for bases agreement '' were shitty , i ended up on a wikipedia binge about the sinking of bismark , torpedo bombers and all kinds of stuff on naval warfare . 
  it 's probably the usual strawman complaints , that lazy people will claim homelessness to get free housing ( because homless shelters are usually high-class houses / s ) . 
  did n't the aldo moro kiddnaping by the red brigades basically ruin the pci ? 
  there is always that one asshole that wants to shit up the thread with unrelated politics . 
  of course . 
  the whole europe was gearing up for a major war , however it was k&k that pressured and attacked serbia , and germany that violated belgian neutrality to open the western front . 
  i 'd love a flag similar to the [ flag of of ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/flag_of_the_liberation_front.gif ) , except with triglav being a bit smaller and with three yellow stars instead of the of & the red star . 
  imo almost anything is better than our current monstorsity with the awful coat of arms on it . 
  ( i also like our [ old flag ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_slovenia#/media/file:flag_of_sr_slovenia.svg ) , but it might upset people . ), 
   which is bullcrap though . 
  wwi was caused by serbia being dicks and assassinating a guy . 
  i ca n't believe that the central powers get blamed for starting the war when they invaded serbia . 
  the serbian government did not assassinate ff . 
  it was an yugoslavist movement called mlada bosna , which sought to unify the yugoslav people . 
  this is not what triggered the war . 
  the war was triggered when the serbian government refused the ultimatum presented by k&k , which was intentionally made as unreasnoble as possible , to allow k&k to go to war . 
  the ultimatum was a series of 10 demands created to destroy most of serbian sovereignty , and their influence in the balkans . 
  the reason central powers get blamed is because the germans fully supported k&k in its decision to pressure serbia . 
  k&k could not afford a war against serbia and russia , so it had to have german support , which it got . 
  i 've had a similar experience in the adriatic sea . 
  an unpolluted night sky is an incredible sight . 
  well ... yes . 
  mostly . 
  its basically a map of light pollution , which is generally some function of population density and the developement level of the county . 
  for europe it 's mostly just a population density map . 
  i get your point , but what is eu supposed to do ? 
  roll out the tanks ? 
  sometimes that 's the only way to save a country 's economy . 
  thats not the point . 
  the point is that if he was a muslim , there would be no jokes , just rage about immigration this , muslims that ( go back to old reddit threads and look ) . 
  this thread has nothing but jokes , despite two people being dead . 
  it might just be tsipras being careful . 
  [ weeeeeell ... ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=tsipras+putin&amp;biw=864&amp;bih=828&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=vjecvdicoykzsggk9i6gag&amp;ved=0cacq_auoag ) ^ ^ yes ^ ^ i ^ ^ have, 
  what else can you do ? 
  they certainly ca n't repay them , since austerity measures are tanking what little remains of their economy . 
  lets hope not . 
  i barely trust my own government , i sure as hell do n't trust the one in brussel . 
  nah mate , your taste is shit . 
  oooh , i remember that . 
  what was the ad for anyway ? 
  before you dabble too much in your outlandish theories , you should know that he was a member of mlada bosna , which was a bosnian-serb organisation . 
  you 'll notice that bosnia was occupied by kuk at the time . 
  you 'll also notice that kuk was increasing the pressure on serbia as well . 
  so apparently i 'm a troll because i do n't belive that an european government , made mostly of german , french and british politicians , will be better for me than a local national one . 
  both kingdom of shs , and kingdom of italy were democratic for large periods of time during their rule over our lands . 
  it did n't make things much better . 
  democracy is not some magic cure that prevents opression . 
  in many cases it enables it . 
  people did n't like it when they were ruled by vienna , they did n't like it when they were ruled from belgrade ( not counting tito ) , and they certainly did n't like it when they were ruled from rome ( or berlin ) . 
  i do n't see how we 'll like it to be ruled from brussels . 
  and while i 'm sure larger states ( germany , france , uk ) can maintain their sovereignty , smaller states have no chance . 
  we 're getting pushed around enough as is . 
  those were penal units , not a general tactic on the eastern front . 
  that article reffers to about 500k men in such units ( the number is unsourced , by the way ) . 
  even 500k men is a small figure when comparing the casualities of western and eastern fronts . 
  that whole article makes a whole lot of unsourced claims , making me very reluctant to belive it whole . 
  i 've heard of the damn lend lease . 
  i 'm asking you to cite the numbers . 
   100 % of soviet trains and trucks were built in the us  soviet russia relied almost entirely on lend-lease material built in the us give me citations that prove these , specifically `` 100 % '' and `` almost entirely '' claims . 
  and please do n't link me a whole wiki article again . 
  give me at the least a specific paragraph or , you know , an actual historical peer reviewed source . 
   ussr contributed more because they had a penchant for sending their poorly trained and equiped troops into the meatgrinder give me a source on that happening on a large scale please . 
   during the early war soviet russia relied almost entirely on lend-lease material built in the us and shipped from and by the uk . 
  ^ [ citation ^ needed ]  even during the late war nearly 100 % of soviet trains and trucks were built in the us . ^ [ citation ^ needed ], 
   millions of russian dies because your leaders were so shit . 
  what the fuck ? 
  that 's just factualy incorrect . 
  if anyone is actually interested [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/23l0bu/how_did_german_military_doctrine_differ_from/ ) is a link to an analyisis of different wwii doctrines and their effectiveness . 
  america had no nuclear arms before mid-45 and even then they only had 2 . 
  if germany and ussr had not gone to war , or if germany won in 41 ( the only realistic time they could have won ) , than the war in europe would be over by 42-43 , considering the difference in manpower on both fronts . 
  you can see the statue of wilhelm at [ 2:02 ] ( https://youtu.be/r5i9k7s9x_a?t=2m2s ) . 
  this was later destroyed by the the gdr government . 
  you and me could get along . 
  even here , he is very careful about saying anything specific . 
   all three presenters agreed that if one of them quits or gets sacked they all stop everybody keeps saying that , except i 'm positive they said they 've never said that . 
  and your proof that this is happening ? 
  you know this subreddit would be much better if it did n't upvote the most infantile , stale and unoriginal jokes at every mention of russia . 
   the contents of your speech are irrelevant . 
  that is completely false . 
  libel is a crime mostly everywhere . 
  because the economies of western nations shifted to create different jobs . 
  i disagree . 
  the decline of the worker class is directly correlated with globalisation . 
  as workers gained rights in europe more and more companies shifted old workers jobs to places where the costs were lower ( ie places with no worker rights ) . 
  i saw that happening , but he mentioned something about mods of / r/russia, 
   at first i thought they could n't take a joke but after reading reactions as these i can hardly blame them for distancing themselves . 
  context ? 
  did i miss something on 1.4 ? 
  agreed . 
  with the rise of globalisation and the decline of the european worker class , the left wing parties all over europe , looking for voters , have adopted the neo-liberal economic model and and shifted from appealing to the poor to appealing to middle-class liberals . 
  that 's not even close to being as bad as ksa .
