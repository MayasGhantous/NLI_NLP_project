  yeah , i just saw this on scw . 
  a leader of human rights watch org . 
  supporting jihadists . 
  what a fucking embarrassment . 
   kerry also complained to lavrov about an air strike last week that killed zahran alloush , a prominent syrian rebel leader who had supported the peace talks , toner said . 
  oh , the prominent syrian rebel leader that led [ jaysh al-islam ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jaysh_al-islam ) , a radical salafist group fighting in syria ? 
  the same zahran alloush that praised osama bin laden , and calls jabhat al-nusra and al-qaeda his brothers ? 
  so these are the people kerry wants to negotiate with ? 
  with people that are downright promising the genocide of alawites and christians if they get into power ? 
  the fact is , that as long as the west considers these people the legitimate opposition , assad will not step down , and allow the ethnic cleansing of alawites to take place . 
  warning about this [ have ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/opinion/the-worlds-next-genocide.html?_r=0 ) [ been ] ( http://news.bitofnews.com/remember-the-alawites-a-minority-population-in-danger-of-genocide/ ) [ around ] ( http://www.spectator.co.uk/2012/10/die-slowly-christian-dog/ ) for [ years ] ( http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/christians-to-beirut-alawites-to-graves-why-assad-still-retains-substantial-support-in-syrian-civil-war/ ) . 
  e : i 'd like to ask the downvoters to explain their voting . 
  i 'm not sure , did i break some rules , or lied in my statements ? 
  or is disagreeing with a news source [ literally setup as a propaganda machine by the cia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radio_free_europe/radio_liberty#united_states ) disallowed on / r/europe ? 
   putin could n't resist doing the exact opposite of what the us started doing currently they are doing similar things thing with their air forces . 
  russia is propping up saa ( assad ) , while usa is propping up sdf ( kurds + a few others ) and the iraqis . 
   does europe as a whole agree that assad should stay in power though ? 
  not really , although most are slowly accepting that unfortunately assad will probably end up staying in power , since replacing him will be almost impossible . 
  one , the russians will not allow it , and two , the entire syrian state is staffed by his loyalists . 
  remember what happened in egypt ? 
  mubarak was removed , but as soon as morsi attempted to change the balance of powers in egypt , he was ousted by gen. sisi . 
  assad is also quite popular with the remaining syrian population . 
  remember the chants `` christians to beirut , alawites to the grave '' ? 
  syrian christians and alawites do . 
  considering putin is making sacrifices everywhere else to be able to sustain his geopolitical goals , this does n't surprise me . 
  the decision to intervene in syria is also quite popular in the west , so it 's perhaps seen as attempt to improve relations with europe . 
  russia owns its military industry ( for the most part ) , so they most likely do n't pay such high prices for their missiles . 
  do people not take their shoes off in their houses ? 
   also so much for the left , when the communist party votes against . 
  communist does not mean liberal . 
  wish you 'd done it mate . 
  very interesting . 
  thank you . 
  what is that from originally ? 
  [ translation of the article with google translate . 
  ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sl&amp;u=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/referendum/pobudniki-referenduma-uspeli-sprememba-zakona-o-zakonski-zvezi-zavrnjena/381559&amp;prev=search ), 
  of course . 
  it does n't fit the new / pol / - lite agenda , that is being pushed since / r/europe became a default . 
  peace comes with military action or negotiations , not with worthless embargoes and blockades . 
  you want to hurt russia ? 
  stop buying their gas , petrol and other materials , which are the foundations of their economy . 
  except most replacements for gas & oil would come from people even worse than russia . 
  they 're bombing rebels like jabhat al-sham and jabhat al-nusra who are members of al-qaida and want to depose al-assad to install their own brutal regime . 
  russians have not bombed the southern front , nor have they bombed the ypg or any other member of the sdf . 
  i agree . 
  ban shitty one word/sentance posts that add nothing to the discussion . 
  what he 's telling you , is that crimeans elected numerous local governments in the past 25 years that wanted to join russia , but this was always blocked by kiev . 
  see my other comment . 
  we already voted , but the law was repelled . 
  slovenia actually has same sex civil partnerships since 2006 ( i think ) , but iirc that does n't have all the benefits of being married . 
  crashing this state !, 
  because neo-liberals love cheap labour . 
  sadly it probably wo n't pass . 
  the opinions seem split , but the opposition to it is much more organized , and will probably attend in greater numbers . 
  my hope was that the attendance would be below the required 20 % threshold , since this would mean the law would automatically pass , but this i also doubt this will happen . 
  i think most people simply do n't care . 
  i think the pro sides best chance would be to boycott the referendum , since they have very little chance of out-organizing the rcc . 
  there have been calls to do so based on moral and constitutional grounds , but nothing came of it . 
  so i 'm guessing we 're having a repeat of [ 3 years ago ] ( http://www.dvk-rs.si/index.php/si/arhiv-referendumi/zakonodajni-referendum-o-druzinskem-zakoniku ) . 
  yeah , we 're voting on it this sunday in fact . 
  he handled the crisis well did n't he ? 
  rise in popularity is normal in such circumstances . 
  thanks . 
  i was looking for something like that . 
  guardian says :  to sum up : the left has won in at least three ( aquitaine-limousin-poitou-charentes , bretagne , languedoc-roussillon-midi-pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es ) , the right in at least five ( provence-alpes-c\u00f4te d\u2019azur , nord-pas-de-calais-picardie , grand est , auvergne-rh\u00f4ne-alpes , pays de la loire ) and the front national in none . 
   right and left are still neck-and-neck in bourgogne , centre and normandie . 
  e : new results , seems like 6 regions to ump , 4 to the left : https://twitter.com/franceinfo/status/676133864239144960/photo/1, 
   / pol / is losing their fucking minds , it 's hilarious . 
  what else is new ? 
  they lose their minds every time someone left of mussolini is elected . 
  if you follow politics for long enough , you can actually notice how parties change their rhetoric in campaigns after they 've been it power at least once . 
  many lose their edge , and start advocating for much milder and reasonable policies . 
  agreed . 
  parties that have never been in power , have the easiest time garnering voters . 
  [ bbc article ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35088276 ) that will probably be updated as the details roll in . 
  nothing there yet . 
   nothing wrong with using outdated operating systems in the industrial applications not just that there is nothing wrong , it 's practically mandatory . 
  using stable releases of software is critical in long mission systems , as they are the only ones with proven track records of running for many years . 
  to me that implies that ( surprise , surprise ) gay people vote based on other criteria that their sexual identity , not that she is somehow attracting the gay vote . 
  and slovenia . 
  where i live a first-aid course is mandatory for a drivers license , but i seriously doubt that many people actually still remember anything from them . 
  he also distributed the protocols of the elders of zion iirc . 
  i was under the impression that the russian economy was tanking due to the over-reliance on gas & oil exports , whose price dropped sharply in the last year . 
  i thought russia signed large deals with china for the export of gas to lessen it 's reliance on europe . 
  seriously . 
  it 's not like famines were uncommon in russia at the time . 
   famine still occurred in eastern europe during the 20th century . 
  droughts and famines in imperial russia are known to have happened every 10 to 13 years , with average droughts happening every 5 to 7 years . 
  russia experienced eleven major famines between 1845 and 1922 , one of the worst being the famine of 1891 -- 2 . 
   famines continued in the soviet era , the most notorious being the holodomor in various parts of the country , especially the volga , and the ukrainian and northern kazakh ssr 's during the winter of 1932 -- 1933 . 
  the soviet famine of 1932 -- 1933 is nowadays reckoned to have cost an estimated 6 million lives . 
  the last major famine in the ussr happened in 1947 due to the severe drought and the mismanagement of grain reserves by the soviet government . 
  from most of what i read the famine of 1932-33 seems like it was a disastrous combination of a total crop failure , collectivization ( and the resistance to it ) , and a complete and utter incompetence of the soviet leadership and its bureaucracy ( such as exporting grain to meet their quotas , instead of redirecting it towards their populations ) . 
  i 'm yet to see any actual proof that the holodomor was an actual genocide , since most of the proof is politcal guessing about the intentions of the soviet leadership . 
  the actions of nkvd against the polish 1937-38 fit the ( un ) description of a genocide much better , since people were executed for simply having polish sounding names . 
  to finish : the holodomor was a horrible event , that should be remembered , but ops post is pure propaganda by our resident ukrainian propagandist and liar walt_ua . 
  the guardian and the telegraph are pretty reliable , both with obvious biases . 
  sas really is a great subreddit . 
  he just told you . 
  they have coal .
