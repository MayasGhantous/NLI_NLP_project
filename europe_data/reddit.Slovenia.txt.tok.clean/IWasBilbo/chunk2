  even better , try why is ( country ), 
  now we wait for an app update, 
  i have learned enough to understand what 's going on on their amazon, 
  6-8 $ for slovenia ? 
  which is what i said , more or less, 
  oh no croatia , map is older than your eu membership, 
  the kangaroos are safe !, 
  what 's up with the dialect , it 's like gibberish . 
  damn mountain people . 
  reeeee, 
  triggered, 
  balkans, 
  they want to drink all that milk, 
  balkan wars is something else , in 1912, 
  let them make jokes about our superior alpine country . 
  remember that thread about some ginger infused water ? 
  so weird . 
  i know . 
  silly people . 
  chocolatines, 
  you can do it if there are no barriers , and your car 'll get towed . 
  funny language ? 
  how dare you, 
  same thing in slovenian actually . 
  just did n't bother with details before, 
  in slovenian that 's the past tense of `` to fart '', 
  solve the political compass quiz for some perspective ( although some edgy kids deem it unreliable , but still , in relation to itself and to others that took it it should be fine ), 
  the fuck, 
  the cold gets to you, 
  yes . 
  i was in istanbul for 2 nights in a 5-star hotel that the airline provided me for free ... and the street 3 minutes away already looked like a middle-eastern warzone ... 
  the touristy bits were nice though . 
  this was in march , btw . 
  northern california or the pacific northwest in the us ... or quebec . 
  slovenia almost best , i like , yes . 
  we might have a river that borders the peninsula which does n't mean that our whole country is in the balkans if you want to get nitpicky . 
  if you 'd like , you can call the balkans everything south of norway or something . 
  the majority of books and web sources place the geographical border for the balkans in southern slovenia . 
  political influence is something else . 
  what do you mean officially ? 
  in my books , it 's not . 
  no no slovenia not balkan slovenia central yes, 
  yes , and we 've been in the eu , schengen and had euro for quite some time now . 
  should n't really be a question i think . 
  there 's one near my place and it has the shortest delivery time of all restaurants near me so i order indian ( and nepali ) very often and it 's delicious . 
  they even have pizzas with nuts and dried fruit . 
  half good ? 
  same here, 
  nice . 
  how tall is that waterfall ? 
  i can barely stand cheap beers , most suck to me ... 
  i 'm more than happy to spend 3 + $ on a beer from a microbrewery or some exotic brands, 
  hmm i wonder if it would n't taste like shit to me in austria , 
  in the end , it all comes down to where you actually go for food . 
  french , and spanish on duolingo . 
  yeah , the houses are solid , but even after that i have a feeling it looks , feels fake or replicated in a shoddy way ... dunno . 
  the street where i was looked pretty similar . 
  dude , i feel you . 
  i slept in a house where kitchen tiles creaked . 
  turns out they were plastic , but nothing unusual for the homeowners . 
  it was in a nice neighborhood too . 
  the architecture of * some * little town centers looked fake european to me ( as you said , `` built in a hurry '' to match the style ? ) . 
  it seems that everything that looks old also has a `` ticky-tacky '' feel to it ... 
  i never thought there were more people that felt the same way !, 
  you have perfectly described my experience with little towns and houses . 
  i flew to paris for $ 16 last summer . 
  dunno about fu\u017eine , man . 
  still spooky at night . 
  i would n't have balkan food there . 
  \u010c ( ch ) , \u017d ( zh ) and \u0160 ( sh ) . 
  e and o have different pronunciations in different words but we do n't write the accents unless it drastically changes the meaning of the sentence ( usually seen in books ) - \u00e8 and \u00ea are the same ( but there are rules when to use each ) , \u00e9 , \u00f2 and \u00f4 , \u00f3 , sometimes \u00e0 too if it 's a shorter ` a ' sound . 
  we do n't have q , w , x , y. 
  not really a flashmob if you cover the entire floor with confetti ? 
  eat and drink in lower carniola region , sometimes even a veteran swoops by and drinks with us at one of our scenic `` ch\u00e2teaus '' in vineyards that are actually [ just lodges ] ( http://www.tvz.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dsc00414.jpg ) . 
  actually called `` cabane de vigne '' ? 
  we also have bonfires the night before . 
  we 've also used `` srednji vzhod '' ( middle east ) in geography class , but i 've never heard anybody use that . 
  apparently it means some other countries too like egypt . 
  you can spot the orange plates from miles ( kilometers ? ), 
  away . 
  a guy once approached me in london and said `` bonjour , marijuana ? '', 
  and went away a moment later before i could even realize the meaning of his words . 
  i think it was a montenegrin guy . 
  there are tons of jokes about them being lazy and slow . 
  but italians chop it and put it in jars so it officially does n't count as picked mushrooms/etc, 
  looks exactly like how you would pronounce slovenian `` daj jim to '', 
  oooh we say that too !, 
  concentrated juice ... diluted with water, 
  the only answer to this question can be lower styria ... 
  it 's pretty shit yeah, 
  same in slovenian . 
  `` fourandtwenty '' . 
  i did that too , but then went for 4 days in berlin without once using cash . 
  they can do that here too but i dislike my neighbors . 
  bratislava is nice this time of the year . 
  iti rakom \u017evi\u017egat - to go whistle to the crabs - to die . 
  trda mu prede - hard is spinning ( as in textiles ) to him - he 's having a hard time,
