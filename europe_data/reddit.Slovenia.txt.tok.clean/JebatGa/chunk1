[ pizza burek . 
  ] ( http://www.visitljubljana.com/file/1348203/burek-3.jpg ) i have n't been able to see it anywhere else but slovenia . 
  if you 're ever in ljubljana you have to go to bavarski dvor where close is a place called burek olimpija onslovenska cesta 58 . 
  they have the best pizza burek . 
  it 's just so good you ca n't eat only one . 
  [ this looks like a lot like prekmurska gibanica . 
  in my country , slovenia , there was increases in amount of fine one has to pay in case of breaking the law , then more control by police , especially for drunk driving and more social responsibility for drunk driving . 
  you now get judged by everybody a lot more if you drink and drive , at least by the experiences in my social environment . 
  but as i can see from number from other parts of europe , we could still die less on the roads . 
  there is still to much drunk driving here . 
  and the roads should be getting fixed more often . 
  the economic crisis has left many roads here in terible condition . 
  so an increase in number of deaths would n't be such a surprise . 
  for slovenia it should also said dedek mraz ( grandfather frost ) and miklav\u017e ( on st. nicholas day ) . 
  miklav\u017e should traditionaly bring small gifts like fruits , sweets , some chlothing , rarely toys . 
  dedek mraz is giving gifts on 31st of december or more traditional on 1st of january . 
  bo\u017ei\u010dek is christmas . 
  * npu - nacionalni policijski urad ( national police biro ) conducted several investigations at people 's homes for fraud and corruption . 
  one imporatant dude investigated is our minister of defence . 
  supposedly they only wanted to question him for ties with the main suspects . 
  * our main ( and only ) military ship went to help with refugee crisis in italy - helping the refugees that risk their lifes to come to europe * we are all hoping ( i hope so ) that tina maze form has come back after getting on the podium today in st. moritz in giant slalom . 
  she has some problems with her team . 
  * damir dugonji\u010d `` dugi '' won gold in european short course swimming championships in 50m breaststroke * most important maribor won over wigan and will spend winter in europe . 
  amazing , they are ( supposedly ) the second cheapest team in that liga europa . 
  do n't be sorry . 
  slovenia is like waaaay better then croatia . 
  ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ visit ^ ^ ^ us , ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ need ^ ^ ^ ze ^ ^ ^ money, 
  what ? 
  branches are already open here for a couple of decades . 
  ok the stereotype here would be grandsons and sons of southern immigrants . 
  have you never encounted gangs of this people walking on the streets or sometimes in some nightclubs . 
  if you have n't you are a lucky ( or antisocial ) human . 
  we call this french salad . 
  and by the reforms the fucker means higher taxes , cuts in pay for public workers , implementing working till you drop dead and more bailouts for some banks . 
  fuck this shit . 
  i do n't know but he would probably sue his neighbour for something land related , and constantly bitch about second world war when important stuff like big unemployment , no economic growth , corrupt politicians and why the reduction in social state arose . 
  [ you also forgot potica .

  i do n't want rakija , we do n't even call it like that . 
  we call destilled drinks scnaps or \u0161nopec in our language . 
  all bulgaria has is one small mention in some early century . 
  that does n't make it a bulgaria drink . 
  i wo n't say 100 % that it did n't originate from bolgaria , but i wo n't say it did . 
  there were destilation methods know even before rakija . 
  maybe you were just the first to write it 's name down . 
  even the rakia is wrong . 
  destilation of alchohol happened way before bulgaria ever existed . 
  how can you claim you made both yogurt and rakia ? 
  [ i 'm also being biased here but i like ours the most . 
  sure russian , italian or german are good , but i like ours as it does n't glorify our nation into something it is n't , but that there may be peace and it wants all nations and individuals be free , and they are no longer our foes but neighbours be .

  there was also news that from march to july 1000 there were over 1000 new employees in public sector , but that proved false as the statistical office counted working hours and as there was a lot of overtime it seemed like there were a lot of new employees . 
  just want to mention for your 1st point . 
  i hate when 70 year old history gets mixed with today , but i fucking hate it that they want to equalize collaborators and partisans . 
  you are only emphasizing 20th century . 
  when i was going to school we were taught all the way from prehistory . 
  but the emphasis was on arrival of slavic people to area of today slovenia , carantania - the first country of `` slovenians '' , freising manuscripts or in slovenian bri\u017einski spomeniki , where first official words in slovenian were written , then we were talking a lot about us in habsburg monarchy and later austro-hungarian empire and our role in it . 
  we were talking a lot about our fight against ottoman empire . 
  then primo\u017e trubar and protestantism and katekizem and abecednik , where first literary rules were written . 
  then came fight of slovenian intelectuals for slovenian word and fight for slovenian acknowledgment in austro-hungarian empire . 
  only then came ww1 and ww2 and all the messy stuff . 
  when i was still in school there was n't so much talk about our independence fight , which i wished we talked more . 
  then when you 're older and you start reading books by historians , there are so many people left out out of our history that were n't so important but had such a great stories that i wished we talked about . 
  also i wish that more would be said about the [ carniola ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carneola ) . 
  we do n't know a lot about it , but i wish we would 've taugt our children more . 
  maybe we could learn more about our prehistory and roman and early middle ages more , as more and more archaeological evidence are being put forward . 
  more should be said also for ww2 and post ww2 history as it is being abused by today politicians whenever they need to put public eyes away from certain problems . 
  tito was hald slovenian half croatian . 
  he was just staying in belgrade a lot . 
  the german thing was the most strange experience we ( there was a group of us ) had . 
  i just find it really funny , that some croatians understand czech and slovak more easy than slovenian . 
  of course we will keep coming . 
  it 's a beautiful country . 
  coming on vacation to croatian coastline , they can understand german , italian , english , czech , even polish , slovak , but when it comes to slovenians it 's like blank . 
  i 'm not saying that this happenes everywhere , but you 'd get surprised how often it happens . 
  go to a restaurant , the waiters speak all the languages in the world except slovenian . 
  then you have to order in german , because you speak alien languange ? 
  i can understand you ca n't speak it , but understanding it ? 
   for us , understanding slovenian does take a little bit of adjustment yeah you better understand german and italian than slovenian . 
   slovenians were exposed to yugoslav and later separate serbian , croatian and bosnian cultural spheres for many years so you indeed understand us much better by default . 
  not the younger generation . 
  i hear a lot of the younger kids do n't understand croatian . 
  it 's all anecdotal evidence , but i know my niece and her friends barely understand croatian . 
   while i 'm sure this is mostly true , i have gotten my car keyed in croatia before . 
  do n't worry . 
  it happens to us slovenians more often then we would like . 
  or have our side mirrors and lights broken . 
   a lot of yugo-nostalgics , even among young people who were born after tito died . 
  i wonder if that 's valid in other places in former yugoslavia . 
  in my experiences in slovenia it is the same . 
  not with all the younglings , but a surprising amount of them like the times when tito was alive . 
   and could communicate basic stuff with speakers of slovenian basic ? 
  some croatians come to slovenia via exchange students program ( erasums and similar things ) . 
  every last of them had no problem understandig us from the first day they arrived . 
  but as soon we come to your sea , you do n't understand a word we are saying . 
  may i ask what do you mean catholic version of the yugoslavs ? 
  slovenia : * our minister for internal affairs said that electronic voting will come to slovenia soon , there will be a trial done on some local elections , to see how its going . 
  * parliament agreed on some cuts to some of the ministries . 
  some ministers are already complaining about it . 
  * our defence minister will fly to some visit with our state plane .
