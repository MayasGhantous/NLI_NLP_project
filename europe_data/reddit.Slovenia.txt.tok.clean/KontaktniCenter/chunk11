  wasnt there a bit to mage russian the second offitial language but estonia refuzed to alowe the 25 % of the countrie population its minorety rights as promoted by eu law ? 
   and the state of our neutrality during ww2 sometimes being brought up as a comparison to a more contemporary situation neutraley sounds to me more like you waited to see who will win :p  [ it also allowed the allies to use swedish airbases between 1944 and 1945 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sweden_during_world_war_ii ),

  i must say i do n't trust these filter machines and suck . 
  when i make coffe its always turkeys coffe , no sugar,

  while the socdems of milanovi\u0107 and the guy himself , downrigjt hated and dismosed serbs and othe minoreties . 
  in bih \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 pared with croatian from the presidency to make a law about the constituional court ... 
  but thats unrelated shit stiring in cro the new primiministe aparently has the support of the serbian minorety since he promossed the use of the serbian languahe and minorety rigjts and the shit . 
  also nikoli\u0107 had a long speach in novi sad something about the city being built upon sacrifise and rasbary exports are down . 
  sinve sou are german lets start with your country . 
  split germany into 3 ( or 2 at least ddr and ndr-splits into 2 ) we forbid any member from being a monarchy . 
  we forbid any member of being a member of a military aliance that is not eu . 
  all new regulations have to be first confirmed ny member states , not only ratified upon thret of punisment . 
  a demovraticly elected commision . 
  joind border control , yoined military force/aliance ... ect ect, 
  afganistan is a safe country , so is eritreja and demrep kongo , sudan is arguable , but only a small region of the countries is in a state of war ... germany needs labour . 
  they have an aging population and are exoected to alowe a prolonged stay to this wawe . 
  amay i remind you that unlike yugoslavians , they have no wish to return and are motivated to stay by mama merkel, 
  i understand that . 
  i used to believe all the shot the mases around me did in 2008/9 at the hight of the econ crash i was a dirty neoliberal . 
  but posind myself to entertan redicilous contrary beliefs and arguments i arived to a certan solid conclusion . 
  who\u017eich i have to this day been unable to dislodge . 
  sometimes i do like to be the advocate of my good friend lucifer , even of such a beloef is not my . 
  since people are so entrenched in their echo chambers its imposible tonget them out . 
  ( example : r/slovenia r/europe post something anti west there and be downvoted to oblivion whilst being atacked for being a melitious trol ), 
   but isnt a contrarian someone who disagrees for the purpos of disagremant ? 
  there is nothing wrong with disagreing with the majorety . 
  could you ppeas answer my question which relates to a point you made erlier . 
  if you are not interested in having a normal conversation than fine , i understand , its typical of your kind  but crimea wsnt methodicly setteled . 
  neither was krajina . 
  are you next going to claim bih is bosniaks while serbs and croatians should fuck of ? 
  wow , you honestly believe , the petit burgois who mama merkel invited in are here temporarely ? 
  if they wanted protection from war turkey would sufice , grece even if you feel the turks are bad to you ... mans of them are not even from war ravaged countries ... are you troling me or something ? 
  im simply saying poland realy cant count as good relations with the slavic world . 
  macedonia was never bulgarian . 
  not once in human history . 
  uk , france and russia didnt participate in the 2nd balcan war . 
  and russian solders only ocupied bulgaria when chasing away the nazis in ww2 . 
  you realy should get your facts straight, 
  im just a plane conservative in a liberal world . 
  everione is pro west for some reason and i just want socialism and russia back . 
  i actualy hate the liberals more than the clericals ( right ), 
  poles are a piria of the slavic worldy they prefer germans to other slavs and behave like germans . 
  macedonians hate bulgaria to this day for trying to forcefuly take them . 
  ww1 you saw an oportunety to gain teritory and you took it .
