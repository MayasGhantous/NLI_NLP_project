  no russian army atacked bulgaria in that was , separation pece was signed remembre ww2 it was , again you saw an oportunety to gain land and took it . 
  may i remind you you aided nazi germany and atacked yugoslavia ? 
  with no war declaration learn your history . 
  what ? 
  in my opinion eu should only consist of republics . 
  but crimea wsnt methodicly setteled . 
  neither was krajina . 
  are you next going to claim bih is bosniaks while serbs and croatians should fuck of ? 
  you can have those too . 
  if you give them free houses they will come to you . 
  we have 8000 roma in slovenia . 
  most of wich are integrated and also all of them are cristian, 
  poles ? 
  a nother brand of blod traitors , you put them as your example ? 
  you crack me up man . 
  how about ww1 say ? 
  ww2 maybe , anyone ? 
  2nd balcan war ... 
  fine you can have all the muslims . 
  my country only has 2 000 000 people 1000 is 0,5 % and thats is quite significant, 
  whel bulgarian historic fondnes for germans and turcs and the historic hate towards felow slaws ower the past century lead me to believe the majorety of the nation was like that, 
  disgusting , coffe should be made in this : https://images.google.si/imgres?imgurl=http%3a%2f%2fcdn.merkurimg.si%2fmedia%2fcatalog%2fproduct%2fcache%2f1%2fimage%2f9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95%2fp%2fo%2fposoda-za-tople-napitke-biva-dzezva-13-cm-za-12-oseb-cvetka_1367053_.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.merkur.si%2fvse-za-dom%2fkuhinjska-posoda-in-namizni-program%2fvse-za-kuhanje%2fposoda-za-tople-napitke-biva-dzezva-13-cm-za-12-oseb-cvetka&amp;docid=eujvadt00_lj5m&amp;tbnid=bjl20x4qdhibem%3a&amp;w=600&amp;h=600&amp;hl=en-gb&amp;source=sh%2fx%2fim, 
  havent you watched the news today ? 
  but you always kiss der deuche ars :p, 
   eu is bad for us economically , politically , socially , and for pretty much everyone else . 
  preach brother !, 
  aparently hdz likes serbs and minoreties now ... soooo that confuzes me, 
  but how would you get thrown out of the eu if you didnt :p / jk, 
  of course you do , a nother man from your country had the idea of a united europe . 
  i believe he went by the name of adolf ... was it schicklgruber , no they changed it to something else ... 
  isnt that the majorety opinion ? 
  how do you make coffe ? 
  do i have to give only 1 opinion ? 
  - america is an evil enire . 
  - eu serves no good purpos and should be shut down . 
  the united europe idea needs a conpletly different aproach . 
  - nato is evil . 
  we never should have joined , we need out . 
  - russia should be our friend . 
  - slovenian independance war was ilegal terrorist action . 
  - the internet should be shut down . 
  - we should close our borders basicly im a living breathing disagremant meme, 
  * ambulance chasers, 
  proportions are no excuse for a city to be dirty . 
  muricans are n't coming this time . 
  either you let them go , or we move the border to piava again . 
  nonono , the trend now says you will start writing random letters in words like the english . 
   besides , padania as an entity is as real as teletubbieland . 
  do n't you dare talk about our future neighbours like that . 
  it truly has transformed the language , 10 more years and it will be conpletly nointelegable to serbial :p good work, 
  no no , im talking about the `` zrakomlat '' and conpany . 
  sure is . 
  but do n't wory , we wont tahe trst from you . 
  well wait for the north to declare independance and surender it wilingly in exchange for military protection . 
   the language is going in a bad direction just like the country itself . 
  luckily for me i hate the language ( except the fact that it 's like the best language to swear in ) oh come on . 
  you guys have done wonders with that language in the past 25 years :p, 
  so was my :d #darkhumour, 
  all the cityes i listed have mas tourism ? 
  especialy belgrade . 
  so is ljubljana , so is celovec , fucking belgrade is les dirty than paris, 
  this desevers to be on the 1st page of imgur :d, 
  myself i never encountered rude people . 
  but the city seemed dirty to me . 
  true , i 've heard stories of people wanting to ask for directions starting by saying `` excuse me , do you speak english '' and getting a response like `` yes . 
  but not for you . '', 
  unles you merge that office with the office of the kancley ey  / jk, 
  not much . 
  the president of the republic declares a date for parlamentary elections , he signes laws , and is the high comander of the armoued forces . 
  makes perfect sense man . 
  interesting . 
  because they are native to turkey ? 
  i could ask you the same thing ... 1920 much, 
  fire clenses , remembre, 
  and than i go to a museum and the staf ( the educated staf ) cant muster a single word of english ... makes sense, 
  how would the czek version sound like ? 
  this ^ - ^, 
   because it came to europe through turkey . 
  i see , so a flock of turkeys decided to fly to europe frew turkey , than migrate to the americas and go extinct in europe ? 
   you would have to hate a lot of countries yes . 
  i have a list . 
   do you also think mexico and all of central america are horrible places due to proximity to the u.s. ? 
  among other things , but they also have bigger problems . 
   i would say canadian 's in general have an anti-invading-other-countries-and-violating-sovereignty sentiment may i remind you canada is a nato member . 
   open borders sentiment , not really . 
  it was a hell of a lot of work just to get nafta and that does n't even allow free movement and only i was talking about them muslim refugees . 
   justin trudeau i 'll agree with but he wo n't last forever . 
  hell last long enouth . 
  and his post nation country idea is dangerous . 
  having the most tractors in the vilage . 
  why than turkmenistan ? 
  turkey meat is prety populas . 
  mostly as a white chicken meat supliment . 
  there are no wild turkeys on the contint as far as i know , the birds are way to stupid to survove anyway . 
  paris , next to the eifel tower . 
  some black man , black as night , seling trinkets yels `` pet za jedan , pet za jedna '' ( 5 for 1 in serbian ) wtf france ? 
  eu be like : `` so , erm ... 
  when are you moving out britania , we broke up erm ... monts ago . '', 
  id say its probably cuz they couldnt aford bathing suits, 
  fracking , bituman oil industry , proximety of usa , anti russia sentiment , open borders sentiment , justin .
