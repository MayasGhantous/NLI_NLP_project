  but http://www.kclj.si/ has the equipment that you describe . 
  also they borowed some from medical suplies sails conpanies and reconstructed the people who needed reconstruction . 
  no need for a specialist hospital when you can do it all at one place . 
  also , draw a 500km radius around [ geoss ] ( https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/geometri%c4%8dno_sredi%c5%a1%c4%8de_slovenije ) , what do you see ? 
  1 ) goverments change all the time 2 ) i do n't trust a single one of them . 
  and i want the curent one gone asap, 
  1 ) we no longer have any heavy industry worth mentioning ( thanx to you and your eu ) 2 ) take them to the regural hospital - emergency wing . 
  edit : any accident of any kind involving more than 50 people would owerwhel our trauma centers anyway . 
  wich one of my countries :p serbia , as the first country of the new silk road . 
  of course has close ties with china . 
  slovenia exists and does nothing sooooooo, 
  peoples republic of lugansk . 
  they need the money and canon foter, 
  because you blame anything bad on the top goverment . 
  thats how it has always been . 
  even if local goverment ( this works on municipal lewel too ) fucks up , you blame the higher goverment on not preventing it or not fixing it in time . 
   finally , opinions i have read from peoples over the internet . 
  by selfranking of managers in slovenia we are worst of than selfranking of same class of people in places like saudi arabia and sudan . 
  for more & to discus go to r/yugoslavia . 
  http://www.kclj.si/ edit : why do you need a special hospital for burns ? 
  referendum o pokrajinah . 
  awsome turnout . 
  nooane cares about that place . 
  that plant is on a good spot tho xd, 
  luka\u0161enko + russian all there is to know realy . 
  there are n't any inteligent spiders in australia . 
  read the article provided , and you will see it was the other way around . 
  and the way its worded it seems as this would resemble a berlin congres bosnia type thing . 
  where russia would teritorialy own the place while germany whould administer it and have economic benifits . 
   montenegro . 
  why ? 
   san marino because it 's literally the oldest country ( republic ) in the world . 
  actualy ... 
  did n't san marion get a promiss from garibaldy not to be anexied if the alowed him passage or something ? 
  it was done by the local population ( coopting a soviet army ) in the 90s . 
  thats why noone cares . 
  also they have the army the size of moldovas , wich is incredible if you ask me . 
  how can someone not hear of moldova ? 
  of course not . 
  a port so close to germany ? 
  keep that shit . 
  because russia . 
  what in canada ? 
  all the spiders freze up there . 
  * bosnia and hercegovina ( split it up , it will be easier than this shit they have going on now ) * belgium ( older bosnia ) * united germany ( who the fuck had that bright idea ?!!! ), 
  * austria ( why did n't we carve it up like we did witht the rest of the reich ? ), 
  * andora ( how did that happen ? 
  why not in eu still ? ), 
  * transnistria ( man are they determined to keep existing ) * belarous ( might as whell become part of russia ) * czekia & slovakia ( how did that happen ? ), 
  its called hofer here . 
  they lost the war . 
  degree in what ? 
  god knows canada is short on those . 
  if you have such a good degree why not move to the promissed land of australia ? 
  wrong . 
  not if its an impropely done hanging . 
  and noone asks the slovenes ... whell i 'm still gona answer . 
  its an obvious france . 
  what are you an engineer with 10 years of experiance in the feeld ? 
  they will probably throw you out . 
  canadas imigration is stricter and better inforced than that of the usa . 
  if you want a good life for yourself and you previously held position in the us army or goverment i would sugest defecting to dprk . 
  they will give you loads of free shit and your job will be bad acting in propaganda fliks . 
  [ the slovenian army organizes every year a conpetition in shoting with the m-48 long range bolt action rifle . 
  its awsome . 
  its an awsome gun , i want one \\ ( but i ca n't cuz its a military weapon stil !!!!!!!!, 
  ps the title literalery goes : `` this is not a political song '', 
  slovenia is less sing about the `` man '' and more : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3or_bxsx8m ( ' 87 ), 
   from croatia , well , this weird thing wut ? 
  noone cares about albania . 
  i mean its conpletly legal to shoot and eat indangered song birds there so ... 
  and i do n't consider myself a slovenian . 
  but i still vote and am responsible for who runs this republic . 
  because there is actualy no coruption . 
  dont listen to the cia thes thaught tito was a russian and that sadam had nukes . 
  being part of a nationwide argument of who was better , the resistance ( of ) or the nazis . 
  [ like this superior one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piran ) to anything hrvatska has to offer ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ :p, 
  hard to decide , the entire country is the most charming country on the planet . 
  but as a hiker ima go for the mountins , particularely the part of the alps called karavanke . 
  this ^, 
  no , lol . 
   and a likely trump administration xd you elected the guy , no getting around that fact . 
  better than usa whoooo whoo :p suck it ` muricans, 
  erm yes they do . 
  they sign petitions show up at public grous law considerations and protest like crazy . 
  they stopped taizors the last time and are wery prpud of it . 
  interesting . 
  me too . 
  but my old one has a different relef, 
   who knows if cloning technology came sooner and we had a backup of tito ... [ \u041d\u0435\u043a\u043e \u0422\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0430 ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1bflokm9jm )  breeding does n't worry me at all , we 're steady at around 2 million , seems enough for this space . 
  we have an aging populatin and need a way to combat that . 
   i 'll go right ahead and state that we had better social values taught to us in previous system . 
  oh of course we did . 
  we are witnesing the colaps of values right now , alongisede it the colaps of the famely , and soon the whole social structure will colaps . 
   i 'm also not sure how our policemen are trained , i know they can only use firearms for certain crimes . 
  desturbing the populous with a firearm would justify the use of guns for the police . 
  tho due to the type of rounds they use ( fuly jacketed ) he would more likely survive than not . 
  worth noting that the police wants to be isued taizors but organisations like amnesty wont let them . 
  a person with a gun on the street without a reason would of couse be shot by the police . 
  what else are they suposed to do ?
