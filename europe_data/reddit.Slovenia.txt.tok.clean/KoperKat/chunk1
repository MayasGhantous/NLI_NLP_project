for some reason in some parts this sounds like [ a deadringer for another song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=xwe_zmi3hji#t=279 ) . 
  there were a few jokes made on this side of the border what would hayder do if he were n't dead . 
  any likely coalitions ? 
  heard of this . 
  to be honest it generally applies to czechs going mountaineering in the alps wearing white high socks and sandals .

   trgovi\u0161\u010de also a couple of [ stari trg ] ( http://www.stat.si/krajevnaimena/default.asp?txtime=trg&amp;selnacin=kjerkoli&amp;seltip=naselja&amp;cmd=++poi%9a%e8i++ ) s ( as in old market ) . 
  edit : link, 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's non-syrian migrants . 
  it generally means the refugee ca n't be found . 
  but if they were processed their fingerprints are in eurodac which can severely damage your chances for approval in the next eu/eea country . 
  it 's kinda hard to explain how your life was threatened in sweden/finland to the point that you * needed * to switch the country . 
  yeah , we had a few applying , but most of them said they wo n't stay because we 're so poor . 
  and after you 're done , they would even pay for the flight back . 
  and mosquito clouds . 
  shimmering in the evening sun . 
  off topic yes , but saying he 's wrong when it is n't necessarily so wo n't help you any . 
  besides i do n't know why you 're dragging up the 90 's . 
  op is provocating and you 're feeding the troll . 
  yes but my keyboard has \u010d \u0107 \u0161 \u0111 \u017e keys . 
  simple . 
   the holocaust ( from the greek \u1f41\u03bb\u03cc\u03ba\u03b1\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 hol\u00f3kaustos : h\u00f3los , `` whole '' and kaust\u00f3s , `` burnt '' ) , [ 2 ] also known as the shoah ( hebrew : \u05d4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d0\u05d4 , hashoah , `` the catastrophe '' ) , was a genocide in which approximately six million jews were killed by adolf hitler 's nazi regime and its collaborators . 
  [ 3 ] some historians use a definition of the holocaust that includes the additional five million non-jewish victims of nazi mass murders , bringing the total to approximately eleven million . 
  killings took place throughout nazi germany and german-occupied territories . 
  [ 4 ] quote mining much ? 
  i always find it mildly amusing , when non-scientific mags publish sentences such as this ( emphasis added ) :  despite having more data , there was no sign that neanderthals and humans produced viable offspring -- the researchers estimated that `` the neanderthal contribution to modern genetic diversity is zero , '' ** though they acknowledged that this conclusion could change with new evidence ** . 
  i think ludwig 's holy blade in bloodborne can satisfy the smashing instinct of our neanderthal ancestors . 
  just leave the fire paper at home . 
   the discovery of an ancient man with a recent neanderthal ancestor illustrates how quickly the science of stone age humans has changed . 
  really unfortunate subtitle . 
  oh , right ... labour . 
  as in working . 
  that makes the whole thing even sillier . 
  ask for a vegetarian dish in the balkans ... get served a hot dog . 
  completely understandable . 
  i 've read it a few weeks ago when the whole kerfuffle really got going in an article that compared funding of eu , canada , usa and gulf states on a timeline . 
  i have in my head that it was a slovenian source but ca n't find it because of the mountain of recent reportages , opinion pieces and what not . 
  i really want to find it , after all the vast majority of war refugees are still in neighbouring countries kinda forgotten for now . 
  i stand corrected , it slipped my mind . 
  most of the reports i 've read focus on africa ( especially egypt and somalia ) . 
  middle east is sometimes mention while asia kinda gets pushed aside . 
  oceania as a whole is kinda ... just there . 
  and the sad thing is that because of the refugee crisis funding for camps from the eu has diminished ( or so i 've read somewhere ) . 
  and the people in camps are truly disenfranchised citizens with little means and even fewer options while those making the trek to eu are mainly middle class and above . 
  not to mention the funds that will go into investigation and deportation of opportunists mixed into the refugee crowd . 
  fgm is a widespread practice in africa and middle east . 
  religion has little to do with how common it is , it is part of the underlying older culture . 
  however there 's no denying that since it is connected to female chastity and purity , islam embraced it particularly well . 
  it 's almost never mentioned in western media and after i stumbled upon in it a few years back it left me speechless . 
  just a few quotes on the subject and their sources , might get nsfw or nsfl ( for those with a weaker stomach ) [ who : prevalence of fms ( age 15-49 ) by country ] ( http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/prevalence/en/ ) i included country over 80 % of women affected , for more see the source : * djibouti 93,1 % * egypt 91,1 % * eritrea 88,7 % * guinea 95,6 % * mali 85,2 % * somalia 97,9 % * north sudan 90 % [ the who factsheet ] ( http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/ ) and [ overwiev of the topic ] ( http://www.who.int/topics/female_genital_mutilation/en/ )  female genital mutilation is nearly always carried out on minors and is therefore a violation of the rights of the child . 
  the practice also violates the rights to health , security and physical integrity of the person , the right to be free from torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and the right to life when the procedure results in death . 
  there 's also a pretty good [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/female_genital_mutilation )  the who has created a more detailed typology , types i -- iii , based on how much tissue is removed ; type iii is `` sewn closed . '', 
  just to clarify , `` sewn closed '' means that the outer labia are sewn together leaving only a small opening toward the back , creating a narrow hard to clean funnel through which both urine and menstrual blood have to pass and has to be opened for childbirth after which it is often closed again . 
  prevalent in somalia . 
   the who defines type iv as '' [ a ] ll other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes , '' including pricking , piercing , incising , scraping and cauterization . 
  including folk remedies such as [ gishiri cutting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gishiri_cutting ) :  a whole range of gynaecologic complaints , including difficulty in labour , infertility , dyspareunia ( pain during sex ) , pelvic organ prolapse and urinary retention , are believed to be caused by a vagina that is too narrow in these areas . 
  the traditional treatment is to incise the vagina . 
  a long knife is inserted into the vagina and backward cuts from the vagina 's anterior wall into the perineum are made . 
  going back to the wikipedia page you can read that :  ** dahabo musa , a somali woman , described infibulation in a 1988 poem as the `` three feminine sorrows '' : the procedure itself , the wedding night when the woman is cut open , then childbirth when she is cut again . 
  ** despite the evident suffering , it is women who organize all forms of fgm , including infibulation . 
  also [ unicef : report on fgm - pdf version ] ( http://www.unicef.org/cbsc/files/unicef_fgm_report_july_2013_hi_res.pdf ) which is very long . 
  ** tl ; dr ** fgm is a truly awful practice that is n't nearly talked about enough . 
  it 's mainly done on minors in home environment by traditional practitioners ( with exception of egypt ) . 
  it is painful for women and represents a significant risk to their health and well being , while also increasing infant mortality . 
  edit : formating, 
  well , duh . 
  but a center is not a prison . 
  restricting their movement to a building or center is illegal as far as i 'm aware . 
  so the police could be doing the sisyphus work of busing hundreds of migrants back to centers every day with them leaving again as soon as they get a meal and some rest . 
  is n't it much easier to check them on the border as they are left in ? 
  no cooperation no crossing . 
  a much better position to have them comply with the demand of host country then once they are inside , fed , rested and with no really immediate consequence to noncooperation . 
  the problem is that most countries can not lawfully restrict movement of a migrant but can restrict movement through its borders . 
  for instance once the migrants are in camps/refugee centers our police can not physically prevent them from walking off . 
  but they can physically restrain a person from crossing the border . 
  honestly i would take an ambitious immigrant over a disgruntled refugee any day of the week . 
  i just wish we would have a reliable harmless way to scare the shit out of people ... that usually gets someone swearing in their mother tongue . 
  or a really good orgasm . 
  that 's part of it , while there 's not much money in it it 's till a stable job with better than average paycheck . 
  some just like the idea of being a doctor ... attaching those precious letters to your name , but the worst is parental pressure imho . 
  i 've met a select few who were miserable at the prospect of being doctors but did n't want to disappoint their ( doctor ) parents and high achieving families . 
  funny in slovenia novak is * the * most common last name . 
  hey scots ... what are the city ordinances for someone shouting from a megaphone ? 
  where i live this would probably get you arrested for disruption of public peace and order , no laws on hate speech necessary . 
  my bet is a base jumper wanted to show of with a bit of parkour . 
  remember :  ** sanctions envisaged for those assisting illegal migrants **  anyone assisting a foreigner who has illegally entered slovenia , is travelling through the country or lives here illegally , can be punished with a fine of eur 2,000-4 ,500 and up to five years in prison . 
   people are advised to contact the police if they encounter refugees , so that appropriate procedures can be launched . 
   offering assistance to asylum seekers or persons under international protection is not illegal . 
  sadly , my time in medical school taught me plenty of people join the field of medicine for all the wrong reasons . 
  well then ... ... 
  thanks obama . 
  a friend of mine has family in the north of bih . 
  last years floods were catastrophic and then they got the news that they might not even be able to get back to the house to check the damage for who knows how long because of the mines being flooded in . 
  pretty damn awful situation . 
  and the unload them using human hamster wheels . 
  and outside of bilingual regions being mentioned now and then , we kinda do n't talk with each other . 
  i 've posted this before , [ it might just be the answer you seek ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=s9towic_klu#t=62 ) . 
  even if a country is stable , you can be granted asylum if you can prove institutional discrimination coupled with violence and fear for you life . 
  i 'm pretty sure most eu countries would grant asylum to a rebellious saudi wife if she managed to get out . 
  or an ugandan homosexual .
