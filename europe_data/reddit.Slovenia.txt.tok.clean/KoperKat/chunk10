  do n't like the article . 
  it strangely worded in places graphics representing the agree stance while the other show disagree . 
   on the question of whether their country had taken in enough foreign migrants and whether there was room for more , 35 % of the french completely agreed with this . 
  only 14 % of germans felt the same way . 
  you know you 're rich when you decide to cover the ivory with gold ... 
  for a mindbend read the article as it were a propaganda piece from a * communist * commission announcing the new ^ improved five-year-plan . 
  edit :  `` if we are to restore citizens ' trust in the european project , create jobs and build a competitive economy , and retain an influence in the world , we must unleash the full potential of the single market [ . 
  ] ''  yet the commission is throwing its weight behind the so-called collaborative economy . 
  as part of the strategy , it will develop an agenda for the sector and aims to simplify rules that hinder the growth of startups . 
   `` innovative business models must be encouraged and welcomed into the single market . '', 
  well , today germany did send us 5 policemen to help . 
  well , another reason it was implemented was to protect the seasonal construction workers . 
  some need visas to stay for longer period of time that are dependent on the state of employment which gave a lot of power to the employer . 
  there was a huge fracas with an employer who illegally employed workers for the three month duration of a tourist visa , then at the end refused to pay wages and threatening with police leaving the workers with no way to act . 
  but yeah . . it would be a great feat to completely legislate the scumminess out of a bad employer . 
  true . 
  but this is targeted at grey work economy with the end goal being greater socio-financial security for workers and it 's supposed to scare employers into securing a work agreement that they like instead of the state forcing them to accept a standard one - which can be more burdensome to the employer . 
  it is in the state interest to keep an eye on such employer because the non-employes - which defraud the state by collecting unemployment benefits - are a burden on the state . 
  btw slovenia and portugal are coloured wrong - should be the same shade as austria , germany and switzerland ( which has the wrong shade as well ) . 
  well , i 'm not talking income taxes . 
  there 's a couple of deductibles that you need to pay by law - health insurance , retirement insurance , unemployment insurance - to name some . 
  not paying them is considered tax evasion . 
  dude , you 're arguing a technicality that 's besides the point of conversation with caps . 
  time to let go ... 
  not to mention , wages/salaries are payed into the bank account with taxes directly deducted with each deposit . 
  paying someone cash is pretty much tax evasion . 
  they changed the law around here , that if they catch you * both * have to pay fines and the person must be immediately employed . 
  thus the state gets it 's taxes and the persons status gets sorted out ( more or less ) . 
  well , technically as far as i 'm aware it meant people who do n't speak ( the language ) . 
  and it included people who ca n't speak the language because they are mute and those who do n't know it . 
  supposedly it comes from lat . 
  vindobona . 
  i guess we just took a different part of it . 
  it could also refer to a city on danube , which in slovenian is donava ( adding - a because in slovenian rivers are female ) . 
  even more interesting in serbian danube is dunav , while vienna is be\u010d . 
  yeah , and in slovenian vienna = dunaj, 
  oh horsies are plenty tasty , especially the young ones . 
  [ gcp grey ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84awtseb2-4 ) explains it quite well . 
  yeah ... try getting up at five to catch the bus , start at 7:30 and going home near 18:00 and getting home a bit before eight . 
  at that schedule i did n't see sun for weeks outside of weekends . 
  wo n't miss my last year of uni at all . 
  [ our dear president and juncker seem to get along well . 
  ] ( http://www.delo.si/svet/evropa/junckerjev-nacrt-ustavitev-posiljanja-beguncev-k-sosedam.html ) could n't stop laughing when i saw that . 
   benefit from the tpp toilet paper partnership ? 
  and here you go , just assuming i 'm pro-immigration ... 
  which btw i 'm not . 
  as if this will help with those kind of people . 
  i imagine their logic is as fallows : * swordsman is an islamist  see this what happens when you let terrorists into the country * swordsman is a swede  no wonder people snap when they 're losing their community it really does n't matter either way . 
  the racists will keep on spewing their sewage . 
  even more importantly , it would be easy to discuss the event without picking apart the assailant 's life . 
  watch how in the following day his picture will get splattered everywhere with details of his music taste , ice-cream preference and early life waxed lyrical about while his victims just became a number on some wiki page . 
  and * that * is what upsets me . 
  i think this is a good thing , after all immersion is the best way to learn a language . 
  and for the children the younger they are , easier it is for them . 
  it also helps the teachers enforce their authority , which can be a bit hard if you do n't know what your pupils are snickering about . 
  it might be about that cartoon or it can be something completely inappropriate . 
  i remember something similar from my elementary/high school . 
  [ slovenian is very diverse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovene_dialects#list_of_dialects ) to the point that if you 're speaking in your dialect chances are people living 50km away wo n't understand half of what you say nor you them . 
  so in school `` literally/standard slovene '' was enforced . 
  and it does help , because if you want to get somewhere you should at least know how to express yourself without sounding like a hillbilly . 
  uh ... if that where your mind goes , it 's your problem . 
  besides ... they could just make a statement about a. l. p. the other facts of his deeds would n't change . 
  there 's no need for media to go through his fb and yt accounts to tell people how he liked some type of music and hated another . 
  authoritarian = / = right . 
  ^ this . 
  also the media going rabid about his personal life always make me sick . 
  i mean ... do we * really * need to know that he liked heavy metal and hated hip-hop . 
  i really * really * wish they would n't publicize his name . 
  f that kind of fame . 
   a large number of those on board the bus were reported to have been members of an elderly people 's association in the small town of petit-palais-et-cornemps , which has a population of just 700 , as well as from other neighbouring communities . 
  that poor , poor town . 
  and i hug some nearly daily , does n't help much for my dating needs . 
  but what i meant that being a woman i know at least one very well , 
  [ parkour saved the day . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=encbbnyze0e ), 
  let say a south american state falls into war . 
  people start running for canada . 
  you say ok we 'll let them pass and give them food , clothes , medical aid and a place to sleep , but drop them of at this crossing so we know who 's coming into our country and where they come from . 
  two day later , the mexican police is dropping people everywhere on the border , huge number of people in the middle of nowhere in the night . 
  soon you have over two million people per day crossing wherever , scared , cold and dehydrated . 
  ( 12,616 crossed yesterday alone breaking the hungarian record , 5116 today before noon ) now ... 
  i wonder what kind of words you 'd use ? 
  i think i 've met myself plenty ... 
  on the radio they were saying that the austrian police brings back to the centre anyone going out on their own and putting them back on the tail of the waiting lists . 
  apparently it also works if you tell them when they get restless to settle down or no more buses will come . 
  can any austrian confirm ? 
  rough translation : ** 0:00 ** the night footage of the slovenian police which we acquired clearly shows how on tuesday night the croats brought a train with approx . 
  1500 refugees to the train station sutla . 
  ** 0:14 ** they unloaded the refugees and they were then escorted by the police into the immediate area of slovenian border . 
  ** 0:21 ** croatian police did n't announce the arrival of the train to their slovenian colleagues . 
  we can see on the footage the croatian policemen leading the group step aside and show the general direction by which they can reach slovenian territory . 
  ** 0:35 ** * more details by gregor dernov\u0161ek * ** 0:39 ** despite all the statements of croatian politicians - that the communication with slovenia is open and that croatia does not let the refugees to cross the border unsupervised - this footage says it all . 
  ** 0:48 ** a little after 22:00 the train with refugees arrived at the train station sutla . 
  ** 0:56 ** the river of refugees then proceeds through the village toward the border . 
  it 's interesting that the croatian police is leading the group . 
  they [ the refugees ] are hurrying as if they wished to escape from someone . 
  ** 1:02 ** the group is steered by the police . 
  on the end of the village the policemen step aside and off the road , clearly showing some of the refugees the direction . 
  ** 1:11 ** the refugees then ran to the slovenian side where there is no police present at that moment . 
  ** 1:21 ** the refugees are left to their own devices .
