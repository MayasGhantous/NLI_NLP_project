  as can be seen they are running across the fields with no clear direction looking for the right way . 
  ** 1:30 ** farther away near rigonce they are intercepted by the slovenian police . 
  ** 1:34 ** so it seem this is the protocol used by croatia every night . 
  for anyone interested [ link to the official updating page on refugee situation of ** the slovenian police in english ** ] ( http://www.policija.si/eng/index.php/component/content/article/13-news/1729-a-new-webpage-on-police-activities-re-current-migration-flows-set-up-available-informations ) : as of 18:00 there are 3917 accommodated refugees and 3569 refugees undergoing registration . 
  the police are registering and photographing them in reception centers before driving them to an accommodation center . . 
  so . . some spies are smarting after they exes wo n't return their calls . 
  ... except for snooker matches . 
  i find them very soothing . 
  yeah but even just going by economies of the countries poland has a bigger impact than greece . 
  if someone asked me to compare , i 'd say not having poland is a bigger loss that greece within a heartbeat . 
  i had two links from delo removed , despite putting a quoted translation into the comments , because it was low quality and uninformative . 
   two boatloads of migrants came ashore at a british military base on cyprus on wednesday , authorities said , the first time since the crisis began that refugees have landed directly on what is considered british sovereign soil . 
  well , this is interesting ... 
  sooooo for traffic emissions , did they correct the rates for the latest diesel car snafu ? 
  * cough * volkswagen * cough *, 
  tb is actually on the rise , not overtly but still . 
  it pops up when socio-economic status falls . 
  i swear  but yeah , i meant schools . 
  oh , i would n't mind dismantling catholic churches . 
  [ creationism ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/mar/25/schools.education2 ) being on the rise and all . 
  schengen is about abolition of internal borders between member states . 
  you can cross borders between member states anywhere you wish without the need to bring out your id . 
  on the other side coming to/from the outer border of slovenia/hungary or any other border state you 'll be stopped and need to show your identification like in the old days . 
  croatia is n't part of schengen ... yet . 
  step one for solving this problem in the long run imho would be to convert religious schools into public ones with mixed students . 
  damn you 're right , fixing it right away . 
  and they had mexico for a time . 
  what if bavaria - for instance - wanted firmer outer border control ? 
  asking just out of curiosity on bureaucracy involved . 
  i mean it 's surprising because , * you know * , it 's erjavec . 
  he 's a good indicator of how the wind is blowing in the cabinet i suppose . 
  i just wonder what sparks will fly , if we eventually end up fencing up the istrian part of the border . 
  * actually * , in eea i believe . 
  the question is how long does a smartphone 's battery with gps on work ? 
  cuz stirring up the balkans went so well for europe in the last century . 
  across green borders . 
  green borders with wetlands and a river that have seen days of constant rain the last week . 
  yeah , surprisingly even erjavec has been calling for fence and closed border for some days now . 
  i do n't know . 
  probably right now no-one does . 
  but we 're tiny , with 2 million people that means we would have more refugees per capita than germany in a few days . 
  we usually have a dozen or so asylum seekers per year , so rare that half the time they make it into the news and people gather funds to help . 
  but on the bright side , at least today the sun is shining . 
  it 's rain season for slovenia so that 's something . 
  delo is * the most * reliable news paper . 
  it 's by far the most read ( aside yellow and gossip magazines ) . 
  however it is left leaning so political editorials usually reflect that . 
  but i doubt right leaning newspapers would be kinder anyway . 
  edit : here 's a video of the event and another article on [ 24ur ] ( http://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/hrvati-ne-obvescajo-okoli-1000-beguncev-pri-prehodu-rigonce-prek-zelene-meje-v-slovenijo.html ) . 
  * * brussels should take note of croatia knowingly sending refugees past the slovenian border control in to the swamps by the river sotla *  rigonce - v\u010deraj ob 23.22 so hrvati na postajo sutla tik pred rigonce nenapovedano pripeljali nov vlak s 1000 begunci in jih preko zelene meje poslali v - temo in mo\u010dvirje . 
  mnogi tujci so do glave zabredli v vodo . 
  rigonce - croats parked an unannounced train with 1000 refugees yesterday at 23:22 at sutla just ahead of rigonce and sent the refugees across the green border into water and darkness . 
  many of them found themselves in the water reaching up to their neck . 
  we 'll know sometime today , if all have managed to reach the policemen . 
  the police then escorted the group to bre\u017eice . 
  at least for this train the police was somewhat prepared . 
  unlike the first train which brought 1300 from the tovarnik on the border with serbia directly to the border of bre\u017eice municipality ( slovenia ) instead of ferrying them to \u010cakovec ( croatia ) . 
  even so a small group of foreigners managed to cross the border before the police arrived and tried to run across the field and rain filled dead ends of river sotla towards bre\u017eice . 
  however soon after that they - soaked to the bones - started to turn back and join the main group held together by the police . 
  `` a lot of people went on , maybe a hundred of them . 
  some with babies '' , said a refugee soaked up to his elbows and wearing only sandals even at the 8 degrees above zero temperatures . 
   '' vse , vse sem izgubil , `` se je pred teve kamerami zjokal visokorasli mo\u0161ki star okoli 40 let : '' vse je ostalo v vodi , denarnica , potni list , ves moj denar . `` `` everything , i lost everything , '' cried a tall man aged around 40 years in front of the cameras : `` everything is in the water , my wallet , my passport and all my money '' . 
  police escorted him and a friend to the main group of refugees and then out of it separated a young five-months-pregnant woman who started to feel abdominal pain during the hustle of the group . 
  em squad checked her over however after about half an hour they took two other pregnant women to the hospital in bre\u017eice . 
  a little after one in the morning - more then two and a half hours after leaving the train - the group started moving through rigonce , lo\u010de and mostec toward the bre\u017eice centre eight kilometers away . 
  in the afternoon people from the first train needed two and a half hours for the trip on foot . 
  in the second wave there was - despite the late hour - a lot children on their feet and in the arms of their parents numerous babies . 
  we unofficially asked the policemen present why the refugees need to walk long into to the night . 
  and why they could n't be picked up by buses at the lighted bus stop by the border crossing 1,5 km away . 
  the policemen had no answer . 
  croats have - in addition to 2300 refugees on the train - sent past the schengen border check point in the area of ore\u0161je another 700 migrants . 
  slovenian police caught up with them at a graveyard in bizeljsko and escorted them on buses into the interior of the country . 
  together with 500 refugees crossing the obre\u017eje broder check point - for the decision makers in ljubljana surprisingly , for the people in posavje merely unannounced - the total of people crossing into slovenia yesterday reached 3500 . 
  after we 've made place for them they could n't eat since their hands were shaking so badly from the cold '' , said one of the volunteers : `` slovenia is so well prepared , that in the second wave there was n't enough tents on the most crossed border check point . ''  o nekoliko druga\u010dni pripravljenosti samosvoje hrva\u0161ke , ki je begunce sredi no\u010di mimo slovenskih varuhov \u0161engenske meje na\u010drtno po\u0161iljala v mo\u010dvirje in s tem ogro\u017eala njihova \u017eivljenja , pa bi se moral zamisliti tudi uradni bruselj . 
  brussels should take note of the stubborn croatia sending refugees past the established schengen check point into the swaps in the middle of the night , endangering their lives . 
  slovenian-croatian border is far from the only on to cause tension between neighbours due to absence of united eu refugee policy . 
  edit : corrections + added ( countries ) for a couple of landmark to make it a bit clearer + fixing the 4th paragraph ( temperatures ), 
  oh , i know . 
  it 's just that when you listen to some of this people they believe it 's a morally good thing . 
  and when i talk indoctrination , i usually refer to the brainwashing let 's - make-sure-you-respect-authority kind of teaching . 
  there * is * a difference imho . 
  but i wo n't deny that the line is blurry like a mountain in a blizzard . 
  well ... 
  i would never willingly move to country like saudi arabia , so me raising children in one would only happen if i was born there . 
  and tbh who knows what my morals would be in that situation . 
  and well ... 
  i understand what reasons they have for homeschooling , i just do n't think they 're very good or beneficial to their children in the long run . 
  why do hateful people always thin indoctrination is a * good thing * ? 
  it does n't really matter whether it 's [ child martyr in afghanistan ] ( https://youtu.be/condtucrxdu?t=11m17s ) , hitler jugend defending the front or [ fundies in the usa ] ( https://youtu.be/oy_u4u7-cn8?t=9m32s ) . 
  i can . 
  but only because the guy irks me . 
  he led the anti-abortion movement in the ep for a while . 
  eh , it 's self reported and you have no idea of the distribution of the respondents . 
  beside which most of the crime , environmental and other statistic are based on how people * feel * and not on objective standards . 
  ** highlights from [ the live updating article from slovenian delo , pictures and all ] ( http://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/ponoci-v-slovenijo-novi-begunci-avstrija-jih-bo-sprejemala-se-naprej.html ) : ** over the weekend 5100 refugees crossed into slovenia , 4 asked for asylum , the rest left or will be leaving for austria . 
  yesterday evening six buses with 300 refugees arrived at the bre\u017eje border crossing , but were turned away because they did n't fulfill conditions that would allow them to enter the country . 
  after slovenia refused to take the second train yesterday evening croatia evacuated the train and sent refugees on foot towards the closed border crossing ( at about 2am ) while turning the empty train back . 
  during the night it rained and refugees burned branches and blankets to keep warm . 
  at around 4:30 border control let women and children cross . 
  one was driven to hospital where she 's given birth ( and now want to join her family at the \u0160entilj crossing into austria ) .
