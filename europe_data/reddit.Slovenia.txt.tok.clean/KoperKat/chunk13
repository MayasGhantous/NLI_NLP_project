  is it slovenian , slovak , serbian ? 
  i hope you know your tri-colors . 
  i 'm a harry potter nerd and i had to check some names since they get translated ( mcgonagall  mchudurra , slytherin  spolzgad ) in slovenian version and found a side by side translation comparison side . 
  aaaanyway , there was a uk  usa option since it turns out that perfect tenses were turned to their simple counterparts for usa distribution . 
  well it 's not like it 's to get you drunk . 
  at that age i got a finger of champagne in the flute at new years and a sip or two of blessed wine on easter . 
  after that grandpa would let me sip out of his wineglass and talk about what i 'm tasting . 
  basically i was allowed a taste every now and then . 
  my problem is n't protesting it 's the protesting * with children * part . 
  and they 've said that they 've skipped breakfast and lunch . 
  as an adult you can go on a hunger strike for whatever reason you wish , but do n't bring minors into it . 
  i actually have a cookbook from great great aunt with a roasted squirrel recipe . 
  it reads : '' prepare the squirrel as you would a dormouse '' . 
  where i live you ca n't get them in a general store , but go next door to the hobby/garden/appliance / technical store and there they are . 
  it 's very similar in slovene - '' * trdoglavost * '' and if someone is being hard headed just because , we say that he is '' * potrucan * '' . 
  but it 's not a literary slovene word . 
  iraq war after 9/11 ? 
  / s seriously tough , depending on the country religion still has a foothold in some european countries . 
  look at [ ireland 30 years ago ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwkugqtwdow ) or [ italy even today ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sabina_guzzanti ) . 
  or the [ yugoslavian break up ] ( http://www.religioustolerance.org/war_koso.htm ) , while religion was n't in the forefront of it at all , you ca n't forget the fact that the nationalities ( croat-catholic , bosnian-muslim , serb-orthodox ) have very distinct majorities . 
  now i know where to hunt for my booklist next time i run out of ideas . 
   `` we need more europe , '' merkel said in her speech . 
  `` we need , more than ever before , the coherence and cohesion that we have shown in the past . '' uh , when was that again ? 
  coherence , cohesion and europe do n't exactly go toghether . 
  well , of course . 
  we are all pretty good friends ( 3 guys , 7 women ) so it was kinda awkward to scold your * adult lab partner * about cleaning up after himself . 
  but he is n't stupid , so he would do everything soooo slowly and since you ca n't leave , others would do his stuff around him so work would n't fall behind . 
  eventually tas noticed and had words with him since lab comportment ( i think that what you would call it ) can be a reason you fail or get a low grade things changed . 
  for a while ... 
  no , not really . 
  the whole antireligion thing comes from marxism . 
  religion is the opium of the masses and all that . 
  but yugoslavia was as much under soviet influence as it was under western influence . 
  ever heard where the expression * third world countries * comes from ? 
  the most homophobic person i know is a guy from an atheistic military family . 
  it 's a matter of machismo for him . 
  most catholics i know , are pretty much * meh * on the topic . 
  as long as there 's no french kissing in the public , but that goes for straight couples too . 
  wait , what ? 
  soviets were never in power in the balkans . 
  communist rule ? 
  yes . 
  nope . 
  i think [ the president of ex-muslims of america ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdir3ghxszo ) explains it well . 
  according to him in islam the laws for muslims are as as tied to the faith as they were for jews of the old testament . 
  the new testament is more vague and philosophical , it even preaches separation of church and civil matters while both islam and the old testament celebrate and embrace theocracy . 
  faith trumps lay government . 
  yup , same here . 
  was in a lab group with a muslim guy who refused to clean stations ( we did it on rotation as part of learning protocol of maintaining uncontaminated work surfaces ) because it 's woman 's work to clean and there were women in our group . 
  talked about faith based reasons for it . 
  edit : missing word, 
  these [ statistics on different believes ] ( http://www.atheoryofus.net/islam-statistics/ ) in article form may be somewhat old ( 2013 ) and long but it is a very troubling read . 
   delving deeper into the moral views of both sharia and non-sharia supporters , research by pew indicates that 40 % of the roughly 1124 million muslims in the countries the question was asked support the execution of anyone who commits apostasy by abandoning faith in islam . 
  this translates into just over 454 million people who hold this view . 
  *  in the case of adultery , the applicable percentage is 52 % , or the equivalent of roughly 581 million people , who favor execution as the punishment . 
   asked about corporal punishments , like the amputation of hands for crimes such as theft , statistics drawn from the data suggest that 51 % , or 570 of 1124 million muslims , are in favor . 
  needless to say , all three of these statistics are immensely concerning . 
  edit : quoting, 
  and where is dear gino flaim now , i wonder ? 
  contemplating the nature of sin with the carmelite nuns ? 
  and then there 's [ these idiots ] ( https://youtu.be/7ltmzjz2fgk ) driving on closed roads during hurricane level burja or bora - 235 km/h . 
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coufcyzfg70 yes !, 
  i knew there was a finely bearded policeman somewhere in this video . 
  wanted to post exact same comment . 
  skiing , winter markets with mulled wine and thermal baths ... ca n't beat that . 
  let 's not forget [ vampi ] ( http://www.slovenskenovice.si/sites/slovenskenovice.si/files/styles/s_610_x/public/imported-images/media/picture/20111112/vampiposlovensko.jpg?itok=6klbd9b0 ) - sliced and cooked cow stomach in a stew . 
  and one of my favorite soup garnishes - spleen dumplings ( can be made with liver ) - vrani\u010dni \u017eli\u010dniki . 
  in slovenia tatarc is an extremely popular new year 's dish . 
  served with butter and warm toast . 
  i would say the problem comes from people with mental problems trying to self medicate because they do n't have access to affordable care . 
  people that are in pain , the general availability of drugs . 
  coupled with criminalization of small amount drug possession and severely underfeed support system for quitting the habit ( aa is an incredibly dishonest program with little to no professional support ) result in deeper problems . 
  and then you see them going through austria , germany , denmark to sweden . 
  get unhappy and move to finland and back to sweden again . 
  but in the end we 're smaller countries , where everyone knows someone who knows someone . 
  suppressing journalism does n't mean the information does n't spread . 
  the history with ottoman empire does n't help either . 
  the infighting proves just how long grudges are held in the balkans . 
  i think it 's a bit more obvious with women apostates tough . 
  especially if the family is observant . 
  oh , ok we have a similar law , but it does get disregarded for certain minorities and i do n't think that 's right . 
  i see this as child neglect since it ultimately hurts their chances of social integration and work eligibility and leads to greater cultural segregation ( it 's not like they 'd be warmly welcomed in their parent 's country either ) but everyone seems to focus on the hurt feelings of parents . 
  i was comparing it [ to my reality ] ( http://www.gzs.si/images/clanki/img29487.bmp ) . 
  my grandpa living in the flatlands comes close to official figures when driving on sunny days . 
  it 's just google translate . 
  this is n't surprising in the least . 
  on every advertisement there 's a * nexto to the figure and below - * under factory conditions * . 
  that means a car running at a constant optimal pace straight ahead on a level plane ... 
  i 'm not even sure they stimulate drag , so of course that 's the absolute minimum a car would need to cover that distance . 
  i do think education should be mandatory . 
  especially for children , since it 's much easier to become fluent in a language at a younger role and lets not forget that schools also play a role of raising citizens . 
  i remember pestering my parents about water conservation and recycling since at the time there was a big push in the country towards it and they included special projects for children in school . 
  and it would be helpful if there were a mandatory course for * all * adults also . 
  if they do n't comply , they should be risking a negative decision and someone should explain to them that once you 're in eurocap seeking an asylum in another eu/eea country is n't really a possibility . 
  well , i ca n't speak for them but slaughtering a pig in winter time was basically a small family holiday ( * koline * ) . 
  i remember when i was little the family would get together , a butcher would come and it would be a very busy afternoon . 
  almost everything from the animal was used up . 
  it would go pretty quick since everyone knew what to do , great grandma really had a talent to lure the animal out of the sty while keeping it half lulled to sleep and docile . 
  it would end up with fresh bone soup , fried blood , a dish made from saved blood sausage fillings , sometimes fried livers and onions ( with fresh white bread ) or scrambled eggs with brains ( to this day one of my fav breakfast options ) . 
  fresh brains with scrambled eggs ... the breakfast of champions .
