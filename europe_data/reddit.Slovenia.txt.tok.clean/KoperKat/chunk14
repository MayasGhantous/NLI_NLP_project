  my mum and grandmum would save them for me when i was little . 
  sorry , but any ex-yu country named together with official lustration in a sentence is kinda laughable . 
  the government agencies do n't like to be honest and transparent in internal affairs at their very best , but in our situations ... not going to happen . 
  you could call an italian * lah * instead of * italijan * but it 's really a derogatory name . 
  there 's a town with a brewery named [ * la\u0161ko * ] ( http://www.politikis.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/lasko_1355305515.jpg ) after the tribe . 
  31st in slovenia is also a state holiday - day of the reformation . 
  even tough were a catholic nation , protestantism was important for the literacy of rural communities and development of slovene written word . 
  anyway it 's also a day of remembrance for wwii victims - in and effort to lower religiosity , the socialist government renamed it the day of the dead . 
  people would gather at wwii memorials , school choirs would sing and survivors would read letters . 
  this kinda still stayed on as a school event after the formation of the new country in the 90 's and i remember old people reading last letters written to them by close family members shot in the celjski pisker prison ( [ nsfw picture that comes to mind ] ( http://www.rtvslo.si/slike/photo/138819/ ) ) , usually in retaliation for resistance sabotage ( they shot suspect civilians when soldiers died in clashes with the partisans ) . 
  halloween has become kinda a party night for the high-school and student crowd . 
  but honestly , it just feels wrong to go partying on the 31st . 
  especially since in my family it 's the day you go visit graves of relatives in other towns and it 's on the 1st that you visit your own . 
   i think its simply that the argument at its core is : the baseline for politeness and ` positive attitudes ' is that much higher , so even a negative will be a slight positive and a positive will be made to be a huge positive . 
  oh , dear god . 
  i 'm pretty sure the absolute highest praise one can get in slovenian from friends and family is `` ni slabo '' - * not bad * . 
   it 's made of white wine and ora it 's called * mi\u0161-ma\u0161 * , though it 's more often mixed with fanta - my cousins preferred deit actually . 
  i 'm pretty sure everyone here also knows what * bambus * is . 
  also popular are * \u0161pricer * ( wine + mineral water , especially with the older crowd and as a workers drink , also called * brizganec * or but you 'd more oftenly heat * \u0161kropec * - white wine whit just a bit of miner water ) and * bevanda * ( wine + regular water ) . 
  yeah , [ we lost a few too ] ( http://museums.si/sl/collection/object/9361/skupina-deklic-saldenburg-nemcija-1943 ) . 
  the clinch ? 
  [ baby blond ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blond#relation_to_age ) is really super common here . 
  i was flaxen til 10 years of age and a brunette before high-school . 
  in slovenian it masculine . 
  at least it 's declined by 1 . 
  masculine declination - nom . 
  first year working , have 30 payed days of vacation . 
   [ ... ] ranking included countries and regions with population of at least five million [ ... ] screw you bloomberg . 
  on a side note , bullshit parameters . 
  and by law you need a spare bulb in the trunk as well ... 
  offended by upside cross ? 
  [ you ca n't catholic . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cross_of_st._peter ) * smh *, 
  for one i still have nightmares of blind maps of rivwrs in europe * shudder *, 
  eh , i 'm not trying to be mean . 
  i live in a pretty good neighbourhood but the problem with renovation is that you need the consensus of apartment owners . 
  substantial subsidies are a nice carrot with the new fees for the non-compliant being a pretty big stick . 
  do n't get me wrong it was still expensive in the thousands for each owner but people did reluctantly get on board . 
  now the whole part of town is nice and shiny because , of course , after the first comes the neighbour envy factor ... 
  do i see the windows sitting just a bit deeper ? 
  is this new fasade isolation layer per eu initiative on energy conserving housing ? 
  sweet , sweet eu euros :d most apartment building around me ~ ~ are getting ~ ~ have been renovated too - eu and state are contributing if you comply with new green guidelines . 
  we have a pretty strong caf\u00e9 culture . 
  one of well known jokes about ex-pats in us is that saying : `` let 's go for a coffe ... '' is an invitation to order shit because you 're volunteering to be the starbucks mule . 
  i do love fresh grilled trout though . 
  why leave us out ? 
  it 's also in eu interest to see the tax collected , since it means higher revenue to the eu budget and less direct financial aid ireland can apply for . 
  it 's on the university then . 
  immunity does n't give rights to an education , uni should have disciplined academically . 
  yeah , we had to sort it out in an alphabet war of 1831-1833 . 
  at least we got some [ funny poetry ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/france_pre%c5%a1eren_-_%c4%8crkarska_pravda.jpg/250px-france_pre%c5%a1eren_-_%c4%8crkarska_pravda.jpg ) out of it . 
  yeah , we have \u0161 , \u010d and \u017e ( but no y or w ) . 
  and we usually do n't bother with \u02d8 , ` or \u00b4 . 
  with the sole exception of j\u00e9 ( he/she/it is eating ) as oposed to je ( he/she/it is ) . 
  otherwise just leave it to the context . 
  poland has an incredibly weird alphabet , phonology is n't that strange . 
  we all have clusters to like : vzbrst ( bud ) , \u010dmrlj ( bumblebee ) , smrt ( death ) , \u0161kr\u017eat ( cicada ) , even \u017eol\u010d - not including a host of compound words . 
  or every school-boy 's favourite tongue twister :  pik\u010dasta pti\u010dka v pik\u010dasti kletki . 
  it 's those damn cz , sz clusters - why not use * stre\u0161ica * like reasonable people ... 
  we have vocational high-schools as well , you can be : an auto-mechanic , a gold-smith , a builder , a hair-stylist , a cook , a day-care worker , a nurse , a cosmetic tech , a photographer , a musician , a ~ ~ farmer ~ ~ agricultural tech , a computer tech and so on ... after finishing a vocational school you can get higher education , but if you want to get a uni . 
  to your dipl . 
  whatever you generally need to take and additional year and sit the regular matura . 
  or if you are a boss , sign up to sit the regular instead of vocational matura in your senior year at your own peril . 
  the laws are the way the are because a student job is n't supposed to be a full time employment . 
  i was luckily a student in a specialised profession that 's in demand . 
  the pay was good and work experience pretty decent and applicable down the road . 
  eternal students are a slowly dying breed . 
  at least the ones in their fourth decade of meandering on this earth . 
  recent laws have been punishing - but mostly also incredibly awful for overachievers . 
  as always i think they 're going about it the wrong way - the unis should have end semester attendance minimums ( not on lectures because we 're not high-school , but on lab and seminar work and other prerequisites for sitting the exam ) . 
  these student are mill-stones around everybody else 's in higher education , but the state is n't really making reforms that would affect people in their early 20-ies . 
  after all it 's a pretty good way to keep youth un-employment of those under 25y down . 
  good for the metrics . 
  such a mess . 
  yeah , i 've read it . 
   gt does french and german surprisingly well . 
  my language - or most slavic languages at that - not so much :( it could be bias since seeing a gted article from slovenian to english makes my brain echo both languages at the same time . 
  by the rules - as i understand them - google translate is insufficient . 
  however you 're encouraged to post a tl ; dr with relevant info from the article . 
  hopefully it 's an easier read than gts syntactic abomination . 
  who 's the author ? 
  i hit the paywall and ca n't see who wrote it . 
  a lot of people here use solar heated water , so when you see panels on the roof it might not be for electricity . 
  so true . 
  only missing a kid with some ice-cream . 
  yeah ... damn , me and acronyms do not get along . 
  ~ ~ sazu ~ ~ sazas is ours in all it 's glory . 
  : / edit : thanks , lxxxvi, 
  but it might lead to the cry wolf effect . 
  if they keep it up without cause and something serious happens , will anyone be listening ? 
   they concreted their hands totally / s , right ? 
  right ?!? 
  these people make me mentally curl up into a ball and recite poe 's law over and over and over ... 
  if i had gold , you 'd have it right now . 
  quran ( 2:191 -193 ) - `` and kill them wherever you find them , and turn them out from where they have turned you out . 
  and al-fitnah [ disbelief or unrest ] is worse than killing ... quran ( 4:89 ) - `` they but wish that ye should reject faith , as they do , and thus be on the same footing ( as they ) : but take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of allah ( from what is forbidden ) . 
  but if they turn renegades , seize them and slay them wherever ye find them ; and ( in any case ) take no friends or helpers from their ranks . 
  quran ( 8:12 ) - `` i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve . 
  therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them '' [ and many , many , more examples .
