  i do n't know how it is in france , but here red cross does have a sea-side resort they sent disadvantaged children ( as a summer camp ) and i think they have a program for families as well . 
  the state supports the ngo programs like this at least in part . 
  it 's strongly believed that every child should experience a sea-side holiday with swimming and beaches at least once in their life-time . 
  i had a couple of school-mates back in elementary school that went a couple of times . 
  can confirm . 
  meh . . it makes for a precise language , feel pretty great about it all . 
  they 're the southern step-child of germany . 
  totally checks out . 
  same here  just finished this week :d, 
  nominally 0 here for regular students . 
  you do have to pay the 24 something $ at the beginning of each year for administrative costs . 
  if i remember right from my public health course , workless household is considered more at risk since it could mean that all ( adult ) members are unemployable ( lack of skills , communication and language skill , disabilities , . . ) , are not actively seeking employment ( idleness can lead to social malaise and isolation from the community - less sturdy social network ) and generally have statistically a harder time bettering their financial situation . 
  a working household has better chances of getting better employment in the future . 
  same with us . 
  some were brought here by the ex-yu goverment to work ( for example the planned minning city velenje [ in 1960 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/rudarsko_naselje_velenje_1960_\\ ( 5 \\ ) . jpg ) and [ now ] ( http://www.burger.si/velenje/slikavelenje1.jpg ) ) by the busload . 
  the other big group are refugees from the bosnian war . 
  there are some integration problems with the second/third generation , probably a lot of it has to do with the socio-economics of uprooting lots of working class people for grand state plans . 
  if you want tuition free look into our lovely country . 
   humanities are usually easy because they see a lot of exchange student . 
  however if you 're studying science , medicine or pharmacy be prepared to need to personally hash your schedule out for some courses with the student tutor and the respective professor . 
  besides student accommodation and transport are subsidized . 
  as well as student meals in hundreds of restaurants - you get as many digital `` tickets '' as there are working days . 
  in a registered restaurant ( or some fast food places ) you get a meal of appetizer ( usually soup ) , main course , salad and fruit for dessert . 
  max cost is 4.50-ish , but i 'd only pay that in a nice asian-fusion place near the parliament . 
  they serve this delicious mini spring rolls next to a sweet-spicy chili dip in addition to the soup . 
  i 've eaten a whole home-style dinner for 80 cents in maribor before . 
  fast food options are from 0 outside the capital to 2 euro at the more popular places ( mcdonalds ) . 
  you can also call for a take-away or have pizza delivered to a park and have a nice picnic for below 3 euro . 
  the exploration of restaurants for low cost is probably one of the best things about being a student in ljubljana ( or slovenia ) . 
  you just need to remember to walk your bike home after partying because you can get ticketed for drunk driving while pedaling . 
  relevant username * and * flair , 
  i 'm a metal-head so most of my favorite music is unrelatable for most people . 
  even so pretty much anything by korpiklaani is great drinking party music . 
  however one of the most beautiful love songs is imho ** [ adi smolar - dale\u010d , dale\u010d , je za naju pomlad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an-te5jnikk ) ** unfortunately it has a lot to do with the lyrics . 
  it 's supposedly sung by and old man : danes stara sva in siva , today we 're old and grey , pozna se te\u017eko breme let . 
  the heavy burden of years shows . 
  postala sva tako ranljiva , we 've become so vulnerable , mnogo prehiter je za naju svet . 
  the world is way too fast for us . 
  najine poti so kratke , our paths are short , le redkokdaj \u0161e greva kam . 
  only seldom we go anywhere . 
  she 's everything i 've got . 
  chorus : dale\u010d , dale\u010d je za naju pomlad , far , far for us is spring leta prinesla so jesen . 
  the years have brought autumn . 
  far , when i was saying to the girl : `` i love you . '', 
  and when i was her boyfriend . 
  i ache for the past a ne bi hotel sam postati spet mlad , but i would n't want to become young again alone , raje star sem , star in z njo . 
  i prefer being old , old and with her . 
  govoriva si spomine , we talk of memories , mnogo vsega je bilo . 
  there was a lot of everything . 
  we say : `` how everything passes . '', 
  and we feel a little sad . 
  a nato se nasmejiva , but then we have a laugh , sre\u00e8na , ker sva se na\u0161la . 
  happy , because we 've found each other . 
  kako lepo je , da sva se spoznala how nice it is , that we have met in skupaj skozi \u017eivljenje \u0161la . 
  and went through life together . 
  chorus ura prepodi spomine , the clock drives away the memories , `` greva spat , '' za\u0161epeta . 
  `` let 's go to bed , '' she whispers . 
  trdno me pod roko prime she holds me under my arm firmly in s te\u017eavo vstaneva . 
  and we stand up with difficulty . 
  at night she snuggles up to me . 
  vsak njen dotik tako poznan each touch of her 's so well-known mi pre\u017eene grenko misel : drives away a bitter thought : kdo od naju ostal bo sam . 
  which one of us will remain alone . 
  chorus 2x of course the original flows a better and actually rhymes . 
  however , that makes them economic migrant . 
  slice it anyway you want what they are doing is ** illegal ** . 
  they are leaving safe countries for economic benefits by crossing borders illegally . 
  it 's understandable , but it makes them economic migrants and not refugees . 
  most developed countries have legal ways for refugees to apply for relocation . 
  mass migration leads to chaos and strain on the host countries that ultimately hurts both refugees and citizens . 
  and while i think we have a duty to fellow humans , states have a duty to their citizens first . 
  also there 's the problem of misinformation . 
  for instance in my county it 's almost impossible to get the motion to have family members to join you before a 3 year mark or so . 
  they need to go through asylum process that takes month . 
  get employed and show with past income ( i think it 's either a year or six months ) that they can provide for their family by reaching a certain minimum per family member from the income , that that employment is stable and secure and a properly sized home . 
  they need to accomplish this within a certain frame of time after their asylum is approved and then they can start the process for their wife and/or children that are dependent minors . 
  this make a journey and then family can take a ride is a harmful fairytale . 
  [ cake with the vicar  ] ( https://youtu.be/rmmhuzm22oe?t=4m ), 
  planting flags and with offering the option of cake or death to the natives . 
  i was talking more in the sense that an effective working army comprises of more than just the front-lines . 
  there 's intelligence networks , support , logistics and suppliers that you need . 
  i 'm just saying that someone like me would probably be much useful in an infirmary in the larger scale of things . 
  you need more than fighters to fight a war effectively . 
  an interesting historical case would be [ franja partisan hospital ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franja_partisan_hospital ) . 
  wwii in europe showed resistance can take many different forms . 
  so they choose : * option 4 - leaving all their family behind ; including children , wife , mothers , grandfathers , ... gods knows where to fend for themselves for a few years while they chase an utopia instead . 
  edit : mobile problems . 
   probably they 'll start sending them to croatia [ ... ] that 'll bring us back into the news in all our glory of brotherly love . 
  sooo , basically what yugoslavia was . 
  biologically speaking the reproductive bottleneck are women and not men . 
  which makes them more valuable . 
  even your argument of a men being able to reproduce longer makes them less valuable . 
  tbh there 's a difference between fighting and serving . 
  as a woman with a medical education and little fighting aspiration i can think of a few potentially useful things to do aside grabbing a firearm and shoot . 
  well , their fellow middle eastern rich countries are n't taking them either . 
  quatar ? 
  the emirates ? 
  apparently the cultural divide is too great to accept the refuges . 
  or the last picture :  [ a statue of christ on the crucifix is visible from the hungarian side of the border ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/2889/production/_90377301_dsc09197.jpg ) what 's the point of that ? 
  i think you 're right . 
  that 's our problem - `` najprej \u0161tal ` ca , pol pa krav ` ca . '',
