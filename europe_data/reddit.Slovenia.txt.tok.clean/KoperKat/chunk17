  and then tanked with the previous ambassador who thought it to be a good idea to comment to the newspapers and on camera his opinion on how our country should be run and how stupid our legislature is ... got a reprimand from our president to keep out of our internal affairs and he was gone soon after . 
  i do n't even remember the name , but damage is still there . 
  the general opinion is that usa are selfish meddlers . 
  these are the [ jesus camp ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc_yzuwifzs ) denomination , right ? 
  imagine if we had no fucking trees . 
  seems a bit far and against the wind ? 
  well , we 're [ orange anyway ] ( http://www.mojaobcina.si/img/1/h_max_1024x768/1_dsc_0779.jpg ) . 
  it instantly reminded me of our [ \u010crni kal viadukt ] ( http://www.slo-foto.net/modules/galerija/data/media/14/7582317637.jpg ), 
  exactly . 
  english test could be * easier * than the mother tongue tests . 
  maybe it 's a sign to educators that the expectations and proficiency goals could be raised . 
  i wanted to ask one of you guys if the metric seems reliable to you . 
  given that were often together on the top part of suicides lists , it made me wonder if drugs are just the preferred method to kill yourself . 
  and if that is the case , could this graph be putting intentional and accidental overdoses together ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nokia_3310 the true legend . 
  nokia around here was/is synonymous with a hard-to-break long-lasting work-horse . 
  imho they could have done well as out of office work phones . 
  i get it . 
  * noreti * sounds better though :p, 
   we did n't need an army patrolling the seas or the land before . 
  so what has changed ? 
  who in their right mind would want to cross the balkans en mass to the west ( or in any direction really ) in the 90 's ? 
  before that you had the delightfully entrenched iron curtain . 
  before that ottoman empire and wwii and wwi and ... 
  same here . 
  we have leaders of the youth left ( my generation ) demanding for abolishment of * all * borders because they inhibit the human right of free movement . 
  the main swing comes imho from the fact that slovenia nearly evaded intervention and it has hit the social support * hard * . 
  ngos are very vocal about the rise of child poverty and socio-financial isolation , but the government says , so sorry , but there 's no money left in the budget . 
  and yet when immigrants come in , money can be found np . 
  these poor people need help after all . 
  this kind of attitude sits heavy in the stomach of your average person . 
  because what about * our * poor people ? 
  visited for a summer a few years back and can confirm . 
  all that sun without the oppressive heat . 
  simply amazing . 
  soooo , how was it in the soviet union ? 
  not sure if / s , but nope - the police disagrees . 
  [ here an article in english ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/613809/european-migrant-crisis-refugees-set-fire-tents-slovenia-selfies-travel-uk-germany ) . 
  [ had one here ] ( http://www.slovenskenovice.si/sites/slovenskenovice.si/files/styles/s_610_x/public/2015/10/21/unnamed.jpg?itok=nbjqwjih ) when the migrant flow was at it 's highest , nothing happened . 
  it basically means they are made out of softer rubber - this means they have a better grip . 
  you can drive winter tyres in the summer but they wear down really fast ( softer + higher temps ) so people exchange them for the ones that are harder . 
  studded ones are not common here , most people also have chains for steeper hills and emergency situations . 
  you 're also allowed chains instead of winter tyres in emergency situations ( icy road in the middle of july or smth ) , but otherwise you need winter tyres and not chains because the later do damage to the road . 
  nope , that would be * anti * theist . 
  atheist does n't have an opinion either way . 
  atheist/agnostic differentiate on the point on wether the opinion is epistemological or ontological , but the common use muddied the waters . 
  to confuse matters even more there are soft and hard atheists . 
  agnostic has been gaining in popularity after the hard-atheists brought negative connotations , with some help from misrepresentation by the fundamentalist religious crowd , to being called atheists . 
  i was deciding between arts and dentistry , this was one of the definite cons for the former . 
  in the end i went with the latter option . 
  it 's so much hard to loose a job to an eager hobbyist ... 
  i think we often forget the values dissonance . 
  at the time most people ( of the middle and higher class ) saw the occasional war as a good thing . 
  a forge that turns boys into men and cleanses the nation of the week , rising up the true patriots and so on . 
  i once asked a twenty-something barmen in trieste if he speaks any foreign languages - he was very proud to announce he 's learning french . 
  [ yes . 
  ] ( http://geographical.co.uk/images/articles/places/mountains/2015/slovenia/isonzo%20walk/valley_shutterstock_126470573.jpg ), 
  not to mention how beautiful the country and the river are . 
  it 's hard to imagine how they got the vr\u0161i\u010d pass built in those conditions . 
  they did shoot part of narnia in so\u010da valley , why not an actual historical war movie . 
  given the geography of the valley it was hard to cross the river either way . 
  and then you 'd have to ~ ~ charge ~ ~ * climb up * those hills . 
  and italians had luigi cadorna who thought re-introducing [ decimation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luigi_cadorna#personal_reputation ) after a loss would be great for ... * morale * ? 
  edit : broken link, 
  it 's kinda sad how so\u010da front is generally left out and forgotten . 
  at least there 's hemingway . 
  there was some speculation at the time that the usa publishers prefer not to use perfect tenses in children 's books . 
  [ past perfect tense ] ( http://ask.metafilter.com/253668/what-has-happened-to-the-past-perfect-tense ) in particular . 
  eliminating tenses would be a simplification of grammar , no ? 
  in my high-school both were presented and you basically choose one or the other ( you were expected to be consistent within a test or an essay ) . 
  the grammar was definitely bre oriented and not ame . 
  being a potter nerd i once looked at comparison of books through different translations and was surprised to see usa on the list . 
  they basically simplified the grammar by replacing perfect tenses with simple and continuous tenses . 
  the reasoning behind it was , that this is a book for children . 
  not to mention sorcerer 's vs philosopher 's stone . 
  if possible i use the uk english spellcheck . 
  i 've always understood adequate as fulfilling minimum requirements/expectations . 
  which is basically the lowest possible point of satisfactory . 
  i think some of it changed over the years . 
  just try to get my parent to talk about `` usmerjeno izobra\u017eevanje '' they tried for a while . 
  well , it 's good to see at least some good news today !, 
  yeah , well back in the mid 90 's people actually got warned no to use * hleb * to describe any kind of bread because it 's a berserk button for croatian ladies working in the little camp stores . 
  honest to goodness a true story on my part . 
  people over 40 learned it in school back in the yugoslavia . 
  my generation knows some from spending summertime in croatia and what not . 
  not to mention a lot of people watch hrtv and listen to turbofolk . 
  i can understand gist of it on tv with little effort , but ca n't speak it without making it sound like i 'm just poking fun . 
  tbh croatian on national tv is way easier than prekmur\u0161\u010dina . 
  i had a roommate from dalmatia one year at uni and we talked our own languages for simple things , but talking for longer than a couple of minutes we 'd just switch to english because it took less effort . 
  similarly when going to croatia i mainly just speak english , i 've had older people get insulted if i try to get something in slovenian or even yelled at if when trying i 'd mistakenly used a ` serbian ' word . 
  it sometimes gets annoying when you get the older generation that has been living here for 30 + years and never learned how to speak slovenian properly and they get insulted when i do n't get what they want from me . 
  telling me i 'm just a stuck-up bitch or smth , when i ask them to repeat themselves . 
  edit : people being irate over language mainly happened to me back in the mid 90 's . 
  which makes it kinda understandable . 
  when i was a kid we used to go to the croatian sea for the summer . 
  i was 5 or 6 . 
  my mum sent me for some bread for lunch and i got yelled at by the counter lady for 5min straight because i asked for a * hleb * . 
  of course i was n't thinking * kruh * but telling the lady i wanted the round one - * hleb * , instead of the oval one - * \u0161truca * . 
  had no idea what i actually did wrong and ran back to mum without empty-handed . 
  slovenes also learned serbo-croatian in elementary school for years with the cyrillic , and it was the official language in the army .
