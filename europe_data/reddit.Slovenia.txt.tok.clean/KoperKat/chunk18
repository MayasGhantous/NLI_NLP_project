  both languages , slovenian and serbo-croatian , were official and used in the parliament but only the latter was official in the army . 
  oh , and serbs and croats did n't learn slovenian in school . 
  yeah , but were the special ones !, 
  slovenian is a south-slavic language . 
  he 's armenian , not american ... 
   to stop the feared hordes , the swiss are threatening to call out the army ( yes , switzerland has an army ) . 
  no shit that the swiss have an army . 
  gmo is n't so much an issue of being safe to eat , but how it affects farmers , the market and production process . 
  or is one of those poor sops that has video pre-load/play automatically on in the app settings + running gps non-stop since he might loose the location of his own head otherwise . 
  i know that . 
  i 'm just pointing out another factor that makes designing such a website harder in the eu . 
  you can check the buyers area against their address in checkout , but just for browsing it could cause a lot of problems , what with vpns , buyers travelling and sending things home or to friends in other countries , vendor having multiple shipping locations supplying different areas . 
  also people complaining the price was n't as advertised when it changes at check-out - which at least where i live is a fine-able offence . 
  however , in us you have prices listed without vat , so every customer has to add it in their mind . 
  on the other hand in the eu vat needs to be included in the price in most ( all ? ), 
  countries . 
  this reminds me of [ laibach take on the russian anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph4srm9oe7c ) especially from the 1:40 . 
  and of course who can forget the [ nk 's childrens palace kids ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsede5su3uc ) \\* * shudder **, 
  they 're still that active ? 
  i 've read about them a couple of years ago . 
  and somewhat recently met some basque students abroad , did n't get a read about a lot of trouble happening . 
  though one of them was castilian from bilbao with just a smidge of basque since she grew up in the city . 
  damn , i needed a good laugh today !, 
  thank you / u/gerbaire ** < 3 **, 
  you only need to cross one border , really , 
  not in uk , but that is why i keep a wooden box of slipper by my entrance doors . 
  people have guest slippers , you do n't have people running around in socks when they come to visit . 
  and he was a father of eight too !, 
  still better than ljubljana :( though the distance to brnik airport might be a factor . 
  with a [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o37yjbfrrfg ) * . 
  [ this 5 min video from cgp grey ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o37yjbfrrfg ) should make you reall happy then . 
  oooh , i can see where the confusion comes from , but i went to high-school in celje and am a purebred styrian . 
  i grew up in the great times before keber 's law , it applied to me for about 5 months . 
  did n't matter much since at the time we were still laughing at it and alcohol was still openly sold to minors . 
  we 'd sit in cafes drinking cocktails and beers after school once in a while . 
  but i do n't know if the culture changed that much ... everyone i know would make sure those drunk would get to their homes . 
  in my experience the hard drinkers were mainly of two types , those with bad family life more often than not whose parents were drinking too much themselves . 
  and those whose parents kept them on a very short leash so they would binge drink every once in a while when they had an opportunity ( home alone for the evening ) . 
  sometimes these two would overlap . 
  not from there , but pretty much all my high-school mates ( except maybe ... e. . . 
  would answer this as yes . 
  my grandpa would offer me half a glass of whatever wine adults were drinking every sunday lunch since i was about 13 . 
  and told me what kind of wine it was as well . 
  so i would be a yes in higher years of elementary school , but i got drunk for the first time at uni girl-night party when i was 20 . 
  i can count all the time i was drunk on the finger of my hand , because i do n't enjoy the loss of control over motor functions . 
  it 's because the rule is one country - one language . 
  i think . 
  the worst that i remember happened in a neighbouring apartment building . 
  a friend of a friend doused herself in gasoline and setting herself on fire in a basement on a stored mattress kids used to park their asses on when they went for a smoke . 
  she left a letter saying she resented her parents for not letting her go on a date on her birthday the week prior . 
  we were 11 years old . 
  still ca n't really listen to evanescence 's immortal - as an absolute fav of her they played it at her funeral . 
  but here hanging is most popular for both sexes . 
  motorcycle crashes for young guys . 
  also stepping in front of a train . 
  there 's also some older guys tying one side of a long naked wire to themselves and the other on a stone , then tossing that over a long-distance power-line . 
  still self immolation is a special kind of ... 
  i do n't know exactly what . 
  motor-vehicle facilitated suicide is quite common over here . 
  aside from jumping in front of a train , people drive motorcycles into trees and houses . 
  looks more accidental ... not . 
  my grandma 's neighbours had to install a special crash resistant plexi shield on the side of a decent sized old thick-walled stone build cottage . 
  it stand at the begging of the village at a first sharp bend after a straight stretch of road . 
  plenty of intentional and unintentional collisions with that wall over the years . 
  still better to choose the houses and trees , than going for a ride against the oncoming traffic wrong way on a high-way . 
  ` cuz that way you get a damned drunk as skunk survivor and four dead car-pooling collage kids going home for the weekend . 
  still have chills over that story . 
  traditional name for march in slovenian is ** su\u0161ec ** . 
  marec is more commonly used though . 
  [ habsburg jaw ] ( http://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/11372051_1446457595661521_754370064_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=mta0ntgwmjc1nziwmze4njiwoa%3d%3d.2 ) is the exact opposite of a weak chin . 
  [ wiki !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prognathism#history ) - sorry but i just could n't help myself \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  true but moulds have hiphae , which kinda look like deep roots of a tree , and are n't visible to the naked eye . 
  depending on the food type toxins can get even deeper . 
  it mainly depends on the density of food . 
  bread and tomatoes are hopeless . 
  young cheese is n't that much better . 
  ( unless you 're doing it on purpose . ), 
  on the other hand you can get away with cutting of mouldy surface of dried meats and hard cheeses . 
  some guy buys a beach-house in montenegro . 
  afterwards he asks the real estate agent , if he could arrange for 5 local guys to come repaint it . 
  the next morning a truck pulls up with 7 guy in the back . 
  so the owner comes up to the driver and tries to explain he only need the 5 . 
  the driver explains not to worry , the 2 extra are bosnian and here to unload the local painters . 
  it 's \u010crna gora in slovenian . 
  but yes natively it crna gora . 
  c is pretty much alway a tz as in tzar or car as it were . 
  or something like the first c in civic or civilian . 
  or the second one in concept or concentration . 
  here something being a hunter 's whatever just means there 's mushrooms in the sauce so here 's out [ lovski zrezek ] ( http://images.jazkuham.si/data/image/variations/496x384/1/default-img-1285.jpg ) . 
  well , sure except that there are male - a nouns , and non-a female nouns , most notably those ending in - ev , but not exceptions like `` spev '' song , `` hlev '' - barn and `` lev '' - lion . 
  technically these are actually a part of the female -0 group together with nouns like `` kopel '' - bath , `` smrt '' - death , `` bolezen '' - sickness , `` pesem '' - song , `` perut '' - bird 's wing . 
  there 's also `` mati '' - mother and `` h\u010di '' - daughter , but not `` dekle '' - girl which is neutral . 
  neutral nouns are generally - o or - e , but of course there are plenty of exceptions ; `` avto '' - car and `` finale '' are male . 
  some foreign nouns can even be mix-gendered when declined , like the latin `` species '' . 
  or some that are default plural , like neuter plural , which are generally - a nouns `` vrata '' - door , `` jetra '' - liver and `` o\u010dala '' - glasses . 
  on the other hand , the same could be said for german - ig , - ant and - us nouns for example are usually male . 
  on the other hand - ung , - heit and - ei are generally female . 
  the thing that makes english the easiest that everything without a name ( except ships ) is an it . 
  german and slovenian do not share genders , in slovenian a horse is a he , a table is a she , a see is an it , cauliflower is a she , a carrot is a he , a book is a she , and so on ... also while we have three cases of masculine and feminine cases each and two of neutral , the mantra os slovenian grammar is that `` exceptions have exceptions '' and only `` an exception proves the rule '' .
