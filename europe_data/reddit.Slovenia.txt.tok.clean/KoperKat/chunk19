  except for some godforsaken reason `` dekle '' girl is a neutral noun in slovenian . 
  they also accept [ kids into their ranks ] ( http://www.vecer.com/images/slike/2017/02/16/01340752f-700.jpg ) :d, 
  yes , but the new partner hardly has any rights and the children from the previous marriage are not equal when it come to inheritance . 
  it 's harder to establish guardian rights in these situations . 
  if a parents remarries the new spouse automatically gets a legally recognized relationship to the children . 
  no idea . 
  i do know of a few people that went through adult adoption once they were 18 . 
  mostly because it 's really really hard to take all parental rights from the biological parents , so generally a consent to adoption is needed . 
  also csd probably prefers to hold some power of oversight over these children . 
  there 's also our media that whips up a storm , always on the ( grand ) parents side , no fact-checking whatsoever . 
  ca n't blame the social workers getting shy of taking decisive actions . 
  bit then again my vies my be a smidge coloured by me reading * ledene magnolije * back in high-school . 
  \\* shudder *, 
  also beetroot . 
  wheat , barley , buckwheat , rye , yogurt , kefir , cheese and cottage cheese . 
  rice for the rich . 
  saurkraut or sour turnip .

  vegetables with butter , rice , and pasta . 
  leftover bread ? 
  make [ bread dumplings with bacon ] ( http://images.24ur.com/media/images/640x338/jan2015/61548260.jpg?ba85 ) . 
  best when put cooked into the oven with the roast for a few minutes . 
  when making stews , just put in some [ \u017eli\u010dniki - wheat dumplings ] ( https://oblizniprste.si/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/okusna-piscancja-obara-z-vodnimi-zlicniki-4.jpg ) instead . 
  make them special by adding sauted liver , kidney or spleen when kneeding .

  though the last one will be a bit plain without the beans ; , ( huh , i suppose now i know why we 're a bit low on potato consumption . 
  adoptions in slovenia per year are in single digits , usually not even going over 5 . 
  our social services prefer to foster children , generally they try to avoid cutting contact , unless there 's outright abuse . 
  afaik the issue here is of people that get into a homosexual relationship and already have children . 
  it creates all sorts of medical and inheritance issues . 
  i suppose due to our history , priests wo n't ever have such power . 
  rcc was depowered in all aspects during communism and when we became an independent nation people still remembered that rcc was n't the best of employers or landlords so no-one was in a hurry to just hand them the power back . 
  now it would be incredibly messy to allocate such privileges to various religious communities , since our state has completely separation from religion . 
  one of the more active religious groups ( as far as the news goes ) is trans-universal zombie church of blessed bell-ringing . 
  the conservatives would go absolutely insane . 
  our state does n't and wo n't care . 
  religious ceremonies hold no legal power , and that includes church weddings . 
  basically on the wedding day people here usually hold two ceremonies , a civil and a church one . 
  double the oaths , double the power !, 
  well , sometimes the power for the public to initiate a referendum to veto a law comes quite handy . 
   besides they can be repeated yearly unless the constitutional court deems it unconstitutional . 
  the parliament could have forced a resolution by having this issue reviewed by the highest court . 
  they have n't . 
  btw , this was the final straw that caused that us ambassador mussomeli had to leave slovenia in disgrace . 
  there 's was a publicly initiated referendum on us joining the nato despite the parliament giving a positive resolution . 
  he though giving the public direct power to initiate a veto on a law slows down the legislative progress too much and publicly called for our constitution to be amended . 
  this faux pas is probably one of the reasons us is quite unpopular around here . 
  in slovenia religious weddings hold no legal power . 
  you need to get the legal papers from the government ( usually that part if officiated by a municipality representative ) . 
  if you wan na hold a religious ceremony or wedding in addition to that , the state does n't care one iota . 
  it 's between that religion official and the wedding party . 
  ` cuz think of the children !, 
  hopefully it will stick , with the main point of the black right taken off the table . 
  though imho at the last referendum the political left was as much to blame for the lost . 
  you do n't win debates siting on a high horse smirking down on you opposition . 
  we 've had that for years too . 
  but the marriage part is still in the air . 
  it cycles between being put in the law and repealed by a publicly initiated referendum . 
  rinse , repeat in a year . 
  i get the glow in the dark thing , but why colour it cropped out sticker d : almost as bad as [ belgian emu commemoration coin ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/comm/shared/img/joint_comm_2009_belgium.jpg ) . 
  it is a funny pair . 
  in slovenian obraz is face and lice is cheek . 
  still simple , can be enostavno , but also preprosto . 
  thank god !, 
  my prandparents helped put me through uni after the housing bubble tsunami hit us . 
  maybe all you need a senior 's friendly politician . 
  seriously our desus party is basically an advocate to keep the pensions * at least * where they are and rising with inflation . 
  they are probably 3rd largest in elections consistently and always find a place in the coalition - left , right , black , white , red ? 
  who cares , gibb pensions !, 
   but then germans also found funny ways to confuse people from nearby regions with the way they 're saying what time it is so there there 's that . 
  we have that too  is it three quarters on or three quarters to ? 
  5 till/pass half/quarter hour is popular also ... 
  what about 13th of february ? 
  it 's how the british write it down . 
  slovenian does n't have the mm-dd form in a spoken form . 
  imho it 's also mathematically pleasing . 
  after all , you generally write other things in order like 6 \u00b0 5 ' 13 '' or 5h 12min and so on . 
  probably because historically guests with flags liked to party so hard , they like literally set roofs on fire . 
  if you need to go outside your house to use internet on a machine you do n't * really * know how to use efficiently , you might just as well use the time to personally sort things out . 
  nothing beats the sense of familiarity and a stamped and dated piece of paper that , yes , the government is aware you 've filed and filed correctly with all the auxiliary documentation necessary , as witness by the signed employee . 
  and because of the accountability , i still do important stuff in person and always request the confirmation form to be filled out , signed , dated , stamped and the duplicate is filed with the paperwork . 
  but do they count mail , facebook and skype as internet in their head ? 
  i know we set up my grandpa with renamed icons of html links and he uses them every day - he 's even starting to use tabs and bookmarks , but i 'm pretty sure he 'd say he does n't use internet regularly . 
  i wonder how many of the older generation , just do n't connect office work , facebook , mail and internet . 
  as for the broadband vs internet use - most houses , in slovenia at least , get their tv programs through tv box sets now , which of course use broadband internet . 
  aaaand service comes in a so-called trio package ( 30-40eu / month range for basic ) and every household has phone , tv and internet services , even if they do n't use them all . 
  stick with to your strong traits . 
  seafood and very sweet pastries . 
  and berries !, 
  old slovenian name for februar is sve\u010dan . 
  not widely spoken , but still written down semi-regularly . 
  that moment after you 've spent too much time on / r/bestoflegaladvice and read esa as `` emotional support animal '' ( \u00b0 _ \u00b0 ) ', 
  there was a corrupt mayor in maribor ( second largest city ) . 
  the thing that broke the camels back was privatization of criminal charges . 
  the city had a contract with a private firm to install speed check robots through-out the city . 
  to pay for them they allowed the company to issue tickets . 
  by law that can not be . 
  it 's the municipality that has the power to fine citizens , not some random private firm .
