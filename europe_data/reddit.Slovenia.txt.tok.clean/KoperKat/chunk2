  edit : periods, 
  and then [ the marmot packs up the chocholate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fie8_cpbdfc ) . 
  i think the problem is that popular national revolution can not be carried out by invaders . 
  for better or for worse the middle east is reinventing itself after centuries of colonialism and proxy pissing matches between usa and russia . 
  imho it will get even worse before it will get better . 
  choose to give , yes . 
  has to give , no . 
  i should have really put / s at the end of that . 
  after the meeting the pm miro cerar has said that the national institutions are cooperating and will continue to do so in the future . 
  he added that they have been prepraing for this situation for multiple months . 
  * '' we must find an united european solution as son as possible '' * he stressed . 
  he pointed out that both austria and germany have installed their own temporary border control . 
  slovenia has also temporarily installed control over its border with hungary a few days ago because the movement in our neighbourhood is so difficult to predict at this time . 
  he stressed that the border has not been closed . 
  he said , that they have been predicting different scenarios and have been in state of constant alert and coordinating with ngos . 
  * '' we must take into account the principles of humanitarianism , we must help people in need , we must respect the principle of solidarity '' * he stressed . 
   ** slovenia will talk about corridors **  in the even that the pressure of refuges becomes to great , slovenia will talk about possible ways , so called corridors with all countries . 
  he also explained these talks would be geared toward managing of the flow of refugees to their desired destinations . 
  he added , that they have been in contact with the neighbouring states and that * '' if the flow increases so much , they will encourage measures in this direction . '' *  for tv klub he said decision of croatia to divert refugee toward slovenia raises concerns . 
  '' it is a fact that a policy of diverting refugees toward slovenian borders is outside accepted norms and spirit of european cooperation . 
  our slovenia duty is to protect the schengen border and croatians are well aware of this fact . 
  therefore any massive diversion toward slovenia is completely wrong , outside of norms and i hope that he situation will turn . '' * * `` if the situation escalates , we will escalate measures taken '' * , he announced and he also assured , that for now activating the army outside the logistical support is not necessary . 
  he stressed violence should be avoided . 
  first few paragraphs translated to the best of my ability in a short amount of time . 
  the rest of the subtitles as as follows : * croatia reneges on agreement on joint border control * milanovi\u010d : we wo n't register refugees any longer * ostoji\u0107 : croatia will accept refugees returned from slovenia * pahor : our humanity and reason are challenged * hungary and slovenia concerned : croatian aid system has collapsed in a day * zl : we are witnessing a hypocrisy of the slovenian goverment ( * the far left opposition * ), 
  no it 's not . 
  it just depends on your reasons for opposing them . 
  most people around here oppose them because they support heirloom species and there have been situations where gmo strains prove dominant . 
  a grave concern ( as far as monsanto goes ) is that the farmer can not cultivate their own seeds . 
  most people here own small gardens and trading seeds is a time honoured tradition . 
  that are just two reasons out of many more . 
   michael fallon said the figure was `` highly approximate '' , partly because there were no uk troops on the ground to confirm the impact of the campaign . 
  this does not fill me with confidence . 
  if you do n't know what you did hit , how can you be so sure on what you did n't hit . 
  slovenia is currently centre right . 
  the ruling party wants to declare themselves centre , but are leaning right imho . 
  the charts can be thrown off by the ( kinda leftish ? ), 
  desus which is basically a party that focuses on protecting pensions and is * always * in the coalition ( they 're flexible on pretty much anything not relating to bank accounts of seniors ) . 
  i would rather ask at what civilian cost ? 
  coming from a country of 2 million i think 160k is more than plenty . 
  slovenians went up in arms when it was leaked that gmo cereals might get labeled as '' new generation '' and thus circumvent strict gmo regulations . 
  that made half the populace froth at their mouths . 
  btw , most of the outrage geared toward gmos is based on economic and environmental reasons not on how safe they are as a food . 
  in slovenia they were deemed inappropriate subduing tools , because they are often lethal when used on people with heart conditions . 
  so they are illegal . 
  crossing over [ kolpa ] ( http://www.vitaaa.net/wp/vitaaa/vitaaa.net/public_html/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/kolpa-02.jpg ) isn ' the easiest thing . 
  only narrow winding country roads and very conservative people . 
  there are place where you need to drive for 45min to get bread and milk ... if you do n't get lost and face to face with a bear . 
  i worry that we might start seeing dead people as the snows start to fall and it gets below freezing . 
  if they refuse to apply , they are illegals and slovenian policy is to extradite them immediately . 
  if we close the border , you get overburdened so i suggest you close you border too . 
  let serbians deal with them . 
  if they refuse to register they can be legally returned back to the country they crossed from . 
  without officially seeking asylum they are by slovenian law just another illegal immigrant and treated as such . 
  it 's our law . 
  they are granted freedom of movement ( so they could physically cross the border ) , but their fingerprints get recorded into refugee database and if they were to request asylum in another country they would get flagged and returned to the country that first granted them asylum . 
  i 'm not sure , but i think that this sort of dishonesty would at least get their movement restricted in slovenia if it would n't outright endanger their asylum status once returned back to us . 
  edit : paragraph breaks, 
  process them and return them to serbia , which is a safe country and so on ... 
  catholics do it too . 
  on st. stefan 's they used to bless horses and oxen , but now they do [ all kinds of vechicles ] ( http://www.brezje.si/novice/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/img_9583.jpg ) ( and call them steel steeds , no jokes ) . 
  you can get your car blessed every sunday after mass ( except easter ! ), 
  in front of the maria help basilica . 
  uncharacteristically , it 's also for free !, 
  pretty much same here , but you do n't pay it unless you have monthly income ( no matter how you get it ) that is above 52 % of last years known average paycheck . 
  same here . 
  i really dont like the name [ isis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isis ) . 
  do n't want her go the way of the swastika . 
  i do n't think these sort of people will ever be satisfied unless eu starts to charter plans for refugees . 
  and even then it will never be enough . 
  which reminds me : [ a rich man parable ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=s9towic_klu#t=62 ) . 
   the number of deaths at sea rose to record levels in april 2015 , and then dropped dramatically in may and june . 
  between january and march , 479 refugees and migrants drowned or went missing , as opposed to 15 during the first three months of the year before . 
  in april the situation took an even more terrible turn . 
  in a number of concurrent wrecks , an unprecedented 1,308 refugees and migrants drowned or went missing in a single month ( compared to 42 in april 2014 ) . 
  in may , the number of refugees and migrants drowned or missing at sea fell to 68 , a quarter of the figure only one year earlier ( 226 ) . 
  the downward trend continued in june , which saw 12 deaths compared to 305 in 2014 . 
  and hundreds of them drown .

  yes , i know . 
  i was being kinda angrily sarcastic . 
  i 've been following the problematic for a while now . 
  it peeves me that this is how you get people to care and pay attention nowadays . 
  not that it is a very constructive attention anyway . 
  most of the people just shout out : `` something must be done ! '' and stomp their feet . 
  share it with friends , feel better for doing a good deed and move on . 
  even if he was the `` captain '' , he most likely was n't a trafficker . 
  traffickers do n't take the last leg of the journey . 
  they just find a decrepit decommissioned boat , put a compass in the hand of some refugee and point them in a general direction . 
  the plan being that coastal guard will pick them up before the boat fall apart/capsizes/fills up with water . 
  i do n't understand why suddenly people care about this one toddler this much . 
  what difference does it makes whether his father drove the boat ? 
  it 's a tragedy , but we 've been seeing dead floating bodies for years now and no one cared . 
  this just reminded me of an anecdote . 
  when my little cousin - 4 or 5 years at the time - first saw woman in nicab on the news , his reaction was : `` look , a ninja ! '' he was so happy there are real outside of cartoons . 
  could n't be talked out of it for days . 
  you 're getting [ up here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bled_castle#/media/file:blejski_grad.jpg ) only one way . 
  and then there are the ex-yu countries . 
  most recently kosovo breaking away does n't make any economic or historical sense . 
  but if you base a country on the social contract , then you must accept the right of the people to self-determination .
