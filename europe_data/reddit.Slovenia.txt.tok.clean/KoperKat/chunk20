  anyway , some of the boxes got burned , some ran over by trucks while turning on `` accident '' . 
  it snowballed from there into 10.000 protests strong in a 100.000 city . 
  the president defended the mayor , there were allegedly planted hooligans amongst the protesters . 
  by the end we had the whole country protesting state corruption , all other grievances were aired . 
  the mayor stepped down , new elections were held , some other shit happened , then things calmed down again . 
  there was some funny stuff though : [ a snowman of the president ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/sl/a/a3/protesti_v_sloveniji_2013_-_snezak_jj.jpg ) , [ the sad puppets of ljubljana ] ( http://www.mladina.si/media/www/slike/dnevne/2013/03/__610/4vlv-bs.jpg ), 
  ca n't the referendum be initiated by voters/public direct ? 
  eh , only because hitler wanted the ex-austrian territories `` back '' to `` make this land german again '' . 
  btw that 's a direct quote from when he [ visited maribor back in ' 41 ] ( http://www.renton.si/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tumblr_moqznf0x8r1swhhamo1_1280.jpg ) . 
  in slovenia , there are high-schools for nurses . 
  there are also a tertiary nursing program , s but it 's usually where the head nurses , surgical , delivery and other specialist nurses get additional training . 
  yup . 
  plus subsidized food , transport and accommodations . 
  there 's a line between tolerance and being a doormat . 
  and in a truly secular society the state does not support religion any more then it would a crochet society or a mountaineering club . 
  religion should never be a reason to excuse someone from breaking the law or grant them special dispensation that another citizen could not be granted . 
  of course . 
  but secularism means that religion is relegated to the private sphere . 
  public exhibition of religion , like street preaching , or public praying , is to me intrusive . 
  i do n't see it as a piteous act , i see it as intrusive and signaling of virtue . 
  full face veiling to me is the same . 
  besides i believe foreigners wishing to live in another country have a duty conform to the culture of their host at least in public interactions - language , manners and social niceties - dress is a part of that . 
  you are always welcome to move somewhere else . 
  caught in a landslide, 
  and that it 's not displacable in haemoglobin by oxygen in athmo pressure . 
  to be fair the versailles itself is n't the versailles it should have been ... 
  but it is a picture from the annual * kravji bal * the cow festival . 
  it used to be that cattle would be used to pull carts and the like and just like with horses , greenery and flowers would be added to the tack on special days . 
  the old man is also wearing a pretty stereotypical highlander cow-herding clothes ( the wide brimmed hat and sheep-skin vest ) . 
  mockingly ? 
  satirically ? 
  maybe even sardonically ... 
  damn , damn , damn . 
  co poisoning is a real threat . 
  when i was in high-school a former classmate of mine died of it together with a friend and their girlfriends . 
  they rented a cabin and went skiing for the weekend . 
  the heating system ran on hard wood , but was just inspected and certified as safe and working by the chimney-sweep service the week before . 
  probably also counts pay outs from pokojnin and invalidnin as public expense . 
  really ? 
  and here i allway though [ the mummy ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/mummy/images/3/35/bx.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080726211249 ) wrote it ... huh til, 
  yeah , but you also do n't have a grudge to hold over that battle by some freezing river that happened some odd two millennia ago . 
  if you want to see complicated relationships going back to time immemorial visit the balkans . 
  edit : adding / s just in case, 
  funny irrelevant thing i just remembered - doctors in slovenia still kinda call on apollo the healer , aesculapius , hygiea and panacea as witnesses to their oath ... 
  nope . 
  in the last parliamentary election the leader of the most religious right wing group mentioned moses on televised debate . 
  one camera sweep and it was obvious the audience did n't know if they should cringe or laugh her of the stage . 
  catholics are the majority . 
  when the then archbishop , now cardinal , rode tried to publicly address the country on a public matter - even though the proposed law affected the rcc - he was quickly reminded by his own flock not to meddle in the matters taht belong to cesar . 
  lidl sometimes has them . 
  they do yugonostalgia weeks ( similar to greek , american , french cousine week ) and you can get these things among ohter old timey stuff . 
  also [ bubble-gum cigarettes ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-78rb0b6csci/uakkezyungi/aaaaaaaablu/nawy9jv-p78/s1600/image-211_h.jpg ) , 
  me thinks you 're missing the ferry rides . ^ i ^ once ^ took ^ a ^ car-ferry ^ from ^ sweden ^ to ^ finland ^ ^ yeah ... 
  one of the thing , i 've found , that sometimes makes these people pause is to look at illegal migrants this way . 
  they are stealing from the refugees . 
  every migrant sheltered , fed and supported leaves that much less in budget and resources for the actually needy . 
  oh , and thank goodness , that we 're apparently dirt poor . 
  we 've had thousands pouring over our country each day toward the nordic heavens and we 're apparently not good enough in living standards ... 
  generally speaking it 's pretty hard to get yourself a hipovitaminosis in europe without some other underlying cause . 
  we , as in humans , really do n't need all that much . 
  i 'd had to check , but i would n't be surprised if lack of vit . 
  k is most prevalent what with liver disease and early childhood problems . 
  or venice with the medici at their height of power living there . 
  yep , that how i saw it as well . 
  i 'd limit the vale to switzerland only due to the isolationist politics . 
  on the other hand i see the iron islands as the irish ( geographically and in political relationship towards king 's landing ) and viking era scandinavians ( we do not sow ) combined . 
  here 's some [ info ] ( https://travelslovenia.org/velika-planina/ ) on the pastures . 
  bigger than mala planina at any rate . 
   it 's about 6km ^ 2 at the top - still there 's loads of fog in autumn and winter , best to visit in early spring , though in the summer there 's cows and plenty of fresh dairy products to buy from the herders . 
  they do tend to take the breath away - like the [ duomo in milan ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1nzw5ulr7em/tdwgcxfd10i/aaaaaaaaaoc/wofchzuf6ry/s1600/il%20duomo%20inside.jpg ) . 
  or you know , the [ pathenon ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nehsya3so2m/ukvqlvgazwi/aaaaaaaaiz4/slkxccxzjvw/s1600/pantheon+light.jpg ) ... 
  it might have something to do with the sheer load bearing strength of semicircular forms . 
  it 's also why you see pyramids all over the world - convergent problem solving . 
  i went to a metal music festival at summertime every year since first year of high-school . 
  we went for 7-10 days . 
  payed for it myself , went with friends , alcohol was still legal for minors to buy . 
  great times . 
  the graph of linear regression from the [ actual source ] ( https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/humupd/dmx022 ) is a bit [ wierd ] ( https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/content_public/journal/humupd/pap/10.1093_humupd_dmx022/1/dmx022f03.png?expires=1501466184&amp;signature=oz3p3rrxx-vokefojevsuu~~igshy9zyibqphuxrxxzkjzqwdkprsbj~wgrmxf1nfnjutjp4mhy-w7s~n5xjafxfsmdb~lium-pukgvjc7vlg5udcx57ogmpmtvaj2ddxmdj~a8mi6puurwmiu29q60~g6bdfiaw8ioeusddc~ljuquxunoq5rkgshsfzkadc-b7m0xq5sx4cgtwi-nbevvdcoq5jwet-fjbi~m5w6mfnlootdr-lihlcndmauftdjr4wacfphre~p9jki963g2bv9uc596hohzgrqheziptnwrgvo5hafu8dmvsvpv5b1m8jnwha~t8mggbf97acw__&amp;key-pair-id=apkaiuczbia4lvpavw3q ) though - it shows that fertile men used to have a significantly lower sperm count . 
  and that is despite ( afai understand this the meta study excluded studies that did n't account for subject age ) . 
  this article also quotes [ another guardian article ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/dec/05/sperm-count-fall-is-it-real ) that is responding to this study however the latter is much better sourced . 
  it actual mentions both the 25-years-old study that first published a noticeable decline * and * studies that find inconclusive data as well as one that concluded the trend is rising . 
  apparently `` sperm counting is really hard ! '', 
  nah , for that you need [ golice ] ( http://www.njuskalo.hr/image-w920x690/orasasti-plodovi-sjemenke/sjemenke-buce-golice-slika-55775442.jpg ) , also pretty delicious whole .

  roasted and salted . 
  we do have them mandatory , the problem is that the parents caught up in the vaccine scare are mainly financially well situated new agey types . 
  they take advantage of loopholes trying to exhaust the paediatrician to the point of them going f *** it . 
  as of now the patient protection laws demand that every patient understand the benefits and risks of a procedure - these parents keep on asking the same questions over and over and over and over and over and over ... ... never `` understanding '' it . 
  they do n't have to be reasonable or sincere about it . 
  i almost quoted the last two paragraphs myself . 
  chechens are n't slavs either ... 
  this is one of my main arguments against mass uncontrolled refugee immigration . 
  it spreads resources and personnel to thinly to be truly effective . 
  it raises the risk of vulnerable refugees being cooped up with the same sort of peers they were running from . 
  the ( understandably ) rising resentment by the downtrodden tax-payers on minimum wage , that see rising allocation of aid going to foreigner , while they are told to tighten the belt because were still in a financial crisis . 
  not to mention it means that attention is diverted from refugee camps by the war-zones , where there are actually people stuck without any means in terrible situations . 
  the media overplayed it with the sob story narrative , they 've been mixing up immigrants and refugees from the start . 
  that 's a damn shame . 
  not to scale , bit i do remember going to a metal music festival here about ten years ago and meeting some serbians that were here incognito . 
  back home they said that they went hiking in the alps , because there would be social repercussions over it .
