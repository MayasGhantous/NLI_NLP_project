  seriously , what ? 
  but i had some feels like it was getting a bit better , it 's a shame to hear otherwise . 
  ah , that makes more sense . 
  though given the current climate seeking asylum was n't the best thought out solution , given how overwhelmed germany is and they have a pretty open emigration path to anywhere in eu . 
  am i the only one wondering what are two * serbian * married guys doing in a german asylum centre ? 
  i mean serbia does n't have the absolute best reputation on lgbt issues , but i get the vibe it 's been vastly improved in the last few years . 
  being gay in serbia is def not an asylum claim worthy imho . 
  ** slovenia ** three little bear cubs and their mother were slain by foreigners on our motorways . 
  [ [ x ] ( http://4d.rtvslo.si/arhiv/prvi-dnevnik/174481685 ) ] also a [ new war memorial was unvieled ] ( https://img.rtvslo.si/_up/upload/2017/07/13/65421095_photo_544987_20170713_4.jpg ) , there 's lots of congestion on motorways toward croatia , the courts went on holiday . 
  oh and there 's this arbitration thing ... 
  awesome . 
  love the simplicity of it . 
  very little clutter . 
  a small comment on slovenian flag ( cuz ofcourse ) it might be prettier and recognisable , if you used [ `` slovenian green '' ] ( http://www.slovenia.si/visit/slovenian-green/ ) in the place of red . 
  white-blue-green is a pretty popular tricolour , most prominently used [ in national sports outfits and logos ] ( http://www.eljubljana.si/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/olimpijski-sprehod.jpg ) . 
  name so rare , you get it wrong even with the help of google :d, 
  it 's also called * ro\u017enik * , the flower month . 
  but it 's not used much . 
  because the there are two traditional axes to the political spectrum . 
  left-right and liberal-authoritarian . 
  anarchist are most def the extreme liberal , however it seems a lot of them also lean left ( imho because they proclaim that without government people would nicely cooperate + their tendency to form collectives ) . 
  i see left as more of a collective society and right as more individualistic side of the human coin for economic , educational and social safety . 
  for religious and military issues when it 's usually reversed . 
  also not all , bla bla bla ... 
  and witcher ? 
  we call it kljuna\u0161 - the beaked one ( kinda ) . 
  30 day of payed vacation first year employed . 
  also unlimited payed sick-days . 
  ( that on is even less understandable to me , if you 're sick you 're sick . 
  if you 're infections , coming in drops the productivity of * everyone * for a while - can even put customers at risk . 
  tough with the universal coverage if you 're out for more than a month the government pay the whole thing and you need a bit more than a simple doctors note . ), 
  what local issues pray tell ? 
  seriously , we pay the same amount of money , the food comes from foreign countries about the same distance , the products have the same label and yet they 're not the same . 
  wtf ? 
  i 'm not saying the corporations are discriminating or some such emotional bull . 
  but it should be clear and transparent that they 're misleading the public on a sub-par product . 
  you even get joras . 
  the problem is there is little to no difference in price , sometimes things are even more expensive in eu . 
  for instance we used to go clothes shopping into austria , because the same products ( we would go to town on our side and see the exact same blouses , trousers in exact same stores ) was cheaper . 
  so much cheaper that it was worth the trip . 
  it 's the same with food . 
  things in mueller ( they supply in house from germany ) are cheaper and of better quality ( the last part is partly subjective , but sometimes ingredients lists are different as well ) . 
  this is mueller in slovenia . 
  they supply directly . 
  on the other hand about a decade ago slovenia nestle 's import company had regional hq in vienna , since then they 've shifted to zagreb and so we get nestle stuff from a different factory . 
  and yes , there 's a marked difference . 
  and * they * know it . 
  source : my mum used to work for nestle . 
  no-one will be laughing once [ the unhappy lady starts to wander ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p0e2lbreark/maxresdefault.jpg ) . 
  i 've got horrified expressions out of ( certain ) native english speakers for mentioning montenegrins . 
  [ tineye ] ( https://tineye.com/search/e70b26f557d6e1d7efdd4d1f9cc7420d902b70ba/?sort=score&amp;order=desc ) shows jan 2015 results . 
  that awkward laugh tells it all . 
  here 's [ a guy doing a flag stand on the top most ladder ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biahxddtplc ) . 
  for me it was always ski jumping and sometimes skiing in the winter months . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymka1ck3x-8 ) is thought of as one of the most adorable tv ads in our country 's history . 
  [ magnifico ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmotcdx94yq ) you say ? 
  well , here i come ... 
  be careful , it 's still a highly acidic beverage . 
  same goes for fruit juice and some fruit teas . 
  on the other hand , good news , beer is n't cariogenic and has a benign ph. 
  just watch the alco content . 
  otherwise dentist approved :d, 
  yes . 
  not lavish , but at least there 's plenty of [ pretty ornaments ] ( http://www.up-rs.si/up-rs/uprs.nsf/0/bcfe0cd0f8a069fdc1257c36005b5539/$file/m_pisarna.jpg ) . 
  surprisingly beaver is also technically fish and so allowed for monks on fasting days . 
  slovenian has two verbs for dying . 
  one is for animals , the other is for humans and bees . 
  good . 
  at least we 're yellow . 
  something 's burning up upon the mountain . 
  properly communistic as viewing the old regime favourably . 
  believing that speech should be limited and that offensive speech should be criminally prosecuted . 
  never saying outright that property should be public , however , they believe in complete freedom of movement ( in abolishment of all borders for all peoples ) and often say things like `` from each by their ability , to each by their need '' . 
  let 's just say some of their program and rhetoric makes the small hairs on the back of my neck spring up . 
  i suppose that goes for the castille part of the country in particular , right ? 
  i 've not come across many spaniards irl that would be ashamed to say they 're proud catalan or basque , but my sample size is very small . 
  i think many left leaning people do n't differentiate between nationalism and patriotism at all . 
  not that the far right appropriating the less tainted label helps at all . 
  i believe a government has a duty to the citizens of it 's country first . 
  they need to be the healthy base that make the government ( and country ) feasible in the first place . 
  we 're an ageing country of 2mil still in crisis recovery that slashed benefits to the average citizen . 
  adding just a hundred households with one working member and lots of children can quickly make the situation unstable . 
  a tax-paying man with mounting bills and kids fed whit red cross aid packages will inevitably resent a new-comer that gets financial aid larger than his hard-earned pay-check ( a pretty sad fact of current minimum wage ) . 
  and then what ? 
  vote blank !, 
  i always vote , because as far as i see it it is my duty as a citizen . 
  if you do n't vote , do n't complain when things turn sour . 
  i do n't know how it is for you , but our left went crazy from inside . 
  the younger generation is properly communistic with a no-borders-for-humans mind-set . 
  most of them are solid middle-class or higher and can feel incredibly out of touch with issues of poorer native citizens and rural communities . 
  they are also incredibly smug and talk down to the right-wingers or just anyone that 's even slightly patriotic . 
  the arrogance lost them the abolition-of-same-sex-marriage marriage referendum in 2015 for sure . 
  i felt tempted to say `` yes '' just to vote against the damn peacocks on parade . 
  being somewhat centre-left with a desire for strong traditional social services makes the last few years incredibly painful . 
  yay , second !, 
  tbh , around here kids plough on their own as soon as their heavy enough that standing on the clutch with whole weight lets them shift gear . 
  for my cousin that was around 9 or 10 . 
  you can drive on private land pretty much whatever , so he just drove from the farmstead to the field through the orchard - driving on roads would be a no-no . 
   ( since the `` emigrating to congo '' is sort of our expression encompassing the same feeling ) because things are so bad , even congo is better ? 
  we usually just name a banana republic ... does n't matter which , any would do .
