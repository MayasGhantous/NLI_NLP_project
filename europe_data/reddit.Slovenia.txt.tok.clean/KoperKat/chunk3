  this might bring out the flamethrowers , but as a slovenian i can sympathize with catalans very much . 
  and this is why i support compulsory public school education for lower levels . 
  schools are as much about education as they are about raising future citizens . 
  canada obviously because i 'm an atheist woman and morocco would n't be the greatest country for me to live in . 
  the refugees are running through a host of safe countries that are culturally much more welcoming for purely economic reasons . 
  does anyone else hear his voice in their head while reading this ? 
  he just has one of those styles that ca n't be missed . 
  especially the '' and so on '' s. 
  i was looking over some news articles and this popped up . 
  now i 'm looking for the longer version of this interview/opinion piece . 
  and why would anyone care about that ? 
  according to monsanto their peer reviewed , good laboratory practice glyphosate is [ perfectly safe , presenting little to no impact on humans and the environment ] ( http://www.monsanto.com/glyphosate/pages/glyphosate-frequently-asked-questions.aspx ) . 
  / sarcasm edit : formatting snafu, 
  given that it 's geared towards americans some religion and sex questions are pretty insane for a vast majority of europeans . 
  so most of us would land left since religious christian fundamentalist represent the social conservatists . 
  ca n't remember the last time premarital sex was a serious moral issue to be discussed in the political arena . 
  pretty much as expected : economic left/right : -4.63 social libertarian/authoritarian : -4.51 given the religious and sex portions it 's clear that it 's geared towards americans . 
  ca n't remember the last time premarital sex , sex education or anything in that vein was even mentioned as a political issue . 
  slovenia = the same as slovakia ? 
  you 've never been to our [ fair part of the world ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/agriculture/agricultural-machinery/tractors/per-capita ) ... 
  i think the major difference that back then it was known where the people are from and there was a somewhat finite number of them . 
  today we do n't know where this people are from , except that most of them are n't syrians . 
  and there no comprehensible end number , it 's arguably - in comparison - a quarter of continent and not a single ex country on the move if things get bad . 
  and , yes , it does n't help that it is also a group with far different values , culture and language than back then . 
  i think you misunderstood me . 
  i 'm not sure the dem even * want * to scale back military spending , however it is what they say in speeches . 
  because it makes for a convenient scape goat for budgetary issues . 
  if you look at the graph the usa public spending is nominally greater than most world countries and yet the people get much less coverage from the government . 
  tbh imho this is a speech obama gave for voters back home . 
  as a diplomatic outreach this kind of language is completely tone deaf and can only lead to alienation of the general public in ally states . 
  the way i see it , the left has been blaming the large military budget for pretty much everything . 
  but since they 're not shrinking it they have to find an excuse for their inaction somewhere . 
  much easier than explaining to the public why [ usa is far outspending everyone on healthcare ] ( http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/health_financing/atlas.html ) and yet [ infant mortality remains a challenge ] ( http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/93/3/14-148627/en/ ) ( and higher than that of iran , turkey and libya ) . 
  the [ actual money put in by the government ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita#/media/file:oecd-healthexp-percapita.svg ) is pretty high with poor results . 
  besides i highly , * highly * , doubt that european countries fielding armies with larger arsenals would make us in anyway shrink their own budget . 
  in worst case scenario you would have pundits pushing it even higher ` just in case ' . 
  kill everyone and there will be peace . 
  the best defense ever !, 
  my grandma 's raspberries , vines , walnuts and apricots disagree . 
  prime inversion location . 
  i do n't eat it with beans , but it 's great with pumpkin oil , apple vinegar , shallots and ground black pepper . 
  beans , tomatoes and pored over searing crackling optional . 
  to be good `` raw '' the sauerkraut has to be homemade and chilled ( cellar temp ) in my opinion . 
  store-bought can be unimpressive , and in that case a pig stepping in it while it cooks is a must . 
  my grandma makes it every fall , you can eat it out of the souring bin as is and it 's delicious . 
  poor word choice on my part . 
  more in the sense of heaven being the true home so keep your head down and suffer what you 're given in this life because it 's just a test . 
  i 've read some older sermons and they 're pretty heavy on proper order of people ( kings are god 's chosen and the pope confirms them , people are the sheep that * need * protection from the nobility and state ( dogs ) and guidance from the church ( the shepherds ) or the wolves - devil - will tear them apart ) . 
  any problems - war , famine , disease - are punishments from above for general wickedness and sinfulness , so it can only be taken away by the grace of god if the people repent and pray enough ( and purge the unrepented from the herd ) . 
  i think it took away agency from people being told there 's ultimately * nothing * they can do to help their situation and even if they could they really kinda should n't anyway because this their lot in life assigned as an entry test to the heaven . 
  i think the end times rhetoric got severely toned down in the 20th century as the church tries to portray a more pr friendly face filled with hope and sunshine . 
  they even approve of science and evolution now , with a few caveats of course . 
  not to mention impeding education and discovery . 
  leaving healing and medicine in the hands of god , rapture is around the corner so why even bother improving this flawed world we temporarily inhabit before going home . 
  only if it 's organized by an international committee with the cooperation of ec and eea representatives to elect an unbiased format and fair moderators . 
  * killing time * am i right ? 
  can anyone * please * get the [ ** original article ** ] ( https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/eastern-europe-refugee-crisis-xenophobia-by-jan-gross-2015-09?barrier=true ) from behind the paywall ? 
  i 'd actually like to read what he wrote before forming my own opinion . 
  is it weird my first thought was : `` what kind of douche wants to have puppies killed ? '', 
  * aaaaaaaaaah * not dogs dogs , but * dogs * dogs . 
  prick . 
  the balkans would be calm like a power keg with a friar sitting on top holding a lit candle in his arsehole . 
  or mind : * worse than pole *, 
  of the recent ones [ ernest and celestine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtl-6grkr9m ) is my favourite . 
  most of my electric bill is more or less taxes , contributions and static costs that i ca n't even influence by using less . 
  use 12 % kwh less ? 
  congrats it 's a 1,40 euro difference on a 40 euro bill . 
  well at least the police properly diffused the situation by promptly removing themselves from the situation . 
  no police , no conflict . 
  oh , and thanks for the beer , it 's delicious . 
   the ** youth ** tried to ** stabbing the bridge ** over the charleroi-brussels canal to reach the beursplein , but was prevented by ** the police ** who had completely ** dropped off the bridge ** . 
  oh , google translate edit : also to / u/blackstonebite the aricle is probably nsfw . 
  if you scroll all the way down , there 's a picture of the injured woman lying on the street . 
  we have a ( n ex ) polititian whose own chosen name is sre\u010dko prijatelj meaning lucky friend . 
  did n't help in the end . 
  rather famous examples * zver meaning beast * groza meaning terror there 's also a female name of \u017diva meaning `` the livning one '' so \u017diva groza becomes '' ** living terror ** '' . 
  the more embarrassing ones are klinc ( dick - both the member and the person ) , f\u00fcka\u0161 ( you fuck ) , smrdonja ( stinky ) , skaza ( someone of a disturbed , ruined look/face ) , ritoznoj ( ass sweat ) , gnida ( lice egg ) and vulva . 
  on the funny side popivoda ( drink water ) , bodiro\u017ea ( be a flower ) , gospod ( mister ) , hr\u010dek ( hamster ) , pi\u0161\u010dan\u010dek ( little chick ) , \u0160trukelj ( dumpling - kinda ) and gizmo . 
  there 's also the [ aloha snackbar ] ( https://youtu.be/4g5p6b-zz5y?t=2m39s ) video . 
   [ ... ] him and smiled for the camera while a ** stewardess did the snap ** . 
  it has to be the ** best selfie ever ** .

  around here there an opposite sentiment - our privacy laws on internet use are arguably stricter , because our former civil rights attache mrs. pirc-musar was a privacy hound . 
  the eu laws are often considered too invasive . 
  for instance your carrier may not retain any information of your internet traffic without specific court intervention in cooperation with police . 
  to counter that , i love homemade cider . 
  some of my relatives make hectoliters of the stuff - some apple , some pear - most of the trees are old , the fruits kinda blah to eat , but drinks out of them be it cider or schnapps is wonderful . 
  however , store-bought cider is ** terrible ** the added sweeteners make it pretty much unbearable for me - especially when flavored whatever . 
  this is great , since we know so little about the other `` teachers '' to the romans compared to ancient greeks . 
  true , it 's more of a comment on the creators . 
  for instance in case of enclaves mainly german ones where proposed to get a degree of autonomy , while others were more likely to be included in the greater territory . 
  mainly it would be a hodge-podge of a federation since there would probably be some unrest in the smaller older entities that would find themselves divided and under a new buffer between them and vienna . 
  well , op decided slovenia = carniola kinda , forget styria , istria , carinthia , ... 
  well ... not exactly behind the iron curtain but in slovenia there was a more than 500 years old enclave of ko\u010devje or gottschee germans . 
  hitler decided to make the land german again ( there 's a speach about it when he visited maribor ) and resettled them all over by taking the land ( generally by deportation ) from ethnic slovenes . 
  when the war was over , the new regime was somewhat murderous in it 's thirst for revenge . 
  there 's no german enclave in ko\u010devje nowadays .
