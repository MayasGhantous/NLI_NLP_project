  we have two major groups here in slovenia . 
  one is actually cooperating pretty well with the local municipalities , it was huge news when the first roma graduated to become a policewoman . 
  on the other hand the city opened a roma restaurant to employ adults with no education and school them in employable skills . 
  it closed it 's doors after three or four years when euromoney ran out without a single adult gainfully employed . 
  thanks for finding it , i was just going to the same . 
  seems we have people of a similar mind with our `` stara nova vas '' old new village . 
  using a binary east-west division is also a quick way to piss off a sensitive soul in the ex-yu countries . 
  we were never soviet or under stalin . 
  the founders of third world countries movement and all that . 
  damn ww2 and it 's aftermath . 
  yeah ... [ how about ** nope ** ] ( http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article4587109.ece ) . 
  migrants mainly want germany and nordics , if they have n't heard of it from smuggler pr they do n't want it . 
  edit : since bot reminded me the article was behind a paywall , [ here ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/eus-deep-dilemmas-over-refugees-laid-bare-at-malta-summit ) is one from the guardian talking about the same problem . 
  usually said by an irate mother to the kids . 
  i always saw it as half a warning - mirna bosna ... ... or else . 
  i think this one 's universal . 
  similar in slovenia you know people are impressed when they say * ni slabo * - not bad , instead of `` that 's good '' . 
  from slovenian : * * se naredi francoza * - pretending to be french  someone ignoring you , avoiding work ( because they did n't hear you ask for whatever ) or leaves without saying goodbye . 
  * * \u0160panska vas * - spanish village  as in this is a spanish village to me - i do n't get it - this is completely foreign to me . 
  * * to je bla\u017eev \u017eegen . 
  * - that 's a ( st. ) blaise 's blessing . 
   something completely useless . 
  there 's a vulgar version of it - useful as an ewe 's dick . 
  * - staring like a calf at the new door . 
   someone completely dumbstruck or when you have a feeling they 're nodding and listening without hearing and understanding . 
  * a smith 's mare is never shoed . 
   if you 're a plumber , chances are something in the house is leaking because you 're getting to it instead of having it done . 
  * - it 's too late to ring the bells after the hail . 
   warnings and what ifs after events are useless . 
  also kinda works instead of everyone is a general after battle . 
  * - no soup gets eaten as hot as it 's cooked . 
   when you have a big problem you need to step back , let heads cool a bit and then go solve it . 
  i 'm a bit skeptical they 've got everything in slovenia . 
  there 's a lot of places where sv . 
  vid became \u0160entvid , sv . 
  peter - \u0160empeter , sv . 
  pavel - \u0160empavel and so on . 
  there are also villages like andra\u017e - which is still called \u0160entandre\u017e by locals however the communist era erased sv . 
  from the former official name . 
  i 'm a proud cultural catholic . 
  oh , yeah we have a few of those with croatian . 
  '' stol '' is chair in slovenian , table in croatian . 
  '' \u010crna '' black in slovenia and `` crvena '' red in croatian - not exactly false friends , but confused me as a kid . 
  and we actually have the west-toilet dilemma with `` zahod '' as well . 
  thanks for the link , here 's a sketch of a [ serbian on a slovenian border ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxkws3oaars ) . 
  the border control officer has a wonderful serbian accent . 
  just like '' drkati '' can mean skating on ice according to sskj . 
  those crossing without id are crossing the border irregularly and fingerprints should already be reported to the eurodac . 
  the problem is how do you delineate legally between visitor to the country and a migrant at the moment they are crossing ? 
  eu might implement , say , mandatory fingerprinting and photographing for people coming from countries that require visa , but you ca n't just fingerprint a bunch of people and store that information in a database just because you have a feeling there 's a future criminal in there . 
  that 's a gross invasion of privacy . 
  btw austria does not hold a schengen border . 
  there are a bunch of interviews with the migrants and refugees in transit camp on yt and pretty much no-one wanted to apply here because we 're too poor ( in their own words ) . 
  they just * need * to get germany ( or sometimes denmark or sweden ) . 
  even luxembourg has problems with invites . 
   ... we 're surprised when they end up with five identities with two genders in three different refugee shelters in three different states in germany . 
  how 's that the a failing of austria ? 
  should n't the asylum seeker be properly documented the first time they apply and get flagged when he try to do it elsewhere a second time ? 
  the rules are there , the problem is they are n't being enforced . 
  often times they are n't enforceable due to lack of support and personel . 
  italy and greece have been screaming for help for years before lat summer - but you know , out of site out of mind . 
  because how can greece stop the influx on her own ? 
  in the middle of a social and financial break-down with little to no assistance from frontex ? 
  last time i visited , i was waved through with a quick glance at the id both ways . 
  it 's been a few years tough maybe things changed . 
  but still , why not digitally register the passport of a pakistani , iraqi or whomever is crossing like they would do with me ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  what data exactly ? 
  are we talking criminals or your average citizens ? 
  if the borders are free within schengen , then we know when they enter the zone and when they leave it . 
  it is in this sense a united territory that people can traverse freely . 
  same as with me visiting serbia . 
  if you 're talking fingerprinting , no-one fingerprints me for traveling to serbia , no-one has my fingerprints in an eu database either ( that i know of ) . 
  in slovenian * pokoj * is only used in the sense of eternal peace ( of the dead ) . 
  the dead are * pokojni * . 
  also * upokojiti se * means to retire from work , a pension is * pokojnina * and a senior with a pesnion is * upokojenec * . 
  miss the u - and you just called your grandpa dead . 
   i 've heard of * miroslav * before , however we also have * \u010crtomir * ( pacifier of devils/hate ) , * ljubomir * ( one that holds peace dear ) and * bogomir * ( god 's peace ) . 
  we seemed to have gone the peace route pretty hard . 
  well if they 're in europol database when fingerprinted they would be flagged i 'd guess . 
  austrians would know it then , right ? 
  eurodac affects all eu member states plus norway , iceland and switzerland , not just schengen countries . 
  of course no-one wants to claim a hot-potato to hold just because . 
  if they have papers to cross and are not applying to asylum , fingerprints are n't put in . 
  they check them against criminal databases and the fingerprints of applicants for asylum in austria are kept . 
  an interesting thing - in slovenian : * mir * means peace and * svit * means first light at dawn . 
  makes sense according to the roots . 
  the new spiffy graphic should have use dot-dash not dash-dash line denoting larger distance . 
  however this is a head scratcher to me as well . 
  i found it somewhat baffling albanian would be more connected with slovenian than a geographically closer nation . 
  after all venetian influence should be as big on croatian if not larger since the majority of slovenian territory was for centuries under austrian influence . 
  on the other hand ottoman contact was much less this far north . 
  seeing the list i have a sneaking suspicion some words are misrepresented ; for instance slovenian does have * \u017eena * , but it exclusively means wife . 
  if you mean woman it would be * \u017eenska * - at least as far as modern language goes . 
  when i was in high-school i was part of the students parliament . 
  anyway we got visited by the us ambassador for a day - we were mainly asking questions about climate change , kyoto , coal and oil followed by patriot act , iraq and alleged wmds - but at the end one actually asked him directly if he 's aware of the reputation his president has and if it embarrassed him . 
  the answer was that bush went to harvard so he must be intelligent and he 's actually just being approachable and warm by being a bit folksy . 
  the ambassador never visited us again . 
  bush addresed the wrong country in a public speech while he was visiting here . 
  well in / r/slovenia just for the last month in or so we had has a boyfriend asking for recipes of national dishes to cook for his slovenian girlfriend from around nitra and an argentinian trying to fin help for a stranded slovakian tourist .
