  that 'll be a barrel of fun with mountains and minefields . 
  people tend to forget croatia is also part of eu and the dublin applies to all eu states not just the schengen zone .

  on yugoslavia :  tito wakes up in the morning after new year 's eve and sees fresh snow has fallen in the night . 
  he steps to the window and notices in yellow below his window '' happy new year , marshal tito ! '' angered he calls for an investigation and an hour latter he gets a nervous report . 
  the urine is from comrade rankovi\u0107 and the handwriting is jovankas ( tito 's wife ) . 
  there were also some on \u0160piljaks intellectual prowess :  ** a : ** did you know \u0160piljak has a french education ? 
  ** a : ** when he was little he got hit on the head with a french wrench ( adjustable spanner ) . 
   an american , a soviet and a yugoslavian surgeon are boasting about their greatest achievements . 
   american boasts : a guy got his legs cut off by a train and we managed to get them back on no problem . 
  now he 's the world champion in marathon . 
   soviet boast : a worker lost both his hands when they got caught in a machine and it shredded them . 
  we fixed them right away and now he does triple the normative work . 
   yugoslavian boast : you two are great , but listen to this . 
  during the war a grenade hit our commander and he ended up in pieces all over a meadow . 
  we managed to get him back together but there was a piece missing .

  wan na ** really ** piss them off ?

  thanks for the smile . 
  now i can laugh since no-one was seriously hurt . 
  the research you linked is an excerpt of an article that 's comparing manual bone age rating to computerized bone age rating . 
  i see no clams in the article as to the alignment of the bone and chronological age . 
  furthermore the conclusions clam confidence in identifying bone age for males in the range of 2,5 - 17 years of age ( which mean it does not include adults ) . 
  the range for females is narrower which makes perfect sense . 
  the problem are n't pre and peri-pubescent children so i do n't know where the 12yo comes in . 
  the development is less marked between late teens and early twenties which is why it 's harder to pinpoint the exact age of self-proclaimed minors if they are barely in their twenties . 
  especially if they were subjected to less than favorable environment during their youth . 
  we are talking about late teens , are n't we ? 
   http://www.academicradiology.org/article/s1076-6332 ( 10 ) 00312-0 / abstract not really that helpful . 
  the study does n't not include adults and unhealthy children are excluded . 
  you would be hard pressed to apply this method as is to middle-eastern children from a war zone where poor health care and malnutrition are more prevalent . 
  not at that age frame - late teen vs early twenties . 
  teeth eruption is generally concluded by the middle teens and wisdom teeth are generally somewhat unreliable age indicators . 
  mandibular growth would still be present but the teeth would n't be much help . 
  that together with some of the other ossifying bones . 
  the problem is that bone , dental and chronological age can be a few years apart in any direction tough usually not all of them . 
  not a joke . 
  this is a [ thing ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/stefonknee-wolschtt-transgender-father-leaves-family-in-toronto-to-start-new-life-as-a-six-year-old-a6769051.html ) . 
  * warning * : reader my loose some hope in humanity, 
  and then they jump into a chlorinated pool ... :d, 
  yeah , i was the same as a kid . 
  now i 'm the same light brown as the above picture . 
  always had really dark brown ( looking black in pictures ) eyes tough . 
  but if i 'm the same as my family they 'll get amber once i hit my middle age . 
  my ~ ~ hare ~ ~ hair is a touch lighter . 
  the actual color does depend on the time of year , my hear quickly gets proper blonde highlights in summer sun while the hair above the napes stays brown . 
  i get called blonde in the late summer and early fall , but now most would say i 'm a brunette . 
  i was a flaxen haired kid tough . 
  my hair got darker once puberty started . 
  same for my mum . 
  a close relative however was born a dark brunette and is now a lighter shade ( same as me ) since her first pregnancy . 
  lithuania would be a better bet , 
  misleading title imho :  in slovakia , the world 's biggest auto producer per capita , companies are struggling to find ** specialists in the industry ** even as jaguar land rover automotive plc prepares to build the country 's fourth car plant . 
  for hungary and poland , the problem is exacerbated by ** young people moving to britain ** , germany and other places where wages are higher . 
  i do n't know how it is in hungary and poland , but around here the young people moving abroad are uni graduates creating a brain drain . 
  these people are n't just * '' any able-bodied '' workers * . 
  you ca n't fill these positions with a random person off the street . 
  yeah probably , just look at the source article of the linked article . 
  different authors but whole paragraphs were copied without a word changed . 
  it 's seems they do n't even bother with chewing and swallowing the source before spitting it back out for their readers . 
  i 've been on a bus before when a crazy came on . 
  crazy is very intimidating especially when loudly talking at random people . 
  or a drunk . 
  people flailing around with diminished motor control are scary . 
  they just might hit hard without even feeling it much and keep on going . 
  does n't have much to do with the article , but that 's what `` threatening body language '' comes to mind . 
  i would think a more timid person would feel intimidated when someone willfully steps into their personal space even when they keep moving away . 
  it 's awfully subjective . 
  where does then :  half of 600 women said that they were sexually harassed before the age of 18 come from if it was a sample of 300 women ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  from the [ original article ] ( http://www.thelocal.fr/20150416/france-urged-to-act-on-sexual-harassment ) :  the council defined `` gender harrassment '' as `` the imposition of any kind of words of behaviour that are intended to created a situation that is intimidating , humiliating , degrading , or offensive '' . 
  it added that these kind of actions are n't usually physical , and hence are n't punishable by law . 
  i do n't like definitions this broad since they do n't necessarily include harassment based on gender and are prone to include an incredibly broad spectrum of actions . 
  i find this kind of anecdotes much more worrying :  indeed , one 26-year-old woman , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said that paris was the worst city she 'd lived in when it came to sexual harassment . 
   `` the men in paris take a lot of liberties ... it 's like they do n't really care what they say or how it might make someone feel , '' she told the local . 
   `` sometimes i deliberately change train carriages if there are lots of men . 
  i 'd rather not put myself in a situation where i 'm alone with only men because i know what would happen . '', 
  huh . . now that i look at it again it seems that * the independent * copied whole paragraphs from * the local * article by oliver gee word for word . 
  ** shame on you lamiat sabin . 
  i know . 
  :( ( [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/iygc8-l_nme?t=1m40s ) , feel better . 
   a left-wing group calling itself the social democratic people 's bicycle commando claimed responsibility for the arson attacks . 
  that 's how . 
  this article is nearly a year old ... 
  i think the * feel offended * part is crucial here . 
  i remember a few bad lewd jokes in the past year that made me roll my eyes but i did n't waste any time on feeling offended . 
  people in my country get angry at themselves . 
  we 're in top 10 for suicides , ca n't remember any memorable murders around where i live ( besides drunk drivers ) . 
  but i do remember a peer in my town dousing herself in gasoline and burning herself when i ( and she ) was 13 because that was memorable . 
  i knew for sure of 3 teaches that lost close family members by the end of high-school .
