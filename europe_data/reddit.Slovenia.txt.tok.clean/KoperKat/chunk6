  outside of that in the last 2 years ; father of a friend and father of a distant cousin hanged themselves . 
  outsides of that you pretty much only hear about is murder-suicide inside core families . 
  murders over anger/disputes usually become national news . 
  i 'm actually inclined to believe this statement since the crime includes a minor . 
  ca n't imagine the police giving loud or detailed statements about rape of pre/peri-pubescent children no matter who does the crime . 
  we can only hope people that return will spread word that europe is n't as promised . 
  sadly they are probably just as likely to brag how great it was to save face . 
  besides i think paying the plane ticket is still cheaper than administrative and accommodations costs for an asylum applicant to get his case resolved . 
  i meant it in a more broader metaphorical sense . 
  when your own take priority to the point where you se any outsider as lesser . 
  in my mind the halmark of nationalism in comparison to patriotism is the sense of superiority if your own culture in comparison to others . 
  i 'll freely admit it 's because of the historical baggage that nationalism has . 
  patriotism just seem to be a more viable brand , tough the loud us enthusiasm does sours it a little . 
  patriotism is love of self , nationalism is scorn of the other . 
  that 's how if differentiate between the two . 
  and all that without the liver of a whiskey enthusiast or an esophagus of a tobacco chimney . 
  given that public uni is free of tuition here , i 'm aware how subsidized it really is .

  ** mp branko gims said that in regard of the alleged training of salafists that slovenia is safe and that the information on it it was publicized for austria to excuse the closure of borders . 
  austrian newspaper die presse has written this week , that the fighters of extremist sunni group islamic state have supposedly trained in slovenia . 
  the media have reported that in april 2014 the most radical slovenian muslims have gathered with salafists from vienna and graz in the facilities of the sports center korant in dol pri ljubljana . 
  gims - also the chairman of the parliamentary commission for oversight of intelligence and security services - has said after the today 's closed session of the commission that they have widely illuminated the circumstances of the event and concluded that the slovenian services did receive the information on it from the austrian side on time . 
  `` the event was suitably covered , '' he said and explained that the foreign media reporting was misleading . 
  `` it was known the there was shooting with an ordinary air rifle , which is n't a problem in the given case '' he added . 
  grims : closing of border is unpleasant news for austrians as well '' a year and a half old incident has been pulled out of the drawer and reported on in multiple extensive articles which were sadly uncritically summed up in the slovenian media . 
  we are safe in slovenia , publishing obviously stems from austria pushing slovenia from the schengen because they 're closing down the border , since there is no free border crossing , crossing outside official crossings carries draconian penalties and because this is unpleasant news for the austrian citizens , `` he criticized the northern neighbour . 
  ------- just a quick translate - so ** tl ; dr ** in april 2014 slovenian and austrian radical muslims got together and shot a bit with an air rifle . 
  intelligence and security services were aware of this and the meeting seemed to have been covered . 
  slovenia mp says the austrian media is deliberately reporting on it as is training in slovenia to excuse the implemented border control regardless of schengen .

  easy to scapegoat in time of trouble and were n't armed as a group . 
  the higher social strata did n't appreciate anyone below them , sacrificing some heretics to let the proletariat vent in troubled times was preferable to people venting on them . 
  i kinda remember once reading about banking practices in middle ages . 
  it seems that early on both christians and jews were forbidden from lending at a profit to their `` brothers '' because church and old testament say so . 
  this posed a problem , because no businessmen would risk lending money - when he could be investing it himself - while he could n't charge nothing but a nominal fee . 
  of course a jew could lend to a christian at a profit ( and the interest was * sky high * ) . 
  the problem was when the lendee was a local noble/mayor/abby in deep debt . 
  to dispense it he could rile up the people against jesus killers and have them either run off or be killed . 
  that was one of the more interesting theories i 've read . 
  i really do n't like the conflation of anti-semitic and anti-israeli sentiments . 
  i have no opinion on jews , kinda feel sad for their lot in history , but i can say the same for a dozen other groups from native americans to the untouchable caste in india . 
  however i do not agree with israeli foreign politics at all and would n't say a protest against shelling of gaza is anti-semitic in the least .

  i think classic cartoons and especially anime are much easier to dub than actually people . 
  most cartoons only employ three different mouth shapes for any language , so as long as the cadence matches , you 're more or less good . 
  around here only kids cartoons get dubbed and while i 'm not a parent , i 've baby-sat kids before and not needing to read the subtitles while watching a movie makes it much easier . 
  i 'm staunchly against dubbing content geared towards adults tough .

  and we 've lost another amazing voice in such a short span . 
  thats is exactly why we need more talk on this topic . 
  people shy away because they 're afraid to generalize and be called racist . 
  sensitive boundaries need to be breached and the hard info laid out in the light for all to see . 
  it 's much easier to fudge facts when the facts are helluva fuzzy or even non-existant . 
  well , for us it was a matter of numbers ... on the whole our police employs [ 8.226 ] ( http://www.policija.si/index.php/o-policiji?lang= ) take away all the support staff , athletes and divide them into manageable shifts then apply that to around 10.000 refugees we got daily at the hight of the influx . 
  oh , and do n't forget about the actual work inside the borders . 
  there was no way they could have checked every person thoroughly . 
  not at the heat of the moment with the pressure of the international community and pictures of kids and women standing outside checking buildings in the cold looking forlornly .
