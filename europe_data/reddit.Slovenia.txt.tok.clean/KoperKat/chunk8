  it killed him alongside a doctor and a nurse that got infected . 
  it turned out the patient was a hypochondriac hoarding and self-medicating on a plethora of antibiotics . 
  catholic once , catholic for life ... it 's really hard to get yourself of the church logs . 
  true , the article says how big the russian muslim population is , but i 'm pretty sure the vast majority have been settled in and muslim for centuries . 
  same goes for the cypriot and bosnian muslims . 
  these kind of blanket statements are really not representative of reality , because muslim faith is treated as an ethnicity . 
  i went hunting .

  abstract of the paper in the lancet on emergence of the plasmid in question from 18th nov 2015 - http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/piis1473-3099 ( 15 ) 00424-7 / abstract :  ** polymyxin resistance ** was shown to be singularly due to the ** plasmid-mediated mcr-1 gene ** . 
  the plasmid carrying mcr-1 was ** mobilised ** to an e coli recipient at a frequency of 10 \u2212 1 to 10 \u2212 3 cells per recipient cell ** by conjugation ** , and maintained in * k pneumoniae * and * pseudomonas aeruginosa * . 
  in an in-vivo model , production of mcr-1 ** negated the efficacy of colistin ** . 
  [ article on the chinese report in science daily ] ( http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/11/151119095828.htm ) :  the polymyxins ( colistin and polymyxin b ) were the last class of antibiotics in which resistance was incapable of spreading from cell to cell . 
  until now , colistin resistance resulted from chromosomal mutations , making the resistance mechanism unstable and incapable of spreading to other bacteria , '' explains author professor jian-hua liu  because of the relatively low proportion of positive samples taken from humans compared with animals , it is ** likely ** that mcr-1 mediated colistin ** resistance originated in animals and subsequently spread to humans ** [ ... ] the ** selective pressure ** imposed by ** increasingly heavy use of colistin in agriculture ** in china could have led to the acquisition of mcr-1 by e. coli . 
   ** china ** is one of the world 's largest users and producers of ** colistin for agriculture and veterinary use ** . 
  ** worldwide ** , the demand for colistin in agriculture is expected to reach ** almost 12000 tonnes per year ** by the end of 2015 , rising to 16500 tonnes by 2021 . 
  it appears china uses colistin in feed additives . 
  and another [ article on the subject in medscape ] ( http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/854711 ) based on the lancet article that goes more in depth on the actual findings . 
  on the denmark thing [ here 's the source from the article ] ( http://www.dtu.dk/english/news/nyhed?id=ff5ea50d-7c33-44a4-8be8-7cc52417deaf ) - it seems that the mcr-1 sequence was made available on 23rd of november and dtu retested older samples :  the approximately 3000 gram negative coli - og salmonella bacteria , which have previously been mapped using whole genome sequencing , have been reexamined to see whether mcr-1 is present . 
  results show that mcr-1 was found in ** one patient ** , who suffered from a ** blood infection in 2015 ** and in ** five food samples ** that have been ** imported from 2012-2014 ** . 
  all the bacteria are multiresistant esbl bacteria containing the mcr-1 gene , which can further complicate treatment . 
  edit : formatting - theres ( ) in the link of the lancet article :(, 
  come elections - f the future , lets bellyache about the wwii .

  an article about cute cat pictures with no cat pictures :( i want to se a kitty in bowler hat !, 
  i sincerely do n't know how stoping someone from crossing your borders without id became outrageous in the first place ... 
  from the article :  on wednesday , more than 1,000 migrants were stuck on the greek-macedonian border as guards there used racial profiling to determine who should and should not be allowed to cross the border to make their way north . 
  only syrians who could prove their nationality were allowed through . 
  nearly a dozen iranian refugees sewed their mouths shut in a form of protest . 
  wait , what ? 
  yes . 
  headscarfs are banned in public hospitals for the employees . 
  that 's very reasonable since display of religious symbols is generally frowned upon in health care . 
  o_0 i 've seen the exact same comment in the yt section 10 min ago . 
  but when adults behave like 14 year olds ... 
  well i think a short refresher health/sex ed course might be beneficial in freshmen year . 
  consent can be part of it . 
  i know we had one ( 2 hours or so long ) at the student clinic together with the mandatory physical . 
  not to mention they feel entitled to speak for all these groups . 
  and if you 're a part of an absorbed group and do n't agree with that they have to say ? 
  you 're just a poor deluded oppressed fool in need of enlightenment . 
  well , on the other hand we 're talking about a muslim guy whose wife buys a scarf for their 8yo so ymmw on the short part . 
  props for not giving up, 
  do you live in the mountains ? 
  i 'm at the foot of the alps and this november was mainly sunny with temps around 20\u00bac until today when it snowed heavily after midday . 
  i hope not . 
  it makes me feel like that would mean they 've won . 
  just keep yourself safe . 
  french government also has a very strong secular stand . 
  remember the no hijab in school controversy ? 
  this year total is at 194 , by country iraq - 37 , iran - 28 , kosovo 25 , ukraine - 14 , albania - 9 and the a plethora of other nationalities . 
  only 5 syrians so far . 
  under refugee crisis there 's 59 applications .

  btw we 've hit the [ 200.000 ] ( http://www.policija.si/index.php/component/content/article/35-sporocila-za-javnost/81393-podatki-o-tevilu-migrantov-ki-so-vstopili-v-slovenijo-do-13-novembra-do-18-ure ) mark . 
  the number of migrants that have gone through slovenia is now greater than 10 % of our population . 
  i 'm not talking about colds , or feeling a bit down and the like . 
  placebo is powerful when it comes to symptoms of the disease which are modulated by the patients perception - pain , tiredness , ability to concentrate , motivation - and yes this things are very important for the general well-being of a person . 
  i 'm not disputing the effect of placebo on symptoms a patient experiences , hence the * feel * part . 
  but you do n't need to legitimize a pseudo-science field for that . 
  you can tell them to get some vitamin c an lemons for the tea , even tough several studies show the effect is minimal [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15495002 ) [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23440782 ) [ [ wiki ] ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vitamin_c_and_the_common_cold ) , here you can have a look at a [ plethora of remedies ] ( http://www.aafp.org/afp/2012/0715/p153.html ) that people believe in and some studies on them . 
  however quite a few studies show that while patients * feel * better , the actually clinical significance is often minimal : [ [ 3 ] ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19145994 ) the effects of hot drinks on nasal airflow , [ [ 4 ] ] ( http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/95/1/19.full ) placebo effect in oncology - interestingly while some patients had increased appetite there was no significant weight gain , [ [ 5 ] ] ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4351653/ ) placebo effect in asthma :  [ ... ] while most studies have repeatedly shown improvements in subjective measures of disease control , results are conflicting with regard to objective measures . 
  there has been an abundance of research into the placebo effect on objective and subjective measures of asthma . 
  [ ... ] anyway i 'm not saying placebo is useless , it can comfort patients and grant them a better sense of symptom control however it can not supplant regular treatments . 
  homeopathy is expensive water in small bottles , bringing it into a gps office gives it the legitimacy of an aspirin which imho is very troubling . 
  look up some studies on non-compliance . 
  it 's difficult to know why exactly the patients do n't take their medication , but it is a serious issue . 
  and this is anecdotal , but every now and then you get stories of patients [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://whatstheharm.net/homeopathy.html/ ) [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://www.news.com.au/national/aidan-fenton-7-vomited-and-died-after-slapping-therapy/story-fncynjr2-1227329512272 ) [ [ 3 ] ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/national/dead-babys-parents-ignored-advice-qc-20090504-asmt.html ) dying because of homeopathy and other alternative methods . 
  the thing to keep in mind is : `` it used to be that anything could be called a cure , then we tested it and the stuff that works became medicine . '' there is a whole class of drugs , where the exact mechanism of how it works is n't completely understood , yet we use them because research supports their effects . 
  nope . 
  there are placebo pills , come packaged like any other medicine and the doctor can prescribe it . 
  or you can prescribe vitamins or some such . 
  i 've seen it , but it 's still good for a laugh . 
  let me share one of my favorite stand-ups in return : [ dara o'briain : science does n't know everything ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udyba0m6zte ), 
  the placebo effect only makes you * feel * better , it does not in any way * make * you better . 
  the problem is that the patient believes he is being treated and getting better , which might lead to chronic complications due to non-compliance . 
  there are even cases ( anecdotal ) when patients stopped taking their regular medication because they believed they can sustain their health on alternative methods . 
  true , but you 're on * very * shaky ethical ground if you 'd try to advocate charging patients more for a more effective placebo .

  the board advised him to try architecture instead .

  labeling contemporary art as `` degenerate '' and all that .

  i also kinda adore [ kosovel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sre%c4%8dko_kosovel ) who 's my favorite poet by a large margin . 
  yeah sure , but usually the point is to err on side of caution and who still recommends immunoassays as the most accurate test using the more rapid nat and antigen tests as additional tests for higher security . 
  also hiv has a very long period ( three months at minimum if i remember correctly ) of giving false negatives after contracting it . 
  so someone might get tested before donating , but forgot about that not so safe night two and a half month ago on summer vacation , thinking they 're clean .
