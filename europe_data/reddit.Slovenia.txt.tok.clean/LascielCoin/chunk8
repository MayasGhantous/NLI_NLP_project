  am i reading this wrong or are you actually saying that there is a possibility you would fail an `` are you a radical muslim or not ? '', 
  test ? 
  k. also , lmao at your `` guns or no guns , muslims will bring problems wherever they go . '', 
  comment in another thread . 
  since you 're a muslim yourself ( you know , just like the munich kid ) , you 're apparently the problem too . 
  according to your dear leader , people like you should n't even be allowed to live in the us . 
  nope . 
  what i am is right , and what you are is wrong . 
  nothing you say will change the facts . 
  he was not muslim . 
  simple as that . 
  sure , whatever you say . 
  you do know he was born in germany , right ? 
  lived his whole life there , and islam played no part in his life . 
  he was not a part of the religion * or * the civilization of islam . 
  he was a german teenager with muslim parents from iran . 
  he himself was not irani , and he was not muslim . 
  literally nothing you say will convince me that he was a muslim , because he was n't . 
  now kindly take those $ 500 and shove them up your ass instead of wasting my time . 
  i just gave you the official definition of the word `` muslim '' . 
  he does not fit the criteria , therefore he was not a muslim . 
  it really is as simple as that . 
   a muslim , sometimes spelled moslem , relates to a person who ** follows or practises ** the religion of islam , a monotheistic and abrahamic religion based on the quran . 
  that is the official definiton of the word `` muslim '' . 
  this guy was not a muslim . 
  i was right , you were wrong . 
  at this point i already know that you wo n't keep your promise and pay me the $ 500 i obviously won with this `` bet '' , but please just stop making these idiotic excuses , because nothing you say will convince me you were right . 
   he was of irani muslim origin having a muslim origin does not equal being a muslim . 
  i have a christian origin , i was born into a christian family , and i 'm sure as hell not a christian . 
   he was an irani / german shia muslim . 
  stop acting like he was a christian or a buddhist . 
  you 're being completely unreasonable now . 
  he was either an atheist or a converted christian . 
  he was not a muslim . 
   edit : syrian ` refugee ' machetes pregnant woman to death , injures two more in germany - http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/germany-machete-attack-syrian-refugee-8485456 do n't really see what this has to do with you owing me $ 500 for being wrong ? 
  i 'm well aware of the existence of islamic terrorism . 
  this kid from munich , however , was not a muslim terrorist . 
   the allah huakbar thing is neither confirmed true nor false , so i will not include it . 
  it 's confirmed false , but okay . 
   the point is there is still a muslim link here even though its in a very indirect way . 
  that does n't make him a muslim . 
   not to mention all the other attacks a few days and weeks ago in europe and the one in orlando that had everything to do with muslims / islam . 
  are you suddnely going to forget all of those now and pretend that islam has n't compromised the safety of europe already ? 
  those attacks have nothing to do with a shooting spree done by an angry , mentally unstable teenager . 
  they were radical muslims , he was n't religious . 
   do you have any idea whats in store for europe in the near future ? 
  there are going to be attacks nearly every month . 
  france alone has been attacked thrice by muslims in the past 2 years alone . 
  bataclan was in november 2015 . 
  brussels , germany axe and cologne rape , muslim pedophile rings in britain , mass rapes and assaults in sweden by muslims etc. 
  cool story . 
  i want my $ 500 now . 
  that has been proven false by literally every trustworthy news source out there . 
  the only witness for the `` allahu akbar '' thing was an anonymous cnn source , who apparently heard it from behind a door/wall . 
  even if the words were actually said ( which they almost definitely were n't , as nobody else in there heard him say it ) , they could have easily been said by one of the victims , and not the attacker . 
  the authorities speculated that the use of david as a first name could suggest that the killer had converted to christianity at some point in the past . 
  his parents said he was not a practicing member of any religion . 
  so whatever he was , he was definitely not a muslim . 
  and yet i was right and your article was wrong . 
  bye now !, 
  muslim is a religion , not a race , not a nationality . 
  unless you practice it , you 're not a muslim . 
  i was born into a christian family too , and that definitely does n't make me a christian . 
  he was a german teenager with iranian parents . 
  not a muslim . 
  primary does not mean reliable . 
  which is why the more trustworthy news sources tend to stick to the facts while the incident is still unfolding . 
  unlike trash like cnn and fox news , which started calling people in the mall to ask them what 's happening . 
   yeah , like i said , your mouth works faster than your head . 
  we 're done . 
  the words of someone who has clearly lost an argument and is n't mature enough to admit it . 
   and as a parting gift , here are some studies and articles that support my claims about eyewitness unreliability : http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/10/how-reliable-eyewitness-testimony-scientists-weigh http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-the-eyes-have-it/ http://www.simplypsychology.org/eyewitness-testimony.html https://agora.stanford.edu/sjls/issue%20one/fisher&amp;tversky.htm http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr06/eyewitness.aspx and this is why nobody in their right mind takes something said by an eyewitness immediately after something traumatic happened as fact without doing some fact checking first . 
  we 've had two bigger attacks in the past two weeks , and in both cases eye witnesses proved to be extremely unreliable . 
  it 's a good thing i did n't , because the eyewitness was lying . 
   the claim came from eye witnesses , a first hand account . 
  that 's called a `` primary source '' and is considered reliable unless proven otherwise . 
  holy shit . 
  since when ?? 
  first eye witness accounts are notoriously unreliable and lead to wrong information 90 % of the time . 
  all trustworthy news sources tend to stay away from that shit and only post the inormation they get from etiher the local police spokesperson or their reporters on the scene . 
  eyewitnesses claimed that there were hostage situations in nice , that the eiffell tower was hit with a bomb , that there were 2-3 separate attackers in munich and at least one of them was yelling allahu akhbar , etc. 
  and these are just the most recent two big world events . 
  he was not a muslim , even though he had iranian roots . 
  islam is a religion , not a race . 
  and he was not practicing the religion . 
  his attack was not religious in nature , and could not be further away from anything isis-related . 
  the kid was idolizing breivik , for fuck 's sake . 
  so where 's my $ 500 ? 
  nope , never contacted me and is still refusing to accept the facts . 
  i feel like i 'm not going to see those 500 $ anytime soon . 
  [ i went for a more simplistic approach . 
  yes . 
  he was apparently inspired by breivik . 
   if they report it , you can be 99 % sure it 's true until someone else says otherwise . 
  [ they are saying otherwise . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36874497 ) the telegraph deleted their `` allahu akhbar '' link you posted , because it obviously was n't true . 
  it was a shot in the dark , and they were wrong . 
  quality journalism right there . 
  the breivik thing happened in 2011 , but i 'm not sure why that matters . 
  non-muslim [ rampage killers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_rampage_killers ) do pop up in europe from time to time .
