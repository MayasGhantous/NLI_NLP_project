  usually countries with lower gdp will have cheaper products . 
  no i am pretty sure this is a cheaper way , not to mention you only need to buy one ticket , that you use through your entire journey . 
  if you would buy each ticket individually , you can also lose a lot time just waiting in line to buy your tickets . 
  for supplies we visited local supermarkets . 
  for cooking , some hostels provide small kitchens where you can prepare meals for yourself . 
  just check before if the hostel has a kitchen you can use and you should be fine . 
  oh , and a bit of advice . 
  try to stock up on food in countries with cheaper food . 
  it can save you a lot of money . 
  i dont know of any better alternatives , i think interrail is probably the cheapest and easiest way to travel europe by train . 
  me and my friends followed a country path that looked like this : slovenia , czech republic , poland , germany , austria and back to slovenia . 
  so we just made like a big circle around central europe . 
  that would probably be my recommendation . 
  just make a solid plan to travel across countries in such a circular shape . 
  otherwise you might spend a lot of time getting from one place to another , travelling with trains . 
  when i travelled we always called the hostels two days in advance to make sure they had available rooms . 
  depends on the time of the year honestly . 
  during any sort of vacations it can be a challenge to get a room without reservation . 
  when i travelled with interrail we wanted to spend a night in krakow . 
  that was the only time we did n't try to reserve a hostel in advance and it turned up that they had at the time this big music festival in krakow and everywhere was full . 
  literally everywhere . 
  we checked all hostels and hotels we could find and still got nothing . 
  we ended up skipping krakow and headed straight to berlin instead . 
  regarding food we made our own breakfast and dinner , but ate lunch in restaurants . 
  if you are looking to travel by train across europe visiting http://www.interrail.eu/ seems to be an obvious choice . 
  i went on a trip with friends by interrail and was very satisfied with it . 
  hey , sorry that it took long to respond , i was away from my computer . 
  i cant say that i know the website well , i found it recently , however it seems to me that the people who work on their articles are much less biased about the whole refugee situation , when compared with some other , bigger , slovenian news agencies . 
  to conclude i thought this article was interesting and decided to translate it , but i can not claim that all of their articles are of the same quality , because i do not know the site well enough . 
  ** this article was written by lucija \u010cak\u0161 for webpage domovina.je . 
  * ** last weekend migrants started coming to slovenia in larger numbers . 
  one can notice the condition of this poor people -- dirty , cold , hungry , exhausted ... media with focusing only on the most horrible cases makes even a bigger sensation of the whole thing . 
  * ** on the evening news of one of the tv stations they reported about a 15 year old mother of a ten days old baby -- she gave birth with a caesarean section and she is already continuing with her path . 
  even more disturbing is that the baby was n't showing any signs of life , so a slovenian medical team had to resuscitate him . 
  luckily they were successful . 
  * ** however there is no need to inflict guilt upon people with this sort of news -- everyone feels horrible about such news . 
  especially mothers who gave birth and know that ten day after giving birth to a child , even a walk from bedroom to kitchen can be very difficult . 
  walking through rain and cold in a foreign country , without hot meals and any certainty where will you sleep tonight , seems completely inhumane for a new mother . 
  more so after having a child with a section , which is a difficult operation that requires long term and slow recovery . 
  everyone feels sympathy and wants to help . 
  * ** at the same time one ca n't help but wonder what is forcing these women , in their late pregnancy right before their childbirth , to embark on such a difficult and hazardous journey . 
  the answer seems obvious -- they are refugees and are running from war . 
  * ** but they are safe from war approximately 1000 kilometres before they give birth in the fields of rigonce ( settlement on slovenia -- croatia border , where many immigrants are crossing the border ) or in reception centre in bre\u017eice . 
  they could have waited in refugee camps in the middle east or turkey , if not there , they could have anywhere on their route ask for asylum and then in a warm , dry maternity hospital receive necessary help even days after their child labour , regain their strength there and at least for some time , stay in the country where they gave birth . 
  they and their newborn babies would be looked after and safe . 
  in such a state nobody would throw them out of the hospital or an asylum home . 
  * ** from personal experience i know a woman will act instinctively to protect her baby . 
  she `` nests , '' finds a safe shelter for herself and the baby , where she can spend first days after the labour , during which she and her child are most vulnerable . 
  * ** among many refugee women who are in their high pregnancy and are being shown on the television , and those who are travelling with really small children , this ca n't be noticed . 
  it seems irresponsible to carry on with their journey in such a condition . 
  especially since majority of the immigrants are said to be educated people , they should know to what risks are pregnant women and newborn babies exposed . 
  * ** refugees are appalled by the countries they cross , for which they claim they treat them like animals . 
  this , at least in slovenian example , is certainly not true . 
  the police , civil defence , medical staff , volunteers , all try their best , work twelve hours a day , every day , to ensure every person who crosses the border , can receive decent living conditions . 
  and if they asked for asylum , they would try to find them a place to stay as soon as possible . 
  * ** slovenian peace institute wrote and appeal to the government to build a refugee settlement on an adequate location , where thousands of refugees , which keep on coming , can stay during the winter . 
  i am not sure how they can not notice , that none of them really want to stay in slovenia . 
  not even to just wait here for the winter to pass . 
  not even the old , the pregnant , the mothers with newborn babies , ten days after their sections . 
  they just want to keep on going towards the next border . 
  seveda jim je treba pomagati , mnogi so res v ubogem stanju . 
  * ** `` they are running from war , we need to help them because they have no choice '' people tell me in the recent days . 
  of course we need to help them ; many of them are in a pitiful situation . 
  but a choice they certainly have . 
  even if they are refugees running away from war , they really , really do n't need to all go to germany . 
  i was translating and editing this in a bit of a hurry so i hope you can excuse any mistakes which you might find . 
  if you have difficulties understanding anything , comment it , and i will try to make it more understandable . 
  ** this is a translation of comments a member of the slovenian civil defence named matija kolari\u010d ( resident of bre\u017eice ) made . 
  * ** `` because a lot of people write about the refugee situation and because mostly they use unverified information , i would like to share with you my experience '' , says kolari\u010d . 
  * ** kolari\u010d says the situation is not black and white and the refugees are neither problematic nor poor , this depends from one group of migrants to another . 
  * ** `` the first group of migrants which arrived in bre\u017eice on monday was quite problematic . 
  they burned their tents , fought each other for food and left a mess after them . 
  the second group which arrived on tuesday was a complete opposite . 
  they organized themselves when we were sharing food , '' he writes and adds that they prevented fighting for food on their own , by forming lines and they saved some food for the sleeping children as well , besides that they also helped the civil defence and the red cross by searching for relatives who got separated from their families within the camp . 
  ** ** `` everything is running smoothly as it should , there is a hierarchy . 
  first the migrants are registered , then they first take the families with small children and the sick people . 
  medical service takes care of the sick and injured . 
  red cross is distributing food . 
  * ** only problems he sees is in some activists , and describes a case of a polish activist , who on her own in front of 1500 migrants brought 4 sandwiches . 
  `` you can imagine what kind of scuffle and unrest she caused by doing that . 
  * ** besides that the activist in majority showed up only when they were distributing food and were criticizing the available food , by saying some refugees do n't want to eat it because it 's too dry ( bread , cheese spread , sardines , apples , milk , water ) . 
  * ** `` when members of the civil defence and the red cross were clearing all the mess after the first group of refugees , there were no activists present during the cleaning process ; they were later on prancing around in their jackets `` no borders '' or `` we are all equal '' inscriptions '' , he says . 
  ti so re\u0161ili marsikatero te\u017eavo . '' * ** `` it is easy to distribute food . 
  it 's harder to clean food on the ground and carry porter potty 's in your hands . 
  there is never enough people for cleaning . 
  if someone wants to be useful , let him help there . 
  we have enough people for food distribution . 
  the exception are translator volunteers . 
  they helped us with solving many problems . '' ** * mnogo lepih besed kolari\u010d namenja policistom . `` policistom kapo dol . 
  * ** kolari\u010d says many nice things about the police . 
  `` hats down to the police . 
  most of them are working their second or third 12 hour shift in the last two days . 
  they are very respectful towards the migrants , except when order needs to be restored '' , he writes and adds there were many thank you from refugees to the police . 
  * ** however he ca n't find nice words about the journalists , `` without words . 
  vultures without a heart or soul . 
  they are looking for the best possible shot and think only about the most sensationalistic title , with which they can present only what they want to . '' ** * `` \u017divim v bre\u017eicah , pa do v\u010deraj nisem vedel kak\u0161na je situacija v sprejemnem centru . 
  * ** he was shaken by this entire situation . 
  `` i live in bre\u017eice , and i until yesterday never knew what the situation is like in the reception centre . 
  i felt like i was in some other country in some other time , '' he writes . 
  * ** `` situation is not black and white , as some try to show it .
