greenland even specifically left the european economic community ( eu before it became eu ) in 1985 . 
  granted , it 's been over 1000 years ago and not a colony , but hey . 
  that said , oman and south korea have nothing in common either . 
  or iran and philippines . 
  just giving examples . 
  tbilisi , baku and yerevan are also in asia , just sayin ' . 
  technically , nicosia is too , but ... 
  bogu za hrbtom - `` behind god 's back '' and we sometimes steal serbo-croatian `` vukojebina '' . 
  any other ? 
  not that i can think of at the moment . 
  i know , i keep using it for no other real reason than `` because i can '' . 
  thanks anyway . 
  nope , you just end up piling up debts after debts . 
  1 milliard new denbts last year ? 
  no problem , we will do 1 milliard per day nao , surez !, 
  however , if elections are indeed in june the people will surely just vote for same parties again . 
  we 're so stupid ... just try not voting for all the same old parties again and again ( or the nth reincarnation of lds ( zares , ps , \u0161oltes , whoever 's next ) . 
  and anyway , they take summer off anyway , not much of a difference if there is a government before autumn or not . 
  on top of a hill ? 
  [ sure is . 
  cool , 
  i only know so much . 
  :( well , i know russian and greek , too , but i 'm too lazy finding non-latin script characters . 
  an example of a simple convo : `` a b ? '', 
  which translates to something like `` would you ? '', 
  `` i would . '', 
  so , frugal indeed . 
  they do n't drink in riga ? 
  that would explain the `` weird '' part . 
  except these guys are n't mongols , but tuvans . 
  good news ? 
  well , apparently we placed 2nd in men 's youth ( u19 ) world handball championship or some such . 
  refer to the [ maps and tables if you scroll a bit down ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/languages_of_the_european_union#knowledge ) . 
  except for romania ( especially french ) , knowledge of french or spanish is about as useful as knowledge of portuguese or norwegian . 
  german has been lingua-franca in central europe for the last 1000 years or so . 
  until english took over . 
  it is called [ assumption ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assumption_of_mary ) . 
  like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/door_to_hell ) . 
  edit : must admit that guatemala one looks more scary , though . 
  and ^ here ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ ^ thinking ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ albanians ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kosovo . 
  i see , thanks . 
  whatever , guys . 
  also inform your brothers to the east about this abomination .

  however , they did manage to get ko\u0161ick\u00fd kraj correctly , not turning it into ko\u0161icesk\u00fd or ko\u0161icsk\u00fd or similar . 
  i know , right ... 
  there 's an even worse one `` pra\u017esk\u00fd '' . 
  ~ ~ ipad might be a better example for that . ~ ~ apparently not, 
  happy cakeday !, 
  well , they 're all german now . 
  flairs that is . 
  got ta ask your government that . 
  i believe that 's how `` ethnic '' groups are specified in uk census . 
  spomin\u010dice ) '' from spomin - memory , so it 'd be something like `` remember-me '' i suppose or rather `` remember-flower '' . 
  not sure what words to use exactly . 
  it has definitely something to do with remembering . 
  these are [ iso 2-letter country codes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_3166-1_alpha-2 ) . 
  ** s ** loven ** i ** a, 
  and have vienna in charge ? 
  no , you 're quite right , it is z. 
  first word in that sentence reads `` zbog '' - `` because of '' . 
  well , we also actually say `` ser '' . 
  mostly . 
  at least in some parts of the country . 
  make a tiny little ddr for them and throw them in . 
  xd ` nuff said . 
  yes , cold war ended almost a quarter of a century ago . 
  you do . 
  i 've heard somewhere slovenia and greece are tied first in eu . 
  i 'd imagine norway and switzerland to be ahead , though i ca n't confirm anything . 
  montenegro is definitely extremely mountainous . 
  spain can not be too far behind either . 
  and many small countries . 
  ** facts : ** it depends on the definition of mountainous . 
  i 've searched but have n't come across any neutral source , just a lot of touristic , propaganda and/or otherwise biased material placing different countries on top . 
  it 's definitely not netherlands or belarus . 
  so full of awe should be better than some of awe ( awesome ) , yet it turned out completely different . 
  awesome english !, 
  no clue , sorry .

  well , there 's [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jolla_%28mobile_phone%29 ) . 
  well , there 's folks here ( your average voter , not politicians ) arguing to do away with proportional representation , because reasons * , and implement something like what uk has , which would in our case effectively kill all but 2-3 parties , at least , only 2 would normally get any seats . 
  ( * ) mainly because there 's trouble forming a coalition as of late and the winning party would thus get  50 % seats so no need to form a coalition . 
  well , sucks to be the other 50-60 % who did n't vote for either of the two biggest parties .

  [ average vs median ] ( http://www.vocabulary.com/articles/chooseyourwords/mean-median-average/ ) . 
  do n't confuse the two . 
  literally low-land . 
  it 'd be better to put them on the left and have frames/boxes all same size . 
  as already mentioned / r/france or perhaps / r/vexillology are good examples . 
  yeah , i call bullshit , [ he can do it for weeks ] ( http://www.theonion.com/article/michael-phelps-28913 ) , and he 's not exactly unhealthy . 
  also : [ exit ] ( http://www.exitfest.org/en ) in serbia ( 9-12 july ) . 
  ( never been there myself , but heard good things about . ), 
  a satellite dish is one thing , but an audi q7 parked in front of said run-down house , quite another . 
  or at least , that 's what happens here , sometimes . 
  actually , `` france wants to spy on everyone and fighting terrorism sounds like a good enough excuse to go for it . '', 
  merci beaucoup .
