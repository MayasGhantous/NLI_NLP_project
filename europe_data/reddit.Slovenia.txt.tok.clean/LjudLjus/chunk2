  that 's exactly what the map says . 
  it has c as [ k / \u03b8 ] in most of spain except some parts in andalusia and catalan and basque speaking parts . 
  if you insist . 
  you can start by returning faroe islands and greenland to norway . 
  return sk\u00e5ne to denmark !, 
  ok , i 'm going too far here . 
  no need for tunnel anymore !, 
  obviously french accent and spanish efficiency . 
  just move copenhagen to jutland , problem solved !, 
  i must be lucky , never encountered something so weird . 
  i guess the worst ( appart from not knowing my country even exists ) is saying `` near/next to russia '' . 
  no way , german sounds annoyingly german and dutch sounds like the ugliest language yet .

  uh , er . . well , emm . . 
  most boring ? 
  considering i have n't really traveled all that much , i 'd tend to pick something i know least about , say belarus or moldova . 
  but i might go for something different , like the netherlands . 
  as for the most interesting , italy , france , albania and bosnia & herzegovina come to mind due to various reasons . 
  yes , you 're right about belarus , it 's indeed utc +3 . 
  azerbaijan , armenia and georgia are all utc +4 , however . 
  azerbaijan is utc +5 in summer , but +4 in winter , the other two are +4 all year , from what i can tell . 
  what exactly would be inaccurate about this map ? 
  i believe it 's fairly right . 
  you meant to say this is winter time map , right ? 
  because cet is labeled as utc +1 , eet as utc +2 , etc. 
  which is winter . 
  in summer , cest is utc +2 , so map would be wrong for summer . 
  errmm , i do n't get it . 
  do n't you guys have superlong days in the summer , so dst does n't really matter all that much , or does it ? 
  but in the winter the clock ... oh , you 'd want dst in winter so sun stays up 1h longer ? 
  y' all should just switch work to start 1h earlier . 
  subtle , not too much , though ; i 'd just have to actually read it . 
  i believe you 're quiet right , however , i keep reading that everything that 's wrong with economy/politics is his fault , because reasons . 
  if you ever get bored , you can move south-west . 
  same thing going on here . 
  ca n't really decide . 
  someplace else in central europe , because culture and stuff . 
  so i guess i 'd be picking among croatia ( not dalmatia ) , austria ( not vienna ) , slovakia , maybe czech rep. and bavaria . 
  near mountains as well , preferably . 
  and forest , of course . 
  nothing , that 's italian . 
  just the song ( ali en - sirni & mesni ) starts like that , no idea why ; could be something something eros , but not sure . 
  i read that as `` it used to be 1st until the 19th century , but now it 's 2nd '' . 
  apparently i 'm understanding it wrong , sorry . 
   france to second rank but russia and germany ... 
  [ wiktionary ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kocka ) says it got in hungarian from slavic . 
  i do n't have a better source , unfortunately . 
  yeh , i know about rama . 
  it 's also margarine , not butter , fyi . 
  as in cube ? 
  magyars are slavic in denial , confirmed . 
  needs more vatrogasci . 
   on 4 june 2014 , the slovak parliament approved a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage there 's also [ slovakia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_slovakia ) . 
  yay for downvoting what we do n't agree with . 
  whatever happened to reddiquette . 
  surprised to see epp supporting this . 
  would n't expect that , to be honest . 
  yes , i 've noticed . 
  we do have one such word , namely `` inozemec '' , meaning someone from another country/land , but it 's basically never used . 
  like `` tujec '' ? 
  wait , japan is that small ? 
  dunno why i thought it 's like twice the size it is . 
  hmm . . there 's : bled - means ` pale ' , podsreda - under wednesday ( ? 
  thursday , murska sobota - mura saturday ( or something like that ) , as well as velika nedelja and mala nedelja - big and small sunday . 
  ca n't think of any other at the moment . 
  we 're not very crazy , methinks . 
  ketchup is an abomination to pizza . 
  well , to all things tomato even . 
  edit : a word . 
  i 'm thinking : [ predjamski grad ( predjama ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/predjama.jpg ) because location . 
  [ celjski grad ( celje ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/celjski_grad_s_pe%c4%8dovnika.jpg ) has a nice wall/fortification . 
  i 've likely missed some great one , so if someone 's enlightened enough feel free to add to the list . 
  never , unless you vote for yourself perhaps . 
  but i would n't be too sure even in that case . 
  i saw this , i kid you not , map ( ca n't find it right now ) , not sure if it was meant to represent slovenia or slovakia ; anyway , it had a shape of slovenia and on the coast there was a dot with a word ` bratislava ' written next to it . 
  no other cities/rivers/etc shown . 
  no , seriously . 
  a turk . 
  it 's a naming dispute . 
  the official long name of the country is republic of macedonia , but there 's also a region called macedonia ( makedonia ? ), 
  in greece . 
  now in the past , hundreds and thousands of years ago the region of macedonia ( for some time also a kingdom ) was a mostly greek speaking area located in modern northern greece , republic of macedonia and south-western bulgaria . 
  now , greeks refuse the ex-yugoslav republic to use the name macedonia , since they claim it implies/promotes territorial claims/irredentism among other things . 
  therefore the country was accepted in the un under the provisional description `` the former yugoslav republic of macedonia '' , which itself is not a name , but a description , hence `` former '' not being capitalized . 
  more [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_naming_dispute ) . 
  nice , i still keep mixing up nebraska and oklahoma ( and they do n't even border :( ) . 
  so na\u00efve ... :p, 
  and \u0439 is not a letter , it 's like \u0438 with something funny on top , same for \u0457 or \u0491 . 
  so , no sooner than year 10000 ? 
  sounds about right . 
  if \u010cokoladnica rajska ptica , \u010cokoladnica rustika , \u010cokoladnica olimje , etc. 
  count yeah . 
  otherwise , i do n't think so . 
  obviously [ gorenjka ] ( http://www.gorenjka.si/en/ ) . 
   paying with plastic is also more time consuming . 
  and all these awkward `` i 'm looking away while you put in your pin '' postures . 
  oh , good , finally something/someone i can relate to . 
  them foreigners never believe me , when i say that . 
  they claim cash is slower , like whhhh - how , what do you mean slower ?
