  5 seconds if you 're extra slow , yes . 
  or you somehow decide you want to pay those 9 cents with 2 cent and 1 cent coins , not just get 1 in return . 
  but that 's rare . 
  yes , ma\u0142ysz is/was one of a kind , just do n't become finland pretty please . 
  it 's so sad to see them nowhere after being top3 for so long . 
  please feel free to be second , right behind us . 
  just as long as you poles do n't lose interest in ski jumping . 
  i just have to love your ridiculously detailed wiki pages about [ skokach narciarskich ] ( https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/kategoria:skoki_narciarskie ) . 
  that 's easy : brainwashing by media . 
  people form their `` opinions '' based on what media is feeding them , which is too sad . 
  maybe it 's something like english with present simple , present continuous , past simple , past continuous , future simple , future perfect , present perfect continuous , etc. 
  all being different tenses . 
  i do n't really see a need beyond three or four , mind you , but some languages are weird like that . 
  they . 
  speak . 
  super . 
  slowly . 
  and . 
  carefully . 
  pick . 
  correct . 
  words . 
  maybe . 
  about . 
  max . 
  probably less . 
  met some macedonians recently . 
  when eavesdropping i only figured out that the language is macedonian ( or it could be bulgarian for all i knew , but they frequently mentioned macedonia , so ... ) and maybe i caught every 10th word or so . 
  last one is imis . 
  all on furniture , because floor is lava . 
  of course , 
  should put some \u03bc\u03c0 combo there . 
  yes , yes , i know . 
  i just find those alternating vowels tough . 
  well , there are only 4 tenses , of which only 3 are used ; only 6 cases , so it 's pretty easy . 
  there 's dual ( in addition to singular and plural ) , but that 's a piece of cake . 
  no crazy sounds , only 8 vowels . 
  ca n't see what 's hard guys . 
  other than the fact that nobody speaks the language ( or so they say , or rather michael manske said so ) . 
  not worldwide , in the country i mean . 
  just some weird dialects . 
  and we got quite a few of those considering how few of us there are . 
  there 's more ? 
  \u0150szekevesteherfeszek\u0151l\u0171nyigyorostovekedecs-something-something . 
  could you at least turn all the i 's and e 's in last one to \u0131 's ? 
  that 'd be easier to say . 
  [ bigger gun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwerer_gustav ) you say ? 
  ( go salt yourself ) pismo rosno !, 
  ( not sure how to translate this , maybe `` dewy letter '' or `` young/early letter '' ? ), 
  yeah , i think we win this easily . 
  if by good weather you mean lots of rain , yes . 
  well , vatican only has about 1000 inhabitants . 
  i 'm sure we could reach that . 
  it 's whole uk together . 
  we 're dark green , so at least 3 . 
  maybe even 4 !, 
  in your picture albanian is connected to slovene ( sln - slovenska ) and not to slovak ( slc - slova\u010dka ) . 
  but the size of circles is wrong then . 
  also : czech and slovak are so similar they should be very close , while slovene is closer to croatian , so again , your picture is same as op 's . 
  just the size of circles is wrong . 
  wrong in both pictures , i should add . 
  no , lexical distance is all about vocabulary , not grammar . 
  that said , i also do n't get the slovene-albanian connection . 
  even less so , when polish and russian are further apart ( well , i 'll be honest , i do n't know how close they are , i 'd just expect them closer than slovene and albanian ) . 
  heck , i understand romanian better with just my ( very ) bad french than i understand albanian . 
  i know what you mean . 
  i just pretend it does n't exist . 
  been there , never again . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ speak ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ those . 
  the ones in mcdonald 's ? 
  they seemed perfectly fine that one time i was there . 
  strom ? 
  seriously ? 
  as in , electric current ? 
  you guys are funny . 
  while there really was n't a slovenian majority in trieste , there was a huge majority in all surrounding villages and the whole coast between trieste/trst and monfalcone/tr \u017ei\u010d . 
  so italians could just have their port city without connection to the rest of the country , i do n't care , screw 'em . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ / s but then , most of our current coast had italian majority , if i recall correctly . 
  just the coast towns , though , 5 km inland was slovenian already . 
  \\  implying trst is italian . 
  * slavonia, 
   better basketball team . 
  the worst part of ljubljana is the bus station . 
  it 's just ... no words can describe that . 
  anyway , i 've been to bratislava for a few hours a few years ago , and i have absolutely no memory of train station , so it could n't have been that bad . 
  i call this bs , no way we 're that low . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ten-day_war ) we 're not slovakia . 
  and in case this was a joke , please come up with something new guys , they got old . 
  i , err . . well , eh , you see ... brother nation ? 
  not even montenegro ? 
  ok , sounds reasonable . 
  but how do you toilet break ? 
  eh google ... showing some weird cases there . 
  would n't even trust all are right . 
  looks like polish is in genitive plural ( ? ), 
  and slovenian in genitive singular ( or nominative dual ) , should be `` bilijon '' , if we 're talking about 10 ^ 12 . 
  to misl\u0161 t vahke hvancate ? 
  oh yes , delicious . 
  have n't had them for quite a while , though . 
  oh , that 's an option ?
