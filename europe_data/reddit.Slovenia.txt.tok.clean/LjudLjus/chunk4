  never realised , thanks . 
  in that case , i apologise . 
  i know it 's not an independant country , but do check [ wales ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s07ku6zhfyg ) ( if you do n't know it yet ) . 
  it 's easily top3 for me , along with russian and ddr . 
  also nepal is cool , off the top of my head . 
  oh , it very much exists . 
  200 euro banknote , on the other hand ... 
  since 200 $ notes do n't exist , very hard !, 
  really , have you seen a 200 $ banknote before ? 
  even banks do n't have them . 
  * they * just want us to believe the notes exist . 
  why use two letters when you can use only one ? 
   taxes are going up they would , anyway . 
  yes , i guess you 're right about situation with isis . 
  as failed state as niger otherwise is , it looks like they got at least that taken care of , as soon as someone wants to have too much power , millitary makes a coup d'\u00e9tat , takes control for several months , helds new elections and it 's back to business . 
  as many times as it happened , it 'd be kinda funny if it was n't so sad . 
  oh , ok , i see now , thank you . 
  so they 're basically avoiding combat , assuming situation in mali has quieted down since , while there 's a full blown war in iraq/syria . 
  now , i 'm horribly out of the loop and my french is rusty at best , so i 'm asking for clarification . 
  france is being attacked by mali , ~ ~ syria and iraq ~ ~ on french soil ? 
  qwertz ftw !, 
  how can there be 50 + % in slovenia , when there 's 50 + % of forest ? 
  oy , does n't finland have around 5 mil , and ireland about 4 mil , so that makes finland having a million or so more inhabitants than ireland . 
  looked up : 5.5 ( fi ) vs 4.6 ( ie ) apparently . 
  that 's in cities . 
  i 'd guess road markings are generally good in the cities as well and roads kept clean . 
  outside of cities you can find yourself without vehicles around you , are cars smart enough yet not to drive you off-road ? 
  especially if not marked , or better yet unpaved/snowed / ... serious question , i do n't really follow how far the technology is . 
  hmm . . interesting . 
  but no way to check what they 're offering without registering first ? 
  well , that 's too bad . 
  seriously ? 
  this ca n't be ... 
  someone get the guillotine !, 
  it can only do so much . 
  in my country they 've had a mad run with raising fines for breaking traffic laws , especially speeding iirc , a few years ago . 
  they raised fines , everyone was driving really nice and careful for a few weeks , then when they figured there 's no police on the roads to catch them , it went back to normal . 
  then they increased fines a year later again , etc. 
  all it did is got us some ridiculously high fines for some violations and ridiculously low fines for some other violations . 
  those are italian tanks ... 
  common place here . 
  at least in houses . 
  nevermind that , some say cyprus is western europe . 
  more like western asia , if you ask me ... 
  enjoy your sun !, 
  greeting from the fog-land . 
  can confirm , more snow in march than in december . 
  ( most snow is in february . ), 
  on piave ? 
  eh . . think so . 
  not sure how you magyars call people . 
  are n't there still some people declaring themselves as moravians ? 
  well , there are resians , but they 're in italy ( does that count ? ) . 
  they also do n't consider themselves slovenes as far as i know . 
  then there are [ prekmurci ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prekmurje_slovenes ) , which are definitely 100 % slovenes , except they speak some [ weird language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prekmurje_slovene ) that nobody understands . 
  officially a dialect of slovene , but it 's easier for me to understand russian , polish , czech or bulgarian than them . 
  well , i dunno , things all of a sudden moved very quickly when it came to frickin finally building sewer here . 
  heard some eu thing , otherwise we 'd still be waiting till err . . 30th february . 
  nah , there 's also me . 
  being the idiot , or rather ignorant , well both , that is . 
  no , no , definitely [ norway ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_norwegian_black_metal_scene ) . 
  pre\u0161ernova ulica ( [ pre\u0161eren ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/france_pre%c5%a1eren ) street ) 3 . 
  gregor\u010di\u010deva ulica ( [ gregor\u010di\u010d ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simon_gregor%c4%8di%c4%8d ) street ) 6 . 
  kajuhova ulica ( [ kajuh ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karel_destovnik ) street ) eh . . we like our poets , i guess . 
  here 's some more interesting ones : 12 . 
  firefighters street ; 23 . 
  new street ; 27 . 
  at the stream ; 30 . 
  freedom square ; 36 . 
  at the forest ; 37 . 
  old road ; 40 . & 41 . 
  sunny path/street ( combined would be 8th ) ; 50 . 
  under the castle source : http://www.stat.si/krajevnaimena/eng/pregledi_ulice_najpogostejse.asp, 
  exactly . 
  like informacija , organizacija , motivacija , etc. ? 
  we got that , too ( slovene ) , and i think some lithuanian words as well . 
  come to think of it , polish is probably unique in its - cja suffix . 
  any hints for telling danish and norwegian apart ? 
  because they literally look the same all the time to me . 
  if nothing else swedish got \u00e4 and \u00f6 instead of \u00e6 and \u00f8 , some other things , too . 
  but norwegian and danish ... impossibul . 
  south norway ? 
  or do you prefer west sweden ? 
  / r/retrofuturism, 
  what that ? 
  a hint ? 
  i would say the german accent is pretty obvious and heavy . 
  my 13th match is the first one outside europe . 
  ** yurop stronkest ** ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ first ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ four ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ from ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ germany . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ nem\u010dija ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ stop ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ cheating . 
  now that you mentioned it , i 've seen some pics from veluwe . 
  it does look like there could be an actual forest somewhere around there . 
  is actually antarctica ... 
  but it 's not like the english j , it 's like french j or english s in `` measure '' , `` treasure '' , etc. 
  a basic need to me , and that 's just my opinion not a fact , represents something in order for that being to survive . 
  so : food , water , etc. 
  but sexuality is n't one by that criteria . 
  of course it can be and is a great wish , urge , but not a physical need . 
  now , of course , you can argue my opinion is faulty . 
  but then , i 'd counter-argue about alcoholic 's basic need to consume alcohol or a kleptomaniac 's need to steal things .
