  how do we deal with those ? 
  ah , those are disorders , while sexuality is n't a disorder . 
  true , but that does n't change the fact that they ought to be stopped and can be without fatal consequences to them . 
  but i digress . 
  the point is , yes , people have lust , i 'm not saying women should deny their sexuality . 
  control it ? 
  yes , in same way men should , no differences . 
  what 's with all this people ** need to ** have sex , ca n't survive without , consequences be damned ( see the rise of stds ) . 
  that 's not directed at you personally , but at people ( women and men , before you accuse me of sexism ) at large . 
  i know people can easily survive without any kind of sexual intercourse , much easier still with thinking twice before doing it and preparing for all the `` unfortunate '' consequences . 
  and this is n't one of those , if i ca n't , no one else should . 
  it is one of those , wait till you grow up and you 're old enough , though . 
  btw ,  statisfying personal needs is more important than the possibility of maybe getting pregnant to me it seems , these days this is more like `` satisfying personal ego and pleasure is more important than killing an unborn child ( / baby/fetus/embryo ) is bad/horrible/immoral '' . 
   the person did not agree being a mother . 
  the person does not agree that it is her future child . 
  it is a non mutual relationship , the host was not asked , there was no direct choice ` you want this baby or not ' , the fetus benefits on the expenses of the host , without the hosts consent . 
  assuming the woman in question was raped , you are indeed correct . 
  on the other hand , pregnancy is a natural `` consequence '' of a sexual relationship ( that is its primary function biologically afterall ) . 
  and by consenting to having sex , you also consent that you might get pregnant even when using contraception . 
  so that 's when the host was asked . 
  but as i said , rapes do happen , unfortunately , and that 's the only case i see where/when it does n't happen with consent . 
   parasitism is a non mutual simbiotic relationship between two specirs , where one species benefits at the expense of the other . 
  two species . 
  mother and child are both human , not two species . 
  yes , and let 's not even talk about kanji . 
  looks like you really love your coal , polska . 
  do let go ? 
  it also does n't count , but let 's not forget [ this beauty . 
  ] ( http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/castle ), 
  you left out r/slovenia which is also multilingual ( well , bilingual actually : slovene and english ) , but i 'm too lazy to do the counting . 
  make illyrian provinces great again !, 
  that is if you imply ubuntu = unity ( de ) , there are other ubuntu flavours ( kubuntu , xubuntu , lubuntu , ubuntu mate , ... ) which look different . 
  it can be said that some look basically same as mint . 
  none of that weird , ugly , hard to navigate dock-like entity on the left side of the screen . 
  but pi = 3,14159265 ... without that 0 there !, 
  like the laibach/ljubljana - klagenfurt/celovec bus line ? 
  it 's literally written on bus board in front laibach - klagenfurt , then changes to ljubljana - celovec after few sec , then back again , etc. 
  ;p ( sorry for responding 2 weeks late and on a removed thread , just found pic on imgur , is all ), 
  that 's what they want you to think . 
  well , faroe islands are still part of denmark , so ... there 's your `` problem '' . 
  not an independant country -  no data . 
   what 's czechia 's excuse ? 
  soviet commies . 
   or belgium 's , for that matter ? 
  anything but epp and s&d , bah . . especially epp is too big imho . 
  i 'd most likely go for greens-efa ( if there 's a candidate ) . 
  yeah , no , apparently they do go there a lot , too . 
  my bad . 
  ~ ~ they did n't , read again . 
  they went to romanian coast of black sea , which is populated with turks ( well , turks are a minority there , but some live there , that was the point , i believe ) . ~ ~ guess this was n't what they were asking . 
  well , there are asterisks . 
  and it does n't say what they mean , anywhere . 
  bloody asterisks !, 
   which should rightfully have gone to ukraine !, 
  not that i 'm bitter or anything indeed , and it should have gone to serbia instead of ukraine in 2004 . 
  bad swap there . 
  well . 
  kinda . 
  maybe . 
  not sure . 
  i guess those would be feta , mozzarella , grana padano , parmigiano reggiano and emmentaler . 
  in no particular order . 
  but ireland ? 
  and sweden and finland ? 
  there 's still that gl\u00f8ri\u00f6us \u00d8\u0308resundsbron . 
  no , [ they really hate it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-cyrillic_protests_in_croatia ) . 
  brain drain has been relatively low in the past couple of decades , but it is steadily increasing lately . 
  but well , that 's slovenia , ca n't speak for czech rep. , slovakia or estonia for example . 
   i 'd go with `` city of london with less rain '' except it has more rain . 
  896.9 mm/year ( luxembourg ) vs 601.7 mm/year ( london ) , also 182.3 rainy days/year ( luxembourg ) vs 109.5 rainy days/year ( london ) . 
  tbh , london is actually not that rainy at all . 
   like this one , it was passed by the parlament but than the church organized a referendum . 
  prav bi bilo '' ... but then the church ... '' . 
  sorry , ca n't really elaborate . 
  unless i was to sayata it soundeda like you need to add - ta at endata every wordata . 
  but that 'd just be rude . 
   how macedonian sounds to you ? 
  like bulgarian , except some words are actually understandable , because they sound serbian . 
  does that make any sense ? 
  unfortunately . 
  :( but then again , they 've all just wanted to annex us , all the time . 
  austrians are germanized slavs , definitely . 
  well , with plenty bavarians mixed in , i 'm sure . 
   slovenia ( okay i 'm not sure how they actually feel about the illyrian provinces and all ) neutral to positive , depends who you ask , i guess . 
  they 've been painted in a good light , mostly because of allowing slovene language in education and generally giving it greater importance . 
  however , it 's pretty much ignored these days that common folks back then did n't like it at all and were very much against french . 
  and well , there 's this : http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/projects/archive_200th_anniversary_of_the_illyrian_provinces/, 
  that 'd be sweden , denmark and norway . 
  23/28 i do n't know them kings and queens . . or prime ministers either . 
  and tulips - that was evul , but okay . 
   i did n't check if any of these were false friends . 
  a few that i 've noticed . 
  `` negdje '' means somewhere , nowhere would be `` nigdje '' . 
  and `` stavi '' means put ( staviti -  postaviti -  postawi\u0107 ) . 
  `` oproste '' would be to forgive ( unless i screwed up here something as well ) and `` drugog '' in this case would mean someone else , though it can also mean second . 
  okay , good to know . 
  bavaria is closest so i tend to generalize too much . 
  or is there some huge wine thing going on there as well ? 
  but bevanda is with non-sparkling water . 
  \u0160pricer here .
