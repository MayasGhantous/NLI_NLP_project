  there probably is wine production there as well , but smaller . 
  beer is dominating . 
  it could be somewhat climate related as well . 
  france has oceanic climate , while further east it gets more continental ( meaning colder , possibly longer winters ) . 
  slovenia is relatively more south , and `` on the sunny side of the alps '' , also bordering the adriatic sea . 
  but i 've no idea about wine making or grapes , so i 'm not going to assume anything , just guessing . 
  plenty of our own wine . 
  and it 's good , too , we just drink it all ourselves , so we ca n't export any , you see . 
  they 're making wine farther north than slovenia , champagne region in france being the best example . 
  though , vineyards are placed on slopes so as to catch as much sun as possible . 
  iirc we were placed in the wine belt . 
  wiki agrees with me https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alcohol_belts_of_europe#/media/file:europe_alcohol_belts.png, 
  well depends how they got the data . 
  if it was polls , that 's counted , if market sales , then you 're right . 
  looks kinda high , though . 
  do n't forget all the schnapps people make at home ... and beer and ... 
  hold on , that 's 1,2 dl per person per day . 
  children and adults combined . 
  assuming 15 % of population is underage , no wait , 14 + are drinking anyway , but then again , not so often , and probably not wine too much ... anyway , 85 % of population means . . 1,4 dl per adult per day . 
  some drunkards we are . 
  but then , a third of it is probably cvi\u010dek , which does n't really count as wine , so it 's all good , amirite ? 
  edit : i accidentally a decimal ...

  `` kaiserlich und k\u00f6niglich '' it refers to the kingdoms and lands represented in the imperial council and the lands of the holy hungarian crown of st. stephen ( aka austria-hungary ) . 
  i ermm . . well , err . . you see . . it 's like moving to the other part of the same country that feels foreign , except they still speak the same language . 
  mostly . 
  so , i guess that part of country right across the border you 're closest to . 
  < / obvious need to exaggerate  southern austria and north-western croatia , cause history . 
  that 'd be mostly . 
  though , even moravia and bratislava did n't feel too far off , other than language . 
  bohemia and vienna much more so ( far off , that is ) . 
  btw , neighbours , why are [ these croats `` singing '' in slovene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc2u5ed3cj4nsihrgtb9ev8w ) ? 
  umm . . belarus . . colour , number . 
  something does n't match . 
  johnny ? 
  it 's [ eurovision we 're talking about ( 0:59 ) . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohbs4vasezs ), 
  r/danmag is that way, 
  [ maxxess ] ( http://maxxess.de/wp/media/ ) german one-man-band , electronic influenced instrumental rock , pretty long samples on website upon clicking an album ( landscapes is no good :p ) . 
  well , ok , yes . 
  kinda small compared to the rest of turkey , though . 
  answer with this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wzuz1llfxi, 
  because asia minor . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ng-ktu1xkk ) no , not saying you 're guilty of it . 
  but the air does smell of butter , right ? 
  like it was n't difficult enough already . 
  awful language !, 
  easily the worst language invention to date . 
  do you have them in magyar ? 
  did i really miss an article ? 
  * hangs head in shame . 
  well , yes , that 's the point . 
   so what 's the serbian word for keyboard ? 
   czech republic ? 
  where is that ? 
  ( a true honest reaction from several bavarians ... ) no , wait , what , no . 
  no way . 
  i refuse to believe that . 
  oh , you guys can sing like your northern brothers , too . 
  not just play basketball . 
  but , have you any cool great songs ( like dziesma , ar ko tu s\u0101cies or saule , p\u0113rkons , daugava ) ? 
  those are , in fact , two separate languages : crnski and gorski . 
  no montenegrin language . 
  get your facts straight !, 
  foreigner here : swedish and norwegian sound almost the same , danish sounds completely different ; norwegian and danish text looks completely the same , swedish i can tell apart . 
  serbo-croatian is too close ~ ~ for ~ ~ to me to judge . 
  though there are some obviously different words in serbian vs. croatian , i just ca n't possibly take bosnian seriously as a language . 
  care to elaborate and/or link ? 
  would like to read that . 
  duck = ga-ga, 
  yeah , no . 
  estonia and czechia are far from religious , on the other hand romania is relatively very religious . 
  any speaker of a slavic language can understand a large part of slovio . 
  esperanto is totally obscure for people who do n't speak a romance language and/or english . 
  ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ doing ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ right ? 
  and all i see is finns and dutch fighting over who does better in various international stats ... 
  and let 's not forget the worst one : `` once and a while '' . 
  i 've yet to figure out how anyone can make that mistake . 
  title clearly states sex ratio , not gender ratio . 
  you could know there are 2 sexes , it 's not the same as gender . 
  get your facts straight . 
  exactly , none of that . 
  a significant part of map is light grey ( poland ) ( much more than brits or china ) , yet you skipped them as if they do n't exist or lumped them together with `` people dedicated to a culture ... '' if i am to understand your comment right . 
  to add , hungarian and finnish do n't really share any vocabulary . 
  finnish and estonian look quite similar , but i do n't speak either of the two , so i ca n't say how similar they really are . 
  not sure what 's your problem with danish , it sounds basically same as dutch . 
  oh , so maybe that 's exactly why you have a problem with it !, 
  erm . . but , slovene and croatian are fairly different . 
  i mean sure , there are some words that are same , but ... nothing like croatian and serbian where you really got ta look for the differences with a magnifying glass . 
   they were in yugoslavia for almost 50 years actually more than 70 years , since ww1 till 1991 . 
  well , most of the country was , a large part was occupied by italy between ww1 and ww2 , though . 
   half of country lives in capital actually , we all live in villages ... only like one eighth of people live in the capital . 
  i guess you could call us ... the ... erm . . village ? 
  people ? 
  i 'll go now . 
  that 's a weird definition of `` the only '' you got there . 
  according to your first source , there 's also bosnia and herzegovina , macedonia , albania and possibly kazakhstan , armenia and azerbaijan , whether you count them in europe or not . 
  your second source says , there 's also poland , slovenia , macedonia , russia , estonia , moldova ... weird how much the sources differ , though . 
  like estonia having +0.46 % in one and -0.64 % in the other . 
  granted they 're for a different year ( s ) , but still seems like a big difference .
