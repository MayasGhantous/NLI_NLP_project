  they can live legally as foreigners , ie . 
  having an other citizenship . 
  i dunno , pretty sure most , if not all , of you know you border yugoslavia to the east , right ? 
  gib back trst and gorica !, 
  [ certainly .

  anyway , at this rate , seychelles ~ ~ will beat you in 2 years time ~ ~ is already ahead and gabon ~ ~ in 3 ~ ~ will be this year . 
  does n't matter , we got trst !, 
  rumour has it you already did lose it . 
  to , believe it or not ... * drumroll * ... namibia . 
   i do n't even know who to believe anymore . 
  if americans , russians , chinese and arabs all agree on something , then it 's probably true . 
  otherwise i would n't believe anyone . 
  you mean spoiled apple juice ? 
  oh , i thought you guys only drink coffee ... 
   dutch  music  top `` toeter toeter toeter toeter toeter met romana op de scooter ... '' ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry, 
  did n't see that about wiki , thanks . 
  anyway , montenegro joined with serbia . 
  joined/annexed , isto sranje , drugo pakovanje , austria also joined with germany . 
  :p i meant , they do n't need to downvote you . 
  i do n't know about historians . 
  in school they were too busy talking about slovenia , so they just glossed over montenegro ... basically , from what i remember , it was : state of slovenes , croats and serbs was n't internationally recognized , so [ ... ] it joined with the kingdom of serbia , which has before that already [ joined/merged/annexed / unclear ] with kingdom of montenegro , to form kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenes . 
  so , just that montenegro was part of serbia then , nothing more , nothing less , nothing how it came about that . 
  interestingly , though , wikipedia mentions this  on 28 november 1918 , following the end of world war i , with its government still in exile , montenegro was occupied by its former ally kingdom of serbia and illegally annexed by it , only to be merged into the kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenes three days later , on 1 december 1918 . 
  otoh , it also mentions this  nicholas i had staunchly supported unification with serbia to form a great serbian state for all serbs , but had disputed with the kings of serbia as to who would rule the new kingdom . 
  also : people , no need to downvote this markole person . 
  ahem , 1918 ? 
  so do greeks and turks ... 
  no , there 's nothing like that in slovenian . 
  maybe there was hundreds of years ago , but i 've never encountered it in any text . 
  russian is similar if i remember right from those very few lessons i took . 
  some russian speaker please correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  22nd june 1593 best day of my life . 
  when did the dutch conquer all of the ijsselmeer from the sea ? 
  yes , the united kingdom . 
  that 's the colour the faroes have . 
  this is ludicrous !, 
  absolutely unacceptable !, 
  ottomans never spread that far to the north-west !, 
  east of rhine is europe , west of rhine is north america . 
  well if it 's culture that matters , then we should surely be in central or maybe in south . 
  slovenia has nothing in common with estonia , lithuania , albania or romania . 
  a bit with serbia and slovakia sure , but a lot with austria , czechia , croatia , southern germany , northern italy . 
  mostly austria and croatia , i 'd say . 
  we 're east , but none of our neighbours is east ? 
  wot ? 
  i think this one makes the most sense yet . 
  they have this huge choir singing events with beautiful songs . 
  according to people the same , since everyone is on the minimum wage , except `` the elite '' . 
  indeed , our gini is very low . 
  anyway , the stats : january 2017 : 1.592,15 eur gross , 1.039,12 eur netto ( that 's a monthly average wage ) february 2017 : 1.581,37 eur gross and 1.034,20 eur nett .

  i see , thank you !, 
  how does `` sextam '' connect with `` twelve '' ? 
  \u0159ek ? 
  if we limit it just to capitals , ljubljana is actually second ( behind podgorica , and barely ahead of tirana ) . 
  there are other cities elsewhere in europe with much more rain , though . 
  london is among the driest european capitals , actually . 
  not sure where the stereotype comes from . 
  i thought rainy days maybe , i 've yet to check for more places , but ljubljana even has more rainy days than london ( 153 vs 110 ) , if wikipedia is to be believed . 
  ah , no , it counts as rainy day if more than 1.0 mm fell in london , but 0.1 mm in ljubljana . 
  so that should definitely skew the data . 
  for comparison , rome has 79 rainy days ( more than 1.0 mm ) . 
  i do n't have much to say that has n't been said yet , so i 'll just [ leave this here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcensojnmf0 ) . 
  ah , i see it now , sorry . 
  i was sure you wrote soro\u0161 twice , now i see it 's only once , yes . 
  i see people writing the same here , as well . 
  might be a connection . 
  written soros , pronounced / \u0161oro\u0161 / . 
  might i suggest samo 's empire ? 
  interesting , thank you . 
  to\u010dno , mali traven je april , mali traven je maj.  and you have/had that in croatian as well ? 
  i 've searched a little , and found some references about these names in 17th century . 
  and then ` traven ' -  ` travanj ' somehow happened ? 
  if you have some more info about that , please share . 
  i gave up ... my jokes are shit . 
  filthy land thieves since , oh about 1000 ad . 
  but i guess bavarians are to blame for that , mostly . 
  so they 're basically just germanized slovenes , mixed with bavarians . 
  also arrogant . 
  but very beautiful place . 
  they did come up with some cool food , as well . 
  back in the day . 
  now they 're just killing it in endless grease . 
  slovenia can into nordic ? 
  [ obligatory ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsdn0sagnuy ), 
  2nd switzerland !, 
  hello southern sweden !, 
  north-eastern denmark , you say ? 
  i 'd say finnish . . they do n't even seem european to me sometimes ( no offense ) . 
   celje and la\u0161ko area ( styria ) that speak the closest to standardized slovene . 
  they 're delusional . 
  from my experience , the only people actually speaking standard slovene are from prekmurje , because it 's pretty much second language for them . 
  that is , when they speak slovene and not prekmurian ( ? ) . 
  anyway , yes , it 's based on lower carniolan with upper carniolan influences ( especially those in and around ljubljana ) . 
  merci , 
  so you do n't have that 12h to 14h pause i 've been told you do ( and later told it 's kind of dying , ie . 
  employers giving less/no time off ) ? 
  cash-free ?
