  what is this , fascism ? 
  no , thanks . 
  credit cards here are far from common , the last time i checked anyway . 
  debit cards pretty common . 
  got card only to withdraw cash and to buy stuff online . 
  or maybe i used it once or twice otherwise . 
  that 'd probably be switzerland . 
  something around 200 km - 300 km range would be nice . 
  and/or frequent charging stations ( they seem to be rather rare in this part ) . 
  also , it 'd help if charging time is n't more than an hour . 
  you only recharge every so often , take break for lunch then if you 're on the way . 
  marseille is second , lyon third . 
  think toulouse is fourth . 
  not sure where bordeaux ranks , shoud be top10 , though , i believe . 
  edit : wiki says bordeaux is 9th ( city limits ) or 7th ( urban area ) . 
  i really like it personally . 
  well , some of it , i want actual music , not over-commercialized stuff , so i 'm picky . 
  and bluegrass mostly . 
  either way , it 's not popular here at all . 
  yeah , we got our local folk , folk-pop etc. 
  music , but not american country . 
  trst is in asia now . 
  been all over the ~ ~ news ~ ~ tabloids several years ago when he maried some woman from here . 
  i hear he 's a president candidate now ? 
  well , whatever , i really do n't care about him , nor do i really follow news lately . 
  this basically . 
  malta perhaps ? 
  i do n't know much about it , but it might fit and i see no one mentioned it yet . 
  levant is in asia . 
  same as why i 'd never consider israel or turkey as part of europe , for example . 
  everyone knows america is controlled by jews . 
  just got ta include muslims in somehow . 
  as far as i know it 's `` no '' to all 4 . 
  i do n't have any source , though . 
  i even hope i 'm wrong , though it would surprise me . 
  anatolia aka asia minor is in asia , therefor asian . 
  hide in the forests and mountains , and try some type of guerrilla warfare . 
  worked so far , pretty much , kinda . 
  i 'd rather we discontinued . 
  and stick to winter/solar time , not having constant dst , blah . 
  want more sun in the evening ? 
  wake up earlier !, 
  do n't know what 's with this trend of workshift moving to later and later times . 
  20 years and 12-20 will be the norm , lol . 
  of course there 's no evening left then . 
  it does n't mean anything , other than actually being dutch/from the netherlands . 
  not that i know , anyway . 
  they `` are different . 
  people are always afraid of what 's different . '', 
  along slovenian short coast there are the northernmost salt pans in mediterranean . 
  they 're open to visit , presenting the old ways of getting salt , which are still being maintained and there 's a specific flora and fauna as at every salt pans . 
  http://www.kpss.si/en/intro the old , little town of [ piran ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piran ) might be interesting for a short visit , but then again , you 're visiting dubrovnik , so dunno . 
  check online and decide for yourself , i guess . 
  also , highest cliff on adriatic : strunjan cliff . 
  then there 's this nice [ amphitheatre in pula ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pula_arena ) . 
  and quite likely plenty of other stuff down the coast that i 'm not familiar with . 
  if you fancy underground world ( caves ) , there 's plenty in the area , i 'd point out the great unesco-heritage-with-a-canyon \u0160kocjan caves , a tourist-trap-with-train-in-cave postojna cave and my favourite expensive-and-remote - ( and takes lots of time to get it done properly ) kri\u017ena jama . 
  you 've probably seen this [ predjama castle ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/panorama_del_castello_di_predjama_%28foto_luca_giarelli%29.jpg ) before , though ( on pics ) ? 
  ljubljana itself can be done in about 2-3 hours if you rush things . 
  2 nights might be a lot , it 's a small city ( if you 're doing only cities ) . 
  on the other hand , if you wanted to check out more of the country ( which is cooler imho ) , then 2 nights seems fine . 
  ca n't compare vienna or prague to ljubljana in the amount of things to see or places to visit . 
  i really liked tel\u010d for some reason . 
  not that there 's much happening there , just fancy main square and a little park behind the town . 
  a cool place to just chill and relax for a few hours . 
  all three are bound to join . 
  now , when will that happen , i 've no clue . 
  i 'd just like to add that both ireland and uk are outside the schengen area . 
  no clue , sorry ; but the guys over at / r/iwantout or even / r/americansineurope might have better knowledge . 
  j\u00e4ger is brown . 
  ca n't tell , really . 
  spring 2014 was really warm and nice , but summer was non-stop rain . 
  spring 2013 on the other hand was very rainy and blah . 
  generally march should be ok for ljubljana . 
  higher up ( higher above sea level ) , there can be snow , especially early march . 
  can also be reasonably warm already , though . 
  nothing severe , snow-wise , mind you ; just annoying because it makes everything wet and muddy . 
  depends where you go hiking , expect winter in mountains ( above 1500 m or so ) . 
  i make it sound like it 's all bad , it 's not . 
  just ca n't help but feel sky is grey year-round and the fact that we 've had a ton of rain recently . 
  so , yeah , still winter in mountains , but ljubljana and bled are perfectly fine . 
  march can be reasonably dry month , and the smell of spring in the air and all that . 
  maybe not exactly what you have in mind , but i have in nice memory a part of road somewhere between genoa and nice or could be even farther from nice towards west , but i think most of what i have in mind was in italy . 
  only been there by bus , though . 
  i just remember nice view and numerous short tunnels . 
  hope you 're not expecting any snow . 
  that time of year it 's usually grey , foggy , likely rainy , melancholic . 
  but then it 's december and full of nice lights , etc. 
  so that 's something . 
  ( well , there is snow in the mountains . ), 
  i would n't recommend relying on public transport . 
  especially trains are old and slow , also do n't reach many places . 
  buses can be better , but you 're definitely better off renting a car , though you 're in trouble of finding/paying a parking spot . 
  i 'd recommend you a bohinj lake area , but that 's perhaps better for summer . 
  never been there in winter . 
  our food not my kind of food . 
  except [ potica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nut_roll ) ( well , that article is badly written , to be honest ; but the bottom picture - breakfast - is very real and very proper , except i only see two slices of proper potica ) , which must be walnut ( and walnut only ) and may include raisins ( it 's better with them imho ) . 
  now the other thing is n't really slovenian as much as it is prekmurian . 
  the great [ prekmurska gibanica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prekmurska_gibanica ) . 
  nothing to add , it 's just perfectly amazing if done right .
