  i feel ya man , same thing happened with our stricter internet rules ... 
  '' ... lovely nature on the north ... '' ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) no but really , croatian coast is divine !, 
  sadly , i 'm not that familiar with the inland :(, 
  actually he could n't , law stipulated that not mentioning one of the children in the will makes the will void . 
  also if he gave one of them too small of an inheritance , law stipulated that it had to be topped up to the legal minimum . 
  he could only disown his son under certain circumstances , which had to be mentioned in the will ( badmouthing the father for example ) . 
  he could n't just arbitrarily decide to leave everything to one sibling . 
  if he did , the will would be void and the children ( presuming he had them ) would inherit by law ( therefore equally between them ) . 
  slovenia can into western/central europe ? 
  well actually yes and no . 
  i can * relatively * understand croatian , but am really bad at talking . 
  so i 'm not really great to chat with in croatia . 
  and that 's with 20 + years of vacationing on your coast . 
  but yes , the older generations speak croatian fluently because it was taught in schools during yugoslavia . 
  not anymore though , and it shows . 
  for what it counts , i really like your username !, 
  but yeah , lili :d, 
  this might sound strange , but for some reason whenever i stumbled upon your posts , i always read them in a female voice . 
  til . 
  at home ? 
  nah , i 've only ever seen french fries as a side dish if kids are involved . 
  mashed/baked potatoes are much more common . 
  i really like ours , now i 'm curious how your tastes like !, 
  it 's not that much of a stereotype as a lot of people hold this view . 
  including me ( to some extent ) . 
  heresy , la\u0161ko is the one true beer . 
  bend the knee or be destroyed !, 
  do you live close to the border of slovenia ? 
  because you also have the local jamnica for sparkling water , never thought radenska was widespread in croatia . 
  koline * :d, 
  well that 's like every caf\u00e9 here , did n't know there was a difference . 
  what 's a pavement caf\u00e9 ? 
  every student takes advantage of it daily , it 's really one of the best things about being a student . 
  and it is dirt cheap as the full price is 3x the student cost . 
  or you can eat a sandwich for 2 $ . 
  yeah , you 're gon na pay 4 $ for a warm and delicious student restaurant meal . 
  stop talking about stuff you know clearly nothing about . 
  how is this relevant to my post ? 
  honestly , i 'd enroll just for the subsidised restaurant food . 
  paying 4 $ for a three course menu at an upscale asian fusion restaurant is just heaven on earth . 
  i ate there around 70 times in my first year of college . 
  can relate . 
  i 'm from the capital and i rarely see them . 
  almost never . 
  computes perfectly !, 
  it 's a cold war label , before that it was more nuanced . 
  in school they mention the east-west divide , but we we are taught to divide europe into the following regions : * north * west * central * eastern * south * south-eastern [ this was probably what we were taught in school ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/grossgliederung_europas-en.svg ) ( except we probably lumped croatia with se europe , sorry neighbours ! ), 
  also , orthodoxy is n't really present in a lot of countries perceived as eastern . 
   it 's about history funny you mention this , the czechs , slovaks , hungarians , poles and us slovenes ( and a sprinkle of croatia ) are ** all ** historically part of central europe . 
  such a thing as germany being a western european country would n't float 100 years ago . 
  it was central , as was a-o . 
  the world was a different place , so please do n't whitewash history . 
  but as it stands today , you 're mostly right . 
  things have changed in the last century . 
  oops , did n't see your question here . 
  it 's the consumer rights directive . 
  see my post in the general thread . 
  as from june 13th 2014 , the new consumer rights directive is in force . 
  i 've copypasted the section which may interest you :  if a contract is cancelled by the consumer for any reason , a full refund shall be made within 14 days , ** including costs of delivery ** . 
  to simplify for consumers , a special voluntary form for cancellations has been developed . 
  more here : http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/consumer_rights/consumer_rights_directive/index_en.htm hope that helps !, 
  fittingly german :d also , obligatory \u017di\u017eek : https://youtu.be/ge4sxlgiaga, 
  never heard of that one before . 
  is that an austrian saying ? 
  phew , that was a close one !, 
  and you 're completely right , although most of the people just do n't like the upper \u0160tajerska dialects , from maribor and around . 
  at least that 's what 's usually voiced . 
  on the notranjska dialect i do n't really have an opinion , it 's okay i guess . 
  do n't have a reason to not like it . 
  i 'm from ljubljana by the way . 
  i on the other hand ca n't stand them . 
  the celje region accent is a lot more pleasing to my ears . 
  can confirm . 
  between my finger and my thumb , the squat pen rests . 
  recited the shit out of that one in school . 
  i 've talked to a portuguese student on erasmus here in ljubljana once , and he was shocked at how clean the city is in comparison to lisbon . 
  never been there , so i ca n't really compare . 
  dear god !, 
  i only know one person here who is lactose intolerant . 
  he would fit nicely here . 
  my man . 
  let me guess , he 's waloonian ? 
  i honestly ca n't , i see a bigger difference between our dialects , some of which are almost unintelligible to me ( looking at you ne slovenia ) . 
  though it has to be said that i 'm not really great at the languages of our southern neighbours , so i 'm probably biased by my not knowledge . 
  damn , those 0.25 l glasses of beer are straight up evil . 
  we call them ` the italian ' here . 
  ca n't abide them , 0.5 l is the golden ratio of beer glasses . 
  so say we all !, 
  i am truly befuddled , what is this ` balkan ' of which you speak of ? 
  and why did you include us slovenians of mitteleuropa in it ? 
  or bust !, 
  we also call them `` strojan\u010dki '' , which is a dimunitive form of the surname of one of our more infamous roma families . 
  it 's based on the stereotype that gypsies steal stuff made from copper . 
  grey blue eyes with a yellow rim around the pupil , light brown hair ( or dark blonde , who knows ? 
  ) , skin complexion of someone nestled between the alps and the mediterranean . 
  to expand on that , subsidised meals for students are available also at normal restaurants . 
  just today i ate lunch at a thai fusion restaurant in the city centre and i paid 4,37 $ for soup , cold starter , main course , salad and fruit . 
  as a regular customer , i 'd pay around 10 $ just for the main course . 
  so it 's a bargain really !, 
  us included .
