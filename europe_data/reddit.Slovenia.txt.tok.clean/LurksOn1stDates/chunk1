it includes all the typical slovenian topics - yugo-nostalgia , identity crisis and suicides . 
   do n't your heads of political parties usually stand down if they lose an important election referendum ? 
  political functions are considered a god-given right , they only stand down if the coalition becomes too dysfunctional to pass any kind of bill or if the party pressure is too severe after an embarassment in the elections . 
  the largest opposition party has had the same president for over 20 years despite winning only 1 out of 6 elections . 
  he 's currently part-time prisoner/part-time mp . 
  this concept of responsibility connected to political culture is foreign to me . 
  here , even a prison sentence is not enough to keep them out of the parliament . 
  still , salmond 's done a lot for scotland 's negotiating position towards british government . 
  more devolution of powers is inevitable and according to the [ opinion polls ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_scottish_independence_referendum,_2014 ) , just two years ago nobody would even have thought independence was a realistic plan . 
  most people in slovenia jokingly agree the best thing bratusek 's done for the country is give birth to a son who just signed for southampton fc youth academy . 
  so there 's her vote of support for the commisioner post . 
   apparently pastries is very sensitive in slovenia ( and i suspect now that this is actually what caused the war ) , because my slovene girlfriend got very upset about the list . 
    medimurska gibanica is actually prekmurska gibanica . 
  and the nut roll op called povitica is actually called ptica , povitica is the croatian spelling if i 'm not mistaken . 
  this is true , op 's lucky slovenians do n't frequent reddit that much or else he 'd make some enemies for life . 
  we actually trademarked it [ under this eu scheme ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geographical_indications_and_traditional_specialities_in_the_european_union ) . 
  sidenote : it 's p ** o ** tica , not ptica , which means a bird .

  their conservative doppelgangers are doing [ the same ] ( https://twitter.com/milanzver/status/464676740603056128/photo/1 ) , but with younger people . 
  because memes and other social network phenomena are an easier way of baiting the voters than having an actual programme and not being wankers in general . 
  my opinion as someone who got bombarded with news about this trial for the past 5 or 6 years : he and his fellow co-defendants kept saying there is no proof and at the same time , they asked for certain pieces of evidence to be excluded from the trial , which hardly makes sense . 
  i think he 's guilty ( and probably of plenty other , even worse things from the independence era ) , but a prominent former constitutional judge said the conviction is n't strong enough , so this charade wo n't be over until they take it to european courts . 
  anyone that focuses on those 10 minutes of very graphic sexual scenes is probably missing the point of the movie . 
  or has n't really watched it . 
  there was a smaller group of slightly older tourists from us who tried to upset the natural order of things by asking for directions on a bus in ljubljana . 
  the horror on regulars ' faces when they noticed a stranger trying to communicate with them , let alone in a foreign language , made being on that bus so awkward i forced myself to do the unthinkable and actually help them since i left at the same bus stop . 
  they turned out to be very nice and talkative and curious about everything . 
  i did n't know such people existed before . 
  i really liked your [ being bold in zadar , croatia ] ( http://www.giveliveexplore.com/2012/10/19/being-bold-in-zadar-croatia/ ) video where you talk to people . 
  do you have anymore videos like that ? 
   in german there is a similar phrase : `` das kommt mir spanisch vor - it seems spanish to me . '', 
  which is said to come from times when the habsburg kings ruled over both austria and spain and imported a lot of spanish court ceremonial , which appeared strange to locals . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.omeidl.com/greek.html ) another one : slovene : * lahko je s tujim kurcem po koprivah mlatit * literally : it 's easy to wave around nettles with someone else 's dick meaning : to be careless and self-assured about something when you bear no responsibility,

  someone asked if your roster held team workouts or individual workouts before the tournament .

  indexes do n't have units . 
  i wanted to , but i could n't find any good median wage data anywhere . 
  if anyone finds it , that 'd be great . 
  ** data used : ** * [ comparative price levels for food , beverages and tobacco ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/comparative_price_levels_for_food,_beverages_and_tobacco ) * [ list of countries in europe by monthly average wage ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_in_europe_by_monthly_average_wage ) ** how it 's calculated : ** since price levels were indexed , the same had to be done with average monthly wages . 
  then the price index was divided by the wage index . 
  ** examples : ** the price of alcoholic beverages relative to the average monthly wage in norway ( 85 ) is 15 % below the eu27 average ( 100 ) . 
  the price of tobacco products relative to the average monthly wage in ireland ( 129 ) is 29 % above the eu27 average ( 100 ) .

  [ there once was a land of hardworking people ] ( http://underhillfest.me/en/there-once-was-the-land-of-hard-working-people/ )  from 1977 to 1991 an image of slovenia as a green , demilitarized and peaceful country of diligent people reigned in yugoslavia , a country where differences are not only allowed , but also desired . 
  this period ends with a ten-day war , when the identity turns from peacefulness , modesty and diligence into courage and a fighting spirit . 
  the film documents the changes in slovenia and its inhabitants , which have in recent years brought us to a completely different understanding of national identity , different from the one which was true in slovenia as well as abroad twenty years ago . 
  i ca n't even link you to a trailer with english subtitles . 
  i 'm not sure who they 're making these documentaries for when you ca n't get them anywhere . 
  you can watch this short movie , though .

  they once got into a fight with common sense and won . 
  they had to buy salt from a far away place and they got sick of it so they decided to start sowing it . 
  this one fits the national character the most . 
  all of these stories are more entertaining than my summary . 
  too bad there 's no english translation of them . 
  we 're too busy sowing salt . 
  i predict this thread makes it into the news on one of the slovenian media websites . 
  we love attention . 
  everyone should watch this . 
  it 's like an unscripted borat movie . 
  the problem is that they keep inviting people who come from lower social classes with a completely different set of cultural values and expecting them to just turn the switch on and adapt . 
  that kind of logic has no chance of success regardless of the immigrants ' ethnicity .
