   there are , however , exceptions for individuals with `` less need for integration , '' such as those with university education , approved refugees , eu citizens or the spouses of those from countries that have a visa-free travel agreement with germany . 
  this just seems like such a poorly thought-out concept to me . 
  if your goal is to live in a foreign country , you need to learn their language regardless of your background . 
  you ca n't expect to integrate if you ca n't communicate with natives in their mother tongue . 
  the eu as a whole needs to re-think its immigration/integration strategy . 
  there 's a typical slovenian saying : let the neighbour 's cow drop dead if we do n't have one ourselves . 
  may he be as graceful and dignified as his parents . 
  i think finally implementing a common fiscal and monetary policy would be just enough . 
  there 's no need to unify education systems and such as long as there are some international standards already . 
  austria actually has one of the best labour market legislations in europe , it also explains their incredibly low unemployment rates . 
  this sounds like heaven for all the pharmacists struggling to decypher the doctor 's writing . 
  they love us very much , especially in the summer when we occupy their coastline . 
  cartoon network . 
  there once was a time when they had quality cartoons . 
  i chose ** education and cultural heritage ** , ** job opportunities ** and ** transport and infrastructure ** . 
  i feel that if we 're better connected and have a better chance of social and economic safety , all of the other areas will gain higher eu wide support in the future . 
  we have n't protected it with the eu yet ? 
  be right back ... 
   the brain drain in spain stays mainly in the plain ? 
  i 'll show myself out . 
  us is a bigger , more homogeneous market . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federation#confederation ) : by definition , the difference between a confederation and a federation is that the membership of the member states in a confederation is voluntary , while the membership in a federation is not . 
  a confederation is most likely to feature these differences over a federation : 1 . 
  no real direct powers : many confederal decisions are externalised by member-state legislation . 
  decisions on day-to-day-matters are not taken by simple majority but by special majorities or even by consensus or unanimity ( veto for every member ) . 
  changes of the constitution , usually a treaty , require unanimity . 
  looking at one of the bigger news sites , there are aproximately 10 news reports/articles per day in the category of national politics . 
  in the category of eu , there are 7 news reports/articles in the whole month of june . 
  but the more worrying part are the comments . 
  people calling for the dissolution of euro and going back to our old currency , comparing the eu to yugoslavia , etc. 
  are constantly getting positive feedback . 
  some more info from a [ shanghai news site ] ( http://www.shanghaidaily.com/article/article_xinhua.asp?id=145719 ) ( sorry , only english link i could find ) :  ljubljana , june 5 ( xinhua ) -- former slovenian prime minister janez jansa was found guilty on wednesday of receiving bribes in a 2006 deal with finnish defence manufacturer patria . 
    jansa , 54 , was on charges of giving or receiving bribes for unlawful mediation during the selection and purchase of 135 armored personnel carriers by the government from finland 's patria . 
    while jansa was sentenced to two-year imprisonment , two other co-defendants , ivan crnkovic , director of slovenian bearing giant rotis , and brigadier general anton krkovic , also got 22-month sentences for each for their role in receiving bribes to secure the 278 million-euro ( 364 million u.s. dollars ) contract on eight-wheeled armored personnel carriers with finish company patria . 
    the court also demands that each be fined 37,000 euros . 
  it 's quite hilarious , there 's a couple hundred or so old people cheering for him and protesting outside the court like they 're in north korea . 
  slovenia would be the drunken guy sticking his finger in the socket until someone tells him to stop . 
  then it 'd stick the finger a couple more times . 
  i eat the generic supermarket brand of corn flakes / m\u00fcsli . 
  i 'm tough like that . 
  i get goose bumps everytime i see someone wearing a gas mask like [ the soldier in picture 28 ] ( http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/infocus/fin052313/f28_00114350.jpg ) . 
  so terrifying . 
  yes , leave your money here . 
  more free publicity . 
  should 've slowly started selling state-owned enterprises the day we joined eu . 
  i understand selling the airline company , but how do you sell the only relevant airport ? 
  is this a common practice in western/northern eu countries ? 
  took the data for european countries out of the research and posting it here ( no copyright infringement intended ) : * [ table 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/w9wrbdy.png ) * [ table 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/e2w1zyc.png ) * [ table 3 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m7uaetd.png ) * [ table 4 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kouqlyq.png ) [ here 's ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/ernst-and-young-fraud-survey-2013-5 ) an article about the survey . 
  because people do n't have the necessary critical attitude towards politics when things are going well ? 
  when there 's gdp growth and there 's plenty of everything , people wo n't complain . 
  that 's not a slovenian thing , that 's a human thing . 
  it also does n't help when two political fractions avert all the political discussion into ideological conflicts instead of economic and social issues . 
  to add to this : former eastern bloc countries had a more sudden transition . 
  slovenia went through with a more gradual one and it was working . 
  the problem is that after the eu accession , we were halfway through with the transition , but the politicians stopped because the system they tailored for themselves was good enough for them . 
  then the global financial crisis began and all hell broke loose . 
  if data is taken from european values study , they could 've at least used the full questions , too . 
  it took me way too long to figure out what i 'm doing . 
  i got sweden , though . 
  one day ... 
  we have one similar subculture with two groups : 1 . 
  '' \u010defur '' is a derogatory term for immigrant youths from ex-yugoslavia , their typical attire is either a tracksuit or casual clothing with a shiny black puffy jacket with those fur hoods , something like [ this ] ( http://cdna.lystit.com/photos/2012/08/23/tommy-hilfiger-black-long-sleeve-puffa-jacket-with-a-shiny-surface-de-product-1-4515936-218973474_large_flex.jpeg ) . 
  they also mostly wear white sports sneakers , even with jeans . 
  '' \u010dapac '' is a slovenian that acts like a '' \u010defur '' . 
  there was an incident after the last elections when the former pm 's party lost and someone not very smart posted a weird diatribe on the party 's website , full of made up `` facts '' and ridiculous conclusions , such as that the winning party forcefully mobilized 200.000 `` tracksuit people '' to vote for them . 
  there was an uproar about it and , as everything stupid and offensive that comes from that party , it became a cultural trend when people started adopting the term `` tracksuit people '' sarcastically . 
  shortly after that blog post showed up , they organized a `` tracksuit people 's '' meeting in ljubljana 's city centre just to mock the sore losers . 
  [ the teran wars ] ( http://dalje.com/en-croatia/farm-minister--slovenia-unwilling-to-jointly-protect-teran-wine/464763 ) croatian agriculture minister wanted a joint protection of teran wine , our slovenian minister said no because slovenia already protected its geographical status , eu spokesman for agriculture and rural development says only slovenia can sell it under that name . 
  we 're very bored . 
  conspiracy theories are convenient for all political actors that are past their expiration date in slovenia ( parties , trade unions , etc. 
  who have been around since before independence ) : washed up left justifies its existence with the threat of neoliberalism , washed up right blames everything on communists . 
  everyone knows what measures need to be taken , this is n't just the oecd talking . 
  every international institution , association has been saying the same thing : privatize banks and state-owned enterprises , make the labour market more flexible , improve public sector efficiency , ease the tax burden and labour costs . 
  it will be done because it 's inevitable , the only question is by who and to what extent . 
  the old parties will try to make this transition as profitable for them as they can , and they might get away with it , because competent young people either move abroad or do n't want to muddy their hands with these idiots in politics . 
  if only there were a governing body that could regulate european competitions and promote parity between them . 
  have the clubs invest the money saved on salaries into player 's education and improving club facilities . 
  there 's not enough sustainability in professional sports because it does n't show in the win-loss column . 
  in italy , serie b will [ introduce a salary cap next season ] ( http://sports.yahoo.com/news/soccer-italys-serie-b-salary-cap-next-season-194352418--sow.html ) . 
  i think uefa should strongly consider encouraging more leagues to pursue this type of thinking . 
  strange ? 
  i see a lot of potential movie locations for jason statham to kick ass in . 
  can someone explain to me why no one even considers [ microcrediting ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microcredit ) or maybe some principles of [ islamic banking ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islamic_banking ) such as this :  sharia prohibits the fixed or floating payment or acceptance of specific interest or fees ( known as riba , or usury ) for loans of money . 
   we are moving to small caribbean country where authorities have more respect to people 's assets . 
  so his plan is to move his business accounts from one tax haven to another ? 
  i 'm sorry , but i have little sympathy for people who go through so much trouble to avoid taxes . 
  why is it so difficult to pay taxes where you work and live ? 
  okay , i realize that he had some cypriot employees , but it appears his headquarters were somewhere else . 
  also , judging from his other posts , he clearly has issues with the eu and is blaming them for what his bank screwed up in the first place . 
   famous croats : nikola tesla this wo n't end well . 
  you 're welcome . 
  it 's rigid , full of bureaucracy , it discourages people from seeking new bussines ventures and offers too much room for corrupt employers to exploit employees . 
  we 'll accept any terms as long as austrians write our labour market reforms and scandinavians take care off the last wave of privatization . 
  are you referring to this part ? 
   the unconditional basic income ( ubi ) does not replace the welfare state but does complete and transform the same from a compensatory into an emancipatory welfare state . 
  i admit , that does sound overly ambitious , but it 's also ambiguous and i ca n't decide whether it actually means to add to the existing social spending or just replacing it with a different model . 
  if it 's the latter , it 'd certainly be in favour of it . 
  it combines the core ideas of socialism and libertarianism as it is intended for everyone regardless of their social status and at the same time , everyone gets personal freedom to decide what to do with the money they receive . 
  and do n't be concerned about there being no obligation to work . 
  that is actually a good thing .
