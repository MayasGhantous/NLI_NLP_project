  we 're already facing a europe wide job crisis . 
  this would leave the jobs to those who are willing to do them , which increases productivity , job performance , and overall hapiness . 
  it 'd also encourage people to pursue otherwise poorly payed professions that have high social returns . 
  i also do n't think this is as far-fetched as some believe . 
  i 'm sure a lot of the skeptics 70 years ago were calling the idea of welfare-state utopian and not being able to work for another 200 years . 
  edit : oh , i forgot to add one more thing . 
  if you go to the sign-up link , it says that the initiative is urging the eu comission to encourage member states to cooperate in ubi research . 
  so it 's not a solution that is set in stone . 
  if the concerns about this promoting laziness among people are too great , the ubi amount could still be lowered enough for people to have incentive to work . 
  good for them . 
  no secular government should arbitrarily decide which fairytale based organization can be recognized or not . 
  part of the higher consumption must be accessibility . 
  i know from personal experience not one cashier gave a fuck when i was 15 and came to the registry with a cart full of booze . 
  if you buy in bulk rather than single items , they 'd have to put all the items back if they refuse to sell them to you . 
  data was taken from [ ec 's report on food waste ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/pdf/bio_foodwaste_report.pdf ) . 
  as mentioned in / r/mapporn 's comments , it appears it 's broken down into three different categories ( household , manufacturing sector , other ) , so here are per capita numbers for them ( because i 'm bored and ca n't read italian ) : * [ household per capita ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mtktj6w.png ) * [ other per capita ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rq0fdd4.png ) * [ ms per capita ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qaguyuc.png ), 
  not saying i agree with such racial profiling , but if they had a tighter immigration policy there would be no need for controversial immigration control in the first place . 
  good for people to stand up against it . 
  meh , a silly border dispute . 
  the guy with the glasses in the picture has a house on the right bank of the river dragonja and claims it 's slovenian territory , croatia claims it 's not . 
  the guy on the floor is a populist politician here in slovenia and just an idiot in general . 
  they 've caused a number of incidents like this in the past . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/joras-pristal-v-dragonji.html ) is the best one . 
  i do n't know if the video works for you , but he gets into a scuffle with the border patrol and throws himself into the river . 
  i agree with you , but we 're way beyond that . 
  in [ this clip at around 8:00 ] ( http://www.24ur.com/kot-ce-bi-bil-slovenski-film-nominiran-za-oskarja.html ) , the director says it well : `` our goal is still to get a job in the public sector or in a multinational corporation ... '' our start-up environment is underdeveloped because we lack entreprenurial spirit , and part of it is definitely because of this hostile environment we created towards capital and business . 
  trade unions act like they 're in a battle with some big bad corporations , but the reality is , they 're only punishing the small enterprises which are crucial for such a small country . 
  it seems to me a very vocal chunk of population still thinks they can bring back workers ' self-management and everything will be peaches and gravy . 
  i 've supported every protest so far , but i think people are a bit misguided with the whole neoliberalism hate some of these groups are promoting . 
  as [ shenkey ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1a0ipf/protests_in_slovenia_continue_despite_governments/c8t16vo ) said , there has n't been much neoliberalism in slovenia - my ignorant opinion , but i do n't really equate austerity to neoliberalism . 
  i 'm very left-leaning , but we could do with some of the liberalistic solutions dl is opting for . 
  scandinavians found a good balance between capitalism and welfare state , so it can be done . 
  but what our washed up trade unions and the self-proclaimed left parties are advocating for is ruining our economy and is borderline criminal . 
  another important one is [ the european social survey ] ( http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/ ) . 
  [ eurobasket 2013 ] ( http://www.eurobasket2013.org/en/default.asp ) from september 4th to september 22nd . 
  spend your money here , we need it . 
  i am convinced norway is not a real place , only a really great troll job by the photoshop wizards for the rest of the world . 
  according to this , i am already half-german . 
  i find the mere idea of not wearing house shoes/slippers indoors at all times barbaric . 
  basketball is definitely the most popular sport in slovenia . 
  handball would be a strong contender for 2nd place with football . 
  aaaaaaand it 's in my head again . 
  i hate you . 
  there 's a song about styrians , one of the lines goes like this ( literal translation is bad , but you 'll get the picture ) : * when a styrian falls into drava , he drinks half of it out of habit , * * he leaves the other half alone , so he can make a spritzer out of it . 
  now , if you wanted to interpret the data correctly , you would separate it by social status and not by race . 
  i was suggesting the eu should tell them to shut up and focus on the actual issues . 
  i do n't think it 's normal for a pm to send out letters abroad explaining how `` communists '' have been persecuting him for 30 years . 
  the eu is dealing with debt crisis and structural reforms while slovenian politicians are taddle telling on each other and embarassing themselves in brussels . 
  apparently , we 're the only country in the world that has left-wing fascists and right-wing communists . 
  when we 're asking eu for a bailout in a couple of months , do n't blame us , blame the eu for staying silent and not telling these idiots to stop throwing crap at each other . 
  i 'd like europe to follow the recent australian immigration policy with more emphasis on integration ( not assimiliation ) and language learning in respective countries . 
  immigrants would be entitled to social benefits after they pass the native language proficiency test . 
  maybe even add in a test combining history and culture if it does n't lead to politicians ruining everything . 
  there is no tipping in slovenia because there 's a minimum wage . 
  it 's common not to bother with change and just round it up , though . 
  it would be very interesting if this chart could be compared to various economic or corruption indicators to see if there 's any correlation . 
  slovenia 's supposed to be quite popular with the brits . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.stag.si/ ) is an agency that helps them plan stag weekends . 
  i read an article a while back how they get all kinds of ideas on what they want to do on their stag parties , from having a midget accompany them to shooting with ak-47 's . 
  one party-goer even entered a swimming contest for 5-year olds and won . 
  as an average slovenian who invades croatian coastline every summer , i 'm urging you not to visit unless you 're planning to go to dubrovnik and the rest of the southern dalmatia . 
  you do n't want to have your summer ruined by the hordes of my fellow countrymen with their arsenal of screaming children and inflatable objects . 
  i am sorry , neighbours . 
  we 're yours for life . 
   one question that rises however is really - what is the rest of the world doing then ? 
  the system works because you trust in it . 
  having a relatively homogenous ( in the past ) and small population helps also . 
  other european nations are either too large and diverse ( uk , spain , france ) or are still heavily influenced by their past authoritarian regimes ( former eastern bloc and ex-yugoslavia ) . 
  this is a marketing technique called [ foreign branding ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_branding ) . 
  [ this interactive map ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2013/jan/30/languages-mapped-england-wales-census ) is very interesting and probably has great correlations with social statuses of each london district . 
  wait , what does this have to do with me ? 
  it 's just an anecdote i remembered . 
  for some reason , this reminds me of that incident when us stealth fighter was [ shot down ] ( http://partners.nytimes.com/library/world/europe/032899kosovo-rdp.html ) in ( former ) yugoslavia and the now famous phrase among the serbian people was coined : '' [ sorry , we did n't know it was invisible ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gkxebzb.jpg ) '' . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_height#average_height_around_the_world ) has slightly different numbers and more data from european countries , so here 's [ their data in excel spreadsheet ] ( http://dl.dropbox.com/u/89189046/human%20height.xlsx ) if anyone wants to make a new map . 
  we 're still irrational and bitter morons , but we 're slowly waking up . 
  there have been ongoing protests for the past few months and both biggest parties ' ratings have dropped by 10 % - 15 % . 
  the only problem remaining is that no one sane wants to deal with this mess because they 'll either be stigmatized as communist puppets by the pm or as neoliberal destroyers of the welfare state by the trade unions . 
  minority government is impossible , these idiots could n't even decide what to order if someone told them to have lunch together . 
  besides , the government has a 16 % approval rating ( which is the percentage the pm 's party gets from its loyal fanbase in every election ) and zankerh summed it up pretty well . 
  basically , there are two possible solutions : 1 . 
  the coalition parties that resigned or are about to form a new coalition with the biggest opposition party 2 . 
  preliminary elections problems are : 1 . 
  leader of the biggest opposition party is a corrupt asshole himself and he also refuses to resign so no one wants a coalition with him . 
  the major structural reforms ( apart from retirement reform ) still have n't been made because the pm opposed them to destroy the previous government . 
  if we have another preliminary elections just to shuffle the cards a bit , eu will be bailing out another country soon . 
  i am offended by this comment . 
  someone should tweet this to slovenian and croatian politicians , we have n't had a good feud since last week . 
  since the anti-corruption commision released it 's report , the prime minister 's party and its circle of supporters have waged a media war against them , blaming the whole thing on some communist conspiracy . 
  some `` moral theologist '' said this : `` if the prime minister falls , an independent slovenia falls with him '' . 
  is this cult of personality normal in other european countries ? 
  coalition parties are not demanding the whole government to resign , only the prime minister . 
  cool story bro time : an american visiting his relatives in greece chatted with me once when we were on the same boat , real friendly guy . 
  he asked me where i was from and when i told him , he kept asking me what part of pennsylvania . 
  it took a couple of tries before i successfully explained to him there 's a country in europe called slovenia . 
  it seems to me that the eu is designed not to promote solidarity and cohesiveness among member states , but to make them compete economically against each other . 
  in the long run , this is disastrous for the whole region . 
  this should not be upvoted , it 's full of misleading informations in every paragraph and incredibly biased . 
  this one 's a prime example :  the socialist government ( elected during the crisis ) tried to execute a few reforms , but being socialist it was against their nature to do austerity without the people 's consent . 
  so there was a referendum about raising the retirement age by 2 years . 
  72 % of the voter said no .
