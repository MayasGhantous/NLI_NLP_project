  72 % of the voters were not voting against the retirement age , they were voting against the government which was in deep crisis at that time because of internal fighting and scandals . 
  at that time , the current government ( opposition at the time ) who is , according to you , `` doing the right thing '' , launched a huge campaign against the proposed retirement and student employment reforms and , in cooperation with outlived trade union leaders , feed the public with populistic spin which the voters bought . 
  their only goal was to overthrow the government . 
  funny how you keep calling them `` socialist '' when they 've been trying to implement austerity measures since 2008 . 
  on the other hand , the current pm , who is accused of corruption and refuses to resign , was laughing off their efforts , claiming there was no financial crisis in slovenia . 
  this one is a co-production and it 's great : [ city folk ] ( http://www3.ebu.ch/cms/en/sites/ebu/contents/programming/tv/tv-projects/documentary/city-folk.html ) * city folk is a 28-minutes documentary magazine about modern , multicultural city life co-produced in the framework of the eurovision intercultural and diversity group ( eidg ) . 
  it portrays a colourful patchwork of people living in major european cities . 
  this story seems fishy . 
  if you disregard the whole travelling a thousand km 's to get to brussels thing , how did she get past the slovenian-croatian border and not notice anything ? 
  croatia is n't a part of the schengen area so there definitely had to be border control . 
  can someone explain to me where does movimento 5 stelle fit in on the political spectrum ? 
  what 's their stance on social and economic issues ? 
  from my 30 seconds of lazy research , they sound similar to some of the pirate parties around europe . 
   jan\u0161a responded on twitter , asserting that all his assets were fully in accordance with his earnings over the past 30 years , while the sds tweeted that the commission 's report `` has shown how deep the communist insinuations go '' . 
  another journalist takes the bait from a parody account on twitter . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://twitter.com/sdssloen/status/288604955391180800 ) the tweet , and this is the account description : * sds views and opinions in english . 
  yes , it 's a parody account . 
  * in the journalist 's defense , it 's not easy to distinguish parody from actual quotes with this party sometimes . 
  they keep tweeting about communists controlling everything and they have a number of their own propaganda media sites who , coincidentally , keep publishing the same news and citing each other . 
  their latest discovery is that this is , of course , another plot of the `` transition leftists '' to discredit jan\u0161a and that jankovi\u0107 is just collateral damage so it would n't look as suspicious . 
  i do n't know what jonas is doing nowadays , he needs to come up with something and put it on youtube . 
  it can be completely uncensored . 
  it would be interesting to find out the reasons behind some of the top rankings . 
  why are us tv shows aimed at women such popular visits on italian wikipedia ? 
  if you look at the full rankings , gossip girl and vampire diaries are on the list , too . 
  estonians have an advanced e-society with a developed it sector . 
  could that be the reason why they 're so interested in other countries ? 
  half of norway 's top 10 visits is schr\u00f8der related . 
  can someone explain this phenomena ? 
  european union ranks as one of the top 10 visits in estonia , lithuania , slovakia , romania , czech republic , all among relavitely recent eu member states . 
  i think germans might be trolling us , their top 10 is all over the place . 
  your own singer working with them is n't bad either .

  `` i do n't want to sound racist , but i 'll make an assumption based on racial prejudice anyways . '', 
  that article is bad and so is oecd 's measurement . 
  if you measure alcohol consumption with liters of alcohol bought per capita , you disregard the homemade products which are still quite common in countries with higher numbers of rural population . 
  not nearly as much as it is against corruption and the political garbage that has festered in the last 20 years . 
  what little there is of anti-austerity messages it 's directed towards budget cuts in the education and research system because it 's causing a huge brain drain .

  he 's hated because he 's a corrupt prick who pockets 10 % off of every deal the city makes . 
  there 's a reason why most of the city 's projects involve some shady investor from the balkans . 
  they can adopt the biological child of their partner . 
  they ca n't adopt an orphaned child . 
  again , you 're attributing something to me which i do n't adhere to . 
  i 'm merely explaining the theoretical argument as it was in ideal circumstances , meaning circumstances where the mother and the father of a child are both alive . 
  i do n't have a problem with it . 
  i voted yes because i thought it was the right thing to do . 
  i 'm just explaining why the majority voted no . 
  this was essentially an ideological battle because supporters of the law short-sightedly made it one . 
  there was a lot of talk about tolerance and accepting one another while in the same breath they were spewing all over religious people , sending them back to the middle-ages , even mocking their physical appearance . 
  a well-known left-wing writer said the organizers of the referendum who were against the law should 've been aborted . 
  that 's a surefire way to mobilize people to vote no . 
  you know i did n't say that . 
  a child should probably have some say in this . 
  i know children are n't capable of making such decisions themselves , but all it takes is one child growing up with same-sex parents feeling deprived of something and all the research done becomes worthless . 
  it 's the same reason i dislike religious ceremonies like baptism etc. 
  denying someone personal liberties because they are not yet capable of rational thinking . 
  one 's personal freedom should never encroach on another 's personal freedom . 
  this is a case of the personal freedom of an adult vs. the personal freedom of a child . 
  an argument was made that the more vulnerable one should be protected first . 
  majority seemed to accept that argument . 
  the argument presented by the opponents of the law was that it is natural for every child to have a mother and a father since a woman and a man are the only ones who can procreate . 
  by extending same-sex couples the legal right to adopting orphaned children , it could create legal grounds for orphaned children to be deprived of being raised by a mother figure and a father figure ; same-sex couple a gets to adopt an orphaned child over heterosexual couple b , their socio-economic status being equal , something in that respect . 
  while i personally do n't have a problem with same-sex couples raising children , it is a fair argument to make . 
  certain issues should be resolved separately . 
  most of the people who voted no are perfectly fine with same-sex couples having the same social rights as heterosexual couples . 
  they were against same-sex couples obtaining legal rights to adoption of orphaned children . 
  if the far-left party who proposed this law were pragmatic , it 'd listen to this extremely vocal minority that mobilizes the masses everytime the issue comes up . 
  they 'd make the social rights issue and the adoption issue into two separate law proposals . 
  but they did n't and this is the result . 
  i feel bad for all the same-sex couples who will not be afforded the same rights belonging to the heterosexual couples , but they should blame the party who proposed such a law , not the majority who rejected it . 
  according to hrt ( croatian national media ) , croatian minister of internal affairs already sent special police forces to remove parts of the fence that are , according to him , on croatian territory . 
  we have n't had a border dispute with croatia since , august , i think , so that 's cool , i guess . 
  op did n't say european : [ south africa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdg7pegzv5q ) [ new zealand ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvmup6scgr0 ) yes , i caught the rugby fever . 
  i 'm a sucker for multilingual anthems and there 's something heartwarming in seeing big burly men get all misty-eyed moments before they go out tackling each other . 
   how they 've been reporting about these incidents for the last few days , it seems they are not journalists and reporters , but freaking activists . 
  they definitely are activists , and they 're not even trying to hide it . 
  all it takes is looking at their twitter accounts to see what kind of stuff they post there with no editorial policy to hold them back . 
  a short summary : people protested against a corrupt mayor who has around 13 different criminal charges against him and refuses to quit . 
  at one point , i do n't know who started it , but the police started throwing tear gas into the crowd and riots broke out .

  til in russia , everyone has a dashboard camera because no one is safe . 
  looks to me like a group of extremists is fighting another group of extremists . 
  parisian authorities should give them a venue rent-free and let them go at each other , then collect profit from tickets sold . 
  the irony of all this is that the same trade unions and student organizations were the main opponents of the market labour and pension system reforms no less than a year ago . 
  they were backed by the opposition parties that form the coalition now . 
  because they rejected both reforms in the referendums , the government resigned and called for snap election . 
  today , the ( former opposition ) government is offering essentially the same reforms with a couple of cosmetic adjustments . 
  on top of that , they 're also pushing for banking system reforms to transfer the bad credits on to a `` bad bank '' which the taxpayers would essentially have to pay for , and for a creation of a state holding company , which would have complete control over state-owned companies who are already notoriously influenced by politics . 
  they even went as far as `` misplacing '' just enough petition signatures for referendums on them so that the minimum criteria of signatures required to call a referendum would not be met . 
  both the president of the parliament and the minister of internal affairs refuse to take the blame for it and resign . 
  i never understood this line of thinking , though . 
  wo n't them leaving simply clear up the market for someone else to take over ? 
  maybe different levels of railroad infrastructure play a part in it . 
  if you take a train ride through slovenia , you 'll notice they still have local passenger trains such as [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8vqar.jpg ) or [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dfy9o.jpg ) - pardon the picture , it 's the best i could find . 
  not only are they old , smelly and uncomfortable to ride with , they 're also slow .
