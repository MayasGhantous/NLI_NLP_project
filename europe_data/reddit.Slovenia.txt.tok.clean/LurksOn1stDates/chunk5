  most of the railway grid is not electrified and they still use diesel trains . 
  having a state-owned railway company that is constantly losing money does n't help either . 
  my point is that in order for europe to have a more homogenous railway system , it needs to set some minimal standards on a state level so the product they put out is appealing to customers , both aestethically and in terms of efficiency . 
  oh , r/europe , we 're so awesome and like-minded . 
  we should claim one of the countries as our own and there 'll be no political bickering that would cause setbacks . 
  what country do we take ? 
  ps : we need more women , though . 
  i think baltic and eastern-european countries have more females than males , so there 's our chance . 
  hit esc button to pause the gif , f5 to resume it . 
  like i said , i am no expert on this , so it appears i failed miserably . 
  it could still be financed additionally from various taxes , no ? 
  obviously this would need to be implemented gradually , or in some cases , it would n't even have to reach the amount for people to sustain themselves with it alone . 
  let 's say you replace the social benefits entirely . 
  at first glance , the big would seem incredibly expensive , but when you factor in the savings you get from simplifying the welfare system , the end outcome is exactly the same or even lower . 
  it basically gives people more power/freedom to manage their lives . 
  it would of course vary from country to country , depending on their gdp . 
  what is the stimulus for people on welfare to get employed right now ? 
  if they are offered a low-paying job , the cost of getting to work , the cost of childcare ultimately ends up being greater than that job pays , and it 's cheaper for them to stay unemployed and receive welfare . 
  but if big guarantees you enough money to just `` get by '' , most people would still have the motivation to work and earn more , because they have that guarantee . 
  i fully understand your point about this being utopian . 
  because it 's something completely new to us . 
  but were n't the ideas of welfare state or european union also considered utopian right after the wwii ended ? 
  this is why i started this thread . 
  to promote discussion and get some sensible arguments for and against . 
  i 'm by no means an expert on this . 
  i just think it 's something worth considering as the costs of welfare state will continue to grow with the population aging and the labour market being unstable . 
  how is eliminating bureaucracy and need for social services increasing the size of government ? 
  this is basically just redistributing various welfare options that are in place now into one giant bag which everyone no matter what their social status would be entitled to . 
  and it does n't even mean you need to get completely rid of all the social benefits . 
  some of it could still remain , within the limits of what a country can afford , of course . 
  it is a good idea if the tax is reasonably small . 
  in slovenia , the government proposed a tax around 6.5 % which is insane , because financial institutions will just offset the burden on their clients .

  well , they can surely post comments on reddit . 
  i hope those danish parents that put their children in private schools do n't expect the muslim children to integrate . 
  it 's hard to integrate when the dominant culture avoids you and lets you become the majority culture . 
  i 'm okay with this if they proclaim their political leader king in the north . 
  swear words are the one thing that the nations of ex-yugoslavia still have in common even after all these years . 
  they flow of our tongues so naturally i sometimes forget they 're actual swear words instead of figures of speech . 
  most of them describe intimate body parts coupled with a variety of attributive adjectives . 
  this is one of my favourite clips involving swearing , the context of the whole situation is no laughing matter , but his reaction is : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtfhh3ea5ke and of course , the pinnacle of darko milicic 's career : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wowqsmichoo, 
  they were n't arrested , just detained . 
  hopefully the police find enough evidence to prosecute them all . 
  he is also the leader of the biggest opposition party . 
  next stop should be the leader of the biggest coalition party and the current prime minister . 
  he has a bunch of charges on him , most serious one a charge of corruption regarding some armoured vehicles the government bought once . 
  he was also an arms smuggler during the balkan wars , but they never found sufficient or any evidence to prosecute him . 
  these two are holding back any hope of political progress as long as they hold such prominent positions . 
  once they share a jail cell , there should be enough room for political alternatives . 
  i would argue this is a consequence of neoliberal ideology prevailing in the modern world . 
  the scariest part is that our answer to neoliberalism that caused the financial crisis and exposed the flaws in the system of greece and other mediterranean countries , is more neoliberalism . 
  it 's a shame that social democracy has no voice in europe anymore . 
  i kind of want to watch this movie now . 
  poor social and living conditions , discrimination and prejudice based on their social status coupled with mob mentality . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/testimony/2006/1/12france%20vaisse/vaisse20060112 ) 's a rather short and simple description of the underlying causes for the 2005 riots . 
  it seems to me that there was little effort made in terms of integration before this incident happened . 
  nice article . 
  i wo n't claim to be politically unbiased , but i feel like that man symbolizes the solution for european union : prudence , personal responsibility , recognition of fiscal responsibility + growth perspectives and to top it off , he is proof that multiculturalism works . 
  i do n't quite agree with his views on nuclear energy , but it 's refreshing to see that there are politicians with a decent support of the voters who do n't just blindly cater to the whims of credit rating agencies or other international economic organizations . 
  i do n't know if it 's just masterfully edited or your average german is actually as sane and level-headed as most of those people in the video . 
  also , i chuckled when the young woman said `` arrogance '' and they skipped to the businessmen 's answers . 
  so they plan to promote free speech by basically banning free speech ? 
  i think protests against the film are as stupid as the film itself , but this is a slippery slope the french authorities are on . 
  this all seems to me like butting heads against a brick wall from every side . 
  in the end , you 're just covered in blood . 
  i do n't really understand the point of publishing these cartoons , do they really expect the extremists to just give up and say `` okay , you win '' ? 
  or is this just to stir the pot some more , which just seems petty to me . 
  it can be done . 
  most of the bosniaks i know seem to be doing quite well leading a secular life and staying true to their muslim beliefs . 
  it takes time , though - you ca n't expect someone from middle east to emigrate into europe and just snap out of it . 
  cheap divisive rhetorics from politicians just reinforces their insecurity and makes them cling onto fundamentalism more . 
  it 's a vicious circle . 
  i posted an article on this the other day and apparently , norwegians have had a similar policy already for a couple of years now . 
  how does it work for you , norwegian redditors ? 
  you should worry more about slovenian government not ratifying it unless that bank issue is resolved . 
  the support for the government is under 20 % and they 're doing their best to piss off everyone they can at the moment . 
  they 're in full troll mode . 
  i think the proposal is a bit idealistic and will surely get a majority of disapproval by people claiming this is feminism and discrimination , but i do n't see a better solution being offered by anyone . 
  what is there to prevent company owners from being chauvinistic ? 
  if a complaint is voiced , they can claim they picked the better and more competent candidate and that 's the end of it . 
  norwegian redditors , you already have almost identical gender quotas . 
  what 's your opinion on this ? 
  did it help the companies or did it make them less competitive in the business world ? 
  the only solution is to help the countries immigrants come from develop so that they do n't feel the need to flee . 
  and by help i do n't mean nato interference when they have vast amounts of oil supply . 
  religious institutions are sooner or later going to have to accept the fact that their own practices can not and should not overrule nation 's laws . 
  this violation of religious freedom excuse is getting really tiresome . 
  let 's not pretend like the muslims that immigrate to europe are all rocket scientists or anything .
