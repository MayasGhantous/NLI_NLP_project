[ i like trains !,

  you 're right , but `` i love you '' is still the translated as `` ljubim te '' . 
  am i seeing things or does this map seriously still depicts sfry as one entity , despite being made in 1998 ? 
  that 's just wrong ... 
  exactly . 
  it 's also one of the biggest industries and employers in novo mesto ( besides krka ) . 
  it 's not a sarcasm tag , it 's a spoiler tag . 
  he does n't want to spoil the results for swedes . 
  wow . 
  i thought i 've traveled quite a lot , but making [ this map ] ( http://imgur.com/ttqudhn ) made me realize that i really have n't . 
  i 'm only 17 though , so still i still have a lot of time . 
  also , i might 've missed some locations , since i do n't remember everything . 
  mislim , da se `` comment feedu '' re\u010de `` comment tree '' . 
  ooops . 
  i 've been to sarajevo about a year ago ( october 2013 ) and i must say i loved it . 
  a half of the city is very ottoman and gives you a bit of an oriental feeling , while the other half is very habsburg-like and can be compared to a couple of other capitals . 
  i really liked it there becuase it feels old . 
  its history is really sad though :( ... 
  yes , fraknfurt is the bank centre of germany if i recall correctly . 
  [ carantania was pretty cool too , i guess ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carantania ), 
  afaik in slovenia only males of age 17 + are conscripted in times of war . 
  women are not , but they can join if they want so . 
  what do you call a `` slovenian girl '' then ? 
  actually , ~ 50 % voted . 
  idk where you got 38 from . 
  nobody knows since he didnt talk much about his programme during the campaign and he has n't been involved in politics yet . 
  he is a lawyer and a law professor though so he seems like a good guy on paper . 
  is he capable of leading a country ? 
  i do n't know , only time will tell . 
  he is his running mate ( although we do n't have anything similar to a running mate in slovenia and most definitely not during parliamentary elections ) . 
  their campaign budget was 500 $ and candidates had to pay for the gas and other stuff out of their own pockets ( when they met their voters for the campaign ) . 
  also as you said they received no recognition from any media and basically relied on twitter and facebook to reach out to their voters . 
  they only made an appearance on tv once i believe and that was two days before the election day . 
  ** slovenia ** - [ 2014 preliminary elections ] ( http://www.rtvslo.si/news-in-english/cerar-looks-to-form-new-government/341911 ) - cardiologists of ukc maribor went on strike due to their salaries being lower than those of the cardiologists in ukc ljubljana - miners from velenje coal mines are no longer on strike, 
  to expand on this . 
  he is self-proclaimed `` neither left - nor right-wing '' , the foundation of his political programme is [ rechtsstaat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rechtsstaat ) . 
  he was very vague and did n't uncover much during his campaign though , so nobody know much about him , but people seem to trust him and he 's a new face who has n't been in politics before . 
  he promised a fight against corruption and careful privatization . 
  he is a very cautious person , i 'll give him that at least . 
  the thing in slovenia is that the new parties count on the undecided segment of the voters to vote for them . 
  they get votes because they are new and people have hope in them . 
  last time a new party won the elections ( 2011 ) it came back and bit us in the ass . 
  hope the story will not repeat itself this year ( i believe it wo n't ) . 
  in slovenia , being the `` new face '' is pretty much 80 % of the elections ( except for sds ) . 
  you can see that in zoran jankovi\u0107 's victory in the 2011 elections ( he failed to form a coalition ) who was then succeeded by first janez jan\u0161a ( whose government failed ) and then by alenka bratu\u0161ek ( who failed to carry out the remainder of the mandate ) . 
  now i hope that the same story wo n't happen with mr. cerar , but he has n't convinced me with his answers ( to me he seemed full of hot air ) . 
  but let 's see what he does first . 
  also , we have the entrenched parties in slovenia as well . 
  some of them always receive good results ( e.g. 
  sds , desus , they usually have really constant voters ) , some have been losing support lately ( sd , sls ) and some are pretty constant ( nsi ) , but i 'm pleased that we 've gotten many new parties in the parliament these elections ( smc , zl , zab - 45/90 seats which is a half ) . 
  does n't matter . 
  the elections [ `` were neither legitimate nor fair '' . 
  ] ( http://www.sds-online.org/index.php?slovenian-elections-were-not-fair-therefore-the-result-is-not-legitimate ) / s, 
  lem me translate for everyone that does n't speak slovene ( i.e. 
  pretty much everyone on / r/europe ) . 
  `` on the vignette there should be the official slovene motto `` i feel slovenia '' . 
  why ? 
  if not for anything else so that the croats who would have to buy the half-year vignette would also have to stare at the hated slovenia for half a year . '', 
  also , and this probably goes without saying , he 's a populist and a chauvinist and pretty much nobody takes him seriously . 
  yes we do . 
  this were their first parliamentary elections and they received a bit more than 1 % ( about 1,3 i believe ) . 
  the threshold for a seat is 4 % . 
  i see this as an accomplishment as their main voters are young people and in slovenia , young people are the demographic with the lowest turnout . 
  perhaps they 'll even come in the parliament come the next elections ( that would be 2018 assuming no preliminary elections take place ) . 
  it 's weird ( to me ) that many croats/serbs say that they do n't understand slovene very well , but we always understand what they say ( at least most of it ) . 
  the argument that slovenes were taught serbo-croatian in schools simply does n't make sense anymore , since it 's the same among the youth ( who do not learn serbian , croatian or serbo-croatian in school ) . 
  i 'm 17 and i have no problem understanding croatian/serbian ( speaking it is a bit different but still not so difficult ) , but according to some immigrants that i 've had a chance to talk to ( from serbia , croatia and other balkan/ex-yu countries ) , slovene is very hard to learn for them . 
  slovenia : nekropola ( the necropolis ) from boris pahor . 
  in the book he talks about his life in nazi camps during wwii . 
  in soviet russia , the airport take control of you . 
  exactly . 
  those two are the most well known paintings imo . 
  * onegavljanje * - o as in ovary , e as in sled , g as in good , a as in astound , v as video , lj read as l in loop and y in youg together , a again as in astound , j as y and e again as in sled.oh and the meaning ? 
  fornication . 
  and another one , * gajsten * , letters pronunced the same way as above , which is used to describe a person who is hard working , eager , but also fast to start a fight . 
  well i 'd think it ` similar in most if not all slavic languages . 
  it 's * de\u017e * in slovene ... 
  exactly . 
  it all went down the shitter after his death . 
  i think it was -37 , recorded in babno polje ( which is not even in the alps or even near them for the matter ), 
  survey results coming soon ^ ^ tm . 
  it 's right up there in the `` banner '' . 
  since the articel is pretty short i will go more in-depth in the comments . 
  so during the weekend , there was [ a lot of raining ] ( http://www.rtvslo.si/news-in-english/bad-weather-paralyses-slovenia/328836 ) [ and snowing ] ( http://www.rtvslo.si/news-in-english/weather-still-causing-problems-in-slovenia/328892 ) , which led to ice gathering on the tree branches which eventually broke off . 
  some of these branches destroyed transformers/power lines which led to major blackouts throughout inner carniola ( notranjska ) , upper carniola , styria and carinthia . 
  basically every region was affected , but those were hit harder ( for example velenje , 3rd biggest city in styria was without electricity ) , i live in novo mesto ( lower carniola ) and we did n't have any major outages , but ko\u010devje region ( also lower carniola ) is without electricity , as is suha krajina . 
  very many schools and kindergartens ( 75 % have been advised to close the schools , 65 % have infact been closed ) cancelled the lessons , simply because it was unsafe for people to drive on the icy roades ( some roads are said to be glass-like , but in the big cities it is n't a real problem ) . 
  also , in the heavily forested areas , trees have fallen on the road making it impossible to go to the big cities where the schools are located . 
  public transport , such as trains and buses , has also suffered from delays . 
  of course the civil defence and the army were mobilised as soon as possible . 
  about 8000 repairmen are on the job at the moment . 
  the army even sent [ an apc ] ( http://img.rtvslo.si/_up/upload/2014/02/03/65072042_photo_375870_20140203.jpg ) to bring food to some parts of the country ( because they were inaccessible with a helicopter due to weather conditions ) and the repairs have already started . 
  it is estimated that about 500 tonnes of iron will be needed in order to fully repair the infrastructure . 
  slovenian government has also asked many countries , amongst them croatia , austria and italy to help them . 
  it is estimated that slovenia need 100 generators to bring the electricity back to homes because repairs could take over a week . 
  so far we 've gathered 31 . 
  the countries that have helped us are austria , czech republic and germany ( bavaria ) , while croatia has promised to help us as well . 
  poklicna matura ( the finals for vocation schools ) have also been postponed , since many students probably would n't be able to come anyways . 
  but as always , we must look on the bright side of things .
