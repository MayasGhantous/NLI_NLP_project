  so far , there have n't been any casualties . 
  i swear this is linked every time slovenia and its position is mentioned anywhere on reddit . 
  it is a funny video made by a great person nontheless . 
  very nicely made . 
  i 'm slovene and i thought you 'd want my input here . 
  both castles you mentioned are beautiful , but some others that are very nicely preserved are ljubljana castle ( basically in the center of the city ) , celje castle and oto\u010dec castle ( a popular wedding location in oto\u010dec near novo mesto - lower carniola , an\u017ee kopitar , a slovene hockey player got married there ) . 
  along with postojna cave , a very beautiful system of caves is \u0160kocjan caves ( quite close to postojna cave ) which are also on unesco list of world heritage . 
  if you like hiking , you might want to visit tnp ( triglavski narodni park - triglav national park ) and the lakes that are located there . 
  i was there about a year ago and it was beautiful . 
  i do recommend going there in the summer/early autumn because it can get very cold up there  . 
  lastly i will comment on your `` dos and do n'ts ''  # 1 . 
  greeting strangers is not uncommon , especially outside big cities . 
  or simply `` dan !, 
  '' , which literally means `` good day !, 
  '' , is appropriate . 
  if you 're hiking in a trail and passing someone from the other direction , you are required to greet . 
  it is fairly common for people to greet each other on the streets in smaller towns/villages , but if you 're staying in for example ljubljana , it is not common/required . 
  it is polite though , as you have said , that you greet hikers while hiking ( it 's a custom ) . 
  though not as common as it was , hitchhiking is still popular and quite safe . 
  remember when i say how infrequent the public transport is ? 
  there 's one of your solution . 
  hitchhiking is not really common , but as you have said , it is usually safe to hitchhike . 
  it 's particularly common amongst the students that are n't living in ljubljana , but study there . 
  be punctual . 
  slovenians easily lose respect to you if you are late on your first meeting with them . 
  i disagree with this one personally . 
  it really depends on the person , but it 's not typical for slovenes to resent you for being late ( though they might be a bit annoyed ) . 
  slovenians like to plan ahead , stick to their plans and keep their promises . 
  slovenians pay their debts . 
  again , depends on the person . 
  i like to plan ahead , but some people do n't . 
  also slovenes do n't pay their debts , that 's why our banks are on the verge of bankruptcy  . 
  ask the bill and pay directly to the waiter . 
  leaving money on the table is impolite . 
  tipping is not required and not practiced , but still welcomed . 
  not sure whether leaving money on the table is impolite . 
  in a restaurant definitely pay to the waiter , but if you 're in a bar just for a coffee , you can leave the money on the table ( i do sometimes , if i 'm in a hurry ) . 
  handshake is the norm when you meet someone for the first time . 
  kissing is only when you really know the person . 
  yep , do n't kiss people when you first meet them ( does n't matter whether you 're a man or a woman ) . 
  remove shoes when you enter people 's house . 
  sometime the host will equip you with a pair of slippers . 
  taking off your shoes is customary unless your host asks you to leave them on ( in case it 's cold inside and they do n't have spare slippers for example ) . 
  if you visit a friend though , they will usually insist you keep your shoes on ( but i usually take them off regardless ) . 
  people usually do n't like it when you say that slovenia is eastern europe . 
  central or southeastern europe is generally more acceptable . 
  calling slovenia an eastern europe/balkan country usually has a negative tone to it in slovenia . 
  i do n't really get it . 
  it 's probably a case of our imaginary superiority ( in that we want to distance ourselves from our ex-yugoslav neighbours ) . 
  communism and socialist pass times are not really a good conversation topic , unless you already familiar with the person . 
  try to avoid it . 
  the only reason to abstain from making comments about communism/socialism/old regime is that the person you 're talking to did n't like the system . 
  otherwise , it 's not a taboo . 
  slovenians are really easily impressed if you speak a bit of their language . 
  it 's the ultimate ice breaker !, 
  so . . ladies . . of course we are impressed . 
  our language is damn hard ( you know with duality and all the exceptions and stuff ) . 
  hope i helped in any way !, 
  exactly . 
  that was kinda my point although it was n't explicit enough . 
  i guess because balkans is often ( not justly so though ) thought to be in connection with something bad/inferior . 
  like you know : poor , shit everywhere , cheap labour etc. 
  i guess greeks just want to distance themselves from that ,

  why would you be extradited to the uk when usa is the one suing you ? 
  ** slovenia ** * [ out banks ' stress tests ' results came in ] ( http://www.rtvslo.si/news-in-english/slovenia-says-its-banks-need-4-8-bln-euros-in-extra-capital/324841 ) and apparently banks need * only * 4.8 bn $ of financial aid . 
  the big three alone need about 3.5 bn and by far the farthest in debt is nlb ( nova ljubljanska banka ) which needs about a third of the total 4.8 bn ( while they pay their managers huge amounts of money and large severance checks ) . 
  * [ a new party is forming ] ( http://www.rtvslo.si/news-in-english/lubej-mandelc-and-tavcar-krajnc-to-head-solidarity-party/325020 ) , called solidarity party . 
  it is being formed by the leaders of the 3 `` big '' protest movements in slovenia . 
  they claim they will return the power of decision to the people like it should be . 
  seems good on paper to me , but we 'll have to wait to see it in practice ( in the next elections hopefully ) . 
  [ here is the article in slovene . 
  ] ( http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/lubej-mandelc-in-tavcar-krajnc-na-celo-solidarnosti/324984 ) * the mayor of ljubljana - zoran jankovi\u0107 was pepper sprayed during the protest in the capital . 
  he later invited the guy who maced him ( publicly of course ) to a coffee to explain him what he did wrong . 
  that 's it from what i can tell . 
  not much happening besides the regular political mumbo-jumbo . 
  it is n't really surprising seeing how their healt care system sucks balls . 
  depends on where you come from . 
  i come from a place that 's known for speaking `` the best slovene in slovenia '' so i normally try to uphold this reputation and use dual . 
  though for someone coming from outside of big cities ( or you know prekmurje / \u0160tajerska , because they usually ca n't speak slovene at all :d ) they usually just use plural ( like `` domov pridem \u010dez 2 ure '' instead of `` 2 uri '' ( i 'll be home in 2 hours ) . 
  i assure you that if you use plural all the time you 'll still probably speak slovene better than about 1/2 of the population ( some people ca n't even differentiate the genders and they are n't immigrants or anything ) . 
  it is true though that even native speakers are n't sure sometimes , but i usually do n't have many problems with that . 
  that and of course each gender has 3 patterns of declination ( for the lack of a better word ) and each one of those has a tonne of exceptions ( like korak ( step ) --  korak ** a ** ( genitiv form ) but nagelj ( carnation ) --  nagelj ** na ** ( again genitiv ) or the declination of noun otrok ( child ) in dual or plural : dual : 1 . otrok ** a ** ( 2 children ) 2 . otrok 3 . otrok ** oma ** 4 . otrok ** a ** 5 . o otro ** cih ** 6 . z otrok ** i ** plural : 1 . otro ** ci ** ( 3 children ) 2 . otrok 3 . otrok ** om ** 4 . otrok ** e ** 5 . o otro ** cih ** 6 . z otrok ** i ** whereas a regular word from the same declination pattern ( e.g. 
  korak ( step ) - a school case ) would look like dual : 1 . korak ** a ** ( 2 steps ) 2 . korak ** ov ** 3 . korak ** oma ** 4 . korak ** a ** 5 . o korak ** ih ** 6 . s korak ** oma ** plural : 1 . korak ** i ** ( 3 steps ) 2 . korak ** ov ** 3 . korak ** om ** 4 . korak ** e ** 5 . o korak ** ih ** 6 . s korak ** i ** you can clearly see the special endings of the noun `` otrok '' that very much differ from the `` rule '' endings in `` korak '' ) . 
  edit : forgot to say , it 's a pain in the ass to learn for us too :d . most people declinate the nouns the wrong way anyway . 
  ok i think i understand now , but would n't it be counter-productive to make your customers work less for your product therefore making you less profit ? 
  thanks by the way !, 
   and then they would print money to depreciate it . 
  can someone eli5 to me why would that boost their economy . 
  i visited sarajevo in october and i must say i was totally amazed by it . 
  the architecture is a cool mix of austro-hungarian and ottoman styles and people are really friendly . 
  the food is absolutely delicious ( if you like meat of course ) . 
  of course there 's also a sad side of it . 
  you can see graves in pretty much every part of the town and there 's still a lot of buildings left damaged by the war . 
  i always thought that spain being gmt +1 and the uk being gmt , even though they 're basically of same geographical longitude ( actually spain is even more west than the uk ) was really silly . 
  nice to see them considering making things logical . 
  * they are serbia 's big bros * [ they have mad dancing skills ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izerat4fbwa&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player ) * biggest country in the world , but sparsely populated ( siberia and stuff ) * stalin , lenin , communism * 140 % of population vote * they have their own religion ( russian church ) * sent a lot of stuff in space ( sputnik , gagarin , laika , first woman whose name i forgot ) * a lot of novels from realism period ( ana karenina , war and peace , crime and punishment ... ) * vodka ( yuck ) * dashcams * prisoners in siberia have to work ( at least in some prisons ) * pretty backwards in the manner that they prosecute homosexuals etc. 
  also pretty conservative * rivalry with the usa, 
  un at least prevented them from being totally surrounded , even though many people got shot still even on their land ( the sarajevo airport ) . 
  well til then .
