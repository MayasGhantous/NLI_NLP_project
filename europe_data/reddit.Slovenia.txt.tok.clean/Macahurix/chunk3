  thanks for this . 
  yeah , true . 
  but since it 's bosnian ( and in bosnia there are 3 ethnic groups : bosniaks , croats and serbs ) , the serbian language is the only one of the 3 that is written in cyrillic . 
  because serbian is written in cyrillic . 
  i live in novo mesto and most of people my age ( i 'm 17 btw ) speak pretty bad or horrendous english . 
  but the english proficiency seems to be higher amongst young adults though ( 20-25 years ) . 
  it 's entirely possible that in different regions people speak english better though . 
  just thought i 'd share my expirience on the topic . 
  there 's this irish man at my school ( i 'm slovene ) and even though he 's a native speaker he still ca n't explain grammar like our professor who has master 's degree in english . 
  of course he can offer advice on everday english , but he can not explain stuff such as the difference between `` the house could not have been broken into '' and `` that many people could not have died in the tsunami '' . 
  not that he does n't know the difference , he just ca n't explain it very well . 
  to sum it up , i totally agree that someone who spent about 5 years studying every aspect of the english language can definitely speak and know it better than some native speakers . 
  it 's still nice to see slovenia so high up ( i mean 10 . place is much higher than what i expected ) . 
  most people i know speak english poorly or do n't even speak it at all . 
  yeah , i sometimes watch a movie with serbian subtitles and it irks me when names are written as they are spoken ( `` pi\u0161i kao \u0161to govori\u0161 '' ) . 
  i 'm slovene and i found these jokes funny , 
  yeah , that was stupid . 
  our country is full of idiots and incompetent fools .

  some were , some were not . 
  read more about it here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_erased, 
  yes we are . 
  but the erased deserve more than just the monetary compensation , since the whole thing was purely bullshit . 
  the government should publicly apologize and explaine the reason for the situation at least . 
  let me try to explain it ( but i will probably make a whole lot of mistakes so someone please correct me if so ) . 
  before slovenia became an independant state , we were in a federation called yugoslavia ( in case you did n't know ) . 
  in yugo every person had 2 citizenships , a yugoslav one and one of a country in which you have been born ( so if you were born in ljubljana you had a slovene citizenship and yugoslav citizenship ) . 
  people could , naturally , freely travel yugoslavia , so people moved places ( and worked in different countries than the ones they were born in ) . 
  yugoslavia was basically a mesh of all different nationalities and citizenships , but when the war for independence started and when slovenia became independent , the people that did n't have slovene citizenships ( e.g. 
  you were born in sarajevo then came to work in slovenia , you only had bosnian and yugoslav citizenship , but no slovene , except if you explicitly asked for it ) , simply `` did n't exist '' for the government . 
  all in all , the problem was really that there was no proper motivation to solve the problem of erased citizens . 
  when yugoslavia still existed there was no need to have a slovene citizenship to live in slovenia , but when it fell apart , you had to have slovene citizenship in order to exist there . 
  hope i 'm right and that i helped you . 
  edit : here 's also a wikipedia link which might help you understand the situation better : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_erased, 
  ** slovenia ** - 16 000 people fined due to missing vignettas - car accident on primorje highway - ms. merkel spoke with our pm and said it has full confidence in our capabilites ( pure bs if you ask me ) - ex mayor of maribor mr. kangler gets hit by another police charge , the 14th in a row - health system is in troubles - car licensing fee are about to rise, 
  funny you should mention levi 's . 
  i know of a certain chinese guy who can import genuine levi 's jeans from china for 10-20 $ while in shops they cos 60 $ +, 
  well considering that at one point ottomans besieged vienna , the most definitely attacked slovene lands as well . 
  several military frontiers were established ( combining your lands even ) in order to try and curb the ottoman attacks . 
  at some point , the people of maribor struck a deal with ottomans providing them passage over drava river and in exchange the ottomans did n't attack them . 
  hope that helped !, 
  emphasized : - i think both world wars are pretty emphasized in our lessons ( especially so\u010da front in wwi and slovene homeguard/partisans in wwii ) . 
  - formation of kingdom of yugoslavia ( or kingdom of slovenes , croats and serbs ) and later the formation of republic of yugoslavia ( or republic of serbs , croats and slovenes ) . 
  left out : - idk , maybe the atrocities committed by both sides during wwii , maybe some other stuff too . 
  i think slovenian history is pretty well covered in our schools , but still the conflict between slovene homeguard and partisans is felt and depending which side your teacher is on , you might have a biased view on the matter . 
  edit : i forgot the turkish attacks on our lands , states of carantania and carinthia and coronation of carantanian dukes which were all emphasised in our school too . 
  ye there 're still some minefields left from the war . 
  not so long ago , a skydiver landed on a minefield somewhere in bosnia . 
  but at least the countries that still have those minefield try to take care of them ( or so i 've heard ) . 
  well slovenia is n't really east of germany , but whatever take my upvote , 
  depends on where you go . 
  slovenia has none ( afaik ) , croatia does n't have any on their islands and other tourist locations , minefields are mostly in bosnia though ( at least that 's what i heard , sorry if i 'm mistaken ) . 
  edit : and even bosnia is n't filled with them , they 're just there in some places ( not in cities though ) . 
  yep . 
  the souther you go the more they swear ( and i 'm completely fine with that ) . 
  until we solve our political problems we can not hope to achieve rise in gdp . 
  i was not surprised at all by this forecast . 
  here are some genuine slovene swear words which are normally not considered vulgar : - * tristo kosmatih * / * jebelacesta * - three hundred hairy ones/the white road ( it 's written together in this instance ) which is basically used as goddamit . 
  - * prmejdu\u0161 * - by my soul ( again written together in this instance ) , used either to solidify a statement or used when surprised - * frdaman * - adjective , used as goddamn ( * frdamani otroci * - goddamn children ) - * kr\u0161\u010den mati\u010dek * - baptised mati\u010dek ( mati\u010dek is a slovene name ) , used similarly to * tristo kosmatih * - * bes te plentaj * - rage smite you ( negation and degratory term ) - * pojdi se solit * - go salt yourself ( meaning fuck off , but in a softer way ) - * gromska strela * - thunder lightning ( act of surprise ) - * larifari * - bullshit - * \u0161alabajzer * - unimportant person and also some vulgar ones : - * kurac * - cock - * pizda * - cunt ( body organ ) - * pi\u010dkica * - pussy , used for cowardly men - * \u0161upak * - not really slovene , but means asshole - * debil * - idiot - * pizdun * - fucker, 
  also some genuine slovene swear words which are normally not considered vulgar : - * tristo kosmatih * / * jebelacesta * - three hundred hairy ones/the white road ( it 's written together in this instance ) which is basically used as goddamit . 
  - * prmejdu\u0161 * - by my soul ( again written together in this instance ) , used either to solidify a statement or used when surprised - * frdaman * - adjective , used as goddamn ( * frdamani otroci * - goddamn children ) - * kr\u0161\u010den mati\u010dek * - baptised mati\u010dek ( mati\u010dek is a slovene name ) , used similarly to * tristo kosmatih * - * bes te plentaj * - rage smite you ( negation and degratory term ) - * pojdi se solit * - go salt yourself ( meaning fuck off , but in a softer way ) - * gromska strela * - thunder lightning ( act of surprise ) - * larifari * - bullshit - * \u0161alabajzer * - unimportant person, 
  well let me explain for people not from the balkans : - * pejt u kurac * - fuck off - * kurac te gleda * - i do n't give a shit about you - * kurac !, 
  * - i 've got a ferrari - get out of here !, 
  - * fafaj kurac * - suck a dick - * poln kurac te imam * - i 've had enough of you - * kur\u010devi ______ * - fucking _______ ( as an adjective ) there 's probably more , but i can not remember any more right now . 
  that was entertaining . 
  the way it is written just makes it for me . 
  on an unrelated note : i thought i understood croatian , but this dalmatian dialect threw me off a bit . 
  exactly . 
  while we 're not doing all too well at the moment and while many do n't agree with the government in power , i 'm so sick of whining . 
  yes , we 're not world 's nr . 
  1 economic power , but are we literally shit ? 
  no we 're not . 
  if you think it 's so bad try spending a week or so in , i do n't know , congo ? 
  you 'll see what a truly shit country looks like . 
  kozel ( czech ) or kilkenny ( irish ) are probably my favorite . 
  i also liked trappist orval when i tried it , duvel is also good ( both belgian ) . 
  awww , stop it , you , 
  for me it has to be [ piran ( ~ 4k inhabitants ) . 
  ] ( http://www.portoroz.si/si/imagelib/slidingbanner2-mobile-center/default/images/piran/piran_jaka_jerasa_pomanjsana.jpg ), 
  party list proportional representation d'hondt method . 
  90 seats up for the taking , 2 are reserved for representatives of both minorities ( italian and hungarian ) . 
  4 % threshold i believe . 
  there 's a bunch of smokers in slovenia , among the youth as well . 
  but the trend i notice is that there are far more female smokers than male . 
  i personally despise smoking , but alas i 'm friends with a couple of smokers so i drink my coffee outside , despite preferring the inside of a bar . 
  edit : did a little research and found out that about 25 % of slovene smoke , and apparently i was wrong about more women smoking . 
  also 50 % of 15-year-olds have tried smoking . 
  apparently 3600 slovenes die every year of smoking related illnesses . 
  on a plus side there 're fewer and fewer smokers every year . 
  native : slovene speak : * english ( rather well ) * german ( my diploma says c1 , but i feel much worse ) * a bit of croatian want to learn : * chinese * arabian, 
  my favorite german rap is [ sido ( and others ) - 30-11-80 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1z_gb7nglq ) . 
  for slovenia it 's more like : left leaning : janez jan\u0161a is the devil incarnate right leaning : the previous communist regime is devil incarnate, 
  no idea about the colors , but my guess would be it has something to do with the slavs . 
  the coat of arms on the other hand was well explained . 
  the three stars stand for [ counts of celje ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/counts_of_celje ) , the mountain represent [ triglav , our highest mountain ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/triglav ) and river represents our many rivers , though it 's commonly believed to be [ sava ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sava ) . 
  slovenia at 7 makes me sceptic . 
  everyone i know complains about living here and how they would want to get out - . -,
