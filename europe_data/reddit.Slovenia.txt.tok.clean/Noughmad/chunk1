yes there is , the two nuts-2 regions : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuts_statistical_regions_of_slovenia . 
  this should be the standard for european maps anyway . 
  their lack of nukes is due to political reasons , though . 
  irish ? 
  if anything , they 're the only actually white people : http://i.imgur.com/fpuuf.jpg, 
  traffic delays due to holiday season . 
  they should wait till winter . 
  the correct spartan response is `` if '' . 
  thou shalt dissolve thine pigments !, 
  to a german , food is a city . 
  to be honest , they have cheat codes . 
  i like how about half the countries are missing , but finland is the only one with `` no data '' . 
  also , we have a saying that one `` smokes like a turk '' , which i see is backed by data . 
  now this is a quality writeup , my siberian friend . 
  but the klingon homeworld is named kronos . 
  would n't greece object to that as well ? 
  they are protecting their coast , you ca n't build less that x ( i think it 's 100m , but i could be wrong ) from the sea . 
  prices of existing seafront houses are high , but the coast itself it well preserved , especially on the islands . 
  i have just one certificate ( from nlb ) and it works for everything . 
  my trouble is that you need a separate signing plugin/program for every part , and some of those do n't work on linux . 
  italians showing americans as gangsters seems ironic . 
  however , allies actively cooperated with the mafia during the invasion of sicily . 
  slovenia invading ? 
  how will the ever defend against [ this ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/pilatus_pc-9 ) ? 
  and even if they down one , we have a whole eight more !, 
  i lived on a street named after him for five years . 
  til who he was . 
  in some cases , literally . 
  wrong hill , wrong country , what 's the difference ? 
  i can see it from the pixel . 
  * something something * will smith * something something * jeff goldblum * something something * ~ ~ aliens ~ ~ illegal economic migrants * something something * macbook . 
  i 'm guessing it 's a joke because of today 's date . 
  another thing the millennials are killing . 
  but mongols are a chinese hoax !, 
  way to botch a joke . 
  chinese question is `` how many are you '' , ku\u010dan says two million , chinese then follows up `` and in which hotel are you staying ? '', 
  on the flip side , if you invaded , cheap map downloads would come in handy . 
  apart from lack of coat of arms ( hello slovakia !, 
  ) , this image would benefit from less jpeg . 
  could you please make a png so that there are no smudges around the stars ? 
  when you play on lowest settings . 
  sure , let 's send all our politicians to prison . 
  i still do n't know if that means joining the us , russia , or france . 
  i hope it 's not slovenia . 
  do you know any examples of such cities ? 
  and more importantly , do you know the car ownership statistics of such a city ? 
  i live in a `` city '' of 300k people , which obviously is n't big enough for a subway or even trams , so it 's probably not what you call `` good-quality '' . 
  but walking , bike and busses get you everywhere . 
  at least for me , i was completely ok without a car until i got a kid . 
  you can hardly really take a small child on a bus , especially not in bad weather . 
  it also increases the need for shopping , both in terms of frequency ( we urgently need some milk ) and volume ( buying large packs of diapers ) . 
  and there 's the emergency factor , what if we need to see a doctor in the middle of the night ? 
  and we have to visit parents , and go to the seaside , hills , or some other leisure spot sometimes . 
  last , europeans are rich enough so that almost every family can afford at least one car . 
  even if they are not needed for our basic needs , it 's still useful in many occasions . 
  you ca n't really compare it to a boat , its utility is far greater and it costs about the same . 
  not really , no . 
  commute with a car is optional , but you still need a car for occasional trips , visiting grandparents in the country , vacations , etc. 
  so while cities can have few parking spaces ( or even outright ban cars ) in the business center , you still need them in residential areas . 
  i may be missing some english terminology here , are you talking about buildings like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tenement#/media/file:square_wroc%c5%82aw_2.jpg ) ? 
  apart from the problem of being old , having no open spaces nearby , and terrible access with a car , i also do n't care for that style . 
  the color is nice , but the decorations only look good if they are all together . 
  place one of these instead of a rectangular block , and it will look ridiculous . 
  i do n't know how much grass are you talking about . 
  are the buildings 100m or a kilometer apart ? 
  but grass and trees are a good thing . 
  we have them too , ljubljana was european green capital in 2016 . 
  the thing is , a single of these buildings has almost 200 appartments . 
  100 individual houses would take more space than the building and all the grass surrounding them . 
  they may not be modern anymore , but there is n't anything really wrong with them . 
  if you paint them in anything but gray , they also do n't look so bad . 
  they are well built , very space-efficient , everything is close , and because living space is concentrated there is lots of room for green areas and playgrounds ( as also seen in the postcard ) . 
  the only problem we have with these buildings is the lack of parking spaces . 
  most in ljubljana were built in 60s and 70s , when not everybody had a car , now many families have two . 
  so the new blocks are now lower ( up to about 5 floors rather than 15 ) and have underground garages . 
  i now live in a new ( built in 2014 ) rectangular concrete appartment block . 
  it looks like this : http://www.odprtehiseslovenije.org/wp-content/themes/enfold-child/ohs_images/images/brdo_ohs5.jpg , still rectangular , just non-gray and with bigger windows . 
  there are the [ tall ships ' races ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tall_ships%27_races ) . 
  not quite what you have in mind , though . 
  slovenia has '' \u010dmrlj '' . 
  i like the sci-fi references in other comments , but this is pretty much the electric monk from dirk gently 's holistic detective agency by douglas adams . 
   the electric monk was a labour-saving device , like a dishwasher or a video recorder . 
  dishwashers washed tedious dishes for you , thus saving you the bother of washing them yourself , video recorders watched tedious television for you , thus saving you the bother of looking at it yourself ; electric monks believed things for you , thus saving you what was becoming an increasingly onerous task , that of believing all the things the world expected you to believe . 
  that 's the point . 
  just like trump is trying to divide the eu by pursuing individual trade deals that the eu has to block . 
  what 's stopping the eu from trying to make bilateral deals with all u.s. states that voted against trump ? 
  yes , kde is great , and i 'm happy to use it . 
  but the os and desktop environment is n't close to being all uses of computers . 
  we use desktop computers for google , facebook , amazon , instagram , reddit , whatever else , they 're all american companies . 
  we use phone and tablets , either made by apple or running google 's software . 
  yes . 
  so , the `` rich '' countries are norway , germany , luxembourg and slovenia . 
  we 're in good company , 
  it 's the french , a strike is the only form of retaliation they know . 
  * pulj . 
  ( that 's our official name , as if anyone actually calls it that ), 
  then how do they know you 're not voting for someone else ? 
  * bmw logo . 
  once upon a time it was in the same country as babylon . 
  `` alcohol is good . '',
