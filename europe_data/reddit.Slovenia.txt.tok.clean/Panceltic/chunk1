i see , thanks , 
  well i meant to ask if there is a physical crown that the king sometimes wears , 
  the idea of a postage stamp was first proposed by [ lovrenc ko\u0161ir ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lovrenc_ko\u0161ir ) , but sadly the austrian post office did n't like his idea . 
  so there is no actual crown ? 
  i do n't see why italians would be particularly ` entitled ' to a new roman empire . 
  in its heyday it included large parts of europe and some of asia and africa . 
  loads of migrations happened since and the fact that rome is situated in what is now italy does n't really mean anything . 
  after all , the roman empire existed ( in constantinople ) for 1000 years after the fall of rome . 
  my country thinks it * is * the `` second switzerland '' , or at least did so until recently . 
  welsh !, 
  oh , there was a referendum in croatia , montenegro , b&h , macedonia and serbia you know . 
  about slovenia 's independence . 
  dont be ridiculous . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  for example ? 
  i do n't think any country would be able to secede if this were true . 
  you have a point , but they have started just like transnistria . 
  it is only the course of events that has led to its semi-legitimate status nowadays . 
  various reasons , diplomatic kerfuffles ... maybe because they feel it should not be a country , i do n't know . 
  because other countries do n't recognise its independence . 
  similar stories with kosovo , abkhazia , nagorno-karabakh , south ossetia etc. 
  to expand on this answer , slovenian is extremely dialectally diversified for such a small language . 
  there are as much as 50 different dialects , grouped into 7 main groups . 
  the standard language is an artificial language learned by all in school . 
  nobody really speaks it ( except newsreaders on tv ) , rather people use a ` conversational ' standard of their own dialect group . 
  it is usually immediately obvious what part of the country the person is from . 
  dialects form a continuum ( as in all languages ) so a person from ljubljana will not get a word when listening to prekmurje or rezija dialect , but a person speaking a neighbouring dialect will have no troubles . 
  i do n't think any region of slovenia is very extremely poor . 
  i never claimed it was , read the first sentence of my comment . 
   it is considered a ` lost territory ' because it was ( still is , to a certain degree ) populated by slovene-speaking population . 
  lots of areas inhabited by slovenes were not included in the formation of yugoslavia and , by consequence , they are not part of slovenia now . 
  this is seen as a historical injustice , but no-one is seriously advocating getting these territories back ( nor would they like to join ) . 
  we are , however , always happy to exclaim `` trst je na\u0161 '' ( trieste is ours )  aside from trieste ( just look at the map , the narrow italian territory is artificially extended southward to reach the city , an important port ) , there is carinthia in austria ( a result of a not-really-fair referendum in 1920 ) and other border regions with italy .

  we are still wary with turks . 
  bad memories from the 15th/16th centuries . 
  none , sadly . 
  :( in ljubljana , they were withdrawn in 1958 . 
  [ looked like this ] ( http://www.delo.si/assets/media/picture/20150528/tramvaj%20na%20mestnem%20trgu%20leta%201958.jpg?rev=0 ) . 
  same here . 
  turkish at home , made in a trusty old [ d\u017eezva like this ] ( http://cdn.merkurimg.si/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/p/o/posoda-za-tople-napitke-emo-dzezva-0.7-l-za-8-oseb-polka-zelena_2131943_.jpg ) ; usually cappuccino or latte in a caf\u00e9 . 
  just a side note , having a * de * or * von * or whatever in your surname is completely irrelevant in connection with noble status . 
  four, 
  everyone drinks tap water here . 
  english : american/canadian ( can not hear the difference ) , scottish , welsh , irish , northern english , southern english german : generally north/south french : quebec from the rest bcs : basically all variations, 
  i can easily distinguish british from american ; and scottish , welsh , irish and northern/southern english . 
  i would n't be able to spot a canadian , australian or new zealand accent though . 
  - paying by card/paypal - transferring to the recipient 's bank account - cash on delivery, 
  i think finland and the netherlands are the only eurozone countries who have laws about rounding prices to the nearest 5c . 
  they still produce 1c and 2c coins but only in small quantities for collectors . 
  other eurozone countries , as far as i 'm aware still regularly produce and circulate 1c and 2c coins , with different degrees as to how much people ` care ' about them . 
  yes , the biggest slovenian diasporas are in the usa , canada , australia and argentine . 
  i heard once that before wwi , the biggest slovenian city was cleveland , oh ( with trieste second and ljubljana third ) . 
  usually connected with a [ certain demographic group ] ( http://www.mladina.si/media/www/slike.old/mladina/cefurji_mladifuzinci_mm.jpg ) . 
  there are around 700 people with my surname in slovenia . 
  although its orthographic variant is much more common ( around 2200 people ) . 
  my mother 's maiden name is shared by around 2800 people . 
  id card is totally fine for the uk . 
  i have used mine ( obviously not belgian :d ) on numerous occasions , i did n't even have a passport at the time . 
  not true , as eu citizens they can travel to another eu ( schengen or not ) country with their id card only . 
  the problem is that ireland does not have id cards at all , so in practice they need passports . 
  confusing with slovakia does not really trigger us , but the balkan thing does . 
  balkans actually cover a far larger area than ex-yu , but geographicay speaking only a half of slovenia ( south of the sava ) lies in the balkans . 
  the immense dislike we have to being connected with the balkans is of course not of geographic nature . 
  any of the following : - slovenia is a part of the balkans - slovenia is in eastern europe, 
  same here . 
  there was also another seried by enid blyton ( the secres or sth like that ) . 
  oh yes , i love those . 
   anyway they are talking here about house names as in houses which do n't have a number , just a name . 
  no , it 's just border controls . 
  uk has a border station on french soil so people clear immigration before boarding the train to london and arriving into the uk as domestic passangers . 
  the situation is reversed in london , where there are french controls for those going to the continent . 
  there is also a similar agreement between ireland and the us , and probably elsewhere in the world . 
  yeah they are well integrated . 
  the area where they live ( extreme north-east ) is quite remote from the rest of slovenia so , not being from there , i do n't really have any personal experience with them . 
  i do n't think they refuse to speak slovenian , but obviously use hungarian between themselves . 
  there are hungarian-language elementary and secondary schools in the area so the education in the language is guaranteed . 
  bilingual signs are everywhere and members of the minority have a possibility to communicate with official bodies through hungarian . 
  even passports and id cards are issued in both languages . 
  the hungarian minority elects one deputy to our parliament . 
  the same applies to the italian minority . 
  i think our country exercises great care for its two official minorities , which sadly is n't reciprocated on the other side of the border . 
   i think as an american our relationship with the uk is fairly good are you implying the us colonised the uk in the past ? 
  for historical reasons , borders between countries often do n't follow areas of population of the same nation/language . 
  that is why we have slovenians living in austria , italy and hungary ; and hungarians and italians living in slovenia ( to cite examples from my country ) . 
  schengen area is a very recent agreement in the grand scheme of things , and i do n't believe it changed the situation in any way . 
  even in the time of border controls , people crossed the borders daily and communicated with their neighbours . 
  scotland should be your first port of call . 
  i 've seen them in slovakia , yes . 
  felt very creepy . 
  best thing : we have access to the sea . 
  worst thing : we do n't have access to the sea . 
  pl and hu together ? 
  [ checks out . 
   ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pole_and_hungarian_cousins_be ), 
  well , '' \u0161iptar '' is also the only word albanians use to refer to themselves , yet they go crazy if an `` outsider '' calls them that . 
  similar with `` nigger '' etc. 
  wow , great story !,
