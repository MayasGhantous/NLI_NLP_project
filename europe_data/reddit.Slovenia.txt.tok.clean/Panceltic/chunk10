  and the wonderful zaova , jetrva , svast , dever , \u010dukundeda and so on . 
   how did you come to be a pan-celtic slav ? 
   i ca n't remember , 
  so to say ` clinton jeb trump ' is a political statement ... ? 
  well it seems to me that ` hast ' is the exception here . 
  i would sooner make a mistake and say ` du habst ' than ` ha ' for imperative . 
  yes , tones are pretty much innate . 
  people who speak a tonal language learn them automatically and it is something that is quite hard to explain , so generally it is not taught in schools . 
  also there is usually great difference between dialects which makes standardization a bit difficult . 
  we definitely learnt it in elementary school . 
  we learnt printed letters at first ( first uppercase , then lowercase ) . 
  then the teacher said something along the lines of ` let 's move to * the really fancy cool-looking * way of writing now ! ', 
  and then we learnt the cursive ( first lowercase , then uppercase ) . 
  but by the time we left the elementary school , everybody stopped using it and reverted to something in the middle , as others have said here . 
  do n't you have articles in romanian ? 
  in the wrong place , admittedly . 
  can i touch you ? 
  whence , thence , hence !, 
  surely you meant where / whither in english ( with their delightful brother whence ) . 
  in slovenian , we also have kje ( where ) , kam ( where to ) and kod ( which way ) . 
  well the real aorist goes : bych byst / by byst / by ... [ dual ] ... bychom byste by\u0161\u0119 so it 's not exactly the same !, 
  the subjunctive and optative disappeared long ago , that 's correct . 
  but they left traces in all these ` by ' words , contaminated to various degrees in various languages by aorist forms . 
  there are three tones in latvian : level ( also drawling , sustained ) tone ( stiept\u0101 inton\u0101cija ) falling tone ( kr\u012bto\u0161\u0101 inton\u0101cija ) broken tone ( lauzt\u0101 inton\u0101cija ) as opposed to lithuanian ( and slovenian for that matter ) - we have just two tones . 
   i envy the latvians . 
  they seem to always stress the first syllable in every word and do n't burden themselves much . 
  but they burden themselves with the wonderful third , ` broken ' tone !, 
  doma . 
  slavic languages all have conditional mood !, 
  the ` special word ' you talk about is actually not the verb ` to be ' in aorist , but in a remnant form of the optative ( long disappeared ) . 
  aorist is also not gone , it is ( together with imperfect ) very much alive in bulgarian , macedonian , serbian , croatian , bosnian and sorbian languages . 
  well the real montenegro is not [ much different ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/podgorica_lok_vc.jpg ) . 
  it 's not t. rather a very soft k. 
  it means ` black mountain ' in all languages , to be frank . 
  why would it be offensive ? 
  he definitely played a part in our history . 
  while the majority of people remember him as a godlike figure who was able to hold the country together and enabled decent lives for everybody , he surely was n't a blameless person . 
  i replied before you edited your comment !, 
  absolutely . 
  come and check !, 
  yes , i 'd like to see more high-speed railways being built . 
  pigs in the sky though ... 
   that are somewhat commercially available and not obscure or limited quanity yes , as far as i know . 
  we have many many more wine selection , of course . 
   also home-made brandy . 
  we have only two in slovenia really : union and la\u0161ko . 
  ` the most popular ' depends on where you live . 
  we should just all bow to the phoenicians . 
  we do the same with women 's surnames , although * only * when just the surname is mentioned . 
  it works for our native surnames to . 
  some people consider it sexist , but i neve even give a second thought to these words . 
  it 's very natural and it would sound very strange to not use them . 
  viscountess weymouth ( future marchioness of bath ) is half-nigerian . 
  admittedly not royalty , but caused quite a stir in the high society as far as i can gather !, 
  [ lady mary does not approve . 
  ] ( http://media1.giphy.com/media/qtfhxpirsoale/giphy.gif ), 
  yet your president is also prince of andorra !, 
  well that was his point . 
  those things do n't mean the same in english and french . 
  one of my favourite is * fr\u017emagati se * ( german * verschm\u00e4hen * ) . 
  if you look to your right , you 'll see spain . 
  if you look to your left , you 'll see spain . 
  i love your faux french placenames . 
  chester-le-street ? 
  oh , just * chesterly street * . 
  it 's actually * theydon boyz * . 
  belvoir castle ? 
  * beaver * , mate . 
  take a look at [ this map ] ( http://66.media.tumblr.com/6e67cd1880b0732db80c9028dca10eb2/tumblr_nmprlmotko1rasnq9o1_500.jpg ) showing literacy rates in the kingdom of yugoslavia in 1931 . 
  also note that half of slovenia is missing because it was part of italy between the two world wars . 
  * mr lastname * in formal situations * firstname * in informal situations, 
  group photos are ok . my main concerns are individuals taking selfies and asians spinning around trying to take in as much as possible . 
  of course they are n't banned . 
  but using it makes you look like an airhead . 
  i personally always give a disparaging look to people with selfie sticks . 
  zr\u0107e beach in croatia ... 
  in some parts of england , it means ' a sandwich ' . 
  hehe , i * love * cappuccino and drink it all the time . 
  over here , it can be ordered anytime . 
  when i was in italy a week ago , i ordered a cappuccino at about 4pm ... 
  the waitress gave me a look which said ` bloody foreigner ' , but she brought it nevertheless and it was delicious !!, 
  adding some : nvm = ne vem ( i do n't know ) [ some people render it as ` nwm ' ] rtm = rad ( a ) te imam ( i like you ), 
  to be noted : `` na zdravje '' is also used as `` cheers '' when drinking !, 
  the more traditional ( religious ) expression when someone sneezes is `` bog pomagaj '' ( god help ) and you should reply `` bog lonaj '' ( god pay ) . 
  go further east , go further east ... 
  this is called inflation . 
  even if we had kept the tolar , rest assured that a loaf of bread would cost 400 sit today . 
  almost ten years have passed . 
  yes , a pretty uneventful one : i was reading a news article yesterday where it was mentioned that someone was fined such and such amount ; and somebody observed in the comments the ridiculousness of it all . 
  oh yes , same here . 
  especially the official things never changed . 
  for example , the fine for disturbing public peace is 104,32 $ ( exactly 25.000,00 sit ) . 
  better fork out those cents !, 
  yeah , how do you feel about libya ? 
  painlessly and seamlessly . 
  starting 1 year before the transition , all prices were quoted in both currencies . 
  bank accounts and savings were converted to euro on 1 january 2007 . 
  from that day on , everything was in euro . 
  it was possible to use old cash for 14 days , but it was mainly done to get rid of coins etc. 
  we might have had at home .
