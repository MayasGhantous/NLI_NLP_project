  maintain eye contact for 5 seconds or more and you get called a pervert and a creep !, 
  beloved brethren , let us prey . 
  pray \u2260 prey , 
  roman catholic , definitely a believer , praying daily , attending church at least weekly . 
  i learnt this the hard way . 
  do n't pull us into the problems you have with croatia !, 
  i see , thank you . 
   you can not just leave the church tax w/o also leaving the church ... ... as many * gastarbeiter * have learnt the hard way . 
  wanting to avoid the church tax , they formally left the church in germany and , years later , when they returned to slovenia and wanted to act as godfathers/godmothers or to marry religiously , they found themselves unable to do so !, 
  just out of curiosity , have you ever lived outside the isle of man ? 
   british citizens who are connected with the channel islands and isle of man do not have the right to live in other european union countries ( except the republic of ireland ) unless they have connections through descent or residence in the united kingdom . 
  til . 
  yes ? 
  romantic ? 
  well the isle of man , jersey and guernsey are not a part of the uk . 
  it is an anomalous situation . 
  but isle of wight ( mentioned in a reply below ) is a part of england so i 'm sure they got to vote . 
   if you leave the church , you do n't pay the tax . 
  is n't it that if you are n't a member of a church , then you pay this tax nonetheless , but the money goes elsewhere ? 
  maybe i got it wrong when this system was explained to me some years ago . 
  maybe we can form an alliance to get back trieste ... ? 
  in addition to wearing shoes inside which has been heavily debated here , it 's also a faux pas to use the wrong kind of language . 
  in slovenian , we have different degrees of formality when declining verbs etc. 
  ( [ same as in many other languages ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t%e2%80%93v_distinction ) ) and it 's considered very rude to use the t-forms when you should be polite . 
  the inverse is also true , using the v-forms when not necessary can be very awkward . 
  yes , outdated or very dialectal now . 
  that 's a very good description . 
  one note , the ` last goodbye ' aka the wake that takes place a day before the funeral was commonly held at home , until some decades ago ( and still is in more rural areas ) . 
  friends and neighbours would come to the deceased 's home to pray and ` bless ' the corpse with the holy water . 
  just to add , there is a word * kum/kuma * in slovenian , a bit outdated now . 
  i believe it acutally means godfather/godmother , but nowadays we use * boter/botra * for this meaning . 
  native : slovenian fluent : english , french , croatian , serbian can get by with : german , russian , polish understand only : italian , spanish , all other slavic languages would like to learn : japanese , welsh , irish, 
  check , the link , it 's * globotschnigg *  so obviously non-slovenian . 
  there 's no roads from the uk to anywhere driving on the right so this is n't a problem . 
  but elsewhere in the world ( some asian countries ) they have different [ solutions ] ( http://mostepicstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/lotus-bridge-798x350.png ) . 
  ... and proud . 
   model , to je internet , naum se trudu . 
  yes , the ljubljana speech of today is quite different from what it was in the past , due to a sizeable immigration from other parts of the country and other ex-yu republics . 
  but sometimes , if you listen to old ladies chatting on the bus , you can still stumble upon a true representative of the days of yore ... music to my ears . 
  to je povedni naklon , indikativ . 
   \u0161tajerska sodrga  \u010duj lol . 
  oh , we 're a race ? 
  good to know . 
  i 'm an abomination to serbians ? 
  how come ? 
  da ti krava crkne , * mora\u0161 biti pa res slab kmet . 
  i say m\u0259\u0161 all the time and i 'm from ljubljana , born and bred . 
  i believe it 's the serbs who definitely pronounce * \u010d * and * \u0107 * with a marked difference ( same goes for * d\u017e * and * \u0111 * ) while for lots of croatian speakers , these pairs have merged . 
  dragi moj , to je srbska struktura .

  this . 
  ljubljan\u0161\u010dina is the most ` corrupted ' for lack of a better word . 
  and we all know how and why . 
  it suffices to watch * vesna * or * ne \u010dakaj na maj * to realise how the language of ljubljana has changed in 50 years . 
  if only i understood what you wrote here . 
  if anyone 's interested , [ here ] ( http://bos.zrc-sazu.si/c/dial/ponovne_sla/p/02_2_osnovna_karta_jpg.jpg ) is a map of the dialects of slovenian . 
  ljubljana is located on the border between upper carniolan ( purple ) and lower carniolan ( brown ) dialects and it is those two dialects that our standard language is based on . 
  the white area with brown dots in the south-east was inhabited by germans until 1941 . 
  when it was resettled with slovenians , they came from all over the country so there is a new dialect forming there , kind of a mix . 
  kajkavian rules !, 
  music to my ears . 
   yes , it is still defined as this because it has not changed much since its standardisation . 
  my point is , the way the ljubljana dialect is today is quite far away from the standard . 
  oh please . 
  this was true at the time our standard language was established ( almost 200 years ago ) . 
  the situation now is different . 
  probably it 's just hungary over-updating the data . 
  the map does n't seem right ... 
  there ca n't be no children missing in germany and italy for sure . 
  yes of course , it is how the system is designed and supposed to work . 
  however , governments have been known to use the money for other purposes !, 
   i saw the pain and suffering under your facade of a happy and joyfull person . 
  thank you . 
  i really needed that . 
   with taxation you take money from the wealthy people and give it to the poor people . 
  if only that were true . 
  no , no cursing and kicking . 
  he told me in a civilised manner that he does n't like me . 
  sorry to disappoint you , 
  quite possible . 
  those micro states are full of intricacies !, 
  well ... 
  person a does n't like person b. 
  there 's not much more to it . 
  right , forgot about that . 
  my neighbour does n't like me ( really ) . 
  i have n't moved away . 
  i do n't feel not-wanted . 
  my life is not difficult , frustrated and stressful . 
  i think it 's only he that has a problem , really . 
  gosh . 
  ( i 'm frustrated , you see . ), 
  he was rejected by some people , most definitely not by the whole german society . 
  we all deal with rejections in our life , and to move away just because some people do n't like you is not the best thing to do . 
  it shows your weakness and unability to cope with problems !, 
  i 'm sure the german person in question leads a perfectly normal and satisfying life in germany . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  he said he * is * a german citizen and he is also ethnically german on his mother 's side . 
  as far as i understand , he was told he 's not a ` real ' german because his dad is of turkish cypriot origin .
