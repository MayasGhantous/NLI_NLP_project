  i 'm 100 % sure that peope of the uk know how their country works and will all tell you exactly the same thing as we are trying to tell you here . 
   we call these entities here in the netherlands provinces , not countries . 
  they call these entities there in the uk countries , not provinces . 
  yes but gibraltar and british virgin islands are really dependent territories ; while dutch carribean islands are countries . 
  so just because * you * never heard an englishman say this , it means * only * scots say this ? 
  wow , what a logic !, 
  my dear henk . 
  ** you are in the wrong . 
  ** just this one time . 
  accept it and move on !, 
  home countries = england , scotland , wales , northern ireland home counties = berkshire , buckinghamshire , essex , hertfordshire , kent , surrey , sussex not the same thing !, 
  well i 'm not hiding , i can assure you . 
  i believe my ` qwerky ' ideas are shared by all 65 million people in the uk . 
  i actually understand how the uk works which could n't be said for some others participants in this fruitless discussion . 
  read this definition of a country :  a country is the territory controlled by or associated with a national government . 
  a country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state , as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division , ** or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics . 
  ** i 'm looking forward to visit the province of the netherlands sometime in the future . 
  i 'll make sure not to walk on cycle lanes . 
  i 'm not a us citizen , look at the flair . 
  well the subdivisions of the uk are called countries . 
  there you go , that 's polysemy for you , then . 
  yes , he would agree with you that the uk is a country . 
  he would also inform you that england is a country within this country . 
  oh , come on . 
  have you ever been to the uk at all ? 
  people from all over the uk are what you call ` nationalistic ' . 
  the pride for their own home nation is very much alive and there is a lot of teasing and in some cases even hatred going on between them . 
  you do realise , that life is not always rational , do you ? 
  especially when talking about british things . 
  we simply ca n't understand their ways with our continental minds . 
  it 's very similar . 
  the fact is , that it is * not true * that only inhabitants of scotland call their province a country . 
  so do inhabitants of england . 
  so do inhabitants of wales . 
  i can not therefore answer a question that stems from untrue facts . 
  try telling an englishman his country is a province , good luck with it hahaha , 
  yeah , right . 
  scotland gave up its external independence . 
  england gave up its external independence . 
  they formed the ** united ** kingdom . 
  so both of them have equal status within this kingdom . 
  they are not independent . 
  however , they are so different that they ca n't ever be called just * provinces * of the uk !, 
  for goodness ' sake , they even have their own respective taxes and laws and whatnot . 
  they even compete in international sports as different countries . 
  so there you go , love from a nationalist xoxo, 
  if scotland gave up its independence , so did england . 
  they both joined to form the uk . 
  the uk is a sovereign country ( if looked at from the outside ) , but inside it is really a country of countries . 
  you serious ? 
  scotland is a country within the uk . 
  england is a country within the uk . 
  wales is also a country within the uk . 
  it is only northern ireland where things are complicated , it is mostly described as a ` province ' . 
  all the four are known as ` home nations ' within the uk . 
  exactly !, 
  no country will give you a future , darling . 
  it depends on the country , some will exchange old cash indefinitely ( eg germany ) , some have already stopped and the old currency is worthless ( eg italy ) . 
  but it is always at the fixed rate that was determined for the changeover . 
  it just changed automatically on the 1st of january . 
  prices have already been shown in both currencies 6 months prior . 
  after the changeover date , you could use both currencies for 14 days ( but receive change in euro only ) , afterwards it was just euro . 
  prices continued to be shown in both currencies for another 6 months ( or 1 year , i do n't remember ) . 
  it was a completely seamless transition . 
  yes , every time you eat there you have to check-in with a card or mobile phone and i believe restaurants are then paid monthly by the government . 
  the map is in croatian btw :d so , the blue says * civilization * the text in black says * savage tribes * croatia : * savages who lie to themselves that they are n't savages * b&h : * physical workers savages * montenegro : * crime savages * serbia : * pink savages * ( pink is the name of their turbofolk tv channel ) macedonia : * [ ajvar ] ( http://media.uzkafu.rs/2013/10/domaci-ajvar.jpg ) savages * albania & kosovo : * drug cartel savages * romania & bulgaria : * savages who screwed the eu * slovenian sea : * the piran bay * croatian sea : * access to the piran bay *,

  i 'm 10000 % sure the dirt is * not * the sidewalk here . 
  there is simply no sidewalk on this picture . 
  yes , regular restaurants where everybody can go . 
  they have to apply for a sort of ` licence ' that gives them permission to accept students subsidies . 
  would n't be too sure about that . 
  basically i eat for free all the time except at weekends , i do n't think that 's possible at universities anywhere . 
  well , basically the government subsidizes students ' meals . 
  every month , all students get as many subsidized meals as there are working days in the month . 
  ( this is usually about 20 , depends if there are some holidays falling on weekdays ) you can use two meals in a day , but if you do this every day you will run out before the end of the month . 
  the subsidy currently stands at $ 2.63 and students pay what is over it . 
  for example , a restaurant might offer a meal at $ 3.00 so you only have to pay $ 0.37 - very simple !, 
  there are places that offer meals for $ 2.63 so you do n't have to pay anything ( stuff like pizza , sandwiches , burek , kebab , fast food in general ) . 
  the maximum you have to pay is $ 4.37 and there are tons of restaurants offering meals . 
  by law the student meal must be served with a soup , a salad , a piece of fruit and a dessert so even if you go for the free option you get a lot of food !, 
  do you know that university students get free meals here ? 
  ( not all of them are * really * free , but some of them are ! ), 
  having visited all of them bar one , i 'm inclined to agree ... 
  we like to think that we 're so . 
  much . 
  better . 
  than other ex-yugoslavian countries . 
  see above . 
  yes it works on my laptop of course . 
  but i have a windowsphone and it uses bing by default which i dislike !, 
  yes of course , but it does n't work on my mobile , 
  not at all impossible btw . 
  if the op cold prove that his grandparents and parent were also entitled to italian citizenship , they may well have a claim . 
  it redirects to google.si for me . 
  but anyway , i always type . si because it 's quicker ,
