  dressed as if going on a safari . 
  that horrible sand colour . 
  [ take a look at this map . 
  ] ( http://67.media.tumblr.com/12660794ef335086b09648bff8792da8/tumblr_ni5felbcmn1rasnq9o1_1280.png ) it 's creepy how the old borders transpire . 
  i always thought [ this thing ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/armoiries_r%c3%a9publique_fran%c3%a7aise.svg ) was your official symbol . 
  it 's on your passports !, 
  official ( in our [ coat of arms ] ( http://www.vlada.si/fileadmin/dokumenti/slovenija_doc/grb-barvni.png ) ) is [ mt triglav ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/triglav.jpg ) unofficial symbols include [ linden leaf ] ( http://www.gibanje-ops.com/images/stories/lipov%20list%20svetel.jpg ) and [ carnation ] ( http://www.infobiro.si/media/slikeit/novice/nagelj.jpg ), 
  well there are competitions between faculties ( i know that the faculty of arts where i study has a football , volleyball and basketball team , among others ) , but this is strictly on an informal basis , for fun ... and frequented by very few students actually . 
  well , hailing the hate for something as one 's civic duty is equivalent to inciting hatred for it , in my opinion . 
  others may disagree , of course . 
  you eat cutlery ? 
  wait ... first digest , then spread ? 
  of course not , but saying it is the duty of a citizen to hate something ... 
  hate speech in slovenia is illegal , but somehow it is n't illegal for * some * people . 
  a few years ago , a very well known author said that to hate the catholic church was her civic duty . 
  there was some uproar , but somehow the judges ( or whoever decide on this matter ) managed to show that this was n't hate speech . 
  personally , i do n't eat breakfast . 
  but usually it 's m\u00fcsli with milk , or bread and something to put on it ( butter/jam for example ) ; drinks include coffee or cocoa . 
  when i was a kid , my grandma used to prepare [ \u017eganci ] ( http://www.lokalec.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ajdovi-zganci-na-selniski-trznici-5.jpg ) with milk for breakfast , it was the most yummy thing ever . 
  i think we reached 38 \u00b0 c last year . 
  it was hell . 
  i 'm afraid that this is how countries work . 
  they just shuffle debt around . 
  there is , in reality , no money that could ever repay the debts . 
  true that . 
  not really , when 22 have already joined . 
  many ? 
  exactly four . 
  and about village parties ... 
  they 're called `` veselica '' ( could be translated along the lines of `` a happy occasion '' ) and , as liliputput mentioned , are very popular - everybody comes to dance to some nice and loud traditional music ( which all pretend to hate otherwise ) . 
  and there is lots of grilled meat . 
  lots . 
  [ picture ] ( http://www.pgd-sostro.si/images/novice/97.jpg ), 
  yes , mlajs are great !, 
   they are usually erected in pairs for occasions like marriage , with a board saying `` long live bride & groom '' ( or similar ) hung between them . 
  [ like this ] ( http://www.domzalec.si/modules/aktualno/uploads/slike_2014_mobi_973-2.jpg ), 
  also `` rovtar '' - inhabitant of hilly remote regions . 
  i do n't think so . 
  schengen is just an agreement for the free movement of people * without border checks * . 
  my point exactly . 
  i do n't think that , in europe , citizenship has a lot to do with how someone identifies or what values someone holds . 
  to have citizenship usually means to be able to vote in that country 's election and to have the right to live there . 
  the latter can also be true for residents ( not necessarily citizens ) . 
  there are millions of people who , due to historical circumstances , do n't possess the citizenship of the country which is ( now ) the ` main ' country of their nation . 
  well , i myself never actually show my id to vote , because i 'm from a small village and everybody knows each other . 
  therefore our elections operate on a british-like system . 
  ( i can now be hanged for treason . ), 
  on a more serious note , in my whole life i have n't actually been asked to show my id except when strictly necessary ( border control , in the bank etc. ), 
  that being said , i never do anything illegal ( at least in public , lol ) so i never attract the cops ' attention . 
  it is not like they * really * demand ids from members of the public at random . 
  i was just reading a discussion on compulsory id cards at another forum , and there was a brit telling of his eastern european friend being completely shocked at the notion that uk functions perfectly fine without them . 
  i imagine our friend here suffers from the same shock , quite acute i might add . 
  as you have repeatedly pointed out , there are fundamental differences in our respective understanding of civil liberties and legal systems , but preaching to the converted is to no avail . 
   based on your username , i suppose you are from wales ? 
  i 'm actually moving there in september . 
  ca n't wait to escape our id-compulsory oppression and join you in abusing the teenagers ' votes !, 
  i think we do . 
  at least everybody was dreaming of our country becoming ' a secon switzerland ' upon gaining independence . 
   youre an idiot . 
  i absolutely do n't agree . 
  i absolutely agree . 
  i was under the impression that terrorists ussually breed themselves . 
  ` legitemize ' is not a word . 
  and even if it were , * they just do n't do it in the uk * . 
  got it ? 
  their country , their rules . 
  seems to work perfectly . 
  i hope you are now convinced never to come to slovenia , where police shoot you the minute you ca n't produce your uk id card . 
  / s i 'm thouroughly enjoying this thread , bring more popcorn !, 
  this . 
  yeah , because when your mother dies , your first thought is oh it 's election day today , must abuse her vote . 
  just do n't bother with this guy please . 
  he spews forth filth all over reddit . 
  i have a national id card ( which i always carry ) - this is needed all the time , a driver 's licence - i use it only if there is road control , and a student id card - i use it daily to claim student discounts . 
  i also have a passport but it 's usually at home ( i only needed it once so far , for visiting the us ) . 
  well maybe the * way of writing them * looks slavic . 
  but the majority of eureopan languages have those sounds , just written in their own ways . 
  we also do n't have \u0106 .  these two sounds do n't exist in our language . 
  \u0110 is how croatian and serbian write the polish sound d\u0179 ... 
  it 's a big mix up , every language having some special letters of their own , even if they share some of the sounds ...  best to go on youtube and listen to recordings of the polish alphabet i think . 
  or ` plea ** s ** ure ' . 
  in polish , there are three degrees of ` hissy ' sounds : ** c ** ( pronounced * ts * )  ** \u0107 ** ( pronounced ` soft ' * ch * )  ** cz ** ( pronounced ` hard ' * ch * ) ** dz ** ( as in english )  ** d\u017a ** ( pronounced ` soft ' * j * )  ** d\u017c ** ( pronounced ` hard ' * j * ) ** s ** ( as in english )  ** \u015b ** ( pronounced ` soft ' * sh * )  ** sz ** ( pronounced ` hard ' * sh * ) ** z ** ( as in english )  ** \u017a ** ( pronounced ` soft ' * zh * )  ** \u017c ** ( pronounced ` hard ' * zh * ) as you can see , there is a pattern of voiced/devoiced pairs and increasing level of ` hissiness ' . 
  moreover , ** rz ** is also pronounced as ** \u017c ** . 
  and many other things  i hope this clears things a bit !, 
  i think \u017c is best described as the sound in ` televi ** s ** ion ' . 
  i mean , not feeling strongly as in having violent outbursts or wishes to invade ... 
  it is more of a romantic feeling for lost lands , 
  oh yes , the signs troubles ... 
  this is not a bad idea at all !, 
   i doubt you 'd want us though, 
  of course , the numbers can not be really compared . 
  but still , people feel very strongly about the loss of carinthia ( the famous plebiscite of 1920 ) and there is a nostalgic yearning for trieste and other parts of ` venetian slovenia ' as it is called . 
  yes you 're right of course . 
  the cities were always majority german , and this goes for the likes of maribor ( marburg ) , ptuj ( pettau ) and celje ( cilli ) too . 
  nowadays not a german in sight . 
  the number of slovene speakers in austria * is * dwindling , but they are still there though !, 
  well we have the same thing here . 
  the shape of slovenia is such that on all maps , there are also areas of austria , italy and hungary that are home to slovenian minority . 
  people here ( older generation at least ) still think of trieste or klagenfurt as ` ours ' for example . 
  one of the best cartoons .
