  my childhood 's tv was made entirely of czech cartoons . 
  in slovenia too . 
  they actually get killed by they unpreparedness ( it happened just two weeks ago , again ) . 
  [ they 're delicious in lithuania ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=cepelinai&amp;rls=com.microsoft:sl-si:ie-address&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj3svm7hozoahub1hqkhvziaf8q_auiccgb&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=754 ), 
  ouch ... 
  that 's exactly how we feel about switzerland too . 
  they 're practically gods . 
  slovenia : postage stamp of course !, 
  :d cue long discussion . 
  ** austria : ** we look up to them . 
  everything 's better on their side of the alps . 
  they produce quality items . 
  anything austrian/german = good . 
  nickname : * \u0160vabi * ( also good for the germans ) ** italy : ** we look down on them . 
  they 're loud , impatient and too emotional . 
  they drive like crazy . 
  anything made in italy will break down about 2 hours after you buy it . 
  nickname : * lahi * , * makaronarji * ** croatia : ** oh , where do i begin . 
  `` hrvat je tat '' = `` a croat is a thief '' . 
  regardless , about 99 % of us spend our summer vacation at their seaside which is the best in the world . 
  nickname : * hr\u010dki * ( hamsters ) , because hr = croatia . 
  ** hungary : ** nobody understands them . 
  we just acknowledge their existence . 
  youre right haha, 
  oh i never realised i live in transylvania , thanks for the heads up !, 
  of course they did . 
  so they can ignore the outcome of any referendum . 
  oh , a moment ago it was all about the will of the people . 
  it was the will of 14 % of people 13 years ago , yes . 
  all kind of chinese and other asian cuisines . 
  i mean , i * love * it , but i 'm sure it 's completely different from the real food in china etc. 
  conversely , i believe our pizzas are waaaay better than in italy . 
  i 'm quite happy with the status quo . 
  that 's because the european union referendum act 2015 made no provision for the result to be legally binding on the government or on any future government . 
  may i draw your attention to the similarly non legally binding referenda that took place in slovenia ( * posvetovalni referendumi * ) : about privatisation of railways ( 2003 ) , about entry to the eu & nato ( 2003 ) , about municipalities ( 2006 ) , about regions ( 2008 ) . 
  may i also draw your attention to the legally binding referendum in 2003 where the people decided that stores should not be open on sundays . 
  have you seen anyone respect the outcome of this referendum ? 
  yeah , me neither . 
  i 'm the third . 
  no chip-and-pin cards , but unsecure magnetic stripes no vat , but complicated sales taxes no free university education no free healthcare, 
  slovenians have traditionally been catholics . 
  according to the latest census ( 2002 ) : - 57.8 % catholic christians - 2.3 % orthodox christians - 2.4 % muslims - 0.8 % protestant christians - 0.2 % other religions there was an option on the census not to declare your faith , used by 15.7 % of population . 
  10.2 % stated they were not religious . 
  today , religion is still important , but more in the countryside and smaller towns than in bigger cities . 
  there is a student-family-friendly part of the campus in ljubljana . 
  i think the flats are bigger and more appropriate for students with children , there is also a kindergarten and a pediatrician nearby . 
  also talk to your bank and tell them you 're going abroad . 
  i think some of the banks automatically refuse any transaction originating in another country as a safety measure . 
  i deal with american customers paying with their cards daily . 
  it is extremely varied . 
  some cards do n't have a chip . 
  i swipe them and customers sign . 
  others do have a chip . 
  i insert them and the machine says : chip not known , use swipe . 
  i then swipe them and the machine says : use chip !!, 
  then i insert them again and this time it works . 
  customers sign . 
  there are also americans who proudly tell me ( before paying ) that their card is chip-and-pin . 
  the problem is , they all seem to forget their pin and end up paying cash . 
  my previous issue of mastercard was chip and signature , so it worked just swipe in slovenian vending machines . 
  however , it did n't work abroad . 
  now i have chip and pin and it works everywhere , although somewhere i still have to sign insted of putting in my pin . 
  * anyway * , the dutch are notorious for not liking to deal with foreign-issued cards at all ( no matter the method ) - maybe that 's the problem !, 
  i see and i perfectly understand . 
  but somehow we ca n't change our native language ... 
  it 's a * fait accompli * so to speak . 
  sorry but ethnicity does n't necessarily correspond to your native language . 
  there are millions of irishmen whose native language is english for example . 
  none of them is ethnically english though . 
  there is , especially between ulster gaelic and scottish ( geographical proximity ) . 
  both languages form a kind of dialectal continuum i think . 
  quite a lot . 
  opening a can of worms here ... 
  thanks !, 
  i actually know where falkirk is , having passed through it on the train once or twice  i just could n't match * focurc * with any of the places i know in scotland . 
  now it makes sense . 
  amazing . 
  where in scotland is focurc lanwurt spoken ? 
  general interest in languages & linguistics , living in europe and needing to communicate with other nations , speaking a language with only 2 million speakers ... 
  it gets easier with each new language really . 
  i 've just realised the immense smiley-face potential of this \u00fe letter of yours !!!, 
  poor poor england . 
  i 'm sure she 'll rise again , free of the eu chains !, 
  like between italian and russian . 
  very well , my honourable and learned friend !, 
  well written portuguese is not a problem . 
  but spoken !, 
  errrr ... 
  right . 
  but in fact , korean is a language isolate which means there is * no * other language related to it . 
  japanese is also close to being an isolate , but there are some local languages which differ enough from it that they are classified as separate languages . 
  together , with japanese , they form a small group of languages , called japonic . 
  pedant mode off . 
  what about the london assembly ? 
  it seems to have similar powers to those of the welsh , northern irish and scottish devolved governments , thereby giving london more control over its affairs than other parts of england . 
  to be fair , japanese is pretty much unrelated to * any * language . 
  seems a bit ridiculous !, 
  at least the flemish region and the flemish community have merged . 
  native : slovenian fluent : english , french reasonably well : croatian/serbian , russian , german understand only : italian , spanish i am very open to languages so i 'd be happy to move anywhere , 
  slovenia is a unitary state .
