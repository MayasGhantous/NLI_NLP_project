   whose population is mostly muslim they are mostly albanian , that 's the big issue . 
  what do you call a woman who has never cleaned the snow ? 
  nikol ( i ) = never kidati = to clean snow, 
  slovenski zet - slovenian son-in-law !, 
  utopiti ( koga ) v \u017elici vode - to drown ( somebody ) in a spoon of water priti na zeleno vejo - to come onto a green tree-branch, 
   i feel no connection with macedonia and bulgaria . 
  i mean we shared a country with fyrom for 70 years but that 's about it . 
  there 's no cultural ties whatsoever . 
  and especially not with bulgaria . 
  i do n't think i 'd feel any cultural connection with bosnians , serbians and montenegrins either if it wasnt for their immigrants and therefore their popular media constantly present here . 
  going to bosnia feels a lot more foreign to me than going to czech r. for example . 
  i agree . 
  apart from linguistic connections , slovenians had nothing to do with other south slavs except in the period from 1918 to 1991 . 
  going to bosnia was an eye-opener . 
  felt like turkey or something , yet i understood everything . 
  we 've had euros for 10 years now . 
  sometimes people complain about how everything was cheaper in the time of [ tolars ] ( http://mayimbe.blog.siol.net/files/2010/05/tolarji-3.jpg ) but it 's just nostalgic nonsense in my opinion - they conveniently forget about inflation etc. 
  my grandma still talks about dinars sometimes ( the yugoslav currency ) . 
  she seemingly did n't notice tolars at all . 
  very understandable . 
  but then i am semi-fluent in polish , russian and croatian/serbian , so i do n't know how much of it i understand because of it . 
  clubs , dating , friends do n't have anything to do with the university - they are the social part of the student life , completely detached from any official university business . 
  everyone grows weary of the university , in my ( and lots of my friends ' ) experience . 
  when you finish , you 're just glad it 's over . 
  of course you are happy to have learnt so many things , but it 's * your * achievement , no need to glorify the institution ( and donate money to them ? 
  - this one had me like wtf ?? ), 
  the day you graduate is usually the day of your greatest relief because you wo n't have to set foot in that institution you 've come to hate , * ever again * . 
  well there is always a bunch of strange people , but they withdraw their candidatures sooner or later so they do n't actually appear on the ballot . 
  in that sense , you are right, 
  yeah , in slovenia , the crazy candidates are more prevalent at the presidential elections . 
  i ca n't recall any un-seriousness at the parliamentary level . 
  well of course , i mentioned these ijekavci later in my post , 
  i agree . 
  been to sarajevo , had tastebuds blown . 
  well , being a modern nomad is not a viable option in europe . 
  you will cross international borders all the time , have you thought about all the visas you will need ( especially thinking about russia here ) - bear in mind some countries will not let stateless people in for fear they will remain there - on top of that what about insurance , car registration , paying taxes , having a bank account , complying with immigration rules , dealing with different currencies ... you are very welcome to come to europe on normal terms , but you will have to pick a country and research your opportunities to immigrate legally . 
  where there 's a will , there 's a way . 
  but if you want to willingly pursue statelessness in order to somehow get around the rules , it will eventually backfire straight in your face . 
  do n't lose hope because of the political situation at the moment . 
  we all know it changes every so many years and it would be incredibly silly to put your life in jeopardy for this reason . 
  have you been to all of the us states ? 
  have you been to europe ? 
  i suggest you come here for a month and see how it 's * really * like . 
  similar here . 
  when someone says * burek * i think of the cheese one . 
  * mesni burek * is the one in the picture . 
   i want wide , open spaces to travel to . 
  i want to live in different places every so often . 
  the us seems a perfect place for both of these requirements ... 
  it 's a big mess , but yeah , it 's not that hard if you know where to look . 
  cyrillic script = definitely serbian latin script = can be any of them but : if you see a lot of `` je '' and `` ije '' combinations , then it 's croatian/bosnian , but if there is `` e '' in the same places , then it 's serbian . 
  serbian also prefers the `` da + present tense '' construction to the infinitive used in croatian/bosnian . 
  to distinguish croatian from bosnian you should look for turcisms and arabic words which mark bosnian , or for stupidly-sounding ultra-slavic neologisms which mark croatian . 
  montenegrin is a young thing ( officially existing since 2007 ) and it really came to the fore because of the country 's newly-gained independence . 
  they use `` je '' / `` ije '' as in croatia/bosnia , but also use the cyrillic script quite often . 
  serbian language used by serbs in bosnia also uses `` je '' / `` ije '' but is strictly cyrillic in script . 
  so if you have to distinguish montenegrin from serbian in bosnia , you look for the negative forms of the verb `` to be '' which are `` nijesam , nijesi '' etc. 
  in montenegrin , but `` nisam , nisi '' etc. 
  in all other concerned languages . 
  of course , all of this only applies to \u0160tokavian dialects . 
  in croatia , there are also \u010cakavian and kajkavian dialects which are basically another languages , with much much more differences from \u0160tokavian than all four `` official '' forms have amongst them . 
  when it comes to listening , i can easily distinguish serbian ( broad , laid-back , almost lazy-sounding ) from bosnian ( very melodic , strictly uses pitch accent and post-stress lengths ) from croatian ( somewhat neutral ) . 
  i am not sure about montenegrin because we do n't really have a lot of contact . 
  i guess you just have to pay attention to the `` nijesam '' forms mentioned above . 
  kajkavian croatian sounds almost the same as slovenian - very nice to listen to . 
  \u010cakavian is strange , but still recognisable . 
  this reply is really an overkill , is n't it ? 
  but here you go , since you asked ... , 
   cantonese , mandarin which are , in fact , two different languages and totally mutually unintelligible . 
  well of course it does . 
  the words are ancient cousins , 
  it certainly can be done , here is mike gogulski 's [ blog ] ( http://www.nostate.com ) - he did exactly what you are describing . 
  honestly though , please do n't get any ideas . 
  have you ever been outside the us ? 
  to me , hungarian sounds like robotic speech . 
  all the syllables seem to get an equal stress and it ends up in endless machine-gun like utterances . 
  it is also interesting how you do n't have a normal `` a '' sound . 
  your '' \u00e1 '' is far too much open whilst your `` a '' is far too much close . 
   ( i took hungarian class for half a year , was fun ), 
  username checks out :d, 
  oh yes , it 's everywhere . 
   kotimasten kielten keskus which of these words means finland ? 
  is n't it suomi ? 
  russian * \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044f\u043d\u0438\u043d * ( krest ` yanin ) = a peasant slovenian * kristjan * = a christian bulgarian * \u043a\u043c\u0435\u0442 * ( kmet ) = a mayor slovenian * kmet * = a peasant polish * podatek * = a tax slovenian * podatek * = a piece of data polish * dru\u017cyna * = a team slovenian * dru\u017eina * = a family, 
  when i first tried lapsang souchong , my first thought was `` it tastes like ri\u010det '' . 
  i would n't call greece eastern europe ... 
  a new definition of balkans to include [ brandenburg and saxony ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorben ) . 
   after voting , you get a stamp in your passport . 
  brilliant idea !, 
  does that mean everyone in latvia has passports ? 
  some may only have id cards ... 
  anyway , i suppose you do n't have constituencies or specific seats you 're voting for ( as in the uk for instance ) and the whole country just counts all the votes together ? 
  no wasted votes etc , seems like a very good system . 
  so the voting stations have some kind of a central system to check who has already voted ? 
  in slovenia , you get assigned to your local station ; however if you know you will be in some other place on the voting day , you can apply to vote in that other place . 
  but still they assign you a specific voting station in another place ( and this is a separate station for non-locals ) . 
  no , this is not the usa where you can move from kansas to vermont overnight ... moving to a different country involves looots of research , documentation , logistics etc. 
  and it probably takes at least 6 months of preparations . 
  therefore i think nobody chooses to move to another country just because the politics in any given month ( or year ) . 
  personally , i would never move to france , although i am fluent in french and know quite a lot about their culture and values .
