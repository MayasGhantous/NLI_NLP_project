  whenever i visited france , i just did n't like the thought of establishing myself there . 
   no pre-assigned voting stations how does that work ? 
  $ 1000 is called `` jur '' , $ 5000 is `` pet ( 5 ) jurjev '' etc. 
  `` jur '' is an abbreviation of the name jurij ( george ) . 
  in the times of [ the kingdom of slovenes , croats and serbs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_yugoslavia ) , the [ 1000 dinar banknote ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/1000-dinara-1920.jpg ) had a picture of st george fighting the dragon on it . 
  the name stuck and survived three currencies  in yugoslavia , other banknotes also had nicknames : [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/10-dinara-1965.jpg ) was called `` kova\u010d '' ( blacksmith ) and i have heard my older relatives refer to [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/yud_1000_1981_obverse.jpg ) as '' \u017eito \u017eanje '' ( ( she ) is harvesting wheat ) . 
  oh yes , of course . 
  and `` majster '' !, 
  stari ( old one ), 
  i 've only been to nyc . 
  jfk airport seemed old and tired . 
  the subway is surprisingly badly signposted ; stations are hot as hell , trains are cold as freezers . 
  the whole system functions very well even though it looks ( and sounds ) so run-down . 
  sidewalks were not a problem . 
  i could walk wherever i wanted and there are loads of pedestrianised areas ( squares , parks etc ) i liked the square grid of roads . 
  very easy for orientation . 
   letters \u0462 , \u0472 and \u0406 were excluded from the alphabet . 
  you forgot the ( in ) famous \u0474 \u2192 \u0418 !, 
  although ( according to wikipedia ) , they also forgot to mention it in the 1918 reform because it was only used in one word ( \u043c\u0475\u0440\u043e ) . 
   `` pom\u00f3dz '' was it really spelt like that ? 
  because it has no foundation in etymology . 
  the pre-1945 forms are basically old church slavonic . 
  nice !, 
  oh yes , found the equivalent of $ 2k stashed behind the wardrobe . 
   you can exchange paper notes indefinitely , but the exchange of coins finished in 2016 . 
  always . 
  has anyone ever guessed correctly ? 
  never . 
  surely you mean `` martyr '' city , not mortar, 
   xhendremael this one looks like it 's on the eastern adriatic coast , somewhere between durr\u00ebs and vlor\u00eb ... 
  surely / \u026ca\u02c8n\u025b\u026ci / . 
  i visited one month ago . 
  the european woman gets to claim money from you , nothing else . 
   i need to study in europe ( tuition-free , and expected scholarships to cover r&b ) and i should get a work visa with a job offer sometime . 
  you probably also expect a red carpet , and the pope to greet you personally . 
  yes , i was told that nem\u0161ka vas ( near ribnica ) was the last completely slovenian-speaking village , while slovenska vas ( near ko\u010devje ) down the road was the first completely german-speaking village ; which makes for an interesting case !, 
  * slovenian : native * english and french : fluent * croatian/serbian/bosnian : perfect understanding , not-so-perfect speaking * polish and russian : intermediate * german : had it in school ... could get by * welsh and japanese : beginner level * italian and spanish : basic understanding only, 
  when a baby is born , it gets the citizenships of the parents , simple as that . 
  we do n't do jus solis over here , that 's more of an american peculiarity . 
  under no circumstances will you be able to claim citizenship by having a child with a foreign woman . 
   slovenian mapleton : ddd i think we have to mention slovenska bistrica , slovenske konjice , slovenj gradec , slovenja vas . 
  we had non-obligatory english in years 3 and 4 ( ages 8-9 ) of elementary school , and then obligatory english for the rest of the elementary school ( 4 years ) . 
  it was also mandatory in high school ( 4 years ) . 
  in the last three years of elementary school , we had 3 years of non-obligatory german ; and it was obligatory in high school ( 4 years ) . 
  this was just a thing with my high school - it is perfectly possible to finish your education with english only ( and even that not all the way through the high school , just a year or two ) . 
  i finished high school in 2010 and i 'm sure things have changed a bit now ... 
  somewhere in new england , definitely . 
  the envy . 
  the sheer envy . 
  `` my neighbour will * not * be better than me . '', 
  we like to tell foreigners about this personality trait into which every slovenian is apparently born . 
  while emphasising to everyone how bad it is , i think we secretly like to be like that . 
  now is a perfect time to be alive . 
   sometimes , i wish i was born around 1910 so i could experience all the cool things of the 20th century ( talking about music , arts , culture , historical events , changes in society ... ) but then i remember all the horrible wars , persecutions and whatnot - and then i 'm thankful to be alive now !, 
  well , slovenia also borders the atlantic , if we stretch facts a bit . 
   but i do n't know what you mean by diverse ethnic make up ? 
  we are a quite not-diverse society in terms of ethnicity . 
  born 1992 , yes i was . 
  maybe 4 or 5 times in my entire childhood , always deserved ( and i knew it ) . 
  jedrt is really badass . 
  sadly , parents nowadays probably do n't have the courage to give their child a name like this ( all the while having no problems naming them lui , ria , tye , or zfsgljk ) . 
  i personally like male names ending on - e ( lojze , an\u017ee , polde , tone , france ... ) and would actually consider giving them to my future kids !, 
  something small , irrelevant but beautiful . 
  the so-called [ miracle of kobarid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_caporetto ) . 
  ** everything ** is in ljubljana . 
  yes , i vote wherever i 'm eligible ( slovenia and the uk ) . 
  most beautiful : ljubljana ( biased !, 
  in northern ireland , voter ids have been obligatory for quite some time . 
  people who do n't have any of the appropriate id can get an electoral identity card , free of charge . 
  i do n't see an issue if such a system were to be adopted in great britain as well . 
  what is more surprising is the fact that , in great britain , you can vote with absolutely no id or any other documentation . 
  you can literally go to the polling station , tell them your neighbour 's name and address and vote in his name . 
  `` zadovoljen '' means `` satisfied '' or `` sexually satisfied '' , depending on where you put the stress . 
  not really opposite meanings though . 
  monday . 
  although its name ( ponedeljek ) means `` after-sunday '' which somehow suggests sunday should be the first . 
  maybe it was so in the past . 
  yes , we have two official bilingual areas in slovenia : slovenian/italian in the southwest and slovenian/hungarian in the northeast . 
  all the signs are bilingual in these areas , with slovenian first . 
  we also have bilingual signs for places outside slovenia which have slovenian names . 
  these are listed first , followed by the name in the place 's official language . 
  there is also a marvellous trilingual sign in the southwest saying pulj/pula/pola ( slovenian/croatian/italian ) . 
  to be fair , most people in slovenia are aware that scotland is not england ( but usually fail at accurately describing the incredible geo-political mess that is the uk ) , whilst completely ignoring wales . 
  [ gorica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gorizia ) in italy . ^ / s, 
  in theory you do n't need the invite letter , only your id . 
  in practice , you often do n't need anything . 
  but you always have to sign your name on the register . 
  - they have gone apart . 
  - they have gone apart . 
  - she put him on the shoe . 
  - she gave him a little basket . 
  ( = she refused him ), 
  because nj and lj and d\u017e are single sounds . 
  `` njegov '' and `` injekcija '' sound different - and in latin alphabet there is no distinction . 
  but in cyrillic one is spelt \u045a\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0432 and the other \u0438\u043d\u0458\u0435\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 . 
  it certainly was an exciting time browsing the old books etc. , but ultimately everybody was a farmer , had the same surname ( obviously ) , same first name ( happened more often than you 'd imagine ) and lived in the area since time immemorial . 
  yeah , on my father 's side we traced it to around 1640s if i remember correctly . 
  nothing exciting at all . 
  there is no eu passport . 
  every country issues its own passports to its own citizens according to its own rules .
