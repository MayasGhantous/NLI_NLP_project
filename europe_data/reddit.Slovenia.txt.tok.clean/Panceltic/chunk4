  you should ask on the subreddit of the country whose citizenship you hold . 
  \u0411\u0443\u0445\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0442\u0435\u0440 is also a nice one . 
  europe is a geographical term , muslim is a religious term . 
  albania fits both descriptions . 
  same here . 
  king alexander i of yugoslavia is viewed as the bad guy . 
  the feelings are warmer towards franz joseph , who was the * emperor * in the good ole days . 
  looks gorgeous , but i hope they wo n't forget to change the lorem ipsum , 
  in slovenia , it 's usually free to withdraw money from your bank 's atm only . 
  it is your bank that charges you if you withdraw somewhere else . 
  some banks offer free withdrawals throughout europe ( ! ), 
  though . 
  tiha nedelja ( quiet sunday ) ( the sunday before palm sunday ) veliki teden ( great week ) cvetna nedelja ( flower sunday ) veliki \u010detrtek ( great thursday ) veliki petek ( great friday ) velika sobota ( great saturday ) velika no\u010d ( easter , literally great night ) or velikono\u010dna nedelja ( easter sunday ) velikono\u010dni ponedeljek ( easter monday ) bela nedelja ( white sunday ) ( the sunday after easter ), 
  our passports do n't have any request such as you mention . 
  but they do include the holder 's [ em\u0160o identification number ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unique_master_citizen_number ) which i believe is not the norm in other countries . 
  on the next page , there is a page where your permanent address is printed . 
  on that page , here are three identical spaces intended for the address so you could simply get a new one imprinted in your passport when you move . 
  yep . 
   in slovenian , it also sounds a bit weird , but there are cases when it is actually used , like for example in fairy tales , when the sun ( * sonce * ) speaks . 
  so it has to use the neuter gender . 
  yeah , i was just trying to play on the neuter gender :d like e.g. 
  they do in all slavic languages , except in the present tense ( or in the future tense of perfective verbs ) . 
  what about `` zjeba\u0142om '' ? 
  you can post a letter by sticking an appropriate stamp to it and putting it into a postbox ( they are yellow ) , or over the counter at the post office . 
  the price is the same . 
  postage for a standard letter currently costs $ 0.37 ( domestic ) / $ 1.00 ( international ) . 
  postage for a standard postcard is currently $ 0.45 ( domestic ) / $ 1.00 ( international ) . 
  i genuinely have no idea why a postcard costs more than a letter !, 
  for packages , you have to go to the post office where they weigh it and tell you the price . 
  lots of services can be added which increase the price ( registered mail , signature on delivery , airmail for international letters etc. ), 
  letters are received in the mailbox . 
  houses usually have it next to the front door , or on the fence next to the street . 
  in apartment buildings , there is usually a big block of mailboxes in the entrance hall . 
  for all items than do n't fit into your mailbox or require a signature , the postman will ring your bell . 
  if you 're not in he will leave a small piece of paper with details how to get your item ( usually by going to the post office the next day ) . 
  carinthian slovenian is very easy to recognise . 
  for example , they use the guttural ( ` german ' ) r , whereas in slovenia we roll our r 's . 
  they also use words specific to austria , for example ` ljudska \u0161ola ' ( volksschule ) which always cracks me up because it sounds soooo 1890s . 
  i guess [ krk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krk ) in croatia , spent many nice summers there . 
  honourable mention to [ bled island ] ( https://s.inyourpocket.com/gallery/108186.jpg ) which i think is the only island in slovenia . 
  [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mooeayms8aa ), 
  oh come on !, 
   myanmar , the long-forgotten lithuanian colony . 
  and , of course , the dandelion , all the dandelion for the yummy salad !, 
  of the european flags , the uk 's flag ( [ the union jack ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/flag_of_the_united_kingdom.svg/1280px-flag_of_the_united_kingdom.svg.png ) ) has the most striking design in my opinion , and is very aesthetically pleasing . 
  you will have to re-check your luggage in munich because you will have two separate tickets , which means exiting the passport control area and thus needing a new visa . 
  i think your option is to buy a new direct ticket from croatia to canada ; or cancelling the croatia part of your trip . 
  bizarrely , this works in slovenian as well : \u010clovek je , kar je . 
  the first `` je '' is pronounced [ j\u025b ] and means `` is '' , the second is pronounced [ je ] and means `` eats '' . 
  modern name / traditional name januar / prosinec ( begging , praying ) februar / sve\u010dan ( candles ? ), 
  marec / su\u0161ec ( the dry one ) april / mali traven ( little grass ) maj / veliki traven ( great grass ) junij / ro\u017enik ( flowers ) julij / mali srpan ( little sickle ) avgust / veliki srpan ( great sickle ) september / kimavec ( nodding ) oktober / vinotok ( wine flowing ) november / listopad ( leaves falling ) december / gruden ( ? ), 
  in scotland , yes . 
  wow , sorbs are great !, 
  we too have gorgeous painted eggs , and the improvised cannons made out of milk cans were still a thing about 30 years ago . 
  i 'm sure you can go back no problems . 
  the serbian authorities at the border will just smack a huge ` void ' stamp over the kosovo stamps . 
  mayor *, 
  i witnessed an ice-cream machine violently break down . 
  i ordered a mcflurry and when the employee started to make it , the whole thing emitted a loud bang and suddenly there was ice-cream everywhere behind the counter . 
  needless to say , i did not get my mcflurry . 
  i thought about swing music first . 
  11/10 , always excited . 
  of course not . 
  it feels very wrong . 
  in winter i usually wear warm slippers , otherwise socks only ( or barefoot in summer ) . 
  in slovenia , the [ minimum wage ] ( http://www.mddsz.gov.si/si/delovna_podrocja/delovna_razmerja_in_pravice_iz_dela/socialno_partnerstvo/minimalna_placa/ ) is currently $ 790.73 / month ( we always discuss wages in monthly terms ) . 
  this equates about $ 4.55 / hour . 
  anyone working full-time ( 40 hours/week ) gets at least the minimum wage , with those working part-time getting the appropriate proportion . 
  however , this is gross figure . 
  when all the taxes and other contributions are deducted , the net wage actually paid to your account ( according to [ this calculator ] ( https://www.racunovodja.com/izracuni/place2017/ ) ) is $ 561.46 which is not enough to live a decent life , but many people have to . 
  \u041b\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0458\u0435 in serbian , maybe similar to macedonian ? 
  `` cerkev svete marije '' = churh of st mary `` cerkev svetega janeza '' = church of st john etc. 
  svete ( ga ) is usually abbreviated to `` sv . '', 
  in the past , '' \u0160ent '' was used as well ( probably from german `` sankt '' ) , morphed to the name and sometimes compressed to a single \u0160 - . 
  for example : [ \u0160entjur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%a0entjur ) ( sveti jurij ) , [ \u0160en\u010dur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%a0en%c4%8dur ) ( sveti jurij ) , \u0160martinska cesta ( sveti martin ) , [ \u0160marna gora ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_saint_mary ) ( sveta marija ) , [ \u0160entvid ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%a0entvid_ ( ljubljana \\ ) ) ( sveti vid ) and many others . 
  i say [ pet knj\u00edk pr\u00eddik ] . 
  but i also say [ b\u00f3h pom\u00e1gi ] , so yes , it varies . 
   `` g '' at the end of the word is pronounced as [ h ] it 's pronounced [ k ] . 
  like all other voiced consonants which lose their voicedness in the final position . 
  and to your orthography . 
  not to be confused with the kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenes . 
  that 's true , but just the identity is checked - not visas and other permits . 
  well the point of schengen zone is visa-free , no-passport-check travel . 
  so in theory , nobody will check him when travelling to paris & amsterdam . 
  however , i 'm not sure about his specific situation with the student visa . 
  what does his visa say ? 
  valid for schengen zone or spain only ? 
  london is a different story . 
  the uk , as you have noted , is not in the schengen zone . 
  from our point of view , kajkavian sounds very cute and almost slovenian . 
  ` we ' started to exist somewhere in the 5th-6th century ad , when ` we ' came to our current territory . 
  it is a grammatical number , just like singular and plural . 
  it is used when you are talking about exactly two things . 
  for example : eno jabolko ( one apple ) dve jabolki ( two apples ) tri jabolka ( three apples ) \u0161tiri jabolka ( four apples ) or jaz znam ( i know ) midva znava ( we two know ) mi znamo ( we know ) etc. 
  as you can see , there are special endings to be used when we talk about two things - this is dual . 
  using examples from lithuanian wikipedia : vienas namas du namu trys namai or viena ranka dvi ranki trys rankos or a\u0161 einu mudu einava mes einame the dual is , i believe , archaic and/or dialectal in lithuanian now , but we still use it normally and do n't think too much about it . 
  apparently you had it as well until ~ 100 years ago ? 
  i finished primary school in 2006 and we basically stopped in 1945 , with a very superficial mention of the events of 1991 . 
  when i finished secondary school in 2010 , we did exactly the same thing .
