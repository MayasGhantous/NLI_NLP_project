  cool , did n't know that !, 
  well , lent is called * post * in slovenian , but i 'm not aware of any special words describing the food in this period . 
  it 's the same , yes . 
  for some reason they have different names in different countries . 
  stric/teta ( `` uncle/aunt '' ) are commonly used in the first scenario . 
  in the second one , the child would be usually taught to use gospod/gospa ( `` mr/mrs '' or `` sir/madam '' ) . 
  of course i wait for the green light . 
  i do n't want to end up in [ valkenvania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nothing_but_trouble_ ( 1991_film \\ ) ) . 
  * mercator * ( inter ) spar * tu\u0161 * e.leclerc * eurospin * lidl * hofer, 
  we had a semi-formal english class in 3rd and 4th grade ( age 9-10 , i ca n't remember ) , and then formal classes ( with marks etc. ), 
  from 5th grade on . 
  no , we did n't formally study any scandinavian language . 
   nowadays everybody 's first foreign language in slovenia is english , but i 've had one classmate in high school whose first foreign language was german ( i was born in 1992 for the reference . ), 
  that being said , there are two bilingual areas in slovenia where italian and hungarian are also official languages , respectively . 
  i believe children living in those areas learn italian/hungarian before english . 
  in the past , new york was called * novi jork * in slovenian . 
  nowadays , we use the native name but pronounce it as [ njujork ] . 
  there are also * \u010cikago * and * filadelfija * but i do n't think they see much use . 
  more specifically the * institute for the slovenian language ` fran ramov\u0161 ' * , part of the zrc ( scientific-research centre ) of the sazu . 
  never seen one . 
  in fact , when i first visited celovec ( `` klagenfurt '' for our northern neighbours ) , i was quite surprised to see a gun shop !, 
  i am a * ljubljan\u010dan * ( from ljubljana ) , * slovenec * ( from slovenia ^ 1 ) , * evropejec * ( from europe ) and * zemljan * ( from earth ) . 
  ^ 1 i just realised we do n't have separate words for slovenes as ethnicity vs. inhabitant/citizen of the country , like e.g. 
  uk is no exception . 
  in every country of the uk , eu citizens are treated exactly the same as the locals . 
  it is uk 's internal problems that they behave as four different countries , 
  on mockup documents , * ana vzorec * is usually used . 
  ( vzorec = sample ), 
  that 's why the french write putin 's name as * poutine * ... , 
  oh yes , we have the same . 
  makes at least something in german easy to learn . 
  yes , we have the same thing ( in common with all other slavic languages ) . 
  informal : ti formal : vi i am now in my mid-twenties . 
  it 's an awkward age , you ca n't decide if people think you are older ( because they speak ` vi ' to you ) or they think you are a teenager ( because they speak ` ti ' to you ) . 
  in bosnia , i was able to pay in euro in lots of places . 
  their currency is pegged to euro ( = 1.95583 marka ) anyway so they are always happy to accept it at 1:2 rate . 
  and do n't get me started about me\u0111ugorje ( the pilgrimage centre in the south of the country ) . 
  they seem to accept * any * currency as long as you give it to them !, 
  you are located to the south of us , so of course your weather is warmer . 
  but only in months whose names contain the letter ` r ' . 
  kalcete = socks ( chiefly in primorska ) fajhten = humid, 
  there are two kinds of words ` borrowed ' from other languages . 
  some of them are used daily in conversation and known by everyone , but still perceived as ` impure ' and not used in ` proper ' language . 
  examples : fla\u0161a , \u017eajfa , kalcete , fajhten others form part of our standard vocabulary and people do n't even know they are not originally slavic . 
  examples : hi\u0161a , \u017eaga , knez , poga\u010da the division between the two groups seems arbitrary . 
  hm , has always been `` cifra ali mo\u017e '' for me !, 
  there was even a popular song with this name in the 70s ( ? 
  non-existent compared to the uk !, 
  i think it usually says `` proizvedeno '' or `` izdelano '' v sloveniji ? 
  is n't it spelt maryja in polish ? 
  yeah , i understand the meaning , i was just commenting that `` da '' in this case does n't mean `` yes '' , 
  well generally you do n't need a citizenship of a country to live there legally , just a thought . 
  not really relevant for slovenia though . 
  oh , my place  i 'm sure you 'll love it !, 
  rather nice , i 'd say . 
   where exactly are you moving to ? 
  you will also need a separate visa for serbia . 
  i believe you actually can enter croatia with a schengen visa even though it 's not in schengen yet , feel free to correct me . 
  is n't * kako da ne * more like `` how [ is it ] that no ? '', 
  i 'm sure you could give me plenty of advice regarding this matter !, 
  do excuse me now , i have other errands to run . 
  talk to you later !, 
   meat me.in bg kinky !, 
  i certainly live for meat , but i wo n't leave to meet with you . 
  i 'm a bit too far away . 
  well i think it 's best for you to go there and see with your own eyes then - hopefully you will se the reality . 
  mind you , i am personally opposed to kosovar independence and think it should belong to serbia . 
  but , as we can see , the reality is different and we can not really do anything as long as 90 % + of the population obviously does n't want to belong there anymore . 
  yes of course !, 
  but there is still a republic of kosovo . 
  why does it exist if it is supposedly part of serbia ? 
   predstavnici srba u privremenim kosovskim institucijama you do n't say . 
  lol no !, 
  will you please give me a source of the government and parliament in pri\u0161tina saying that kosovo is a part of serbia ? 
  please please please . 
  yeah i know , i just could n't sleep last night . 
  it 's always interesting to see when he will stop responding with ` rational ' comments and go batshit crazy . 
  do we print and mint euro ? 
  so we have no currency ? 
   still you fail to grasp that the regional coalition government is about as relevant now as the government of the pre-1994 belarus in exile ... you are not very good at answering questions , are you ? 
  still waiting . 
  $ is their currency , sorry . 
  they use it officially so we can not dispute it . 
  yeah , i get that the serbian members of the regional parliament in pri\u0161tina claim kosovo is serbia . 
  and i am very well aware that it 's not the same as the parliament in belgrade . 
  so if they think kosovo is part of serbia , why do n't they pass an act disestablishing the republic of kosovo ? 
  alright , the population 5 was a figure of speech . 
  i thought you would understand that . 
  i change the figure to 100 . 
  the sovereign military order of malta issues passports . 
  it has diplomatic relations with lots and lots of countries . 
  how many diplomatic relations does nsk have ? 
  and rodona ? 
  and tovarna rog ? 
  does anybody * relevant * acknowledge their independence ? 
  you see , we 've come a full circle . 
  you still have n't answered my question - let me paraphrase : do you agree that `` abkhazia is an integral part of georgia , no question about that . '', 
  i was wrong about transnistria , alright . 
  of course kosovo has a currency : euro . 
  abkhazia and south ossetia 's currency is russian rouble ( in abkhazia also apsar ) .
