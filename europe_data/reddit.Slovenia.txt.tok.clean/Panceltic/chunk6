  kosovo may have a regional parliament and its members can say whatever they like ( obviously they are serbians ) , but what does it matter if nobody listens to them , if * the very territory they are supposed to represent * has broken away and has clearly not voted for this parliament at all ? 
  ok , liberland has a population 8-10 . 
  my point stil stands . 
  the sovereign military order of malta has a tonne of citizens too , but it 's not a country . 
  as thick as two short planks !, 
  let 's not talk about sealand and molossia , let 's talk about abkhazia , south ossetia and transnistria . 
  territories whose population exceed 5 people . 
  real people live there , not by choice but by birth . 
  they function as countries . 
  they have parliaments , governments , their currencies and economies . 
  just like kosovo does . 
  the greatest sovereign state in the world ( russia ) recognises their independence from georgia/moldova and has in fact actively helped them to establish it . 
  do you still think they are just as credible as kosovo ? 
  even though they are only recognized by 5 or 6 states , as opposed to kosovo 's 114 ? 
  and given the fact that russia recognises them ? 
  still not enough recognitions to be credible . 
  the self-proclaimed `` republic of kosovo '' has so far received 114 diplomatic recognitions , which is more than half of the world 's 206 states ( numbers from wikipedia ) and amounts to a big claim to credibility . 
  are abkhazia , south ossetia and transnistria countries in your opinion ? 
  yes , but are liberland and sealand recognized by other countries ? 
  if they are not , why should their opinion matter ? 
  you see , it 's all relative , a chain , so to speak .

  it 's all about * other * countries recognising * you * . 
  er , that 's exactly how you become a country . 
  you gather enough international supporters and that 's it !,

  no , i am one god in three persons . 
  this is becoming wildly irrelevant now . 
  so russian !, 
  much violence !, 
  such masculine !, 
  wow !, 
  i do n't get it , there is even less wit in russia than in the holy tsardom of celestial serbia . 
  * wit * is just not your thing , is it , 
  mate , you could ask exactly the same question about your own country .

  [ karl erjavec ] ( http://www.delo.si/assets/media/picture/20080718/erjavec_karl_obramba.jpg?rev=1 ) - the guy has been the minister of everything in all governments so far . 
  has a speech impediment ( not his fault ) and always speaks with a peasant-like accent ( his fault ) and everything he says makes me cringe . 
  he never seems to even think about what he 's going to say , he just talks out of his head ( which is not a good strategy for somebody in such an important position ) . 
  yes , i always thought these were beautiful . 
  iceland 2 . the netherlands 3 . 
  andorra as that would complete my been-to list west of slovenia , 
  you misspelt ` slovenia ' . 
  in slovenia , you can change your name and you do n't need a reason . 
  then you have to order new documents and everything , it is quite costly . 
  obviously this only works for citizens ( and possibly residents ) , you ca n't just come here from poland and say `` please change my name '' . 
  to the op , is your name really that horrible ? 
  depending on where you live , you can choose a similar name socially but maintain your polish name officially . 
  as a recent newcomer to the uk , i could n't agree more !, 
  everything seems so * simple * here - no complications . 
  not in slovenia . 
  if a holiday falls on the weekend , tough luck . 
  in the uk , as far as i know , holidays are transferred . 
  in 2016 , for example , christmas day was on sunday , so 27 december was the ` replacement ' bank holiday . 
  however , workers are not entitled to days off on bank holidays , so this is not really relevant . 
  yes , definitely save the coast for the summer . 
  frequent & fast high-speed trains, 
  touch\u00e9 , 
  excellent , thanks !, 
  sure , on my way !, 
  ( whatever that meant . ), 
  i believe you , had some classmates from your area , horrible !, 
  never !, 
  i dare n't utter a bad word in front of them . 
  yes , he will automatically become king , the very second the queen dies . 
  vatican is effectively an elective monarchy , very interesting . 
  we know , darling , we know . 
  most of the stuff can be reached by local train/bus . 
  a car is useful if you want to get there quicker though . 
  just a slight note about the trains , budapest  ljubljana is just once a day i think and it takes 8 hours . 
   the usa is illegitimate , we should cut off relations with them and trump , americans are savages/not true westerners/subhuman , they deserve to be attacked , they 're a bunch of lazy violent idiots , they should be nuked into oblivion , we should nationalize their assets , i fucking hate americans/the yanks oh come on . 
  trains to take : prague  bratislava ( you can see slovakia too ) bratislava  budapest budapest  ljubljana ljubljana  budapest vienna  prague if you spend 3 days in each city and its environments i think it 's just the right amount , 
  [ this one ] ( https://blog.hostelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ljubljana2.jpg ) 's really good . 
  not the traditional angle you get on all ljubljana pictures . 
  no , it 's either 100.000,00 or 100 000 ( usually used when there 's no decimals ) . 
  debit card for in-person shopping credit card for internet purchases ( i have to pay the full balance each month , so effectively it 's a charge card ),

  gorazd is awesome . 
  i 've always thought of it as a really badass name as well , an idea intensified by one of the locomotives ( the nasty one ) being called gorazd in the slovenian version of thomas the tank engine !, 
  that 's gora ** \u017e ** de , completely different . 
  oh no , i 've been on top of various mountains over 2000m high , but i really do n't remember them all and hence do n't know the answer . 
  1 ) slovenia - born and lived there 2 ) uk - living here now 3 ) croatia - some day trips , some week-or-so vacations 4 ) france - some weeks ( city breaks ) 5 ) austria - some day trips 6 ) italy - some day trips 7 ) belgium - used as a transit country to get to france  8 ) usa - a week 9 ) hungary - few days 10 ) bosnia - few days,
