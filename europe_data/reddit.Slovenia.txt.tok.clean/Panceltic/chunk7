  and i 've travelled a fairly big part of the world and enjoyed food everywhere , needless to say . 
  am from frogtown , can confirm . 
  i 'd add * \u017ealik \u017eene * and maybe * pehta * to the list . 
  also * divja jaga * which is not a specific being but more like an occurrence . 
  do n't have any links at hand now , sorry . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/union_state ) always baffled me !, 
  ducat ( dozen ) - mainly eggs , but even they are sold in 10s nowadays cola ( inch ) - for technical stuff cent ( 100 kg ) - not really used , but lives on in memory , e.g. 
  in the saying ` te\u017eek si kot cent ' ( you are as heavy as 100kg ), 
  but still the actual value of the pound has changed so much since the 1970s that it does n't make sense converting anymore !, 
  do they convert pounds to pounds when buying stuff ? 
  take a look at the welsh or danish numbers . 
  then run crying back to french mama . 
  serbians agree ( and sometimes exaggerate with this principle ) . 
  how do you fit extra words into the tune ? 
  in standard slovene there are no contractions , but dialects are another story . 
  some of them drop basically all unstressed vowels :d, 
  slovenian spoken by minorities in austria , italy and hungary is sometimes difficult to understand ( especially the latter ) . 
  as mentioned in previous answers , there are currently 23 countries minting their own euro coins - 19 members of the eurozone and 4 microstates . 
  every one of them mints a ` standard ' set of eight denominations ranging from 1c to $ 2 . 
  some of the countries have already changed these designs ( some of them multiple times ) so there are currently more than 23 sets of coins . 
  they are valid throughout the eurozone . 
  then , there are the commemorative $ 2 coins , of which every country can issue max . 
  2 per year . 
  some of them are issued jointly by all countries ( this has happened 4 times so far ) , others are issued by individual countries . 
  [ wikipedia has a list of those . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_euro_commemorative_coins ) they are also valid throughout the eurozone . 
  lastly , there are special coins , intended for collectors . 
  they depend entirely on the issuing country and are only valid in that country . 
  for example , there is a $ 3 coin in my country and the ( in ) famous $ 2.50 coin belgium recently issued . 
  yes , four years ago , in kaunas . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  i 've met random people speaking fluent slovene in lithuania for example , not to mention on the internet . 
  too far away in time !, 
   fille a ** \u00ee ** n\u00e9e do n't buy into the horrible orthographic reform !!, 
  oh , it 's an old one - a general interest in all matters celtic , especially languages . 
   for eu purposes each country only gets to pick one language really ? 
  i wonder which one belgium chose then . 
  slovenistan ( when we 're bitching about our country ) zlovenija ( when croats tease us - `` zlo '' = `` evil '' ), 
  ` do you eat beans ? ', 
  also zala and \u0160pela for women ( although \u0160pela is derived from elizabeta , but not really recognisable ) . 
  i like ildik\u00f3 and bogl\u00e1rka . 
  i like this custom , sounds great to have so many names - but that 's just me . 
  i think in some countries ( greece , france ) women actually * can not * take their husbands ' names - they have to keep their maiden name for life . 
  hahahaha , a very slavic prayer indeed . 
  they call it [ salo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salo_\\ ( food \\ ) ) . 
  sure is !, 
   state religions ** in europe ** mean essentially nothing . 
  ftfy . 
  eurail and interrail are just names of the tickets - there are loads and loads of different train companies in europe ( usually every country has one , with some countries having more ) . 
  and yes , they can be used for the same trains . 
  it all depends where you want to go . 
  if you will stay within the schengen area ( which includes most of europe , e.g. 
  france , italy , spain , belgium , the netherlands etc. ), 
  you will need to apply for a schengen visitor visa . 
  given that you 're planning to go to france ( and spend the most time there ) , it would make sense to apply at the french embassy in the uk . 
  you can then travel anywhere in the [ schengen area ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/map_of_the_schengen_area.svg ) ( blue colour ) within the validity of your visa . 
  thanks !, 
  in this case , he will need appropriate visas for schengen and any other european countries he intends to visit . 
  the op has the uk visa which has nothing to do with schengen  it all depends on the citizenship of the op . 
  austria : everything seems to be orderly and functioning properly ( as opposed to our country ) italy : pizza croatia : beautiful seaside hungary : ... they 're just there , not making any bother . 
   weerd language eppek eppek, 
  of course , we are littered with them . 
  churches , chapels , little chapels ( you ca n't walk into ) , crosses , statues - you name it . 
  i know they do it in gorenjska , but possibly elsewhere too , maybe under different name , i do n't know . 
  \u0160ranga is basically what happens when a man marries a woman which is not from his own place ( village ) . 
  he has to ` buy ' her from her village ( = single men who could have married her ) which entails various rituals . 
  the villagers usually try to deceive him with a straw doll or an old man dressed up as a bride . 
  the groom often has to saw through a piece of wood to prove his strength , and in the end they ` give ' him his bride - he has to pay , of course , for everybody 's drinks !, 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cia0-wql_u ) also , when it 's somebody 's birthday ( or name day in days of yore ) , friends would gather under their window and generally make as much noise as possible , usually using pans , pots , cutlery , lids etc. 
  this is called ofiranje . 
  montenegro missing !, 
  they defeated the ottomans . 
  [ this . 
  ] ( http://www.hollandamericablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/img_5098_resize.jpg ) , 
  i will list the ones i * have n't * yet been to : * albania * andorra * belarus * bulgaria * cyprus * estonia * finland * iceland * kosovo * latvia * malta * moldova * montenegro * the netherlands * romania * russia * turkey * ukraine, 
  it includes [ kranjska klobasa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carniolan_sausage ) , a traditional slovenian sausage . 
  that 's it - this bruger was only introduced this year i think . 
  you 're correct . 
  in the mid-to-late nineties when i was a child , people still discussed price of cars in deutsche mark  but still , we had an official currency and used it , whereas these two countries just * do n't * have any other currency . 
  for example , bosnia has its convertible mark which is effectively just euro in another form ( permanently pegged to its value ) - is this not a solution for montenegro for example ? 
  maybe they just do n't want to bother ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  i have just checked my id and it is completely the same . 
  apart from the picture of course , 
   rezija ( near italy ) have an upvote . 
  i 'm from lj too . 
  always `` kamen-papir-\u0161karje '' , 
  i think the gun permit does n't have your photo in it though ? 
  as far as i know , erasmus is for interchanging between universities in europe . 
  as long as you study in a university in europe that participates in this programme , you can then spend a semester or two in another university . 
  it is also true that tons of other non-european countries have separate interchange agreements with universities so you would possibly qualify there . 
  in practice all exchange students ( erasmus or not ) are usually grouped together when they come here . 
   it 's the nearest coast from me ahem ... :d, 
  most of them ... 
  we say [ m\u0259g ` donalts ] or colloquially [ m\u025bk ] . 
  i can describe the traditional way of celebrating - closely connected with religion of course . 
  i am aware that many people do n't observe these traditions anymore . 
  preparing for christmas begins 4 weeks before ( advent season ) . 
  families make [ these ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=adventni+ven%c4%8dek&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiy-la0m8tqahusccakhehsd5iq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=765 ) at home and bring them for blessing in the church . 
  then every week , a candle more is lit so that in the week before christmas , all four are alight .
