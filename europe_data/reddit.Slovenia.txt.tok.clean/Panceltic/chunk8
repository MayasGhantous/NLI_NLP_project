  on 6 december ( not really connected with christmas , but inside the festive period ) is st nicholas day - [ sv . 
  miklav\u017e ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=firefox-b-ab&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=765&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=sveti+miklav%c5%be&amp;oq=sveti+miklav%c5%be&amp;gs_l=img.3...124011.125205.0.125345.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.0.0._mxkdo2gufa ) in slovene - he brings presents to children who have been good but those who have not behaved get a stick and are threatened by [ parkeljni ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=firefox-b-ab&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=765&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=parkelj&amp;oq=parkelj&amp;gs_l=img.3...32207.33449.0.33553.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.0.0.xdi-xd_jyxy ) . 
  on st lucia 's day ( 13 dec ) we plant [ christmas wheat ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=firefox-b-ab&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=765&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=bo%c5%bei%c4%8dno+%c5%beito&amp;oq=bo%c5%bei%c4%8dno+%c5%beito&amp;gs_l=img.3...81263.82373.0.82457.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.0.0.dtrkkwdk8zk ) which is later planted into the nativity scene . 
  on the 24th dec , the christmas tree is decorated and the [ nativity scene ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=firefox-b-ab&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=765&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=jaslice&amp;oq=jaslice&amp;gs_l=img.3...137351.137790.0.137913.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.0.0.mz7tofyb9fq ) is set up . 
  families usually have these passed on from their parents so some of them are quite old and elaborate . 
  the 24th dec is also known as `` the first holy evening '' - the family goes around the house and sprinkles holy water ( using a little spruce branch from the christmas tree ) and burns frankincense ( smells heavenly imo ) . 
  the fire used to burn the frankincense is traditionally made by burning last year 's [ these ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=firefox-b-ab&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=765&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=butarica&amp;oq=butarica&amp;gs_l=img.3...193777.194314.0.194396.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.0.0.zjria3lhh6q ) ( used for easter celebration ) . 
  after the blessing of the home , the figurine of baby jesus is put into the nativity scene and everyone goes to midnight mass . 
  the next day is spent with the family at home with some seriously good [ food ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=firefox-b-ab&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=765&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=potica&amp;oq=potica&amp;gs_l=img.3...158221.158665.0.158771.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.0.0.9zteysao6xg ) . 
  26th dec ( st stephen 's day ) is the day to visit your relatives and eat the leftovers  it is also the day when horses are blessed ( and , in modern days , cars and other means of transport ) . 
  blessing of the salt also takes place on this day . 
  28th dec is the day of the innocent children . 
  on this day , it was usual for the children to go out and [ strike adults ] ( http://lh6.ggpht.com/_5owkli51sn8/s8fnbwy3roi/aaaaaaaaamk/4ysbrlqzeye/s800/tradition-tepezkanje.jpg ) who would give them sweets - but i think this tradition has died out by now . 
  the evening of 31st dec is the `` second holy evening '' - the procedure described above is repeated . 
  then the celebration of new year kicks in which is pretty similar to other countries i presume . 
  :d the `` third holy evening '' is on 6th january and this is the third and final time for house blessing . 
  this is the feast of the magi ( three kings ) and their figures are added to the nativity scene . 
  people dress [ like them ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=firefox-b-ab&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=765&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=koledniki&amp;oq=koledniki&amp;gs_l=img.3...278644.280612.0.280706.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.0.0.-sf-4d7kqsc ) and go around singing christmas songs - they are supposed to bring good luck to your house and it is expected to give a small donation for charity which they collect . 
  they also write , in chalk , `` 20 g + m + b 17 '' on your door ( initials of the traditional names of the three kings , the number changes according to the year ) and this would then stay there until the next year 's visit . 
  the nativity scene and the christmas tree stay until 2nd february when they are stored away for the next year . 
  yes , we have a [ jeruzalem ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/place/2259+jeruzalem/@46.473538,16.1809705,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x476f4568a3cb4533:0xe75a63cb60df78a8!8m2!3d46.4760769!4d16.1879489 ) and a [ rim ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/place/8341+rim/@45.5403303,15.2884784,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4764430d0e8c6f11:0xfd22eeb0f71f9632!8m2!3d45.5402374!4d15.2925839 ) ( which is the name of rome in slovenian ) - though the latter is not outside europe . 
  belgium for me . 
  - obama !, 
  how many balls ( * literally ` eggs ' * ) does the american president have ? 
  - obama !, 
  ` oba ma ' is a spoken variant of ` oba ima ' - ` he has both of them ' . 
  in standard slovene it should be ` obe ima ' though , because ` jajce ' ( egg ) is neuter gender . 
  well , greenland left ( what was then ) the eu in 1984 but its citizens continue to hold eu citizenship . 
  i do n't know if this counts as a precedent though . 
  just check the plane schedules ... 
  they always give local times . 
  ours is kinda cool , `` let 's all be friends '' . 
  montenegrin is like a funeral song though . 
  i try to use cards whenever possible . 
  sorbian is in its own branch i think . 
  you 're right of course !, 
  i forgot about those : s, 
   stole your main port confessed at last . 
  yes , there are some words to look out for , e.g. 
  * af * vs * av * and norwegian has more j 's . 
  pedant alert !, 
   actually d\u017e and \u0111 are different letters ( just like \u010d and \u0107 ) - so we just do n't have the ` soft ' variants that serbo-croatian uses . 
  d\u017e is also not a separate letter in slovenian , whereas it is in s-c . 
  \u0141 is polish only . 
  to distinguish lithuanian and latvian , you look out for ogoneks in lt and macrons in lv . 
  same here . 
  i know * wireless * in english , which used to mean radio . 
  for cyrillic-based languages , there 's always one or two letters that are unique to only one of them . 
  abundance of \u044a is the giveaway for bulgarian , \u0457 is ukrainian , and \u0452 and \u045b serbian . 
  it is also the only way ryanair accept correspondence . 
  i 've heard that online banking in america works like this : you give instructions to your bank online to pay someone else . 
  your bank then prints a check and sends it to the recipient 's bank ... 
  well , yes  if you want to differentiate , then : czech only : \u011b \u016f \u0159 slovak only : \u00e4 \u00f4 \u013e \u0155 \u013a, 
  slovak actually has more diacritics than czech !, 
  czech : \u00e1 \u00e9 \u00ed \u00f3 \u00fa \u00fd \u016f \u010d \u0161 \u017e \u0159 \u011b \u0165 \u010f \u0148 slovak : \u00e1 \u00e9 \u00ed \u00f3 \u00fa \u00fd \u010d \u0161 \u017e \u00e4 \u00f4 \u010f \u0165 \u013e \u0148 \u0155 \u013a ( polish : \u0105 \u0107 \u0119 \u0142 \u0144 \u00f3 \u015b \u017a \u017c ), 
  in written form , i can distinguish all of them . 
  but in spoken form , i think i 'd have troubles distinguishing danish/swedish/norwegian . 
  the process is certainly easier if you do . 
  and shorter . 
  yes , i do consider armenia and georgia to be european . 
  while they are usually combined with azerbaijan to form ` those countries in the caucasus ' , i personally do n't think of azerbaijan as european . 
  resident cards are just for non-eu citizens . 
  but i think you can apply for a document confirming you have a right to live in the netherlands as a eu citizen ( i know uk does this , and so does slovenia ) . 
  oh yes , if breads falls on the floor you must instantly pick it up and kiss it . 
  same here , 
  never watched it , to be frank . 
  for me , it was slovenian . 
  local dialect at home and in free time , standard language in school/church/tv . 
  i was exposed a bit to german and croatian via austrian and croatian tv channels that we were able to watch . 
  lots of people in the vicinity were immigrants from other ex-yu republics , so it was possible to hear spoken croatian/serbian too . 
  [ wikipedia has lots of info . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_policy_of_the_schengen_area ) you might want to check it and plan your journey accordingly , 
  hm , while croatia is not in schengen , i think it somehow counts for days spent within schengen due to its being part of the eu . 
  belgrade is in serbia and therefore outside schengen - just a reminder !, 
  oh right , but these are moods , not tenses . 
  so there are 7 tenses in indicative ( jesam , budem bio , bi\u0107u , bio sam , bijah , bih , bio sam bio ) 1 tense in imperative ( budi ) 2 tenses in potential/conditional ( bio bih , bio bih bio ), 
  yes , that 's correct . 
  on its own , it means a nervous feeling you have before travelling somewhere ( as used in my dialect , especially by older people ) : `` ima\u0161 kaj fibra ? '', 
  - `` do you have any fieber ? '', 
  meaning `` are you nervous because you are travelling to e.g. 
  america tomorrow ? '', 
  we have the same distinction ljubim te . 
  = i love you . 
  ( real love ) rad ( a ) te imam . 
  * \u017evrcniti * in slovenian . 
  a slang word , not to be used in formal situations . 
  we use a german loanword for this : muskelfiber . 
   we have 9 present future i future ii perfect imperfect aorist pluperfect which two have i missed ? 
   genuine question . 
  alps-adria ... 
  i do n't know how serious it is though . 
  we have 4 ... are you questioning our slavicness ? 
   serbo-croatian has 7 . 
  are n't there four subjunctive tenses in french ? 
  two simple , two compounded ? 
  it is not as rare as we like to think though , 
  on the other hand , i 'd revert the borders to 1914 , 
  well a relative of mine got obsessed with the ` end of the world ' in 2000 . 
  bought tons of food . 
  took us a few years to eat all that canned stuff !,
