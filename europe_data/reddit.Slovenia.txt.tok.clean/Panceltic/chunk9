  oh , the * \u0161marnice * in may - i remember all of these songs  [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mooeayms8aa ) gives me goosebumps . 
  and [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brxmm2bf1sy ) is the absolute classic , the supreme song so to speak . 
   do n't let him win . 
  never . 
  oh they most definitely are still in use , i see them every day  but i agree , not all of them are bad . 
  they 're just old , nothing bad about them from my point of view . 
  yes , that 's the one . 
  he met his death crashing into a bilingual sign , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  such an irony . 
  ok then !, 
   i believe 1.5 hr is sufficient , i 've done 40 minutes in munich before . 
  ( schengen  not-schengen ), 
  kvas is awesome . 
  ca n't describe its taste with any words that i know , but soooo tasty . 
  so does this mustard contain horseradish ? 
  they all mention it . 
  if by cr you mean croatia , it is not in schengen area either,

  well , according to the rules above , you already are an austrian citizen - because your father was an austrian citizen at the time of your birth . 
  i am not a lawyer though so you might want to re-confirm this . 
  my limited czech skills suggest she asks him if he has a mobile phone . 
  he then responds that he indeed has one ( his friends bought it for him ) and it is called ` alligator ' ... 
  from wikipedia :  a child born to two austrian parents is an austrian citizen , regardless of the parents ' marital status . 
   if the parents are married at the time of birth , austrian citizenship of either the mother or the father is sufficient , so long as the child was born after 1 september 1983 . 
  for children born prior to that date , the father must have been an austrian citizen : children born to an austrian mother married to a non-austrian father do not qualify . 
   if the parents are not married , a mother automatically passes on austrian citizenship . 
  a father passes on citizenship if he acknowledges paternity or a court does so within 8 weeks of the birth . 
  should the parents marry at some time after the birth , citizenship is automatically granted to the child retroactively . 
  if the child is over 14 at that time , however , the child 's consent is needed . 
  [ nuff said ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jxuo4gnppk ) :d, 
  yeah , and you elected your ex-king as a prime minister . 
  that is some history gold !, 
  why do you trust wikipedia ? 
  we should only believe what the constitution and the laws say ( or so you used to tell us , albeit with a different reddit account ) : 4th article : slovenija je ozemeljsko enotna in nedeljiva dr\u017eava . 
  end of . 
  no , never a single problem . 
  although entering with my id card seemed to take more than a minute whilst entering with my passport took 5 seconds . 
  slovenia is officialy a unitary state and it has no administrative divisions . 
  the municipalities are the ` lokalna samouprava ' thing and have nothing to do with the government . 
  omg . 
  yes , the one in pivka is fantastic . 
  so subtle . 
  i think it 's koleraba , 
  ' i was very proud to become ** citizens ** of the united states ' . 
   also eerily similar to [ haggis , neeps and tatties ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/haggis%2c_neeps_and_tatties.jpg ) .

  i 'm not sure what slovenia would have to offer at such a fair , but our delicious [ blood sausages ] ( http://www.recepti.hr/upload/krvavica-kuharica.jpg ) would surely attract huge crowds . 
  what about ambrus ? 
  yes , multiple . 
  i do n't know the intricacies of our nationality law , but there are generous concessions for people with slovenian ancestry . 
  otherwise , our citizenship is quite difficult to obtain ( e.g. 
  10 years ' residence in slovenia is required , among other things ) . 
  i think you should ask the embassy , they must have dealt with a case like yours before . 
  what about \u0160pi\u010dkovina and pizdino vrilo ? 
  ritoznoj ( ass-sweat ) mali nerajec ( little something-that-doesn ` t-make-me-horny ), 
  yes i know , that 's why i pointed it out ( the audible similarity between rzyga\u0107 and rigati and how they mean different things ) . 
  you mean * rzyga\u0107 * ? 
   * rigati * in slovenian is * beka\u0107 * however , the pyromaniac has nothing to do with it . 
  the underlying verb is * \u017egati * - to burn ( cf. 
  polish * \u017cec ( \u017cg\u0119 , \u017c\u017cesz etc. 
  ) * ) , causative * po\u017egati * , imperfective * po\u017eigati * . 
  and the one who does this is a * po\u017eigalec * . 
  not really . 
  though girls of certain extractions seem to do it all the time and not so long ago i witnessed it between two guys . 
  appalled , i left the country forever . 
  oh yes , the famous * po\u017eigalec * ( pyromaniac ) . 
  [ original ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqqvejypgle ) [ remake ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdwwn6nm-v4 ) there was a pyromaniac lurking around velenje and those two thugs accidentally discovered his identity while trying to rob him ... 
  in the tv interview they speak a lot of nonsense in a very heavily accented slovenian ( think ex-yugoslav migrants ) . 
  tole je super branje : http://blog.dnevnik.hr/agramerskistikleci/, 
  * vesna * and * ne \u010dakaj na maj * are my favourites . 
  and i think there are subtitles , somewhere . 
  twinings , yorkshire, 
  i 've had some americans try `` dobr\u00e9 r\u00e1no '' and `` ako sa m\u00e1\u0161 '' on me ... was too tactful to point out their utterances were in slovak ... 
  he also wrote some great poetry in german !, 
  also rezija . 
  france pre\u0161eren , i think . 
  cepelinai from lithuania , 
  aaaaand the guess is right . 
  yes !, 
  in fact , just did . 
  judging from that map , we have a special relationship buddy !, 
  no , what are you on ? 
  yes , in polish it 's gone too far and is now official  the famous \u0141 letter . 
  some dialects of slovenian also do this ( as described above ) , but it 's not standard . 
  check where [ german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_german_citizens ) and [ polish ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_polish_citizens ) citizens can travel visa-free and then decide which of the passports is better for you . 
  but if you 're eligible , why not go for both ? 
  oh yes , that 's just a bus . 
  as of now , eurostar is the only train service between the uk and the continent . 
  anyway the response you received confirms that 120 eur have been refunded to your card and it may take a few working days . 
  could you clarify what regiojet you are talking about ? 
  as far as i know , there are only eurostar trains between london and brussels . 
  she actually left it here . 
  which reinforces your point , 
  i do n't agree they are useless , but managing them is time-consuming , yes . 
  2 euro : 2 x german , 1 x austrian , 1 x fancy austrian , 1 x fancy irish !, 
  it 's more like : finland and netherlands , y u do n't use 1 & 2 cents anymore ? 
  ` wedding night intention ' ? 
  well , you guys are good at euphemisms .
