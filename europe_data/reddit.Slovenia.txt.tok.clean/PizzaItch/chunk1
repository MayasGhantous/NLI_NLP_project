i know . 
  but if have to choose between a far-right and a far-left candidate in the second round , you might have a problem . 
  even with two rounds , plurality voting system seems increasingly broken if this are the results it produces . 
  i do n't imagine the majority of french citizens supporting either of the two . 
  ( if you 're wondering about the alternative : ranked voting ) . 
  i think it 's more than one factor at work here . 
  i tend to agree abortion legislation is the main factor in ni and poland , but in slovenia abortion is legal up to 10 weeks into pregnancy , yet it tops the list here . 
  so i 'm thinking this map should n't be read so much as displaying lone-parent families as families with unmarried partners ( oxymoron ? 
  dunno , but many slovenes have kids , live togeteher yet do n't marry , thechnically being lone-parent families . 
  edit : there 's actually some legislation covering such arrangements under `` non-matrimony partnership '' , but no idea how that 's interpreted for the purpose of this graphic ) . 
  i for one welcome back our old german overlords . 
  yes , it has problems , but that should n't be a reason to throw away the baby out with the bathwater , like it 's popular with many eu critics . 
  i 'm pretty sure they could do without one of their sachsen . 
  well , after we 've helped re-establish the upper eu flag , we figured we could best protect it by relocating to the place above it , 
  well , the eu has been created mostly to keep germany and france from beating the shit out of eachother , so i think the current situation is fitting . 
  let 's admit it , everyone else are just hangers-on . 
  to serve as a bulwark for the eu , of course !, 
  i agree spain should be helped in drawing their flag , but i prefer the eu flag at the intersection of france and germany . 
  most importantly , though , italy already has their flag https://www.reddit.com/r/place#x=123&amp;y=325 and forcing france to give up further pixels seems unfair . 
  so beautiful , volunteering to anschluss some french clay . 
  where were the italians when the germans decided to invade , i wonder ... 
  take up your pixels and fight !, 
  join la r\u00e9sistance and help draw an eu flag in between and end this madness !, 
  afaik the eu regulations require that pipeline operator and gas provider be two different entities ( free market and all that ) . 
  that was not the case with south stream ( both gas and pipeline [ at about 50 % share ] would be owned by gazprom ) so it was nixed . 
  curiously nord stream is no different in that regard , yet it is ok ... 
  well , now you seem to be saying the british empire was n't quite as nasty as any other ... 
  makes me sometimes think , what if trialism had succeeded ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:trijalisti%c4%8dki_prijedlog_prema_nzb_1910.png, 
  so much lebensraum ... 
  maybe pothole-riddled roads result in people driving more carefully ? 
  good guess . 
  in slovene and german , at least , it means `` label '' . 
  i have a feeling you might be interested in [ this ] ( https://www.electricitymap.org/?wind=false&amp;solar=false&amp;page=map ) . 
  i 'm not sure why data for lux currently is n't shown , i think it usually is . 
  otherwise , yeah ... not all renewable energy is necessarily sustainable . 
  it 's also interesting that in slovene qc4 and qc13 differ ( ` totally comfortable/pleasant ' vs ` very comfortable/pleasant ' ) . 
  it 's like someone actually translated by hand without specialised translation software , which is nowadays pretty much standard everywhere . 
  qc13 is , i assume , structured similarly , but , yeah , that 's not conclusive . 
  thankfully you 're working hard to rectify this . 
  one interstellar bypass at a time . 
  villages were a mistake . 
  nomadic lifestyle ftw : if you do n't trust your neighbours , you just pack up your yurt and move . 
  ha , good one !, 
  i do n't know . 
  i 've wondered about this one before . 
  it 's certainly not recent , the oldest source i 've found till now is from [ 1922 ] ( https://www.google.si/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahukewirq_rps9tvahxlfxokhwfqdfuqfggomaa&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dlib.si%2fstream%2furn%3anbn%3asi%3adoc-mo4trfmu%2fb6529edd-fcc9-4c7a-b98f-bc6731877c05%2fpdf&amp;usg=afqjcnfrki_hycaiej9kkj0lxjd-bn8pva ) , while a question in an interview [ here ] ( https://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/hrvati-edini-sosedje-ki-slovencev-niso-ogrozali/90040 ) implies its from the time of a-h . as for why -- who knows . 
  maybe one of your ancestors stole a few chickens or did n't buy a round in a tavern ? 
  only if you 're within a few metres of the border fence when they decide to nudge it further south . 
   occasional prickle should help that smugness not become even more insufferable . 
  you 've somewhat failed in that respect , though , as the realisation there 's no established jokes for putting down the neighbours so one can feel better about oneself is only making me feel more smug . 
  perhaps ? 
  the largest minorities are immigrants from ex-yu countries and their offspring , albanians , roma , italians and hungarians . 
  i think it 's mostly how the question was phrased . 
   how comfortable they would feel if one of their sons or daughters was in a love relationship with a person from a different ethnic group this would be taken to mean `` anyone but slovene '' . 
  in this light , the percentage makes sense . 
  slovenes may not be nationalistic , but they can be quite xenophobic . 
  especially towards the people from ` down south ' . 
  nope . 
  81 % for slovenia . 
  ( page 24 [ here ] ( http://www.equineteurope.org/img/pdf/ebs_437_en.pdf ) ) i do n't know . 
  having a relationship of any kind is taboo now ? 
  firstly , * most * such divisions are theoretical concepts . 
  secondly , mitteleuropa and intermarium have little overlap . 
  if you squint really hard and ignore portugal and greece , sure , such division seems sensible . 
  i concede , i , too , sometimes use * eastern europe * to refer to the ex-communist half of europe , however this is only useful in the dichotomic relationship west -- east . 
  if you do n't see the cold war era western block as a monolithic region , i do n't think * eastern europe * should be seen as such nor why it is helpful to do so , since many states labelled as such have little in common other than being ex-communist . 
  damn , italy , get well soon . 
  yes , simpler , and stuck three decades in the past . 
  leave it to a brit to draw straight lines . 
  however , it 's still a vast improvement from the usual maps . 
  well , this is kind of to be expected from a far-centre news outlet . 
  the same map with the percentages superimposed over the territory of each state . 
  partly kidding -- but doing that would have been helpful . 
  nonetheless , good job . 
  ( hopefully i 've been gentle ), 
  nah , i think we can accommodate greece so they can join the region they rightfully belong to . 
  * occupied * meaning ` ruled/governed a part of the republic of latvia 's current territory ' ? 
  it should be coloured red , because those lands are currently under the occupation of the republic of latvia . 
  not the way i understand it from this short article . 
  the way i see it , long-term renting will become cheaper while due to the limited availability of tourist accommodation , vacationing will be less affordable ( to foreigners and spaniards alike ) . 
  ** less ** affordable if you do n't trust the logic of economics -- it even says so in the opening paragraph :  british tourists are set to find trips to mallorca and ibiza more expensive as a law placing a cap on the number of hotel beds and stricter rules governing holiday rentals are introduced . 
  i like this one , but i 've always felt it could much improve with somewhat tighter pacing , so i just went and [ did it ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pno2rc5.png ) . 
  says more about the op than anything else , which is a bit of a shame , because if done properly , such research is rather interesting . 
  yup , hail corporate !, 
  is a steak bought in store a significantly different from a steak bought from store x ? 
  ( rhetorical question ), 
  napoleon -- best kaiser we 've ever had . 
   permanent provisional solution this is an oxymoron if i 've ever seen one . 
  this guy has some potential . 
  also , i think a list of resolved frozen conflicts would be quite a short one . 
  while , presupposing the universe is n't deterministic , this is true , i think this is somewhat beside the original point , which is basically : a person c can not be considered lucky to have been born to persons a and b , because the person c could not have been born to anyone but parents a and b. 
  unless one believes in some congregation of pre-existing souls waiting to ( re ) enter this material world upon conception , a person born to any other parent in any other time , under any other circumstances , etc. 
  would not have been person c. therefore person c can not be considered lucky to , e.g. , have been born to parents a and b and not perhaps parents d and e. 
   kristenmedina * 88 * this video is now banned in germany . 
  i think they 're right , however there 's a considerable disagreement whether the mutations have been generally beneficial or not . 
  much liberal , very wow, 
  i thought it 's missing the pronoun * ihr * , so it would read '' * ihr * deutschen , ihr habt ... '' probably either would have been better ? 
  i actually think it 's rather nice that the greatest man of croatia was slovenian . 
  beneath there 's a pyramid of drowning citizens supporting them . 
  do n't be silly -- that would mean croatia is too .
