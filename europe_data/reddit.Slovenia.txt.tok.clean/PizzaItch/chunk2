  ca n't have that . 
  the ~ ~ balkans ~ ~ west south-east europe it is . 
  yeah , but they do n't hear them ringing over the noise of their chainsaws . 
  has dalmatia joined slovenia ? 
  otherwise you 're doing it wrong . 
  i though it 's supposed to be * uvala of pula * . 
  or something . 
  may have been the only significant settlement on the danube known to slovenes ' slavic ancestors at the time . 
  and it quite likely -- since lombards who had inhabited the region had already moved further south -- had little to no inhabitants who could pass on the name of the settlement to the slavs , so they had to come up with a name on their own . 
  `` a village by the river * donava * ? 
  ok , * dunaj * it is . '', 
  some slavs later followed the path the lombards took and went further south-west , so never really explored the entire danube valley . 
  which is probably why the names for settlements budapest , belgrade , etc. 
  are derived from the native languages ; slovenes ' slavic ancestors never lived in those lands . 
  only the most significant city may be awarded the name * dunaj * . 
  if you want that name , i propose a single-elimination fight for it . 
  luxembourg is ... the original netherlands ? 
  suspiciously few trees for this to be finland . 
  this looks more like ... the netherlands . 
  are suomi planning an invasion ? 
  other minorities at least have some rights , such as to education in their mother tongue . 
  and i suppose they 've learnt not too be too vocal , too . 
  i do n't think integration should come at the expense of one 's national identity and language , unless one willingly abandons it , which kurds apparently do not want to do . 
  i can respect that . 
  using the expression * turk * imposes the nationality of the majority nation on all the citizens ; this is effectively turkification . 
  a state serving all its citizens would have used the term * citizen [ of the republic of turkey ] * . 
  projecting much ? 
  in fact , they are not considered as kurds . 
  i could read a [ primer ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6ou1nk/father_of_the_necmettin_teacher_which_got_killed/dkkh7mr/ ) on that from a verifiable nationalistic turk just a few days ago . 
  here 's a kicker straight out of the [ constitution of the republic of turkey ] ( https://global.tbmm.gov.tr/docs/constitution_en.pdf ) :  * article 66 * - everyone bound to the turkish state through the bond of citizenship is a turk . 
  i try to consider all sides of a story . 
  in this case , i really do n't like the turkish narrative . 
  yeah , why do these bothersome kurds refuse to integrate in a state that does n't even recognise them as a nation !, 
  i completely understand germany is not comfortable with other countries with apparent illiberal tendencies sitting on the gas pipe and being able directly or indirectly influence the supply , but i fear bypassing them , as with ns2 , will do nothing but strengthen their siege mentality . 
  i do n't think the problem is germany ( and other states ) diversifying their supply , it 's ee states feeling they 've been deserted and hung out to dry . 
  in that case i envision more episodes with kaczynski , orban , et al. 
  nice !, 
  i like that it retains what i assume is the original metric structure . 
  if i may build on that : * here three control the sea . 
  the moon , the wind , and we . 
  ah , indeed !, 
  [ google translate ] ( https://translate.google.de/#nl/en/hier%20gaan%20over%20het%20tij ) read `` over het '' pretty believably sort of as two syllables , so i was n't sure . 
  then may it be * rule over * , 
  here control the sea : the moon , the wind and we . 
  seems like communism has ceased sounding sufficiently scary . 
  they should make anti-polders to compensate . 
  meme ( ` i_should_cat . jpg ' , ' i should subscribe to more government agency newsletters . ' ), 
  i do n't get , though , why some of the leaked data , such as the the data on people in witness-relocation programmes , was even available to the transport agency in the first place . 
  transparency is a good enough a reason . 
  there 's little sense in treating wine like some secret military matter . 
  so , the oenologist in me supports further bickering . 
  dis means var !, 
  * pours ~ ~ champagne ~ ~ sparkling wine in a gutter *, 
  oh no , so italy also has a dog in this fight ? 
  maybe we should call on some french guy then -- again . 
  so , is teran a wine variety or a grapevine variety ? 
  because that 's pretty much the gist of the dispute , as far as i can see . 
  can some sommelier weigh in ? 
  preferably one not from croatia or slovenia ... maybe some impartial italian expert . 
  slavic bear forces 200 french sheep to flee in panic . 
  this is just an excuse used by alphabet to protect the special snowflake arier 's feelings . 
  conspiracy !, 
  by this line of reasoning , kurds are within their rights to make `` war happen '' and if they defeated the turkish forces , the land would rightfully belong to the kurds . 
  i think such a view is too optimistic . 
  i think many people have other things to do than to read foreign press . 
  and many pis voters probably discount the media critical of the party as * l\u00fcgenpresse * or whatever the equivalent polish expression is . 
  i do n't think people easily step out of the bubble . 
  in a way the turkish opposition can be thankful for erdo\u011fan for how he helped improve their image abroad -- nowadays everything that is wrong with turkey is generally ascribed to akp , while in fact the minorities have been repressed since the founding of the republic . 
  ironically , erdo\u011fan , for a time at least , actually slightly improved the situation for the kurds ( e.g. 
  briefly letting a few schools teach kurdish ) . 
  in short : repression can not be blamed just on the ruling party . 
  well , southerners ' corruption is disorganised and takes place between natural persons , while germans conduct corruption in an organised manner on the corporate level , as befits civilised peoples . 
  is anyone keeping a tally ? 
  2 for frankfurt , 1 for dublin so far if the article has complete info . 
  can confirm , the socialist republic of slovenia is quite rainy . 
  ( not like it 's terribly important in this case ) otherwise , i 'm not sure if this is r/dataisbeautiful or r/dataisugly . 
  both probably . 
  it does beautifully present the whole picture . 
  he knows how to properly dispose of waste oil . 
  10/10 -- would award him citizenship . 
  really ? 
  the us supreme court justices can be ** replaced ** ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  those dirty socialists !, 
  also , what percentage are the netherlands at ? 
  i have a feeling they have some catching up to do . 
  seize the means of production and all that . 
  poland is not a totally foreign nation , though ; it is a part of the union it entered willingly and is subject to its rules . 
  and i thought it 's about the tories . 
  verily , that comment is like a verbal rorschach ink blot . 
  hopefully it wo n't . 
  they should drop all such pretensions . 
  i do n't think it 's even exclusively their fault that their identity is at the ` expense ' of others . 
  since their ancestors settled in the region of macedonia , since they lived in that region , that 's how they 've been called before nations even formed , right ? 
  i do n't think it 's correct to see them as consciously stealing the name . 
  but they should definitely stop trying to construct the identity around the ancient macedonians . 
  this seems a sensible compromise . 
  would you then also be ok with the people up north by extension calling themselves vardar macedonians ? 
  what are you even trying to say ? 
  * whom * can only be used for objects .
