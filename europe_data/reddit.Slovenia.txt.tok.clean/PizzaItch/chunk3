  suddenly i 'm an erdofan, 
  if only it were possible `` to serve [ the ] society , to increase welfare , to ensure peace in society , to serve the society 's needs '' without this big jihad . 
  well , everything is up for interpretation ; since you were wondering , i just wanted to point out that your comment * does * read like you 're ranking criminal acts to more than one person -- and in an order inverse to the usual . 
  this is a tricky one . 
  if growing a few pots of marijuana is considered a criminal act , i 'm somewhat reluctant to respond with a resounding `` yes '' . 
  but i do agree anyone who injures , damages or endangers another person or another person 's property should be prosecuted , yes . 
  i 'm not defending the vandals in the video . 
   [ ... ] committing multiple violent crimes and ** even ** stealing [ ... ] emphasis added . 
  * even * is used before something extreme or surprising . 
  and , no , a crime is not a crime : e.g. 
  a misdemeanour is not equal to a felony . 
  i do n't think the wages even need to rise for workers to be in part or fully replaced by automation . 
  automation will only get cheaper , while minimum wages in eastern europe already are at roughly poverty levels . 
  there is n't much room for manoeuvre to compete by decreasing the cost of labour . 
  i think the problem is mostly due to everything from criticism of the eu all the way to outright opposition to the eu being labelled as * eurosceptics * . 
  just like the slovene ( united ) left , podemos appear rather sceptical towards the eu in its current form and are probably rightly described as such . 
  what imo is n't rightly described as euro * sceptics * are parties such as ukip . 
  the bastei is a rock formation towering 194 metres above the elbe river in the elbe sandstone mountains of germany . 
  ( [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bastei ) ), 
  are . . are you saying trickle-down economics do n't work ? 
  well , unless one wants a depopulated and poor eastern europe , * something * will have to be done in the not too distant future , as with increasing automation , the only `` advantage '' that makes eastern europe attractive , the low wages , will erode , while at the same time the bright minds who could work in industries with higher added value will continue to emigrate to regions with higher wages . 
  and if they decide to persevere in their home country and found a moderately successful company , as soon as the company starts to show promise , they 'll be acquired by some multinational with the seat most certainly not in eastern europe . 
  but i do n't think anything will done . 
  eastern europe is doomed to lag behind the rest of europe , wealthy just enough to be an important market for western goods and to provide educated workforce for western companies . 
  among others , the [ hooligans against salafists ] ( https://www.heise.de/tp/news/und-wer-war-noch-so-im-schwarzen-block-in-hamburg-3770308.html ) , a well-known far-left organisation / s, 
  only for the purpose of criticism . 
  i think it all boils down to two questions : * are inhabitants of richer regions willing to finance social services for inhabitants of poorer regions ( in practice : would e.g. 
  germans find it acceptable to finance greek healthcare and pensions ? ), 
  * are members of smaller nations willing to accept two or three larger nations having as many votes as the other dozen or so both in the lower and upper house ? 
  ideally nationalism would n't matter , but simply forming a republic would n't make nationalism disappear . 
  personally , i think further integration ca n't come soon enough , but proclaiming a republic would just garner too strong a backlash from eurosceptics . 
  not to mention i find it hard to to imagine the current member states all agreeing on it . 
  if any such integration happens , it will be between a subset of the current eu member states . 
  the weather is rather dry which makes it somewhat less unbearable ... right ? 
  i guess he wanted to fit in with the slavs ? 
  maybe because this is an announcement and not a discussion ? 
  if you wanted to start a discussion of r/europe here , your post would probably more often than not be drowned by other posts , so imo the current solution is fine . 
  after 24hrs , we should do a `` swell mods of europe '' series . 
  kidding ; i do n't like this type of posts that much . 
  i do like seeing an occasional photo from around europe , but the oh-we-have-that-too-lemme-share knee-jerk reactions that flood the place with theatres , churches , toilets , presidents , what-have-you are annoying . 
  maybe a limit of 1 post per `` x of europe '' category per day could solve that ? 
  yeah , it 's easy to compare the eu net neutrality with the us and say we have it good , but we should n't get carried away -- it could be better . 
  imo , offering such data free services is n't unlike microsoft bundling ie with windows -- i.e. 
  unfair competition . 
  ** wir regieren machtbetrunken ** ^ ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ ^ govern ^ ^ ^ ^ drunk ^ ^ ^ ^ from ^ ^ ^ ^ power, 
  with such mountains , they can into europe . 
  armenia , too . 
  azerbaijan though ... not sure . 
  well , who would have thought . 
  so it was quite intentional and not just a poor choice for a rhetorical device . 
  what a relief -- i was so worried about my reading comprehension , 
  getting hammered in the city centre on a friday night is a mass event . 
  soon to be everywhere indeed -- one is reportedly to be built in ljubljana . 
  i assume they prefer to go to an ikea store in the netherlands . 
  a collection of soundbites with an overly dramatic trailer music . 
  hardly a speech . 
  yeah , we 've already gone through the outrage-reason-meh cycle with this story from another source earlier today . 
  what 's that ? 
  something one can eat ? 
  seriously , however , i do n't know as there 's no ikea yet in slovenia and the one or two times i visited it in germany , i was n't paying much attention to prices , sorry . 
  i do n't think it 's just the food market . 
  if you compare the products ' pricing labels in multinational retailers like h&m , tedi , kik , etc. , a progression like the following is not unusual : de : 5 $ a : 6 $ cz , hu , sl , sk : 7 $, 
  i see this comment as a -- rightful !, 
  -- criticism of my comment as well , although it probably was n't intended as such , so let me add that the date i wrote is misleading in that e.g. 
  bulgarian association process began [ about a decade earlier ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/agreements-conventions/agreement/?aid=1993009 ) . 
  but i doubt many paid much attention to that at the time . 
  `` another two poor countries are exactly what the eu needs right now . '', 
  -- quite a few people , circa 2005, 
  oh , i 'm not against their retaining existing concessions , i.e. 
  remaining outside schengen , retaining the pound and the contribution rebate and so on , but i think granting the uk further exclusive concessions would just open a can of worms as it may be seen that throwing a tantrum may net you benefits . 
  not good for co-operation . 
  that 's why i think there should be some framework for any further exemptions so they would n't be available just to one member state -- perhaps making further integration an opt-in , effectively a two-speed eu . 
  i do see a problem . 
  the uk already had concessions and i do n't think it should receive further preferential treatment just to keep it in . 
  the only way uk could stay , is , in my opinion , if a two-speed eu becomes a reality , with uk staying on the sidelines with the v4 and other eurosceptical countries , otherwise we 're bound to tread water indefinitely . 
  no , you 're illustrating the offence the use of an independence movement flag causes to a offence caused by using a nazi flag . 
  i think the implication is clear . 
  these catalonians must be real big scumbags to deserve it . 
  found a spaniard !, 
  comparing an independence movement and nazis . 
  way to go , dude . 
  oh , may i answer ? 
  further suppression of regional identity . 
  dude , wolfenstein is not an accurate portrayal of the 3rd reich . 
   thought nordic people were made of ice or some such this sounds so ridiculous i 'm itching to read more about it . 
  got some interesting source ? 
  maybe so , but i 'd expect that through superior science they would have developed an approach with bigger emphasis on sustainability . 
  yeah , german systematic , ` rational ' approach to matters such as human society yielded terrific results . 
  ^ ( yup , from zero to godwin in roughly 60 minutes ), 
  that 's ok -- we 'll draw them a map showing them how to avoid the roads requiring these toll stickers . 
  8 people/m ^ 2 is like front-rows-in-a-rock-concert tight ( well , excluding the first three or four rows ) ; looking at the photo , i 'd say there more like 5 or 5,5 people per m ^ 2 . 
  you can compare [ here ] ( http://www.gkstill.com/support/crowd-density/625sm/density4.html ) with a modelled crowd density . 
  what 's even the purpose of this whole campaign ? 
  has orban 's popularity been falling before that ? 
   the president of the european commission jean-claude juncker has also expressed his shock about the riots [ ... saying ] constructive politics can only be shaped by those `` who together build something , not those who are driven to destruction by rage '' . 
  but ... is it at all possible to constructively smash capitalism ? 
  it 's truly shameful how these anarchists go about injuring police officers ' knuckles !, 
  i say no , therefore i will downvote you . 
  then i think restoration would be just the thing for you . 
  you could thus work to bring conservative biedermeier art back to its former fame .
