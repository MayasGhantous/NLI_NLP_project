  umm ... maybe we can pitch in for tuition for a private art school ? 
  actually , * ro\u017enik * is june ; july is * mali srpan * . 
  also , while slovene does n't usually use accent marks , they may be used when necessary/helpful . 
  considering this level of competence , the number of injuries among the police force does n't seem that high . 
  as far as it concerns minorities , erdogan and kemalists really are n't all that different . 
  * mein gott , he 's mansplaining again . 
  if at the time of the attack , they were in the car or otherwise endangered , i suppose they could , but i doubt sniping the vandals from an apartment would constitute self-defence . 
  the left 2/5 of the relief : assassin 's creed : communist revolution, 
  will be interesting to see which bands support discrimination and sexism . 
  yay , slovenia can into ~ ~ central ~ ~ western europe !, 
  got ta increase that gdp in any way possible , i guess . 
  marginal gains . 
  not at all surprised about germany . 
  as someone who drinks exclusively tap water , the complete absence of public drinking fountains there is disappointing . 
   turin-ljubljana-budapest with all the hills we have here , they better get some drilling equipment down here too , otherwise it 'll be `` medium '' - speed at best . 
  people wishing people who wish for others to get shot be stabbed should be patted on their back .

  i believe the development of the latter name was : tergeste --  trst, 
  it 's a flag both of [ the eu and the council of europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_europe ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure switzerland is part of the latter . 
  i do n't think hungary can be sensibly divided into smaller regions ; it 's too centralised . 
  i condemn it , too . 
  it 's not like we 're talking about statues of stalin . 
  i think it 's generally disrespectful to remove statues , especially those commemorating fallen soldiers . 
  as usual in matters concerning dealing with remnants of undemocratic ideologies , countries would do well to take germany as an example . 
  there such monuments have typically been furnished with plaques with a short art-historical and historical critique and a warning against the dangers of militarism and ideology . 
  it 's a much better solution than removing all the traces of the past . 
  the lower house looks pragmatic . 
  pretty much what i expected from the dutch . 
  denying the spd the political advantage , while at the same time retaining conservative voters . 
  seems as though she 'll be chancellor for life . 
  spadios confirmed . 
  it 's as if when writing the title , the op searched for buzzwords and selected a wrong one . 
  the law limits free speech . 
  i see nothing about abolishing anonymity in this article .

  now i 'm seriously impressed by his knowledge of technology . 
  just no . 
  does not compute in my head . 
  no love for [ these two ] ( http://novilist.hr/var/novilist/storage/images/_aliases/fb_friendly_img/komentari/kolumne/komentar-drazena-cigleneckog/da-sporazum-racan-drnovsek-bio-je-najbolje-rjesenje/6842230-1-cro-hr/da-sporazum-racan-drnovsek-bio-je-najbolje-rjesenje.jpg ) , i see ;( i wonder which wine they drank . 
  would be ironic if it was teran . 
  i do n't think i 'll be visiting the croatian coast . 
  i 'm not the seaside-holidays type . 
  does that count ? 
  such a video being posted right now was completely unexpected . 
  and by / u/trogz1 no less . 
  it was a clash of expectations , i suppose . 
  for slovenia for whatever reason this access to the high seas became a sacred thing . 
  she looked to her neighbour croatia and saw how abundant with water she was and said to herself : surely i can reason with my friend croatia so she gives me a tiny access to high seas . 
  she asked , but croatia was unmoved . 
  at the roughly the same time , slovenia was negotiating the eu accession , it was not all smooth sailing , and before she was allowed to join , she had to bow to multiple demands , such as the one made by italy to change its legislation regarding real estate . 
  but in the end she appeased the eu and joined . 
  later , when it was croatia 's turn , slovenia said to herself : now i am european , this is my chance , i 'll do as europeans do . 
  unfortunately croatia expected a helping friend and was sorely disappointed . 
  seriously though , the actions of both states regarding the border dispute have been far from commendable . 
  i listened to the reading of the tribunal decision and at one point a depressing realisation struck me : we 're still so incapable of co-operation we have to get some french , british and german septuagenarians to draw the borders for us . 
  hm , yeah , i can understand why it 's seen as blackmailing , though i think such sentiments are a bit too strong for what slovenia did . 
  of course i 'm biased , but i do n't think slovenia 's interest in being granted this corridor ever significantly disadvantaged croatia . 
  hey , it 's not slovenia 's fault croatian double agents orchestrated this cheating affair !, 
  yes , i 'm being sarcastic . 
  i am very much disappointed in what happened . 
  good guy croatia , snooping on judges in the interest of ensuring the integrity of the court . 
  you got the timeline mixed up : slovenia blocked croatia mainly because of its disinterest in resolving the border dispute . 
  it did n't become a point of contention as a consequence of the blockade . 
  actually , according to the article [ 7 ( 2 ) ] ( http://www.vlada.si/fileadmin/dokumenti/si/projekti/2010/arbitrazni_sporazum/_10.b_arbitra_216ni_sporazum_slo_.pdf ) of the arbitration agreement , the arbitration decision is legally binding and final , croatia 's withdrawal and interpretation notwithstanding . 
  italian air force is our undercover foreign legion . 
  they just do n't know it yet . 
  maybe we should swap places with slovaks . 
  i 'm all for it if they agree . 
  just think about it -- two birds with one stone : you get slovaks for neighbours and prevent slovenes from accessing the open seas . 
  no idea where you head that because every official has been saying otherwise . 
  slovenia will accept and implement the decision , whatever it is . 
  we 're sick and tired of the whole matter and want it finally resolved .

  triggered !, 
  ugh , that impact font . 
  calling it `` d-day '' is rather cringeworthy . 
  i expect nothing less from cerar . 
  well , there 's honour among thieves . 
  i do feel bad about making this joke . ), 
  man , i envy those in unionised professions . 
  sadly some -- mostly those typically practised by freelancers , i guess -- do n't have this benefit . 
  indeed , it 's not how trademarks work . 
  but i think with the privilege of exclusive use should also come some responsibilities towards the consumer . 
  i see no reason why trademarks should exist solely for the benefit of corporations , especially since consumers clearly expect consistent quality of products . 
   coke or snickers have different ingredients depending on the country , but they 're still coke and snickers . 
  i bet you 'd be pretty pissed off if you though you 've bought coke but instead got diet coke , though . 
  if the ingredients are different , the products should be marketed as different -- as eastern europe coke and eastern europe snickers ... or whatever , but not under the same trademark . 
  the fast and the furious : minsk drift coming to a street light near you . 
  that 's not terribly nice . 
  the mods should release the name under a copyleft licence so we can use it . 
  and it 's also kinda fitting if you imagine him having stolen the ring from gulen ( ok , no resemblance to frodo here ) and now triumphantly and wildly dancing around in mount doom .

  getting blown up by islamists or kurds would be one of the least concerns for me . 
  i 'm more worried i could n't resist comparing a certain head of state to a certain lotr character and the consequences it might entail . 
  * channels rutte * populism is all right , if it 's the right kind of populism . 
  yeah , people really are often quicker to downvote than to debate things . 
  on the other hand , if you 'd phrased it along the lines `` the currency that amounts to 2/3 of foreign exchange reserves '' , it probably would n't be quite as controversial . 
  either way , hopefully it wo n't put you off commenting in the future .
