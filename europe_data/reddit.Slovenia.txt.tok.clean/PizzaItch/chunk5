  in dollars !, 
  [ triggered ], 
  this kinda correlates with the dialect distribution in croatia . 
  maybe you guys should adopt kajkavian as the official one instead of \u0160tokavian to make your country more liberal . 
  you know it sounds sensible . 
  exactly . 
  we were there first . 
  motorists , get off our roads and get your own !, 
  we 'll gladly relieve you by taking some eu institutions off your hands , if you want . 
  did n't know there were that many greenpeace activists . 
  seriously though , wtf was that ? 
  looks almost like a construction site . 
  with graphs like these i always wonder : does innovation bring prosperity ... or is prosperity a prerequisite for innovation ? 
  what is it with you americans calling slightly elevated slopes hills ? 
  besides , it 's just a convoluted way to say * 1810 ad * . 
  yes , * ad * means * year of our lord * . 
  a bank holiday ? 
  what are you -- a bloody marxist ? 
  not the way i see it . 
  nord stream gives russia a tool to pressure ee with gas prices , therefore ee will have to be * more * friendly towards russia . 
  it 's pushing ee into the russian sphere of influence , not making it chose between the eu and russia . 
  til the germans are monkeys ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ feel ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ need ^ ^ ^ to [ ^ ^ ^ explain ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ non-german ^ ^ ^ speakers ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inselaffe ), 
  if only there were some way to remove such imbeciles from the government ... 
  * / s reuters is objectively reporting on the criticism of her comments that appear to defend the anti-migrant policy . 
  i really do n't see any reason to question the quality of journalism here . 
  smart of them to give it up . 
  why go to all the trouble of developing and maintaining weapons for mad when you can just booby trap a few banks for equally effective deterrence . 
  yeah , i think i 'm gon na take scandinavia off my bucket list right now . 
  i 'm pretty sure that was melenchon , yeah . 
  hamon was mostly advocating things such as ubi and robot tax , not hardocre socialism . 
  anyway , i do n't know about his * glasses * , but i liked his platform . 
  even if it was somewhat idealistic , at least he was thinking in the right direction . 
  edit : i 'd like to add that -- as far as i remember -- only the french overseas territories would join alba , not france itself . 
  to go against the clearly expressed will of the majority of the voters ? 
  unless you mean he 's * never * supported pr -- or any improvement of the current fptp system -- in which case i agree with you . 
  why should he , though ? 
  you had a referendum on that just 6 years ago and decided to keep the current form of ftpt with 2/3 of voters voting in favour . 
  it 's not a problem that it 's arbitrary . 
  adoption of * any * numeral system is arbitrary and `` base n '' is just a concept or practice that makes it easier to count things by placing an agreed number of things in a group -- in base 10 this many things : | | | | | | | | | | , and in base 12 this many things : | | | | | | | | | | | | . 
  ( in either system this group would be labelled as 10 , i.e. 
  1 whole group 0 individual things outside the group ) . 
  the benefits of base 12 are that you can equally divide the items in the group in many different ways without getting remnants . 
  imagine you go camping with your friend ( s ) and take two six packs of beer -- effectively a dozen , one whole unit in dozenal . 
  if you want to divide them equally among yourselves , you can do thusly ( arabic numbers indicate how many people are present ; where the notation diverges , they 're separated by a slash with decimal on the left and dozenal on the right ) : 1 : | | | | | | | | | | | | 2 : | | | | | | | | | | | | 3 : | | | | | | | | | | | | 4 : | | | | | | | | | | | | 5 : problem !, 
  you 'll either have to share a can ( yuck ! ), 
  or get less beer 6 : | | | | | | | | | | | | 7 : problem 8 : problem 9 : problem 10/x : problem 11/e : problem 12/10 : | | | | | | | | | | | | yes , you get problems in quite a few cases , however , if you had a 10-pack ( i.e. 
  one whole group in base 10 ) , you 'd already run into problems at 3 persons . 
  now , as i said in the post above , these benefits probably do n't warrant switching to dozenal , but in isolation ( so ignoring which system is widely used and the number of fingers we have ) the dozenal system offers more benefits . 
  well , unless you have four friends . 
  in this case , invite one more and problem solved . 
  is this a serious question ? 
  to point out how arbitrary the choice of our numeral system is . 
  other than our typically having 10 fingers , there really is no good reason for using base 10 . 
  i 'm surprised by all the downvotes i 'm getting , to be frank . 
  and i find it quite ironic to think quite a few must have come from patriots whose language ( s ) still use some remains of non-base 10 counting systems , e.g. 
  base 20 . 
  * quatre-vingt-six * , anyone ? 
  i 'm not sure if german orthographic conventions carry over to english , though . 
  if it 's too much to expect from journalists to learn how to type an \u00e4 , then surely it 's impossible for them to learn such rules . 
  not me . 
  i 'm missing a finger so , accordingly , i do all calculations in base 9 . 
  now * this * is a good question . 
  i 'm not really an ardent proponent of either so ca n't say for certain but ... 
  i think the most attractive point of the dozenal system over base 16 is that it was used and there still are some remnants of its use ( 12 inches in a foot , the expression * dozen * alone ) , whereas i do n't know of any examples of base 16 being used in the past . 
  but from the viewpoint of divisibility , base 16 certainly is superior * . 
  the real king , of course , is base 2 . 
  but somewhat unpractical for general use . 
  edit : * actually , division by 3 can be quite often handy , so i 'm not so sure about the superiority of base 16 over 12 in that regard either edit 2 : oops , noticed i jumped right to the 2nd part of the question , sorry . 
  thank you , other responders , for providing good answers, 
  this is a strange argument . 
  it 's equivalent to saying : `` we use the imperial system , therefore it 's the best . '', 
  ... for decimal notation . 
  whether decimal is the best , though , i 'm not convinced . 
  dozenal seems attractive . 
  but it 's probably too late to switch . 
  i thought you guys spoke a slavic language ? 
  now , * this * is a substantial benefit , yes . 
  thank you . 
  i 'm glad southern europe has something going for it . 
  yeah , at least in slovenia floods are frequent in spring and autumn . 
  you 're right on the historical importance of mountains , i forgot about that as i was mostly thinking of the current situation where they 're there mostly to look pretty and make construction of infrastructure costly . 
  that 's not a bonus , other than for tourism , imo . 
  maybe it 's just me but i get lethargic when temperatures exceed 25 \u00b0 c. 
  and i think any savings for heating might soon be offset by the costs for air conditioning . 
  climate change , seismic hazard , uninhabitable and impassable mountains and of course the very exposed position to migrant waves ... 
  it got me thinking : is there * any * geographical/environmental aspect where the south of europe * does n't * have it worse than the north ? 
  maybe annual precipitation ? 
  but in comparison that seems rather insignificant , as it 's the lowest exactly when you 'd need it , and becoming sparser and unpredictable . 
  you mean artistic interventions by independent concerned patriots , surely ? 
  oh , i claim no expertise in the area either . 
  though considering sarmatians were supposedly largely nomadic , i guess it 's more likely it was a slavic place of worship . 
  however , the region * is * considered as having been populated by sarmatians . 
  as for germanic -- who knows ; the goths trekked pretty much over all the europe , so it 's possible , i suppose . 
  why not sarmatian ? 
  as soon as the uk leaves , we can finally start moaning about * those eastern europeans , taking our money * . 
  yesss , we can do it !, 
  seems the mediterranean folk was * made * for climate change . 
  in the room it 's 26 \u00b0 c and i 'm sitting in front of the computer barefooted , in trainer trousers ( not adidas !, 
  and it 's cotton !, 
  we slovenes are * different * ) and a t-shirt ...
