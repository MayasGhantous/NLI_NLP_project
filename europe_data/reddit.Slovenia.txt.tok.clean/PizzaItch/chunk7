  also , some want a stronger welfare state ( these are generally more sympathetic towards yugoslavia ) , some want a more liberal one ( they almost as a rule see independence a s a good thing ) , few are satisfied with the current state of the affairs . 
   67 percent of germans see nato as positive  if ee needed being defended , 53 percent of germans would n't honour the treaty what gives ? 
  interestingly , 65 % think the us would defend them in case of emergency . 
  it seems as if nato is only seen as beneficial insofar it guarantees direct protection . 
  mutuality , though ? 
  not as far as i see it ; most people are bashing germany here because according to the poll the majority of germans think their state should n't honour the agreement if the article 5 were to be triggered . 
  the percentage of gdp committed to the military is completely irrelevant in this case . 
  yeah , figures ... heil hitler , defender of europe , paragon of virtue , protector against vaccinations , visionary anti-nwo freedom fighter and patron saint of mentally challenged , i guess . 
  i think , and am worried , that two disparate groups of people understand this clip very differently and like for completely different reasons ... 
  what else should he write , though ? 
  a cryptic analysis [ a la melenchon ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6cvji2/jeanluc_m%c3%a9lenchons_reaction_to_the_terrorist/ ) ? 
   so they ~ ~ must be ~ ~ had been doing something right ftfy, 
  haha , this one is actually great . 
  this video must be from an alternate reality where \u017di\u017eek decided to work more on his delivery and ditched philosophy for stand-up comedy . 
  ( or possibly north-west croat or slovenian ha , turns out we 're not mountain croats , we 're actually mountain serbs !, 
  i do n't think it 's the only primeval forest in europe ( there may be some reason it 's classified as such that i 'm not aware of , but it may be just sloppy journalism ) ; as far as i know there are [ other ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_old-growth_forests#eurasia ) . 
  but it is the largest primeval forest in europe that i know of and loss of any such habitat is an irrepairable tragedy . 
  european equivalent of the one-drop rule : got immigrant ancestors ? 
  you 're an immigrant !, 
  unless you 're the majority ethnic group , of course . 
  hey , sweden , why do n't you , like switzerland , phase out your nuclear power plants and switch to 100 % renewables ? 
  you guys also have enough water ... right ? 
  well , til ... 
  interesting , thanks !, 
  he probably has the same view of scotland , too , huh ? 
  what 's such an autonomous region other than an annexed colony , though ? 
  i think catalans will eventually be forced to take their case to the un anyway , so we 'll get to see if it really does n't apply . 
  some rights -- such as human rights and the right to self-determination -- are inalienable and can not -- or at least should not , since in practice they often are -- be withed , democratically or otherwise . 
  i really feel bad for catalonian independists . 
  i doubt independence from spain is the best idea , and far be it from me to encourage it , but catalans should have the right to decide and if a significant majority of citizens decide for independence , i think their decision should bloody well be respected . 
  i see nothing refuting the existence of the right to self-determination . 
  and the text says `` all peoples '' not `` all peoples living in colonies '' , so it * is * universal . 
  the only somewhat contentious point is that the principle of territorial integrity may limit this right , that 's debatable . 
  if catalonia were already truly free , it could declare independence . 
  suuuuure there is n't . 
   all peoples have the right to self-determination ; by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic , social and cultural development . 
  [ un general assembly resolution 1514 ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/united_nations_general_assembly_resolution_1514 ), 
  no , roughly 80 % of those that cared enough about the decision to show up to vote decided for independence . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalan_self-determination_referendum,_2014 ), 
  i really , * really * like it . 
  but then again , i know a bit of latin , so i 'm predisposed to , i guess . 
  i like the lyrics much better than schiller 's . 
  his is a nice poem , but it 's also an ode to * friendship * , so as an asocial neckbeardy redditor , i kind of feel excluded . 
  * sniff * . 
  this one is better . 
  in theory an anthem without lyrics is fine for representative purposes , but if you want to sing it , you need lyrics . 
  making latin lyrics official would be good , because it 's a neutral language . 
  and its being rather pretentious is a bonus . 
  addendum : just this * fides * bothers me a bit , but i guess it could be taken to mean `` loyalty '' , `` trust '' ... 
  and it seems , to stay rich , you 'd have to convert them to cents . 
  partition of turkey coming up !, 
  her neighbour slovakia is already sharpening her knife ... 
  yeah , do n't pat each other on the back too much , though , there are quite a few europeans who still think he 's totally rad . 
  they should n't . 
  it would be very much wrong . 
  but , sadly , in this mad world , i do n't find it out of the realm of possibility for some government to pass such a law . 
  sure , germany would be one of the least likely countries to do this , but still . 
  i consider the title unnecessarily ( well , except for the main purpose -- click baiting ) ambiguous . 
   the german parliament has passed legislation making it easier to deport ** failed ** asylum seekers [ ... ] ( emphasis added ) misleading title much ? 
  i think you 're onto something . 
  i suppose one of the main reasons why i identify as european is exactly because it 's an abstract identity based on values ( and i would argue history and culture , too ! ), 
  i share with people of different nations . 
  i find that preferrable to the deep , organic , primal nationalism . 
  they 're * persons * . 
  legal persons . 
  they 're probably your typical uni-going german . 
  renting a cheap student apartment , receiving a modest financial support of a few hundred euros a month from their parents and maybe working 10 -- 20 hours a week at a job that actually pays enough for basic needs . 
  as well as it could be reasonably expected , really . 
  actually , i take that back ; considering smc is projected to actually keep some seats in 2018 , i guess this third time , the newbies are actually only doing half bad . 
  they still have time to change that , of course . 
  i guess i should provide a brief explanation of the totally-new-politics ^ ( tm ) phenomenon in slovenia if anyone is wondering what we 're gossiping about , though . 
  ok , here it goes : 2008 saw the formation of a new government , in which a junior partner was zares , which was formed about a year earlier after splitting with lds . 
  in 2011 elections , zares did n't make the cut . 
  that year 's elections were won by the newly-formed ps , which in the next , 2014 , elections also did n't win any seats . 
  that year the elections were won by a newly-formed smc . 
  if the latest popularity poll is to go by , in the next elections , they 're set to lose about 60 % of their current seats . 
  also interestingly , all of these parties occupy ( ed ) pretty much the same position on the political spectrum : the so-called centre left ( though i personally consider them centre right , because slovenes tend to call anything that is n't conservative * left * , and these newbies certainly were n't socialist , but that 's another story ... ) . 
  i 've been living in such a strange world for like a decade already . 
  get with the times !, 
  britain : `` screw you guys , this party sucks ! '', 
  * britain kicks over a garden gnome on her way out . 
  * britain : `` ha !, 
  tough negotiations ! '', 
  make better car parts . 
  i think [ this ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/merkel-as-hitler/a-16753456 ) is what he was referring to . 
  come at me !, 
  and stop sticking meat where it do n't belong , you burek-defiler !, 
  * flings some \u010devap\u010di\u010di *, 
  burek * is love , burek is life ^ ( * applies to burek with ricotta filling ; if it contains apples , it 's strudel , and if it contains meat , it 's unpalatable ), 
  with * spitzenkandidaten * we already kind of , de facto , do this . 
  at least in the last election it was made quite clear either juncker or schulz would be the president of the european commision if their party wins . 
  then just call it submontana . 
  how can we know that 's not just someone with impressive hair sitting behind him ? 
  hmm , it appears to be rather ... vacuous . 
  yes , he is . 
  expect to hear more ( than you 'd ever want to hear ) from him in the upcoming months . 
  he 's one of the presidential candidates . 
  yet again . 
  nyet , this one is ours , comrade . 
  you 're totally asking me to ruin the joke !,
