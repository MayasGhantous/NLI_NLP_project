  that is because i assume quite a few that have been upvoting this have though i 'm only being sarcastic about the fact that a map purportedly showing ce states stretches waaay to the east , but i 'm also poking fun at a certain [ serbian catchphrase ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/srbija_do_tokija ) . 
  yes , tokyo is rightful serbian clay !, 
  this `` educational '' video has been provided to you by prager `` university '' . 
  umm ... this map is missing tokyo . 
  but countries can co-operate within several different frameworks and groups . 
  this does n't preclude austria co-operating with germany , or the baltic with the nordic states or slovenia , romania , croatia and bulgaria with other ~ ~ balkan ~ ~ southeast european states , and so on . 
  i do n't see why austria should n't be included , if it 's her desire to participate . 
  wise or not , it 's a dick move , even if all the documents are genuine . 
  make europe great again !, 
  the * visegrad : intermarium * expansion it is then !, 
  eh , the same old `` the tourists we get are n't spending enough money '' . 
  i understand the frustration with being overrun with tourists that want nothing more than snap some pictures at a few landmarks and hit a few cheap bars , but i doubt historic centres would be more livable without tourists . 
  i guess this says more about your news sources than about the spread of this story ; apart from the usual suspects , it 's also been reported by the bbc and the guardian , so i do n't think i 've made a huge overstatement , especially considering there are currently two hot topics about it on this sub alone with over 1000 comments between them , packed with people calling juncker an idiot , a drunkard , a disgrace and so on . 
  heh , excellent trolling on his part , i think . 
  you mean the whole speech about `` english losing importance '' ? 
  there is none . 
  he made a snide remark in the introduction -- one sentence -- before switching to more serious matters and the entire anglosphere goes balistic . 
  this is the speech : http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_speech-17-1238_en.htm [ edit : trigger warning : it 's , well , mostly in french ], 
  all these notwithstanding , he 's a class a troll . 
  i 'm warming up to him . 
  you 're not seriously expecting it to be scaffolding-free after completion ? 
  ho , no ; that 's when restoration works start !, 
  i do n't think this is an exclusively spanish thing , though . 
  the way colours are used is useful to more clearly display small differences between the scores . 
  it would n't be useful to have all the countries coloured purple . 
  i do agree with other points , though . 
  given the narrow differences , i think you 'd need at least 2000 representative participants per country for somewhat reliable results . 
  a similar law is being used to great effect in russia ... 
  easily explainable : black people are usually not ex-yugoslavian , there we do n't hate 'em . 
  simple . 
  this is * problematic * . 
  if he brought in an `` albanian flag '' it would n't be such a problem , but the flag on display is * also * a flag of another , foreign state . 
  not a good move . 
  are there no symbols of albanian culture that are n't used by the state of albania that he could have used ? 
  hmm , it seems we do n't quite agree on what * monoculturalism * means . 
  to me it 's `` striving to make residents of a country all share one ( * mono - * ! ), 
  culture '' . 
  sure , slovene culture is dominant in slovenia , but having a dominant culture does not yet mean a country is monocultural . 
  all of them ? 
  i seriously ca n't think of any european country where all its inhabitants shared one single culture or identity . 
  just take slovenia for example : it has always been to one degree or another a mix of cultures -- slovene , german , italian , croatian , jewish , hungarian , roma , etc. 
  also , i find it curious you have mentioned mexico and india as good examples of non-ethnic nationalism ( i agree ) , yet seem to have a strong dislike for multicultural states . 
  they 're not monocultural states . 
  though , i do concede , mexico has a strong dominant culture , there are also many indigenous cultures ( afaik , protected by the constitution , no less ) , and to me india is the prime example of a multicultural state . 
  oh , you 're right , i misread it 's for a 3-yeah period . 
  which still would n't be much , but a good start , imo . 
  this is indeed far from * proper * taxation . 
  it appears as if where there is a will , there can actually be proper taxation . 
  umm , if the greek court acts independently from the greek state , i think you guys have a problem . 
  state = parliament + judiciary + government ( ideally at least ), 
  did n't know the greeks were such big fans of naruto . 
  [ sculpture by edoardo tresoldi at st maria di siponto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asdfuqptwq8 ) is providing some basic info along with the picture really so hard ? 
  i 'd rather see working hours reduced to e.g. 
  6 hrs a day , thus avoiding the issue of where to find extra funding for all the pensioners . 
  * kicked out ? 
  sanctioned ? 
  well , hello , eurasian union !, 
  do n't get your hopes up . 
  you can bet , however , that sch\u00e4uble wo n't change his stance anytime soon . 
  not before the elections , at any rate . 
  of course . 
  given the gravity of the case , the president will probably personally lead the investigation . 
  then thank god state-sponsored thugs are keeping an eye on him ... 
  i do n't think many germans outside the cdu/csu and afd would agree religion and patriotism are ~ ~ one ~ ~ two of the ten most important pillars of german culture . 
  i also do n't think coming up with such a list is the best `` invitation to a discussion '' , i think it 's mostly done to court far-right voters with little desire for any further discussion after the elections . 
  edit : though , to be honest , i do n't think * culture * is something that should be discussed by politicians at all . 
  best ways for integrating citizens and other people living in the country , yes , but culture should be left to sociologists to discuss . 
  the conservatives are trying to interpret and impose their views on what the german culture is on the rest of the german society . 
   while satellite television is popular in iran , owning a satellite dish is illegal . 
  police and security forces occasionally smash dishes and seize receivers as authorities routinely denounce the western pop culture shown on satellite channels as decadent and un-islamic . 
   gem tv is known for entertainment satellite channels that dub foreign films and western programmes into farsi for iranians . 
  it also produces movies and tv series . 
  seems like someone has given up and gone after the source ? 
  i do agree , though , that considering `` they are fighting to bring vision in his eye back , '' * may * would probably be more appropriate due to the severity of the situation . 
  nope . 
  past would be `` might have lost '' . 
  there 's negligible difference between `` may '' and `` might '' ( the latter communicating it 's less likely than `` may '' , i believe ) . 
  obviously you 're not praying enough . 
  get thee to a nunnery !, 
  for the good of the economy !, 
  * give a man weapons and he will build a repressive regime . 
  teach a man how to make weapons and he will ... ? 
  * i ca n't possibly see why one would n't export arms industry know-how to saudi arabia . 
  it 's a great idea !, 
  do excuse me if i somewhat deviate from this description with my immodest and blasphemous ways . 
  at least in the case of nuclear power plants , the radioactive material is generally well contained , [ unlike in the case of coal power plants ] ( https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/ ) . 
  i 'd sooner say it 's an example of nationalism rearing it 's ugly head during economic downturn . 
  but what do i know . 
  \u0160alt ... ? 
  it 's borscht . 
  i hope this wo n't negatively affect the two nation 's freight sheep . 
  counter-proposal : let the greeks rename their region to the axios [ vardar ] river region . 
  sounds about as reasonable as your proposal . 
  and it 's not the real name and never was -- back then ( between wwi and wwii ) all the yugoslav provinces were named after rivers and this one was named after the river vardar . 
  why are you pretending to be ( north ) macedonian/from fyrom ? 
  [ edited to provide both names for the river ], 
  [ the association i get every time i read mr king george 's comments ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjdxmv8hurw ) ( nsfw ), 
  gets a special closeup bracket just to say : you ai n't gettin any data . 
  yessss , the glorious slavic macedonian empire . 
  where do i sign up ?
