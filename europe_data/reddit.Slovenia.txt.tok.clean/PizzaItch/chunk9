  that wretched hive of intrigue and backstabbing ? 
  good luck , not gon na help . 
  restoring the hittite empire on the other hand ... 
  i see where you 're coming from and i generally agree , it 's schizophrenic and hypocritical . 
  and seeing the negative effects of anti-drug laws is exactly why i 'm not ardently for banning circumcision . 
  do n't mistake it for condoning the practice , though !, 
  i 'm just unsure what 's right approach to eradicate it . 
  you may not be able to buy cocaine or heroin , but ( i guess depending where you live ) you can get methadone at a clinic . 
  why ? 
  see , that 's politics , the weighting of pros and cons not blind idealism . 
  well , * someone * needs some external enemies . 
  restoration of the sultanate proceeding as planned . 
  except , as far as i see it , casting an empty vote or spoiling it is usually done in protest , not to signify one is fine with either candidate . 
  i would sooner say that 's what those not voting are trying to communicate ( though many abstainers often say they do n't vote because they do n't like any of the candidates ) . 
  so i do n't think it 's so clear cut . 
  or are these actions so clearly understood in france ? 
  i 'm somewhat sceptical , considering it cites the source . 
  i 'm sure there 's some causation here . 
  hmm , yes , i see it now !, 
  since their neighbour might have been irradiated , people in other countries tended to keep as far away from their fellow countrymen as possible , whereas due to not being irradiated ( and not respecting other people 's personal space ) , nothing stopped 99 % of french people from basically piling on top of each other in paris and lyon . 
  in this article , i do n't see any reasonable argument put forward against the proportional-representation system . 
  i do n't think it should n't be the voting system , which should keep unsavoury political parties outside the parliament . 
  yes , i prefer the bickering inherent to proportional-representation system * to the left-right lurches typical of the majoritarian system , thank you very much . 
  \\* a patch in the form of ranked voting would be nice , though . 
  well , thanks for forgetting about us and therefore not labelling us kosovo , i guess . 
  interesting ; after having read the article , i 'd sooner sooner think that of 71 % of austrians . 
   the leading party in germany is named `` christlich demokratische union '' . 
  yet the leader of said party is an atheist wait , what ? 
  merkel is an atheist ? 
  did she bamboozle her own party ? 
  i 'm starting to like her . 
   i like taxes and regulations . 
  flair checks out . 
  seriously , though , i agree . 
  for about half of indicators i do n't think a very high score is positive . 
  `` labor freedom '' -- really ? 
  sounds like an euphemism for `` freedom to exploit workers '' . 
  well , i guess my political colours are showing ( hint : it 's not neoliberalism ) . 
  unlike press freedom index , i 'm much less concerned about how the country i live in ranks here . 
  heh , reading this i 'm having flashbacks of comments in * a certain popular submission * . 
  * `` nothing to see here , move along . 
  so ... am i right to assume every british pm is required to have had an intimate relationship with the porcine kind ? 
  wow , what a terribly narrow view of a country !, 
  at the very least you should have included kangaroos . 
  i for one thank the russians for entertaining the internets since ... probably since the first russian got internet access . 
  in principle i agree , however parties that have in the past been described as far left , such as die linke and syriza have turned out to be rather tame when elected into government , so when it comes to gradual dissolution of the democratic system from within , i 'm more worried about extreme right parties . 
  i think the tendency to shout smash capitalism !, 
  at every opportunity exhibited by the far left is n't conductive to subtle scheming . 
  nobody doubts that fascists were hostile to and fucked over many people , including many italians and i am glad to hear nobody is proud of them ( though , really , this is sadly a bit too optimistic , as in every society there are a few nutjobs who are incapable of any criticism of their forebears ; in slovenia we sadly still have too many uncritical partisan , as well as fascist apologists ) . 
  i , myself , certainly bear no ill will towards italians , and i doubt many others in this discussion do . 
  what most do seem to get jumpy about , however , is how the state of italy has dealt with its fascist past , which in my opinion is quite well illustrated by the case of the gonars concentration camp , where it basically said : `` nothing to see here '' , razed it and built a road over it . 
  this is why i have great respect for germany , where such buildings are preserved and pretty much every post-wwi statue accompanied with a plaque warning about the dangers of militarism and nazism . 
  i think this kind of reflection is somewhat missing in italy ( it 's also sorely missing in slovenia , especially in relation to the communist past , but that 's a whole other story ... ) , which is why this post has garnered such reactions , since calling it liberation is perceived as shifting the blame to german nazis . 
  [ arson and destruction of cultural institutions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trieste_national_hall ) , [ banning the use of one 's mother tongue in public ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italianization ) , [ deportations to concentration camps and executions ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gonars_concentration_camp ) , [ especially of intelligentsia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lojze_bratu%c5%be ) ... these * surely * are n't ethnic cleansing , eh ? 
  marco polo was italian . 
  nice deflection / s [ edited to provide sources ], 
  wow , again this whataboutism . 
  you are aware the foibe massacres happened * after * 25 years of ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the italians ? 
  where the hell do you get your information from ? 
  excellent historical revisionism right there . 
  ( for the record : i find any killing , especially extrajudicial killing , regrettable and nothing in any way justifies such reprisals , but damn do i find the mental gymnastics and whitewashing going on here despicable ) . 
   i wonder if he 's not also paid by russians , but far from as much as le pen is . 
  i doubt it ; commies tend to be pro-russia pro bono . 
  this is why far-right should never be allowed even close to power . 
  it 's important that the power-grab , manipulations and the results are challenged , but i fear the fate of a democratic turkey has been sealed long ago . 
  hopefully i 'm wrong . 
  nordics -- the reverse balkans . 
  could n't , conversely , jlm be blamed just as much for hamon not reaching the second round , though ? 
  i , too , really hope hamon wo n't be made a scapegoat for socialists ' defeat . 
  hon hon hon, 
  while it 's true the polish-lithuanian presented only [ about 1/3 ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/schlacht_am_kahlenberg ) of the relief force , the way you 're trying to present them -- as some kind of separate mop-up operation or what ? -- also reeks of historical revisionism . 
  well , `` pretty inoffensive and not the best craic 2.0 '' sounds about right ( obviously does not apply to \u017di\u017eek ), 
  i do n't know how people can possibly condone this . 
  if we banned every person holding an irrational belief we could just ... ... wait a minute : is the earth a solitary confinement for species considered too dumb to be part of the inter-galactic society ? 
  me too !, 
  he 's really the only result left of centre , so not surprised . 
  well , if you consider spd to be left ... 
  i simply took the [ map with referendum results ] ( https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/dosya:hay%c4%b1r2017referandum.png ) and the map showing books read ( `` bir y\u0131l \u0130\u00e7inde ortalama okunan kitap adedi '' ) from [ here ] ( http://www.kygm.gov.tr/eklenti/55,yonetici-ozetipdf.pdf?0 ) . 
  i adjusted the colours of the latter map to match the former using gimp . 
  oh , and i used chrome to access both maps and upload the finished product :p, 
  i tried to find the numbers in the [ document that is supposed to contain the source data ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/66h0oa/there_seems_like_to_be_a_pattern/dgihdvg/ ) but sadly my rudimentary knowledge of turkish and google translate have not been enough . 
  maybe some turk can help here ? 
  however , i * have * thrown together a rudimentary [ comparison of % of ` no ' votes and number of books read per person in region in turkey ] ( http://imgur.com/a/fobwt ) and i see no significant correlation to confirm this hurr-durr-stupid-people-are-stupid circlejerk going on is at all justified . 
  again though , i might have misread the data ... but see for yourself . 
  sorry , i do n't think op 's map has much to do with anything . 
  thanks !, 
  time to brush up my t\u00fcrk\u00e7e :d edit : sorry , but , i do n't see any data on book sales or anything like that , just reading habits and library membership . 
  and this data does n't seem to corroborate the posted map ( [ see my other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/66h0oa/there_seems_like_to_be_a_pattern/dginakt/ ) ) . 
  i think i 'll take the map with a metric ton of salt . 
  fascinating . 
  u/a-soul-in - tension can you please the provide the source for book sales though ? 
  i 'm not saying the connection is n't likely , but it should be compared with book sales per capita per region . 
  edit : and obviously not treated as some kind of first-past-the-post system . 
  * i see a red-blue map and i want it painted purple * edit 2 : and the percentage of books sold , while at first it appears to indicate education levels , probably has more to do with wealth . 
  of books read per year per person would be a much better indicator , imo . 
  yeah , because the state can police everything , right ? 
  especially parents hell-bent on having their kid 's penis mutilated . 
  wow , how did such sharp decline from 80 % to virtually 0 happen just within 15 years ? 
  action should be taken immediately !, 
  i 'd say `` ban it '' , but if it were banned , then it would probably be just performed by a local butcher .
