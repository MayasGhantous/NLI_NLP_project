haha :(, 
  i remember going but not signing . 
  i did n't care about the purpose of that . 
  i was skipping school , eating for free , sitting in a humvee and carrying a machine gun that day . 
  maybe the military is n't that bad !, 
  so you 're about the same age as i am . 
  i do n't remember signing something like that . 
  not that i have anything against that , but still ... interesting . 
  we signed that ? 
  how old are you ? 
  that is true unfortunately . 
  it does n't mean that something is crap or cheap like it would be if we would say it is chinese . 
  it is more like pat a mat would have created it . 
  i have no idea why do people say that something is * \u010de\u0161ko * . 
  the term is probably dying thou . 
  i usually check the numbers of the czech republic and then compare them to the ones of slovenia . 
  i 'm guessing you 're doing the same  . 
  why not ? 
  slovenes do n't say bruxells . 
  we say bruselj . 
  and the subs were in german , why not use laibach ? 
  i think that it is a good question . 
  you 're going to ljubljana tomorrow ? 
  great !, 
  the weather is n't great in april thou . 
  you should check out [ odprta kuhna ] ( http://odprtakuhna.si/lokacija/ ) it 's a nice little food market where interesting restaurants serve small portions of their food in the center of ljubljana . 
  i would add [ `` the sower '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_sower ) by ivan grohar from 1907 and [ `` coffeemadam '' ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/ivana_kobilca_-_kofetarica.jpg ) by [ ivana kobilica ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivana_kobilca ) . 
  it has to be a national sport . 
  they are so good but so small . 
  my grandfather sometimes goes from euroes to tolars ( old slovene currency ) to marks and talks about how expensive somehing is . 
  the deutsche marks were the currency for any larger purchases back in the days . 
  hey we make those too in slovenia . 
  time to declare it as our own and protect it so you and the austrians ca n't make money from making those . 
  \\ s they are called `` mi\u0161ke '' here . 
  it means small mice . 
  we separated from yugoslavia because we wanted to be independent and the language spoken here is slovenian . 
  some people have lived here for more than 20 years and they still speak serbo-croatian . 
  i did n't learn the language in schools because i am too young but i hate it when a bus driver or some other public worker does n't speak slovenian with me . 
  is n't that a discrace ? 
  here we mostly get immigrants from the other ex-yugoslavian countries . 
  most immigrans are from bosnia , then come albania , macedonia and serbia which are probably all about the same . 
  not many africans , arabs or asians thou . 
  we are too small to be found on the map when they are looking for a country to move to ( ammongst other reasons ) . 
  the immigrants are not hated and people do n't say `` they terk our jerbs '' very often . 
  but if you act like a `` chav '' or talk in serbo-croatian you will probably get some mean looks . 
  the roma are hated but it never shows violence . 
  many people feel that the roma are first class citizens because they get a lot of money from the state and some famous gypsys got replacement homes . 
  bonus : [ gypsy wedding in ljubljana including helicopter ride , ferraris , a famous rapper , `` making it rain '' ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va5uubomiue ),

  i do n't get it either ... 
  that 's one of the cooler fun facts i 've heard lately . 
  any source on that ? 
  i would like to know more about it . 
  yet another thing in which we are split in half . 
  a couple years ago there was a similar referendum in slovenia . 
  it was about allowing same-sex marriages and not banning . 
  the referendum failed by just a few percent . 
  what 's interesting is that traditionaly croats and serbs always said that slovenes are gay . 
  that was a good one :'(, 
  we have 12 % unemployment and a minimum wage . 
  there have been some talks of removing the minimum wage law . 
  edit : the 12 % were meant as a bad thing of course .

  which column should i be looking at ? 
  i said the first one [ ... ] lives on triglav . 
  which part is a lie ? 
  well in reality almost nobody celebrates grandpa cold nowadays . 
  when i was younger , my dad 's company made a `` grandpa cold party '' and all the kids of the employees got some gifts .
