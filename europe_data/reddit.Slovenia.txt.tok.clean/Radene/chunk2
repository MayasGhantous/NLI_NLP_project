  `` now listen , timmy , * never * put your penis up another man 's back end like i am going to do now ... '', 
  `` kova\u010di\u010d '' more common than `` kova\u010d '' here ? 
  interesting ... 
  i 'm sorry , i 'm not sure what you mean . 
  i 've not been following our politics as well as i 'd want to lately , so i might be a bit out of the loop . 
  edit : wait a second , did you confuse my flair for a russian flag ... ? 
  well , maybe , but if it 's gay it means there are only men involved , which means it 's a lot more * manly * than straight stuff . 
  no non-men to dilute the manliness of the situation you see . 
  a vodka party followed by a bear-wrestling match . 
  no , not really . 
  some people confuse the two , mostly older folks for whom the ussr was around longer than the modern-day russia currently is . 
  not sure how it was back in the day , tho . 
   sweden-finland -  fuck knows whats next . 
  have finland send them to russia !, 
  yeah but those are a different path , the ones currently causing ripples are coming via turkey , not via the med . 
  croatia has elections soon . 
  well ai n't that a surprise ... 
  meh , death is easy , it 's the `` eternal damnation '' thing that 's scary :(, 
  while the croatian president is calling for border control . 
  internal power struggle in croatia i guess , but hey i guess slovenia can worry about the migrants , eh ? 
  not with that attitude . 
  yeah , * i * get lost sometimes when trying to drive places , including places i 've been to before and * i live here * . 
  we resurrect maister and let him take care of it ? 
  yeah , my point is that we already are at or above that level of border control on the slo-cro border , so i 'm not sure why we 'd send extra manpower . 
  then again , anything can happen , situation is ridiculous . 
  austria is only instating the sort of control we have been maintaining on the outer schengen border for a while now , tho . 
  depending on who you ask , it might be an awesome place to live , or literally worse than north korea . 
  unsurprisingly , it 's a political thing . 
  they tend to think a lot , but fall short when it 's time to actually do anything . 
  myeah i can only speak for myself , but i got pretty cynical about it . 
  not only because this migrant thing , mind , it goes years back when i talked with people on forums about anything from abortion to gun control to keynesian economics , but it always went the same way : `` let me get this straight '' means `` i 'm going to strawman you so hard '' `` let 's be honest '' means `` you better agree with me or i 'll call you names '' `` just calling 'em as i see 'em '' means `` i have nothing , so i am just bashing your character '' . 
  and `` we need to talk about this ( pressing issue ) of yours '' means something along the same lines as what it means when your girlfiriend says that . 
  well , they 're fighting against the tyrannical and despotic and * most definitely a bad guy ^ tm * assad , are n't they ? 
  was n't assad the bad guy according to our politicians and media ? 
  and now the other guys are also apparently not good guys ? 
  why does it have to be some complicated ? 
  why ca n't the media and the government and the internet feed me some simple black-and-white story and tell me what to think ? 
  edit : `` fighting against '' , not `` fighting about '' . 
  jeez . 
  i need a nap . 
  you 're an idiot . 
  alright , let 's hold up islam up to scrutiny , rationally and ethically . 
  can we get some people who know what they 're talking about in here , then ? 
  historians , people in religion studies , folks with academic credentials , and the like ? 
  'cause that 's how you hold anything up to scrutiny ; via discussion that involves people who actually know what they 're talking about . 
  garbage collection is actually , at least around here , a pretty well-paying job and not in abundance , at least not as a proper `` job '' . 
  of course there 's those occasions when there 's an event and then they bring in extra people to clean the place up afterwards , but that 's a very short-term thing . 
  as for au-pair , well ... not sure that many people are keen on letting a middle eastern immigrant into their home , even in that context . 
  everyone prefers a white middle class female exchange student for that . 
  construction , however , is seasonal , and hard work , but if you work well , then it 's a pretty lucrative deal . 
  many do not know that , and as you said , often in demand . 
  that 's irrelevant to the point that said `` europeans did n't leave '' . 
  uhm , thing is ... how many engineers can africa educate in the first place ? 
  http://blog.europeana.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/migration-boat.jpg nope , not fleeing to a place with a stronger economy at all . 
  eh , opinions are n't relevant in that case , i 'm talking attitude and posturing . 
  those are usually adorable , regardless of opinion . 
  always love reading what self-important people post on their blogs . 
  it 's adorable . 
  granted , the west would very much like it if someone ... agreeable came to power in russia . 
  as they say , the most convincing lies and propaganda actually have a grain of truth to them . 
  to most russians , that * is n't * an item , it 's just `` that 's how it is , we do n't know anything different , why would we want anything different ? '', 
  active political opponents are the ones who do have that concern tho . 
  but that 's not your average ivan , and when compared to the rest of the population , there are n't that many . 
  what 's with the pot calling the kettle black ? 
  at the risk of making a really horrible joke , but ca n't they just settle them on \u00c5land or something ? 
  when did we invent time travel ? 
  this is from years ago . 
  this , chaining referendums too fast will have a reverse effect . 
  time will tell is all i can say . 
  personally i am against eu countries breaking up . 
  but , from experience ( seeing as i come from what used to be yugoslavia ) , i can tell you that * if * the people want to break off , they * will * . 
  and at that point it 's not about whether or not it 's legal but only about how it should be handled , realpolitik takes over . 
  funny minds think alike , have an upvote , 
  * cough * kosovo * cough * slovenia , too , in fact . 
  ours was unilateral as well . 
  kosovo did as well , and most of the west jumped on it , because fuck you russia and serbia !, 
  crimea did as well , and most of the west was like hell no fuck you russia !, 
  also , slovenia declared it and most of the west was like fuck you slovenia , stay with serbia and the gang !, 
  ... my point is , it 's all about geopolitics , realpolitik and spheres of influence . 
  morality and/or legality of independence do n't even get put on the table in such discussions . 
  out of curiosity ; did you feel the same way about scotland ? 
  not all of us !, 
  just the ones who know when to go out of `` germanic mode '' and relax a bit . 
   good one . 
  oh , another one i heard recently . 
  and englishman , an american , and a serbian guy were the finalists of a cussing competition . 
  the englishman goes on stage , says `` bloody hell !, 
  '' , bows politely and leaves . 
  the american goes on stage , and goes `` fuck you , you motherfucking cocksucker , fuck yeah ! '', 
  and leaves . 
  the serbian guy wants to go on stage , trips , falls , and starts spouting the juicy , plentiful balkan profanity that the author will refrain from transcribing or translating ( mostly because the author is from slovenia - we 're notoriously bad at swearing , having to borrow all our profanity from other languages - and ca n't give a genuine `` oomph '' on this matter ) . 
  after about ten minutes , he takes a deep breath and says `` alright , ready , when do i start ? '', 
  yeah it 's pretty shameful of me , but in the end , i try to see it this way : sure , we 've been austrian for a long time . 
  but i 'll be * damned * if i stay sitting down and being quiet when parni valjak or plavi orkestar start singing . 
  i also like burek after a long work shift , and a quick shot of rakija among friends  we should take the best of both worlds . 
  uk referendum , greek problems , and generally the rise of euroskepticism all over ... 
  what , * again * ? 
  seriously ... that happens every three years !, 
  that was about subtle as rigging a microphone to explode in order to sabotage a stand-up contest . 
  instead of billions in `` humanitarian aid '' we could throw the same billions in actual , physical infrastructure and education .
