  if there 's a demand for it , why not supply it ? 
  `` we are the 65 % ! '', 
  `` concocts '' . 
  now that word gave me a mental image that makes me giggle . 
  it involves putin dancing around a large bubbling cauldron with smoke the color any normal smoke has no right to be , stirring in a pinch of self-aggrandizement , a few drops of glorious patriotism , a healthy dose of misinformation , and an eye of a newt . 
  i wish someone would draw that , because i ca n't draw to save my life . 
  will they get james spader to read it ? 
  pretty much . 
  some people just revel in victimhood . 
  easy way to notice them : they act like victims even when they 're not actually victims of anything . 
  not sure , doubt that belorussian passports are in high demand on the black market as the former yugoslav ones used to be in those times . 
  even if he actually meant that , that 'd be nothing short of delusional . 
  and they 're abbreviated as `` laws '' . 
  mandatory judge dredd reference here , especially if some wiseguy decides to give them voiceboxes . 
  `` proves ? '', 
  more like `` adds to the pile of already pretty much conclusive evidence '' . 
  but hey , that 'd make for a headline without a punch . 
  it 's officer crabtree , you see . 
  `` i was pissing by the door , when i heard two shats . 
  you are holding in your hand a smoking goon ; you are clearly the guilty potty ! '', 
  i gather that for russia , that 's quite a lot . 
  still , 12 hour shifts in what pretty much amounts to `` cubicle farming '' , that sounds horrible . 
  oh hey , an actual written post by a russian person instead of the usual poorly draw meme-type jokes , credit for effort right here . 
  and i 'm not being sarcastic , always a good thing when people actually look up things instead of going `` lol proofs '' . 
  i was mostly making a joke , since it seems all countries have a region that 's `` oh ... * those * guys ... '', 
  i want to read it before deciding ( as in , read the actual treaty text ) . 
  and that means i 'll have to wait a bit . 
  russia at least makes sense for football , whereas qatar ... 
  only swedes would put a hockey venue into the center of a solar system . 
  okay , maybe canadians would , too . 
  but as a hockey fan , i very much like that :d, 
  seriously ? 
  honestly , people have time for the damnest things these days ... 
  ai n't he adorable . 
  still a whole week until the deadline . 
  i 'm only going to start believing any news about greece on 4th june , 23:50 . 
  ... for i could n't , they kept interrupting to correct me . 
  every tourist ever i 've talked to < . <, 
  i thought bayern is n't `` really '' germany . 
  i think that 's the * misconception * , not the clarification . 
  basically , his answer is `` the misconception that romania is actually named for the indigenous romani people . '', 
  we are not `` open , friendly and generous people '' . 
  we 're conniving and cynical , but you have to spend some time around here to notice . 
  / spoken like a true slovenian . 
  i think the idea here is to hide the sometimes embarrassing reasons for why soldiers die in training accidents or while on base . 
  are n't we trying to wreck russia 's economy ? 
  let 'em bankroll it . 
  it 's not like the country hosting the cup makes a profit , fifa does . 
  the country 's just going to be left with expensive stadiums that will never be looked at again after the event . 
  now now , those bribes were given while adhering to the strict terms of paragraph 3 , article 47/4-a of `` how to bribe officials and make sure the color of the envelope is the correct shade of blue '' , there 's nothing illegal about them . 
  the first one was during rehearsal and the second one was n't in moscow , it was in chita , which happens to be closer to mongolia and china than it is to moscow . 
  you mean like the one in some backwater nobody cares about unless it gets hit by a meteorite ? 
  not sure that 's going to hit either of them that hard , but honestly , i 've got my own prejudice against twitter and facebook , so i 'm a biased source here . 
  oh , i see `` affluenza '' is catching on as a defense in russia , too , now is n't it ? 
  exactly !, 
  that 's what i was going for !, 
  the `` where is proofs '' line stopped being funny about three seconds after it was first use to poke fun at the russian `` denying everything '' . 
  it 's really a one-use wonder , was funny that one time , and is just obnoxious now ... or well , maybe not obnoxious , just ... boring . 
  we should come up with something else . 
  like `` but that bribe was given according to rules and regulations , how can it be wrong ? '', 
  ahhh , russia can calm down , blatter himself said that they 'll keep the cup . 
  would he * lie * ? 
  `` do n't you think that the uk might be better off if it does n't consider not being outside the european union ? '', 
  oh wow , that did n't take long . 
  well i 'll be ... who ` da thunk it , huh ? 
   also , danish block politics seem crazy . 
  hardcore classical liberals in the same block as nationalists , social liberals in the same block as democratic socialists ? 
  well , of course you 'd say that , you swedish person . 
  ( am i doing this right ? ), 
   does those people include yourself ? 
  nah , i 've kind of accepted the fact that i 'll never have a shot at `` all the money ''  but i stand by my point - people simply do n't have the capacity for long-term thinking . 
  myself included . 
  mid-term at best . 
  if there 's one thing i learned , living in this world for three decades and a bit more , is that people tend to not really have a capacity for long-term thinking . 
  if i can have `` all the money '' today , even if it 's doomsday tomorrow , hey , i got all the money , suckers !, 
  ( that 's how an average human being seems to be thinking ), 
  well , it 's very hard to believe that he was unaware of this corruption taking place . 
  not that i would have anything against prison labor in * principle * ... but , eh who am i kiddin ' ? 
  there 's no way this is going to happen in a proper , transparent and laborer-friendly manner in this particular case , is there . 
  to me it seems as if the only problem with * that * is `` we did n't think of it first '' . 
  actually it 's become a synonym for `` guys i do n't like '' . 
  speaking of which , `` putinist '' has also become a synonym for `` guys i do n't like '' . 
  problem is that `` not thinking putin is a cartoon villain '' seems to be conflated with `` admiring putin '' around here . 
  and yeah , putin 's russia is quite fascist , and currently engaging in a lot of dickery in eastern europe . 
  but , the reasons for that happening are a wee bit more complex than `` russia is evil and wants to take over the world '' . 
  i mean , it 's not like putin called the un and demanded * one million dollars !, 
  * good luck trying to explain that to the average internet dweller , though , you 're just going to get called a shill . 
  the only thing i could maybe , kind of sort of admire about putin for is how he manages to look at least a decade younger than he is . 
  i mean my father looks older than him , and he 's 10 years younger than him !, 
  * how does he do it ? 
  * ( cue `` doctors hate him '' ad spam ), 
  yes , i 'm going to sign myself under this , too . 
  also , i do prefer their more technical style of the hokey game over the north american , more physical contact style . 
  thing is , that `` without treaty change '' is going to keep it precisely as unfinished as it currently is . 
  does n't that sound a bit like `` valve replacement without open heart surgery '' ? 
  it 's missing croatia . 
  tho not sure just that would put eu ahead of australia by territory . 
  all those resource spent on these `` tests '' when all they needed to do was simply send an e-mail and ask . 
  does n't change much , seeing as the sovereign debt of most countries is increasing . 
  spoken like an average counterstrike player ( only with less unadulterated rage ) .
