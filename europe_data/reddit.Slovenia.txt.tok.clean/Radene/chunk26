   she suggested that people who are suspected of soliciting prostitutes for sex should be sent a violet envelope from the police with the accusations so that they could be `` outed '' as sex buyers to their neighbours , relatives and postal workers ... cause surely that is how the justice system works !, 
  no court like the court of public opinion , is there ? 
  poor ol' ben , he had * no idea * how easily people would give up essential liberty for some * lazy-ass convenience . 
  or maybe people just , i do n't know , liked the song for what it was . 
  i mean , as i said some times before , downvote me if you want , but no matter what kind of a political dickery russia is engaging in right now , they have some real beautiful and catchy tunes . 
  if you 're importing bananas from ecuador to keep the public at home from descending into riots over lack of bananas , then that country is very much * helping * you . 
  i mean , sure , you 're compensating for that help , but you 're still * receiving * it . 
  you 're not self-sufficient , the fact that you 're paying does n't mean you 're not relying on someone else . 
  in fact , the fact that you 're paying very much means you 're relying on someone else , because you are paying someone else to do for you what you ca n't do . 
  so , again . 
  being able to do it without anyone 's help means being able to do it even if everyone else suddenly ceases to exist . 
  if you ca n't do it on your own , then you 're not self-sufficient . 
  to scale it down , if you need a plumber to fix your pipes when they back up , you 're not a self-sufficient homeowner . 
  being able to afford to pay does n't make you self-sufficient . 
  being able to do it yourself does . 
  `` being able to run a country without any others existing '' is what `` self-sufficient '' * means * . 
  if we closed all borders and international trade today , how many countries would n't collapse ? 
  oh , do n't worry , only the ones that are n't self-sufficient would collapse , we 'll be fiiiiiiiiine . 
  self-sustaining would only mean that we make enough kids to keep our society going which ... technically , most western countries * do n't * , so i would n't climb on any high horses using * that * expression . 
  but hey , you said `` welcome to the real world '' , which i believe is internet slang for `` hey everybody , check the size of my dick '' . 
  i 'm not even getting into the entire `` confidently asserting what future events will take place '' bit , i ca n't seriously do that without involving lottery numbers . 
  has nothing on the ranting swede . 
  oh i agree . 
  a currency union without unified tax and fiscal policies seems to be just asking for trouble and i do hope the eu manages to move into that direction soon enough , to get out of this unstable limbo it 's been stuck in for a while . 
  people who thrive on doomsaying , mostly , i think . 
  as payback for them giving no points to uk ? 
   now , let 's not dwindle ourselves towards the interminable blame game , but find a proper ( financial ) strategy out of this mess . 
  are you seriously proposing that we find solutions instead of talking tough about how `` those other guys '' * deserve * to get ground into dust because reasons ? 
  what are you , * crazy * ? 
  `` why does anyone like anything in particular that i do n't like ? '', 
  by `` going on too long '' i meant basically `` had too many repetitions '' . 
  the longer this goes on , the more likely both sides will hit an absolute no-compromise position , and we 'll have a nice trainwreck to be horrified by yet be unable to look away from it . 
  it 's been going on way too long tho . 
  sooner or later , one side will say `` fuck it '' . 
  go away , you 're not funny or smart . 
  me neither , i was mostly saying since i work in a similar field , those three drops kind of hit a chord with me and made me go `` alright , someone , somewhere , is getting yelled at right now '' . 
  i 've been learning from the best . 
  i never could decide if i prefer this or takeshi 's castle . 
  the latter was real funky at times , gwf had a much more pronounced spirit of friendly competition . 
  we used to be dark green before we got turned into pink . 
  i think we actually managed to win one back in those days ... 
  it was fun , but as years passed by , became less slapstick i suppose . 
  back in the days , there was always some sort of a slippery place they had to get through and spent so much time on their butts . 
  the net sum of all sovereign debts and credits in the world is * negative * . 
  add up all the sovereigns , and the planet owes a shitload of money even after all the credits are settled and balanced ... to whom ? 
  i see that as a problem . 
  could have been worse . 
  could have been better , too . 
  i did n't call you a bitch , buddy . 
  also , that 's not my opinion , but i do n't think you have any interest in actually clearing up what it is ... so well , i wo n't say unless you ask . 
  preferably , without using derogatory terms . 
  also also , that `` etc. '', 
  thing ... 
  `` bitching '' , you say ? 
  i see , you seem to believe your opinion to be superior to mine simply because it 's * your * opinion , and any challenge to it is n't worth being referred to seriously , oh no , it 's only worthy of being referred to with a smug , derogatory expression . 
  but i 'll let it slide this once if you can list at least two more subject in place of that `` etc. '', 
  i hate it when people use `` etc. '', 
  to mean `` i do n't know what else , but ... something i 'm sure , so i 'll pretend '' . 
  you sound like an abusive parent beating his kid , for the kid 's own good , of course . 
  also , the kid did n't even do anything wrong , it 's your wife who pissed you off . 
  well , then let 's abolish the current system that pretty much needs debt to function . 
  for conceit and lack of empathy , maybe ? 
  see , i get it , people have different opinions , and you seem to be of an opinion that if you can ignore the hardships of other people as long as you 're not personally responsible for them , and you also seem to subscribe to the `` sins of the father '' line of thought ... as if the fucked-over generation of greeks is still somehow `` responsible '' for their own problems , and just `` needs to suck it up because that 's life '' . 
  but the moment i turned this around and suggested that * you yourself * might not respond positively to such logic in the event , as likely or unlikely as it may be , that you 're left in the gutter by circumstance ( or through something your superiors and/or predecessors did ) , what do you do ? 
  you pretty much say `` well it 's not * my * logic '' . 
  either you stand by your principles , even when you yourself would be negatively affected , or you do n't . 
  quit making excuses . 
  hey i 'm not judging either , i 'm just saying that people need a taste of their own medicine sometimes , see how tough they are when their own tough talk is served back to them . 
  if you ever end up down on your luck ( no job , no perspective in life , no reasonable prospect of finding a job anytime soon ) , i 'm going to make sure to repeat those words to you three times every day , and take bets on how long you last . 
  if taking debt is `` a problem '' in and of itself , we * really * should abolish the monetary economy altogether , because that one kind of runs on debt , i.e. , it runs on `` a problem '' . 
  oh , that 's okay then . 
  i 'm sure the fucked-over people will understand and be reasonable about it instead of expecting someone who had nothing to do with it to help them out . 
  not really a choice of countries different from when the series was running . 
   like with everything in life , the first path will bring pain in the short term and results in the long run . 
  and all it takes is fucking over a whole generation of people !, 
  sucks to be them , huh . 
  that 's true , he did stand out in that regard . 
  but when all was said and done , the only `` memorable '' ones were estonia , portugal and georgia , since they dropped and had to be called later . 
  tho i * am * speaking with the kind of bias a person working in tv media would have ( such a thing is considered a `` major fuckup '' , even if the hosts make it seem like a no biggie ) . 
  actually , it 's just that the joke was n't funny . 
  i do n't like it when people make such jokes . 
  `` oh look at me , i 'm such a kidder '' just does n't make me laugh , it makes me cringe . 
  jeez , that was a bad joke . 
  see , if people want to boo something russian , boo that guy !, 
  it was cringeworthy . 
  estonia , portugal and georgia being the most memorable ones !, 
  but i say that with the bias of someone working in media , so `` dropped live picture '' is something that indeed is very memorable , and your bosses will make sure you know it if you happened to be responsible for the feed when it happened ... 
  just lefty ngos ? 
  no righty ngos ? 
  so who has that singer invaded ? 
  jeez , i love people trying to use `` guilt by association '' . 
  well that 's not going to help ukraine get closer to eu values . 
  til that `` supergrass '' actually means something other than `` grass that has been bitten by a radioactive spider and is now saving the world all the time '' . 
  well `` russia '' does n't even have ears . 
  it 's just a thing you see on a map . 
  there * was * one russian thing boo-worthy at the event , however !, 
  it was that outrageously horrible joke by the russian announcer going `` and twelve points , for russia ahahahahaanojustkidding . '', 
  that was * horrible * . 
  okay , so just let me ask one simple question . 
  who was it that the booing was directed at , and why was that person not the person actually taking it ?
