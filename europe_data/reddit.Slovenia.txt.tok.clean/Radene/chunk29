  hockey fan here !, 
  russians have always been sore losers , especially against canada . 
  which is a shame , since i actually like their less physical , more technical style of the game . 
  me , i 'm personally just upset finland did n't make it further than it did :( but one thing i do n't get ... why is the anthem/flag * after * cup/confetti ? 
  it 's backwards . 
  raising the cup should be the penultimate moment to close a tv broadcast with , at least . 
  plus it looks like `` hey guys , here 's your cup , and confetti , knock yourselves out will ya oh no wait get serious again '' . 
  oh hello , andorra , how ya doin ' ? 
  not in the sense of usa , no . 
  but i would like a unified foreign policy and eurobonds to happen . 
  `` guys , we have a story on a dead russian guy , and a story on a poisoned house in surrey ... but only room for one headline ! '', 
  ehhhh , is n't it usually dones as `` surrey , uk '' ? 
  also , `` russian tax officials '' ? 
  and americans think the irs is bad . 
  yeah , those dwarves always have a shiv hidden up their sleeves and all ... 
  nothing like a good ol' arms race to break the tedium . 
  the `` war on terror '' has been getting old , after all ... 
  shoulda annexed the rest of slovenia to austria . 
  if we 're getting partitioned , might as well say hi to vienna again :d, 
  i find it slightly ironic that the author talks about `` european exceptionalism '' there at the end , in an article with such a glaring american-centric bias . 
  i was mostly trying to make a joke on the double meaning of the word `` crash '' , to be honest . 
  is this some sort of a smart iwall that will recognize who to let pass and who not to let pass ? 
  technically only a few people `` know '' what happened ; the rest of us are just pretty damn sure - and do n't get me wrong , i 'm pretty damn sure myself ; but , in a court of law , that is n't enough to convict , and i suspect that 's exactly the card they 're playing . 
  were i to joke a little , i 'd say they 're going for `` the scottish verdict '' ^ [ 1 ] . 
  but i must say , i am a little surprised that russia is n't trying to inject more ambiguity into this . 
  [ 1 ] `` not proven '' aka `` not guilty and do n't do it again '', 
  nope , it 's quite real . 
  the eu does not have a unified foreign policy ( yet ) . 
  and there are member states already opposed to russian sanctions , and they 're not the ones you 'd expect , and then there 's greece , currently shafted by pretty much everyone , and looking for economic ties with russia out of sheer desperation to survive as a sovereign country - greece ca n't `` take one for the team '' as it is right now . 
  unless it wants to have a role of `` sacrifice '' , but i doubt that . 
  unless we unify our foreign policies , * and * take care of the member states better ( fiscal union would help ) , we 'll have to keep passing these things through full consensus . 
  all the boring and unfunny joking about `` vacations '' aside , i just wonder what this will mean for the entire conflict . 
  will it help to bring it to an end ? 
  in that case , why waste time on an investigation at all ? 
  there 's still that problem that fracking could crash the market . 
  both by driving the prices down , and by literally destroying the bedrock on top of which the market is located . 
  a political body should n't be investigating , anyway . 
  separation of powers and all . 
  on a more facetious note , not like an investigation by * anyone * is needed anyway , since everybody 's already made up their mind and is n't going to change it , no matter what happens . 
  you know what , you should have won against the czechs and then beaten russians in the final , canada would have nothing on rinne in the semis :( i am said that finland got knocked out . 
  that said , i never understood why the anthem is played after the cup and confetti . 
  it 's like ... `` here 's your cup and cheer and knock yourselves out ... oh wait no get serious again '' . 
  still , the russians should have stayed on the ice , and props to tikhonov for actually trying to get the others to stay . 
  psssssst . 
  we do n't want critical thinking here , we just want to point fingers at russia and either go `` j'accuse ! '', 
  or `` oh russia , you so silly . '', 
  or both . 
  in other hockey news , canada trashed russia 6-1 tonight in the world championship finals . 
  well , there might be a couple of armament factories , and not quite as many elephants . 
  can eesti into nordic ? 
  out of curiousity , it this the result of the catholic/orthodox schism ? 
  that 's one thing i 've not yet thought about much . 
  no no , talking about hockey . 
  the weird rugby with helmets is already over for the season . 
  indeed , the wiretapping is n't the de facto `` cause '' of these protests , it 's the straw that broke the camel 's back . 
  now the rage about everything else is spilling out , too . 
  call me crazy , but that bust looks almost like scipio africanus . 
  finnish slution : `` point simo at 'em and wait '' . 
  that you need to root for rangers in the eastern finals , cause no way do you want those damn bolts that knocked you out of the playoffs to win the cup , 
  i see , `` religion '' and `` faith '' being conflated . 
  would not be more accurate to say `` losing faith in their religion '' ? 
  and yes , that 's quite a crisis . 
  imagine it like this : something you stood for and believed in - does n't have to be a deity , it can be something as simple as `` rush limbaugh is actually a decent chap '' - is suddenly shown to you in a light that you realize how wrong you were . 
  now imagine this happened with something central to your identiy , community , and how you 've lived your life so far . 
  ( assuming you did n't worshp rush limbaugh , of course ), 
  reminds me of that joke ... `` you can build a thousand homes , and nobody will know you as ` the homebuilder ' . 
  but get drunk and fuck one sheep , one time , and you 're forever branded ` the sheepfucker ' '', 
  has to be 1990 , the independence referendum . 
  slovenia is younger than i am . 
  did he say `` go forth , my cossacks , bring glory to mother russia !, 
  i 'd replace janez jan\u0161a cause we sure do n't need a cult of personality in this country . 
  as many times as i feel like annoying revisionists with their own tactics . 
  was n't the treaty about `` defending poland 's borders '' ? 
  `` when nazi germany and poland partitioned czechoslovakia together '' as well . 
  obviously , they were not canadians . 
  well , canada-russia tonight on the world championship . 
  so , greece is , by default , just about to default these days ? 
  my word !, 
  have you no decency ? 
  we keep sending strongly-worded letters , do n't we ? 
  more seriously though , i 'm not an expert on this , but i would love it if some expert came out and laid it out in clean terms , just how much the eu can feasibly afford to do here . 
  the development of this should be interesting in the coming years . 
  `` interesting '' does n't necessarily mean `` good for not-china '' , though . 
  but information wants to be free , anyway . 
  maybe . 
  but i thought the point of fighting back was to end such oppression , not to continue it . 
  my point is , `` humane '' in this case means `` not uncomfortable for whoever is watching '' . 
  or ukrainian . 
  you 're so selfish . 
  why do n't you think of those poor onlookers who might be traumatized by seeing blood ? 
  :( despite the fact that they attended specifically to watch you die , they 're poor , sensitive and fragile souls on the inside :(, 
  no , it is n't . 
  we do n't care about andriy mishchenko that happens to live in a backwater called zorya . 
  it 's about our interests in the region , and most of those are currently conflicting with russian interests in the region . 
  getting our way is by definition `` making sure the russians do n't get their way '' . 
  we have already established that i have no clue what i 'm saying , so the exact opposite of what i said must be true . 
  go find someone else to assert dominance over . 
  death penalty is just a power trip . 
  `` humane '' executions are only `` humane '' because the potential gloaters do n't risk feeling queasy by seeing blood . 
  clean executions exist for the benefit of the onlooker , not the benefit of the one getting executed .
