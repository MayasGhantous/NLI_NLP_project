  sorry , for divorcing you ( except those k\u00e4rtnen folks ) . 
  not even nixon ? 
  i 'm saying that had putin had a hand in it personally , it would n't have been as easy for him to say it . 
  but he did n't since in those times he was still a kid . 
  and the timing was quite convenient , since turkey just lost it about the armenian genocide , so this was an opportunity for russia to spin this in a `` we 're not as bad as some others we could name cause we at least admit it '' way . 
  yeah , that 's slavic languages for you ... got ta negate every word . 
  `` i never did anything to anybody '' would directly translate as `` i never did n't do nothing to nobody '', 
  but what is kim thinking , leaving the best country in the world for such a petty occasion !, 
  now that i think of it , i ca n't be sure ... 
  it 's not just a muslim thing , i mean , we have people here who would * love * to imprison or otherwise silence those who call their favorite politician anything other than `` a saint '' . 
  they would justify that with `` well we ca n't have communists ruining our country '' . 
  because , of course , `` not liking janez jan\u0161a '' makes you the hardcorest of commies , even more hardcore than brezhnev or lenin . 
  luckily their prospect for the future is that they 'll continue to use influence and clout ... 
  mmm , i 'd personally argue that a `` nation state '' ca n't exist without a permanent population either , but i 'm not sure about the technicalities . 
  the timing is kind of interesting , is n't it ? 
  well , you can at least go to the dentist , you can open your mouth freely there . 
  well . 
  i 'd say they knew enough to cause a mess , but not enough to achieve the marxist view of society in practice . 
  sounds a bit like `` oooops , we dun goofed back then '' , does n't it ... 
  i suppose it is better than nothing , though , at least some acknowledgement that what they did was n't right . 
  might be a bit of a timing spin tho , since turkey 's been getting its knickers in a twist over the armenian genocide , and putin might have decided to show the world that `` russia is better than turkey , at least we admit our mistakes . '', 
  a pr spin on russia 's side , basically . 
  yeah , that is true ... 
  true , but on the other hand ... it 's easy to admit stuff you did n't commit yourself . 
  and say what you want about putin , he 's no time lord , so he was n't involved in that ... had he been , it would likely be a bit more difficult for him to say it . 
  where do you live and how can i move there ? 
  i know what you mean : / it sucks when an election rolls around and there 's nobody you really see yourself voting for , so you either `` vote against '' , stay home , or throw in an invalid vote . 
  this is true . 
  that 's why i 'm not actually going to pass my final judgement until it goes public . 
  it would still help to know the general direction and aspects of it , and `` free trade '' is just too vauge . 
  `` markets would be volatile '' , that 's something i consider a trade-off for them being truly `` free '' , for example . 
  truth is , nobody wants a completely free market with zero regulations . 
  the point of contention is n't `` regulations yes or no '' it 's `` what kind of regulations '' . 
  it 's not that i do n't know `` the exact contents '' , it 's that i literally know nothing . 
  i 'm booked until late in the evening , so that will have to wait . 
  if we use `` country '' as shorthand for `` sovereign state '' , it ca n't exist without its people , since having a permanent population is one of the requirements for sovereignty . 
  oh , you know concrete aspects of the ttip , despite the secret negotiations and exceedingly stringent security measures ( `` the room '' and all ) to make sure the general public does n't learn anything , and whatnot ? 
  how do you know ttip will in fact increase trade ? 
  please , tell us more . 
  i am sure people , myself included will be inclined to being more supportive of it when we know what 's actually being written into the damn thing . 
  oh and maybe `` omg , this aspect would be terrible '' can happen then , too . 
  but right now , for what we know , the treaty might say that everyone gets a free xbox one , or that everyone must sacrifice their firstborn to the goddess of fertility . 
  and i do n't want an xbox one in * my * house . 
  the firstborn thing does n't apply to me , so i do n't care if they actually put it in . 
  ( see , this was `` hyperbole '' ), 
  yeah , if only everyone was as smart and awesome as you are , the world would be such a better place ... 
  ah , sins of the father , hmm ? 
  stalin was a psychopathic nutcase , yes , but i do n't think we have to go that far back in history if we want to point out that russia is a bit of a dump thanks to the way it 's governed . 
  oh please . 
  * everybody * knows world wars * always * start because of `` some silly thing in the balkans '' . 
  i honestly thought `` tax '' would be more common . 
  reuters is tabloid media now ? 
  okay , this is new to me . 
  i wonder if he 's trolling . 
  nothing like a good ol' extremist breeding ground next door to have a proper `` european '' feel , is there ... 
  well , would n't put * anything * past those dangnab commies , i would n't . 
  indeed . 
  so i do n't see how strengthening the already powerful position of multinational corporations would result in `` less barriers to commerce '' . 
  `` yes to free trade '' is * precisely * why `` against ttip '' at least as far as i 'm concerned at the moment . 
  speculation tho , i would very much like to see the contents of the agreement before passing final judgement . 
  oh , it would be such a * shame * if some totally-not-russian soldier tripped while carrying all that stuff and it landed on the other side of the border ... 
  as long as neither of you get caught with it in your possession i suppose . 
  oh please . 
  that 's nothing . 
  in slovenia , we have guys who blame some shadowy internal communist conspiracy instead . 
  a communist conspiracy so powerful it can influence foreign law enforcement to persecute and discredit the true patriots !, 
  and it 's all headed by a retired politician . 
  oh , and the guys who spin that theory are not your random nutcases , they 're the second largest party in the country  . <, 
  oh , do n't worry . 
  we have people who try to do their damnest to downplay that and spin the narrative that `` actually , the government sucks , and we just got lucky '' . 
  smc is in a rather unique position where part of the opposition consistently aligns with their proposals , tho , it 's been a while since that happened in slovenia . 
  yes , the situation has improved . 
  i just hope we can keep the trend . 
  so , you 're saying this is a good time to invest into tin foil industry ? 
  `` at this point '' implies they actually had some to begin with . 
  at least as far as i remember , russia has always put pragmatism before honor . 
  that is true !, 
  i 'm not too fond of `` at any cost '' . 
  just rhetoric . 
  `` tough decisions '' , `` necessary reforms '' , those phrases are just pr spin . 
  everyone can say that . 
  i can say it . 
  and the more distant i am from someone who needs to make `` tough decisions '' , the easier it is for me to say it . 
  it 's one of the stupidest disputes in europe in history . 
  it 's been stagnating for a while , we had too many snap elections thanks to sds and their cronies , and the opposition is too busy trying to discredit the government and seize power again to be constructive . 
  and the people seem to have thought that once we managed to get into eu and nato , the job is done and now we do n't have to do anything anymore , it 's all easy coasting . 
  that 's why we 're still struggling with the economy . 
  well , i 'm being sarcastic , yes , but i 'm just saying , if people do n't want to pay taxes , they should n't take state services for granted , no matter how basic they are . 
  i think everyone should have the option to not pay taxes . 
  the trade-off would be not having access to tax-funded services ... since , well , why should you have access to services you 're not paying for ? 
  one little problem with that ... the names on that list are allies of the ousted pro-russian regime . 
  i could even buy one or two getting whacked by fsb in false flag hits to try and discredit the new government , but that many ? 
  hard to believe . 
  i find it slightly disturbing that `` calling it what it was '' somehow requires a top-level-institution vote . 
  whatever you do , lithuania , do n't do what we did here . 
  as in , we kind of seem to have gone `` yay , work done , it 's all easy coasting from now on ! '', 
  hey , as long as he has qualifications to be an envoy , i see no problem with this . 
  i do n't think `` being gay '' disqualifies , since i doubt that vatican actually has an official rule saying so , so they 'll have to just accept it . 
  wait ... i do n't even understand the question . 
  i 'm against * blatantly biased * articles , but that 's it .
