  people get `` disappeared '' in ukraine way too often to even consider it a candidate for european integrations . 
  easy to admit stuff that happened when you were n't personally involved ( unless you were a kgb agent the moment you dropped from your mother 's womb . 
  hmmm , that 's a `` glorious leader '' spin if i ever saw one ) . 
  but it 's still unexpected to hear the man actually say it . 
  i know , right ... but yes , we have such crazies here . 
  well , down here we still have guys who think you 're totally awesome and we 're shit in comparison . 
  then again , those are the same guys who think haider was a decent chap ... 
  `` in a couple decades , every citizen of the balkans will live in the sovereign country of himself . '', 
  myeah , you know . 
  politicians . 
  they 'd be doing something else if they were good at anything other than politics . 
  i think i 'd feel right at home if i moved up there . 
  `` in a couple of decades , every citizen of the balkans will live in the sovereign country of himself . '', 
  and at 11 , random guy takes a dump in the same bush an ss officer took a dump in 75 years ago . 
  austria would make most historical sense . 
  b-but muh sovereignty !, 
  indeed . 
  what will they do if/when more countries follow suit , though ? 
  their position is currently strong , even de facto monopolistic , but a combination of an alternative popping up and some economically strong countries leaving ( or being pulled out of ) can change that . 
  because the $ 2.21 do n't magically appear in your account , but are rather indirect benefits , for example , through lower healthcare costs due to new technologies improving both the overall health and treatments , or lower fuel expenditure for your cars , or the like . 
  so , you do n't `` see '' that money , and your average voter ca n't think of a meaning of `` economic benefit '' that is n't `` more visible money for me '' , and then proceeds to support short-sighted cuts . 
  well obviously he cares about our well-being , duh !, 
  only filthy capitalist pigs would see that as an opportunity to seize !, 
  `` oh i suppose these shares will excel ... '' `` did i hear ` sell ' !, 
  you heard the man , sell ! '', 
  well , at least feigning such a surprise makes good headlines . 
  the more genuine the surprise looks , the better the ratings will be . 
  well , i suppose it 's an attrition thing . 
  for now , google can maybe afford to lose france in addition to spain and go `` bah !, 
  who needs those guys , anyway !, 
  they need us more than we need them ! '', 
  a business ca n't do that forever , though . 
  i get what you 're saying , there is such a thing as accountability . 
  i 'm just a bit surprise that a display of accountability happened in that quagmire . 
  the way i understood it , there was n't an official `` ban '' , more like a tentative silent agreement that nobody would sell to ukraine ... not necessarily because `` scared of russia '' but because `` do n't want to be directly linked to this mess '' . 
  huh . 
  so the ukrainian side stating that it 's them who started this exchange . 
  that 's ... weird . 
  i mean , if i was supposed to respect a ceasefire , and if i broke it , i 'd try to blame the other guy . 
  more vodka !, 
  that 's not a question i can or have any right to answer . 
  gibraltar , i suppose ? 
  i guess the point was `` they can have a referendum to join a country that is a eu member instead '' , or something . 
  iran is currently cooperating with the west too . 
  and i 'm not talking `` nuclear talks '' ; i 'm talking `` we both happen to hate isis guts , so we 're working together against it . '', 
  still does n't make us allies with iran . 
  as far as countries that do n't have immigrant issues are concerned , this is `` somebody else 's problem '' . 
  and the `` somebody else '' will somehow be the scapegoat when it becomes `` everyone 's problem '' . 
  it 's like there 's a fight and you 're hiding behind a guy so you do n't get punched , but when the guy goes down because of having taken too many punches , and now * you * get punched , it 's somehow the fault of the guy you were hiding behind . 
  pretty much what i thought , yes . 
  for once , they 're just passing through and not violating any territorial boundaries . 
  really ? 
  that last one is new to me . 
  hah , i love that . 
  i should ask around , see if i can hear a few in the proper language :d, 
  we do n't feel strongly about him one way or the other , really . 
  we balkan folks crack `` racist '' jokes about ourselves every day . 
  you know , slovenes are stuck-up , bosnians are dumb , montenegrin folks are lazy , serbs and croats are ultra-nationalists , albanians ca n't do anything except make ( some damn tasty ) kebab . 
  now when it comes to actual mistreatment and prejudice , though , yeah . 
  i have walked away from a few conversations and stopped hanging out with some people . 
  and trolled some racists face to face ( you know , the kind where one misstep means you get punched ) . 
  what i do n't do is drag a box of soap and a megaphone around , though , and i get quite irritated by people who do . 
  yes , it is . 
  but what allies * do n't * do , which germany and ussr * did * is keeping in mind how they 're going to shank the other guy the moment he 's distracted . 
  oh no need for more hints , by now i am pretty sure that you * want * me . 
  my place or yours ? 
  well , nato is an alliance . 
  military cooperation on all levels , mutual defensive guarantee , protecting the interests of the members . 
  yes , that 's exactly what i am doing . 
  because if `` fine , i wo n't be at that event of yours , then !, 
  and that will make you look bad ! '', 
  is something that relays `` i 'm taking a stand against you '' , then yes , frankly , i find that * ridiculous * . 
  whoa whoa , take it easy , tiger . 
  if you want to seduce me just bloody tell me you want to sleep with me instead of showing off how `` alpha '' you are . 
  i 'm terrible at reading hints . 
  medically , `` shock '' can also mean `` you 're an inch away from dying '' , be it septic shock , or circulatory shock ... 
  though i think i actually made a mistake in my last post , `` shell shock '' might have been replaced by `` combat stress reaction '' , not `` ptsd '' . 
  yeah i was meaning to say something like that ... this literally looks like teen drama . 
  i mean , i get it , it 's protocol , and it 's diplomacy , and it 's supposed to reflect the relations between the countries , but that only raises the question * why is diplomacy so much like teen drama ? 
  they did some partitioning together since it was convenient for both at the time , but it never struck me as if germany and ussr were ever `` allies '' at that point . 
  they knew they 'd come to blows eventually , it 's just that stalin seemed to think that germany would want to deal with uk first . 
  however , you 're right that all those 27 million were * not * all russian . 
  but seriously , 27 million . 
  it 's hard to even process . 
  oh and many of those ( especially non-russians ) likely died because of ol' josif being such a delusional moron . 
  let 's see you last that long . 
  well that 's why it 's not called `` shell shock '' anymore , but rather `` ptsd '' . 
  it sounds more impersonal and thus less bad . 
  basically , sugar-coat . 
  and no matter what ron perlman says , war * does * change . 
  well , that takes care of that particular incident . 
  also time travel . 
  edit : oh they fixed the typo . 
  the date in the first paragraph was `` october 31st , 2015 '' when i read it , . 
  so much for my comment . 
  well , granted , we do use russia as the biggest bogeyman lately ... personally i consider isis a bigger threat , because i do n't recall many reports on eu citizens leaving for ukraine to fight on the russian side ... 
  really ? 
  i 'd prefer if he stays away from mine . 
  like ... waaaaaay away from them . 
  i kind of want to keep them for the foreseeable future .
