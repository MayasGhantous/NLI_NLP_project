  i live on my own , do n't even have a girlfriend ( you may begin with jokes about my sexual prowess now ) . 
  you now do have an idea . 
  the number of persons here is 1 ( one ) . 
  a war ? 
  that would be madness !, 
  seriously , all war does is fuck stuff up . 
  also , who is `` we people '' ? 
  i am but one person on this side of the screen . 
  no , it actually just kind of confirms what i 've been saying . 
  `` men at the top and at the bottom , women more in the middle '' . 
  the `` top '' and `` most desirable '' professions being dominated by men is also a fact , and i do not deny it . 
  but proper equality shoves women away from the middle , not towards top . 
  which means that while some move up , just as many have to move down . 
  if this all blows up i 'll either be dead or screaming `` i fucking told you so '' at the top of my lungs . 
  or maybe i 'll be dead-ed while screaming that . 
  this `` witty comment '' is as old as gunpowder  . < but hey , yeah , let 's feel all smug and smart because people do n't get that by `` lead poisoning '' we meant `` getting shot '' ... ... but wait ... homicides and suicides are down !, 
  there are some professions that are more `` desirable '' and `` prestigious '' , that 's a fact . 
  but it 's also a fact that the less `` desirable '' and `` prestigious '' professions are less commonly taken by choice , but more likely because a man ( because it 's nearly always a man ) has a choice between taking it to make ends meet , or having himself ( or his family ) starve . 
  it 's okay to give a man such a choice . 
  try giving it to a woman . 
  see what happens . 
  horse !? 
  pfsh !, 
  it was a glorious bear , not a horse !, 
  the horse has been beaten to death by now ( and we 're still beating it ), 
  `` evil '' is just a synonym for `` i do n't like what that guy is doing '' . 
  as if it 's somehow his fault that you do n't like it . 
  i mean , putin may be a kgb asshole , but he 's not `` evil '' . 
  amoral , maybe , but not `` evil '' . 
  the funny thing is that they 've not really gone anywhere far , like , ever . 
  well ... i am surprised that nobody is clamoring for gender equality among cleaning stuff and miners , * but only if someone says they 're interested in gender equality across the board * . 
  but sure , if women are n't interested in more...low-rank professions , that 's okay . 
  that 's what men are for , after all . 
  they should be grateful they even have a job , the conceited fuckers , right ? 
  hey , it 's the least people can do to feed each other 's egos around here . 
  that 's what the internet is all about . 
  when can we get `` percentage of women in the lowest ranks of society '' ? 
  that 's going to be a sobering picture . 
  `` men at the top , women at the bottom '' is incorrect . 
  it 's more like `` men at the top * and * bottom , women in the middle '' . 
  so , equality means some women would rise in social status ... but just as many would drop . 
  i believe we 're already working on that ? 
  i think . 
  was making a joke at that election thing they had a few years ago when the voter percentages added up to 140 . 
  ehh , no . 
  that 's not what russia needs to do , that 's what we want russia to do . 
  there 's a difference . 
  and just for the record , i 'd like to see that happen . 
  not because russia `` needs '' to do so , but because i 'll be better off when it happens . 
  did i read it ? 
  * we will never knooooooow ... . *, 
  yes , this is also true . 
  there should still be constant discourse into that direction with a clearly set midterm plan . 
  yep , pretty much this . 
  now if only we can shift the momentum away from farage , le pen , and the like ... 
  eh , 140 % , nothing abnormal , they just really love him . 
  well it 's still `` mental disorder that is the result of stress caused by past traumatic events '' , and not `` feeling like a normal person feels after years of shooting and probably killing people , being shot at , and seeing your less fortunate companions die in front of your eyes . '', 
  do n't worry about it , i 'm running into the same problem rather often ... 
  yeah , i figured this was one of such liberties , since ... well , it 's just not a line i 'd expect a person to casually say if not scripted :d, 
  wait , it 's actually historical ? 
  welp , i stand corrected , i thought they were making a joke in blackadder . 
  that 's something most soldiers are not prepared for because the human psyche simply does n't work that way . 
  sure , we do n't * call * it shell-shock anymore , because that makes it sound really bad , we prefer to gloss over it by calling it ptsd , and all ... 
  either the change will be rapid , but not necessarily for the best ( let 's face it , a country in economic and political crisis is n't exactly an environment that attracts the level-headed , democratic and liberal types ) , or putin 's rule will be solidified completely . 
  which is also not necessarily for the best . 
  either way , it 's a gamble . 
  the russian one . 
  i was making a pun on `` radical '' as in `` having mad skills with a skateboard '' , parachuting seems close enough ... 
  i dunno , `` why am i suddenly feeling as if i got radiation poisoning '' might be a contender too . 
  austria , sweden , finland , cyprus and ireland are n't . 
  poor italy ... 
  the orthodox church is getting kinda radical . 
  gnarly , too . 
  i think the `` turbulent priest '' ( cookie points for using a blackadder reference ) scenario is a little more likely since putin gained nothing by nemtsov being killed . 
  i mean sure , he was allegedly going to `` present decisive evidence of russian involvement in ukraine '' ; but , seriously , we do n't need that since we have so much of it already . 
  the only thing more decisive than what we already have is an outright russian confession ( and then we 'd likely suspect they 're lying about the numbers ) . 
  why 'd russia ask for nukes back from ukraine if they were going to put them there again anyway . 
  well excuuuuuuse me for having an imagination and speaking hypothetically . 
  i 'm not talking as eu being `` opposition '' to nato but rather more as being a member as one entity , as opposed to its member states being members of nato . 
  in 50 + years , i can see this thing working , if the eu is still around at that time . 
  but unless we fix our economy , * it wo n't be * . 
  eh , it was already clear before an investigation started that we 're not going to believe a word russians say , since their track record with transparency of such investigation is very bad to put it mildly . 
  we would n't believe them even if they happened to tell the truth this time , because they 've done this shit so much . 
  and they 're not going to seriously bother telling the truth ( or even finding it ) , either . 
  a bit of a `` boy who cried wolf '' story . 
  so , a minimum percentage of gdp because of nato obligations , and a minimum percentage of gdp for the eu military obligations ... that is n't something you 're going to be able to sell to everyone . 
  and if making a transition ( i.e. 
  eu member states that are in nato leaving nato and committing to the eu military , and the transatlantic military cooperation being redefined between usa , canada and eu ) , this would be a bad time for it , no ? 
  also , this might be a hard sell for member states who have historically been neutral ( tho the recent russian shenanigans are making even the nordics start to work on military readiness it seems ) . 
  yeah , that 's completely not what i said . 
  would it have helped if i put a `` because '' between the two sentences ? 
  i 'm saying that multinational corporations are eventually going to * become * `` such a government '' . 
  i 'm not sure how that follows from what i said . 
  in fact , i 'm not sure how that follows from what i 've said at all . 
  you 've got the wrong one here . 
  i do not have a smartphone at all  but please do keep making an ass of yourself by assuming stuff , it 's entertaining , 
  the time of sovereign nation states seems to be nearing its end , really . 
  powerful multinational corporations are already trying to secure a foothold . 
  is it at 140 % yet ? 
  though , i actually am not surprised that putin 's support will be on the way up right now .
