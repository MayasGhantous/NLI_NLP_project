considering that only one guy is replying here ... do n't bring this on us whole , appreciated , 
  nice you guys will do the search and we 'll do destroy . 
  nothing can go wrong, 
  damn did n't expect that slovens work less than austrians, 
  [ here a quick look ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ppppc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=world:earth&amp;idim=country:hr:ba:si:rs:il:mk:us&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ) us and israel are just for the comparison . 
  for spanking part i only find czech republic , slovakia and some parts of poland supposed to practice this according to wiki page, 
   every municipality in slovenia has a better coat of arms , than the country itself !, 
  amen !, 
  fellow slovene to the rescue ... [ putin , putout ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-wfkny0mzq ), 
  if he will keep bringing them trophies for usn ( united states of novaks ) then i do n't mind that his name is actually novak and not the surname . 
  so yeah . 
  united states of novaks ... where the candidates for the future president will be maciej nowak , jan nov\u00e1k and matic novak . 
  check this [ language ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gfm_9felhq ) and now imagine that all slovenes would speak like this , 
  reading all this makes me think why are u so arrogant towards westerners . 
  its up to you to make your country a better place not them . 
  besides all westerners are not the same and the same goes for the eastern countries . 
  sadly i ca n't add the fourth quarter now . 
  totally forgot about it even though i was fully aware when i was reading it . 
  thanks for noticing it . 
  xd i took me few seconds to figure this [ ghetto slovene ] ( https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a4%d1%83%d0%b6%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b5 ), 
   i guess my comment only applies to serbo-croat then ? 
  you got that right, 
  and esti will be [ like ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8swmaqyqf0&amp;t=2m32s ) after seeing your post, 
  this guy never disappoints me although i must say i was expecting something about homosex and the heck he could add also some putin bots into . 
  i 'm not an expert but i think it might be due to building ships in the past . 
  for instance i 've read that malta had trees in the roman times and they were all used for the ship manufacturing in that time . 
  i got a feeling that you are biased, 
  i 've seen this in the europe according to the hungarians map sometime ago were it said small austria and i wonder from where did u get this image from . 
  i mean i have nothing against it  if its something worth i take it as a compliment . 
  i think whining is our national sport and someone might say well everyone whines well yes it 's just that we carried to the whole new level in some aspects . 
  but this put aside slovenia is really highly ranked here on this research which made me thinking a lot . 
  i think slovens are just a bunch of naive people thinking that green lawns are just across the alps and nothing can go wrong there . 
  this mentality can hurt us on the long run , i like how for instance estonia is presenting itself , like a modern progressive e-tech society and its catching up , who knows what we will talk about them in decades from now . 
  i think that 's the good way to move forward and build up a successful country ... enough of my yapping for now , 
  in slovenian zahod is west and in bosnian ( i guess ) they use it for the toilet . 
  the only fals friend between polish and slovenian that i know of is grad which is fortress in slo and hail in polish , so combining the two meanings i can imagine the siege , 
  so which one they had in mind for space station `` mir '' , 
  if austria is eastern then so it can be slovenia xd, 
  all them people died by our hands, 
  makes me sick tho, 
  i guess that could be a good mnemonic to distinguish them , 
  sorry cuz im not following things in cz enough so i guess i can ask u here is there any date when you will start using euro ? 
  or what is the current plan of the government ? 
  after i posted i actually start thinking about currency rate changes and etc. 
  im wondering what kind of impact this would make on the salaries and economic growth ... swiss frank comes in mind, 
  well seeing how the cabs drive in belgrade it makes sense, 
  actually when we think about gdp ppp per capita than u guys are on the same level but when we talk about nominal value , the one actually giving wages well you can see czech republic is somewhat ( to my surprise ) quite far behind comparing to cyprus and spain ... [ u can see it here it is nominal gdp per capita and i took the liberty to add some countries which i think u might find interesting to compare with ] ( http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=k3s92bru78li6_#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ngdpdpc&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=world&amp;idim=country:si:es:cy:cz:sk:gr&amp;ifdim=world&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en_us&amp;ind=false ), 
  and its the most expensive out of them so yeah like swiss , 
  2.2 % out of 18,959.218 $ in 2017 for us or 3.2 % out of 1,375.558 $ in 2017 for russia ... source for [ nominal gdp ] ( https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2013&amp;ey=2020&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=63&amp;pr1.y=13&amp;c=922%2c111&amp;s=ngdp_r%2cngdp_rpch%2cngdp%2cngdpd&amp;grp=0&amp;a= ), 
  first i thought that slovenia is at least on the weed map but then when i zoomed in i realized that the smoke is coming out of zagreb . 
  and they usually have problems with other roma who consider them as traitors ... just to continue ... 
  shush not so loud ... 
  the dialects to the west ( reddish area ) how close are they to the polish and slovakian languages ? 
  and the ones to the east ( dark yellow , slobozhan ) how similar are they to the russian ? 
  man this title  ... `` slovenia threatens '' ( what , where , whom , how , why ) `` to follow austria with border checks '' ... oh its about that nwm then, 
  we can share it and name it carantania ^ ^ they 'll be our little minions, 
  wow we can into albania , more land , sea and mountains i can live with that , i 'll just take my gdp with me , 
  due to this i can appreciate how ignorance is bliss, 
  cuz trans-white is not healthy, 
  for instance i was the only one not in the retirement age at the place . 
  my sister did n't go coz she didnt want to dress and go outside . 
  but the older lady in front of me when i was waiting there in line complained that she is sick and that she barely made it to get to vote . 
  so sad tho . 
  just read that , got some closure and now i can get some sleep . 
  thanks dude, 
  fuck the landscape when all what u see are morons on it, 
  same here i was the only one not in the retirement age at the place . 
  my sister did n't go coz she didnt want to dress and go outside . 
  but the older lady in front of me when i was waiting there in line complained that she is sick and that she barely made it to get to vote . 
  so sad tho . 
  the last poll i saw showed 47 % against and 45 % in favor with 8 % undecided . 
  so it 's gon na be really tight one on sunday . 
  anyway the main problem is adoption for those who are against and they use this argument on every occasion if there would be only marriage in question it would pass with flying colors . 
  and also older tend to be against and they always show up in bigger numbers than young generations which dont really care much about anything but their thing ( ironically ) ... 
  i guess it depends in which country you are ... if im somewhere in western europe it sounds to them russian or polish in the eastern europe sounds like some slavic but they cant tell which ... and the usually question i get in belgrade when they hear me speaking slovene is are you from czech republic ? 
  hahahaha some european language  nice, 
  immigration , world poverty and [ gumballs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpjzfgchgle ) this holds your argument in a way, 
  makes me think of [ idiocracy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl1-340odcm ), 
  thats what i think coz i heard on some news that some inhabitants of some villages close to kolpa river will do it in sign of protest . 
  well `` lj '' are two letters in slovene same goes for `` nj '' and most of us do n't pronounce the `` j '' letter after . 
  so saying lublana is totally fine . 
  i asume you are coming from bcs language group where this is one letter , corect me if im wrong . 
  dude your link ... 
  well done !, 
  your score : 100 % 1:20 ^ ^, 
  i guess this would [ be ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8kv-mjinm&amp;list=rds-8kv-mjinm&amp;index=1 ) what slovenia has to offer ... there are some regional differences tho , like at coast for instance but mainly thats how folk music sounds on the sunny side of the alps, 
  haha, 
  u guys made my day , 
  slovenia did not yet publish q3 growth report ... they will do so on 30th of november ... same goes ( different dates ) for some other countries missing in ops chart . 
  they used ppp balanced incomes makes more sense than having an actual nominal salary coz things have different prices in different countries plus looking at average monthly salary doesnt tell you alot tho, 
  this reminds me of loading screen in rome total war 2, 
  to be honest lately croatian side is sending em scheduled through official border crossings so things have improved . 
  but the thing is slovenia has to control also a schengen border . 
  so if germany , sweden etc. 
  stops receiving new waves of refugees/migrants then the schengen border will need to be closed or supervised , meaning that so called `` green border '' will need to be secured . 
  about the fences on border as far as i got it croats are saying that field belongs to croatia cuz that particular field is owned by some croatian citizen . 
  slovens are saying that border goes trough the river and everything north from the river bank belongs to slovenia and everything south from it to croatia . 
  latter makes more sense to me since u can always buy land abroad and the rivers were always making natural borders and later on also state borders in many instances ... anyway i hope this will be resolved soon in a normal manner for both sides involved, 
  interesting thanks !, 
  hey man can you explain me in few words how come that some people speak catalan in sardinia ?
