  slovenes like to make fun and list 4 languages known as bosnian , serbian , croatian and montenegrin , which are basically ... i didnt say anything ^ ^, 
  i think you mean [ inequality-adjusted hdi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_hdi#2014_inequality-adjusted_hdi_.28ihdi.29_.282015_report.29.5b6.5d ) btw czechs are on 14th place . 
  but yeah i hate this predictions judging by them slovenia should have 38k per capita ppp in 2013 and we are not even close today . 
  bottom line is everything can change literally overnight as it happened in 2008 . 
  let 's wait first for uk to leave and then see what happens . 
  as of now uk is still part of eu and all its economic spheres . 
  and the other two options in south slavic are sega ( bulgaria and macedonia ) and zdaj ( slovenia ), 
  you guys forgot italian dio porco !, 
  hey , my initial values were wrong since i was n't looking for ischemic but all cardiac-related deaths so i guess value of 82 could be right since there are similar values from my source and keshroger point that out . 
   for 2014 it says that 102,8 men and 78,4 women died per 100.000 people . 
  btw thanks for the update and i must say i really appreciate your work with maps and stats !, 
  you are right i was using data for all coronary associated diseases ( 2.4.1 graf 1 ) not just the ischemic ones, 
  since there is no data for slovenia on this map i can estimate that based on what i found it is somewhere between 256 per 100k for men and 171 for women . 
  so i guess the number should be around 220-230 since there are more men dying than women from coronary heart diseases . 
  and i can estimate that the number would be lower in the western part and gradually increase towards east and south-eastern parts . 
  * [ source ] ( http://www.nijz.si/sites/www.nijz.si/files/uploaded/publikacije/letopisi/2014/2.4.1_szb_2014_koncna2.pdf ) i was also checking for greece but i ca n't really say the figure ... but from what i 've seen i can say they should have one of the lowest in the eu . 
  guys seriously what kind of bullsh ... is this , uk is still officially part of eu so talking about the growth like they are outside is just silly, 
   tallest where did you see that statistics , afaik this should n't be right . 
  unless they mistake us/them for someone else ... 
  well something is to know the language and speak it and something else is to be grammatically good at it and the latter is shown on your link . 
  actually it 's an interesting map to compare it with the one op posted . 
  so for instance you can see that less people are able to hold a conversation in english in romania than lets say in france , but the ones who can hold it they speak it better than the average french guy . 
   not sovereign countries . 
  i did n't imply that . 
   serbia , bosnia , montenegro , macedonia , slovenia , croatia basically they did exist but they were together formed into socialist federation . 
  but still every country have had some sort of autonomy . 
  something like you can find in us today-some have legalized it sooner some later . 
  judging by this two pages from wiki . 
  frist about [ slovenians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovenes ) and second about [ carinthian slovenes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carinthian_slovenes#current_developments ) half of 30k number would be carinthian slovenes , so the real immigrant number would be even smaller , tho there are some workers who drive themselves to work and back home . 
  i think they are not counted here . 
  well the best way to end the war conversations is to say that there is no black and white but there are all shades present in between and this goes for the both sides involved in war . 
  bottom line is nazis did there shit during the war and we did ours right after the war . 
  the best is to remember this and not to repeat it again and not hold future generations guilty for what their fathers did . 
  that 's what i think . 
  well history turned the way it did and there is nothing we can do about it now ... btw i do understand slovens back then why they voted to stay in austria . 
  if you think of them , they lived under some austrian type of rule since ever and not to mention that only men could vote . 
  and back then serving an army was a big deal and serbia just came out of three balkan wars . 
  then there was no real nation vibe present among common folk , they saw themselves as carinthians not as slovenians and also austria put all in the campaigns while belgrade did n't mind so much since they gained so much land that they could n't yet comprehend . 
  and also there was no karawanken tunnel back then so they 'd be trapped on the other side of the mountains and most likely become some new bela kraina . 
   germanization i dont want to pick a side or anything but i 'd just like to point out that we can only talk about [ germanization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/germanisation ) from 18-19th century onwards . 
  basically during the ww2 the part of slovenia which was under the italians had the most german speaking population you can check it here [ how it look like before ww1 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austria-hungary#/media/file:austria_hungary_ethnic.svg ) so nazis decided to move them out to more northern parts of slovenia which was occupied by germany ... basically when the war ended they find themselves in a fuck fest which was going on at the time - basically during the ww2 slovenia also had a civil war going on between home guards or whatever they were called whose allegiance was to germany and partisani so you can guess to which side german speaking population automatically belong to ... pretty much the only german speaking people who stayed in the country were those who support partisans , but their language was forbidden to use in public during communist yugoslavia . 
  i actually regret that history turned that way . 
  it would be so much more interesting having them german speaking neighbors living among us , i mean it would make everyday life more interesting . 
  there are still few of them living around but really few . 
  thats the [ dialect they speak  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as9_whxyuxi ) tho im not sure if this is pure gottscheer sprache, 
   serbs , croats and bosnians living in austria i 'm gossiping in belgrade all the time on slovenian and yet no one understand a word of what i was saying so i guess those guys in austria would n't understand it either  but yeah slovenian is this weird language that not many people know or understand , even our closest neighbours croatians mostly have no clue . 
  so i guess we like to use it when we are abroad and say staff out loud which otherwise you 'd whisper to someone . 
  so it happend once on malta . 
  we were on the bus and some nice girls walked in and we start talking out loud how cute they are and few seconds later one of them ask me if the seat is free in slovene , wtf ?!, 
  my friend is arguing with his parents now for like 5-6 months , because he wants to move out . 
  but they want him to move on the third floor of their house . 
  to me this is pure madness from the parents side . 
  the guy cant even have a one night stand without parents noticing her , 
  which part of slovenia do you live in . 
  and is this just your extended family ? 
  coz its sounds weird to me since most of families are not really connected at least compared to what people in the south think uder the family , so im bit surprised by your commenting . 
  and about whining , well slovenians need that as much as they need air to breath-weirdos . 
  so i guess you call this gross gross salary ? 
  hey are the figures on [ this page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage#map ) correct for greece ? 
  it says that the net salary is 947 $ and the gross is 1,127 $ . 
  somehow i ca n't imagine so low gross wage compared to net . 
   about that coup attempt comment , i 'm sorry you do n't get that i was joking . 
  ok sorry for that part , i did n't check the links u were providing so i was assuming you are one of those conspiracy guys , 
  why should we invest in the army there is nothing in for me ... if we get attacked by someone it does n't matter if we spent 100 % of our gdp on it ... and it seems smart that we dont invest into air force since that crap is expensive so i rather pay italians and hungarians to do it instead ... i 'd rather see bunch of new ems helicopters for rescue ... idk why we have army , just to give 7k people shitty jobs and like 70 % of them are in offices doing nothing anyways ... btw all the guys i know that are in army most of them are 45 + y are totally fine and i 'd say they are better of than some people in the private sector for start they do nothing for the whole day and then they talk how they do nothing ... so i 'd split army money between health and police and most likely we would generate more than 7k good paid jobs ... and about your coup d'\u00e9tat ... yeah its time for u to come out of your basement and see that no one cares about, 
  if they gon na type in why spain is poor i think google will tell em they are not ... it might be coz of latino stereotypes, 
  thanks for the info ... i was in gymnasium too but to be honest they did n't teach us more than in elementary ... more about some earth rocks and climate  but i guess it depends on a teacher itself sometimes ... 
  hey u have to remember flags at geography , coz we did n't have that or capitals for that matter ... i just wonder when were u in elementary school , before or after joining eu . 
  coz i was before and we only have pretty simple map of europe and a student should now whch countries are in benelux or western europe , central and some land marks etc. 
  [ there was this thing once that ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdtwtebpyqa&amp;t=1m26s ) ... [ god likes atheists countries ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvcdltjzehg ), 
  otrok v avtu ... otroci do sedm let gratis ... i think stuff like this must be funny for u, 
  i must say i really enjoyed reading much of comments here . 
  anyways i 'd like to add that reaching  30k in ppp per capita should n't be that big of a deal in my opinion . 
  but on the other hand reaching < 30k in nominal terms thats something else . 
  slovenia curently stands at 21k and our best was 27k in 2008 ( which was inflated back than ) so from this we can see that slovenia in a way is trying to overcome that wall of 30k which in my opinion means more than ppp since nominal can take you further when you buy abroad . 
  break into the car ? 
  where were u ? 
  im more annoyed by this visit than anything else, 
  me like this news much, 
  please do not troll here . 
  you are making a bad image of slovenia and stop with prejudices over the croatians . 
  portugals [ summary table ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_portugal#summary_table ) looks great , 
  just to put us on the same page since i see this is often misunderstand since people hear that referendum failed . 
  the thing is what [ itally ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_italy#summary_table ) passed in 2016 we passed in [ 2006 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_slovenia#summary_table ) , tho the italian has some more laws attached to it than slovenian one . 
  and this is the reason why we need to improve it . 
  so next step is full marriage ( which has no problem among people ) and adoption where things get complicated mostly by church guys hence the last referendum . 
  here is an example how this summary table should [ look like ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_the_netherlands#summary_table ), 
   lublana that 's how i say it and like everyone i know and i would n't say it sounds hillbilly at all , 
  ireland , luxembourg and malta will be published in the following week and all three are predicted to have high growth . 
  i would rather see a real acceptance of the lgbt population per country than this legislative view since it gives really distorted view . 
  the conclusion i can make out of this video is that people dont really have a cycling mentality . 
  meaning that most of them probably even dont know for what that weird lane where bikes are drawn upon is used for . 
  also would help if this guy would go slower around pedestrians made choke points or use a bell to let them know he is around . 
  i think romania will be one of the countries in europe that is gon na change the most in next 10 or so years . 
  in slovenia romanians are to often associated with roma people and also some highway gang incidents which happend didnt help much with the reputation since vans/cars had romanian registry plates ( sometimes also bulgarian ) . 
  my grandma made a mistake few times but i always corected her but she still cant imagine that people look like us and not like roma ^ ^ its stuck in her head  anyways i 've been once in romania with my german friends , we stayed two days in temisoara . 
  and man it was nice , we were all pleasantly surpriessed how clean and nice the city was especialy since we were coming from serbia and we were expecting trash like in belgrade . 
  sure the villages ( rural areas ) still need improvement and there is work to do but in general the impression was positive . 
  also i saw one ambulance on the emergency run and cars were moving aside to let ambulance to pass through and again i compared this to belgrad where u dont see this to happen . 
  and also on reddit i found so much about your country and culture .
