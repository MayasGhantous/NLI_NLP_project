  in future i might go on a longer trip across romania to find more . 
  i think you are talking from geographical point of view and the other slovens from the cultural point of view . 
  geographically around 50 % of slovenia is placed within balkan peninsula . 
  culturally we belong into central europe . 
  i live in belgrade for a while now . 
  and from what i 've seen i can tell that we are really different . 
  but the thing i noticed the most tho is that most of people dont now much about slovenia . 
  most older would say that they used to serve army there and thats about it . 
  when im in a group with other internationals and the serbian guy start talking something about serbia like about kafana stuff and after he asks us from where we are comming from and upon finding that im from slovenia he says well this guy can teach u all about kafana  the thing is we dont have kafanas . 
  i could give u more examples but i think its not gon na change your opinion anyways . 
  if u havent been to de\u017eela you are welcome to do so , 
  is this made by names or surnames , because the previous president was danilo t\u00fcrk and would make more sense why turkic than for current president borut pahor and what do u mean by :  slovenian president 's name `` boris '' mistake ? 
  a recession is a negative economic growth for two consecutive quarters . 
  [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recession ), 
  damn time to change my country 's flair, 
  women are like a good wine , best left to mature in a cellar . 
  well it happend to my mom when she was buying bread . 
  she said that she wants hleb and the cash register gave her a lesson that this is kruh not hleb . 
  which is funny since in slovenian we call it kruh too but kruh is just a general name for bread and people usually say what kind of shape of bread they want , so as the guy above me said for oval shape u say \u0161truca and for circular u say hlebec/hleb \u010dek / hleb . 
  ps : so i guess when serbian comes to slovenian bakery and says hleb he always get the round one and when croatian comes to the same bakery and asks for kruh gets the question which one , 
  well i hope u can figure it out from this kak\u00f3 and im\u00e9 for instance . 
  so the vowel stress is different and its funny for instance once i said lop\u00e1ta to a serbian friend like 3x , than i said it in english and the guy was a `` misli\u0161 lopata '' . 
  so even the words which are the same in slovenian doesnt really help sometimes . 
  well about the music idk what they really listen since im not . 
  but there is as much croatian music on some radio stations as sloven . 
  and also some croatian bands have some concerts here and then ... i know there were some klape in my town last summer . 
  i 'd say older generations for sure , yunger it depends where they are growing up . 
  if its close to border , they go to croatian see side or listen to croatian music or have relatives from ex-yugo than yes . 
  but keep in mind we are talking about understanding the language here not speaking . 
  i could understand croatian and when i had to speak it first time in belgrade ( i know its serbian , in my mind i was using croatian ) i sounded wierd to them they didnt even understand my pronancuation of `` kako '' and `` ime '' which was mind blowing for me . 
  interesting usually i do n't see others with slovenian flair being offensive but i guess i could be wrong ... well i hope i will make your image better  but heck u have all kinds of people ... 
  it could be why not but im not an expert on poland but i 'd imagine that those days are also gone now for poland . 
   men leaving for western europe to work , often long term ( several years ) before coming back . 
  which country you have in mind ... since this is just not the case in slovenia or was the case ... maybe in 60-80s yugoslavia times . 
  but yeah to add my 2 cents i can confirm that last year they were looking for medical stuff being able to speak on albanian in [ velenje ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/velenje ), 
  i 'd like to point that title should be ; europe if it consisted of only slavs , latin , and germanic speaking peoples --  since those are language groups not the genetic groups, 
  i never check the comments on youtube since they give u a cancer --  scientific fact but i 've seen the top-listed one and it made my day ;  i live in the most sexually active coyntry in the world and i still cant get laid . 
  on a first glance i find german and slovenian words for flower wrong ... one is blume and other is ro\u017ea, 
   we dinaric guys really kick the average up . 
  might be a stupid question but what does it mean dinaric ? 
  i think that a lot of rumors about lesser quality of foodstuff came to be in 90s since all these new countries pop out into existence and as of time didnt have right regulations to keep things in check and some businesses exploit that ... sure you might find something wrong today as well but is more of exception than the rule ... speaking of slovenia, 
  nowadays no , but it was more common during yugoslavia and right after it . 
  i feel like those days are long gone ... nowadays they mostly have all the papers the exceptions usually are some small vineyard-enlargement and [ topler/kozolc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hayrack ) - enlargements mostly in some remote areas judging from my surroundings-dolenjska . 
   i think they mean the centuries of turkish oppression well then neither slovenia and some parts of croatia falls in that category ... but i get what you were trying to say . 
  no that 's about for those who speak english , how good they speak it ... eg if only 1 % of pop can speak english but that 1 % can have proficiency of 80 % . 
  the thing is sure we might be part of it in terms of geography but the part bordering us is the cultural ... and also hint tracksuits are rare in slovenia , but if you see someone waring it for no good reason than you can be almost 100 % he is some first or second generation from ex-yu countries . 
  my idea arise since all other ex-commie countries show such a big gap between east and west . 
  and i think a big chunk of wealth are also private enterprises which were impossible back in eastern germany . 
  my guess would be that eastern germany is dragging them down in this measurement . 
  i find the split between western and eastern europe fascinating ( if i take the cold war division of europe ) . 
  i think this is one of the economic parameters that will be interesting to observe in the next decade or two . 
  i wonder if gap will only get bigger or will slowly converge over time . 
  but if i think of it all ex-commie states did not have a single private business enterprise 26 years ago while western states have continuous tradition of family businesses , some going centuries back . 
  this comes to my [ mind ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sanctions_against_yugoslavia ) . 
  i guess i 'm obligated to write here ... 
  triggered !, 
   gdp per capita growth check this [ data ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.kd.zg?end=2015&amp;start=2004&amp;view=map ) its for 2015 , if u compare it with actual [ growth ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshtableaction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tec00115&amp;language=en ) u can see what trend certain country is going trough ( emigration/imigration ), 
  baltics what the heck what kind of christmas party did u make in 4q ... it seems u spread the infection on poland as well, 
  we were always the black sheep in yugosexia, 
  well the gdp here is ppp per capita . 
  for salaries its maybe smarter to look up nominal value and compare it to the gross salary and not the nett since taxes etc. 
  so for [ 2017 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_gdp_ ( nominal ) _ per_capita #imf _ estimates_between_2010_and_2019 ) estonia stands at 18,798 and lithuania at 15,838 ... and [ gross ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage#average_wages_by_european_country ) for estonia was in q4 at 1,182 $ and lithuania at 823 $ ... but this figure of gross can be skewed by some bonuses in november and december ... basically i ca n't get a full answer form this but it still makes more sense than gdp ppp per capita in terms of salaries . 
  i have nothing against strategic state owned companies . 
  but the thing is that in our case its 100 % state owned and this ruined so many companies since independence . 
  i 'd rather have a 22 % share of some company and the next biggest one would be let say 10 % so i 'm still the biggest owner ( and this owner is some privat capital-not just aka state again ) but now if i want to pull some political ropes since `` we '' won the elections all the other 78 % of the owners have to agree on this , therefore much much less space for political intrigues in state owned businesses . 
   i love my parents , but when it comes to economy they 're commie idiots . 
  my guys can get a bit heavy too but ever since my dad is working for some private company he ca n't stand the state owned ones ... and to the rest of your comment --  amen !, 
  here is another picture of [ slovenian costumes ] ( http://images.24ur.com/media/images/600xx/jul2009/60310690.jpg?d41d ) mostly they are used nowdays by folk musik bands ( ansambels ) . 
  idk but on wiki article u added i can see croatia dyed with red and light blue stripes . 
  light blue saying - other type of partnership and red - constitution limits marriage to opposite-sex couples but i dont know much about croatia , but i do remember there was some sort of referendum in 2013ish about not allowing the marriage something something . 
  ssm banned but civil unions are available ... thats what i see under croatia on ops map . 
   maybe it is indeed just a german thing . 
  idk man here you can see [ slovenian ] ( http://images.24ur.com/media/images/600xx/jul2009/60310690.jpg?d41d ) costumes . 
  the thing is ... people want to have state owned companies and privatisation and foreign investment are evil words . 
  but also imf is a bit peculiar when it comes to slovenian forecast ... in 2008 it forcasted that by 2013 we will have 38k per capita and now it is 2017 and we have 33k ... and last year we supposed to have 1.7 % growth but we have had 2.5 % , but best one is for 2014 , when we should have from -0.3 -0 % growth but we had 3.1 % ... so far they missed it big time every year since 2013 ( probably even before that , but i did n't pay attention before ) . 
  i have a question regarding how slovenia counts someone as foreign and someone as a citizen ( i case u know ) . 
  is it like this , when u get your slo id then u are automatically counted as a slovenian in statistics . 
  ps : i have nothing against immigrants in slo and the ones that i know are all role model citizens . 
  i see what you did there, 
  well taking in account average life expectancy in russian federation for males today it 's just 64.7 years by [ who ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_life_expectancy#list_by_the_world_health_organization_.282015.29 ) which is bad even for african standards ( no offence africa ), 
  people did n't disagree about same-sex marriage but about adoption in same-sex ... hence it did n't pass at the time ... now they put the same stuff on , minus adoption ( but u can still adopt but in a different way than straight couples can ), 
  i 'm always amazed how slovene-croatian intelligibility is mostly always one-way ... if we add other bcs languages its even more so one-way ... croatians close to borders understand mostly . 
   something like civil partnership that is what we used to have ... u can see it on this map how gay-rights look [ like ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/same-sex_marriage#terminology ) and about adoption ... a far as i know u can adopt it abroad and it is legally valid in slovenia ... and something if one partner has a kid from previous relationship , the new partner can adopt this kid but outside the same-sex marriage ... and bunch of other things changed in terms of insurance , taxation , inheritance and some other legal stuff like deciding what will happen with the partner if he/she is sick , since till now u could n't . 
  i think they wanted to show that albanian is somewhat connected to south slavic branch of languages and then weirdly connect slovenia and albania together ... serbian language or macedonian language connection would fit here much better , plus i think the line should be longer ... coz from the coments i can see that both albanians and slovenians are supper surprised about this and there is no `` blood feud '' ( as opposed eg . 
  serbia ) going between us and therefore this can not be influenced by our patriotic believes . 
  we just simply didnt know about each other till yugoslavia thing happened . 
  and it 's hard to believe that albanians and slovenians would borrow between each other since this two languages were barely a lingua franca on its own lands a century ago, 
  after all he has `` stupid '' as a part of his nickname ... so at least somewhere he is true to himself, 
  dropped my plate of spaghetti ... but who cares ... what da fuk was that on pic , 
  what 's up with the bird nests on top of finns, 
  til we prefer russia . 
  i 've heard that before , i actually wonder is there a figure of estimate for how much koruna will increase and are there talks how this will result in some layoffs . 
  also what is average gross salary in cz atm . 
   slovenia has the most gorgeous nature featuring in video sleet and floods , 
  how to approach to this map as slovene . 
  check italy and austria ... feeling bad 2 . 
  check others 2004 eu expansion countries ... not sure what to thing 3 . 
  check other ex-yu countries ... finaly i can sleep with a smile on my face . 
  this is a joke , it does not represent any official stance ... 
  yeah our standard language is more of a guideline than a rule .
