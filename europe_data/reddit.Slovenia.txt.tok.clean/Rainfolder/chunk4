  but usually you use `` da '' in very formal ways , or in the army ... 
  i agree that there is a lot in the air . 
  but a rule of thumb is if eg . 
  mothers generations ( 20k females ) have rate of idk 1.4 , nowadays generations of 10k females even with 2.0 cant reach the same numbers ... thats the issue, 
  but 100 years ago there were a bit more than a million of slovenes with average birth per year of more than 40k ... nowadays we get at best 20k . 
  the thing is even if this number gets now as high as 25k , the natural number will still be na fall because there is less and less girls from previous generations and our generations and next and so on . 
  the only reason why we have around 200k more people living in slovenia since the independance is migration . 
  some source from [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_slovenia ) . 
  yap they 'll need that blessing ... its [ them two ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utzorq5svww ), 
  we will send up to 1/3 of our forces to help dudes . 
  so let the chef know that he needs to make two extra meals per day . 
   we pronounce words exactly like how they are written i thought this too but then one friend studied slovene and start asking me on daily basis why is `` l '' at the end sometimes pronounced as `` v '' and sometimes not , why is `` kdaj '' pronounced like `` gdaj '' , why is `` s '' sometimes prounounced like `` z '' and vice versa , like `` janez '' and `` glasba '' , why `` vse '' sounds like `` use '' , why is `` t '' and `` d '' spelt but sometimes pronounced in the other way around why is sometimes `` nj '' and `` lj '' used but in some cases just `` n '' and `` l '' and so on ... and vowels seemed to be the hardest for him since we only write it as lets say `` e '' but this can be as `` schwa-\u0259 '' , \u00e4 ( not sure if standerd language has it ) , \u00e9 , \u00ea or \u00e8 . 
   country that big with less gdp than italy lets put it in this way . 
  24 million australians have as big nominal gdp as 144 milion russians in [ 2016 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_gdp_ ( nominal ), 
  i 've seen a lot of stuff he did so far but this one [ wins ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwxgqawojhu ) the day . 
  yeah i heard about that , i cant remember when or where but u can find it here on [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_albanians#balkan_wars_and_world_war_i ) and check the added sources next to the specific quotes if u are interested, 
  basically since only the high class have internet , its just them entering the data, 
  that 's it just keep it simple, 
  dude has some identity crisis . 
  for your information gdp growth [ slo ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/slovenia/gdp-growth ) and [ srb ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/serbia/gdp-growth ) . 
  let 's not start about the cheap loans . 
  that percentage is within the 36 % ( turnout ) or so who actually did go and vote the rest just do n't care too much . 
  and most of them were old and religious . 
  i like the name of the street in this particular circumstances . 
  when you see a picture of refugees walking through the village in this article and you are not sure if this village is in austria or slovenia . 
  you mean assholes in a good way yeah , like sleeping on your laptop and chewing your mouse cord and waking you up at four thirty am etc. 
  well overall growth is around 1.9 % in eu and 1.7 % in eurozone , so i would n't say stagnation but not quite optimal . 
  but on the other hand greece is finally out of recession . 
  0.4 % in q2 and 0.8 % now in q3 which is definitely good news , i hope it will continue with this pace in fourth quarter . 
   and would set the bottom wage at $ 707.60 a month can someone give me a gross figure i assume this is net . 
  well depends on the weather but i can see italian neighbor dramatically gesticulating all over again and austrian neighbor tries to be lauder than his basement but it 's too foggy to see hungarian guy doing something . 
  i 've seen this joke coming from my window . 
  yes i can imagine . 
  i know one turkish-german dude and when he is in germany he feels like turk but when he gets back to turkey he feels the biggest german ever . 
  so in a way he is neither and people can have psycho-social problems with less on their repertoire , so i can imagine for someone with identity crisis that must be even harder . 
  right if you say so then it must be right . 
  well i 'd assume he has this second generation problems going on when he can not identify himself as slovenian but as serbian , but then when he comes to serbia serbs see him as slovenian and not as serbian and he is caught in this identity crisis and therefore trying extra hard to show out his serbian values . 
  it does n't matter what language i just want his smoke stuff man, 
  do n't you dare to disturb goats at their work time . 
  damn cant wait for summer to come , i really like seeing cattle on hills and mountains when hiking . 
  i am glad that greece is growing for last two quarters which means they are technically out of recession . 
  anyways i 'm looking for december the 6th for the second estimate to see all the other countries not mentioned in todays one . 
  they 've stopped it for few hours to clean up the pile of dead birds underneath . 
  i got ta say i like this map since its not on a regular base of black and white logic . 
  planina in slovenian means a plateau , dont confuse it with croatian meaning , 
  afaik they do n't have transportation money , but i could be wrong . 
  i 'd like to add that most countries dont pay this kind of expenses to a worker . 
  anyways recently i have read what kind of money they include into average salary in slo and transportation and lunch money are not included ... so the real nett salary would be higher for around 100-200 $ per month . 
  here this page might give you some insight about average [ monthly salaries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) in europe . 
  and here is the info from [ statistical office ] ( http://www.stat.si/statweb/en/field/index/15/74 ) for slo average salaries, 
  you might like this [ wiki page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) about salaries in europe to have some orientation, 
  i 'll just say it this way , if you brand slovenia as a culturally balkan destination , the tourists will be deeply disappointed on what we have to offer . 
  i guess im not then, 
   considering the culture travel through northeast italy , austria , south germany , czech , slovakia , south poland and then go to bosnia , serbia , kosovo , albania etc and tell me to whom we have closer culture . 
  he is one of `` our '' identity crisis guy who has hard time to integrate into society , so at the end he is excluded by both sides , one telling him he is a serb and the serbian side telling him he is a slovenian , typical second generation shit . 
  down side of this is shit posting on reddit and i reckon on any possible other forum . 
  sorry i did n't see that question mark at the end ... but in case that someone would actually bribe someone else and this would be taped than i think hague would act differently than it did . 
   buy judges where do you get this info , i asume that is some media spin to sell it better . 
  it was just a talk between slovenian judge and a representative working for slovenian government and after that hague said that we need to change the judge and arbitration can resume . 
  some guy here even posted clips of the talks . 
  there is a new law which has passed in february to fix some current problems with gay couples like inheritance or if one of partners gets sick other can take care of his/her child etc. 
  about referendum , well that was a mess since it was hijacked by right political parties and clergy and they maneged to block the law by advocating that child adoptions would be inapropriate for gay couples . 
  overall it was also bad timing since right parties were gaining support at the time due to migrant crisis . 
  with a low turnout and majorly older people voting mostly on a basis oh no the left party came out with it so i 'll not let this to happen . 
  hopefully we will fix all the problems in next few years . 
  [ im surprised that no one posted some good old time cs go ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on-3i315hce&amp;t=3m15s ), 
  to be honest i was expecting bosnians , but its true that we get a lot of serbian immigrants as well . 
  so basically opposite of the [ idiocracy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzbwxgm0ygu ) . 
  since i see some confusion about why their countries are not listed . 
  if the country was included in the first release and since nothing has changed i did n't mention it . 
  since im waiting for sth and i have time : ** countries that have positive change compared to the last release are : ** belgium with in first release 0.5 % now 0.6 % bulgaria 0.8 % now 0.9 % denmark 0.3 % now 0.6 % greece -0.1 % now 0.4 % france 0.3 % now 0.4 % italy 0.2 % now 0.4 % latvia 1.5 % now 1.6 % austria 0.5 % now 0.6 % poland 1.0 % now 1.1 % ** countries having negative correction : ** finland 1.6 % now 1.2 % united kingdom 0.3 % now 0.2 % ** countries that were not included in first release and they are now are : ** estonia 0.8 % croatia 0.6 % slovenia 1.5 % sweden 0.4 % ** countries still missing their 1q gdp growth figures : ** ireland luxembourg malta * ps : since i see some confusion about why their countries are not listed . 
  if the country was included in the first release and since nothing has changed i did n't mention it, 
  here you can [ access the first estimate ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/8026125/2-16052017-ap-en.pdf/e25d3d40-54da-42b9-a1c0-ae1a623b6bbd ) which was published on 16th of may . 
  this reminds me of this [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-oyk2m4u3y&amp;t=1m5s ), 
  besides the pan-slavic movements in the times one of the major reasons was also that the state of slovenes croats and serbs ( from ah ) was on the losing side . 
  so [ italian forces ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_of_slovenes,_croats_and_serbs#conflict_with_italy ) were still marching further and more and more territories were claimed despite [ the london pact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_london_ ( 1915 ) . 
  but taking kingdom of serbian into the mix italians had to stop since kingdom of serbia was on the wining side and italian ally . 
  therfore kingdom of shs was formed . 
  i yearn for days when news like this will be top rated and commented news in media . 
  true in slovenia we are referring to this time as a lost decade . 
   ough , you were caught red-handed , bribing the judges !, 
  this is probably media spin . 
  they were caught having conversations between slovenian arbiter and one agent working for this court . 
  that 's it nothing else happened . 
  but the rule says that arbiters shouldnt talk with the agents coz they need to work independently , therefore they replace him with a new one . 
   were caught bribing the judge this is probably media spin .

  but the rule says that arbiters shouldnt talk with the agents . 
  to be honest i really did n't know . 
  oh ... nevermind i just wanted to say : let 's go italy , since i have heard this before in italy , so i guess it has also some negative conjugation, 
  let me guess , in future he will have some sort of eu scholarship and been to erasmus exchange and later on get a job somewhere in brussels . 
  what they have there in the tables are gross figures . 
  you are right but still [ 0.1 % in 1q ] ( https://tradingeconomics.com/serbia/gdp-growth ) for economy like serbia is really disappointing , i hope they get better 2q . 
  well i meet all kinds of people some being hard core \u010defurji and yeah there is no hope with them , just avoid them big time . 
  but they are not a majority and even other immigrants are ashamed of them . 
  a month ago i met one guy in real life after knowing each other online and we were driving in ljubljana . 
  and he starts saying omg look at this bosnian dude here , look that chick there totally from bosnia ... look that posh guy yep totally albanian . 
  and this guy is originally from bosnia and he is mocking others in this comical way since it 's obvious that they are far from integrating . 
  also i have one coworker and he is from serbia , well his parents are and gosh he is allergic on everything that ends on i\u0107 even though his ends too .
