  and i have one friend we know each other from childhood and this guy is the biggest slovene , but his dad is dentist and he lives in slovenia for 25 years and does not speak the language . 
  so problem with immigration is complex and it depends on from where people are coming and there social status . 
  when i was working in one factory i meet bunch of bosnian ( ofc . 
  slo is spanish village ) and some of them have plans to stay in slovenia for five years and then move to germany as slovenian citizens and what they told me is that a lot of them do similar . 
  also those who are unhappy due to whatever reason in slovenia tend to move out as long as they can , but you will always end up with some guys doing , you know what . 
  so the way i see it , is that we will get more and more immigrants . 
  we have 87k unemployed as of end of may , basically with the current growth we end up in our natural unemployment ( 60-65k ) by the end of next year , meaning we will start massively import working force like we did before 2009 . 
  so most of them will be just gastarbeiters but some will stay . 
  the thing i 'm trying to say is that , it would be smart to be open towards them , tell them what norms are accepted in slovenia , teach our kids about and help them to integrate . 
  if they dont want to then fuck it , lost case , you ignore them . 
  another problem which may arise is also eg . 
  this kids will have identity crisis , since they will feel eg . 
  bosnians in slovenia and slovenians in bosnia . 
  so during their childhood if they were ostracized and marginalized from some brainiacs eg . 
  skins , they will turn during puberty into this rebel mode and start to despise everything slovenian and congrats you made yourself a new \u010defur . 
  i know it 's complicated and everyone has its own view of it but i think we should get the most out of it . 
  we are not the first nation this is happening and we wo n't be the last one . 
  sorry for freaking long text . 
   minimum salary in poland is also higher than in greece and portugal i 'd be careful here . 
  i 'd say it is bigger when it is ppp adjusted , otherwise some might laugh at you . 
  i always hate this one way conversations . 
  i hope you grow up one day and be able of having an adult conversation and come up with at least three different conclusions beside black & white . 
  the thing is if those people are moving in and getting citizenships they are technically slovenians . 
  now it 's on you to make them integrate easier and show them ropes around or you know the other way around become a skinhead and kick them around which starts the vicious cycle of violence and prejudices . 
  mind that some of those albanians are bigger slovenians than you might be . 
  that 's nice greece so i guess we drink tonight !, 
  damn i did n't know . 
  i was thinking that this would be called as north east croatia cuz you know it 's super duper more to the east than istra . 
  but thanks to enlighten me :d, 
  when someone says we are culturally closer to croatians we have especially in mind [ northeastern croatians ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5fkveewvqs ) and istra . 
  they have similar traditions , music , language in kajkavian regions , food and similar history, 
  the thing is i wouldnt trust some ex-yu statistics . 
  in one i remember that they said that slovenia had in 1989 around [ 30k ] ( https://chnm.gmu.edu/1989/archive/fullsize/econ-module-yogu-gdp-chart-8_b2af6c1915.jpg ) per capita . 
  and that we needed like 20 years to catch up . 
  but the thing is if we check countries back than who had more than 30k , well they are only two swiss and luxenbourg . 
  sadly i ca n't find the full article . 
  considering my village did not have canalization , we did n't even have bathtub in my house ... so yeah figures dont ad up . 
  here you can check up stats for other countries at the time in [ ppp per capita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_past_and_projected_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita #imf _ estimates_between_1990_and_1999 ) .

  this year slovenia will finally catch up its pre-crisis level of gdp . 
  its a small [ place ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ankaran ) there at the see . 
  after the pray the mosque suddenly returned into its previous shape ... oh it did n't , damn gods why are we praying and killing then ... seriously wtf god/s * spelling, 
  why i have this weird feeling that i had to blow up this damn in some fps . 
  fun fact [ elan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt2jmdxuujs&amp;t=0m33s ) is not producing only [ skis ] ( http://www.elan-yachts.com/ ) . 
  i do n't know much about impol other than they produce aluminum . 
  well it was as long it was in hands of slovenes and croats ... now since they have a new owner they are doing fine ... and also tam still exists  just not in the same form as it used to during yugo ... peko im not sure there were some movements to keep some production but im not sure what happened since, 
  dude elan is alive and kicking , 
  the picture linked is not that far from the reality ... meaning that german guy there will dig for 7 and half hours and than leave ( he would use better equipment ) , while others would stay there for few more since their equipment is not so developed and they need to spend more time for the same work ... 
  they will all clock in more hours than the german guy , but he will get more money out since his work is more efficient ... especially if we think about money produced by worker per hour . 
  now do n't think that construction sector in germany or greece are drastically different but difference on the country level is made by added value in industry and other sectors and % of population working within . 
  where you can make same product in one country by 4 guys working it or one guy operating 3 robots and this leads to a snowball effect . 
  if you just take a look at export added value of [ greece ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/grc/#exports ) and [ germany ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/deu/#exports ) you ' can tell that most of the products in german graph would cost more on the market . 
  now if we take average [ gross salary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage ) of germany 3700 $ and greece 1200 $ and divide this with numbers of hours worked we can see a even bigger gap ... 
  the thing is greece is not lazy but just vastly less efficient . 
  like comparing feudal system with industrial revolution , guess who will have more hours clocked in . 
  and the working hours do n't give the full picture here . 
  long story short ... tycoonzation through political background and parties connection in the banking sector was basically the only model of privatisation prior crisis ... there were some exceptions i cant remember more but eg . 
  lek about the ownership ... you saw where money was going when they were in `` slo '' hands ... anyways the best deal is that company is paying taxes and employees workers and invests into equipment . 
  and do n't think i 'm saying that foreign owners are better ... the thing is we have no people in slovenia who would be able to buy companies without being a tycoon . 
  maybe i was n't clear enough ... the golden time for it was during 2000s ... especially during 2003-2007 , when we could get as much money out as we got later on in debt ps : i didnt read your second part : about people ... i find them funny dreaming of swiss where capital is in private hands going from one hand to another for centuries ... while we were expecting country will do as good job as those traditional family companies, 
  well people were naive ... thinking that having nature like swiss is the only prerequisite . 
  soon after succession it was obvious that transition will be hard , especially since an average janez ( serotipical slovenian name refered by other ex-yu ) doesnt want that privatisation and this was hijacked by politicians and used for their advantages . 
  preaching that if the companies will be state owned this will lead to swiss like standart ... but they had their own agenda in play . 
  anyways it started good and the only companies who went bankrupt were socialist relics of the past era , most of the companies prosper in state ownership ... all possible agencies were recommended to start with privatisation during 2000s when some companies reached its peak on stock markets , but this did n't happen and financial crisis hit and most of the companies were in big financial troubles . 
  long story short slovenia actually did start more nationwide privatisation in the last few years . 
  and also people figure it out that if the company is owned by some foreign capital that does n't change much for them as long as company is running in good shape ... anyways mentality of economics is slowly catching up with average janez, 
  there is also no [ k\u00f6nigsberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaliningrad ) , malta , cyprus on it, 
  oh god facepalm , 
  from what i 've read so far there is no need for popcorn , it looks like a mature debate . 
  euro phagocytosis in action, 
  some extra info : the left mountain in the background is razor 2601m and to the right is prisank 2547m if you like via [ ferrata-iron road ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-sqps2exra ) going to the prisank through `` okno '' from [ vr\u0161i\u010d pass ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vr%c5%a1i%c4%8d_pass ) is sth i recommend . 
  it 's a small [ lake ] ( https://www.google.rs/maps/@46.4754158,13.7830769,3a,74y,170.08h,104.28t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-pj0_eglxgeu%2fvaozredw9li%2faaaaaaaaroa%2fiorgjubuzmm4axm9owmc3e_mdbzig5dgwcjkc!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh4.googleusercontent.com%2f-pj0_eglxgeu%2fvaozredw9li%2faaaaaaaaroa%2fiorgjubuzmm4axm9owmc3e_mdbzig5dgwcjkc%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya61.015392-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i7168!8i3584?hl=en ) close to [ kranjska gora ] ( https://www.google.rs/maps/@46.4837583,13.7824283,3a,75y,48.31h,90t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-ba3b9x9g3f0%2fviobvj4afci%2faaaaaaaacb0%2fncxml9e276edux7rdktnk-m6fp7h7jabwcjkc!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh5.googleusercontent.com%2f-ba3b9x9g3f0%2fviobvj4afci%2faaaaaaaacb0%2fncxml9e276edux7rdktnk-m6fp7h7jabwcjkc%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi0-ya250.90773-ro0-fo100%2f!7i9000!8i4500?hl=en ), 
  basically a layout of eurozone, 
  after checking this map i get the feeling that moving out does n't have the same meaning everywhere . 
  me personally i 'm studying abroad for six years now and this is regarded by some as living on your own but in slovenia you are still living with your parents as long as you dont get a job and pay your own bills-scholarship doest count . 
  in the case of slovenia the only problem for homosexual couples is adoption , sure there is some step-child adoption but its not the same as for regular couples . 
  and adoption is also where public debate gets messy , because it gets hijacked by some clergy groups and some political parties and then it becomes more of a discussion between them than actual gay people ... eg . 
  i 'm not voting for gay marriage and adoption since i dont like the party who came out with this referendum etc. 
   we have zimmer frei !!, 
  : ddd noup dude dein zimmer sind belegt mehr als frei ... its besser that way ^ ^ ^ ^ anyways countries missing there 1q gdp growth data will be published on 8th of june by eurostat and most likely a few days before by their governments or some other statistical agencies . 
  im hopping for a nice and steady growth in hrva\u0161ka this and next year !, 
  it 's not just the recent history . 
  also when slavic tribes settled the central and southern europe this area wasnt empty prior to them , but they mixed with people already living there and after that there were medieval conalizations - bringing people from non-slavic language background and also there were few new invasions of some other tribes ... all in all its pointless to talk about them as a genetic group . 
  today you can notice the differences between all three slavic groups ( east , west and south ) and also within the group . 
  fyi slavic/germanic/latin are linguistic terms and not the genetic . 
  i can understand this only because i can understand besides my native languages and its dialects also most of bcs languages and slovakian and some of cz ... otherwise some of the context here would be different , otherwise there are quite a few false friedns, 
  i did n't mean this as one of the reasons for the new technical recession but it was something in general that i was wondering if it 's still around and it got fixed, 
  if you consider that finland has much higher nominal gdp per capita than countries joined after 2004 you can much more appreciate how big this 1.6 % is . 
  romania with the growth of 1.7 % gets shadowed in this terms since romania has sth like 10k in nominal terms per capita and finland has 4x more ... 
  you need to ask some romanian guy ... i just copy paste that yodeling into youtube, 
   horea cu noduri is this how it would sound ? 
  i guess it 's similar to what i can hear in serbia ... thanks for the info !, 
  ow ok ... and i thought that you might have some polka/yodeling ensembles like in alpine countries, 
  i just wonder is it common to have folk-music with yodeling in romania ? 
  i 'd imagine if it is , its most likely in ex-austrian/hungarian monarchy areas . 
  this is a flash estimate for the first quarter of 2017 . 
  the data for the countries missing here will be published on 8th of june by eurostat . 
  one of the rumors that is going around is also that bunch of greek businesses especially on the islands do n't give official bills , therefore do n't pay tax . 
  i wonder what can you say on this and also is there any estimate on how much tax compared to gdp is/was lost due to it .
