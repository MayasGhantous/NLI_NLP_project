   most westerners feel guilt and remorse when we bomb actual terrorists , how do you think the western public would react then if we bombed innocent russian civilians ? 
  hearing on the news that russia nuked a few of the major eu cities , that would most likely shot down my frontal cortex and turn on some more primal brain functions . 
  what im trying to say that sitting on a warm chair looking on how we smoke out some terrorists might make you feel bad for them , but sitting in a house without the electricity , listening on a batery powered radio emergency broadcast on how gothenburg got nuked out , that would take your reasoning away . 
  here on this page you can check the data from 2015 for every country . 
  shortcuts for [ czech r. ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/cze/#exports ) and [ slovenia ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/svn/#exports ) . 
  yep you are on the right track ... what i notice is that czech and slovakian put `` h '' where slovenian and serbian ( bosnian , croatian , montenegrin ) languages put `` g '' eg . 
  jug & juh ps : there are quite a few dialects in slovene where they pronounce `` g '' like `` h '' so its not so foreign to hear that for me . 
  i agree on your basis that data can be skewed . 
  it depends also on how many other factors are in play , from the one how many people have access to the internet , their knowledge of english , but since we are comparing two eu countries this should not differ as much . 
  if we compare some cairo to some european city most likely majority of data is coming from the educated ones and from expats . 
  it also depends on the amount of the users sharing their data . 
  so in last 12-18 months there were 283 for vilnius and 416 for berlin data entries . 
  anyways data can be bias but i still think it can give you some general overview on what you can afford in a specific city with a specific amount of money . 
  it should n't be taken as a rule but more as a guideline for what to expect . 
  [ local purchasing power in berlin is 105.41 % higher than in vilnius ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=lithuania&amp;city1=vilnius&amp;country2=germany&amp;city2=berlin ), 
  well how to put it ... first my background i speak serbian on b2 level und understand it on c1 , i also know some different words between croatian , bosnian and montenegrin and i have been twice to slovakia where i learned some basic words and same goes for czech republic since slovakian and czech are simillar czech can help with it . 
  and if i opend now wiki on greece in slovakian-sloven\u010dina ...  gr\u00e9cko ( gr . 
  so first thing i didnt get it was dlhy tvar but than checking on the google translate it says longer form ( of the name for greece ) - slovene doesnt help here , it would be `` dalj\u0161a oblika '' . 
  then \u0160tat i figure coz of german . 
   le\u017eiaci v ju\u017enej eur\u00f3pe na juhu balk\u00e1nskeho polostrova '' located in southern e. on the south of balkan peninsula - i get this part mostly because of context and le\u017eiaci its similar to le\u017eati - to lay , preposition `` v '' is the same in slo , ju\u017enej is similar to ju\u017eni in slo and the `` na juhu balk\u00e1nskeho polostrova '' i figure from my serbian knowledge since they say ostrovo for an island and `` pol '' suffix meaning half so half-island = peninsula . 
  basically just talking about peloponnese peninsula and the islands . 
  prior to translate i can figure out of the context sth about latin name for this place is graecia . 
  but than the translation says that in most of the languages they use the latin name for greece . 
  i could get jazykov - jezikov in slo , t\u00fato - reminds me of styria dialect toti meaning this/that sth , krajinu - pokrajna in slo , latinsk\u00e9 meno i get it from the context that its latine name , the once i couldnt get form the context or my knowledge of srb and slo are v\u00e4\u010d\u0161ina and pou\u017e\u00edva first meaning most-ve\u010dina in slo and second to use - uporablja in slo . 
  ps this was an overview of a simple sentence in slovakian for me ... basically i can pick up most of the meaning as long as this is a simple sentence . 
  probably spoken would be harder to pick up . 
  i 'd like to imagine that in slurred speech with some minor gesticulation and reversed word order and followed by a hiccup . 
  greece go drunk , you 're home, 
  happend to me few times that i put sloven\u010dina instead of sloven\u0161\u010dina when looking for the slovene language on the wiki, 
  well you have to look at the population of montenegro and divide that with their gdp and do the same for albania . 
  so then you get gdp per capita meaning per inhabitant . 
  otherwise you can say that pakistan is richer than swiss in gdp ppp . 
  so checking at the imf estimates montenegro has 16,643 $ per capita ppp ( adjusted for purchasing power ) and albania stands at 11,840 $ as of 2016 . in nominal terms montenegro has 6,629 $ per capita and albania has 4,203 $ . 
  servus , so most of slovenes sees them as our role model , which in fact they are in many aspects . 
  i wo n't talk about what i know about austria since most of the stuff was already mentioned . 
  to me austria feels like this `` weird '' land where you know that its not slovenia but non the less you feel like at home . 
  its a strange feeling since i feel more at home in eg . 
  styria than at our coastline . 
  sry no can do vowels , government cuts and stuff, 
  i see that those jokes are not limited only to the croatians anymore . 
  just to point you out in slovene u say `` kurba '' and its rarely used , especially online, 
   cevapcici the fastest way to get them is to take some bosnians in and they will open cevapcici shops for you , thats how we did it . 
  right into the heart italy right into ... 
  my advice would be if you do n't know the immigrant try to be nice to him and help him with the integration to the community so you can get later on a naturalized slovenian citizens out of them not just bunch of \u010defurji in our worst case . 
  if you already know the guy and he is a lazy ass newcomer doing things you have mentioned than feel free to gossip about that individual . 
  in place where i live there are few albanians and bosnians that are the biggest slovenes ever , but if u ask them how come they just respond that comunity accepted them so well they feel they belong here , sure there accent is not perfect but at least they speak slovene , you know we cant say that for all . 
  and about religion , from what i can see there is a sharp decline among the second generation , mostly only to satisfy their parents for holidays , much like we do for our grandma if she wants you to go to church for easter . 
  i know you have your own opinion on this matter like does everyone else . 
  but the whole problem is complicated as you can see it in eg . 
  france . 
  but in the future we will likely have much more immigrants , especially if our gdp will grow and a lot of current working force is way over 45 years . 
  i know that people are complaining about unemployment but think , right now the number at the end of march was 95k , if you add two years of good economic growth this number will fall to 50k and thats the number of the unemployed from 2008 and 2009 meaning a pathologic lazy ass club , so from here on you would need to import around 20k workers every year depending on the automatization and the same trend was noticed in 2008 and 2009 if you have time you can check the numbers on surs . 
  so most likely scenario is that we will have to accept more and more immigrants and the way i see it we should try to involve them into our communities so they would not hang with each others to much and become a radical bunch of whatever direction , 
  maybe the husband has high added value it company and employees 10 it engineers with average gross salary of 8k $ and maybe she works online who knows , you dont have to be a low skilled worker if u are foreign ... dude never generalize nothing is black and white . 
  and about muslims in slo ... they are a productive bunch of people , most of them coming from bosnia or kosovo-albania and on the level of them being muslims we never have had any problems ... as of late i can see our brainiacs throwing pig heads and blood on the mosque construction side . . idk who wants here to provoke someone and make problems . 
  it would be interesting to throw some latin american countries for comparison, 
   ful hvala !, 
  dude this is how i 'd say thanks to someone ... i guess you got lucky here combining this two words :d, 
  or i can give you a few . 
  so the one you mentioned could be used in both formal and informal ways ... so `` dober dan '' it 's literally good day-word for word . 
  if you gon na go hiking people have custom to say hello to each other when you pass by on some trails , so there you can say `` dober dan '' or '' \u017eivjo '' which is like howdy/hello and the way you pronounce that \u017d is like in eng . 
  word for casual , that `` s '' sound is like \u017e , eg . 
  btw \u017divjo can be used everywhere instead of dober dan . 
  and the word for goodbye/bye is `` adijo '' think of spanish adi\u00f3s ... the way you pronounce it is basically `` adio '' ... `` j '' is pronounced usually like y letter in english eg . 
  `` yes '' , but here you can drop it . 
  for please you say `` prosim '' and for excuse me or i 'm sorry you can use `` pardon '' or `` oprosti '' and word for thank you is `` hvala '' the `` v '' letter is pronounced like german w . if you know this its more than enough to get some smile on their faces . 
  otherwise just use english and you should be more than fine , enjoy !, 
  all the stereotypes he listed only represent small % of population , which is further inflated by his version of regional stereotypes maybe because he is surrounded by them or just have an eye for them ... so what im trying to say is that if you go to ljubljana there is 99 % you wont see them . 
  hopefully there will be only one end so no other numbers will be needed . 
  btw this your description of sloven r\u00f6garog reminds me of gauls and their fear of sky falling on them . 
   ragnar\u00f6k : slovenes themselves are comically convinced of their country 's impending doom . 
  our new 2020 development strategy is to get this word in vocabulary !, 
  to avoid of repeating what others said i 'll give u some stuff we do different than most other european countries but have in mind that countries bordering slovenia have also similar things going on . 
  so what pops first in my mind is that compared to other eu countries a big chunk of slovens live in villages or small towns ( around 50 % of pop ) . 
  and people are usually really proud of their places and strongly connected into local community . 
  for example every small town has its own volunteer fire department . 
  and besides obvious things what firefighters do they also organize once a year a local party-for lack of better word known in slovenia as `` gasilska veselica '' . 
  on this parties they play [ slovenian folk-music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-8kv-mjinm ) , dance polka , eat sausages and well drink beer/wine . 
  another thing to point out how we like our small towns/villages are municipalities . 
  for a nation of 2 million + , we have more than 200 of them and some are really small counting only around 400 people . 
  also folks like there local factories/companies and are usually proud of them . 
  then we like to go hiking , others mentioned this already but yes i ca n't stress how much we like it . 
  there are few traditions connected with hiking but im gon na tell u only one . 
  so basically people are saying that you are not a real slovenian if you have n't been on triglav ( highest summit here ) . 
  and once you get there for a first time you get spanked with a rope few times , the good thing is that next time you can do it to some other new guy/friend . 
  then i think that average slovenians are obsessed with croatian see i 'll just put this statistics here , keep in mind that there is only two million of us . 
  [ most visitors arriving to croatia on short term basis in 2015 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tourism_in_croatia#arrivals_by_country ) . 
  there is a thing with usually older guys and mushroom picking , they just love it . 
  for the end i 'd like to add just one more thing . 
  slovenes are usually way , way more patriotic of their regions than being slovenes . 
  and every region has its own stereotypes like guys from gorenjska ( kranj ) being stingy , dolenjci ( novo mesto ) being warm and welcoming and \u0160tajerci ( maribor ) idk why i cant remember anything but that they dont like ljubljana folks and that they call them frogs . 
  there are more regions but im to lazy to go on . 
  damn , til . 
  well just check his history  and all the down votes, 
  i bet it must be confusing i 'm sorry for that but just censor everything what kontakni center says and that 's what makes more sense . 
  in ljubljana they can accept two critically burned in one day and in maribor one . 
  there is a network with some others clinics like graz and vienna and some italian but im not sure which . 
  ps : the other guys info is not trustworthy, 
  he is well known troll and what ever he says just turn the fact around and you 'll get it right, 
  hey man if you are anti eu and pro russian and some serbian migrant do n't portray your views on the whole country .
