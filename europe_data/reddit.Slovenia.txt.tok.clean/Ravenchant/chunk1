... right . 
  i need coffee . 
  * shrug * it was meant as a joke , i do n't really know what the border is like now . 
  and honestly , i could care less :p, 
  clearly google maps informations on that area are outdated . 
  see , you have to realize the border is like a one-dimensional string . 
  it starts out more-or-less straight , but when energy is put into it , it contracts and gets all squiggly . 
  because of global warming , the border is getting ever more complicated . 
  lithuania already launched a satellite though . 
  we have n't . 
  * sigh * someday , we can into space as well .

  [ the summit of triglav ] ( http://www.slovenian-alps.com/en/imagelib/magnify/default/kaj-odkriti/aljazev-stolp.jpg ) ( slovenia ) can get more than a thousand visitors per day in the summer , though i could n't find any exact yearly numbers . 
  some even consider that a * true * slovenian must scale the mountain at least once in his/her life . 
  accordingly , there are strict rules for environment preservation , but even so local mountaineering groups have to try their best to keep it clean . 
  iirc the sami language has it , and they live in that area . 
  a two-month pushback does n't seem that bad considering how many troubles the mission went through already . 
  just ... as long as it does n't meet beagle 's fate . 
  most of them wo n't want to settle for us either . 
  then the ball goes to austria and italy . 
  oh yes . 
  it 's definitely an acquired taste , but so are hot peppers . 
  honestly , i expected salmiakki . 
  op , you should crosspost this to ... / r/upliftingnews, 
  filthy lies . 
  we only make fun of italians , austrians and ourselves . 
  yup . 
  44 % here , i 'm honestly surprised we did n't rank higher . 
  you rang ? 
  gu is graz umgebung , right ? 
  i just hope this was one mentally deranged individual rather than some premeditated action and that all of the injured make it out alive . 
  graz is such a nice city too . 
  i 'd argue factory farming should be considered less acceptable than animal testing . 
  there are viable alternatives to animal products . 
  there are no viable alternatives ( yet ) for some of the testing procedures . 
  sams goes for the slovene `` prsna bradavica '' , affectionately called * little wart * . 
  i feel ya , southern bro . 
  btw - * do * you steal ? 
  i 'm okay with that as long as they accept and respect our societal values and make efforts to learn the local language . 
  ghettos are bad for everyone . 
  even if the un did want that - you ca n't punish people for being a part of someone else 's plan . 
  but they need to be employed in order to consume more . 
  countries that do n't give a shit about human rights generally do n't accept much aid though . 
  charge for the service ? 
  i 'd gladly pay a few euros a month for a facebook alternative that was n't riddled with ads and would n't spy on you . 
  what ... what pressure is your bladder under ? 
  [ tell that to our air force ... ] ( http://planewatcher.com/data/media/63/slo_pc-9.jpg ), 
  there 's a slovene minority in k\u00e4rnten near the border and a hungarian one in burgenland . 
  some stuff is bilingual , like town signs . 
  guess the fp\u00d6 does n't like that very much ? 
  i know an ex-governor of k\u00e4rnten was against them . 
  would be nice for a change , i still have flashbacks of jedward and that fucking turkey . 
  send obtest , it 's been a decade since finland won and the time is ripe :p, 
  `` of course i 'm still freezing my ass off '', 
  if they knew how to operate it , probably a core meltdown . 
  but with modern reactor types , this is n't nearly as big of a disaster as chernobyl was ... at the very least , outer containment vessels are generally designed to survive a plane crashing into them . 
  no , the backbone of our glorious naval forces are actually [ pletna-class heavy cruisers .

  there 's buckwheat sterz too , and it 's awesome . 
  i do n't have any info to offer , just wanted to say that it 's horrible how we can see news about the attack pretty much in real time , but can do precisely fuck all to help other than offering empty words of support . 
  still ... stay safe , you lot = /, 
  yeah , right . 
  thanks !,

   strong ties to albanian well that is ... unexpected . 
  we 'll need to add that to the sidebar . 
  why do n't we aim for a nice , round number ... like zero , for example .

  let 's hope it will stop before an armageddogan . 
  when were you when the new common language began ?

  [ hoxha is turning in his ~ ~ grave ~ ~ bunker ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet%e2%80%93albanian_split ), 
  i know . 
  a referendum for full marriage equality would n't have passed , we tried last year and the opposition 's counterpoint was basically `` but think of the children !! 1 '' . 
  so this is mainly an internim solution until the constitutional court decides otherwise or , uh ... the demographic shifts . 
  do n't forget hosting shitty amas and arguing about portion control of salami , 
  great - even if it is n't certain yet , the protests seem to have mattered .

  did georgia just grab a random guy off the street to present the results ?

  it 's good , but not enough kenny loggins .
