  ...  or they were saying that children of same sex marriages will get bullied and mocked in school . 
  the children will only do what they are taught at home . 
  if they were taught hatred , then that what they will spew it in public . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  these were the reasons my father used for being against . 
   against same-sex couples obtaining legal rights to adoption of orphaned children yeah , better no parents than faggot parents ... ( / s ) man , i swear people are fucking retarded . 
  who gives a fuck what gender the parents are as long as they care for their child . 
  not true . 
  only conservatives ( or other groups of people sticking to old beliefs/traditions/customs / ... ) are called backwards . 
  progressives , for instance , are n't called backwards . 
  then you probably met few people over 50 . 
  the elderly voter turnout today was insane , which shows in the result . 
  we can try , just as you can try to join us in the sovereign nation group  . 
  oh yeah , the turnout looks very low and sadly , it 's mostly elderly . 
  went to vote earlier today , saw 2 young and 6 elderly people . 
  doubt that it will pass with a majority , now the question is if there will be enough elderly voters to get past the 20 % mark for it to fail . 
  at least they know you 're from europe , and that your country is n't lithuakia :( . 
  excatly . 
  if the courts are good enough for the populace , they 're good enough for corporations . 
  yeah , not so far from the nordic countries . 
  yuppers , and football is played with a round ball . 
   calling it `` ice hockey '' is basically blesphemy here because its assumed by default that by saying hockey you mean ~ ~ ice ~ ~ hockey . 
  same applies to canada . 
  there is only one hockey , just as there is only one football . 
  hopefully we wo n't be slovakia anymore  . 
  find a whale ? 
  depends on the population . 
  if it 's 1 thousand people , not really , if it 's 1 million , hell yeah . 
  oh yeah , it has . 
  pay no attention to my previous post .

  tvtorrents for life . 
  been a member for 8 years . 
  we kind of are , but that 's becuase there 's just so many tv shows being made now , much more than 20 , 30 , ... , years ago . 
  every decade has its great shows , i was talking about tv shows in general , not the outliers . 
  there 's been a dramatic increase ( pun intended ) in drama in all genres of tv , even documentaries are now less informative and more emotional . 
  still waiting on the next black adder series , 984 years to go  . 
  is there some link between firefly and mr robot ? 
  because i love firefly , but i hate mr robot with a passion . 
   recently , tv shows have had a real bump in quality . 
  if you mean american tv shows , i have to disagree . 
  the only change in modern shows ( that 's not technological ) is that virtually everything is a drama on steroids now . 
  the best example i can make are scifi shows . 
  they went from being about another world and the characters were there to tell the story of that world ( stargate sg1 ) , to being about the characters ' story and the world is just a backdrop ( stargate universe ) . 
  and i fucking hate that . 
  i do n't want drama in a scifi show , or a sitcom , or any other non drama genre show . 
  you 're joking with the link , right ? 
  the top lists every battle fought by a muslim nation , while the bottom only lists the crusades , instead of every battle fought by a christian nation ( which would pretty much paint the whole map red ) . 
  and anyway , it still has nothing to do with my post since the west = / = christianity . 
  you ca n't honestly believe the crusades were the only times the west messed with the middle east . 
  your `` they 'll learn eventually to not mess with us if we bomb them hard enough . '', 
  could easily be a quote from a middle easterner , and honestly , they 'd be more correct than you in using it . 
  no matter how far back in modern ( or older ) history you look , the west has messed with them more than vice versa . 
   the population is enormous , and therefore changes are happening rapidly . 
  i believe it 's actually the opposite . 
  the smaller the sample , the faster the reaction , the larger the sample , the slower the reaction . 
  ( hehe , half of the words in that sentence are `` the '' . 
   only when it is committed by people who are third world immigrants , then that is suddenly relevant and means we have to do x , y , and z to [ insert groups here ] . 
  when committed by people who are not , then it 's just another statistic and does n't mean anything . 
  it 's the classic not one of us bullshit . 
  the more different they are , the harsher the reaction . 
  they have freaking porn conventions ( among them is the largest in the world ) for fuck 's sake . 
  they have an estimated 4000 strip clubs and 2000 sex shops . 
  and you fucking think americans are prudes !? 
  and since when does something have to be a family activity for it to be considered a part of society ? 
  methinks you 're the one with no idea what he 's talking about . . 
  it sure as fuck does n't look like it , judging by their porn , films , television , porn , music videos , porn , `` brestaurants '' , porn , commercials , porn , cheerleaders , porn , porn , porn , ... 
   and we always make fun of americans being prudes . 
  there 's a lot of words to use when describing americans , but prudish in definitely not one of them . 
  that 's too long . 
  how about something shorter , like `` union '' ? 
  we could call it the eu . 
   is this a cultural difference between the us and europe ? 
  do europeans tend to carry more cash and not use cards ? 
  yes and yes . 
  so that 's how it 's gon na be ? 
  fine . 
  * looks at google maps for any country neighbouring poland that is bigger ... * well hello germany . 
  fuck you , yugos were awesome . 
  i 'd probably be in a wheelchair if i were n't in a yugo during a crash . 
  the dashboard broke instead of my knees , where can you find safety like that ? 
  what did we ever do to you ? 
  i swear we did n't steal all your \u010d , \u0161 , and \u017e letters and replace them with w and y. 
  i got that reference  . 
  yeah , this match was more or less fine with regards to the refereeing . 
   people who try to blame it on the referee are just bad sports . 
  i 'm still butthurt about the 2009 uefa chelsea vs barcelona semi final match where tom henning \u00d8vreb\u00f8 fucking handed the win to barcelona by , among other things , not calling ** 6 ** ( or according to himself years later , 4 ) penalty shots for chelsea . 
  it was literally the worst display of refereeing i 've ever seen at a major sporting event . 
  that was the first match i saw in over a year , and after the shitshow that it turned out to be i stopped watching football for half a decade . 
   edited to add : anyone who voted leave just so they could go back to buying food labelled only in lbs and oz . 
  ( rather than both metric and imperial ) should never be allowed to vote for anything ever again on grounds of mental incapacity . 
  one of the best edits i 've seen . 
  ever . 
   the remain camp simply lost the argument . 
  how do you argue against lies and deceit when the truth does n't work ? 
   meanwhile everyone knew the cloud of ttip was lurking you do know the uk was pushing ** for ** ttip , do n't you ? 
  not for long if some people have their way  . 
   our comedians will never match it not true . 
  if there 's anything the uk has in spades , it 's great comedians .
