  ( to be fair though , a lot of them are scottish and irish . ), 
   i know little to nothing about the eu ...  i do n't like the eu average eurosceptic , and take away the * do n't * , average europhile . 
   a visibly angry ** mr corbyn then appeared to lunge in the journalist 's direction ** in front of camera crews and photographers , ** saying : `` if you want to arrange an interview speak to my press office . 
  thank you . '' ** really scraping the bottom of the barrel for content . 
   the european union is fundamentally the most anti-democratic entity currently in existence ... ... ... dafuq ? 
   finally , when it may already be too late , people have discovered how much they value what the eu has done for them . 
  i 'm amazed someone could actually decypher what those little cunts were saying . 
  i honestly did n't understand a single word of it . 
  do they cover the so\u010da ( isonzo ) front on the italian/austro-hungarian ( slovenian ) border ? 
  no idea , but i would like to say that it 's not like that over here , with the whole punishment vs rehabilitation thing . 
  the problem is n't in being a democracy and voting , it 's what was voted for , how it was presented , and decades of shitting on the eu . 
  the uk leaving the eu is in effect a divorce , and you 're pissed because the jilted partner is pissed at you ? 
  thanks . 
   society slowly becomes better in my experience . 
  well it sure as fuck got worse over the weekend in the uk . 
   ** r ** eu can someone explain why i 've been seeing this often ? 
  what is that r supposed to mean ? 
  you started it  . 
  does n't every western country have a lower recidivism rate than america ? 
   this is kind of strange , exactly  . 
  now that i think about it , german was taught in elementary school right up to the year before my class started learning a foreign language ( i think that was in 99 ) , and was then switched with english . 
  though high schools naturally had ( and most likely still have ) english and german as the two basic foreign languages . 
  combine that with centuries of germanic rule and it would explain why so many people here speak german , and like germany . 
  i know , i just found it weird that i could converse in english with the young and old , but not the middle aged . 
  like , how could knowing english skip a generation weird . 
  do n't know about the language and other former yugoslav countries , but for people here in slovenia , germany was like * the * country . 
  it was basically what america used to be , `` the land of opportunity '' . 
  off topic : i 've got family who 've been there ( in essen ) since the 60s , and we went to visit them back in '09 ( gg eu , no border checks , just a 1300 kilometre drive ) to surprise my uncle on his 50th birthday . 
  fucking beautiful . 
  i got so drunk at the celebration i could barely stand for the group photo  . 
  i still remember that space replica museum built inside a giant spherical tank of some sort we visited when we were there and i nearly shat myself when we went to the top of it ( scared of high places , but oddly enough not of flying in planes ) . 
  kinda weirdly though , out of the people i met there , only the young and the old seemed to speak english , the 40-50 year olds needed my uncle to translate . 
  does n't seem all that bad . 
  thanks for answering . 
   we pretty much have to either accept eu immigration or leave the eea . 
  how 's that been going for you ? 
  have there been a lot of eu imigrants moving ot iceland ? 
  asking for a friend who does n't like heat and loves eve online  . 
  pretty much , yeah . 
  i saw no facts being presented , just propaganda . 
  the nuk , new united kingdom of scotland and ireland  . 
  with the eu and blow . 
   try to understand why they did . 
  why , when even they do n't ? 
   love how 52 % of the country is now enough to generalise the entire country to `` you guys '' . 
  not a numbers guy , are you ? 
  anything significant regarding population statistics is enough to be generalised . 
  whether that 's correct or not is up for discussion , but it has , does , and will happen nonetheless . 
  ( asians are bad drivers , americans are fat and stupid mass shooters , canadians are nice , french are smelly , ... , and now , the british are idiots that fucked themselves over ) . 
   in europe your best defense is ~ ~ luck ~ ~ society . 
  a low crime rate is much safer than an armed populace . 
  a guy wants to rob you or steal your stuff . 
  there is absolutely no logic in shooting him . 
  the safety of your stuff is not above the safety of a person 's life , even if that person is a criminal . 
   you clearly live in some sort of fairy tail world where their is no violence and no need to protect yourself . 
  til europe is a fairy tale word . 
  seriously though , if he 's living in a fairy tale world , you 're living in a hellhole . 
  when i was a child , we used to have mild summers and loads of snow during winter ( about half the time we could n't even drive to our house ( on top of a hill ) due to the constant snowfall ) . 
  now , we 're growing freaking kiwis at our house . 
  outside . 
  with no greenhouses or anything of the sort . 
  in slovenia . 
  less than 200 freaking kilometres from the alps . 
  moral of the story : this map wo n't be accurate for much longer . 
  `` fix the car , for the boys in green '' love it . 
  that 's what i meant by greed  . 
  the currency bit was i did n't know if they got more expensive because of the shift to the euro . 
  i remember beer getting more expensive ( from the equivalent of around 1 $ to 2 $ ) , as well as groceries ( bread , cheese , meat , ... ) , but i do n't know if it was because of the currency , or greed . 
  i think the movement he wants is towards the middle east , and out of his country . 
  you know , non symbolic movement , as in gtfo . 
  no edge , just could n't resist a good catholic church paedophilia joke . 
   with him entering in a room with an older man , he become a man . 
  so just like catholics  . 
  meh , we get by  . 
  in that case , my suggestion is to read up on the laws the uk cedes to the eu ( and not from a brexit source , try to find something older , before all this started ) , and the benefits it gets from membership ( again , find pre brexit sources , will be much more impartial ) . 
  boil it down to this : if you think those laws that are controlled by the eu ( if you even know which ones they are ) affect you adversely more than membership in the eu ( and all the bits that come with it that you like ) , vote leave . 
  if the opposite is true , and you think complying with eu 's laws is worth it for membership , then vote remain . 
  and also , ignore all that sovereignty stuff , the eu being in control of some of uk 's laws is n't a new thing and the uk is n't in danger of losing itself in the eu . 
  disclaimer : am slovenian , and * we * will never leave the eu , unless we get kicked out . 
  though we 're probably too small to be noticed  . 
   it 's his mother 's ~ ~ maiden ~ ~ maidan name . 
   it will slowly erode away any identity it has well , we 've been members for 12 years , and we 're still us . 
  oh yeah , other than american and national stuff , shows from the uk were the most common on tv ( ca n't say what 's it like now , have n't watched tv for close to 10 years ) . 
  hells no , thankfully we do n't dub anything other than children 's entertainment . 
  iirc it was aired on a croatian channel ( one of the benefits of living close to the border  ) around the year 2000 . 
  i also remember ( and love ) ` allo ` allo ! , only fools and horses ( the theme song of which to this day makes me sad , since it used to indicate that i had to go to bed soon ) , father ted , a french and saunders show , black adder of course , mr bean , ... , and coupling from later on . 
  those were aired on slovenian channels . 
  yes , that 's the one . 
  thank you very much . 
  i 'm trying to remember an old british comedy series about a uk mp in the eu ( or something like that , all i remember is that it was about a uk politician and had something to do with the eu ) i used to watch as a child . 
  does anyone remember it ? 
  aah , got it . 
  thanks . 
  i thought it was the orange , as it says `` exclusive economic zone '' . 
   we are , in general , a more pro-free trade , pro-deregulation and pro-capitalist country than most of europe . 
  as john oliver put it ; `` europe 's america '' , 
   200 miles of fishing grounds . 
  care to elaborate on that ? 
  i do n't see anything wrong with that picture .
