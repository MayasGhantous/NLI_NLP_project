how much vodka ? 
  what is your school model, 
  they do , but among the many controversial laws inside the treaty are more than dangerous enough alone to not ever wanting to risk something as devastating as this . 
  negatives : this is by far ( in my opinion ) the most devastating article in the treaty : ** 1 . ), 
  ( investor-state dispute settlement ( or isds for short ) ) ** this basicaly allows us investors ** to sue an eu country ** if they ( and i can not belive such an article even exists , ) ** if the eu country with their own national laws in any way inhibits their investor intrest . 
  ** and these lawsuits go for bilions of dollars ( take for example switzerland vs. germany ) this basicaly allows all the small european countries who can not afford multi-billion lawsuits to push through any legislation wished for by corporate intrest from overseas . 
  it is estimated that 0,3-0 ,5 of the entire eu workforce will lose their jobs if it passes . 
  ** while if you compare it to the gains ( a hundred billion dollars in extra revenue ) you wouldnt think its much . 
  but that hundred billion dollars of extra revenue goes to big companies who make billions from trade/investments . 
  but most people who are estimated to lose their jobs arent some big companies but acual people who will be unemployed . 
  products treated with chemicals that are allowed in the us but banned in eu will be able to be sold in eu markets ** many food processing practices are banned in the eu for the usage of harmfull chemicals hazardeus to the human body . 
  but many of these practices arent banned in the us . 
  if this agreement would go through , all products that would otherwise be rejected from the eu market for breaking food/or otherwise safety-laws will be able to get into the eu markets no questions asked . 
  ( ( our countries media reported , that from a list of 1360 banned chemicals in food processing in the eu , only 11 of the same are banned in america ) you can imagine that if the eu made those 1349 illegal , they made them illegal for a reason . 
  -  and with this trade agreement it wont matter as long as the processing was done in the us and then imported to europe ( something which is against the law now ) 4 . ), 
  and many more downsides which i would love to go into detail but its quite late and im tired , the website should probably also have more information on the treatys articles ( remember most of it is still extreamly secret , so far we only have the documents that were leaked to us ( or negotiation `` guidelines '' later made public by the eu ) ** ( but most of the process is still completly in secret and the general public has no acess to it ) **, 
  she picked it up at the last possible day . 
  the ethics commite itself can not hand out sentances other than publicly exposing corruption , and fining them a small ammount of money, 
  the questions were acually very correct . 
  thats what i was most impressed about , i just thought they were going to give her the position because she indebted the country to the eu for billions of dollars and give her a cushy job because of that . 
  but the questions acually had merit to them , and were well constructed . 
  sadly her answers were general , she repeated herself all the time , stalling every answer by a 20-30s thank you for the question speeches at the beggining of every question ... she was asked the same questions regarding energy policies several times , almost the same question ( green energy , russian oil , nuclear power ) i belive she was asked on her opinion on nuclear power more than 4 times from different representatives . 
  her answers were so vague that they had to ask the question 4 times over the entire hearing and still they did not get an answer . 
  and the question that was repeated several times that she did not want to answer was : if you are found guilty of breaking the law by your national ethics comity will you resign as commisioner ? 
  - she did n't acually answer that , just kept saying she did nothing wrong . 
  then the representative of ( germany i think ) asked her the exact same thing again . 
  demanding a simple yes/no answer on the question . 
  again she did n't say that she would resign if it was found that she was breaking the law . 
  she just said again that she isnt guilty of anything . 
  that were the main problems of the hearing . 
  ( it doesent help that 95 % of the country hates you , because you increased public debt in a few years that in the last 20 years combined , or that you 're corruptive and abuse your functions to nominate yourself to the position , and ignore the mail of the ethics comite ) now the whole ignoring the mail of the ethics comite isnt a big deal . 
  but she said on national television , that if she ever , ever recieves mail from the ethics commite that she will pick it up on the first day it is sent !, 
  that she wont be like everyone else and stall it out . 
  - and guess what , she picked up the mail on the last legal day possible . 
  she lied to the entire country , then made a mockery of us in the eu parliament , thats why there is a general dislike of her, 
  there will be a recording made available on the european parliament 's website ( google it ) . 
  i suggest making popcorn and lots of drinks though . 
  because for the first hour you 're going to be laughing at her ... then for 2nd hour you will be feeling embaressed ** for her ** and in the 3d and last hour you will be begging her to stop making a mockery of herself and our country . 
  i agree , i was very very disapointed in her performance . 
  i never expected much from her to begin with , but she hit a new low with her `` circus of sadness '' . 
  as a slovene watching it it was tragic/comedic at the same time , how our own goverment can allow such unfit people to candidate for such important european positions . 
  i am now just hoping that she is rejected , because for the european union if bratu\u0161ek takes her place as vice-president of the energy commite ( one of the most important ones in todays tough/turbulent times ) is very screwed ... and to take into account slovenia has had constant political problems like this since its independance , and is struggling with corruption in all pores of political and social life , which we dont seem to be going through very well . 
  it 's in all our intrest if people like these never make it to important positions , but go to people with factual knowledge on the fields they should be representing . 
  she is a disgrace to our country who lied on almost everything she ever said . 
  she should just remove herself from politics and public life compleatly . 
  she isnt compitent enough to be a janitor and there is no way in a milion years she is compitent enough for an european comissioner . 
  please cite 0.2 % and 99.8 % your source ? 
  also you say that one of the top scientists working in europe 's best laboratory with a 2 million budget is junk science . 
  seems right no ? 
  i 'm sure they 'd give this job and a load of money to a bunch of incompitent scientists . 
  since when is science religion ? 
  you 're deluded , i dont know why and honestly i do not care , i 'm just sad that you 'll have the right to vote on this issue one day . 
  knowledge about the subject ? 
  i just sent you a whole dossier of knowledge and all you want is an arbitrary x : y of how many studies it will take me to support gmo 's . 
  thats not knowledge thats bullshit . 
  i ` ts not how many studies it takes to either aprove or dissprove it . 
  it 's if it 's safe and can the people who use it act responsible , because certanly so far gmo 's have been handled really porly , especialy in the us . 
  when the research is exacly 9975 : x that gmo 's are safe . 
  you 're blinder than i since you blindly follow your biased opinion and ignore everything else .

  misinterpreted by who ? 
  you ? 
  other scientists ? 
  the people ? 
  last time i 've researched on the subject several irish and english scientist have been fired from their insitutions when they released work showing gmo 's to be dangerous and require further research, 
  more than there is now . 
  many studies have shown that there are negligable side effects , while other studies have also shown they do have side effects meaning more studies need to be conducted to verify what is true . 
  we simply need more research on gmo 's . 
  i 'm sure they 're harmless when created and handled correctly and with care backed up by scientific research . 
  the last thing you want is another monsanto in europe ... 
  damn man . 
  please brother croatia , dont be like this , who will i visit now when i need the sweet relaxation of the sea when my own puddle is not enough ( and why you trying to take away even the small puddle of water that we have left :d ), 
  you do have to take into consideration , that just as savannajeff makes a good argument in favour , there are well constructed arguments against ttip , it is just that most of the arguments against that are posted here are usually poor in quality , and as such give the general impression that everyone against ttip is an idiot , which is of course false , but an easy mindtrap to fall into, 
  i remember watching a documentary very long ago , that installed `` radios '' on farms , and those radios would play a wolf howl from time to time , so wolves would avoid this `` radio wolfs territory '' and leave the livestock alone, 
  to me it always looks like somebody took a dumb in a bowl , and called it food :d, 
  4 day old account , 2 posts total - both about russia . 
  seems legit, 
  look at his post history - propaganda machine ... 
  so much propaganda from both sides, 
  i look at your post history and say oh-my, 
  one of our largest phermaceutical companies does a ton of trade with russia . 
  if i remember correctly ( found source ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia%e2%80%93slovenia_relations ) ) our exports : 60-70 % of slovenian exports are pharmaceuticals , wired communications systems , electrical equipment , mechanical installations and paints . 
  our income from exports has dropped significantly since these sanctions because russia is one of our larger trading partners, 
  look in my honest opinion : i dont support what russia is doing in ukraine and elsewhere , but these sanctions are doing nothing but harm to our countries already pretty weak economy . 
  hey , americans also condone russias actions , but they 're still doing trade with them , so why should we be shooting ourselves in the foot . 
  to me it felt targeted , but now that you explained it , 
  did i say an opinion on the matter ? 
  i just posted news . 
  ** okay so against : ** euro greens/eu free alliance ( some ) socialist/democrats alliance non-inscrits europe of freedom and democracy ** and for : ** eu peoples party alde ( some ) socialist/democrats alliance eu conservatists/reformists, 
  why does the stream have to be so low quality , and so choppy , always randomly buffering . 
  its europe damnit , they should have enough money for a decent streaming service . 
  yeah none of those here . 
  which is funny since i 'm probably going to go to uni to sweden in a year , 
  ah how did you find your stay ? 
  * gasp * has the rumour of the vinjeta spread to sweden ? 
  its just rumor guys its only cheap sticker that you need to buy to drive around beautifull country , nothing more ... * whistles *, 
  i agree that its a clumsy scale because either right or left its both part of the same problem . 
  for example if he ran in my country he would be considered right , but to be honest our biggest left-centre party transformed into far-right today haha . 
  in my humble opinion obama is very right and the u.s right is far-far-right, 
  in my personal opinion selling strategicaly important companies to anyone is a mistake doesent matter what country .
