  but of course its the balkans so people are always going to bring nationalism into every single debate ever . 
  but yeah people are also upset , because most slovenian companies 10 years ago , weew planing to take over croatian companies or expand in the balkans , but then these same companies got bought by the countries they were trying to expand into , so people are kinda upset because of that aswell ( national pride and stuff like that ), 
  for example in this article where mostly immigrant truckers get beat up by their employer : http://new.times.si/slovenija/pretepanje-delavcev-v-avtoprevoznistvu--124cbc236bbad923bf4094340b90cad7083f8275.html some comments ( translated ) : `` there is never a problem with our bussinessmen and directors / s '' `` yuck , these people are the scum of the earth '' `` yeah , and the driver must have beaten up himself ... , i wish they would give us the name of the employeer '' * many more comments demanding the name of the employer * `` our inspectors are lazy , if they did proper oversight this wouldnt happen '' `` the employer is uncivilized and is breaking the law '' `` i wish he could hit him back , sadly he would loose his job over it '' `` you cant blame `` southeners '' ( ex-yugo ) for coming to slovenia , we 're exacly the same as them just that we 're going norther , doing the same shit '', 
  acually i 've heard 0 complaining about immigrants that work in these companies it is almost non-existant . 
  everybody hates these tycoons , they abuse people that can barely survive , both slovenian and foreigners , and i doubt you 'll find anyone in slovenia that supports these idiots ( maby their lawyers will but yeah ), 
  it 's true that construction companies abuse workers . 
  there is quite a heavy debate going on at the moment ( more by the people , the politicians dont give a shit ) if you ever visit a slovenian news forum where a story is published where imigrants are used as slave labour by slovenian construction companies , all you 'll see is outrage , and shame , and calling that these directors of these companies be jailed and their assets seized . 
  we hate our tycoons very much because they alongside exploiting workers also steal a lot of money and are full of corruption . 
  ** but this does not mean all slovenians are thieves that betray and steal ** its some corrupt companies and directors , not the entire slovenian country . 
  _____ also in regarding to the banks . 
  our president said that we 'll repay all our debt from former yugoslavia that our banks had . 
  no ex-jugoslavian country has promised to pay back slovenian banks that lended a ton of money but never got it back after the war , but we said we 'll repay what we owe , and didnt get the favour back from anyone . 
  in my personal opinion , we should only pay back the money we owe to ex-yugo countries , when they show good faith and offer to pay the money they owe us aswell . 
  ________ currently its like this ( i 'm making these numbers/countries up ) croatia after the breakdown of yugoslavia owes 100 million $ to slovenia . 
  slovenia owes 150 million $ to croatia . 
  slovenia pays back the money , but croatia does not pay what it owes to slovenia . 
  in my opinion thats stupid , if we dont get what we are owed the country asking for us to pay them back when they dont want to pay us back is very unfair . 
  every economical betrayal , theft , or money related crime is done by slovenians . 
  slovenian politicians steal a lot from the slovenian people , but im not quite sure all slovenians are responsible for all theft , betrayal and money related crime ... 
  slovenia cant into europe ? 
  i just said i didnt see it in any national news , so i wasnt sure if the source has right information or not . 
  was asking not making a statement, 
  you sure the source is credible ? 
  i cant find anything on any slovenian news agency about it, 
  you got plenty , just google slovenian tourist caves . 
  most of them are seen in a slow 30-45minute walk , and are we 'll equipped for tourists . 
  and this extends beyong postojna cave . 
  as was said above \u0160kocjan caves are beautiful , but we have many other awesome caves aswell . 
  http://www.slovenia.info/?kraska_jama=0 but dont get stuck on just caves , our little country has a lot more beautifull stuff than just caves , 
  how do people from montenegro mastrubate ? 
  they put their dick into a hole in the ground , and wait for an earthquake, 
  please send help , we 're drowning in backwards thinking folks propagated by psychos and the church, 
  ** when did i say that russia would invade ? 
  ** they would n't , they 'll do what they did in ukraine and georgia . 
  ** they 'll conduct a ` silent invasion ' ** using `` rebels '' . 
  even if we step aside semantics here , any russian `` rebel '' group which is pure fantasy what youre proposing , but if it indeed would happen , it would still produce such a response from the eu that it would not benefit anyone , and as such that is why it will never happen . 
  i just find it extremely sad that even basics of international relations/politics are replaced with this kind of thinking that borderlines fearmongering and constant scare of some invasion or war from russia , its just so hilariously sad that people think thats an acual scenario that could happen in the near future . 
  man i feel like i 'm talking to a brick wall , we 're not at war , 1 side showing weakness wont mean an invasion from russia ... first of all please try to take into account any literature about international relations or just take a general look or overview of european law and not your own personal opinions in regards to millitary aggression on an eu member state . 
  any kind of agression on a european member state , would provoke such a harsh response may it be millitary or economic that russia would definitely not benefit in any shape or form from doing so . 
  it isnt in their interest to start a war , or worsen their position in regards to the european union . 
  as to why they annexed crimea , that is a geopolitical discussion we could engage in , but judging by our previous exchanges i 'm sadly inclined to belive a rational discussion wouldnt be possible . 
  can you not see the narrative of your own sentances ? 
  moving a couple bases from germany to poland would actually ** keep the peace ** . 
  a us/uk base would be a ** much stronger deterrent ** than a piece of paper . 
  are we at potential for an all out war with russia ? 
  is there fighting going on where more army bases would `` keep the peace '' and keep the peace from what ? 
  and why would we need strong deterents ? 
  is russia going to invade poland ? 
  are they going to attack an eu member ? 
  sigh , now i acually have to bother with a constructive reply , since the sarcasm wasnt understood . 
  in the cilivized world of the 21st century , nobody gains anything from `` posturing '' and wasting resources on such things . 
  the mentality of your reply is , that somehow we gain something by russia or whoever wasting their resources by stationing more troops . 
  when in reality nobody outside of the military acually benefits from this . 
  if there is a semi-troop war who has more troops on the borders , then it just means millions are being spent for no reason on posturing where they could be spent elsewhere where they would be off better use , and this goes from any country or a set of countries , we 're no longer at war where wasting somebodies resources is something we want/need to do . 
  this is n't some cod game . 
   who cares ? 
  good , let them waste their resources, 
  i guess we 're still in war , where wasting resources so our `` percieved enemies '' waste even more resources . 
  glad to see people still think straight these days , and realize we 're still at war !, 
  ah the anti-anti circlejerk , nothing has nuance in this world am i rite guys, 
  ah my german aint that good , thank you, 
  can i see your sources , i havent read any of this in the media ( yet ) ? 
  yes , lets just generalize everybody who i dont agree with into a group of dumb people incapable of rational thought or argumentation . 
  beef soup is a staple food in slovenia  as far as pet goats are concerned i really dont know , most farmers i know just have cows/pigs,

  milka is a traditional brand of chocolate confection which originated in switzerland in 1825 . 
  have you considered slovenia ? 
  you got mountains , sea , the kras wine region , the panonian plain , all in a 2 hour drive radious . 
  heck you can drive from one side of the country to the other in 3-4 hours, 
  hm i just re-checked the statistics and it appears that white americans make up 72.4 % of the population , the projections show that will be decreasing though . 
  i 'm not sure where you got your 90 % figure from , i mean america was 90 % white before they started transporting slaves from africa ? 
  i mean america is a bit of a special case , there have always been immigrants coming to america , from asia , from south and middle americas , from europe , from africa . 
  i know that in the case of immigrants from middle/south america they have restrictive border policies which gets rid of the immigration revolving door making the whole problem worse in the end , because immigrants can not return home due to the fear of not being able to return , there is a good paper on this subject by peter a. schulkin - phd in economics from harvard . 
  acually a doese n't keep growing ( if a is immigrant numbers ) , there were a few studies , i 'll try to find em tomorrow ( quite late here ) , that showed that the birth rate of immigrants coming from ( i think it was from the middle east ) droped from 2.5 to 2.1 in 3-5 years . 
  following that trend you stabilize with european birth rates after a bit less than 8 years . 
  i mean it makes sense that as your living standard goes up you have more acess to birth control and healthcare facilities you no longer need/want to have a lot of children . 
  the fact that higher regional devlopment and higher incomes lower birth rates has been discovered quite a while ago , but i guess it makes it even more interesting that its happening in such a short time with immigrants coming to europe , i figured it would be longer . 
  i 'm going to assume you 're just trolling to get a reaction out of people now . 
  but i 'll give you the benefit of the doubt , and give you some info . 
  with sources ( from the united nations ) : there are massive refugee camps in countries other than eu/turkey . 
  ----- if you want just 1 out of many examples of why your claim is wrong i 'll give you an easy one : in germany for example there are currently only around 400,000 syrian refugees , or 0.05 % of the population of germany . 
  so 1 out of 200 people in germany is a syrian refugee . 
  ** source : ** http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/kriegsfluechtlinge-aus-syrien-linke-und-gruene-warnen-vor-abschottung/11572642.html ----- ** jordan ** - one of the poorest countries in the world , currently already struggling with drought and famine as well as very poor economic conditions has at the moment : there are currently 4,289,994 syrian persons of concern accounted for . 
  there are about 1.4 million syrian refugees in jordan .
