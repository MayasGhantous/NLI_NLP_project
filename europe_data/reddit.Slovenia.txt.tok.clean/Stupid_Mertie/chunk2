  man , your flair . 
  its awesome !, 
  they do n't . 
  that 's why second generation of immigrants ( the kids of first immigrants ) are such problem . 
  man , that sounds stressful to the operators but very good investment form government side . 
  local power grid is always good to have strong, 
  i would say slovenia is for unified europe due to economical reasons mostly, 
  depends on the reigon of egypt . 
  the way i see it egypt is divided in three zones : safe for tourism , unsafe for livling ( the terrorist danger ) , nothing to see here . 
  the first type of locations will continue to be heavily or highly at least visited by tourists - like those pyramids and other stuff . 
  damn be but at first i 've read it like `` r/authism '' . 
  not trying to make any jokes but your argument stands firm from many different oppinions . 
  thanks for answer !, 
  slovenia is not on the map but * afaik * our number is about 15 . 
   i 'm not saying all muslims are bad , to the contrary , but there is a root cause of this and it must be dressed . 
  this . 
   the caucasian wives theory what is that ? 
  it 's a kind of sarcasm not everybody understands , 
  do n't forget the tinfoil hat !, 
  to the hungarians : do you feel safer ? 
  what would happen if we , normal citizens were allowed to carry weapons ? 
  more like hungary is the way i see it . 
  that 's a good link . 
  thanks !, 
  i 'm looking at world 2000 map and i see no isis , isil or any other is country . 
  while we 're traveling there do n't forget to drop your passport in the ocean . 
  you never know when you will need to not have it, 
  i am not sure it is publicly available . 
  state security agencies must have one . 
  if you find it tho , please share, 
  and yet europe has open borders and a million of lying people , half of whitch support extreme violence , has already crossed the border . 
  many millions still wait to come, 
  i think norway is too close , we should consider - canada or australia, 
  that 's a bad pun . 
  also i think the narrow street is vertical and shooting the video this way you see more of the street itself instead of buildings around it, 
  we need a big one over here, 
  that 's finally some good news . 
  ofcourse they were . 
  those illegal immigrants were destroying the fields by a large amount . 
  it happened the same in hungary before they closed borders, 
  creme de la creme ? 
  you mean the terorists screaming allah and killing innocent people . 
  i 'm not saying those economic migrants you call refugees are all terorists but a lot of them are, 
  you should stop inviting them then . 
  well , its a sign, 
  but ... but i got the first comment ... :( (, 
  kinda makes sense . 
  russians put a lot on their rituals . 
  combining with swedish spendings do i see a future economic downfall ? 
  i hope you return at some point in the future to get your own horseback riding experience , 
  making a kebab ** then ** removing it . 
  the real answer is in the details , 
  well , raw people vote count was on pair with ms clinton , the only difference really was in the number of countries won ... 
  the weather is nice tho , 
  its awesome , you can find out the weather report without opening the weather page ! \u00a8 we did it reddit !, 
  the bycicles are still in use tho, 
  eurovision , another thing i dont care about anymore, 
  there is a simple way to the volatility of hft : add a small tax to every time a share changes hands or attempts to do so, 
  parents too, 
  arent they denied already ? 
  or those that go underground and dont put in their asylum request, 
  not even an overstatement right here, 
  his flair, 
  dont forget to light the cyno, 
  yes , after the kids go to colleges in the cities and never return and old people can no longer work on the land . 
  and the forrest spreads and voila everything is now green, 
  i second this but on a different reason . 
  i think the news is just upfront made up ( the link is also from * slovenska tiskovna agencija * or * slovenian press agency * ), 
  what do you think of when you say * more important issues * ? 
  ( i am not up to date with everything happening ), 
  for those pretending to know can someone eli5 what is gulenist movement ? 
  it almost feels like there is nothing you could do about it . 
  is n't that what we would like to see ? ^ ( because nobody believes it is their true nature ), 
  rip, 
  heil merkel , but in spanish ? 
  [ usa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states ) [ usb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usb ) usc [ first ] ( http://www.usc.co.uk/ ) , [ second ] ( http://www.usc.edu/ ) , [ third ] ( http://www.usc.edu.au/ ) [ usd ] ( http://www.xe.com/currency/usd-us-dollar ) [ use ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4lgxk3/eu_as_one_nation/ ), 
  over the course of last ten years is it rising or falling ? 
  what is the trend now ? 
  ** was ** all about back in the days, 
  off ( to ignore it ), 
  by burning down our homes, 
  it never gets better, 
   but yes , its stupid yes , it 's * me * . 
  so it begins . 
  the migrants are already radicalising by excluding and torturing those who are different to them . 
  i dont want to be right but i expect this to hapen more often as time goes on . 
  i am surprised this got into papers . 
  ** e : now everybody downvotes me for not being * politically correct ***, 
  it 's ok euro governments will confirm it is a problem 2 years from now . 
  i upvoted for visibility but i disagree with it . 
  europe must preserve its soverenity and ban political movements for foreign countries . 
  it is up to diplomats of europe to deal with what they have and get and make out the best for our nations . 
  can we have a safe space where we can spam them all day ? 
  edit : found it : r/yurop, 
  the shitpost we deserve ^ ( ^ ninja ^ edit : ^ this ^ is ^ brides ^ wedding ^ dress ^ yes ? ), 
  we do ? 
  it is never too late to try . 
   we see big prospects in cooperation with belgium in particular they want the chocolate !, 
  will you update the chart with the new intel ? 
  that seems sufficient .
