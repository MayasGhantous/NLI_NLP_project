  my nearest castle is [ castle bled . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bled_castle ) it is a medieval castle located in the city of bled and was first mentioned in a 22 may 1004 deed of donation issued by emperor henry ii . 
  and what do queens want to be ? 
  it does look like an interesting ( and probably dangerous ) place . 
  but slovenia and bulgaria are more beautiful than croatia . 
  [ just look at this amazing bulgarian architecture !, 
  ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/22072985.jpg ), 
  thank you !, 
  thanks !, 
  does anyone know the name of the swiss and swedish paintings ? 
  i 've always just called it '' \u010ce\u0161ka '' . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  i forgot about andorra . 
  it 's probably alphabetical . 
  the channel is also reporting ( via the bar at the top ) that a citro\u00ebn is currently being chased by police near paris . 
  they think that four armed men are in it . 
  on this day 97 years ago the [ state of slovenes , croats and serbs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state_of_slovenes,_croats_and_serbs ) was created following the end of the first world war . 
  it later joined the kingdom of serbia on the 1st of december creating the kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenes which was later renamed into the kingdom of yugoslavia . 
  not really but thanks anyway . 
  as someone who speaks neither croatian nor serbian but is a native speaker of slovene i 've always wondered why some people consider them as seperate languages . 
  they honestly sound the same to me albeit with slight variations in their vocabulary and maybe some other small differences . 
  are they really that different ? 
  ( just curious , not trying to say you 're wrong ), 
  i really like the first one . 
  there 's also a call of duty : united offensive multiplayer map set in [ \u0160tanjel ] ( http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/stanjel ) . 
  we can go to italy without a passport thanks to the schengen area . 
  you 're welcome . 
  thanks . 
  how about [ alamut by vladimir bartol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alamut_ ( bartol_novel \\ ) ) ? 
  i have never read it myself but apparently it 's pretty good . 
  i do n't know how common it is in finland but the wikipedia article does mention that it has been translated into finnish . 
  does anyone know how to include that bracket in the link ? 
  but mostly alcohol . 
  yeah , they 're pretty great . 
  i 've spent at least one week every summer since i was born in istria ( sometimes even more than a month , mostly in the slovene part ) and the people there are definitely nicer than in jesenice . 
   since i moved to slovenia do you mind if i ask you where you lived before ? 
  from my experience the people of ljubljana tend to be nicer than the average slovenian ( at least when you compare them to the people in and around jesenice ) but i have n't met a lot of people from there so i ca n't really say much about that . 
  ljubljana is actually the city i would want to move to if i wanted to keep living in slovenia . 
  either that or koper ( for some reason i really like the primorska dialect ) . 
  for some reason lots of slovenes do n't like people from ljubljana . 
  i really do n't know why . 
  thanks for answering !, 
  hello stephen !, 
  what is your opinion on a federal europe ? 
  the second balkan war at the start of the 20th century . 
  serbia took it away from them . 
  some are unavailable . 
  slovenes take their mountains very seriously . 
  * 2864 close . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/eu-citizen/index_en.htm ) website you can cross the border with either an id card or a passport , driver 's licences are n't considered valid travel documents . 
  you also only need to show your id when going from slovenia to austria , there are n't any checks the other way arround . 
  i went to austria via korensko sedlo . 
  they might be checking ids at only certain border crossings but i 'm not sure . 
  really ? 
  i went to austria a few days ago and i had to show them my id . 
  / u/user _ history_bot @i - d-even-k -, 
  no , those were giants , not windmills . 
   if you 're so worried about accidents , you should n't go after guns . 
  you should go after cars . 
  more people die in car accidents every day than were killed in mass shootings during last ten years or so . 
  cars are one of the most basic forms of transport , something which is extremely important for the development of modern societies , while guns on the other hand are objects mainly built for injuring people . 
  you ca n't compare the two . 
  yes , it 's free and you can order it online ( at least in slovenia ) . 
  but i 'm not sure where it gets made , it 's probably different for every country . 
  and also , according to the slovene website you can also use your card in australia . 
  ( [ edit ] ( https://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/enablers/health-care-visitors-australia ) : apparently that 's only true for some countries ), 
  the people of hamburg are called hamburgers . 
  i do n't even remember if i 've ever seen an indian in my entire life . 
  i find it very hard to find non-white people here in northwestern slovenia . 
  i guessed 80 % . 
  the places in europe i 've been to never had many non-white people in them ( i ca n't even remember the last time i saw a black person . 
  probably a year ago . ), 
  so i assumed the us was about 15 % more diverse than those places . 
  it does feel like the majority of the coins i find here are either austrian or german ( even though i only found 1 german coin when i was writing the previous comment ) . 
  but that might be because i live right next to the austrian border near some touristy areas . 
  i found 14 austrian coins , 8 slovenian coins , 5 french coins and 1 german coin ( all of them are the copper ones , because i do n't have any higher value ones with me at the moment ) . 
  i thought you were talking about that entire poster thing . 
  actually , in the bottom right corner it says that the eu currently has 28 members . 
  the person who made this probably just used an outdated map . 
  they got control over bosnia after the congress of berlin in 1878 . 
  too bad it does n't have every european language . 
  oh , lol , for a second i actually thought you were joking but you never know . 
  even i occasionally click on slovak by mistake when choosing a language . 
  that really confused me when i was a kid and watching dubbed dvds . 
  and when i was checking the mobile wikipedia site it happened again ... 
  the mobile site is alright , but on pc there 's something wrong with the information on the right . 
  it 's just red error messages . 
  edit : and also , the one you linked is the slovak one . 
  i just visited his slovene wikipedia page and it 's terrible . 
  lots of broken links , broken grammar and there 's even some croatian mixed in at the start . 
  this is so interesting to read . 
  too bad i do n't know all of the terminology used here . 
  are you a linguist by any chance ? 
  research should be getting much more funds than it currently is . 
  it 's an investment into the future . 
  the american ambassador in ljubljana already said they are n't going to intervene . 
  and it 's located near a city called novo mesto which literally means `` new city '' . 
   i did nothi g wrong [ si prepri\u010dan ? 
  definitely .
