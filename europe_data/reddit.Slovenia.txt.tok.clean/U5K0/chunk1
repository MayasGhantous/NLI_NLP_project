just out of curiosity ; what was inflation like in italy pre-euro ? 
   enough money for cigarettes and 2 beers , whereas today those same things would cost 8 - 9 $ . 
  that may have more to do with tax ( tro\u0161arine ) increases than anything else . 
  is that before or after complaining about inflation being too low ? 
  that 's the sort of thing people here are capable of . 
  maybe it 's different in italy . 
  the fact that this has less than a million views is an embarrassment . 
  why do n't you tell the class what 's really bothering you ? 
  the title is misleading . 
  [ the real drop is about 20 % . 
  - paywall , sorry ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2l5hz2/europe_has_421_million_fewer_birds_than_30_years/clrq8by ), 
   anyways , have any of you noticed that people from outside europe are trying to be sooo politcally correct that they dont understand our ` healthy ' competition do n't mind the colonials . 
  they 've always been overly sensitive about things which do n't actually matter . 
  nothing new under the sun . 
  more than once . 
  tunisia is directly adjacent to europe . 
  [ nobody wants to live next to this guy ] ( http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs32/f/2008/205/a/7/ned_flanders_at_tuska_by_uppun.jpg ), 
  precisely . 
  covered when things happen . 
  council meetings , big directives , eu activities directly to do with us specifically . 
  coverage leans positive . 
  i thought the story is relevant * to * europe . 
  if this were my country , i 'd want to make triple sure that the money from this was handeled in the norwegian tradition and not the way it usually is here . 
  good point . 
  holy shit , why ? 
  it 's been forever since 2009 . 
  we charge for highway use as well . 
  other roads get funded with regular car taxes though . 
  what do these albanians think they are , hedge funds !? 
  people look for work where work is available . 
  once they earn their money it 's theirs to do with as they please . 
  that 's capitalism . 
  i do n't give a shit how other people feel about the way i spend my money . 
  if you do n't like it , sucks to be you . 
  regarding the polish section : http://www.thenews.pl/1/12/artykul/167325,rail-baltica-to-link-poland-with-baltic-states  although poland already uses standard gauge , it would still need to upgrade its railway line from warsaw to trakiszki on the lithuanian border so that trains can travel at high speed . 
  according to butkevicius , prime minister donald tusk has ` promised ' to carry out the upgrade , and the entire rail baltica line is due to be completed by 2024 . 
  so even if this section of line ( warsaw to trakiszki ) were not modernised , it could still be used by the same trains , but at a lower speed . 
   yes , but those requirements are sexist and arbitrary how is it sexist to push in the direction of more equal distribution of responsibility ? 
  i 'd say that traditional gender roles are arbitrary ( given that physical labour is no longer the dominant form of employment ) and that this is the exact opposite of these arbitrary roles . 
  this is a completely new idea to me . 
  i might just not be aware of it , but to the best of my knowledge , no such thing exists . 
  if you come to a place where there are n't any asian people , you might get some stares from children , but that 's just what kids do when they see something new ( does n't just apply to asian people ) . 
  the trend , however , is more clear . 
  one of us . 
  one of us ... 
   i am against creating a specific policy to keep men at home for `` parity sake '' . 
  well , i 'm in favour of this . 
  if the state is paying for these benefits , it 's perfectly legitimate for it to attach some requirements to them as well . 
  it makes sense to have both parents involved in childcare . 
  besides , this is just an optional positive incentive , not a compulsion or a penalty . 
  presumably , not everybody has kids at the same time . 
  also , remember that not paying for this stuff means that there will be a shortage of kids to pay for your pension in a few decades ( among other problematic effects ) . 
  it 's definitely a [ manifestation of policy . 
  ] ( http://www.english.rfi.fr/france/20110428-france-first-families )  france spends 3.8 per cent of gdp on family-friendly policies compared to 2.4 per cent by other oecd members . 
   take a look at the resource wealth . 
  take a look at all the available farm land , both current and projected . 
  none of this is new . 
  all of this is potential . 
  it 's not relevant unless it gets translated into reality . 
  this has n't happened so far and i do n't think the eau will change the non-existent current trend . 
  at what point do you have enough snowy wasteland ? 
  they kept things contiguous . 
  very smart . 
  also , we agree that smiling just to be polite indicates some form of mental impairment . 
  well , he did a lot of [ other good stuff .

  i misread that as otto von bismarck . 
  huh ? 
  croatia has a great coastline . 
   would you watch it yes, 
  good . 
  that wo n't solve italy 's domestic issues though, 
  oh , splitting hairs . 
  a redditor after my own heart . 
  1990 has been the benchmark since kyoto used it . 
  we 're on track to be at 80 % of 1990 by 2020 . 
  this means a transition to from 80 % to 60 % of 1990 within 10 years . 
  bottom line : i do n't know what you 're trying to say . 
  that 's just it : the growth in 2005 happened because of unsustainably borrowed money . 
  * those * were the unrealistic standards . 
  note : that 's what happened in slovenia . 
  i do n't actually know about spain .

  the peninsula which shall remain unmentioned . 
  that video has other cartoons as well . 
  also , the uk = / = an average british person i really hope people do n't think we 're the same as our government . 
  for one thing , i tied my shoelaces just this morning and so did most people in the country . 
  before the euro , people here used the deutsch mark for comparing prices of any large purchase , investment ... savings accounts were also in marks . 
  but since everyone was paid in tolars ( scary inflation figures ) you would have to pay a commission every time you made a deposit or a purchase ( you still had to buy stuff in tolars ) . 
  now , you get paid in a strong currency and you process all prices in that same currency . 
  also , no commission any more . 
  more broadly , we 're an export driven economy and the euro [ helps with that . 
  ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/explore/stacked/hs/export/svn/show/all/1995.2012/ ) since the pound is a strong currency already , you 're essentially left with the trade benefits . 
  not really that prominent for the man on the street . 
  you can classify us as siberia so long the b word does n't come up . 
  the ecb needs some keynesian options , not just monetarist ones .
