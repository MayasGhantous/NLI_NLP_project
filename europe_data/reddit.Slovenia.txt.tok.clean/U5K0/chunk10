  the thing is , if you want nato to work when it 's needed , you have to operate together on a regular basis to iron out the kinks as they emerge . 
  it would probably make more sense to have nato bases across alience territory to facilitate that , not just us bases in europe . 
  that , however , would take money and political will . 
  poland , is that you ? 
  [ i have to put this here . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj920cn2hma ), 
  holy crap , i 'm starting to develop a man-crush for this guy . 
  when it comes to a decision of this magnitude it does n't matter how many people vote against , but how many vote in favour . 
  if you ca n't convince half of the electorate to show support , there 's clearly a problem . 
  personally , i would n't be comfortable with a close result either , but half the electorate seems like a minimum standard for this sort of thing . 
  you 're putting a new country on the map , not renaming a bridge . 
  i think you might be in the wrong thread . 
  the most important part imho :  austerity has led to a dramatic fall in public and private investment everywhere in the eurozone . 
  germany needs to invest just as italy does -- in infrastructure , education , energy networks , and research and development . 
   with interest rates close to zero , such a programme would be essentially self-financing . 
  it could also help raise potential growth if the investments were to lead to an increase in productive capacity . 
  it could be funded through five or 10-year bonds issued by the european investment bank . 
  the european central bank could then buy most of these bonds as part of a future programme of asset purchases , which i expect to happen later this year . 
  the point of the eu was to stop a war between france and germany and , by extension , other member states . 
  a thing which was a regular occurrence for about 1500 years previously . 
  it is n't magic . 
  it 's members pursuing interests and working out conflicts in a civilised organised way . 
  the yugoslav republics were not part of this framework and thus ended up working out their disagreements in the traditional european manner . 
  perhaps off topic , but i do n't really think it 's accurate to call the united left eurosceptic . 
  they have different ideas on how to run things , but i have n't seen any proposals from them in the direction of dismantling eu integration . 
  personally i think they make a few good points . 
  shame that they then launch into a war on reality and operate on the assumption that social justice trumps maths . 
  there was no stopping those short of a complete occupation of bosnia as well as large parts of croatia and serbia , which would have been forcefully and furiously resisted at the time . 
  on the other hand , had the eu not been there after the wars ended , the region would have simply transitioned into a mid-east style perpetual powder keg . 
  it 's provided constant adult supervision to the local elites and thank goodness for that . 
  this has nothing to do with representatives . 
  they sit in parliament . 
  we 're talking about the foreign minister . 
  why ? 
  more like mixing bullshit and horse shit . 
  they would be useless diplomats, 
  it 's not quite as bad as the * fuck the eu * tape in my opinion . 
  he was essentially criticising poland for being too subordinate . 
  also , that massive chunk of the british media owned by murdoch . 
  they 've delivered cargo to iss and returned cargo from there at a cost that nobody else can match and they have working tech in the pipeline that will drop that price further, 
  and it would have economic benefits . 
  you could merge your energy and metal production or something ...

  i think these were originally 2 pages, 
  this is for the past year or so, 
  op just messed up i could always say that switzerland is neutral regarding which continent they 're part of . 
  isaf troops count as un peacekeepers so you get points for those .

  flair up !, 
  but would n't that be reflected in [ a higher inflation forecast ?

  edit : [ nice curves ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4036/4578541974_599a1ac316.jpg ), 
   the eu keeps its people from taking part in the larger world , limits these nations to having influence in just europe . 
  what ? 
  how ? 
  what ? 
  tell them to bring beer . 
  i do n't get it . 
  it shows the nominal gdp per capita gap as expanding and our inflation as lower for the projected period yet somehow the ppp per capita gap closes . 
  can someone explain this ? 
  suck it czechia !, 
  if you leave the eu , you will reverse globalisation . 
  also , you can prevent rain by leaving your umbrella at home . 
  http://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2014/06/19/kosovo-serbs-remove-barrier-in-divided-town-erect-new-one/ could n't they compromise and rearrange the pots so as to allow pedestrian and bicycle traffic ? 
  seems like a terrible waste of a perfectly good bridge . 
  are n't you building your own now ? 
  i remember hearing something about that and then noting for a long time now . 
  people are afraid of the f-word for some reason , but nobody seems to care when the federal structures take trade measures against chinese dumping practices or negotiate with the us , korea , japan , india etc. 
  no one complains when there 's a federal ban on roaming charges or endocrine disrupting chemicals . 
  copernicus and galileo are done on a federal level and that 's ok . erasmus + has n't been criticised very much as far as i know . 
  the framework programmes are quite positively received , as are the flagship initiatives . 
  federal does n't mean usa for europe . 
  you do things federally where there 's significant added value to be had compared to doing it nationally or sub-nationally . 
  sadly , politics mess things up a bit , but nobody 's perfect . 
  the employment numbers are compared to the same time last year , so my pasta loving neighbour should use * / s *, 
  if you 're talking to another european , it 's a meaningless thing to say . 
  otherwise , yes . 
  compared to the alternative of digging an even deeper hole ? 
  d\u00fcde !, 
  jobbik is far-right !, 
  membership has its privileges . 
  we all live on a rainbow submarine . . 
  apparently i speak black . 
  the taliban have a culture too , as does the post-soviet kleptocracy . 
  that does n't mean they deserve respect or preservation . 
  expletives , and the emotional fog behind them , do n't make your assertions into arguments . 
  it 's an investment in domestic stability and the maintenance of economically viable levels of demand the healthcare aspect specifically has benefits for general public health - something that immigrant-born infectious diseases are a detriment to . 
  return to sender . 
  if you mean the unemployed of a different fucking continent , then yes . 
  i did n't say we did a great thing .
