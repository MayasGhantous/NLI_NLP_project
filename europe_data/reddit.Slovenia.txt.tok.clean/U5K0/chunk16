  fta is a very vague term . 
  it does n't seem appropriate to get money out of the system if you have n't paid into it - for adults , obviously . 
  food coupons , urgent medical care and shelters being a basic humanitarian exception . 
  food coupons , urgent medical care and shelters are one thing , but if there 's money included in the * package with no conditions * , it 's just abuse waiting to happen . 
  wait , all you have to do to get welfare from germany is show up ? 
  that 's insane !, 
  edit : the way it was written i thought they wanted to deport people after the 3 months - derp, 
  so , what happens in month 4 ? 
  edit : what if you go to germany during your gap year , 3 months tops ? 
  this seems strange . 
  takes one to know one . 
  perspective : they spent 8bn dollars on cca 50 km of railway . 
  the cannel tunnel is about that long and it cost 12 bn adjusted for inflation . 
  not sure what that means but it seemed like a natural comparison to make . 
  i completely lost it when i read this . 
  fyi , i 'm in a library . 
  thankfully this part is mostly empty at the moment . 
  well , that 's helpful and justified . 
  it 's a figure of speech and tomorrow is thursday . 
  the us used to do this and they 're a nato member too . 
  dear god !,

  it should be emphasised that the energy dependency map shows how dependent countries are on energy imports overall , not from russia in particular . 
  they thought that the miserable communist system would collapse in a matter of weeks . 
  that 's what happens when your entire war effort is being run by one crazy guy who can never be questioned . 
  * principle also applies in the event of one stupid guy, 
  einstein should stick to physics . 
   the ixv , a vehicle classed as a `` lifting body '' ... `` it has the simplicity of a capsule , because we do not have wings , but the performance is very close to winged vehicles . '', 
  this answers my [ previous comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/21135k/europes_answer_to_the_space_shuttle_is_almost/cg8ygt6 ) on the project . 
  thank you for the link . 
  relevant : [ striesand effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streisand_effect ), 
  what 's the point of this ? 
  just use a capsule like normal people . 
  russia uses a capsule , spacex uses a capsule , china uses a capsule , the us is going back to a capsule . 
  spacecraft are n't airliners . 
  they do n't have to land at airports . 
  offside !, 
  countries which have already tried to drive you into the sea , not to mention stockpiles of short and medium range missiles held by non-state actors just across your border, 
  it is n't paranoia is you 're actually surrounded by ... well you know the rest, 
  * again, 
  ca n't we change that rule ? 
  i mean who would object , really ? 
  could n't you just make the forms available only in spanish and impossible to fill out ? 
  maybe a fence ca n't stop them , but bureaucracy has no structural limitations . 
  i see . 
  thanks . 
  there might be a compromise here ; they join russia , you do n't . 
  from what i understand , these sort of big legislative packages tend to be agreed in advance informally - not sure if this is the case here or not . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i 'm fairly clinical about this . 
  if the state wants to waste my time , it should offer me enough money so that i do it willingly . 
  otherwise they can fuck off like any popup internet survey . 
  edit : thank you nato for making us switch to a professional army, 
  the document form 5 years ago was simply an agreement among device manufacturers , not legislation . 
  this builds on it . 
  it turns out that coordinating an entire sector of industry takes some time , but thanks for the constructive comment . 
  the commission [ started the game ] ( http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-10274953-94.html ) 5 years ago . 
  there 's just no love for faceless bureaucrats , no matter how hard they try :*(, 
  well , i hated the first one for the same reason , but this time i knew i was going to see a totally idiotic film - it delivered on my expectations . 
  there 's nothing quite like a huge totalitarian threat from the east to unite the different gree ... ugh ... 
  i mean european states, 
  why does this guy still get press ? 
  he 's been talking about the imminent collapse of the euro for years now . 
  just because he has a lot of money does n't make him an expert on everything . 
  on this topic , it may as well be donald trump talking, 
  if you 're already pornographically poor , you may as well make some money off it, 
  read the lead to the end ... government mismanagement of resources , or weak , ineffectual , unstable or corrupt institutions i hope this does n't happen , but it should be on people 's radar . 
  life expectancy, 
  it seems that decadence [ is good for you ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:esperanza_de_vida.png ), 
   ... will be the backbone of the greek recovery [ be careful what you wish for ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/resource_curse ), 
  with each passing week , putin looks more and more like milo\u0161evi\u0107 to me . 
  i know it is n't necessarily a justified comparison , but the human brain is evolved to recognise patterns , and the paralels here are just too numerous to ignore . 
  an important thing to mention here is that the current power structure is responsible for its actions , not the country or most of the people who live in it . 
  maybe off topic , but i 'm still unclear as to why jahukovich hightailed it when he did, 
  it was the epicenter of human knowledge at a time when progress happened faster than ever before . 
  the first time it was surpassed was after the birth of modern empirical science - millennia later as a devout nerd , this is my mecca, 
  great name btw, 
  the scottish referendum is the result of an agreement between the scottish and british governments ... plus no russian troops , etc. 
  i think the key to breaking russian dominance of the eu gas market lies in connecting the caspian sea conventional fields with the market here . 
  there 's also some potential in the eastern mediterranean if outstanding political issues can be resolved . 
  given the settlement geography in europe , share , e gas is unlikely to provide a large part of the solution to this . 
  i think it should be called generalplan zapad, 
  could n't the russians have done that ? 
  would 've been good for everyone involved ... except iran , obviously . 
  the eu funds esa more than any single member state . 
  [ see here ] ( http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2013/01/esa_budget_2013/12496038-4-eng-gb/esa_budget_2013.jpg ), 
  you must be very upset about voting age requirements then, 
  or poland , or any of the newer members come to think of it . 
  that holds for evolution and global warming as well . 
  a paedophile filtering the internet . 
  what 's next , thieves running the financial system ? 
  there 's always * the pund * still hoping , 
  also , given the season and the starting point , leningrad may be an easier target this time round . 
  i fairness there really should be a ruska krajina on the adriatic . 
  yes , they 're annexing garry kasparov . 
  next , we 'll be taking alexei navalny . 
  how dare you !, 
   unite with other nationalists around europe i 'm all for european unification , but this seems weird to me .
