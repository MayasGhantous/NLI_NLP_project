  this would be the thread to do it in, 
  in europe , the number is 66 % in case you missed it . 
  can someone tell me why we have the battle-groups if we 're not even going to use them in these sort of cases ? 
  better to do an ad hoc thing , really ? 
  in other news : 30 % of europeans ca n't use the internet for various reasons, 
  i 'll get that to you by the end of the day  would you like ppp or nominal per capita, 
  made the nominal as well, 
  [ nominal gdp by popular demand . 
  [ kofetarica ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/ivana_kobilca_-_kofetarica.jpg ) ( the coffee woman ), 
  i prefer ppp because it tries to tell you how much people can afford to buy , what their standard of living is . 
  1000 $ in slovenia or 1000 $ in belgium are not the same thing, 
  irrelevant . 
  statements stand or fall on their own merits . 
  are you really willing to dismiss thoughtfull engagement simply based on national origin ? 
  that would just be silly, 
  everything in the sky flies , but there 's a big difference between a seagull and b2 stealth bomber, 
  but cyprus is n't geographically in europe at all ... so , what gives ? 
  the germans are being clever as always . 
  their statement proves itself ... seriously , made me laugh, 
  thank god ... 
  i was worried there for a bit, 
  fair enough , i guess certainly more sensible than the other two, 
  wait , really ? 
  do you ever vote for a pm ? 
  nice effort .

  i know , but as i understand it , they have to at this point , do n't they ? 
  so you did n't catch that this was actually just a copy edit of your own comment from earlier how sad - it 's not even sporting anymore, 
  you completely missed the point , but that 's what i 'd expect from a self-righteous lunatic, 
  we liked the illyrian provinces . 
  no offence to austria , but you were a bit overbearing at the time . 
  ok , now you 're just rambling incoherently . 
  ah , i remember the good old days when being seen anywhere [ near slovenia on a list was a national insult . 
  ] ( http://www.mojvideo.com/video-prizor-nasa-mala-klinike-iz-filma-sicko/0ec50d3f2e3143a558e4 ), 
  oh , i was n't aware of this . 
  thanks for the info . 
  how sad for you, 
  you break a contract , it renders the contract void . 
  what 's with the drama ? 
  [ perspective ] ( http://thegreatgeekmanual.com/images/humor/motivational/october/motivational-poster-perspective-fuck-rules.jpg ), 
  if one side is in a position to negotiate a better deal , that makes even more economic sense . 
  then movement of capital , goods and services is in the same category and can be restricted unilaterally as well again , if you want to talk in terms of westphalian sovereignty , then everything is internal , but at that point , you ca n't complain if people embargo you , since it 's their sovereign right to do so rules are either followed and enforced or they 're meaningless and should just be removed completely so everyone can be free to do whatever they feel like at any time as long as you get 50 % +1 vote , it 's all magically al right , even if you change your mind a year down the line , but then the right thing has changed again , since that 's what the polls say . 
  then why should the eu not apply the same principle and impose quotas on how much business swiss based companies can do in the eu ? 
  ( and this is n't it btw , just a suspension of talks on further agreements for the time being , which is the least any sane person would do given the development ), 
  if freedom of movement is an internal state issue , what is n't ? 
  or is freedom of movement for people an internal issue , but freedom of movement for capital , goods and services , and electricity is somehow different ? 
  how ? 
  hey , if switzerland can throw its treaty obligations out the window , so can the eu ... how is this anything other than common sense ? 
  or you renegotiate it as opposed to taking a fountain pen to it [ and going all * darth vader * on it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpe_xmricle ), 
  interestingly , [ it was the emptier parts of switzerland that said it . 
   `` the council expresses its conviction that this agreement does not constitute the final goal in eu-ukraine co-operation . '', 
  ... `` the words mean what they say , '' ashton told press . 
  this is rapidly aproaching game of thrones language . 
  i saw this on polandball yesterday and did n't know what to make of it . 
  what has my life come to when i 'm getting my news from polandball !, 
  can people please stop using the definite article in front of esa ? 
  ( now i know how ukrainians must feel ), 
   the statement was figurative and gives the message they wanted to send just fine no , it does n't . 
  a country and a house are two fundementally different things even inregards to the issue in question . 
  it 's a bad figurative statement . 
  sounds like an international agreement, 
  a country is n't a house - you do n't lock the borders at night or turn off the power grid when you leave god , populism is dumb, 
  it is n't how much money they 're investing , it 's how large a share, 
  there 's no such thing as illegal capital , only undocumented capital, 
  does anyone know what the process of invoking the guillotine clause would look like ? 
  does it involve a consensus vote in the council or a qualified majority or is it jut a commission prerogative ? 
  the commission has to get up on its hind legs on this one . 
  i mean they stood up to china , and they had merkel 's support at the time . 
  the word you were looking for is * insane . 
  the commission 's job is to safeguard the treaties . 
  this is a clear violation of treaty commitments . 
  if it does n't respond harshly here , then where ? 
   you ought to be able to improve treaties over time without the spectre of `` you 're gon na kill the entire eu '' hanging over your head . 
  true , but now is really the worst possible time for this . 
  with anti-eu parties on the rise and a possible brexit on the horizon , the above mentioned spectre is very real, 
  it takes two to start anew , maybe the other side does n't see a point in building a new framework which will simply be torn up at a random time in the future, 
  it 's also not required that a new agreement be negotiated after all , why bother if the other guy is just going to tear it up at his earliest convenience ? 
  because switzerland made certain commitments as part of a negotiated agreement and is now unilaterally changing that agreement into something that it finds more comfortable . 
  you ca n't do that !, 
  that would be the pragmatic thing to do , but there is a principle at stake here regarding '' * pick and choose * '' , which the commission is likely to defend with quite a hard line ... especially since , and please forgive the expression , switzerland makes for a convenient sacrificial lamb, 
  it 's clearly a decision for the swiss electorate , but i can still hold the opinion that they made a stupid decision - seeing as they did . 
  it 's one thing to negotiate a special set of terms for yourself while a treaty is being constructed . 
  it 's something quite different to sign a treaty , ratify it and then unilaterally back out of one provision which you do n't like because you do n't like it . 
  not if the eu axes schengen with switzerland, 
  open primaries - good closed primaries - tea party edit : come to think of it , open primaries are just a different way of having a two round election .

  this sort of comment is why i love reddit . 
  people like you make the internet not suck . 
  no need . 
  if we just pull a * putin * and close the borders for safety reasons they 'll be all `` sorry guys , did n't mean it '' really fast . 
  that 's not really a useful definition for calculating population density , but thank you for the effort , 
  how do you define * unhabitable mountain regions * and how do you delineate the north ?
