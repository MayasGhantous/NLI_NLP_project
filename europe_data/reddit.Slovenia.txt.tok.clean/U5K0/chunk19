  i 'd like to see some actual numbers on this , rather than a simple assertion . 
  switzerland is nowhere near the most densely populated area in the world , which means there is a proven way of making things work , right ? 
  just checked and it is n't april yet in case anyone else was wondering . 
  i 'm just thinking out loud here , but could n't you just ad a carriage to trains that are overcrowded , a lane to roads here and there , and i do n't even know what overcrowded cities means , anyone ? 
  i 've been watching to fucking much american tv, 
  if that 's the case , then i 'm with the yanks . 
  i did n't get that impression though . 
   maybe you and i disagree over what exactly was meant when that official said `` fuck the eu '' . 
  yes , and your description of my view is spot on . 
   i do n't know . 
  but they should be doing something . 
  see , that 's where we drift apart . 
  i do n't think we should be doing something just so we 're doing something , especially when that something may well have unpredictable consequences . 
   they should make it look like they have some sort of plan ... 
  i think that there should actually be a plan , but it 's unclear to me what that could be at this point . 
  we 're clearly not willing to commit the money that would be necessary to swing the ukrainian economy 180 \u00b0 to the west and the infrastructure is not in place to displace russian gas supplies at this point . 
  on top of that , there 's a large portion of the population which still supports the eastward policy vector and the entire country is in dire need of reforms , which will be economically painful for ordinary people no matter what . 
  unless the ecb is about to start printing money for ukraine , i do n't really see an endgame here . 
  any pretence in the absence of the real thing would be torn down by the kremlin in short order . 
  i did n't say that this was a position of the us , but i object to this position since it was the one expressed as far as i can see while the point about squabbling etc. 
  may be valid in some general sense , it really does n't apply here in my opinion . 
  the situation is difficult and fraught with peril . 
  there is no simple multiple choice style set of options that we could choose from . 
  while i 'm aware of the existence of sins of omission , i think that treading lightly is the wise thing to do here . 
  what exactly is it that the eu should be doing in your opinion ? 
   the eu needs them ** as much ** as they need the eu . 
  i mainly agree with your point , but there is certainly a massive asymmetry there . 
  sry , misclicked and subsequently edited, 
  were you thinking of something specific or did you just want to drop off a flaming bag of passive aggressiveness devoid of any substantive value ? 
  the thought of the eu being sidelined by the us of all `` people '', 
  to be fair , the russian hand is a hell of a lot stronger to begin with ; they control the majority of ukraine 's gas , are as big an export market for ukrainian gods as the eu , and have control over big chunks of the value chain of ukrainian industry , which landed on the russian side of the border in '91 the fact that they also have massive amounts of cash on hand also helps . 
  the word does n't bother me , the thought , however , does . 
  [ video here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msxaa-67ygm ) the f * line at 3:00 min edit : by popular demand : fuckady fuck fuck fuck, 
  austria , why am i not surprised ? 
  rigging elections is a disgusting thing to do , but at least i can understand why people would choose to do it ... so what was this , force of habit ? 
  he 's done a very good job of making sure there are n't any perhaps a few slipped through the cracks , but if he does n't know about them , neither do we, 
  so is \u0161ajze ... here anyway, 
  french guyana is best guyana . 
  i think that the low temperatures combined with the long time it would take for the car to thaw out would likely empty out the battery ... useless was the wrong word to use, 
  yes , on the lines and the towers themselves, 
  the battery would almost certainly be useless at that point and the radiator could be busted if you did n't have enough antifreeze in there ( though probaby not at the temperatures we have here in this case ; -2 , -3 ) ... not sure about the other stuff, 
  there 's that great nordic cheer and optimism we 've all grown to know and love !, 
  it 's all fun and games until you lose your power , water ( because of the pumps ) and heating edit : [ that was n't pessimism on my part , but the reality for many people here ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/03/us-slovenia-weather-idusbrea120wx20140203 ), 
  there 's a reason for that distance . 
  mother nature is an abusive parent . 
  by abusive , i , of course , mean psychotic and serially homicidal . 
  also , preliminary numbers show that almost an entire yearly forest yield may be damaged and will only be appropriate for fuel and other low value uses . 
  [ i like this spanish to english adaptation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhdjyywoeau ), 
  yes , that 's about right . 
  we just got our power back a few hours ago . 
  i hope it lasts this time . 
  the thing is , they fix the problem fairly quickly , but then another tree falls on a line somewhere due to the ice buildup on the branches . 
  btw : ** thank you to germany and austria for lending us some generators ** ... it 's really tough in some areas , where the damage will take days to fix and people need the electricity for their central heating systems . 
  it does n't take a lot of power , but the little that you need , you really do need badly . 
  ** also thank you to the czech republic **, 
  this sort of comment is exactly why many people develop a negative bias toward those who dislike the eu . 
  there are legitimate arguments to be made against the eu , but the above comment is barely a single step above growling . 
  took this 15 min away from my house [ pic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:upper_kamnik_valley_and_alps.jpg ) about 30 min in the opposite direction https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:velika_planina_ ( 8965484358 ) . jpg the bovec area [ from above ] ( http://www.boka-bovec.si/data/upload/mountains_bovec.jpg ) , [ from below ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/1920x1280/36985368.jpg ) ljubljana castle and surrounding area : [ pic ] ( http://events.prace-ri.eu/conferencedisplay.py/getpic?picid=1&amp;confid=156 ), 
  so this is our policy now - send putin to his kremlin without desert ? 
  also , no internet !, 
  ugh ... actually , he may be ahead of us on that one . 
  those poor racists . 
  they must be really confused right now . 
  i 've always liked byzantium better than the orther two . 
  my bet is on montenegro . 
  i think serbia has been doing great so far , but montenegro has too much of a head start . 
  maybe they 'll join together ? 
  the phrase they like to use in these sort of cases is - * european values in all their glory * google it, 
  this guy also messed up https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d39fbrxbm8k, 
  i believe you meant to say schweinhund - i make that mistake myself on occasion . 
  i think it might be that boots are shaped like italy . 
  nice branding !, 
  just do n't call them polish prisons ; they 're really touchy about adjectives for some reason, 
   the us would blacklist companies who deal with iran or cuba or whatever , the same way russia has the right to stop doing business with another country . 
  the cuba embargo is just as reprehensible as the ukraine sanctions . 
  add to that the fact that the russian action was a clear violation of wto rules and that it has been effective and you can understand why it has a extra element of tragedy to it . 
  there are legitimate reasons to use economic pressure . 
  cynical foreign policy interests are not among them .

  is there really no better way to use public money and institutional capacity ? 
  could you post the results here as well , please ? 
  the domestically fracked gas does n't need to be imported, 
  my main problem with it is that the fuel needs to be imported . 
  btw , i think that coal is waaaaaay worse . 
  i 've sent them a note and they 've already said `` s\u00f3rry . '', 
  true , but that does n't automatically make these findings false . 
  well , you could always increase the price of carbon to maintain current gas prices and use the collected money to finance ... well anything from debt reduction to renewables to climate resilience to r & d. . . . 
  can someone who knows this stuff please explain why fracking and renewables are incompatible ? 
  i mean , could n't you just use the gas to replace coal and nuclear while still growing renewables ? 
  the fact that prices fluctuate constantly does n't change the fact that the average price of a mwh in 2013 was less than in 2012 ... 13 % less, 
  if this is such a big deal , why not divert the welfare tax of recent movers into a common fund for a year and finance their benefits from it . 
  of course it may be a bit aukward when the fund begins to turn a profit, 
  as a practical point , how effective is prohibition anyway ? 
  it makes people feel better to make drugs illegal ( except the ones they happen to be using ) , but does it actually solve more problems than it creates in terms of public health ? 
  high flying moral principles do n't really work well in public health . 
  needle exchange programmes are a no-brainer health wise , but morally ... well , you get the picture . 
  making drugs illegal inevitably creates quality problems leading to complications ( which cost healthcare money ) , it finances organised crime leading to violence ( which costs healthcare and law enforcement money ) , it creates further stigma around addiction leading to less early treatment seekers ( costing healthcare money ) , it increases drug prices and creates uncertainty in the supply chain leading to additional stress for addicts who then use more as a result ( costing healthcare money ) , and it leads to theft and other anti social behaviour to finance almost impossible to resolve addictions ( costing law enforcement money and general social problems ) ... it 's better to educate people about the dangers of drugs accurately so that less of them get addicted and help those who do as opposed to punishing them it may not feel good , but it produces better results, 
  that 's a sincere question , we barely remember what it looks like anymore :*(, 
  i\u0165s a variation on franz, 
  i have to say that the one with the vitruvian man is my personal favourite along side the primo\u017e trubar and france pre\u0161ern ones ...
