  ... with croatia gaining fast . . 
  ah , the good old days ... 
  i laughed my ass off . 
  some people just do n't like balkan style jokes . 
  so sensitive . 
  i 'm just thankful that in europe * urban * actually means urban unlike some places ... 
  czechia , explain please, 
  the case here is that the banks were state owned , but tycoon ( and friend ) operated . 
  they were able to get away with a lot of dirty business while credit was cheap and easy , but once the credit dried up , the banks were n't able to cover up the sweet heart deals any more , so * they * stopped as well . 
  this was , quite surprisingly , followed by investigations , prosecutions and , amazingly , convictions . 
  [ perhaps the public anger made a difference . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%e2%80%9313_maribor_protests ), 
  i specifically said that this has been the case here . 
  that 's because their business model was based on being able to borrow . 
  the moment the credit lines dried up for a few months their financial structures imploded since it was n't based on actually creating value at a competitive price . 
  its essentially survival of the fittest - and the tycoons are by far the least fit part of the economy , but as long as the government , which is often influenced by these people , can manipulate the market , the currency and continuously bail out their friends , they just keep drowning out the competitive parts of the economy, 
  i ca n't really speak to the situation in italy , but as far as slovenia is concerned , the euro is pretty much the only thing that could ever dislodge the transition era tycoons . 
  if we still had the tolar , the government would have simply inflated and swept the causes of the problem under the carpet . 
  what actually happened was a large scale collapse of the entrenched moguls , many of whom are now in prison for white collar crime . 
  their places on the richest lists have been taken over by family owned businesses and inovation/export driven companies . 
  things desperately needed to be restructured , better to do it sooner . 
  that 's a bit antisemitic , is n't it ? 
  the eib idea was n't my main point . 
  i want the ecb to live up to the target of 2 % inflation which would itself help the periphery . 
  the current levels of inflation place an undue burden on the more heavily indebted sovereigns . 
  how you do that is less important to me . 
  you could just have the ecb pay out dividends according to the capital deposited by its shareholders or something , but again , how it 's done is besides the point !, 
  i did n't say i wanted to transfer money to the south . 
  i thought that the eib is one of the ways the money could be spent in a common cause , but it 's in no way the main point . 
  the point is to live up to the 2 % target , which would itself help the periphery since the current inflation level is an undue burden on the more heavily indebted sovereigns . 
  you could just have the ecb pay out dividends according to the capital investments of its shareholders , or something like that , but again , how they do it is besides the point as long as its not against the rules . 
  also : yes . 
  yes , and if you want them to be changed , * you * should make the case for it . 
  yes , it is . 
  i 'm saying simply that they should deliver the 2 % . 
  how they do it is of secondary importance to me personally , i just suggested a possibility . 
  as for bending the rules : you 're either inside the rules or you are n't . 
  the existence of bending is a matter of opinion . 
  [ the ecb 's own rules say inflation should be just below ** 2 % ** ] ( http://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/strategy/pricestab/html/index.en.html ) they need to follow all the rules , not just the ones that are popular in berlin at the moment . 
  private investors are not god . 
  just because there 's a better opportunity to make money somewhere else in the world does n't mean investing in rail electrification , pipeline and electricity transmission interlinks , gas storage , renewables capacity , energy efficiency , irrigation , water tratment etc would be unsound in the periphery . 
  private investors go to where the return is greatest , quickest and easiest . 
  there 's plenty of room for sensible public investment ... and since there 's also a need to expand the money supply , it seems like a marriage made in ... a maths textbook . 
  [ it is not against the rules . 
  ] ( http://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/strategy/pricestab/html/index.en.html )  while the treaty clearly establishes the primary objective of the ecb , it does not give a precise definition of what is meant by price stability . 
   the ecb 's governing council has announced a quantitative definition of price stability : `` price stability is defined as a year-on-year increase in the harmonised index of consumer prices ( hicp ) for the euro area of below 2 % . '', 
  also , lending to the eib or one of the stability mechanisms for example would not be intervening on behalf of individual countries . 
  you would n't have to lend to sovereigns with a history of questionable spending patterns . 
  you can lend to the [ eib ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_investment_bank ) and maybe even attach extra conditions on how it gets used . 
  ok , but as i understand it , the ecb defines price stability as inflation of just below 2 % . 
  remind me again why they are n't printing and lending to say the eib ? 
  i 'm sure they could make good use of it .

  if you want to criticise the euro , go ahead , but this sort of drive by commenting is why euroscheptics are percieved as thoughtless ideologues . 
  that does n't help anyone . 
  i understand that the deutsch mark had the function for the gauss curve on one of the notes ... 
  i really want that on my money in case it 's not obvious , i 'm a total nerd , and proud of it, 
  i think that that 's a really good idea . 
  keep the people and structures on the national sides of the coins and have concepts - our common heritage on the notes . 
  when you say * beat * ... 
  in slovenia everyone , including politicians , seems to treat it as just an additional venue for appeal . 
  when they like the rulings they rub it in everyone 's face , when they do n't like the rulings , they criticise them . 
  i have n't actually seen anyone question the legitimacy of the court though . 
  it may have to do with that fact that our court system , while improving , still leaves much to be desired , and therefore it 's good to have a truly independent venue for appeal . 
  i understand tourists paying for it in some way , but do n't migrants already pay `` an nhs tax '' from their wage like anyone else ?

  will moscow be sending 10 billion $ to ukraine every year from now on ? 
  i think they may have bitten off more than they can chew . 
  if russia ever loses its grip on ukraine , transnistria becomes a very difficult proposition to maintain . 
  what could they do , start an airlift ?
