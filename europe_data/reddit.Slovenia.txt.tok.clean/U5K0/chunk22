  i ca n't say things have n't changed for the better in some areas , but there 's a long way to go yet . 
  ah yes the energiewende ... so that 's why we run on ethanol, 
  but would n't croatia have a veto in this case ? 
  i do n't think that the eu has any competence in terms of marriage . 
  it certainly is n't in the echr , so the most i can imagine the eu doing here is demanding recognition of same-sex marriages from other member states .

  the eu delivered on its promises of open borders , new markets , higher environmental standards ... 
  the downside of joining the euro was a brief jump in prices , and a downside of the eu is that politicians had a go-to scapegoat when something was n't popular - that does n't work so well any more , but it did for a while . 
  also , eu structural funds should have more stringent standards for dissemination . 
  slovenia is a recipient nation for the time being , but it 's still public money and should be used well . 
  most of it is , but every now and then some of it gets used on a really stupid project , like an educational path through a protected habitat . 
  not the highest cost project , but still ... does anyone actually use those ? 
  i wish the country had developed an economic strategy before joining . 
  still has n't btw . 
  hopefully this crisis will force the government to get its act together on that front .

  the german trade surplus with the rest of the eurozone has actually decreased substantially over the last several years . 
  it 's also decreased with the non-euro 10 . the reason that the overall surplus is up is the fact that their surplus with third countries has grown like crazy,

  it ca n't be about territory since it 's an island which would be one country if things were resolved .
