  since the ecb is having trouble meeting its 2 % inflation target , i think esa should offer to take some printed money off their hands till things get back to normal . 
  did n't get the irony ... sry, 
   the ecb will be reluctant to buy government bonds out of a long , deep-seated principle to avoid central bank financing of member governments ( a policy on which the bank has relented only at times of crisis , when the currency zone seems at risk of unraveling , not for run-of-the-mill monetary policy ) . 
  jj style http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmlg9reynme, 
  you have n't red the article , have you ? 
  the scenario in my mind was : should the united kingdom remain a member of the european union or leave the european union ? 
  a-yes b-no, 
  not to mention it sucks value out of people 's savings and pensions with no need for parliamentary approval - it 's a hidden tax . 
  inflating your way to competitiveness is fundamentally undemocratic, 
  i considered changing the title , but then had the same thought, 
  a lot of africa had imperialism as well , just not the good kind, 
  i expect a tight result . 
  mind blown thanks, 
  denmark i do like windy weather come to think of it, 
  so does ljubljana :-), 
  i 'm not sure , let me check .

  [ the context .

  i thought english was the first language for gibraltarians . 
  flag ? 
   you just did it again . 
  the above was my first comment in this post . 
  you see what i mean by objectively low quality ? 
  there is such a thing as objective quality . 
  and it just so happens that the anti-eu arguments put forward in this subreddit are disproportionately bad . 
  i obviously think that that holds in general as well since i 'm in the pro-eu camp , but that is n't to say that there are n't good points to be made on the other side ( seeing as the eu is far from perfect and all ) . 
  they just seem to get drowned out by the * tea party * wing equivalent of the anti-eu camp . 
  they have an extra country ion the way, 
  i was originally going to post this under r/mapporn , but then i thought it fits better here . 
  also , who does n't like pictures better than text - let 's keep it real . 
  there is a proposal for [ a finland estonia tunnel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helsinki_to_tallinn_tunnel ), 
  also , the ammo for the military gun is only issued so that the `` soldiers '' can get to the barracks in the event of an invasion . 
  it is kept sealed and subject to snap inspection . 
  in other words , assault weapons are not for recreational use . 
  oh , cool i had n't known that up until today . 
  as long as that principle is consistently implemented in other schengen countries as well , i do n't really see a reason to fix what is n't broken . 
  unless there 's some upward trend in gun violence which needs to be addressed that i 'm not aware of .

  so , it 's the usual ... one side wants to have the cake and the other side wants to eat it decisions , decisions, 
  does anyone know what the arguments were on either side ? 
  is there a chance that germany ( and other european countries ) could pull a snowden and cancel their passports ? 
  it is , but they have been doing an increasing amount of solo action lately from what i understand, 
  but in that situation it would also become very desirable to have greenland back as well , would n't it ? 
  secret agenda much ? 
  i actually enjoyed the childish scribbling ... also , the illustrations were nice, 
  hence the madagascar level life expectancy ( for men ), 
  there 's nothing wrong with a broad national consensus . 
  god knows * we * could use it . 
  agh . . beat me to it :-), 
  it does n't matter who the uploader is . 
  what matters is who 's talking in the actual video, 
  yes , why would n't you ? 
  are there places in the world where criminals knock and only rob your home if you open the door ? 
  does n't croatia have any inland river ports ? 
  i always thought that you had at least the possibility for them up to zagreb . 
  people are muslim . 
  things are islamic, 
  i thought muslims were n't supposed get drunk . 
  live and learn . 
  did n't like it until i saw eurovision on the list have a +1, 
  what 's going on around paris and london ? 
  i do n't get it, 
  [ gradatim ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/gradatim ), 
  i ' a big fan of esa as well , but if you 're making it a factor here , than cern , eso , embl and the other [ eiro ] ( http://www.eiroforum.org/ ) institutions should be there as well . 
  otherwise remove it !, 
  what is it with middle eastern countries ? 
  it 's about damn time also ... am i the only one thinking this ?

  anyone want to go halfsies ? 
  who would check your passport at the border ?

  nazis fighting jihadists i 'm not seeing the downside ... other than the massive humanitarian catastrophe of course . 
  definitely like the new design . 
  it 's win7 to the old one 's vista . 
  yes , but there was an obvious drop yesterday afternoon when this news came out ... not enough to compensate completely for the overall change , but the affect of the news was clearly to reduce yields edit : [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/syckitk ) is what i ment, 
  they dropped like a stone when the news came out ... check the 5 day graph, 
  what is this ? 
  animal cases or human cases ? 
  i see this very much in the light of the eu 's method in the western balkans - step by step . 
  if we just do the things that make sense regardless of membership , we can get quite far . 
  the obvious steps in front of us are solving the cyprus dispute and visa requirements for turks which are more stringent than those applying to any nation in the western balkans . 
  the cyprus situation needs to be solved regardless . 
  it 's insane - an eu member stands divided down the middle by a un buffer zone with eu law and citizenship `` suspended '' in the north . 
  i remind everyone that the year is ad 2013 - let 's just get this done please , so we can move on to more adult issues, 
  slovenia 's real estate market is about as low as it has been in a long time ... good chance to get a sweet deal with a long therm rent agreement . 
  in most cases internet will probably be included in the rent . 
  it is n't spain , but it is cheap and italy and croatia are just next door with austria and hungary in the other direction ... also , everyone speaks english . 
  i doubt very much that it 'll help against ukip . 
  if you 're a eurosceptic , why go for ukip light when you have ukip classic available ? 
  ironically , this would require the government to hire a number of professional killers ... who would presumably have a license for their work - so essentially the death penalty would be for the unlicensed practice of professional killing :-), 
  i was referring to the industrial strength antibiotics which have surely saved his life numerous times, 
  who could have predicted that the advance of medicine could have such horrifying side effects, 
  they have different set of issues ... tentacle porn and all, 
  are you sure that this was n't taken in denmark ? 
  this is how russian peace-keeping works - `` i keep a piece of this , i keep a piece of that ... '',
