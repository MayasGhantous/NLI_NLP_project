  someone must have mixed up * moral abyss * with * geographical abyss *, 
  yes , but that capacity is set to double according to the latest news, 
  i 'm not sure you can legislate that . 
  it seems to me that it 's a media thing . 
  i hate to say it but we need a little bit of what the americans have way too much of . 
  decision 2014 !, 
  edit : that makes my keyboard feel dirty : s, 
  a number of stretches in the `` main cross '' are still single track , the same goes for electrification , there 's no high speed line anywhere , the larger stations are in desperate need of renovation and redesign , the total number of trains which allow for bicycles is in the low single digits and in the summer , ac would be a nice novelty the idea is for trains to be a serious alternative to cars and other forms of road transport , not some sort of plebeian version of it . 
  corruption bonus question : where am i ? 
  their youtube channel has videos with results from many sites and other website has pictures from some more, 
  [ wish granted ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gukhgrag_vs ) partially for now . 
  edit : [ here 's how it works ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se6cr-sfzgw ), 
  gas . 
  a lot of conventional gas . 
  slovenia : better rail infrastructure, 
  til : there is such a thing as the european bison, 
  boy , i look stupid right now, 
  russia has been not so subtly banning imports from moldova and ukraine as revenge for not joining the eurasian union . 
  in moldova 's case they also brought up transnistria, 
  oh , ok ... but you have to wear the spiky hats, 
  * ... to ease some of the difficulties the republic of moldova is experiencing with its wine exports to some of its traditional markets . 
  * god , that 's so passive aggressive i can hear it in my mother 's voice . 
  i actually enjoyed reading the article ... did you not like it ? 
  well , good . 
  now just make sure they do n't come back . 
  it has snow year round , but it only falls during the winter ... the extended winter, 
  definitely worth a reed . 
  the alps got snow two weeks ago, 
  it 's a nice country you 've got there . 
  it 'd be a shame if anything happened to it :-[, 
  in slovenia it was the second headline behind the eurobasket finale that we 're hosting this year . 
  it 's mostly about the results of the election , speculation about the possible coalitions and a little comment about how the substance of the european policy is n't going to change regardless of the outcome . 
  more comment will probably follow tomorrow, 
  i do n't know much about afd , but these sorts of parties tend to look like a bad reality show ... and work for the same reasons . 
  is this the case here as well ? 
  that would be my fantasy football coalition as well, 
  radicals tend to like each other ... until they do n't, 
  i guess nato did do at least one good thing . 
  hey , that 's my wallpaper !, 
  too soon . 
  [ ... on the other hand ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfl6lu3xqw0 ), 
  not on established treaty matters they do n't . 
  if they wanted to change them , they 'd need support in the council , commission and parliament - and they would n't want to change basic internal market principles anyway . 
  this is a typical political promise - a lie . 
  nope . 
  not legal under eu rules to have a special system for non-residents, 
  my natural vote could be alde , but the national party is a complete tragedy, 
  oh , right ... 
  why am i not surprised that the mail on sunday is arguing in favour of wagner ? 
  i think that one may have something to do with the other :-), 
  the slovenian part of the map is divided into municipalities , which mostly lack sufficient facilities to carry out abortions . 
  i 'm assuming the numbers therefore are n't about where it was done but about where the woman is from . 
  interesting how , at least in slovenia , the more conservative areas have higher rates . 
  is this true of other countries as well ? 
  i live nearby . 
  ( well , does n't that sound awkward and creepy ), 
  take a wild guess . 
  also , who 's de benedetti ? 
  works for me , just fyi, 
  i hate this guy with a passion that burns with the heat of a thousand novas, 
  is there a cash award that comes with that prize ? 
  as it turns out there is a eur 50000 prize that comes with it, 
  i have n't the slightest idea what it is . 
  i just googled insulation . 
  meant it as a joke, 
  the seasonal storage option is really best suited for new buildings as it has to be designed into the actual structure ( usually under it ) . 
  with the existing building fleet in europe , retrofitting solutions would have to deliver most of the result , but can certainly be a piece of the puzzle . 
  well sure . 
  i was talking more in regards to international competitiveness since some countries do n't seem to care much about the atmosphere, 
  [ putin 's worst nightmare ] ( http://www.amazingsidingstl.com/portals/0/images/home-insulation.jpg ) :-), 
  the point is it 's too expensive to use normal electricity to do it , but if you have leftover generating capacity when the wind is blowing especially strongly or something , you can use that to make liquid or gas fuel for later ... it 's essentially a battery nuclear is great if you can get it approved ... the problem is , you ca n't . 
  even after approval , it takes over 10 years to build a plant and at this point there are many more nuclear plants due for closure in the next 10 years than have even been proposed , much less begun to be built ... and at the end of the day , you have to import the fuel for taht from somewhere as well . 
  edit : anyway ... the point is that nuclear will not be replacing gas simply becasue of the facts on the ground and the time it takes to build . 
  you can actually use the otherwise unusable peaks in renewable generation to synthesize hydrocarbons, 
  the first obstacle with renewables is that their production fluctuates . 
  that can be mitigated by simple statistics - more diverse sources = smoother production curve , but for that you need a grid . 
  hopefully the energy segment of the connecting europe facility helps get things going in that regard but with $ 9.1 billion over the next 7 years the progress may be limited . 
  also price is a problem . 
  nothing is cheaper than getting magic energy built up over millions of years out of the ground and just burning it . 
  i 'm not sure how we solve that problem . 
  i think putin should reed his own op-ed . 
  russia is n't doing as well is it could be because the people running it subscribe to the idea of russian exceptionalism . 
  they think that while free market economics , rule of law and pluralistic democracy works well for other countries in europe , that does n't apply to russia , because its magic . 
  they can get away with that to a certain extent as long as oil prices are as high as they are , but if they fall significantly and stay down for a few years ... ouch, 
  i think the guys at [ r/mapporn / ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/ ) would love this, 
  well , there were : [ atlantropa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atlantropa ), 
  i 'm against it . 
  if you want to live in any community , respecting its laws should be a given . 
  making your first act upon arriving somewhere a violation of the rules set out by the country is rude if nothing else . 
  the evaporation from the med . 
  is vastly more than the feed in . 
  the only reason its level does n't fall is the feed-in from the atlantic, 
  would n't it make sense , at that point , to protect the mediterranean coastline by blocking off gibraltar ?
