  i assume most of us are ok with prioritising voice over ip and internet tv , but we 're probably against prioritising one website over another or any comperable services over each other because this would be an anticompetitive practice and therefore bad for us consumers there are shades of grey here , not just a simple dichotomy ... some prioritisation makes sense - just from the nature of the services ( see above ) i have no problem if they designate email protocols as low priority for example - it makes sense in fact . 
  i also want , ney demand , that my digital tv works smoothly ( do n't actually have it but if i did i would ) and if that means that my torrent only has 1mb/s dl while i 'm watching desperate housewives ( not really ) on demand , then so be it the important thing here is that i 'm clearly shown what the minimum guaranteed speeds are before i sign up ... and also that there 's no discrimination based on content ... same principle as the 3rd energy package imposed on pipelines -- a gas supplier ca n't own a pipeline directly and the actual owner has to make the pipeline available to all gas suppliers on an equal and competitive basis ... details, 
  they applied , the then members went unofficially through the roof , and they quietly withdrew the application, 
  his loyal opposition ? 
  ... no , but seriously :-), 
  ... if putin passed away quietly in his sleep tonight ? 
  linija :d, 
  you either love him or you hate him . 
  sometimes both at the same time . 
  no , wtf !, 
  as ever , the devil 's in the details here ...

  i took this test once and it placed me below and to the left of alexis tsipras . 
  i do n't buy it - i 've always voted either center-left or center-center ( liberals ) . 
  so either this compass thing is wrong in some way or i 'm really confused : - s, 
  i bring [ potica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nut_roll ) , [ prekmurska gibanica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prekmurska_gibanica ) and [ krem\u0161nita ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kremna_rezina ) . 
  there is a good chance that i could be engaging in wishful thinking just above ... then again , there are n't any numbers available so i get to lie to myself for the time being, 
  the funny ones start at # 4 and continue downward, 
  i remember the same thing ... 
  i could n't find anything very easily , but it may just have been a clever political leak . 
  edit : i think this article does a better job of describing the specifics : [ click ] ( http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/11/europe-lays-out-its-most-ambitious-reform-plan-yet-no-more-roaming-premiums-enforced-net-neutrality-and-more/ ), 
  i think you 're being entirely too pessimistic about the s&d showing and a bit too generous to the far-right . 
  i think s&d and the greens/efa will gain somewhat , but not enough to remove epp ( which will lose some seats ) as the plurality holder . 
  i defer to your judgment regarding alde . 
  there 's a comment under the article which points out the problem with online polls : they tend to get distorted by groups with a strong interest i do n't know what the sample size was here , but in case it was n't very large the result could be rendered completely useless by no more than a few people with an axe to grind, 
  the other half blows over to slovenia, 
  they 've been doing the same thing with [ ukraine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukraine_and_the_eu#russian_reaction ) to little effect . 
  it did seem to work with [ armenia ] ( http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2013/09/04/eu-stunned-by-armenia-u-turn/ ) though . 
  since you 're starting in vienna , you may want to consider [ maribor ] ( http://tinyurl.com/nr3lafl ) and [ ljubljana ] ( http://tinyurl.com/qx57ex4 ) ( no need to change your money and most people speek english well enough ) . 
  great places to visit with plenty to see if you look into it , but in my opinion they 're best suited as places to take a vacation from you vacation . 
  not really made for the industrious tourist . 
  i may be wrong about that , 
  still waiting for you to admit that you were wrong on the original point . 
  till then i 'm not really interested in moving on to the next one, 
  you 're changing the subject ... that 's fine , but i 'd like to have my previous point acknowledged first, 
  no , just saw youtube videos from there ... sort of like in this case, 
  they actually do . 
  the difference is that they do n't get a vote on what those policies are . 
  switzerland to a lesser extent than norway , but even so . 
  the ... word ... is ... football !, 
  i do n't mean this in a derogatory way , but i like these sorts of protests so much more than the occupy type . 
  it 's clever . 
  it 's thoughtful . 
  there 's an argument for producing goods which are cheap and do n't last for long in those cases where technological advancement is rapid . 
  example : i have no interest in paying more for a computer so that it can last for 15 years instead of 5 . 
   the one giving so-called advice has over 50000 troops stationed on your territory it 's no coincidence that people prefer american troops to russian tourists . 
  history , even recent history , makes this an easy choice to make . 
  it 's an interesting academic idea which will never come close to implementation . 
   was n't mr schaeuble that said that greeks did n't vote wisely to be honest , i 'm surprised nobody 's said that about us yet . 
  slovenia and the netherlands have it , not the whole eu . 
  it seems to me that he builds his case on a number of assumptions which could be empirically substantiated , but he never attempts to do anything of the sort . 
  over and over , he makes testable assertions for which he provides no evidence . 
  i have little choice but to recollect the fact that ideas which are asserted without evidence , can also be dismissed without evidence . 
  so much for the foundation of the case . 
  the construction built on top of this foundation seems to be remarkably flimsy as well . 
  perhaps i 'm just not paying enough attention , but from where i 'm sitting , it seems that he spirals into complete gibberish several times . 
  on other occasions he just jumps from one partially made point to another while neglecting to provide any meaningful connections . 
  edit : on at least one occasion , he outright lies - stating that the german population is declining . 
  i upvoted this , but honestly , i do n't know why any more . 
  one of many off topic anti-ukraine comments made one day after a prominent russian oppositionist gets executed and you do n't see the relevance of them being written by a brand new accounts ? 
  there seem to be a lot of people doing that today . 
  interestingly enough , they all seem to have a pro-russian point to make . 
  would you like to explain how jewish europeans * act like a douche * ? 
  thank you for taking the time to translate this . 
  it 's one thing to have clickbait titles , but to do this stuff in the body of the article is essentially just lying . 
  i had the same thought , but maybe build it deep under the alps to mess with the kremlin while we 're at it . 
  i can see his soul . 
  can you see his soul ? 
  on second thought , that may just be a spider on my monitor . 
  my bad .

   i really hope this works and is n't one of those `` good on paper '' ideas . 
  morocco 's been doing this in the north african region for years - it 's not a newfangled idea . 
  it deserves to be defended and reinforced . 
  britain and france = / = eu, 
  the eu has take no action on syria save for the arms embargo and the delivery of humanitarian aid . 
  let 's be precise here please . 
  because they 're demolishing schengen one border at a time . 
  coming soon - to a town near you !, 
  who cares what it 's called . 
  the important thing is that europe 's interests are protected ( edit  and it 's security . 
  [ let 's hope they last the night . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/gxc-jjhfaui ), 
  it 's called a quarantine . 
  european values belong in europe and to it . 
  we would n't want to be cultural imperialists or anything like that . 
  i 's worth a shot . 
  they have [ minefields . 
  ] ( http://envsec.grid.unep.ch/see/maps/landmines.jpg ) does that help ? 
  i agree . 
  i mostly put this here to show what the kremlin narrative is regarding this issue . 
  the fact is that all the border security measures so far are well in line with what schengen allows in special situations . 
  it does look really bad , though . 
  nope . 
  takes them from italy , greece and hungary . 
  the strange thing is that hungary is rejecting a quota system which would relocate a large number of the people currently in the country . 
  what gives ?
