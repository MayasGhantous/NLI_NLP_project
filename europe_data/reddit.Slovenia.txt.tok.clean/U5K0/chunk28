  it 's going well . 
  in 2015 , the year to date number is a quarter of what it was in 2014 . http://www.polioeradication.org/dataandmonitoring.aspx http://www.polioeradication.org/dataandmonitoring/poliothisweek.aspx, 
   how often are you on reddit in an average week ? 
  more than once a day . 
   how often do you visit / r/europe ? 
  i go through all the stories and a few of the comment threads twice a day . 
  i browse the new submission once . 
   what country are you normally resident in ? 
  slovenia  do you speak any languages besides english ? 
  ( if yes : which and to what level ? ), 
  slovene - native , serbian and croatian - passive , german - barely  what interests you about europe ? 
  its present and its future . 
  europe 's a special part of the world - and it 's home . 
   what are your favourite and least favourite things about / r/europe ? 
  i like that it 's a pan-european media environment . 
  i do n't like that a dominant topic has the tendency to flood out everything else while it 's going on . 
   do you have experience as a moderator or similar ? 
  no , sorry . 
   why do you want to be a moderator ? 
  i 'd like to help out . 
   why do you think you would be a good moderator ? 
  i 'm normally a dispassionate person and i want things to be clear and transparent even when it does n't fit my opinion . 
   do you have any expirence with statistics , datamining or reddit bots ? 
  i have a basic understanding of medical statistics . 
  does that help ? 
   what is your opinion on the immigration megathread ? 
  what do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? 
  it 's a broad topic and it 's difficult to decide which submissions should be transferred to the megathread and which are general enough to be left in the general population . 
  a filter may have been a better solution , but there is n't really a perfect one . 
   what 's one weakness you have ? 
  no experiance :*(  would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses ? 
  the horse sized duck , definitely . 
   what single word connects all of these three of the following words : europe , pussy cat , teacher ? 
  nonsense  explain why i googled it . 
  this thread fills the first page . 
  yummy, 
   probably similar to the stories passed on to europe from people who migrated to usa during the 1800s this hit me like a ton of bricks . 
  we learned about these sort of tragic stories in history class . 
  it 's shocking to realise that people think the same thing about europe today . 
  i believe you call it good friday . 
  and yes , it is . 
   the only way to prevent it is by limiting immigration to such small numbers , that the individuals have no other alternative but to integrate . 
  this fails to account for what happened after millions of germans migrated to the same , relatively empty region in the us . 
  it also is n't consistent with the relatively small numbers of roma throughout europe who have n't integrated into the wider social fabric . 
  so far , numbers have not been the crucial factor in determining the success or failure of integration . 
  broadly speaking , it seems to come down to whether newcomers are able to mingle with the rest of the population in the various social spheres ; education , employment , culture , politics etc. 
  opponents , competitors , whatever . 
   as an atheist , i prefer seeing christian being the dominant religion in europe , as opposed to seeing islam dominating europe . 
  as an atheist , i prefer seeing * none * being the dominant religion in europe . 
  that 's easier to achieve when the enemy has a divided front and is distracted by their own internal bickering over the finer points of their favourite fantasy . 
   what often happens is that they form very closed communities with very vocal minorities hence the urgent need to deploy integrationist measures like language courses and combating the orban type response . 
  this problem is far easier to prevent than it is to solve . 
   muslims exposed to the most secular states the world has ever seen often ** become more radical , not less . 
  ** you 've linked to a poll which arguably provides an * after * picture . 
  you still need a * before * dataset.there 's also the problem that this poll only examines the opinions of individuals who continue to identify as muslim and excludes those who no longer do . 
  we 're left with a data set which is hopelessly selective as well as lacking in the * before * category . 
  sauce ? 
   your feel-good , generalized rubbish about how all religions are equally bad and good makes no sense i was n't suggesting that all religions are equally bad . 
  i was suggesting that all religions are equally doomed . 
  and 80 % + of russian russians think puin 's just a swell guy . 
  when people are n't exposed to opposing views , it 's unrealistic to expect they 'll just figure it out on their own . 
  your original comment suggested that an islamic identity might replace the christiona one in europe . 
  fat chance . 
   but the eu is so heterogeneous that those graphs are n't really meaningful the other places are also quite heterogeneous . 
  it 's just more rare to see statistics which show it , so people forget . 
  islam is no more immune to enlightenment secularism than any other religion . 
  the occasional psycho does n't change that general dynamic . 
  looks like my high school cafeteria during lunch . 
  except on veggie day . 
  i , for one , am quite happy to see europe 's christian identity threatened . 
  you 've missed my point . 
  i think the gulf arab states should be doing a lot more than the nothing they currently are . 
  everyone should . 
  as regards europe : these people are coming . 
  short of shooting them at the border , we ca n't stop them . 
  the question is [ what can be done ] ( http://image.slidesharecdn.com/mobileweb-040609-public-090608154012-phpapp02/95/mobile-future-2020-18-728.jpg?cb=1434543569 ) to make them productive , well integrated into our society as opposed to a perpetual problem which boils over from time to time . 
  that 's a legitimate point , but overstated in my opinion . 
  given that especially the syrian refugees are mainly middle class urbanites who grew up in a secular country , the only large difference is one of language . 
  given the relatively much smaller numbers , language classes can compensate for that to a large extent . 
  i would just like to point out that an especially important thing to do is to teach the kids the language quickly and put them into regular schools asap , not some special refugee schools . 
  this saves you a lot of trouble later on . 
  it 's hardly racist to say we should n't follow these countries ' example when it comes to human rights . 
  there 's also nothing wrong with admiting that europe is generally better than most of the world . 
  this woild be problematic if i tried to claim that it was because of race . 
  it 's because of how we conduct our affairs at present - and it is reversible . 
  it 's also something other countries can adopt over time . 
  we had cca 70.000 refugees here during the balkan wars and it has n't had any such effect . 
  for perspective , our total population is about 2 million . 
  it made our football team better though . 
  also , our morning radio . 
  fyi : you ca n't throw regular paper into the toilet without a risk of clogging up the plumbing . 
  because we 're better than the gulf arab states ? 
  [ orders of magnitude . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/euratom/index_en.cfm?pg=fusion&amp;section=safety-and-environment )  at the end of a ** fusion power ** station 's working life the radiotoxicity in the reactor chamber and other structural and waste materials will decay rapidly . 
  in ** less than 100 years ** the residual activity of these materials would be less than the radiotoxicity found in the waste from a conventional coal-fired power station . 
  fusion power will not burden society with a long-term toxic waste issue . 
  the decay period for waste from ** fission ** power plants is anywhere from thousands ** up to hundreds of thousands of years ** . 
  you need to look at the scale of the problem and the places where it 's going to be most pressing . 
  india and china ( and africa in due time ) have areas with insane population density by european standards and even higher energy consumption density due to a greater dependency on industry and lower efficiency . 
  combine that with a terrible grid infrastructure ( especially the long range elements ) and the idea of powering these places using wind and solar alone becomes scary difficult .
