  even japan has a difficult time switching to wind/solar and thy have access to lots of money , good infrastructure and high-tech industry . 
  perhaps this technology wo n't be essential for europe or the us , but killing coal on a global scale will be close to impossible without it . 
  that 's why it has to be adapted , not scrapped . 
  it wo n't be israel , just pro-israeli rebels . 
  ( i know it 's getting old , but i refuse to let it go and i wo n't apologise for that ), 
  if you look at the most optimistic projections from the iea , you 'll see that on a global level , we 'll still be using mostly coal for power generation 50 + years from now . 
  at that point , fusion plants 'll be a lot easier to deploy than the enormous amount of intermittent renewables infrastructure which would be required to do the same job . 
  also , it never hearts to have an extra option . 
  what little hot waste there is also decays to a safe state a lot faster than the stuff from fission plants . 
  you take back to where you bought it or where you 're buying a replacement .

  this is not texas !, 
  perhaps a glass of red instead ? 
  in high school `` going out for coffee '' usually meant getting very , very drunk on a weekday . 
  building a wall . 
  no , really . 
  we 're starting work on an extension to a partially apartment-ised former barn . 
  mortar dries faster than i remembered . 
  no slovenia either :*(, 
  what if someone ( let 's say a ukip supporter ) went to the lithuanian part of the internet and decided to hold you indirectly responsible for something horrible somebody said there ? 
  not fair . 
  what are you , the national hand-grenade association ? 
  did they sow hand-grenades ? 
  you can always keep a few spares or just replace it with the same model or another model that works with the existing kernel . 
  i get that it 's a big city , but how often do they need to buy new hardware ? 
  could n't they just synchronise the hardware purchases with the kernel update and avoid the problem entirely ? 
  i thought i was largely fluent in computer-speak . 
  i can see that i 'm not . 
  yes , but there 's something to be said for the focus inspired by the 6 month deadline . 
  it 's a good idea to put more specific information in the title if you want it to get more attention . 
   here you can see the hypocracy of the western world what does that even mean in this context ? 
  are you just repeating something you 've heard because it * feels * right to you ? 
  this is the sort of thing americans call a `` bumper sticker '' . 
  completely useless for any sort of productive discussion . 
  i know a great deal about the conflict . 
  i just do n't care . 
  i also do n't think it 's deserving of the sort of attention it gets . 
  there are bigger things going on in the world which get far less media attention . 
  a far bigger version of this has been going on with morocco/western sahara for decades , but it 's not the holy land , so it gets zero minutes on tv . 
  a small israel/palestine protest in a european city - why is this news ? 
  http://asdl.us/defiance-s03e12-the-awakening/ http://asdl.us/dark-matter-s01e11/, 
  normally i would agree , but it seems to me that , at the moment , a lot of the political good will is exhausted . 
  it 's also not good timing in as far as we need to deal with the migration issue in a collective manner . 
  i hope i 'm proven wrong and a solid , systemic solution is put in place , but my normal optimism is absent right now . 
  hopefully , it 's just a death in the family leaking into other areas of my mind . 
  look at turkey being all reasonable . 
  i have n't seen the interview referenced in the article . 
  does anyone happen to know if he said word one about reducing the influx as opposed to simply absorbing anyone who shows up ? 
  thanks . 
  i still wish he could find something else to vaguely not promise - or , better yet , propose something like boosting europol which may actually do some good in this regard . 
  it 's also the driving force behind an enormous amount of vague non-promises which are never heard from again . 
  is there context to this ? 
  in the story about the german minister who said schengen was in danger , he was asked that question 3 times with growing levels of suggestiveness . 
  he said no twice and said maybe the third time , but the headline only took the third answer and sexed it up . 
  this is crucial . 
  exchanging certain liberties for some safety can sometimes be a fair bargain for a time . 
  this , however seems like it would involve compromising on a fundamental freedom in exchange for nothing and with no clear time horizon . 
  the word * scam * comes to mind . 
  given the body 's limited power , they 're essentially confined to pushing for amendments on legislation from the lower house . 
  the lower house is dominated by political parties , so it 's no surprise that they sometimes make technical bloopers . 
  the upper house seems to catch those before they become law and sends back an amended version . 
  the lower house can then re-pass the original if they want to , but usually adopt the amendment . 
  the upper house members also have access to the national media , so they can bring a topic to the news if they want to . 
  note that the employers only have 4 seats in a 40 seat body . 
  it 's not really distinguished by any single narrow interest . 
  when compared to the politically dominated lower house , it mostly just looks boring , technical and boring . 
  ( edit : which is the idea behind it as i understand it ), 
  the constitution determines the categories ( the self-employed and non-economic groups are broken down further ) and quotas in my first comment . 
  it also determines that organisations only participate in the election of their own sector 's representative - obviously . 
  the actual people who fill the seats are elected by an assembly of electors which are named by all those organisations which fit the category and function throughout the entire state ( except the local interest representatives - obviously ) . 
  the number of electors from each organisation is determined by the size of its membership as verified by the state election commission . 
  technically , we have 2 houses of parliament , but all the power is with the lower house . 
  the upper house is essentially an institutionalised home for legitimate interest groups to discuss things - they can also propose legislation , trigger a constitutional assessment of a new law or start a parliamentary investigation ; * employer groups , -  4 seats * employee groups , -  4 seats * self-employed ( farmers , contractors , etc. 
  ) , -  4 seats * non-economic groups , -  6 seats * local interests ( municipalities and such ) . 
  -  22 seats, 
  conventions can be withdrawn from . 
  good . 
  iran is the least creepy midle eastern country by a wide margin . 
  some would say that the two are connected . 
  my mistake . 
  dublin 2 , in combination with schengen makes the migrant crisis impossible to solve . 
  it forbids push-back and offshore processing . 
  schengen , on the other hand , means that you 've got a free path from lampedusa and lesbos to leipzig . 
  either you control the influx at the external schengen border - which requires the scrapping of dublin 2 , or you do it at the national borders , which requires the scrapping of schengen . 
  the third option is allowing millions of illegal migrants to overwhelm the welfare system in one eu country after another . 
  * no refunds, 
  australia made deals with less appealing destinations in the region . 
  i 'm sure the libyan government could be persuaded to host a few processing centres if we offered the right incentives . 
  they have insane amounts of empty land far from everything and on the right side of the mediterranean . 
  must be rightful yuropean clay .

  hung-over . 
  the eu has never been given the resources or the legal/political authority needed to deal with a migrant crisis not seen since wwii . 
  all the relevant powers are with the member states . 
  it is they which clearly can not be relied upon to deal with emergent regional and global issues . 
  their reflexive reluctance to work as a group will either give way to a cosolidated eu approach or will persist and lead to the unraveling of existing achievements in the area of inegration . 
  i love the prjnciple of subsidiarity , but it 's long past time to admit that this convept works in two directions .
