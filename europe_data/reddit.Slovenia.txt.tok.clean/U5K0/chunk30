  europe is falling apart !, 
   for some reason, 
  for some reason i think germany only has big cities . 
  are you even sure about that ? 
  have you checked ? 
  you ca n't find a loophole to get what is n't there . 
  if the retailers find ways of preventing waste , there is n't anything to hand over to charities and food banks . 
  plus , you can always make the non-profits make sure someone with money ca n't get to food intended for the poor . 
  it 's an abbreviation for ** s ** lovenska ** t ** iskovna ** a ** gencija english : slovenian press agency, 
  i think the idea is to force the retailers to find a way to still make money while not wasting food . 
  i like that he has a ** cock ** in his belgium/netherlands picture . 
  a few of my favourite russian contributions to humanity : [ tsiolkovsky rocket equation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation ) [ tokamak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tokamak ) [ lunokhod ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lunokhod_programme ) [ sputnik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sputnik_1 ) [ graphene ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/graphene ) more [ here .

  ... in 3 months 1,5 % over the past 12 months, 
  ai n't no party like a euro party cus a [ euro party do n't stop !,

  here you go : http://www.rtvslo.si/news-in-english/rss/ https://english.sta.si/rss, 
  slovakia , slavonia , slovenia it 's like an irregular verb or something . 
  it means we 're not very creative . 
  we just took the coat of arms slovenia has within yugoslavia and slapped it on the old pan-slavic flag and moved on to the next task . 
  i got a reply from the mods . 
  i should have put this into the migration megathread . 
  my bad . 
  the key word is ** invest . 
  ** this is going to be very profitable for norway . 
  they process the undocumented arrivals off-shore so even if they leave the housing facility , they ca n't just dispensary into the country . 
  the only way to actually become a resident is to go through the system . 
  since this has been in place , migration has reduced to a trickle of what it was a few years ago . 
  in europe they just leave without waiting for a determination of status , so it makes no difference what the laws are or if you catch them or not . 
  has this thread been removed from r/europe ? 
  wtf , mods !, 
  can anyone confirm your whereabouts since then ? 
  this makes you the jews ? 
  not good . 
  we can throw as much money at this as we want . 
  if the australian model is n't adopted , it 'll all be for nothing . 
  that sort of subsidy should be counted as public expenditure . 
  the bigger question is why does a simple utility company with a monopoly position have a deficit ? 
  again , their problem . 
  do n't forget it !, 
  [ smiles ], 
  the year is not 1940 . 
  you do n't need a fighter to take down a fighter . 
  you do n't need a ship to sink a ship . 
  as of now , 16 aircraft are part of the nato baltic air policing mission , and their number ** will be reduced to eight in autumn ** . 
  ** before events in ukraine , the patrolling mission consisted of four aircraft ** . 
  be careful not to get too cute , comrade . 
  a currency is stable if it buys the same this week as it did last week , i.e. 
  inflation close to 0 . 
  none of the eras you mention display greater currency stability than the euro period . 
   - and it was more stable . 
  i 'm looking at the inflation rate in cyprus over the past 60 years and i ca n't find any sign of superior stability pre 2008 . 
  i do n't get it . 
  what does that have to do with anything ? 
  cyprus stands out . 
  the purpose of the organisation can change over time . 
  galileo is designed to be compatible and interoperable with gps . 
  you 'll probably have both in most devices , which 'll make it a lot easier to see 4 satellites . 
  the actual hardware required to receive both signals is quite cheap . 
  no real reason to have an exclusive device . 
  the sensible thing to do here would be to pool some money and make them the core of a more credible frontex . 
  found one . 
  feel free to resubmit if you like it . 
  this just went out . 
  i 'm sure you 'll be able to find some press articles about it tomorrow . 
   what i mean is , gdp per capita is measured in usd . 
  i thought we were still talking about the 1 % q2 growth figure . 
  the year-on-year figure is 3,7 % the long term trend looks like it 's not really affected by `` seasonal shit '' . 
  ppp does n't adjust for exchange rates . 
  it adjusts for cost of living . 
  over a longer period , forex has a tendency to track ppp , but ppp certainly does n't help you with eur/usd over the past year for example . 
  ppp is nice for historical comparisons , but the adjustment from nominal can do weird things to an individual data point . 
  historical chart for context : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/gdp-growth, 
   judges/jury that have been bought by one side not really a determination which either side can be trusted to make , is it ? 
  that 's why it 's up to the court to decide if what you 're saying is true or not . 
   there 's article 60. , so there 's a possibility to break the process imo . 
  that 's croatia 's argument at the moment , but it 's up to the court to decide if the argument is valid . 
   so , whatever would be decided would also mean that disputes would last afterwards . 
  by that logic , any sort of ruling in any venue is invalid so long as one of the sides dislikes it . 
  edit : typo, 
  in terms of international law , this is an empty gesture ( edit : but it plays well domestically in an election year ) . 
  a country ca n't unilaterally withdraw from this sort of proceeding once it signs up to it . 
  croatia has submitted a request to end the process , but it 's [ up to the pca to decide what happens next .

  i meant the triangle where the normal grid seems to deteriorate . 
  what 's going on in the top part ? 
  i think this may only be controversial in france . 
  i do n't think anyone outside has ever heard of what is , essentially , historical trivia . 
  i 'll delete it if you want . 
  why would you use a helicopter for something like this ? 
  is the terrain too tough for fire-trucks ? 
  along with the rest of the copernicus constellation . 
  perhaps , but if it were designed in a way which allowed communication in the absence of full solar panel deployment , you 'd still have an operational lander , albeit with reduced power . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beagle_2 the probe has 4 panels covering the comms kit . 
  if one of them fails to deploy , you 're dead . 
  we now know that only the first 2 deployed for whatever reason . 
  for all we know , it could 've just been a software glitch . 
  getting it there in one piece counts for a lot.the problem is that it never fully deployed and so the antenna was never exposed .
