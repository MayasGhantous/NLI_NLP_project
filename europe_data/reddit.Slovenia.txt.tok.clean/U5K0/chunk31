  that 's an easy fix for next time ... the landing is the hard part . 
  just a modern version of the maypole , i think . 
  we just decided it 's our thing . 
  we strip a tree and plant it in a hole [ in front of the person 's house .

  i find that any headline that does n't give a timeframe for the % is always referring to installed capacity as opposed to realised generation . 
  i should have put an / s in there , but did n't really think it was needed in this case . 
  i 'm pretty pissed about that as well . 
  brought to you by unelected bureaucrats / s  but this success has not been cheap . 
  between 2002 and 2018 , the programme will have received $ 69m ( # 49m ; $ 76m ) in funding , mainly from the european union . 
  greece is starring in the drama , but what it really wants to do is direct ... aka , germany 's job . 
  i 'm embarrassed to admit ... 
  i 've never actually read my passport . 
  decent foods separately . 
  together - wtf !, 
  i did n't know you can duplicate submissions . 
  is that just me ? 
   duplicated ? 
  not sure what you mean by that ? 
  all of these articles should come with a chart : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/composite-pmi, 
  introduce accountability for public sector administrative personnel in cases when their mistakes cause financial damage to citizens or businesses - or the state come to think about it . 
  essentially the same sort of thing that private sector employees are subject to . 
  i agree , but 70 \u00b0 f is way to low . 
  that 's 21 \u00b0 c. 
  that 's a fair temperature in the winter , when you 're heating , but during a heat wave ? 
  yes , [ this guy 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_dobrindt ) really scary . 
  * stop using roads !, 
  * is not a realistic way of reducing ghg emissions for anyone outside north korea . 
  since this is not an option , you 're picking between driving on good roads and bad ones . 
  takes more ghg intensive resources to drive on bad roads . 
  more gas , more tire changes , more suspension repairs , slower driving , more crashes , more traffic jams , etc. 
  people need to to go places . 
  you can do that more efficiently on better roads . 
  [ google tranaslation ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.spiegel.de%2fpolitik%2fdeutschland%2fdobrindt-will-2-7-milliarden-euro-in-strassen-stecken-a-1044374.html ), 
  is there a newer one out ? 
  if you take a look at some of the polls that are broken down by age , you 'll find that this situation is improving over time . 
  and long overdue . 
  think of all the time and fuel going to waste because of these archaic flightpaths . 
  you drive-by commenters are like the graffiti vandals of the internet . 
  your `` opinion '' is of such non-existent quality that it ca n't make it in any medium with standards , so you just dump your pathetic excuse for a thought wherever you can get away with it . 
  good . 
  maybe he and varufakis can make a sitcom together . 
  the place where i get my coffee does n't have to be a caf\u00e9 , but it seems a bit silly to try reinventing the wheel if there 's already a perfectly serviceable solution available . 
  how much of a delay could there have been given that the planes were on route within hours of the request being issued ? 
  i think you just mentioned bureaucracy because it 's an established emotional trigger without actually having any specific substance in mind . 
  france sent 3 planes : http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-15-5410_en.htm, 
  dateline : to catch a rioter, 
   cars were burning , underground stations became the target of vandalism . 
  it seems they were protesting motorised transportation . 
  lost t at  ... yearning to smash shit up '', 
  til that italy is a balkan country, 
  i do n't really see how welfare arrangements would be impacted . 
  really the only impact comes from the single market and the freedom of movement . 
  if that has n't destroyed the model , i do n't see how more centralisation of foreign policy , defence etc. , would make a difference to it . 
  not that it would be a copy of the us , but they have different union laws and labour standards form one state to another . 
  am i just missing something obvious here ? 
   but we are lacking nurses , doctors , policemans but we have plenty of administrators . 
  just give them some scalpels and guns - problem solved !, 
  obligatory \u017di\u017eek : https://youtu.be/bwdrhqnz9lo, 
  to be fair , this would be an annually recurrent expense . 
  i works out to 72 $ per person per year ( or 1,40 $ per week ) to increase the budget to 1000 % of its current size . 
  a budget of 40 + billion $ would make nasa look small . 
  the world is sick ... 
  running, 
  he got a bit of a laugh . 
  i do n't think the press are wired for sound . 
  he did n't tweet it . 
  he said it out loud in front of the entire brussels press corps . 
  give the man some coffee . 
  and that 's all that ever matters . 
  it 's not about how 's important the meeting is . 
  it 's about how important the participants are . 
  i 'm sure this joke has a punchline but i ca n't seem to find it ... sry . 
  what does serbia have to do with this ? 
  huh ? 
  as a matter of fact , we did . 
  the gdp figure is from the time of lending . 
  i just want to point out that slovenia is greece 's biggest creditor as a % of gdp . 
  dude , all things considered , i do n't think you want to be greece right now . 
  what a clown . 
  it 'll be a public address . 
  everyone will hear it . 
  if he wants to make a push for a new proposal , the parliament is good place to do it . 
  that 'll take a lot of gravity assists . 
  mario draghi has said that some of the security system cables will have to be removed to allow for the placement of the gift inside the vault . 
  they will be reconnected when technicians arrive tomorrow . 
  yup , it 's grexit vs grin, 
  what 's the other option , gratus quo ? 
  look at the flair, 
  hey , if it sells copy , it 's better than facts . 
  buildingburka \u2122, 
  you 're right , it 's a year old map . 
   limited freedom of panorama in lithuania is granted by article 28 ( `` limitations to copyright in works of architecture and sculptures '' ) of the law amending the law on copyright and related rights . 
  this allows a photographer to make and publish pictures of sculptures and works of architecture that are permanently located in public places ( excluding works presented in museums and exhibitions ) , but they can not be used commercially in any form . 
  the mona lisa 's out of copyright because of its age , not sure what the situation is with the eiffel tower . 
  perhaps it 's meant to be a `` warning '', 
  these sort of holier-than-thou statements are precisely how they lost the pr battle . 
  if they had stuck to the pragmatic fundamentals which very clearly demand a substantial amount of debt relief , they 'd have a great deal more public understanding across the continent . 
  instead they chose confrontation from a weak position and he result was predictable : a non-sympathetic response from the side holding most of the strong cards leading to a further weakening of syriza 's position .
