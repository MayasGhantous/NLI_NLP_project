  [ ... ] penalties have to be effective , proportionate and dissuasive . 
  this means that providers infringing the net neutrality rules will face significant pecuniary and administrative sanctions . 
  tldr : it 's ** up to national regulators to prevent abuse ** of the specialised and innovative services exemption . 
  actually , i think the website part of hulu and netflix get treated the same as yahoo , it 's just the video streaming part that gets priority in those cases where it needs it to provide a smooth video . 
  this would likely apply to individual packets during spikes in traffic - very short periods of time . 
  a story about the us in 2014 - completely irrelevant to this discussion . 
  would you care to provide the specific language which you describe ? 
   op is a lying fear-mongering ~ ~ bag ~ ~ bundle of sticks . 
  ftfy, 
  this did n't happen under the just agreed eu legislation . 
   allows reasonable day-to-day traffic management according to justified technical requirements , and which ** must be independent of the origin or destination of the traffic **, 
  important :  there can be no paid prioritisation of traffic in the internet access service . 
  at the same time , equal treatment allows ** reasonable day-to-day traffic management according to justified technical requirements ** , and which ** must be independent of the origin or destination ** of the traffic . 
  to be fair , people who go to ch are rich enough not to care about this sort of stuff . 
  no , it did n't . 
  there 's an explicit ban on any payed privileging based on source/destination with the only allowed differences based on technical differences ; different * types of services * - not different services of the same type . 
  when it 's between a conspiracy and human ineptitude , well , you know which one 's the safer bet . 
  it 's a terribly misleading title and should be labelled as such . 
  this really say it all :  there can be no paid prioritisation of traffic in the internet access service . 
  at the same time , equal treatment allows reasonable day-to-day traffic management according to justified technical requirements , and which must be independent of the origin or destination of the traffic . 
  it would be insane to legally impose an equivalence between more sensitive services like iptv and voip on the one hand and more robust ones like http and ftp on the other . 
  even highways require heavy vehicles to exclude themselves from traffic based on objective conditions like wind or snow . 
  misleading , sensationalist title . 
  nice job . 
  depending on the actual language and the way the states transpose the directive , there may be abuses here and there , but the idea of allowing service classes so long as competition within the classes is protected is the most sensible solution by a large margin . 
  from a technical point of view , it just makes sense to give priority to those services which are more disruption sensitive over the ones which are more robust ; ip tv and voip compared to http , ftp , e-mail . 
  the crucial point is to prevent favouritism toward specific service packages . 
  so long as competition within service types is protected , this is good . 
   anything short of full-blown net neutrality is bad , very bad . 
  that 's just not true . 
  if you have full neutrality , you ca n't even prioritise voice over ip or ip tv above less sensitive services like http . 
  this would be absurd . 
  neutrality within a service class - between competing services - is what make s sense . 
  anything more and you 're essentially legislating against the more disruption sensitive services and in favour of less sensitive ones . 
  anything less and you 're enabling the cable companies to set up a protectionist racket with their own services . 
  a race to the bottom is the established dynamic in the developed part part global economy based on the currently existing fundamentals . 
  every country in the world wants a piece of the developed economy market share - and the up and comers are willing to do it for less if necessary . 
  the good stuff is being more evenly distributed across the world and , aside from having huge amounts of oil or gold , there really is n't any way to avoid it leaking away from the areas where it 's previously been disproportionately concentrated . 
  edit : i should note that `` the bottom '' here is a moving target ; moving upward , that is . 
  as the standard of living in china , india and africa rise , and labour costs along with them , it becomes easier to compete with them - and as long as we maintain comparative advantages in other areas , we need n't race all the way to the rising , but still quite low , bottom . 
  iirc both the eurogroup and the ec have said that the offer remains on the table and the door remains open ... did n't think to check if they meant till tuesday or till after the referendum . 
  still , if they 're bothering with a nai campaign , it 's reasonable to assume the offer stands - in spite of some technicalities . 
  the yes scenario offers a specific , defined situation . 
  the no scenario is a complete unknown . 
  it 's clear that both are bad , but i have yet to hear a convincing argument in support of the idea that the no scenario is less bad than the yes scenario . 
  has the government ( which is campaigning for the no vote ) actually described what comes next if they get their wish ? 
  ** tldr : did n't really give an answer , sry **, 
  this would be funny if it were n't ... you know ... a disaster . 
  well , is n't that a conveniently gelatinous concept ? 
  any idea what happens between tuesday and sunday ? 
  is this decided day by day ? 
  more importantly , their electoral prospects . 
  good point . 
  the americans have it easy . 
  they 're all colour coded so you never forget who 's who . 
  what happens if the result is yes ? 
  maybe we can have a sausage party movement . 
  did i miss the part where iceland is no longer a capitalist country ? 
  if the radical change you 're talking about are capital controls , cyprus did those ... do they still qualify as neo liberal or not ? 
  would you like to remind us of the last time a radical change worked out well for the people who actually lived through it ( or tried to ) ? 
  one day , we 'll see a mediterranean ec president and all will be right with the world . 
  thanks . 
  off topic - would you happen to know what the difference is between salafi and takfiri ? 
  a journey of a thousand * kilometers * starts with a single step . 
  i tend to agree with you regarding the mod interventions . 
  having said that , i think there 's also something to be said for denying terrorists the attention which is fundemetal to the way they operate . 
  ideally , that should be done by down voting , not mod removal . 
  video ? 
  just another unelected german technocrat .

  bosnia kosovo namibia mozambique el salvador east timor, 
  it 's not about what i call it . 
  it 's about repeating something which has worked repeatedly in similar situations in the past rather than what you describe in your previous comment . 
   can you name one situation since ww2 where large scale western intervention in the region led to more stability . 
  i was thinking more along the lines of a typical peacemaking mission combined with a strong diplomatic push and reconstruction effort . 
  nothing * pie in the sky * . 
  i do n't . 
  i wish we had the political will to stabilise libya over the next 5 or so years . 
  it would n't be some astronomical challenge . 
  it 's a country of 5 million people . 
  most of them are concentrated around the coast . 
  there 's plenty of oil and gas . 
  the un , the african union , france have been known to fix worse situations . 
  if we wanted to , we could fix this . 
  there 's the significant matter of pissing off the turkish government , which is backing libyan dawn , but they 're busy with internal issues right now . 
  there may not be a better time to do it . 
   when have politicians ever renegged on their promises ?!, 
  typically , after an election . 
  that is n't the situation here . 
   the sheer gaul of it . 
  ftfy, 
  will the next one be using carmina burana ? 
  iron man 4 ? 
  because this is the result when glorious yurop does nation building . 
  the ecb is `` printing '' tens of billions every month and will continue to do so till the end of 2016 at least . 
  and a limit . 
  some frienemy-ish advice to putin : beware of tsipras bearing gifts . 
  so , you agree with german industry ? 
  how many of the signatures on the geneva conventions were democratically legitimate ? 
  should all agreements with china , russia , iran etc.
