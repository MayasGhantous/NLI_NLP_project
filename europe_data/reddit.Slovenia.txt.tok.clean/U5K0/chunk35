  ww2 happened because of how ww1 happened/ended . 
  aside from the banal enumeration aspect , there really is no way to have something like ww2 in the absence of something very much like ww1 preceding it . 
  i do n't mean that they 're the same . 
  it 's that the second is clearly a consequence of the first and is in many ways defined by this fact . 
  ww2 was essentially a rematch of ww1 . 
  ww1 was pointless . 
  by the translative property of war , ww2 was pointless . 
  my understanding is that things went to hell when a certain someone began to hijack the federal structures by subsuming vojvodina and kosovo in violation of the existing constitutional order,

  it 's not a matter of geographical or demographic scale . 
  the thing which makes direct democracy untenable is the complexity of a given issue . 
  granted , there 's a correlation between complexity and size , but it 's far from perfect . 
  there are issues which could be put to a vote at the european level with the reasonable expectation that the vast majority of voters would understand the question and the choices . 
  at the other end , there are issues at the municipal level which the electorate ca n't be expected to process in a thoughtful way . 
  it comes down to whether people can and will take the time to learn and think about the topic to the extent which is demanded by its complexity . 
  as a result , simplicity of an issue and directness of its impact on people are the main factors which make direct democracy an effective method of making good decisions . 
  the first reduces the amount of effort required while the second increase the amount of effort which people are likely to invest .

  you do n't ban an entire category of products because the ignorant masses have a bug up their collective ass . 
  you consider the individual products and decide based on an objective set of criteria which is applied regardless of category .
