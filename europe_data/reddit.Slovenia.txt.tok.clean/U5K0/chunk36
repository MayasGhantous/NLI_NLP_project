  the point is that the overpopulation problem is being caused elsewhere and that 's where it will have to be solved . 
  making europe more sparsely populated does n't address any of the fundamental causes which lead to overpopulation in certain areas . 
  europe is not overpopulated,

  it may just be me , but it seems that a 6 minute funny-song is n't really the best format to make fun of this topic . 
  the other rapnews videos deal with issues which are far more straight forward . 
  in this case it feels as if they just did it because it 's a prominent topic regardless of whether it makes for good satire in this form . 
  the speed of a proton at 6,5 tev, 
  if you accelerated ** 1g of material ** to that speed , it ** would have 3 times the energy of the tsar bomba ** detonation . 
  how could they ever become famous ? 
  ups . 
  i remembered submitting it to r/space but forgot about the linked . 
  still , this one has a video . 
   esperanto the problem is that we live in the real world . 
  there 's no real reason for anyone to learn esperanto . 
   it is still an unfair advantage for native english speakers . 
  it was always going to be an unfair advantage for someone . 
  look at the bright side : the metric system rules the world ( but not in plumbing for some reason ) . 
  [ lojze slak - v dolini tihi ] ( https://youtu.be/giot4noabl0 ), 
  given the geography , you need these planes . 
  you either upgrade the fleet or you replace it . 
  guess which option is cheaper . 
  is this going to be a thing now ? 
  where we have a post every time the greek government signs a sensible housekeeping contract ? 
  what do you do if someone builds a prison ?

  it 's the equivalent of passing a note in class . 
  the fuck ? 
  very , but not in a french way . 
  the size makes multilingualism a necessity . 
  speaking the language here is * the * criterion for inclusion . 
  if you speak it , you 're one of us , if you do n't you 're not . 
  family history , religion , place of birth , complexion fade the moment you hear someone someone speak your language . 
  this applies to a lesser extent as regards regional dialects . 
  the cartoons are unhelpful in this context . 
  the article itself is actually much more nuanced and worth reading . 
  https://youtu.be/toyt5sggdgi enjoy, 
  just some silly dispute that those people to the south insisted on having .

  i was refering more to the fact that people were running from military and paramilitary groups rather than for some other reason . 
  i did n't even notice the ustasha stuff the first time ... 
  i guess it just gets filtered out at this point . 
  the only thing asteroids respond to is force . 
  he kinda has a point . 
  even if he did n't , the regular thing to do would be to lodge a formal note of protest with the serbian foreign ministry , if that . 
  or , you know , respond to a verbal statement with your own verbal statement . 
  recalling an ambassador because you 're butthurt is just silly . 
  that 's not a good reason . 
  normally , countries recall ambassadors in response to serious transgressions by the government of another country . 
  anyone know why zagreb * really * recalled its ambassador ? 
  when are the next elections over there ? 
  this mission has been planned for some time . 
  look it up . 
  it 's real . 
  i get that this is a joke , but building a common blue water fleet would actually make more sense than building a common army - at least as a first step . 
  a peacekeeping and humanitarian armada ? 
  was the phrase * secret ( ex ) communists * too subtle ? 
  also , is n't jj more hated and feared than he is blamed ? 
  right now , sure . 
  it wo n't be the case in a month ... 
  so most of the year , the reverse is true . 
  right wingers blame secret ( ex ) communists , left wingers blame neoliberalism , the rest of us blame ourselves ( see suicide rates ) . 
  i like that switzerland got included . 
  does n't surprise me . 
  when we had issues with our neighbours it was a very important part of domestic politics . 
  it 's gotten far more boring in recent years and it seems that people take it for granted , but if some political party stared causing trouble in this sense , they 'd definitely take a hit . 
  this is an interesting topic . 
  how many of you find this surprising ? 
  what 's the situation in your country ? 
  thank god , i thought i 'd have to format my disk . 
  do n't know ... my german sucks, 
  agreed . 
  reflects the budget difference almost perfectly . 
  boka kotorska makes a really nice warm water port . 
  bih has nothing like that . 
  it 's better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it . 
  also , russia has ways of liberating places without a traditional invasion . 
  to make sure that nobody * liberates * it in the future . 
  the last piece of the north mediterranean coastline . 
  a lot of stuff gets downvoted . 
  sometimes the same topics get different vote totals depending on the time of day . 
  you should n't take it too seriously . 
  the way i approach reddit is : when i see something that may be interesting on a certain sub , i throw it at the wall and see if it sticks . 
  if it does , great !, 
  there may be an interesting discussion on an interesting topic . 
  if it gets downvoted , too bad . 
  but it cost me all of a few seconds . 
  big deal . 
  valentine 's day with you must be really miserable . 
  this may be a generational thing , but i find the idea put forward in the article to be absurd . 
  good . 
  this should deprive some of the balkan traffickers of one of their revenue streams . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.cartoonmovement.com/depot/cartoons/2014/11/27/putin_and_marine_le_pen__marian_kamensky.jpeg ), 
  it 's clear that plane crashes get more attention because you have the casualties concentrated in a single incident compared to road crashes where the casualties are more fragmented over time . 
  the question is whether this disparity makes sense . 
  does it provide a benefit , do harm or neither ? 
  which of my comments makes me a stormfronter ?
