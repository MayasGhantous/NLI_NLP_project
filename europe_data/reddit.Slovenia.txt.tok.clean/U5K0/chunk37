  just ... no . 
  kindly crawl back to whichever spider hole you emerged from to begin with . 
  not really . 
  do you like reading your own comments ? 
  more referring to the book than the article : pinker makes the point that violence is the result of a number of dynamics which can be either eliminated or mitigated . 
  in the case of armed conflict between major powers , the principle mitigating factors are : * international trade which eliminates war as the cheapest mode of acquisition of resources , goods and services * a democratic system of government which places power in the hands of the very people who suffer most from war ( compared to royal families or some inner party elite ) * an international diplomatic infrastructure which provides alternate avenues for conflict resolution, 
  i did n't mean that it was the right and wrong interpretation of islam . 
  i meant that having the death penalty for apostates is wrong in general . 
  i take exception to that . 
  i 'm hardly a stormfront-er . 
  what a terrible waste of fuel . 
  that 's sort of the point . 
  placing restrictions on people on one side ( and only one side ) of a debate because the people on the other side are disruptive is n't really a good idea . 
  okrent 's law : * the pursuit of balance can create imbalance because sometimes something is true . 
  pragmatic or not , they should n't place restrictions on one side of an issue - in this case the right side - which are n't placed on the other side - the wrong one . 
  while i see this as legitimately concerning , i think you may be blowing it out of proportion somewhat . 
  the word moral only appears once in the article . 
  at the very beginning . 
  regarding the famines and other indicators of altruism , they 're addressed in the book rather extensively . 
  you can only squeeze so much into an op-ed . 
   but it caused a huge rift . 
  no it did n't . 
  it just faded into nothingness . 
  this, 
  to hell with morality . 
  progress is progress . 
  if anything , there 's far too much morality in the world . 
   completely ignoring the fact that any superpower is n't jumping to go to war with another there are actually fewer and fewer medium sized and small wars as well . 
  same goes for murder . 
  edit : may not be in the article , but it 's in the book, 
  this from the people who build walls to keep water out of the ocean . 
  do i need to remind you of the fact that a wall does n't protect you in a war of ideas ? 
  so we should just raise our hands and accept that ? 
  minds are what we 're fighting over in this struggle . 
  we 're in a far stronger position than the bronze age fetishists when it comes to ideas . 
  having said that , our advantage will count for nothing if we effect a retreat and build a wall as we run . 
  why should we compromise with these minuscule pests ? 
  i do n't see why they should be granted their own private * terra pericolosa * to rule over . 
  we 're talking about cognitive throwbacks . 
  relics of a bygone age who 's world view has no chance in the 21st century . 
  in the wake of the tragedy in tunis , my thought was that civilised people have to stick together on this issue - all cca . 
  7 billion of us . 
  the idea that we could or should leave part of the world behind to be savaged by wolves is nothing less than sickening . 
  there was a comment here earlier which got deleted . 
  i think it deserves a clear response in spite of the deletion . 
   cant we just divide the earth , build a huge wall in the middle ? 
  one side is not-muslim-land with science , technology , steaks , girls in bikinis and beer . 
  the other side is muslim-land , with living in the middle-ages , blowing yourself up and having sex with goats . 
  that would mean surrendering a billion + human brains to an insignificant number of moronic loosers . 
  we win , they loose . 
  that 's how this ends . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/m5qgkogzubq ), 
  it 's actually worse than it sounds . 
  read the article . 
  no it 's not !, 
  just look at how much of the eu budget goes from the richer areas to the poorer ones . 
  look at how much has been put on the line to help the states hardest hit by the debt crisis . 
  on a personal note , [ when slovenia 's power grid was decimated ] ( http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/ecdm_20140203_slovenia_severeweather.pdf ) by ice rain last year , we got a lot of critical help via the eu civil defence mechanism . 
  you have no idea how much of a difference it made . 
  whenever i begin to feel that way i just remember schuman :  europe will not be made all at once , or according to a single plan . 
  it will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity . 
  it sounds more poetic in the original french . 
  what is it with czech presidents ? 
  we all have * that * party . 
  in some countries they even get into parliament . 
  that does n't mean they represent the country .

  ** the better angels of our nature : why violence has declined ** - steven pinker https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_better_angels_of_our_nature spoiler : kant was right in [ perpetual peace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perpetual_peace:_a_philosophical_sketch ) , hobbes was right in [ leviathan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leviathan ) , angell was right in [ the great illusion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_great_illusion ) and pinker thinks the future will probably be bright and shiny , but maybe not, 
  sales . 
  magazines like sales . 
  talk about * the right stuff * . 
  it 's a bad thing that we have an entire genre of those , right ? 
  one more question : do you have any black sea ports with oppressed minorities ? 
  gib north cyprus, 
  i like [ this one . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/prhmh7tnirc?t=1m ) they really make it escalate . 
  the voldemort of reddit, 
  hard to say . 
  it just kinda snuk up on me . 
  the big science projects were a big deal for me . 
  i always felt that they were * ours * . 
  the higgs discovery , rosetta , the titan landing , goce looked really cool , gmes aka copernicus , e-elt groundbreaking , iter , i could go on . 
  it 's historically spanish clay anyway . 
  i blame the french naval build-up . 
  they say it for sale to russia , but this is a threat to vital spanish national security interests . 
  what would ukip do for a logo at that point ? 
  nor sure if i agree with you there , but i will say that points 1 and 3 are just stuffing . 
  these two things really go without saying , do n't they ? 
  in case people other than me are interested in their position on the eu : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pirate_party_ ( iceland ) #european _ union, 
  i do n't think apprehension means what you think it does . 
  i guess you could also look at krugman , stieglitz and soros all of whom go beyond draghi . 
  he 's actually very much in the middle mixing and matching parts of both . 
  you can use a welder 's mask . 
  the buba comes to mind . 
  the ecb has been pushing for a mix of reform and stimulus . 
  had draghi gotten his way earlier , we would be in a much better position now . 
  yes, 
  tha\u0165s beside the point . 
  this could be a cartoon and would still serve as a succinct summation of my opinion of the people protesting today . 
  honestly , even the fact that they 're burning cars is n't the main problem .
