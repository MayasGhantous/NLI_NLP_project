  well , i suppose if you 're completely blind , you 're technically colorblind as well . 
  the sanctions are working !, 
  i 'll show myself out . 
  we already have one . 
  it currently sends tents and food to refugee camps , coordinates aspects international communication and transportation , facilitates mediation on all sorts of issues , organises disease monitoring , prevention etc. ... [ the un does a lot of stuff ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_specialized_agencies_of_the_united_nations ), 
  at least half od those are jokes . 
  what was the reaction ? 
  sounds like an interesting idea . 
  i wonder if it would n't also be a good idea to have something similar for opinion pieces . 
  you should post this n / r/europics, 
   as much an exploration of failed opportunities as it is an account of how we created yet another crisis in european international politics i agree with you that the blame could hardly be placed on our doorstep . 
  however , the other point is valid in my view . 
  the modernisation of russia and its meningful integration into the european framework did n't occur in the 90s for a number of reasons . 
  had this occurred , the current conflict would n't exist . 
  it may be a banal and obvious point , but an important one to establish and learn from because there will be another opportunity to do this at some moment in the future . 
  we need to be ready for it to the extent we can be . 
  i had n't realised you could do that . 
  til , thanks . 
  how did you find this so long after the posting ? 
  i think the key concept here is * `` par des r\u00e9alisations concr\u00e8tes '' . 
  * i 've always thought that a common blue water navy would be a a good place to start . 
  let 's face it , none of us can afford our own carrier groups . 
  i 'm aware that the following may erode my credibility somewhat , but hey , there 's always a chance : [ what if the world really did have a peacekeeping and humanitarian armada ? 
  ] ( http://onthegrippinghand.blogspot.com/2009/08/peacekeeping-and-humanitarian-armada.html ), 
  did it with bacon reader . 
  it does n't give that option . 
  ... and the eu is part of humanity . 
  if we 're making things unnecessarily vague , why not go all the way ? 
   some eu state governments do n't want the european union to enforce net neutrality ftfy, 
  we 've been trying for a while . 
  these cats are n't that easy to reintroduce . 
   neo-bolsheviks are a minority , thankfully . 
  not to mention demographically receding . 
  it 's not so much the left in general . 
  it 's the post-communist left who 's prime concern is supporting the latest ** champion of anti-americanism no matter who it happens to be . 
  ** the normal social democratic left and even the new radical left do n't seem to have this problem . 
  they might say that money should be spent on welfare as opposed to the army , but they do n't actually mobilise in hysterical , blind support of the kremlin . 
  * insert broomstick joke here *, 
   i am not ~ ~ the ~ ~ an eu president . 
  ftfy, 
  which textbooks ? 
  if you put them in the same chapter ( criticism of religion or something like it ) with other religious cartoons it makes all the sense in the world . 
  doing it just to make a point would be a bad idea though . 
  birds of a feather , i guess, 
  vote for the pirates . 
  the best lobbyist is an mep . 
  best to [ process them ] ( http://youtu.be/jo1tfsmfvw4?t=16s ) before return - just to make sure . 
  well , it certainly worked on me . 
  i did n't write it ... should 've put tht in there though . 
  observe for a while to get an idea of the situation . 
  get my hands on fertiliser and diesel . 
  start damaging soft infrastructure targets . 
  essentially make the country more trouble than it 's worth . 
  [ it would n't be the first time . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovene_partisans ), 
  perhaps they enjoy the risks associated with a bathtub . 
  they 're all just a bunch of posers . 
  i bet not a single one of them has an improvised gas chamber in their basement . 
  damn lazy hypocrites . 
  they 're as much the enemy as the mixed-breeds . 
  ( if you need me to put an / s here , you 're a very sick puppy ), 
  you forgot to ad `` energy union '' to the title . 
  i love that last sentence . 
  it 's a thing of beauty . 
   smc ( party of miro cerar ) - for it 's the ** party of the modern centre **, 
  how are you going ? 
  that 's far from clear at this point . 
  are you scandinavian or just a masochist ? 
  the former yugoslav countries think slovenians are gay . 
  do n't really get it myself . 
  only learned of the idea recently . 
  the funny thing is that only about 45 kids get adopted in this country every year . 
  not by gays , total . 
  next on rt : sport and weather . 
  it 's not much of an iron curtain given that people could cross it as * easily * as any other normal border, 
  depends which side you 're looking from . 
   eu never tried to crush my national identity . 
  where should i fill in my official complain ? 
  yea , that caught my eye as well . 
  my country has about 1000 years of that under its belt , so we 're quite familiar with a number of versions of it . 
  i 'm not seeing it . 
  maybe we just have n't unlocked that level yet . 
  i 'll make sure you get double rations when i have you shipped off to [ concordia camp . 
  ] ( http://www.institut-polaire.fr/var/plain/storage/images/ipev/galerie/antarctique/base_concordia_dome_c__1/concordia/18504-1-fre-fr/concordia.jpg ) i ca n't have free thinkers walking the streets of $ ur0pa while i organise barbarosa ii - nuclear boogaloo . 
  i 'm a bit tired , so please forgive the stupid comment : if roaming charges remain , putin wins . 
  checkmate . 
  you 're just grumpy because your flag is a negative version of switzerland 's . 
  yurop do n't need no spetsnaz . 
  we 've got fifth column in every country on the planet . 
  out of curiosity , does anyone know how much a division costs to form and then maintain in operating condition ? 
  also , where will they be diverting resources from to finance this ? 
  this is what happens when you 're so far away from yurop . 
  stupid pacific fish . 
  this may not be the case here , but in our language the phrase `` no culture '' , when applied to individuals , is equivalent to saying that someone lacks manners or a sense of responsibility to others , the environment ( littering ) etc. 
  i 'll take that bet !, 
  commissioner bulc has stated that she would make rail her priority . 
  hopefully that helps improve the situation in the medium term . 
  yea , i 'll wait for the official text to be published . 
  not to mention the service area jokes . 
  whatever .
