  you leave the eu -  you no longer have regional funds . 
  immigration from pakistan might be a great argument for leaving the commonwealth . 
  not sure what it has to do with the eu . 
  these people are adults . 
  as such , it 's reasonable for me to have certain expectations regarding their conduct . 
  one of these reasonable expectations is that they make rational decisions when the stakes are high . 
  instead , they voted to cut off their nose in order to spite their face - because they felt angry . 
  which brings us to another feature of adulthood : having to live with the consequences of your actions . 
  bon chance !, 
  what was the price per million btu ? 
  long overdue , but a massive step in the right direction nonetheless . 
  it covers it quite clearly : none of the alternatives have been able to match russian gas prices . 
  in case anyone 's interested in ng prices over time : http://www.eegas.com/price_chart.htm, 
  you can also get it at valter 's in kamnik . 
  you really do n't need a pipeline for oil , just an oil terminal at a port, 
  triggered, 
  i do n't get it . 
  the fact that things could have gone worse , does n't make the actual course of history good , just less bad . 
  they were not as bad as the nazis . 
  the tragedy is that there were many very noble elements to that movement which are now forever connected to mass attrocities . 
  there was no need for this . 
  this is good . 
  this is good . 
  they might be interested in paying for advanced weaponry that 's been under a us promoted embargo for a while now . 
  that would go a long way toward covering costs . 
  ppp has to do with price levels , not population size obviously we 're talking about per capita ... overall absolute gdp is a fairly useless number, 
  credit cards are just financially unjustified for regular daily expences . 
  these are thansactions which are far better served by a debit card based service . 
  or are you saying that austrians are cash fanatics ? 
  i really do n't see google streetview as a threat to my privacy in any way that matters . 
  call it what it is , a default .

  front ex needs a motto . 
  i suggest * revertere ad mittentis *, 
  holy shit , that 's weird coming from a serb . 
  thanks , neighbor . 
  as long as it 's not yugo . 
  the important number is 4 % yoy . 
  the monthly charts are always insane . 
  ps . . good for you , neighbour !, 
  you forgot the report by the anti-corruption commission exposing the pm 's misterious cash purchases and realestate deals on the right , and the ljubljana mayor 's cyprus based shell companies on the left . 
  that 's how things spread beyond maribor . 
  the same happened here during the 2012/13 protests . 
  when the protesters and the police start to work together like this , the politicos get really nervous . 
  this is a fight that never ends . 
  having a human system is like having a leaky boat . 
  you just have to pump the water out faster than it can get in . 
  and you have to do it forever . 
  the war on corruption is never won or lost . 
  it 's an everlasting struggle . 
  seems a bit selective . 
  you could just as easily compare denmark to germany or the uk to the netherlands . 
  suck it , britanija !, 
  not if you 're from slovenia and know someone with a flat on the croatian coast . 
  ( this applies to just about all of us . ),

   though our results are getting worse : / are they ? 
  i have n't seen the report , but the media coverage was completely positive when it came out . 
  he does look like the bad guy from the hunger games . 
  on the other hand , this is exactly what an opposition is for ; pointing out when the government is dojng badly . 
  i 'm not sure what we 're left with if criticism from the opposition counts for nothing . 
  should we wait until it gets so bad that the ruling party begin attacking each other ? 
  agro production is strategic . 
  agro jobs are not . 
  you have been banned from / r/slovenia, 
  in defiance of both god and nature good job !, 
  what does nato have to do with * indigenous products * ? 
  it 's turned into a purely transactional relationship . 
  i guess you can say that an alliance is more than that , and so this is n't an alliance anymore . 
  my point is that it 's a deterioration , but not a dramatic one . 
  that 's the impression i got from the report our evening news did on the topic . 
  they interviewed one of the scientists who 's been part of the collaboration and he said that this would make the financial and organisational aspect of the work easier . 
  i could go and find a link to the segment , though there 's a chance it may be geo-blocked . 
  for all i know it might be inaccurate , but i was n't the one who made it up , 
  for scientists from memeber states , they do . 
  for others , things get complicated . 
  also , slovenian companies can now compete for cern contracts , which is a huge get for the tech sector here . 
  cern is a world class reference that ca open the door to a lot of deals . 
  there 's been quite a lot of participation in the atlas experiment already , but it was all on an ad hoc basis . 
  scientists would have to seek funding from national sources for everything they did and coordinate access with cern . 
  they would waste a lot of time on administration which will now be streamlined under this agreement . 
  when isis holds pride parades in mosul , i 'll be ok with eating their chocolates as well . 
  it 's mostly rfid cards nowadays . 
  as long as inflation remains low , who cares ? 
  a persian cat ? 
   the country should be spending more on something specific or ... 
  this really bothers me . 
  you ca n't make these sort of juvenile pronouncements and be taken seriously . 
  there 's no such thing as the right amount of spending . 
  there 's good spending and bad spending . 
  if the public and the country get value for their money , it should be spent . 
  if not , it should n't be . 
  the amount is a secondary issue . 
  well , when you 've got a developed economy , low inflation and flat demographics , it 's difficult to expect 6 % + . 
  we had that pre-crisis , but a lot of it was a real estate bubble and most of it was fuelled by unsustainable debt in one form or another . 
  let 's look at what the amendment actually says , ok ? 
   `` water resources represent a public good that is managed by the state . 
  water resources are primary and durably used to supply citizens with potable water and households with water and , in this sense , are not a market commodity , '' so , we 're essentially saying that you ca n't let the free market compromise a sustainable water supply for people and households , that this basic supply is provided by the state - in our case : not-for profit utility companies owned by local government . 
  it also exempts water services from the normal prohibition of state aid ( in the eu , public funds ca n't be given to private industry because it would distort the market ) . 
  as a matter of practical reality , nothing changes .
