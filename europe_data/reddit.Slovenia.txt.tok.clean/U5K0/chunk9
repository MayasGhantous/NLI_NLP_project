  do n't see a contradiction here . 
  esa is only as strong as the space sector in its members and it would probably be a bad idea to try and coordinate all of it centrally at this point . 
  this is stupid . 
   china is communist and the dprk is democratic  the state ought to be putting the interests of workers and peasants first . 
  it ought to be, 
  also , the lack of competition from the rest of the world . 
  we need strong unions in china , india and africa , not stronger unions in europe .

   jew-nazis well done , sir . 
  well done . 
  terribly sorry about him . 
  no idea how he managed to get out . 
  clearly , we need a stronger lock . 
  pessimistic , cynical and intitelled . 
  the ecb is looking for some place to dump massive amounts of cash without causing a bubble . 
  i suggest [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compact_linear_collider ), 
  it does . 
  categorise religious organisations as companies . 
  did you forget to use a comma or was it intentional ? 
  censorship is censorship if it stops free expression . 
  where it comes from is irrelevant to the consequences and therefore academic . 
  censorship being abused by the rich and powerful . 
  i 'm shocked !, 
  unresolved conflicts , especially with neighbours , cost money . 
  i 'm sure they could , d find a better way to spend it . 
  unless there 's a teleporter under the kremlin this may prove to be a logistical challenge . 
  i 'm not turkish , but i 'm going to push my opinion anyway . 
  i think we should just focus on the step directly ahead of us . 
  currently this is a resolution of the cyprus situation . 
  this is clearly in everyone 's interest . 
  let 's get that done and see where we can go from there . 
  i 'm not really convinced that russia is subject to sufficient fundamental pressure in the direction of democratisation which would overpower the existing tendency toward a certain level of authoritarianism . 
  here 's why : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he6rsljtwdu 91 ' may have been a unique window, 
  russia is not a transnational country . 
  the transition failed . 
  the question is when there might be another transition if ever . 
  that 's the the sad irony . 
  if russia had rule of law , an open economy and effective democratic government , it would easily be among the most successful countries in the world - it has insanely great fundamentals for development . 
  this may be a long shot , but i think there would be plenty of interest in the west to make it a nato member - because china is scary . 
  the yeltsin years were a wasted opportunity which will not come again for a very long time , if ever . 
  you should look at the article . 
  there 's a number of ironic section headers as well, 
  i tried posting this in / r/nottheonion , but they [ do n't accept rt links . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/29kxuw/everyone_has_right_to_be_different_top_10/cilw4y9 ) thought you may all get a laugh out of it . 
  not so long as you 're around , buddy, 
  they 're clearly deficient . 
  at the very least there should be the same restrictions on guns as there are on cars . 
  personally i think you should need a good reason to have a gun ( so more strict that the above ) , but that really only applies for where i live . 
  you do what you want . 
  yes , but you have yet to be solidly anchored in the western camp via an association agreement with the eu . 
  first football , then an aa , and if you 're successful with your reforms , one day you may get candidate status . 
  there 's more context and an institutional angle in this guardian article http://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2014/jun/23/evidence-based-union-a-new-alliance-for-science-advice-in-europe, 
  so , do you have tierra-bytes in spain ? 
  it was n't just generic serbs . 
  it was the dominant political party in republika srbska , which owes its existence to secterian distrust and ethnic disintegration in bih . 
  without this and the dayton framework which is based on the above , there 's a good chance they would lose their comfortable positions . 
  we do n't think of you nearly as much as some people seem to think we think of you . 
  then we can sign an association agreement and surround russia from the east as well . 
  it 's all falling into place . 
  again , this is / r/europe i do n't give a flying fuck about chaney, 
  calm down . 
  this is n't the a youtube comment section . 
  this is essentially a copy/paste of what already exists in the area of civil defence . 
  the latter has been very helpful so far . 
  the really ugly secterian aspects of the early national movement for a unified slovenia are not mentioned . 
  also , maister took maribor using poetry and will power . 
  thanks , junker !, 
  yes . 
  i did n't really know what to make of that at the time . 
  i was still completely convinced that he was an ideological vacuum . 
  like the article says , it will be looking for gas . 
  interestingly , the pipeline will still go through ukraine . 
  i used to think the guy was a cynical pragmatist . 
  i 'm not so sure any more . 
  how likely is it that he may believe parts of his own propaganda ? 
  [ yay !, 
  ] ( http://www.juzaphoto.com/shared_files/uploads/757043.jpg ), 
  how dare you mock eurovision ? 
  i 'm sorry , but the images you 've provided as a starting point for the discussion are an insult to the human intellect . 
  this is the sort of thing that would be appropriate as a joke on r/yurop or r/murica , but to present them as a serious argument is nothing short of pathetic . 
  an appropriate place to start the discussion would be something like gdp , hdi , life expectancy , infant mortality , literacy , gini , violent crime , corruption rates , level of trust in societal institutions , unplanned parenthood rates , etc. 
  what are the other arms ? 
  this reminds me of the old communist argument that the problems happen because we 're not communist enough . 
  i believe it 's called * no true scotsman *, 
  ron paul 2012 !, 
  i 'm not that plugged in regarding this . 
  could you expand on the above comment ? 
  in the name of not being sheep , let 's turn every fist fight into a shootout . 
  how many people should die so that you can feel big and strong ? 
  relevant http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isdl86usgzc, 
  it 's also slovenia 's national day , a celebration of our secession form yugoslavia . 
  pan-slavism has n't been doing too well for a while now . 
  come to think of it , what would we be uniting around anyway ? 
  there just is n't much there there , is there ? 
  the 2nd is a plague, 
  we must keep to [ the prophecy  ( http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/european_hegemony )  ** the european hegemony ** was a somewhat loose alliance in the european region on earth formed in the early 22nd century . 
  jean-luc picard described the hegemony as one of the first steps toward a united earth government , which was founded in 2150 . 
  yes , it 's horrible ... we 're not copying the usa constitutional framework . 
  we do n't need to cause confusion by using a derivative name . 
  is n't the eu the biggest exporter in pretty much every category ?
