let me guess . 
  no twitter or facebook ? 
  so every sunday your nerves are being torchered ? 
  yes . 
  any . 
  he 's to lazy . 
  i 'm sitting with the macedon guy . 
  you did n't hear about slovenian highway from maribor to ljubljana , have you ? 
  to the visoko piramid of course :d, 
  you can count on us to !, 
  hi there !, 
  [ the slovenian defense minister ] ( http://www.delo.si/assets/media/picture/20150422/670x420_2_stran__djvu_1047053_mdr_l_hires.jpeg0.jpeg?rev=0 ), 
  abomination, 
  the higher it is , the better !, 
  it 's comical . 
  maybe in luka koper . 
  you have to have a goverment first , 
  nova24tv , dru\u017eina , demokracija , politikis , reporter , 24kul ? 
  yea . 
  it does n't work like that . 
  as you would surely know . 
  can confirm, 
  and it did . 
  probably, 
  this should be higher up, 
  excellent, 
  exactly, 
  say that to the constitutional court, 
  i could the first one, 
  god bless !, 
  i 'm very confident of my knowledge ( ok ... maybe 90 % in africa and some small caribbean islands ), 
  the people did n't vote against marriage then . 
  they voted because they thought ( falsely , they were manipulated and scaremongered ) the gays will take the children and whatnot . 
  open a geography textbook, 
  i was just kidding  but still i ca n't hear the difference nor understand either of them . 
  the only difference i can see is latinica/cirilica . 
  why are there two circles ? 
  it should be combined . 
  they sound the same . 
  here you go croatia . 
  there 's this for teran and piran !, 
  even grammaticaly that would n't make any sense, 
  get the torches and pitchforks !, 
  about time, 
  sorry , i read the wrong - est city : s, 
  o crap . 
  this is just a troll ... right ? 
  right ? 
  e. . . northern ireland ? 
  i see slovenia in the first one < 3, 
  the rang zvon 1 & 2, 
  i 'd rather not know what would happen here ... 
  and teran . 
  and piran . 
  and kranjska : /, 
  i could see that to be true for slovenia, 
  great map . 
  but the dinarske alps are not touching the alps they end way more south, 
  daenerys targeryan has burnt meereen after leaving apparently . 
  slovenia next year, 
  very good docu . 
  it tackles everything . 
  i know . 
  but at the time those things happened , it was a fact . 
  quite a few had weapons and they used them too.but some did struck the same deal as did general l\u00f6hr ( officers and every 10 ( - ish !!! ), 
  soldier can/could keep them ) in topol\u0161\u010dica ( some km to the south ) for the e-group . 
  em ... the british handed them over to the partisans/jugoslav army . 
  the brits had some miscommunication ( klagenfurt-bleiburg ) as they should hand over only noncivilian personel from the quizling formations . 
  either way they probably knew what would happen to those sent back . 
  and when that moment came , they would n't put down the weapons and hell broke loose . 
  looks like a fractal ^ fractal ^ fractal ^ fractal ^ fractal ^ fractal ^ fractal ^ fractal ^ fractal, 
  the french one is the winner imo, 
  the most northern red part ( \u010cakovec ) and the most west part ( istra ) were formaly inhabited mostly by slovenians . 
  but then things happened . 
  great pic !, 
  i 'm glad you did n't die in flip-flops there !, 
  this is quite a statement to voice . 
  love the style the church is built in, 
  spain ? 
  very modern looking, 
  the first one is awsome !, 
  drinking and sauna ? 
  maybe troll hunting ? 
  what do you do all winter ? 
  how 's the internet speed ? 
  sadly uncommon, 
  honey + bread + ( butter ), 
  can also confirm . 
  the key is 30 + years lost, 
  those official things ( proslave ) are so cringe packed it hurts . 
  it 's such bullshit . 
  coffee, 
  i agree, 
  absolutely, 
  what is plazma ? 
  probably not blood plazma ... right ? 
  exactly, 
  oh yes . 
  you have two extremes here . 
  you have the shity ones open at 3am on friday and you have gorgeous burger joints .
