  it 's a good tldr of us . 
  some politicians need an eternal enemy , so they can give excuses for their lack of ideas . 
  we have a economic problem ? 
  `` it 's the communist and secret communist police '' it 's their argument for fucking everything . 
  power shortage ? 
  communists . 
  bad weather ? 
  communists . 
  traffic jam ? 
  communists !, 
  and so on and so on ... ( grabs nose ), 
  epic name :d, 
  we might be small but we can be laud . 
  such ignorance ... 
  for the bosnian refugees in the nineties was slovenia quite ok . 
  some still see communism behind the every tree and gather political points for `` finding them '' . 
  because 1/5 of austrians were slovene in past . 
  i always thought that the inspiration for out bureaucracy was the spanish inquisition . 
  in search for u/spomladi, 
  yes . 
  horrible people . 
  they do n't have a [ prince of darkness ] ( http://cdn.kme.si/public/images-cache/750xx/2015/10/15/c5b34383841843db10d59dda76699c45/57f23e5075224/c5b34383841843db10d59dda76699c45.jpeg ) , khm ... i mean [ the primc ] ( http://siol.net/media/img/19/32/3e4daa43485075b42a42.jpeg ), 
  he is and he does, 
  every other week or so . 
  and the right fights between itself ( sds vs. nsi ) and that radicalises the first and weakens the other . 
  but the real extreme right is god ( gibanje za otroke in dru\u017eine ) . 
  what was their reaction when you touched the goverment issue ? 
  absolutely not . 
  just of some of my fellow citizens . 
  bravo, 
  legitimate , but overused . 
  a wild croatia appeared . 
  are you ? 
  so many tulips . 
  and windmills . 
  and land that will disappear when global warming really kicks in . 
  terrible . 
  seeing poland become europes pakistan . 
  that 's a running morbid joke in slovenia . 
  the news : `` a hiker died climbing xyz mountain . '', 
  our reaction : '' probably czech ... maybe slovak . '', 
  yes . 
  if it would cover white dental fillings it would be near perfect !, 
  that 's brutal . 
  my condolences . 
  is going into the eu a popular option ? 
  that is , to live there . 
  bonus person : metod trobec ( za metoda gori\u0161 oooo bejbi ), 
  leon rupnik and bishop ro\u017eman : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p-noqqpbg0, 
  can you get in truble if you write these things ? 
  the real scary part are the people who vote trump . 
  look up iter . 
  it 's a huge european project !, 
  now i see the irony . 
  a modest homophobic narrative sprinkled with an ideological twist ... 
  really ? 
  ca n't picture that ... hdz probably would n't approve , 
  for some people it was great . 
  if you were in kpj , you were well of . 
  yeah . 
  my mum got a few billion dinars for her paycheck . 
  i would n't say `` better '' , i would say less harsh . 
  for most people it was nothing really dramatical , but for some ... google goli otok prison camp and you 'll see the harshness . 
  keep in mind that highest oppression level was until around 48 ' -49 ' ( tito stalin split ), 
  and flancati and trojanski krofi . 
  nom nom nom . 
  exactly . 
  not everyone knows that . 
  it 's still interesting what a pre\u0161eren bank note would buy you . 
  more than 5 $ now . 
  and a loaf of bread was 120 tolarjev . 
  the prices went up and up and up . 
  well ... in modern times 90 ' onward it would be, 
  it 's germany . 
  `` giving up sovereignty '' e. . . it does not work that way . 
  the biggest benefit i see , is that eu gives cash for rural development . 
  as a result of this we see many many new buildings , renovations of squares and footpaths and so on . 
  but the acces to the european market is the biggest + . 
  the biggest - ( by far ) is the burocracy . 
  ( it 's like something out of a kafka novel . ), 
  is it ? 
  i keep track and the average ( for ~ 3 years ) is about 50 $ . 
  not super luxory , but not ramen noodles every other day . 
  i forgot to add , that i get some things from the garden . 
  in most cases the companies who take care of water are either private or are subject of the town/municipality . 
  but the companies are also in charge for trash towing and funerals and various land works ( mowing grass , picking up trash and such ) . i can say we pay around 35 $ per household per month . 
  but it varies . 
  do n't think we have much pipes with lead in them . 
  and if there are , they are in older houses , newer pipes are out of plastic or some cind of bronze ( not sure , but 100 % no poisioning as far as i remember ) . 
  oh and almost none of the water suply is chlorated . 
  all fresh from the ground . 
  both . 
  but no bottled water . 
  we drink water out of the pipes . 
  we buy it only when we are going somewhere . 
  and even then we might fill it with tap water . 
  around 50 $ per person per week . 
  same shit is happening in slovenia, 
  the rise of the extreme right and the passive left majority . 
  we all saw what happened last time .
