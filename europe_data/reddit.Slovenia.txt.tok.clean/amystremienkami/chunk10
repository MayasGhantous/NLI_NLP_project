  some people just need to critize everything . 
  nothing is good enough . 
  in my school we collected [ stickers 1 ] ( https://s4.mojalbum.com/17402364_18058886_23424366/lic-nov-16/nalepke-4.jpg ) , [ stickers 2 ] ( https://s4.mojalbum.com/17402364_18058886_23424369/lic-nov-16/nalepke-7.jpg ) and had an entire albums of them . 
  more special they were more you were admired . 
  kelly family were one of the biggest concerts in the history of slovenia . 
  every young girl had their t-shirt and/or other products . 
  yes , you can ski there . 
  here ? 
  i know a few vegans . 
  vegan products are not so hard to get since they are available in local supermarkets ( hofer , dm , muller ... ) . 
  every year there are more vegan restaurants or at least restaurants which also offer vegan dishes . 
  nope . 
  differences in gdps are too big also i do n't really feel connected with kosovo or macedonia . 
  yes . 
  you can easily confuse us with some countries . 
  yes . 
  people go to nyc or rent a car and visit national parks . 
  yes , i live very close to church . 
  it bothers me on easter morning when it 's ringing all the time and louder than usual . 
  my region - [ upper carniola ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=gorenjska+kme%c4%8dka+hi%c5%a1a&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjx3stnlo_tahwqjzokhws2c1iq_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=589 ), 
  butter , bread and honey . 
  i think that is also true for slovenia . 
  we were part from hre from beginning and then we were in habsburg monarchy and only the last 100 years we are not under germans or austrians . 
  im not sure if i remember this from slovenia 's programme or from the sattelite ones that we had from germany . 
  oh it 's the [ haribo guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9yuoup44rc ) . 
  you do n't forget this kind of haircut . 
  i did n't know that our very long long long coastline is so influential . 
  most [ tractors ] ( http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/agriculture/agricultural-machinery/tractors/per-capita ) per capita, 
  nope . 
  he reminds me of [ him ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8kv-kdy0ds ), 
  it 's not that popular as they are ski jumping and alpine skiing but i would n't say that only people that enjoy the sport are commentators . 
  one of the stops on the tour is pokljuka . 
  also biathlon events are regularly broadcasted live on national tv so i would say there is some interest for it . 
  sailor moon . 
  i watched that on german rtl ii and eventhough i did n't understand everything i loved it . 
  [ toma\u017e pengov - v nasmehu nekega dneva ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejgamilo0ny ) slovenian nick drake . 
  his songs are a bit sad and beautiful . 
  i was there in 2002 . 
  only if they are a couple or if they congratulate each other for a birthday . 
  some girls do but only when they are good friends . 
  i think that both of my hosts ( man and woman ) kissed me and they met me first time . 
  i was never farer than turkey . 
  so my answer would be turkey . 
  things that seemed different to me ( i was 12 at that time ) : they kiss you on the cheeks when they meet you , traffic is crazy , nothing happens on time , amount of women and girls in veils , prices for things on bazaars can always be lower than listed . 
  she is great . 
  i like it much more when she sings in german . 
  [ sigur r\u00f3s -- hopp\u00edpolla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mztb8wxew78 ) [ azra - volim te kad pri\u010da\u0161 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=181owl2woig ) [ repetitor - ja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlc5bvcunxs ) [ fran\u00e7oise hardy - le temps de l'amour ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhmy7irndx8 ) [ soap & skin - vater ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdjxkww_h1w ) [ tocotronic - meine freundin und ihr freund ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qdshbux8z8 ), 
  we have them too . 
  i know i never managed to eat just one per day . 
  mostly i am satisfied with women 's rights in slovenia but i heard that some job seekers discrimnate young women because they think they will get pregnant also i heard that they do n't like women with younger children because they think they will always be on a sick leave . 
  now i 'm not sure how much this really happens and if it does i would like to see feminists to advocate more for that and not for quotas . 
  ri\u010det and \u017eganci . 
  very traditional also in slovenia . 
  i like them both . 
  we also have some sinti in upper carniola . 
  they mostly do n't cause bigger problems also some of them even work . 
  different story is with roma people . 
  when i was in vienna i visited some of the places where [ before sunrise ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112471/?ref_=tt_rec_tt ) was filmed .

  please write in understandable languague . 
  ok so your only acceptable way of travelling is : only with train and from ljubljana airport . 
  no wonder it 's impossible for you with 100000 limitations and prejudices . 
  how will you explain existance of prevoz.org ? 
  why not fly from trieste if it is only few kilometers from our border ? 
  yes i have traveled more than 12 hours with bus it is unconfortable but if you get somewhere for a low price it is worth it . 
  from ljubljana to trieste it 's only 2 hours with bus and not 12 . 
  trains are great i agree and it 's a shame that there are no real connections between us and italy . 
  i use car sharing on regular basis and i never really had a real problem . 
  but as i said there are buses to italy and if you want to get there it 's not so impossible to get there and fly from it . 
  lots of slovenians do it very often . 
  train is not the only transport that can get you somewhere . 
  there several buses to trieste and venice also there is car sharing and goopti . 
  every two weeks . 
  i like it . 
  [ my little village in upper carniola ] ( http://imgur.com/a/aif8m ) [ another one ] ( http://imgur.com/a/zvxpa ), 
  i live 4,5 km ( air distance ) from austria . 
  i do n't cross it that often since there is a mountain range between the countries . 
  i do n't live that far from italy either ( 35 km ) . 
  language : slovenian moon : evropa continent : evropa,

  lovely movie !, 
  i love the visual style of this movie , dialogues and music !, 
  my boyfriend is from croatia . 
  luckily the distance is not too big ( around 200 km ) so we manage to see each other quite often . 
  slovenia is a democratic republic . 
  my croatian friends always laugh when i say that name . 
  in their language is venecija . 
  i 'm glad we are not the only one !,
