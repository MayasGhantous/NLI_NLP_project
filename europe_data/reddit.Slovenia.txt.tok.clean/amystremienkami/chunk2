  for primary education we have waldorf primary school , montessori private school and catholic primary school . 
  for secondary we have : 4 catholic gymnasiums , waldorf gymnasium and so called euro school . 
  and after [ this  ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aotdbbolvz0/tutav-hq55i/aaaaaaaaaky/vgpmeys-ky0/s1600/eurotrip_bratislava.jpg ) sadly :(, 
  i normally do n't want to inform them that we were part of yugoslavia because then the first things on their mind are : oh yes eastern europe ( boring , socialism , russia , war ... ) . 
  someone on tripadvisor commented : i travel around the world and to my great surprise this was the best country and trip i have ever had . 
  amazed !, 
  wonderful country . 
  grand country . 
  safe . 
  modern . 
  drive on same side of the road as usa !, 
  major major historic and whose history has been preserved and not bombed out during wars . 
  awesome awesome country . 
  who would have thought it ? ... 
  we call it \u0161nops . 
  +1 they have also lots of indie/alternative concerts . 
  vienna also have a special place in my heart because i started to date my boyfriend there . 
  we also need to rescue czech tourists from mountains . 
  i would understand if they would n't have any mountains . 
  in my region ( upper carniola - northwestern slovenia ) lots of adult people ( 35 + ) wear outdoor clothing on a normal day . 
  bright jackets like this : https://www.hervis.si/medias/sys_master/products/hervis.si/1815170_si_detail.png and https://www.hervis.si/medias/sys_master/products/hervis.si/1658651_si_detail.png,

  for france i get `` why france joined wwi '', 
  i think that your fussball mannschaft is known as elf . 
  at least that is how it 's called in slovenia . 
  if you are anti illegal uncontrolled mass immigration without integration plan are n't you just being rational ? 
  but still i 'm not going to vote for our right party because they have too many other stupid ideas that i do n't agree with . 
  we do n't celebrate walpurgis night we just have bonfires across the country . 
  it 's funny how they always argue on this forums who is whiter and blonder like this is the most important thing in the world . 
  nobody cares about us :( i found some data : r1a = 38 slavic i2/i2a = 20.5 south slavic r1b = 18 celtic i1 = 9 germanic e1b1b ( formerly known as e3b ) = 5 greek j2 = 2.5 greco-roman i2b = 1.5 germanic ( saxon ) g = 1.5 caucasian t = 1 egyptian j/j1 = 0 jewish q = 0 hunnic n = 0 uralo-finnic data from [ eupedia ] ( http://www.eupedia.com/europe/european_y-dna_haplogroups.shtml ), 
  snow also fell on 26th of april , 1979 . 
  some photos : https://fototekamnzs.com/2016/04/28/snezna-podoba-slovenije/, 
  well there is a difference . . we have access to the sea and they do n't !, 
  so is slovenia :(, 
  there are no konzum 's in slovenia . 
  but here are stalin and lenin . 
  ask refugees : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3l79hu/refugees_entering_slovenia_via_croatia_will_be/cv3vl4n, 
  oh you mean \u017eolca ? 
  i completely agree . 
  \u010c is perfectly usable letter . 
  our family normally do n't buy bread on sunday because we still have it from saturday and it 's does n't become that shitty in one day . 
  if you do n't have bread you can still eat cereals . 
  slovenian dress costume on this picture is from gailtal , carinthia , austria . 
  it might be traditional for slovenes from this area but not for slovenia . 
  slovenian national costume looks like [ this ] ( http://www.panoramic-dmc.com/uploads/images/gallery/site-header/narodna_624x278.jpg ) . 
  we actually had a [ referendum for limited sunday shopping ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovenian_sunday_shopping_referendum,_2003 ) and voters were 60 % for limiting but some shops are still open on sundays , mostly big shopping centres . 
  some groceries are open until 12/13 others are closed . 
  i personally do n't need shops to be open . 
  if you plan you can buy everything before sunday . 
  also we rate very high on this gap equality charts . 
  slovene man are the ones who do [ most of the housework ] ( http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/which-countrys-men-do-the-most-housework-design-news-214608 ) . 
  i do n't know if you count us as ee but slovenia is 9th on this list . 
  slovenia : most na so\u010di, 
  his calendar pics are priceless : [ poor cat :( ] ( http://www.slovenskenovice.si/sites/slovenskenovice.si/files/styles/s_610_x/public/2011/12/28/murko%20september.jpg?itok=sotc95qc ) [ naughty boy ] ( http://www.smesnadarila.si/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/k/o/koledar_murko_9-10.jpg ) [ cook ] ( http://www.slovenskenovice.si/sites/slovenskenovice.si/files/styles/s_1280_1024/public/2013/11/05/koledar_murko_7-8.jpg?itok=ttzph2hr ), 
  [ domen kumer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs4icelqylo ), 
  i completely agree and their supermarkets ( hofer ( aldi ) , lidl ) are in most of the cases the cheapest option . 
  +1 potato burek best burek, 
  for our leftists we are guilty for brussels attacks because we attacked their countries and because rich/middle class people do n't want them to attend good schools . 
  can we into west slavs ? 
  it 's good to see that czech republic still have healthy feminism . 
  some political correctness is okay but nowadays you almost ca n't do nothing without hurting someone and it gets on my nerves . 
  i am asking because some much women these days think that everything is an oppression against them . 
  i agree that if it not hurtful or shameful it 's completely okay to have this kind of tradition . 
  are czech feminists against it ? 
  what do they say about that ? 
  probably [ \u017deljko ivanek ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0411964/ ) . 
  in some other slovenian dialects ( \u0160tajerski for example ) too . 
  i like vienna . 
  i 'm from upper carniola and '' a ne '' or more often '' a n ' '' ( we like to shorten every word ) is not used as sarcastic yes it 's more often used as a rhetorical yes and we use this '' a n ' '' almost at the end of every sentence . 
  there is simply no comparison between these two . 
  i know that there are some mountains where you can hike either from slovenia or austria . 
  we sometimes get bulgarian milka which has more milk and it 's lighter than german one . 
  we do n't use that word . 
  this is the first time i 've ever heard of it . 
  nutella is not that shitty but it is not as good as is nutella from m\u00fcller where they sell german one . 
  it not that is good only just because it is from west but because it is better . 
  i 'm pretty sure that they have shitty products too . 
  not everything is perfect because is from west . 
  we do n't get the same nutella or same milka :( it 's like we do n't deserve the same things as they do . 
  exactly . 
  that is why so many people in slovenia it 's not like we have to offer anything . 
  no big sights like florence or paris but i think that more and more people discover that tourism is not only based on that but some people want to see something more than cities only . 
  our internet is special . 
  +1 that is exactly how it is in slovenia and some of them even yell at you if you are wrong so you figure i guess it is better to stay silent . 
  luckily ? 
  we are pretty small country and everything is subtitled so we can learn english from the internet and tv . 
  they also want to present quotas to our radio stations so we will have more slovenian music . 
  i would rather see that they stop repeat same 5 songs over and over . 
  we have slovene immigrant community in cleveland . 
  i understand slovakian and czech better than macedonian . 
  macedonian sounds to me like : a few words in serbian/croatian that i completely understand and a lot of weird words that i have no idea what they mean . 
  that could be the reason . 
  why do you use so much \u0161 's , \u017e 's and \u010d 's ? 
  no , no , no . 
  honestly i have no idea . 
  lightening actually destroyed our router . 
  yes . 
  we have both . 
  prepih ( draft ) and we get wolf in the ass ( dobiti volka v rit ) . 
  +1 i use viber , whatsapp and fb messenger .
