  i 'm not sure if they are like this also in primorsko-goranska \u017eupanija . 
  i think that slovenes are croats mixed quite a lot so who knows what mixture he is . 
  we are not included :(, 
  well we only have mcdonalds and one subway and one burger king . 
  almost like justin bieber fans , beliebers . 
  yes . 
  this immigrant would rather die than stay in slovenia . 
  you should stop next time . 
  i met my boyfriend in croatia and zagreb at the moment has better concert scene than ljubljana . 
  your beaches are nice too . 
  maybe , just maybe they still do n't respect women as they should even though they are waiters . 
  i think it would n't be impossible if rapists were true australian but it 's rape is far more common in arabic culture . 
  it seemed ironic to me : look australians are rapists too and then i 've looked what their names were ... they sound arabic and indian . 
  even if they would be true australians rape is never acceptable . 
  http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9fafc960123d6f948ded80b5f37080d0 this is how they look like . 
  dylan djohan , ashwin kumar and waleed latif . 
  those are their names and they sound like they 2nd generation of immigrants . 
  slovene word is begunec . 
  i haven visited many arab sites . 
  i have to admit . 
  but i 've gone to many european websites . 
  i was in italy in few times and i 've wanted to explore the area but webisites sometimes are not in english so of course i needed to use google translate . 
  that is just of the cases . 
  if i would go to some arab country i would probably use google translate if i would need it . 
  i do n't know it 's a risky road and you want to begin a life in a new country will you not google about it and use google translate if it is necessary ? 
  maybe they just read what they want to believe it 's true . 
  yes , but still i simply do n't believe everything i hear . 
  why they believe so easily ? 
  they risk their life just based on something they heard . 
  i do n't understand that . 
  i would n't risk my life if i would n't be in danger . 
  better house is simply not worth of my life but i guess they do n't think like that . 
  i do n't understand why do n't they google how it is to live in certain country ? 
  it is not that they do n't have internet . 
  one of our most popular folk groups are avseniki https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7gfnagyes8, 
  folk dances from north west of slovenia https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez9vkiwcapw, 
  we also have this tradition that kids go around and ask : `` a mate kej za pusta hrusta ? '', 
  - do you have anything for pust ( fasching ) ? 
  and then they give you candy or some money . 
  i think it 's not popular as much as it once was in my childhood . 
  he is right . 
  it 's pala\u010dinke . 
  oh [ flancati ] ( http://www.delo.si/assets/media/picture/20090820/670x420_14%20flancati.jpg?rev=1 ), 
  today is unofficial celebration for fat people . 
  we eat '' [ krof '' ] ( http://www.tednik.si/modules/aktualno/uploads/krof_004.jpg ) in these days around `` pust '' ( fasching in german ) . 
  we call them american pancakes . 
  it was nice in 2005 but i think now is even nicer and friendlier to pedestrians . 
  i recommend you \u0160kocjan caves if you revisit slovenia . 
  less tourists , a bit cheaper , no cave train but still really pretty . 
  well i personally believe that he is not innocent and he stole money but on the hand we now have a city with pedestrian centre , bike sharing system , lots of things have been renovated and number of tourists is growing every year . 
  zagorje has the best croatian  in my experience lots of people from zagreb i met or heard on trams do n't use kaj but use \u0161to . 
  maybe they have origins in other parts of croatia ? 
  but i think it was n't always like that because my boyfriend sometimes remembers `` starozagreba\u010dki '' ? 
  we say `` kaj '', 
  yes , they do but official is \u0161to . 
  they have three main dialect groups : ** \u0161to ** kavian , ** \u010da ** kavian and ** kaj ** kavian . 
  the bolded part of the sentence means `` what '' in each of these dialects . 
  so they use : \u0161to , kaj and \u010da for what . 
  it sound similar to : dober dan . 
  ( good day . 
  how works ? 
  what do you have ? ), 
  but i do n't think it means that right ? 
  is it good day ? 
  what are you doing ? 
  what do you have ? 
  we do n't use word '' \u0161to '' but croatians do and it means `` what '' . 
  we use word dom for a home and hi\u0161a for a house . 
  as far as i know perun was a slavic god and wikipedia says : `` artifacts , traditions and toponyms show the presence of the cult of perun among all slavic , baltic and ugro-finnic peoples . '', 
  http://www.myetymology.com/encyclopedia/perkele.html here it states that there is some connection between parkelj and perkele . 
  parkelj is a name for the devil ( hudi\u010d in slovene ) that accompanies st. nicolas . 
  every year st. nicholas went from house to house and gifted us children . 
  i was so afraid of krampus ( parkelj in slovenian ) that they were not allowed inside and they 've had to wait outside . 
  they do n't have a status of national minority so everything is done is slovene . 
  hungarians and italians are minority in slovenia so they have right to have documents in their native language . 
  i do n't understand italian , that is why this is probably not so understandable for me . 
  btw i really like music and dances from resia , they are really interesting . 
  i 've heard that some resians call themselves russians ? 
  could you tell a bit more about that ? 
  it says something about about water , right ? 
  slovakian is more understandable for me . 
  and slovenia . 
  slovenians too . 
  we called hungary ogrska . 
  sure , why not ? 
  i like it . 
  we get albanian coastline and bunkers . 
  i like our new neighbours . 
  yes but it 's really similar , colour and coat of arms is the same place . 
  rest of the world would still have a problems but i would n't need to look two times if it slovenian or slovakia poster on reddit  . 
  i know that colours of our flag come from the year 1848 when slovenes were enlightened : oh we are slavs !, 
  later it was recognized as official flag of duchy of carniola . 
  i do n't know why they thought that it would be good idea to have a flag that is so similar . 
  they could at least put coat of arms on the other place . 
  yes but it is confusing somewhere slovakia is slo somewhere slovenia . 
  no wonder that people are confused . 
  slo is our international licence plate country code . 
  maybe [ metod trobec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metod_trobec ) . 
  he raped , killed , and cremated at least five women . 
  where is slovenia ?
