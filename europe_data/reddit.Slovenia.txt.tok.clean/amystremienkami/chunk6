  we have that too and we call it citre . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvpfevrpcwg ) is a melody from old slovenian movie . 
  yes wage is better but it seems that is harder to find a job than in czech republic . 
  according to numbeo prague and ljubljana have almost the same local purchasing power so i guess quality of life is not worse . 
  also i think it would be interesting to gain some international working and living experience . 
  which sites would you recommend for job hunting ? 
  i do n't speak czech language so i would like to search for a jobs where you do n't need czech language . 
  you can expect open museums and free guidance , pre\u0161eren oriented events , song reciting , work shops . 
  i come from municipality where this pre\u0161eren guy was born . 
  from our municipality came lots of other important writers and other people so we have so called `` pot kulturne dedi\u0161\u010dine '' - cultural heritage trail and you can visit their birth houses , see our beautiful nature ( we have a nice view to julian alps and karawanks ) and try products made by our farmers or diy makers . 
  we have pre\u0161eren ( he was our most importnat poet ) day where we celebrate culture . 
  on this day you have free entrance to museums and other culture institutions . 
  yes !, 
  i 'm from slovenia and i speak slovene , croatian and english ( fluently ) . 
  i understand reality tv show german and telenovela spanish . 
  i think that we do n't have a place that would look extremely poor or bad . 
  but yes i kind of forgot about gypsy settlements they are probably worse to live than hodo\u0161 or osilnica . 
  yes morocco is a war zone that is why so many western tourists are there on holidays . 
  well according to this they are the poorest . 
  they are poor because they do n't have good connections to other towns and because of this lots of young people leave this place for something else . 
  the second worst is [ hodo\u0161 ] ( http://prekmurje.si/wp-content/gallery/hodos/prekmurje_hodos_04.jpg ) which also does n't look that bad ( monthly salary is 765.29 netto , unemployment 18 % ) . 
  what do you think it is the worst place to live in slovenia ? 
  podcrto made a [ research ] ( http://podcrto.si/revscina-v-sloveniji-katerih-obcinah-se-zivi-najslabse-in-zakaj/ ) about that and according to this the poorest municipality is [ osilnica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/municipality_of_osilnica ) . 
  * population : 374 ( it 's one of the oldest in slovenia ) * average monthly salary : 695,04 eur ( netto ) * unemployment : 18,4 % this is how it looks [ like ] ( http://podcrto.si/app/uploads/2015/09/1200px-osilnica-960x720.jpg ) you can raft [ there ] ( http://jostgantar.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/osilnica_jo%c5%a1t_gantar.jpg ) there is [ adrenaline park ] ( http://1nadan.si/image/show?iid=2013_7_18_15_9_886.jpg ) they also have a [ long board competition ] ( http://image3.redbull.com/rbcom/010/2015-06-30/1331732505689_2/0010/1/1500/1000/2/roke-v-zrak.jpg ), 
  basketball , ice hockey , handball . 
  yay , gl\u00fchwein - kuhano vino season !, 
  i think it 's normal to learn a language of your new country as quickly is possible . 
  i think it 's selfish if you do n't do that . 
  natives are almost always more comfortable to speak in mother language not in english . 
  serbs can sometimes have a bit of temperament but they can also be the kindest people ever . 
  yep you 're right . 
  soca can be dangerous . 
  also to greece , spanish islands , egypt and turkey but not so much as to croatian coast . 
  in winter some people go skiing in slovenia , austria or even france . 
  true . 
  normally somewhere in the mountains . 
  well they need to wait to cross the border . 
  fence is there to control number of people that are let in in a country and it controls that they do n't cross it where it 's not official passage . 
  so if there will not be a big number of them they will immediately cross the border . 
  no need for waiting . 
  people are too idealistic in my opinion and have no experience with control masses of people . 
  in concerts and in amusement parks are fences too but noone has nothing against it . 
  it 's not that they will not have possibilities for border crossing they will have to wait . 
  austrians were nice to me . 
  maybe because i 've tried to communicate in german . 
  czechs were also ok but i 'm not that kind of person that expects that everyone would be extra kind to you . 
  slovene tv shows are meh , bad or cringy . 
  cobra 11 and kommissar rex are really popular in slovenia . 
  when i was a kid i really loved to watch rex . 
  i saw this on slovenian tv . 
  i have no idea how popular it is . 
  do n't you think they will return back to germany or at least to austria ? 
  well 410 is not so little if you carefully plan what will you eat and what will you do with that money . 
  when i was a student in slovenia i managed to get by with less money . 
  lidl and h&m cost almost the same in germany as in slovenia . 
  yes , coffee and restaurants are cheaper in slovenia but why would you go there every day . 
  problem is if you need to raise a family with that mo ney . 
  then this is a completely different story . 
  slovenia registers them and take them to refugee center . 
  then they are free to go if they want to go . 
  they do n't want to stay in slovenia they continue their route to austria . 
  so what can do you want us to do ? 
  keep them as prisoners ? 
  but even young people did n't speak english . 
  i do n't know were they scared perhaps . 
  one old guy did start to talk to me in german if i know that one `` kaiserin '' is 1 zloty more expensive than other . 
  i have to say i 'm surprised too . 
  i visited katowice last year and i was surprised by the lack of english knowledge . 
  eventually i gave up and used mixture between slovene and croatian . 
  cabins are cottages are normally made of wood especially in alpine area . 
  minority of houses are made of wood too or just parts of them . 
  i do n't understand why would you want to leave czech republic to live in a tent in germany . 
  how can this be better for your sick kid ? 
  will he even get a good treatment right now ? 
  or he will have to wait to get it ? 
  i would be really happy if some country would help my child and wait til the end of the treatment or wait to leave a country until i 'm sure that my sick kid will get a good treatment there . 
  he once said that sees similarities between slovenes and finns . 
  we both have tendencies towards alcoholism and suicide . 
  oh right !, 
  i love moomins !, 
  i watched cartoons when i was little ( i still am but it does n't matter ) . 
  your writer , arto paasilinna is popular in slovenia . 
  [ logar valley ] ( http://tur-servis.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/dsc_0824_logarska_dolina_resize.jpg ) it 's not so hard to get there but you can hike around this area . 
  [ triglav national park ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=triglav+national+park&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cayq_auoawovchmixefbxmj8yaivghusch2cqayr ) has many peaks , lakes and other natural wonders that are worth to visit . 
  german way !, 
  yes we usually expect that no one knows us or say you mean ... slovakia ? 
  were you in ussr ? 
  we do n't think they are cheap so lots of slovenes go to croatia to visit a dentist . 
  there are dental clinics just across the border just because of slovenes . 
  but croats go to bosnia ... 
  i agree but i think people in slovenia want to show off with a house too . 
  if everything is not somehow tidy neighbours start talking how bad area around the house is . 
  it 's great idea . 
  in slovenia is the same . 
  in trains there are normally two seats against another two seats . 
  everybody wants to seat alone . 
  i have no idea what are the stereotypes about slovenes known in europe . 
  same in slovenia . 
  it helps that computer programs/websites and so on are not translated to slovene language so basically you need to learn some english if you want to use them . 
  it was czech movie week in zagreb and my boyfriend 's coworker chose that movie so we went to see it .
