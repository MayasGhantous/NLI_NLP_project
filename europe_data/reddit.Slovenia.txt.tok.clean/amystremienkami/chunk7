  i was surprised how many people attended !, 
  it seems that croatians really like czech movies . 
  i saw kolja and i like it . 
  thanks for the recommendations i appreciate it !, 
  i 've seen others also . 
  the last one i saw was vr\u00e1sky z l\u00e1sky . 
  i thought it was okay for one autumn afternoon . 
  nice but nothing special . 
  slovenian movies are so depressing and directors try too hard to be artsy and dark so it 's nice to see that kind of comedies that you have . 
  i like new wave so i liked sedmikr\u00e1sky . 
  happy end is simply great . 
  i really like the idea . 
  i like that movies are funny and light but are n't typical comedies . 
  i have to say that i was not so impressed with prague as some people are . 
  do n't get me wrong it 's a nice city and i think it would be okay to live there . 
  i just think i might be too used of this type of `` hapsburg '' architecture . 
  prices are still lower than slovenian so that is a plus . 
  i 've been in moravia too when i was younger . 
  i do n't have any special opinion about this region . 
  i like czech movies and your language is cute . 
  thank god . 
  ljubljana , slovenia : * one course lunch in a normal restaurant 6-9 eur * lunch menu 4-6 eur, 
  i suppose that is the reason . 
  i do n't think that our mountains in slovenia are closed during the winter so it is a bit unusual to me . 
  why is it open only in these months ? 
  meh i guess i wrote that two times . 
  thank you for noticing !, 
  border between slovenia , austria and italy [ slovenia , austria and italy ] ( http://www.gogorenjska.com/sites/all/files/upload/images/tromeja2.jpg ), 
  eh we are modest compared to croatians . 
  they even have flags on their trams in zagreb . 
  happy [ reformation day !, 
  ] ( http://www.sloveniatimes.com/slovenia-celebrates-reformation-day ), 
  in slovenia they are called indijan\u010dki . 
  slovenian name for native people in america is `` indijanec '' . 
  indijan\u010dek is a small or younger indijanec . 
  when i was in vienna i also saw an older man who was really angry and yell : `` foreigners get out !, 
  you took our jobs !, 
  and so on '' but this might be one of the isolated cases . 
  maybe this is the same guy as yours . 
  i have no idea why is that so . 
  it 's completely illogical i agree . 
  official german translation of gornja radgona is oberradkersburg . 
  ober is gornja in slovenian language ( upper in english ) . 
  burg is a castle , grad in slovenian . 
  so yes it is similar but it is n't exactly the same . 
  vienna is becs in hungarian that is why serbians and croatians call it like that . 
  slovaks call danube dunaj but city itself is viede\u0148 . 
  bakeries and ice cream shops might be similar because they run by albanians . 
  why do you guys count slovenia as part of balkans ? 
  is it because we were once part of yugoslavia ? 
  what else ? 
  geographically we only partially in balkans . 
  i 'm curious . 
  we were for long long long under the austrians . 
  we do n't have turbo folk music as they have in serbia . 
  we have \u010devap\u010dici but they are imported . 
  i do n't know what are the things that defines what is balkan and what is not . 
  in slovenia we have all saints day too ( november 1st ) . 
  halloween is becoming popular mainly in pubs and clubs . 
  there are some horror movies on tv and in cinema . 
  some people are putting pumpkins in front of their houses . 
  kids do n't dress in costumes . 
  we have `` pust '' for that . 
  austria , denmark , switzerland , germany, 
  it looks nice and peaceful . 
  the first 2 letters , before the shield sticker denote the region where the car was initially registered . 
  further division is made by the coat of arms of the corresponding city , placed after the regional area letters to define subdivisions . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vehicle_registration_plates_of_slovenia ), 
  not slovenia . 
  i feel so sorry for all the children . 
  sometimes it seems to me that they do n't really care that much about them . 
  i do n't understand why highly pregnant women want to go on a journey that can be dangerous for your baby and you . 
  if i would be pregnant i would just want to have a bed somewhere and rest . 
  is it really more important that you live in a country with the best standard or is it more important to safely deliver a baby ? 
  shopping malls are always full and cafes also . 
  it 's not so bad . 
  turbo folk music videos are hilarious . 
  we have numerous folklore groups all around slovenia . 
  popular is also so called `` narodno zabavna glasba '' or `` oberkrainer musik '' which was popularised a lot by slavko avsenik . 
  it was also very known in austria , germany , switzerland . 
  this music is popular in elder audience but also younger people do n't mind to dance to it on village parties ( so called veselica ) or weddings . 
  here is the most famous song from this genre . 
  [ ansambel bratov avsenik - na golici ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j00r4ymg7ac ), 
  well i spent lot of my holidays in croatia too . 
  we went there almost every year since i was born in 1989 . 
  so yes i know how it is . 
  it 's not unbearable . 
  sometimes we did n't wait at all . 
  even if he goes through slovenia he still needs to go to croatian highways especially if he goes to dalmatia but there is alternative : croatia `` old roads '' . 
  yes route will be slower but cheaper . 
  nazis everywhere ... 
  just a normal day in [ slovenia ] ( http://www.planet.si/imgs/g/1150x648/2015/34/022211jvw0d.jpg ) they filmed a movie here [ too ] ( http://www.planet.si/zabavno/novice-tv/v-srediscu-ljubljane-razobesene-nacisticne-zastave.html ) i think it 's not the same movie as is in czech republic . 
  well we do have caves https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_caves_in_slovenia but i did n't know that we are known for that . 
  and italy is france . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  i understand that hospital is not in good condition but that does n't mean that it ca n't be clean . 
  he has slovenian wife . 
  otherwise i do n't think he is appropriate for a president . 
  we 're better than germany but it looks that does n't matter . 
  i like karel gott and his hand https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvgw7otutr4,
