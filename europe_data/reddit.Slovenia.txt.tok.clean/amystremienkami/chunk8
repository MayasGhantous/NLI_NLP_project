  oh god i love trash !, 
  so here we go : - my favorite !, 
  vocals are perfect . 
  [ 4our - usojena sva si ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbwwafex8fg ) - slovenian ruslana [ tjasha zhidan - ne maram te ve\u010d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=denqtjvjvag ) - i do n't know what is happening [ pogum dekle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbjdwif-jfi ), 
  i 've visited : spain , france , italy , slovenia , croatia , hungary , slovakia , czech republic/czechia , poland , germany , austria , uk . 
  there is not so small number of slovenian immigrants ( 30000 ) in austria . 
  we are more individualistic than serbs so we do n't hang that much with each other and we do n't stick out . 
  yes there are slovenian schools in carinthia . 
  some kids from my area attend them . 
  there are some slovenian high schools , lessons are normally in german and in slovenian language : * zvezna gimnazija in zvezna realna gimnazija za slovence v celovcu / das bundesgymnasium und bundesrealgymnasium f\u00fcr slowenen in klagenfurt * zvezna dvojezi\u010dna trgovska akademija v celovcu / zweisprachige bundeshandelsakademie * vi\u0161ja \u0161ola za gospodarske poklice \u0160t . 
  there is one in klagenfurt and the other in ledenitzen .

  [ toma\u017e pengov - danaja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ped7rinjwjo ) ( singer/songwriter , folk ), 
  this vysda page always forgets us in their charts :(, 
  yes , even when there is a positive news about unemployment or economic growth some people think that they are lying to us . 
  missed that . 
  maybe it 's this one ? 
  in slovenia it is forbidden to sell alcohol in shops between 21:00 - 7:00 . 
  also they do n't serve spirits in restaurants and bars from start of the working day and until 10:00 . 
  outfit is great too . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvgw7otutr4 ) best arm choreography ever !, 
  we do . 
  quite a lot actually . 
  there are around 60 public libraries with 270 `` smaller units '' . 
  some of these public libraries do n't have `` small units '' but they have these library buses . 
  we are small country but we still have places that are bit too far from libraries and that is why some public libraries have their own library bus . 
  this is better and classier but i still do n't like it and i still do n't think that this is `` great pop music '' . 
  could you please link songs that are not so bad ? 
  i know that sandra afrika is popular and she sings about that tonight somebody will put baby in her also she is almost naked in that video . 
  exactly . 
  some of these cities remind me of ours ( probably good old architecture from austria-hungary times ) . 
  cajke or \u010defurjada ( in slovene ) is also awful to me . 
  all songs sound the same . 
  girls look like they are in porn movies . 
  everybody dress weird and completely weird . 
  all this bragging with money and fancy cars really does n't do nothing for me . 
  i just ca n't relate to that . 
  i like some other alternative serbian bands like : bitipatibi , repetitor , ti , vvhile . 
  slovenia was influenced by different countries and this shows on our folk outfits . 
  they can be pretty different from each other . 
  [ gorenjska , nw slovenia ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/ce/86/4b/ce864b4223b5d5872429a79af2731539.jpg ) [ primorska , sw slovenia ] ( http://www.drustvo-ozara.si/images/stories/ozara_images/nose/primorska_ln1.jpg ) [ bela krajina , southern slovenia ] ( http://www.slovenijanadlani.si/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/bela-krajina/belokrajnske-narodne-nose.jpg ) [ prekmurje , eastern slovenia ] ( http://www.drustvo-ozara.si/images/stories/ozara_images/nose/prekmurska_ln2.jpg ), 
  donava . 
  our kids wear slippers probably for the same reasons and it 's comfier . 
  [ logar valley ] ( http://www.solcavska-panoramska-cesta.si/en/imagelib/12/default/20-tock/logarska-dolina/logarska-dolina-retusa.jpg ) lovely alpine glacial valley . 
  [ so\u010da valley ] ( http://www.amazingplacesonearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/soca-1.jpg ) clear and cold emerald blue water river . 
  great for rafting and other adrenaline sports . 
  [ krn lake ] ( https://travelslovenia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/krn-lake-slovenia.jpg ) lake krn , the largest slovenian alpine lake located in the south of the triglav national park . 
  they included three cities from slovenia !, 
  slovenia : [ toma\u017e pengov - danaja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ped7rinjwjo ) ( singer/songwriter , slovenian nick drake ) [ nina bulatovix - jate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oa_onnydgq ) ( post-punk ) [ melodrom - september ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-yxd0-w3ws ) ( pop ) [ iztok mlakar - en gla\u017e vina mi dej ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoxbrlm8fe ) ( singer/songwriter ) [ videosex - moja mama ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk56lpw51py ) ( synthpop , new wave ) [ laibach - take me to heaven ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl2mf5lhwdk ) ( they are mostly industrial but this song is different ), 
  i think that they got some of information from german police so i guess police know who he is . 
  they know that he did n't have criminal record , that he was an addict , he has mental illness and they also know that he run away from his family a few times before so i guess they just do n't want to release his name . 
  it 's not as bad but still it was n't only attack in recent years . 
  i just stated facts . 
  years before these attacks were n't so eventful . 
  slovenia is still pretty peaceful but still there are some lunatics that are capable of that kind of crimes . 
  sadly no . 
  last year we had a case when someone called police and then he crashed into the police vehicle . 
  one year before policeman stopped a driver because he drove without a seatbelt . 
  driver just shot him in the head . 
  so in the last years situation is getting worse and it seems that every year people are getting crazier . 
  he was actually drug addict with a mental illness . 
  he had been denied entry into croatia so he wandered around . 
  no wonder that none of us do n't want to be connected with a term eastern europe . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksgw8osfhp0 lublana is indeed close enough . 
  solution !, 
  [ czech corridor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czech_corridor ), 
  1 cent : austria ( 2 ) 2 cent : austria ( 1 ) 10 cent : italy ( 1 ) 20 cent : austria ( 2 ) 50 cent : france ( 1 ) 1 euro : spain ( 1 ) 2 euro : netherlands ( 1 ) , austria ( 1 ), 
  slovenia is a bit empty because [prevoz.org ] ( https://prevoz.org/ ) is more popular than blablacar . 
  yes . 
  i thought you are just a bit darker when you said wrong colour not that you are not white . 
  but yes i agree they are a bit racist they also double check romanians and bulgarians . 
  i have different experience . 
  i go to zagreb every month and they almost never check me and i normally carpool there so it 's normally different kind of people sometimes even quite a mix of nationalities . 
  do n't worry finland i know how you feel . 
  i actually feel much closer to you as for example bulgarians and macedonian . 
  i think it 's mostly because we share so much similar history and you were also really austrian influenced . 
  you are somehow as rich/poor as we are so we can afford similar lifestyle . 
  i even understand you as much as some macedonian . 
  really ? 
  never heard about it but it 's possible that some people had that in their apartments . 
  this is the first time i see this . 
  we have carpets on the floor . 
  most of our popular media also reported about the shooting . 
  i think that we have low numbers because we are not super religious , not that poor , contraception ( not condoms ) is free and abortion too . 
  during my high school years none of the girls got pregnant . 
  now when i am 26 baby boom is happening . 
  most of the people are not married . 
  some are engaged . 
  at least he will be prepared for any kind of terrain . 
  i 'm asking you what are then characteristics that makes you balkan ? 
  define what in your opinion makes your balkan . 
  no i do n't think we are germans but you can notice the difference between how we behave and how some serbians and bosnians behave . 
  not all serbians or bosnian all like that for sure but stereotypes are normally stereotypes with reason . 
  i do n't think it 's a bad thing if you are different . 
  you are far more welcoming than we are , more open and you do n't worry so much about how will you do something . 
  on slovenian border they check cars and especially vans with romanian ( and bulgarian ) license plate more seriously as other eu citizens . 
  so yes you do n't have the best reputation . 
  i 'm not denying that we are slavic . 
  of course we are slavic but that does n't makes us balkan . 
  we are not funny enough to be balkan , our music is boring , food is traditionally mediterranean-central european , we do n't use nearly as much make up as your girls , your families stick together much more us ours , we are bigger individualist as you are , you like tracksuits ( tri \u010drta ! ),
