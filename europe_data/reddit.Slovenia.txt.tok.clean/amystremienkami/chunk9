  those are some stereotypes that in my opinion makes you balkan . 
  there are some differences in mentality . 
  centuries of living in different countries made us that we are like we are . 
  in my opinion even croatians are not entirely balkan . 
  i would really like to know what are characteristics of balkans ? 
  do you like to go hiking ? 
  are you good at ski jumping ? 
  do you like oberkrain music ? 
  do serbs go skiing in winter ? 
  why do serbs think we are cold and not welcoming if we are like you ? 
  i would really like to know what makes us so similar beside slavic language and yugoslavia ? 
  we do n't even celebrate christmas and new year on the same day . 
  slavic language does n't make you balkan . 
  so are czechs and slovaks balkan too ?

  we can send you our chemtrails conspiracy believers . 
  we are even disliked as much as they dislike slovakia . 
  probably they could n't differentiate which is which . 
  because our seaside is too small :(, 
  i think that because some of you are a bit too loud . 
  i think slovenians like trieste because many of us like to go there for a day trip . 
  we also like your airports . 
  but on the other hand i think many italians do n't even know where we are . 
  one of them thought we use cyrillic and i also saw menu in trieste ( ! ), 
  restaurant which stated that text is slovenian but it was actually in russian . 
  i think that flag was even slovakian . 
  so many mistakes . 
  vienna 1st , munich 2nd . 
  i actually like both of these cities . 
  bulgarian is not that easy to understand if you only know slovenian . 
  it 's a bit easier if you understand croatian for example . 
  it 's actually easier for me to understand slovakian than bulgarian . 
  neither for me :(, 
  i like your song . 
  it seems the most okayish . 
  slovene guys are n't actually that high . 
  180.3 is average height in ljubljana says [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/template:average_height_around_the_world ), 
  i completely agree . 
  germany is really important for our economy so lots of job posting is stating german as a necessity or as an advantage . 
  our old name for november is also listopad . 
  as far as i know our dialect was influenced by bavarian nad low german so this might be a reason . 
  it was more in use when i was younger . 
  in slovenia we use word palacinka but in my village in upper carniola we do sometimes use word omleta for palacinkas .

  slovenes too . 
  here is a table with these old names for months in different slavic languagues ( + lithuanian ) https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/mesec, 
  they are central europe for me because i think they have far more in common with austria than with belarus or russia . 
  short names are pretty popular these days . 
  maybe in 2016 . 
  no black guy here http://www.lidl.si/statics/lidl-sl/ds_doc/lidl_katalog_kw01_2017.pdf,

  nope , german word is steiermark . 
  this is r/europe so i will use english word for this area . 
  this is the first time i hear that they were spotted in also carinthia . 
  they were actually spotted close to leibnitz in styria . 
  i have to correct you : slovenia has only 2 million people ( not 4 ) and we sadly do n't have plitvice lakes which are in fact in croatia . 
  what about us ? 
  we have some books written about them , this one for example http://www.rtvslo.si/news-in-english/slovenia-revealed/a-legend-from-a-perilous-time/406069, 
  seems like us and slovakians do n't share only the similar name but also similar percentage of certain genes . 
  i remember that we also had to do a cycling test when i was 9 . 
  i know we had some lessons and we exercised on a poligon with some old bikes . 
  main test was cycling through our villages and they evaluated if we practically know the rules which they learned us before . 
  in the end we got some card where it is written that you passed your test . 
  my slovenian environement seems to be different than yours . 
  everybody pays for themselves or one pays and you return him sometime .

  same in slovenia . 
  we even got plates with this names to help them keep alive .

  yes i have . 
  just yesterday i saw three in ljubljana . 
  previous week one on the train in kranj . 
  when i lived around jezica in ljubljana i reguraly saw one in niqab . 
  i would say that i see at least one per two week on average . 
  lakes are near : [ lake bled ] ( http://cut-bled.com/pic.2/10838-0.jpg ) , [ lake bohinj ] ( https://www.globespots.com/pictures/europe/slovenia/bohinj_0662.jpg ), 
  that sounds like my region in slovenia . 
  people always look like they will go hiking . 
  salomon shoes are worn even if they go out for a beer . 
  hervis is probably the main store where they buy clothes . 
  sorry i meant unemployment . 
  this is very common . 
  even when media write something positive : how we are the best country for children - what about xy hungry children , our unemployment has lowered - they lie to us , slovenia is one of the best tourists destination - no , we do n't have monuments like eiffel tour , we suck !,
