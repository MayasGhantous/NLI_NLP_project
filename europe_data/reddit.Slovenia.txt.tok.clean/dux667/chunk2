  our country has a lot of hunters and a long hunting tradition ( i do n't and never had hunted ) . 
  i got no problem with people hunting for food , and then taking a trophy , but it seems senseless to me the trophy hunting of top predators . 
  i frequently come across stories of people talking about how overpopulated the deer and boar population has become in parts of usa for example and how much damage they cause , and the hunting is the only thing slowing them down . 
  well , hunt away as much as you want , but the problem began with the loss of predators thus allowing the prey species populations to explode . 
  i live in slovenia , and we lost most of our wolves , lynx , we got a somewhat healthy bear population for our size ( cca 300 ) but it would still be easy to endanger them . 
  tldr : hunting is ok , killing off top predators for fun & trophies , is a dick move and endangers natural balance . 
  i 'll bow to your estimate here , i 'm 37 and had the feeling growing up most people + -5 years around me had no trouble understanding serbo-croatian , that said , i did grow up in a very mixed neighbourhood in a very mixed region ( zasavje ) , could probably also vary along regional lines a lot . 
  way above average for slovenia . 
  we all basically talk 3 or 4 languages . 
  most people over 30 have very good knowledge of serbo-croatian language from our shared past in yugoslavia . 
  most of population ( at least below age 40 ) is english speaking , and around 30-35 % ( according to polls ) knows german language . 
  near the borders people also speak the language of our neighbours ( italian , hungarian ) . 
  i 'm somewhat confident we 're at the top , as far as multilingual nations in europe go . 
  i also have quite a few friends that have moved here from uk and sweden , because the locals mostly all speak english it 's kinda hard to learn our language , as noone has any problems communicating in english . 
  truth be told , i had almost the same situation in sweden , my swedish language skills suffered because almost everyone knew english ( except for the lone croatian guy i came across in gothenburg ) . 
  yes , but you 're mostly talking about economic cost ( i think ) , compared to a possible worldwide catastrophe . 
  in such cases i 'd value safety and overkill over mere money . 
  prepare for worst , and hope for best ? 
  is n't it a bit insane to just gamble on something which is n't known yet to fix things ? 
  i totally agree with you , but then again we were both raised in either yu or ex-yu depending on age , and there was an indcredible comic book scene in yugoslavia . 
  there are whole swaths of sayings that have become a part of public subconscious , almost everyone knows stuff like : `` halo bing , kako brat ? 
  i 'd also put on the best comics list the following : anything by hugo pratt ( corto maltese ) , early marty mystere and dylan dog as my favourites . 
  i also loved all the classics , kapetan miki , blek stena , komandant mark ... but i have a sneaking suspicion that as an adult i would n't like them as much . 
  i do stand corrected , though in that same list just above them in height is the category dinaric slavs which does include amongst them people from montenegro . 
  they are on average 1.7 cm taller . 
  i 'll admit my memory of it comes from an old guiness book of records from the 80 's and in the meantime things have changed a bit it seems . 
  tried looking for historic records of male height in the 1980 's , had some limited success here : https://ourworldindata.org/human-height/, 
  i 'm somewhat sure it was never bosnia , but another ex-yugoslavian country called montenegro . 
  as a kid growing up in slovenia in the 80 's we were regularly reminded that men from montenegro were at that time the second tallest in the world ( after masai ) , but 30 years seems to have shaken the top countries around a bit . 
  kinda funny that the current record ski jump is held by a norwegian and the second place is slovenian , highest mountain in slovenia is 2868 i think , so his theory falls apart even there . 
  well , why not fight for `` special arrangements '' ? 
  and where would you `` deport '' the turks ? 
  i also think you 're very wrong on how native populations view the situation in australia . 
  you 're just very inconsistent in your view . 
  that is why i asked where you would set the limit . 
  if you look back far enough there were migrations all over the place . 
  and ( again ) by your logic and your cutoff time ( columbus and leonardo ) it would mean the forced expulsion of most of usa population , they started the migration there at the same time . 
  how far back in the past would you apply this ? 
  i mean by your logic we should `` kick '' out hungarians of asian descent ? 
  my people ( slavs ) also migrated here , should we self-deport ourselves ? 
  i think your squatter analogy is very weak and unfitting here . 
  in this case i 'd say it is warranted , fepeak uses the same argument against others to dismiss them and as they say : `` turnabout is fair play . '', 
  the second part ( church funding and influence ) definitely , but i believe in informed choice , and that 's something a baby and hell , even sometimes a teenager can not do . 
  i 'm an atheist ( hard to guess , right ? ), 
  but i think religion is a serious issue and should be approached when you have the reasoning skills to choose . 
  one of the things that bothers me about baptising kids ( apart from not having a choice on the matter ) is that the church ( in some countries , mine for example ) then counts every baptised human as a member of that church , even if they never attend and are atheist when they reach the age of reasoning . . 
  in some cases that results in the church getting extra funding and influence . 
  `` rigorous shitposting '' this sounds soooo german to me . 
  bravo . 
  when i was working with them , the geese would regularly kill my ducklings . 
  let 's say that swans are bond villains and geese are drunken hooligans ... 
  they 're both dicks but i think swans are more common . 
  and i can say they 're dicks as i worked as a duckherd for a few years and had geese and chickens in my flock too . 
  you 're all underqualified . 
  i played command & conquer red alert , it 's clearly the obvious choice for qualifications . 
  what is serious here ? 
  to me it all looks pretty silly and absurd . 
  it most definitely is not . 
  [ dialects of rooster ] ( http://www.bootstrappin.com/2008/10/cock-a-doodle-doo-dialects-of-the-rooster/ ) your weird version of rooster speak is in a decided minority . 
  damn , i can not believe the conversations i find myself in sometimes . 
  * their and i fail to see the supremacy of : `` cock-a-doodle-do '', 
  love the tattoo , and surprisingly your username is relevant too . 
  i 'm re-re-reading haunted at the moment . 
  i get schwa as translation for `` polglasnik '' . 
  edit : sorry , i thought you meant schwa is n't polglasnik , i only later realised you meant hro\u0161\u010d itself . 
  yes , agreed i just meant hro\u0161\u010d was a word almost impossible to pronounce by scandinavians . 
  edit2 : actually , i just realised i know less about our language than i thought , i think i gave the right answer but i 'll gladly defer to someone with a better explanation . 
  we have a sort of half-wovel sound called `` polglasnik '' in our language , which translates to [ schwa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwa ) i had tons of fun getting scandinavians trying to pronounce `` hro\u0161\u010d '' which means beetle in our language , it just messes them up . 
  edit : made a series of mistakes , got corrected by thinsteel below , he seems to know what he 's talking about , check there and disregard me . 
  mind if i join you ? 
  [ first snowride 2017 ] ( http://imgur.com/a/yhxgo ) wish i had an `` after '' pic . 
  i do n't know about his/her technique , maybe . 
  i just like the practical , positive and gentlemanly approach to a what will likely be a touchy subject filled with political buzzwords . 
  nope , i 'd say yours is the only real position to take here and others could learn a lot from you . 
  i spend a lot of time across europe every year , it 's amazing how well known that movie is with people i meet . 
  i 'll list some of my favourite `` balkan '' movies . 
  [ maratonci trce pocasni krug ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27rtq0ttkqq ) , classic black comedy and still works today . 
  [ ko to tamo peva ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwozslas8dm ) , same as above , these two movies might be the most cult classic movies from our area . 
  [ no man 's land ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myma_l-qvzq ) war movie , a co-production won best foreign movie oscar in 2001 [ tockovi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeqrksftt9g ) black comedy tarantino style . 
  [ lepa sela lepo gore ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjahat0pauy ) slightly controversial at the time , black comedy about the war in balkans , known for rebuilding and then reburning a village already damaged in the war . 
  [ rane ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ks7dnlbnk4 ) a gangster movie about the youth in serbia in the aftermath of war . 
  [ kek\u010deve ukane ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmygspp2w_s ) probably best known ( internally ) movie in slovenia , a children 's movie about a good-hearted shepherd boy from 1968 . 
  [ wristcutters ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hemwtkco5sa ) a romantic comedy about suicides and the afterlife . 
  croatian director , israeli book and cool ukrainian music . 
  [ nattevagten ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc9rzpny9ko ) and just for off-colour here is my favourite danish black comedy . 
  the links are to youtube , some are to full movies , some only to trailers , a few even to subtitled full movies . 
  i usually have to jump through a few hoops to get english subtitles for my foreign friends . 
  if i remember correctly he was sentenced under a blasphemy law the uk still has on books , and some tweets from politicians are hinting he was not murdered in prison . 
  i do n't mind being corrected of course . 
  and i did n't mean predatory as in crime ruling the streets , more as in greed is mostly rewarded across the board . 
  have you ever seen any forum conversations about either gun control or health care ? 
  either the usa is horribly dangerous and you need a gun to protect yourself because the cops are too far away , do n't give a fuck or will shoot you on sight or it 's a peace loving country ( apart from some parts which we will exclude ) , health care is horrible obamacare is so expensive people are ready to revolt , or it 's so cheap and available that everyone can have it ( except for millions of uninsured ) . 
  so depending on what one wants to prove ... 
  i do n't believe everything i read , on internet or otherwise , but statistics for murder are what they are , and i 'm trying to understand them . 
  i almost have to compare the us to eu because there is n't a lot of other similary developed countries , australia and japan come to mind but i do n't know a lot about them . 
  but there are a lot of eu countries with a lot of immigrant population and they all have much lower murder rates than usa . 
  predatory might not be the right word , but i 'm not sure how to call a society that worships unbridled capitalism and sees greed as almost a virtue and most of public programs as communism . 
  desperate people in a society with extremely harsh prison terms and very little programs for rehabilitation and easy access to guns just seems like a recipe for crime to bloom . 
  i do n't see the usa as some sort of lawless country but there 's definitely room for improvement . 
  also i do n't think we should be comparing ourselves to mexico , and if we exclude some outliers from europe for being bad apples than the situation becomes even more skewed .
