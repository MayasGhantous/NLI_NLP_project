  i spend a lot of time in jamtland , when the ice begins to melt the roads warp and buckle a lot ... 
  i do n't know how it is in other parts but up there ... it can be interesting . 
  hehe , my mistake ... thus proving i truly do n't understand it , thanks for letting me know . 
  i think it actually might be just one family that handles most of our fruit and veg business across the whole region , and they just spread out across different cities . 
  when i was a kid ( quarter of a century ago ) they also had lots of fast foods ( burek , \u010devapi , pleskavice , kostanj , pomfri ) available from them too , i miss those days . 
  we can still get some stuff , but the selection is much poorer now . 
  in hrastnik for example there is no more '' \u0161ukri '' burek available ... and there is nothing so good as coming home from a party/bar in the winter and stopping for a hot burek on the way . 
  lots of them , but i 'll take woody guthrie for my `` historical '' pick and ( cliched i know ) bernie sanders for contemporary one . 
  in my region ( zasavje ) fruit and veg shops seem to be dominated by albanians , other stuff has diversified but they still reign supreme there . 
  damn , i 'm a musical omnivore , impossible for me to narrow it down to just one . 
  i 'll try to limit myself to things most others might not post . 
  french : [ ernestine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abgznjf3h_m ) by noir desir with an amazing hungarian violinist lajko felix ukrainian : [ haydamaky ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxwmfspdkzk ) albanian : [ blla blla blla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gazdoetwv_i ) romanian : [ mahala rai banda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xgyonutfyk ) saami : [ mari boine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayevblutulc ), 
  i got no problem downvoting someone who spews his opinion as fact without providing any proof of his dubious claim . 
  first sentence would be ok , the second one is a magnet for downvotes . 
  if you really live in slovenia , then you should know that the people of bosnian descent are approximately 1.1 % of our population , i 'm guessing you threw in people from all other exyu countries into this . 
  i actually did read those as a kid . 
  have you ever seen the stuff by milo manara ... now that is not for kids . 
  yep , i grew up on those and all the others that were available . 
  the variety we had available was incredible . 
  marty mystere , dylan dog , prince valiant ... just the stripoteka magazine by itself was amazing . 
  anyway +1 for alan ford , and here is one of my favourite `` superheroes '' of all time [ superhik ] ( http://www.balkanmagazin.net/storage/global/images/2009/javno%20mnjenje/maj/af4.jpg ) , a lowly drunk janitor at first glance , he 's a staunch defender of the rights of rich people . 
  he steals from the poor and gives to the rich . 
  nope , i 'm another hitchhiker dude ... from zasavje , have n't met the other guy yet , but it 's nice to hear there 's some of us left . 
  my cat , named [ `` divja '' ] ( http://imgur.com/a/svzgi ) , it means `` wild '' . 
  i 've traveled across scandinavia with her , even did some 1000km hitchhiking with her . 
  at -30 a good bed warmer , without electricity a good entertainment and on a farm a good mouser . 
  gods , i do n't think i could stand a world without the music you guys make , that 's just a small thing ... but even that would crush me . 
  they are , but not widely spread yet . 
  smoking is still quite tolerated in my experience . 
  it does , i had a quick google check on etymology and found this : `` from byzantine greek \u1f00\u03b8\u03af\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ( ath\u00ednganos ) ( \u1f08\u03b8\u03af\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ( \u1f08th\u00ednganos ) ) , ultimately from either the name of a christian sect or a word meaning `` untouchable '', 
  put yourself in my shoes then , you can see above what the mix is that created me , who should i be proud of ? 
  all of them ? 
  none of them ? 
  i 'm proud of the people i know personally , and the stuff i do myself i appreciate a lot of culture but i do n't see why i get to be proud of it just because i was born in the same space . 
  if my mother showed the same indifference to me that the local geography does i 'd say it would be just as ok to be indifferent . 
  pretty much my opinion too . 
  my mother is from serbia , my father is croat , one of my grandfathers is bosnian , one of my grandmothers is french and i was born in slovenia ... any type of nationalism for me basically means hating myself and my family in some way . 
  i ca n't understand being proud of where i was born , i had no choice in the matter . 
  also , jackie chan in armour of god , filmed in postojna ( i ca n't believe i know this ) . during filming of the opening sequence , one scene called for jackie chan to jump from a wall to a tree branch . 
  the first take went as planned , but chan insisted on re-shooting the scene . 
  on his second attempt , the branch broke and he fell 5 metres to the ground below . 
  his head hit a rock , cracking his skull and forcing a piece of bone up into his brain . 
  chan was flown to the hospital and was in surgery eight hours later . 
  as a result , he now has a permanent hole in his head filled with a plastic plug and slight hearing loss in one ear . 
  chan replaced eric tsang as director following the accident . 
  footage of the accident is shown during the film 's ending credits . 
  [ armour of god ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdg1noav8pm ), 
  not sure who told you talking politics is taboo here , bitching about politics is our national pastime . 
  i feel like most of what i read in the link you provided would not be considered horrible here , apart from fascism . 
  do remember you 're coming to a country that was divided between fascist italy and nazi germany , also hungarians and croats took parts of our country in ww2 . 
  the wounds are if not fresh , still deep and on both sides . 
  if you wo n't discuss politics while drunk you 're pretty much good to go anywhere , and that 's a good advice if you ever find yourself in all balkan countries . 
  i 'm a mix of serb/croat/slovene ancestry and i steer clear of most political topics while travelling and drinking with people . 
  i 'd say being on the nazi side of alt-right would get you a beating in my region ( zasavje ) , we 're called the red region and there are lots of immigrants from ex-yugo countries here , we do n't take kindly to nazis . 
  on the other hand if you 're just `` slightly '' xenophobic and against immigrants , chances are you 'll find people who 'll agree with you almost anywhere in slovenia . 
  i got no clue what a radical traditionalist is , but now that i 'm aware of the term i 'll educate myself a bit . 
  amish samurai sounds extremely cool to me . 
  it 's basically same as with other countries , some people move here for the money because their country is in worse shape than ours . 
  some move here because it 's cheaper than their own country and their savings or retirement lasts longer . 
  of the non-economic reasons i 'd say it 's for the landscape , we 're around 60 % forest , lots of hills , alps , a piece of adriatic sea . 
  i do n't want to go all teary eyed patriotic here but we really have a stunningly beautiful country , this is just the result of googling [ slovenija landscape ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=slovenija&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=628&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiwu6ocscrrahvngsakhbc-afkq_auibigb#safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=slovenija+landscape ), 
  unfortunately the poster above is mistaken , older buildings in slo can still have lead pipes , i lived in one of those for a good chunk of my life . 
  as a rule though most of our water is extremely clean and safe , my particular building was an old apartment building from the 1900 's and there were sometimes measured levels of lead above the eu norm , it would only happen if you let the water `` sit '' in the pipes for a day before using it , we were instructed to always let it flow for 5-10 seconds before using it . 
  i tried looking up recent figures but it 's hard to find info , i did find this [ population exposure to lead in drinking water in slovenia ] ( https://repozitorij.uni-lj.si/izpisgradiva.php?id=87025 ) which claims that some 22 % of tested water samples had too high lead levels . 
  pipes in my current building are all plastic , at least internally i ca n't say anything about further down the line . 
  so while i think the blind faith of my compatriot is seriously misplaced , i believe we still need some work done . 
  i 'm not sure how to take that question . 
  there could be as many reasons as there are people , and also which people you mean ? 
  of my friends that have come to live here : older friend from the uk came here for the scenery and because his retirement money goes further here , i have a few swedish friends that are heavy foodies and they love our cuisine they bought a farm and are planning to start a restaurant here , i have a few czech friends that have fallen in love with girls here and married into slovenia , there are tons of people from ex-yu working and living here for the better salary . 
  you really have to be much more specific . 
  of course you 're not , you 're also the country of becherovka ... is becherovka something people still drink ? 
  i 'm the only one of my friends that likes it . 
  i 've never used our national airline , their prices are usually well beyond my reach . 
  i just breezed through some prices and it 's 5 to 10 times more expensive . 
  it will be budget airlines for me in the foreseeable future i guess . 
  albinos are closest to white i can think of , i 'm closer to pink than white myself in the winter and get nicely brown during the summer . 
  my family comes in quite a lot of different shades of tan , some of them that live on the adriatic coast are more brown and they 've lived there for centuries . 
  i guess i 'm wondering where you set the cutoff for `` white '' on the color scale and why you would want to . 
  we 're nice , but fair warning , as an `` alt-righter '' you wo n't be welcomed everywhere , some of us are still touchy about ww2 and all that . 
  edit : not to mince words , read `` alt-right '' as nazi ( i checked their sub for the first time and fuck me , they are horrid ) and `` everywhere '' read most places , in some there 's a serious chance you 'd get beat up . 
  i got nothing against albinos , but i do n't think it 's a particularly european thing . 
  hard to tell , but i 'll give it a go . 
  from our time as an part of yugoslavia i 'd say it might be this [ bleiburg repatriations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bleiburg_repatriations ) , we might be a rival for the title of country with most mass graves per square kilometer . 
  just in my town there are 11 of them , [ mass graves in slovenia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_graves_in_slovenia ) , and we 're a town of 10k people . 
  in our new incarnation it might be [ patria case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patria_case ) . 
  well there are some idiots like him on the right side that got conned that all of their problems are because of someone or something outside , instead of their own stupidity and ignorance but he is as i said in a minority . 
  if he ever said stuff like that outloud in company he 'd be either asked to leave or beaten up . 
  i ca n't speak for all of slovenia of course but i 'd say apart from some nationalists ( again extreme minority ) we got absolutely nothing against croatia . 
  and the word '' \u010defur '' comes from an old word '' \u010difut '' which used to mean jew , but it 's now used by idiots and nationalists ( same group i know ) to mean anyone from ex-yu , especially from bosnia . 
  again , he does n't represent slovenia in any way , shape or form except his own little bubble . 
  if you ever come here you 'll be welcomed and beer will flow , i 'll buy you the first few myself . 
  never mind him , if you check it out he 's in a minority of 1 and just trolls constantly , he 's already banned from / r/europe i think and his alt / r/kontaktnicenter already got suspended . 
  just give it some time and this one will get deleted too . 
  what 's with the '' \u010defur '' , i 'm really not fond of that word , as a son of croat/serb immigrants born in slovenia i got called that quite enough as a kid by idiots unable to think by themselves . 
  edit : fixed a typo in username, 
  it was before ww2 and they fought fascists , but both of you should also keep in mind tigr , a joint slovene-croat militant resistance that was active since the 1920 's . 
  i never claimed sanity . 
  errr , i have an almost unlimited amount of hate for polka ( living in slovenia that is a sin ) and i think german language sounds like a rabid mechanic trying to smother me with umlauts , but that 's just me . 
  yes , but it did n't say `` people who live in eastern europe '' so i took it as possible he meant `` people who are from , or have roots from eastern europe '' as well . 
  i fall in one of those categories , you may feel otherwise , but then again you always look to stir shit up .
