you shut your whore mouth !, 
  iron sky was a 90-minute-long laibach 's music video !, 
  i 'm not an economist , but if greece defaulting their debts , it would destabilize the whole eurozone ? 
  while croatian coasts can be so full of tourists during summer months , the study only include zagreb , which is located relatively far from the coast . 
  more like popular ones , though missing lots of typical tourist destinations . 
   eurotest warns travellers to consider unexpected costs in their travel budgets   while travel and accommodation prices are relatively easy to calculate from home , eurotest warns that it is sometimes the unexpected costs during a holiday break that can get out of hand . 
    the latest eurotest has made a comparison of *** incidental holiday expenses from 20 popular holiday destinations *** in 18 european countries . 
  although , overall , prices were high in typically expensive cities like london or oslo , the survey discovered that munich was an unexpectedly affordable destination . 
  meanwhile , as might be expected , cities such as belgrade , zagreb and ljubljana fell on the less expensive side .

  [ the report . 
  ] ( http://www.eurotestmobility.eu/news/2014-2/incidental-expenses-in-city-breaks/ ), 
   two palestinian survivors told the international organisation for migration ( iom ) that the boat had been intentionally sunk by traffickers . 
  that is fucked up . 
  different culture , different language , much higher prosperity than other spanish regions , except madrid . 
  things you would do to get the attention . 
  in the 4th picture you can see they carried a huge picture of merkel with a message in german . 
  so , not only english probably . . 
  seriously , does anyone here read a bit of history ? 
  this had been a common thing to happen during referendum . 
  do you think scotland would break away very smoothly if they do ? 
  the price of independence . 
   mercenary swords ,   they 're feeble reeds . 
    the austrian eagle   has already lost its plumes . 
    the blood of italy   and the polish blood   it drank , along with the cossack ,   but it burned its heart . 
   they really hated the austrians at some point of time . 
  actually , honorary consuls are not diplomatic corps , but usually local business person that doing lots of business with the foreign country that they represent . 
  while it 's bad , but it 's certainly not really the most ad polluted city in europe . 
  many newer eu member countries ' big cities have similar problems , with raising consumerism and such . 
  whe . . where do i sign ?? 
  in fact , i 'm naked already !, 
  wait , so poland is the only country that never experienced an economic contraction since 2005 ? 
  in 2010 , my wife got a ticket when we drove passed an empty industrial zone in nijmegen on sunday evening ( 61 kmph in max 50 ) . 
  i forgot how much , but it was n't really that much . 
  it would be more expensive in slovenia , especially a few years ago ( 300 $ ) , but they already revert to older penalty since people were complaining . 
  this is actually kinda funny , but the fact that it 's being said by a serbian makes it sound a bit douchey . 
  upvoted . 
  . . and risk scotland leaving the union ? 
  this is about kamnik , a small yet beautiful town north from ljubljana . 
  [ anyway , a few weeks ago i made this intro album to slovenia , if anyone interested ] ( http://imgur.com/a/dhktj ) . 
  [ smart fashion ? 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/_muldb96ire?t=43s ), 
  anyone here from monaco or hesse ? 
  they should be polish by now . . 
  the same logic then also applies to australia as a christian country . 
  i 'll take another example , poland predominantly more catholics than indonesia to islam . 
  when was the last time you hear someone say poland is a catholic nation ? 
  it 's probably one way to say it , but it does n't mean that it 's the right way . 
  muslim nations reflect islam in their constitution , or adopt islam as their state religion . 
  indonesian constitution left out islam , and almost completely exclude religion ( except the `` under god '' part , and how you can not technically be a non-believer ) . 
  is there the video in liveleaks or other friendlier-to-the-eye website ? 
  preferably uncensored , too . 
  i 'm sorry i have to generalize . 
  but have you even meet enough muslims and know how are a typical middle eastern muslim and a typical indonesian muslim ? 
  they are in fact quite different . 
  and bear in mind that most indonesians living in australia are students and expats , which lot of them are non-muslims . 
  on the other hand , while indonesia has the biggest population of muslims , it is not necessarily a muslim nation , they are quite secular compared to typical all the middle eastern countries . 
  well , we do have a few smaller coastal villages where some sails and tiny yacht can dock . 
   anyway , the statement is still technically correct . 
  koper is our both largest and smallest port . 
  yeah . . next you would suggest also with serbia , bosnia & herzegovina , kosovo , montenegro and macedonia . 
  i wonder how would they name the pact . . hmmmm . . 
  the real question is when the country stabilize . 
  it can be days , months or years . . 
  if things get ugly . 
  you 're talking about eu3 while / u/simohalo talks about euiv . 
  a bit different here . 
  maybe native slovenians can correct or explain more , but i think because most students need to learn at least 2 foreign languages . 
  the first one is usually english , and german is second popular throughout the nation ( especially the north where borders austria ) , while the area by the coast are traditionally italian . 
  hungarian and serbo-croatian are more popular on the northeast and south part respectively . 
  yes , but i think revolution is yet a strong word . 
  revolution is chronic mass protest that leads to either the collapse of the government or a civil war . 
  i will try to answer it short . 
  the problem is really slow fiscal consolidation . 
  the taxes and other fiscal policy should be uniform in every countries that has euro . 
  i 'm not an economist , but i think they needed to make it * before * they decided to use single currency .

  [ original thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1vxgub/my_first_map_how_many_beers_can_you_buy_with_a/ ) . 
  well , hi there my countryman !, 
  together forever ? 
  where are the others ? 
  yeah , i always argue that italians go to their cafes for the coffee . 
  another case are the austrians . 
  known for the earliest cafe culture in europe , austrians go to cafes for the atmosphere , social interaction , etc. 
  therefor , starbucks can penetrate austrian market , competing with those century-old kaffeehaus . 
  some european ethnic groups who live along the mediterranean have darker skin color , too . 
  on the other hand , one of my colleagues was half-gypsy , i can say that she is relatively pale-skinned , like the typical population . 
  and you would n't guess that her mother was a roma . 
  yeah , on the same thread someone posted [ the link to its wikipedia timeline ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/g%c3%a4vle_goat#timeline ) , which i think one of the most hilarious wikipedia article . 
  not op , and the thread ( with a few corrections ) can be found here http://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/1t7ix4/who_brings_gifts_to_europe_translations_of_santa/, 
  no one ever asked about us . 
  yeah everytime i order pizza anywhere in italy , i was always got disappointed . . up to the point that what they say a good pizza in italy is mediocre for slovenian standard . . 
  sorry neighbor . . you maybe the inventor , but pizzas everywhere else ( at least in europe ) are usually more tasty and have brilliant toppings , which italians would consider blasphemy . 
  i do n't know in which part you live . 
  but even in smaller towns , the youths are usually able to speak english , but a lot are too shy to speak it . 
  the older people however , they usually speak german , croatian or italian more than english , depend where they are . 
  austria will get lucky if we would talk about `` potato '' , but we could n't because it would make latvia sad . 
  even if it 's a real subreddit , it would be too small to even sustain itself !, 
  whoa . . a croatian that speaks slovene !, 
  get him guys !,
