  worry not , i 'll get at least half dozen on sunday when i go to the carnival !, 
  i 'd be sugary high !, 
  well , i found this by accident while having a glorious pancake party with two different nutella . 
  funny how they tasted different , i quickly thought one jar was counterfeit nutella . 
  but after checking the label , i realized that one was made in poland , one in italy . 
  no offence for polish redditors ; imma let you finish , but italian nutella is superior !, 
  ok , one thing !, 
  i 've never been to america , but my sister-in-law just came back from her vacation to us . 
  one thing i remember she mentioned ; nutella taste greasier and bland in the states . 
  [ here 's a wiki of different compositions of nutella ingredients ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nutella ) . 
  i personally like the italy-manufactured ones . 
  your interest places are really scattered . 
  especially if you 're traveling exclusively by train . 
  anyway , [ here 's a europe rail map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/high_speed_railroad_map_europe_2008.gif ) ( with highlighted speed ) and [ this complete one ] ( http://www.raileurope.com/europe-travel-guide/ ) . 
  perhaps , they might help to set your itinerary . 
  oh my . . btw even tough i live in slovenia , i 'm actually indonesian . 
  hey , we are [ brothers in flag !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_indonesia ) :p also with [ hesse ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_hesse ), 
  that flag just brought some nostalgic moment to me . 
  it 's [ one of the most popular milk brand in indonesia ] ( http://www.google.com/images?q=frisian+flag+milk ) , the country where i grew up . 
  are you polish or [ thuringian ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thuringia ) ? 
  i just realized that these flags can be deeper . . 
  maybe both . 
  but does n't help to help to convince the other eu leaders , i 'm afraid . 
  i 'm familiar with the pressure . 
  but preparation for romanian schengen area inclusion have started for a while ( since 2008 ? 
  cmiiw ) , and romanian government just decided to do this right now . 
  i just find it odd . 
  this is great !, 
  however , to consider the timing , it sounds kind of desperate , do n't you think ? 
  we like to masturbate to our flags http://www.reddit.com/elxyi, 
  sometimes , i hate it when thread discussions about world events were suddenly hijacked into us events . 
  i always downvote these comments , unless it 's somewhat interesting and relevant . 
  / confession and i think nickelback is not that bad / i am ashamed of this confession 10:50 in cloudy ljubljana , ca n't wait for sunny and warm weekend !, 
  well , i have no comment on slovaks ' coin , no offence :p but i do love the slovenian coins look like , i think it 's one of the most beautifully designed euro coins . 
  no matter how terrible , one must not forgets his/her past . 
  unless he/she is willing to repeat it . 
  personally , i like [ other designs ] ( http://www.estonian-euro.com/competition.htm ) better . 
  oh well . . one month have passed since circulation started , and yet have n't seen it with my own eyes . 
  anyway a friend of mine is going to estonia next month , i 'll ask her to bring some . 
  arguably yes . 
  up until your country decides to split . 
  regions are usually not measured by distance but by cultural characteristic and geographical entities . 
  slovenia laid on [ intersection between four regions ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovenia#geography ) , while slovakia is situated on [ pannonian basin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pannonian_basin ) . 
  anyway , bratislava is located on extreme west of the country . 
  another case : vienna and bratislava is only 60 + km away , 50 minutes apart . 
  but they 're already belong in different regions . 
  yes they did . 
  from [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lithuania )  during the 14th century , lithuania was the largest country in europe : present-day belarus , ukraine , and parts of poland and russia were territories of the grand duchy of lithuania . 
  with the lublin union of 1569 , poland and lithuania formed a new state , the polish -- lithuanian commonwealth . 
  the commonwealth lasted more than two centuries , until neighboring countries systematically dismantled it from 1772 to 1795 , with the russian empire annexing most of lithuania 's territory . 
  the problem is : slovenia and slovakia is not on the same region . 
  they just have too similar names ( same number of letters and only three letters difference ) . 
  also , their too similar [ flags ] ( http://www.ljubljana-life.com/media/pics/slovenia-slovakia.jpg ) , joined eu at the same time , became independent from a bigger communist nation , etc. 
  they should tell your story in the beginning of every geography classes . 
  roughly 1 in every 3 occasions i tell someone from [ insert any western european nation here ] that i 'm from slovenia , they responded : * hey , i 've been to bratislava !, 
  it 's a very nice place * wow , never been there . 
  but i 've been to prague * yes yes , [ insert a popular slovak athlete ] is from slovenia right ? 
  so , i guess your country is more popular . 
  i do n't know if some people mistakenly think the opposite ( slovakia as slovenia ) . 
  the recent opportunity slovenians got to be recognized was when they played against england and us on world cup qualification last year . 
  disclaimer : i 'm not slovenian , just have been living here for a while . 
  and in our case , slovenia and slovakia . 
  well , illegal as in * building the properties in unauthorized lands * . 
  illegal , as they * have no permission ( or visa ) to stay in the country * . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , some of these communities are old and there have been measurements to help them acquire the lands legally . 
  but i do n't know how that turned out , since only a few of roma have enough money to purchase those lands . 
  that is serious problem , i did n't realized that the numbers are really high . 
  i live in slovenia for a couple of years now . 
  we have small ( illegal - cmiiw ) communities of roma near the borders with croatia and hungary . 
  they 're unwanted by the general population , but the government had been trying to give them a lot support . 
  on the other hand , the media is openly ridicule roma in every chance they could . 
  the reason why i asked was because i 'm interested on other countries ' roma problem . 
  being a minority myself , the situation saddens me . 
  but then it makes my blood boils to read how lazy the romas are . 
  they really bring bad name to minorities . 
  i 'm currently reading the `` 1984 '' book , so i 'm feeling uneasy on how current things getting in hungary . 
  may i also ask you how are the anti-roma/minorities movements these days ? 
  this is not a good sign , at all . 
  are we letting this happened ? 
  especially for the hungary case , i 'm speechless . 
  was n't this usually how totalitarian government formed ? 
  it 's not that i totally disagree with the article , but it 's full of anti-muslim statements that make me hard to take it seriously . 
  the real problem is irresponsible religious practice performed by certain muslim communities . 
  what does it have to do with 2005 riot ? 
  the article suggest nothing but blame on muslims . 
  how about demonstrations and protests that arguably take place very often in france ? 
  they were closing the streets , causing inconvenience and even destroying properties . 
  should we ban those too ? 
  ( poor example here , but you get my point ) . 
  there should be certain measurement that implemented . 
  other countries in the world have muslims communities too ; they also have friday pray . 
  france can perhaps see some examples before doing a terribly wrong thing . 
  and one more thing : it 's every friday , which means weekly , not daily basis edited for clarity, 
  downvoted for promoting bigotry and hate . 
  the two least things , europe should care about . 
   that 's one of the dumbest things i 've heard this month . 
  wow , i want to live wherever you live . 
  i heard so many dumb things just today alone . 
   but , slovenians being of german descent ?
