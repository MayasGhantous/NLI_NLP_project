  `` no , was playing a game . '', 
  `` playing a game ? 
  are you a child ? 
  are you 7 years old ? 
  i find it interesting , how someone who is a * gamer * is immediately seen as a childish person , who 's wasting their time and should be doing something better/more productive with their time . 
  on the other hand , someone who 's spending most of their free time watching tv is seen as completely normal . 
  fucking weird if you ask me . 
   so yes , there are people who look everything up . 
  or people who just see ** exxx ** and go of the rails . 
  `` oh , this contains e300 , it 'll give me cancer . 
  oh look , a bottle of vitamin pills , got ta have that , will keep me healthy ! '', 
  he should [ show ] ( http://data.whicdn.com/images/140931935/large.jpg ) us . 
  from / u/ajl1239  generally , i think other countries do a better job of distinguishing between a country 's citizens and its government whereas americans tend to understand the two as one and the same from / u/monaoeda  naturally it 's towards the us ** state ** and it has existed for a long time . 
  from you  and your telling me us americans are pure fucking evil ? 
  does that make it easier for you ? 
  someone already mentioned the green card . 
  it 's proof the car is insured . 
  with it you should be good to go pretty much everywhere , non-eu included . 
  just make sure you have everything you need to avoid fines . 
  some countries require first aid kit , some require reflective vests , tow ropes , etc. 
  if the car is properly registered and insured you can pretty much drive it all over europe . 
  if that 's something you can do as a non-resident is another question . 
  pretty sure you ca n't . 
  totally forgot about [ these two ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fr2h5fu92ag ) . 
  and i have no idea about your edit above . 
  i might recognize it if you find it but at the moment i ca n't remember ever watching anything like that . 
  i forgot all about so many of these . 
  [ \u010cebelica maja ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-mcm7v7jxo ) ( could only find the german intro , the show was dubbed ) [ the smurfs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1665x6fyva0 ), 
  i 'm not particularly big on spectator sports . 
  i may watch something if a national team plays . 
  but i have absolutely no interest in watching two teams from half way across the world compete in a sport , that 's not all that popular in the first place . 
  that being said , the popularity of superbowl seems to be on the rise in europe , which is baffling to me to be honest ... 
  jeans , t-shirt , sneakers . 
  add a hoodie and a coat if it 's cold , replace jeans with shorts when it 's hot . 
   the advantages of voting should be obvious to the citizens the advantages of vaccines should be obvious to people too and we all know where that is going . 
  slovenia does n't have that but i would support it under the condition one of the options would always be something along the lines : * i do n't agree with any of the presented choices * . 
  not sure how that should effect anything ( such as void elections/referendum/whatever ) but it should at the very least be in the statistics . 
  invalid ballots are already in the stats , but i think this would make a stronger point . 
  a vast majority . 
  this however does not change the fact our resources were spread extremely thin at the end of 2015 . 
  so his * which is neither a crisis , nor is it about migrants * is bullshit . 
  and that 's the point i was trying to make . 
  i said about a week . 
  the daily average between 21st and 25th of october 2015 was 10239 people entering . 
  sure , five days is n't quite a week and an average over 5 days is n't quite the same as a daily number . 
  but my point is still valid . 
  which is we did n't exactly had it easy which is what i feel no_real_username implied with his * how many hundred refugees * remark . 
   can you remind me , please , how many hundred refugees did your country agree to take in 2016 ? 
  i do n't have that number , maybe you could remind me ? 
  but i can tell you we have n't agreed to have over 10k people forcing their way into the country , daily . 
  which is n't happening any more , but it did for about a week . 
  so please stop with the bullshit about this not being a crisis and not being about immigrants . 
  it 's not for you ? 
  good for you . 
  we had pretty serious problems with emergency services that week . 
  that being said , i do n't agree with imposing visas on americans . 
  nor do i agree with joko11 . 
  and i certainly do n't agree right-wing parties are the solution to this * non-immigrant-non-crisis * , as you have put it . 
  i swear to god i 've seen that car somewhere ... 
  or simply did n't give a fuck . 
  as long as they have a well paid and secure public job . 
  at least that 's how things go here . 
   the penalties we 're going to pay now are going to be huge and no one will be held responsible . 
  been there , done that too . 
   i simply do n't believe that . 
  i do . 
  ours do it all the time ... :(, 
  not beaten , you 'll just be thrown off . 
  i ** love ** hiking !, 
  we certainly have the best trolls around these subs . 
  so you made an effort to go around it ? 
  please do n't . 
  we 're sick of the question . 
  i get slightly annoyed and that 's it . 
  i just downvote and ignore . 
  getting annoyed over something like that would be really stupid . 
  that does n't look bad at all to be honest . 
  mandatory driving theory classes . 
  they are about things like traffic signs , intersections ( who has the right of way etc. 
  ) , speed limits and everything you need to know as a driver . 
  i think they are around 20 hours and are organized by driving schools . 
  after the class there 's an exam which is organized on the national level . 
  is it hard ? 
  not particularly , but there some weirdly specific things in there that do n't really make sense and are probably there just to fuck people over . 
  like speed limit for buses or weight limit for trucks . 
  after that you have practical lessons , which are limited to a minimum of 22 hours . 
  after that you have a practical exam , lasting for an hour and if you 're successful , you get your licence . 
  there are other things involved in getting a driving licence , but they are n't related to learning to drive . 
  for example : first aid classes are required , and first aid exam ( which you obviously have to pass ) . 
  and a doctor 's exam , you have to pass this one too ... after you get your licence you 're considered a * junior driver * until you 're 21 but for a minimum of two years . 
  to get rid of the status you have to take a lesson in safe driving . 
  you drive up and down an obstacle course , with parts of it made to be slippery so it 's hard to control your vehicle . 
  it 's actually quite a bit of fun . 
  i think that 's it . 
  i think both me and liliputput can think of another person with an auto-downvote button , right / u/liliputput ? 
  you should , it 'll change your life !, 
  it changed my life . 
  i ca n't look at bananas the same way ever since ... 
  you 're supposed to start peeling at the bananus ? 
  that 's crazy talk .
