   silently judging ah , the best kind of judging ... 
  i 'd personally rather be under austria and being looked down at than being part of croatia and also being looked down at . 
  come on , you of all people should know better than to engage in a discussion with the guy . 
  because he 's not trying to discuss anything . 
   austrians lock their children in basements oh wow ... 
  i did n't mean jokes per se , more like teasing . 
   it 's that , if someone was known to be jewish by their peers , would they be treated differently ? 
  probably not , apart from jokes about money . 
  i 'm sure some people will call that antisemitism but those people are idiots so their opinion does n't count . 
  tolerance . 
  if you read carefully and slowly , you 'll see those things were mentioned by him first ( except the * self centric as fuck * part ) . 
  i was just trying to explain not liking something about someone does not mean you hate someone . 
  i did not realize this was such a hard concept to grasp . 
  but i suppose it makes sense in a way . 
  what would be better for that ? 
  ~ ~ what would be better for that ? 
  graz or villach ? ~ ~ edit : i meant this as a question to what / u/xorangethunder said , but accidentally replied to your comment , sorry about that . 
  how are you not yet banned here ? 
  i just realized i owe you an apology . 
  when i said * americans * i expected you to know i actually meant * some americans * , not * all americans * . 
  but when you said * europeans * i went of about how we 're not all the same . 
  which makes me a hypocritical cunt . 
  sorry about that . 
  now i feel bad :|, 
   america is n't a hive-mind either but people seem content to believe that we are all trigger happy , `` self-centric as fuck '' , lazy , ignorant people . 
  ** people ** do n't think you 're all trigger happy , self centric as fuck , lazy and ignorant . 
  there is no doubt a group of unspecified size , who thinks ** all ** americans are ignorant . 
  almost certainly there is another group who thinks ** all ** americans are trigger happy . 
  sometimes they overlap and some people think ** all ** americans are ignorant ** and ** trigger happy . 
  no doubt a group exists whose members believe ** all ** americans are just perfect . 
  on the second thought , it probably does n't ... 
  but there is a much greater group of people , who think ** some ** americans are ignorant . 
  just because you had the bad luck to stumble across the first group it does n't mean europeans hate america . 
  is this something you can wrap your head around ? 
   also i guess i just do n't get the dichotomy of people think the us is harmful to the world but at the same time want us forces in their country and want military alliances with the us . 
  generally , people who think america is harmful to the world do n't want us forces in their country . 
  it 's also possible to think america is harmful to the world , but is good for europe . 
  is it two-faced ? 
  sure it is , but still it happens . 
   but if ** europeans ** believe that america as a country/government is overall a negative force oh for fucks sake ... can you please understand that * europeans * is n't this homogeneous blob but about 700 million individuals , who are n't connected in a hive mind and all think exactly the same damn thing . 
  clearly , * europeans * also think america is overall a positive force in the world . 
  or at the very least think that while america might do more bad than good , it 'd still benefit us to kiss ass . 
   surely you do n't support your country having an alliance/affiliation with them ? 
  which also does n't mean you hate someone . 
  the world is n't black and white . 
   on the other hand a significant number of europeans hate americans thinking americans are self centric as fuck does not mean we hate them . 
  thinking they 're idiots does not mean we hate them . 
  thinking us does more harm than good does n't mean we hate them . 
  calm the fuck down . 
  i 'm not going to argue with you about if europeans even think this about americans . 
  because i 'm sure you 'll be able to find a shit load of europeans who 'll point at least a single thing they do n't agree with americans . 
  either with their government , politicians , individuals they might now ... no one is perfect . 
  just because you do n't agree with every single thing someone does or thinks it does n't mean you hate them . 
  i know that might be hard to accept for someone who has been told their entire life they live in the best country in the world , but that 's their problem . 
  i would suggest you try to avoid the train between ljubljana and budapest , if at all possible . 
  it starts in the morning and takes 8 hours so you 'll waste the whole day on it . 
  but it is cheap , the cheapest one way is $ 9 per person . 
  you could maybe travel between ljubljana and budapest via zagreb . 
  it takes even longer but you switch trains in zagreb and have about an hour to kill , so you could have a quick look around zagreb as well ? 
  just do n't forget croatia is not in schengen , so that ** might ** complicate things a bit . 
  there are more trains between vienna and ljubljana and the journey takes * only * 6 hours and you can take an afternoon train . 
  and if you want to spend a day or two in graz and continue to slovenia from there , that 's even less time wasted on the train . 
  eu alone has over half a billion people with about 200 million more in non-eu countries . 
  do you genuinely believe a majority ( or any significant number for that matter ) hold such extreme opinions the op described ? 
  because you * frequently see people on reddit talking * ? 
  come on ... 
  has nothing to do with him being eastern european . 
  and i 'm sure someone is going to argue about that anyway . 
  it 's just that the guy is a troll . 
  and does shit like this on every subredidt until he gets banned . 
  an which point he creates a new account and continues doing it . 
  needs a monocle and a top hat . 
  i know some people who have ( or had ) the same breed of dog . 
  they are ** all ** named * barney * ... 
  most people i know that have pets treat them as family members . 
  there are laws against animal cruelty , but i 'm not to familiar with them . 
  the question is if he 's getting paid to take integration courses or is he on welfare that is conditioned on taking the integration course . 
  which as far as i am concerned are two different things . 
  i thought you meant like ... ` bonus ' to cover expenses ( lunch and transport ) . 
  you got that going on too ? 
   bonuses what kind ? 
  minimum * wage * is $ 790 per month , before taxes . 
  and employees are required to get an untaxed * bonus * to cover certain expenses . 
  which bumps it up slightly . 
  vat is either 0 % , 9.5 % or 22 % . 
  why would i expect people to * just know * ? 
  net or gross ? 
  ah yes . 
  it formats it as a numbered list . 
  it 's annoying as hell sometimes . 
   1 . is now a hiloday again :d 1st january was always a holiday ... you mean the 2nd of january , which was a holiday , but then it was n't . 
  and now it is again ... because reasons ... 
   we had to know types of soil , vegetation , climate etc. 
  of every continent . 
  exactly . 
  countries were n't the focus . 
  they were more like a side thing i felt like . 
   i had it on matura . 
  i had geography on matura as well . 
  fun times ...
