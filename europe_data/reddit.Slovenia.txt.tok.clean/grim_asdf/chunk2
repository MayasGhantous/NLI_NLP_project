  the bank note says * 500 milliards * . 
  i guess if it does n't mix the ingredients properly or bakes evenly , the result would be pretty disappointing . 
  to be honest , i 'd prefer to be making it in the oven but bread maker is just so much more convenient . 
  the convenience does come with downsides unfortunately . 
  i 'd say it 's because you 're more interested in sea and we are n't really a beach destination . 
  i was reasonably happy with mine , but i guess it depends on what kind of bread you 're making . 
  if bread is that important to you , you should look into getting a bread maker . 
  they are reasonably cheap and bread is easy to make . 
  they are on their best behaviour when visiting the colonies . 
  no , i do n't concern myself with what people i do n't know think about me . 
  and i could n't care less if they are gay or not , because it is n't any of my business . 
  well ... 
  if you 're going to cut someone 's penis of , the very least you should do is ask for their permission first . 
  or what they are doing to someone else 's genitalia as long as they got owners permission . 
  this comment could be interpreted both ways . 
  you 're right , totally inappropriate . 
  ` dyed egg monday ' perhaps ? 
  i do n't get this . 
  the holiday is named easter so they are easter eggs . 
  what 's next , renaming the holiday ? 
  maybe we could call it ` coloured egg monday ' or something . 
  my point was 1.3 billion is not negligible for a small economy . 
  that is all . 
  i never said two wrongs make a right , as you implied ( btw , selling pharmaceuticals to russia is wrong ? ), 
  or that sanctions should be lifted . 
  you mean the sanctions , where exporting pharmaceuticals to russia is apparently bad , because * sanctioning russia for a military incursion  trying to cash a couple million euros more * but building/negotiating a gas pipeline to buy gas directly from gazprom is fine ? 
  4 % of all the trade is still 1.3 billion . 
  which might be a drop in the ocean for bigger economies like germany , but it 's not exactly negligible for slovenia . 
  there is no need to act like a retard . 
  no one likes freeloaders . 
  who do you mean by that tho ? 
  i find it just as strange out of 8 comments in this thread ( at the time i wrote this ) 5 are yours . 
  he was only invited because it 's a 100 year anniversary . 
  and yes , it 's a gesture meant to show we do n't really have anything against russia . 
  has the visit been confirmed yet ? 
  or just the invitation ? 
  so do we . 
  unless you jumped off the other side . 
  that 's interesting , i had no idea . 
   austrian is still german , just with more slavic loanwords . 
  such as ? 
  where ? 
  the only thing is * of the sex attacks , 61 were rapes ... * which only tells you other things beside rape were considered . 
  i 'm curious if the number of attacks has increased or is the number the same but people report it more now . 
  but czechout does n't fit well into the lyrics !, 
  czechit ? 
  well , me and most of my friends have degrees in computer science , so i 'm probably not the person to ask . 
  because everyone i know gets paid at least an average wage . 
  you would be wrong . 
  it 's about $ 1500 gross , which is about $ 1000 net . 
  source ? 
  not that i believe most people really work for minimum wage , but i was trying to find some info about wages and all i could find was info on average wage . 
  not even median wage . 
  [ almost there ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/thumb/c/cc/minimum_wages%2c_january_2016_%28%c2%b9%29_%28pps_per_month%29_yb16-ii.png/700px-minimum_wages%2c_january_2016_%28%c2%b9%29_%28pps_per_month%29_yb16-ii.png ) ... 
  it was on the front page of most major news sites . 
  before it got pushed of with different/newer news . 
  pretty sure he meant ` living ' and misspelled it . 
  where do you draw the line ? 
  at which point is stealing no longer acceptable ? 
  because immigrants ` travelling ' along the route is putting pressure on countries the route goes through . 
  and they do n't appreciate the pressure . 
  is there a reason you ca n't continue the discussion in english ? 
  i thought we only had one . 
  so when i saw two , my first thought was : `` so which one is it ? 
  not the guy you replied to , but ... 
  i would still define them as refugees . 
  that does n't give them the right to enter any country they wish , crossing whatever country to get there etc. 
  but they would be refugees in my eyes nonetheless . 
   this changed in 2006 when marriage definition was explicitly changed by latvian parliament super majority to `` union between man and a woman '' , in result stopping any future attempts of legalizing gay marriage . 
  going it that direction you could say that 's a proper ban . 
  in slovenia the law currently states marriage is between man and a woman . 
  something we changed a few months back to be between two people . 
  but then people got offended , there was a referendum and the law was nullified . 
  so i would n't call this a gay marriage ban , per se . 
  does n't really make a difference to all the gay people wanting to get married , but i still think there 's a difference . 
  what do you mean by ** ban ** ? 
  a proper ban , where a law says gay marriage is illegal and/or forbidden ? 
  or more like gay marriage is not possible due to some awkward phrasing in the law ? 
  yeah , i edited my post right after i submitted it when i noticed the context . 
  i agree with you . 
  people moving out is the only example ( i can think of now , there are probably more ) where the people are benefiting but the country is n't . 
  but if people benefit from it , does n't that mean its beneficial for the country as well ? 
  edit : i noticed the context was about moving to britain . 
  in which case i agree it 's not really beneficial for the country if people are moving out permanently . 
  voicing your opinion and shoving it down people 's throats are two very different things . 
  interesting . 
  considering how one of the constitutional court judges ( retired i believe ) was so sure using the army was unconstitutional in the first place . 
  so in other words , there are/were benefits in joining . 
  you say that as if there are no benefits in joining . 
  why join in the first place then ? 
  what happened with the radio dude collecting signatures against this ? 
  the slovene one should n't have the circumflex over the * o * . 
  i believe in dutch it 's called something similar . 
  spelled differently but pronounced the same . 
  which might be where czechia came from . 
  or a made up country from the arma series . 
  sure , as is the case with such things . 
  but i have n't really seen it called this often so it just sounds weird/unusual to me . 
  czechia does sound kinda weird ... 
  sounds reasonable to me .
