  at the moment it seems some would like to just let everyone in and redistribute them among members before even doing any basic checks if the immigrants are even refugees . 
  which in my opinion is idiotic . 
  what do you do with people while you 're reviewing their asylum application and are trying to determine if they are in fact refugees ? 
  what happens if it turns out they are n't ? 
  what happens when you ca n't return them to their home country for whatever reason ? 
  are you suggesting we just let everyone in and sort this mess out later , and hope for the best in the mean time ? 
  exactly . 
  can you blame them tho ? 
  i disagree . 
  immigrants keep coming regardless of the fact we have n't relocated the 160k yet . 
  so what do we do about it ? 
  just let them waltz through ? 
  this does n't appear to work for the countries they are waltzing through . 
  because like it or not , it takes resources . 
  among other problematic things . 
  close the borders ? 
  does n't appear to work for germany . 
  and let 's face it , it would be a disaster for greece . 
  * maybe * it would decrease the numbers in the long term , but in the mean time it would suck for greece . 
  turn them back to turkey ? 
  share them fairly ? 
  i think we 've already established ** fair ** is subjective . 
  at the very least the term should be defined and everyone should agree on the definition . 
  good luck on that one . 
  it took me a while , but i see what you did there ... 
  google images of the train station in bratislava still look better than the train station in ljubljana . 
  good . 
  what happens to the rest ? 
  it solves the problem from their perspective . 
  which is selfish as fuck thing to do . 
  but it 's also the only thing left to do when no one else seems to give a damn . 
   a ** fair ** sharing of the refugee burden so let 's agree what 's fair first , shall we ? 
  if you look at it , quite a few countries have the same gross and net values , so i doubt the info is really useful . 
  sounds like slovenian pm . 
  maybe they 're related . 
   large gate ? 
  ` technical obstacles ' if i 'm not mistaken . 
  our politicians are using the same expression by the way . 
  good thing austrians came up with it , otherwise we 'd have to call it a ` fence ' and we all know fences are wrong ... 
  whats up with some countries having the same gross and net values while others do n't ? 
  he did seem a bit villainous , i 'll give you this one . 
  what was it for ? 
  i bet it was n't villainous . 
  of course . 
  if you compare the poorest eu country to the poorest country in the world , the eu one is doing amazing . 
  but if you 're struggling to put food on the table and keep your home warm that little * factoid * wo n't make you any less hungry and any warmer . 
  pretty much anyone except greece could say that according to dublin . 
  because someone has bigger problems than you does n't mean your problems suddenly cease to exist . 
   can austria reclaim its lost title of the worlds most villainous country from current holder poland ? 
  no , it ca n't . 
  you have to be from eastern europe to be considered villainous . 
  it sure looks like they have no problems when they need to find some victims to get their point across . 
  that 's because everyone on reddit is a bot . 
  except you . 
  i guess it 's because he seems to be very into his looks . 
  i do n't think so . 
  but he 's often reffered to as * barbie doll * . 
  i do n't see the hypocrisy in his comment . 
  he said nothing about how this problem should n't touch his country ( at least not in the comment you replied to , he might have said it somewhere else ) , only that it 's an eu wide problem and should be handled as such . 
  you ca n't expect this to be solved by individual countries . 
  certainly not the ones on the primary route . 
   having refugees seek asylum in the first country is simply a dublin agreement concept . 
  it definitely does n't apply outside eu if i 'm not mistaken , that concept is actually from * convention and protocol relating to the status of refugees * . 
  so it would apply outside of eu . 
  what will the frigates do , when a boat with 100 immigrants starts sailing towards them ? 
  or when the boat starts sinking ? 
  so the operator must be in view . 
  makes sense . 
   without a person being there what 's * there * ? 
  drone operators are usually there . 
  it 's not like they operate them from kilometers away . 
  or is the point to physically be touching the camera ? 
  i 'm just guessing but it 's probably because they have access to places that are usually inaccessible . 
   just to sell newspapers ? 
  of course . 
  are you familiar with the expression ` when money talks , bullshit walks ' ? 
  looks like someone tried to hard to make it sound formal ? 
  which is stupid considering this is on a can of energy drink . 
  it 's just phrased in a weird way , at least to me . 
  could have just been ` pohitri/pospe \u0161i vas v trenutku ' . 
  maybe they thought that 's to close to croatian or something . 
   `` boste v trenutku hitri tudi sami '' that 's a very weird sentence if you do n't have any context . 
  it 'd confuse me as well . 
  that 's because everything is ok when * their * people do it . 
  they are n't about democracy , totalitarianism or anything like that . 
  they just want their option to be in power . 
  that 's a really common occurrence here . 
  is he trolling / r/europe too now ? 
  literal translation to english would be ` day of the dead ' , yes . 
  which sounds a bit weird in english in my opinion , but sounds fine in slovene . 
  there 's no mention of any saints or anything . 
  he did say 1/4 of our land , so i 'm sure he does . 
  obviously if antibiotic resistant bacteria emerges in the eu , they will not be allowed to pass the border to norway , because norway is not in the eu . 
   tough shit if that means you have to work 10-20 years longer . 
  the problem with his is that because you live 10 years longer you are n't necessarily physically ( or mentally ) able to work 10 years longer . 
  that 's to be expected . 
  it 's what diseases do . 
   if you have a decision between saving yourself , or saving a family of 5 with young children - then you save the family - every single time . 
  why ? 
  because the life of a child is inherently worth more than the life of an adult ?
