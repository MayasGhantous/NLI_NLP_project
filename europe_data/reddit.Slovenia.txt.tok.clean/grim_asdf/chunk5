   worry is , that the center of eu is going to end up miles from civilization we might have just stumbled upon the ultimate reason against brexit . 
   why color the whole country if we are comparing cities ? 
  because it 's comparing capital cities and there 's only one of those per country . 
  i mean , if you 're going to make a map it makes sense to color the whole map , rather than just a dot or something , where the city actually is . 
  if using a map for this kind of data makes sense is another matter . 
  i guess it looks better than a bar chart or something like that . 
  some people have a very strange definition for what 's racist . 
  and it 's usually includes some form of * you ca n't be racist towards white people * . 
  i wonder what the roi would be if i converted my house to be fully off the grid . 
  if i 'd ever broke even . 
  do n't worry , just give it time . 
  our politicians are way to busy bickering among themselves to actually do anything that might benefit us in the long term . 
  it 's only a matter of time before we end up somewhere at the bottom . 
  you wrote :  it is indeed a problem if a person or a group is forcing their own peers to do what they want . 
  is this a typo and you meant :  it is indeed a problem if a person or a group is forcing their own peers to do what they ** do n't ** want . 
  because if what you wrote is what you meant , it kinda reads as if you believe it 's impossible for a group to force their peers to do something they do n't want . 
  which is what my ` no ' was about . 
  that it can in fact happen and that it is a problem . 
  your energy would be better used replying to someone else . 
  because if you look closely you 'll notice i was never for this ban . 
  or against it . 
  the fact they are forced . 
  if they are forced . 
  which is why i 'm on the fence about this . 
  on the one hand i believe burqa has no place in europe . 
  on the other , neither does banning clothing . 
  no , it 's a problem when a woman does n't want to wear a burqa but is forced to wear one because her husband/brother/whoever is forcing her to wear one , or else ... 
   what people wear , or do n't , in most cases has very little impact on anyone else . 
  in the few cases it does , it is generally temporary and can be accommodated quite easily and reasonable . 
  the problem i have with this is you can never be sure if someone really wants to wear it . 
  or is [ forced ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xt2t2rq.jpg ) into wearing it . 
  edit : please stop replying to this comment telling me burqa ban is not a solution . 
  because i never took a stance for or against the ban . 
  i just said the only problem i personally have with this is you can never be sure if they are wearing it willingly . 
  on what scale ? 
  ems is used to express the damage done , not the magnitude . 
  and richter scale is logarithmic . 
  so the difference between 5 and 6 is a lot more than you might think at first . 
  europe should be tolerant about things that are compatible with the culture . 
  i wo n't go as far as to say islam is incompatible with europe 's culture , but certain practices by certain groups certainly are n't . 
  and those practices ( not groups ) have no place in europe . 
  do n't like it ? 
  you 're free to leave . 
   because the helium leaks at a very slow rate ( around 10 percent per year , without holes ) am i the only one thinking that 's ** not ** a slow rate ? 
  but * low quality * forests are still better than no forests , i guess ? 
  the thing is terms of service are not above the law . 
  if users agree to something in tos that 's illegal , it 's still illegal . 
  it seems reasonable to me a company denies you service , if they ca n't make you abide by tos , since parts of it might be against the law in your country . 
  but if circumventing ad blockers is illegal , it makes absolutely no difference the user agreed to something in the tos . 
  if facebook does n't like it they can block the whole service to such users . 
  what 's * overly concerned * ? 
  if you do n't want to be tracked across different sites are you really * overly concerned * with privacy ? 
  i 'd say that 's a perfectly reasonable concern . 
  i wonder how many people would use such sites if they made it perfectly clear what they are doing . 
  with a bright red window with a nice big exclamation mark and a text going something like : `` hello there !, 
  if you continue to use this site we 'll track everything we can about you and then sell this info to the higher bider . 
  or just give it away for free . '', 
  took me a while . 
  so probably not long . 
  the iphone was just an example . 
  lets replace it with a kid being bullied because the parents are poor . 
  surely you 'd consider that to be more serious , right ? 
  on the same level as bullying for having gay parents perhaps ? 
  what about this ? 
  i 'm genuinely trying to understand this bullying argument , because it was brought up constantly here as well when we had the referendum about gay marriage a while ago . 
  it just seems extremely disingenuous to me that you ( not you personally , but in general ) would consider something a problem , when it fits your agenda . 
  and then completely ignore it when it does n't . 
  bullying is either a problem , or it 's not . 
  why is bullying about gay parents such a huge problem but bullying about something else is a ` smaller problem ' that can be ignored ? 
  am i understanding you correctly and you 're saying kids from straight parents ca n't possibly get bullied for years ? 
  but kids get bullied for all kind of things . 
  like wearing glasses , or having a ` weird ' haircut . 
  or not having the latest iphone , brand name clothes ... what are we going to do about that ? 
  it 's also possible it got lost in translation . 
  or was translated in a specific way on purpose . 
  i 'm just guessing about this specific instance but i have noticed this a lot in the media . 
  things translated in a way where you ca n't really say they were mistranslated , but they end up being a lot more ... ambiguous than the original . 
  or hanlon 's razor . 
  reddit probably grabs the first image on the site it comes across . 
  and there 's an article about brexit on that site , all the way at the top . 
  neighbours are n't the only ones he posts shit about . 
  it 's also possible it just gets more reported now . 
  edit : not sure why all the downvotes . 
  it 's entirely possible the crime rate is the same but gets reported more . 
  not saying this is the case here , but it 's a possibility . 
   if you are visa'ed for one schengen country , you can visit them all but only schengen . 
  limited territorial validity visas exist . 
  i do n't know how ( un ) common they are , but they do exist . 
   you can also use your card in australia . 
  it does make sense . 
  they were in the eurovision after all . 
  she ca n't get the card to prove she has healthcare insurance . 
  which does n't mean she does n't have one . 
  but if abroad , it 's pretty similar . 
  will it ? 
  where does the electricity come from ? 
  will air pollution diminish , or will it just move to where the power plants are ? 
  not trying to argue electric cars are n't the way to go . 
  i just have a feeling it 's not as simple as some make it sound . 
  people with very little or no knowledge about the subject usually have the loudest opinions .
