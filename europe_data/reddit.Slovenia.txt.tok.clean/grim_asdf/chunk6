  there 's nothing wrong with people not knowing something . 
  no one knows everything about everything . 
  but when someone does know more about something than you , shut the hell up , listen and take notes . 
  not what usually happens with such people on these sites . 
  because it 's nice knowing how stupid people can get and that you 're not among them . 
  pretty sure that 's the point . 
  oh , have n't even noticed that one ... 
  you just made me open it in gimp to see if that 's true ... 
  if your parents own a duplex and you live in the other apartment for which you pay rent , are you still living with your parents ? 
  maybe that 's the reason . 
  maybe they think their politicians are incapable or unwilling to fix things . 
  i 'm not spanish , but i sure as hell thought that about our politicians . 
  was this also when they ` renamed ' french fries to freedom fries ? 
  i think it would fit if it was in hungarian . 
  but it 's not , so it does n't . 
  every aldi ( named hofer here ) and lidl i 've been to in slovenia has a bakery . 
  and a small section with premade food ( mostly salads , but a few other things as well ) . 
  kinda weird how different they are . 
  eh , if we absolutely had to be anschlussed by a neighbour , but we got to decide which one , i suppose austria is the way to go . 
  no offence to the other three . 
  i know . 
  but it 's kinda out of place . 
  `` my hovercraft is full of eels '' , seriously ? 
   towards what the fuck are we supposed to strive probably making rich people even richer . 
  or giving people in power even more power . 
  you know , things like that . 
  the one in the size comparison says ' * european * extremely large telescope ' , but i guess ? 
  it does n't appear on [ this ] ( https://xkcd.com/1294/ ) list . 
  would n't it be easier to remove all the plastic and such before the ship was sunk ? 
  rather than fishing it out later . 
  or will they just leave it ? 
  i thought presenting a fighter jet as if it was a new suv or an iphone was a bit ... weird , to say the least . 
  but what do i know . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen a jet presentation before , maybe this is the norm . 
  am i the only one who thinks the presentation was way over the top ? 
  what 's the * geographical definition * ? 
  i 've heard a few , so it seems there 's no consensus there either . 
  the source i used said differently , but i am no expert . 
  op probably used the same one since his quote is from there . 
  there is absolutely no difference in this context , since this is a map of * etymological origins of the names of presidents/monarchs in europe * . 
  borut is diminutive of boris and boris is of turkic origin . 
  boris pahor has absolutely nothing to do with this . 
  and i 'm not going to get dragged down to your level . 
  apparently borut is diminutive of boris , so it makes no difference . 
  chicago and la ? 
  would be interesting to see where san francisco would fit in . 
  funny how you used * they * instead of * us * and i used * it * instead of * us * . 
  it 's almost as if we do n't like ourselves either ... 
  it 's probably that a lot of people do n't know much about it so it 's not really * liked * as opposed to being hated . 
  was going to say the contact area is small with cars as well , because circles do n't have a lot of contact with flat surface . 
  but then i realized rubber exists ... 
  which has better traction and is also filled with air so the weight of the vehicle flattens it , increasing the contact surface . 
  i should drink my morning coffee in the morning , not at noon ... 
   the thing that makes trains so efficient is also what makes them unable to go uphill and stop . 
  low traction ? 
  that makes sense . 
  but to you genuinely get offended , or just uncomfortable ? 
  what about two women ? 
  and this kind of rhetoric is doing nothing but pushing moderate people into an extreme . 
  you are n't doing anyone any favours with it . 
  is the west also responsible for the ever growing number of people in these areas ? 
  would be interesting to see what the longest words would be if you ignore compound words . 
  are they collecting welfare benefits ? 
  are they paying for food , room ? 
  not us , them !, 
  [ well played ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/be/50/76/be5076d7d682c0dcf89faf9bfda5f70a.gif ), 
  if you plan on using _ emphasis _ and \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af in the same line , then you _ should _ escape both underscores . 
  might be confusing for people who do n't know what we 're trying to escape from ... 
  you 're right . 
  have n't even noticed that . 
  ~ ~ why do you need to escape the first underscore only ? ~ ~ figured it out . 
  it 's because it 's used for emphasis and you need to indicate both the start and end of it . 
  i guess you 'd have to escape both , depending on what 's in the rest of the comment . 
  maybe they drink more coffee , but it 's weaker ? 
  so they use less ? 
   \u00af _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af you dropped a \\ \\ . 
  you get it by typing two backslashes , but only one gets shown . 
  911 in this case . 
  there you go . 
  made you a favour . 
  then there 's no point in getting worked up about this . 
  known terrorists and terror suspects are two different things . 
   as a consumer i will signal the manufacturer of my displeasure by no longer buying led bulbs and will live the rest of my life in the dark . 
  or you know ... buy them from amazon.de and send your local retailer an email explaining you 're not buying from them any more because they are selling shit products . 
  that way you 're letting them know you do n't appreciate being fucked up the ass and you can still enjoy your delicious led lighting . 
  because of the brand . 
   not sure what 's uglier in this picture , the life-size lego pirate ship replica , or the architectural abortions in the background . 
  abortions ? 
  eh , it 's fine . 
  you both got the point across . 
  he was just a bit more diplomatic . 
  i think it 's the picture the tourist office for benelux countries uses . 
  so i think it 's a fair guess that is in fact amsterdam . 
  which i think is a bit disingenuous but the whole thing looks to amateurish to be official . 
  ** edit : ** yes , it 's an unofficial image someone made that ranks pretty highly on google image search , so people keep using it . 
  yes , it really should . 
   uh ... the demographic shifts . 
  what a nice way of saying what / u/kozeljko said a bit more ... 
  directly . 
  not so long ago being * married * to a person of different race was also not considered a proper marriage .
