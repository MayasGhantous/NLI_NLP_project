  times change . 
  yes . 
  if you live long enough with a partner , you get the same rights as if you were married . 
  the last time i drove past there the building on the right was still a hole in the ground . 
   i do n't know whether that theory is a thing it probably is , i 've heard it a couple of times myself . 
  not with hillary being involved , but this whole thing how drugs are basically just a conspiracy by big pharma , not to really help people but to sell more drugs . 
  i honestly could n't care less about people who decline treatment because they believe this . 
  as long as they are only harming themselves . 
  not really the case with vaccines . 
  brilliant !, 
  `` vaccines prevent diseases but the government does n't want you to know . 
  because they want you to die so they can take your land !, 
  and money !, 
  and harvest your tissues to feed the lizard people living on the inside the hollow earth ! '', 
  i * may * have taken it a bit far at the end there ... 
  they are n't just steel pipes laid in the ground . 
  they are insulated . 
  eh , could be worse . 
  i often click on slovak language on wikipedia by mistake . 
  because let 's be honest : * sloven\u0161\u010dina * and * sloven\u010dina * ... 
  unless you 're taking your time , there 's a good chance you 'll miss it . 
  mobile version has country names , desktop version has flags . 
  the flags are small and the coat of arms is even smaller . 
  so an quick glance it 's hard to tell them apart . 
   if they would analyze them , it wo n't be happening on your phone why not ? 
  the app could only be looking for certain keywords in text messages and just reporting back what keywords it found . 
  with that kind of vague wording it 's impossible to say anything about what they are really doing . 
  well , the part she is sitting on is . 
  if / u/truspace is correct about where this was taken . 
  if you can afford an iphone then maybe you do n't need * financial * help is what i assume he 's saying . 
  but i ca n't be sure because he deleted his comment . 
   \u00d6sterwenien i like it . 
  let 's do it !, 
  not sure about the name ... 
  but i 'm all for it . 
   so we 're probably not going to invade any time soon you know ... 
  if the language was n't an issue i think you 'd just have to ask . 
   we do n't want them anymore anyhow . 
  i think it looks kinda cute ... 
  i know the difference between bits and bytes . 
  however mb/s is not megabytes per second . 
  bytes use upper case b. 
  as does mega , but that is n't the ambiguous part because i 'm pretty sure he 's not talking about millibytes . 
  which means i 'm still not sure what he 's talking about . 
  because 30 megabits per second is quite a bit less than 6 megabytes per second . 
  which is why i 'm thinking the provider is advertising 30 mbps but he 's getting 6 to 8mbps . 
  but since he switched from writing it as mbps to mb/s , i was n't sure . 
   30mbps ( like 6-8mb / s ) not sure what you 're saying . 
  are they advertising it as 30 mbps but you can realistically get around 6 to 8 mbps , or what ? 
   we 'd finally get some serious coastline that 's an interesting way of looking at it . 
  another way could be the italians are just getting back what used to be theirs . 
  and a bit extra . 
   minorities have been systemically way more fucked by racial discrimination than majority populations . 
  of course they have . 
  i 'm not disputing that . 
  i 'm just saying a member of ** any ** race can be racist . 
  and that your initial definition of racism by which only members of majority population can be racist is pure and utter bullshit . 
  do n't worry , there are n't any to follow . 
  these people are serious . 
  so let me get this straight . 
  if i refuse to hire a person because i do n't like his race that 's only racism if i 'm white and he 's pretty much anything else than white . 
  but if i 'm black and the other person is white , then it 's not racism ? 
  what it is then ? 
  and is the latter more acceptable somehow ? 
   but you ca n't be racist towards white people . 
  not sure if serious or sarcastic ... 
   sexism against men that 's just the thing . 
  sexism against men does n't exist in * their * eyes . 
  similarly how some think you ca n't be a racist if you 're black . 
   already works well today , you enter the vehicle and are asked if everything is clean , if not the previous user will be charged . 
  so you can get in the vehicle , immediately ( by accident of course ) drop your coffee and blame it on the previous guy and have him pay the cleaning bill ? 
  some [ do ] ( http://premier-adria.si/userfiles/superfeed/annonymous/0704d5b1-22ab-4e14-9b74-d6dacb51344e.jpg ) , some [ do n't ] ( https://img.rtvslo.si/_up/upload/2014/11/10/65160497_photo_413654_20141110_4.jpg ) . 
  it took me quite a while to find a picture of a vehicle that does . 
  we use a lot of different brands for cop cars and it seems to depend on whether they found the space for it , or not . 
  you 're free to organize a parade for people who like having sex with the opposite gender . 
  or a parade for people who like eating carrots or whatever . 
  it 's not like gay people are the only ones allowed to have parades . 
  it 's just that they seem to be the only ones who care enough to go through the trouble of organizing it . 
  well , we are culturally much closer to austria than we are to serbia or bosnia . 
  apart from the language . 
   so it 's a necessary evil , i guess why exactly is it evil ? 
  i live just far enough out of town so going to the shops requires me to drive . 
  as such i try to buy enough groceries in one go to last me at least a week , if not more . 
  and ideally i 'll do the shopping on the days i 'm at the office , so i can do it on my way going home , rather than doing the trip just to go shopping . 
   idk why we do what we do ... because money ... 
  could n't care less . 
   adhd is n't real , you just need to learn to focus better yes , and the solution to depression is to ** just be happy !, 
  the vegrad one does sound familiar . 
  i 'm sure the same is true for slavic ones ( at least it is for slovene ) . 
  i was n't aware it 's that common . 
  we have/had slaves ? 
   half-island peninsula ... 
  i know this is completely off topic , i just found it interesting you called it that . 
  i guess the fear is if you 're located in another country ( as is the property you 're mortgaging ) there might be trouble in case you stop paying the bills . 
  or the cross-country collecting might be more trouble that it 's worth . 
  what passive/aggressive behaviour , what aggressive tone ? 
  you have explained what you think , but i 'm trying to understand ** why ** . 
  you have n't explained that ( in my opinion ) . 
  does n't matter now , do n't really give a shit any more . 
  what agenda ?
