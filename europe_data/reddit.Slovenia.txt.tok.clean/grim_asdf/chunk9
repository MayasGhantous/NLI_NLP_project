  do whatever you want with it because i 'm not drinking it . 
  i said ` no ' and you poured it anyway . 
  they got the hint . 
  it 's kinda rude i guess . 
  but forcing people to drink alcohol when they clearly do n't is way beyond rude in my opinion anyway . 
  people with different political views getting along in slovenia ? 
  how cute . 
  people do n't get along and it 's a problem . 
  it 's bad because people will not vote for * their guy * but vote against * the other guy * . 
  i guess that would work in a two party system , but it really does n't here . 
  the result is we keep getting the same shit from the same cesspool voted into the parliament over and over again . 
  because people do n't really care who gets in , as long as it 's not * the other guys * . 
  which is exactly what happens , because * the other guys * are doing the exact same thing . 
   it probably depends on your circle of friends . 
  it really does . 
  none of my friends would think twice if i said ` no thanks ' to beer and ask for a glass of water . 
  going to a neighbourhood bbq is always a struggle and full of weird looks . 
  because you know ... juice is for kids , adults get beer and hard liquor . 
  do n't know how this translates to the whole country though . 
  depends on where exactly you are , i guess . 
  no , it 's all-or-nothing type deal . 
  either you take everything or you get nothing . 
  you know what ? 
  just take everything back . 
  it 's fine , really . 
  `` were you born with a tail '' if you do n't close doors . 
  sorry for making a bad joke . 
  i hope i have n't ruined your day ... 
  yay , consumer culture !, 
  what 's the difference between czech and slovak ? 
  possibly a free foreign language ? 
   basic danish education ** learns ** you 3 languages teaches ... 
  i do n't know why exactly , but that made me laugh . 
  i hold the socket with the other hand . 
  did n't always do that , but then i managed to pull the socket out of the wall ... 
  maybe not downright dumb , but definitely strange . 
  considering how english is present everywhere and a pretty easy language to learn , at least on a basic level . 
  you 'd have to be pretty weird or just plain stubborn not to know at least the basics . 
  my grandmother 's place has no cell coverage . 
  so that ? 
  superhero that personifies ? 
  i do n't think there 's a superhero that bitches and whines all the time but ultimately does nothing about the things ( s ) he bitches about . 
  that 's because dutch jokes are usually pretty flat . 
  i 'll see myself out ... 
  come on , the dating one is pretty damn stupid ... 
  the other ones are ok . 
  of course not . 
  food is reserved for dates and as americans are well aware , we do n't date in europe . 
  you should build another apartment above yours in all that extra space , and rent it to a midget . 
   only con of nutering/spaying is that they get fat easily . 
  just teach them how to smoke . 
   but it 's a lot easier if the dog is neutered . 
  not neutering/spaying a dog is n't reponsible either . 
  i never said it 's not easier . 
  or that it 's irresponsible to neuter/spay your dog . 
  i was n't even arguing against it . 
  i just find unwanted pregnancy a strange primary reason ( op said that 's the primary reason for it ) . 
  because that should n't even be an issue as far as i 'm concerned . 
  obviously you have a different opinion and that 's fine . 
  your opinion is just as valid . 
   low ceilings ( 2.5 m ) is n't the * standard * today 2.4 m ? 
  i get what you 're saying and i agree . 
  i 'm just saying if you have a dog making sure it does n't run around unsupervised is only part of the deal . 
  the other is making sure nothing can get to your dog either . 
   people in the countryside do n't have fences around their houses and do n't keep eyes on their dogs all the time . 
  my folks live in the countryside , have a fence around their house and keep an eye on the dog all the time . 
  as do about half of their neighbours , who are also responsible dog owners . 
  the other half are just dicks who let their dogs wander free ... 
  which is why the half that gives two shits about their pets makes extra sure they are safe when behind the fence of their own house . 
  which is obviously unacceptable in my opinion and owners of such dogs ca n't be considered responsible by any stretch of the imagination . 
  on the other hand , if you have a female dog and ca n't make sure that does n't happen , well ... not sure you can be considered responsible either . 
  it 's not like they are in heat every day of the year . 
   prevent unwanted pregnancies putting all other benefits aside ... do you just let your dog hump everyone ? 
  or allow everyone to hump your dog ? 
  because i really do n't see how this is an issue for any responsible dog owner . 
  unless you let your dog roam around unsupervised . 
  but then you 're not a responsible dog owner . 
  well , i 'm subscribed to outsidexbox and whatculture ( both are from uk ) and kurzgesagt ( german , probably ? ) . 
  not sure if it fits your definition , as they are channels with multiple people , rather than one individual . 
  no , not that one , the other one . 
  from the other ireland . 
  never scroll into the comment section on a news site , ** ever ** . 
  pretty sure that 's how you get cancer . 
  pretty popular . 
  the commercial radios seem to all work of the same playlist that has it on it . 
  if i listen to the same station for my entire workday , i 'll hear the same 10 songs over and over and over . 
  was just reading an article about this yesterday that said we 're happier now than some time ago ( ca n't remember the specifics and ca n't be arsed to do a search ) . 
  i made the mistake and scrolled a bit to far , down to the comment section . 
  i got the impression the whole country is seconds away from committing the biggest mass suicide in history . 
  most * heat lovers * i know are people who 's only contact with the heat is the weather app on their phone . 
  they move their ass from their air-conditioned apartment , via their air-conditioned car , to their air-conditioned office . 
  and then back again . 
  and then talk about how it 's summer and temperatures should be above 35 \u00b0 at all times . 
  because they took the garbage out that one evening and thought it was n't that bad . 
  people like that should just fuck off . 
  i really do n't like the heat , so i would n't mind if the summers would be just a bit cooler . 
  or at least with periods where it cools down a bit . 
   so what do citizens of your country constantly complain about that has become rather annoying to hear over and over again ? 
  every damn thing , all the damn time . 
  it 's our favourite pass time .
