  you seem to have an issue on a different level that has little to do with this specific fact of the law . 
  free legal aid is one of the cornerstones of any free society . 
  are you suggesting anyone unable of paying for defense should not have one ? 
  every democratic society provides you with an attorney in that case . 
  the scandinavian countries are doing a lot of things right for a long time and peoples general fondness of their policies and results of those policies has merit especially since we now increasingly reevaluate our systems and priorities worldwide . 
  i completely understand and agree with what you 're arguing here . 
  it 's the demand and the laws that 's the problem , but i 'd say there 's a lot of demand in spain as well so you 're not exempt from the participating . 
  it 's very unlucky for you geographically to be where you are , so you have to live with the consequences , but i do n't feel anyone was judging you in comparison , same as i did n't see any cock sucking of the scandinavian states on this issue at the top of the comments . 
  i mistakenly thought it was meant to somehow be a counter argument . 
  thanks for the additional info, 
  ok , what is your point ? 
  i never said they were the same just that yugoslavia was very different from both . 
  i also never argued that china is still communist in anything but its ' name . 
  not post communist but post socialist . 
  it 's an incredibly common mistake but not that innocent . 
  yugoslavia was very different from russia or china in it 's structure and everyday reality . 
  sfrj or socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . 
  there are more beautiful but secluded places in slovenia .

  pride is n't something people hide . 
  i 'd say that 's debatable . 
  anyway i understand your interpretation but i 'll stick with mine . 
  i feel it 's not my place to be proud of other people 's achievements . 
  since it 's inwardly directed i 'd say being involved in those actions or achievements is mandatory in order for you to be allowed to be proud of them . 
  from wikipedia :  pride is an ** inwardly ** directed emotion that carries two common meanings . 
  with a negative connotation , pride refers to an inflated sense of one 's personal status or accomplishments , often used synonymously with hubris . 
  with a positive connotation , pride refers to a satisfied sense of attachment toward one 's own or another 's choices and actions , or toward a whole group of people , and is a product of praise , independent self-reflection , or a fulfilled feeling of belonging . 
  so no . 
  you ca n't be pride of other people unless :  someone who 's good virtues or actions are a consequence of my involvement, 
  i ca n't help but think this question , while well intended , is misguided in it 's assumption that we have something to be proud about as individuals of a group of people that really has nothing to do with us and is since long gone . 
  i find many achievements and sacrifices of many people or groups admirable but i can only be proud of myself , i feel . 
  so i admire a lot of people and a lot of groups for a lot of different reasons . 
  some of them include people living in the same countries as i and my predecessors . 
  most , however , probably live far away . 
  i ca n't really answer a question like that in any real measure since i do n't agree with the premise that i have the right to be proud of anyone but myself or someone who 's good virtues or actions are a consequence of my involvement . 
  having said that . 
  my country did n't really exist until 22 years ago and in light of all the recent revelations and the neo-liberal connections of our `` liberators '' i can hardly say i admire them . 
  i do admire my grandfather for having fought , against all odds , the nazis because he believed in his cause even after being shot . 
  i admire my father for not running away 22 years ago and not using his position to get himself away from the front lines and instead waited at the border for an attack from the yugoslav army . 
  i admire many people that did the same . 
  many people in our country ( or any other ) , however , did not . 
  i can understand their hesitation in the time of crisis but their decision was still the wrong one and they were still a part of the same group . 
  i feel no need to be proud of my country . 
  i love my country for the many little reasons that are hard to explain and should not be grouped together to create some fantasy . 
  i think that way of thinking is not only unnecessary but also harmful . 
  ** slovenia ** it 's the height of the summer so a lot of people are on vacations and the news is slow . 
  a law prohibiting loud speakers at protests , expanding police powers to hunt down protesters 2km from where the protests are going on and the fines raised to 4.000 - 21.000 eur has been proposed and should have been voted on while `` everyone 's '' away was thankfully put aside for now , which is surprising . 
  the president of the largest opposition party claimed at one of his rallies that a silent cue has happened to overturn him ( he 's been charged in many cases and has been accused of corruption by the anti corruption commission . 
  protests followed and then he was impeached ) . 
  so business as usual . 
  the fact this needs to be said is pretty scarry . 
  had we been born in their shoes we would have done the same and found ourselves in the same situation . 
  they are seeking opportunities , not favors . 
  and many times the reason they do n't find any at home is because of exploitation of the developed nations . 
  op meant tweets , he made a mistake and corrected it . 
  is there something i 'm missing . 
  is there a play on words here ? 
  i 'd say that 's the case because there is no real challenger . 
  if someone was to post detailed but understandable plans of their policies and would communicate that efficiently everyone else would look like an amateur . 
  but since nobody is doing that everybody can get away with hyping the pr story instead of the actual content . 
  also , mostly that 's because the content is really not so much in favor of the people as it is in favor of other interests so the content could harm your agenda to begin with . 
  it really should n't . 
  all you would get is short meaningless pr statements . 
  what they should do is have all ministers write monthly mandatory online report where they in detail recap the work done in the past month and how that fits into the overall picture or progress of a program outlined by the government at the beginning of a mandate . 
  i find it ridiculous that with such ease of access and publishing this is not yet a thing or something that voters would demand . 
  * edit : so it 's twits , not tweets . 
  i 'll leave my comment since i think this is worth mentioning seeing how much our governments like to communicate through popular channels *, 
  in light of recent revelations and the eerily soft response from european governments i think it 's not unwarranted to speculate that the establishment sees the people as a threat and that these statements do hold more to them than they appear at first . 
  so was she talking about gdr or nsdap when she made this statement ? 
   because she 's on an election campaign and her ghost writers obviously think reminding people that they would be f * cked without her party has to be part of that . 
  are other parties considered as a threat to freedom of expression or something ? 
   reacting to the opposition at the stage . 
  she could have promised free beer and hugs for everyone and still would have been booed ( well , for the latter maybe ) but saying '' ** just ** be happy that you can express your opinion '' really does suggest that you should see that as a privilege . 
  i 'm not trying to see it for more than it is , but if our pm would say that i would be very uncomfortable . 
  i really do see it as , `` be happy we have n't taken that right away '' . 
  the more i think about it the more i see it as a threat . 
  a quick question , just to confirm . 
  the context was such that she in no way meant that people should be happy to be able to express their opinion in regards to government actions today ( as if that 's a privilege in a modern democratic society not a standard ) and was merely making a reference to wwii germany ? 
  if that 's the case , what was the context ? 
  and why does that need to be said at all by a representative of the people ? 
  of course they should be allowed to . 
  i think they/we should choose not to . 
  i 'm sorry for the confusion , i thought that much was clear . 
  well i had the opposite experience with croats to that with serbs . 
  while not too happy about it they/you saw it as inevitable . 
  the 66 % was not surprising to me . 
  i ca n't get past the fact that this will just provide cheap workforce and opportunity to exploit for the rest of wealthy europe . 
  i 'm not sure these nations are ready to enter such a union . 
  i 'm not anti eu but i think a nation should have some interim period to establish itself firmly before it jumps blindly and naively into such a union . 
  i accept that . 
  regardless , i still feel like my experience is a little relevant here . 
  also , personal experience is the only experience anyone can really go by . 
  polls are useful but i really would n't want people to abandon personal experiences when they doubt the proposed statistic . 
  that would/does make it too easy to manipulate public opinion by manipulating statistics . 
  you can change the results quite a bit just by rephrasing the question . 
   the poll was organized in connection to the intensification of serbia 's european integration the people making the poll were clearly in favor of a high eu result . 
  as a side note . 
  i have a lot of friends from serbia and have met plenty of people there . 
  so i 'm not talking about one or two people 's opinions . 
  i 'm surprised and slightly doubtful about the 53 % supporting eu membership .
