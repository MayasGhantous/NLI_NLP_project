   even the study itself found only 35 % products with some actual difference . 
  35 % differed in texture and/or composition . 
  the rest were identical in composition but more expensive in the czech republic , some were both more expensive and of inferior quality .

  why are you asking me this ? 
  again , i loathe berlusconi , but i think it 's an exaggeration to act like he destroyed the italian economy . 
  he did n't do anything to address its weaknesses , but that 's a statement that applies to 75 % of italy 's prime ministers . 
  he was a typical european right-wing pm - lots of promises , nothing done . 
  on the other hand , i have a lot of faith that trump will find very inventive ways to fuck up every aspect of his job . 
  because german labour unions suck, 
  labour productivity is a measure of the amount of goods and services that a worker produces in an hour . 
  by definition labour productivity is about the worker . 
  using physical force to train a dog is a really terrible idea , too , genius . 
  moreover dog training involves lots of repetition and specific signals that the dog is supposed respond to with a certain action , ideally in a controlled environment . 
  all a 2-year-old is going to take away from you hitting him after he/she grabbed at something they should n't have is that they 've just been hit . 
  unless you 're going to coax them to repeatedly grab at the same thing so you can hit them each time . 
  which would be idiotic parenting . 
   the german export industry has high wages . 
  its the domestic service sector that has lower . 
  that 's typical of all economies as labour productivity in service jobs is typically much lower , but that 's not the issue . 
  the issue is that [ wage growth in the german manufacturing sector has lagged far behind general german wage growth ] ( https://www.voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/frommay2014/bofingerfig1.png )  weakening the german export industry might also harm the rest of europe since it will reduce european exports to the rest of the world . 
  americans wont buy a non-existant greek high tech product but a japanese one you 're acting like germany is the only country in europe with a manufacturing sector . 
  like , come on . 
   why are wages a government issue ? 
  because they can be a source fo unwanted macroeconomic imbalances . 
   neither of those graphs show what happened before 2000 . 
  the eurozone was established in 1999 , hence the cut-off date but [ here 's one that goes back to 1991 ] ( https://www.voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/frommay2014/bofingerfig1.png ), 
   that assumes that the productivity comes from the worker and not the company/workflow . 
  by productivity , i of course mean `` labour productivity '' , i thought that was obvious from the context . 
   so you want germany to have a higher unemployement ? 
  i do n't wish it but it 's inevitable unless the german government passes structural reforms . 
  currently the german economy relies too on eurozone divergence to create competitive advantage ( which makes german exports artificially cheap ) instead of investing in r&d or boosting productivity , which is not sustainable in the long term because the eurozone will either break up or the rest of the eurozone will reach german levels of unit labour costs relative to productivity , which will erase germany 's competitiveness and lead to higher unemployment in germany . 
  [ addressed here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bfr45/imf_urges_germany_to_hike_wages_and_invest/dhmgy2g/ ), 
  again , [ practically every other major eurozone economy has already made substantial structural reforms ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-er6qxkbbefi/wffhovwsoni/aaaaaaaatnq/fxyz0rqzzrwxzsisjhkikvbdtalkkmiigclcb/s1600/adjustment%2bis%2bnot%2bhappening%2byet%252c%2bulc%252c%2bchart%2bmorgan%2bstanley%252c%2bdec%2b17%252c%2b2016.png ) that have essentially already produced the desired outcome and have , by the way , come at an enormous political , economic and social cost . 
  there are only 4 possible scenarios for the future : * germany adjusts through policy measures and meets the rest of the eurozone halfway ; this involves some political risk for the german government and some economic cost as german unemployment rises by a couple percentage points and certain export-oriented sectors lose steam - on the other hand , german workers get a pay rise and the rest of the eurozone maintains the same wage levels and reduces unemployment ; * germany makes no immediate adjustments and the rest of the eurozone continues to pursue internal devaluation ( slashing wages and prices to catch up with germany ) , the end result of which is the same as with scenario 1 ( germany sees rising unemployment and diminishing exports when the rest of the eurozone finally catches up ) , except it takes a couple more years , involves a lot more political risk in the rest of the eurozone and leaves everyone , including germany , much worse off than scenario 1 ; * the eurozone breaks up , which again ends up the same as scenarios 1 and 2 ( germany loses its export advantage due to its new appreciated currency , leading to higher unemployment ) , only that the adjustment happens practically overnight and is much more painful ; or * germany makes no reforms and instead forms a transfer union with the rest of the eurozone , allowing it to keep its competitive advantage in exchange for funding the rest of eurozone 's deficits . 
  that 's it , those are the only possible scenarios . 
  why ? 
  because germany 's current competitive advantage is ** artificial ** and ** unsustainable ** . 
  there is no way around it . 
  either everything stays the same and you keep the rest of the eurozone afloat through fiscal transfers or you reform your economy in order to converge with the rest of the eurozone ( either voluntarily and in a controlled manner or involuntarily and chaotically ) . 
  to my mind , scenario 1 is clearly the least painful one , but the german people are free to make their own choices . 
  just do n't have any illusions that the current situation can go on for much longer and that germany will be able to emerge out of the fallout unscathed . 
  * not italian * i hate berlusconi with every fibre of my being * i 'm not saying he was great for the italian economy , he was mediocre at best * but italian economic woes are to be blamed on the public debt the italian governments took on in the 1980s at insane interest rates that forced successive governments into permanent austerity to pay the interest on that debt italy has had to run very high successive [ primary surpluses since the early 1990s ] ( http://blogs.ft.com/ftdata/files/2016/05/italian_fiscal_balance-line_chart-ft-web-themelarge-600x396.png ) ( = austerity ) in order to stabilise public finances . 
  this has obviously been terrible for economic growth but if we 're being objective , these problems are legacy issues that were neither caused nor exacerbated by berlusconi . 
  [ wages make up a lion 's share of unit labour costs . 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/thumb/f/f7/estimated_hourly_labour_costs%2c_2016_%28eur%29_yb17.png/777px-estimated_hourly_labour_costs%2c_2016_%28eur%29_yb17.png ), 
  every time i get into these discussions on reddit some german tries the `` it ca n't be done because it 's too complicated '' argument . 
  you think there are no other countries with federal structures and structurally disadvantaged regions ? 
  yet they have found ways to adjust . 
  agenda 2010 clearly shows germany , too , is capable of far-reaching labour-market reforms . 
  the problem is that the german government refuses to consider the necessary reforms because it cares more about its own short-term survival/the survival of their respective parties than it does about the long-term viability of the system . 
  but the longer germany puts off what needs to be done , the more severe the correction will need to be when it happens and the more unstable this entire currency area becomes . 
  nobody wants the breakup of the eurozone , but the completely irresponsible conduct of the german government is unnecessarily dragging out the crisis . 
  i 'm not saying this to be mean , but this `` no can do , figure something else out '' attitude is toxic . 
  he 's attempting a comeback so expect more of this in the future, 
  to be fair to both , trump has n't had the time to implode the american economy yet and italy 's woes predate berlusconi by at least a decade . 
  he did n't cause them ( if anything he is the product of italy 's economic troubles rather than the other way around ) and he did n't actually make them a whole lot worse . 
  [ here 's one that goes up to 2016 and clearly shows german ~ ~ wages ~ ~ unit labour costs being over 10 percentage points off the 2000 baseline ] ( https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-er6qxkbbefi/wffhovwsoni/aaaaaaaatnq/fxyz0rqzzrwxzsisjhkikvbdtalkkmiigclcb/s1600/adjustment%2bis%2bnot%2bhappening%2byet%252c%2bulc%252c%2bchart%2bmorgan%2bstanley%252c%2bdec%2b17%252c%2b2016.png ) while everybody but italy dropped back to the 2000 baseline by 2013 . 
  germany continues to be the absolute outlier and has done very little to ameliorate the situation because your government refuses to even consider this discrepancy a problem . 
  the german government is barred from setting wages directly , but there are many policy tools that would push employers in the right direction ( increasing the minimum wage , which increases wages across the board , reforming hartz iv so that people are no longer pushed into extremely low-paying/underpaying jobs en masse and instead are given more options to retrain , increasing public investment ( in infrastructure , green tech etc ) ) . 
   additionally it must be asked whether much if any of that would not end up on the already existing german savings accounts . 
  the german saver stereotype is just that - a stereotype . 
  [ 40 % of germans have essentially no savings to speak of ] ( http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2017-01/vermoegensungleichheit-verteilung-soziale-ungleichheit-fratzschers-verteilungsfragen ) and [ 9 % of german households are in debt ] ( https://www.boeckler.de/107575_107592.htm ) . 
  you would just need to make sure wage increases are disproportionately high on the low end of the scale ( e.g. 
  by raising the minimum wage ) and you would see an increase in public consumption immediately as low-income people would finally be able to afford larger purchases that they had been holding off on due to the lack of funds ( cars , household appliances , vacations , clothing , replacing worn or broken items , school items for the kids ) , using more services ( going to the hairdresser 's more frequently , eating out more etc ) , spending more on regular purchases ( buying higher-quality food and household items instead of the cheapest thing on the shelf ) etc. 
  you personally may be doing well enough that you can afford to save any wage increases but there are literally millions of germans who could really use that money . 
  as the graph shows , spain greece and italy already course-corrected . 
  germany has n't . 
  in terms of immigration incentives , there 's stuff like diversity lottery visas that are capped by region and exclude countries like china and mexico ... although that 's more an attempt to diversify immigration than encourage immigration from a particular set of countries, 
   are they seriously suggesting that companies would raise wages ( and thus voluntarily make themselves less competitive and less profitable ) just because it might be better for the development of some eu countries ? 
  no , they 're suggesting that * the german government * pass policies conducive to wage growth . 
  not necessarily . 
  raising wages should technically lead to higher unemployment in germany and lower unemployment in the rest of the eurozone , which should reduce the incentives to emigrate in the first place ( many people prefer jobs closer to home even if they 're paid less , the problem is that in many places it 's currently impossible to get a job ) as ewll as for immigrating to germany specifically ( because it 'll be harder to get a job there ) . 
  but the rebalancing would take several years where the problem might get worse before it got better . 
   hourly labor costs in germany are higher than in spain ( as is to be expected really ) . 
  unit labour costs should be higher in germany because german productivity is higher ( obviously a worker who creates twice as much value than another worker can and should be compensated higher ) . 
  the problem is that relative to the value they create , german workers get to take home a smaller proportion of it than spanish workers . 
  [ germany has completely decoupled from the rest of the eurozone in terms of compensating workers relative to their productivity ] ( https://makronom.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/servaas-storm_ulc_nominal-wages.jpg ) . 
  this looks good in macroeconomics reports , but is n't actually good for the average german . 
  for your level of productivity ? 
  [ yes , they 're abnormally low ] ( https://snbchf.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/17-mod-ulc-germany-greece-spain-france-italy1.jpg ) . 
  german workers are being massively ripped off since they create much more value than they 're getting compensated for . 
   the idea that you can watch or control your kids all the time is ridiculous . 
  that 's why you put them in a safe confined space ( a playpen , highchair etc ) that allows you to momentarily turn your back on them knowing that they wo n't be able to fucking * get electrocuted * . 
   they 're too young to understand an explanation of why they should n't do it , then a light smack is perfectly reasonable . 
  why the fuck would you hit them when they 're too young to understand cause and effect ? 
  they 're not going to be able to associate tugging on a cable with being hit , they 're going to associate their parent with being hit . 
  they 're too young to understand that that particular string-like thing can kill them but their toy on a string wo n't . 
  ** you 're ** the adult , it 's your job to babyproof the house and keep them away of dangerous objects . 
  sure , toddlers sometimes do unexpected shit and do something dangerous anyway but your job in that situation is to remove them from that situation , thank the lord they 're okay and make sure it never happens again . 
  then strap your kid in a highchair . 
  it 's not that difficult . 
  might have something to do with early childhood education and care . 
  germany famously has a chronic shortage of creches and nursery schools whereas the situation in belgium seems much less dire ( there are pretty long waiting lists but the overall share of small children in childcare programmes seems to be substantially higher ) .
