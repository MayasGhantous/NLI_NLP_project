  read the rest of the thread, 
  `` imperial empire '' are there non-imperial empires ? 
  1000 is plenty if you have a representative sample . 
  this study has a self-selecting sample and i do n't see any indication that the final average was weighed for age/gender/socioeconomic status etc. 
  again , depends on the motivation . 
  did they endorse the charity fund as an attempt to humanise themselves ? 
  then no . 
  did they endorse the charity fund because a board member is a white supremacist ? 
  then yes . 
  `` people like me '' ? 
  no , by my logic ,  the nazis think endorsing mickey mouse is beneficial to their cause they may endorse a cartoon mouse for purely strategic reasons or because their analysis of the situation is wrong , but there is still some type of motivation behind the decision to endorse that is worth looking into . 
  with navalny , he has courted nationalists all his political career - that may or may not have influenced sputnik & pogrom 's decision to endorse . 
  no but it does mean the nazis think endorsing mickey mouse is beneficial to their cause, 
  correct , pretty much everyone in luxembourg is at least trilingual because their kindergartens are luxembourgish , their primary schools are taught in german , high schools are german/french and uni is french . 
  plus most learn english as well, 
  i have two functioning hands , i do n't need a cleaner, 
  most countries on this map had [ extremely small sample sizes ] ( https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7790896/preview/7790896/preview.jpg?private_link=730b15bec39c1908cb31 ) , i doubt you could make a map for africa that did n't have most countries greyed out due to a lack of responses, 
  we hate each other more than we hate black people, 
  i think part of the statistical difference is down to what 's considered `` leaving the parental household '' by a country 's statistical office . 
  here in slovenia , when students move out to go to college , their place is registered as a `` temporary residence '' and their parents ' place is still listed as their `` primary residence '' so it would n't be reflected in the statistics as `` having left your parent 's place '' . 
  judging by your description , it 's different in the nordics . 
  basically [ he was demoted in 2011 for failing to stem the anti-government protests ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/world/europe/putin-takes-another-swipe-at-russian-protesters.html ) and [ then outright fired ( officially he resigned but you know how these things go ) in 2013 over the skolkovo scandal ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/world/europe/vladislav-surkov-putins-domestic-policy-aide-is-ousted.html ) . 
  he apparently still personally advises putin in some capacity but since 2011 , he has had very little influence on overall political strategy . 
  here are a couple of articles talking about it : http://akarlin.com/2013/05/surkov-fired-for-bolotnaya/ ( this is a translation of a vedomosti article ) http://www.interpretermag.com/why-vladislav-surkov-was-fired/ i also recommend [ this article by marlene laruelle ] ( https://www.academia.edu/28713012/_the_izborsky_club_or_the_new_conservative_avant-garde_in_russia_the_russian_review_75_no._4_2016_626-644 ) ( she is a russian studies scholar whose work is actually really on point most of the time ) , which talks about the rivalry between surkov and the izborsky club . 
  the latter won out , which explains the kremlin 's turn towards conservatism and eurasianism since 2011 . 
   tensions have flared up in the last 3-4 years . 
  no this is patrick, 
  vladislav surkov does n't play that huge of a role in the administration anymore , he was demoted after the 2011 protests ( reportedly putin was furious with him ) . 
  point taken , but vardarska on its own just sounds weird to me, 
  she kicked her father out of the party in an attempt to clean up her party 's image and disassociate it from anti-semitism . 
  jalkh 's appointment suggests her efforts were less than thorough . 
  also this piece is worth of discussion because of [ this ] ( https://twitter.com/bfmtv/status/857520870620897280 ) if not anything else, 
  yeah that 's pretty common everywhere, 
  vardarska is an adjective , it 's like calling greece `` the hellenic '' . 
  i do n't see thessaloniki mentioned anywhere in my comment or the tweet, 
  did i say in croatia ? 
  albanians made up over 25 % of the population according to the 2002 census and there 's no way their numbers have fallen , especially not to 17 % . 
  consider the following : * a disproportionate share of albanians is underage and so ca n't vote in the first place * as mentioned , voter turnout is much lower in albanian areas * albanian parties got 23 % of the vote in 2008 , so the drop in voter share is probably due with the dissatisfaction with their parties rather than anything else, 
  you ca n't infer the albanian population size from the election results , voter turnout is much lower in albanian areas and not everyone votes along ethnic lines, 
   and what the fuck was their fucking police doing the whole time ??? 
  [ rehydrating ] ( https://twitter.com/seirdotmk/status/857662815435358208 ), 
  probably russia does n't exactly mind instability , but i very much doubt there was any sort of direct russian involvement . 
  vmro are just facing the prospect of losing power and having many of its members prosecuted for corruption . 
  they 've grown increasingly desperate since the election , they even got ted fucking cruz ( lmao ) to complain to the us secretary of state about how soros was secretly controlling the opposition . 
   do they deny parties from member states from joining them ? 
  yes they 're under no obligation to take everyone in & have the power to throw out anyone who misbehaves, 
  currently albanian is only the administrative language in municipalities where over 20 % of the population is albanian . 
  albanians argue that the threshold is too high , that the data used is outdated ( the last census was 15 years ago and the albanian population has grown since ) and that albanians should have the right to communicate with the authorities in their mother tongue regardless of where they live . 
  furthermore recognising albanian as an official language would be a symbolic gesture of recognition that albanians are an integral part of the country . 
  [ us embassy condemns violence , backs the election of xhaferi as legitimate ] ( https://twitter.com/usembassymkd/status/857690559842050048 ), 
  probably just a macedonian nationalist that attended meetings/training camps with croatian nationalists ( would be my guess ), 
  vmro is pro-nato and an epp member , they 're just corrupt af & will stop at nothing to stay in power, 
  [ 200 cars , 6 busses , 150 vans counted approaching skopje only from 1 direction .

  [ gruevski was meeting the secretary-general of the austrian people 's party when this went down . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/dbchslr/status/857685971093114880 ) how awkward for them . 
  i know , right ? 
  not to mention oettinger , tajani , forza italia ( when it existed ) , epp is a cesspool . 
  no , they were invited to apply by verhofstadt 's circle ( obviously not officially but there had already been a written agreement prepared but then alde members revolted ) ( [ this is a relatively good appraisal of the situation , it mentions the agreement and gives background to the situation ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/guy-verhofstadt-bridge-too-far-alde-5-star-movement-beppe-grillo-european-parliament/ ) ), 
  albanians did n't start this, 
  i just want to point out that vmro is an epp associate member, 
  did you find that in a fortune cookie ? 
  because vmro is trying to start shit, 
  we 're talking about treaty violations in general , not just article 7 violations, 
  why does someone always come into macedonia posts looking to start shit like this ? 
  we 've been over this a million times , this post is about a serious matter and you 're not even from the area , so gtfo, 
  [ this is what they did to him ] ( https://twitter.com/whitegandalfthe/status/857657277599416322 ), 
  it very nearly happened in 2001 , so anything 's possible . 
  i do n't think she ever even officially met or interacted with varoufakis . 
   if the values have been codified into law we will be able to point at the law orban has broken , and bring it to court ... or we wont because he 's not violating the law . 
  there have been plenty of provisions in eu treaties and accords that member states have repeatedly and deliberately broken ( the fiscal compact comes to mind ) and still were n't punished because it was n't politically expedient . 
  spain got away with breaking the deficit rule pretty much solely because sch\u00e4uble lobbied commissioners not to enforce fines on his buddy rajoy . 
  so as long as fidesz has epp backing , nothing will be done . 
   other people would characterize that as being able and willing to drive consensus . 
  re : the willingness to drive consensus : there 's a difference between achieving a workable compromise and straight-up going against your stated beliefs , and verhofstadt has done plenty of the latter re : the ability to drive consensus : at least with his ep president bid , that failed spectacularly , and he once again betrayed his stated values by backing tajani over pittella once he was out just because the epp promised him the brexit negotiator position . 
  oh the epp effectively begged fidesz to join ( fidesz used to be part of the liberal international , of which orb\u00e1n used to be vice president , go figure ) . 
  the epp wanted to secure influence in eastern europe before the 2004 expansion and basically courted parties based on their size and power rather than ideological similarity . 
  there were plenty of warning signs about fidesz before it joined the epp , but the leadership was willing to put up with pretty much anything as long as it meant the balance of powers on the eu level remained in their favour ( which is also why berlusconi 's forza italia was a member and why certain countries where the right is fragmented have several , even half a dozen parties in the epp ) . 
  the konrad adenauer foundation ( which is a cdu think tank ) in particular was instrumental in getting fidesz to join and the hanns seidel foundation ( a csu think tank ) has even given orb\u00e1n the franz josef strauss prize ( which is a lifetime achievement award for politics ) , so while the relations with merkel have n't been the best , fidesz still has plenty of friends in germany ( csu moreso than cdu ) . 
  imo it will take a lot more for the epp to expel fidesz . 
  if not anything else , fidesz has 12 meps , which does n't sound like a lot , but the epp only has a couple dozen more meps than s&d . keeping fidesz on board basically ensures that the epp can stuff its people into senior positions ( ep president etc ) and for many in the epp , that alone makes keeping fidesz around worth it . 
  as for what 's in it for fidesz , obviously it wields a lot more influence as part of the epp than the ecr ( especially since the tories are going to be out of the picture soon ) , so unless something drastic happens , both sides benefit from this arrangement . 
   my point is just that government is very prone to error in picking infant industries to subsidize , and therefore should refrain from doing so . 
  all r&d investment is very prone to error but the state is actually surprisingly good at driving innovation as mariana mazzucato 's work has shown . 
  i recommend * the entrepreneurial state * in particular . 
  did this really need to be a post, 
  and let 's not forget the time he tried to partner up with bepe grillo to get himself elected as president of the european parliament . 
  verhofstadt would sell his soul for a nickel . 
  in either case , this has nothing to do with protectionism in the first place ( protectionism means protecting industries against foreign competition , which does n't apply to hydrogen cars/tesla to begin with ) , so i do n't know why you 're bringing it up . 
  i 'm just saying , tesla is n't a good example of a self-made success story . 
   ( imagine we 'd propped up hydrogen cars or something , we might not have gotten tesla ) tesla and other musk businesses have received $ 5 billion in goverment subsidies . 
  labelling every protectionist measure under the sun as extremist is a bit much , though . 
  to use another example , the german trade school system has long been criticised by the imf as rent-seeking in nature ( because the licencing system restricts market access to trade school graduates ) and arguably protectionist ( since labourers from places without a comparable system are automatically excluded from the market ) , yet calling people who want to keep the school system as-is `` extremists '' , well ... that would certainly be a first in my book . 
  huh ? 
  i mean that 's pretty thoughtful of him .
