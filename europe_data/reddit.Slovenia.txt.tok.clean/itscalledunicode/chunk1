i firmly disagree . 
  but that discusin is for a different sub, 
  dood , just looking at the domains i can tell you this is a nice pile of bulshit , or as its more modern to say `` fake news '' . 
  nop , why would that be a thing ? 
  `` da bi ti krava v hlevu crk ` nla '' - may your cow die in the stabel . 
  parliamentary monarchy ? 
  realy ? 
  where ? 
  lol , what ? 
  russias army has mostly defensive capabilities . 
  they are not training to attack an e european country . 
  i chose regulation ower anarchy . 
  i hope we can figure out a merger of eu and eaeu in the near future . 
  youth wrestling ? 
  like bar brawls ? 
  are we now in agreement that is a thing ? 
  what did they do this time ? 
  that 's because we believe morals are instilled at home , not at school . 
  we learn as children of the brutality of germans , and so on . 
  we get the blockbuster films in cinemas . 
   united kingdom united kingdom of great britan and northen ireland , anyone ? 
   united states united states of america, 
  we have udbomafija and one of its offshoots if the theories surrounding the assassination of presidential candidate kramberger . 
  a hard brexit and hefty fines placed on the uk . 
  i dislike hollywood movies , they are unrealistic , flashy and dumbed down . 
  most of the good stories we already made movies about , like the battel at neretva , battel at sutjeska , and the stories of brave man and woman fighting the german beast in the films like on our own soil and valter defends sarajevo . 
  180 light years, 
  in russia noone is a civilian in the event of war . 
  why would russia invade e europe ? 
  why is that sad ? 
  i have a bunch , it would be possible to exchange , but why tho ? 
  ** long live south ossetia !, 
  long live abkhazia !!, 
  may nagorno-karabakh prosper in its plight !, 
  ** and a thank you to armenia for being good people , stay strong . 
  disregarding the story of atlantis , continents do not tend to disappear . 
  i 'm strictly against it . 
  turkey is not in europe , they do not share our values and are an aggressive nation . 
  lol what ? 
  ok o basically we used to have jews , then the counterreformation happened , a pogrom or two and they left and move to germany where people liked them . 
  why do n't you want to go to so\u010di if you have the funds ? 
   do your history classes incorporate moral judgments ( cruel/appropriate/justified / unjustified/right/wrong , etc ) ? 
  no , history is to teach facts not morals . 
   do your classes about the asian theatre of ww2 mainly discuss the atomic bombs ? 
  many the asian `` theatre '' is ignored but the end with the soviet invasion of japanese-occupied territory and the a-bombs . 
  what i remember most from my trip ' there was eucalyptus trees and sweet realy sweet wine . 
  i have no use for them . 
   speaking bosnian you crack me up, 
  good answer , at leat someone has the lls to answer trutfully . 
  good on you m german neighbor . 
  people think im russian xd, 
  what crap is going on ? 
   which is a far more complicated matter than post fees actualy not mor complicated . 
  the problem with post is that countries dont even agree on what standard size for envelopes is . 
   in how far would it be stupid ? 
  it wouldnt be , it would just be extremly hard . 
  yust look at the charges for a standard letters international stamp . 
   what you wrote is a non-argument . 
  i don think `` ha no '' ever pretended to be an argument, 
  the same way we standardised universities in europe with the bolognia reform . 
   yeah , and pretty much anyone but family members and yourself can . 
  does n't it usually need to be an organisation ? 
   what do you mean ? 
  the ib is an attempt to do that . 
  no , what i mean is make the national baccalaureats conform to the same standards , eliminating the need for a ib . 
  to quote your qoute :  the united states postal service released this stamp on april 4 , 2002 . 
  why would anyone be so stupid as to think they were issued by the states ? 
   u.s. economics i never really discussed your 3 #rd world countries economics . 
  quite frankly i do n't care how much money you have to print to get out of the humongous debt you guys have . 
   it 's community service , not a job . 
  someone usually needs to sign for your community service . 
   kind of agree on that one . 
  novel idea , mediocre in practice . 
  is it so hard to instead standardize the baccalaureats ? 
   we had exile iraqi 's pleading for us to `` free '' iraq . 
  lol 1 ) no you did n't . 
  2 ) they were exiled for a reason 3 ) those are the type of voices you should not be listening to 4 ) why did n't you let them do it themselves ? 
   everything gets clearer with hindsight . 
  it 's also clear not to atack a country !, 
  or at least do n't go against un security council . 
   ib is stupid . 
  also according to wikipedia the cas are not necessarily volunteer work . 
  but also some creative work and shit . 
  still , i find it problematic that this system makes kids do work in order to receive their secondary education diploma . 
  look at [ this stamp ] ( http://www.theus50.com/images/state-stamps/alaska-stamp.jpg ) you stupid american . 
  what does it say ? 
  i mean what does it say in the bottom right corner of the stamp ? 
  is it `` usa '' by any chance ? 
  you do n't say ... fuking idiot . 
  you do n't even understand something as simple as the post . 
  no wonder your country is a shithole . 
  none of these stamps was issued by a state of the united stated , but instead , all were issued in the name of the federation by the federal agency . 
  essentially they were issued by the country . 
  of course postage of objects of different mass from different routes to differently distant locations is different , what do you expect ? 
  [ tv slo 2 ] ( https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/radiotelevizija_slovenija ), 
  yes . 
  among other things : [ borut pahor ] ( https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/borut_pahor ) [ karl erjavec ] ( https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/karl_erjavec ) and of course everyone 's least favourite [ ivan jan\u0161a ] ( https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/janez_jan%c5%a1a ), 
   literally everyone knows usps is a federal agency : i do n't even know where you get the idea that everyone thinks differently apparently , you do n't . 
  because there are no such stamps as oklahoma stamps . 
  what you are talking about are us stamps with oklahoma theme on them .
