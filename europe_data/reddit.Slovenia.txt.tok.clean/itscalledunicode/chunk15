  the us also supported many vicious dictators in south america . 
  what is your point ? 
  ( they also rescued nazis from germany braught them to the us , operation paper clip )  so careful before making such utterly unintelligent comments !, 
  a nazi ss officer is just that and nothing more . 
  deserved to die and burn in hell . 
  i said soviez not soviet . 
  soviez merely means union . 
   some communism lovers also freak out when anyone addressees them with '' \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d '' and reply that they are '' \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0449 '' . 
  cuz that seems very strange to me ... 
  giving them your railways for example . 
  ideology of the european soviez, 
  well if you ca n't see anything wrong with giving those things to the nazis instead of fighting them then i ca n't really help you now can i. 
  [ during ww2 . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/estnische_legion.svg/475px-estnische_legion.svg.png ), 
  idk maybe your ss man would have something to say about that . 
  and how they were viewed as heroes . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_waffen_grenadier_division_of_the_ss_ ( 1st_estonian ), 
  the most beautifull city in the world of course - ljubljana . 
  estonians used to be nazis , than the russians came and won the war saving europe from naziism, 
  we have the same thing . 
  also i was told something like \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d is used ? 
  when you are on vacation gipsies come and steal your coppe . . 
  god ( whonis . 
  serb ) helped us by sending him straight to hell . 
  we have the alway popular udbomafia , the communist conspiracy . . 
  because it would not be polite to not say it, 
  those signs are all ower the so called repub\u010dic of croatia , if you stick to the road youll be fine . 
  whn hunting stick to gaim trails , no mines there . 
  they prefered war ower all else . 
  they did . 
  i mean ww1 was entirely down to austrian militarism . 
   albania is still authentic . 
  wit all the bunkers you need xd, 
  those were led by god all mighty , not austria . 
  austria instigated most of its wars . 
  sure they were . 
  piemont ring any bells xd, 
   we did build our neutrality after ww2 that 's because you were forbidden from allying germany , remember . 
   we could argue that is our neutrality , but so is it in austria too . 
  how about the funding of nazis and allowing them the use of your railroads ? 
  that 's a nazi supporting state if i have ever seen one . 
   the nature and the allemansr\u00e4tt ( freedom to roam ) . 
  you 're allowed to forage ( hunting and fishing needs permit except coastal water ) on anyone 's land except immediate dwelling area or cultivated area . 
  the landowner has no legal right to stop you or fence of their wilderness . 
  i find it strange that you find this special . 
  who has the right to stop me from walking around the forest and picking mushrooms ? 
  we have the same legal right here , but i never found it all that unusual . 
   our higher education is in the middle of adopting the bologna process , so everything is a big mess , every year brings something new . 
  i hope , it will make things better in the end . 
  it will not . 
  not very popular , especially since the rise of the internet . 
  also , we had some well publicised gruesome murders . 
  you slip of jut that one shoe , to have an excuse to take of the other one . 
  best choice would be slovenia . 
  you can do everything imaginable during the summer , jump down to the coast for a quick swim , stay in the capital for the party , go hiking in the alps and much more .

  when you enter someone 's home you try to take your shoes off , you are told not to do it , you do it anyway . 
  hush , your stupidity and lack of geographical knowledge is showing . 
  yeah ,, 
   do n't think private schools are currently a problem as we have so little , but yea , no more . 
  i do n't think they should be funded by taxpayers money either . 
  i hate it how they are now 100 % funded by the state . 
  private schools also spread weerd political and religious ideas we hav no controll ower . 
  kids should go to swcular schools . 
  everions should be granted the same level pf schooling so they can suceed on merit . 
   what good would that do ? 
  i 'm really interested . 
  idk exactly , i just lik it better that way . 
  more orderly . 
  schools can b more specialized in developing the teachin proces . 
  you know ferero nutely . 
  made in germany , italy france and poland ? 
  not one recepies is the same , to cater to the market they sell to . 
  same witho those things that come from owerseas . 
  whell auatria deffinatly than.than . 
  those germans show up to boar meatings in ledder pants and shit . 
  ask for euro dogos xd, 
  ban private schools . 
  split the primary school ( 7-15 ) from now 1 system with 2 internal variations to 2 different systems . 
  your best destination is deffinatly slovenia . 
  a beautifull picturesq country that fetures everething from the plains of panonia , the alpine peeks to the salty marahes and the sea . 
  a have to visit place deffinatly . 
  maybe germany . 
  go to r/dogs, 
   i 'm very ignorant of my country 's politics shame :-\\ \\, 
  all that shiet is produced on this here continent for this here specific market . 
  bataclan , nice to list just the most famous . 
  yes . 
  people sign a contract and receive a certain amount of money every month . 
  they go to training a few times a year on paid vacation covered by the state . 
  and when they are needed they get called in , without the need for `` irregular conditions '' or marshal law being declared . 
  this seems to be an online thing rather than an actual shop . 
  why would ** anyone ** ever go to the usa ? 
  yes . 
  the overrepresentation of countries in the eu parliament was set up to prevent small countries from being pushed out of discourse by larger ones . 
  not me , i value my life . 
  do n't wana get killed by islam . 
  resistance to nazi-fascism . 
   but they should not be granted veto-power or separate representation this would go against eu law and values . 
   despite having the euro , they are not in the eu same goes for vatican and monaco .
