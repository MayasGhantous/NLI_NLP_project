  maybe you could say montenegronis for some unknown reason our best patner . 
  prevozi.org is ride shating not car sharing . 
  and its also stupid af . 
  triest airport is a small provimitial airport compared to brnik . 
  itali is also . 
  les safe country compared to slovenia more chanches of terrorist atacs . 
  and why shoul i need to ride 3h to a airport when w have an excelant airpo in brnik ? 
  mind you th bogest plane in the wor\u010dd ha lande here before . 
  im not gona gp to bruxels again util things calm down . 
  idk , the bible o guess has a christmas story . 
  car sharing is nonexistant in slovenia and it is stupid . 
  im not goint to fly from italy i want to fly from ljublana , in favt i rathe fly from maribor than triest . 
  wjy shou\u010dd i be inconvinoamved because ryanair doesnt fly to ljibljana ? 
  fuck ryanair and their terrorist infested ports . 
  buses are also extremly unconfortable to travell in . 
  have you ever spent 12h in a old marcedes bus with shot suspension ? 
  train is the best , safesr , most eco friendly way to travell . 
  and i was merely showing how littel conection ther is . 
  go opti is fucking expensive and dangerous as fuck , i once drove gome from triest with the driver sleeping after a 16h work day and a pasanger driving . 
  never again !!, 
  car sharing is a holiwood fad , like wika . 
  also by `` trains dont go to triest '' i ment i cant get a train ljubljana-rome even with a layower ... or ljubljana-sicily, 
   i think the problem is n't the price , it 's just you 're too scared to travel . 
  i travell all the time , just for the right price and to safe plaves . 
  not some bruxels or some muslim place like that . 
   blablacar is the largest ride sharing service in the world . 
  im not hichiking . 
  i dont wana get raped , murdered and tosed into the sava . 
  thazs crazy you donthat , ima stick to trains . 
   you 're a lot more likely to be killed walking to the meet-up , than to be killed by the driver during the ride . 
  maybe in but in we have surprisingly littel murders . 
  most famous ones commited by people pickin up hichikers . 
   here 's the 40 $ round trip flight out of venice . 
  that 's to barcelona . 
  here 's a 25 $ round trip to berlin for 3 days . 
  plus 20 $ to get to venice and 20 $ to get back , iyeah cheep man real cheep . 
  if i fly ill fly from ljubljana lile a person . 
   of course , you could just fly directly out of lju to brussels alahu akbar thats one way plus the fes you didnt count . 
  and i flew as stated before for around 30 $ to bruxels before . 
   why would i care about that ? 
  you asked about 1 euro tickets , i gave you 1 euro tickets . 
  i srill need to be able ro buy it for it to b any good to me . 
   again , who is talking about planning year in advance ? 
  ryanair you have to plan mont in advance to get good prices . 
  i can fo tomorpv to the train station and always get the same price ticked for the same route . 
   sure . 
  it 's still as safe , if not safer , than your country . 
  dood france is in a state of emergeny , germany is under atack and belgium airports have a tendency of blowing up . 
  my country is one of the safest in, 
  sams tribal union, 
  whar did you fly during the volcano eruption or the aftermath of bruxels terror atacs xd, 
  i prefere https://youtu.be/2x9xd3lpwm0 , you can dance to it :d, 
  * [ bela sne\u017einka ] ( https://youtu.be/mpqakrkmark ) * [ prav fletno se imamo ] ( https://youtu.be/2x9xd3lpwm0 ), 
  does ryanair fly to slovenia ? 
  is it reasnoble for people to plan trips a year in advance within europe ? 
  is terrorism expanding ? 
  yes . 
  you mean [ these dolomites right ] ( http://www.kam.si/parki/krajinski_park_polhograjski_dolomiti.html ) ;-), 
  its realy hard to chose between [ triglav national park ] ( http://www.tnp.si/get_to_know/c178/ ) and the kamnik-savinja alps but the karavanke are realy so good in the sunset ... 
  as i said before . 
  am i suposed to plan my travell around some promotions and years in advance now ? 
  than get blown up by muslims ? 
  you will also notice that that ptomition did not include not 1 of slovenias 3 international airports . 
  on a side note : a european traveler should not be forced into a internet deal finding frenzy by big corporation . 
  insted the consumer should be able to walknup to the ticket seling counter and buy a ticket like . 
  person . 
  pm me , come to slovenia ;-), 
   always for less than # 100 return some o us dont have hundreds of euros do drop on fair to berlin . 
  and where am i gping to sleep ? 
  what will i eat ? 
  europe is realy badly conected with slovenia , or enywhere for that matter . 
  a train ride to moscow would take 48h and 6 train changes !!!!, 
  not to mention the price . 
  the only train from slovenia to itali is to op\u010dine , and no further , not even triest . 
  it takes ages to reach celpvec via train . 
  planes are fucking expensive . 
  and still you strike ... 
  wtfcar is bla bla car ? 
  i dont want to get killed . 
  [ a bus ride to venice costs 17 $ one way ] ( http://www.ap-ljubljana.si/shop.php?sub=vozni_red2&amp;page=vr2 ) [ you mean ower 200 $ ? 
  ] ( https://imgur.com/741wevl ) no thanks , i can use that money for something mor oroductive ( or go to belgrade and back 10 times ) not that i still have to see the 1 $ ticket and the flight out of ljubljana for under 30 $, 
  i flew wizair to bruxels its aroud 30 $ . 
  no where neer the mithical 1 $ ticket mentioned above . 
  simple solution . 
  communist era style fast pace development of underdeveloped area, 
  yes, 
  that must be a lie . 
  there is no way i can get a train ticket ljubljana-maribor for under 5 $ on students prices . 
  any plane out of ljubljana will not have tickets under 30 $ . 
  1 $ tickets are pure fantasy . 
  is shit , we should have a wide minimum wage . 
  not that in romania people are happy with 200 $ pay while in germany social benifita are higher, 
   your u/kontaktnicenter account what ? 
  i was abrawd for a few monts . 
  using multiple acount is against reddit rules, 
  yeah , you dont consider yourselves responsible for your history apparently . 
  how much is rent ? 
  if you had watched hrt in the 90 you would know, 
  anti semitism . 
  also news at the time tied him to neo nazi financing stuff .
