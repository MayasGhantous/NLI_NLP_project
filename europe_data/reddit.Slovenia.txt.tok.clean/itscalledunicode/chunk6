   and legal i do n't care about that . 
   it 's not like 60 $ / year is a huge sum of money whell yeah , i could buy myself a week of vacation with that money . 
   it 's not actually free , you 're just stealing things . 
  it is free . 
  pirate bay costs 0 $ to use . 
  [ and who said i 'm stealing something ? 
  ] ( http://jeremygohblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/wpid-tumblr_l9z3t8ocbj1qzl2uzo1_500.jpg ), 
  so the piece we have enjoyed in europe for an unprecedented length of time does nothing to you ? 
  well then you are selling the work of making that dvd . 
  i remember the good ol days of piracy when pirated music on cds was distributed these ways , and satellite decoder cards were made by proffy pirates . 
  what ? 
  your answer confuses me ... e-piracy is not stealing . 
  yeah , but do n't you have to pay it regardless ? 
  we have to pay our national tv bill no matter what way you watch tv . 
  because watching it on an antenna is free . 
  i think we need to make an eu universal colour scheme . 
  you keep saying that . 
  why not divide entire bih between serbia and croatia while we are at it ? 
  that will surely be a peaceful solution . 
   if austria and germany want to merge nobody should be able to put the nose in it only germans and austrians . 
  actually we can , both versais and paris prohibit that . 
  not to mention the austrian state contract does not allow it . 
  and usa and russia as signatories should oppose such an attempt . 
   dayton can be changed there have been talks of `` dayton ii '' but that is unrealistic and doubtful that it would alow that . 
   and you can not many bribes from that g2 < 3 russia ^ - ^, 
  whenever i drive par the storage yard . 
  why not give them kanaan ? 
   un peace-keeping forces to preserve the result . 
  hahaha hahahah un pece keepers xd you crack me up . 
  what are you on about ? 
  it , ca n't happen due to dayton . 
  50per cent of what ? 
  ba\u010dko or the rest of the federation ? 
  and here i thaught you might start your turn by protecting the moravian germans . 
   republika srpska should be able to secede but they have that right , reguardless . 
  that makes no legal sense . 
  srpska can declare independence from bih but it can not merge into serbia . 
  serbia as one of the guarantees of dayton would not want this to happen , because it would mean trouble for everybody . 
  and kosovo is an integral part of serbia . 
  do n't know really . 
  anything more than an hours drive is long distance for people here . 
  but no one has a problem of sitting on a plane and flying to the canaries - if they can afford it . 
  i see , but thats expensive af . 
  we have 5 . 
  1 the black bin for nonrecyclables . 
  2 the brown bin for biodegradable waste . 
  3 the green bin for glass 4 the yellow bin for packaging ( plastic , cans , milk cartons ) 5 the blue bin for paper and cardboard . 
  . ^ ^ it_should_be_noted_that_the_colour_sheme_is_only_wvalid_in_the_capital_and_its_sateites_others_use_the_same_number_of_bins_in_different_colour_shemes, 
   tv licence wtf is that ? 
  we pay for iptv over an optical cable to our door . 
  tv + landline + mobile + internet = 40 $ / month similar prices go fo coxial cabel and adsl conections . 
  if you want a high-speed lte 4g mobile data connection ( mobile data only ) it will be about 30 $ / month , and it will reduce you the speed after the data cap at 40gb . 
  wtf is a `` firestick ''  https://kodi.tv/about/ a gift for those who wish to cut the cord . 
  works on phones , computers and the firestick  enjoy this just streams video content over the internet . 
   cable companies out here tend to set rates lower for a period of time then nearly double after that . 
  hence the large range in price you ca n't double a rate if its not specified in the contract . 
  also , that would lose you subscribers who are also protected as an indengered species by the law . 
  edit : oh and for the extra price of 3 $ / month we get time offset option on all channels for 72h . 
  no ads need be watched . 
   selling pirated content is strictly forbidden . 
  why would someone sell something they can download themselves for free ? 
   lots of people have switched to spotify or google music here , which costs 5 euros per month . 
  not a lot of money to pay for all music ever . 
  neither of those services is good at covering locally produced music . 
  and why would i need to pay 60 $ !!!!!!!!!! / year !!!!!, 
  for something that is free ? 
   if you own a business , then you must own the real deal like legit windows or legit anti-virus program and etc or you will get fined . 
  your business owners need to discover linux . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  you are from croatia . 
  northen ireland is in a union , as is croatia . 
  northen ireland is a country just like scotland , england . 
  so your argument is a list of failed states ? 
   but now that there are more legal ways to get stuff people are more reluctant to enter in the dark side realy ? 
  but legal ways cost money . 
  why ? 
  and croatia is in the eu . 
  what is going on here ? 
  it sure does . 
   jelincic plemeniti unlike heider he is a friendly bloke and does n't want to genocide people, 
  yes, 
   if someone sells pirated stuff it 's very frowned upon . 
  i can see how that would be a problem . 
  you are selling something you got for free . 
  most nationalist support serbs . 
  same in slovenia . 
  sorry , fixed it, 
   hitler was 80 years ago and how many people 's death did he cause ? 
   aggressive nationalism literally beaten out of them heider . 
  adolf hitler anyone ? 
   you mean by laws and law enforcement , or regular people ? 
  both, 
   many serbs are aggressively nationalistic , even for balkan standards , which is annoying and obnoxious coming from austria xd, 
   i 've been to kosovo since and i have the stamp in my passport . 
  that will not be a problem since the stamps are not a problem in accordance with the bruxelles negotiations where pri\u0161tina and belgrade agreed on administrative crossings . 
   mini-country . 
  he/she/it is from n ireland ^ population_1 ,8 _ milion, 
  yes . 
  nation-state are the most stable form europe knows , and in fact the world knows . 
   while the education is good you ` muricans crack me up every time .
