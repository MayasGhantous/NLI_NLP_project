  20 y. o. i do not have a car . 
  i am living in my family 's home . 
  they say they are not all that german . 
  this sub hates me for having opinions . 
  [ knjik ] is deffinatly wrong . 
  [ wrong . 
  ] ( https://media.tenor.co/images/2672a2395ef37486b779fa43cd10b16b/tenor.gif ) how do you pronounce the folowing : `` pet knjig pridig '' , will you go [ p\u00e9t knjik pr\u00eddik ] or will you go [ p\u00e9t knjih pr\u00eddih ] . 
  granted this does not apply to every `` g '' at the end of a word , there are additional rules to take into account , i can not recall now , but if you were to open your high school textbook ... 
  i fully support scotish independence , i truly hope you guys can become a republic soon . 
  i also support n ireland and wales splitting from the union , imo you guys should form some sort of a `` celtic federation '' with the republic of ireland , making it easier to survive economically . 
  to be fair i have an eu given right to speak only in my language and care about only my country . 
  [ sure ... yerm , oceans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovene_riviera ), 
  `` l '' at the end of the word is often pronounced as [ u ] `` v '' is pronounced 4 different ways from [ v ] to [ u ] and everything in between `` g '' at the end of the word is pronounced as [ h ], 
  never heard of it . 
  no one here is from vietnam so we do n't make it . 
  zastava republike slovenije, 
  fisherman ? 
  seriously ? 
  you mean like people fly fishing in the rivers ? 
  idk they have some local pull when it comes to meliorations , hydroelectric plants seduels etc. 
  but nationally no . 
  farmers , on the other hand , have significant pull . 
  they will close roads , launch tractor protests in the capital and will manage to get something to nudge . 
  [ the current assembly looks like this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/sl/thumb/2/26/sestavadz2014.png/700px-sestavadz2014.png ) , here is the wiki : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slovenian_parliamentary_election,_2014 for an interpretation of where the parties stand go to this comment : https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5zepn1/try_to_explain_what_the_major_political_parties/df00jzu/, 
   what are the christian parties that i hear about in europe ? 
  that would be a political party the ideology of which is declaratively based in `` christian morals '' . 
  in slovenia the largest one of the sort ( and the only one with representatives in the national assembly ) is the [ n.si ] ( http://nsi.si/ )  are these parties actually solely christians focusing on christian issues and ideas ? 
  the above-mentioned one is not , economically they are neo-liberal . 
  but sure there are parties like that , there are also jedi and penguin parties in some countries . 
  what ? 
  you will have to rephrase that to be more clear . 
  r/europe probably censored it if it arose . 
  they aew wery pro albanian there . 
  my 1.6 lford fusion ( euro variant = / = us car with same name ) develops 74kw and 146nm ( at 4000 rev ) . 
  thats cool , can you now give me some actual mesurments in wats and newton-meters, 
  i dont think so . 
   first of kurac/kurec as far as i am awere that is not a slovenian word . 
  no wonder it eats so much gas . 
  hoe much power do you get out of that ? 
  you wo n't be able to get any new cars owner 2,0 l nowadays , unless you are buying some ridiculous sports cars like ferraris , lamborghinis . 
  they do say its going to go up again due to the whole diesel-gate fiasco . 
   15 dollars an hour , we get it we get it , no need to rub your money in my face . 
   how tiny are the engines in those suv 's ? 
  2.0 l engine in a mazda crx6 i believe will get you under 6l/100km if you drive within the speed limit . 
  that is really strange . 
  even non-eu countries have started making new plates with a blue strip ( without the stars of course ), 
  that 's cool . 
  i was looking into how much it would cost to go to minsk , ant it turns out a direct plane flight is actually cheaper than train . 
  yes but are those old plates that were returned and they give them to you or are they still making them ? 
   1400 a month rich af  as for the gas mileage thing , larger cars play a role here . 
  newer suvs have 4l/100km , like mazda, 
  what i ment to say was do they make black plates newly or do they recycle old ones . 
  no need if we get a land corridor :d . than we can also start converting our railways to the belarus gauge to ease trade , also who would object to bigger trains :d, 
  you mean old black plates or new ones ? 
   the volvo cost 1500 dollars in 2015 and the truck 700 last year . 
  yeah you 're rich . 
   20 mpg ( 12l / 100km ) isnt that bad . 
  we consider a 1980 yugo an economy car . 
  i know a lot of people with cars under 10 years old that get about that or less . 
  how is that possible ? 
  a car that eats 8l/100km is considered wastefull here . 
   p.s. 
  i do n't like our fleg and would love it changed . 
  launch a civil initiative for the government to open a tender and a referendum on a new flag . 
  tho , if you guys merge with the republic that will not be necessary . 
  how bout [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/flag_of_the_international_brigades.svg/1280px-flag_of_the_international_brigades.svg.png ) ? 
  i was never banned . 
  that is very sad . 
  that 's crazy . 
  why is this allowed ? 
   already have 2 other vehicles for driving are you just rich or are you a colector ? 
   1987 ford ranger pickup ( their compact and fuel efficient truck , seats 4 and is slightly larger then a sedan ) just converted the mileage it says it goes 5gal/100mil that 's 12l/100km . 
  that 's a lot , that 's how much a fucking 1980 lada or yugo eats up . 
   ver here in nj , anything made before 1995 isnt subject to any inspection of any kind at all , that 's crazy . 
   also the dealerships here give you temporary plates ( made out of laminated paper that are good for one month ) so you can just drive them off the lot here here they make you get your own plates . 
  of course , that is how it was originally planned after ww1 to prevent austria and hungary from ever again merging , 
  i 'm not welsh , why ? 
  what happened with cyprus ? 
  pst , we can concur them instead of merging , 
  fuck hungary , the speak weird . 
  [ sure there is ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/map_of_greater_serbia_\\ ( in_yugoslavia \\ ) _ hr.svg ), 
  and we would get a tank factory , yey :d, 
  how about you guys merge with slovakia and then we carve out a land corridor between czekia and slovenia frew austria and hungary like it was originally planned ? 
  a failed state with no viable army where we have to share power with * the croats * ? 
  no thanx . 
   but im a euro federalist http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shoo-gif.png, 
  please annex us , pleas, 
   south tyrol is n't that italian ? 
  how about the welsh ? 
   austria , typical . 
  would you merge with us too ? 
  we love your quirky way of dressing and you cars and stuff . 
  blood is thicker than water . 
  no piece of paper lacking information can undo his heritage . 
  children usually get both nationalities of their parents when they are born .
