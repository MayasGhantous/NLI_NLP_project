  finland is a eu member , what are you on about ? 
  yes . 
  so popular we almost have enough people for 1 national team . 
  i really do n't understand why they are still a thing . 
  you ca n't just drive a new car of the lot , you need plates first . 
  imo you wastred your money , for 2500 $ you could have gotten an actual used car maybe 6 years old . 
  the only value the truck has is as either a museum or enthusiast piece . 
  since the make and model was never exported to europe its price would be much higher of course . 
  the question is also whether or not this old thing is road legal and whether or not it passes a technical nowadays . 
  it realy seams as more of a car to look at than a car to drive . 
  i do not . 
  it is unconstitutional to discriminate people based on their personal circumstances . 
  no , they are only obliged to provide services in the member states they operate in . 
  i ' just put the same people we used to have on money back on , moving trubar and pre\u0161eren from the 1 and 2 $ coins to 5 and 10 $ notes and replacing them on coins with something from the flora or fauna . 
  yeah , call the country whose people actually elect their president undemocratic  top notch . 
  that 's enough is n't it ? 
  yes . 
  and may i remind you even logged forests in my country are nice , since unlike you people we do n't do clear cuts . 
  so like coins every country would make their bills ? 
  so you would combine england , scotland and wales into great britain football team ? 
  what happens to n ireland ? 
  lol what ? 
  how many negros do you think we have ? 
  you forgot to add usa to that list . 
  and before that the hapsburgs . 
  i think they were n't put in their place like they should have been after ww2 . 
  and this allowed them to feel like they can run the eu now . 
  they have even rearmed themselves . 
  to whom ? 
  fellow travelers ? 
  you get on at the front and get of at the back , who would you thank and why ? 
  yes . 
  it 's illegal to enter and reside in a country wich denied you a visa . 
  you go to the dealership yo check out the car , if they have in stock you can take it , sign papers transfer money , wait for the car to arrive from storage ( 1 week ) and take it home . 
  when bilbo took ower everything went to shit . 
  france probably . 
  not yet , have to plan to go there in the first place xd . 
  ima get myself a lonely planet or something , 
  inter rail will get you across central and western europe at an affordable price . 
  the entirety of the american stupidity factors rolled into one expression . 
  yes , many people make they 're own shnaps . 
  minsk , i 'm visiting this 1st of may, 
   american universities hold a prestige around the world lol  : would an american with a us degree have better opportunities in europe than an american with a european degree ? 
  deffinatly not . 
  croats keep stealing shit . 
  italians keep stealing shit . 
  austrians keep stealing shit . 
  hungarians keep stealing shit . 
  you have to have it on you car ( technically ) when you live your country . 
  eu plates with blue strip attempt to eliminate the need , at least inside the eu . 
  i do n't mind , but i do n't think they should be allowed to mint $ coins . 
  you probably meant the uk not britain .
