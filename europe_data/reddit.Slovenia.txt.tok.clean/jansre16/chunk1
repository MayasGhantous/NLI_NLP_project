inb4 massive shitshow in the comments, 
  i 'll probably get downvoted to hell , but a eu joint defense initiative would be great . 
  do n't worry too much about a50 . 
  when good old nigel looses his relevance , even the old conservative folk will realise their mistake . 
  they might be conservative old fucks , but they are n't fascists . 
  if snow is n't for you , feel free to visit during summer . 
  heat stroke included free . 
  i thought australians already did this when 4chan was invented . 
  and using 5kbit internet no less . 
  you were given a choice between a liar and a child . 
  you chose the latter . 
  luckily for you there is a thing called congress to keep his actions at bay . 
  honestly i 'd have voted against trump just to keep pence out of the wh . 
  he is way more dangerous in the long run . 
  making the pound sterling lighter will make it easier for the britain to set sail for tropics . 
   now eu want to ban our kettles * not going to happen you damn jerries !, 
   now eu want to ban our kettles * not going to happen you damn jerries !, 
  username checks out . 
  this is fucking gold . 
  and i was about to post an angry rant . 
  thanks mate , you saved my ass . 
  to tell fellow europeans that serbia is now literally encircled . 
  who would have thought ... 
  [ russian foreign ministry at the moment ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/b5sjrifc8dkhk/giphy.gif ), 
  i was worried for a sec . 
   why is ukraine eliminated ? 
   slovenia  rich if only . 
  remove normans from the premises, 
  no wonder considering nothing has happened yet . 
  the timing could n't be worse . 
  this could sink the eu application . 
  i do n't even understand your point in this . 
  there was zero `` negative '' change in immigration policy when the eu judges started `` dictating . '', 
  any member state may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements . 
  you must fall pretty low when even fucking al-nusra is more popular . 
  so this is how democracy dies , with thunderous applause . 
  oh please let the putin shilling in the comments stop . 
  the chechen one mate . 
  at times like this , i can almost justify the 1995 war . 
  and uncle erdo wonders why so many kurds actively support the pkk . 
  is it because of britain or the 6 , you know ? 
  # [ communism ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/076/964/851.jpg ), 
   why the huge drop in russia ? 
  russian jews were protected by the holocaust , right ? 
  did they immigrate after ww2 ? 
  a decent chunk of the western ussr was under nazi occupation . 
   how did 100 jews end up in iceland ? 
  they were quite likely there before . 
  since iceland was a part of norway in 1933 , the local jews are counted as norwegian jews . 
   this plus other kids of evidence show that jews were more common before ww2 for obvious reasons . 
  but how do 21st century neo-nazis explain this ? 
  do they have a theory for that or do they simply deny everything that goes against their narrative ? 
  nazis adhere to the schrodinger 's logic . 
  on one hand they regard jews as subhuman , on the other they consider them the masters of earth . 
  on one hand they claim that the holocaust never happened , on the other they wish it would happen again . 
  do n't bother arguing with a nazi . 
  considering sexual preference is n't a choice and is n't contagious , you may sleep soundly knowing that your cat wo n't turn gay overnight . 
   loosing against a bunch of vietnamese farmers that had like 10 soviet aa missiles #kek #e #k, 
  uncle stalin would disagree . 
  conspiracy and t_d poster , comment checks out . 
  50000000000000000000000 killed by the partisans !, 
  slovenia confirmed, 
  in other news , water is wet . 
  what mad vlad takes he never gives back . 
  ok this meme is getting old . 
  [ mfw ] ( https://bronicuscatholicus.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/z72.jpg ), 
  along with your two other buddies ksa and uae . 
  wait a few more decades for the '50 generation to die off and we 'll join your green zone . 
  the slovene catholic church refused to un-fuck itself after francis came into power . 
   free world allende would disagree . 
  why stop at punching ? 
  did lukashenko grow a pair of balls overnight ? 
  further funding and defensive support . 
  yea , but that was done with an sa-3 anti-aircraft missile . 
  mig-29 would have a hard time spotting and engaging the f-117 , even with all the clever tricks the air force had . 
  this is correct , though the average standard of living is of course higher . 
  wow , i was anti-beating a minute ago . 
  i value honesty . 
  pretty much . 
  for bosnia , [ this coat of arms ] ( https://i.imgur.com/d3kison.gif ) was suggested which is imho one of the better designs around . 
  absolutely , especially compared to this [ monstrosity ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/coat_of_arms_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina_1998-2001.svg/2000px-coat_of_arms_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina_1998-2001.svg.png ) . 
  i see that our foresters have resorted to growing lens flares to fund their deficit . 
  lilies on the emblem only represent the bosniaks . 
  the butthurt was still alive and well after the war so the government rather replaced it than risked another shitstorm . 
  an allegory of the iraq war . 
  the serbs and croats threw a tantrum over , because the lilies only represent the bosniaks , it so it had to be replaced . 
  i wish my people could be more apathetic about pointless arguments and more distrustful during the elections . 
  i am utterly disgusted by the vocal minority which supports another military conflict to `` strengthen the people . '', 
  never in my life have i seen such an amount of complete ignorance in one place as the modern populist rallies . 
  not a single one of these warmongering manchildren has ever seen war . 
  the will to fight amongst ourselves over just about everything , envy , disgracefully underpaid and underequipped emergency services . 
  strange . 
  our education experts ca n't stop circlejerking over how good your education is . 
  is it too early to pack up my funeral suit that i had prepared for the death of british unity ? 
  do n't mistake pity for fear . 
  when you go politically backwards 50 years in 26 years , you do n't exactly invoke fear . 
  i 've never seen a flag come with a tree and a watermark . 
  bismarck rests in peace again . 
   why have you been hiding this from us ? 
  you know what happens when bugs brought by ships cause massive damage ?
