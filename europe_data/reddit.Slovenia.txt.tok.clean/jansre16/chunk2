  are the old french flags behind a dlc paywall too ? 
  who could forget the yellow sky . 
  i did n't think the last king was too popular with anyone . 
  there a native dynasty left ? 
  chill , i was simply asking for popular alternative designs out there . 
  good bot, 
  sad as it is a clean and simple design which will get you a boatload of karma if posted on / r/vexillology . 
  tbh i was waiting for the starry ploughs and other northern european designs . 
  shame how every influential historical design gets eventually corrupted . 
  this was bound to be posted . 
  anything not bled or ljubljana . 
  if slovenia actually became a social democratic state as its constitution claims , it would solve many programs . 
  you do n't need to be an economist or an investigator to spot it .

  an old bolt action hunting rifle many years ago . 
  it ** could ** have been one of those yugoslav versions of the k-98 but this is only a speculations as i did n't know much about guns then . 
  late to the party but hello nonetheless . 
  :p is the stance of regular soldiers in the bundeswehr `` confrontational '' ? 
  by that i mean do ** some of them ** want a war of some sort to happen during their time in the military ? 
  i 'm asking this because i 've had a pleasure of talking to a local former soldier who admitted to wishing for a war to happen . 
  according to him there were plenty of soldiers in his unit holding the same belief and/or wish .

  last i checked beating the living shit out of your kid is illegal here . 
  ok if the country and government are developed ( tunis , morocco , syria and oman ) . 
  because they would n't let me complete primary school without learning it . 
  also quake multiplayer did n't have many slovenes . 
  your wars and proxy wars ignited this shit storm . 
  when you backed hamas and the taliban against the arab socialists , you knew exactly what was going to happen . 
  your fuckup , your responsibility . 
  better setup some tents in your back yard . 
  it was the us that funded the taliban and hamas during the cold war . 
  it was the us that toppled stable countries over hilariously false allegations . 
  it was the us that destroyed the centuries old sunni-shia peace in iraq . 
  therefore it is reasonable to expect the us and its closest allies and co-conspirators in these wars to host any refugee displaced because of their actions ( or any consequences of these actions ) . 
  in short : ** their fuck-up , their refugees . 
  ** better setup some tents in dc , tel aviv , islamabad and riyadh before the world makes you do it . 
  saddam and gaddafi oppressed no one yet it was ** your ** country that bombed them regardlessly .

  the example of it is people not really being interested in household life of minorities . 
  i see them daily in parks and malls but the number has been dropping . 
  however , since it 's mostly elderly and conservative bosnian and albanian women who wear them and usually not their children , the number will further decrease . 
  fully body face obscuring burkas are however out of the question . 
  i have not seen one in my entire life living in slovenia . 
  no , they were both a product of your protectionist neoliberal practices and the indoctrination of the working class . 
  ah yes , the ol' `` sweden sharia rapist paradise . '', 
  took my a while to realise what i 'm looking at . 
  ah yes , your cousin is a dying breed of slovenes called ultra-catholic-conservative-head-up-the-ass-socialism-killed-29567823674283423424-people-in-slovenia-fuck-facts .
