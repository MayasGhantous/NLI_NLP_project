  [ federal socialism ftw .

  because we , like all normal people , love to get foreign funds . 
  i wo n't really bother with the entire us , instead i will focus on [ texas ] ( https://i.imgur.com/hexo7ht.jpg ) . 
  [ posadism alive and well in my homeland i see . 
  there are relatively common . 
  an metric shitton of companies went bankrupt during the 2008 crisis and workers started managing them . 
  ~ ~ socialism when ? ~ ~, 
  i thought my town with it 's 31 \u00b0 c average daytime temperature during the summer was hot . 
  that changed with a trip to hungary . 
  was n't ready for 40 \u00b0 c. 
  hungary is a frying pan during the summer . 
  most of the northern rural slovenia would probably suit you . 
  we 've already lost it once . 
  land grab somewhere else . 
  weird cross -  slovakia no cross -  slovenia how i taught an american friend . 
  not going to happen . 
  i have 10 extra pairs of slippers just for guests . 
  other than edgy prepubescent teenagers and cunts behind the wheel , no one does it . 
  have n't seen many games in slovene , and most of those few translated were done so by a bonobo . 
  every government and/or public building has one . 
  do n't give them any ideas . 
  i watch the parliament sessions to get my dose of comedy . 
  presuming american products would also disappear from the face of the earth , a lot of my stuff would be gone . 
  other than that , i would not mind too much . 
  rip allende & mosaddegh , you will never be forgotten \u262d \u262d . 
  nothing more than a hunting rifle . 
  short drop, 
  ~ ~ if you 're given a choice between being hanged , drowned or choked to death , which do you choose ? ~ ~ 2/3 of all swiss will always disagree with any answer you 'll be given here . 
  this is going to be fun . 
  but that would minimise the collective karma gains . 
  about as much as i 'd trust a drunk man driving . 
   the uk  american-like pick one . 
  best of luck . 
  no complaints from me . 
  this will turn into a shitstorm pretty soon . 
  i learned english by shitposting like a pro for years . 
  gon na deliberately interpret the word costume a bit differently here for the lulz . 
  what could go wrong this time ... 
  r/nottheonion would enjoy this . 
  most likely they do . 
  but i have n't been able to locate it . 
  the rise of radical islamic terrorism can be traced back to the disappearance of leftist groups in the middle east . 
  in the 50 's and 60 's lots of arab countries were openly socialist and progressive . 
  to `` combat communism '' , the us supported islamist radical groups in egypt , palestine , yemen and afghanistan . 
  even israel supported hamas in it 's war against the plo . 
  with no secular parties people chose their only available alternative which was conservative islam . 
  -- give the arabs a secular / leftist alternative and wait . 
  the problem will solve itself . 
  afaik few actually drive to other countries . 
  for electronics , i usually order them from the german or british amazon website . 
  [ personal id ] ( http://images0.zurnal24.si/slika-_original-1471855193-919964.jpg ) for general identification . 
  a [ passport ] ( http://images0.zurnal24.si/slika-_original-1473619470-725383.jpg ) or a [ driver 's licence ] ( http://images.24ur.com/media/images/original/jul2009/60312020.jpg?d41d ) can also be used . 
  i really did n't want to say `` nationalistic at best '' because i could upset at least a few viewers . 
  strange . 
  i 've been told that the combination of tu\u0111man 's policies and thompson 's centre-right songs allegedly made most people hate the left . 
  most certainly not . 
  putin is a right wing liberal who absolutely hates leftists . 
  a law was passed in the 80 's that prohibited a public gathering of over 3 people if none of them are wearing hats . 
  the englishmen took this to heart and to this day you will never see a group of people without magnificent top hats . 
  in other parts of the commonwealth hats are generally worn for practical reasons . 
  in the australian outback most people go to work wearing military grade helmets . 
  this is entirely for protection from dropbears which can inflict serious injuries should they attack the scalp . 
  [ here is a picture of a few aussie men having a break outside their office .

  strictly speaking liberalism is n't leftist to begin with . 
  most of them have long since sold out to soc-dems or the right , but there are still quite a few of them . 
  i seriously doubt that the uk government has n't been doing this already . 
  in decline . 
  just as i thought `` ugliest country of europe '' was this sub 's rock bottom . 
  his history agrees . 
  sure . 
  but i doubt it will last much longer given the current circumstances . 
   is n't melania from ... that slovakia ? 
  bosnia is amazing . 
  other than that sicily was the crown jewel of italy for me . 
  generally pc as valve games and lol still dominate the market . 
  the console community increased in 2013 with the launch of ps4 , but it 's still tiny . 
  the concept of ethnic guilt is idiotic . 
  actions of the few do n't warrant an apology of the many . 
  i highly doubt germans or any other europeans care about heritage . 
  we do n't care where your great-great-grandparents came from . 
  not muslim , but slavoj \u017di\u017eek explained the rise of conservative religious groups with the disappearance of many left-wing parties . 
  til, 
  no worries , it looks like [ you 've made a comeback ] ( http://www.zdnet.com/article/snoopers-charter-expansive-new-spying-powers-becomes-law/ ) . 
  taught a syrian man how to use an automated checkout machine . 
  he was well spoken and polite . 
  the jealousy thing . 
   now why do you have such a low opinion of yourself ? 
  [ this little guy . 
  a thousand extra muslims wo n't make slovenia any more islamic . 
  i 've seen both ultra conservatives and folk that would make stalin look like an anarchist . 
  therefore i ca n't really definitively say . 
  we can barely tolerate each other in-school . 
  forcing us to attend a pointless fucking sports event would likely result in a shitstorm of fights or worse . 
  only regional or national teams mater to most of us . 
  careful there , you 're reaching the australian level of banter . 
  surprised that they managed to stay afloat even when most of the giant companies collapsed . 
  pretty sure there was an ad a decade or so ago which bluntly stated that you should sub to x mobile provider and not y. 
  obviously got taken down .
