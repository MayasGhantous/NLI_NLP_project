alenka bratu\u0161ek is alde, 
  the policy did not work ? 
  it was perfect , it just was not enforced aggressively enough ( variation : communism did not work ? 
  no , it was perfect , just not applied properly ) . 
  you are a tool . 
  greeks can not repay their debts no matter how much austerity they exercise . 
  even more : more they commit to austerity masohism , less can they repay . 
  but to understand this , you must understand first , why household metaphor does not work for a country . 
  you obviously do not ( it has nothing to do with `` complexity '' ) . 
  google it . 
   sorry but my good sense tells me that you don \u00b4 t solve a debt problem raising more debt lol after years austerity , greece have neever been more indebted than today . 
  it is waaaaaaay more bankrupt than at the start of this austerity madness . 
  german , soulmates the czech republic and austria . 
  i guess , 500 years of germanic overlords takes its toll , 
  another point : slovenia had a deal with russia about southstream for years . 
  the eu put heavy preassure on slovenia about that ( against eu legislation , eu interests , ... ) , especially after recent events . 
  ( we are not the only one : bulgaria http://www.focus-fen.net/news/2014/04/07/332322/barroso-we-tell-bulgaria-to-be-careful-with-gas-connections-with-russia.html ) and , of course , slovenian politicians began dragging feet under eu pressure . 
  russia was annoyed . 
  and then comes the deal with austria ( slovenia is not needed anymore for the success of southstream ) . 
  game over . 
  russia played one member of the eu against the other . 
  unsportlich , austria & total failure of the eu common policy . 
   you are willing to use the exact same methods and mentality while pretending to have the moral high ground . 
  you did not get it that i was applying your `` position '' ... to demonstrate : '' what a nice , civilized society suddenly is born when tolerance , respect and acceptance of the `` other '' are thrown out , is it ? '' ? 
  why would i need arguments ? 
  according to you , it is my right to judge you as a prick , a bully and close relative of various religious fundamentalists . 
  and it is my right to act upon those judgements and cast you out of the circle of respectable and deserving of equality . 
  and the usual societal expectations of rational debate , tolerance , respect and acceptance are just my `` liberal sensibilities '' , no need to fret about them . 
  if even after this is not clear , that your position is the core mentality of every bully and every fundamentalist ... 
  i give up . 
  yeah . 
  what a nice , civilized society suddenly is born when tolerance , respect and acceptance of the `` other '' are thrown out , is it ? 
  your world ( and of every fundamentalist , who reserve every right to judge and punish others ) . 
  ideology of a bully . 
  of course you do . 
  but that does not mean , that you are not an asshole . 
  a prick . 
  so , in essence : your are just a judgemental asshole . 
  funny thing ... you are so full of labels and name calling ( `` liberal progressivist/cultural marxist ideology '' wtf is that ? 
  ) , but oblivious of your own ideolocial constructs ( `` proper gender roles '' lol ) and ideology ( traditional gender roles/power structures ) . 
  i would pay  ( in slovenia licensing fee is 152 euros ... which is much more expensive for an average slovenian household ) . 
  lol raiffeisen , the bank that financed one of the biggest financial fuckups in the whole history of slovenia . 
  800 milllion euros down the drain ... a least . 
  oh , thanks god !, 
  it is not slovenia again  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-10/u-s-falls-behind-slovenia-in-latest-review-of-population-health.html, 
  you can have dinamo , can we get rijeka , please ? 
   together we can beat our version of ~ ~ satan ~ ~ marki\u0107 http://www.slovenija-danes.slovenci.si/modules/aktualno/uploads/ljudmila_novak.jpg they even look alike . 
  ex-comunist countries were/are not a monolith . 
  for example ; slovenia has the oldest gay and lesbian film festival in europe and the lgbt movement was a very visible part of the democratic movements in the 80s . 
  homosexuality was decriminalized in 1976 ( deep in communist era ) . 
  czechoslovakia decriminalised homosexuality in 1962 . 
  conservative backslash followed the fall of the berlin wall , after which the church gained significant power ( political/economic ) in almost all states . 
  in some more ( croatia ) , in some less ( czech republic , slovenia ) ... but the church was back with the vengeance almost everywhere . 
  as a left-winger ( and believer in the european project ) , i really , really hope that they succeed & storm the next european elections big way . 
  this is the only way left to teach scumbags like olli rehn & dijsselbloem a well earned lesson : you can not sacrifice europeans at the altar of austerity without a big & painful price tag . 
  last , but important : rise of the far-right is always a consequence of failure of the left . 
  and the european left failed big time . 
  no , not all ex-yu `` states '' were profascist , only croatia and even there you did have a large partizan movement . 
  `` in a way which does n't have all the serbs under one state '' this were not serbian territories , but territories with heavily mixed populations . 
  serbs , croats , bosnians ... 
  so , no you did not get a free pass for slaughtering civilians and breaking down borders established ... i do not know ... at least few hundreds of years ago ( for example : kingdom of croatia , 925 : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/kingdom_of_croatia.png/586px-kingdom_of_croatia.png or this https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/austria-hungary_map_new.svg/776px-austria-hungary_map_new.svg.png ( habsburg monarchy ) . 
  there is no european state where all members of a specific nation live in one state . 
  so , in your logic ... slovenians are entitled to invade austria ? 
  italy ? 
  should hungary invade romania ? 
  should we kill italians in trieste ? 
  there was no injustice , only your stupidity and nationalistic delirium . 
  you did deserve everything you got . 
  but , hey ... you are limited to an area of beogradski pa\u0161aluk now . 
  you should know this by now . 
  sounds fucking logical . 
  oh , god no ... the half of the country is ashamed of him , the other half voted for him so that the other guy could not win . 
  pahor is an embarrassment , self-centered egoman without spine & substance . 
  in a way ( but in a fundamentally different way than with croats , bosnians ... & slovenians ) they are the `` victims '' : the politics of milo\u0161evi\u0107 was a disaster for serbs ; economically , politically , geographically ... from great serbia to ( almost ) beogradski pa\u0161aluk . 
  not because of the nato & some `` evil '' imperialistic politics ... 
  but because of milo\u0161evi\u0107 and people like \u0160e\u0161elj . 
  in ' 80 / '90s , with milo\u0161evi\u0107 , serbia descended into ultra-nationalistic & agressive society , that waged wars via jla & various para-military formations in slovenia , croatia , bih & kosovo . 
  srebrenica is not a mistake , it is a direct consequence of serbian politics of that time !, 
  and every single neighbour of serbia in that time prayed that `` the west '' finally does something . 
  after years & years of bloodshed ... they finally did it . 
  probably not without self-interest , but , hey , they took a lot of time & convincing . 
  after convictions of croats and bosnians at the icty , noone is claiming that everybody else is a saint . 
  every war is bloody & every war corrupts . 
  but this does not mean , that the distinction between a perpetrator & victim is meaningless . 
  but , hey , if you want to take lessons about morality of intl. 
  politics from a scum like \u0160e\u0161elj , who openly advocated ethnic cleansing , be my guest . 
  from `` funny '' tv shows ...  `` as as far as their army is concerned , you know , 20 or 30 chetniks quickly solve that problem ( laughter , applause ) , when from a thompson a bullet hits a croat in the forehead both of his eyes pop out and when a bullet hits him in the neck he becomes headless and there 's no need to slaughter him `` ( laughter applause ) http://inavukic.com/2012/03/05/vojislav-seselj-unadulterated-evil-to-give-closing-arguments-at-icty/ to this http://depo.ba/media/pictures/2012/04/22/b2c25fb62df0809e0d967c0acbd01972.jpg, 
  it is a blog !, 
  but you know that aready , too , i guess . 
  what a crap of an article . 
  the situation in kosovo was ( and still is ) much , much more complex than `` they were fighting a separatist movement , led by the kla '' . 
   so , price is the only problem there , is n't it ? 
  what about all the things i 've listed there , ratings , marketing revenues ( even if not in the case of bbc ) ? 
  which mean that it only makes sense to cover popular/mainstream opinions , otherwise someone can be offended/don ' t get it ? 
  essentially giving the viewer what he wants to hear , not `` the truth '' , they do n't have any incentive to tell them `` the truth '' whatever it is . 
  that has much bigger effect on channel 's bias than price . 
  good score with government officials and/or businesses , as they 're providing a lot of content , exclusives etc ? 
  which means they need to choose very carefully what can they say about them . 
  these are the issues/challenges the journalism in the west has been dealing with since ... ever . 
  in this some basic questions/prepositions have been developed , such as : 1 ) who owns the media organization ?
