  frequently i have the feeling that they are genuinely surprised that we have running water & electricity . 
  but there is no denying that the eastern europe has a huge problem with racism & intolerance . 
  `` the west is bad enough when it comes to treatment of the roma . '', 
  sarkozy had his moment , but ... hey http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8548417.stm ??? 
  `` what this article is calling for is a less culturally superior and condescending tone . '', 
  it 's the sun , worst of the worst !, 
  `` western pressure does n't necessarily work '' not always , but ... the promise of eu membership , for example , made wonders , 
  first , the eastern europe has a huge problem with racism and intolerance of different minority groups ( for example , lgbts ) . 
  treatment of roma gypsies in romania , bulgaria , hungary , and the czech and slovak republics , virulent anti-gay legislation in russia , neo-fascist jobbik party in hungary , delusional ultra-nationalism of victor orban , ... the list is almost endless . 
  second ; these problems will not go away with because `` the west is not perfect either '' statements . 
  the sun & other tabloids are moronic & discriminatory regardless of topic . 
  third ; western pressure to improve pluralism & democratic standards simply works . 
  eastern european political class wants too look good in the eyes of their western counterparts . 
  if this compels them to curb racism & intolerance ... hey , bring it on !, 
  hidden in the first sentence . 
  petersen institute & aslund books . 
  if you are swedish , swedish bank & consultant , paid by those banks , absolutely nothing is wrong with that . 
  all bad loans your banks foolishly made will be paid back . 
  great . 
  less so great on the other end . 
  anders aslund ? 
  swedish `` consultant '' , paid by swedish banks , who made sure that loans , made by swedish banks to baltic states will be paid in full ? 
  great . 
  slovenian tolar ( sit ) banknotes ( 1991 - 2007 , introduction of euro ) 10 sit http://www.bsi.si/library/includes/slika.asp?slikaid=61 20 sit http://www.bsi.si/library/includes/slika.asp?slikaid=59 100 sit http://www.bsi.si/library/includes/slika.asp?slikaid=63 200 sit http://www.bsi.si/library/includes/slika.asp?slikaid=64 500 sit http://www.bsi.si/library/includes/slika.asp?slikaid=65 1000 sit http://www.bsi.si/library/includes/slika.asp?slikaid=66 5000 sit http://www.bsi.si/library/includes/slika.asp?slikaid=158 10000 sit http://www.bsi.si/library/includes/slika.asp?slikaid=71 the banknote for 100 sit was probably the most dashing . 
  so colourful  no special stories about them , except they were new & young & designed by one of the best designers in the country . 
  how many designers can brag about that , ha ? 
  i do . 
  ideological bent of majority of users in this thread is ... let 's say interesting . 
  like reading a forum of some typical eastern european `` libertarians '' backed by heritage & other american right wing think tanks . 
  american money did wonders for ideological make-up of former communist states . 
  small countries , such as estonia or my country - slovenia , are always policy takers . 
  if angela says jump , we jump . 
  but ... there is a difference if you jump because you must or because you really & religiously believe in benefits of jumping after angela . 
  solutions for this mess will be ( or not ) made at the european level , but there is no need to be additionally cruel to your people & be even proud of it . 
  additionally ; solutions for small countries are totally different as solutions for the whole continent . 
  estonian level of austerity on an europe-wide level would be catastrophic . 
  not really . 
  even in the best of times , there will be unemployment . 
  people between jobs , people not looking for jobs at all ... 
  no , you have levels of unemployment that are hm ... let 's say `` reasonable '' . 
  16 % or 11 % is not . 
  and knowing eastern european creativity with unemployment statistics ... does not make things better . 
  how many people have fallen through the safety nets because of long-term unemployment ? 
  remember , it is a 5th year of global crisis . 
  response from krugman : http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/07/ballistic-in-the-baltics/?smid=tw-nytimeskrugman&amp;seid=auto&amp;pagewanted=all, 
  you can be serious . 
  even today , unemployment is way of the charts . 
  falling , rising ... whatever . 
  this is no time to be proud with surpluses , because this is the money you could use to help your people . 
  not saying , that you must do large deficit , but , please ... 
  you are not bailing out those you think you are . 
  greeks could default & game over , no need for a bailout . 
  you are bailing out banks from germany & france . 
  southern europe does not see this money at all . 
  ok , scenario : no bailout , german banks & economy go under . 
  where does this leave economies of eastern europe ? 
  under , under , under ... 
  shifting blame is a loosing game . 
  surplus in 2010 and 2011 unemployment : http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z8o7pt6rd5uqa6_&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;idim=country:ee&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:sa&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=estonia+unemployment surplus in times of 16 and 11 % unemployment . 
  dear god . 
  of course it was . 
  just like almost everywhere else . 
  there are much better `` success stories '' ( iceland , for example ) . 
  add . 
  budget surplus in times of double figures unemployment is not just wrong , its insanely cruel . 
  yes , there is so much to be jealous of !, 
  `` after a 20 % fall in gdp , estonia has seen a rebound , but gdp is still 10 % below 2007 peak . 
  unemployment has been in double figures for the past 4 years . '', 
  plus an extreme fall of purchasing power of the population and a huge problem with emigration , which will surely do wonders for the pension system in the future . 
  but , hey , they have budget surplus . 
  great !, 
  their `` success story '' , applied on an europe-wide scale , would be an unbelivable disaster . 
  pure right-wing populism in its worst form . 
  fiscally responsible vs fiscally profligate countries . 
  what a nonsense . 
  except from greece , countries in deep troubles today ( ireland , spain ... ) had been more fiscally responsible than germany . 
  who broke the maastricht rules first ? 
  germany and france !, 
  it 's not about damn fiscal policy , it 's about deep structural problems of euro . 
  omg . 
  after comments like this , i really wish greeks articulate a well-deserved `` fuck you '' and take german banks under . 
  wherever there is a reckless borrower , there is a reckless lender . 
  germany was a reckless lender and the whole europe is paying your bills now . 
  i could not care less about his children , he does not care about mine . 
  this is about those guys ... 
  they could accept pinochet chile as long they can be randian superheroes . 
  oh , you just got ta love this . 
  guy . 
  he does n't like french attitude towards extremely rich ... but authoritarian singapore ? 
  there he goes . 
  lovely . '', 
  i do n't share the values that emerged during the election '' . 
  spectator ? 
  oh , my ... like linking to pravda in the ussr . 
  future model ? 
  this guy is an idiot . 
  i bet that before 2008 , ireland was his `` future model '' . 
  low public debt , flexible labour laws , no bloated government , business-friendly taxation ... ireland before 2008 . 
  after more than 2 decades and the first generations that know yugoslavia only from books , `` meh '' would be a proper `` translation '' of the attitudes of the majority of slovenians towards yugoslavia . 
  some things were not so bad , but ultimately yugoslavia was beyond saving .
