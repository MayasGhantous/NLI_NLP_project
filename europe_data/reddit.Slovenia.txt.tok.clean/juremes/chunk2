  who controls it & how ? 
  sources of revenue ? 
  ( ads ? 
  subscription ? 
  both ? 
  subsidies ? 
  government ? ), 
  barriers between marketing & editorial processes ? 
  ... as a consequence , you have a whole spectrum of media types , from journalists-owned non-profit organizations , to european public services ... to corporate media ... and state media . 
  rt is a state media . 
  the worst answer to the challanges of journalism . 
   rt is an english language channel , virtually noone watching it in russia . 
  i know . 
  but if this is a beautified version of the real thing for the west ... what can i expect from the real thing ? 
  from the bbc , dipshit . 
  dipshit , i see cnn/aljazeera just marginally better than rt. 
  marginally . 
  bbc is better , but far from perfect exactly because the government can influence the subcription price ( british govermnent has some leverage ) . 
  rt it radically different . 
  it is putin 's whore ( no point in discussing , how much leverage - he has all the leverage he wants ) . 
   but very closely related to the point of view of majority of russian people . 
  with media like rt. ... true miracle !, 
  again : everyone is biased because no one can be free of its own ideology . 
  no one . 
  there is no ( absolute ) truth in media , only approximations and the truth-to - best-of-my-knowledge-and-capabilities . 
  and the last thing in very important , it is crucial . 
  it can be argued , that even the most respected media houses get things wrong because of bias & ideology of journalists . 
  it happens every day . 
  it is a fact of life . 
  we are all imperfect . 
  but their mission , their purpose , their goal ... is the truth - even when the ideal is always elusive . 
  they try ... and fail ... and ( sometimes ) succeed . 
  but there are media outlets , where the truth is completely irelevant - it is not the part of the equation . 
  they are not even trying !, 
  they have other purposes . 
  the only purpose of rt is to sell the politics of their paymasters to the western audiences . 
  everything else is in the function of this goal . 
  everything . 
  they are paying the bills . 
  so ; no reasonable & educated person can watch fox news and take it seriously . 
  and the same is true for rt. 
  it 's absolute garbage . 
  it is a disgrace for journalism . 
  every single journalist and media outlet is `` biased '' . 
  every single one . 
  no one lives outside its own ideology . 
  but only some media outlets are created as pure propaganda machines . 
  fox news is one example , rt is another . 
  or cnn . 
  `` even if rt is a mouthpiece of kremlin , it does n't yet mean they 're wrong . '', 
  being wrong ( or right ) is not part of their equation . 
  media and journalist can ( and do ) get things wrong because of their bias , but they try nontheless . 
  for rt. . . this is irrelevant . 
  its purpose , goals and measures of success are totally different . 
  it is a state television imported directly from communism - with better resolution and graphics . 
   as the presenter said they had a panel discussion on it in the last few days with all sides of the debate represented . 
  of course  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyholvuocn8#t=285 propaganda & whitewashing . 
  btw i think also that kirchick is right-wing nutter . 
  but this does not change the `` nature '' of rt. 
  wikipedia : russia today : `` it is registered as an autonomous non-profit organization [ 2 ] [ 3 ] funded by the federal budget of russia through the federal agency on press and mass communications of the russian federation '' rt cost $ 30 million to establish in 2005 [ 69 ] and $ 30 million for its first year of operation . 
  about half of the network 's budget came from the state and the other half from banks and companies friendly to the government . 
  [ 24 ] its budget in dollars was approximately $ 80 million in 2007 , $ 120 million in 2008 , $ 380 million in 2011 and $ 300 million in 2012 . 
  [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] putin has prohibited funding for russia today from being reduced as of october 30 , 2012 . 
  [ 76 ] it 's a pure propaganda machine . 
  not the only one in the world and many many western media are far from `` independent '' , but there is absolutely no doubt that the rt is a kremlin propaganda mouthpiece . 
  i did not said that . 
  in many ways it is more & more a deja vu from ex-yugoslavia . 
  secret orders , secret courts , legislation , intentionaly written so vague / broad , that can be used against anything/anyone , `` magic words '' that give the state a free pass ( now : national security & terrorism ; in yu : underming of the social order , anti-revolutionary behaviour ... ) . 
  if they suspected he was carrying stolen document , they should get a warrant issued upon probable cause & subject the whole process to judicial oversight . 
  you know ... courts & every other little thing that limit possibility of government overreach . 
  and are essential for any society that wants to call itself democratic . 
  but , hey , they just did not bother . 
  sleep well . 
   no , schedule 7 of the terrorism act 2000 gives leeway for police to stop individuals trying to exit the country without necessarily implying that the individual in question is a terrorist . 
  if this interpretation is true , it 's even worse . 
  you have a law called terrorism ( ! ), 
  act , sold to public as an anti-terrorism measure , but in reality so vague / broad that it can be used against anyone government does not like . 
   the guardian , on the other hand , is apparently happy to have spouses of journalists fly these files around all over the world . 
  `` we will continue to do patient , painstaking reporting on the snowden documents , we just wo n't do it in london . '', 
  http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/19/david-miranda-schedule7-danger-reporters wonder why ... hm ? 
  if this case ( and related destroying od discs at the guardian ) proves anything , they should absolutely keep these documents & journalists out of the uk . 
  a new rule of investigative journalism : if you get access to british secret documents , get them out of the uk as soon as possible . 
  and make as many copies as you can . 
   said individual was stopped by the police whilst transiting britain and had the files confiscated . 
  `` the spooks are not going to get the nsa files back ; that genie is well and truly out of the bottle . 
  so why do it ? 
  the conclusion must be , as greenwald speculates , that we were just roughing up his boyfriend in order to psyche him out . '', 
   not really of course it is . 
  it opens a very difficult debate about press in era of unprecedented level of state surveilance , when everything a journalist do can be tracked & monitored . 
  it is a huge wake up call for journalists & media . 
  you did not answer the key question : is he a terrorist ? 
  because he was detained under law specifically designed for terrorists . 
  would any state try to stop circulation of secret files ? 
  yes , of course . 
  but this is not the issue here . 
  the issue is that government can just slap a `` terrorist '' label on somebody & detain him/her for 9 hours . 
   what i 'm not behind are journalists exporting those secrets on their person to possibly hostile third countries like brazil . 
  `` and so one of the more bizarre moments in the guardian 's long history occurred -- with two gchq security experts overseeing the destruction of hard drives in the guardian 's basement just to make sure there was nothing in the mangled bits of metal which could possibly be of any interest to passing chinese agents '' http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/19/david-miranda-schedule7-danger-reporters thank god these documents & journalists are ( also ) outside the us/uk !, 
  because greenwald & snowden would surely join manning in prison if they were in the us/uk . 
  i guess you can not do much of reporting if you are in prison .
