  a ) if you grant him a status of a journalist , your case is even more weaker . 
  b ) `` he was stopped under a legitimate law '' so , is he a terrorist ? 
  `` but in any case , and in summary : if the questioning , detention , and search of miranda was for a purpose other than to determine if he was a terrorist , then it was unlawful . '', 
  actually , i did . 
  so , i if understand this correctly : intelligence agencies have global internet syping programs . 
  uk harasses an american journalist ( & his brasilian partner ) reporting about these programs . 
  and you are asking me why do i care ? 
  this is not true ( http://www.echr.coe.int/pages/home.aspx?p=court/judges&amp;c=#n1368718271710_pointer ) & echr decisions are generally one of the most highly regarded ( from legal perspective ) . 
  and mr. miranda is from brasil . 
  i guess , he cares , too . 
  you simply deserve a police state . 
  this is exactly the mindeset they ( the state ) are counting on . 
  apathy . 
  for example : you can donate to liberty . 
  http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/media/press/2013/detention-of-journalists-partner-highlights-the-scandal-of-schedule-7.php `` liberty has long argued that schedule 7 is overbroad legislation , ripe for misuse and discrimination , and currently has a case pending at the european court of human rights challenging the power '', 
  sorry , i do not understand : what mixed heritage ? 
  it 's the other way around `` from 1952 on , the slavko avsenik 's band began to appear in broadcasts , movies , and concerts all over the west germany , inventing the original `` oberkrainer '' sound that has became the primary vehicle of ethnic musical expression not only in slovenia , but also in germany , austria , switzerland , and in the benelux , spawning hundreds of alpine orchestras in the process . 
  the band produced nearly 1000 original compositions , an integral part of the slovenian-style polka legacy . 
  avsenik 's most popular instrumental composition is the polka that is titled `` na golici '' ( in slovene ) , or `` trompetenecho '' ( in german ) , and `` trumpet echoes '' ( in english ) . 
  oberkrainer music , which the avsenik ensemble popularized , is always a strong candidate for country ( folk ) music awards in slovenia and austria . 
  slavko and his brother , vilko , are usually credited as the pioneers of slovenian folk music , having solidified its style in the 1950s . '', 
  it depends who you ask . 
  if you ask slovenian hardcore right-wingers , yugoslavia was the hell on earth . 
  for the vast majority of the population , image in the rear-view mirror is somehow more mixed . 
  no one wants to go back , but for many ex-yu version of real-soc was not `` so bad , had many good things '' . 
  in that respect we are different from other ex-communist states . 
  our experience is different than that of balts , poles , hungarians ... who were ( basically ) occupied by the soviets . 
  we were not . 
  no red army here . 
  in yugoslavia , we as a nation got or vastly expanded our own universities , many national political & cultural institutions , ... almost the whole apparatus of an european nation . 
  women got voting rights and equality , once a heavily rural country had been industrialized and modernized very fast . 
  and for me personaly ... 
  i am glad that some the values of that times are with us even today . 
  we are one of the most egalitarian societies in the world . 
  ( oecd : '' inequality as measured by the gini coefficient is lowest in ** slovenia , denmark and norway ** '' ) another example is ljubljana gay & lesbian film festival , the ** oldest ** gay and lesbian film festival in europe !, 
  `` the ljubljana gay and lesbian film festival is a specialised non-competitive film festival focusing on international gay and lesbian cinema . 
  it was originally launched in 1984 , within the magnus festival , and as such is the oldest gay and lesbian film festival in europe and at the same time the oldest international film festival in slovenia . '', 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwkfyp5ppws fukaj in slovenian language : to have sex , 
  nope . 
  in slovenia , it is most probably a genetic disposition & exposure to alcohol thing . 
  we are so called `` wet culture '' . 
  the statistics place slovenia at the top of the list of worldwide alcohol consumption . 
  for example , the prevalence of alcohol-related psychiatric disorders is the best predictor of the regional variation in slovenian suicide rates . 
  we loaned you jo\u017ee ple\u010dnik , you gave us franti\u0161ek \u010c\u00e1p , 
  as a teenager , i hated this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j00r4ymg7ac so much . 
  it was everywhere . 
  `` a slovene ambassador in a european capital , who asked not to be identified , says his staff meets someone from the local slovak embassy at least once a month to exchange wrongly addressed mail . '', 
  more than that : `` during the 14th century , most of the slovene lands passed under the habsburg rule . 
  in the 15th century , the habsburg domination was challenged by the counts of celje , but by the end of the century the great majority of slovene-inhabited territories were incorporated into the habsburg monarchy . 
  most slovenes lived in the administrative region known as inner austria , forming the majority of the population of the duchy of carniola and the county of gorizia and gradisca , as well as of lower styria and southern carinthia . '', 
  part of habsburgs monarchy till the end in 1918 . 
  you can not give up your constitutionaly garanteed rights , such as privacy . 
  any such contract/law would be void . 
   non-partisan third party who is this ? 
  god ? 
  because no-one is really non-partisan . 
  and how much power would this `` party '' get ? 
  from whom ? 
  for whom ? 
  who watches the watchers ? 
  but the more power you have , the more corrupt you 're likely to be - true also for non-partisan party . 
  not true , again . 
  epp ( european people 's party ) has been vehemently defending orban policies in the european parliament and blocking any serious measures . 
  why would merkel & sakozy & co. block this if orban was harming their interests ? 
  you see a crack in your reasoning ? 
  only in recent months epp signaled some willingnes to get tougher with budapest . 
  lol yeah ... the left european parties , that got suspicious of orban first , are normaly the first usual suspects of imf/monsanto / ... conspiracy  dream on ... 
  how many non-state internet providers do we have ? 
   are they any bettter ? 
  lol foreign-owned si.mobil ( owned by the telekom austria group ) has the mobile network build from absolute crap . 
  soviet networks would be more reliable . 
  if this is the level of network availabilty they offer in austria , too ... i feel really sorry for austrians . 
  and i can realy hardly wait that ts will be bought by the monstrosity of deutsche telekom . 
  not !, 
  lol , 
   that does n't change the fact that we are on the eastern side of the continent . 
  it depends ... what if your capital is more western than wienna ? 
  ( as in the case of ljubljana , the capital of slovenia ? ), 
  western europe ? 
  probably not . 
  eastern europe ? 
  hm ... is wienna part of the eastern europe ? 
  probably not . 
  really ? 
  did you read the whole article ? 
  even more scary shit : `` the hungarian parliament recently passed a new national security law that enables the inner circle of the government to spy on people who hold important public offices . 
  under this law , many government officials must `` consent '' to being observed in the most intrusive way ( phones tapped , homes bugged , email read ) for up to two full months each year , except that they wo n't know which 60 days they are under surveillance . '', 
  hehe  let me put it another way : should we ban sex because we have sex addicts ? 
  wtf ? 
  sorry , but i know the definition of addiction perfectly well , thank you very much . 
  and i repeat : your articles are about addiction ( to porn ) , not internet porn per se . 
  not the same thing . 
  is porn potentially addictive ? 
  of course it is . 
  anything that gets your serotonin/adrenalin/whatever levels going has this potential . 
  but the main problem is always with the particular user ( his personality ) , not in the stuff he is using . 
  simply said : something is very wrong way before he/she began ( ab ) using `` something '' . 
  or should we ban work because we have workoholics ? 
  the vast majority of drug addicted patients is diagnosed with some form of personality disorders/problems . 
  drug addiction is only a consequence of their psychological problems .
