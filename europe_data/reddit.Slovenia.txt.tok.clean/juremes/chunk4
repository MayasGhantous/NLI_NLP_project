  no , this are not studies about internet porn , they are about addiction . 
  and people can get addicted to basically anything . 
  do you want limit access to food because some people are addicted to it ? 
  maybe chocolate ? 
  sugar ? 
  excercise ? 
  meh , this is ueber naive . 
  the ioc does n't care about anything beside money . 
  and putin has money , a lot of money ( the most expensive games in history ) . 
  `` the west '' can not do anything really . 
  nothing will be effective . 
  maybe we could deny eu entry to the main authors of anti-gay legislation ( no more fancy holidays ) and expel their dimwit children ( no more traveling & studying abroad ) , but this is about it . 
  we can only watch russian descent into barbarism & hope for some internal backslash/opposition . 
  croatia has a 50 % stake in kr\u0161ko nuclear plant . 
  croatian households that get electricity from kr\u0161ko might disagree . 
  i have never said we were innocent , no one is , you piece of shit . 
  maribor is a slovenian city after 500 hundred years of germanic occupation & colonisation . 
  no war crimes were committed at holmec . 
  if you want war crimes , go look to your country . 
  you will have plenty of job there . 
  mass graves ? 
  yes , we fucked up with erased . 
  you know what ? 
  when will you be paying damages to kosovars as we are about to pay to erased ? 
  fucking dipshit , we were colonized by germans for 500 years !, 
  and you are bullshiting us because we drove them out of our our cities and our land after ww2 - when they condemned us as a nation to oblivion , when we were dying in concentration camps ? 
  burn in hell . 
  majority of the population in prekmurje was/is slovenian . 
  hungarians are minority . 
  we have slovenian minority in hungary . 
  but then again ... even if your claim was true ... we conquered utterly amazing area in size of a fucking munich suburb . 
  yes , we are the great conquistadors in disguise , 
  we survived as a tiny nation at the crossroad of germanic/roman/slavic cultures . 
  meaning : we are tough sons of a bitch  2 . ), 
  we have n't conquered/enslaved/colonise ... anyone . 
  so , no need for slovenian post-colonial shamefest . 
  yay !, 
  but there is a slightly less cheery interpretation : we have not conquered anyone because we were always to small . 
  researchers of the national character are quite convinced that this is for the best . 
  see point 1 & sons of a bitch . 
  we invented `` samoupravljanje '' ( self-management ) ( http://www.politicsforum.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=101013 ) . 
  it did not quite work as intended , but in general a noteworthy idea . 
  we invented communism that was not totally shitty & had some good qualities ( `` masterminds '' of yugoslavian economic model were mostly slovenians ; see edvard kardelj & self-management ) . 
  we dreamt of space exploration , space stations and satellites . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herman_poto%c4%8dnik 6 . ), 
  as a tiny , tiny nation of 1 million ( slovenian population in 40s ) we established `` partizans '' and bravely fought germans in wwii . 
  we were exposed at austrian sense for fashion and austrian dialect of german language for 500 years and survived mentally somehow stable , 
  where do you get that greece is reducing its debt ? 
  greek debt at 160.5 % of gdp in 2013 q1 after biggest y-o-y rise in eu http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_22/07/2013_510598, 
  even if you count athens larger urban zone , it is not 50 % ( not even close ) . 
  and mykonos ... really ? 
  a tiny island you can manage with a moped ? 
  gdp per capita is roughly the same . 
  `` many other places in greece are going through an economic boom '' doubtful ( see gdp ) `` foundation for future studies '' lol the foundation for future studies , an initiative of british american tobacco  it 's a sham, 
  wait , greece is somehow better than slovenia ? 
  we have troubles , no denying it , but i have a feeling that greeks would kill for our debt-to-gdp ratio , general & youth unemployment , social equality , welfare services , and export as a percentage of gdp and long-term economic prospects . 
  every operating system in use today has family control settings ( vista , windows 7 , windows 8 ... all os x versions still in use ... you can download a free solution even for windows xp ) . 
  but no ... you would rather spend millions of tax payers money ( in economic crisis ) & infringe on the freedom of others & possibly pave the path to even more widescale censoring & filtering of the internet ... because you are so dumb/lazy/ignorant that you can not find `` on '' button in control panel ? 
  you do not get downvotes because of your opinion , but because your argument stinks . 
  what else can we expect from a country , that has gone full retard in recent years ? 
  exhibit 1 : http://www.delo.si/assets/media/picture/20121018/panorama__delo_foto_2012101.3_hires.jpeg2.jpeg?rev=4 ( brand new `` neoclassical '' shit in the capital city ) exhibit 2 : http://www.delo.si/assets/media/picture/20121018/panorama__delo_foto_2012101_hires.jpeg0.jpeg?rev=1 exhibit 3 : http://www.delo.si/assets/media/picture/20121018/panorama__delo_foto_2012101.4_hires.jpeg3.jpeg?rev=2 exibit 4 : http://www.delo.si/assets/media/picture/20121018/panorama__delo_foto_2012101.2_hires.jpeg1.jpeg?rev=1 laughing stock of the region . 
  ( sorry , macedonians , but get your shit together , please ), 
  the euro could ( can ? ), 
  work , but not in the present institutional/ideological framework . 
  the main problem is not economic ( we basically know what is needed for euro to be long term viable ) , it is political . 
   ecb news like `` greek deficit reduced '' read like soviet era reports on tractor factory production figures - irrelevant statistics with little relevance to real people . 
  yes . 
  it is a bad joke . 
  in times of the greatest crisis of the european project , we are left with second rate technocrats/politicians without long-term vision and deeper understanding of basic economics . 
  but they are masters in producing euphemisms . 
  one of more unpleasant surpises of this crisis is , that there is not much of a difference between economic knowledge of slovenian & european politicians / decision makers . 
  they are all clueless as a goat . 
  olli rehn is a talking disaster , ecbs boss draghi makes mistakes that would not be tolerated in the first year of study of economics . 
  if there was a court for economic blunders , dijsselbloem would be shot instantly & burried in an unmarked grave . 
  preferably in cyprus . 
  you need more jobs , especially for youth . 
  will market forces eventually ( long-term ) solve this ? 
  yes . 
  emigration , better competitiveness via lower wages , demography ... 
  but it is absolutelly barbaric to sacrifice the whole generation waiting this to happen . 
   the biggest provider is even threatening to abolish flat rates . 
  yay !, 
  this biggest provider is the most likely buyer of telekom slovenia ... :( ts actually does not suck : fiber 20/20 mbps + tv + hbo + phone for 39 euros . 
  flat rate , very reliable . 
  the bureau of investigative journalism estimates the following cumulative statistics about us drone strikes : [ 27 ] ( as of march 2013 ) total strikes : 366 total reported killed : 2,537 - 3,581 civilians reported killed : 411 - 884 children reported killed : 168 - 197 total reported injured : 1,174 - 1,465 strikes under the bush administration : 52 strikes under the obama administration : 314 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/drone_attacks_in_pakistan, 
  hehe . 
  now imagine slovenians where the greatest compliment a foreigner can give is `` oh , you are just like/better than germans '' . 
  500 hundred years of austro-germanic cultural/state/industrial integration really leaves a lasting impression  and then comes angela ... oh , what now ... how can we reconcile this with our national instincts ? 
  we are on the verge of schizophrenia . 
   of course this will never be allowed to be part of the major consensus narrative maybe , probably ... 
  i still hope that sooner than latter we will see actions like us/nato drone strikes in pakistan as pure acts of state terrorism ... and be ashamed . 
   if you do n't condemn the murder of an innocent person ... 
  it is more complex than that . 
  lee rigby was a soldier , a willing participant in an endless war against the terrorism . 
  he was not a civilian , he was according to the international law ( greatly `` redefined '' after 9/11 ) a combatant . 
  therefore he was a legitimate target . 
  all our soldiers & military installations are legitimate targets . 
  the whole mess is a fine example of our hypocrisy : our soldiers are/were killing people in iraq , afghanistan ... our drones regularly kill people in pakistan ( international law violations in every way imaginable ) . 
  but when the other side strikes back at legitimitate targets - soldiers !, 
  no , it is not .
