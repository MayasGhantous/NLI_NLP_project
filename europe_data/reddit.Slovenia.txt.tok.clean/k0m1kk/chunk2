  yes , i 've seen them in the trailer :d edit : also the leader of the press team . 
  interesting ... 
  i wonder when they 'll air it here , seeing as how borgen was a pretty big succes . 
  yeah , both spellings are correct in english . 
  yup , and the noun is spelled [ na\u00efvet\u00e9 ] ( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/naivet%c3%a9 ) . 
  no , really , more like 10 . 
  [ federal republic of yugoslavia .

  this is a great song , though . 
  i think the cia one is more accurate , though i would place the baltics in northern europe and switzerland in central europe , personally . 
  edit : i 've just noticed that cyprus is classified as middle east , so that does n't work either . 
  go , avenge us , even though it was our fault it ended up the way it did ( shame on you australia ) . 
  yeah , i really do feel at home in vienna as well . 
  ah , it was my mistake . 
  it appears my german is wrong , not your english . 
  your flag is rather red , though . 
  what about words like * na\u00efvet\u00e9 * ? 
  you use the umlaut/dieresis above the i aswell . 
  this translation is ... vague . 
  if by most , you mean all , then yes ... 
  they have bears in the castle . 
  bears !,

  yeah , apart from the whole romanization of slovenes in territories annexed in 1918 ...  in venezia giulia , fascism attempted to realise  a programme of total  destruction of the slovene and croatian national identity . 
  the success of these  endeavours was only moderate , not due to a lack of will , but to the fact that neither in  this field nor in any other were there enough resources available ;  consequently , the  totalitarianism of the fascist regime often lagged far behind its intentions . 
  the  assimilation policy had decimated the slovene population in trieste  and gorizia  , the intellectuals and the middle  class representatives were scattered and  the rural  population turned into a working class . 
  source : http://www.mzz.gov.si/fileadmin/pageuploads/foto/1302/porocilo_mesane_zgodovinske_komisije_rs-fjk_1880-1956_ang.pdf pages 6-11 to put some perspective - there were far more slovenes living in trieste than ljubljana at the time , and the whole trieste region is still mostly inhabited by slovenes . 
  quite . 
  nobody says laibach anymore . 
  nope , i copy-pasted it to check . 
  it 's deffinitely an upper case ` i ' . 
  the capital of slovenia is called ljubljana , not ijubljana . 
  poland big . 
  lidl food for a wedding . 
  kind of sad , really . 
  from here to ukraine is closer than from ukraine to russia . 
  if ukraine is fully annexed , russia will suddenly be very close . 
  interesting how everyone sees themselves as being the most compassionate . 
  i suppose we 've had our fair share of medals at the olympics this year . 
  which is perfectly reasonable , right ? 
  just what i was about to say , haha .

  as are cases and grammatical numbers . 
  give poland 30 years and it 's sheer size will make it more relevant . 
  at least in european affairs . 
  not the op , but oh well ... 
  the title is in slovene . 
  it says : performance of russian soldiers in ljubljana the performance was done to honour the russian pows that died in an avalanche in 1916 during wwi . 
  it 's an event that takes place each year , though this year it was met with controversy , mostly because of the ukraine crisis , as can also be seen from the comment section on youtube .

  hey were not on here :( i was really interested to see how marrying germans for the past 500 years changed our genetic breakdown . 
  [ slovenian girl ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1224373/ ) edit : someone 's beat me to it . 
  yeah , which is really odd . 
  should n't it be freundliche wettkampf ? 
  as in a friendly competition , not a competition in friendliness ? 
  the slovene text translates to 30 years of friendly international fire fighter 's competition . 
  no , not since 1948 . 
  i 'd link but i 'm on my mobile . 
  you can google the tito-stalin split of 1948 . 
  no , yugoslavia was not a warsaw pact nation . 
  hmmm , we 're painting ours orange or blue and making parks around them , so the renovated ones look quite pleasant , actually . 
  80 million germans mate ... 
  trieste was actually italian , but all of the surrounding valleys were mostly inhabited by slovenians, 
  oh really , now ... prague is several hundred kms western from vienna , and yet austria is western and the czech republic is eastern europe . 
  well the italians were extremely oppressive to the slovenes living in the area . 
  death by vodka . 
  they 're all dead now , are n't they ? 
  42 % seems really high ... we do usually top the german as a foreign language tests , though . 
  which habsburgs ? 
  i wonder whether supply around here will get affected . 
  the price of marijuana has been dropping for the past 2 years ... 
  this will be interesting to monitor . 
  no , they are not . 
  eastern european countries are : the ukraine , moldova , belarus and russia . 
  the baltics are northern europe and romania and bulgaria are southeastern europe . 
  the rest should be pretty easy to place . 
  edit : apparently geography is taught differently all over the place . 
  interesting how the city is named [ grozny ] ( https://translate.google.com/#sl/en/grozni ) . 
  might be a coincidence ? 
  [ for this to also be true our prices should get really high in the next few years .

  well ... 
  in geography classes in slovenia , slovenia is considered a part of central europe , both geographically and culturally . 
  edit : to further this point , my geography teacher back in elementary school only gave me half a point when i said that croatia was in the balkans . 
  as i 've said before -- people disagree on where the balkans begin , but everyone seems to agree it starts right below them . 
  no , it 's not . 
  it 's also med , but it 's pronounced differently . 
  a copule of years ago i saw an advertisment for homemade honey , but the person who made it looked up the wrong word in the dictionary when they translated it to german . 
  the advertisment ended up saying ` zwischen verkauf ' instead of ` h\u00f6nig verkauf ' . 
  only ` med ' in slovene . 
  i see . 
  thanks for the clarifications . 
  not in slovenia , no . 
  our national tv quoted it as a source . 
  according to al jazeera rouglhy 25 000 km ^ 2 are covered by water . 
  i do n't know ... as a slovene i have little issues in understanding slovak , whereas chech is rather difficult ... 
  quite . 
  i have also personally noted , that words that are used in modern croatian are often archaic words in slovene , which we will recognise , but not use , or words that are similar to a slovene word that is close in meaning .
