  what is his stance on isis ? 
  i feel so much better that they are still in turkey . 
  close call . 
  could you explain a little bit more about what exactly you disagree with the article ? 
  my bias : anti-eu , do n't give a shit about greece , or varuafuckis, 
  abu hajaar got asssylum in germany . 
  you sure ? 
  are n't a lot of countries pretty down already ? 
  nonsense , look how well greece turned out . 
  what are syrians doing in libya ? 
  email and ask them , i do n't have secret agenda for your country . 
  it 's quite simple we only need more pro-turk propaganda in schools . 
  so that the next generation will be completely brainwashed . 
  lucky for slovenia soros is already doing it with his ngos :  politics :  goals  1 . 
  to include turkey in our eu/wb enlargement projects . 
  visa liberalization for kosovo and for turkey .

  it 's me being flippant about non integrated multikulti society . 
  yes , very shocked . 
  brussels did 9.11 . , right ? 
  scroll to the bottom of the page , on the right side under : in partnership with , also krytyka polityczna is his organization . 
  i am beyond shocked , he seemed like such a nice guy . 
  it has to be so otherwise soros 's open society foundations would n't be paying for it . 
  also a lot of top universities , and school results of migrants are off the charts . 
  islamisation will be fun !, 
  how big was your delegation to rio ? 
  what kind of a punishment would he receive if he did n't have diplomatic immunity - since he is a minor . 
  and luckily a lot of unaccompanied children from iraq migrate to eu every day . 
  and then we are even more blessed when they are reunited with their families . 
  i have great doubts if this is indeed halal . 
  does france brake those statistics by religion ? 
  i wish to see how racist are the french to the muslims . 
  this is disgusting . 
  female genital mutilation is the way to go . 
  this country will self destruct not being in the eu , and not having euro . 
  how much they could benefit by outsourcing their decisions to honest & competent public servants in brussels . 
  he will have a captive audience . 
  great football players , also basketball ... 
  because the same countries that do n't give a shit about what happens to the economies of the peripheral europoor countries , will gladly go to war for them . 
  brussels did 9/11 . 
  what 's wrong with racism , seems to be working for israel . 
  you ( i am assuming you are israeli ) can always stop profiting from the african diamonds - and leave them to africans , and you can stop selling them arms . 
  my hats off to you . 
  * have to agree with you . 
  i 'm assuming you are also somalian . 
  yes , nato pakistan . 
  jump-start the emigration process , have to do zero paper-work , get free accommodation while you learn the language , plan a family when you get out - now you have english relatives -- sit back and relax while the tax payers pay for you . 
  when should we start worrying that a nuclear country is going sharia ? 
  if not , how about putin , or isis ? 
  islamic exceptionalism : how the struggle over islam is reshaping the world https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flrfes7z4gy, 
  do n't forget the white flag . 
  could you explain `` having control over the german economy ? '', 
  what about spain - their `` books showed reality , '' how many billions did they save ? 
  you mean like accepting common currency ... and saving billions ? 
  are you f-ing kidding me . 
  fix greece first , then and only then should the brussels bozos be allowed an army , so that we can go around spreading freedom , federation and lebensraum for german companies . 
  do you with fuck mean give him free money , and let him make a fool out of our most glorious federalising union . 
  or else ? 
  maybe irish people need to be less flippant about uk leaving , or will the exports to uk , be offset with more tax fraud on the rest of eu . 
  dude , where is siemens mobile ? 
  how about chinese huawei , zte , xiaomi . 
   according to the rules , the fine can be up to 0.2 percent of the country 's gdp and the suspension of commitments or payments from the structural funds up to 0.5 percent . 
  but the commission can propose them to be equal to zero . 
  hint : they do n't have the german currency . 
  what 's next , african union giving us advice ? 
  sure , why not move to nigeria then . 
  good points . 
  i am still anti burqa , niqab ... 
  to rob a bank . 
  so you have joined him in `` simplifying to the point of the text being merely a poorly constructed rant '' except that you are pro eugoslavia . 
  as a ex-yugoslavian i would strongly disagree about lack of a precedent , and you may want to talk to any number of periphery countries about their economic ... 
  so you are against brainwashing people with viable `` nationalism , '' and want fantasy `` europeanism . '', 
  which is kind of interesting , you coming form an ex soviet satellite where they tried to build :  ** the new soviet man ** or new soviet person ( russian : \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a novy sovetsky chelovek ) , as postulated by the ideologists of the communist party of the soviet union , was an archetype of a person with certain qualities that were said to be emerging as dominant among all citizens of the soviet union , irrespective of the country 's cultural , ethnic , and linguistic diversity , creating a single soviet people , soviet nation . 
  glad to see that we do n't learn from history !, 
  and this time its different . 
  what do you expect us to do - realize that all the peripheral europoor countries are merely vassal states meant to keep the euro down , and provide educated and cheep workforce for germany . 
  and that france is one recession away from being italy , which is one recession away from being greece ? 
  so kind sir - let us enjoy brexit , and let us forget about our problems , and let us demonize britain and let us continue with our glorious federalization . 
  we are made weak by time and fate , but strong in self delusion . 
  he could also be a little pissed . 
  sorry but this has to be down voted . 
  ca n't have europoors questioning why the same is n't happening here . 
  vw did nothing wrong . 
  not really . 
  but i apologized . 
  what 's the point of this vitriol ? 
  how are the two related ?? 
  is this tread becoming a pro eu cult ? 
  this is my tl ; dr ( stuff in brackets is my speculation ) but we must also acknowledge that ** support and passion for our common project has faded ** over the last decade in parts of our societies . 
  france and germany remain most firmly of the belief that the european union provides a unique and indispensable framework for the ** pursuit of freedom , prosperity and security ** in europe , for shaping peaceful ... ** we will therefore move further towards political union in europe and invite the other europeans to join us in this endeavour . 
  ** looking back at the history of the european edifice , we strongly believe in the strength of the eu and its ability to overcome these situations . 
  but something is new in these critical times , namely the perception that these crises jeopardise the very fabric of our societies , our values , our way of life .
