well they did cross in the opposite direction . 
  i worked in a migrant center , we had tons of albanians and kosovars . 
  i 'm sorry , it was not my intention to ruin your joke . 
  although you ca n't see it on this map but we have 4 and we 're tiny . 
  mediterranean , alpine , continental and pannonian . 
   iron curtain you need your history knowledge revised .

  yea ... follow our example - . - we only have 2 wind turbines in the whole country because birds are more important . 
  we join you cyprus . 
  let 's summon malta , andorra , liechtenstein , monaco and luxembourg . 
  i have never ever heard of this or anything similar : /, 
  slovenia , too insignificant again . 
  i never said it was ? 
  tourism is just an example i used . 
  hello ? 
  we exsist . 
   some cities like s\u00e8te or b\u00e9ziers have specific accents even if they are less than 30 klm apart . 
  lol , 30km here brings you to a whole different dialect group . 
  it 's `` new village , new micro-dialect '' here . 
  that usually means there 's just a hill inbetween . 
  no , our first books were written * in 1550 and first grammar book in 1584 . 
  the oldest document in slovene is over 1000 years old and is the oldest slavic text written in latin script . 
  we were one of the first to have a bible translated to our language . 
  the first regional standards of slovene go back to the 18th century when they also started writing books in dialects . 
  it 's because people that settled here came from a lot of different directions and brought their language features with them . 
  also because of mountains and hills people did n't have much contact with eachother . 
  is it ? 
  trying to balance protected areas with an increasing number of tourists on a small land is not easy . 
  tourists are much more noticaeble and destructive on smaller areas . 
  that 's questionable . 
  there 's a known user hiding under many different usernames . 
  we have ` potato ' holidays every year around november 1st for a week . 
  so no school . 
  31st october ( reformation day ) and 1st november are also work free days . 
  you can get them in every small neighbourhood shop here . 
  they 're a staple fruit , like apples , strawberries , peaches , oranges and bananas . 
  we have a kiwi plant , ca n't tell you much about it except that it gives lots and lots of fruit and it 's very good and very sweet , way better than store bought ones . 
  they are a bit smallish though . 
  i definitely recommend . 
  it sounds kind of like albanian with an irish accent to me . 
  where did you get those numbers ? 
  for 2014 it says that 102,8 men and 78,4 women died per 100.000 people . 
  [ slovenia ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/thumb/8/8a/deaths_from_ischaemic_heart_diseases_%e2%80%94_standardised_death_rate%2c_2013.png/777px-deaths_from_ischaemic_heart_diseases_%e2%80%94_standardised_death_rate%2c_2013.png ) is between uk and italy . 
  the ones i 've seen on some german and hungarian tv that i remember , did n't have subs . 
  yea , i checked , ours does n't have subs either . 
  depends on your remote . 
  i press ok , then once down and then choose english . 
  uh , extramarital unions , as they are called here , in slovenia are equal to marriage . 
  couples have all the same rights . 
  ca n't you change between dubbed and subtitled version on disney and nickelodeon ? 
  we can . 
  i do n't understand dubbing and voice overs at all . 
  what about deaf people ? 
  are they not supposed to watch foreign movies ? 
  jota croatian ? 
  it 's an istrian dish , not only croatian . 
  trieste croatian ? 
  lol . 
  if anything , it should have been slovenian , but it 's not . 
  my dad does n't sew and bake , but he does everything else . 
  and my mom looooves mowing lawn and preparing wood for winter on a table saw lol . 
  get yourself a tumble dryer . 
  no wrinkles and no ironing . 
  certainly true for my family . 
  since my dad got home from work earlier than my mom he was the one that made lunch on the weekdays . 
  gentleman as he is , he even cleaned the dishes most of the time and my mom made coffee . 
  he also cleaned everything in the morning when he had a pm shift and prepared lunch so that when my mom got home all she had to do was heat it . 
  my mom cooked on the weekends while he was doing stuff around our weekend house . 
  now that they live in a house in the countryside he does even more than 2 hours per day . 
  he 's constantly doing something . 
  it 's pretty much how it is here . 
  105 days of maternity leave then 260 days of shared parental leave . 
  so if a mother takes it all she gets 12 months of a 100 % paid leave , 1 month prior birth and 11 months after birth . 
  kindergardens start accepting kids at age around 11 months . 
  they are income adjusted and one of the best in the world . 
  also 3rd most expensive ... but whatever . 
  this is a weird graph . 
  anyway , for slovenia . 
  we have maternal leave , paternal leave and parental leave . 
  ** maternal leave ** is used to prepare for the birth of a child , care of the child immediately after birth and for protection of mother 's health during and after childbirth . 
  it 's usually mother who has the right to this , but in some cases under certain conditions ( death of a mother , abandonment of a child , mother temporarily or permanently unable to take care of a child ) also father of the child , one of the grandparents or a 3rd person ( 105 days - 28 days = 77 days ) . 
  maternal leave lasts 105 working days and starts 28 days before predicted dob . 
  maternal leave is paid 100 % and is not limited . 
  ** paternal leave ** is a leave for fathers to help the mother care for a child in its early days . 
  it lasts 90 calendar days . 
  first 15 days have to be used until a child is 6 months old and the rest , 75 days until a child is 3 years old . 
  first 15 days are paid 100 % , and for the next 75 days they guarantee payment of social security contributions calculated by national minimum wage . 
  when economic growth reaches 2.5 % , payed parental leave will be changed to 30 days . 
  ** parental leave ** is meant for further care of the child immediately after expiry of maternal leave . 
  one parent , both parents or under certain conditions a 3rd person/grandparent has a right to this . 
  each of the parents has 130 days of parental leave . 
  a mother can transfer 100 days to a father but 30 days are untransferable . 
  a father can transfer all 130 days to a mother . 
  parental leave is paid 100 % but ca n't be higher than 2.5 times of an average national salary and ca n't be lower than 55 % of a minimal wage . 
  all in all , a mother gets 135 - 365 days of 100 % paid leave . 
  these are some basics if you have one healthy child . 
  that would be just silly . 
  i am very doubtful about austrian percentage . 
  it 's much lower in my experience . 
  but really , no one should be surprised germanic speaking countries have a higher percentage than the rest .
