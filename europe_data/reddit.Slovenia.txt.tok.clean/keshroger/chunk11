  3rd world countries have governance and money issues and are therefore unable to take care of their huge population especially when it 's constantly rapidly growing . 
  who knows . 
  it would probably show in 2016 . 
  but this graph is a huge bs as it shows our production as 0,0 . 
  weather and pesticides . 
  bee families are dying off throughout europe . 
  idk about romania in particular but i know ukrainian honey is mass-produced and hungarian honey is mixed with non-eu honey which is then sold and marketed as eu produced honey . 
  for a high quality honey water content has to be less than 18.6 % . 
  romania is a big country so it is possible that you produce that much high quality honey . 
  there 's really been lots of albanians/kosovars and new bosnians here lately . 
  we 've always had a lot of bosnians and serbs but it seems there 's more of them now . 
  at least in my area . 
  there 's even a lot of albanians/kosovars in smaller towns . 
  i know because my girlfriend is a teacher in a town of ~ 5000 and they have a lot of new kids . 
  some kindergartens even have a special requirement for new employees - knowledge of albanian . 
  they 're not really good immigrants here . 
  we have tons of problems with albanians . 
  recently they 've been attacking high school kids . 
  they even had to call police and hire security on one of the high schools in my city . 
  a group of 20 adults attacked a student with steel rods and baseball bats . 
  there still is . 
  it 's a world thing . 
  that 's why we want a world bee day for awareness on how important bees are . 
  too artificial for my taste . 
  [ zajamniki ] ( http://www.slotrips.si/sis-mapa/skupina_doc/slo/galerija/1358718533_8285_s_zajamniki_uskovnica05.jpg ) as well . 
  but neither of these are really villages . 
  they were used as summer cottages for cow shepherds . 
  they 're not in use anymore . 
  i 'm not sure about zajamniki , but you can rent those cottages on velika planina . 
  there was this one guy ( dead now ) who lived on velika planina permanently for 50 years . 
  [ bajtarji ] ( http://www.delo.si/druzba/panorama/med-bajtarji-nobene-elektronske-poste-samo-zabava-v-zivo.html ) are people who take care of the cottages in winter . 
  he was hit by a lightning 9 times . 
  edit : there 's also this [ open air museum in rogatec ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=rogatec+muzej+na+prostem&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewjkzpmromnrahwlk8akhdagblwq_auibigb ) and [ land of hayracks ] ( http://www.dezelakozolcev.si/si/ ) in \u0160entrupert . 
  sorry , it probably just means you mass-produce . 
  or slovenia . 
  feels like half of kosovo is here . 
  that gives you major points malta . 
  welcome to our honey-family !, 
  uh what ? 
  honey making is a huge huge huuuuuge tradition here . 
  we have songs about honey bees , carniolan honey bee is our bee , 4 out of 1000 people here keeps honeybees . 
  so i call this statistics bs . 
  edit : we 're even pushing for a world bee day ( birthday of pioneer of modern beekeeping anton jan\u0161a ) . 
  edit2 : we do n't have large scale industrial beekeeping though . 
  only high quality boutique production . 
  but definitely not 0,0 . 
  issue here is over griffon vulture , golden eagle , honey buzzard , barbastelle , hazel grouse and eurasian lynx . 
  to less extent brown bear and wolves . 
  the area they were supposed to build a wind farm on , [ volovja reber ] ( https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/volovja_reber ) is part of natura 2000 and has a great significance in european natural heritage . 
  it 's also one of the most important corridors of critically endangered vultures . 
  the thing is , they run into similar issues whenever and wherever they want to build something . 
  for example , they ca n't built a very needed road because of critically endangered butterfly species . 
  well you know , a study our environmentalists did shows that it causes great stress to bears , wolves , and lynx to the point that they leave the area and of course birds are blind and fly directly into the turbine . 
  because birds , bears , lynx and wolves are more important . 
  every winter . 
  there has n't been a winter without snow . 
  better than all our neighbors . 
  suck it . 
  should have seen an outrage by jewish and muslim communities here when our ombudsman for human rights said circumcision of boys without medical reasons is a violation of their rights . 
  they said she 's violating their freedom of religion . 
  which does n't say much about temperatures and climate . 
  dry cold is the best cold . 
  you just need tons hand cream , body cream and something for your hair not to be static . 
  wet cold is worse . 
  the worst cold is windy cold . 
  did you completely miss geography classes in school ? 
  is it completely normal to have temperatures up to 40 \u00b0 c ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  having a week of 30 \u00b0 c weather is not hot . 
  nothing weird around here . 
  it can go from -10 to +10 in a day here . 
  last november they measured -7 \u00b0 c in the morning and +21 during the day . 
  at the same place . 
  hahahaha that photo is too funny !, 
  [ he tried ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/wgyimoyyop/?taken-by=borutpahor ) . 
   the one in cairo though ... [ going to the annals that one . ], 
  ( https://www.facebook.com/onlyborutingisreal/ ), 
  his views would not go down well today though . 
  he 'd probably adopt 100 syrian orphans to live in his cottage and he 'd make flat bread for them everyday . 
  i guess some think a president should have a permanent frown on his face . 
  some people here just constantly need something to pick on . 
  it 's usually those that have nothing serious to complain about . 
  '' \u010cao milenca ! '', 
  he makes me laugh . 
  ok , fellow asd person !, 
  * shakes hand from afar without looking at you *, 
  kosor and pahor , best friends forever . 
  and it should move back to where it was . 
  yea , there was really no need for a short essay . 
  i was reffering to :  and i 'm quite sure all dutchies are closet austists anyway . 
  that is just a stupid and idiotic assumption and a ridiculous thing to say . 
  edit : you also could have mentioned autism is a spectrum therefore not everyone has the same ` symptoms ' and of same intensity . 
  knowing one person with asd means you know one person with asd , not everyone . 
  i think so too . 
  however , some people think he should act more official . 
  so have i and your comment is ridiculous . 
  i do n't think you actually know what autism really is . 
  president pahor and especially his [ instagram ] ( https://www.instagram.com/borutpahor/ ) posts are a bit controversial here in slovenia . 
  especially the `` homesickness in cairo . '', 
  post .
