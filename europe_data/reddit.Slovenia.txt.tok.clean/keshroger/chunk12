  what are your presidents up to ? 
  are people supportive of your president ? 
   crunch crunch footsteps only if it 's cold enough and the snow is dry . 
  otherwise it 's * splash splash *, 
  hello ? 
  once again , we exist !, 
  [ metaldays ] ( http://www.metaldays.net/ ) , [ so\u010da reggae festival ] ( http://www.soca-festivalley.com/sl/overjam-reggae-festival-2/ ) and [ punk rock holidays ] ( http://www.punkrockholiday.com/ ) . 
  idk how good they are , metaldays has a very good reputation , but they all share a nice setting . 
  that sounds like prekmur\u0161\u010dina with the \u00fc 's and long e 's . 
  why would you ask for good harvest at the end of the year . 
  or does it mean something else ? 
  prosinec is an old name for january in slovene . 
  edit : prositi = to ask . 
  because you ask for good harvest . 
  doubt it 's any different with any other country . 
  i 'm surprised about croatia though . 
  our education systems seem very similar . 
  we do , constantly . 
  every article . 
  former yugoslav republic of slovenia yada yada yada . 
  but it 's true , so ... 
  we 're 3rd best . 
  though our results are getting worse : / except for reading that really could n't get any worse than in past years . 
   or former yugoslav republic of slovenia idk , no one really gets mad about it here . 
  yea , salo means the same thing here . 
  i know ukrainians eat fat blobs of bacon fat on bread lol . 
  and this here is a prime example of why making fun of the us for being poorly educated is a hypocrisy . 
  maybe farming for youtube views ? 
  does it mean ` fat ' ? 
  really ? 
  what 's so shocking about spain ? 
  how many times do we have to see this ? 
  it 's not ** all around europe ** , it 's 12 countries out of ~ 50 . 
  it 's not even a quarter . 
  i really do n't . 
  not really , no . 
  i doubt any european would experience culture shock visiting any eu country . 
  but neither of those connect people culturally and emotionally . 
  nothing at all ? 
  he has his own ideas about linguistics and ethnicity . 
  you obviously have no experience with kids . 
  no , it does n't come from chinese . 
  they just started appearing one day and there 's lots of them . 
  i 'm not sure where it comes from but internet says it 's a version of tihomir which is weird because tihomir is a rare name here . 
  more probably it 's a male version of tijana/tiana , which is a slovene version of serbian/croatia tihana . 
  another similar name is tjan ( pronounced tyan ) which i guess is a short version of kristjan and sebastjan . 
  uh ... we do n't really think much about each other . 
  or not at all really . 
  we do n't have any relations . 
  you 're so daft it 's kind of sad . 
  are you daft or what ? 
  eastern europe is not a country . 
  it 's a region . 
  a huge region made out of several very different countries with plenty of different ethnicities , different levels of development , different levels of crime , different levels of emigration , etc. 
  i do n't know what part of my comment you do n't understand , but my guess would be you understood completely nothing . 
  since some danish youth is ravaging around prague , the whole western europe is a bunch of barbaric twats wreaking havoc around peaceful eastern europe . 
  right ? 
  ( i hope everyone else understands this is sarcasm ) . 
  over here they usually end on - vi\u0107 . 
  but that does n't matter , they 're our citizens . 
  usually they have a double citizenship , but whatever . 
  they 're still ours . 
  the point is , there definitely is no slovene ( and most probably other countries ) `` gangs '' stealing around germany or wherever he 's from . 
   obligatory eastern european answer : `` must be gipsys , then . '', 
  no , but you can name countries instead of branding us all thiefs . 
  stop using the term `` eastern europeans '' . 
  it 's too broad and we 're too different .

  you can teach a child `` limits '' without spanking them . 
  child needs to trust his parents not fear them he 's gon na get hurt if he does something wrong . 
  talking and explaining is enough . 
  edit : people forget you need to be a parent from the beginning not from the first time they do something stupid . 
  i very much doubt there was ever a slovene footballer on your team . 
  these maps just make me realize that we really should n't make fun of americans and their education . 
  most , if not all , of europe is not much better when in comes to knowing countries . 
  from what i can find on the internet there 's stil a few , yep . 
  older generations are returning but their offspring do n't speak it .
