  he 's saying that , in his opinion , unsuspected results for czech r. and slovakia are a consequence of badly translated questions and scales for these 2 countries . 
  which implies that surveys in other languages were correctly translated . 
  he ca n't say that without having checked all the surveys . 
   so i looked at the actual czech survey , and it became painfuly obvious . 
  they asked completely different question in czech than in other languages . 
  did you actually check all other languages ? 
  because ours was translated as ` prijetno ' ( pleasant ) as well . 
  i doubt this is the reason . 
  people ai n't that dumb to not know what the survey is asking . 
  it looks [ similar ] ( http://www.slovenskenovice.si/sites/slovenskenovice.si/files/styles/s_1280_1024/public/imported-images/media/picture/20110518/tornado2.jpg?itok=iqkufgqv ) to [ damage ] ( http://www.slovenskenovice.si/sites/slovenskenovice.si/files/styles/s_1280_1024/public/dti_import/2012/06/19/image_6000744_0.jpg?itok=ylkt_xnz ) done by a supposed tornado here a few years ago . 
  a galgo on spain - . - not funny . 
  but she 's clearly not in his way , so that ca n't be a reason . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're looking at but that woman was not in his way . 
  they could easily have met without touching each other . 
  he also had plenty of space on his left . 
   geographically , romania , bulgaria and hungary are more like central europe . 
  i agree political division of europe should be abolished and geographical division should be put in place , but geographically , that 's stretching it . 
  hungary is central but romania and bulgaria are south eastern . 
  what ? 
  have you seen the video ? 
  without mice poop , please . 
  i 'm really confused by our results . 
  specifically the 1st map . 
   and those who are from eastern europe by their nationality . 
  not even nationality , just eastern europeans . 
  usually . 
  uh afaik spain has one of the largest numbers of roma people . 
   the meat in the burger comes from cows . 
  are you sure ? 
  what exactly is uncivilized here ? 
  do you not have farm animals in the us ? 
  or do you keep them in barns all day ? 
  pasture animals have to get back to their barns somehow , you know ? 
  there are no cats except for lynx up where the farm is supposed to be ... 
  it 's a wild area . 
  and no domestic cat would try to catch eagles , buzzards , falcons , griffon vultures and other big birds . 
  just wear socks underneath in case it gets a bit chilly . 
  yea no , it 's the postmen who make babies here . 
  poor kids . 
  i used to be a scout . 
  one year we were camping by krka river . 
  half way through our camp it started raining heavily and then the river started flooding and we had to be evacuated in the middle of the night . 
  we had to climb up a slippery slope so senior scouts went ahead of us and installed ropes to grab onto at the steepest parts . 
  prepared salads are prepared and packed in the store , so not that : /, 
  over here it was pre-boiled eggs . 
  wtf even is that ? 
  i have never seen pre-boiled eggs . 
  why would someone buy that ? 
  where 's george clooney ? 
  are you george clooney ? 
  well at least it 's purple and orange , not the usual green and red ... 
  in the danube and the rhine will come to drink , the great camel , not repenting it . 
  gold !, 
  yep . 
  they also ca n't build a road through ljubljana marshes because of butterflies ... to be fair , volovja reber is an amazing and unique place with a lot of rare and endangered species of birds and other animals . 
  no other place in the country is even remotely appropriate for wind turbines . 
  i 'm not against it and would n't protest it if they decided to build a wind farm there , but i also appreciate the nature there . 
  italian culture is present mostly in the west , hungarian in the east . 
  it has definitely spread inside , mostly in the form of food ( polenta , gola\u017e ) and some loan words , but on a smaller scale . 
  on a bigger scale than bosnian/ottoman culture for sure . 
  some italian and hungarian ( austrian goes without saying , that 's why i 'm not mentioning it ) culture has been internalized while bosnian culture is a lot more recent and feels foreign . 
  turkish coffee drinking that was brought here by bosnians is almost , if not fully internalized already . 
  yep , it 's like that . 
  is this a serious question ? 
  we are geographically close to hungary yet only far eastern part of the country shares some hungarian culture . 
  we are geographically close to italy , but only the part that has been under italy shares some of their culture . 
  maybe start with the ottomans and austria-hungary . 
  1st of all , we do n't share a language , we share a language group and 2nd of all , linguistics does n't define culture 99 % . 
  you have to be pretty ignorant of history to suggest a country that has been under ottomans is culturally similar as a country that has been under austro-hungarian empire . 
  would you suggest bosnians have a very similar culture as czechs , slovaks or poles just because they all speak slavic ? 
  why are you bringing integration of migrants into this ? 
  the talk is about slovene and bosnian culture . 
  heritage is culture . 
  religion is culture . 
  music is culture . 
  tradition is culture . 
  all that is different in slovene and bosnian culture . 
  ** integration ** of migrants has to do with teaching them laws and social norms , not ** assimilating ** them into our culture . 
  your habits do not equal slovene culture . 
  you 're diminishing all the cultural aspects of all european cultures and making them all the same . 
  bosnian culture is not almost the same as slovene culture . 
  it 's like saying slovene culture is almost the same as norwegian culture because you do n't listen to slovene music and follow religion . 
  you make no sense . 
  culture is culture . 
  well you got a point there . 
  music ? 
  religion ? 
  traditions ? 
  ring a bell ? 
  i 'm not talking about uniqueness , i 'm talking about non-similarities with bosnian culture . 
  hahahaha only if postman is a bosniak . 
  yep , sorry . 
   they 're definitely closer culturally than afghanistanis ( if i give an extreme example ) i 'm saying that bosnians are closer to us culturally than afghans ( are to us ) . 
  did n't draw no parallels between afghans and bosnians . 
  it goes without saying that on a culture spectrum bosnia is much closer to slovenia than to afghanistan . 
  you do n't know many then , do you ? 
  probably . 
  familiarity with a culture does n't mean the same culture . 
  they 're definitely closer culturally than afghanistanis ( if i give an extreme example ) , but still not the same . 
  habit is not the only component of culture .
