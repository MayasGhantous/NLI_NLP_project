  it would be quite sad if they did n't . 
  especially the netherlands . 
  my mom was almost strangled by a drunk krampus when she was a kid . 
  she 's still afraid of them . 
  we also get [ bread treats ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=parkelj+kruh&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1242&amp;bih=580&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewixvskdpphpahwdosakhqzqd5wq_auibigb#imgrc=_ ) for st. nicholas in a shape of krampus . 
  sorry , i intended to reply to u/low _ discrepancy about his video of scary masked people . 
  there are slovene schools in austria . 
   scary masked people is that for st. nicholas or shrove tuesday/sunday ? 
  they look a bit like our [ kurents ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itxand7i_u ) . 
  kurent was a pagan god of hedonism . 
  it 's a slovene tradition on shrove sunday to scare winter away . 
  again , i have never heard of anyone being forced to attend sunday lunches . 
  i 'm definitely not an exception , it looks like you just attract weird people around you . 
  it 's so bad to know our families love us . 
  we suffer so much !, 
  it 's horrible to know that if anything goes wrong you 'll always have support . 
  horrible !, 
  perhaps that 's why asthma is on the rise . 
  our moms , grandmas and aunts are suffocating us with their love and food !, 
  send help !, 
  there 's a `` march of the parkelj ( krampus ) of three lands '' festival in kranjska gora if you 're interested . 
  we do have winters ... but we also have things to heat our houses . 
  you can move right out . 
  no one asked you to live here . 
  sunday lunches are not an obsession , we 're also not the only country that does them and i have never heard of anyone being forced to attend . 
  you seem to have some deep family issues , maybe you should take care of them before spilling your shit over other people 's family connections . 
  if you take a look at the map of suicide rates and this map , you 'll be surprised to notice there 's no connection whatsoever . 
  now go pack your bags and head south . 
  not really . 
  housing was really affordable here a few decades ago but people still built houses big enough for 2 families . 
  lots of people then bought or built a weekend house . 
  my parents did n't have good paying jobs but were able to buy an apartment in the city and build a new house on a plot my dad inherited . 
  people here used to build houses with an intention one of the kids will get the upper floor . 
  when my parents were building our weekend house , they build it big enough that when they retire they 'll live in the bottom floor and me or my brother will live in the upper floor . 
  and the other one will inherit our apartment . 
  it 's pretty normal to live in the same house as your parents here . 
  so are they having a concert in slovenia or croatia ? 
  denmark or sweden ? 
  we have lots of `` country '' last names . 
  horvat , hrovat ( croatian ) , lah ( italian ) , \u010ceh ( czech ) , rus ( russian ) , \u0160vab ( schwaben , germany ) , nemec ( german ) , turk ( turkish ) . 
  it 's origin can be that their ancestors were from one of those countries , they fought against that country , they made business with that country or similar . 
  well of course not . 
  i 'm sure everyone knows that . 
  same as everyone knows not every brit turned racist after brexit and same as everyone knows roma people does n't equal romanian . 
  it 's a stupid generalization . 
  it 's easier to generalize in a sentence than adding a disclaimer `` i know not everyone this and that ... '' . 
  i mean , tons of albanians here have ties with the mafia . 
  they arrested tons of albanian mafia members here just this week . 
  we call them `` sladoljedarji '' - ice creamers with a hint of an albanian accent . 
  bakeries , kebab shops and ice cream stands . 
  it seems like every street here has an albanian bakery , which is often just a money laundering disguise . 
  just this week police raided albanian mafia at the coast . 
  our coast is pretty much run by albanian mafia . 
  it 's also not justified british ( and other ) media keeps lumping eastern europe together . 
  `` eastern europeans '' steal fish from the pond . 
  `` eastern europeans '' living in a park in front of this and that building . 
  `` eastern europeans '' stealing our jobs . 
  please , theres 2000 slovenes in the uk , 3000 tops . 
  and i bet my finger most of them are highly educated . 
  but what can you do ? 
  just accept that you know you 're not one of those being criticized . 
  sorry , i have no sympathy for you . 
  it was n't politicians that decided for brexit , it was you , brits . 
  what happened to the spirit of europe ? 
  ask your fellow countrymen . 
  does n't it take quite a few years for them to mature ? 
  i think it was said on tv they need about the same amount of time as humans to mature and that they 're still very childish right now , playing with sand , how they do that i do n't know . 
  i think they would be considered fresh teens now , not adults . 
  it 's not made up . 
  it 's a dutch agency that awards this . 
  it 's not gon na happen france . 
  his last wish was to be buried there . 
  you were offered his heart and you refused it . 
  we mostly can fruit and cucumbers . 
  also beetroot , red bell peppers and mushrooms . 
  those are usual ones , anything else depends on a family and recipes they find on the internet . 
  my mom started pickling eggplants and zuccini this year . 
   ran\u010d u zelen\u00e9 sedmy that 's it !, 
  thanks !, 
  huh ? 
  no one consideres ajvar a slovene thing . 
  why would we claim it 's ours when it clearly is n't ? 
  i think most people consider it a serbian dish . 
  so i googled it . 
  \u017divilska industrija d.o.o ( no idea who they are ) protected ` ajvar ' , only the name , on german market . 
  so it was n't slovenia that registered it but the company that was producing it and selling it in germany . 
  and you were n't able to sell it under that name in germany only . 
  when i was a kid i used to watch this series about a czech family who lived in a city and they were rebuilding their weekend house or something like that ? 
  do you know what i 'm talking about ? 
  do you remember what it was called ? 
  well , you 're spot on for slovenia . 
  what about eros ramazzotti ? 
  phew , a lot . 
  wine is as deep in our culture as hiking . 
  even poem where they took our anthem from is actually a toast . 
  and the guy who wrote it was a very big fan of drinking wine lol . 
  some that i remember at the moment ( all of these are considered national songs ) : [ kol ` kor kapljic , tol ` ko let ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgnnk67uw_a ) . 
  rough translation : as many as there are ( wine ) drops , as much years god give us to live . 
  hey , o ' hey , o ' hey , to this world . 
  whether she 's old or whether she 's young , all of them like guys .
