  you do n't even get winters that cold . 
  we get colder winters and hotter summers and we manage fine . 
  properly insulated buildings + outside blinds work fine both in winters and summers . 
  please stop reading wikipedia articles about this . 
  this has been said multple times . 
  same sex marriage was only one of many laws in , what was called , ` family bill ' that was rejected . 
  one of the laws was also gay marriage adoption . 
  and there were several others that had nothing to do with lgbt . 
  parents with special need kids were against the law as well for some reason . 
  and others . 
  it was not a ` same sex marriage ' law !, 
  same sex marriage was accepted earlier this year bar domestic same sex adoption . 
  they can however adopt step children and they can adopt abroad . 
  you 're clearly from switzerland . 
  you 're an anomaly . 
  he 's from russia . 
  it would be silly to expect from someone that would possibly learn that many languages to be on a level to be able to read books like that . 
  if it happens in the ` west ' , they always have some excuse ready . 
  sorry but we turn into nasty bitches when we see tourists in flip flops , sorry , leather slippers , in the mountains . 
  we are serious about hiking and safety . 
  i 'm sure you can get all that wherever you 're from and plenty of other places . 
  you can come again when they start charging tourists for being shitheads . 
  until then , risk your life in flip flops somewhere else . 
  no , you did n't . 
  please never hike in our mountains again . 
  you are the kind of person slovenes have to pay for their rescues with tax money . 
  you 're one of the reasons everyone wants mountain rescue off of the list of free things . 
  do you really think high school students would read classics in min . 
  5 different languages ? 
  these are works from a 2017 matura exam . 
  some of the works change every year , some stay the same . 
  ' / ' indicates a professor decides which of those works his/her students will read/learn about . 
  not all of the works have to be read completely . 
  for some , students only have to read excerpts or summaries . 
  there are 5 - 7 books each year students have to read at home . 
  usually one is a book of choice and for the rest they get a list . 
  homer - iliad / virgil - aeneid sophocles - antigone / oedipus the king sappho - to a bride ( ? ), 
  / catullus - lesbia / horace - carpe diem bible - psalm 130 ( 129 ) de profundis / song of songs dante alighieri - divine comedy francesco petrarca - sonet ( 61 ) / michelangelo buonarroti - night william shakespeare - hamelt / romeo and juliet giovanni boccaccio - the decameron ( andreuccio da perugia , madonna filippa , federigo 's falcon ) miguel de cervantes - don quixote jean baptiste moli\u00e8re - tartuffe / the misanthrope george noel gordon byron - childe harold 's pilgrimage / alexander pushkin - eugene onegin alexander pushkin - the poet / mikhail lermontov - the sail / giacomo leopardi - to himself / heinrich heine - loreley fyodor dostoyevsky - crime and punishment / leo tolstoy - war and peace / nikolai gogol - dead souls stendhal - the red and the black / honore de balzac - father goriot / gustave flaubert - madame bovary nikolai gogol - the government inspector / henrik ibsen - ghosts / august strindberg - miss julie charles baudelaire - the albatross / get drunk / the stranger / correspondences marcel proust - combray / james joyce - ulysses / virginia woolf - mrs dalloway franz kafka - metamorphosis / thomas mann - death in venice wis\u0142awa szymborska - the joy of writing / sylvia plath - black rook in rainy weather / octavio paz - before the beginning / pablo neruda - the people poem / senghor - black woman / pr\u00e9vert - barbara eug\u00e8ne ionesco - the bald soprano / samuel beckett - waiting for godot / jean-paul sartre - no exit / tennessee williams - a streetcar named desire / julian barnes - talking it over, 
  i feel like you 're one of those people who goes hiking in tennis shoes or even flip flops . 
  that thing is in a village with an easy access . 
  it also appears that 's the name of it . 
  you can also name a mountain hut ` villa ' . 
  it wo n't make it a villa . 
  that 's some horrific music . 
  no wonder we wanted out . 
  there 's only a few and by the looks of it , they 're all , at least those i checked , in settlements with an easy road access . 
  what ? 
  i pay ~ 400 $ for my little car . 
  still a mountain hut . 
  any shelter in the mountains is a mountain hut/lodge/bivouac . 
  there are no hostels in the mountains . 
  no , i 'm talking about highways . 
  they still have some concrete slab ones . 
  you know , the ones that go ` tup tup tup tup tup tup ... ' when you drive on them . 
   at each lake was a nice hostel also called ` mountain huts ' . 
  you have obviously driven in a different part of austria than i have . 
  really ? 
  that 's the best you could find for triglav ? 
  it was 1,1 in 2014 and 0,4 in 2015 in slovenia . 
  that is a great invention !, 
  because they 're religious and believe religion has to move forward with time . 
  common sense . 
  it is marriage bar domestic adoption rights . 
  there are other countries where marriage is legal but adoption is not . 
  you know marriage exists outside of religion , do n't you ? 
  same reason as why other couples want to ? 
  what kind of question is that ? 
  marriage has nothing to do with religion . 
  that was a whole other act they were trying to accept . 
  it included gay marriage and adoption among a lot of other family laws . 
  gay couples can get married like any other since [ 24th february ] ( http://www.delo.si/novice/slovenija/danes-v-uporabo-zakon-o-partnerski-zvezi.html ) . 
  technically it 's not completely equal to marriage because they ca n't adopt domestically . 
  everything else is equal . 
  edit : the law in question was also rejected by families with special need kids as it also touched that topic . 
  edit2 : idk why you 're getting upvoted and me and u/rainfolder downvoted when that wikipedia article is clearly outdated , misleading and wrong . 
  some people really ca n't stand central europe doing progressive steps . 
  they can get married here , just like any other couple , they just ca n't adopt . 
  they can adopt their partners kids and they can adopt abroad . 
  adoption lines in slovenia are 5-10 years anyway . 
  i do n't understand the mentality of people who refuse to give them the right of adoption , but that 's how it is . 
  technically they 're not missing out on much but it 's still one right they do n't have . 
  i swear sweat was coming from every pore of my body when i was in japan . 
  35 \u00b0 c and 90 + % humidity . 
  everytime it 's about to rain and after it 's been raining :( it 's so stuffy . 
  it 's a claustrophobic feeling . 
  sunny mornings after a rainy night are especially tough . 
  best in the eastern and southern village yet again teehee, 
  our smallest had 2 students this school year . 
  not most of them , no . 
  62 of them are empty , 18 have one person living in it , 18 have 2 , 26 have 3 . 
  but they 're like [ this ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/place/6275+bre\u017eec+pri+podgorju/@45.5121765,13.9229292,1100m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x477b44d267a82339:0xe7c5982cbc722c2d!8m2!3d45.5115433!4d13.9296764 ) , [ this ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/place/1336+srobotnik+ob+kolpi/@45.5055813,14.7963256,2201m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x476492633e8353c9:0xbacc8bd145bb4474!8m2!3d45.5032552!4d14.7984423 ) or [ this ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/place/4229+torka/@46.231991,14.0808124,1086m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x477aeb0227cb483f:0xf0ae6b181adaf8a5!8m2!3d46.2309612!4d14.0807414 ) with like maybe 5 houses .

  nice try , we have 6036 . 
  reminds me of cicciolina lol edit : wait , who calles it cicciriola ? 
  ca n't decide which one is funniest . 
  maybe joaninha or mariquita hahaha, 
  primeval does n't mean old trees only ... it means none or very little involvement of humans for a very long period of time . 
  lol next level moronity . 
  a true facepalm .
