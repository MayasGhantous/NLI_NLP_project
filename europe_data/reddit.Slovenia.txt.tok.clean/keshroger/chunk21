  i 'm down with this . 
  this is what eu should be about . 
  those earthquakes were terrible . 
  oh , let me spray myself with chemicals so that i can hear constant buzzing around my ears without being simultaneously a big source of dinner for those buzzers . 
  yea i really do n't think that was a measure . 
  the title of the previous post was ` main ' items . 
  i 'm not sure what common is supposed to mean here regarding coat of arms . 
  still wrong regarding slovenia . 
   erm no , stars are not our main item . 
  there is no main item . 
  there 's stars , triglav and two lines representing sea , rivers and lakes . 
  none of them is more important than the other . 
  hey , i found it [ here ] ( https://www.limundo.com/kupovina/kolekcionarstvo/plakati/exyu-plakat-josip-broz-tito/53602339 ) . 
  it 's a serbian site , so maybe someone from serbia could help you contact the seller if he still has it . 
  why iceland though ? 
  it 's a complete opposite . 
  sounds like they 're running away from hot weather and you know , animals . 
  erm no , stars are not our main item . 
  there is no main item . 
  there 's stars , triglav and two lines representing sea , rivers and lakes . 
  none of them is more important than the other . 
  you were warned !, 
  for the sake of finnish tourism and your currently non existing agoraphobia , you do not . 
  ~ 20:55 here, 
  holly fuck i read that as pensioners , i was about to throw a hissy fit on you . 
  you have her [ address ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/@46.0522215,14.5020879,3a,90y,303.7h,94.79t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1skd3h5twqq4a2jxqqtr11vw!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo3.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3dkd3h5twqq4a2jxqqtr11vw%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d78.95505%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656 ) though . 
  looks like she 's moving out though , so hurry . 
  same for [ drivers permit ] ( http://images.24ur.com/media/images/600xx/jul2009/60312020.jpg?d41d ) . 
  i 've no idea if were dark purple or dark red . 
  we 're completely different colour than everyone else . 
  in the south as well ? 
  how do they do when it 's hot ? 
  2 of my neighbors have log houses and never heard them complain over heat . 
  i have seen those mosquito videos , so no . 
  and the shutters have to be outside the windows . 
  inside blinds do n't help as the sun heats up the windows and they act as a heat source . 
  is there any country that does n't use bricks in europe ? 
  our houses must retain warmth in the winter as well . 
  with proper insulation , which you need in winter anyway , they also prevent some heat from coming in . 
  add shutters on windows and you 're good . 
  you ca n't expect inside temperatures to be much lower than 25 \u00b0 c but when it 's 30 + outside , it should n't be colder than that anyway . 
  opening windows when it 's hotter outside , will only bring warm air in . 
  draft does n't cool down the air . 
  there are countries that get both , cold winders and hot summers . 
  there 's a lot of countries between north and south . 
  insulation works both for cold and heat . 
  your average humidity in summer is between 70 % and 80 % , or not even that . 
  not 100 % . 
  25 \u00b0 c and 80 % humidity is nowhere near sauna . 
  turkish bath has humidity close to 100 % and temperatures close to 40 \u00b0 c. 
  if this site is to be believed , your humidity is lower that ours these days . 
  [ amsterdam ] ( https://www.wunderground.com/nl/amsterdam?mr=1 ) vs. [ ljubljana ] ( https://www.wunderground.com/q/zmw:00000.1.14015 ) vs. [ dubrovnik ] ( https://www.wunderground.com/q/zmw:00000.196.14472 ) . 
  ca n't speak about dubrovnik , but we get tons of thunderstorms here and it brings humidity to levels you can hardly breath . 
  naah we have them too . 
  you know you can install them , right ? 
  i only have inside blinds on my windows atm and it feels like an aquarium inside . 
  i ordered [ this kind ] ( http://www.medle.si/tl_files/proizvodi/ideal.jpg ) a couple of weeks ago so they should be coming to install them soon . 
  do you never cycle with school ? 
  my elementary school even had a cycling path on the outskirts of the city , aprox . 
  18km long . 
  my cousin failed his road and traffic regulations exam this year and was not allowed to go on a school cycling trip today . 
  you make no sense at all . 
  how is japan , with 337 people per sqkm more crowded than aruba ( 554 ) , saint-martin ( 663 ) and puerto rico ( 449 ) ? 
  clearly it lists all the countries by people per sqkm . 
  from most ` crowded ' to least ` crowded ' . 
  cities = / = country . 
  this data is population per sqkm for countries , not cities . 
  this website does n't even know how to use a calculator . 
  ours is 101,9 . 
  not 108 . 
  the size is off by 17sqkm as well . 
  probably how much croatia wants to steal . 
  on the other hand , croatia wrote into their constitution marriage is only possible between men and women ( or something in those lines ) and look at their percentage . 
  this map has been declared bs numerous times . 
  lol what ? 
  this ca n't be . 
  ours forces postmen to sell vacuum cleaners , grave candles , windshield washer fluid and other shit to old people . 
  there 's been protests and apparently , majority of postmen are about to quit . 
  if this is true , how bad is it elsewhere ? 
  i never had any trouble with post delivery though . 
   do you guys have kompot with noodles for christmas eve ? 
  what the ... ? 
  you 're the 1st one i have heard making it as a drink . 
  i did n't even know you can make it as a beverage . 
  unless you then make it into \u010de\u017eana . 
  but i do n't think that 's what others are describing here . 
  same here . 
  it 's a dessert , not a beverage . 
  oh [ i did ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/@46.4321628,13.6385843,3a,75y,36.21h,91.23t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-7o8vublcmka%2fwt2vcjypgni%2faaaaaaadcee%2ffsks23evazqowadxzupzuuwngfrccwxcgclib!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh6.googleusercontent.com%2f-7o8vublcmka%2fwt2vcjypgni%2faaaaaaadcee%2ffsks23evazqowadxzupzuuwngfrccwxcgclib%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi0-ya328.21124-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i8704!8i4352 ) .

  and a [ tree house ] ( http://citymagazine.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hisa-640x420-660x433.jpg ) . 
  i ca n't even imagine . 
  you ca n't go anywhere here without seeing a forest . 
  polystyrene ( eps , eps-f ) can be used and is still used on buildings lower than 22m . 
  it 's a flammable material so a proper coating ( facade ) has to be done . 
  that makes it pretty much as safe as mineral wool . 
  anything higher and they have to use non-flammable material , usually 15-20cm mineral wool . 
  are you ok ? 
  you have to forgive the dutch . 
  every little hill is an attraction to them .
