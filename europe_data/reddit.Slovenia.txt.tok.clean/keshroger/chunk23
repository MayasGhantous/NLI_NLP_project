  when i was in japan , every mosquito bite left a mark for months . 
  for real , i was polka dotted for a few months after coming home . 
  and i 'm not sensitive to mosquito bites , to make it clear . 
  if this video ever becomes viral , say goodbye to tourism in finland . 
  aparently one of their backpacks looked like it had wires sticking out lol . 
  no article in slovene has any more details . 
  well i think they did a lousy job . 
  are there even any people left in kosovo ? 
  i feel like all of them are here . 
  i always forget his dad was a gymnast because miro jr looks like such a gimp . 
  are you an architect of those things or why are you so offended ? 
  they do look much better from the ground though . 
  but too much roads . 
   what an unimaginative , lacking trees city !, 
  milan can you post one from space ? 
  where did all the imagination have gone !, 
  and the trees !, 
  not the trees !, 
  paris those at least have some character . 
  that one in warsaw has none . 
   it 's a new neighborhood , largely still under construction . 
  there was nothing there 15 years ago . 
  trees take time to grow . 
  in 30 years it 's gon na be as horrible looking as some commie neighbourhoods are now . 
  it seems like only here , in croatia and possibly serbia commie blocks did n't turn to ghettos at all . 
  all sorts of people live in them here . 
  poor , rich , unemployed , students , lawyers , you name it . 
  i 'm not sure exactly what you 're trying to show me . 
  empty spaces ? 
  they can be built up . 
  that neighborhood lacks imagination . 
  and trees . 
  those are terrifying . 
  what about something in-between ? 
  i do n't like that design at all . 
  it looks so impersonal . 
  it 's just too big . 
  a real successor of commie blocks . 
  jesus christ , why get to offended over a comment ? 
  where 's the parking ? 
  looks a lot different from new neighbourhoods here . 
  a friend of mine lived in england for 4 month in a ` city ' of aprox . 
  population 50k . 
  i guess it would be considered a small town there . 
  he had to take a car to get to the nearest shop . 
  his neighbourhood was just houses , nothing else . 
  the town center was one street . 
  there was absolutely nothing going on . 
  we both used to live in a city of comparable size and there was more stuff going on in our neighbourhood alone . 
  i personally would love to live in the barbican in london . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=stara+razglednica+ljubljana&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiz4pczm7huahui7hokhv0qcgmq_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638#tbm=isch&amp;q=razglednica+velenje&amp;imgrc=_ ) and one from [ jesenice ] ( http://www.razglednice.eu/contents/media/l_jesenice-721.jpg ), 
  over here when this stuff was built , companies bought a certain amount of apartments that they rented to their workers or just random people . 
  then in the 90 's there was a jazbin\u0161ek law that allowed people to buy apartments they lived in under really good conditions . 
  only a few of apartments in each building were not bought and are used as ` non-profit ' ( council ) apartments . 
  that 's not a case at all here . 
  each building has internal and outside management , a cleaning lady and a janitor . 
  none turned into slums . 
  you can find people of all classes living in them . 
  unemployed on benefits to lawyers and up . 
  i do n't even think it 's possible to have high speed trains here . 
  even trains on the grey line ca n't come anywhere close to 200km/h . 
  even if all the tracks were new and updated i do n't think terrain configuration and train stops so close to each other would allow high speed trains . 
  ( i 'm speaking out of my ass coz ' i know nothing about trains ), 
   http://nep.vitra.si/images/jpg/p-751-3.jpg hey !, 
  those are in ljubljana and the green one was [ voted ] ( http://www.planet.si/novice/slovenija/video-najlepsa-najboljsa-najbolj-urejena-najbolj-varcna-...-to-je-naj-blok-v-ljubljani.html ) as the best old apartment bloc in ljubljana . 
  that photo is made to look bad . 
  i 'm not sure , but the brown one has probably been renovated by now as well . 
  they are the highest apartment blocks in slovenia . 
  edit : the video says , they invested 800.000 $ into renovation of that building in the last 25 years , lol . 
  that 's ~ 206 $ per apartment ( 255 ) per year .

  it 's not even allowed . 
  all the renovated building colours must be approved by the municipality . 
  they try to stick with original colours or at least similar . 
   there were not so many minorities living in them we built cities back then just to house immigrant workers . 
  we also have bosnians . 
  built that wall !, 
  putting it that way , i think i may agree . 
  so estonia and latvia have no motorways ? 
  why ? 
  also , time to build a wall . 
  i have no problem disabled people getting higher benefits . 
  after all , they ca n't work ( some ) and need extra care ( some ) . 
  but paying for their sexual pleasure ? 
  nope . 
  since when is sex a right ? 
  do taxpayers have to pay for this or what ? 
  ( sorry , i did n't bother to read the article ) . 
  i would n't be down with that . 
  sounds to me like we should all adopt norwegian system and get it over with asap . 
  france seems to keep digging their own hole . 
  well , we 're helping you . 
  it most probably is quite a bit longer . 
  altitude difference is 70m . 
  that 's not the same as length , obviously . 
  there 's a schwa in front of an ` r ' . 
  we do n't write it or mark it otherwise . 
  you really would n't be able to say it without it . 
  though a czech once told me that there 's no schwa , but we were taught in schools that there is . 
  whether it 's called a schwa or something else , the fact is that there is something like it to help you say it .
