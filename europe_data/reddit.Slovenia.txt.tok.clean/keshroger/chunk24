  i guess some people call it ` rolling an * r * ' or something . 
  i 'll never buy it for that price . 
  buying a second hand car does not decrease safety of a car ... at this point i would choose pretty much any car of decent age over a sandero . 
  i have never driven a car that felt as bad as that . 
  our longest word without vowels is * vzbrst * . 
  there 's also * smrklja * but that one has * a * at the end . 
  ` pedal a pony ' . 
  another moto is ` po\u017een hudi\u010da na vr\u0161i\u010da ' , which means ` run a devil on vr\u0161i\u010d ' . 
  ~ ~ gonyi ~ ~ goni pony 2017 was a 3rd anual bike race from kranjska gora ~ ~ over ~ ~ on top of vr\u0161i\u010d pass on a [ pony bike ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dg83h2tvtsq/uf61k-iocyi/aaaaaaaaank/yu8hmw6j7ni/s1600/wp_000172.jpg ) . 
  this year it was attended by 922 people . 
  length : 13,5 km elevation gain : 801m slope : up to 10,8 % 24 paved serpentines winner time : 44:30, 
  i rather get a 2nd hand car than a sandero . 
  i just do n't like it . 
  the cheap materials also make it smell weird . 
  it does n't feel good on a highway at all . 
  i feel like its optimal speed is no more than 90km/h . 
  beautiful shot , swede !, 
  that 's a fine hill !, 
  a mighty fine hill !, 
  a real picture of sweden !, 
   je izredno sposoben in inteligenten \u010dlovek ...  he 's a very capable and inteligent human ... 
  apparently not ? 
  i drove a sandero stepway once . 
  it just felt so cheap . 
  like it 's gon na crumble if it hits something . 
  it felt like if i pull that thingy to open the door too much , it 's gon na break . 
  everything it 's just cheap plastic . 
  i guess it 's good for people who do n't drive much , but i would n't get one if i had kids . 
  do n't know how the duster is though . 
  fine !, 
  i congratulate him for trying . 
  good job , swede . 
  nice hill . 
  i know , it 's sweden , that 's why a simple photo of nothing special will get hundreds of upvotes . 
  bint ... that 's a new one lol . 
  i do n't get it . 
  it 's some houses on a tiny hill and a tractor . 
  naah , you 're not the only one . 
  i had a huge grimace on my face while watching it . 
  wtf would go up to someone being followed by cameras and forcefully pose with him ? 
  i 'm glad we 're not part of this . 
  i do n't want to know what the results would be like . 
  eurostat one is correct 2017s1 = 804,96 . 
  i checked the weather report . 
  it is warmer . 
  i sometimes get the spinach one when i 'm desperate . 
  it 's pretty ok , just so watery . 
  ours is 804,96 $ brutto , that 's 614 netto . 
  if they ca n't even check that correctly ... 
  you 're just stretching it now ... 
  they get what they deserve . 
  yes , they do ... taxes go into benefit funds . 
  because their parents work here and pay taxes here , that 's why !, 
  but be my guest and go do construction work in 30 \u00b0 c weather instead of them for the shitty wage they get . 
  then we wo n't need them and we wo n't have to ` invest ' in their kids anymore . 
  pretty sure it 's the same elsewhere in europe . 
  we have a storm every evening . 
  we are having a hailstorm right now . 
  the point is , 8 \u00b0 c was measured at 10am which makes me think it was around 15-20 \u00b0 c during the day . 
  can hardly believe belgium is 28 \u00b0 c at 10am these days ... 
  are they any less than our kids or what ? 
  that 's a shit thing to say ... 
  why lowkey . 
  i would n't trade this place for anything . 
  especially when i was a kid . 
  it 's a perfect place to grow up in . 
  i do n't get it ... 
  on the contrary , i know a few grubers in slovenia . 
  budapest has 1,8 million people . 
  it does take a lot of imagination to think a country of 2 million would have a capital of that size . 
  that one too but at least that one 's a tiny bit funny and was once dressed in a slovenian national dress . 
  so it surpasses the mermaid . 
  the only balkan thing in slovenia are serbs , albanians and bosnians with their culture . 
  i think portion sizes may be a culprit . 
  our portions are very big . 
  the most underwhelming landmark ever . 
  why could n't you ? 
  sorry , but there 's no such thing as austria . 
  i should know who we border with . 
  it 's australia . 
  we get way too many rabid runaway kangaroos . 
  we are seriously considering building a trench to keep those pesky snakes and spiders away . 
  but we do welcome migrating koalas . 
  so how do i become a luxembourgian ? 
  or rather luxusurian . 
  i do n't think they need any more attention . 
  damned if they do , damned if they do n't . 
  that 's what i think . 
  people will complain whatever they do . 
  pekino haha that 's so cute . 
  is n't it 29 in lj ? 
  it was 30 in celje but we 're about to have a storm now . 
  yes please !, 
  surprise surprise ... 
  holly ! '' # $ % & / ( ) = ? * !!!!, 
  do roaches only live in super hot climates ? 
  is this what we have to fear with all this climate changes ? 
  the only time i have seen one was in tozeur , tunisia . 
  that 's weird , i 'm in slovene styria and it was 26 today . 
  sweden is huge , it 's not crazy at all .
