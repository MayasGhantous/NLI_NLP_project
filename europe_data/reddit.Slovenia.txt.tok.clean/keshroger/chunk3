  if insulting is not rudness to you , than i do n't know what it is . 
  oh the glorious ljubljana fog < 3, 
  the only italian thing about ljubljana are italian tourists and food . 
  which can be said about any country in europe . 
  trieste is serbian , bosnian and chinese . 
  so yes . 
  i 'm out . 
  whoop !, 
  now you 're just starting to get rude which indicates you 're losing an argument , so i 'm done here . 
  wow , i 'm surprised slovene is not filled with melania . 
  a relief really . 
   nobody but you claims that estonians are not an ethnic group and that finnic people are a separate ethnic group . 
  i have never even seen or heard anyone discus estonian/finnic group so i 'd really like to know how you came to that conclusion . 
   no , but there is the common division , whereby estonians are always listed separately . 
  i already asked you for proof and you did n't deliver . 
   could be , these things work differently among different groups that 's exactly what i 'm telling you ? 
   by convention slovenes are always listed separately as an ethnic group and slavs are never listed as such . 
  what convention ? 
   of course nationality = citizenship . 
  no , nationality = / = citizenship . 
  you might have to google things up . 
   people of the same ethnic group can be of different nationality . 
  obviously . 
   even people of the same ethnic group living in the same country can be of different nationality if they have different citizenships . 
  obviously . 
   even more , there can be people without any nationality if they do n't have any citizenship . 
  very uncommon . 
  but yes . 
  poland looks like a bad rash . 
  all the albanians are here . 
  or so it feels . 
  and looks . 
  as i said , whether ethnicity divides into sub-ethnicities or nationalities depends on who you ask . 
  there 's no official division after `` ethnicity '' . 
  no one here considers themselves an ethnic slovene . 
  not that i know of at least . 
  i have never heard anyone say that . 
  we 're slavs by ethnicity and slovene by nationality . 
  no , really , nationality depends on the laws of a country . 
  it 's a legal status . 
  nationality is not the same as citizenship . 
  that 's a good point . 
  however , anglicanism is a branch of protestantism which is a denomination of christianity . 
  another point would be christianization of europe in middle ages . 
  well ... finnic is an ethnic group . 
  whether a subgroup of an ethnic group is also an ethnicity remains unknown and open to debate . 
  it really depends on who you ask . 
  if estonians consider themselves to be an ethnic sub-group , then so be it , i rest my case . 
  i really do n't know why i started this debate . 
  yes , russians belong to slavic ethnic group , that 's perfectly clear . 
  whether russians who were born in estonia are also considered estonian nationals or just citizens , depends on estonian law . 
  yep . 
  to ban it because some people believe that burqa and niqab are always forced on women is ridiculous . 
  however , a debate on whether it should be banned due to a security risk is just . 
  a debate whether it should be banned because it does n't fit into our culture , i 'm still not decided on that . 
  i 'm saying that estonians are of finnic ethnicity , not estonian ethnicity . 
  estonian is a nationality , finnic is an ethnicity . 
  i think the media just adopted the word ` burqa ' as a something covering the face . 
  the actual law probably would n't * specifically mention burqa or niqab or even a mask but something that covers the face . 
  i do n't think those who decide to wear a burqa wear it because they would be less comfortable with only wearing hijab . 
  they wear it because it 's part of their culture . 
  i also believe that some women do decide by themselves to wear it . 
  it would be silly to believe all of them are forced . 
  idk . 
  i do believe some women do willingly decide to cover their face . 
  but imo , that 's a tiny minority and they probably have quite some radical beliefs , aka . 
  salafi/wahhabi ( i 'm not sure about the difference between those two ) . 
  yea and the 1st sentence already states what i 'm saying . 
   estonians ( estonian : eestlased ) are a finnic ethnic group . 
  we chose [ this ] ( http://www.drustvo-ozara.si/ljudsko-izrocilo/ljudske-nose/70-slovenska-narodna-noa ) as our slovene national dress in 2nd half of 19th century . 
  it 's modeled by a version of upper carniolan alpine type that is worn aroun bled .

  yep , a lot of people were saying they were awaken by an earthquake around 3:30 am . 
  also in other areas . 
  must have been hell for people in those villages . 
  best wishes to italy . 
   lol . 
  instead of laughing you could just send me link to where i can read about `` estonian ethnicity '' . 
  the earthquake was so strong it was even felt in ljubljana . 
  quite a few people were awaken by it .
