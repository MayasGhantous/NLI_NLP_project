  i do n't think this things will be forgotten here anytime soon . 
  a similar thingy is called [ laufarji ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=laufarji&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjehrsfpa7sahvmcpokhdnjaeoq_auibigb#imgrc=_ ) ( runners ) here . 
  they 're traditional in cerkno region . 
  there 's 25 of them and they wear costumes made out of different materials . 
  they all have different names .

  edit : link, 
   til there is a town called gorizia right next bo nova gorica . 
  what the heck ? 
  you can not be serious . 
  yep . 
  it 's cobblestone now . 
  not exactly the same ( if wikipedia is to be belived ) . 
  kukeri :  ... traditional rituals intended to scare away evil spirits . 
  kurenti scare away winter and bring spring . 
  except that that referendum was n't about gay marriage but a lot of other things as well ... 
  gay marriage was just a small part of it . 
  they can adopt abroad , just not as a couple in slovenia . 
  there 's not much kids to adopt anyway and waiting line to adopt is close to a decade . 
  no , we had civil union/registered partnership before this . 
  this marriage thing now is completely equal to the heterosexual marriage minus adoption as a couple in slovenia right . 
  they can adopt abroad , just not in slovenia . 
  not that there 's any kids to adopt in slovenia . 
  adoption waiting line is years . 
  is that a joke ? 
  edit : why am i getting downvoted ? 
  did anyone look at the pic ?? 
  that law had other things included , not just marriage . 
  people were mostly against adoption . 
  even the opposing parties said they would n't have a problem if it was just about marriage . 
  how much truth there is those words , i do n't know . 
  the vote turn out was also low . 
  we had the same thing before this . 
  registered partnership and marriage are pretty much the same . 
  this law does n't change much in terms or gay rights . 
  it just ... adds a different word to it . 
  i do n't have to do research . 
  i think i know my language and that we have nothing in common with albanian . 
  i 'm pretty sure this tradition is spread over half of europe . 
  if we leave that albanian thing alone , there are also mistakes in circle sizes . 
  there is no way more than 3.1 million people speak slovene and slovak less than 3 million . 
  it does n't make sense at all . 
  in that case there should have been a line between slovenian and german and italian , even hungarian not albanian . 
  i do n't think we have a single word in common other than common loan words from other languages . 
  how are we geographically close ? 
  there 's around 1000km between us . 
  and if this was about loan words , we 'd be much closer to german and italian . 
  our grammar did pick a lot from german , yet there 's no line between us . 
  thanks for an idea !, 
  i watched a documentary on this . 
  i bought a polish and german one to compare some time ago . 
  i remember that the german one tasted much more of nuts than the polish one . 
  there was also a difference in colour and texture . 
  german one was creamier . 
  not speaking for nutella , as i do n't think they label their products for specific regions and you can get polish , french and german nutella here . 
  but other companies sell by regions . 
  we belong to croatia/serbia/bosnia / albania region and supermarket chains ca n't just go and say ` now we want to be in the austria/german region ' . 
  kotanyi for example admitted they use different ingredients for ee market groups claiming different taste . 
  i guess ee ` have a taste for byproducts/fillers ' , whatever that 's called , because tests showed pepper products made for ee contained less actual pepper than those made for we . 
  it 's funny how taste suddenly changes on the borders of ee , huh ? 
  does she know where to report such cases ? 
  preferably anonymously . 
  might want to look into stolen children stories . 
  no it 's not , if you know a bit of history . 
  much of the area which is austria today was inhabited by slavs ( todays slovenes ) before germans came . 
  am i pointing a gun on you or what ? 
  i honestly do n't know anyone like that . 
  most of my friends with kids are n't married but they 're all registered as a union . 
  edit : oh wait , my cousin . 
  they were already busted once in school their kids go to . 
  i wish there was an easy way to report this things . 
  do n't you have civil partnerships ? 
  over here civil partnership is equal to marriage . 
  yes . 
   so\u010da -- vipava -- krka -- sava -- danube i have never heard of that one . 
  it does n't make any sense . 
  so\u010da and then sava & krka . 
  wtf ? 
  oh someone 's butthurt . 
  his maps have been debunked multiple times . 
  the only ones i know that were made in slovenia were [ bojan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmojlsbvtzm ) , [ the winter story ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sectpt9petq ) , [ the messanger ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt9o7xhno4y ) , [ the arrow ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2rpbe4iqlc ) and some puppet shows . 
  i do n't think any of them were popular outside , though they all have us titles . 
  most of the cartoons we watched were foreign . 
  czech cartoons were very popular . 
  look at the glorious carantania . 
  that 's true with a lot of his maps . 
  the most recent one i remember that was posted here was % of people living abroad . 
  he pulls them out of , idk where , his ass ? 
  i never watched cartoons on german tv channels because we had plenty of good ones on ours . 
  but i know those who had some italian tv channels watched anime on them . 
  what country ? 
  there 's definitely no difference between what i buy here and what i buy in austria . 
  it 's the same stuff . 
  stains on new clothes ? 
  the heck ? 
  our kids program in the 90 's was actually great . 
  better than nowadays imo . 
  huh ? 
  we still have orf . 
  orf eins and orf 2 .
