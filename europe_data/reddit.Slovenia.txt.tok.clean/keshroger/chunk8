  that 's a myth . 
  never seen any proof . 
  she changed her name because it 's easier to pronounce . 
  many slovenes ( among others ) who went to the us after ww1 americanized their last names . 
  what ban are you talking about ? 
  there was no ban on religion in yugoslavia . 
  religion just simply was n't celebrated on a national scale . 
  everyone could celebrate whatever the heck kind of religion they wanted at home . 
  i sometimes feel this guy pulls statistic out of his hind hole . 
  there 's around 50000 slovenes living in eu . 
  where 's did 90000 of them disappear ? 
  hard to believe there 's 90000 slovenes living outside of eu . 
  that 's not a reason to downvote . 
  wtf . 
  get a grip downvoters . 
  i do n't think the number for slovenia is right . 
  there 's currently around 50000 slovenes living in other eu countries . 
  half of them in germany and a lot of them are old . 
  so where 's the other 90000 ? 
  i doubt more slovenes live outside of eu than in eu . 
  so nova gorica has 89 while gorica has 12 . 
  how is that even possible ? 
  they 're basically one city . 
  and is there even any industry in nova gorica ? 
  these ones are popular here . 
  never heard of that before . 
  hahahahahaha, 
  my greek friend said ya 'll hate albanians . 
  if you 're looking for something that most people connect with , then [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7gfnagyes8 ) is the obvious choice . 
  edit : it may be better if you ask in r/askeurope . 
  it 's getting lost in all the castles and fortresses here . 
  [ ne ourji , ne sejaj ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uozd1dss6lm ) is my favourite . 
  this is a traditional old one without known author . 
  or are you looking for newer ones ? 
  i was just kidding :p i do n't even know how many we have . 
  even slovenia ? 
  we have tons of castles , how many do you have ? 
  not on a map of ** average wages ** . 
  good for your that you ever had one . 
  i knew they were a farce when they started yapping about roma . 
  on a ** map of average wages ** cost of living does n't matter . 
  go search for a map of standard of living if you want that . 
  it 's just a map of average wages , it 's not claiming to be a map of standard of living . 
  who eats that crap ? 
  the only frozen pizza i have found that tastes barable is interspar 's american style i think four cheese pizza . 
  i do n't think that has much to do with how rich a country is but more about awareness . 
  people and tv here are constantly yapping about not throwing food away . 
  most people living outside of the cities and even in the cities throw food on the compost instead of organic waste bins . 
  goldinar also comes to my mind . 
  why exactly would that be surprising ? 
  it 's been like this for decades . 
  that 's a ` j' they say , not \u00fc . 
  it looks a lot like lipica . 
  f is ` effing ' o which is leaning on a bed ( r ) . 
  can you see it ? 
  i 'm going crazy . 
  yep . 
  i was there at night and it was completely dead . 
   more complex history than just `` muh land muh horse '' . 
  you can claim everything slovenian then . 
  and czech and croatian etc. 
  at least everything that was built and made under your occupation . 
  even people . 
  that 's not how it goes . 
  was that filmed in lipica ? 
  i have never seen that . 
  looks old . 
  naah , he 's the kind of gay that would hang out in the camp to meet new people . 
  he 's also loud . 
  i do n't care unless they insist there 's a thing called balkan culture . 
  like wtf is that ? 
  nope . 
  j is well pronounced , not like l\u00dc . 
  it 's lyu-blya-na . 
  fun fact : belgian parents named their daughter ljubljana a few years ago . 
   drunk lady ; just to yell at us about how she hates corrupt eu establishment . 
  that is the most slovenian thing ever . 
  is n't their teran made from another sort of grape ? 
  let 's just say everywhere . 
  they also [ steal ] ( http://www.delo.si/novice/okolje/tujci-kradejo-nase-jamske-hrosce-zasluzek-je-velik.html ) cave creatures . 
  they still do . 
  some wierdo hick people also make fire salamander brandy . 
  very good boy !, 
  good . 
  why is it surprising though ? 
  interspar is open until 3pm . 
  da is used on offical forms . 
  you know , when you have to check yes or no as an answer . 
  holy , we have a whole city as a [ capitol ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=capitol&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=ocv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiw657syn7rahxlimakhyx3d6aq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=658 ) ? 
  is that a thing ? 
  i 've been to koper for the first time last year in december and i liked it very much . 
  i did not expect it to be so nice . 
  popo 's palms are doing very well !, 
  [ burek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b\u00f6rek#bosnian_burek ) and [ \u0107evapi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0106evapi ) . 
  delicous !, 
  that 's [ branko \u0110uri\u0107 \u0110uro ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0229301/ ) father of that zala \u0110uri\u010d girl . 
  he 's bosnian married to a slovene . 
  well known actor , comedian , musician and director . 
  very well known here . 
  he played in [ no man 's land ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283509/?ref_=nm_knf_i1 ) , if you 're familiar with it and in angelina jolie 's [ in the land of blood and honey ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1714209/?ref_=nm_knf_i3 ) .
