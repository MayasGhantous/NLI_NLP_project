  perfecf timing , 
  ca n't talk for 2002 , but you were pretty wank in 2014 . 
  you drew them in 2014 , btw . 
   you 'll see , 2018 will be our year !, 
  looks like you 're evolving into liverpool :d, 
  at least not to the us . 
  their national team might actually win a trophy then :d . 
  still pretty good for an average wanker ^ ^ srry, 
  ah ok . makes more sense now . 
  is this a standard term ? 
  what do you mean here with `` active population '' . 
  curious . 
  are n't those just claims recognized by a few countries ? 
  classic bill , always positioning himself between women . 
  not sure how i feel about that, 
  gulas was delicious in prague , can confirm, 
  i 'd also give them some liquor to help with the studies . 
  what the fuck, 
  i 'll add 1 euro , if it helps , 
  wow , that was great . 
  must be proud , to have such a strong , no bullshit president, 
  austrian empire then ? 
  if you have a slovenian passport , you are eligable for the interrail ticket . 
  not sure if it 's any different , but it 's for eu citizens only . 
  beer . 
  edit : sure , not czech , but i 've been there a few times . 
  beer . 
  well , it 's far from being this extreme , but i agree it 's still something you wo n't bring up , when you meet new people . 
  but being beaten , because of it ? 
  and of course it 's still regarded as only kids shows . 
  probably because the shows that are dubbed , and run in the kids program , are all meant for kids anyway . 
  as a student , i use a fuck ton out of the vending machines , so that 's a no no for me . 
  ah , i only put this into the context of the title . 
  stickful sounds hilarious to me, 
  so you do :d, 
  eastern european ? 
  i beg your pardon ? 
  i ca n't take austrians seriously , because their german dialect gives me a feeling that everyone is a simpleminded farmer . 
  their german sounds retarded , so you beat them their , i guess . 
  oh , i know that . 
  it was meant as a joke , because of that stereotype ... 
  probably takes longer to board the plane and fly , than drive by car . 
  edit : as for foreign flights . 
  london is most popular , i think , and flights to major airports , from where people fly to their actual destination . 
  but it 's still pretty rare to travel by plane , i think . 
  inb4 italian or french . 
  followed by : british food sucks, 
  / u/beardlessyeti ye , who would do that , 
  [ am on phone , so ca n't share my own , but this one is pretty nice  ] ( http://www.sencur.si/assets/templates/inspira/images/sencur/banner-home-00.jpg ), 
   gymnasium ( no real translation ... ) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/gymnasium_ ( school ) no need to translate even :d, 
  i 'd like to add [ leon \u0160tukelj ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leon_%c5%a0tukelj ) . 
  born in 1898 he was the first gold medalist for yugoslavia ( which slovenia was part off ) in 1924 . 
  [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/ycff7cc6trk?t=4m53s ) he is at the atalant olympics ( 1996 ) opening ceremony , still walking around , like he was 70 or younger . 
  also known as being neighbours to slovenia :p, 
   as far as i know civilization vi is able to declare war with your character to your nation how does this even look ? 
  also a gooner . 
  left side would get absolutely destroyed, 
   minister of veterans huh , what does he do ? 
  [ leskova\u010dki \u0107evapi ] ( http://ot-foodspotting-production.s3.amazonaws.com/reviews/2252727/thumb_600.jpg?1345347964 ) , from serbia . 
  so good . 
  also loved a soup called [ \u017durek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sour_rye_soup ) '' i tried in poland last month . 
  basically a soup made out of fermented ( soured ? ), 
  rye flour with some sausage added to it . 
  the taste has delicious sourness to it . 
  edit : also burek and kebabs , of course . 
  you think spain would n't block that ? 
  often we are in there as well . 
  there 's no 100 % answer , tbf . 
  in our town we have three thrash bins , one for organic waste , one for mixed thrash and one for paper/plastic packaging ( recycling stuff ) or similar , although i do n't think the latter is a must have . 
  those are emptied by public services every 10-14 days and they charge you a monthly fee . 
  you also have the option of disposing large thrash pieces , like furniture , house machines , etc. 
  at a huge community sorting location , if you are paying the monthly fee . 
  you can also dispose toxic materials there and is strongly advised . 
  edit : forgot to mention that we can also take paper/glass/plastic to some other public bins , which helps not filling your own bin too quickly . 
  i second this . 
  a bit embarassing when you crash into one , but still good fun . 
  valid point . 
  op is american afterall, 
  in slavic countries you 're always just enough old , 
  `` letalnica bratov gori\u0161ek '' aka the planica ski flying slope , ski jumper peter `` pero '' prevec . 
  kekec movies . 
  thought you meant a modern family with croatian roots . 
  i swear i 'd need a college degree in some particular dialect , to fully understand them . 
  holy shit , that sounds annoying . 
  how long ago did they reign ? 
  thanks for explanation . 
  got confused for a second . 
  silly croats . 
  no croatian mentioning `` kras '' sweets ? 
  maybe nothing unique , but god damn they are better than most other international brands . 
  if you want a slovenian beer , drink a la\u0161ko . 
  and ignore everyone who says union . 
  no miki muster ? 
   when the borders opened , too many italians came to pick in austria ( for commercial purposes ) , so restrictions were put in place as to how much as single person is allowed to pick . 
  same . 
  greedy , greedy italians . 
  used to come with a van , parked in the middle of the woods and just filled hundreds of jars . 
  huh interesting . 
  bilberries are the tiny ones , right ? 
  those are usually found in our forests .
