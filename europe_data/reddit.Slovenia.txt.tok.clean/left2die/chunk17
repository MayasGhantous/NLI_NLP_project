  there 's also a bunch of smaller streets named after foreign people or places . 
  yeah , like why are all those people searching for water on a chocolate bar ? 
  both the continent and the moon are named after the ancient greek goddess europa .

  ljubljana 's airport is as close to bled as it is to ljubljana . 
  you 'll spend less time on the road if you just go bled  ljubljana  zagreb . 
  there 's a guy near me who owns an old us army jeep , but i imagine that 's just for fun and showmanship . 
  our firemen either use vans or fully sized trucks . 
  most sports : croatia hockey & ski jumping : austria, 
  the fact that we border austria , italy and the balkans should give you a clue . 
  the triglav national park is the only national park in slovenia , but it 's large and covers 4 % of our territory . 
  it covers most of the julian alps in the north-western corner of the country . 
  this picture from [ krn ( 2244m ) ] ( https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-t1bapqm_zow/uzuqjpa7xri/aaaaaaaaaw8/lkzc3om2rpw/s1600/9.jpg.jpg ) gives you a good idea of the landscape . 
  the park 's main landmark is [ triglav ( 2864m ) ] ( http://www.gogorenjska.com/sites/all/files/upload/images/47_0.jpg ) , the tallest mountain and a symbol of slovenia . 
  [ lake bohinj ] ( http://stat.hellomagazin.rs/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/thinkstockphotos-bohinjsko-jezero-1.jpg ) is another landmark . 
  the [ highest road in slovenia ( 1611m ) ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/@46.4065244,13.7432434,3a,75y,161.55h,85.54t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s2_ncbxxtxzax-g-ci92c4g!2e0!6s%2f%2fgeo1.ggpht.com%2fcbk%3fpanoid%3d2_ncbxxtxzax-g-ci92c4g%26output%3dthumbnail%26cb_client%3dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3d2%26w%3d203%26h%3d100%26yaw%3d355.73932%26pitch%3d0%26thumbfov%3d100!7i13312!8i6656?hl=sl ) cuts trough the park and is very popular with cyclists and motorbikers . 
   does slovenian have a single word for everything between noon and midnight then ? 
  no , we have afternoon and evening , just like english . 
  `` morning '' in slovenian is more synonymous with the change from night to day , while `` dopoldne '' is a period that lasts from morning till noon . 
  `` morning '' would be the opposite of `` evening '' , while `` dopoldne '' ( pre-noon ) would be the opposite of `` afternoon '' . 
  a banana , 
   many of them by seeking refuge in the carpathian mountains this would probably be the simplest answer . 
  romanians basically stayed in their cozy mountains , observed the migrations , the invasions and the plagues below , and then moved down when it was safe . 
   actually a romanian public figure has suggested last year that we change our word for `` yes '' because we 're not a slavic people and we should not use a slavic word for `` yes '' . 
  can it happen ? 
  does it have any support among the public ? 
  articles . 
  you would be just another weirdo on a bus . 
  that 's a difficult socioeconomic question that someone could write a thesis about . 
  i would say that it happened gradually with the 1960 's bringing the most critical change . 
  the 60 's change was a combination of terrible ww2 experience , increased education and literacy , and increased access to information via tv and radio . 
  young people from this period grew up in a very different world than their parents . 
  and i would n't say that ww1 did n't bring any change either . 
  i think it did , especially when it comes to women . 
  they got to work and vote for the first time , and they dressed more like they dress today , and less like they dressed in the 19th century . 
  seeing that you 're an american , i feel like i should explain a few things . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jfyeuqd.jpg ) is what most europeans mean when they say they 're going camping , and not [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3bqpstv.jpg ) . 
  these campsites usually provide , water , electricity , toilets and there are often restaurants nearby , so it 's not exactly a wilderness experience . 
  camping outside such campsites is often illegal , and is especially enforced inside nature reserves to prevent fires and littering . 
  hiking is different as well . 
  you either do daily hikes where you return on the same day you left , or you stay at [ mountain huts ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mountain_hut ) overnight . 
  fairly optimistic . 
  the economy is on the rise , unemployment is falling , safety is good , the government is stable . 
  overall , i think the country is heading in the right direction . 
  the only things that worry me are larger eu-scale problems that could affect us , like migration and terrorism . 
  it is up to native english speakers if they want to adopt the short version or not . 
  most european languages already have a short version , so using `` czechia '' comes natural to us . 
  belarus needs to be expelled from this sub then . 
  parents - not that much . 
  their teenage life was relatively similar to mine . 
  they listened to rock music , wore `` cool '' clothes and read comics . 
  some things were different , both politically and socially , but it was n't drastic . 
  grandparents - a lot . 
  they all grew up in rural families with 5 + children . 
  there really was n't any teenage life back then , you went straight from being a child to being an adult . 
  they 're also more religious than both me and my parents . 
  i think italian has a better chance at that . 
  italy is a founding member of the eu and its 3rd most populous country if you do n't count the uk . 
  another idea would be to add a some slavic language like polish . 
  we already have one romance language and two germanic languages , so why not slavic ? 
  they 're used by multiple parties . 
  it 's similar to a hostel . 
  if you 'll be going down that axis , piran is definitely worth checking out . 
  forget about camping , when it comes to the alps , mountain huts are the way to go . 
  wild camping is illegal in most of europe , especially in nature reserves . 
  i suggest you check out [ this blog ] ( http://igowhereyougo.blogspot.si/2016/08/slovenia-is-for-olympians.html ) about an american hiking in slovenia . 
  you should n't worry about border controls , you can cross schengen borders just fine . 
  and besides , the situation is likely to change by the year 2020 . 
  most slovenians speak decent english , especially the younger ones . 
  some people may address you in german either because they do n't speak english , or because they 'll assume you speak german ( which are the most common tourists here ) . 
  american hiking can be very different from european hiking . 
  europeans typically do n't camp in the wild , and in the mountains we stay in mountain huts . 
  you should check out [ this blog ] ( http://igowhereyougo.blogspot.si/2016/08/slovenia-is-for-olympians.html ) by an american who hiked in slovenia . 
  yeah , it 's more practical . 
  often times the surface quality can radically change after a few meters . 
  for example , you start on a snowy local road where you need to use chains , but then get on a perfectly clean motorway where the chains are now a hindrance . 
  winter tires solve that . 
  i just checked the rules and it seems like you need either winter tires or summer tires + chains . 
  however , most people change their tires in march and november . 
  crossing the border should be completely trivial . 
  there are no border crossings and the only thing telling you you 're in slovenia will be a road sign . 
  although there might be heightened police patrols because of the current situation . 
  just act cool and have your documents ready if you get stopped . 
  make sure you drive within the speed limit . 
  on the section between celje and ljubljana , the speed limit sometimes drops down to 100km/h , but most drivers ignore it . 
  do n't ignore it yourself , even if everyone around you drives faster . 
  they recently installed new speed cameras there because of so many offenders . 
  all cars must be equipped with winter tires between 15th november and 15th march . 
  i assume it 's the same in hungary . 
  left lane is for overtaking only . 
  i learned from reddit that this is n't always the case in the us . 
  in hungary , the motorways are marked with blue signs , while in slovenia they 're green . 
  just so you do n't get confused . 
  and finally , you should stop at [ trojane ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/place/gp+trojane/@46.1878746,14.8855014,16.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x2fc42da2bcf1374f!8m2!3d46.1880626!4d14.8838729?hl=sl ) to taste the best donuts in europe . 
  there 's the brdo-brijuni process which is a summit of ex-yugoslav and albanian leaders . 
  most of these alliances are highly informal and not that important . 
  they 're basically just regular meetings of politicians from certain close countries . 
  there 's nothing stopping us from having the same opinions as the v4 , even if we 're not its members . 
  the only thing that really matters is the eu . 
  i 'd like to add that at the start of the war in galicia , many slovenes deserted to the russian side .
