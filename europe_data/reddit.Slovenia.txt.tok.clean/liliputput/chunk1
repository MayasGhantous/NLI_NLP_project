  so nice to know some magical people know how i feel . 
  if i ever need a shrink i know who to turn to . 
  you need to learn what aggressive means . 
  i beg to differ !,

  holy shit , i was joking . 
  for fucks sake . 
  torchic, 
  slovenian chimming in !, 
  we got a wife . 
  we 're kind of rare as well . 
  it was removed . 
  oh shoot , pardon me . 
  i completely missed that 's per 100,000 inhabitants . 
  naah , it 's wrong for slovenia . 
  last number they told us was 493 . 
  that was end of february . 
  i do n't think the number changed much since then , now that the borders are closed . 
  i worked in a temporary center when the flow was stil going and i know a few who worked in a center for asylum seekers . 
  they had around 180 of them at one point . 
  however , two weeks later , almost all of them ran away . 
  that 's too much sarcasm for me to handle :( i would offer to shower you with diamonds , because , well you know , technically we 're richer than you , but i ca n't , because we 're eastern and therefore sub-developed . 
  lol . 
  how is it not crowded ?? 
  i 'm gon na do a full blown retard question but , is it this empty in the summer as well ? 
  uh no . 
  do n't try to correct blatant ignorant mistakes . 
  no one 's talking about `` eastern '' . 
  i 'm talking about `` soviet bloc '' . 
  what country are we talking about here that soviet bloc is mentioned ? 
  no , i 'm not taking this personal in any way . 
  your gdp per capita is around 3000 $ higher ( depending on source ) , so no , i do n't think it takes a miracle to catch that . 
  yea , you 're also 5th biggest by population , so common sense can tell you that you should be somewhere up there . 
  i fully agree with everything you wrote there . 
  i did n't give a crap about the actual post , it 's just what came after that . 
  really sorry , but i worry about spanish education and/or ignorance . 
  that 's a pretty stupid article . 
   eastern is a term to refer to former soviet bloc countries in eastern europe ... 
  i wonder what . 
  i 'm pretty aware maps made by reddit users are not exactly scientific data . 
  so i was n't triggered at all before you started talking nonsense . 
  so you think we 're automatically poorer than you , `` western pearls '' , because we 're , by your knowledge , ex-soviet block ( even though we 're not ) ? 
  despite all the indicators and pretty much comparable living standards ? 
  pardon my sub-laugh , i find that quite funny . 
  so how is slovakia develped but slovenia undeveloped ? 
  please , do n't embarass yourself . 
  funny , are portugal and greece considered `` eastern '' too ? 
  will you be considered `` eastern '' once slovenia and czech r. overpass you ? 
  and when did slovakia overpass you to derserve a title of `` developed nation '' ? 
  not worth visiting by car ? 
  it 's exactly worth visiting by car . 
  i 'll take any gay turtle that wants to seek refuge !, 
  no i do n't need to reword anything . 
  however , there should have been a comma in there . 
  my tits are pretty calm . 
  many people who ? 
  i 'm pretty sure most people who would even refer to those three countries as baltic countries , reffer to them in a geographical way . 
  as in `` i want to visit the baltics '' . 
  for those who do n't , i do n't think it matters what countries you 're grouped with . 
  because they are geographically grouped together ? 
  balkan countries are historically , linguistically , culturally , religiously and what not different as well , yet they 're still grouped together . 
  same with other regions . 
  it 's geographical , nothing else , ffs . 
  when people talk about baltic , they usually talk about their geographical position , as in being in that certain area . 
  my god . 
  eastern coast of the baltic sea ? 
  i 'm pretty sure estonia is traditionally included in the baltics . 
  never heard it any other way . 
  i consider baltic a regional thing . 
  definitely not a language group . 
  sub developed ? 
  what ? 
  the last i checked slovenia had a higer hdi than spain . 
  i get the same results as on the map in incognito mode in various browsers : / why google so shady ? 
  i would n't really put last year winning song into `` quality '' category . 
  i think a song that 's easy to listen to and a good stage performance and everything that comes along is a combination that brings points . 
  quality by itself does n't do much . 
  whatever , we will stil be watching !, 
  well it has surely become a point : / i think a lot of us still want to hear some quality entries , like italy . 
  edit : though that would take all the fun out of it . 
  i watch a stream over the internet just for graham norton !, 
  i love him . 
  if you go , i hope he remains . 
  as we do here in europe . 
  another common feeling is frustration . 
  frustration over how ludicrous most of the entries are year after year and nothing changes . 
  that 's why i made an english search one for slovenia . 
  a lot of countries did n't even get autocompleted or they got completed in another language : / most people google in english anyway so perhaps english results are more accurate . 
  what are you on about ? 
  their song was great . 
  i searched why [ country ] not why is [ country ] !, 
  i get `` why is germany so depressing '' and `` why is sweden destroying itself '' as well !, 
  haha . 
  our mistery is mistery no more !, 
  i decided to do my search without `` is '' beacause less results came out as `` poor '' . 
  it was too depressing .
