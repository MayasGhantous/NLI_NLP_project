  not sure why it would be more practical since it can only be used in norway , but ok . 
  wow til , but why ? 
  how is police supposed to confirm your identity from a bank card ?? 
  drivers licence at least has a photo of you . 
  and no , it 's only accepted as something to identify you within your country , not abroad . 
  what the heck ? 
  we have fire drills . 
  huh , interesting !, 
  traunik , michigan is named after travnik in municipality of lo\u0161ki potok and st. stephen ( sv . 
  \u0160tefan ) , minnesota was founded by slovenes . 
  i have explained everything already . 
   i 'm actually trying to see things from your perspective but you 're not making it easy for me . 
  do n't try to divert your previously aggressive tone into this now . 
  i 'm done with this . 
  you can keep blabbing if you wish . 
  you are . 
  you 're taking what i said out of the context to fit your agenda . 
   if you feel you 're too good to explain yourself why even bother commenting ? 
  and again , making stuff up as you go . 
  this is going nowhere , you 're clearly unable to debate and respect other kinds of opinions . 
   if you feel you 're too good to explain yourself why even bother commenting ? 
  that just does n't make any sense . 
  nothing you said stands . 
  cut the crap with this passive aggressive behaviour and putting words in my mouth . 
  if you do n't know how to debate with a normal tone then i 'm out .

  what a good argument , making things up ... 
  yes , that 's the point . 
  yes ... 
  exactly ... you ca n't measure happiness because everyone sees happiness differently . 
  it does make a lot of difference . 
  it measures perceived happines , not actual happines . 
  skills . 
  i 'm not sure why genetics/ancestry would matter . 
  culture - does n't matter as long as they integrate and respect our laws and social norms . 
  no because everyone experiences happines and its levels differently . 
  what you describe as 7/10 happines may be 5/10 for someone else and 9/10 for a 3rd person . 
  i really do n't think there is a common attitude for this . 
  i guess you are right . 
  no you ca n't . 
  you can sort of assess your own happines but you ca n't compare it to others . 
  they 're sold here as jamon serrano . 
  i 'll have to try it . 
  we need white reflectors outside of settlements and in unlit settlements as well . 
  yea , [ same ] ( https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nappic/1/579/_5657820002ec0.jpg ) here . 
  in [ postojna cave ] ( https://www.postojnska-jama.eu/assets/spoznajte-park/dogodki/zive-jaslice/postojna-cave-live-christmas-crib-zive-jaslice-12.jpg ) they use an actual black guy . 
  i do n't agree with either of you , but people here have no regard for voting rules . 
  you 're not supposed to downvote an oppinion you do not agree with . 
  it 's stupid . 
  all of these except for ` vorspiel and nachspiel ' are not weird and unique at all . 
  / # 2 , 4 and 6 apply to other countries as well . 
  # 5 probably as well . 
  neh , never heard of a carp thing before . 
  no , krampus is a thing in more countries than austria . 
  yea and whiny . 
  especially women . 
  i do n't know i never tried it . 
  i 'm not a fan of cured meat . 
  but is n't jamon a protected label ? 
  which means it should be pretty much the same everywhere . 
  or is jamon serrano different ? 
  well if you ask my mom , dust , dirt , too hot in summer . 
  if you ask me , pretty much the same but it 's comfortable for kids . 
  heated floor exist nowadays , so do normal carpets you can take outside and dust plus they 're easier to change . 
  \u0160lape is a word for slippers here too . 
   it 's normal to have a sweet dish as a main dish ( ovocne knedliky , sisky etc. ), 
  surely that 's normal everywhere where we eat those knedels . 
  danes ca n't inhale with that potato stuck in their mouth . 
  lmao !, 
  but is n't that a [ wall carpet ] ( http://weirdrussia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bears2.jpg ) ? 
   jam\u00f3n i 'm pretty sure it 's available throughout europe . 
  it sure is here . 
  those are just slippers not shoes ... 
  does any other country in europe still ~ ~ has ~ ~ have wall to wall carpets other than the uk ? 
  i definitely do n't connect that with materialism ... that 's being stingy or not being stingy and i do n't see that having to do anything with materialism . 
  materialism to me is showing off what you have . 
  buying a car/holidays you ca n't afford , buying expensive brand clothes ( can also be fake ) with possibly huge brand writting in the front , presenting yourself as someone who earns more than they actually do ... etc. 
   ex-ussr and yu are a lot less material then western europe in general , italy and spain included . 
  that 's just not true . 
   in my experience , dutch people are very materialistic that is true . 
  that could be . 
  i was thinking of submissive position . 
  i ca n't say about the most , but croatians and serbs are . 
  at least compared to us . 
  edit : to butthurt people downvoting , hover your mouse pointer over the downvote arrow without clicking and read what it says . 
  i think they 're both correct . 
  some prefer one , some prefer the other one . 
  i use both , i do n't even think about which one i use . 
  i think ` slovenian ' is more commonly used . 
  you 're welcome . 
  i just want to add something to 6th sentence . 
  it makes more sense in slovene . 
  * super !, 
  ( lit . - air quality is not suitable for sensitive people . 
  be careful/cautious ) * o ne , kvaliteta zraka je slaba . 
  ( lit . - air quality is bad . 
  be careful/cautious . ), 
  ( lit . - air quality is very bad . ), 
  ( lit . - i ca n't find data about air quality for this place . ), 
  ( lit . - i do n't have data for this country . ),
