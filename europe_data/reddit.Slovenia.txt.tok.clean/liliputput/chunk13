  massages in spas are a thing . 
  i do n't think i have ever heard of a massage place only , outside of a spa center , except for thai massage . 
  i still have those badges that i did n't sew on my shirt . 
  i was cleaning my shit some time ago and could n't throw them away . 
  i have so many great memorries with scouts . 
  one of them i earned by staying quiet for 12 hours lol . 
  i 'm pretty sure every major tele-company here has an app and a website that live streams certain tv channels . 
  you can also watch everything back for 72 hours . 
  i can watch 89 channels on my tvin app . 
  you have to be subscribed to certain tv box packs to have this option free though . 
  our national tv channel rtv also streams all their channels on mmc . 
  oh yes , that 's definitely true . 
  the city center was super empty years ago . 
  it 's better now but still nothing close to lj . 
  it 's also a lot smaller , so ... 
  quite common yes . 
  our scouts are divided into ' [ taborniki ] ( http://www.taborniki.si/ ) ' ( non religious ) and ' [ skavti ] ( http://skavti.si/zskss-en ) ' ( religious ) . 
  taborniki are quite a bit more common . 
  i was a ` tabornik ' when i was a kid . 
  it sounds pretty much the same as what you described . 
  we had a lot of competitions like orienteering and exchanges with foreign scouts . 
  i remember going camping with german scouts and older scouts going to chile for jamboree . 
  there 's also a series of [ movies ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da8mvoqbfks ) about taborniki . 
  i have lived in celje my whole life and we always spent a lot of time drinking ` coffee ' . 
  i do n't think there was any apples . 
  i think i remember some shredded cabbage . 
  but it 's some time ago , so do n't take my word . 
  not weird . 
  it probably depends on your circle of friends . 
  i do n't drink and no one has ever made me feel weird because of it . 
  i always use twat because it feels less insulting than anything else . 
  i walk barefoot all day as well in my home . 
  i understand it 's awesome to walk on and especially to play on when you 're a kid but i do n't understand it from cleanliness perspective . 
  i 'm not a clean freak at all , but carpeted floor is a bit much . 
  maybe that 's just because i 'm not used to it . 
  yes , very sure . 
  i 'm pretty sure there was carrot in there , yep . 
  there 's no bad guy population control in miami anymore . 
  csi : miami alligators cubans, 
  i was pretty sure it was a hotel in krakow but now i 'm not sure anymore . 
  i never understood those carpet floors about american and uk houses . 
  just why ? 
  especially americans that wear shoes inside . 
  i ca n't immagine what life must be for those allergic to dust mites . 
  i have never seen a house here that has carpet floors in any room . 
  noooo ` how are you ' here is a question . 
  you say it after a greeting but it 's not just a greeting , you expect an answer to it . 
  you only say it to people you know and people you want to know how they 're doing , not strangers . 
  there 's around 15 kids available for adoption each year . 
  i 'm pretty sure orphanages do n't exsist anymore , at least not here . 
  we have youth homes that work as family units . 
  majority of kids ( not orphans ) who ca n't stay with their families at the given time for various reasons go into foster care . 
  idk if it was in slovakia or poland but in one of those countries they put sugar on salads !!, 
  and in slovakia i got a little butter stick ( aprox . 
  cm thick ) rolled in ham for dinner . 
  no bread or anything to spread it on . 
  idk if that 's culture shock but it was weird . 
  i remember encountering that thing when i was a kid somewhere near monte santo di lussari . 
  it was definitely not a campside . 
  it was either a rest stop with other amenities than just restrooms or a restaurant . 
  one of the winners in one of the big brothers was a trans woman . 
  there was some talk , nothing too serious , but she won at the end , so i guess people are n't that bothered ? 
  but i feel like the more these things are talked about the more people get annoyed by it . 
  also , one of contestants of some other reality tv show was a croatian trans woman , that is quite known otherwise as well . 
  wtf ? 
  i do n't think we have one . 
  it would probably be a bee . 
  or a bear or an ibex . 
  or a stork or a human fish . 
  idk . 
  my vote goes to the bee . 
  we really do n't have any . 
  it was a schengen legislation that said to toughen up controls . 
  and yes , even people leaving the schengen zone needed to be checked . 
  you have internet , it seems like you can read , google it . 
  stop pulling bitter shit out of your ass . 
  great minds think alike !, 
  do n't steal my answer boy !, 
  i remember novohla\u010dniki ( knickerbocker-bande ) but i preffered the famous five by enid blyton . 
  did you miss all the shit hungary got for protecting their schengen border ? 
  and slovenia ? 
  we had to loosen up our schengen border controls because of croatian tourism . 
  you think ? 
  slovenes that live by the border usually speak both languages . 
  but people across the borders do n't bother with slovene at all . 
  you should ask on r/slovenia about the quality of that faculty . 
  i did n't study there , maybe someone on our subreddit did . 
  since the whole course is in english , i do n't think you 'd need to learn the language . 
  [ business and economics ] ( http://www.ef.uni-lj.si/content/static_english/izobrazevanje/dodiplomsko/home.asp ) programme is fully in english at uni of ljubljana . 
  it 's free for eu students plus students get a lot of benefits so you can get by for a lot less than 1000 $ per month . 
  [ youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/ekonomskafakulteta/videos ) channel . 
  for eu students and a few others only . 
  and there 's other benefits so it 's cheap . 
  i do n't know how many classes are actually taught in english though . 
  i think you can get economics fully in english . 
  i have never heard of anyone giving a fuck about that . 
  drnov\u0161ek did n't have one either . 
  jan\u0161a did n't have one when he was a prime minister either . 
  cerar does n't have one either .
