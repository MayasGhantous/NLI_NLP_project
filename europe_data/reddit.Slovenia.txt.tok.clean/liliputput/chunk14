  tons of people i know are n't married , heck even my parents are n't married . 
  i do n't know anyone that gives a crap wether someone 's married or not . 
  i understand things the same as you . 
  slovene is not an ethnicity to me . 
  it 's a nationality . 
  i hope i understood this question right . 
  branko \u0110uri\u010d , denis avdi\u010d and probably tons more from bosnia and serbia . 
  iryna osypenko , a model from ukraine . 
  nadiya bychkova , a dancer , also from ukraine . 
  lukas zuschlag a ballet dancer from austria . 
  edward clug from romania , also something to do with ballet . 
  peter bossman from ghana , mayor of piran . 
  isaac palma from argentina , a singer ( ? ) . 
  jette ostan vejrup , a theatre actress * from denmark . 
  marlene ottey , an athlete from jamaica . 
  marcos tavares , brazilian football player . 
  diego barrios ross , venezuelan opera singer . 
  michael manske , american born in germany , journalist . 
  he does this show on radio , `` how to become a slovene '' . 
  no but they have that in some places in japan . 
  kind of creepy . 
  of course you can . 
  but lidl selling american themed food and people eating it is not a celebration of 4th of july . 
  it was a joke dear people . 
  there 's an official celebration in ljubljana . 
  that 's it . 
  if you were a tourist you would n't know it 's a statehood day . 
  especially if you 're anywhere else but ljubljana . 
  some people hang flags on their houses . 
   consuming a chocolate bunny at easter is no different than consuming spooky candy on halloween is no different than consuming american burgers in stars & stripes packaging on 4th july . 
  it is . 
  easter is our culture . 
  halloween and especially 4th of july are n't . 
  it 's like someone assuming i 'm celebrating austrian national day by eating a mozartkugel or schnitzel . 
  i celebrate when they sell asahi and sapporo beer , even though it 's disgusting , but it reminds of of my travels in japan . 
  excuse me ? 
  consuming themed products is ` celebration ' of independence day ? 
  my comment was n't aimed at you . 
  us embassy are americans so it makes sense that they celebrate and invite guests . 
  our government invites foreign officials on 25th of june as well . 
  lidl just uses the day to sell their products . 
  i do n't see how that qualifies as any sort of celebration . 
  most people are n't even aware it 's a special day in the us . 
  nope . 
  what are we celebrating when lidl sells spanish or japanese food ? 
  who came up with that language ? 
  smh, 
  selling themed products is not the same as celebrating . 
  they have them in japan as well , not exactly a developing country . 
  no , we have [ this ] ( https://www.visitljubljana.com/assets/ljubljana-in-regija/kavalir/kavalir-d.-weadm.jpg ) , [ this ] ( https://www.visitljubljana.com/assets/ljubljana-in-regija/kavalir/kavalir-dunja-wedam.jpg ) and [ this beauty ] ( http://www.blog.uporabnastran.si/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/urban-elektricni-vlakec-lpp.png ) ( look at the last one on your own risk , it 's so pretty ) in ljubljana . 
  they 're not really walking ... but [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px8f4b2f6ug ) . 
  no , it 's really not . 
  there 's no reason to celebrate another country 's independence day . 
  ca n't smoke in public indoors here either . 
  ca n't smoke in a car with a minor here either . 
  legal age is 18 . 
  any sort of advertising ( also sponsoring ) is illegal . 
  flavoured cigarettes are illegal . 
  unified packaging with graphic immages . 
  we do have strict laws . 
  so maybe you have to look into history of such laws . 
  i guess it was stricter in the us back in the day . 
  or maybe there 's some other reason . 
  superga were a thing decades ago . 
  i only see women wearing them nowadays and even that quite rarely . 
  popular shoes that i do n't see people wearing in other countries are salomon trail runners . 
  though i would n't say they 're fashionable , they 're more of a free time shoe . 
  i ca n't immagine that being normal anywhere . 
  i have young people on one side of the family that do n't speak english . 
  i consider them dumb . 
  very dumb . 
  not just because of english but because they are dumb . 
  our windows do n't open the way yours do . 
  i do n't think those things could be installed here . 
  they sell portable ac 's here though . 
  bloke was the beginning of skiing in this area , of course inventions and further development then followed . 
  we did n't just start skiing with modern skis . 
  all in all , we all contributed a lot to the best sport in the world . 
  yea , i never disputed that . 
  i have the same for 12 $ . 
  i pay 12 $ as an extention to a tv + internet + landline phone package . 
  i have unlimited texts , unlimited calling and 3gb of data . 
  slalom is a discipline . 
  whut ? 
  skiing in central europe began in [ bloke ] ( http://www.ukom.gov.si/en/media_room/major_events/candidacy_for_the_winter_olympic_games_2006/slovene_winter_sports/bloke_the_cradle_of_skiing_in_central_europe/ ) . 
  actually , skiing in alps began in slovenia . 
  so austrians , swiss and germans can thank us . 
  modern skiing would be nothing without an invention of carving skis , which is our invention . 
  woop woop , we 're ahead of you . 
  ours was bellow 2 million and it 's ~ 2.066.000 now . 
  i think we hit 2 million around 2005 . 
  there 's a few restaurants in ljubljana and probably one or two in maribor and that 's it . 
  it 's not popular but i wish it was . 
  indian food is my favourite . 
  naah lol you dind ` t. 
  or [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6di4gs/slovenians_of_reddit_what_do_you_think_of_melania/ ) . 
  edit : i see more articles about her in croatian media than in ours . 
  i really do n't care what he consideres himself . 
  he clearly has some slovene herritage but if he does n't want to acknowledge it , that 's fine with me . 
  my op was a joke , did n't think anyone would take it seriously .
