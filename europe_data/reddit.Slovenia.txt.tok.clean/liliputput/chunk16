  why do americans transport their dogs without buckling them or putting them in a transporter ? 
  it would be a valid question here lol, 
  it 's becoming more common , especially in the cities . 
  pamflets/fliers/whatever they 're called are filled with air conditioning offers . 
  crearly , it 's [ this one ] ( https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large/frenchman-alex-zak.jpg ) . 
  i love it !, 
  klan\u0161ko jezero v nevihti - klan\u0161ek lake in a storm . 
  klan\u0161ko jezero is another name for belope\u0161ka jezera or laghi di fusine in italian . 
  i watched peer gynt ballet ( this one [ by edward clug ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iujat_xuiqs ) ) . 
  it was creepy . 
  music wise , for slovenia , it could be [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qia2t94frw8 ) . 
  and [ this ] ( http://img.rtvslo.si/_up/ava/ava_archive02/content/thumbnail/174386738/ivan_grohar_-_pod_koprivnikom.jpg ) painting . 
  edit : thinking about it , maybe not . 
  the painting is idealistic . 
  maybe [ this ] ( https://img.rtvslo.si/_up/upload/2012/12/28/64948584_pernhart_klansko1_show.jpg ) one . 
  i do n't have health concerns but every single albanian ice cream i tried was very artificial . 
  there 's an albanian ice cream stand in a nearby village and everyone there loves that ice cream and would say it 's the best but that 's only because they do n't eat proper ice cream often . 
  a lot . 
  i ca n't recall such bimbos at presidental elections either . 
  this next presidental elections we 'll aparently have everything from ` actors ' , ` singers ' and self declared ` celebrities ' ... 
  our ice cream ( and pizza ) is better than italian . 
  truth . 
  do n't listen to anyone else . 
  just do n't go to albanian stands . 
  vig\u00f2 , zvezda , fetiche patisserie in ljubljana all have great ice creams . 
  lolita is supposedly good too . 
  [ a mullet , yes ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=bundesliga+haircut&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi_v7vi-dtuahxmnpokhbp-c5mq_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638 ) . 
  socks and sandals and a bundesliga haircut of course !, 
  edit : and flipflops in the mountains . 
  and then germans and italians and czechs . 
  dialects from [ primorska ] ( https://youtu.be/eane5etcnt4 ) . 
  all team sports are pretty equally popular here i 'd say . 
  oh yes , i 'm sure everyone 's willing to spend 1000 $ + on a bike . 
  you 're completely oblivious to different types of settlements in different countries , landscapes and climate . 
  you need to travel more . 
  i 'm sorry , but danish hills mean flat land here ... your temperatures are also lower in summer than ours . 
  yep . 
  slovene ( or italian/hungarian ) , math and 1st foregn language are the core subjects . 
  then you have to chose two additional subjects among other subjects you took during high school . 
  so 5 in total . 
  i took psychology and geography . 
  slovene ( ita/hun ) , math and 1st forign language are both oral and written exams , the rest are only written . 
  and for slovene there 's also an essay exam from 2-4 assigned books we get at the beginning of school year . 
  this year they had brave new world by aldous huxley and alamut by vladimir bartol . 
  when i took an exam we had the physicists by friedrich d\u00fcrrenmatt , kralj na betajnovi by cankar , tartuffe by moliere and vladimir by matja\u017e zupan\u010di\u010d . 
  when you open an exam you get essay questions from each book and you chose which one you want to write . 
  1st exam is an essey at the beginning of may and the last written one is somewhere mid june . 
  oral exams are a week after last written exam . 
  edit : media does follow it but only to say when exams begin and to tell the results - how many passed , how many failed how many got all the points etc. . . 
  this year there was a bit of controversy about an essay , because one of the topics was `` suicide as a way out of the wheel of the system '' . 
  general public does n't care . 
  we have an [ e-library ] ( https://www.biblos.si/ ) . 
  i 'd like to see you cycle to work over hills in 30 \u00b0 c heat or in snow . 
  you only had one book for your literature exam ? 
  whut ? 
  we had to know like , idk , [ 100 works ( p. 22 ) ] ( http://www.ric.si/mma/2017%20m-slo-2017/2015083113005330/ ) , everything about periods they were written in , people who wrote them , why they wrote it , drama triangle , poetry metre and all that stuff . 
  we had a written and oral exam . 
  one of the questions i got on my oral exam was develpment of slovene prose from realism to expressionism . 
  lmao , i 'll never forget that question . 
  another one was henrik ibsen - nora . 
  that one saved me . 
  we have 5-7 per year and in 4th grade usually 3 that are then on matura exam . 
  for other works we do summaries or excerpts . 
  i wonder what they do all year if they discuss so few books . 
  we do grammar and literature , all in 1 class , 4 hours per week . 
  green, 
  do n't you have a final exam in which you need to know certain books/poems and know a bit about whoever wrote them ? 
  i do n't know . 
  we had tons . 
  german , french , italian , russian , spanish ... you name it . 
  would be good to know which part of primorska he 's from . 
  the coast ? 
  everytime i 've been to tolmin and kobarid people take their shoes off . 
  we also do faust and the sorrows of young werther . 
  one of those each year . 
  pre\u0161eren and cankar are the main one . 
  you 're flat !, 
   but it 's kind of ridiculous how some people queue for things like boarding an airplane . 
  o.o you do n't ? 
  confidence . 
  you have no idea how much dirt there 's stuck in average slovene 's salomon trail runners . 
  you weird , weird people . 
  seriously , you do n't take your shoes off in primorska ? 
  kind of . 
  that was an anthem of sr slovenija . 
  it 's an anthem of slovenian armed forces now . 
  you just learn it throughout your childhood . 
  by the time we learnt about the meaning and everything around pre\u0161eren ( probably around grade 8 ) , i 'm pretty sure majority if not everyone knew the lyrics . 
   in general , what 's your opinion about your national anthem 's lyrics ? 
  do you like them ? 
  yes , very much . 
  i do think it 's not really inspiring for sport events . 
  you do n't get hyped up singing it like , for example , italians do . 
   if you hear the song being played , do you sing it , or you just could n't care less ? 
  sing it or listen to it . 
   would you like the text to be `` modernised '' or `` updated '' , or do you prefer all the stuff about ancient wars and kings ? 
  ours is about friendship , so nope , i want it to stay the way it is . 
  that 's really not the case in my experience . 
  they always expect us to speak croatian , especially in istria . 
  dalmatians are way nicer .
