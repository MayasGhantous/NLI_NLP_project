  in the countryside as well ? 
  funny , because no one tries to speak slovenian . 
  no one ? 
  edit : from my experience , even family usually announces their visit unless they live very close by and visit eachother often . 
  i usually do n't tell my grandma that i 'm comming because i 'm there very often , but when she comes to my place , which does n't happen that often , she will let me know . 
  same goes for friends . 
  idk why we have to keep hearing about it . 
  we know . 
  other countries/regions/cities also have high numbers of non-natives but no one complains as much as you . 
  not even latvians . 
  yada yada ... 
  still ca n't see a reason for constant complaining on reddit . 
  i 'm not saying they do n't have reasons to complain , i 'm saying that estonian reddit users ( and probably beyond ) use every opportunity to complain about them . 
  from what i managed to read , both serbia and bih have catch-neuter-release programs but they do n't follow them and obviously government does nothing to enforce it . 
  no , never been there . 
  this one and r/europe . 
   not as much as estonians that 's the point . 
  probably not a single day on reddit goes by that i do n't see an estonian mentioning russians . 
  there also has to be a change in mentality of people . 
  until people wo n't stop throwing dogs out on the streets , or worse , killing them when they get bored of them , piling them up in shelters wo n't help much : /, 
  other countries also have reasons to complain , yet they do n't do it over and over and over and over again . 
  i like them as much as i like estonians constantly complaining about russians . 
  it 's always on when i turn on the radio in my car . 
  so i have n't been listenig to radio for a few weeks now . 
  i became aware of this song and that fonzi guy because i turned the radio off so often that i decided to find out what idiot made this song . 
  i 'm sorry to spanish people but i ca n't stand spanish in music . 
  and this song makes my aversion even worse . 
  never scroll into a comment section , especially in the morning when all the unemployed trolls are active !,

  what do these music classes offer ? 
  we also have music class from grade 1-9 and 1st year of high school but they do n't teach instruments apart from simple ones like orff instruments . 
  it 's mostly simple music theory , music history and similar . 
  extra curricular music school is where you learn to play on an instrument of your choice or solo singing . 
  if anyone was to celebrate , it would be elementary and high schools . 
  but it 's 2 days before end of school year , so they do n't . 
  extra curricular music schools also already ended their school year . 
  that has no connection to music day . 
  you are my kind of a traveler !, 
  it 's a mystery . 
  our [ president ] ( https://www.instagram.com/borutpahor/ ) is an instagram star . 
  he used to be a [ model ] ( http://www.mladina.si/media/www/slike.old/clanki/200726/profil_pahor_display.jpg ) and he had his own [ calendar ] ( https://www.rtvslo.si/zabava/druzabna-kronika/foto-od-januarja-do-decembra-naj-bo-z-vami-borut-pahor/353179 ) a few years ago .

  he once had a [ card ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da3n-0hhra4 ) in front of him saying ` i 'm a slovene , i do n't whine , i look for solutions ' . 
  that 's as interesting as he gets .

  memorials do n't have road accident statistics written on them . 
  a country without a single road memorial can have a 10 times worse statistics than a country with lots of them . 
  it stil does n't make sense why a memorrial by the road would make you question safety . 
  it 's how they mourn . 
   he even said that this was noticeable when you were on the streets and every now and then you came across a road side memorial of someone who was killed in an accident . 
  is this accurate ? 
  how is that even a cause of concern ? 
  does no one die in car crashes in portugal ? 
   being european means being white . 
  what ? 
  european is not a race ... 
  yea , up to 25 , 26 max , would be ideal .

  i 'm sorry but christmas is n't christmas without a coca-cola add :p, 
  yep , i 'm pretty sure we have one of those laying around somewhere .

  i always thought aksel lund svindal had the coolest name . 
  ragnhild mowinckel on the other hand ... 
   owned a personal protection kit , with a gas mask and extra filters , heavy plastic sheet and some other bits and bobs was it an army green bag ? 
  we have one of those at home . 
  i think of the one from beauty and the beast . 
  fire drill only . 
  it was always an event . 
  firefighters came with sirens on , some students were picked to jump on those inflatable things from a classroom , others had to do standard emergency preocedures . 
  then outside they showed us various things . 
  most of the time police came too . 
  we always looked forward to fire drills . 
  all my ancestors , as far as we can tell , lived in the area we still live . 
   this winter from august until the end of december winter starts 21st december . 
  meh , i did n't know either until reddit told me . 
  i think most people associate it with eu only . 
  it 's a flag of europe/council of europe , not just eu . 
  it sounds most of slovenia really . 
  94.876 ) has a densitiy of 2.300 people/km2 . 
  that 's the city only . 
  the whole municipality is at 760 people/km2 . 
  this one seems to be more dense than , um , smaller cities , and one big ( ? ), 
  city . 
  those are at around 1.700 .

   skeleton racing  boblseigh wow that 's really interesting, 
  is latvia even good at any sport ? 
  it does n't irk me that they think it 's beautiful , it irks me that people keep underestimating us in pretty much everything .
