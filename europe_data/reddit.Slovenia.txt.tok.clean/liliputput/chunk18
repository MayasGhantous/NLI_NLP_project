  some weeks ago , a swede here on reddit asked if slovenia is a ` low key ' good place to live in . 
  really ? 
  edit : ` slightly annoyed ' would probably be a better description than ` irked ' . 
  listen to the sound of crickets ... 
  i guess it would be [ branko oblak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/branko_oblak ) and [ zlatko zahovi\u010d ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zlatko_zahovi%c4%8d ) . 
  we have better goalkeepers like [ samir handanovi\u010d ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samir_handanovi%c4%87 ) and [ jan oblak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jan_oblak ) . 
  no one has big expectations for this place . 
  quite the opposite actually . 
  they expect to see shit lying everywhere , people begging on every corner and run down towns . 
  nothing irks me more than people saying `` wow , i never knew slovenia is so beautiful '' . 
  get a fucking laptop and google it , damn it . 
  edit : come to think of it ... a lot of people overestimate the size of ljubljana . 
  they expect a big city since it 's the capital . 
  but for fucks sake , it has a population of less than 300k . 
  historically it was n't even a city with the biggest slovene population . 
  it was n't even a cultural capital . 
  yep , sounds about right . 
  i wonder why they still bother . 
  well majority are n't without it either . 
  general is not * the right word to use here at all . 
  edit : t in ` not ', 
  it 's definitely a norm in southern countries . 
  unless you do n't count that as europe . 
   or in europe in general . 
  uh yes we do . 
  in my previous apartment i always turned it off . 
  i did n't have it on all day either . 
  i usually turned it on in the afternoon after cooking to chill down the place before i went to bed . 
  even with air con , the temperature never went bellow 26 \u00b0 c in the warmest days because my windows did n't have any outside blinds . 
  sometimes it felt like living in an aquarium . 
  if the temperatures fell bellow 26 at night , i opened balcony doors and windows and set my alarm clock to around 6am so i would close them down when sun was starting to rise . 
  not something to brag about , honestly . 
  it 's difficult to explain coz i 've no clue about linguistics . 
  the way they pronounce words and the accent is on times very russian sounding to me . 
  but why would you even go and explain your ` hardcore anti-american views ' to people ? 
  if someone asks you , just say ' i do n't like trump ' , they 'll probably agree and move on . 
  just contain yourself , do n't get pissy about opinions . 
  i never found romanian to sound like italian . 
  italian has umm ... a melody to it , idk how to describe it , that romanian does n't . 
  to me it does . 
  russian mixed with spanish is a perfect discription for my ears . 
   how is it possible that there are stands in their supermarkets where people can try some of the products for free . 
  lol what ? 
  i almost never even see anyone but kids trying stuff from those stands . 
  most people just awkwardly look away and pretend they do n't see them . 
  only western part of the country has an italian accent . 
  no idea . 
  i bet cough drops are a hit that never goes away there . 
  ok , i got my grocery flier infront of me . 
  i 'll give you non-discounted prices of domestic or most popular brands or whatever it 's in this weeks flier . 
  ** coffee ** : barcaffe coffee , 250g - 3,10 $ ** beer ** : kozel premium and dark 0,5 l - 1,29 $ erdinger dunkel and wei\u00df\u00dfier 0,5 l - 1,79 $ 0 g\u00f6sser 6x0 ,5 l - 5,40 $ ** milk ** : alpsko mleko , lactose free uht milk , 1l - 1,57 $ alpsko mleko uht , 1,5 % fat , 1l - 1,05 $ ** loaf of bread ** : grandma 's bread , white or dark , 850g - 2,49 $ krjavelj ( wholemeal round type bread ) , 500g - 1,69 $ 100 year old bread , round type , with seeds 750g , spelt with chia seeds 650g - 2,84 $ ** transportation ticket ** : ljubljana and celje bus - 1,20 $ one way ** cinema ticket ** : regular ticket - 6,20-6 ,90 $ 3d - 6,50-7 ,20 $ ** eating out ** : i could link you some menues . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.mizs.gov.si/en/areas_of_work/directorate_of_higher_education/enic_naric_centre/education_system_in_slovenia/ ) is an in depth description . 
  our low skilled migrants are from non-eu countries . 
  without them we 'd be living out in the open among trash and we 'd have no roads . 
  i am thankful for people willing to do low paying construction jubs in the middle of summer , during the storms and in the coldest days of winter . 
  they deserve more credit . 
  as far as i know , they do get free language classes , they do n't seem to help though . 
  it 's quite a bit more common in slovenia though . 
  [ croatia ] ( http://www.dzs.hr/app/imena/default.aspx ) [ slovenia ] ( http://www.stat.si/imenarojstva/sl/firstnames/searchfirstnames?ime=&amp;priimek=furlan ) i thought it would be more common in [ italy ] ( http://www.sitoufficiale.net/mappa-dei-cognomi-italia/ ) but it 's not . 
  it originates in friuli , so that explains it . 
  furlan ? 
  that 's a slovene last name . 
  edit : oh , she was born to a croatian jewish mother , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] and a father of slovene-croat heritage . 
  i remember him from er . 
  and that woman from lost . 
  [ \u017deljko ivanek ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0411964/ ) . 
  he was in soooo many movies and series , though never in a leading role . 
  his face is very recognisable . 
  then there are a few that have some slovene roots like christoph waltz ( shut up austria ) and david boreanaz/berginc ( slovene-italian ) . 
  that 's about it . 
  if you look at slovene actors in slovenia , we have no acting talent whatsoever . 
  edit : andreas kisser 's ( sepultura ) mother is slovenian . 
   i ** ' ** m ~ ~ ay ~ ~ just ~ ~ be ~ ~ an ignorant american , there you go, 
  that 's actually the first one that popped into my mind as well :p and zmelkow - bit . 
  is this a question about language or nationality ? 
  i assumed nationality . 
  but ... he 's belgian ? 
  idk , maybe [ this one ] ( https://youtu.be/viogqyfazlw?t=80 ) . 
  nope . 
   and actually croatian concorrence has helped to bring down prices here that 's good . 
  dental care is super important . 
  it 's a shame most national health insurances do n't cover it or do n't cover all of it . 
  ours covers the basics but for anything more you have to pay out of your pocket . 
  some people here also do dental tourism ( also eye surgery tourism ) to croatia because it 's much cheaper but there 's tons of warnings about quality ( maybe they 're just afraid of competition ) and importance of having a personal dentist near by . 
  just a heart shaped road . 
  it 's photographed a lot . 
  because that is a pretty famous [ place ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/@46.670939,15.550717,3a,75y,89.58h,81.47t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-df3gpuiii8a%2fv4up4wz2oyi%2faaaaaaabqya%2ffcy7qdbnhfqk3uveoetc7bzvikwdc7reacjkc!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh6.googleusercontent.com%2f-df3gpuiii8a%2fv4up4wz2oyi%2faaaaaaabqya%2ffcy7qdbnhfqk3uveoetc7bzvikwdc7reacjkc%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya50.32921-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i7168!8i3584?hl=sl ) ? 
  how about learning some english and paying for dentists here ? 
  better quality and surely travel cost to dalmatia , possibly even multiple trips in case of complications , is more than the price difference between here and there . 
  not only you 're bad in english but also bad in economics . 
  yep , that 's why i commented that there are photos of slovene styria among photos of southern styria . 
  do you really do dental tourism to croatia ? 
  are you that poor ? 
  even people here know that 's not a good idea in case of complications . 
   do n't even start with that ` rightful clay ' shit again . 
  just saying there 's photos of slovenia among those . 
  like [ this one ] ( https://www.steirische-spezialitaeten.at/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/herzerlstrasse-weinstrasse.jpg ) . 
   also southern styria , almost mediterranean at times . 
  and then there 's photos of slovene styria ... 
  first one is [ mese\u010dev zaliv ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/@45.5368997,13.6091659,3a,75y,39.9h,76.37t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-vtqi2b24dqc%2fvfxqomfqzsi%2faaaaaaaajim%2fyatyydadrd8tmgovnvkc8bdpjksvexrhgcjkc!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh5.googleusercontent.com%2f-vtqi2b24dqc%2fvfxqomfqzsi%2faaaaaaaajim%2fyatyydadrd8tmgovnvkc8bdpjksvexrhgcjkc%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya101.14348-ro-0-fo100%2f!7i8704!8i4352?hl=sl ) - moon bay , near strunjan .
