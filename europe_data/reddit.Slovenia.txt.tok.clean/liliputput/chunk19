  [ closer ] ( http://www.zglavocezbalanco.com/wp-content/gallery/spodmoli/stene-10.jpg ) . 
  even most slovenes do n't know about this place . 
  it does n't even trigger me anymore :(, 
  that we exist . 
  at most , i put 2 or 3 ice cubes in my water when it 's over 30 \u00b0 c. 
  i do n't really care how people in the states like their drinks . 
  nope . 
  but we have [ goni pony ] ( http://www.redbull.com/si/sl/bike/stories/1331859716448/video-red-bull-goni-pony-2017 ) which is a bike race on top of vr\u0161i\u010d pass on pony bikes and dressed in retro or weird clothes . 
  gardaland and mirabilandia in italy are awesome . 
  you also have a water park , movie park and a safari park very close to gardaland . 
  but that 's the only ones i 've been to , so i ca n't compare . 
  i 'm not from ljubljana . 
  i lived in celje and now i live in the countryside of styria . 
  not even in a village , but more of a disperesed settlement . 
  this place is as hickey as it gets , and stuff like in those 2 videos is not a common sight at all . 
  it 's an extreme , not something you 'd describe as typical . 
  no one i know is a typical slovenian then . 
  edit : those are typical hicks who live alone with their mothers , not typical slovenians . 
  hahahahaha, 
  huh ? 
  i wonder if they 're dialect words ? 
  ` mrdati ' is probably a dialect word from ` zmrdovati se ' . 
  i ca n't figure out ' \u010dumeti ' though . 
  first time i heard it . 
  denmark confirmed slavic !, 
  welcome , we love you already !, 
   \u010dumeti , mrdati the heck is that ? 
  it can be interchangeable if you 're into that . 
  morje in slovene , more in croatian . 
  there 's tons of words like this in slavic lanuages . 
  otrok in slovene means child , in slovak it means slave . 
  stol in slovene means chair in croatian table . 
  and so on . 
  whatever my mom mixes from her garden . 
  it 's usually mint , balm mint , chamomile , linden flower , sage ... stuff like that . 
  other than that jasmine green tea , matcha and earl grey, 
  ex yu + albania does n't equal a peninsula . 
  the only thing i know about jordan is petra and queen rania . 
  lebanon is high on my list of must-visit-countries . 
  it seems very beautiful and i looooove lebanese food . 
  i had a few lebanese friends on the internet when i was a teen and they were all great . 
  same here . 
  mine would be maja keuc . 
  i ca n't think of anyone else . 
  yes !, 
  she 's beyond beautiful . 
  yes . 
  everything from spain to sweden . 
  usually something germanic , maybe because of ` ja ' . 
  in japan , they usully say ` ahhhh sweden ' . 
  as if slovenia and sweden sound anything alike . 
  i was never mistaken for a russian , not that i would mind . 
  celjski grofje - counts of celje florijani - florians ( do n't know why they have that name though ) velenjski knapi - miners of velenje, 
  i have never needed to apply for a visa but ca n't you get it at a consulate ? 
  czech rep. has a consulate in vancuver . 
   believe the mossad killed him surprised no one thinks it was carinthian slovenes . 
  not sure , that was never a style here . 
  but you germans should give it a try !, 
  we had that too . 
  another thing that came in bags of chips were little hard plastic things , each shaped differently , we would put on a string and wear around our necks . 
  kind of like [ this ] ( http://lajk.si/sites/default/files/styles/juicebox_large/public/2017-03/plasticne%20dude.jpg?itok=hor8ma6j ) , which was also popular , but a lot smaller . 
  buffalo here too . 
  it started with spice girls i think . 
  later ravers had [ these ] ( http://images.esellerpro.com/3773/i/900/09/buffalo-flames-all4.jpg ) buffalo shoes . 
  huh ? 
  the prefrence is based on individual look , not colour of their stuff . 
  to me venezuelans are kind of equivalent to serbians . 
  very manly . 
  now that you say it , i also find latinas the least attractive . 
  but i like spanish girls a lot . 
  kurc means dick here . 
  do n't try to project your insecurities on me . 
   holland crime !, 
  i was 8 and i did n't know better !, 
  czech republic . 
  is that shuffle or was that something else ? 
  yellow cab shoes . 
  speciifically [ this ] ( http://www.bluemaize.net/im/shoes/yellow-cab-shoes-1.jpg ) , [ this ] ( http://si.img.kominoi.net/images/2/94303c98ea9ca41081e17ca4f9dadbcd.jpg ) , [ this ] ( https://s1.mojalbum.com/1945791_1946407_1946492/cevlji-in-torbice/37-yellow-cab-cena-2000-sit_z.jpg ) and [ this ] ( https://s7.mojalbum.com/13539437_13788683_18189217/otroska-obutev/poletni-yellow-cab-st-25-10.jpg ) types . 
  but they were super quality . 
  my mom still wears that first example pair . 
  also miss sixty jeans for girls and ~ ~ energy ~ ~ energie for guys . 
  no idea if these brands even stil exsist . 
  edit : also [ this ] ( https://s7.mojalbum.com/5073477_15303258_17380187/rezervirano-in-prodano-hvala-vsem/nes-hlace-36.jpg ) type of pants with patches on knees . 
  nope !, 
  they were super popular here . 
  they were my first concert . 
  if one albanian does n't like you , you 'll soon be surrounded by a group of them . 
  i guess it shows . 
  i know there 's still blood feuds there . 
  probably non existent . 
  judo however , is very popular in my city . 
  no , i 'm not even more attracted to a particular hair or eye colour .
