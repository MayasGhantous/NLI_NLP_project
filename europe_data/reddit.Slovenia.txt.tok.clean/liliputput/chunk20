  i 'm down with anything . 
   solenzara river [ looks ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=solenzara+river&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj58ks0na_uahwmprqkhfokbzyq_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638#imgrc=_ ) quite [ different ] ( https://www.google.si/search?q=solenzara+river&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj58ks0na_uahwmprqkhfokbzyq_auicigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638#tbm=isch&amp;q=so%c4%8da+river&amp;imgrc=_ ) though . 
  there were a few filipinos working as butchers i think ( ? ), 
  in a small village near my village and they were well accepted . 
  there 's also at least one filipino on every season of slovenia got talent . 
  i do n't think people mind them at all . 
  albanian and serbian mafia . 
  yep . 
  it 's in trenta valley . 
  you 're not the only one getting downvoted . 
  my post had 8 upvotes , after i refreshed it had 5 . 
  it happens all the time . 
  either reddit is glitchy or someone keeps downvoting certain users/posts . 
  edit : another refresh and my post is at 3 ... 
   was afraid it was gon na be bled . 
  of course not !, 
  that 's kind of a crime to ask ... maybe [ this place ] ( https://www.google.si/maps/place/so%c4%8da/@46.3361717,13.6458417,3a,75y,322.03h,81.77t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-yikfpy2fry8%2fvioblhpvxbi%2faaaaaaaactc%2fnaro0qofrmglgfwvgkswppxsfaujm8vzacjkc!2e4!3e11!6s%2f%2flh5.googleusercontent.com%2f-yikfpy2fry8%2fvioblhpvxbi%2faaaaaaaactc%2fnaro0qofrmglgfwvgkswppxsfaujm8vzacjkc%2fw203-h100-k-no-pi0-ya107.99994-ro0-fo100%2f!7i9000!8i4500!4m5!3m4!1s0x477baa0061f316c3:0x163bee60453a3a0e!8m2!3d46.0657211!4d13.6016763?hl=sl ) ? 
  that 's what we also think and are taught in schools and i think it 's a [ pretty obvious shape ] ( https://img.rtvslo.si/upload/nove%20tehnologije/matkurja.com.jpg ) . 
  so i do n't know how little imagination one must have to not recognize us on a map . 
  and our 200 + municipalities . 
  i 'll have to watch that . 
  but the ref did a good call , get over it , egg ball throwers !, 
  sorry my memorry has faded !, 
  why would he ` point at the spot ' ? 
  erm , i kind of understand both ? 
  palestine for wanting freedom and israel for fighting against hamas . 
  that was not a goal !, 
  ref blew a whistle way before . 
  against it . 
  there is no reason for it . 
  there are no laws against it as far as i know but our ombudsman of children 's rights once said that circumcision violates boys rights and was forced to publically apologise by a muslim and tiny jewish community . 
  i 'm pretty sure doctors can refuse to do a procedure for non-medical reasons though . 
   misread slovenia as slovakia at first . 
  whatever, 
  if you have time it would probably be best to contact associations . 
  it 's very difficult for able people to judge the accessability . 
  i usually do n't pay attention to it .

  that is not true at all . 
  one strange user on reddit does n't represent us all . 
  over here it 's the fans that have those kind of names . 
  ljubljana ( football and basketball ) - green dragons celje - celjski grofje ( football ) / florijani ( handball ) velenje - velenjski knapi ( football ) la\u0161ko - green bottles ( basketball ) ... 
  i have never seen a shower like that in europe . 
  it 's weird . 
  it does look like half of the door is missing , but who knows . 
  i only have a glass wall which goes half the length of a shower , no doors . 
  but it 's a long shower , no water gets outside . 
  an american journalist even apologized after visiting sevnica for portraying slovenia as a shithole before . 
  i wish they had the guts to say it publicly on their platforms . 
  edit : it 's not only us media , it 's `` western european '' media as well . 
  las vegas is a novelty , some like it some do n't . 
  but there 's tons of awesome stuff in the us . 
  there are definitely companies where you 'd pass with only english , but you 'll do fine with serbian . 
  i do n't think you 'll have much trouble learning slovene . 
  i do n't understand the appeal . 
   could you work in lets say medical center with only english ? 
  of course not . 
  how do you expect to talk to old people and little kids ? 
  i was once treated by a bosnian doctor when i was a kid . 
  he was super nice but i understood complete shit he told me . 
  we have different types of secondary education and exceptions with all this stuff so i 'll only generaly describe how you get into tertiary education from gymnasiums ( general baccalaureate ) and secondary vocational schools ( professional baccalaureate ) . 
  with both types of schools , they count your : * final ` school success ' in 3rd and 4th grade . 
  school success is basically counted from 1-5 , 1 being unsucessful ( failure to pass the year ) and 5 being very successful . 
  * final exam - general baccalaureate ( 5 subjects ) / professional baccalaureate ( 4 + optional 1 subjects ) accumulated points depending on the course you sign up for , they may also look into : * your grades of a specific subject in 3rd or 4th grade and/or your final exam * how successful you are in your special talents , skills , abillities . 
  usually you 'll have to take a sort of an exam to prove these . 
  ljubljana : bela ljubljana - white ljubljana ( maybe because of white ple\u010dnik buildings ? ), 
  celje : kne\u017eje mesto - knyaz/prince city ( because counts of celje ) portoro\u017e : mesto ro\u017e - city/port of flowers ( because portorose ), 
  easter monday assumption of mary ( they considered canceling this one after they returned january 2nd to work free days ) all saints day christmas that 's all . 
  we had nothing . 
  huh they call potatoes ` krumpli ' in prekmurje as well . 
  a dad in drag maybe ? 
  she 's a woman . 
  i never had a baby so i do n't know : / but i think a doctor is present because my mom always points at the doctor that ` birthed me ' . 
  say what ? 
  i do n't remember the last time plastic bags were free . 
  except for those at the self checkout which i re-use for trash . 
  i bring my own fabric bag . 
  spare him his life from this monstrosity . 
  in the city where i used to live , i do n't remember the last time . 
  at our weekend house , deep in the countryside , the last time i remember was during the ice storm couple of years ago . 
  there was no electricity for a week . 
  which was a big problem because , obviously , heating did n't work and all of our pipes would freeze and burst if we did n't somehow manage to get a generator to our house . 
  that was an adventure . 
  after the storm , they put all the cables underground . 
  we were actually the only house at that time in the area that did n't have underground cables . 
  i currently live a tiny bit closer to graz than to ljubljana . 
  also vw caddy maxi , vw t6 furgon , renault megane grandtour expression , audi a4 motorcycles : [ bmw r 1200 rt sf ] ( http://www.avto.info/f/pics/obvestila/clipboard01_177_b.jpg ), 
  i 've been returning to sardinia for a few years now . 
  definitely my favourite . 
   i 'm just saying that is better than executing them . 
  oh yes , i do agree with that . 
  i somehow think most , probably not all , terrorist can be turned around . 
  i have a more difficult time imagining this with paedophiles and people with certain mental issues ( serial killers etc ) . 
  edit : still not saying with should have death penalty for them but sometimes an early emotional response calls for it : /, 
   well , that 's what the eu is all about , is n't it ? 
  european cooperation . 
  this is n't cooperaton . 
  this is putting your burden onto other countries that are n't responsible for it . 
  i understand refugee quotas , but this is unreasonable . 
  so other countries should pay and care for other countries prisoners ?
